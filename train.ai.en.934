Oh, you know, we gotta home to the kids, but we'll take a taxi.
actually, you know, I think I'm ready to head back, too.
it's been a long day.
I'll go get Bruce.
you okay?
Yeah, it's nice having spontaneous nights like this.
I don't want to lose that because of Tokyo.
we'll make it work.
it'll be really great. - Oh, you think?
okay, bye.
you ready to go? - Yeah.
I'll go get my jacket.
the only thing that can save these characters is the act of leaving, not just the desire to leave.
but existentialists don't believe that life actually has an objective.
true, but it still has value, and to achieve that value, a person has to live, not just talk about it.
Anane, this is Laurie Miller, the student I was telling you about.
uh, Anane directed the play.
so, what'd you think of the production?
brilliant.
I loved that you turned a play about existential inertia into a referendum on feminine stereotypes.
I'm glad it spoke to you.
so, how'd it all end?
wait-- let me guess. Should we go?
no, let's stay. No, you stay.
okay, fine, I'll go.
there's a bar around the corner that doesn't card.
you guys want to check it out?
I'm sorry. Can you excuse us?
Yeah, yeah.
mellow out, I'm just joking around.
but you're not funny.
why, because I don't care about that dumbass play?
no, because I care about it, but you're too busy embarrassing me to give a damn.
right, I almost forgot what an idiot you think I am.
fine-- you're such a genius?
figure out your own way home.
you need a ride, Laurie?
that'd be great.
you mind if we make a detour to the north shore?
no problem.
well, you ladies wait here, and I'll "godot" get the car.
I'd head up to bed.
sorry about the dish.
dinner was terrific, by the way.
it was a disaster.
those people were a disaster.
dinner was great.
one of the best you ever made.
Really? - Yeah.
Hey, look...I guess I don't say it enough, how much I appreciate everything you do to make things so perfect all the time.
thank you.
so, why is it, no matter how hard I try, everything still seems to be falling apart around me?
everything's not falling apart.
I miss Susan.
then do something about it.
I'm not sure I know what to do.
what are you guys doing here?
uh, I... we just... I just, um...Janet wanted to, uh, drop off a pie for you.
at this hour?
I don't know what we were thinking.
obviously, I should have waited till morning.
well, good night.
Hey, fun night tonight.
Yeah, thanks for the ride.
Yeah, I'll call you, Susan.
good night, everyone.
your pie is on the stoop.
Janet, wait.
do you want to come in? I could make some decaf.
no, thank you.
Samantha, where are you?
home.
long ago, in ancient China, the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.
they brought great joy and prosperity to the city for they had invented fireworks.
but their son, Lord Shen, saw darker power in the fireworks.
what had brought colour and joy could also bring darkness and destruction.
shen's troubled parents consulted a soothsayer.
she foretold that if Shen continued down this dark path, he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white.
the young lord set out to change his fate.
but what he did next only sealed it.
shen returned to his parents full of pride.
but in their faces, he saw only horror.
he was banished from the city forever.
but Shen swore revenge.
someday he would return and all of China would bow at his feet.
it's almost done, Lord Shen, but We've run out of metal.
search the farthest villages! Find more metal!
china Will be mine.
and then the Dragon Warrior joined the Furious Five!
and they became the most awesomest kung fu team ever!
enough talk. Let's fight!
Thirty-three... - Listen, listen!
you can hear the Dragon Warrior training right now!
thirty-three. Stop him!
thirty-four. - It's too dangerous!
thirty-five. Stay focused. - Thirty-siX!
Thirty-seven! - Yeah!
how is he doing that With his face?
thirty-eight bean buns!
Yes! New record! You monster!
keep going! Hit 40! - He'll never hit 40.
you guys wait and we'll go to 40.
do it.
no problem!
Yeah!
give me a minute.
Yeah!
he did it! - Well done, Po!
your training has paid off.
master Shifu! Gotta go. See you later!
you'll save those for me, right?
Flippety-do.
inner peace.
inner peace.
inner peace.
master Shifu.
master Shifu, What do We got?
pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?
whatever it is, I will take them down. 'Cause I am in a mood.
I need to get something done, you know what I mean?
what are you doing?
one of Master OogWay's final teachings.
awesome!
how did you do that?
inner peace. - Inner peace. That's cool.
inner peace of what? - It is the next phase of your training.
every master must find his path to inner peace.
some choose to meditate for 50 years in a cave just like this...
...Without the slightest taste of food or water.
or?
some find it through pain and suffering, as I did.
Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior was the worst day of my life.
by far. Nothing else came close.
it was the worst, most painful, mind-destroying, horrible moment...
OK. ...I have ever experienced.
but once I realised the problem was not you, but within me,
I found inner peace and was able to harness the flow of the universe.
so that's it? I just need inner peace?
my innards are already super, super peaceful, so all I need to do is just get this thing going.
inner peace, you're going down.
now show me what you were doing there with your feet.
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...
Po! Bandits! Approaching the Musicians Village.
danger.
tell those musicians to start playing some action music because it is on.
don't Worry, Shifu, I'll master inner peace as soon as I get back.
no snack stops this time.
snack stops.
wait, are you serious?
get all the metal you can find!
grab the metal!
help, help, help, help. Help!
that's everything! Let's get out of here.
Oh, no.
wings of Justice!
the Dragon Warrior!
a panda? That's impossible.
my fist hungers for justice.
that was my... fist.
get 'em! - Come on!
take that!
Po! Incoming!
Thanks, Mantis!
Tigress, Double Death Strike!
feet of Fury!
Tigress! Monkey!
Viper! Mantis!
bunny! What?
Oh, sorry.
help!
crane, go! - I'm on it!
is everyone ok?
that was awesome!
I got this.
Po!
chew on that, tubby!
help.
sweetie, are you ok? - What happened?
I think I saw...
I think...
I gotta go.
thank you. Thank you for coming to Dragon Warrior Noodles and tofu.
more tea? Lemon sauce? - No.
if you need anything, just ask.
thank you. - Feet of Fury!
the Dragon Warrior's mop. He mopped these very floors!
no touching! You'll get the mop dirty.
he once waited on me. - Awesome!
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it. Hey. Where is the Dragon Warrior?
he doesn't work here any more.
he's busy out there protecting the Valley.
the Dragon Warrior! - There he is.
Po!
here. OK. Nice kid. - The Dragon Warrior!
should've told me you were coming. - Hi, Dad.
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.
dad, can I talk to you? - Of course, son.
in honour of my son, free tofu dessert for everybody!
with purchases.
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.
have you lost weight? I can almost put my wings around you.
Ah, well, maybe a little.
poor you, you must feel weak. Let me get you some soup.
no, that's OK, Dad. I'm not hungry.
not hungry? Po, are you all right?
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...
earlier today, I was fighting these bandits.
nothing too dangerous. I mean, they were just, you know...
yeah? - And then the strangest thing happened.
I had this crazy vision.
I think I saw my mom and me, as a baby.
mom? A baby?
dad? - What?
how do I say this?
where did I come from?
well, you see, son, baby geese come from a little egg.
don't ask where the egg comes from. - Dad, that's not what I meant.
I know it's not.
I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago.
OK.
you might have been kind of a...
...adopted.
I knew it. - You knew?
well, who told you? - No one. I mean, come on, Dad.
but if you knew, why didn't you ever say anything?
why didn't you say anything?
how did I get here, Dad? Where did I come from?
actually... you came from this.
it was just another day at the restaurant.
time to make the noodles.
I went out to the back, where my vegetables had just been delivered.
there were cabbages, turnips, radishes.
only there were no radishes.
just a very hungry baby panda.
there was no note.
of course, you could have eaten it.
I waited for someone to come looking for you, but no one did.
I brought you inside.
fed you.
gave you a bath.
and fed you again.
and again.
and tried to put some pants on you.
and then I made a decision that would change my life forever.
to make my soup without radishes.
and to raise you as my own son.
xiao Po, my little panda.
and from that moment on, both my soup and my life have been that much sweeter.
and, little Po, that's the end of the story.
look at me. No, don't look at me.
that's it? That can't be it. There's gotta be more, Dad!
well, there was the time you ate all my bamboo furniture.
it was imported, too.
one dumpling, please, Dragon Warrior size.
Oh, Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning, but look how it turned out.
you got me, you got kung fu, and you got noodles.
I know. I just have so many questions.
like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket?
why didn't I like pants?
and who am I?
good. Watch your form.
good.
better. Elbow.
straighten it out!
Shen?
good afternoon, gentlemen.
now we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house.
your house? - Yes.
didn't you see the peacock on the front door?
there you are, Soothsayer.
it seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.
we shall see, Shen. - No, you shall see, old goat.
where were we? - What do you want, Shen?
what is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!
Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council, and we will protect it. Even from you.
I'm so glad you feel that way.
otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing.
what's in the box, Shen?
you want to see? It's a gift.
it's your parting gift, in that it will part you.
part of you here, part of you there and part of you way over there, staining the wall!
you insolent fool!
show-off. - That is a warning.
you are no match for our kung fu.
I agree.
but this is.
are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City?
master thundering Rhino? - Yes.
son of legendary Flying Rhino? - Yes.
and slayer of the ten thousand Serpents in the Valley of Woe?
he's dead. - Whoa.
that's impossible.
Rhino's Horn Defence is impervious to any technique.
it Was no technique. Lord Shen has created a weapon, one that breathes fire and spits metal.
unless he is stopped, this could be the end of kung fu.
but I just got kung fu! - And now you must save it.
go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice!
OK, here we go! Here we go!
wait a second. How can I do this?
I mean, how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?
remember, Dragon Warrior, anything is possible when you have inner peace.
inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.
peace on.
Oh, Po? - Peace!
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.
I packed you food for weeks. Cookies, buns, vegetables.
and I even packed all your action figures. See?
I don't know what those are. Never seen them before in my life.
dad, you got scratches on my tigress.
I also packed your paintings of our best time together, just in case you get lonely.
that's me and you making noodles. And that's me and you eating noodles.
and that's me giving you a piggyback ride.
that cute? On second thought, I'll hang on to this one.
Hey, they're waiting for me. - Of course, of course.
you have a job to do... far from home, in a strange city, filled wth strange people, and strange noodles, facing horrible danger from which you might never return!
don't go, Po! - I gotta go.
I'm the Dragon Warrior. It's kind of my job to save kung fu.
and if I don't... What am I?
you're my son.
right?
Po, it's time. - Goodbye.
don't Worry, Mr. Ping.
he'll be back before you can say "noodles."
noodles.
come on, guys, let's go!
Yeah!
yeah...
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...
mama?
mom? Dad? Is that you?
mom! Dad!
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.
honey, What are you doing here?
but I thought...
we replaced you, dear, with this lovely radish.
radish? - It's quiet, polite, and, frankly, does better kung fu.
no. No, no, no.
wait!
no.
radish, radish, radish, radish.
inner pea...
pea...
inner peace.
inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
I'm... training.
the mast is not a worthy opponent.
I am ready. - OK.
so serious.
I think I prefer the mast.
apologies. I used to punch the ironwood trees by the palace to train.
now I feel nothing.
that's severely cool.
again!
so, this punching ironwood trees, how long did you have to do that?
twenty years. - Oh, 20, 20 years.
is there any, you know, faster way?
you know, until you, you know, don't feel anything?
no. Besides...
...I don't think hard style is your thing.
Po, why are you really out here?
I just found out that my dad isn't really my dad.
your dad? The goose.
that must have been quite a shock.
Yeah.
and this bothers you? - Are you kidding me?
we're warriors, right? Nerves of steel.
souls of platinum.
like you.
so hard-core, you don't feel anything.
I was... - So, what are you guys talking about?
nothing. Nothing.
Po's having daddy issues.
I'm so lucky. I don't have any problems with my dad.
maybe it's because Mom ate his head before I was born.
I don't know. - Mantis, this isn't about you.
Po is the one freaking out.
I'm not freaking out. - Po.
I'm freaking in. - Po!
what? - We're here.
Gongmen City.
my father's throne.
he used to let me play here beside him, promising someday, this throne would be mine.
a little to the left.
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!
thirty years I've waited for this moment.
everything must be exactly how I envisioned it.
and I envisioned it a little to the left.
perfect!
with the weapon by my si... A little bit more.
with the weapon by my side, all of China will bow before me.
we move out in three days,
when the moon is full and the tide is high.
now, you old goat, why don't you tell me my...
fortune?
future. I was going to say future.
look into your boWI and tell me What glory aWaits.
if you continue on your current path...
...you will find yourself at the bottom of the stairs.
I see...
I see...
I see pain... and anger.
how dare are you! That is the finest silk in the province!
followed by denial.
this is not fortune-telling. You're just saying - What's happening right... - Now?
the most important time is now.
but if you really want to see the future...
Oh, what do you see?
a peacock is defeated by a Warrior of black and White.v
nothing has changed.
that's impossible, and you know it.
it is not impossible, and he knows it.
who?
lord Shen! I saw a panda! - A panda?
a kung fu warrior. It fought like a demon!
big and furry.
soft and squishy. Kind of plush and cuddly.
there are no more pandas.
even with his poor eyesight, he can see the truth.
why is it that you cannot?
find this panda and bring him to me!
Yes, sir!
one panda lives. That does not make you right.
you're right. Being right makes me right.
then I will kill him and make you wrong.
will you stop that!
that must be Shen's palace on the other side of the city.
great. We'll march into the tower and proclaim, "We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five, and we are here to bring you to justice"!
what are you doing? This place is crawing with wolves.
Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face?
I do not like that guy.
we need to get to that tower without being spotted by those wolves.
got it. Stealth mode.
get out of the way! - Foiled again.
now, where'd those noodles go?
hello. I couldn't help but...
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?
Where's Po? - How can we lose a guy that big?
OK.
guys! Guys?
Hey, Po. - What? Sorry.
so that was stealth mode, huh?
to be honest, not one of my stronger modes.
...gold in there, come on!
this rice is raw!
you stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen!
either you cook my rice, or I cook you!
my apologies, but... - Po, do something.
how am I supposed to help her cook rice without getting caught?
wait, I have a better idea. ...two...
Hey. - Hey.
we're here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice.
you Will need help. - Thank you, brave sheep, but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.
Oh, no, not me. It's not safe to speak here.
right.
I'm talking about masters OX and Croc.
they're in Gongmen Jail on Black Dragon Alley.
what? They're still alive?
they must be in that jail gathering intelligence, hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon!
OK, let's go!
Thanks, sheep. - Hey! Stop that costume!
hold it right there! - Get them!
get them! - Sorry!
take that!
keep going! - Faster!
Hey, stop!
look out! Watch it! - Sorry!
surround him.
now!
gotcha!
what? Where'd he go?
spread out! Search everywhere! - What about over there?
is "there" a part of "everywhere"? - I... I guess.
then search there!
they must be close. I can feel a kung fu chill riding up my spine.
sorry, Po. It's just me.
look. Gongmen Jail.
Aw, it's cute.
cute, huh?
nice Work, Po.
at the first sign of trouble, I'll give you a signal.
you mean like Crane does? - Yeah.
excuse me, When have I ever made that noise?
master OX! Master!
the ferocious Master Croc!
and Master Storming OX.
I can't believe we're rescuing actual legends of kung fu.
we're gonna free you from those bonds of injustice. No problem.
gotta be a key around here. No, they wouldn't leave a key around here.
Oh, good! You found it. Come on, you guys! Yeah!
we're coming for you, Shen!
guys, are we going or not? Do you want to meet us there later?
I mean, you do want to take back your city, right?
of course we do.
but if we stand up to Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city.
listen to yourself. You're protecting Gongmen City by not protecting Gongmen City?
if we all fight together... - then the weapon would kill everyone.
Oh, Would it? Then we use... a sneak attack!
we get inside and then... - And then you Will be stopped by the unstoppable weapon.
nothing's unstoppable except for me when I'm stopping you from telling me something's unstoppable!
master OX, I'm not letting you stay in this cell.
I'd like to see you get me out!
you guys see that? It's called being awesome.
come on! Whatever happened to being heroes?
the only hero in this town is a dead one!
like I said, you are not getting me out of this cell!
Yes!
all right, let's go!
I get the top bunk.
it's time to surrender, panda. Kung fu is dead.
I...
you...
Kung fu is dead? Fine!
you stay in your prison of fear with bars made of hopelessness.
and all you get are three square meals a day of shame!
with despair for dessert.
we'll take on Shen and prove to all those who are hungry for justice and honour that kung fu still lives!
Yeah!
Monkey?!
you! You're mine!
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!
my fist in your plush, cuddly, super-soft face!
get him!
get me out of here! - Yes, sir!
stop him!
faster!
Yeah! Go, go!
lose him! - Yes, sir!
Viper! - Hang on!
what? - Watch out!
uncool! Very uncool!
try this!
guys, guys, guys!
maybe something smaller!
no, no! Oh, no, no.
cute bunnies, off the face. EXcuse me! OK, pardon me!
fire!
we've lost them.
again! Again!
crane, catch!
gotcha!
guys, guys, guys, guys, give me a shove!
mantis, now!
is that all you got? It feels like I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!
well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder!
your turn!
why... are... there... so... many... signs?!
come here! Alaka-squasho!
Yes! Taste the defeat!
let me tell you something.
next time you mess With a panda, you better bring a whole a...
guess nobody told you, if you mess with the wolf, you get the fangs.
I've hit you twice. What are you going to do now?
we surrender!
you can chain my body, but you will never chain my... warrior spirit.
Hey, don't forget the little guy. - Did you just call?
Po, What are you doing? - Trust me. I got a pl...
no Way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?
just like the ones that held tai Lung. The more you move, the tighter they get.
these are the best cuffs!
greetings, panda. At last we meet!
no, no, no...
we meet at last! Yes, that's it.
greetings, panda. We meet at...
you are afraid for a reason. - I am not afraid.
he is coming to me in chains.
if anyone should be afraid, it's... - You.
don't even think about it.
I hope this turns out better than your plan to cook rice in your stomach by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water.
this plan's nothing like that plan.
how? - 'Cause this one's going to work.
keep moving.
Ah, my old enemy...
...stairs.
thanks for carrying me those last few flights. OK.
I threw up a little bit on the third floor.
someone might want to clean that up.
is there some sort of evil janitor or something?
greetings, panda.
we meet at... - Hey, how are you ?
Hey.
you've grown up bigger than I thought.
hey... enough with the poking around.
strong. Healthy.
look, I don't know Who you are, but please stand aside, sir.
that's a lady. - Oh! Sorry.
the beard threw me. It's kind of misleading.
false advertising. - Enough of this nonsense!
bring the prisoners to me.
sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.
keep your eyes peeled for the... weapon!
sparrow kick!
we did it! I just kung fued it! Did you guys see that? I was all like...
do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me?
I do not. I know he is.
Oh, look at him. A lifetime to plot his revenge - and he comes to me on his knees. - What? A lifetime?
I did not have a lifetime.
we only heard about Master Rhino a few days ago, - and we came to avenge him! - You've come to avenge nothing else?
well, yeah. All the pots and pans that you stole.
I'm gonna want those back. - Nothing else?
you probably did some other evil stuff along the way. I don't know.
what else did you do? - You don't know?
know what? What's so funny?
the very thing that you clearly do not know!
OK, enough of these riddles! Would you guys spill the beans?
first, we come in and the weapon is tiny. Surprise, it's big.
and then the lady over here, I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...
the only reason you are still alive is that I find your stupidity mildly amusing.
well, thank you. But I find your evilness extremely annoying.
who do you think you are, panda?
who do you think I am, peacock?
why are we laughing?
take aim.
fire.
well, light the thing!
I did!
fear the bug!
get the weapon!
Tigress!
you... You were there.
Yes. Yes, I was.
you just let Shen get away! - At least we destroyed the weapon.
fire!
Oh. No, he's got way more.
my wing! - Help, Po!
coming!
watch out! - Po!
help me up! - No. Get him down.
use the ropes.
run, run, little panda!
Po, come on. We need you to focus! - I got it, I got it!
bring it down!
we're trapped! - This way!
goodbye!
fire!
get back!
the only way out is up.
what?
follow me! Come on!
where are they going?
to the top! - Come on! Keep going!
here we go!
you idiot! - My nose!
call in the wolves! All of them! I Want them ready to move!
the year of the Peacock begins now!
right now? 'Cause it's the middle of the year, so you'd only get like a half of the Year of the Peacock.
and this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock.
happy New Year, sir.
get the wolves ready. We're loading the ships now.
now!
now, now, now, now, now!
move! Move, move, move, move!
this way.
let's go.
Oh, you!
what did you do? It's chaos up there.
what happened to stopping Shen?
Yeah.
guys, come on. Give me a little credit.
I meant for him to get away.
cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.
I was thinking... I'll figure out his plot more.
that makes no sense.
what do you mean? Sure it does.
Po, the truth. You had Shen. What happened?
what are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about.
I... Yeah... OK, he caught me off guard.
the truth.
fine. They will keep you far from danger.
real far. - What?
you're staying here.
wait! I have to go ba...
you're staying here!
I'm going. And you can't stop me.
OK. I wasn't ready that time.
guys? Don't.
ready.
look!
stay down.
I have to get to him. - Then tell me why!
he was there! OK?
the peacock was there the last time I saw my parents.
he knows what happened. Where I came from.
who I am.
look, I'm going.
I have to know.
the hard core can't understand.
Tigress, no!
the hard core do understand.
but I can't watch my friend be killed.
we're going. - Maybe you can't watch me be killed?
stop being a wimp. - And she's back.
no. - Don't worry, kid.
you're better off here.
you were wrong, Soothsayer. We sail to victory tonight.
your magic panda is clearly a fool.
are you certain it is the panda who is a fool?
you just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen.
a trivial sacrifice... when all of China is my reWard.
then will you finally be satisfied?
will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?
it's a start. I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.
the cup you choose to fill has no bottom.
it is time to stop this madness.
why on earth would I do that?
so your parents can rest in peace.
my parents hated me.
do you understand?
they wronged me... and I will make it right.
they loved you.
they loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.
the dead exist in the past... and I must tend to the future.
set the soothsayer free. She's no use to me.
goodbye, Shen. I wish you happiness.
happiness must be taken.
and I will take mine.
hurry it up! - Move it!
if all of those weapons leave the building, China will fall.
we bring down the building. - Hey, guys. How about this?
this will work! - All right, let's go.
I can't feel my face.
did you hear him call it Year of the Peacock?
Hey. - Hey.
OK. So, keep it cool. Keep it cool. Keep it cool.
you! Where are you going?
on your feet! And Wipe those stupid grins off your faces.
move, you dogs! Faster, faster! Load them all!
greetings, panda.
tell me What happened that night. - What night?
that night. - Ah, that night.
Yes! We're talking about the same night, right?
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched as your parents abandoned you.
it's a terrible thing. I believe it went something like this.
here's your New Year's gift.
hope you like it, 'cause you can't return it.
Po? What's he doing here?
return it! Return it!
are you willing to die to find the truth?
you bet I am. Although I'd prefer not to.
we got them. Go!
you looking for me?
I said that too soon, didn't I?
Po!
Po, get away from him.
I'll get up. Here We go.
no more running, Shen. - So it seems.
now... ansWers.
Oh, you want to know so badly.
you think knowing will heal you, huh?
fill some crater in your soul?
well, here's your answer.
your parents didn't love you.
but here...
...Let me heal you!
No!
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.
if I wanted you dead, I would have left you in that river.
well, why save me? - So you can fulfil your destiny.
what are you talking about? Where am I?
what is this place?
I'm surprised you remember so little.
but you were so little when it happened.
perhaps you do remember.
what? It's just a stupid nightmare.
nightmare? Or memory?
this was a thriving village.
young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.
but he wanted more.
I foretold that someone would stand in his way. A panda.
but I never could have foretold what came next.
get them all!
take our son and run away! Go!
stop fighting. Let it flow.
your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are.
it is the rest of your story.
who you choose to be.
so, who are you, panda?
I am Po.
and I'm gonna need a hat.
such sad, sad faces.
but now is a time only for joy.
you are going to be part of something beautiful.
once we reach the harbour, in front of all the world, you and your precious kung fu will die.
then China will know to bow before me.
set sail!
what is that?
honestly, guys, I never thought I'd die like this.
I always thought I'd meet a nice girl and settle down and...
...then she'd eat my head.
so sad. - We cannot give up hope.
Po would want us to remain strong. Hard-core. Right, tigress?
lord Shen, What about the bridge? - Nothing stands in my way.
fire!
you coward!
Po?
Po?
how many times do I have to kill the same stinking panda?
Shen!
a panda stands between you and your destiny.
what?
prepare yourself for a hot serving of justice.
your reign of terror comes to an end.
what? - And now, free the Five!
disc of Destruction!
OK. Take aim!
ready?
you can't follow me.
just get him!
Yeah. Here we go. - Come on!
no, no, no, don't shoot! - Don't shoot!
no, don't shoot!
don't shoot! - Don't shoot!
you don't shoot! - I won't shoot if you won't shoot.
Yeah!
don't shoot! Cross fire! - Attack!
catch of Freedom! - Monkey!
Lmpressive, Dragon Warrior. What's your plan?
step one, free the five. - What's step two?
honestly, I didn't think I'd make it this far.
Po!
stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.
nice!
viper, Puppet of Death!
Tigress!
master OX! - Jump!
and Croc! - Vengeance is served.
why did you? - Your friend there is very persuasive.
master Shifu!
quickly. Use their boats to block the way.
Crane!
wings of Justice!
Yeah!
what?
I love you guys.
why aren't we firing?
they're taking out our gunners, sir. They're getting close.
fire! Fire at them!
but, sir, We'll kill our own. - I said fire at them!
fire!
no.
Po!
Tigress?
as you wish.
let's finish this.
fire!
inner peace.
again!
Yeah!
kill him! Somebody kill him!
what? No. No!
keep firing! Keep firing!
how did you?
how did you do it?
you know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose.
not that. How did you find peace?
I took away your parents. Everything.
I scarred you for life.
see, that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal.
no, they don't. Wounds heal.
Oh, yeah. What do scars do? They fade, I guess?
I don't care what scars do. - You should, Shen.
you gotta let go of that stuff from the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.
the only thing that matters is What you choose to be now.
you're right.
then I choose... this!
that was pretty hard-core.
Po! - You did it!
come here! Yeah! - Don't ever do that again, please.
it seems you have found inner peace.
and at such a young age.
well, I had a pretty good teacher.
what do you mean he's not here? It's my son's birthday.
all he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior.
how about some tofu birthday cake instead, huh?
you know, I think we'll just try again another time.
when do you think he'll be back?
I don't know. OK, I don't know. Maybe never.
I mean, I worry, OK? But that's my job, I'm his dad.
at least, I was his dad.
why did he have to go and save China? I know Why.
but why? He's just one little panda.
so, how did it go? Did you save China?
Yep.
well, I knew you would.
that's why I had new signs made.
my son saved China. You, too, can save.
buy one dumpling, get one free.
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.
would you like to try one? - Maybe later.
there's something I should tell you.
while I was gone, I found the village where I was born.
I found out how I ended up in that radish basket.
you did?
I know who I am. - You do?
I'm your son.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, son.
delicious, fat radishes!
you're probably hungry. Let me make you something to eat.
what are you talking about? I'll cook.
no, no, I'll cook. - Dad!
well, it's the least I can do. You saved China.
no, it's the least I can do. You raised me.
Po. - Dad.
Po! - OK.
let's both cook. Together.
together.
you weren't followed?
no.
better come in.
trust no one, Jim.
especially not in the mainstream.
sit down.
I understand you still have one Hungarian identity running?
I do.
I want you to go to Budapest.
this is not above board.
nobody else knows.
they're after my head, Jim boy.
do you understand?
I have had an offer of service.
I would like you to meet him.
he has some information that I need, Jim.
what information?
treasure.
he has the name of the mole the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service right at the top of the Circus.
there's a rotten apple, Jim.
we have to find it.
and porkolts. You know porkolts?
Yes, I've had it.
it's very good. Better than goulash.
but you won't get it in Budapest now.
Why's that?
all the pigs have gone to Moscow!
when will I meet your friend?
he will turn up any moment now...
would you excuse me for a moment?
stop!
stop! Stop the operation!
what the hell are you doing there? Secure the street exit.
put your gun away!
you fucking Hungarian amateurs.
I told you, secure the street exit!
look at what you've done, idiots!
why are you all moving? Stay in your positions.
we wanted him alive!
would you witness this for me?
I wish I could done more, Control.
you did all you could, Percy.
well, a man should know when to leave the party.
what about Smiley?
smiley is leaving with me.
you little prick, Esterhase.
gentlemen, shall we start?
under Secretary Lacon is ready for you, Sir Percy.
the Treasury don't understand.
why can't the intelligence service simply put in a request for a general increase in funding and then you account for the spend on your special operation?
operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.
it's a fiefdom of its own
Yes, that's what's worrying us.
the whole thing's very unaccountable, isn't it?
and this London house that nobody knows the address of, is that really necessary?
now more than ever. We need to protect our Soviet source.
so where do you propose we meet? In a caf?
the rent and rates on this house have doubled.
we spent millions on nuclear warheads.
we're asking for a few thousand for a house.
I wonder if Karla has the same problem with the Treasury at the Kremlin.
look, nobody underestimates the importance of the job you chaps are doing.
but what happened in Budapest last year, that was a disaster.
with respect, sir, it wasn't one of your civil servants that got killed, was it?
now this isn't about soldiers in trenches any more.
we're the front line now... Roy!
for 25 years we've been the only thing standing between them and Karla and Moscow and the third bloody world war.
look, the Minister's very pleased with your progress so far.
he's less pleased, though, with the lack of progress with our American cousins.
you see, in their eyes, you're still a leaky ship.
yes?
someone on the line for you, sir. Seems urgent.
all right, well put him through.
Hello? Is this under Secretary Lacon?
Yes.
my name's Ricki Tarr.
what do you want? I need to meet you.
if you need to confirm who I am, you can talk to my boss at the Circus,
Peter Guillam
but only Guillam, no one else.
you got clearance for that?
well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.
mind you, probably no better off in here with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.
they'd have the gold out of your teeth.
thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse of the new girl...
before Bland gets to her.
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.
has he seen her yet? Of course he has.
came down first thing this morning.
Belinda.
Peter Guillam
Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.
just ringing to find out...
in one occasion Winston Churchill actually saved your life, Edie.
I was working in the kitchen, getting dinner ready.
and he was late, you see.
during a raid? During a raid, you see.
he said, "Why aren't you in that shelter?
why weren't you? Well, because...
I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr Smiley.
he said Tarr called him from a phone box.
he said there's a mole, right at the top of the Circus, that he's been there for years.
it does mean you're rather well placed to look into this matter for us now, doesn't it?
outside the family.
I'm retired, Oliver.
you fired me.
the thing is, some time ago before Control died, he came to me with a similar suggestion.
that there is a mole.
he never mentioned his suspicions to you?
no.
Oh, I just thought that as you were his man, so to speak... What did you say to him?
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had rather gotten the better of him and he was going to pull his whole house down.
that bloody mess in Budapest.
damn it, George.
it's your generation, your legacy.
I would have thought, if there's any truth in it, you'd want to...
I'll keep Peter.
and there's a retired Special Branch man, Mendel.
I should like to have him.
lift up.
and quickly down again.
there's a place I know, sir.
a little hotel near Liverpool Street.
be careful with it. Please. It's Georgian.
my friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work,
Mrs Pope Graham.
no disturbances.
her real name is just Graham.
added the Pope for a touch of class.
Peter, did you get the keys to Control's flat?
# And did those feet in ancient time #
# Walk upon England's mountains green #
George!
George, get in here!
George.
sit down.
take a look at this nonsense.
report by Soviet high command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea.
just what the admiralty has been begging us for some information on.
where did you get this? I didn't.
Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.
look, Control... Shut up.
style appalling.
patently a fabrication from beginning to end.
just could be the real thing
well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.
but its topicality makes it suspect.
smiley is suspicious, Percy.
where did it come from? What's the access?
a new secret source of mine.
but how could he possibly have access?
he has access to the most sensitive levels of policy-making.
we've named the operation Witchcraft.
Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.
gone straight to the minister.
Percy has been allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret.
the minister agrees too many secrets are blown around here.
too much failure, too many scandals.
too little solid intelligence
Percy does have a point, Control.
we should be fighting Communism, not each other.
meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners.
your bloody Yanks!
we've had enough! There's going to be changes.
we need to decide if we want to be part of the past or part of the future.
I should have left you where I found you.
look! Control...
out, all of you!
if Witchcraft is genuine...
nothing is genuine any more.
George...
do you want me to get this stuff over to the hotel?
thank you. Er, anywhere will do.
Peter? Hm?
I need you to do something for me.
I'd like you to go to the Circus.
in the cabinet at the duty officers station are records of staff recently retired.
I'd like photographs of them and of the diagram of the Circus's reorganisation under Percy Alleline, along with a list of all payments made from the Reptile fund.
there is a cafe on the corner at the Albert Hall.
Yes. At quater to four.
no, I don't have time for that.
I know...
I know what it looks like.
help you with anything, Bill?
I was just looking for his Majesty.
well, he's out walking the battlements.
much obliged.
heard you had an accident, Peter
Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.
when are you going to get some new furniture up here?
I'll have a word with Esterhase.
we'll make it a priority on the top floor.
where are you off to? Lunch.
want some company?
according to the personnel files, seven were due for retirement anyway.
another four don't seem particularly mysterious.
Jerry Westerby was dismissed December 4.
Connie Sachs retired November 28.
that's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.
return to Oxford, please
that's 1. 15.
Percy has always resisted any proposal of a wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.
drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.
I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies so far, Minister.
greedy boy.
my goal has been to establish its track record beyond all doubt.
I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in-arms.
will they take us back into bed?
I'm not interested in a one-off trade.
I want on-going access to American intelligence.
you think we can get it?
with Witchcraft on our side, we can get anything we bloody well want.
fine.
carry on.
thank you.
and I strike thee down...
Oh, I, er...
not supposed to. Doctor's orders.
wicked, wicked George.
I don't know about you, George, but I feel seriously under-fucked.
I heard Ann left you again.
she doesn't deserve you, George, not one hair on your head.
you left the Circus shortly after I retired.
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.
chucked out on the rubbish heap, like you.
Why?
Polyakov.
do you remember him?
from the Soviet Embassy?
Alexsey Polyakov, cultural attach here in London.
when he arrived here 15 years ago, I requested he be checked out.
he was graded whiter than white. Didn't put a foot wrong.
but you disagreed?
there's a story you must have heard that Karla has set up a secret cell.
the personnel are all ex-military, trained to handle deep-penetration agents, moles.
there are always stories, Connie.
but what if this story was true?
one night in research I saw something, George.
there was our friend Polyakov at a May day parade in Berlin receiving a salute.
why would you salute a cultural attach?
exactly. Unless he was a war veteran himself.
and if he was, why hide the fact?
what did you do?
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.
here.
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood if ever I saw one.
if he's here, it must be because he's running a mole.
you're to leave Polyakov alone.
you're becoming obsessed with him.
you're losing your sense of proportion But that's ridiculous.
perhaps it's time you went out into the real world.
here we are.
the Nursery in our day.
Jim Prideaux.
and Bill Haydon. Together, of course.
the Inseparables.
there's Control himself.
all my boys.
all my lovely boys.
that was a good time, George.
it was the war, Connie
a real war.
englishmen could be proud then.
so I was right, then?
about Polyakov.
there is a mole.
if it's bad, don't come back.
I want to remember you all as you were.
Percy? Percy, did you mix this?
aye, I did so.
you Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.
can you nae learn to take a bloody order?
nobody tampers with the recipe!
I followed the recipe Come on.
it'll take us five hours to get drunk on this monkey's piss.
# He's not the first #
# He's not the first Oh, well. #
# He's the second best secret agent #
merry Christmas.
# In the whole wide world #
# He's not number one #
# But not the worst #
# He's just the second best secret agent #
# In the whole wide world #
# He's every bit #
# As good as what's-his-name #
# With a dame #
# Any dame #
# And all those bullet holes are in his vest #
# To prove you work a little harder #
# When you're second best... #
the day after Nikita Khrushchev's resignation:
he is at home. Suddenly the telephone rings.
silence...
Hello? I am listening..." Slience.
speak! I am listening!
the reply is: "You should have listened a long time ago, dear.
courtesy of Mrs P Hm?
you been up all night?
Yes.
what's this?
request for 1, 000 in cash from the Reptile fund.
to a Mr Ellis.
it was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.
Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.
october 21.
so why was someone giving him 1, 000 two months later?
I wonder where he is then, sir.
Where's that bloody car? We can't lose him. Move it.
settle down now.
hand those out Sir.
what is it? The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?
the bells, the bells!
je m'appelle monsieur Ellis.
come here.
what's your name?
roach, Bill Roach, sir.
I'm a new boy New arrival, eh?
what's the story? My mother and father.
my father left, so...
bill.
the unpaid Bill.
anyone ever call you that? No, sir.
known a lot of Bills in my time.
they've all been gooduns.
what are you good at?
nothing, sir.
you're a good watcher, though, eh?
us loners always are.
best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet.
long as he's got his specs on. Right?
Yes, sir.
this is good, very good.
Hello, Ricki.
you've missed the wedge.
where have you been, Ricki?
they're going to kill me.
who is? Your lot.
or their lot. Whoever gets me first.
I'm innocent.
within reason.
how long have you been here?
sorry, I've run out of places now.
I needed to see you.
Why?
there's a woman.
I need you to trade for her. I need you to get her back off Karla.
a woman?
her name's Irina.
this was last November.
mr Guillam sent me to Istanbul to check out a Russian trade delegate who might be persuaded to defect.
Tufty Thesinger, resident Yeah.
Hiya, Ricki All right, mate?
did you know him? No, never met him.
bit of a drinker.
hangover from hell.
bit of a fucking idiot.
apparently this Russian, name of Boris, was spending high and wide in the nightclubs.
so you were sent to persuade this Boris?
Yeah. He was your typical Russian.
trade delegation by day, out boozing every night.
didn't seem to sleep.
Tufty was worn out from following him around.
I think it's going to be a long night, son.
his favourite haunt was this club in Taksim.
it had a hellhole in the basement where the sailors and the tourists went.
anyway, I took one look at him and I knew I'd wasted a journey.
boris was no delegate.
what delegate bothers to play drunker than he really is?
you get to recognise your own, don't you, Mr Smiley?
boris was hook.
moscow Centre trained.
# Someone is waiting #
# I mean just for you #
# Spinning wheel #
# Keep on spinning through, Drop all your troubles... #
I guessed he was waiting for a connect.
working a letterbox, maybe.
or trailing his coat and looking for a pass from some mug like me.
so the second night I went to the importexport outfit that Tufty had set up with a cipher room hidden in the back.
I cabled "No sale" to Mr Guillam.
and that was that.
you were due to fly home the next day.
Yes.
but you didn't.
boris had a wife.
Common-law.
apparently she was a member of the delegation in her own right.
you once told me to trust my instincts about women,
mr Smiley.
well, my instincts told me this woman had some treasure.
when Boris went out for the night,
I found myself going into her hotel.
so you dropped Boris.
I know. It was breaking protocol.
but I was acting on my own initiative, as it were.
your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?
I just wanted to make sure you were all right, OK?
so you didn't come home?
I would have.
boris was a dead end, but...
I could...
I could sense something in her.
a secret.
and how did you intend to get this secret out of her?
I played this businessman, Michael Trench.
holiday romance.
I thought I'd take my time with it.
I know who you are.
I want to talk to your boss.
control.
I have something to trade.
something big.
I want a new life in the West.
that's the deal.
you tell them.
look, you can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.
if you won't tell me more, there is nothing I can do.
if I tell you everything,
I'm putting my life in your hands.
and the lives of other people.
so she told me what she had to trade.
her secret.
I mean, the mother of all secrets.
I told her I'd alert the Circus.
she made me promise I wouldn't give any of the details to London.
and you agreed? Yes.
I mean it was...
I couldn't believe I'd got hold of something this big.
I went back to the importexport, sent the message to the Circus, graded, "Flash, highest priority," just that I had a Moscow-trained hood wanting to defect.
you're supposed to have gone. London stations have been on to me.
want to know what the hell you're doing.
fuck off.
anything else, Ricki?
I know what I am to the Circus. I'm one of the scalp-hunters, someone that you can hand your dirty little jobs to.
I just...
I just wanted to bring this one in myself.
well, I understand how you felt.
you wanted to do something.
I said that she claim to have information
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.
anything more?
I said that she had information concerning a double agent.
look, I just wanted to get the proper attention.
and I'd...
I told them this was the reason why I had not come home.
it wasn't that I'd defected or anything.
what did you do then? I waited for a reply.
I hung around for hours.
I heard the lmsak call to prayer.
so what's that? That's about 3: 30 in the morning.
then the message comes through.
we read you.
that was all they sent. Nothing.
it didn't make sense. It was like they were stalling.
then what happened?
then, all of a sudden...
the Russians begin to move.
it was nice work. I couldn't have done it better myself.
the message was quite clear. I needed to warn her.
Hassan... can I use your phone?
Yeah, you can use that one.
come on, come on, come on.
I couldn't find her at the airport.
I even looked through all the flight lists and...
I headed down to the harbour.
they put her on a ship to Odessa.
that's all I know.
I've...
I've done a lot of things in my life, Mr Smiley, but...
I just... I can't stop thinking about her.
she wasn't even my type.
I've got to get her out. I owe her that.
Karla will be looking for you.
everybody's looking for me.
you can't stay here.
it isn't safe.
and I said, "You may fuck me but you'll call me 'Sir' in the morning.
OK. Just need to let you know.
someone flew into Paris last week on one of our escaped passports.
And? lt was Ricki Tarr.
why are you telling me?
it could be coincidence but...
you are a poisoned dwarf, Toby.
why don't you fuck off to his Majesty and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?
mr Esterhase: "It could be coincidence but...
mr Haydon interrupting.
you really are a poisoned dwarf, Toby.
why don't you fuck off to his Majesty
and stop trying to involve me in your cabaret?"'
you look tired.
I didn't sleep well.
you're going to do something for me, Peter.
I need the duty officer's log book for last November.
I'm going to have to send you up a floor into the lions den.
if you're caught, you can't mention me.
I'm sorry, but you're alone.
last November? Hm.
mr Guillam!
thank you, Bryant. How's the family?
fine. Need to go up to the registry today.
OK, sir.
now you'll need a yellow one for the bag, sir.
thank you.
good morning, Mr Guillam
morning, Alwyn.
want me to look after that for you? Thank you.
I'll need your chit, Mr Guillam.
dolphin will kill me if I don't. New rules.
so, chit me.
Thanks.
Sal, lovely surprise Peter.
what are you up to this weekend? Oh, you know.
visiting aunts. I'll bet.
corridor D.
the two eights are halfway on your right.
the three ones are next alcove down.
Thanks.
here's a request from Libby Barr from Bromley for "Mr Wu's A Window Cleaner Now." Take it away, George.
hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.
can I speak to Mr Guillam, please?
I'm his car mechanic.
well, I'll just see if he's available. Hold on, please.
# Mr Wu, what shall I do? #
Oh, Christ! Telephone, sir.
who is it? Outside line, sir. Someone rough.
sir?
Hello? Your gearbox is bust, sir.
damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?
can't be done, sir.
need a new gearbox.
well, phone the main dealership first, will you?
have you got their number?
no.
hang on. Alwyn!
alwyn Sir?
get me my bag, will you?
but... Just for a second.
thank you.
hang on.
Hello? I'm listening.
Yes. 9-4-6-0-3-3-5
be right on it, sir.
thank you.
Peter Guillam.
what a way to travel, eh? Barbaric.
horseless carriage, that's the way.
l've seen them myself, you know. Paris, London.
London. That's where my business is, buying and selling.
the fact is, l got these on my last stop here. Karlsburg.
pretty, isn't it?
six crowns it cost in Karlsburg.
l can let you have one for three.
two crowns, then. l can't go any lower.
Oh, well.
give.
sorry. -Give me.
l should do as he says.
one crown, then?
No!
God.
Oh, my God.
Dracula's blood.
where is that girl? Alice!
Yes, Father. -All right, dear?
lt's a brisk morning, Father.
lndeed, Jeremy.
lsn't Alice's hat pretty, Mother? lt's a pretty color, don't you think?
come along now.
Mr. Hargood. -Thank you, Vicar.
this was a very nice sermon. -Did you think so? l hadn't planned it.
Mr. Secker, good day.
excellent service. -Mr. Paxton.
hello. -Hello.
the Allens are having a party on Friday. -l know, and l haven't been invited.
you will be.
when shall l see you?
l don't know.
you will stay here, Alice.
you will apologize to your mother and l for your behavior.
thank you. You may go. -For what behavior?
you will apologize, then go up to your room and stay there.
do you understand? -No, l don't understand
you know perfectly well what l'm talking about.
mother, l don't understand
you were smiling and flirting with that young man.
but that was Paul, Father.
l don't care. He is still a young man and you are a young woman.
a sexually mature young woman.
l will not have you displaying yourself in that provocative manner.
lt's because it was Paul, isn't it?
you've never liked him, but he can't help that.
but you can help behaving like a harlot.
Papa ! -A harlot in God's house!
Oh, my God.
blasphemy will only make it worse.
lt's only natural in a young girl, William.
lunch will soon be ready, William.
you may send hers up on a tray.
and her supper, too.
Yes, dear. -l shall not, of course, be in to supper.
but l asked Cook to bake a ham the way you like it.
l am never in to supper the last Sunday in the month.
surely you know that by now. -Yes, of course.
your charity work in the East End. -Exactly.
don't judge your father too harshly, my dear.
l know just how you feel.
do you, Mother?
well, of course l do, darling.
l was young like you once, you know.
young and excited by the prospect of my life before me.
until you met him.
he crushed you, didn't he? He crushed the life right out of you.
you mustn't say such things.
well, he's not going to do it to me.
you're upset. -With good reason.
mother, why does he hate Paul so?
l've honestly no idea. No idea at all.
ls it something to do with Paul's father? -Mr. Paxton?
l don't see how it can be. They scarcely know one another.
bit late tonight, Hargood.
l am exactly on time, Paxton.
exactly on time as usual, gentlemen.
l thought we were a little late, Secker.
hot potatoes.
sir!
this way, gentlemen. -We know the way.
well, what have we here?
Veronica, you look delightful. Nice to see you again.
such a pleasure to see you again, gentlemen.
punctual to the minute, as always.
l have your usual room ready for you, of course.
l hope the entertainment isn't too usual, Felix.
no, l've selected something most diverting for you gentlemen tonight.
l'm sure it will amuse you.
l've been getting a bit bored with it.
you won't be bored tonight, l can assure you of that.
l think it's best if you leave it all to me...
because l know the girls who are really clean, if you get my meaning.
some of the girls sent to me, they've no idea.
straight into a hot bath they go, and do they scream !
they don't want to be seen without their clothes on.
l told them there's no point being shy in a place like this.
here we are, gentlemen.
everything is ready, as you see.
here, let me take that for you. Thank you.
that's right. You can't be too careful, can you? Thank you.
here, let me.
well done. -Thank you, Felix.
sir, there. -Thank you.
gentlemen, may l be permitted to say, " To your health " ?
and now, if you will excuse me, l'll just go and...
well, you know.
Paxton? -Yes, all right.
Secker? -l don't think so.
gentlemen. -To your health.
ready when you are, gentlemen.
Oh, my goodness.
why don't you stop pushing your way in here and upsetting everyone?
you're not wanted here.
for God's sake, will you please go away and stay away?
do you hear me?
Oh, darling. -Sorry.
no, not in here. l do beg your pardon.
No!
you can't go...
you are not going in there. Don't you dare try to go in there.
they're some of my best gentlemen in there.
Bravo!
now, look here.
yes? -You can't come in here.
but l have.
who's going to pay?
my girls aren't free for any Tom, Dick, or Harry, you know.
good heavens.
lmpudent young puppy.
l can't tell you how sorry l am. l can't begin to tell you.
Yes. Well, get rid of these girls.
no, Mr. Hargood, l've got another lovely girl for you.
get rid of them. -Yes, of course. Come now, girls.
that's a girl. That's it.
who is he?
an impudent rascal, that's what.
Yes, who is he?
he's young Courtley. Lord Courtley, sir.
you must remember.
his father disowned him several years ago...
cut him off without a shilling.
found him celebrating black mass in the family chapel.
very nasty, it was.
so that's young Courtley. -Yes, terrible scandal it was.
how does he live? Does he work?
him? Never a stroke.
then how? -They keep him.
what, the girls pay him?
Yes, they're fascinated by him. He's the very devil himself.
lf l were religious, l would say he was possessed.
possessed of the devil.
young man.
lord Courtley.
do l know you?
of course, l took your woman from you.
lf it's to be swords or pistols, l have neither.
my friends and l would like to take you to supper.
Why? -We want to talk to you.
about? -Over supper.
very well.
driver-- -The Cafe Royal, driver.
lt's the only place.
may l come in, dear? -Yes, Mother.
all ready for bed, dear? -Just getting ready.
you've hardly eaten a thing, dear. -l wasn't hungry.
mother.
l'm so sorry for you.
because l didn't eat my supper? -You know it isn't that.
l know it isn't, Mother.
don't worry, please.
good night, darling.
good night, Mother.
then let me explain it for you.
you and your two friends here have formed a little society...
with the objects of enjoying the more unusual aspects of this life.
ls that right?
that is quite right.
ls that right?
well, l hardly-- -l wouldn't put it like that.
and having tried everything that your narrow imaginations can suggest...
you're bored to death with it all, right?
to suggest alternatives?
that's it exactly. -Just how far are you willing to go?
for instance, would you be willing to sell your souls to the devil?
what exactly do you mean?
l mean exactly what l say:
sell your souls to the devil.
l don't know. -Then we're wasting time.
lf one thought that one's experience might be extended
lt would be extended to infinity.
what would we have to do?
first you will need money. -Yes, l thought as much.
no, not for me. To buy something that we shall need for the ceremony.
what is it we have to buy? -And how much?
l will show you.
who else did you expect?
don't be silly. Wait a moment and l'll come down.
lf you don't, l'm coming up.
don't you dare.
come on, monkey. -You'll wake them up.
Alice, nothing but good news. -What?
my uncle Harry will lend me the money. l can go into business on my own.
so, my darling, there's absolutely nothing to stop us getting away.
so when is it to be? This week? Tomorrow?
Really？
you don't mean that, do you?
mean it? -About tomorrow?
what's to stop us?
well, l can't just leave them.
not like that. -Why not?
you've told me often enough how he treats you...
how you long to get away. He'll never agree to let us meet any other way.
but my mother... -She married him, didn't she?
she chose to be his wife.
she's also my mother.
l can't just run away and leave her.
l see.
so it was all just talk, about our going away.
no, it wasn't just all talk, Paul.
l love you, really l do.
l've said l want to marry you and l do.
l want it more than anything in this world.
and if it was anything else...
lf l left her, Paul, l think she'd die.
so what are we going to do?
l don't know.
Paul, never stop loving me. Never.
where are you, Weller?
who wants me?
lt's you, is it?
come on out, you old fool. We've business to discuss.
what sort of business can you have with me?
l want to buy, Weller.
you? Buy?
buy what? -You know what.
lt's not for sale.
you'll sell anything for money. -Money? What money?
would you please tell us what this is all about?
quite. -You say the price, Weller.
more than you can afford. -Granted.
but it's these gentlemen who are buying.
what's that? -Buying what exactly?
ls it true?
you want to buy? -Possibly...
if we knew what it was we're supposed to be buying.
don't you know? -No.
show them, Weller.
the master.
Courtley, what is all this about?
a concentration of evil, my dear sirs. -A what?
these pieces belong to the most evil man of all time:
count Dracula.
you'll know that l tell the truth when l so describe him:
his cloak, his signet ring...
his clasp.
and his blood. -His blood?
his blood.
but it's just powder.
that's right, gentlemen. lt's only powder.
No!
these relics will enable us to perform the ceremonies l spoke about.
l'm asking you to buy them. -Just on your word?
just on my word!
l see.
what is the price?
1, 000 guineas.
what? -You'll never regret it, l swear.
l swear in his name.
for all we know
do l take it that you do not want to remain in the circle?
no.
very well.
we'll pay the price.
you will be repaid a thousand times.
and may the devil take good care of you.
lt's this way.
there it is.
my God, l don't like this. -Do you want to leave?
no, of course not. -Then keep quiet.
what's that? -Keep quiet.
there's someone there.
there's something there.
of course l'm here.
did you not expect me to be here?
that was a damned fool thing to do. -Possibly, but it amused me.
you have the casket? -Yes.
let's not waste any more time. Bring it here.
on there.
the goblets! You brought them?
Yes, they're here.
good.
hark, ye...
o ye timeless ones...
ln the most august dread of the supreme Prince of Darkness...
and of his archangels and angels of darkness...
and his legions...
draw near and do my bidding, l command!
now will you believe?
now drink.
did you not hear me? l said drink.
drink! Do you hear me?
don't insult the master!
l can't. -Drink, damn you!
you!
drink!
you fools.
you pathetic, spineless fools.
you drink then! You drink it! You drink the filth!
help me!
he's dead.
what do you want? -William, what is it?
now listen carefully.
l was at home here all evening, do you understand?
at home here? -Yes, here.
can't you understand that? -Yes, but...
lf anybody asks.
but who could ask? -Anybody!
do you understand? -Yes, dear.
good.
Where's Alice? -ln her room.
you'd better tell her to do the same.
Yes, l'll tell her, but she's a headstrong girl.
l'll tell her myself then!
you'll tell me what, Father?
listen, Alice. Now listen carefully.
l was at home here all evening. Do you understand me?
Yes, l understand. -Good.
now go back to bed.
both of you.
are you sure-- -Go!
won't you tell me what's wrong? -No! Never.
never.
they have destroyed my servant.
they will be destroyed.
come on, Jeremy! -Come on, Lucy!
come through on the inside! That's it.
come on, Jeremy! -Come on, Lucy!
come through on the inside.
l won! Jeremy let me win.
no, it's not true. l didn't. -Yes, you did, but l don't care.
l'd rather cheat and win, than not win at all.
there, isn't that honest of me? -Very.
well, isn't anybody going to notice?
notice? What? Where? -No, look.
your ring.
lsn't it beautiful? Jeremy gave it to me.
we're engaged. -Does your father know?
no, of course not.
you can't talk to him these days. -Father's not very well, anyway.
l am sorry. -Come on, let's go home.
Alice has seen my ring, and she is green with envy.
that's all l came out for.
l'll race you home.
Alice, what are you wearing to the Allens' party on Friday?
my primrose, l think.
good, that won't clash with my blue.
Jeremy, what are you wearing? -My pink, l think.
ripping! lt won't clash with my yellow.
are you ready? Good. Go.
we'll see you both on Friday.
l'm sorry about your father, Paul. ls it serious?
nobody knows.
he came home the other night, went straight to bed...
and he hasn't moved since.
he won't see a doctor, he won't see anyone.
my father's been acting rather strangely, too.
he's been drinking heavily.
and that makes it even worse for your mother.
and for us.
l'm sorry, Paul. What's wrong with everybody?
mother, have you...
l'm sorry, l thought Mother was in here. Excuse me.
just a minute.
l see from your dress you intend going out.
Yes, Father, to the Allens' party.
l wasn't told about this.
l would've told you, only...
only what?
you haven't been very approachable lately, have you?
l mean, you haven't been quite yourself.
you think l've been drinking too much, is that what you mean?
ls that it? ls that what you mean? -Yes.
Yes, Father.
l see.
who is taking you to this party?
Paul. -l forbid it.
l forbid it. Go and get those things off. -But...
good evening, Mr. Paxton.
my daughter will not be coming to the party. So you can go.
may l ask why not, sir? -No, you may not.
ls she ill? -No, she's perfectly well, thank you.
lt is just my wish that she should not go out this evening.
excuse me.
may l ask you one more question? l think l have the right.
why do you hate me? What is it l've done to offend you?
you don't have to do anything to offend me, young man.
drive on!
coming to the party, Alice?
l can't. Father won't let me.
l said, are you coming to the party, Alice?
just give me a moment.
as to the place where it happened, l have been making discreet inquiries...
and have ascertained, as far as l am able, that no one ever goes there.
so, short of one or all of us returning there
no.
no, l must confess l should not relish such a journey myself.
short of us going and seeing for ourselves...
l think we can safely assume that the body will remain where it is...
until either it rots, or is discovered by some tramp...
who is unlikely to give the alarm.
what you're saying is...
it looks like we've got away with it.
as you say, it looks as though we've got away with it.
all that remains is for us to establish...
that none of us were away from our homes that evening.
l understand it is what the police call an alibi.
that is quite right.
well, if there is nothing else... -No.
then l shall declare that, not only is this meeting closed...
but that it never occurred.
good.
you'd better keep an eye on him. -An eye?
Yes, on his drinking. lt might loosen his tongue.
l'll try.
l did enjoy the party, Paul.
l must go in, Paul.
good night, darling. -l love you.
father.
l went to the party.
with Paul. Father, l love him.
l know it was wrong of me. -Yes.
lt was wrong of you.
l'm sorry, Father. -And you're going to be punished for it.
father, l've said l'm sorry. -l'm going to punish you.
l'm going to whip you, Alice.
don't touch me.
whip you, Alice.
please don't touch me. -And l haven't beaten you...
since you were a little girl...
have l, Alice?
let me go!
lf you touch me, Father, l'll never forgive you.
who are you?
how do you know my name?
come here.
damn you, come here!
Alice, you're going to be whipped.
whipped, do you hear me? Whipped.
now.
whipped, do you hear me?
the first.
lt's nasty, that.
very nasty. lt's nasty, Evans. Get it cleared up, will you?
Yes, sir.
hello.
l just came to see the lady of the house, sir, about him out there.
Mrs. Hargood is suffering from shock. l'm Paul Paxton. My sister's with her.
perhaps l'd better come back some other time, sir.
we can't do very much for him out there, can we?
except take him out of the flower beds.
but what about his daughter, Alice Hargood?
she been done in, too, sir?
God knows, but she's missing.
only missing. -Only?
Yes, since last night.
ls she a young girl, sir? -Yes.
trouble in the home? -Yes.
familiar story, sir. l won't keep you any longer.
but what are you going to do about her?
what do you want me to do about her?
lssue a description. Send her picture to all your police stations.
my dear sir, if we were to do that with every young girl that runs from home...
we wouldn't have time for anything else.
she has not run away. -How do you know that, sir?
l just know it! -l see, sir. You just know it.
l'm sure you have other things to attend to, like me, sir.
so if you'll excuse me. -Look, it's a raw morning.
l'm sure Mrs. Hargood wouldn't want you to leave without a little refreshment.
l won't while l'm on duty, sir. Good morning.
evans, you got that mess cleared up outside there yet?
'we beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin...
'unto the life of righteousness, that when we shall depart this life...
'we may rest in him, as our hope is this our brother doth...
'and that at the general resurrection in the last day...
'we may be found acceptable in thy sight and receive that blessing...
'which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce...
'to all that love and fear thee...
'through Jesus Christ our mediator and redeemer. Amen.
'and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore.
'Amen. "
l'll see Mrs. Hargood home. -All right.
why are you here? Why are you dressed like that?
l can't tell you now.
come to my house tonight. l'll tell you everything then.
ln the garden. -Why the garden?
l can't explain now, my dear, but do come, please.
Yes, all right. -And not a word to anybody, not to a soul.
promise?
all right, l promise. -Thank you, Lucy.
sorry, Jeremy. -Come on.
hope they haven't left us behind. -We can always walk.
l'm afraid the mistress isn't well enough to see anyone at the moment, sir.
what name shall l say called? -My name's Secker. Here's my card.
l'll call again. Good evening. -Good evening, Mr. Secker.
Betty, l'm just going.
lf anything should happen, you know...
let me know at once, will you? -Very good, sir.
l'm Paul Paxton, sir. -Yes, l know.
lt's a terrible business. -Yes. Did you know Mr. Hargood well?
we had met.
did you know that his daughter had disappeared?
l had heard. ls there any news? -Nothing.
the police? -They're worse than useless.
l go to the station at least four times every day to ask if they've any news.
they've told me not to bother them anymore.
as far as you know, they are not carrying out any proper investigation?
as far as l know, they are doing absolutely nothing.
someone's got to do something.
l love Alice...
and to know that she's somewhere in need of help, and nobody doing anything to...
l couldn't be any sorrier than l am now, Mr. Secker.
good night, sir.
l'm over here, Lucy.
where? -Over here.
you must be frozen.
why are you dressed like that? -Secret.
but l don't understand. -You will. Follow me.
but why? -Come along.
Alice, what is all this? -Come on.
whose carriage is this?
Alice, you haven't eloped, have you?
No!
please!
stop it!
Alice, tell him to stop!
really, what do you think that...
come on, Lucy.
where are we going, Alice?
come on. -Where are we?
come on, Lucy. -Where are we going?
Alice, why are we here? -l want you to meet someone.
ls it your lover? Where is he?
Alice, l'm afraid.
you're hurting me. -Do as he tells you.
l know l shouldn't have come here, but l had to.
you see, l know. -Know what?
first Hargood, then his girl...
then Lucy. Gone!
lt's him. lt's Courtley.
pull yourself together. -Don't you see? lt must be.
he's come back to punish us for what we did to him.
don't you see? -Drink it.
what are we going to do? -Make sure.
what? -l can't believe it, but we'll make sure.
how?
by finding out if the body of Courtley is still there.
l can't.
you can and will. Now!
well, it would seem that you were right. -My God.
unless, of course, someone has hidden the body.
hidden it?
but who? What for?
l only offer it as a possibility.
l think, however, we should make sure.
this has been disturbed.
help me.
come on.
my God.
lt's Lucy. She's dead.
no, she's not dead.
what do you mean?
she's neither dead nor alive.
look at the marks on her neck.
marks? l don't understand.
Paxton, listen to me! The marks on her neck...
she's a vampire!
l don't understand.
Oh, my God.
what can we do? -l believe there is a way to release her.
release her?
what do you mean? What are you talking about?
drive a wooden stake through her heart.
only then will she be free to die.
lf not...
she will live out her nightmare existence forever...
no.
the decision is yours, as her father.
l can't!
l will do it, then. You go away from here until l call you.
and when you return, she'll be at peace. -No, l'll stay.
get out of here!
get out of here. Leave us alone, do you hear?
l'll shoot you again if you don't get out.
Paxton-- -Get out!
now.
help me!
the second.
Mrs. Hargood, ma'am.
Yes, Betty? -Mr. Paul is here, ma'am.
ask him to come in, Betty. -Yes, ma'am.
will you go in, sir?
Mrs. Hargood? -Nothing?
we've searched everywhere, Jeremy and l.
every field for miles around, every ditch.
ls that where you expect to find her, Paul?
you think she's dead.
why has this happened to us, Paul?
what have we ever done? -God knows, Mrs. Hargood.
does he, Paul?
father?
Lucy, what...
where have you been? -Kiss me, Jeremy.
Lucy, my love. -Kiss me, my darling.
Oh, God!
Jeremy, thank God it's you. For a moment, l thought it was...
there's something that you must do for me immediately.
this letter's got to go to young Paxton, to Paul, you know. l want you to...
not you.
the third.
master...
did l do well?
did l please you?
wait.
please.
please wait. Please.
as it was addressed to you, sir, l thought you might like to have it.
l opened it because l thought it might throw some light on all this.
and did it? -Ramblings of a lunatic, sir. You'll see.
he goes on here about vampires and suchlike.
you couldn't have a clearer case, sir.
son hates his father...
he's hot-blooded, they quarrel, and the son loses his temper.
quite straightforward, sir.
however, we've got him locked up safe and sound.
but Jeremy did not hate his father. He was one of the most even
lf you've come here to obstruct justice-- -l came here because you sent for me.
here's your letter, sir. l shan't need to see you anymore.
and don't go touching that, will you, sir? -No.
master.
you have the courage to do what has to be done...
and above all...
your love for Alice will act as your strength and your protection.
and you must believe me.
you must arm yourself with knowledge, Paul.
and so you will see that, while there is little hope for your dear sister...
Alice may have escaped.
find her, Paul, and find her before nightfall.
only then will you know the truth.
we know that she is under his influence...
but she may not yet be his sister in blood.
not yet.
so find her, Paul. Find her!
find her before it is too late.
take it away.
you must give it to me, or we will punish you.
you're free, Alice. Free to choose good or evil.
you're not one of them yet. You're free to choose.
l must do as he says. He's my master. -He's not!
did l do well, master? Take me with you, master.
l have no further use for you.
run, Alice! Run as fast as you can away from here.
not without you, Paul. Please, you must come, too. He'll kill us!
please. -l can't go.
please, Paul.
please run. Do as l say!

one more unauthorized operation, one more raid, one more solo run...
and you can forget your pension!
do you get the picture? Do you?
it's hard not to. You're screaming.
Schrader!
I don't have the whole damn night!
KKZA Schrader, I should... - Sit down.
we confiscated your jacket and your police I D.
that's it, isn't it? Your jacket?
Yeah, it was stolen a few days ago.
parents died young. Raised by your older brother.
I bet he was really glad today.
he's been in prison for 6 years on a robbery charge.
but you already know that, don't you?
I read your file if that's what you mean.
what I don't get is, what made you join the police?
if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to the party.
ex plain it to me. You moved here. Left everything behind.
then these grades.
you barely got by. Just did what was necessary, Schrader?
what do you want anyway? That's what I'm asking you.
I don't have to justify myself to you.
this isn't a very good beginning for a fruitful partnership.
I want you to work in my department.
what?
but I...
I applied for another department last year and was accepted.
this here?
what gives you the right...
from your jacket. - They're not mine.
then there won't be any problems with the hair test.
your party days are over.
you know how it goes.
suspension, disciplinary proceedings.
a trial.
or you join my department.
female, about 20, identity unknown.
wanted to cross an intersection at 2: 30 a. m...
naked.
why call homicide?
she was being chased. - Witnesses?
we have a fingerprint from the guy who was after her.
after the fire? How did you get a print?
from the finger. I found it in her stomach.
while being strangled, she bit off the guy's finger, swallowed it and some how got away.
her state of confusion was drug induced.
Nipolept, if you really care to know.
a nasty finger.
saved us a lot of work.
Oh yeah, look at this.
my God, what kind of bastard would do a thing like that?
it was voluntary. - Voluntary?
who would voluntarily have their tongue split?
body modification.
body what? - Body modification.
the latest rage.
should be possible to identify her from the tongue, shouldn't it?
what tribe does "Speaks with forked tongue?" belong to?
what? - We should want to know who she is.
where should we start looking?
what am I doing here?
let somebody else take over this flat foot business.
you can always leave, if you like.
this must be it!
I got it. Top floor.
figures...
I was looking for Lynn Wilson. She lives here, doesn't she?
Yeah, come on in.
chief Inspector Minks. My colleague Schrader.
you're friends?
we studied together. In New York.
you see each other frequently?
no, never.
we came back together.
that is, at the same time.
we lost sight of each other quickly.
when did you talk to her last?
before your last phone call?
that must have been 3 years ago.
perhaps you could tell me what's going on here.
Lynn Wilson is dead.
what? - A traffic accident.
we don't know anything more specific at the moment.
you don't seem to be very sad about your girlfriend's death.
we knew each other so long ago.
it seems like another lifetime.
anyway, I'm not surprised.
Oh yeah? Why?
a person's home is supposedly the mirror of their soul.
we will probably have to question you in the next few days.
where can we reach you?
I'll give you the number of my gallery. That should be enough.
do you have a pen?
don't worry. Somebody will pay for this.
somebody always does.
is that something like a commandment?
experience.
come back home alive.
what? - That was a commandment.
the only one.
terrific.
you know the "in" places, don't you?
ever run into her before?
no, never seen her. - Her name's Marie.
last sign of life was a card to her parents.
postmarked "Berlin-Mitte.
quite a while ago. 2 years. - 2 years?
her father's a friend.
see if you can find her. A waste of time.
if I want your opinion I'll ask you.
see if you can find her.
what the fuck!? Let go!
fuck off, asshole!
you asshole!
get lost, you jack-off!
what the hell's going on?
I wanna see Marc. You're Minks, aren't you?
in the other room.
but ring the bell next time.
I did. But nobody answered.
right.
Oh shit.
what day is it?
Sunday.
don't you ever go home? What a mess!
is it really that difficult to say something nice?
we identified the finger. It belongs to Norbert Gunzel.
previously charged with bodily injury and rape.
distinguishing mark:
a heart-shaped tattoo on his right upper arm.
mommy tried.
Schrader?
minks?
nobody leaves before we're finished here.
why would anybody do that?
does it matter?
who would've thought the two of us would make homicide.
Poscher got stuck with night duty.
and you? A week on the job...
and you already hit the jackpot.
what's he like? Minks the killer?
we get along. That was quite a scene he made.
what did you call him?
killer?
don't tell me you don't know?
his wife was run down by a car years ago.
it was a hit and run.
so what?
of course it's just a rumor...
they say Minks found him months later...
and put a bullet in his head.
then there's the thing with his daughter.
don't just stand around, Schrader. Get busy!
you've really getting along great.
what a fucking mess!
I'm gonna get you, you bastard. You can bet your life on it.
Minks!
go home and get some sleep.
I'm not finished here.
that was an order.
don't let the press find out about the basement.
you can count on it!
Schrader will drive you home.
my wife was killed in a car accident.
Marie never got over her death.
I guess I was no big help to her.
and suddenly she was gone.
she just didn't come back home.
I have to find out what happened to her.
you've gotta help me.
if she is... still here...
find her!
dinner's ready.
I'll be right there.
What're you looking for?
do you know her?
who's that?
that's enough. Thanks. Looks great!
it's Marie, Minks' daughter.
she ran away two years ago.
two years ago?
I know. But listen around anyway.
okay.
Oh man!
what do you mean? It tastes really...
the victims have been identified.
the first one was reported missing 3 years ago, the second 7 months later, the third 20 months later. There's no pattern.
was he alone?
Gunzel. I mean, did he work alone?
Petra?
cause of death?
cause of death?
cause of death?
I am certain that...
what did she say?
what? - What did she say?
I said all the victims were killed by the same person.
a serial killer. State-certified.
is that Lynn Wilson's? We don't know yet.
it'll take a few days. You can see how busy we are.
are you looking for something specific?
I'm afraid I can't afford anything here.
let's take a walk. I was just closing anyway.
you're new at this, aren't you?
Why? Am I that awkward?
you just don't seem like a cop.
but who is what they seem?
what I wanted to know...
did Lynn Wilson have a tattoo?
Yes.
Oh yeah? Was it a dragon?
Yes, but I imagine you saw it.
no, her corpse was burned to a crisp.
since when does the homicide department investigate accidents?
since we've known it wasn't one.
how many do we have left?
that's only half of what we found at Gunzel's.
I thought it'd end the way it began.
with a big bang.
I think it'll be more like a whimper.
if we knew who made them, maybe we could get to Gunzel.
can I help you?
Thanks, we'll find the way.
Hey, what's going on?
are you crazy?
we're only after the film star.
what if I know nothing?
you get to wear my handcuffs.
fuck. I have no idea where he came from.
ask Martha. He came with her.
the tattoed... girl where do I find her?
this is Minks.
send the forensic people to Dante Street.
stop!
Freeze! Police!
put your hands behind your head and stay down!
stay down!
put your hands up!
hands up, or I'll shoot!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Freeze!
how do you feel?
as you know, we have to investigate as we do with every homicide.
Where's Minks? - Next door.
talk to your colleague first. You know each other.
one more thing:
keep this to yourself until the investigation is completed.
it won't take long if you play the game.
but if you screw me, I'll screw you.
so...
how did you happen to shoot Norbert Gunzel?
he shot himself, as you probably already know.
just the questions.
where was the gun?
did you drop it? Did he take it away from you?
I was holding the gun.
you were holding the gun?
he shot himself with your gun while you were holding it?
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
let me tell you the truth, Schrader...
you have no business being here.
then I can leave, huh?
I'm not through with you yet. But I'm through with you.
am I under arrest? Otherwise I can leave if I want to.
you know what'll happen if you walk outta here?
they'll never promote you.
you can forget the homicide department.
that's just what I wanted.
don't worry about it. It's just a formality.
the most important thing is: Always come back home alive.
I'm out.
do your hair test if you like.
that way I can just quit after my leave.
if I hear about your daughter...
police! Up against the wall! Spread your legs!
stop staring! And get something!
here!
I'll get a doctor. I got all I need...
what happened? Come on, man. I wanna help you!
mind your own business!
alright, Stefan Kreiner.
that's all I got left. I need it... for the pain.
tell me everything.
it's not what it looks like. There's nothing illegal about it.
it's my choice!
all the better. - Wait, man! Fuck!
wait a sec, man. Wait a sec.
whenever I'm broke I call this guy...
what guy? - This... this lawyer.
and he gets me an appointment with a dermatologist.
yeah? - And... I sign an agreement.
I sign an agreement, a completely legal agreement.
and it says that I do this voluntarily.
and that I can't talk about anything. You understand?
you do what voluntarily?
I sell him... I sell him my tattoos, you know?
I sell him my pictures.
he buys them off you?
it's his business. Others do it, too.
what's this lawyer's name?
what's his name? - Schoubya. Frank Schoubya.
gimme that. Give it to me!
tea... - Nice.
sorry, I interrupted you. - Sorry.
no, thanks.
it's nice here.
Thanks, but you didn't come for the view.
no, I thought you could tell me about Lynn's tattoo.
sure...
Lynn got her tattoo in New York, right?
it was a Japanese master, in the classical style: Hiromitsu.
classical style?
the classical era of Japanese tattoos was between the 17 th and 18th centuries.
the Japanese have little interest in naked bodies.
the purity of virgin skin means nothing to them.
the Hiromitsu
he only did 12 tattoos.
this is Lynn's.
number 3.
they are true works of art. The Japanese passion for tattoos led people to collect skin.
collectors bought pictures from the living and waited for them to die.
skin collectors. - Just myths, of course.
I doubt they're true.
that Hori...
Hiromitsu. - Yes.
he died.
it's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
not at all.
but I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
nothing. Just curious.
actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
since you're on leave.
Yeah, I know. It's just for my report.
Oh well. The case is closed.
and anyway, you played a part in it, too.
yeah?
Yeah, did you check the list of names?
just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
and all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks. Thanks.
Schrader.
Schrader!
you aren't needed here.
Dix. How observant.
black.
damn it!
what do you want? You're on leave, and the Gunzel case is closed.
Gunzel was no serial killer.
not in the usual sense.
he was filling orders.
and not just for Hiromitsu.
orders? From whom?
someone called Irezumi.
there are collectors... Gunzel was just the tip of the iceberg.
there are others... - Schrader!
Gunzel was in prison. He couldn't have committed every murder.
if it was murder!
all 12 people with a Hiromitsu are reported dead or missing. Come on. 12
has Gunzel's death been made public?
tomorrow. - We have to stop it.
until we know who's behind it.
we? - Yeah, I wanna work the case again.
what's the lawyer's name? Schoubya. Frank Schoubya.
call me by my first name, since we're spending time together again.
I'll clear things with my superiors.
I got him!
what's going on here anyway?
an old man was buried here yesterday.
last night, somebody dug him out and chopped him up.
we've been looking everywhere for his head.
sometimes I don't understand the world anymore.
how did you last this long?
my family. No matter what,
I went back home, and everything was okay.
can I ask you something?
they say you found that hit-and-run driver.
Yes, I found him.
an insignificant state employee, living in a row house.
I went into his bedroom at night. He was alone.
I woke him up.
I wanted him to know why.
it was pathetic. He cried like a baby.
I just couldn't do it.
sometimes I drive past his house at night when I can't sleep.
he got married last year. Has a daughter of his own.
if somebody always pays, who paid for your wife's death?
I did. I paid for it.
now let's go after your Mr. Schoubya.
Mr. Schoubya. Chief Inspector Minks.
my colleague, Officer Schrader.
thank you for seeing us at such short notice.
we have a few questions.
Lynn Wilson, present residence: The state morgue.
familiar?
sorry, no.
what about Stefan Kreiner? Present residence: Nowhere.
a steady client of yours, I believe.
I'm familiar with Mr. Kreiner.
I prepared some contracts for him.
what kinds of contracts?
sales contracts.
sales contracts for what, Mr. Schoubya?
listen, it's useless for me to play innocent.
the contracts involved tattoos.
I agree, quite unusual objects, but it's no reason to get upset.
the transactions were legal and carried out by mutual agreement.
so you negotiated for a third party, a collector.
that's right.
who is the collector? - I regret.
what does it cost to skin someone?
I'm only a businessman.
if you are planning to contact the D A in order to gain access to my files...
no crime has been committed.
so there's no necessity to reveal my client's identity.
you're a businessman. So let's make a deal.
a Hiromitsu. If your client is so hot on this shit, he can have this, provided he tells us something about the tattoo trade.
it's too bad you folded it.
that drastically lessens the value.
nevertheless, I'll see what I can do.
you know this is material evidence.
did I say it wasn't?
either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself.
I'm hungry. How about you?
I'll see you tomorrow.
as you like.
Yeah, what's up?
what's so damned urgent anyway?
order me a beer at the bar. I'll be right there, okay?
sorry.
hey... 2 beers, please.
recognize her?
I found her.
Minks' daughter. Got it?
she's been here since last Sunday.
I didn't realize it until we talked to each other.
Marie? This is Marc, the friend I told you about.
Yeah. - Hi. - Hi.
can I have a beer?
I have to talk to her. You really just want to talk?
what if she doesn't want to? - What?
go back to her old man? Will you leave her alone? - Yeah.
you'll leave her alone? - Yeah!
Meltem said you know me?
Yeah, we have a mutual acquaintance.
this is getting ex citing.
I know your father. I'm his partner.
shit. - Hey, don't worry. I'm here alone.
let me go.
let her go, will ya! - Shut up, okay?
I'm not going back. - You know you're father's almost cracking up.
he doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh man.
shit.
want some chewing gum?
here, they make the best bubbles.
what kind of cop are you anyway?
a new reform-oriented generation.
we're civilian friendly and practice painless police brutality.
hey? Are you gonna tell me what happened back then?
I heard about your mother's accident.
my father totally cracked up.
he just couldn't understand why it had to happen to him.
there was always a reason, a motive.
Hey, I got so sick of hearing that crap.
then he started observing me even more than ever.
he'd secretly watch me on my way home from school...
I didn't want to run away, but he nearly smothered me with his love.
I wanted to hurt him.
I have my own life now. And I don't trust him.
this is really not about me. I never was. It's all about him!
what now?
will you report me?
no. Don't worry.
gentlemen. - Is the collector here? Of course.
this way.
the deeply-felt beauty of an object and the sorrow of its transitoriness.
accepting the fleeting nature of existence, understanding that the transitoriness of Creation bestows it with value is the foundation of Japanese culture.
many collectors hide their pieces behind glass.
I prefer to let them hang freely.
it makes them come to life.
our society is in a transition. Instead of advancing away from the primitive...
we are drawn back to our base natures.
some more than others.
Stefan Kreiner, the junkie.
ironically, some of the most valuable artworks are on the most worthless bodies. What's in there?
everything needed to care for the tattoos. - Skin care?
interesting.
we should get down to business now.
I believe you have something with you.
the pinnacle of tattoo art.
perhaps of all art. Absolutely priceless.
speaking of prices.
Yes, you want to know who deals with tattoos.
there are no traders.
only like-minded people.
all the transactions are legal.
the tattoos come from the families of deceased owners.
or from voluntary sales, like with our mutual friend, the junkie.
there's no shortage of his type.
what if someone refuses.
I know what you're getting at... illegal goods.
I know the rumors. I'm a collector, not a hunter. Whatever you're looking for has nothing to do with me.
no skin off your back.
I'm sorry. I know you were hoping for more.
not really.
the masterpiece of my collection.
are you crazy?
you're in possession of stolen property and suspected of committing a theft.
what are you saying?
your masterpiece was stolen yesterday from the forensics department.
Mr. Schoubya,
I've been waiting a lifetime for a guy like you.
you won't get away with this. Not with your means of investigating.
that's right, but it's enough to get a search warrant.
within an hour, I'll have you hounded by reporters.
your playroom will appear in every newspaper's "Better Homes" section.
I'll have you, your reputation and all your like-minded people incinerated.
I'll pull you down so far you won't recognize the world anymore.
I'll pull your skin over your ears.
now talk!
some traders and collectors aren't very particular about the voluntary aspect.
who are they?
they don't know each other.
everything is organized in an anonymous chat room where skins are auctioned, always available and for everyone.
only hand-picked initiates are aware of what really happens.
was Lynn Wilson's tattoo, Hiromitsu No. 3, also auctioned there?
I also made a bid.
2 million, then I dropped out. Millions?
Gunzel got 254, 000, but who got the rest?
somebody who won't allow anyone to interfere with his business.
Irezumi?
translate to "tattoo" in Japanese.
no one knows more. At least I don't.
you're a liar. - I was always overbid.
that's why I couldn't resist when you offered me the Hiromitsu.
I should have known.
if everything is so secret, how did you find the chat room?
I didn't. Irezumi found me.
you first need a buyer or a supplier before you can get close to him.
but since they only deal with Irezumi and not with each other, you can only discover their identity through Irezumi.
the system is perfect. You'll never find him.
but we'll get you for being an accessory.
I want the boss. "Tattooing" in Japanese...
take it nice and slow!
you lied to me.
all your questions about Lynn's tattoo.
she was killed for her tattoo.
what about you?
did you tell me the truth?
I thought there were 12 Hiromitsus.
I wish it were so.
you were together?
you and Hiromitsu.
I loved him.
so much I didn't care that love meant something different to him.
we were so happy.
until his masterpiece was finished.
he lost interest in me.
he lost interest in everything. In life as well.
he killed himself.
attained absolute perfection.
and left me behind with a wound that won't heal.
ironically, I'm the only thing that's left of him.
so Lynn Wilson knew about your tattoo?
of course, but she swore never to tell anyone about it.
before ending up in Gunzel's basement.
Gunzel most likely knew about her tattoo and whoever else worked with him. Irezumi, too.
who else knows about it?
your family? Your lover?
no one.
your silence has saved your life.
until now.
now you need us, and we need you.
there's only one way to catch that maniac.
hold on.
by offering him something he can't refuse.
you aren't serious!
we have no other choice. What are you talking about?
what are you talking about? He wants to use you as bait.
you what? - It's your only chance.
put me out there like a piece of meat.
you came to see us.
don't get her involved! She already is!
you wanted to solve this case. Not at her ex pense.
and we'll solve it.
always you! And if it's the last thing I do.
you just can't be trusted.
what?
here's a package.
speak up! Who's it for?
for you, Inspector Minks.
from somebody named Irezumi. I'll put it here.
oar keys and a parking-lot ticket.
no.
what's wrong?
what's wrong? Speak up!
Marie.
Marie? - I found her.
I promised her not to tell you.
What're you saying?
this is Marie's tattoo.
don't go.
don't go there!
shit!
Schrader. Call out a large-scale search for H. K. Minks.
Yes, Minks!
Schrader.
what a shame.
but it had to end this way someday.
I didn't think anyone knew where she was.
how the heck did they find her?
you're not serious. We just have to see your face.
we only need this here.
that's how Gunzel probably contacted Irezumi.
we' II get him.
he can't pass this up.
Maya, it's just a matter of time before you're discovered.
you don't understand a thing.
I'll keep my eye on you. Nothing will happen to you.
you thought differently yesterday.
damn it... yesterday!
I led him to Minks' daughter.
what if something goes wrong?
how long will you stay?
a week? A month?
then you'll be gone, and I'll be free for slaughter.
you are already.
gentlemen...
now the back.
what if he doesn't get in touch?
don't worry.
he won't pass up this opportunity.
go on.
talk to her.
Irezumi!
take the suitcase to Convention Center, place it in a van with the number 1969.
we have to put something in it.
Lynn's tattoo, the 3rd Hiromitsu.
when's the exchange? - Midnight.
just one more hour. Come on.
I'm here.
do you have me?
I see you. The transmitter's working. Midnight.
okay, Poscher, let's go.
take the suitcase and get out.
check if one of the vans has the number 1969.
I got it.
try the doors.
there's a disturbance. - Poscher?
I'll go to the rear.
Poscher? Can you hear me?
Poscher, come in, please!
Poscher!
move in!
a lamp!
stay up here. We'll only shoot each other down there.
shit.
Congratulations. How could anybody fuck up so much in one night?
Poscher? Dead.
the 3rd Hiromitsu? Stolen.
and Maya? Disappeared without a trace.
what?
but her apartment was under constant surveillance.
they made sure nobody entered, not whether someone left.
she was gone, when the replacement came.
I don't get it.
why leave our protection and put herself in danger?
I didn't get it at first either. Until this arrived.
what is it?
the Hiromitsu file.
it took our colleagues in New York sometime to find out who the pseudonym was.
as it turns out, he didn't commit suicide like your girlfriend claimed.
he didn't?
he was murdered.
skinned.
it was never solved. The colleagues think that it was a kind of
personal vengeance, because the murderer or murderess took several days to skin him.
now guess who left New York a day after the murder, even days before the press found out.
she lied to you.
probably from the beginning.
she played with you like a cat with a mouse.
she screwed you and whoever worked with her.
where is she?
where is she? - Who?
no. No...
where is she?
wait!
where is she? - No.
please, don't. No.
this won't get you anywhere!
I'm meaningless. You didn't accomplish anything.
[ yelling] Check it out!
thirteen minutes and 54 seconds. That's a new record.
[ all ] Yeah!
Oh, my God. What you gonna do with the girl but love her and pay her?
give me my money. Give me my money. You still owe me money.
[Man ] Hey. Everybody, shut the hell up fora second here.
as you know, today's Belle's last day.
[ all ] Aw!
and I'll tell you this. You're the best man I've ever had.
Aw. - [All Clapping]
Aw, come on, now. Look, look.
I just want you to know I just stayed ahead of you...
because I know you enjoyed the view.
the view.
anyway...
we're all real proud of you for finally getting your taxi license.
knowing that you're behind the wheel of a taxi in our fair city...
makes us want to move to Albany.
listen, I seen these sparkle in a window, and I knew they had your name on them.
come on. I thought they'd be perfect for you. Check it out. You're gonna love 'em.
Oh, wow. - This is you, girl.
Oh, my God. - Ah? Ah?
it's a titanium supercharger! - Yeah!
Oh, my God. - That's gonna be some taxi, Belle.
it's just my size too! - That's right, Belle.
please don't leave us. Don't leave us.
all right. Time's up, man. Come on. Get your hands off my girlfriend. Get off me, man.
Hey, baby. - Hey, baby.
[ all ] Oooh!
shut up! None of your business. - Back to work. Let's go. Everybody.
I could have got the package there with a horse and buggy. Back to work.
what you doin' here? - I called in a favor. They let me take the rest of the day off.
all right. - Wait a minute.
wait a minute. Who you wearin' perfume for? - What?
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, I cut through Macy's. I got tagged.
Uh-huh. - Why, you like it? Is it me?
look, let me tell you something, baby.
there's only one thing I like on you. - What's that?
and that's me. - Mmm.
and I got you a little somethin' for your last day too. - What?
hold on now. You'll find out tonight. After a mind-blowing romantic dinner.

iVamonos! iVamonos!
Hey! Stop!
they're gettin' away! Come on. Let's go.
you can't drive with your arm like that. Give me the keys. - No way.

[ woman ] Get in here now.
I'm s-- I'm sorry, Marta. Lieutenant.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
Andy...
I know this is hard for you, especially coming from me.
it kind of feels weird calling you lieutenant.
well, you may not have to much longer. I mean, look at this.
$40, 000 in damages, Andy.
this is two lawsuits here.
I
and this. Have you seen your face on the cover?
Oh, there's a better picture than that. - Oh, shut up.
I-- I'm sorry, Andy. But this is just not easy for me.
look, you're a good cop, but you're a terrible driver. What is it with you?
hey-- Everyone has their weaknesses, okay?
Superman has Kryptonite. Indiana Jones, snakes.
you know. Whitney Houston has Bobby Brown.
or vice versa.
I-- I try to make the department look good, try to make you look good.
you look great, by the way.
I'm not saying you don't. You're not like
you look-- Ah! - Right. Okay. Good. Enough.
you look like a lieutenant. - Shh.
beautiful. You're hot. - Shh.

cop or no cop, that is 11 points on your license. It's gone.
no, don't take my license, please. - It's gone.
come on. Don't
you're not gonna need it for your next assignment.
[Belle ] I'm sorry, baby, but that line at the T.L.C. was ridiculous.
I cooked for hours. - Come on. Look, look. All right.
had wine, satin sheets. I even bought candles.
do you realize what I had to go through to get that license?
I won't be late. - Yeah, well, you better not be.

Whoa! Yo, man. Be careful with that.

Yeah. - What? Are you outta your freakin' mind?
Hey! - Fool, I've been working on this car for five years.

I can't. She's got it.
Freeze! - Wai-Wait.
I said freeze scum-- Washburn. Washburn. [ Laughs ]
he's such a loser.
[ shuddering ] - [Marta ] Is he in there?
Washburn.
Washburn. You took a cab to a bank robbery?
you-you thought that was okay? - Well, y-yeah.
Yeah. I was the closest to the scene.
if you hadn't of taken my wheels, I would've nailed 'em.
I didn't take your wheels. You drove your wheels through a bodega...
and you killed Detective Manuel's parrot.
det. Manuel knew what he was risking when he took the parrot on the stakeout.
[ scoffs ] I can't believe you. - So ridiculous.
of all pets, I mean. It's the one that talks. - [ Sniffs ]
what is that smell? - I-I know. I let you down.
Mm-hmm. - So, see what's happening?
Mm-mmm. - You're getting emotional and taking it way too personally.
personally? - Yeah.
I'm your lieutenant. Of course I'm pissed off.
come on, Marta. That's not what I'm talking about.
you know what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about-- [ Whispers ] us.
[ whispers ] Us. - What?
us. I'm talking about us. - You think...
Shh. - that I and you
I got it. Got that. I'm with you.
what? Mm-hmm.
okay. Thank you. I'll be right there.
the F.B.I.'s here.
I'm gonna do something to you later.
Washburn.
so, did you pay by the mile, or is there a flat rate for chasing bank robbers?
quiet. Please give your attention to Agent Mullins...
F.B.I. Armed Robbery Unit.
thank you. It's tape ofthis morning's robbery. Watch close.
it goes by pretty fast. - [ Woman Screams ]
four cameras. Four perfect shots.
in and out in 35 seconds. Lieutenant, you have the witnesses' statements.
miss Williams, I'm Lieutenant Robbins.
this is Agent Mullins with the F.B.I. We want to ask you a few questions.
am I under arrest? - Well, no.
then I ain't answering no questions until somebody tells me...
who is paying for the damage on my cab and when do I get it back?
miss Williams, I'm afraid your vehicle's physical evidence now.
we have to run ballistics tests-- - Ballistics tests? On what?
we already know who shot my cab.
it was that stupid idiot right there with that dumb look on his face.
that's not fair. Agent Mullins wasn't even on the scene.
I was talkin' about you. - [ Stammers ] Me?
you shot my back window out. You could've shot me.
you don't talk to me like that. - I'll talk however I want.
get him out. - Take his stinkin' ass out of here.
all right, all right. I'm sorry. - Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry. - That is the F. B.I. in there. You need to calm down.
[Belle ] Somebody better talk to him.
sorry 'bout that, dude, um, sir. The adrenaline's still pumping.
you know what I'm saying? Had a crazy morning.
I'm a little out of line, and I apologize.
detective Washburn, you were the first one on the scene, correct?
Yes, I was. I was the first one on the scene.
my first instinct is to give you a shot at leading this investigation.
[ stammering ] - However, I spoke with your lieutenant. You're off the case.
permanently. - What?
nice meeting you. [ Sniffs ]
I know.
Y-- Marta, you can't-- Lieutenant.
you can't-- - Enough.
now, go clock in. You're late foryour shift.
[ scoffs ] I already told you everything I know.
you can't hold me. Now, I want my cab.
says here you did a year in juvenile hall. - That's supposed to be sealed.
joyriding. Graduated to reckless driving, fleeing the scene of an accident
look at this-- moving violation, moving violation, moving violation.
come on. Everybody got a few tickets. - Not 75.
and not on a bicycle, Miss Williams.
offiicers at the front desk will give you the forms you need to fill out.
as far as your car's concerned, you'll get that back when we're done. Two weeks, maybe longer.
two weeks? Come on, man. This is bullshit.
that's not just my car. That is my job.
wh-what am I supposed to do? Give people piggy back rides to Newark Airport?
one more question.
did you ever get close enough to see the guy driving the car?
no, sir.
all I saw was their taillights.
can I go now?
here we go again. Didn't I say 5: 00? Where are you? - Jesse.
I feel like a damn fool, B. thinking you'd actually be here on time.
I tried. - No, no, no. No. I'm tired of hearing excuses, okay?
I'm sittin' in my cab, right? All of a sudden out of now here, this guy jumps
Hello? Baby? Jesse?
what the hell could be so damn important?
freakin' day I had. - Hey. Miss Williams.
you again. - Hey, hey, hey.
go ahead. Talk. - I just wanna talk.
talk then. - I can get you your cab back.
come on.
you gotta help me first.
okay? Just hear me out.
they got five detectives on this case. We gotta catch these guys first.
all I got to go on is the M. O. modus operandi.
that's police jargon for-- - I know what it means.
it's not police jargon. It's Latin. - Right. Whatever. It's both.
they were pretty quick though. They were in and out in, like, under a minute.
that's real pros. Witnesses said they're either Spanish or Italian.
Nah, I think they're Brazilian. They were speaking Portuguese.
you sure? - Confia em mim.
my first job was delivering food at-- [ Speaks Portuguese ]
Brazilian. This is huge.
Hey, why are we not doing this at the station?
sometimes a good cop's got to bend the rules so that laws don't get broken.
you know what I'm saying? I'm not afraid to live outside the law.
[ scoffs ] You living outside of your mind. That's where you live.
well, the reports here say that the man driving was about 5'10."
no. No, no, no, no. If that was a man, so am I.
she looked like a model. Tan, blondish hair.
all right. As I was saying. It was a woman driving...
and she was driving a Mercedes-- an Au-- - No.
Mm-mmm. No, no, no. - She was driving-- Definitely you saw her driving...
a B.M.W? - Right.
Yeah, but not just a B.M.W. It was a 760. - Mm-hmm.
but the engine sounded lighter. - Light, yeah.
now, with that much torque, she had to have an inboard torsion damper system...
with apush rodbell crank and double wishbone arrangement.
wait a minute. You shot her tire out, didn't you?
Yeah. Standard O. P.
that's police jargon for-- - But she kept on going...
cause she had run flats.
Yeah, that's what I thought. She had "runs" flats on.
armored tires. They seal themselves with a gel when they're punctured.
now, they're good, but they only go for about 50 miles.
so, if she wants to drive that car again, she's gonna have to get a new tire.
and there's only one place to get that tire around here. Lou's Garage in Secaucus.
what are we waiting for? Let's hit it. Take my ride. - All right.
there's my baby, right there.
this is your unmarked car? - We found her.
a Daewoo? Man, I know people. I can't be seen in this thing.
tsk. Open the door. I don't wanna get Daewoo on my hands.
buckle up for safety, everybody. Hard to do it with my holster on.
okay, we're good. - [ Starts Engine ]
good, wipers work. 10:00 and 2:00.
mirrors work. And here we go.
Oh, damn.
Whoa! Sheesh, man. - Little ding. Little ding.
that's why you got bumpers. - Can't you-- What the hell?
you trying to kill me? - I'm not a perfect driving robot.
I know. Oh! What are you doing? - Here comes Junior.
here comes Junior. - You can't-- Oh, shit! Wait! Stop. Stop. Stop.
what the hell are you trying to do, a 78-point turn?
can you get us out of this spot? - Yes.
God... damn!
now, I'm turning the wheel. Turning the wheel.
Oh, my God! Wait. Wait. - Shh. Everyone be cool.
no. Stop.
what? What? What do you-- What do you want?
what's the problem here? - Get over there.
I got-- I got shot gun. - Get your ass over there.
you got insurance? 'Cause that's what I'm gonna need.
daggone whiplash. You got a driver's license?
let me get my belt on.
who the hell gave you a driver's license? That's what I wanna know.
[Belle ] Okay, after I show you this place, I'm gonna get my cab back?
deal. - 'Cause I don't really trust you.
soon as I know this is the place, we'll go back to the station, I'll get your cab back.
this is it? - Yep.
if they gettin' that car fixed, they-they gotta come here.
so, what now? - We wait.
you can open your eyes now. I'm done.
you didn't see my nads, did you? [ Chuckles ]
so, you got guy problems, huh? Overheard you and your man on the phone.
want a little bit of wisdom from the man side?
I'll give it to you.
men are like cats, you know?
sure, we'll play with the ball of yarn...
unless you want us to play with the ball of yarn.
trick is, hide the ball of yarn.
don't hide it where you can't find it, you know?
Hey, what's the ball of yarn doin' in the fridge?
whatever. You know what I'm saying?
you know, cops are supposed to talk to each other on stakeouts.
it helps the mission go by faster.
would you please shut up? - Okay. That's cool.
you wanna be quiet? That's cool. No room for chitchat. That's fine.
I don't care. I don't need-- I don't need to talk.
we'll just sit here in silence.
so, are you into cars, or-- I mean, what got you into cars?
I mean, were you always into them? Did you just, like, stumble upon them?
damn. My grandpa.
okay? - Yeah.
w-what? He loved driving, or
Yeah. He was a mechanic. Taught me everything I know.
we used to live next to a track.
you used to go to the track all day? That's fun.
no. We didn't really go that much. I mean, we went to a couple races.
but mostly, we would just listen to the races together.
I could hear those cars. Hear those engines.
I got good. I-I got to the point where...
I could tell who won the race without even seeing it.
Yeah. Driving NASCAR. That's my dream. - Wow.
wait. Let me ask you something. Why would you take a taxi to a bank robbery?
I mean, I've never seen that.
I got in a wreck in my last gig.
bad guys got away. My lieutenant flipped out.
put me back on the beat. No vehicle.
what makes it worse, me and my lieutenant used to date.
Yeah. We went to Academy together. - Okay.
she got promoted. I didn't.
you can cut the sexual tension with a knife.
Shh! Look.
there they are.
Oh, man. Yep. That's her.
that's her.
party time. - Hey. So-So, what we gonna do now?
I mean, we gonna call it in, right? - Call it in?
by the time we get backup, that soup will be cold. We go in now, baby. Now.
shoot. Oh, my God.
daewoo, please. I'm sorry. I take back everything I said. Start forme.
Hi. Um, I'm not actually with him. He's
you okay? - Yeah.
damn. - [ Portuguese ]
what are they saying? - The red head is saying she doesn't wanna kill a cop.
if we just play it cool, then they'll leave us here tied up.
okay. Okay. I'll play it cool. Play it real cool.
okay. Hey, what was that wink for?
Shh. Hey, trust me. - No, no, no, no, no, man. What was that about?
Shh. Trust me. Trust me. - Trust you?
Yeah. - Trust you? Hell no. Uh-uh. No way.
no, no, no. Uh-uh. Hey. Excuse me.
excuse me. - ## [ Humming Loudly]
excuse me. Hey. Excuse me. Don't mean to interrupt.
he's gonna do something. He just winked at me.
what's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me?
Yeah. - I got a problem gettin' shot. Did you frisk him?
come on. - Frisk his ass again. He got at least one more gun on him.
Cavity-search him. - I do not. I swear.
he got a gun, and he's gonna use it. He's crazy.
whose side are you on? - Mine.
[ portuguese ]
okay. You wanna strip search? Huh? Is that what you want? Nothing up my sleeve here.
you wanna check my shoes there? Ha!
go!
all right, you're all under
man, you're more dangerous than they are.
[ hissing ] - Hey. What are you doing, man?
that's flammable gas. They won't be able to shoot. This whole place will blow.
man, we still in this place, you jackass.
turn that off, and let's wait for the cops to come.
the real cops.
you smell that, ladies? That's nitrous. One shot and boom!
now, you wanna handle this hand to hand, man to... chick?
then we'll go home. - [Hissing Continues ]
ace Dumbtura, they're gone.
they're gone.
stay down. Stay down. They're not there.
come on. We gotta go. - [ Deep Voice ] Oh, damn.
[ deep Voice ] This thing's jammed.
dumb ass. [ Chuckling ]
you can't-- You can't die from nitrous oxide can you?
[ laughing ] It's laughing gas, stupid.
what's that? - I hate your freakin' guts.
Ow. - You got to be the dumbest cop I've met.
we gotta go. We gotta get out. - Okay.
we gotta get out. - All right. Okay. Open the door.
open the door, man. Move. [ Laughing ]
you're stupid. All you had to do was turn the freakin' knob.
[ both Laughing ] - Your car is on fire.
no. Come on. - Daewoo can't take a little heat?
drop the weapon!
Freeze! - Oh.
[Washburn ] Okay. This does not look good.
here's the plan, all right? Okay, when he comes by
or that. Hey! Hey! Wait for me! Belle! Belle, wait up!
they've gone around the back side of this building. We need to go.
I tell you what we do. We go back to the station and search the files
no, no-- No. Hell I no. We ain't goin' nowhere.
you're comin' back to my house with me to tell my boyfriend where I was.
cause I had a man when I went to work today.
okay. That's the least I can do.
damn straight. The most you could do would be to get my cab back.
you'll get your cab back when I catch these guys-- girls, women.
not before.
I'm getting a little seasick. [ Gags ]
swallowed it.
I don't know if this is gonna work, so just hurry up and show him your badge, okay?
because he's sensitive, and he is pissed off.
all right. I got your back right here. I owe you one.
Jesse. Baby, you home?
wait. I can explain. I was with this guy all night. - Oh, really?
then go home with him, Belle. I'm tired of hearing your apologies.
first of all, don't take that tone with me. I ain't apologizing.
don't you be taking that tone. I've been waiting here all night.
Hey, hey, hey. I got this. I can handle this. All right?
I can totally handle this. What's up, bro? How you doin', man?
here's the dilly, yo. I know it seems weird your girl hanging out...
with the skinny, pretty good-looking white dude.
but, hey, I'm a cop.
the name's Detective Washburn.
at least let me explain. - Oh, no. Not again.
he's gonna give it back, right? - [ Scoffs ]
what's that sound?
[Whirring Continues ] - [ Scoffs ] Blowtorch.
Blo-Blo-- Blowtorch. Hey, Jesse.
thank you. Can I have my
at least let me explain. - Ow. Man.
[Bangs On Door] - Damn!
always wanted a money clip. - What the hell was that?
it was my badge. - You know what? Fine.
forget it. I'm just gonna let him cool off.
Hey, wait up. - I don't know you for seven hours, I lose my cab...
my boyfriend and my apartment.
you battin' a thousand, you know? - Yeah.
I mean, it's not enough you screw up your own life, huh? This your place?
no. I figured we'd stop here, get something to eat.
you actually have a girlfriend?
[ gasps ] - Ma!
ma. - Sweetheart. [ Laughs ]
[ together ] I love you. I love you. I love you.
ma, I brought company.
nice catch. Jungle fever.
[ Chuckles ] You know me. - Excuse me.
I'm not his girlfriend. I ain't even his friend.
mom, uh, Belle here is a cabdriver...
and she witnessed a bank robbery-- - [ Gasps ]
she needs a place to stay. - Get in here! Come in.
come in.
Oh, you must be starving. [ Giggles ]
[ giggles ] - I have got the number of a joint...
that makes a General Tso's chicken
it'll knock you on your god damn ass.
Whoo! - Your mom's drunk, huh?
always. - [ Whirring ]
[ stops ] - Where's my Daewoo?
Andy...
did you do something to my car? - Don't.
[ mouthing ] You busted. - Andy.
look at me, darling. You didn't drive through another bodega, did you?
that was you? - What? What?
that was you on the cover of the Post.
you killed that parrot. - No.
mom, what'd I tell you about talking official police business, all right?
sorry. - He had the mustache. I didn't recognize you at first.
see-- [ Whispers ] They took his license away.
there was the third car that he totaled. He even wrecked...
one of those big armored machines, you know, with the battering ram?
who the hell gave him one of those?
he just mowed down three mailboxes like that. That's a federal offense.
mom. - Well, Andy is not a really strong driver.
driving lesson? You call that a driving lesson?
Mmm. Yes. - Dad let go of the wheel and said...
you better steer or else you're going to kill the whole family.
Yeah. It was good for you.
we were going 90. I was six. - That's right.
and that's the way he taught you to swim. - I can't swim either.
well-- - Can we drop it?
okay. Sure. - Okay, Mom. Lock it.
down your-- Down your brassiere it goes.
Oh. Mommy's getting the spins.
Whoo. That's it forme.
real life is a funny thing, you know.
I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life and looking back, regretting the moments we didn't speak out.
when we didn't say I love you.
when we should have say I'm sorry.
so there is a time for silence and there is a time for waiting your turn.
but if you know how you feel and you so clearly know what you need to say, you know it.
I don't think you should wait.
I think you should speak now.
drop everything now
the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and I'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless that should send me running
but I kind of know that I won't get far
and you stood there in front of me
just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see
what I was thinking of
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby
as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
my mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really something
you find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you I know it's no good
and I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby
as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair
and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me
it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you baby
like a firework show
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
drop everything now
take away take away the pain
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
drop everything now
take away take away the pain
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
cause' I see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby
as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see, sparks fly whenever you smile and sparks fly oh baby
you were in college, working part time, waiting tables left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, Can you believe it?
as we're lying on the couch
the moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
flash forward and we're taking on the world together
and there is a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
you said we'd never made my parents' mistakes
but we've got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water?
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
and I remember that fight, 2: 30 a. m.
you said everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying, and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
cause that's all I've ever known
and you took me by surprise
you said I'll never leave you alone
you said, I remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine , we'll make it last You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you believe it?
we're gonna make it now
and I can see it
Oh hello Chicago, Illinois.
my name is Taylor.
and welcome to the Speak Now World Tour.
you know I was sitting in my dressing room a little earlier today.
and uh
I heard you guys screaming through the concrete walls of this arena.
and I thought to myself ...
I thought to myself: nothing says this is going to be an amazing crowd like being able to hear them screaming through concrete walls.
man I just ...
I get so fascinated standing here from this view point.
it's an excellent view of everybody here tonight.
and I can see everyone.
I can see the best friends who came all laid up over there.
I can see you all the way up of the top with the 'SWIFT' light-up sign.
I can...
and I get ...
I get so fascinated by the individual stories in this room.
you know I mean I just think about the fact that you guys who made the 'Long Live' sign back there.
that must have taken hours.
and everyone here who waited in line and piled into the same room to be here tonight.
it's just so fascinating to me.
and I am so thankful because the main story of it all the main story line here is that 13500 of you decide to spend your Friday night with me.
and I was hoping you would be alright with you if I would tell you some of my stories.
are you ready?
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
how we met and the sparks flew instantly
people would say, "they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
now I'm searching the room for an empty seat lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fall out
so many things that I wish you knew
so many walls up I can't break through
now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now
next chapter
how'd we end up this way?
see me nervously pulling at my clothes
and trying to look busy
and you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day
I'll tell the story of us
how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
but you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, we're scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now
can I please see you jump?
this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but I liked it better when you were on my side
the battle's in your hands now
but I would lay my armor down
if you'd say you'd rather love than fight
so many things that you wish I knew
but the story of us might be ending soon
now I'm standing alone
in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now...
and we're not speaking
and I'm dying to know
is it killing you
like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say
since a twist of fate cause we're going down
and the story of us
looks a lot like a tragedy now
the end
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong?
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
and he says...
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date "man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
and when I got home ... before I said amen
asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
had gone all wrong or been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
and the note that said...
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date "man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
and when I got home ... before I said amen
asking God if he could play it again
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song...
cause our song is the slamming screen door
sneaking out late, tapping on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date "man, I didn't kiss her, man I should have
and when I got home ... before I said amen
asking God if he could play it again...
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and I... wrote down our song
you guys are really really loud.
Wow!!!
I love it. I love hanging out with you guys because you're loud and you're daning and you know all the words and you're also very very nice which I appreciate.
you guys are.
you know the nice thing you guys being nice really means a lot to me because in my lifetime I've run into people who aren't quite as nice.
they're in fact more mean.
you, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me
you, have knocked me off my feet again
got me feelin' like a nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
callin' me out when I'm wounded
you, pickin' on the weaker man
you can take me down with just one single blow
but you don't know what you don't know
someday I'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
you, with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you, have pointed out my flaws again
as if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
tryna block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know what you don't know
someday I'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
and I can see you years from now in a bar
talkin' over a football game
with that same big loud opinion but
nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing
all you are is mean
all you are is mean
and a liar
and pathetic
and alone in life
and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
but someday I'll be livin' in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
someday I'll be livin' in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
I'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
you've been good, busier than ever
small talk: work and the weather
your guard is up and I know why
because the last time you saw me will still burn in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and I left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night
and I go back to December all the time
it turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you
wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
these days I haven't been sleepin'
stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
when your birthday passed and I didn't call
and I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side and
I realized I loved you in the fall
and then the cold came, the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night
and I go back to December all the time
it turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you
wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December
turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
so good to me, so right
and how you held me in your arms that September night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
so if the chain is on your door, I understand
and you said
it's too late to apologize, it's too late
you said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night
and I go back to December
it turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you
wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
you said you're not sorry, no oh no oh
and you're not sorry, no oh no oh
hey you're not sorry, no oh no oh
Hey, it's me, leave a message, make it hot
now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer
and, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him
she came along, got him along, and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor did I suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, Whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, Whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha
she lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
and, she thinks I'm psycho
cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, Whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, Whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing I do better than revenge
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him, but I always get the last word
whoa
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, Whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, Whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys on the playground
won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing I do better than revenge
and do you still feel like you know what you're doing
cause I don't think you do, Oh
do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
let's hear the applause
see you deserve some applause
cause you're so much better
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
I am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil ocassion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family all dressed in pastells
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Thiiiiis iiis surely not what you thought it would be
IIIIIII lose myself in a daydream
burst in and say
don't say yes runaway now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
fun gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and I am hiding in the curtains
it seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
Sheeee floats down the aisle like a pagent queen
but IIIIII knooooow you wish it was me
you wish it was me
don't you
don't say yes runaway now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
don't say yes runaway now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
your time is running out
and they said speak now
I hear the preacher say
speak now or forever hold your peace
there's the silence
there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands
all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but I'm only lookin at you
I am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil ocassion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
don't say yes runaway now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
and you'll say let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
baby I didn't say my vows
so glad you were around when they said speak now
let's runaway now
baby I didn't say my vows
so glad you were around when they said speak now
you guys are absolutely unbelievable.
it's like I'm imaging you.
you got amazing. Thank you
you know
I think uh
I think in my mind
I kinda categorize different instruments a sounding like different emotions like like uh for example like for me a cello sounds sad and uh a ukulele I'm playing right now that sounds really happy , don't you think
I got this in howaii a few years ago and uh...
I've always wanted to play for you in a concert
but it felt like...
it felt like if I was gonna play it for you I'd have to play it on a very happy song, don't you think
you know like a song about falling in love or having a best first day of your entire life you know things like that because I feel like I feel like those things not only make you feel happy but they also make you feel fearless
Somethin'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement
you walk me to the car
and you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot
yeah
Hey, hey, hey~
drivin' down the road
wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
you're just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absent mindedly makin' me want you
and I don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and I don't know why but with you I'd dance
in a storm in my best dress
fearless
so baby drive slow
till we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
californian now capture every memory
and I don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and I don't know why but with you I'd dance
in a storm in my best dress
fearless
I won't hesitate no more, no more
it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hey, hey, hey~
cauz I don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and I don't know why but with you I'd dance
in a storm in my best dress
fearless
when I started writing songs when I was about 12
and uh you know back then it kind of started out something that was like more of a hobby
I really liked doing it
and then it became something that was like a daily after-school activity
and then it became all that I ever wanted to do all I ever thought about dreamed about
it became absolutely everything to me
and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making something that means that much to me, a career path
I... uh I tend to write a lot of songs about love and relationships that tends to be the main topic covered
and I think it's because we need music the most when we're feeling things really intensely
and I think the most intense times in your life are when you're either falling in love or losing it
don't you think
and I think...
I think I fall into the category of the hopeless romantics
and I think you do too because you're here
I see the things the tricky thing about us the tricky thing about the hopeless romantics is that when we fall in love with someone when we say hello and it's magical
we never imagined that hello could someday turn into a goodbye
and when we have first kiss with someone and it's magical
we never ever imagine that someday that could turn into a last kiss
I still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 1: 58
the words that you whispered
for just us to know
you told me you loved me
so why did you go
away
away
I do recall now
the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
that July 9th
the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
but now I'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
I still remember
the swing in your step
the life of the party, you're showing off again
and I roll my eyes and then
you pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
but for you I did
because I love your handshake
me and my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day when I don't miss those rude interruptions
but now I'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
so I'll watch you live in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
and I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
and I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are
and I hope the sun shines
and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you
you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in weather and town
but I never planned on you changing your mind
so I'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
just like our last
you know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world.

now that he's back in the atmosphere

he acts like summer and walks like rain
reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
since the return from his stay on the moon
he listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
tell me did you sail across the sun
did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
and that heaven is overrated
tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
one without a permanent scar
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
now that he's back from that soul vacation
tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
he checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
reminds me that there's a wound to grow, hey, hey
now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane
told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
and head back to the Milky Way
and tell me, did Venus blow your mind
was it everything you wanted to find
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
your best friend always sticking up for you
even when I know you're wrong
can you imagine no first dance
freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
the best soy latte that you ever had and . . . me
tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
and head back to the Milky Way
tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
one without a permanent scar
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
na na na ...
Oh...

your best friend always sticking up for you
even when I know you're wrong

you're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset.
she's going off about something that you said
cuz she doesn't, get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story like I do
she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
she's cheer captain
and I'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up
and find what you're looking for
has been here the whole time
if you could see that I'm the one who understands you
been here all along so why can't you see
you belong with me
you belong with me
walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
hey isn't this easy
and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you're fine
I know you better then that
hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
she wears high heels
I wear sneakers
she's cheer captain and
I'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for
has been here the whole time
if you could see that I'm the one who understands you
been here all along so why can't you see
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know
baby...
you belong with me

I remember you drivin' to my house
in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're about to cry
and I know your favorite songs
and you tell me about your dreams
think I know where you belong
think I know it's with me...
if you could see that I'm the one who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time
how could you not know
baby you belong with me
if you could see that I'm the one who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time
how could you not know
baby you belong with me
you belong with me
you belong with me
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me
you belong with me
long were the nights
when my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
prayin' the floor won't fall through, again
my mother accused me of losing my mind
but I swore I was fine
you paint me a blue sky and go back
and turn it to rain
and I lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules every day
wonderin which version of you
I might get on the phone, tonight
well I stopped pickin' up
and this song is to let you know why
dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
don't you think I was too young
to be messed with
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home
I shoulda known.
well maybe it's me
and my blind optimism to blame
maybe its you and your sick need
to give love then take it away
and you'll add my name
to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
and I'll look back in regret
how I ignored when they said
run as fast as you can
dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
don't you think I was too young
to be messed with
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home
dear John
I see it all now it was wrong
don't you think nineteen's too young
to be played by your dark twisted games
when I loved you so
I shoulda known
you are an expert at sorry
and keeping lines blurry
and never impressed by me
acing your tests
all the girls that you run dry
have tired lifeless eyes
cuz you burned them out
but I took your matches
before fire could catch me
so don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town
Oh woah oh
dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
don't you think I was too young
to be messed with
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
don't you think I was too young
to be messed with
the girl in the dress
wrote you a song
you shoulda known
don't you think I was too young
you shoulda known.
there I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired, lonely place
walls of insincerity
Shifiting eyes and vancancy vanished when I saw your face
all I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
your eyes whispered "have we met?
across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
the lingering question kept me up 2 am, who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
now I'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanted to meet you
all I know is I was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
this is me praying that this was the very first page
not where the story line ends
my thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
these are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
please don't have somebody waiting on you
you and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
but I never thought I'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and its all too quiet
and I can't trust anything now
and its comin' over you like its all a big mistake
Oh, holding my breathe, won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold
come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now I'm haunted
stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but I still mean every word I say to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time I'm wishin he was you instead
Oh, holding my breath, won't see you again
something keeps me holding on to nothing
come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now I'm haunted
I know, I know, I just know
you're not gone, you can't be gone
no
come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
won't finish what you started
come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone can't go back
I'm haunted
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
you and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break
never thought i'd see it
this last album "Speak Now" was inspired by a lot of things that happened to me in my life
but one thing that inspired the song was um we went on our very first headlining tour a few years ago
and I used to stand there before
I would go on stage and listen to the crowd making the most amazing magical loud screaming sounds
that is exactly the sound I'm talking about
and I hear and I first of all I ... I would sit there and think
I can't believe I get to hear that sound one time in my life
and uh...
and I would get a melody stuck in my head
and I could never get this melody out of my head until
I finally wrote it into a song
and uh I called that song "Long Live
thank you so much for screaming for us
this song is so completely a hundred percent for you
I say remember this moment
in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age
long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
wishing for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming, this is absurd
cause for a moment a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live the look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall
we have absolutely loved spending time in your town
and you've been so amazing to us
I mean you guys know every single word and you've danced this entire night
and it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage
thank you
and you take a moment
and promise me this:
that you'll stand by me forever
but if god forbid fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children someday
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name
tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how I hope they shine
long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
long, long live the walls we crashed through
all the candlelight shined just for me and you
and I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
fighting dragons with you
long, long live the look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
I can't help but notice this is a very sparkly glittery crowds tonight
I think...
I see some of you brought things light up
what if what if everybody who has like a cellphone or flashlight. I don't know who carries around a flashlight
but if you do could you put it up in the air for me?
Oh that's pretty
you know the thing the thing about life is that every time you learn a new lesson
there is just another one right around the corner
you know, you never know everything
I think you know for me I just kind of giving up and I'm like
I know nothing compared to what I'm going to know some day
and uh I stoped thinking I knew everything a while ago
I think last time I thought I knew everything I was uh... fifteen
you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybodys way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know I haven't seen you around before
cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
feeling like there's nothing to figure out
well count to ten, take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be at fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
and soon enough you're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feeling like flying
and your mama's waiting up and you think he's the one
and you're dancing round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin round well
in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
I didnt know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
but I realized some bigger dreams of mine
Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
but I've found that time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
la la la la la ... la la la la la ... La la la la la...
your very first day
you take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.
la la la la la ... la la la la la ... La la la la la...
your very first day
we were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say hello, little did I know
that you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from Juliet
and I was crying on the staircase, begging you please don't go
and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and I'll be this princess
it's a love story
baby, just say yes
so I sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet cause we've dead if they knew
so close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh, oh
cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said stay away from Juliet
but you were everything of me, I was begging you please don't go
and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
it's a love story
baby, just say yes
Romeo save me try to tell me how it feels
this love is difficult, but it's so real
don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story
baby, just say yes
I got tired of waiting, wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when I met you on the outskirts of town
and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I'll keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head, I don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
and said
marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad you'll pick out a white dress
it's a love story
baby, just say yes
Oh, oh
we were both young when I first saw you
I love you
thanks for watching
you okay?
Thanks.
I... I know you, right?
we... had a class together?
Oh, actually, we've had, like, five classes together.
I better get back in.
whoa.
I feel so dizzy.
come on.
it has been three days since the disappearance of Amy Flynn.
friends and family have launched an all-out search for the 21-year-old senior.
last night, they gathered to pray for Amy's safe return.
Amy's mother, Mary Flynn, had this message for her missing daughter.
Amy, if you can hear me: we love you, baby.
try to be strong.
and I just want to say, to whoever did this:
please, please just let our daughter come home.
police have focused their investigation on this man-- Derrick Adler.
sources say Amy was last seen leaving a campus party with Adler.
officers have searched the 21-year-old suspect's car, but are not saying what they found.
jackpot.
branch, look at this.
he's got over a hundred shots here.
he's been stalking this girl.
he's got dates, times
he catalogs every shot.
arrest him. This is the guy.
there you are.
I'm not late, Steve. It's 8: 15.
I need you to clear your calendar.
I can't, I have a hearing at 10: 00.
not anymore.
I just got a call from Detective Branch.
he's working the Amy Flynn case.
please tell me they found her.
not yet, but they just made an arrest.
apparently, she was being stalked.
Maureen, what do we know?
derrick Adler grew up four blocks from Amy.
this isn't an overnight obsession.
the police say he's been secretly hooked on her since they were in grade school.
does he have any priors? Nothing.
he's invisible.
Adler's one of those people you never even notice.
Yeah, until he decides to kidnap your daughter.
what about Amy? What's her story?
she's the kind of girl you want your daughter to grow up to be.
she did nothing to deserve this.
this one's all over the news, which means the DA's all over me.
he'll want progress reports from our department, so, keep me informed.
I'll get someone to cover your 10: 00 hearing.
Thanks, Maureen·Steve, when you free up,
I want to talk to you about how to handle a drunk-driving fatality.
you got it.
Annabeth, this is big time.
the media, the DA, half the planet is watching on this.
do the police have any idea where she is?
none.
look, you know how this works.
the chances of finding a kidnap victim drop significantly after the first 48 hours.
this girl's been gone for 72.
got it.
they could end up searching for months, digging up fields, draining lakes.
I'll call you from the precinct.
Annabeth, if we have to search, that girl is dead.
you need to get a confession.
ms. Chase, can you give us any new developments on the Flynn case?
anything at all?
can you tell us the latest?
he's been stalking her for over a year.
any statements so far? He denies it.
said he took her home; even walked her to the door.
can we verify that? Negative.
pulled the security feed from the dorm.
he was never anywhere near that building.
so he's lying.
and changing his behavior.
the day after Amy disappeared, he suddenly missed all his classes.
which may give you probable cause to arrest, but I need proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
I know.
look, I know it's all circumstantial, but I'm telling you, he's holding that girl.
you think she's alive?
I know she is.
I've been in Special Victims for seven years. I know the type.
no roommate, no girlfriend.
we have evidence of extreme obsession, with no prior record of violence.
every killer has a first time.
maybe.
look at this.
a tale of obsessive love.
we found it in his apartment.
it's the story of an ordinary guy who kidnaps a girl
not because he wants to hurt her
he wants to possess her.
make her fall in love with him.
put him in interrogation.
Steve, we have a problem.
I picked up a vehicular last night
a drunk driver hit a young father, then crashed his car into a tree.
the victim died.
how's the driver?
he was taken to the hospital, still unconscious.
okay, so all you need to do is get a blood test to prove that the driver was drunk.
that's the problem.
I sent Detective Margate to get the tests.
he never did it.
by the time I realized, it was too late.
the alcohol had metabolized in the driver's system.
we lost our only evidence in a homicide.
I don't get it.
bill Margate is a great detective.
I didn't get it either until I followed up on the driver.
his name is Detective Norman Reed.
the driver was a cop.
16 years on the force.
I think Margate didn't get the test on purpose.
he knew the alcohol would metabolize.
he obstructed justice to save a fellow cop.
okay, let's not jump the gun.
bring him in, let him tell us what happened.
I'm Annabeth Chase.
I'm the deputy prosecuting attorney.
what's happening? Did you find Amy? Do you know where she is?
we're doing all we can.
the police made an arrest this morning.
Yes. We heard on the news that he grew up in our neighborhood.
I checked Amy's yearbooks.
they've been in school together since they were kids, but I never heard her mention him.
what's he being charged with?
nothing yet.
the police arrested him because they think he took Amy.
I think they're right.
but it's my job to decide if there's enough to file formal charges, and right now, we don't have much.
I'm hoping that once we question Derrick...
how long will that take?
can't be sure.
but if he knows where Amy is, we need to break him in the next eight hours.
if we push him any longer than that, a court might find that he was coerced.
he took our daughter.
I don't give a damn about his rights.
please, just find Amy.
I told you... I drove her home.
that's a lie, Derrick.
you see this?
we pulled the security tape.
shows the whole front of the building.
proves you were never there.
Nah, I don't believe you. You're making that up.
I'm making it up?
what about your computer?
pictures of Amy at school, pictures of Amy at the gym.
you were stalking this woman.
look at me! It's over.
you give us dates, times.
now, I've been doing this a long time.
I know extreme obsession when I see it.
it's not a crime to take pictures!
we have more than pictures, Derrick.
why was her sweater still in your car?
why did you miss classes the next day?
it doesn't wash. Someone else kidnaps her, on the night you give her the ride home?
a woman you've been stalking for the last year?
I wouldn't hurt her!
I don't know where she is.
look at those.
now, I got to say, not smart leaving those around your place:
the Collector, The Perfect Victim...
now, why would an innocent guy like you be reading about abducting women?
they're just books.
they're more than just books, Derrick.
you were studying up.
you were learning the trade.
now, we put those books in front of a jury...
you're done.
that's it-- he wants to tell us.
it's not too late.
I... I want...
this is it; he's breaking.
I want a lawyer.
he's playing games.
I thought we had him.
son of a bitch. He knows we can't question him now.
he's guilty. Amy Flynn is alive.
"I wouldn't hurt her." That's what he said.
not "I didn't hurt her," or "I didn't kill her."
and he never made any reference to a body.
he said he didn't know where she is.
I agree, but he gave us nothing.
keep him here. I'll be right back.
it's over. Where you going? To talk to Amy's parents.
it's not over until they say it is.
there she is.
don't get too close, folks.
a shark in her natural habitat.
close the door.
Hi, Billy. How are you?
good, thanks. You?
tell me about Norman Reed.
what about him?
you know what I'm asking.
I instructed you to get a blood test.
you did?
I don't remember that.
you deliberately ignored my order.
you obstructed justice to protect another cop.
take it easy.
I made a mistake.
you don't make mistakes.
I want the truth, Billy.
you're not just a cop.
you are probably the best cop I know.
and, I think, after all these years,
I deserve a straight answer.
on the record...
I made a mistake.
off the record...
Norman Reed's a friend.
a good detective.
damn it, Billy.
he's three months away from retirement.
he's got a family.
so you obstructed justice?
he's a friend, Maureen.
he gave his life for the department.
he put a lot of bad people away.
what good's it going to do to lock him up?
it's not going to bring the victim back.
you're a cop.
you enforce the law.
you don't pick and choose who it applies to.
now you're the one who's not being straight.
we make judgment calls-- that's the job.
sometimes you look extra hard, sometimes...
you look the other way.
not me.
a man is dead, Billy.
he's dead, and you let his killer go.
now you look me in the eye and tell me that was part of the job.
what are you going to do?
arrest me?
Maureen, it's me-- Billy.
half the cases you ever won, we won together.
don't do this.
Mr. Adler asked for a lawyer.
then don't you have to give him one?
not exactly.
the law doesn't guarantee him counsel.
we are allowed to deny his request.
but nothing he says, from now on, can ever be used against him.
then what's the point?
the point is to find your daughter.
we can keep going, but if he tells us where Amy is, his confession can never be used at trial.
a jury will never know about it. I see.
we would also lose any evidence he leads us to.
nothing we find would be admissible at trial.
well, we just want our daughter back.
I know, but I need you to understand the risk.
if we find Amy alive,
I think a court will let her testify to what happened.
so, you could still make a case? Yes.
the risk is... in the other possibility.
but you said you think she's alive.
I can't promise that.
Oh, my God.
if Amy is...
dead, the case will be destroyed.
any evidence we find-- hair, fibers, blood
nothing will be admissible.
and the man who killed your daughter will probably go free.
why... You want us to decide?
Yes.
well, you think you could find her without getting a confession?
I don't know.
right now, the police are trying, but the search could take weeks.
months, even.
what if Amy's hurt, what if...
she has no food or water?
well, what would you do?
I also have a daughter.
and if anything ever happened to her,
I would do whatever it took to find her alive.
then do it.
we trust you.
we're not stopping. What do you mean? He asked for a lawyer.
no problem; I won't use his statement against him.
whoa, wait a second-- you may be destroying the case. This case isn't the priority.
finding that girl .
if Amy's not alive, we're gonna need clean evidence not related to the confession.
tell your men to focus their work on the days before and after the crime.
maybe we should get this cleared first.
no, there's no time for that. We need to get in there now.
I'll do it myself.
in the disappearance of college student Amy Flynn, as the search now enters its 75th hour.
he's all yours.
Thanks.
who are you?
deputy Prosecuting Attorney Chase.
I'm handling your case.
Yeah, well, you need to talk to your people, because I asked for a lawyer.
did you hear me? I want an attorney.
I heard you.
what you don't seem to realize is that I don't care.
you're not getting a lawyer.
you're not getting anything.
in fact, you're not leaving this room until you tell us where to find Amy Flynn.
you can't do that.
look around, Derrick.
you see anyone trying to stop me?
Hey! Detective!
get me out of here!
are you finished?
you want to arrest him?
I don't have a choice.
he basically admitted everything.
this is Billy Margate.
he's a highly respected detective.
meaning what? He can break the law?
of course not.
but I don't think it's wrong to consider the consequences here.
like what?
like Margate has a lot of friends.
if we arrest him, the police could retaliate
stop showing up for court, ignore our orders.
they won't do that.
some of them will.
the DA is up for reelection.
the police are a critical support base.
are we really prepared to alienate our key supporters?
I don't believe this.
hear me out.
arresting Margate will cause trouble.
hearings, headlines...
we could end up in a battle
we could be putting this entire office in danger.
I thought this office was here to seek justice.
then, in the interest of justice, let me ask-- Billy Margate is the lead detective on three pending murder cases.
if we arrest him, we need to disclose that fact.
his credibility will be destroyed.
are we really prepared to risk putting three killers back on the street for this?
don't answer me now.
just think about it.
whatever you decide, I'll back you up.
I need a few minutes, please.
sorry, it's about your drunk driving case.
the victim's family's here to see you.
so, what is this, Derrick, revenge?
you went to school with Amy, for all those years, and she never even knew who you were.
look at this.
is there a problem?
it's the ink from the fingerprints.
I need to wash my hands.
I can help you with that.
but first, you need to help me.
I'm trying to understand...
look, you don't know anything about me.
here's what I know.
if Amy Flynn dies because you sat here inspecting your nails,
I won't rest until you get the death penalty.
are you ready for that?
are you willing to risk execution?
I told you. I wouldn't hurt her.
you are hurting her. She's out there alone.
that's your fault, not mine. Are you kidding?
you're holding her hostage and I'm the one responsible?
Yes! She could be dying, as we speak.
I wouldn't do that!
look.
I love her, okay?
you have the pictures. You know that already.
we went to the precinct.
they told me the driver who killed my husband was a detective.
Yes.
they won't give me any more information.
they keep insisting this was an accident. Mrs. Hayes...
it doesn't make sense.
I saw the intersection. The lighting is fine...
my husband was in the crosswalk.
maybe the driver was drinking or fell asleep at the wheel.
as of now, I don't have any evidence of that.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm a mess.
I just can't believe he's gone.
if you find anything, will you please call me?
of course.
I'll be in touch with you as soon as I can.
I can't get through to him.
we don't have enough leverage.
what am I supposed to do?
I've been pushing him for the last three hours.
nothing. He's enjoying himself. Look at him.
he's always been awkward, invisible.
for once, he has all the power. He's getting what he wants.
that's it. What?
you just said it: Give him what he wants.
I don't understand.
maybe the answer isn't to keep pushing him.
maybe the answer is to stop pushing him.
okay, Derrick, you win.
what?
it's over. You want a lawyer,
I'll have the court arrange for counsel.
don't bother. I'll get my own as soon as I get out of here. Oh, you're not going anywhere.
derrick Adler, you're being charged with the abduction of Amy Flynn.
you'll get a lawyer for your arraignment in 72 hours.
you don't have enough to charge me.
maybe, maybe not.
I say we let the judge decide.
of course, legally,
I don't have to produce you in court for another three days.
wait!
I'm done waiting.
you're making a mistake. Get him out of here.
would you just listen to me a second?
I'm listening.
if I don't get out of here, Amy will die, do you get that?
so she is alive. Yes!
but she won't survive another three days on her own.
then you have a decision to make.
you tell us where she is, or you let her die.
no, you're bluffing.
I have nothing to lose. Detective.
you're killing her! No, you are.
you say you love her, Derrick. How much?
are you ready to kill her?
are you willing to be the reason she died?
okay. Okay.
there's a place up north about two miles from the highway.
this is it! Get the bolt cutters!
got it!
we got her. Get a medic!
I got a pulse! She's alive!
nice work, counselor.
my work just started.
a harrowing end to the search for missing coed Amy Flynn.
she was found here, alive, locked in this storage facility for days.
is it true?
what?
you know what. You questioned Eric Adler after he requested a lawyer.
Yes. Annabeth...
I had to, Steve.
it was the only way to find her alive.
I just got a call from Detective Branch's supervisor.
they have Derrick's prints at the scene.
his skin cells under Amy's fingernails.
they have hair, saliva. I know.
it's all inadmissible.
derrick Adler abducted that girl and he's about to be a free man!
Amy Flynn is alive
she's in a hospital right now, not in some storage locker we never would have found.
and thank God for that.
I did what was necesary, Steve.
then why didn't you call me?
I didn't have time.
you couldn't find three minutes?
I was afraid to, okay?
you want the truth. Fine.
I didn't ask for your permission because I wasn't sure you would give it to me.
you're right.
I wouldn't gamble my entire case without knowing the victim was alive.
I took a risk.
you can't just take a risk!
you and Maureen both need to learn that you are not alone here.
you work for this office.
our boss is an elected official, that means we discuss what we do.
if that girl had died, this would be a scandal.
every paper in the country would be printing how this office set a killer free.
your career would be over.
my career as a supervisor would be over
I'm sorry!
I thought she was alive and I wasn't about to leave her out there because I was worried about our careers!
I should have called, but I did not destroy the case.
we still have Amy's testimony.
I need witnesses who saw the impact.
no, I'm trying to prove he was drunk.
ask the bartender how many drinks he had.
okay, thank you.
everything okay?
in this office? Never.
can I help you?
inspector Gordon Tuft, Internal Affairs.
so...
have you had an affair with anyone internal?
that's just a joke. Sorry.
some people get a little tense when IA comes around.
breaks the ice.
right, well, just conducting a routine inquiry as I'm sure you're aware.
detective Norman Reed was involved in a fatal car accident.
Yes.
taking a look at the file, and I just kept bumping up on the same question:
why didn't you give a blood test to Detective Reed?
I'm sorry.
the DA has a strict policy on commenting on police matters.
if you contact our Integrity Bureau,
I'm sure they can schedule an appointment.
hang on.
I'll tell you what.
look, I don't like red tape, so why don't we just cut through it?
detective Reed has his disciplinary hearing tomorrow.
this is a subpoena.
you don't want to answer me here, you can show up there and do it under oath.
I'm Annabeth Chase.
I'm a prosecutor.
you're the one who found me.
I had a lot of help with that.
Amy, I know you're tired, but I need you to tell me what you remember.
I went to the party.
I got dizzy, so I went outside.
is that where you met Derrick?
he gave me some water.
told me he'd drive me home.
I just felt really sick.
Amy, look at me.
is Derrick the man who kidnapped you?
please tell me what happened.
I can't.
we... we were walking to the car and...
things started to spin.
I must have blacked out.
I don't remember where he took me.
it was dark and, um...
I could feel somebody's breath on me.
I...
I knew somebody was touching me.
did you see his face?
do you remember his voice?
no. I was trying to think.
I was trying to concentrate, but I couldn't.
okay. It's okay.
I can't put her on the stand.
she's all we have; we banked everything on this.
he drugged her.
we have nothing.
when's the hearing?
it starts tomorrow.
fine.
it doesn't sound fine.
it sounds like you're disappointed.
I said I would support your decision.
you call this support?
you're upset.
I'm not upset. Yes, you are.
no, I'm not!
I'm not your father. I'm not disappointed in you.
I'm concerned...
as a prosecutor, as an executive who doesn't want to see his staff in a political war with the police.
since when do politics override justice?
justice for who?
your victim's family?
what about the victims in those murder cases?
not if we lose the next election.
can't do much justice when you're out of a job.
are you ordering me not to testify?
no, I'm not ordering you to do anything.
I'm asking you to see yourself.
you launch yourself into things.
you're never afraid of anything.
the problem is, Maureen, sometimes, there are things to be afraid of.
in this job, doing the right thing can be excruciating.
it can force you to destroy a friend, put your career on the line.
it's hard.
and the fact that you find it so easy...
I never said it was easy.
Hey, why don't you take a break?
I can't.
come on.
you've been at it for hours.
derrick Adler's arraignment is coming up.
I need evidence that's not tainted by the confession.
baby, you saved that girl's life, okay?
if it wasn't for you, they'd still be out there searching.
it's not enough.
what if someone took Haley?
it wouldn't be enough to get her back.
I couldn't sleep every night knowing he was out there, knowing he could do it again.
you can't do this with every case, all right?
you're pushing yourself too hard.
I'm fine.
Jack, I'm fine.
everyone, okay, listen up.
I know you've all been working hard.
my thanks to everyone who jumped in to help.
here's where we are.
any evidence found in the storage locker is out.
we also learned yesterday that the victim's testimony won't meet our burden.
I know this seems impossible, but I think we can still make a case.
at the precinct, I asked you to find independent evidence.
anything that didn't stem from the confession is still fair game.
the good news is we got a jump on this early.
these are the roads Derrick Adler could have taken the night of the crime.
the ones in red have already been covered.
I want every possible stop checked:
gas stations, restaurants...
we're trying, but you're talking about 40 square miles.
I know.
this is our only shot.
we need a witness, a lead.
someone who saw them driving together.
there's something we don't know yet, and we need to find it.
how much time do we have?
I'll be in court in 24 hours.
anything not related to the confession.
we're trying. We just need more time.
we don't have more time.
by law, prosecutors must arraign
derrick Adler today, but sources say the police are still searching for enough evidence to hold him.
this case is marked for arraignment?
Yes, Your Honor, but as you can see, the People have yet to produce my client.
Mr. Adler is being processed, Your Honor.
processed? He's not a wheel of cheese, Ms. Chase.
is he in the building or not?
not yet.
fine. We'll second call his case in 45 minutes. Next.
how much longer?
just a few minutes.
your testimony's next.
don't pay any attention to them.
I didn't expect to see you here.
I said I'd back you up, Maureen.
I meant it.
can you give me a minute?
you really going in there?
they subpoenaed me.
look... I was wrong.
it's too late, Billy.
please. You know me.
not married, no kids. I'm a cop.
job's the only thing I have.
I got a lot of good left in me.
I got a lot of cases left to make.
okay, I let this one slide, but I'll make it up.
what do you want me to do?
I can't lie under oath.
maybe you could say you don't remember.
that's perjury, Billy.
it's corruption.
do you realize what you're asking me?
give me another chance, Maureen.
I'm a good detective.
don't take that away from me.
we're ready.
when was this? About five days ago.
can't say he looks familiar. Well, look again.
he would have come in late. 11: 00, maybe 12: 00.
he might have had a girl with him.
Oh, wait. I do know this guy.
what's this about? His girlfriend?
he had a girlfriend with him?
Hey, uh, look, man, whatever she was on, she didn't get it here.
just tell me what happened.
he came in to pay.
uh, full tank on pump one out front.
he goes to give me the cash, and suddenly, I see his girlfriend getting out of the car.
man, she was out of her mind.
she starts walking out in the middle of traffic...
and you just stood there?
no, I told the guy.
when he saw her, he went white as a ghost.
said she had a few too many; he was taking her home.
she okay?
you got cameras out front?
Yeah, but they don't show much.
I need that tape. Now.
do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
ms. Scofield, I'd like to, uh, if I may, dispense with the usual pleasantries and get right to the point.
fine. As the, uh, prosecuting attorney in this matter, why did you not seek a blood test to determine if Mr. Reed was legally intoxicated?
I did.
sorry, could you say that again?
I did.
I ordered Detective William Margate to get the test.
he ignored my order.
I see. And, uh...
did Detective Margate tell you why he ignored your order?
that test was critical to the prosecution's ability to make a case here.
if he intentionally failed to get it, that would be obstruction of justice and would be of great interest to this panel.
this needs to work.
I can't stall much longer.
I'm coming up on it now.
there he is. That's the car.
is this the only camera angle? We need to see inside.
it's all they had.
okay, he's going in to pay.
Amy must be getting out now.
Oh, we can't see anything.
we can't even prove she was in the car.
wait a second, what was that?
what?
did you see that? Run it back.
freeze it. That-- what is that?
I don't know. Looks like a water bottle.
must be the one he gave Amy.
the one he used to knock her out.
we didn't find it at the storage locker.
that's it. That has to be it.
I'm going back to the gas station.
detective William Margate.
here.
step in, please.
the panel has a few questions for you.
you sure it's in here?
has to be.
trucks don't pick up till the weekend.
this is ridiculous.
my client still isn't here.
I haven't even spoken to him yet.
it's not ridiculous.
we technically have a few more hours to arraign Mr. Adler.
all right, Ms. Chase. Enough is enough.
I want the defendant here.
your Honor, may I be heard? No, you may not.
Mr. Reynolds, confer with your client when he arrives.
as for you, Ms. Chase, you've wasted this court's time all day.
I will give you until exactly 5: 00.
that's three hours from now.
we've got 12 bottles. I'm taking them to the lab right now.
let me know as soon as you hear.
you really think one of these is the answer?
I'd say our chances are one in 12.
I'm sorry.
the blood test was never done.
by waiting too long, Detective Margate destroyed any evidence of intoxication.
so the driver, he just walks away?
no.
I've started a larger investigation.
there may be a witness to the accident, someone who saw him drunk at the bar.
I won't give up.
what about Detective Margate?
he testified at the hearing.
the panel didn't believe his statement and he will be forced to resign
in the meantime, this office is filing criminal charges.
thank you.
for my husband.
you a baseball fan?
what? You like baseball?
uh, yes.
well, in baseball terms, I'd say we just turned a triple play.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
it's after 5: 00. We have rules, Ms. Chase.
but from what I hear, you're not interested in rules.
if I could just explain. Don't bother.
Mr. Reynolds has been filling me in.
he claims you deliberately violated his client's right to counsel-- is that true?
Yes. Yes?
then you realize the defendant's confession is out.
I do.
and all the other evidence obtained as a result.
I read the file and while I may personally wish I could rule different, the law is very clear.
I'm holding everything found at the storage unit inadmissible.
I understand.
then help me understand.
from what I see, you have almost no other evidence.
give me one good reason why I shouldn't release Mr. Adler and dismiss these charges.
I have that reason right here.
this is the bottle the defendant used to drug Amy Flynn.
objection, that evidence is fruit of the poisonous tree.
it was derived from the confession. No, it wasn't.
the defendant never said anything about a bottle.
he never said he drugged the victim.
we learned about this from Amy herself.
Yes, and you found Amy because of the confession.
hold on, Mr. Reynolds.
the physical evidence is out, but the victim's independent opportunity to observe is still in play.
the defendant's palm print is on this bottle.
inside, we found traces of Rohypnol, the drug found in Amy's bloodstream.
we also found her salvia on the lip.
judge: Let me be clear.
the defendant never mentioned this. Never.
we were very careful, Your Honor.
this was a separate investigation.
your Honor, I...
save it, Mr. Reynolds.
she's got you. I'd like to hear your client explain that bottle to a jury.
the defendant is held without bail.
Mr. Adler, I am remanding you to the custody of the correctional system.
it won't be pleasant.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
listen, about the other day...
Steve, it's okay.
you were right; I shouldn't have made the decision without you.
true.
but I've been thinking about why I reacted the way that I did.
it's okay.
no, it's not.
I was thrown.
not because of what you did, but maybe because it never even occurred to me.
I've been doing this for so long, the only thing I see is the case.
I've taught myself to see the process, not the people involved in it.
the truth is, when Derrick Adler asked for a lawyer,
I'd have stopped.
and a girl would be dead.
don't ever lose that, Annabeth.
don't ever stop seeing the people.
Amy Flynn is back home tonight, with he family.
meanwhile, Derrick Adler faces life in prison.
I think about those parents...
...who never found their child, never got to bring them home.
Oh, if I ever lost you...
...I would search to the ends of the earth.
hey...
nobody's losing anybody.
movie Fan News presents:
spotlight on "Adventure."
what you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity, a lost world in South America, lurking in the shadow of Majestic Paradise Falls it's full of plants and animals undiscovered by science.
who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit?
why, our subject today, Charles Muntz.
the beloved explorer lands his dirigible, "The Spirit of Adventure," into New Hampshire, completing a year long expedition to the lost world.
this mighty aircraft was designed by Charles Muntz himself and is longer than 22 throw edition petty wagons placed end to end.

adventure is out there!
but what has Muntz brought back this time?
gentlemen, I give you the Monster of Paradise Falls!
and gully, what a swell monster this is!
but what's this? Scientists cry "Foul"!
the National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton.
No!
the organization strips Muntz of his membership.
humiliated, Muntz vows to return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive.
I promise to capture the beast alive!
and I will not come back until I do!
and so, the explorer's off to clear his name.
bon voyage, Charles Muntz!
and good luck capturing the Monster of Paradise Falls!

are you in need of any assistance today, Sir?
no.
I could... help you cross the street.
no.
I could help you cross your... yard?
no.
I could help you cross your... tribe.

... squad lodge 12. - Kid!
are you in need of any assistance? - Thank you, but I don't need any help!
proceed.
good afternoon.
skip to the end!
see these? These are my wilderness explorer badges.
you may notice one is missing.
it's my "Assisting the elderly badge."
if I get it, I'll become a senior wilderness explorer!
the wilderness must be explored!
it's gonna be great!
there is a big ceremony and all the dads come and...
they pin on our badges...
so you wanna assist an old person. - Yeah!
then I'll be a senior wilderness explorer!
have you ever heard of a "snipe"? - "Snipe"?
a bird. Big eyes.
every night it sneaks into my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas.
I'm elderly and infirm.
I can't catch it.
if only someone could help me... - Me, me, I'll do it!
I don't know, it's awfully crafty.
you'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in.
I'll find her, Mr. Fredricksen!
I think its burrow is two blocks down...
two blocks down. Got it!
snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...
bring it back here when you find it!
OK，keep it coming...

Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?
I am so sorry, Sir.

I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
<b> south AMERICA</b>
we are on our way, Ellie.
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.
it's me, Russell.
what are you doing out here, kid?
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch.
but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.
please, let me in.
no.
Aw, all right. You can come... in.
I've never been in a floating house before.
Goggles... Look at this stuff!
are you going on a trip?
"paradise Falls, a land lost in time."
are you going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen?
don't touch that! You'll soil it.
you know, most people take a plane.
but you're smart, because you have your TV, clocks and stuff.
ooo, is this how you steer your house?
does it really work?
this makes it turn right and that way is left.
Hey, look! Buildings!
that building's so close, I can almost touch it!
wow, this is great!
you should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.
look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away!
Hey, I can see your house from here!
don't jerk around so much, kid!
well, that's not gonna work.
I know that cloud, it's a "cumulonimbus."
did you know that a cumulonimbus...
aaa, I stayed up all night blowing upballoons... for what? - that's how you get lightning
that's nice, kid.
what are you doing over there?
look!
see? Cumulonimbus.
my bag!
got you!
Uuu, I thought you were dead.
what happened?
I steered us. I did it! I steered the house.
you steered us?
after you tied your stuff down, you took a nap.
so I went ahead and steered us down here.
Yeah, sure.
I can't tell where we are.
o, we're in South America all right.
it was a singe. I used my wilderness explorer GPS.
GP... what?
my dad gave it to me.
it shows exactly where we are on the planet.
with this baby we'll never be lost!
we'll get you down, find a bus stop, and you'll just tell the man you want to get back to your mother.
sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls.
there, that ought to do it.
there, I'll give you some change for the bus fare.
no, I'll just use my city bus pass.
it's just gonna be like a billion passes to get back to my house.
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?
well, we're up pretty high.
it'll take hours to get down.
I think that was a building or something.
what was that, Mr. Fredricksen?
we can't be close to the ground yet.
wait, no, no!
wait, wait!
hang on!
pull back!
where... where are we?
this doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
don't worry, Ellie. I've got it.
there it is!
Ellie, it's so beautiful!
we made it!
we made it! Russell, we can float right over there.
climb up, climb up!
do you mean... assist you?
Yeah, whatever. - Ok, I'll climb up!
watch it! - Sorry.
now... when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up.
got it?
are you on the porch yet?
what? That's it?
I came all this way here to get stuck on the wrong end of this rock pile?
Ah... great.
Hey, if I could assist you over there...
would you sign up for my badge?
what are you talking about?
we could walk your house to the fall.
walk it? - Yeah.
after all we weigh it down, we could walk it right over there.
like a parade balloon.
now, we'll walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash dancing.
we have three days at best till the helium leaks out of those balloons.
and if we are not at the falls when that happens...
we're not getting to the falls.
I found sand!
don't you worry, Ellie.
we'll get our house over there.
it is fun already, isn't it?
by the time we get there, You're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the wilderness explorer call.
wait, why are we going to Paradise Falls, again?
Hey, let's play a game.
it's called: "See who can be quiet the longest."
cool! My mom loves that game!
darn thing...
come on, Russell, hurry it up.
Ah, I'm tired.
my knee hurts.
which knee?
my elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.
I asked you about that five minutes ago.
I didn't have to go then!
I don't wanna walk anymore...
please, stop...
Russell, if you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you.
there are no tigers in South America.
zoology.
Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on into the bushes and do your business.
OK. Here! Hold my stuff!
I've always wanted to try this.
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose to dig the hole before or after?
that's none of my concern.
Oh, it's "before"!
tracks?
snipe.
here, snipe.
come on out, snipe.
snipe!
got you. Don't be afraid, little snipe.
I am a wilderness explorer, so I'm a friend to all of nature.
want some more?
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.
come on out.
come on. Come on...
don't be afraid, little snipe.
nice snipe. Good little snipe.
nice... giant snipe!
I found the snipe.
Oh, did you?
are they tall? - Oh, yes. They're very tall.
do they have a lot of colors?
they do, indeed.
do they like chocolate? - Oh, yeah...
chocolate?
what is that thing?
it's a snipe.
there no such thing as a snipe!
but you said...
go on, get out of here! Go!
careful, Russell.
look, Mr. Fredricksen, he likes me.
Russell! - No, stop! That tickles!
get out of here! Go on! Get!
no, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.
Mr. Fredricksen is nice.
Kevin? - Yes, that's the name I just gave him.
bit it, boo, scram!
Hey, that's mine!
Aah... Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!
go on, bit it!
can we keep him? Please?
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers...
no.
an explorer is a friend to all, be it a plant, a fish or a tiny mole.
that doesn't even rhyme.
Yeah, it does.
Hey, look, Kevin. - What?
Hey, get down from there! You're not allowed up there!
you come down here right now!
can you believe this, Ellie?
Ellie?
Hey, Ellie, can I keep the bird?
Aha... aha
she said for you to let me.
but I told him no. I told you no.
n - O!
I see you, back there.
go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while.
Hey, are you ok over there?
Hello?
Oh, hello, Sir. Thank Goodness.
it's nice to know someone else is up here.
I can smell you.
what?
you can... smell us?
I can smell you.
you were talking to a rock.
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.
look at that one! That one looks like a dog!
Ah, it is a dog. - What?
we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment.
Hey, I like dogs!
we have your dog!
I wonder whom he belongs to. - Sit, boy.
Hey, look, he's trained!
shake.
Aha. Speak.
Hi, there.
did that dog just say "Hi, there"?
Oh, yes!
my name is Dug. I just met you and I love you.
my master made me this collar.
he is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk. Squirrel!
my master is good and smart.
it's not possible.
Oh yes... It is... because my master is smart.
Hey, cool! What do these do, boy?
would you cut... I'd use that collar... I would be happy if you stopped.
Russell, don't touch that.
it could be... radioactive or something.
I am a great tracker. My master sent me on a special mission.
all by myself. Have you seen a bird?
I want to find one and I've been on a scent.
I'm a great tracker. Did I mention that?
Hey, that is a bird. I have never seen one up close. But this is the bird.
may I take your bird up to camp as my prisoner?
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog.
I can bark... And here's howling.
can we keep him, please? Please, please, please?
no. - But it's a talking dog!
it's just a weird trick or something.
let's get to the fall.
please, be my prisoner! Oh, please oh, please, be my prisoner!
Oh, here it is! I picked up the bird's scent!
wait a minute, wait a minute. What is this?
chocolate. I smell chocolate.
I'm getting prunes and ginger cream.
who are they?
Oh, man, the master will not be pleased.
we'd better tell him someone took the bird, right, Alfa?
no. Soon enough the bird will be ours again.
find the scent, my compadres, and you too, shall have much rewarding from the master for the toil that you did.
Hey, Alfa, I think there's something wrong with your collar.
you must have broken it.
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.
beta, Delta!
perhaps you deSire... Squirrel!
perhaps you deSire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning.
no, no. No.
but maybe Dug would. You might wanna ask him.
I wonder if he's found the bird on his "very special mission."
do not mention Dug to me at this time.
his fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied, indeed.
do you not agree with that which I'm saying to you now?
sure. But the second the master finds out that you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat.
you're unwise, my trusted lieutenant.
this is Alfa. Calling Dug. Come in, Dug.
Hi, Alfa. Your voice sounds funny.
I know, I know!
have you seen the bird?
Oh, yes. The bird is my prisoner now.
Yeah, right.
impossible. Where are you?
I am here with the bird and I will bring it back, and then you like me. Oh, gotta go.
dug, who are you talking to?
wait, wait! - What is Dug doing?
why is he with the small mailman?
where are they?
there he is. Come on!
please, oh, please, be my prisoner.
dug, stop bothering Kevin!
that man over there says I can take the bird.
and I love that man there like he is my master.
I am not your master!
I am warning you once again, bird!
Hey, quit it! - I am jumping on you now, bird!
at this rate we will never get to the falls!
I am nobody's master, got it?
I don't want you here and I don't want you here!
I'm stuck with you!
if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three...
a ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy, a ball!
ball? You want a ball?
Yes, I do! I ever so want the ball!
go get it!
Oh, boy, I will get it and then bring it back!
quick, Russell, give me some chocolate.
Why? - Just give to me!
bird! Bird!
come on, Russell.
wait! Wait, Mr. Fredricksen!
what are you doing?
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.
I think that did the trick.
Hi, master.
afternoon.
well, thanks for keeping us dry, anyway, Ellie.
which one is the front?
well, boy...
is this step three or step five?
there.
all done. That's for you.
well, tents are hard.
wait, aren't you super wilderness guy with the GPS and the badges?
Yeah, but...
can I tell you a secret?
no. - All right. Here it goes.
I never actually built a tent before. There! I said it.
you've been camping before, haven't you?
well, never outside...
well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent?
I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.
try him sometime, maybe he'll surprise you.
he's away a lot, I don't see him much.
he's gotta be home sometime.
I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.
Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
Phyllis isn't my mom. - Oh!
but he promised he'd come to my Explorers Ceremony to pin on my "Assisting the elderly badge."
so he can show me how about the tent then, right?
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?
we don't want to wake the travelling flea circus.
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner.
we have to protect him.
can Kevin go with us?
all right, he can come.
promise you won't leave him?
Yeah.
cross your heart?
cross my heart.
what have I got myself into, Ellie?
good morning, sweetheart.
we'd better get moving.
the bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice.
all right, everybody up!
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
dug, find Kevin! - Find the bird, find the bird!
point!
Oh, look! There he is...
point!
Hey, that's my food! Get off my roof!
Yeah, get off of his WROOF!
what is he doing?
the bird is calling to her babies.
her babies!
Kevin is a... girl?
her house is over there, in those twisty rocks.
she's been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them.
wait, Kevin is just leaving.
but you promised to protect her.
her babies need her. We gotta make sure they're together.
sorry, Russell. We've lost enough time already.
yeah...
it was her favorite chocolate.
because you sent her away, there's more for you.
Kevin?
Where's the bird? You said you had the bird!
Oh, yes, oh, yes. If I had said that,
I can see how you would think that.
where is it?
Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and then I will again have the bird. Yes.
you lost it. why do I not have a surprised feeling?
well, at least you now have led us to the small mailman and to the one that smells as prunes.
the master will be most pleased we have found them.
he will ask them many questions. Come.
wait! We're not going with you.
we're going to the fall.
get away from me!
stay!
you came here... in that?
Yeah.
in a house? A floating house?
that is the darnest thing I've ever seen!
you're not after my bird, are you?
but if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!
well, this is all a misunderstanding.
my dogs made a mistake.
wait. Are you Charles Muntz?
well... yes.
the Charles Muntz?
adventure's out there!
it's really him!
that's Charles Muntz!
it is?
who's Charles Muntz?
him!
Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans.
Oh, well, you're a man of good taste.
now you must be tired. Hungry?
attention, everyone! These people are no longer intruders.
they are our guests.
all right! I like you temporarily.
I will not bite you.
the small mailman smells like chocolate!
I'm sorry about the dogs,
I hope they weren't too... rough on you.
go ahead and pull your airship right next to mine.
we are not actually going inside the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?
Oh, would you like to?
would I?
wait up, Mr. Muntz!
Jiminy Cricket!
not you! - What do we do with Dug?
he lost the bird. Put him in "the cone of shame."
I do not like "the cone of shame."
most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums:
new York, Munich, London.
of course, I kept the best for myself.
did you ever. Look at that!
Oh, yes. The Arsinoitherium.
the beast charged while I was brushing my teeth.
I used my shaving kit to bring it down.
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.
the only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared dental equipment.
Oh, my Gosh! The giant Somalian Labradoodles!
Oh, you recognize it? I'm impressed!
there's an interesting story there.
excellent choice.
I found it on safari, with Roosevelt
he and I fell into a habit of playing Gin Rummy in the evenings and did he cheat!
he was horrible.
master, dinner is ready.
Oh, dear, broken translator.
I think it's that loose wire again.
there you go, big fellow. - Thank you, master.
I liked his other voice.
well, dinner is served.
right this way.
so, how are things States side?
almost tempted to go back a few times.
but I have unfinished work here.
please! I hope you're hungry.
because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had.
epsilon, you've done it again!
my Ellie would have loved all these.
you know, because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by the fall.
I'm honored. And now you've made it.
you sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose.
no, no, it's a pleasure to have guests.
a real treat.
treat?
Where's my treat? I want my treat!
Hey!
I shouldn't have used that word.
having guests is a delight!
more often I get thieves trying to steal what is rightfully mine.
no...
they called me a fraud, those...
but once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared.
beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, I've spent a lifetime tracking it.
sometimes, years go by between sailings.
I've tried to smoke it out of that death land where it lives.
can't go in after it.
once in, there's no way out.
I lost so many dogs.
here they come those bandits and think the bird is theirs to take!
they'll soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place.
Hey, that looks like Kevin!
Kevin? - Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!
I trained it to follow us.
follow you?
impossible. How?
she likes chocolate.
chocolate?
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes gaga for it.
but it ran off.
let's go now.
you know, Carl...
these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories
a surveyor making a map...
a botanist cataloguing plants...
an old man taking his house to Paradise Falls.
that's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends.
well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going.
you're not leaving.
we don't want to take advantage of your hospitality.
come on, Russell.
but we haven't even had dessert yet.
Oh, the boy is right.
you haven't had dessert.
epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee.
you really must stay! I insist!
we have so much more to talk about!
Kevin?
it's here.
get them!
Hurry! - Kevin!
dogs! They are coming!
master! Over here!
go toward the mine, master!
left!
Russell!
get back!
go on, master! I will stop the dogs!
stop, you, dogs!
help!
give me your hand!
hang on to Kevin!
Kevin!
no, no, no. Kevin...
stay down.
she's hurt real bad.
can't we help her get home?
all right. But we gotta hurry.
you lost them? - No, it was Dug.
Yeah, he's with them. he helped them escape!
wait. Wait a minute.
dug.
see anything? - No, my pack is not following us.
boy, they are dumb!
this is crazy.
I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us.
what a joke. - Hey, I know a joke!
a squirrel walks up up to a tree and says:
I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead."
it is funny because the squirrel gets dead.
careful, Russell.
you ok, Kevin?
you know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
the wilderness isn't quite what I expected.
yeah? How so?
it's kind of... wild.
I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book.
get used to that, kid.
my dad made it sound so easy.
he is really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff...
he used to come to all my squad lodge meetings.
and afterwards, we go get ice-cream at fentons.
I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle.
then we sit on this one curb, right outside and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones and whoever gets the most wins.
I like that curb.
it might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.
look, there it is!
hold on, Russell, stand still.
look at that bird go! Wait up, you overgrown chicken!
that's it! Go, Kevin! Go find your babies!
run, Kevin, run!
Oh, no!
Russell, give me a knife!
get away from my bird!
No!
No!
careful, I want it in good shape for my return.
let her go!
stop!
Kevin!
you gave away Kevin.
you just... gave her away.
this is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of these!
master, it's all right.
I am not your master!
if you hadn't shown up, none of these would have happened.
bad dog, bad dog!
whether you assist me or not,
I am going to Paradise Falls, if it kills me!
here
I don't want this anymore.
thanks for the adventure - now go have a new one! love ! Ellie
Russell?
Russell! - I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't!
no, Russell, no!
Russell?
I was hiding under your porch because I love you.
can I stay?
can you stay? Well, you're my dog, aren't you?
and I'm your master.
you're my master?
Oh, boy! - Good boy, Dug!
you're a good boy!
Yes!
don't worry, Kevin, I'll save you.
and they wouldn't believe me.
just wait till they get a look at you!
master.
the small mailman has returned.
what?
let me go!
where is your elderly friend?
he's not my friend anymore.
if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind.
where are you keeping Kevin?
let me go!
scream all you want, small mailman.
none of your mailmen friends can hear you.
I will unleash all my wilderness explorer training!
Alfa, Fredricksen is coming back!
guard that bird.
if you see the old man, you know what to do.
where are you going? I'm not finished with you!
nice talking with you.
where are you, Fredricksen?
help!
Russell!
Mr. Fredricksen! - Dug, bring her over!
you came back for Kevin! Let's go get her!
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.
but I wanna help! - I don't want your help.
I want you safe.
how do we get pass these dogs?
point!
Kevin!
don't worry, Kevin. We are on our way.
no one should be entering through these doors.
guard well that bird, my minions.
what do we do now, Dug?
who wants the ball?
me, me, me!
go get it!
I got it!
I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's get you out of here.
master, he's gone. - What's going on?
he's got the bird! - He ran off!
calm down! One at the time!
I want to... help!
does anybody know where they are?
raid leaders! Bring down that house!
raid leader! Checking in!
raid 2, checking in. - Raid 3, checking in.
target sighted.
come on, Kevin.
Hi.
any last words, Fredricksen?
come on, spit it out!
enough!
you are not taking that bird and leaving me...alive!
you're dead!
come on, Kevin.
I'll have plenty of enjoyment for what I'm about to do to you.
he wears the cone of shame!
not just continue sitting! Attack!
No! No! Stop your laughing!
listen, you, dog, sit!
Yes, Alfa.
Alfa? I am not Alfa, he is... Oh!
I can't do it.
Russell...
you leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
Hey! Squirrel! - Squirrel? Where?
I hate squirrels!
dug! - Master!
Russell, over here!
let's go!
Mr. Fredricksen!
come on, Kevin.
No!
Russell, get out of there!
leave them alone!
Russell, hang on to Kevin! Don't let go! Grab on to him!
Kevin! Chocolate!
that was cool!
don't jerk around so much, kid.
easy, Russell.
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.
sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen.
you know... It's just a house.
look at you! You're so soft!
I wish I could keep one.
where is my cane? I just had it here.
you know what? Keep them. A little gift from me to you.
Bye, Kevin!
ready? - Ready.
by receiving their badges, the following explorers will graduate to Senior Explorers.

congratulations, Jimmy.

I'm here for him.
congratulations, Russell. Sir.
Russell, for assisting the elderly and for performing above and beyond the call of duty,
I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow.
<b> "the Ellie badge."</b>
I think that covers everybody. so let's give a big explorer call to our brand new Senior Wilderness Explorers!

[Man Narrating] As I've gotten older, I realize I'm certain of only two things.
days that begin with rowing on a lake are better than days that do not.
second, a man 's character is his fate.
and, as a student of history, I find this hard to refute.
for most of us, our stories can be written long before we die.
there are exceptions among the great men ofhistory, but they are rare, and I am not one of them.
I am a teacher-- simply that.
I taught for 34 years.
one day I stopped teaching.
those were the facts of my life's chronicle.

Mr. Bell also wanted me to tell you he's added an event...
on the morning following the competition
a breakfast in your honor.
Mr. Hundert? Yes-- Yes.

the others will be heading down to the bar in 20 minutes, sir.
uh, very well. Twenty minutes.
in the bar. I'll be there.
[Hundert's Voice ] I couldn't tell you exactly why l had agreed to come.
I'm not sure I knew. It had something to do with hope.
the young men that were gathering here were among...
the most successful and influential of their generation.
but I knew them before any of that.
I knew them as my students at Saint Benedict's School for Boys.

Ex-excuse me. Huh? What me?
Yes, sir. What is your name? Uh, Louis.
just Louis? - Louis Masoudi, sir.
Mr. Masoudi, could you define the word "path" for me?
well, there are several definitions, I suppose.
would "a route along which someone or something moves" be among them?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. No. Yeah. I'm s-sorry, sir.

Yes, sir. It's, uh-- It's better for the grass.

Mr. Woodbridge let slip that you were instrumental in my procuring this job.

I'm fine. You sure you're all right?
Ye-Yeah.
what did you think of Athens? oh. I loved it.
I knew you would. Tony hated it, but you know the British.
too many Greeks." [ Laughs ]
Tony's Tony. Here.
I told the man in the store I wanted something...
for a very serious scholar of antiquity.
the Parthenon.
it's smaller than I remember it. - [ Laughs ]
I don't have one of these. Thankyou.
I found it in the agora.
Tony couldn't understand why I wanted to go there. It's a little touristy now, but I kept hearing your voice in my head.
and I kept seeing it exactly the way you described it, with Socrates teaching right in front of me.
and... there was Tony, falling asleep from the heat and ouzo, and me eating my shish kabob.
I thought about you a lot. Um
I wished you were there. - It would've been a little odd though...
with you and me and Socrates...
and your sleeping husband.
Yeah. A little.
[Hundert] And with the monarchy's demise, two newsystems...
of government-- the first, ruled by the few, known as?
Mr. Brewster. Uh, tyranny?
in spirit, perhaps, but etymologically, no.
more precisely, oligarchy.
tyranny is what we have in this classroom. It works. [ Laughing ]
Mr. Bllythe? Antisthenes: "We must have richness of soul.
Oh, it was, uh, Heraclitus, when he said a man's character is his fate or-or his destiny.
precisely. "Not to know what happened before you were born is to be forever a child.
[Woodbridge ] Mr. Julius Caesar is a Saint Benedict's tradition.
it is a contest held each year in two phases.
the first, is a series of quizzes...
that will narrow the field of competitors to three.
the second is a public tournament...
where these three will take the stage at Saint Benedict's Hall...
and answer questions about Roman history.
the last man standing will be declared the winner...
and crowned Mr. Julius Caesar.
your father was a winner was he not, Mr. Bllythe? - Yes, sir.
Mm-hm. Would you point him out to us, please?
[ Woodbridge ] Ah.
a noble honor indeed.
well, carry on, gentlemen.
thank you, Mr. Woodbridge.
finally, Caesararrives at the Rubicon, a small little river which divides-- Mr. Field?
cisalpine Gaul from Italy. Correct.
he gathers his one legion around him. A legion comprised of how many men-- Mr. Grey?
6, 000? 6, 000 men. Pompey has 10 legions...
with the support of the Senate, and Caesar is undaunted by these odds.
Suddenly-- impulsively
Caesar cries out! Mr. Mehta.
Aleajacta est. - "The die is cast!
he crosses the Rubicon only to find his enemies have fled.
he chases Pompey all around the Mediterranean.
finally, he arrives in Alexandria, where the king of Egypt
Mr. Masoudi? - Ptolemy XIII?
Ptolemy XIII... presents him with a gift
the head of Pompey. [ Knocking]
Mr. Hundert,
I 'd like you to make the acquaintance of Mr. Sedgewick Bell.
pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bell.
well then, carry on, Mr. Hundert.
nice to meetyou, son. Thankyou, sir.
gentlemen, I'd like you to welcome a new member of our class,
Mr. Sedgewick Bell. [ overlapping Greetings ]
come in.
the sign said this was a boy's school.
it is a boy's school. - So why is everyone wearing dresses?
[ scattered Laughter] - These are not dresses.
this is a toga. It is a loose outer garment worn by citizens of ancient Rome. I know.
I was just... kidding with you. - [ Laughing ]
the toga was bestowed on young men in recognition of their transition from childishness to manhood.
so?
please. Come in. Sit down.
have a seat here behind Mr. Brewster.
you know what? I actually think that I'm good here.
Mr. Bell.
Mr. Hundert.
have a seat.
now, uh, before I forget, tomorrow we will begin on Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
I expect you all to be familiar with the play.
Mr. Bell, I'd like you to look at the role of Brutus, the noblest Roman of them all.
Mr. Masoudi, you have a lean and hungry look, you'll read the part of Cassius.
he's the son of Hyram Bell, the senior senator from West Virginia.
well, whoever the father is, the son is a bit of a Visigoth, I'm afraid.
is he that bad? No, I don't think so.
it's just new school bravado. That's all. He'll be fine.
Sedgewick?
right. Sedgewick.
Hey! Se-Sedgewick.
um, some of us were just, uh
just wondering, uh
actually, Martin-- Martin was wondering if you could keep it down.
he's trying to study.
okay. All right. That's
I think it is not meet MarkAntony, so well-beloved of Caesar, "should outlive Caesar.
our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, "to cut the head off then hack the limbs.
like wrath in death--" [ Snorts, Coughs ]
and envy afterwards, for Antonyis but a limb of Caesar.
let us be sacrificers, but not butchers.
[Hundert ] "Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers.
Yes, your Brutus lacks conviction, Mr. Bell.
you do realize what you're saying? The fate of the Republic is at stake!
[ laughs ] Not for me.
no. I realize that.
but try to imagine the significance of the moment.
you, Brutus, are at the center of a conspiracy...
to kill Julius Caesar, you believe, for the good of Rome.
yet you're struggling profoundly with the moral implications...
of murdering MarkAntony as well.
Yeah, but I don't agree with their plan.
Brutus doesn't agree with their plan?
no. I don't agree with their plan.
they should kill MarkAntony，too.
I mean, Brutus is a pussy. [ Laughing ]
a pussy"?
because he has a conscience?
because he believes there's a right way and a wrong way? oh, come on.
Antony ended up taking him down, right?
well, in a manner of speaking, yes.
he and octavius, but-- But what?
had they killed him, as the other guy suggested, uh
Cassius. - Yeah. Him. If they'd done what he said, - Brutus might have gone on to be king. - Emperor, in fact.
exactly. - Which he had no desire to be.
whatever. He would've won. - Yes, but at what cost? Remember Socrates?
not really. [ Chuckles ]
it is not living that is important, but living rightly.
socrates chose to die by unjust execution...
rather than break the laws of Athens to which he had pledged obedience.
another genius. [Bell Rings ]
William, hold up!
Ellerby. How are you, sir?
very well. How are things in the Latin Quarter?
could not be happier.
for making me feel so much at home.
I'm sureyou have it, but you might like it 'cause it's a first edition.
I found it in a rare bookshop next to a copy of the oresteia. oh, really?
so young when he wrote this.
I happen to have attended a guest lecture he gave at Dartmouth.
Really? Yeah.
it must have been something to grow up around all that talent.
Oh, it was. Indeed.
yes-- Yes, he was-- [Bell Tolling]
thank you. Sure.
very kind of you. Farewell. I'll see you later.
okay. Fio. - [ Both ] I am made. I become.
fis. [Dooropening]
Hey, guys.

what do you mean by "hair"?
Oh, my God.

uh, can I point out that if we get caught around any of this we're dead?
I mean, seriously, we're dead. - It'll be all right.
[ scoffs ] I'm going to my room to study.
here, Marty. Study this. - [ All Laughing ]
the die is cast.
Mrs. Louis Masoudi. [Sedgewick Laughs ]
[Martin ] Why are we doing this? Myallergies are killing me, rocks in my shoes, poison ivy all over the place.
I mean, the boathouse is off-limits, and we can't leave school property.
what if this boat has frickin' holes in it, huh?
[ Louis ] Get over it, Martin. oh, God!
you guys just don't understand the consequences.
they catch us and we get kicked out and we don't get our tuition back.
[ Deepak] Martin, mellow out, man! I can't just mellow out!
I cannot get kicked out of here! I'm a "legacy" for Christ's sake!
my father was Mr. Julius Caesar.
did he ever tell you what question he won on? Did he ever not tell me?
which tribes invaded Rome in 1 02 B. C?
teutons and the Cimbri.
the last words out of his mouth before he dropped me off here.
so, uh, Martin,
Dareyou really, like, Nervous about-- ohh!
[FirecrackerExplodes ] Watch out, Marty.
my informants tell me if we head for that place-- Right, Saint Mary's?
Yeah! - No, no, no, no, no.
the penalty for setting foot on Saint Mary's property-- [ Yells ]
what do you say, Deepak? You want to go? Yeah. I'll go.
Louis? Yeah. I'll go.
see, Martin? That's the problem with democracy.
[Martin ] Guys, I'm really nervous. [Louis ] Yeah. We know.
I love uniforms. I-I really think we should turn around.
[ Deepak ] Shut up, man. [ Gi rls' Voices, I ndisti nct ]
[ giggling ] [ Martin ] Seriously, we got to turn around right now.
this is not safe! [ Louis ] Marty, shut up. Shut up.
[ Sedgewick ] Hey, come on. Easy does it, boys.
H i. [ Laughs ]

he's our "coxman," so-- [ Girl] Coxswain.
right. No. Right, I know. Coxswain.
so is it true what they say about the guys who go...
to "Saint Benedick's"? [ Laughing ]
I don't know. Uh, what is that exactly?
tsk. So, uh, what's your name?
um, I'm Sedgewick. This is Deepak.
Louis and Martin. Hi.
Marty, if you like. or Mar-Martin's fine.
why don't you give us your phone number, and maybe we'll call you sometime.
[ gasps ] You are such-- -[Sedgewick] Guys, what's our phone number?
[Deepak] 555-0169 - Um, area code 215.
okay. So, um
do you guys want to go skinny-dipping?
pardon me? - You mean naked?

Oh, my God.
so, uh, who's gonna come with me then?
[ Girl] Is he kidding? [ Girl #2 ] oh, God!
Oh, no way! Not me. I don't want to get my arm wet.
might lose your phone number.
that's okay. I 'll just whisper it in your ear so you won't forget.
I'll go! - My God!
I'll go too! [Louis ] Disrobe men!
[ blubbering ] Yeah!
I'm going!
ladies! What is going on here?
[Deepak ] Holyshit! [Louis ]A nun.
Oh, my God.
there goes your tuition, Marty.
[Bell Tolling] Come on!
there is a code at Saint Benedict's...
of self-governance based on mutual trust.
[Tolling Continues ] You have violated that trust.
and you've compromised the reputation of this academy.
IFL thought you didn't know any better, that would be one thing.
but willful ignorance is intolerable.
you're confined to the dormitory until 7: 00 tomorrow morning.
what about dinner? - [ Both Laughing ]
excuse me? - Well, I'm hungry, sir.
[ laughs ] oh, my God! - Mr. Masoudi?
Mr. Hundert. [ Sputtering Laugh ] [ Laughs ]
have a good evening, gentlemen.
how you doing, Mr. Hundert?
Hi, Mr. H.
[Sedgewick] Brewster!
Mr. Bell, would you please come up to the front of the classroom?
would you mind finishing this diagram for me?
Octavian was named what?
a common wood beetle on the floor ofthis classroom...
would know the answer to that question.
emperor? - Yes!
can you, please, name any of the subsequent emperors...
there were 41. - I only know seven.
verywell.
grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, - [ Laughing ]
Dopey-- [Laughter Continues ]
seriously, though, can you in fact...
name any of the emperors? - I know four.
very well. - Uh, John, Paul, Ringo and, uh, - George. - Mr. Bell.
a word of warning. As the great wit Aristophanes once wrote
roughly translated-- "Youth ages, immaturity is outgrown, "ignorance can be educated and drunkenness sobered, "but stupid Iasts forever.
class, if you please, chronologically
[ all ] Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero,
Galba, otho,
Vitellius, Vespasian,
Titus, Domitian,
Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian,
Antonius Pius, Marcus Aurelius,
commodus, Pertinax-- Thankyou. That will do.
please take your seat, Mr. Bell.
come in. [Door Rattling]
Mr. Bell. Mr. Hundert.
please, have a seat.
only child?
please be seated, Mr. Bell.
do you know whyyou're here?
student ofthe day.
I gave you "1 " for spelling your name correctly.
Mr. Bell,
I don't know what you think you're doing at Saint Benedict's, but this is unacceptable work.
you must apply yourself-- - You're not married, are you, sir?
no. I am not.
that's why you like putting us all in togas, right?
I've made arrangements to meet with your father.
is there anything you'd like me to say to him?
tell him I said hello.
well, how are you? Good to see you.
and you, sir. Give me just a second.
who's that? Mm-hm. Professor, come on in.
Kathleen, hold all my calls. Thankyou, Michael.
sit down, please.
Cubans.
don't tell the A. T.F. [ Chuckles ]
no. Not for me. Thanks. You're sure?
Oh, yes, sir. Don't know whatyou're missin'.
Senator-- oh, here. You'll enjoy this.
this was given to me by one of my constituents this morning.
take a look at that. [Woman ] SenatorBell's office.
hold it! Don't be too fast there, partner.
[ Chuckles ] Quarter roll. Ah.
here. Go on. That was, uh
supposedly belonged to the coachman of Robert E. Lee. Really?
well, so he said. [ Chuckles ]
you're a history buff, aren't ya?
in a manner of speaking, sir. Yes.
well, take that. That's yours.
Oh, no. I couldn't. oh, take the damn thing!
it's a gift. For all you've done for my son, Sedgewick.
Thankyou.
so, to what do I owe this honor?
[ clicking Continues ] It's your son, Senator.
Oh, Christ. What the devil's he done now?
Sedgewick is clearly an intelligent boy, but, sir, he's not applying himself.
he's not... Iearning the material. [DrawerSliding]
I need a match! [ Woman ] Yes, Senator. Right away.
what material is that? It's the Greeks and the Romans
we've left the Republic and entered the Empire
here you are, sir. Thank you.
shut the door on your way out, will you?
we're up to the reign of Augustus.
you ought to be careful with that thing, by the way. You know, it still fires.
Oh. Sedgewick, it seems, is not paying attention in class, sir.
nor is he doing the assigned reading.
let me askyou something.
what's the good of what you're teachin' those boys?
the good? - Yes. The good.
well, Senator, the Greeks and Romans provided...
a model of democracy, which,
I don't need to tell you, the framers of our own Constitution used as their inspiration.
but more to the point, I think when the boys read Plato, Aristotle,
cicero, Julius Caesar even, they're put in direct contact with men who, the highest standards of statesmanship,
of civic virtue,
of character, conviction
[ Chuckles ] Boy, that is a horse that can talk!
so, you're sayin' that my son Sedgewick has his head up his ass.
sir, it's my job to mold your son's character, and I think if-- Moldhim?
Jesus God in heaven, son.
you're not gonna mold my boy.
your job is to teach my son.
you teach him his times tables.
teach him why the world is round.
teach him who killed who and when and where.
that is your job.
you, sir, will not mold my son.
I will mold him.
Yes, sir. - Yes.
thanks for comin'.
[ players ] Break!
Marty. Marty. Get back. Come on.
bell! Bell!
uh, telephone for you. - What?
it's a girl. - [Boys Razzing] ohhh!
[Brewster] I'll bet it's that blond from Saint Mary's.
[ boys ] Shhh. Hello?
[ woman ] Sedgewick? Hold for your father.
[ sen. Bell ] Let me ask you somethin'. Do you know what...
it's costing me to send you to this place?
what's wrong? - Shut up.
my time is precious, son. I thought I made that clear.
I got better things to do than to clean up after you.
you understand me? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I understand.
don't forget it.
so, what did she say, man. What did she say?
wrong girl.
wha-- What happened? I don't know.
deepak, would you give Sedgewick and me a moment? Yes, sir.
Thankyou. You're welcome, sir.
I spoke to your father. I know.
we had a real... heart-to-heart.
this is for you.
forgive the condition. It was my textbook in high school.
it's quite good.
the first chapter has an outline...
of all the material which we'll be covering this term.
I thought it might be helpful in preparing...
for the Mr. Julius Caesar contest.
the first quiz is tomorrow morning.
look at chapterthree-- "The Foundation of the Republic.
Sedgewick, I'm lending you this book because I believe in you.
I think you could be at the top of your class...
if you wanted to be.
it's entirely up to you.
[Hundert ] Begin.
well done!
Mr. Bell.
you passed.
it's only a C-minus. [ Chuckles ]
well, you know what they say about Rome.
it wasn't built in a day?
no. All roads lead to it.
you were right the first time. Keep up the good work.
begin.
[Boy] Hey, Kevin! How are you?
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you saying? oh, 14.
all right. Aleajacta est. What's that mean?
the die is cast.
all right. All right. Twenty. All right. Next week then.
I actually made the list. Hey, look who's up there.
good job. Number five. You're third.
miss Peters, no one is going to look at this book between now and 7: 00 a. m.
I understand that, Mr. Bell. I understand.
Everyboy in the third forum has asked to check this book out overnight.
now, ifl letyou have it, that wouldn't be fair, would it?
I t would be fair. I know in my heart it would be.
Mr. Bell, you are exasperating. Miss Peters, that is a great hairstyle.
is that new? - I've had it since 1 958.
now, Mr. Bell, in order to be fair to all the students, it is important that this book always be available here at this desk.
it is Saint Benedict's policy.
and it will be on your desk tomorrow morning.
No! No!
miss Peters, I can vouch for this boy's character.
he's one of my best students.
if he says it will be on your desk first thing in the morning, it will be on your desk first thing in the morning.
I will, personally, take full responsibility.
please.
Thankyou. You're welcome.
I wasn't kidding about the hair.
thank you. Good night. Say thank you.
thank you. Thanks. Good evening.
you run a tight ship, Miss Peters. Good night.
good night! Good night! - I admire that
[Louis ] All right, Marty!
[Bell] Nice! Nice catch!
Hey, Mr. Hundert! Hey, you want to take a couple of swings?
[Sedgewick ] Come on, Mr. Hundert!
Aw, come on! - Come on, Mr. Hundert!
the library windows are too close. [Boys Laughing]
Oh, yeah. Right, Mr. Hundert.
Hey, come on. Show us how it's done, old school.
[Brewster] Now you got to play, Mr. Hundert. Come on!
old school," eh? [Louis ] Uh-oh.
here we go. Here comes the jacket.
Mr. Masoudi. Mr. Hundert.
it's been awhile. Yeah. More like never.
Hey, back it up, everybody. Come on. We got a hitter. Move back.
back it up, fellows. Back it up, outfield.
should've known. [ Taps Bat on Book ]
Egemus iaculatore, non iacchi latore!
what does that mean? - Means we want a pitcher, not a glass ofwater.
[Field] Come on, Sedgewick! You got to get him back for that one!
right down the lane! - [Boys ] ohhh!
no batter.
[ Sedgewick ] Run!
run!
come on! Hurry up!
Hey, come on! Let's go to Brewster's room!
go, go, go, go, go, go!
nice hit, Mr. Hundert.
good, Mr. H. "old school"! Shh.
I suppose you're as blind as all of them.
you have no idea how this came to be hit through my window? No idea.
Oh, dear. [Woodbridge ] No idea?
Ohhh, dear. - You'll make a good lawyer.
it's 9: 00. You have until noon.
this is the last of the Mr. Julius Caesar quizzes...
and will do much to determine the three finalists.
good luck.
it's time, Mr. Bell.
Mr. Bell, I'm afraid you'll have to stop.
this is it, Martin.
this is unbelievable! - oh, my God. I got to call my father.
Oh, I'm sorry. I hope it's not too late.
no. Not at all. Not at all.
how are you? Uh.
well. Well. I was just outside...
observing the wildlife.
sit down! Would you like your usual?
no, thankyou. You sure?
Mm-hm. - Do you mind it, uh
how is Mr. Julius Caesar going?
very-- Very well. Even, uh, Sedgewick Bell.
making progress? - Oh, more than progress.
he's-he's come out ofthe darkness into the light. It's
please, sit down.
[ sighs ] Cheers.
I have to tell you something.
Tony's been offered a lectureship at his old college in oxford.
it's a good offer, and he's accepted it. [ Sighs ]
I mean-- I mean to say we've accepted it.
uh, we're-we're going to England.
W-W-When?
at the end of the year?
well, ifhe wants the position, he has to take it up almost immediately, and he wants the position.
so, he's spoken to Mr. Woodbridge, andhe agreed.
just like that?
well, that's-- that's
that's remarkable, really.
a lectureship, that's a tremendous opportunity.
very good. Good.
well, you'll be missed.
both of you.
I-I-I-- I should-- [ Chuckles ]
Yes.

that is correct.
thank you, Louis. Thank you.
Mr. J ulius Caesar.
that was quite an interesting performance this afternoon.
I knew you saw.
why, Sedgewick?
you knew the material.
why not?
how come you didn't stand up and call me out?
it's a complicated matter, Sedgewick.
it wasn't because of my father, was it?
it had nothing to do with your father.
sure, Mr. Hundert. Sure.
William!
I came by to congratulate you. That was terrific!
Sedgewick Bell-- quite the surprise. Yes.
he's come a long way. You must be very proud of him.
it makes forwonderful theater.
in fact, I was thinking, I might make the suggestion to you, and to Mr. Woodbridge, that in the future more alumni are invited.
not just the parents of the finalists, but maybe all of the alumni.
you know? And instead of it happening just on any old weekday,
you know, for fund-raising, which would augur well for your headmastership.
Mmm. What's wrong?
Sedgewick cheated.
what? Come in.
well, the pressure to succeed can be oppressive.
and, right orwrong,
Woodbridge felt it was in the best interests of the school's endowment to let it pass.
come on. William, you didn't put the boy up on the stage.
he got there on his own merit.
all you did was inspire him...
to study and to learn, and for that you should be commended.
and thus began an uneasy truce...
between Sedgewick Bell and myself.
Whateverspark had ignited him during the previous months...
was now extinguished.
and his brief flirtation with diligence...
was supplanted by a renewed appetite for brashness,
as for his classmates, his effect on them was almost hypnotic.
wherever he went, they hovered,
Sedgewick for class president. utterly blind to any deficiencies in his character.
food fight!
so, his remainingyears at Saint Benedict's passed...
amidst an inexhaustible series ofpranks, and an avalanche of C's and D's.
Sedgewick Hyram Bel l.
and though his father's influence guaranteed him a place at Yale, it was with a profound sense offailure, that in the spring of 1 976,
I handed Sedgewick Bell his diploma.
according to Heraclitus, we cannot step into the same river twice.
in the flow oftime, " he argued, "an opportunity lost is lost forever.
Andyet, when Elizabeth 's marriage ended and she returned home from England, the waters in which we found ourselves swimming...
were precisely as lovely as those we had earlier only imagined.
but if time had made concessions for love, it made none for death.
and when our headmaster, Terence Woodbridge, passed away,
I felt profound sadness.
though the incident with Sedgewick Bell had tested our friendship, he had for half a century...
devoted himself to St. Benedict's tradition of academic and moral leadership
a tradition, I realized, that was now mine...
to safeguard.
good I uck, Mr. H undert.
thank you, Mr. Horner.
everyone. Welcome.
Larry, good to see you.
Hi. Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Hundert. Good to see you again.
uh, please take a seat.
uh-- Let's get right to it, shall we?
as you wish.
Mr. Hundert, your contributions at Saint Benedict's have been extraordinary.
your tenure is unmatched, and you are loved and revered by all.
the notion of taking you away from your classroom...
is one to which we've given great thought.
a headmaster's job is a rigorous one.
the travel demands and meeting schedules have become unending.
one must be prepared to do battle 24 hours a day and sometimes longer.
well, having rowedour lake everyday, weather permitting, through the last seven presidential administrations,
I feel more than ready to do battle.
what we're saying, Mr. Hundert, is
Mr. Hundert, what experience do you have...
with fund-raising or building endowments?
Mr. Hundert, we can't afford to lose you as a teacher here.
the reality is this. Enrollment is down.
people are thinking of Saint Benedict's as old-fashioned.
we need to look more to the future and less to the past.
then who?
someone from the outside?
James Ellerby.
excuse me?
you did realize he made application for the job.
Mr. Ellerbyhas proposed some very exciting... No.
fund-raising possibilities.
miss Johnston, I've been assistant headmaster for 1 7 years.
I fail to see how Mr. Ellerby's...
qualifications as a fund-raiser
it's not just about fund-raising.
James Ellerby is a forward-thinking man.
he's reached out to the community.
he's built relationships to some of the most important alumni.
he is a wonderful communicator, with impeccable moral standing...
and an unwavering commitment to this school.
so
then you leave me no choice but to tender my resignation.
I would ask you not to.
you are a teacher, and the finest one we've ever had.
please excuse me.
please understand, Mr. Hundert, you will be welcome back here at Saint Benedict's at any time.
th-the door will forever be open.
I'm still shocked at James Ellerby.
Oh, I'm not. I'm only shocked that I didn't see it coming.
I realize now he'd been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign for years.
he's godfather to two of the board members' children, for God's sake.
I have...
so many other things...
that I've always wanted to do.
I-I've always wanted to write.
I have an idea for a book on the early days of the Republic.
well, here's to Saint Benedict's.
I brought you some tea.
going well?
Oh, it's virtually writing itself.
good. Then I won't interrupt you.
Carryon, then. Good writing.
William?
James Ellerby's on the phone.
the merger makes him C. E.o. of one of the largest corporations in America.
but what does any of this have to do with me?
here's the thing. He's informed us that he would like to make...
a substantial donation to Saint Benedict's...
with one condition.
he would like to hold a rematch ofthe Mr. Julius Caesar contest.
a rematch?
with you as master of ceremonies.
Why?
he says he would like to reclaim his intellectual honor.
and he says his secretary's already located Louis Masoudi and Deepak Mehta...
and doesn't really anticipate too much trouble tracking down the others.
didn't you tell him I had retired?
well, he asked for you and only you.
he insisted on it as a condition.
and did Mr. Bell say how much of a donation he was planning to make to Saint Benedict's?
enough for a 25, 000-square-foot addition to the library...
in honor of his father.
itwould be the school's single largest donation to date.
and a retired history professor with no fund-raising ability is the linchpin.
Yes.
it's ironic.
life's a funnything, William, huh?
where does hepropose to hold this rematch?
[Ellerby]A resort on the Gold Coast of Long Island that his company owns.
the proposed itinerary is all in here.
Ah, Mr. H undert.
Mr. Bel l.
and how was your tri p?
I t was unlike anything I 've ever experienced.
I now know how Caesar Augustus must have felt...
being carried head high in the litter past the Tiber. oh, really?
it's all a bit overwhelming.
well, don't let this fool you. I am still the son ofa pig farmer.
I really appreciate you coming here this weekend.
you know, you think things that happen when you're 5 don't matter, but
I mean, oh-- Excuse me, guys, I'll be right back.
Mr. Hundert. Please.
Sedgewick. Please come and join us.
I'd like you to meet my top two advisors. This is John.
Hi, John. Hi, Mr. Hundert.
and Robert. - How doyou do, Mr. Hundert?
Verywell, thankyou. - And, my lovely wife, Victoria.
so nice to finally meet you, sir. I've heard so much about you.
all right, all right!
[Bell] This is the time of the evening...
where I'd like to call upon a unique g
Oh, Brewster.
I'd like to call upon a unique gentleman, one who managed to chisel the rise and fall of the Roman Empire into our minds, whether we liked it or not.
our Mr. Hundert. - [Man ] Hear! Hear!
I must say, um-- You've all grown up.
I feel as if I should do roll call...
just to be sure to whom I'm speaking.
seriously, to stand here among...
my students
I expect to see you all in detention.
now, risen to become...
a bunch of drunken reprobates...
who are now a veritable who's who of American industry,
Iaw, finance and higher education.
well, I can think of few greater privileges.
I thank you.
more coffee, sir? Yes. Thankyou.
Mr. Hundert?
Martin. Martin Blythe.
it's good to see you again, sir.
when you weren't at the dinnerlast night, I was worried that perhaps
that I wasn't gonna make it?
Oh, come on, Mr. Hundert. I wouldn't miss this.
you know, I was going over my notes the other day...
in preparation for the-- The competition.
Yes, and I-I came across an essay...
that you once wrote on the Five Good Emperors.
it's amazing. You were
you were always a wonderful student, Martin.
I, uh,
I never quite gave you your due.
now, why would you say that?
Oh, I don't know, I
my God, Mr. Hundert, you
that recommendation you wrote when I applied for the Academy
it was glowing. It was
of course you gave me my due.
you gave me more than my due.
grab his wrists! Push.
okay, Deepak. With what emperor did the Julio-Claudian dynasty come to an end?
Mmm. Masoudi?
Nero.
we did it! Yeah! Good job, Robert. All right, all right.
time to study.
no. Come on, Dad! one more game?
come in.
sorryto botheryou, sir. - oh, no bother.
how are you, Sedgewick? I am fine.
I have something foryou.
Oh, my God.
I hope there's no late fee.
I understand now why it meant so much to you.
the Greeks carve cold marble until it almost comes to life.
the Greeks compose great orations...
and measure the heavens so well they can predict the rising of the stars.
but you, Roman, rememberyour great arts.
to govern the people with authority...
to establish peace under the rule of law.
to conquer the mighty, and to show them mercy once they are conquered.
well, it's nice to see you haven't marked it up. [ Chuckles ]
Yeah, I had my moments, didn't I?
your years, you mean.
why did you put up with me?
I suppose because...
I saw a young man who was under a great deal of pressure.
and, not unlike your upbringing,
I too had a-- a father who was a very busy man.
[ Chuckles ] You know, it's funny.
I remember traveling with my father, and there wasn't a person he didn't know.
he talked, and he told stories, and he was, he was always full of advice, always charming, and always...
the Senator.
but I can hardlyremember having a real conversation with him.
in fact, I wonder if he ever heard a word I'd spoken.
years ago, I, uh, visited him in the hospital and he was very, very sick.
and it took a moment forhim to realize I was at his bedside.
and he began to cry.
and through his tears, he looked up at me and he said, "Talk to me.
I wondered where to begin. I had no idea.
but at the very moment I started to talk, he closed his eyes and he passed away...
without having heard a word.
Ah, that son of a bitch.
Oh, God. Thanks. Thanks again, Mr. Hundert,
it is my extreme pleasure.
I'm looking forward to this evening. Best ofluck.
Oh, much obliged. I'll need all the help I can get.
Seeya downstairs. I'll see you downstairs.
[ man ] Go, Deepak!
[ man ] All right, Sedgewick!
it's not a good time. I've gotta call you right back. Thankyou. Bye.
sorry, sir.
wereyou talking to your broker?
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
our three scholars will be posed questions...
on ancient history in increasing levels of difficulty.
I ask you to please hold your applause until the end of each round.
may the best man win.
Mr. Masoudi, areyou ready?
Mr. Hundert, I am Julius Caesar.
Mr. Caesar,
of the first eight emperors, which name is omitted from the following list?
Augustus, Tiberius,
Caligula, Nero, Vespasian,
Titus, Domitian.
Trajan.
I'm sorry. That is incorrect.
Oh. Was it Marcus Aurelius?
no. - Commodus?
no. - oh. Septimus?
Nope. Gaseous Flatulus?
I'm sorry. None ofthe above.
[ clears Throat ] The question goes to Mr. Mehta. Would you like me to repeat the question?
no, sir. It's Claudius, sir. That is correct.
see, I knew that. - It was a short reign, but a happy one.
you may be seated, Mr. Masoudi.
Thankyou. Thank you for your kindness.
[Man ] That's all right, Lou.
now you can check your messages.
uh, Mr. Bell, please translate, if you will, alea jacta est.
tell me who uttered these words, and on what occasion.
Aleajacta est. "The die is cast.
Caesar spoke these words as he crossed the Rubicon in defiance of his government.
that is correct.
I've been studying. I can see that.
Mr. Mehta, what year was the Roman army crushed at Lake Trasimene?
217 B. C. sir.
correct.
Mr. Bell, who was the last emperor...
of the Western Empire?
romulus Augu
[ clears Throat ] Romulus Augustulus.
correct.
Mr. Mehta. - Milvian Bridge.
correct. - Lex Vatinia.
very good. - Praetorian Guard.
[Bell] Marcus Aurelius. - Theodosius II.
that is correct. - Comitia Tributa.
the Hadrianic rotunda. - Well done.
Mr. Bell, which tribes invaded Rome in 1 02 B. C?
um
[Hundert] Takeyourtime.
the Teutons.
Oh, um-- God.
um
I'm gonna take a stab here. Uh
the Cimbri?
that is correct.
well done. I'm impressed.
thank you very much. Good. I'm
Mr. Mehta-- [ Clears Throat]
what was Caracalla's greatest constit
greatest constitutional reform?
he granted citizenship to all free male inhabitants of the empire.
that is correct.
Mr. Bell, who was Shutruk-Nahhunte?
Shutruk-Nahhunte, huh?
come on, Bell. It was above the damn door.
the door! He's gotta know this.
the door, Sedgewick! Come on!
the plaque!
I guess if Deepak can nab this one, then it's his ball game.
Mr. Mehta, who was Shutruk-Nahhunte?
Shutruk-Nahhunte, King of Ansham and Susa,
that is correct. [Cheering, Clapping]
ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Julius Caesar!
hail, Caesar! - Hail, Caesar!
Congratulations. Goodjob. - [Man ] Hail, Caesar!
congratulations, Deepak.
thank you very much, Mr. Hundert. Good job.
I suppose if you're gonna lose, you may as well lose to the brightest.
Deepak Mehta.
and thanks again, Mr. Hundert.
your virtue is a beacon of light.
Oh, no, Mr. Hundert. Please stay.
and thank you all.
we've had a great deal of fun this weekend, and we, uh, probably shouldn't wait another 25 years till we do it again.
but there's a more serious side to this gathering.
one that concerns every one ofus.
because all of us here, I believe, care about the quality of education in this country.
and not just at places I i ke Saint Benedict's, not just for our children, but for the nation's children.
because we all care about our country's future
about its moral leadership, about its fiscal leadership.
and because we know that, as a generation, it is our time to lead.
and why I stand before you now, to tell you my intentions of following in the formidable footsteps of my father, and announce my bid for a seat in the United States Senate.
and I want to ask you all for your support.
[ man ] He's got my vote!
Congratulations. Sedgewick, congratulations.
here you are.
there's about, uh, 30 balding, middle-aged men out there looking foryou, Professor.
well, some things can't wait.
God, you were great this evening.
you're like fine wine. You improve with age.
everything all right?
Yes, I'm fine. Yeah? You don't
you don't look so fine. I'm all right. Thankyou.
well, then hurry up and come join the celebration.
how long have you been hard of hearing, Sedgewick?
uh-- [ Chuckles ]
very good, Mr. Hundert. Very
very good. Yeah.
boy, I thought you might've known.
who's the poor mercenary who was feeding you the answers?
Oh, just some graduate student. Gave him a couple hundred bucks and a warm meal.
I trust you'll keep this between us.
as always.
I trust you will.
do you mean am I going to go out there...
and expose you for a liar and a cheat?
no.
I'm a teacher, Sedgewick.
and I failed you
but I will give you one last lecture,
all of us, at some point, are forced...
to look at ourselves in the mirror, and see who we really are.
and when that day comes for you, Sedgewick, you will be confronted with a life...
Iived without virtue, without principle, and for that I pity you.
end of lesson.
well, can I say, Mr. Hundert, who gives a shit?
honestly.
who out there gives a shit...
about your principles and your virtues?
I mean, look atyou.
what doyou have to show for yourself?
I live in the real world, where people do what they need to do to get what theywant.
and if it's lying and it's cheating, then so be it.
so, I am gonna go out there, and I am going to win that election, Mr. Hundert, and you will see me everywhere.
and I'll worry about my contribution later.
Robert.
Robert.
and a, uh, vodka tonic, please. Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Hundert. Martin, could I have a minute?
Oh, sure, sure. I-I enjoyed that so much, sir.
I-I-I'm so sorry mywife and my kids couldn't be here to see it.
you know, I really thought Sedgewickwas gonna take it from him this time.
it was amazing. Martin, that was supposed to be you up there.
I'm... sorry?
all those years ago, it was supposed to be you.
well, no. I-I wasn't one ofthe original three finalists.
you were. I gaveyour spot away.
it may not mean anything to you, but...
I wanted you to know that.
okay.
I'm sorry, Martin.
no, that's-that's okay.
I-I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
um, I've got to, um
you know, Deepak is waiting for me.
will I see you at breakfast tomorrow?
sure.
good.
I think that it's-- it's important.
my father, Hyram Bell, instilled in me a sense of principles.
what I think this country really needs, it's that sense of-- of right and wrong.
[ phone Ringing] And we're, uh, speaking of, of how we can make this...
better with education, to-to reach out...
and really get to the children, to teach them the sense...
of principles and sense of contribution.
Mr. Hundert.
have I come to the wrong place for breakfast?
not at all. But unfortunately you've missed everyone.
missed everyone? Well, they seemed to be rather in a hurry.
some ofthem had planes to catch.
but they did say to say good-bye to you.
I'm sure I could find you something to eat ifyou'd like.
no, no. Thankyou.
w-was there-- Thankyou.
hail, Caesar!
get a picture really quick. There it is.
[Shutter Clicks ] Look at him. He looks great.
Oh, the bat! Gimme the bat, the bat.
Mr.-- Mr. Hundert, we have something we'd like to present to you.
the only man who could make Homer a hit,
our slugger, Mr. Hundert.
[Laughter] Doyou remember?
I remember. Hey, be careful of the window overthere, Mr. H!
eloquently put, Mr. Masoudi, et al. Uh, thankyou.
deepak, the, uh, the, uh, plaque.
a great teacher has little external history to record.
his life goes over into otherlives.
these men are pillars in the intimate structure of our schools.
they are more essential than its stones or beams.
and they will continue to be a kindling force, and a revealing power in our lives.
thank you, Mr. Hundert.
thankyou, Deepak.
I, uh
he's speechless for the first time in his life.
whatever I may have taught you gentlemen, um, many years ago,
I want to thank you for this weekend, because you have taught me something...
of inestimable value.
Thankyou.
to Mr. Hundert. Toyou, sir!
Thankyou. Here. oh, I'm sorry.
to you.
I had come here in the hope that I had been wrong about Sedgewick Bell.
or rather, that I had been right
right to believe in him all those years ago.
but this is a story without surprises.
as a student of history, I could be shocked...
neither by his audacity, nor his success.
I had failed Sedgewick.
but the worth ofa life is not determined...
by a single failure, or a solitary success.
my other students taught me that.
however much we stumble, it is a teacher's burden always to hope...
that with learning, a boy's character might be changed.
and, so, the destiny ofa man.
[ Boy] Good morning, Mr. Hundert. Good morni ng.
[ Hundert ] Your name, sir? William Simon, sir.
and your name? - Howard Hol lander.
and yours, sir? - George Duncan.
and your name, sir? Alec Matthews.
and yours, miss? - Kathryn Scott.
and your name? - Tawana Carver.
and yours, sir? - Steven Wong.
very good. Very good.
my name is Mr. Hundert.
this is Western Civilization-- [Knocking]
sorry I'm late, sir.
and you are?
uh, Martin Blythe, sir.
of course.
welcome, Mr. Blythe. Have a seat.
uh, yes, sir.
Mr. Blythe? Yes, sir?
would you please stand up and read the plaque...
which you see over the door behind you?
I am Shutruk-Nahhunte, "King of Ansham and Susa, "sovereign ofthe land of Elam.
I destroyed Sippar, "took the stele of Naram-Sin...
where I erected it as an offering to my god.'
Shutruk-Nahhunte, 1 158 B. C.
very good.
it is a corpse!
meeting the famous sword-woman Red Lady is indeed a matter of great honour for me
I'm grateful to you for curing my wound.
Oh, not at all
you weren't severely hurt. C'mon, get up
do you know the person who threw this?
this person is...
do you wish to take revenge?
no, first of all I'd like to avenge my parents
then you must be Wu from Ming House.
true. My family were victim of the massacre.
both my parents were killed!
only an aunt who wasn't home that day survived
my master saved and trained me for 10 years.
I am on orders to have revenge.
so you have found your enemies, is it?
not Yet.
I need to look for my aunt first or go to Jin Castle in Dragon Valley.
my marriage has been arranged with Jin's daughter.
but I won't marry before having my revenge!
in fact, I aspire to learn Jin's special skill
so I take it, you'll go to Jin Castle first, since you haven't found your aunt as yet.
that's right
how did you know?
because you said so yourself!
Yeah, but I haven't been out for 10 years, and I don't know the way to Jin Castle.
I can show you the way.
there is a shortcut to Dragon Valley.
follow me.
Hey, what are you doing?
look brother...
I am not a boy!
I beg your pardon; little lady...
can you show me the way to Jin Castle?
whom would you like to meet there?
I'm looking for Mr. Dragon Jin.
he is my grandfather. And yourself?
I'm Wu from Ming House
you are little Wu, right?
Yes, I am.
little Wu and my aunt are one of a pair
let's go. I'll take you home
brother Du...
I, sister Lianzhu...
do you understand what I am saying?
you said you treat me well.
granny, the parents, brother, sis-in-law, everyone in the family treats me well.
we're relatives. lndeed you'd treat me well.
I...
why do you sigh?
you look funny and dumb, .-just like little Wu.
little Wu...
we've been together since we were kids.
he looks funny too. It's so amusing!
C'mon, practice.
if dad comes and asks, tell him I've finished.
has Lian finished?
how's your practice going on?
still a lot remains to be accomplished!
don't be modest. Everyone says you're good.
no, I don't deserve the praise.
the other day, hadn't you pretended a corpse, and obtained the money by blocking the road;
I don't think it's easy to make it.
dad, Wu from Ming house is here.
Where's he?
in the living room.
where?
meet my mother
aunt...
little Wu, I couldn't imagine it's you!
aunt
this is Lian's...
wu, get up.
she's lady Qi of your family.
she's my mother.
sister-in-law
don't be too formal
sister-in-law...
just in time; Wu, he is your second uncle.
uncle
hey don't! C'mon get up
where is elder brother?
Jiaqi has gone to inform him.
grandpa is here
grandfather, Dad
meet your Grandfather and he's Brother Qi.
C'mon, get up
have you met grandmother?
sister is gone to fetch her.
when will little Wu marry my aunt?
you shouldn't call him little Wu.
you should call him uncle Wu.
mom, would I still need to call him "uncle"
after he's married to aunt?
where is little Wu?
grandma
Wu... where is Little Wu?
grandma, how are you?
get up, get up
my my! How you've grown up!
come closer and let me have a look.
grandma...
he's handsome and strong, and makes a good match with Lianzhu.
she's your elder aunt. -Hello Auntie
you are welcome.
come on, have a seat.
Where's Lianzhu?
should I call Lianzhu to see little Wu?
I'll go, granny
little Lin.
did Lianzhu catch a cold?
Yes, she's sick.
they haven't met for a long time.
Yes, ten years have passed
outside, wouldn't have recognized each other!
what to speak of knowing him outside,
it's already tough recognizing him here!
grandma, I think little Wu might be tired
should I prepare some snacks?
take him to the guest room to relax
okay, you and Jiaqi see him to the room.
Yes.
granny...
I want to learn Dragon Dart from Mr. Jin.
let's talk about it later.
go now, we'll have a chat tomorrow morning.
okay, old lady, I'm off now.
come back, what did you just call me?
old lady sounds too remote.
grandma.
right. Go and have some rest.
Yes, grandma.
grandma, aunt is not sick.
I saw her practicing just this morning.
lin, go and play outside
go play with your mom, dear. I'm busy.
why didn't you let Lianzhu see him?
mom, you still don't get it?
just a few days back we encountered Wu.
Encountered?!
brother hit him with a dart that day.
so about Lianzhu's marriage proposal, we had better think about seriously.
but it's already been agreed upon.
I don't think he'd do us any harm
Bro...brother, what's wrong with you?
get him inside. Quick.
quick...
hurry up...
Master..., Master
is it Ziran?
yes
what's the matter?
Yes, he's back.
okay, I will be there right away
untie his clothes first.
what is it again?
ziran collapsed outside bro's door
just us handling him. We took him inside.
was it only him?
Yep, and he was hit by a dart.
go, hurry up and get the medicine.
right
now we've had it!
what on earth is the matter?
the money in our guard has been plundered.
all other guys died.
the bandits were very professional.
we didn't stand a chance and I was hit!
finding no other way,
I hid myself behind the hill to avoid them
after they left, I just...
was the dart-thrower tall?
well, he sure is a good boxer.
I saw him throwing four darts at a time.
4 of our men died without so much as a word
it definitely must be him!
master, you know that gang?
not a group, but rather a family!
how could they dare...
how dare they take on us, Red lotus Clan?
master, our men were dressed as guards...
how could they know we were Red lotus Clan?
I must look into this.
their Chief named Dragon Jin, always takes on other boxers.
master, we'll go check it out first.
okay. Go and request Master Fafu to come
he left yesterday.
where did he have to go again?
we don't know.
he didn't say, and we didn't dare ask!
damn it!
the Landlord and yourself weren't in,
and there was such a serious problem...
no matter what, master...
we'll go to check first.
alright, but don't let the matter get heated up
remember, I'm just acting on doubt.
Nevertheless...
we ought to pay extra attention.
Yes, lord shares the same idea.
you take some rest. I'll handle it.
all right!
what are you laughing at?
I knew that Du...
he really wished Wu to turn out a traitor.
what do you mean?
still don't get it, do you?
this dearest brother of mine, always keeps thinking of Lianzhu and desires to be close to her.
if you know what I mean, ...then give him a hand.
it's a one-sided matter, what can I do?
it's just the same as you before.
me? What's it got to do with me?
even you had some problem, then, getting along with the Red Lady, right?
grandma, I learnt some skills from Red Lady
I'll ask her to marry me.
in fact if you marry a famous woman boxer, ... it's mighty good for you.
but it's impossible to make it.
after one becomes "family"
social visits become less frequent
since this issue was handled in a rush,
isn't the matter of Du the same?
Lianzhu and Wu have long been acquainted
if Wu turns out to be a traitor,
I think Lianzhu will be heart-broken.
wu is in fact, a little suspicious.
he shouldn't have messed with Red lotus Clan.
I see...it's Red lotus Clan!
still playing these kind of kid games!
dragon Jin, no more bullshit, watch it!
go and have a look in your backyard
Yes.
red Lotus Dart!
dad, it's Red lotus Clan ... taking us on.
maybe we've a traitor here.
watch out and needn't I say,
we have to be careful tonight.
yes
who is it?
it's Wu, sis Lianzhu.
little Wu...
you don't recognize me?
stop!
how dare you call me sis Lianzhu?
then I must have met the wrong person.
wait, where do you come from?
Tai Ming House
there's a scar behind the left ear.
a stone thrown by Lianzhu had hit me, when I was a child.
you really are Wu then.
you, Sis Lianzhu...
you couldn't recognize me.
neither could you!
no wonder! We've all grown up.
when did you arrive?
this afternoon.
why didn't you come to see me?
grandma wanted me to, but your parents said you weren't feeling well
I was a bit worried...
so I come to the inner chamber to see you.
are you feeling better now?
I'm perfectly alright.
then why did they lie to me?
they didn't want us to meet.
whatever for?
perhaps Dad wishes to call off the alliance!
du, see anything weird?
what happened didn't alarm inner chamber.
however, Wu is getting up
what for?
he entered the courtyard from the tree.
Lianzhu, if your dad really opposes this, ...what should we do?
I won't marry anyone else but you.
wu, I had determined before
I won't marry another, except you.
Lianzhu...
Wu...
relax, We're together as a couple now
but, you assisted Red lotus Clan that day...
Oh c'mon, it was just a coincidence.
grandma is right.
if Wu had connections with Red lotus Clan, he wouldn't dare come here.
right you are
I'm worried about his background though
he's your buddy's son, a decedent from a military family. No need to worry.
what if he isn't strong-willed enough...
you're afraid he might run away?
if he marries Lianzhu, he'll stay here definitely.
but...
Well，there shouldn't be any mistake.
I listened to you for Jiaqi's marriage.
then Red Lady refused to come to our house.
grandma, that's Red's own decision.
besides, they're not at the same family level
qi is sort of Red's student.
you're right.
wu and Lianzhu are in the same level.
stop it. Listen to me this time.
arrange their wedding right away.
Lianzhu, guess what I am thinking about.
what's it?
we used to play a wedding game as children
then, you played the bride and always argued with me.
grandma stopped us and said the bride shouldn't argue with the groom.
do you remember?
do you remember what you used to say?
you always said "it's not real, if we're having a true wedding in future, we'd not argue."
I don't expect it to come true now!
why do you sigh so?
I mean, it's hard to foretell anything
when I first arrived here,
I didn't have any hope about our marriage.
I was worried at the beginning, but later
I do realise that grandma loves both of us.
you can ask grandma.
Lianzhu...
aunt, Uncle...
Lianzhu, go to bed now.
mother-in-law...
what did Ma tell you?
I'd know even if you don't tell me wouldn't I?
Lianzhu, we ought to sleep as well
it's about time.
you go on, I'll need to change first
you ...
I will be back soon.
mother just reminded me that,
I've to keep up my training tonight.
even tonight?
come out!
you should learn this duel sword-play.
Father-in-law...
this is the YuanYang Sword-play.
you have seen the starting action.
now I'll teach you that.
two of you attack and defend simultaneously
yuanyang Sword-play flat...
cross style...
blade up...
deep breath...
turn around and charge...
hold your gaze...
mind following the sword...
Lianzhu...backhand
Wu...forehand
full power on the edge...
swing together...
red Lotus Clan again
what brings over the Red Lady?
master, rest assured
it's Lianzhu's great day today.
there're a lot of people here.
our enemies dare not confront us.
Lord...
red lotus Clan guys are here again.
red Lotus Clan! Where are they?
du was right.
their deceptive act didn't work.
neither did ours. They're here for the Guangyuan Security cash
as the lord had earlier said...
that money should be ...
blood!
Mr. Accountant...
dragon Jin, good bye!
listen up, all you from Jin Castle...
red lotus Clan is leaving now.
we'll settle this sooner or later.
it's too easy for them.
half a day and still no movement yet...
Jiaqi, have a look at the front yard.
okay
Lianzhu, you may leave.
gosh, what a nightmare!
mother...
be good and go
Yes.
can you eat this?
sure.
you may return. I will go at the front.
okay.
they all ran away.
of course, they came for trouble
even we didn't let them seize so easily
however, it's too terrible they're all dead!
man, I'm tired!
tell me, who was the young man, acting up so ignorant and cool?
Oh, you mean Du, brother of sis-in-law.
he came here last year.
did he leave before I came?
I ain't really sure about that
but at one time, he and grandma went to visit the relatives.
it must be him then
are you alright?
yeah sure, I'm okay. I meant this village
I've met Du before.
I don't think so. Since he's come, he always follows my dad.
my dad trusts him very much these days
last time when Red lotus Clan came, they were here after that money.
I do agree.
the wedding has caused a few days delay.
so what should we do now?
the guys at Escorts must be anxious
I should go there. It's family business...
du will take care of it.
lnform grandma first if something comes up
yeah
dad, when should we go?
at the dawn.
all the arrangements have been made
open the door.
you've already been to Jin Castle twice and still don't have a clue. And , what's worse, some of our men have been wasted
that money...
master...
on the roof of Jin castle last night, we surely heard the money was in their vault.
Oh, yes!
then how come it wasn't there?
it's so strange!
last night Dragon and Tiger Jin were there.
but as of this morning they're gone
I reckon they must've moved the money away
the money isn't that important
the Jin guy is against us. Now that's heavy!
if we fail again,
red lotus Clan won't have a niche to call their own in the boxer's world
besides, as the landlord predicted, one of our great enemies is approaching us.
we've to destroy the Jin Castle.
so when we deal with the enemy, we wouldn't have to worry too much.
calm down.
number of people isn't the point.
first ask Fafu to come back.
who knows where he is?
he's probably in my place.
the White Convent
he must be there
no. He knows you will be here.
why did he still go to your place?
come on, my place is a convent!
Zhiyuan...
master
go to the convent and get your master back.
Yes.
wait. I will go with you
if he doesn't see me along, this guy, would be rather reluctant to return.
you just came, asking you to run back would be too tiring for you.
for the benefit of the clan, it's nothing.
okay, I'll see you later.
let's burn up the Jin Castle.
what's wrong with you?
I don't want to learn the Dragon Dart.
Why?
only bandits use this dart.
what? My dad uses this dart.
do you mean he's a bandit?
I ain't abusing him. It's the truth.
it's the truth that my dad is a bandit.
if you don't wish to practice just forget it
what does he actually do outside?
how am I to know that?
I do know.
what does he do?
he's a robber
you're talking nonsense
it's true, Lianzhu
do you know what a bandit does?
of course, I know.
a bandit always is an outlaw.
my dad isn't.
I witnessed him robbing money from others.
my dad does that?
Lianzhu...
I'd rather not hear this bullshit.
I wouldn't!
Lianzhu, listen...
I don't want to hear...
Lianzhu...
I don't want to hear...
look here
why do you have my dad's dart?
I don't. I was hit by your dad.
he threw it on you?
you don't believe me?
now you understand that I'm not lying.
killing the men， guarding money, looting...
that is bandit's character
I've a good family background.
I can't stay in this bandit den
absolutely no way.
you want to go?
would you leave me?
so you are staying, right?
I need to find my enemy.
Lianzhu, let's go together.
let's go together.
you can go by yourself, but not with me.
this is the rule passed on from my ancestors.
you cannot leave this place after you've practiced the Jin's skills.
what if we've to go?
then you've to defeat all the people in the family.
defeat all.
Lianzhu, this is a good chance.
dad, uncle and brother are gone
only women have been left behind
they are much easier to deal with.
you think they're all easy-going?
grandma, aunt, mom
they are all excellent boxers.
the Yuanyang Sword-play we learnt, ... is my aunt's invention.
sis-in-law is hard to handle too.
even my dad is not at home, they always strictly follow the rules.
why the hell are there such kind of rules?
I don't know.
when I was little, my aunt and her husband wanted to leave.
grandma killed him by mistake!
no wonder when I decided earlier, to leave for the sake of revenge, you dad's attitude was quite cold!
it means that we cannot leave the castle.
they killed my uncle to stop him leaving.
what was that for?
that's the rule from our ancestors.
right. To keep their lips sealed.
so secrets of Jin Castle won't be disclosed.
what's the secret?
you're really...
lmagine, people think we here are a kind sort.
no one realizes Dragon Jin is a bandit.
I won't allow you to say this.
okay. But we've to leave.
no matter stay or leave, I will be killed.
doesn't make any difference!
try it now. I don't care if I can't leave.
at least I'd know if I can
Lianzhu, determine to leave tomorrow morning.
to leave, the first thing tomorrow morning
to leave tomorrow morning
that's like good kids!
let them know about our rules.
good mornin'
sister-in-law, I um...
there's no need to say any further
grandma ordered us to go by the book
I know there's no way to stop you leaving
but I've to do something.
sister-in-law, I...
little sister, if you stay, let's go inside and discuss
there's nothing we can talk here.
let it begin
listen to me...
if you don't want to fight.
you've got to leave something here.
what?
your left arm, for example
if you refuse, then cut the crap
let's fight. I'll be rude as well
go, I'm letting you go now
sis-in-law, you've been offended
your dart moves are so good that you can protect yourself anywhere
sister-in-law, I ...
I failed.
why don't you go?
sis. we'll meet again some day
this garden is guarded by my aunt.
she's not an officious person.
can't say if she purposely walked away, and let us pass.
I don't think so.
aunt
auntie, Please forgive me.
aunt, please...
you...
aunt
go on
thank you.
thank you, auntie
come back
my husband and I had passed 4 hurdles
even your dad couldn't stop us.
at last, he was killed by grandma's stick.
both of you...
for leaving, you've risked lives to try
for the sake of being with Lianzhu, it'd be worth it even if I lose my life
we're bidding you farewell, aunt
just a moment. Let me ask you...
while I was fighting with you, why did I separate you both?
you stopped us using the Yinyang Sword-play.
then why didn't you use it?
I just learnt three moves
how about you?
I'm not familiar with it.
Lianzhu, come over.
had I invented this swordstyle much earlier, perhaps your uncle'd have been alive today
mom...
get up.
thank you, mother
I didn't give birth to such an unfilial kid
mom, your son-in-law is very dutiful
that's why I've chosen to go along with him
you sure talk sweet!
it's true, your son-in-law needs to leave
it's for the sake of finding my aunt and, to find my enemy.
you're not skillful enough.
ah ma, that's why I need to go with him to be his partner.
if you have your reason, wait until your father's back.
no.
I really don't want to stay here.
Why?
because all the people here are...
what?
I'm treated too well.
I'm afraid if I stay on longer my courage will dwindle off.
I don't want to shame my ancestors.
I need to be on my own.
it is great that you're ambitious.
but with your mere skills,
how can you protect yourself?
if anything untoward happens，not only my family would be disgraced, but also how would I face your late parents?
mom is right.
but this isn't the first time I'm travelling
and yourself?
I'll listen to him.
good, if you are on the same line, get up.
Thanks, mother
if Mom wouldn't let us go through, ... we won't get up.
you've resolved to go along with him, right!
mom.
she can't leave me and I can't leave her.
I am asking you
I...
can you leave me?
mom...
we'll always come to visit you
mom, we will come to visit you.
we're requesting you to let us pass.
well, I'm permitting you both.
but I have to go by the rules.
follow the rules, fight.
mother, please don't be so harsh on us
what can you do except begging?
mom, watch out.
look out!
Wu!
mother !
mom, you'll have to kill me first.
I've no desire to live if he dies.
Oh my! Such a shameless lass!
ma, I suggest you just kill me and pardon her
mom, I am going.
mother...
go on
Mom...take care of yourself!
mother...
Lianzhu hurts you with the dart.
it doesn't matter. You just sit down.
I meant to hurt Wu first.
she's desperate, so...
how's the wound?
it's okay. Wu's is more serious.
they still need to go through several barriers
this isn't very tough.
the last one of your grandma is the most difficult one.
even thinking of her stick gives me goosebumps
the day the plunder took place...
pretty good. You've finally reached the bridge
grandma...
do not kneel down
anyone who's learnt the Jin skills can't leave here by himself.
I haven't finished learning yet.
then how can you take your revenge?
I'll be there to help him.
you really wish to leave this place?
I beg of your mercy.
no use. If you really want to leave, you've to wait for your father.
it'll be harder for us to leave then.
it's good you realize this
therefore we request grannie's special favour
I beg you on behalf of my parents to let me leave to seek revenge.
you take revenge for piety.
Lianzhu doesn't wait for her dad.
is it piety for her?
at home I do obey my father
now I obey my husband after marrying him.
wouldn't even miss your grandma, would you?
I really would miss you.
then come back with me.
grandma, we have to leave.
how about you, Lianzhu?
say somethin'
as much as I hate to part from you,
I do need to leave with him
good. Use the Yuanyang Sword-play
the moves your elder aunt taught you
quick, Little Wu
what a girl! Playing games on me, eh!
grandma, Lianzhu implores you
you'd better kill me.
grandma...
you'd better kill me
if rebel Little Wu was to leave，even then your granddaughter would die
if I leave with him,
I'll miss you. So it's better for me to die
grannie, I'd prefer to die with Lianzhu.
I'd rather die under your stick.
we beseech grandma to help us
shame on ya!
grandma
go on, get lost!
Thanks, grandma.
you ought to thank great aunt for her advice
this swordplay was invented after her husband died.
this is how it originated
ah Ling...
ling, what are you doing?
if auntie goes, I'll leave too
ah Ling, this time your aunt...
you're still young. You don't understand.
what I don't understand?
my aunt wouldn't be leaving if you hadn't come
listen to me
we'd come back.
I know.
so I'm leaving with you and I'll come back with you.
you don't miss your mom and grandma.
you're giving it all up too!
grandma has permitted us to leave
really...
I don't care. No one will practice with me.
I'm leaving with you.
listen to me, Ling.
no.
you have to listen to me.
I haven't seen my dad yet.
why don't you wait for him?
I've something important to accomplish
you've to wait for grandfather, telling him I left in a hurry and that, will be back soon.
honestly, Ah Ling, please allow us to leave
ling, I am leaving.
you're lying to me
you won't come back soon.
do you think Ling has gone back home?
brother Du.
according to the rules, let's fight and leave the dragon valley.
how could I?
you've passed grandma. So you can.
let's practice the swords and darts.
you've taught me many times!
Oh, my skills are unpredictable!
Lianzhu, no need to talk to this bandit.
wu, you won't stand a chance against him!
no offence, Du
if you keep throwing darts,
I will let him die slowly.
brother Du
I am his woman now.
no matter dead or alive...
if you kill him, I'd rather die.
you...
or you can simply kill me!
Hmm...
Lianzhu, you may go
little Wu...
you are a cold-blooded fella
Wu...Wu
little Wu
miles of red...
love can't stay...
a helpless hero misses...
the man is carefree and wanders...
he's too deep in love...
the road ahead...
so mournful...
tonight where's my home?
where might my home be?!
captain Li...
I finally completed your order, and got back your money.
now that it's returned to you, adios!
master Jin, let me compliment you.
my whole family wouldn't ever forget this favor.
please arise...
it is my duty to wipe out the dirt.
don't take it seriously
master Jin, I...
guangyuan, we have to leave.
master Jin, I do understand that, you're here just to return the money
hence, please stay here for a few days.
my brother is worried about our home.
red lotus Clan has already struck twice
they took on Jin Castle only because of the money.
that's not the case.
bandits prevail everywhere.
jin Castle strengthens itself for protection.
it already stirs up their resentment.
we are in an opposing situation.
if you've any trouble,
I'm at your service.
I will do whatever I can, and leave no stone unturned, specially to deal with the evil Red lotus Clan
forgive me...
dad...
let me go.
take her away.
let me go.
dad...
he's dead. It's no use shouting!
you killed my dad!
I'm flattering you.
if I don't kill him, it'll be trouble.
you are all bandits.
bullshit! C'mon, give me a kiss.
hand me my whip
you sure are good lookin'!
bastard!
but a bit hot-tempered though!
you talk to her.
I won't.
if she marries me, she'll have an easy life.
little lady, my master likes you.
if you become his wife, you'll have a great deal of advantages.
what advantages?
you'll find a new girl later.
you're here to persuade
you evil bandit...
if you don't accept, you have to suffer.
I'd rather die.
won't be that easy.
don't beat her too harsh!
shit!
master, just lock her down there and starve her with them for a few days.
okay.
bastard! You rogue!
bastard!
get her down
you haven't left yet?
where are you going?
master.
aren't you returning to Red lotus Temple?
red Lotus Temple is just fine
that isn't the case
the money we got was taken back by Jin.
zhiyuan told me already.
the lord sent us a letter as well.
it said our enemy is coming towards us.
master, outside there's a couple coming...
they're carrying swords
a man and a woman!
they requested shelter for the night.
is the girl good looking?
bring them in
right.
master, I have tied her up.
good.
brother, you have kept too many girls.
Oh, that's nothing!
although I live in this temple,
I am not a true monk.
however, you shouldn't have done too much
you'd better to go back to the temple quick.
let's leave the girl outside for me.
I'll return tomorrow
okay, then you must arrange to leave tomorrow.
okay.
C'mon, clear up, Pack up.
sir, please...
please...
sorry for not welcoming you.
please forgive me.
sorry to disturb you.
we're pleased to be of help
it's no problem at all. Please...
please sit down.
can you tell me your name please?
I'm Gui. She's my wife.
Mr. Gui...
it must indeed have been a long journey!
we are from Dragon Valley.
I know the place well.
have you been there?
Yes, I've been there
the Jin Castle there, is a good place.
why did you leave?
we are in search of our enemy, and also relatives.
there is a hero called Dragon Jin.
you know my dad?
we're good friends.
then since you're his daughter, we are friends too
please sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
please have some tea.
thanks
prepare the room, as well as meals
sorry for the bother
it doesn't matter.
master Gui, it is about time to have some rest.
I'll take your leave
please.
master, I've met the man before.
they've already told me
that girl is Jin's daughter.
lnside the tea...
Lianzhu...
what?
I don't like this place.
what's wrong?
how could the nun and the monk live together?
shouldn't they be together?
and besides, did you notice that, those nuns have hairs?
hairs! Let's mind our own business!
have some tea.
wu, will we go east tomorrow?
eastwards there's a hill. Better down south.
the Red Lady Sword.
there's poison in the tea!
you're right. Something is wrong here!
that's why I hinted you, and told you to keep silent.
ought to remember; when on a trip, you shouldn't be too honest.
couldn't see through those monks earlier!
help! Help!
help! Help!
it's a dungeon down there.
take a look.
okay
thanks for saving our lives.
get up quick.
we've to leave this place immediately.
let's leave the talks for later
follow me.
don't go.
this girl is good looking.
right. Her skill is good too.
you said she's mine.
we can't keep the enemy's daughter.
red lotus Clan!
I am leaving. Give her to me.
kid, how is it?
now you know how fierce we could be!
jin Castle has always messed up my affairs
taken away the money we plundered and returned it to the Escorts
aren't you one of the guards then?
I'm the bandit.
so you're the bandit, is it!
so now you'd die peacefully.
we're the Red lotus Clan.
red lotus Clan!
that means you're the original bandits!
but you've realized it too late.
red Lady, run!
you aren't hurt, are you?
no.
thanks for your dart.
hadn't it been for that,
I'd have long been killed by the monk
I regret not learning the dart-skills too well
let's go after the bandits
it'll be a futile chase
we can't match up with those monks.
hadn't you thrown the last few of those darts, we couldn't scare them away.
last few darts?
was it you?
I didn't use a dart to hit him.
Really?
we'd better go after them
it's the Red Lady Sword again.
mind your own business.
let's practice for the revenge.
the Red Lady has saved us twice today.
no need to find.
dad used to tell me when I was a child
red Lady's skill is extremely good.
one could never know her whereabouts.
I think she has vanished!
she's right.
I need to go back to the castle to practice and then again get ready for revenge.
return to the castle.
now I understand...
father-in-law is a real hero.
well Wu, let's go home now.
the young do not fear the hardships...
they make their way back...
back to the castle to practice...
fearlessly treading on caring not for rewards
practice to enter the boxer's world...
heat up the world
bring on the challenge!
in the future,
a computer program called Skynet
will declare war on the human race.
machines have traveled back in time,
taking human form to terminate John Connor,
the future leader of the resistance;
Sarah Connor, John's mother, teacher, and protector;
cameron, a terminator reprogrammed
to defend them at all costs;
Derek Reese, John's uncle,
and the commanding officer with the resistance.
together they fight to stop Skynet
from ever being created.
the battle for our tomorrow starts today.
the Sarah Connor chronicles
come with me if you want to live.
so, um...
you've been sitting in the same exact spot
since you bailed out on English.
and your name is?
it's Riley.
what's the matter?
never brought a girl home before?
no.
we can move in today.
Oh, yeah, as soon as I figure out what
to do with all this stuff.
we'll take it. All of it.
Cromartie killed 20 FBI guys.
he's here for me.
I'm looking for the Connors.
Sarah Connor?
Mr. Dixon wanted to marry Sarah Connor
before you.
so take your wife
get as far away from here as you can.
forget me.
forget John just go.
it's not safe here anymore.
you know we always thought we'd raise kids in this house.
but you just can't plan for anything now, can you?
for the road.
did you get me that soda, babe?
Charley!
No!
Charley! Charley!
Michelle! Michelle!
Michelle!
Michelle!
Charley!
Michelle!
I've only been wanting a TV in here
for like a hundred years.
or maybe 200.
that long, huh?
well, a while.
Ex-baby daddy wouldn't have one in the bedroom.
look at where that gone.
well that, six beers, and the rhythm method.
too much information?
Yeah, a bit.
do I need to call the cable guy?
I feel like I'm not even wired in here.
there you are now.
but I wouldn't mention it to anybody.
especially the cable guy.
clever boy.
beast wizard, the kingdom of fuel
will never be ours.
now, now Seth.
that's no way to treat your brother.
beast Wizard 7.
the low budget film nobody saw,
when it was released direct-to-video
two years ago, has earned $6 million and newfound star status.
when it's star, George Lazlo,
inexplicably killed 20 members
of an FBI hostage rescue team
in a shootout at his reseda apartment.
the massacre you may recall,
also took the actor's life.
a friend of mine from culinary school,
did craft services on that movie.
she liked the guy. He ate with the crew.
this town can screw you up.
what are you doing?
this is the absolute center of the house.
excellent. Good work.
the house is moving.
what?
moving.
the east by southeast section
of the house is moving.
Really? Where's it going?
down.
at a rate of 0. 93 millimeters per year.
and what?
does that affect the security system,
or sightlines for the night scope?
how does this affect the safety Of one John Connor？
it doesn't.
but next summer we're going to have to repaint.
did you get Kacy's TV set up?
Yup.
I hope you didn't steal cable for her.
nobody that pregnant should be foed
to watch network television.
it's bad for the baby.
you don't know anything about babies.
I know they grow up.
18 November.
Johnny? that's the code, right?
John?
Yeah.
where are you?
we uh,
were on our way out of town.
um, we're leaving.
Why?
just um,
can you, can you-- can you hang on a second,
please, John?
okay, I'm...
I'm back. just, um...
just listen, okay, um
I just need to say goodbye to your mom.
I didn't get a chance to say good-bye and, um
and she wouldn't give me her phone number.
I was just hoping maybe you could um,
you know, maybe you could just have her give me a call?
hang on.
it's for you.
Hello?
Sarah.
he took my wife.
what do you want me to say, Charley?
just hel-- help me Sarah, please.
we were just leaving town.
and he just, he just-- he just took her!
I mean, with John standing right here.
what am I supposed to say?
look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.
please.
please just help me, Sarah.
you shouldn't have called here, Charley.
you were right to leave.
I don't want to know where you are,
in case I need you.
I'm not going to need you.
it's better for you if I can't find you.
you understand?
wait, hold on a sec-- are you, um...
are you asking me where I am?
Yes, I am.
I'm just at some fruit stand.
it's uh...
it's just somewhere off the 14.
just um, south of the California city turnoff.
I think. Please.
I really need your help, Sarah.
stay safe, Charley.
I told you not to give him your number.
there's something alive up there.
is it something that can hurt us?
it's a bird.
I'll kill it before it flies away.
no.
maybe later?
maybe never.
John's going to buy computers today.
go with him.
do not let him out of your sight.
is there anything I need to know?
you need to know not to let him out of your sight.
and don't touch that bird.
cromartie's got Charley Dixon's wife.
Where's John?
I sent him to get the new computers.
he's with Cameron. They don't know.
well, where are you going?
you know where I'm going. Come if you want.
you can't go.
and yet I am.
it's a ploy to get John.
it's a trap.
I know that.
you don't see John here, do you?
it's the absolute wrong thing to do.
it wouldn't be the first time.
just wait. All right.
just wait.
hurry up.
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, Cameron, Cameron.
let me help you with that.
I didn't need any help.
Yeah, you did.
right.
I'm bored. You want to hang out?
Oh, I forgot. 18 November.
where are you?
promenade.
the magazine stand in front of the coffee bar.
I'm captivated by the Lohan.
I could be there in like, 15 minutes, you know.
the world could end in 15 minutes.
I'm going to vote I doubt it.
you never know.
lotta Lohan. Just stay there.
okay?
Hey. Can you drop me off?
was that Riley?
that's none of your business.
your mother told me to keep an eye on you.
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean you have
to go everywhere I do.
Yes, it does.
just because my mother said it,
doesn't make it so.
I'm not a child anymore.
I could go to the store, or see a friend,
or do whatever the hell else people like me do.
there are no other people like you.
just drop me off.
I had heard the trees in this forest
grew lovely fruit.
yet truly, I had no idea.
I must warn you, my lady.
my striped friend is an excellent climber.
agent James Ellison, please.
speaking.
my name is Catherine Weaver, Mr. Ellison.
I'd like to talk to you about an opportunity.
I'm not interested in any opportunities.
a job opportunity, agent Ellison.
I presume you won't be returning to the FBI,
once your leave of absence is over.
how'd you get my number?
I'll tell you about it at lunch.
shall we say... 1: 00?
my assistant will give you the information.
no. I don't know who you are.
and um, I'm very busy.
you're not busy.
come to lunch.
we'll talk about who or what,
actually killed your colleagues.
come on. Come on.
where would he take her?
I don't know.
then how are we going to find her?
I don't know.
you don't know?
no.
that thing could be watching us right now.
we need to go.
what we need to do is find my wife.
look, she won't tell you the truth, but I will.
that thing took your wife to get to John.
you think it gives a damn about her?
your wife's dead.
it's her, hmm?
make sure it's really her.
they can imitate our voices. You need to be sure.
baby.
Charley... Charley...
honey, are you okay?
are you hurt? No.
Is-is-is he there with you?
Yeah, he's in the next room.
I can hear him.
where are you?
um, outside Mojave.
in an...abandoned building.
about uh, four-- five miles off the highway.
the 14? Yeah.
there's a-- a billboard for a,
I don't know, a law firm.
a dirt road runs in front of it.
it goes east-- make sure it's her.
it's her.
you think I don't know my own wife?
Charley.
make sure.
all right, babe.
I need you to pay attention right now. Okay?
the first night you and I ever made love,
where was it?
what?
just answer the question, please.
the first time that we made love.
where was it?
uh, the beach...?
which beach?
Charley, I don't know...
what?
Malibu.
paradise cove.
okay, and what happened at dinner that night?
what do you mean, Charley? what do you mean?
I don't know.
just please, Michelle. Answer the question.
what happened at dinner?
Oh, god... the magician took my watch?
I love you, baby.
all right? just
we're going to come get you,
just please... just please hang tight.
Michelle?
Michelle?
please.
why are you doing this?
why are you-- no, no, no.
please don't tape my mouth.
I won't scream. I swear I won't scream.
I won't scream.
in 1897, James Atkinson invented the mousetrap.
the spring slams shut in 38 thousands of a second.
it is a record that has never been beaten.
it is hard to build a better one.
you know what really creeps me out about these magazines?
they all just want to convert you into their cult.
it's like... all in the titles.
it's us. And people, and ok.
you know some of us people
aren't okay.
some of us are popular mechanics.
exactly.
and some of us are guns and ammo.
Yeah, you're more a yarn collector.
you're the yarn collector.
yarn collector.
so um...
you coming back to school?
no.
no, I don't think so.
my mom wants to, uh...
home school me for a while.
hmm.
sounds like a good time will be had by all.
what?
you miss me?
ease up, cat fancy.
I don't even know
your top ten brands of scratching post.
cat fancy
dude. Your sister.
we should go. Now.
wait. How do we uh...
how do we get inside here?
getting inside's not the problem.
try to hit something metal.
wait.
don't touch her.
Derek...
they never let you have a good day, do they?
I'm going to take the tape off.
don't move.
do not move.
you understand?
not one inch.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Oh, god. Hey...
Hey, Michelle. Listen to me.
you're sitting on a bomb.
if you move. It will go off.
baby. Hey.
we're going to get you out of this chair.
okay? and then
and then we're all going to get out of here.
but, just please...
you have to listen to her.
please.
where is he?
if I'm not back in 15 minutes,
leave without me.
just get me out.
get me out of here. Get me out.
Michelle, baby. Baby... shh.
I'm trying, Charley. I'm trying.
but the more I sit here, the more I want to stand up.
my legs are on fire.
it's the adrenaline.
I know it's the adrenaline.
I just have to get up.
they're on fire.
it's like they're full of as.
if you move. You will die.
we all will.
baby. Look at me, hey.
it's all going to be all right.
I promise.
no Charley, it's never going to be okay.
never.
there's a bag in the truck.
red handles.
I'm going to need it, Charley.
Charley.
what are you doing here?
I know he brought you. But you didn't have to come.
Yes, I did.
for Charley?
I just did.
frankly, I thought it'd be easier.
I thought you'd be dead.
he killed the car.
we're going to have to walk out of here.
what?
it doesn't make any sense.
he messes with the car and not us.
we're human. Not that hard to kill.
whoa, w-w-wait. Wait. Sarah.
molding clay.
sonofabitch.
cut her free.
was it fake?
this whole thing was a fake?
he wants John.
he doesn't have to kill us to get to him.
if we're stuck here with no way back.
I should have known when you weren't dead.
John, 18 November. Where are you?
2007. Promenade.
is Cameron with you?
uh, yeah. Why?
I need you to stay out. Don't go home.
don't go to Kacy's.
don't go any place familiar.
find a place to hide until I call you.
Yeah, okay.
just promise me, John.
so, what do you think?
John!
Yeah, all right. I promise.
okay, you can do better than that.
cat fancy.
stay with Cameron.
don't call me. I'll call you.
okay, fine.
well?
That's...yeah. That's awesome.
that was your weird sister, right?
no, it was my weird mother.
run! There's a bomb.
get out! go! go!
everyone good?
everyone good?
Sarah?
I'm good. Everyone good?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm okay.
the cell tower out back.
he blew it.
after he tapped your call to John.
he has John's number. And the code.
that won't work now.
Aw, baby, baby. You okay?
Charley, move.
are you okay? Yeah.
are you? Let's go.
mom.
18 November.
2007
change of plans, John.
how far are you from the pier?
the pier? A few blocks, I don't know.
wait for me there. And turn off your phone.
what is going on? Where are you?
don't worry about me, John.
just get to the pier.
I'm sorry. I have to go.
what?
I thought we were going to the movies.
I have to meet my mom at the pier.
Seriously?
Riley, uh...
look John, I'm not afraid of your mother.
not like you are.
I have to go. I'll call you.
don't forget the secret code!
come on.
I figure it's five miles to the highway
if we head due west.
across the desert.
we need a car.
we need to get to John.
Oh, god.
Charley?
how bad is it?
I can't tell.
I--I can't tell if the shrapnel
Knicked an artery or something...
she could be bleeding out, inside, I don't know.
we have to go.
go? go how?
on foot.
no way, Sarah. uh-uh.
I'm not moving her. And I'm not making her walk.
I'll send someone back for you as soon as I can.
I can walk.
no one has to wait on me.
so...
you know who I am.
you know what happened.
george Lazlo was the shooter.
george Lazlo is dead.
it's all in the report.
and yet here you are.
five years ago,
a small commuter jet went down in the eastern Sierras.
on its way from Sacramento to Portland.
my brother was on the N.T.S.B.team
that investigated the accident.
he found these.
and brought them to me.
my late husband and I have spent three years
and $20 million.
trying to reverse engineer this technology.
we've not been successful.
yet.
red valley, New Mexico.
eight years ago.
22 witnesses report seeing a man
with some kind of robot leg.
try to kill a boy later identified as John Connor.
John Connor?
son of Sarah Connor.
it was your case.
she believed robots were after her son.
I know what she believed, ms. Weaver.
you know what really killed those agents.
you did not even pretend to ask me
what those were.
what do you want from me?
I want what you want, Mr. Ellison.
I want answers.
but more than that,
I want you to help me find another one.
Where's John?
Michelle!
get out.
out!
Sarah, slow down!
she's bleeding out.
I need to get pressure on it, Sarah.
damn you, Charley. I told you to stay away.
Oh, god!
Sarah, you've got to stop now, please!
you should have stayed away.
I'm here now and she's here now.
you've got to stop now!
little help?
I don't swim.
Yeah, I just figured that out.
John.
mom, I'm good. Let's go.
do not lose heart.
though outwardly we are wasting away,
inwardly, we are being renewed day-by-day
for our light and momentary troubles...
are achieving for us an eternal glory,
that far outweighs them all.
for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens
for God has given us the spirit as a guarantee and as long as we are at home in the body
we are away from the Lord
we walk by faith not by sight
and so fix our eyes not on what is seen
but on what is unseen.
for what is seen is temporary.
what is unseen...
eternal.
martin bedell.
his name was martin bedell.
he was in century work camp with you.
right up until the escape.
so I knew him.
you knew him.
everybody knew him.
but he doesn't know this one, does he?
not this martin bedell.
no, another martin bedell.
maybe it's just coincidence.
how many coincidences named sarah connor got killed,
before skynet finally locked in on you?
so why would they want to kill him?
he had experience and knowledge john needed.
military prep school, then west point.
bedell had real training.
he helped john put the resistance together.
okay,
there were three martin bedells in l. a.
now there are two.
so how do we know which one is the target?
they both are.
machines are thorough.
only good thing about them.
so it took you, what, 30 seconds to find those names?
if there is a triple-eight out there,
he's found them too.
where are you going?
martin bedell number one.
closest address.
without a plan?
Yeah, I've got a plan.
it involves guns.
wait.
you're not going with him.
no. everybody wait.
P. alto.
we thought it was a person. it's not, it's a place.
it's a military prep school in carlsbad.
here's the student directory.
martin bedell number two.
maybe we got a head start.
I'll load the truck.
we'll go.
we will, will we?
it's a boys school.
I can do this.
I am doing this.
nothing complicated.
find the kid,
throw him in a hole, babysit.
it's as safe as anything we do.
go.
two.
two sarah connors were murdered
before they found me.
cameron and I will find the other martin bedell.
maybe we can stop the triple-eight
before he gets to you.
he's not a soldier.
no.
not yet.
you haven't said a word since anaheim.
that's 40 miles of quiet.
U, u, u thinking or worrying?
thinking.
about bedell.
after we grab him, where are we supposed to hide him?
who said we were going to hide him?
martin bedell hiding in a cave somewhere
might as well be martin bedell dead somewhere.
no use to john connor.
besides, it's a military school.
soldiers, guns,
can't do much better than that.
so you own this nuclear plant, serrano point?
I have an interest in it.
is this the same company you were referring to the other day?
the one you wanted me to look into?
it is.
the near-meltdown a few weeks back...
the news said an employee caused the accident.
Mr. ellison,
there are no accidents.
Kansas, this is hammerhead. do you copy?
Kansas, respond! it's kyle. he's back.
tin cans just hit kansas bunker.
survivors?
prisoners now.
one ogre tank, three monkey wagons.
the convoy will roll out
down wilshire to century in the next hour.
and I'm thinking
no, uh-uh. we've got our orders.
Connor wants this corridor controlled.
so we sit tight,
we observe skynet movement,
and we'll report back
at regular intervals, and that's it.
what's that report going to say?
that we observed skynet move these people into a death camp
while we sat?
I know! I know it sucks, all right?
but if we lose eyes on this road,
we could lose a lot more than one bunker, kyle.
if connor were here
Connor isn't here.
corporal, get below.
round up every tunnel rat you can find.
Martin.
you know what he'd say.
you know what connor would say.
Yes, I know what he'd say.
if connor wants to shoot me for disobeying orders,
he can get in line behind the tin cans.
we're doing this.
you all right?
we see a lot of boys like your nephew, lieutenant.
single mother. socially withdrawn.
move around a lot.
tend to cling to male authority figures.
lost his dad, you said, in the war?
killed.
on a mission.
can't tell you any more than that.
don't know?
can't.
I understand.
well...
good grades. good test scores.
good kid.
here's what I'll do.
three weeks as a plebe.
if he likes it, he can stay.
then we'll talk tuition.
thank you.
I'll give him the news.
lieutenant.
I lost one of my tacs a couple weeks ago.
reservist. had to go.
tac. teacher-advisor.
they keep the cadets
from going all lord of the flies on us.
hired a replacement, but he's not due for a week.
I'm shorthanded.
sir... respectfully,
I'm probably the last guy you're looking for.
guys like you get dropped into the ass end of nowhere.
you can handle 30 adolescents for a week.
good news. you're in.
and what's the bad news?
I'm in.
man up, nube!
you don't want to get owned.
stop crying about your internet connection,
and learn to play.
I got to e. f.k. man.
martin bedell?
yes?
come on, let's go.
hurry up! Go!
go! go!
drive.
you good? you okay?
seatbelt.
who is that man? he should be dead.
how come he's not dead
and where's my mom?
no more questions.
your mother's current location is unknown.
that man is a cyborg
sent to kill you.
Cameron!
get your seatbelt on.
I don't care about the reports, mr. nelson.
I know what they say.
what I don't know is what really happened.
people who wrote that report are bureaucrats.
you know what bureaucrats do when the facts
don't fit their little checkboxes?
ignore them.
or change them.
so this valve supposedly blew open
because of metal fatigue.
sure. okay.
not likely, but let's grant mother nature that one.
so how in the hell did it force itself closed?
okay.
how strong do you have to be,
to force it open and push it back?
on a scale of one to ten?
Superman.
report says this damage
was caused by a transformer explosion.
you want to see what the security tapes say?
there are no tapes.
they're gone. that they are.
and who took those?
Carl greenway, on the way to hanging himself?
those mystery employees who shut the reactor down?
you ask the same questions I would.
putting together a report for the nrc.
they're going to crawl up this place's ass
with a wire brush.
it's going to play hell with the schedule.
schedule?
what schedule is that?
august 2009.
new automated system comes online.
we're back in business.
that's what they say.
of course, that ain't going to happen
if the feds are on a war path.
you jammed? yeah.
you know sports?
like wrestling?
no, it's a memonic.
sports. s-p-o-r-t-s. may i?
all right. so you want to slap.
pull.
observe.
release.
tap.
shoot.
all right. thanks, plebe.
you're welcome, I think.
Baum.
I'm cadet captain martin bedell.
commandant asked me to keep an eye on you.
prep you for o. c.c.
what's this?
it's a merit... for squaring away pyle.
and that's a demerit.
next time you have a problem,
flag down a senior cadet or an instructor.
you run, baum?
I love to run.
you look ate up.
Oh, no. this is great.
Yeah. imagine how it's going
to be with a marine d. i. screaming at you.
like everything's life and death.
I can imagine.
that the new tac?
good ambush point.
in case you're looking for one.
or in case you choose to jog in the woods.
by yourself.
you should be careful.
of that, too.
it's tar. la brea.
it's everywhere.
that stuff smells terrible.
it smells like
jet fuel.
so...
you're out here jogging, in the open,
exposed, with...
bedell.
I've heard a lot about you.
a lot of good, I hope, sir.
lot of good.
so when do I get to call my mom?
when it's safe.
when's that?
soon.
do you do this every night?
Yeah.
well, what happens when you go to sleep?
she happens.
let's find you something to wear for bed.
something in here should fit you.
try these.
this is too small.
how do you know? just try them.
they're for a five year old.
how 'bout this?
uh, that's for playing soccer.
uh, this isn't your stuff. is it?
no. it's not our stuff.
I want to call my mom.
she was supposed to get me a book.
for my book report.
if you call your mother,
that man will use her to find you.
then he'll kill her.
he'll kill you.
uh, cameron.
would you like a bedtime story?
we made a tactical error.
we should have engaged the triple-eight.
with a little boy in the crossfire?
the boy is not important. he is not our mission
he is now.
it's just a meet and greet, sir.
say hi.
ask them how they're holding up.
then company dismissed.
it's easy.
Oh, they're probably going to want
to ask you about o. c.c. prep weekend
we take the juniors through field exercises.
obstacle courses, simulated missions.
running around in the woods, you know?
it'll be fun.
fun.
Hi, I'm lieutenant baum.
I'm your new tac.
so I've been told
that my job is to make sure that you're all doing okay.
well, you all look okay to me.
so, um...
any questions?
all right, then.
sir.
we heard you were in the war.
heard you seen action.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've seen action in the war.
got a lot of kills?
say again?
kills, sir.
I want to go infantry as soon as I get out of here.
maybe rangers. maybe delta.
best of the best.
best of the best.
counting kills.
like it's a game.
like it's just a game.
I remember one particularly fun day.
a guy in my squad
got his stomach blasted open in a fire fight.
he spent six hours holding his own guts in.
his buddy carried him on his back
to the nearest aide station, just praying that someone
could put the dumb son of a bitch together again.
the game, pyle,
the game is played with your buddy's life.
with the life of your squad.
your platoon.
the game is played by you.
on behalf of the whole damn human race.
meet my friend, the e. f.p.
he sits in the middle of the road
and blows up metal.
this is his life's ambition.
I intend to help him achieve it.
we've seeded the street with these things.
we got to make sure that ogre cooperates.
corporal reese will take you
and set up over at lacma and the page.
when the convoy rolls to your position, open fire
on this bunker.
the ogre will think it's metal on skin
and move to assist.
and when it does, boom.
questions?
move out.
they're kids. they key off of you.
I know.
your uncle...
he's an intense guy.
Yeah, I know.
he's a good guy, though.
he's just-- he's a lot to take sometimes.
all that he's been through.
you know...
what are you supposed to say to that?
you mean, how do you measure up?
every man in my family, going back five generations,
has been a general or statesman,
ceo, something amazing,
they all went here.
but you know what the best part
about presidio alto is?
the cross-country course.
you know, sometimes when I'm out there
when I'm all alone,
and I'm going flat-out
everything just, sort of,
falls away.
but sometimes, I wish that...
wish you could just keep on running
and never look back.
I met this girl
over the summer.
her name is alicia.
she's amazing, dude.
she started at dartmouth this year.
she's a runner like me.
she's coming home in a couple of weeks.
when she goes back,
I think I want to go with her...
and never look back.
that's a secret, baum.
you treat it as such.
I always do.
I was just on the roof.
there's flat terrain all around,
but, uh, the woods are a problem.
when the triple-eight comes,
that's where it'll come from.
you're alone and exposed here.
it's not good.
and you're going to tell me I know better.
bedell is quitting.
leaving school.
no, he isn't.
he won't.
well, he is.
he doesn't.
he graduates.
goes to west point.
Why?
because the future already happened
and he's just going through the motions?
he doesn't have a choice?
he's got a choice.
we've just got to help him make the right one.
like everybody does with me.
there are three exits within 20 meters,
two of them lead to a parking lot,
d d the's a black hatchback
three cars in with the doors unlocked
and the keys above the visor.
I do know better.
we're begging you.
be merciful and keep our son safe.
Marty, if you can hear this,
we're going to get you back.
you're dad and I love-- turn that off.
what the hell were you thinking, letting him watch that?
he wanted to see his mother.
you all right?
I told you people.
and I told you I had to get it done by monday.
and it's friday already.
and I haven't even started,
and I'm already in trouble,
and when you don't do it,
the teacher makes you stand up in front of the whole class!
Marty, slow down.
you're hyperventilating.
there.
take a breath.
tell me what this is about.
I told you.
my book report.
book report?
Yeah. it's due by monday.
and I haven't even picked out a book, yet.
don't you listen?
let's find you one.
there's got to be something for you somewhere.
it was john's favorite.
who's john?
the machine won't stop.
he'll go back to that kid's house,
find his parents, find his mom.
I would.
the police'll be there by now.
police won't matter.
I know.
you don't need to be here.
there are other places to be.
you want me to protect his parents?
I want you to keep this contained.
something you need, officer?
good eye.
job requirement.
right.
private sector.
looking into the plant accident.
when carl greenway went nuts?
Yeah. when carl greenway went nuts.
I understand he used to come in here.
they all do. including carl.
sit right where you're sitting.
drink alone.
drink a lot?
tonic water.
like you, I bet.
was he alone like me?
pretty much every night.
I don't know why the guy came in here at all.
still, I do remember some hottie
chatting him up at the bar the night before
everything went down at the power plant.
probably one of sandy's friends.
Sandra runs h. r. at the plant.
her birthday party that night,
I got pictures.
may i?
find who you're looking for?
actually, quite the opposite.
these going to kill it?
no, a speed bump. that's all.
now, this...
Raufoss.
mark 211 round.
tungsten core, armor piercing.
high explosive incendiary.
hits with the force of a 20 millimeter cannon.
saw your dad take down an h-k with one of those.
he liked it better than his plasma rifle.
so this is going to kill it.
it'll make it stop.
reconsider its life choices.
that soldier...
the one you talked about in your story.
my dad carried him to that aid station,
didn't he?
Yeah.
he spent a whole night in the bunker,
trying to get the blood out of his fatigues.
you know what's funny?
I saw a deer the other day.
it made me think of him.
we were together the last time I saw one.
before judgment day?
no. after.
we were up in griffith park, hunting for food.
it was a big bastard too.
your dad had never seen one before.
I mean, not like that.
after I killed it and we got close...
your dad started crying.
you know, more than I'd ever heard
or seen him.
I didn't know how to make him stop.
I buried the deer.
we went hungry.
he was just a boy.
so were you.
Yep.
I guess I was.
you see how the metal is twisted?
you can have the steelers' entire offensive line
Tuggin' on that valve
and not generate enough force to do that.
so you agree it was a machine,
as I thought.
two machines.
one machine ripped the valve open,
and I'm guessing
the other closed it.
and I'm pretty sure there was a fight between them.
two machines.
this is new.
where did they come from?
why did they fight?
um, I wish I knew.
I wish any of this made sense.
I do know I'm not the only one asking questions.
the plant manager, nelson.
he wants the nrc to investigate.
it'll be a nightmare.
that will complicate our respective goals,
won't it, james?
what would those respective goals be?
I'd like my company
to lead the world into the next century.
and I'm fairly sure
you're an avenging angel.
so let's keep looking.
before the nightmare begins.
last one.
Hey, it's for my heart.
you never heard of the french paradox?
those frogs eat foie gras
and gargle red wine
they live till they're 90.
Yeah, but it's the chemicals
in the grape skins that do it.
well, uh...
Bonjour.
Resvera...something.
I saw it on 60 minutes.
you don't say.
you're so beautiful.
sorry, alicia.
that's never happened before.
don't worry, sweetie.
I bet that never happened before, either.
the fbi has moved marty's parents.
and the triple-eight?
he's made no attempt to acquire them.
so what would you do now?
in your professional robot opinion.
Marty's trail has gone cold.
I'd switch targets to the other martin bedell.
so go to the other martin bedell's house.
wait for the triple-eight.
when it shows up, blow it's head off.
he can put it back on.
Marty likes the crust cut off.
here you go.
my teacher doesn't like us to pick books
that have been made into movies.
she thinks we'll just cheat and watch the movie instead.
you'd be in big trouble if you did.
the movie is pretty different than the book.
Really?
how?
well, the slippers aren't ruby.
they're silver.
and there are two good witches, not one.
and dorothy's not 16,
she's nearer your age.
smart and brave.
if that guy finds me,
he's really going to kill me.
he won't touch you.
I promise.
Baum.
how you holding up?
shouldn't you be digging a tunnel outta here or something?
I'm not just going to skip out on my buddies.
I owe them this much.
not everybody gets to run away, you know.
pick up the pace, baum.
I'm not going to carry you up this hill.
triple-eight has been to that kid's house.
it knows about the school. it has his picture.
how long?
cameron says two, maybe three hours.
she's on her way.
you tolde you'u'throw that kid in a hole.
babysit. nothing complicated.
it won't touch him.
I won't let it.
you better not.
cause if you do,
pray that triple-eight gets to you before I do.
is, uh-- is everything okay?
everything's fine.
look, I'm sorry. I didn't
I didn't mean this.
this was never the plan, ever.
what was the plan?
I don't know.
you can't always have one. not all the time.
sometimes you just do.
and I did.
to you.
well...
you saved my life, right?
so... good plan.
thank you.
I said thank you.
I know. I just...
I haven't heard that in...
I haven't heard that.
you're welcome?
say it.
you're welcome.
now say, "marty...
let me help you with your book report.
I can't call my mom and...
you're not doing anything.
so...
thank you, marty.
you're welcome.
tonight's exercise is a rescue extraction.
meet old fred.
he weighs about 75 pounds,
and needs to be carried from place to place.
this is his life's ambition.
and I intend to help him
forget that! all eyes on me.
seniors...
get your people online.
ten meter spacing. eyes up.
what about the obstacle course?
new exercise.
a guy with a gun is going to come through here.
do not initiate contact.
not even for laughs. are we clear?
you see him, you send a hand signal up the line.
if I see that hand signal before I see our infiltrator,
you win.
exercise over.
and where will you be?
looking for that hand signal.
you're with me.
you too.
those are detonators.
claymore simulators.
here, here, and here.
now you wait for the signal.
you watch for me
to lead the infiltrator past this line.
when he enters the kill zone,
you hit the detonator, simulators go off.
end of story. we go home.
wait, sir.
the last-minute change of mission?
pre-positioned equipment?
claymore simulators?
what?
we're not having fun?
Aw, son of a bitch!
no, no, no, no!
Aw! got to be a little more specific.
straight shot from one of the kids must've.
must've hit one of the f-p's.
it's set them all off, it's a chain reaction.
we're just swinging in the wind.
Where's the ogre?
it's coming to kill us all.
where the hell do you think it is?
where is the tank?
about a block away.
moving towards us.
there's no way we've got enough powder to kill it.
I'm going to lay down some covering fire,
maybe drop a couple endos.
that'll give kyle enough time to get back.
Reese...
we can kill that ogre.
we got one more magic bullet.
we just got to get it out there.
the emerald city was soon left far behind.
as they advanced, "the ground became rougher and hillier.
for there were no farms nor houses "in this country of the west.
before night, "dorothy, and toto, and the lion lay down "upon the grass and fell asleep, "with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch.
now, "the wicked witch had but one eye.
yet she could see everywhere.
she saw dorothy lying asleep,
with her friends all about her.
the wicked witch looked out with her one eye.
she said to the king crow, fly at once to those strangers.
peck out their eyes.
tear them to pieces.'
the wild crows flew in one great flock, "toward dorothy and her companions.
when the little girl saw them coming,
she was afraid.
come here.
but the scarecrow said, "'this is my battle, 'lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.'
look over here!
it's me! connor!
John connor!
the witch got into a terrible rage.
she couldn't understand how all her plans "to destroy the strangers had failed.
there was only one way left
to destroy dorothy and her friends.
want me to read for awhile?
the sky darkened and a low rumbling sound "was heard in the air.
there was a rushing of many wings, "a great chattering and laughing, "and the sun came out of the dark sky "to show the witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys.
go to the strangers and destroy them all,'
said the wicked witch.
but dorothy they did not harm at all.
careful and gently, they lifted dorothy
in their arms and carried her to the witch.
the witch looked into the child's eyes "and saw how simple the soul behind them was, "and that she did not know of her wonderful power.
the witch said to dorothy, "'come with me;
for if you do not, I will make an end of you.'
the little girl grew angry.
you are a wicked creature!' she cried.
in her anger, she picked up a bucket of water "that stood near and dashed it over the witch, "wetting her from head to foot.
the witch gave a cry of fear.
as dorothy looked in wonder, "the witch began to shrink away.
see what you have done!' the witch screamed.
I shall melt away.'
with these words, she fell "into a melted shapeless ms.
the wicked witch had come to an end.
being at last free to do as she chose, "dorothy ran,
no longer a prisoner in a strange land.
six stops down, there's a pay phone
to call your mom.
you got your money?
if you get into trouble, you call me.
say "book report" and I'll come.
whatever it is, I'll come.
are you a spy?
no, I'm not a spy.
are you a mom?
Yeah, I'm a mom.
you kind of suck at it.
I know. I'm working on it.
let's catch your bus.
so this...
this is what I'm supposed to do?
stay here, graduate, go to west point?
like I don't know the end of the world is coming?
like any of this-- any of it really matters?
it does matter.
it all matters.
you believe that?
I've got to.
I'll see you around, connor.
Yeah. I guess you will.
sometimes I wish
I could just wake up from all this.
like from a dream.
but I can't, can i?
you want to know what happened...
to bedell-- what really happened?
I don't know. do i?
guess it depends on who I'm talking to.
John baum or john connor.
Baum is just a name.
I'll go.
Reese, I run faster than you.
you run like a duck.
you'll never make it.
he's my brother.
you want to save kyle or die trying?
give me the damn e. f.p.
please.
I want to take this one.
run like hell, okay?
bedell, you run like hell.
when this thing goes off, you pop those wagons.
you get those people out.
don't be a hero.
go!
and he ran.
he ran so fast.
fast enough to get to that tank
before it got to kyle's position.
fast enough to blow it sky-high.
we rescued 40 prisoners that day.
one of them was john connor.
martin was always a great runner.
but n one...
no one could outrun a blast like that.
he died, john.
he died for you.
we all die for you.
martin bedell.
his name was martin bedell.
he was in century work camp with you.
right up until the escape.
so I knew him.
you knew him.
everybody knew him.
but he doesn't know this one, does he?
not this martin bedell.
no, another martin bedell.
maybe it's just coincidence.
how many coincidences named sarah connor got killed,
before skynet finally locked in on you?
so why would they want to kill him?
he had experience and knowledge john needed.
military prep school, then west point.
bedell had real training.
he helped john put the resistance together.
okay,
there were three martin bedells in l. a.
now there are two.
so how do we know which one is the target?
they both are.
machines are thorough.
only good thing about them.
so it took you, what, 30 seconds to find those names?
if there is a triple-eight out there,
he's found them too.
where are you going?
martin bedell number one.
closest address.
without a plan?
Yeah, I've got a plan.
it involves guns.
wait.
you're not going with him.
no. everybody wait.
P. alto.
we thought it was a person. it's not, it's a place.
it's a military prep school in carlsbad.
here's the student directory.
martin bedell number two.
maybe we got a head start.
I'll load the truck.
we'll go.
we will, will we?
it's a boys school.
I can do this.
I am doing this.
nothing complicated.
find the kid,
throw him in a hole, babysit.
it's as safe as anything we do.
go.
two.
two sarah connors were murdered
before they found me.
cameron and I will find the other martin bedell.
maybe we can stop the triple-eight
before he gets to you.
he's not a soldier.
no.
not yet.
you haven't said a word since anaheim.
that's 40 miles of quiet.
U, u, u thinking or worrying?
thinking.
about bedell.
after we grab him, where are we supposed to hide him?
who said we were going to hide him?
martin bedell hiding in a cave somewhere
might as well be martin bedell dead somewhere.
no use to john connor.
besides, it's a military school.
soldiers, guns,
can't do much better than that.
so you own this nuclear plant, serrano point?
I have an interest in it.
is this the same company you were referring to the other day?
the one you wanted me to look into?
it is.
the near-meltdown a few weeks back...
the news said an employee caused the accident.
Mr. ellison,
there are no accidents.
Kansas, this is hammerhead. do you copy?
Kansas, respond! it's kyle. he's back.
tin cans just hit kansas bunker.
survivors?
prisoners now.
one ogre tank, three monkey wagons.
the convoy will roll out
down wilshire to century in the next hour.
and I'm thinking
no, uh-uh. we've got our orders.
Connor wants this corridor controlled.
so we sit tight,
we observe skynet movement,
and we'll report back
at regular intervals, and that's it.
what's that report going to say?
that we observed skynet move these people into a death camp
while we sat?
I know! I know it sucks, all right?
but if we lose eyes on this road,
we could lose a lot more than one bunker, kyle.
if connor were here
Connor isn't here.
corporal, get below.
round up every tunnel rat you can find.
Martin.
you know what he'd say.
you know what connor would say.
Yes, I know what he'd say.
if connor wants to shoot me for disobeying orders,
he can get in line behind the tin cans.
we're doing this.
you all right?
we see a lot of boys like your nephew, lieutenant.
single mother. socially withdrawn.
move around a lot.
tend to cling to male authority figures.
lost his dad, you said, in the war?
killed.
on a mission.
can't tell you any more than that.
don't know?
can't.
I understand.
well...
good grades. good test scores.
good kid.
here's what I'll do.
three weeks as a plebe.
if he likes it, he can stay.
then we'll talk tuition.
thank you.
I'll give him the news.
lieutenant.
I lost one of my tacs a couple weeks ago.
reservist. had to go.
tac. teacher-advisor.
they keep the cadets
from going all lord of the flies on us.
hired a replacement, but he's not due for a week.
I'm shorthanded.
sir... respectfully,
I'm probably the last guy you're looking for.
guys like you get dropped into the ass end of nowhere.
you can handle 30 adolescents for a week.
good news. you're in.
and what's the bad news?
I'm in.
man up, nube!
you don't want to get owned.
stop crying about your internet connection,
and learn to play.
I got to e. f.k. man.
martin bedell?
yes?
come on, let's go.
hurry up! Go!
go! go!
drive.
you good? you okay?
seatbelt.
who is that man? he should be dead.
how come he's not dead
and where's my mom?
no more questions.
your mother's current location is unknown.
that man is a cyborg
sent to kill you.
Cameron!
get your seatbelt on.
I don't care about the reports, mr. nelson.
I know what they say.
what I don't know is what really happened.
people who wrote that report are bureaucrats.
you know what bureaucrats do when the facts
don't fit their little checkboxes?
ignore them.
or change them.
so this valve supposedly blew open
because of metal fatigue.
sure. okay.
not likely, but let's grant mother nature that one.
so how in the hell did it force itself closed?
okay.
how strong do you have to be,
to force it open and push it back?
on a scale of one to ten?
Superman.
report says this damage
was caused by a transformer explosion.
you want to see what the security tapes say?
there are no tapes.
they're gone. that they are.
and who took those?
Carl greenway, on the way to hanging himself?
those mystery employees who shut the reactor down?
you ask the same questions I would.
putting together a report for the nrc.
they're going to crawl up this place's ass
with a wire brush.
it's going to play hell with the schedule.
schedule?
what schedule is that?
august 2009.
new automated system comes online.
we're back in business.
that's what they say.
of course, that ain't going to happen
if the feds are on a war path.
you jammed? yeah.
you know sports?
like wrestling?
no, it's a memonic.
sports. s-p-o-r-t-s. may i?
all right. so you want to slap.
pull.
observe.
release.
tap.
shoot.
all right. thanks, plebe.
you're welcome, I think.
Baum.
I'm cadet captain martin bedell.
commandant asked me to keep an eye on you.
prep you for o. c.c.
what's this?
it's a merit... for squaring away pyle.
and that's a demerit.
next time you have a problem,
flag down a senior cadet or an instructor.
you run, baum?
I love to run.
you look ate up.
Oh, no. this is great.
Yeah. imagine how it's going
to be with a marine d. i. screaming at you.
like everything's life and death.
I can imagine.
that the new tac?
good ambush point.
in case you're looking for one.
or in case you choose to jog in the woods.
by yourself.
you should be careful.
of that, too.
it's tar. la brea.
it's everywhere.
that stuff smells terrible.
it smells like
jet fuel.
so...
you're out here jogging, in the open,
exposed, with...
bedell.
I've heard a lot about you.
a lot of good, I hope, sir.
lot of good.
so when do I get to call my mom?
when it's safe.
when's that?
soon.
do you do this every night?
Yeah.
well, what happens when you go to sleep?
she happens.
let's find you something to wear for bed.
something in here should fit you.
try these.
this is too small.
how do you know? just try them.
they're for a five year old.
how 'bout this?
uh, that's for playing soccer.
uh, this isn't your stuff. is it?
no. it's not our stuff.
I want to call my mom.
she was supposed to get me a book.
for my book report.
if you call your mother,
that man will use her to find you.
then he'll kill her.
he'll kill you.
uh, cameron.
would you like a bedtime story?
we made a tactical error.
we should have engaged the triple-eight.
with a little boy in the crossfire?
the boy is not important. he is not our mission
he is now.
it's just a meet and greet, sir.
say hi.
ask them how they're holding up.
then company dismissed.
it's easy.
Oh, they're probably going to want
to ask you about o. c.c. prep weekend
we take the juniors through field exercises.
obstacle courses, simulated missions.
running around in the woods, you know?
it'll be fun.
fun.
Hi, I'm lieutenant baum.
I'm your new tac.
so I've been told
that my job is to make sure that you're all doing okay.
well, you all look okay to me.
so, um...
any questions?
all right, then.
sir.
we heard you were in the war.
heard you seen action.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've seen action in the war.
got a lot of kills?
say again?
kills, sir.
I want to go infantry as soon as I get out of here.
maybe rangers. maybe delta.
best of the best.
best of the best.
counting kills.
like it's a game.
like it's just a game.
I remember one particularly fun day.
a guy in my squad
got his stomach blasted open in a fire fight.
he spent six hours holding his own guts in.
his buddy carried him on his back
to the nearest aide station, just praying that someone
could put the dumb son of a bitch together again.
the game, pyle,
the game is played with your buddy's life.
with the life of your squad.
your platoon.
the game is played by you.
on behalf of the whole damn human race.
meet my friend, the e. f.p.
he sits in the middle of the road
and blows up metal.
this is his life's ambition.
I intend to help him achieve it.
we've seeded the street with these things.
we got to make sure that ogre cooperates.
corporal reese will take you
and set up over at lacma and the page.
when the convoy rolls to your position, open fire
on this bunker.
the ogre will think it's metal on skin
and move to assist.
and when it does, boom.
questions?
move out.
they're kids. they key off of you.
I know.
your uncle...
he's an intense guy.
Yeah, I know.
he's a good guy, though.
he's just-- he's a lot to take sometimes.
all that he's been through.
you know...
what are you supposed to say to that?
you mean, how do you measure up?
every man in my family, going back five generations,
has been a general or statesman,
ceo, something amazing,
they all went here.
but you know what the best part
about presidio alto is?
the cross-country course.
you know, sometimes when I'm out there
when I'm all alone,
and I'm going flat-out
everything just, sort of,
falls away.
but sometimes, I wish that...
wish you could just keep on running
and never look back.
I met this girl
over the summer.
her name is alicia.
she's amazing, dude.
she started at dartmouth this year.
she's a runner like me.
she's coming home in a couple of weeks.
when she goes back,
I think I want to go with her...
and never look back.
that's a secret, baum.
you treat it as such.
I always do.
I was just on the roof.
there's flat terrain all around,
but, uh, the woods are a problem.
when the triple-eight comes,
that's where it'll come from.
you're alone and exposed here.
it's not good.
and you're going to tell me I know better.
bedell is quitting.
leaving school.
no, he isn't.
he won't.
well, he is.
he doesn't.
he graduates.
goes to west point.
Why?
because the future already happened
and he's just going through the motions?
he doesn't have a choice?
he's got a choice.
we've just got to help him make the right one.
like everybody does with me.
there are three exits within 20 meters,
two of them lead to a parking lot,
d d the's a black hatchback
three cars in with the doors unlocked
and the keys above the visor.
I do know better.
we're begging you.
be merciful and keep our son safe.
Marty, if you can hear this,
we're going to get you back.
you're dad and I love-- turn that off.
what the hell were you thinking, letting him watch that?
he wanted to see his mother.
you all right?
I told you people.
and I told you I had to get it done by monday.
and it's friday already.
and I haven't even started,
and I'm already in trouble,
and when you don't do it,
the teacher makes you stand up in front of the whole class!
Marty, slow down.
you're hyperventilating.
there.
take a breath.
tell me what this is about.
I told you.
my book report.
book report?
Yeah. it's due by monday.
and I haven't even picked out a book, yet.
don't you listen?
let's find you one.
there's got to be something for you somewhere.
it was john's favorite.
who's john?
the machine won't stop.
he'll go back to that kid's house,
find his parents, find his mom.
I would.
the police'll be there by now.
police won't matter.
I know.
you don't need to be here.
there are other places to be.
you want me to protect his parents?
I want you to keep this contained.
something you need, officer?
good eye.
job requirement.
right.
private sector.
looking into the plant accident.
when carl greenway went nuts?
Yeah. when carl greenway went nuts.
I understand he used to come in here.
they all do. including carl.
sit right where you're sitting.
drink alone.
drink a lot?
tonic water.
like you, I bet.
was he alone like me?
pretty much every night.
I don't know why the guy came in here at all.
still, I do remember some hottie
chatting him up at the bar the night before
everything went down at the power plant.
probably one of sandy's friends.
Sandra runs h. r. at the plant.
her birthday party that night,
I got pictures.
may i?
find who you're looking for?
actually, quite the opposite.
these going to kill it?
no, a speed bump. that's all.
now, this...
Raufoss.
mark 211 round.
tungsten core, armor piercing.
high explosive incendiary.
hits with the force of a 20 millimeter cannon.
saw your dad take down an h-k with one of those.
he liked it better than his plasma rifle.
so this is going to kill it.
it'll make it stop.
reconsider its life choices.
that soldier...
the one you talked about in your story.
my dad carried him to that aid station,
didn't he?
Yeah.
he spent a whole night in the bunker,
trying to get the blood out of his fatigues.
you know what's funny?
I saw a deer the other day.
it made me think of him.
we were together the last time I saw one.
before judgment day?
no. after.
we were up in griffith park, hunting for food.
it was a big bastard too.
your dad had never seen one before.
I mean, not like that.
after I killed it and we got close...
your dad started crying.
you know, more than I'd ever heard
or seen him.
I didn't know how to make him stop.
I buried the deer.
we went hungry.
he was just a boy.
so were you.
Yep.
I guess I was.
you see how the metal is twisted?
you can have the steelers' entire offensive line
Tuggin' on that valve
and not generate enough force to do that.
so you agree it was a machine,
as I thought.
two machines.
one machine ripped the valve open,
and I'm guessing
the other closed it.
and I'm pretty sure there was a fight between them.
two machines.
this is new.
where did they come from?
why did they fight?
um, I wish I knew.
I wish any of this made sense.
I do know I'm not the only one asking questions.
the plant manager, nelson.
he wants the nrc to investigate.
it'll be a nightmare.
that will complicate our respective goals,
won't it, james?
what would those respective goals be?
I'd like my company
to lead the world into the next century.
and I'm fairly sure
you're an avenging angel.
so let's keep looking.
before the nightmare begins.
last one.
Hey, it's for my heart.
you never heard of the french paradox?
those frogs eat foie gras
and gargle red wine
they live till they're 90.
Yeah, but it's the chemicals
in the grape skins that do it.
well, uh...
Bonjour.
Resvera...something.
I saw it on 60 minutes.
you don't say.
you're so beautiful.
sorry, alicia.
that's never happened before.
don't worry, sweetie.
I bet that never happened before, either.
the fbi has moved marty's parents.
and the triple-eight?
he's made no attempt to acquire them.
so what would you do now?
in your professional robot opinion.
Marty's trail has gone cold.
I'd switch targets to the other martin bedell.
so go to the other martin bedell's house.
wait for the triple-eight.
when it shows up, blow it's head off.
he can put it back on.
Marty likes the crust cut off.
here you go.
my teacher doesn't like us to pick books
that have been made into movies.
she thinks we'll just cheat and watch the movie instead.
you'd be in big trouble if you did.
the movie is pretty different than the book.
Really?
how?
well, the slippers aren't ruby.
they're silver.
and there are two good witches, not one.
and dorothy's not 16,
she's nearer your age.
smart and brave.
if that guy finds me,
he's really going to kill me.
he won't touch you.
I promise.
Baum.
how you holding up?
shouldn't you be digging a tunnel outta here or something?
I'm not just going to skip out on my buddies.
I owe them this much.
not everybody gets to run away, you know.
pick up the pace, baum.
I'm not going to carry you up this hill.
triple-eight has been to that kid's house.
it knows about the school. it has his picture.
how long?
cameron says two, maybe three hours.
she's on her way.
you tolde you'u'throw that kid in a hole.
babysit. nothing complicated.
it won't touch him.
I won't let it.
you better not.
cause if you do,
pray that triple-eight gets to you before I do.
is, uh-- is everything okay?
everything's fine.
look, I'm sorry. I didn't
I didn't mean this.
this was never the plan, ever.
what was the plan?
I don't know.
you can't always have one. not all the time.
sometimes you just do.
and I did.
to you.
well...
you saved my life, right?
so... good plan.
thank you.
I said thank you.
I know. I just...
I haven't heard that in...
I haven't heard that.
you're welcome?
say it.
you're welcome.
now say, "marty...
let me help you with your book report.
I can't call my mom and...
you're not doing anything.
so...
thank you, marty.
you're welcome.
tonight's exercise is a rescue extraction.
meet old fred.
he weighs about 75 pounds,
and needs to be carried from place to place.
this is his life's ambition.
and I intend to help him
forget that! all eyes on me.
seniors...
get your people online.
ten meter spacing. eyes up.
what about the obstacle course?
new exercise.
a guy with a gun is going to come through here.
do not initiate contact.
not even for laughs. are we clear?
you see him, you send a hand signal up the line.
if I see that hand signal before I see our infiltrator,
you win.
exercise over.
and where will you be?
looking for that hand signal.
you're with me.
you too.
those are detonators.
claymore simulators.
here, here, and here.
now you wait for the signal.
you watch for me
to lead the infiltrator past this line.
when he enters the kill zone,
you hit the detonator, simulators go off.
end of story. we go home.
wait, sir.
the last-minute change of mission?
pre-positioned equipment?
claymore simulators?
what?
we're not having fun?
Aw, son of a bitch!
no, no, no, no!
Aw! got to be a little more specific.
straight shot from one of the kids must've.
must've hit one of the f-p's.
it's set them all off, it's a chain reaction.
we're just swinging in the wind.
Where's the ogre?
it's coming to kill us all.
where the hell do you think it is?
where is the tank?
about a block away.
moving towards us.
there's no way we've got enough powder to kill it.
I'm going to lay down some covering fire,
maybe drop a couple endos.
that'll give kyle enough time to get back.
Reese...
we can kill that ogre.
we got one more magic bullet.
we just got to get it out there.
the emerald city was soon left far behind.
as they advanced, "the ground became rougher and hillier.
for there were no farms nor houses "in this country of the west.
before night, "dorothy, and toto, and the lion lay down "upon the grass and fell asleep, "with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch.
now, "the wicked witch had but one eye.
yet she could see everywhere.
she saw dorothy lying asleep,
with her friends all about her.
the wicked witch looked out with her one eye.
she said to the king crow, fly at once to those strangers.
peck out their eyes.
tear them to pieces.'
the wild crows flew in one great flock, "toward dorothy and her companions.
when the little girl saw them coming,
she was afraid.
come here.
but the scarecrow said, "'this is my battle, 'lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.'
look over here!
it's me! connor!
John connor!
the witch got into a terrible rage.
she couldn't understand how all her plans "to destroy the strangers had failed.
there was only one way left
to destroy dorothy and her friends.
want me to read for awhile?
the sky darkened and a low rumbling sound "was heard in the air.
there was a rushing of many wings, "a great chattering and laughing, "and the sun came out of the dark sky "to show the witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys.
go to the strangers and destroy them all,'
said the wicked witch.
but dorothy they did not harm at all.
careful and gently, they lifted dorothy
in their arms and carried her to the witch.
the witch looked into the child's eyes "and saw how simple the soul behind them was, "and that she did not know of her wonderful power.
the witch said to dorothy, "'come with me;
for if you do not, I will make an end of you.'
the little girl grew angry.
you are a wicked creature!' she cried.
in her anger, she picked up a bucket of water "that stood near and dashed it over the witch, "wetting her from head to foot.
the witch gave a cry of fear.
as dorothy looked in wonder, "the witch began to shrink away.
see what you have done!' the witch screamed.
I shall melt away.'
with these words, she fell "into a melted shapeless ms.
the wicked witch had come to an end.
being at last free to do as she chose, "dorothy ran,
no longer a prisoner in a strange land.
six stops down, there's a pay phone
to call your mom.
you got your money?
if you get into trouble, you call me.
say "book report" and I'll come.
whatever it is, I'll come.
are you a spy?
no, I'm not a spy.
are you a mom?
Yeah, I'm a mom.
you kind of suck at it.
I know. I'm working on it.
let's catch your bus.
so this...
this is what I'm supposed to do?
stay here, graduate, go to west point?
like I don't know the end of the world is coming?
like any of this-- any of it really matters?
it does matter.
it all matters.
you believe that?
I've got to.
I'll see you around, connor.
Yeah. I guess you will.
sometimes I wish
I could just wake up from all this.
like from a dream.
but I can't, can i?
you want to know what happened...
to bedell-- what really happened?
I don't know. do i?
guess it depends on who I'm talking to.
John baum or john connor.
Baum is just a name.
I'll go.
Reese, I run faster than you.
you run like a duck.
you'll never make it.
he's my brother.
you want to save kyle or die trying?
give me the damn e. f.p.
please.
I want to take this one.
run like hell, okay?
bedell, you run like hell.
when this thing goes off, you pop those wagons.
you get those people out.
don't be a hero.
go!
and he ran.
he ran so fast.
fast enough to get to that tank
before it got to kyle's position.
fast enough to blow it sky-high.
we rescued 40 prisoners that day.
one of them was john connor.
martin was always a great runner.
but n one...
no one could outrun a blast like that.
he died, john.
he died for you.
we all die for you.
Marcus.
how are you?
ask me in an hour.
I thought I'd try... one last time.
you should have stayed in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.
by signing this consent form, you'll be donating your body to a noble cause.
you'd...
have a second chance...
through my research to live again.
you know what I did.
my brother and two cops are dead because of me.
I'm not lookin' for a second chance.
but I'm not the only one with a death sentence, am I?
do you think I'm gonna kill your cancer, Serena?
I'm not worried about myself.
I'm worried about the future of the human race.
I'll sell it to you.
for what?
a kiss.
so that's what death tastes like.
you are doing something very noble.
I'm guilty.
just cut me up until there's nothing left.
though I walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death.
I will fear no evil.
for you are with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
do you have any last words?
vanguard, this is Black Hawk Six.
missile in outer Skynet target.
tto 11 seconds, danger close.
Connor is on the ground.
this mission is a quick in-and-out.
command deems the information on those computers should be at the highest priority.
Connor, there's no sign of the machines.
they're gone.
it's way too quiet.
it's almost like they were waiting for us.
what the hell's that smell, man?
you're seeing this?
Olson. Objective located.
there's something else you'd have to see.
get what we came for, Barbaros.
the clock's ticking.
spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.
why didn't we know about this?
sir, I think this is what Command's looking for.
I'm in their source code.
these people are being taken up north to San Francisco.
some sort of R&D project, for a new Terminator.
send it to Command.
it's uploading, I need two minutes.
wait, wait, wait. Go back. Go back!
stop!
T-800. - A new Terminator.
thought you said it would be...
it's worse.
Connor, get your nose out of that.
none of your business.
you're not leading this mission.
alright, let's cut these sorry bastards loose.
come on, let's go!
Guettow, come in.
come in, Guettow.
Connor, get your ass top-side.
remind those men they need to answer me on the radio, even if they're dead.
Connor!
Connor, get those men to respond.
Olson, something's wrong up here.
Top-side, come in!
outbound enemy aircraft, I'm in pursuit.
there are human prisoners aboard there.
get after 'em.
data transfer complete.
Connor, we're joining you, top
Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten. Do you copy? Over.
eagle White to Bravo Ten. Bravo Ten, do you copy? Over.
Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten, do you copy? Over.
here.
Bravo Ten, identify. Over.
Connor!
we'll send units to the extraction point.
how many survivors are outside? Over.
one.
copy.
return to base, sir?
RTB?
negative. Take me to Command.
sir.
command!
Roger, re-routing.
request has been denied.
command doesn't want to give up their position.
radio comms only.
are they down there?
request has been denied, sir.
need to know only. It's straight from the top.
you open up that ramp!
and you tell them...
I need divers for a log-in. Now!
this is crazy.
John Connor, prophesied leader of the Resistance.
soldier, you put every man and woman in this sub in jeopardy with your little frogman stunt.
what the hell are you doing here?
what did we find down there?
you'll be briefed on a need-to-know basis.
well, I need to know, because my men died down in that hole.
what did we find down there?
we found a solution, Connor, that can end this war, once and for all.
we know the machines use short-wave transmitters to communicate.
our intel has located a hidden signal under the primary channel.
it allows for direct control over the machines.
Skynet's a machine, and like all machines, it has an off-switch.
does it work?
will it work? Yes.
have we field-tested it? No.
give it to me. I'll do it.
I'll test it.
Connor and his tech comm unit have a nice record.
alright.
alright.
leave Connor in top-side.
prepare for lock-out.
Connor, we do this right...
the war is over.
we mount our offense in four days.
Connor...
these are the codes for the signal.
good luck.
why four days?
a kill list was intercepted from Skynet.
it says everyone in this room will be dead by week's end.
you are number two on the list.
well, who's number one?
I don't know him. A civilian.
Kyle Reese.
Guettow, come in.
come in, Guettow.
Barnes...
my brother... He didn't make it, did he?
this is tape No. 28 of Sarah Connor to my son, John.
what's most difficult for me is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.
should I tell you about your father?
will it affect your decision to send him back in time to protect me, knowing that he is your father?
and he'll be younger than you, only a teenager, when you meet him.
God. A person could go crazy thinking about this.
but if you don't send Kyle, you can never be and Skynet will win the war.
want to talk about him?
Kyle is out there somewhere alone and Skynet is hunting him.
what about the signal?
what do you think?
if it works, it's incredible. - Yeah.
we have to be careful. - I agree.
but we have to try.
okay.
alright then, start with something small, something we are familiar with.
we should try to capture a Hydrobot, bring it in for testing.
Yeah.
what is it, John?
kill Kyle Reese, reset the future.
no John Connor.
come with me if you want to live.
what is that?
she doesn't talk, but you need to start.
where did you get that jacket?
the other guy didn't need it.
you see that red? It stands for blood.
it's a symbol of the Resistance.
you're obviously not a Resistance fighter, so take it off.
take it off!
you point a gun at someone, you better be ready to pull the trigger.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
what the hell was that thing?
terminator.
T-600.
what day is it? What year?
2018
what happened here?
judgement Day happened.
I gotta get outta here.
you can't go on foot. Machines will cut you down.
you need speed.
I need a car.
look, there's some by Griffith Observatory.
they don't run now. - Take me.
get down!
that was a Hunter Killer.
thanks to you, they know we're here.
what's your name, kid?
Kyle Reese.
come on.
we burnt down the transmitters so it can't talk to any of its pals that it can still recieve.
turn it on!
you got it?
hold it down! Hold it...
turn the signal up.
get me the strap.
holy shit.
can't you believe it.
got it tight.
the signal has to be continuous.
if there's any interruption...
let's rig up a portable shortwave.
I need to test it on something larger in the field.
alright.
destroy this thing.
so where are the cars?
you don't want to go out after dark.
hunter Killers have infrared.
hunt better at night.
we'll all go tomorrow morning.
what is that?
two-day old coyote.
better than three-day old coyote.
grab it. - What?
grab it.
magic.
got it? - Yeah.
Thanks.
does this radio work?
no.
my dad tried to fix it, but...
he could never get it to work.
hold that.
where is everybody?
they're gone.
so why are you still here?
cause we're the Resistance. L. A. branch.
welcome to the headquarters.
resistant to what?
machines. Skynet.
just the two of you?
Yeah.
how come you're not wearing one of these?
cause I haven't earned mine, yet.
I hope he's listening to this.
we've been fighting a long time, and we've all lost so very much, so many loved ones gone.
but you are not alone.
there are pockets of Resistance all around the planet.
we are at the brink...
trust a magic trick?
hold that up.
press the button.
if we had to finally... less than 100 meters.
they pack a lot of firepower.
but the T-600's are heavy and slow. They're primitive design.
who is that?
if you can't outrun them, - I don't know. - then you have one option.
their motor cortex...
is partially exposed to the back of their neck.
a knife to this area will disorientate their tracking device but not for long.
above all, stay alive.
you have no idea how important you are and how important you will become.
the machines are advancing even faster than I told you they would.
I've seen it with my own eyes.
they were inventing new Terminators. New ways of killing us.
Skynet is planning something big.
but the Resistance is planning something bigger.
this is John Connor.
if you're listening to this, you are the Resistance.
John Connor.
we gotta find this guy.
so... You get it working?
almost. - Good.
look, I figure we head east, right?
we go through the desert, then we can connect with the Resistance there.
I'm heading north.
no. No, no, no, no.
the machines control the whole Northern Sector up to San Francisco.
that's Skynet's central.
I have to find someone.
there's a lot that you don't understand about Skynet, okay?
it's just too dangerous for us to go there.
what about the L. A. branch?
come on, man. We need to get out of L. A.
what is that?
something my brother used to listen to.
star, get out.
don't look at me like that, Star.
get out. Get out!
you're leaving? You're gonna leave us?
Ah, I get it.
do you want to know the difference between us and the machines?
we bury our dead.
but no one is coming to bury you.
Aerostat!
it's a scout for the Terminators. - Go! Drive!
they must have heard the music.
keep the steering.
I've never driven before!
hold the wheel.
this thing is pissing me of.
hold on!
if the idea was to stay alive.
I'm driving.
we're seeing a lot of enemy movement in L. A.
any of our people in the area?
no one on the ground. Two A-10s in the air.
williams and Marhadi.
send the birds down.
guide them to a safe area.
Roger, Coward 6-7 in console.
ten miles to bring. Lima-Alpha, 1-2-5-7-9-0-3. Over.
copy that. - Roger, Wild Eagle. Final copy.
Hey, there's someone here.
get down, now!
get down! Now! - Don't move!
drop your weapons. Let's see your hands!
I never thought that you guys
that's it, drop it! - Don't move, man!
what?
is there a problem?
Hey, we saw your Resistant sign.
the old lady put it there, not me.
what do you want?
we're looking for fuel.
the dark season's coming.
we only got enough for ourselves.
you point that gun at somebody, you'd better be ready to pull the trigger.
put your guns down, everyone.
look, we just came to find the Resistance.
that's all.
the Resistance? What a joke.
fighting those machines is impossible.
we keep our heads down, they ignore us.
you keep your heads down and they'll come for you eventually.
we help you and maybe they will.
these people aren't gonna help you.
let's go.
you're not going anywhere.
not until this one gets something to eat.
bring me a basket.
here you go.
come on, help yourself! Eat up.
are you alright, son?
it's our food.
our fuel.
it's not your choice to make!
are you okay? - What?
are you okay?
star, Star!
Damn! You brought them here! You brought them here.
stop, stop! - Come on, wait.
go! Don't get 'em, go!
head for the tunnels! - Truck!
Marcus, Marcus!
we can't just run for it.
run!
shoot it!
go, go, go!
it didn't work.
shit!
hell, yeah!
Moto-Terminators!
shoot that son of a bitch!
Marcus, turn right up here.
hold on!
where is the other one?
get up here!
come on!
star, give me the gun.
I got it.
hang on!
drop the ball! - Uh, alright.
go, let go!
No!
Kyle!
Marcus!
stand back!
Marcus! Marcus!
I got my eyes on two targets.
we've got two bogeys at 270 degrees.
they've never come this deep before.
they're looking for something.
H. K. is down.
we've got an H. K. pushing our six.
come over by. Breaking off.
evasive maneuvers now!
taking fire. I'm hit. Portside damage.
it's got a lock on you. Break off.
eject, Williams, eject!
punching out.
prisoners' transport, headed northwest, bearing 2-8-9 towards San Francisco.
first, test the signal.
and pray it works.
you okay?
get my knife. It's in my left boot.
what's your name?
Blair Williams.
what's yours?
name's Marcus.
you can let me down now, Marcus.
that thing, where'd it go? - The transport?
Skynet.
where the hell are you going?
after it.
hate to break it to you but...
if you've got friends on that thing...
they're good as dead.
the same with you if you keep walking in that direction.
Yeah, well I've been dead a while and I'm getting used to it.
why don't you come with me to my base?
Connor might know a way.
listen, if you've got a problem with the machines, he's definitely the guy you wanna talk to.
how far is your base? - It should be 1 or 2 days hike.
it's that way.
what are you saying? Speak English!
I was telling him...
it is not true, about the machines killing us.
they're gonna kill us. They're gonna kill everyone.
we are in a cattle cart, on our way to the slaughterhouse.
calm down. You're not helping.
the most important thing that we can do right now is stay alive.
in here and in here.
alright? Just stay alive.
over there.
find something that can burn.
we'll be at my base tomorrow.
are you hurt?
I'm fine.
what you got there?
just some antibiotics.
antibiotics are hard to come by these days.
listen, I don't have much, but...
you're welcome to whatever you need.
we've been watching you.
looking for this?
come on, guys. Machines are the enemy.
we're on the same side. - No, no.
see, I've got a couple of friends on my side.
maybe they can carry you home...
when I'm done with you.
you might want a chamber around.
kill me, you ain't gonna win this war.
Oh, God!
I'm a little cold.
relax.
I just want some body heat.
you have a strong heart.
God, I love that sound.
thank you... for saving me back there.
I don't meet a lot of good guys these days.
I'm not a good guy.
you are.
you just don't know it, yet.
do you think people deserve a second chance?
Yeah. I do.
this is it.
Skynet's Valley of Death.
we've never been this deep before.
we've got to be sure this thing works in their territory.
on the bigger machines.
that will bring them in.
H. K. They're coming.
turn it up!
it works, man. The signal works.
it's beautiful.
commander Ashdown. - Connor, tell me it works.
it works.
that is affirmative. The signal works.
good.
the attack commences tomorrow at 0400, worldwide.
your unit will be at the board of a bombing in Skynet Central.
what is the extraction plan for the prisoners?
extraction plan?
there is no extraction plan.
we're gonna level the place.
negative. I told you.
Skynet Central is filled with human prisoners.
this is war, Connor. Leadership has its cost.
you, above all, should know that.
ashdown, come in.
ashdown, Connor.
ashdown, Con... Damn him!
star! Get back! Get back!
you have to calm down, now.
careful.
Blair.
what?
this is us. The mines are magnetic.
if we head due west at this point of entry, we're good.
I'll go first.
let's go, Marcus. I'm starving.
for you are with me, your rod and your staff, - they comfort me. - Father.
this is the beginning of something wonderful.
the son of a bitch is heavy. - What do we've got here?
he stepped on a landmine.
start a large four IV.
keep it open.
I'm okay. - Patient needs more morphine.
what's his name? - Marcus.
he's got a prosthetic limb?
what?
okay, pulse is good.
let's see what we've got here.
Barnes...
the Devil's hands have been busy.
what is it? - It's real flesh and blood.
though it seems to heal his off quickly.
the heart is human, and very powerful.
the brain too, but with a chip interface.
what have you done to me? - It has a hybrid nervous system.
one human cortex.
one machine. - What the hell would have they done?
who built you?
my name is Marcus Wright.
you think you're human?
I am human.
No!
No! God!
where were you manufactured?
I was born...
august 22nd, 1975.
I know you.
I heard your voice on the radio.
you're John Connor. - Of course you know me.
you were sent here to kill me.
kill the leadership.
I don't know what you're talking about.
then why are you here?
Blair said you could help me find who I'm looking for.
now let me down.
if I let you down...
you'll kill everyone in this room.
just you, Connor.
cause I ain't give a shit about you.
I didn't even know your name until two days ago.
no.
you and me...
we've been at war since before either of us even existed.
you tried killing my mother, Sarah Connor.
you killed my father, Kyle Reese.
you will not kill me.
Kyle Reese is on a transporter, heading for Skynet.
if I wanted to kill him,
I would have done him in L. A.
where did you find that thing?
you sent Marhadi and me to provide cover for some civilians.
he was one of them.
was there a teenage boy?
I honestly don't know.
they were taking them to a transport.
he was the only one left. - Not he, Blair. It.
it was the only one left. Don't be naive.
it saved my life.
Kate, what's gonna happen to him?
disassembled.
you mean killed.
it may have information on Skynet.
I know he's not the enemy.
I've been shot at by the enemy.
that's not him.
that machine saved you only to gain access to kill all of us.
we're gonna be okay. Don't worry.
for my brother.
Connor wants to see you.
what for?
like he's going to tell me, Barnes.
let me see that.
you want me to tell Connor you're not coming?
no.
watch him.
I told you everything I know, John.
Skynet is ruthless and unpredictable.
they will use the best part of you against yourself, and they will have methods I can't imagine or predict.
that I can't help you with.
and when you're unsure, well just always follow your heart, John.
I love you. Goodbye.
there's nothing on the tapes about machines with organs.
that thing in there...
I thought I knew our enemy.
but that thing...
that makes me feel like I know nothing.
I looked in its eyes, and it believes, absolutely believes, that it is human.
it believes everything that it says, and it is telling me that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.
if that is true...
the Command is about to bomb my father and the rest of those prisoners and I cannot stop them.
thank you.
come in!
what's up? Blair said you needed me.
get in.
kill them.
Barnes. What about Blair?
she made her choice.
get down!
let's move.
put a light out there.
we're back in the minefield.
I have a plan.
come on, just hurry up!
let's run!
let's run. Move, move!
Blair, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay!
get your team back! - There they are!
run! God!
now what?
m-my plan stopped at the jeep.
do you have the shot?
I'll draw the fire. You take out the light.
I got the target!
behind the wall. - Don't move. Do not move!
down!
keep your head down!
keep your head down! Go, go, go, go!
move it, move it. - Go!
come on! Come on!
you alright? - Let's get you out of here.
there they are!
on the ground! Stay on the ground!
coming straight down. I'm going in.
do not move! - Keep your eye on them.
who's there?
alligator, this is Cockpit 5-1, we have eyes on the machine.
take my gun!
check the river.
you see him?
move!
God!
I'm going down!
fall!
give me your hand! Give me your hand!
I know what you are, even if you don't.
enough!
that gun ain't gonna stop shit.
nobody shot you in the heart, and I see that thing beating a mile a minute.
Kyle Reese...
he's in Skynet. You do that, he's dead.
I can get you in.
how?
look at me.
that's why I don't trust you.
I'm your only hope you have.
I need to find who did this to me.
so do you.
make your choice.
you get me in.
you tell me where I can find Kyle Reese.
yeah? - I will.
contact me on that.
let me know he's still alive.
what are you?
I don't know.
Hey, he's over here.
you alright?
any sign of him?
he's gone.
why did you do it?
I saw a man, not a machine.
how's your leg?
I'll live.
let me go!
Connor.
command for you.
this is Connor.
Connor, are your men ready?
negative. Nobody is ready.
we are not, you are not.
we must abort the attack. The game has changed.
what are you talking about?
all our elements are past the release point.
they are in assault position.
then delay the attack. At least, delay the attack.
I have a chance to infiltrate Skynet and rescue those prisoners.
give me that opportunity.
no, absolutely not.
this is not the time for a rescue mission.
what you ask for, will undermine the whole operation.
Skynet has Kyle Reese.
and that is his fate.
no, it's our fate.
I have to save him. He is the key.
the key to the future, to the past.
without him, we lose everything.
No! You stay the course!
if we stay the course, we are dead!
we are all dead!
as of this moment, soldier, you are relieved of your command.
you are no longer a part of this Resistance.
I didn't catch that last statement.
neither did I.
this is John Connor.
if you're listening to this, you are the Resistance.
listen carefully.
if we attack tonight, our humanity is lost.
command wants us to fight like machines, they want us to make cold, calculated decisions.
but we are not machines.
and if we behave like them, then what is the point... in winning?
command is going to ask you to attack Skynet.
I am asking you not to.
if even one bomb drops on Skynet before sunrise, our future will be lost.
so, please. Stand down.
give me the time to protect our future, that all of us, are fighting for.
this is John Connor.
what should I tell your men when they find out you're gone?
I'll be back.
I'm coming for you.
come on, Marcus.
okay.
signal broadcasted with full thrift, sir.
good.
commence bombing of Skynet.
we have a green light for the attack.
this is Bakersfield.
that's a no-go on your last. Out.
Eugene, Standing down.
this is Reno. Negative on your last.
Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield, they're all standing down.
they will not attack. Unless Connor gives the order.
Kyle Reese?
No! Get to your transport!
go!
is Kyle Reese here?
welcome home, Marcus. We knew you'd be back.
after all, it was programmed in you.
Oh, and you executed that programming beautifully.
what am I?
you are an infiltration prototype, the only one of your kind.
we resurrected you.
advanced Cyberdyne's work... amended it.
you're dead.
calculations confirmed the Serena code on this face is the easiest for you to process.
it can be others if you wish.
Marcus...
what else could you be... if not machine?
a man.
the human condition no longer applies to you.
accept what you already know...
that you were made to serve a purpose.
to achieve what no another machine has achieved before.
to infiltrate, find a target, and then bring that target back home to us.
we've been at war since before either of us even existed.
you tried killing my mother, Sarah Connor.
you get me in.
you tell me where I can find Kyle Reese.
yeah? - I will.
Kyle Reese! Kyle Reese!
move! Move!
Kyle Reese!
get to your transport.
Kyle Reese!
you, move!
in times of desperation, people will believe what they want to believe.
and so, we gave them what they wanted to believe.
a trick, in the form of a signal, the Resistance thought would win the war.
and they were right, it will end this war.
except that it is the Resistance that will be terminated, not Skynet.
get the attack to Skynet Central back online.
I want our aircraft in the sky, immediately!
sir, sir, we got a bogey with a very large radar signature closing in on our position.
Losenko.
we have destroyed ourselves.
Skynet tracked our signal.
we led them straight to us.
our best machines have failed time and again to complete the mission.
something was missing.
we had to think, radically.
and so we made you.
we created the perfect infiltration machine.
you, Marcus.
you did what Skynet has failed to do for so many years.
you killed John Connor.
Kyle!
don't fight, Marcus.
remember what you are.
I know what I am.
I'm better this way.
you will not be given a second chance.
you cannot save John Connor.
watch me.
we got a message from Connor.
he's in Skynet. Needs air support.
let's go! Scramble the aircraft.
star! Star, go!
star! Star!
star! Come on! Come on!
come on. Come on.
what's your name?
Kyle Reese.
stay with me.
back!
get back!
come on, Star, move!
move!
there's so many of them.
be careful!
what are these? - Fuel cells.
life source for the T-800.
nuclear.
enough to level this place.
cover us.
get ready.
run!
star, come on! Let's go!
come here!
come on! - Come on!
we got to get to the transport!
where are you going?
I gotta end this. - No, no!
I'm not gonna leave you!
you didn't. - Who are you?
John Connor!
hang back now!
Hey, John Connor's in there.
where?
he's still in there.
what?
John Connor's in there.
come with me!
Connor!
I need help!
help!
Connor, it's Kyle! Help!
do it! You son of a bitch!
come on!
come on!
come on!
let's get out of here.
John...
we can't make it back to base.
center's down and they never stay slow.
medevac, urgent.
severe trauma.
call the surgical team.
it's Connor.
how long?
his heart...
can't take it.
he's going to be okay.
he's going to be okay, Kate.
Kyle?
take it...
you earned it.
Kate...
take mine.
Marcus?
everybody deserves a second chance.
this is mine.
what is it that makes us human?
it's not something you can program.
you can't put it into a chip.
it's the strength of the human heart.
the difference between us and machines.
there is a storm on the horizon.
a time of hardship and pain.
this battle has been won, but the war against the machines rages on.
Skynet's global network remains strong.
but we will not quit, until all of it is destroyed.
this is John Connor.
there is no fate, but what we make.

early in the 21st century, skynet, a military deferminators.
became self-aware.
viewing humanity as a threat to its existence,
Skynet decided to strike first.
the survivors of the nuclear fire called the event judgement day
they lived only to face a new nightmare...
the war against the machines.
to hunt down and eradicate humans,
Skynet built terminators.
as the war rages on, leaders of the human resistance
some believe one man holds the key to salvation.
others believe he is a false prophet.
his name is john connor.

Connor is on the ground.
this mission is a quick in-and-out.
command teams the information on those computers
should be at the highest priority.
Connor, there's no sign of the machines.
they're gone.
we too quiet.
it's almost like they were waiting for us.
what the hell's that smell, man?
Whoa! you're seeing this?
Olson, objective located.
there's something else you'd have to see.
we got what we came for, Barbaros.
the clock's ticking.
spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.
why didn't we know about this?

sir, I think this is what command's looking for.
I'm in their source code.
these people are being taken up north to san francisco.
some sort of r&d project, for a new terminator.

it's worse.
Connor, get your nose out of that.
none of your business.
you're not leading this mission.
alright, let's cut these sorry bastards loose.
come on, let's go!
Kirk, come in. - What's that?
come in, guettow.
Connor, get your ass top-side.
remind those men they need to answer me on the radio,
even if they're dead.
Connor, get those men to respond.

resistance command headquarters
John connor, prophesied leader of the resistance.
soldier, you put every man and woman in this sub
in jeopardy with your little frogman stunt.
what the hell are you doing here?
what did we find down there?
you'll be pleased down the need-to-know basis.
well, I need to know, because my men died
down in that hole.
what did we find down there?
we found the solution, connor,
that can end this war, once and for all.
we know the machines use short-wave transmitters To communicate.
our intel has located a hidden signal Under the primary channel.
it allows for direct control on the machines.
Skynet's a machine, and like all machines,
it has an off-switch.
does it work?
will it work? yes.
have we field-tested it? No.
give it to me. i'll do it.
I'll test it.
Connor, you can stay comm unit.
have a nice one record.
alright.
leave connor in top-side.
prepare for lock-out.
Connor, we do this right...
the war is over.
remind our offensive in 4 days.
these are the codes for the signal.
good luck.
why four days?
a kill list was intercepted from skynet.
it says everyone in this room will be dead by week's end.
you are number two on the list.
well, who's number one?
I don't know. a civilian.
my brother... he didn't make it, did he?
this is tape number 28.
it's sarah connor to my son, john.
what's most difficult for me
is trying to decide what to tell you
and what not to.
should i tell you about your father?
will it affect your decision
to send him back in time to protect me,
knowing that he is your father?
and he'll be younger than you,
only a teenager, when you meet him.
Kyle. person could go crazy thinking about this.
but if you don't send kyle,
you can never be and skynet will win the war.
want to talk about it?
Skynet transmission de-activated
Kyle is out there somewhere alone
and skynet is hunting him.
what about the signal?
what do you think?
Skynet transmission initiate shutdown
if it works, it's incredible.
Yeah.
we have to be careful. - I agree.
but we have to try.
okay.
alright then, start with something small,
something more familiar with.
we should try to capture a hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.
Yeah.
what is it, john?
kill kyle reese, reset the future.
no john connor.
red clown toy company, inc.
Hey!
come with me if you want to live.
what is that?!
she doesn't talk, but you need to start.
where did you get that jacket?
the other guy didn't need it.
you see that red? it stands for blood.
it's a symbol of the resistance.
you're obviously not a resistance fighter,
so take it off.
take it off!
you point a gun at someone,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
what the hell was that thing?
a terminator.
what day is it? what year?
what happened here?
judgement day happened.
I gotta get outta here.
you can't go on foot. machines will cut you down.
you need speed.
I need a car.
look, there's some by griffith observatory.
I don't know now. - Take me.
get down!
that was a hunter killer.
thanks to you, they know we're here.
what's your name, kid?
come on.
we burn down the transmitters so it can't talk to any other with powers
that it can still recieve.
turn it on!
you got it?
hold it down! hold a bit...
turn the signal up.
get me a strap.
holy shit.
just hold it tight.
the signal has to be continuous.
if there's any interruption...
Skynet uplink
let's rig up a portable shortwave.
I need to test it on something larger in the field.
alright.
destroy this thing.
so where are the cars?
you don't want to go out after dark.
hunter killers have infrared.
hunt better at night.
we'll all go tomorrow morning.
what is that?
two-day old of coyote.
better than three-day old coyote.
Hey, hey!
grab it. - What?
grab it.
magic.
got it? - Yeah.
Thanks.
does this radio work?
no.
my dad tried to fix it, but...
he could never get it to work.
hold that.
where is everybody?
they're gone.
so why are you still here?
cause we're the resistance. l. a. branch.
welcome to the headquarters.
resistant to what?
machines. skynet.
just the two of you?
Yeah.
how come you're not wearing one of these?
cause i haven't earned mine, yet.
I hope he's listening to this.
we've been fighting a long time,
and we've all lost so very much,
so many loved ones gone.
but you are not alone.
there are pockets of resistance all around the planet.
we are at the brink...
do a sea magic trick.
hold that up.
press the button.
if we had to finally... less than 100 meters.
we've had a lot of firepower
but the t-600's are heavy,
and slow their primitive design.
who is that?
if you can help or no...
I don't know. - Then you have one option.
their motor cortex...
is partially exposed to the back of their neck.
a knife To this area will disorientate their tracking device
but not for long.
above all, stay alive.
you have no idea...
how important you are
and how important you will become.
the machines are advancing even faster
than i told you they would.
I've seen it with my own eyes.
they were inventing new terminators.
new ways of killing us.
Skynet is planning something big.
but the resistance is planning something bigger.
this is john connor.
if you're listening to this,
you are the resistance.
we gotta find this guy.
so... you get it working?
almost. - Good.
look, i figure we head east, right?
we go through the desert,
then we can connect with the resistance there.
I'm heading north.
no. no, no, no, no.
the machines control the whole northern sector
upto san francisco.
that's skynet's central.
I have to find someone.
there's a lot that you don't understand About skynet, okay?
it's just too dangerous for us to go there.
what about the l. a. branch?
come on, man. we need to get out of l. a.
what is that?
something my brother used to listen to.
star, get out.
don't look at me like that, star.
get out. get out!
you're leaving? you're gonna leave us?
Ah, I get it.
do you want to know the difference between us and machines?
we bury our dead.
but no one is coming to bury you.
air attack!
it's a chopper of a terminator. - Go! drive!
they must have heard the music.
keep the steering.
I've never driven before.
hold the wheel.
this thing is pissing me of.
Kyle reese uploaded
hold on!
the idea was to stay alive.
I'll drive.
we're seeing a lot of enemy movement in l. a.
any of our people in the area?
no one on the ground. two A-10s in the air.

send the birds down.

drop your weapons. let's see your hands!
I never thought witch you get
that's it, drop it! - Move, man!
what?
is there a problem?
Hey, we saw your resistant sign.
the old lady put it there, not me.
what do you want?
we're looking for fuel.
the dark season's coming.
we only got enough for ourselves.
you point that gun at somebody,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.
put your guns down, everyone.
look, we just came to find the resistance.
that's all.
the resistance? What a joke.
fighting those machines is impossible.
we keep our heads down, they ignore us.
you keep your heads down and they'll come for you eventually
we help you and maybe they will.
these people aren't gonna help you.
let's go.
you're not going anywhere.
not until this one gets something to eat.
bring me a basket.
here you go.
come on, help yourself! Eat up.
are you alright, son?
it's our food.
our fuel.
it's not your choice to make!
are you okay? - What?
are you okay?
Damn! you brought them here!
you brought them here.
Hey!
stop, stop! - Come on, wait.
Hey! - Go! go get 'em, go!
head for the tunnels! - Truck!
we can't just run for it.
run!
shoot it!
go, go, go!
it didn't work.
shit!
hell, yeah!
throttle terminators!
shoot that son of a bitch!
Marcus, turn right up here.
hold on!
where is the other one?
get up here!
go! god!
come on!
star, give me the gun.
I got it.
Yeah!
hang on!
drop the ball! - Uh, alright.
go, let go!
No!
stand back!
I got my eyes on two targets.
we've got two bogeys at 270
they've never come this deep before.
they're looking for something.
H. k. is down.
we've got an h. k. porching our six.
come over by. breaking off.
evasive maneuvers now!
taking fire. i'm hit. portside damage.
it's got a lock on you. break off.
eject, williams, eject!
punching out.
there's your transport, headed northwest,
bearing 2-8-9 towards san francisco.
first, test the signal.
and pray it works.
you okay?
get my knife. it's in my left boot.
what's your name?
what's yours?
you can let me down now, marcus.
that thing, where'd it go? - The transport?
Skynet.
where the hell are you going?
after it.
hate to break it to you but...
if you've got friends on that thing...
they're good as dead.
the same with you if you keep walking in that direction.
they've only been dead a while and i am getting used to it.
why don't you come with me to my base?
Connor might know why.
listen, if you've got a problem with the machines,
he's definitely the guy you wanna talk to.
how far is your base? - It should be 1 or 2 days hike.
it's that way.
what are you saying? Speak English!
I was telling him...
it is not true, the part of machines killing us.
they're gonna kill us. they're gonna kill everyone.
we are in a cattle cart,
on our way to the slaughterhouse.
calm down. You're not helping.
the most important thing that we can do right now
is stay alive.
in here and in here.
alright? just stay alive.
over there.
find something that can burn.
we'll be at my base tomorrow.
are you hurt?
I'm fine.
what you got there?
just some antibiotics.
antibiotics are hard to come by these days.
listen, I don't have much, but...
you're welcome to whatever you need.
we've been watching you.
looking for this?
come on, guys.
machines are the enemy.
we're on the same side. - No, no.
see, I've got a couple of friends on my side.
maybe they can carry you home...
when I'm done with you.
you might want a chamber around.
we all ?? damn
kill me, you ain't gonna win this war.
Oh, God!
I'm a little cold.
relax.
I just want some body heat.
you have a strong heart.
God, I love that sound.
thank you...
for saving me back there.
I don't meet a lot of good guys these days.
I'm not a good guy.
you are.
you just don't know it, yet.
do you think people deserve a second chance?
Yeah.
I do.
this is it.
Skynet's Valley of Death.
we've never been this deep before.
we've got to be sure this thing works in their territory.
on the bigger machines.
that will bring them in.
H. K. They're coming.
turn it up!
it works, man. The signal works.
it's beautiful.
commander Ashdown. - Connor, tell me it works.
it works.
that is affirmative. The signal works.
good.
the attack commences tomorrow at 0400, worldwide.
your unit will be at the board of a bombing in Skynet Central.
what is the extraction plan for the prisoners?
extraction plan?
there is no extraction plan.
we're gonna level the place.
negative. I told you.
Skynet Central is filled with human prisoners.
this is war, Connor. Leadership has its cost.
you, above all, should know that.
ashdown, come in.
ashdown, Connor.
ashdown, Con... Damn him!
get back! Get back!
you have to calm down, now.
careful.
what?
this is us. The mines are magnetic.
if we head due west at this point of entry, we're good.
I'll go first.
let's go, Marcus. I'm starving.
for thou art with me, thy rod and my staff, - They comfort me. - Father.
this is the beginning of something wonderful.
the son of a bitch is here. - What do we've got here?
he stepped on a landmine.
start a large four IV.
keep it open.
I'm okay. - Patient needs more morphine.
what's his name? - Marcus.
he's got a prosthetic limb?
what?
okay, pulse is dead.
let's see what we've got here.
the Devil's hands have been busy.
what is it? - It's real flesh and blood.
though it seems to heal his off quickly.
the heart is human, but very powerful.
the brain too, but with a chip interface.
it has a hybrid nervous system.
one human cortex.
one machine. - What the hell would have they done?
who built you?
my name is Marcus Wright.
you think you're human?
I am human.
No!
No! God!
where were you manufactured?
I was born...
august 22nd, 1975.
I know you.
I heard your voice on the radio.
you're John Connor. - Of course you know me.
you were sent here to kill me.
kill the leadership.
I don't know what you're talking about.
then why are you here?
Blair said you could help me find who I'm looking for.
now let me down.
if I let you down...
you'll kill everyone in this room.
just you, Connor.
cause I ain't give a shit about you.
I didn't even know your name until two days ago.
no?
you and me...
we've been at war, since before either of us even existed.
you tried killing my mother, Sarah Connor.
you killed my father, Kyle Reese.
you will not kill me.
Kyle Reese is on a transporter, heading for Skynet.
if I wanted to kill him,
I would have done him in L. A.
where did you find that thing?
you sent Mariah and me to provide cover for some civilians.
he was one of them.
was there a teenage boy?
I honestly don't know.
they were taking him to a transport.
he was the only one left. - Not he, Blair. It.
it was the only one left. Don't be naive.
it saved my life.
Kate, what's gonna happen to him?
disassembled.
you mean killed.
it may have information on Skynet.
I know he's not the enemy.
I've been shot at by the enemy.
that's not him.
that machine saved you only to gain access to kill all of us.
Kyle Reese Identified
we're gonna be okay. Don't worry.
for my brother.
No!
Connor wants to see you.
what for?
like he's going to tell me, Barnes.
let me see that.
you want me to tell Connor you're not coming?
no.
watch him.
I told you everything I know, John.
Skynet is ruthless and unpredictable.
they will use the best part of you against yourself, and they will have methods I can't imagine or predict.
that I can't help you with.
and when you're unsure, which just always follow your heart, John.
I love you. Goodbye.
there's nothing on the tapes about machines with organs.
that thing in there...
I thought I knew our enemy.
but that thing...
that makes me feel like I know nothing.
I looked in its eyes, and it believes, absolutely believes, that it is human.
it believes everything that it says, and it is telling me that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.
if that is true...
the Command is about to bomb my father and the rest of those prisoners and I cannot stop them.
thank you.
come in!
what's up? Blair says you needed me.
get in.
kill them.
Barnes. What about Blair?
she made her choice.
get down!
let's move.
english Subtitle by V e R d i K T - Put a light out there. - We're back in the minefield.
I have a plan.
come on, just hurry up!
let's run!
let's run. Move, move!
Blair, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay!
get your team back! - There they are!
run! God!
now what?
m-my plan stopped at the jeep.
okay.
do you have the shot?
I'll draw the fire. You take out the light.
I got the target!
behind the wall. - Don't move. Do not move!
down!
keep your head down!
keep your head down! Go, go, go, go!
move it, move it. - Go!
come on! Come on!
you alright? - Let's get you out of here.
there they are!
on the ground! Stay on the ground!
47?
coming straight down. I'm going in.
do not move! - Keep your eye on them.
who's there?
alligator, this is Cockpit 5-1, we have eyes on the machine.
contact
take my gun!
check the river.
you see him?
move!
God!
I'm going down!
fall!
give me your hand! Give me your hand!
I know what you are, even if you don't.
enough!
that gun ain't gonna stop shit.
nobody shot you in the heart, and I see that thing beating a mile a minute.
he's in Skynet. You do that, he's dead.
I can get you in.
how?
look at me.
that's why I don't trust you.
I'm your only hope you have.
I need to find who did this to me.
so do you.
make your choice.
you can be in...
you tell me where I can find Kyle Reese.
yeah? - I will.
contact me on that.
let me know he's still alive.
what are you?
I don't know.
Hey, he's over here.
where is he heading?
you alright?
any sign of him?
he's gone.
What'd you do?
I saw a man, not a machine.
how's your leg?
I'll live.
let me go!
command for you.
this is Connor.
Connor, are your men ready?
negative. Nobody is ready.
we are not, you are not.
we must abort the attack. The game has changed.
what are you talking about?
all our elements are past the release point.
they are in assault position.
then delay the attack. At least, delay the attack.
I have a chance to infiltrate Skynet and rescue those prisoners.
give me that opportunity.
no, absolutely not.
this is not the time for a rescue mission.
what you ask for, will undermine the whole operation.
Skynet has Kyle Reese.
and that is his fate.
no, it's our fate.
I have to save him. He is the key.
the key to the future, to the past.
without him, we lose everything.
No! You stay the course!
if we stay the course, we are dead!
we are all dead!
as of this moment, soldier, you are relieved to your command.
you are no longer a part of this Resistance.
I didn't catch that last statement.
neither did I.
this is John Connor.
if you're listening to this, you are the Resistance.
listen carefully.
if we attack tonight, our humanity is lost.
command wants us to fight like machines, they want us to make cold, calculated decisions.
but we are not machines.
and if we behave like them, then what is the point...
in winning?
command is going to ask you to attack Skynet.
I am asking you not to.
if even one bomb drops on Skynet before sunrise, our future will be lost.
so, please. Stand down.
give me the time to protect our future, that all of us, are fighting for.
this is John Connor.
what should I tell your men when they find out you're gone?
I'll be back.

welcome home, Marcus. We knew you'd be back.
after all, it was programmed in you.
Oh, and you executed that programming beautifully.

you are an infiltration prototype.

we resurrected you.

that you were made to serve a purpose.
to achieve what no another machine has achieved before.
to infiltrate, find a target, and then bring that target back home to us.

you kill me...
you tell me where I can find Kyle Reese.
Yeah, I will.

in times of desperation, people will believe what they want to believe.

sir, sir, we got a bogey with a very large radar signature closing in on our position.
the signal?

we have destroyed ourselves.
Skynet tracked our signal.
we led them straight to us.
our best machines have failed, time and again, to complete the mission.
something was missing.
we had to think, radically.
and so we made you.
we created the perfect infiltration machine.
you, Marcus.
you did what Skynet has failed to do for so many years.
you killed John Connor.
Hey!
don't fight, Marcus.
remember what you are.
I know what I am.
I'm better this way.
you will not be given a second chance.
you cannot save John Connor.

he's going to be okay, Kate.
Kyle?

you earned it.
take mine.
everybody deserves a second chance.
this is mine.
what is it that makes us human?
it's not something you can program.
you can't put it into a chip.
it's the strength of the human heart.
the difference between us and machines.
there is a storm on the horizon.
a time of hardship and pain.
this battle has been won, but the war against the machines raises on.
Skynet's global network remains strong.
but we will not quit, until all of it is destroyed.
this is John Connor.
there is no fate, but what we make.
Where's the metal?
who are you?
my name's Winston.
I talked to your mom.
she found something out in the desert.
it sounds like it has something to do with those three dots
she's been after.
is it real this time?
well, the bullet in her leg sounds real.
you stay. I'll go.
you made your call.
this is what living with it means.
I detected this audio transmission
on an unsecured line.
got a breach.
man shot out at Heat and Air.
well, you know the drill. Shut the place down.
authorities are still trying to determine
the cause of the blast
which killed all 32 employees of the desert canyon heat and air plant earlier this week.
a vigil is scheduled for today
in charm acres-- the high-desert enclave
that served as a company town for the workers and their families.
area schools and many of the town's local businesses
will be closed in observance
native Americans believe that when their pictures are taken,
their souls are stolen
and locked in the photograph forever.
I think you're safe.
God, I hate funerals.
I hate Skynet.
how come this sounded so easy when we were talking about it on the way up here?
and now that I see all these people...
just find somebody to talk to, John.
mom, everybody who knew anything about the factory
is already dead.
well, I'm not.
Yeah, well, I guess you're lucky.
I'd feel luckier if we could find somebody here
who knew what was going on out there.
you'd never guess he had it in him.
no.
I see it.
that seat taken?
are you gonna say annoying things?
annoying things?
I can't believe it's happening.
it comes in waves." "I just feel numb.
no, I will, uh, try not to say those things.
I'm John.
Zoe.
Yeah.
so you know somebody in charm acres, John?
or are you just a sucker for a small-town, homey vigil?
my mom, uh, worked at the factory.
so she, uh...
you know, came to pay her respects.
so you got dragged along.
little drag, also some push.
it seemed like the right thing to do.
a stupid thing to do, if you had a choice.
did you have a choice?
funeral crasher.
stupid funeral crasher.
am I crazy,
or is that girl creepily staring at us?
that would be my sister.
I don't like that.
uh, no, no reason to.
that's my mom.
my dad worked at the factory.
sorry.
I picked out a suit this morning,
you know, to bury him in.
I picked out a gray one, even though Henry said
I should've picked out a black one.
he looked better in gray, though.
speak of the Henry Devil.
we're about to do the candle lighting.
Hi, I'm John.
is that your boyfriend?
you know, he keeps applying for the job.
I'm just not hiring.
it was nice to meet you...
John.
do not stand at my grave and weep.
I am not there.
I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glint on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
when you awake in the morning's hush...
I am the swift uplifting rush
of quiet birds in circled flight.
do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there.
I did not die.
excuse me.
he hated having his picture taken.
you wouldn't know it by looking at him there,
but he did.
excuse me, I'll leave
no, no, no. it's--it's okay.
it's actually refreshing to see an unfamiliar face.
everybody here--all I see are the people that they've lost.
all I see is what's missing.
I'm Sarah.
Diana Winston.
so did you know my husband, Sarah?
gene used to project old movies on his garage door.
every Saturday night during the summer,
there'd be couples out in the driveway
with their beers and popcorn...
watching "Casablanca" or "Out of the Past
or "His Girl Friday."
I just went for the free beer.
I've been to a lot of places for that.
I can't remember...
the last movie that Ed and I saw together...
or when.
I used to just leave his dinner in the fridge
for whenever he came home.
it wasn't the easiest place to work.
I was only there for a few months,
but long enough to figure that out.
I can't tell you how many times I wanted to...
make a call or write a letter to those people
and ask them what kind of security they had Ed doing
that kept him out of the house seven days a week.
but you never do that.
no one does that.
not here.
Yes, ma'am.
do you have him, Mr. Walsh?
no, ma'am.
he's proven a...
bit harder to locate than I had anticipated.
you assured me it'd be a very simple job.
I know, ma'am.
everyone I've spoken to thinks that he's dead,
died in the explosion at the factory.
I can tell you he isn't.
he didn't.
I've got a good lead on him, ma'am.
I hope so, Mr. Walsh.
I must've missed the memo about wearing plaid today.
Oh, yeah.
don't worry. It's not a company policy.
it's just something a few of us do.
paying homage, you know?
to whom?
Weaver, Lachlan Weaver.
today's the anniversary of his death.
did you know him?
Yeah, he was...
he was a great guy.
you know, he's a genius, funny as hell.
they both were, you know,
back then.
good morning, Mr. Ellison.
Mr. Murch.
ms. Weaver.
beautiful day, isn't it?
I'm going to say a few words about my friend Gene Miller.
but before I do, I want to take this opportunity
to thank everyone at Desert Heat and Air's parent company the Kaliba group,
for their generous donations to this service,
and not just for the beautiful flowers
you see around our chapel,
but also for the generosity and kindness they've extended
to the families in this very difficult time.
is this all it costs to buy us?
flowers and a few kind words?
Where's anybody from the company?
have any of you seen anybody from the company?
has anybody ever seen anybody from the company?
no.
you have not.
Diana. -Stop.
let us pray.
let us pray.
first six years of our marriage, we lived in nine states.
ed was in the military, so...
when he got the chance to settle down
you know, the nice company car,
the big house, the even bigger salary
I pushed him to take that job.
head of security for Desert Canyon Heat and Air.
come on, what kind of heat and air factory
needs that kind of security?
what did you do there?
me?
coffee and sandwich cart-- waitress on wheels.
I never knew what went on there.
no one does.
ed never said a damn thing about it,
and every time I'd ask, he'd just shut me down,
so I stopped asking.
we all did.
none of this is your fault.
ed was a decent man.
whatever went on there, he was a decent man.
decent people can get caught up in things.
I found these when I was going through Ed's things.
I've never seen them before in my life.
this one goes to a storage locker.
you don't have a storage locker, do you?
no.
I've been meaning to go there, but then I get scared.
so I tell myself some doors are better left unopened.
not this one.
looks like you could use a lift.
what's that? -A lift. You want one?
Oh, yeah, sure. uh... yeah.
great. Thanks.
appreciate it.
condolences.
it's not my funeral, but thanks.
I'm an OSHA investigator.
I'm looking into the explosion.
big change from being a cop.
Yeah.
23 years, Baltimore, 4th precinct, Pikesville.
you a local?
my--my wife worked up at the plant.
she, uh...
she knew a lot of these people.
my condolences.
so what do you think?
about what?
what happened.
I think it's too early to tell.
would you even if you knew?
tell? - Yeah.
no.
you know, people say it wasn't an accident.
is that right?
they say something was going on up there
other than heating and air-conditioning.
something as in what exactly?
that's what I'm asking you.
suppose you knew something was going on out there.
what would you do?
absolutely nothing.
absolutely nothing?
that's what I said.
thanks for the ride.
no problem.
I think I'm--I'm gonna walk the rest of the way.
no problem.
good luck with your investigation.
empty.
empty.
I did not know that man.
I loved him, but I didn't know him.
sometimes that's for the best.
he called me.
ed did, three days ago, for the last time.
he must've dialed by accident.
my name's Winston.
I install air-conditioning, all right?
please don't hurt me.
I have a wife.
what happened to him, Sarah?
I can't die here.
somebody tell me I'm not gonna die here.
you won't die here.
I hate these people.
I don't relate to any of them.
great. Thanks, Zoe.
Hey, what if we just kept driving?
got on the highway and didn't stop
till we hit somewhere amazing?
the grand canyon.
I went there when I was a kid.
my mom and I took mules down into the canyon.
sounds cool.
uh, it would've been if my mule wasn't completely schizo.
he ate my spare shirt.
I've never been.
got a postcard from there once.
okay, seriously,
if you start talking about Mike Thompson,
I'm getting out of the car.
boyfriend?
ex. And he was a good guy...
until he ditched me.
what happened?
he was just like the rest of us.
his mom worked at the plant.
Mike was just a normal, funny guy.
he liked watching his monty python movies
and playing lacrosse.
what happened to him?
apparently, his mom had violated some confidentiality agreement
or something at the plant.
they just...
up and left in the middle of the night.
Mike never said a word about it.
I woke up one morning, and he was just gone.
a few months later
I got a postcard
from the grand canyon.
he was a real prize.
shut up, Henry.
why don't you think
about somebody besides yourself for once, huh?
you're not the only person who's lost someone.
Zoe's not in love with you.
what?
she doesn't love you the way you love her.
get out of the car. - What?
I want them out!
Henry, just go!
go!
are you gonna go?
no.
Hey, what are you-- what are you doing?! get out.
make a right over here.
what the hell is going on?
Shh. Look, I can't deal
with another funeral, Henry, not right now.
Hey, do you want to see something really messed up?
one day you'll be out here,
and they're lying there like that,
dead.
and the next day they're gone.
like Mike.
Yeah, like Mike.
what's killing them?
idiots with guns.
no bullet wounds.
what are you, Dr. Quinn medicine woman?
maybe it's the water.
I think people will pick them up at night
they always did want to be rich.
that's what Henry said.
his mom wanted the good things.
careful what you wish for, huh?
what do you mean?
insurance money
the company's agreed to pay. We're all rich.
what did Henry's father do at the plant anyway?
he went to work in the morning, came home at night,
didn't talk about it.
same as everybody else that worked there.
I don't get it.
what's so secret about heating and air-conditioning?
the secret is, is it wasn't heating and air-conditioning.
what was it?
some kind of government project.
that's what I think.
there's some smart people around here,
real smart.
so you think what
that somebody sabotaged the plant
and killed all these people?
your father?
it wasn't an accident, John.
the guy who shot me is either a serial killer
or a true believer.
his wife thinks he was murdered.
she's right.
but nothing about the, uh, the thing
you think you saw?
the drone or whatever?
I don't think I saw it. I saw it.
who's he?
looking for something.
I figure the best way to find out what it is,
is to let him find it.
he made you.
he'll try and lose you,
but he doesn't know me.
I'll handle it.
you always do.
Skynet's here, Reese. I can feel it.
what?
you called me "Reese" again.
that's what you used to call him, isn't it?
Kyle?
you know, maybe you should try to let him go.
maybe you should.
is Henry gonna be okay?
Henry smokes a lot of weed.
you know, my father died before I was even born.
Yeah, well, my father's a pile of ashes somewhere,
so I guess we're both screwed.
I thought you picked out a gray suit to bury him in.
why am I even talking to you?
you don't know me.
you don't know what I'm going through.
stop trying to make it seem
like you're some kind of sensitivity expert.
you don't know anything.
she's not crying.
she's not doing a lot of things.
Mr. Ellison,
come in.
you've changed your tie.
is that plaid?
Yes, um, I went home at lunch.
I hope you don't mind. I...
I spoke to Mr. Murch, and he spoke of, um...
Lachlan's death.
my sympathies. Yes.
thank you.
I remember when my father died.
he was, um...
he was a tough man. We didn't get along.
even so, it took me a long time
to come to terms with his passing.
I threw myself into work so I wouldn't have to.
was this recent?
recent enough.
then you understand.
I do.
so how's Savannah doing with this?
do?
how is she dealing with her father's death?
Dr. Sherman was very helpful in that regard.
now he's gone, too.
children are nothing if not resilient.
I'm surprised she's not here.
Why?
being the anniversary, I mean.
Yes.
I guess that is surprising.
Dr. Sherman felt it was important for a child to maintain a regular routine.
today's not the day for excitement.
would you excuse me,
Mr. Ellison?
I'm feeling emotional.
Yes.
of course.
Victoria?
ms. Weaver.
find my daughter and bring her to me.
you know, there are times,
and I'd have to say that this is one of them,
where it seems every single logical step we take
leads to the most bizarre place.
you mean crashing that poor guy's wake
and eating his widow's shrimp skewers?
Yeah, Derek, I mean that.
what's the point?
you know what the point is.
your mom thinks that factory was linked to Skynet.
Yeah, and you think she's nuts.
doesn't mean I think she's wrong.
she hasn't looked
at her father's picture since we've been here...
not once.
neither has her mother.
Yeah, and?
if you had a photo of Kyle Reese,
you'd look at it, wouldn't you?
maybe there's something I don't understand.
he's not dead.
that's a big leap.
let me repeat what she said.
if you had a photo of your brother,
