that's okay.
listen, um... can you tell us a little bit about your mom?
how long has she been gone?
I don't know, a few months.
Yeah. Do you have any idea where she went?
Matt told us she's got transferred to a new job in Boston.
so it's just been you, Matt and the little ones for a while?
Yeah.
Matt quit school so he could stay home and watch Andy.
he said that way Kate and I could keep going.
then when we would get home, he'd go to work.
at the messenger service?
sometimes. He had another job too at the locksmiths.
do you know the name of the place?
I... no.
so that's where the new locks on the door came from?
Yeah. Because of what happened.
this sauce tastes funny.
that's because it's funny-tasting food night.
come on, Katie. It's not going to kill you.
saras not eating it.
I have a test. I have to study.
I have to study, too.
what did I tell you about doing this at the table?
what the hell, Ramsey?
move it, kid.
What're you doing here. What's going on
you don't come into my house like that! Get the hell out of here...
back off.
I opened the door for your mom.
that thieving whore stole my stash.
I'm just collecting on a debt.
Where's your wallet?
give me your wallet or the little bitch is next.
this all you got?
you know where my mom is? No. I threw her out on her ass.
you know where she went?
far from this rat hole if she has half a brain.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
so this Ramsey guy, is this your mom's boyfriend?
I don't know.
has he been back since that night?
did you or Matt-- anyone call the police after your mom left?
no.
because if we told anyone, they'd split us up.
Matt said he'd keep us together no matter what.
I have to go check on my little brother. - Okay.
so... who's going to call Social Services?
okay, we canvassed around Matt's apartment and these showed up at a hospital, a shelter and a drug clinic.
shows you where he thought he'd find his mother.
Yeah, well, it's too bad if someone tried to call.
the phone was shut off last month.
look, I spoke to the landlord.
after Matt got the news from Sarah, he called, begged the landlord not to evict them.
let me guess, he didn't get anywhere playing the sympathy card.
not when he was six months behind on the rent.
I got the guy who ransacked their apartment.
his name is Ramsey Gorman.
he and Nadine were busted in a drug stealing last October.
and check this out.
it's not the first time he was caught.
where is he now?
uh, his last known address is in Chelsea on 33rd Street.
let's see if we can find him.
right.
Hey, listen, this one's all yours.
I have a lead on Nadine that I ought check out.
Where's Martin?
not my day to watch him.
Mr. Gold, we tracked the die stamp imprinted on those locks and they brought us he.
Yeah. I gave them to Matt.
you gave Matt over $500 worth of merchandise?
that's retail.
it was a bonus for being a good apprentice.
when was the last time you saw him?
Why? Is Matt in some sort of trouble?
is he the type to get into trouble?
well, I didn't think so, but lately he hasn't exactly been his reliable self.
he shows up late.
he doesn't show up at all.
sometimes he shows up out of the blue.
Mr. Gold.
I didn't expect you to be here so late.
neither did I, but I've got this stack of invoices back there that disagree.
is everything all right?
Yeah, Mr. Gold, everything's fine.
uh, my buddy here just got locked out and I kind of wanted to help him out.
if you don't mind.
no, kid, of course I don't mind.
I'm such a klutz.
it's good to know somebody in the business though, huh?
Hey, that's what friends are for.
I, uh... I think I got it, Mr. Gold. Thank you.
and away we go.
thanks again, Pops.
listen, ladies, Matt is a good kid.
but that friend of his
he looked like he just walked out of jail.
okay, is this the guy?
Yeah, that's him.
Mr. Gold, we're going to need to dust for this guy's prints.
now which one of these lock sets was he holding?
uh, I'm pretty sure it was that one.
okay, we're also going to need a list of your customers past and present.
we think maybe him and this guy were planning some burglaries to be able to pay the rent.
8: 45PM l DAD, get's lockpicks with camaro man
the neighbor says Ramsey usually rolls in around this time stinking of nightclubs and crackheads.
I think today it's Dumpsters and alley trash.
Hey, Ramsey Gorman, FBI!
Hey, hey, okay, we're going.
get over here!
put your hands where we can see them. - Take it easy, man!
you got any needles on you, huh?
cause I sure as hell don't want to get stuck.
no, I ain't no junkie, man.
we're looking for Matt Jameson. Do you know where he is?
I don't know who he is.
he must have killed off too many brain cells smoking his own stuff.
you planted that.
Oh, yeah? Where do you want me to plant this?
huh? Where do you want me to plant this?
that's for protection.
protection? From who?
the 15-year-old kid whose apartment you ransacked?
or his mom who you got strung out on drugs?
is that what this is about?
I ain't seen the kid since that night at his place.
I ain't seen Nadine in even longer.
if you don't believe me, I don't care.
you know what I think?
I think Matt came looking for you with questions about his mom that you didn't want to answer.
were you not listening?
Hey! Where is he?!
where is he?!
I am not going to ask you again! - No! No!
let me handle this.
let me handle this. - Fine. Deal with the son of a bitch.
so what have you got? - Got Casey Miller.
matches prints from the locksmith's shop.
it turns out that he and Matt go all the way back to foster care.
and they kept in touch? - Enough to visit Miller in prison.
he got out of jail six months ago.
four years for a string of B&Es.
pretty tempting partner for a young man like Matt who needs money.
got an APB on Miller's Camaro.
maybe they're still on the move together.
hold on.
Yeah. Yeah, this is Johnson.
Really?
when?
well, is she going to be okay?
all right, thank you.
one of the locksmith's customers was shot and left for dead last night.
witness saw too young white males leaving the scene
victim's name is Allison Ashford.
she's being treated at Mt. Sinai for a gunshot wound.
she talking
Yeah. And she ID. Casey Miller breaking into her place.
now an agent is watching his apartment in the Bronx.
that's the last place they're gonna be.
my guess is that they're probably on the move by now.
Yeah. Miller's ATM showed at a gas station in Staten Island three hours after the shooting.
the security camera confirms that Matt was with him.
Jack, we found Matt's mom at a shelter near Chelsea.
let's bring her in.
Thanks, Steve.
miss Jameson?
we've been looking for you.
we're not the only ones, though.
your children have been wondering where you've been, too.
kids? I don't know what you're talking about.
are you sure about that?
so I take it that this isn't you.
or this or this, or any of these.
look, don't waste my time.
you do have children, four of them in fact and the eldest one, Matt, is in serious trouble.
he's been missing for over two days and he's a suspect in an attempted murder.
what do you want from me?
I need for you to put yourself together and help me find your son.
I haven't seen my son since the day I left.
what's going on?
baby, hey.
you get the early shift again?
Oh, uh, no
where you going?
out.
for how long?
I don't know.
I got to go, okay?
why, Ma?
I can't stay here now. I'll be back later, okay?
you're using again.
no, baby, no.
then why do you have to leave?!
keep your voice down. You're going to wake up the kids.
like you care?
who's supposed to take care of them, Mom, me?
look, I cannot have this conversation with you right now.
who, Ma, huh?
you're so smart. You figure it out.
when Gary died, I just couldn't keep it together anymore.
and I tried to stop using.
I, uh, I went to clinics and rehab more than once.
so, what, you want a prize?
I told you I couldn't do anything for those kids.
those kids are your kids.
do you know somebody by the name of Casey Miller?
he was a friend of Matt's.
all right. Any idea why they'd be in Staten Island?
my older sister Margaret lives out there, or she did. I don't know anymore.
a few years back, she tried to get custody of the kids but it didn't work out.
let me guess. The court sided with the mother.
Yeah, that's right.
are you aware that he's posted flyers with your photo on them all over the neighborhood?
what, I'm supposed to feel guilty?
that would be a start.
look, I...I never was much of a mother.
okay?
maybe I just didn't have what it takes to raise kids.
but you honestly thought that your 15-year-old son did?
any calls on our Staten Island Camaro?
not yet.
well, I ran all the locksmith addresses.
none of them are on the island.
I think our boy Matt may be looking for a new target.
Yeah, well, this might be it.
check this out, Margaret Jameson, Nadine Jameson's sister.
her address is just a couple blocks away from the gas station.
well, good.
somebody's headed out to the island then.
not this somebody.
Where's Martin?
martin flipped out about an hour ago.
seems like he's lost his mind.
then he said he was feeling sick, so I told him to go home.
he's sick again.
what does that mean, sick again?
I'm not getting to get into it.
not getting into what?
if you have questions about Martin, ask Martin.
I must have been at the nursery when you called.
does Margaret Jameson live here?
no, Miss Jameson's my landlady.
I rent the place from her.
have you seen this kid?
Oh, yes.
he came by here this morning.
I almost called the cops on him.
may I help you?
I'm looking for Margaret Jameson.
there's no Margaret here.
she's my aunt. I know she used to live here.
I've been here, like, a hundred times.
well, I've lived here for over five years now and I don't know any Margaret.
and I don't like you and your friend hanging out in front of my house.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
this isn't what it looks like, okay?
I just really need to find my aunt.
we have a family emergency.
look, if I could just get a phone number or an address,
I would really appreciate it.
look, I heard you the first time.
now if you don't leave my property right now
I will call the police.
go ahead.
I do have Miss Jameson's phone number and address, but I was not about to give it to that boy.
not the way he looked.
is it possible for us to have her telephone number?
all right. It's inside. Stay here.
hold on! Geez.
who is it?
what's up?
Hey. Can I come in?
bad time?
I really wasn't expecting company, but, yeah, come on in.
Thanks.
sorry about the mess.
I haven't had time to get to it.
you want something to drink?
sure, I'll have a glass of water.
did Tina quit?
no, she went back to the DR.
her daughter's been sick.
huh.
you feeling any better?
what's that?
feeling any better?
look, sorry about today.
I don't have much tolerance for people like that but it won't happen again, okay?
Thanks.
do you have something you want to tell me?
no.
no?
what are these?
it's a prescription for my hip, okay?
you got hurt over six months ago.
you should be off these...
Yeah, but I also got hurt again and I've been in a lot of pain.
did you take these from her house?
you know what? It's time for you to go.
did you take these from her house?
look, just back off, because this is none of your business.
it is my business if you're stealing drugs from victims' homes!
damn it! Just stop! No!
this is a problem!
what do you want from me?!
I want you to let me help you.
I don't want your help.
I don't need anybody's help, okay?
Martin, please, tell me how to help you.
I don't know, Sam.
I don't know.
well, okay. Thanks.
no Matt on Staten Island.
no Casey Miller.
that's because Miller was found at his ex-girlfriend's place in East Harlem.
NYPD just picked him up.
they found a pile of bloody clothes with him.
and Matt? Louis says that
Matt took off when he was asleep.
with the car?
with the gun.
I told you, man. I don't know where Matt went.
you got Allison Ashford's blood all over you, and Matt's missing.
you do the math.
Oh, come on, man.
Matt's like my little brother.
is that why you roped him into robbery and attempted murder?
he was desperate, all right?
his family was getting kicked out.
he asked me to help.
so you went along, what, because you're a Good Samaritan?
he was going to do it whether I helped him or not.
why did you shoot the old lady?
it was an accident.
drive, man! Drive.
what was that gunshot?
what the hell?
it went bad, Matty. It went bad.
she came back while I was inside.
she surprised the hell out of me.
what, you... you shot her?
okay, she pulled the gun, all right?
I tried to garb it. It just went off!
you said it was going to be easy.
I know what I said, all right?!
what? Is she dead?
I don't know, man.
but I know we got to get the hell out of here, all right?
let's go, man. Drive, drive, drive! Come on!
I tried to tell Matt that it was all on me, but it didn't matter.
we went to his aunt's to try to pick up some cash, but it didn't work out.
and then he said that he knew someone who might have some money.
someone who owed him.
and that's why he took off in your car with the gun?
Yeah.
and who's this person that owes him?
man, if I knew the answer to that, I'd tell you.
because the last thing I want is for something to happen to Matt.
and I got nothing.
hmm. Here's one.
runs a catering service in Morningside Heights.
had the locksmith re-key the entire place last month.
maybe.
I just, um...
I just keep thinking about what he told Casey.
he was going to see somebody who owed him, which sounds personal.
I think I know where he's headed.
we found Casey Miller's Camaro.
it's parked a block away.
engine's still warm.
split up.
I got him in the back alley in the building.
Matt! freeze
I'm Special Agent Vivian Johnson with the FBI.
we've been looking for you.
okay, now take it easy and put that gun down.
what are you going to do if I don't?
Hey, don't do this!
I know where you come from.
I know what you've been through.
I found Nadine.
did you talk to her? - Yeah.
does she have the kids?
no. But they're okay.
we're taking care of them.
I know what happened.
I know it wasn't your fault.
does that mean I get off for that lady getting shot?
I can't guarantee it.
look, you'll be 18 in a couple of years.
you can file for custody yourself.
are you sure of that?
it's a better option than when you're headed to right now.
come on.
you don't have to do this on your own anymore.
trust me.
are you going to stop the car or are you going to hang out until we get a parking ticket?
put the key in the ignition.
you know, I went to see Martin.
good for you.
what is your problem, Danny?
I don't want to talk about Martin.
but you know what he's going through.
Yeah, I do.
and I also know that the first step is to admit that you have a problem and to ask for help.
he did. - He did?
Yes, he did. He's ready, Danny.
and I believe him.
I don't think he can do this on his own.
what are we going to do to help him?
why is helping Martin my responsibility?
you've been through what he's going through.
I haven't. I...
I don't know how to help him.
I-I honestly don't.
you do.
Hey.
how'd it go with the DA?
well, he's a bit tough at first but I'm hoping that he's going to knock it down to juvie instead of hard time.
Oh, that kid deserves a medal.
well, he's not going to get one from Nadine.
she's up on criminal endangerment charges.
well, there is a silver lining.
and we found her sister Margaret.
she's going to push to keep those kids out of foster care, so that's good.
well, let's hope the courts get it right this time.
shouldn't be too hard.
you know, all that kid wanted was to keep his family together.
what you going to do?
we solved the case.
Yeah. But we don't live with the consequences.
see you tomorrow.
night.
go home.
I'll take him down.
hold on.
I used to think, it could never happen to me.
I'm too strong to let it take control of my life.
but they were right.
the first drug is the worst drug.
I spent six years living in gutters.
pissed off everybody who loved me.
I lost every penny I had.
and...
I still couldn't face the fact that I had a problem...
other body measurements line up.
the lungs are almost fully formed.
weight's about seven and half pounds.
so everything's all right?
looking good.
bet you can't wait to get that baby out of you.
please. I was ready a month ago.
could be worse.
elephants stay pregnant 22 months.
I feel like an elephant.
well, you don't look like an elephant, baby.
he always knows the right thing to say.
Hey, hey, hey, no more looking.
he's obsessed with keeping the baby's sex a secret.
no comment.
thank you, doctor.
take care.
you, too, Megan.
thank you.
okay...
we should schedule our checkup for next week.
sorry.
you okay, honey?
Yeah.
it's just hard to believe that there's less than a month to go.
look, about this morning...
no, you were right.
we're so close.
I think I was a little edgy from my medicine.
what time's your flight?
uh, between traffic and security at jfk,
I should probably go now.
go. I'll make the appointment.
are you going to be okay getting home?
I'll be fine. I'll take a cab.
yeah?
Yes.
okay.
I'll call you when I get to the hotel tonight.
okay.
Bye. - Good-bye.
Hey, what do you got?
30's, graphic designer, eight and a half months pregnant.
last seen leaving here yesterday morning.
security found those on the steps outside.
this was filled yesterday.
she having complications with her pregnancy?
no. She's HIV positive.
well, that's a complication.
it is.
she's on a very strict drug regimen.
husband told police that there is no way that she's leave those behind.
so where was he during all this?
business trip to Columbus, Ohio.
he flew back in this morning.
wasn't due back for another day.
that's a little convenient that he was out of town when she went missing.
I just spoke to the hospital administrator.
three weeks ago a lady tried to kidnap an infant.
after that they really had to beef up security at the maternity ward.
I guess if you can't snatch a newborn you go to the next best thing.
I knew something was wrong when I didn't hear back from her.
you called here last night.
who'd you talk to?
uh... nobody.
I left a message on the machine.
Yeah, according to your phone records, the call was about four minutes.
seems a long time for a message.
well, I usually sing the baby a lullaby.
so I left it on the machine and I told meg to play it back to her stomach.
where is it?
I erased it this morning when I got home.
Why?
I don't know.
it's a habit.
I always erase old messages.
Mr. Sullivan, does your wife have any problems with anyone?
any altercations?
well, there was somebody that she talked about in dr. Barnes' office.
made her so upset yesterday, we almost didn't go to the appointment.
made some decaf.
you're not even dressed.
I want to reschedule.
I just...
I can't deal today.
deal with what?
I just...
I feel like a pariah every time I walk into that office.
you know, the way everybody looks at me.
who?
somebody say something?
one of the-the blood techs.
which one?
doesn't matter.
we talked about this.
people are going to think what they're going to think.
there's nothing we can do about it.
I just didn't know it was going to be this hard.
it's just another couple of weeks.
and then we'll have the baby, and none of this is going to matter.
she mention a name?
no, I dropped it.
she didn't want to talk about it.
how long has your wife been HIV positive?
uh, she was diagnosed about a year ago.
we've been together for two years.
it was a huge shock.
how about you? Have you tested positive?
no.
and how did your wife contract the disease?
what, did I say something funny?
no, but people always ask.
like it makes a difference?
I mean, what are you going to do?
decide if you should feel sorry for her or not?
I need to know, Mr. Sullivan.
she got it from some guy she dated a few years ago.
do you have a name?
no.
when meg got diagnosed,
I was so pissed, I wanted to kill him.
she wouldn't tell me.
anyone else she might have confided in?
her mother.
she pretty much makes it her business to know everything that's going on in meg's life.
would you be able to give me that number?
Yeah, of course.
the last call to Megan's cell came from a pay phone at the 5th street detention facility.
did you ask for the roll logs? - Yeah.
they process 500 inmates a day.
so what's up with the husband?
well, the nurses have him leaving the office at 8: 30, but his flight didn't leave until 1: 00.
and then traffic and security, that's at least two hours he's unaccounted for.
that's enough time to have pulled a Scott Peterson.
let's hope not.
so where are we with the baby snatching?
well, there was another attempt in a park near the hospital.
white female late 20s, and a witness made a sketch.
well, Mack's checking out the surveillance video from the parking lot at the hospital.
maybe he'll find a match. - Okay.
Hey, man.
what's up?
um, I just wanted to let you know that I went and checked out that meeting that you told me about over at the workshop.
yeah? - Yeah.
how did it go?
uh, pretty good.
anyway, um, I, uh,
I connected with this guy ed D.
a retired nypd.
says he remembers you.
fat. Fat and funny.
that's the guy, yeah.
he is funny.
but, um, he...
he offered to be my sponsor, so...
he's a good guy.
yeah? - He's a real good guy.
cool.
well, we're going to hook up for coffee tonight, and, you know, I guess take it from there.
thanks for all the support, man.
so...
okay, thanks.
says here you didn't work yesterday.
well, not in this office.
I pick up hours over at mount Sinai when I can.
I worked from 8: 00 to 4: 00.
and then?
I took the subway,
I went home.
why are you asking me this?
we're looking for Megan Sullivan.
and you think I did something to her?
well, she mentioned that she had a problem at her appointment last week.
we checked the records, and you drew her blood that day.
and apparently, you're not a big fan.
I have my opinions, and I have the right to them.
this should just take a second.
is there a problem?
no. Why?
if you're not comfortable,
I'd rather have somebody else do it.
hold still, please.
you know, I see women come in here every day who would make wonderful mothers, really deserving women.
they just can't get pregnant.
they must look at you and wonder, "why her?
why not me?"
where do you get off judging me?
I don't judge, god does.
to be so selfish, to put an innocent child at risk...
that's enough.
I'm sorry if I've offended you.
you are aware that Megan's chances of transmitting HIV to her baby with a c-section and the right drugs is less than one percent?
if I told you there was a one percent chance you'd get HIV if I used this needle, would you let me stick it in you?
I guess Megan didn't say anything to dr. Barnes about your little episode.
I'm not hiding anything.
well, it looks like we can rule out our wannabe baby snatcher. - Why's that?
I just spoke to nypd.
they id'd her as a patient at Bellevue.
turns out she spent all last week getting evaluated.
well, I've been checking into brian Sullivan's financials.
he spent three weeks at a local hotel a year ago.
by himself?
well, according to the hotel records.
I don't know, maybe things were a bit rough in the marriage before the pregnancy.
Brian stayed at a hotel because...
because Megan kicked him out.
he didn't tell you about his affair?
no, he didn't.
it happened right after Megan received her diagnosis.
when she needed him the most.
I told her that she should leave him, that she could do so much better, but she made up all kinds of excuses for him.
did brian break this affair off?
that's what he told Megan.
do you think he was telling the truth?
I think they're still having problems.
can you be more specific?
well, uh, Megan came to visit the other day and pick up some things for the baby, and...
and brian was with her.
stop it. I just...
I am so sick and tired of talking about it.
well, then, why is it still a problem?
I don't know.
you tell me.
this whole thing was a mistake.
is everything all right?
everything's fine.
what's that?
I know you said nothing pink or blue, but I couldn't resist.
look at this.
it's so sweet.
it's cute, ma. Thanks.
well, now, I don't want to upset anyone, but I-I just,
I feel that a grandma should be able to do whatever she wants.
after all.
I'll get the rest of the stuff.
sweetheart, what is going on?
nothing.
well, you know, your father and I didn't always see eye to eye, but we always managed to work things out.
is it the other woman?
is he seeing her again?
no. No.
are you sure?
we're fine.
everything's fine.
it's just...
it's just a stressful time right now, that's all.
it doesn't sound fine to me.
look at me.
you don't have to go through this alone.
I will be there for you and the baby, even if he isn't.
you know that, right?
I do, thanks.
I love you.
look, the truth is,
I gave up on him a long time ago.
but Megan reassured me that he was trying to make amends.
I have my doubts.
how did brian feel about Megan being HIV positive and having a baby?
having the baby was definitely Megan's idea.
after the way he reacted when she was diagnosed, she needed something to live for.
right.
right. Did she, um...
did she ever mention the name of this woman that brian was having an affair with?
it was jane something.
I called her plain jane.
I think brian knew her from work.
anybody talk to brian Sullivan yet?
anyone? plain jane?
well? Got about eight or nine janes to run down.
is any of them by the name of Carlson?
uh, maybe. Let's see.
Yeah. Jane Carlson's right here.
she works with a consulting firm that does business with brian's company. Why?
Mack ran all the plates from the parking lot cameras.
this is the only jane leaving the hospital around the time that Megan disappeared.
maybe brian got her to do his dirty work.
I don't really understand what's going on here.
why are you asking me about brian?
did something happen to him?
no, he's fine.
when was the last time you saw him?
I don't know.
two days ago at the office, I think.
he had to fly to Columbus yesterday to visit a client.
and where were you yesterday morning?
at work.
and before that?
I had some errands to run.
where?
at the hospital where brian and his wife have their ob appointments?
I was supposed to meet brian...
at a coffee shop around the corner to give him some plans that he needed for his trip.
I parked in the hospital lot because it was cheapest.
well, he never mentioned that meeting to us.
well, I don't know why he wouldn't.
miss Carlson, we know you two are having an affair, okay?
that ended months ago.
I swear.
Brian made it quite clear that he's committed to his wife.
that's her name.
Yeah, I know her name.
I'm sorry, but is it a federal crime to have an affair with a married man?
no.
but kidnapping is and so is murder.
look, you have to believe me. I...
when I last saw her, she was fine.
I mean, considering the circumstances.
well, it's not my problem.
really.
really. Well how about this
I don't care.
I am warning you, get out of my life!
please, I want to talk to you.
good for you.
Megan, wait. Please. Come on.
damn it!
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
I'll get it. Let me get it.
look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry...
about brian, what happened.
if I had known about your situation,
I never would have... honestly.
you mean, if you knew I was HIV positive, you wouldn't have slept with my husband.
what, were you scared you'd get it?
that's not what I meant.
what are you doing here anyway?
I have an appointment, physical therapy.
I got to go.
I lied to her about the appointment.
I figured brian probably hadn't told her we were meeting.
so you stood brian up at the cafe?
after I saw Megan,
I didn't really feel like seeing him.
that was a pretty heated phone call.
you have any idea who she was talking to?
no.
all right, well, let me ask you this.
did brian ever mention any problems that he and Megan were having?
he doesn't talk to me about her.
Mr. Sullivan.
Hi.
am I interrupting something?
no, just cleaning out the office.
waiting around is making me crazy.
any news about meg?
matter of fact, a few interesting things popped up.
what can you tell me about jane Carlson?
well, nothing you don't know, apparently.
you were supposed to have a meeting with her yesterday morning.
was that a detail that you planned on sharing with us later?
she's got nothing to do with this.
the affair is over.
it's been over for a year.
right, you moved on. - Yeah.
what's next?
yard sale for the crib?
you got no right to come in here and accuse me.
apparently, there was a fight at your mother-in-law's house.
she says that she heard you say that this is all a big mistake.
what were you referring to?
the baby?
no.
I was referring to her mother.
I didn't think it was a good idea to be there.
that woman has a way of making a day turn bad.
I gather your relationship with your mother-in-law is not so hot.
how's she feel about the baby?
Oh, she's obsessed.
so having the baby was your wife's idea, right?
no. We both wanted it.
"it"?
you just referred to your baby as "it."
is that why you didn't want to know he sex of the child?
what the hell are you talking about?
maybe it went further than you wanted it to go.
you know, when you have a kid, it's just a concept, until you get to the delivery room.
and then it gets very real, very fast.
no, no, you're wrong.
so how did you feel when your wife went missing?
how did I feel?
I wanted to puke.
you weren't just a little bit relieved?
Oh...
Yeah, I'm looking for whoever called Megan yesterday.
the desk sergeant at the detention facility said that one of the inmate's girlfriends charged him with giving her HIV.
name: Justin pomeroy.
do you think it's just a coincidence?
no, not really.
you got an address?
Yeah, south Bronx.
we're headed there now.
okay.
listen to me.
no, I'm not a perfect man, but I love my wife very much.
and I would never hurt her.
I would give anything to find her right now.
okay.
does the name Justin pomeroy mean anything to you?
no.
Why?
possibly he's the man that gave your wife HIV.
I haven't seen Megan.
your girlfriend Emily says you have.
she filed a police report claiming you willingly infected her with HIV.
and she found out from the pregnant woman who accosted you in front of your apartment.
and I'm guessing that was Megan.
Yeah.
she came by a couple of days ago.
I'm guessing it was payback.
Hey, meg.
how you been?
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
I should kill you for what you did, you bastard!
get the hell out of here.
what's going on?
does she know?
did you infect her, too?
what? - Did he tell you that he's HIV positive?
what's she talking about?
nothing. She's wacko.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but you need to get yourself checked.
next thing I know, the cops came and arrested me.
so why'd you call Megan yesterday?
because I was pissed that she ratted me out to Emily.
well, can you blame her?
come on, I don't hear anything for two years, she comes by and wrecks my van...
must have been the hormones.
Yeah, or maybe the fact that you gave her HIV.
so you never heard from her, even after she found out she was positive?
no, I just got a form letter from the department of health saying I should get tested.
all right, look, we're going to need to know your whereabouts for the last couple of days.
all right, thanks.
all right, so Justin pomeroy's alibi checks out.
he was at work all day.
he can join the club.
we've got a witness who saw brian waiting at the coffee shop where he was supposed to meet jane Carlson, and she's solid at a conference all day.
well, we subpoenaed Megan's work computer.
she's been running internet searches for HIV specialists.
why would she do that?
I thought she already had one.
maybe she wants a new one.
last time I saw Mrs. Sullivan was two days ago.
why was she here?
she was worried about some swelling around her neck.
so I did some tests.
she came in for the results.
you were right to be concerned.
it's a good thing you came in when you did.
you have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
last time I saw my doctor, my cd4 count was fine.
Yeah, which bodes well for your prognosis.
your status does change, however, from HIV positive to aids.
I can't believe this.
what about my baby?
well, you can have the baby.
start on the new meds and begin chemotherapy as soon as you recover from the c-section.
how long do I have?
well, we caught this early, and that's what matters.
the rest we take one step at a time. - Listen, doctor...
I'm going to have this baby soon.
I need to know how long
I'm gonna be around to take care of it.
Mrs. Sullivan...
I'm going to go on the internet, and I'm going to find out.
please, tell me.
I tried explaining that any prognosis, good or bad, is just averages.
each person responds to treatments differently.
but she didn't want to hear that?
no.
what did you end up telling her?
worse case scenario, with no compatible cocktail, and if her body doesn't handle the chemo, could be as little as six months.
Hey.
no suicide victims matching Megan's description have come in to the morgue.
I still think we have to consider it an option.
look, I don't think she would have risked her baby's life, first of all, and second of all,
I think she was living to have this baby.
but with her worsening physical condition, her mental state could have deteriorated.
that's why we have to consider it a possibility.
fine.
um, so, what?
I guess someone should tell her husband about the lymphoma, unless he knows already.
I don't think he knows.
well, do you want me to tell him?
no. I'll tell him.
she's dying?
the doctor wasn't that definitive.
but she's sick?
or sicker.
why didn't she tell me?
maybe because she thought you'd react the same way when she told you she had HIV.
I know I made a mistake, but I have tried so hard to make it up to her.
some things are hard to let go.
um, was there anything in her behavior, did she do anything odd that could be a result of the diagnosis?
Yeah, uh...
maybe.
she, um...
she decided to start a scrapbook.
the day we got into that fight, going over to her mom's house to get some stuff from the attic.
old photos, meg's report card, a note she'd written in school.
she worked on it till about midnight.
I just figured she was nesting.
are you ever coming to bed?
sorry, I'm just working on my scrapbook.
your dad had a real tom Selleck thing going on, didn't he?
he told me he kept it like that cause it would tickle my cheek when he'd kiss me good night.
when he'd get in late, the scratchy feel of it would wake me up, and he'd give me a kiss and tell me, "go back to dreamland."
sounds like a sweet guy.
I was barely six when he died.
I don't really remember much about him.
well, didn't your mom ever talk about him?
I think his dying was hard on her.
look at you.
even when you were little, your smile crept up more on the right than on the left.
so what do you think?
you think the baby's will creep up on the left to compensate?
you go back to bed.
I'm just going to finish this all up.
okay.
good night.
good night.
it's a girl.
excuse me?
I called dr. Barnes, got her to tell me.
the baby is a girl.
girls are good.
who's this other girl in the photograph?
Oh, that's meg's sister, Linda.
I wasn't even aware that she had a sister.
meg hasn't seen her for 20 years.
wow, it's been a long time.
do you have any idea where she is?
no.
I found this inside the scrapbook.
all the numbers belong to women named Linda Ryder, so she's definitely looking for her sister.
well, there can't be that many linden rider's in the tristate area.
Yeah, I would love that.
okay, great.
all right, thanks.
listen to this:
somebody picked up a refill of Megan's HIV medication at a pharmacy in Walden this morning.
does that match any of your Linda ryders?
en donde es?
I guess you found the sister.
Yep.
how can Megan be missing?
I put her on the bus back to the city this afternoon.
what time did you drop her off?
we missed the first bus because we went to the pharmacy, so she took the 1: 00.
it would have gotten into port authority about 3: 30.
she should be home by now.
I'm gonna call port authority police.
okay.
you know she's sick.
Yeah.
did you check the hospitals?
Yes, we did.
now, obviously, we know that she's going through a lot right now, but was there anything that she said that could explain why she didn't go home?
I think it might be about what I told her.
I'm so sorry, Megan, for what you've had to go through.
when I first found out I was HIV positive,
I felt my life was over.
then, I realized that...
I didn't have to live every day like I was going to die.
having a baby just made sense.
you know, I was healthy.
I was one of the lucky ones.
everything would work out.
it still can.
I want my baby to know who I am...
what I was like.
when you were a kid?
you were a pain in the ass.
you used to sneak into my room and steal my clothes all the time.
you sure you want me to tell them that?
I didn't think you'd want to see me after all this time.
of course.
I've always wanted to see you.
I sent you all those letters.
Really?
I didn't get any letters.
Oh, well, it doesn't matter.
it was a long time ago.
but I don't understand.
if you sent me letters, how come mom didn't give them to me?
I don't know.
Linda, please.
tell me.
I guess she was afraid I'd... tell you.
tell me what?
the truth about dad.
he didn't die, Megan.
he ran off with his secretary.
mom didn't tell you because the truth was too painful.
she kept pretending that it didn't happen.
I just couldn't take it anymore.
that's why I left.
I guess it was just easier for her to never tell you.
my mom grew up in an orphanage, so I get why she can't deal with people leaving her.
maybe I should have been more sympathetic, but mom didn't make it easy.
where does your father live?
he's in a nursing home outside Hartford.
Oh, he's sick?
had a stroke four years ago.
so it wasn't a very easy night for Megan.
no.
thank you. Bye.
clerk at Walden bus station said Megan exchanged her ticket for one to Hartford.
Hartford, huh?
I bet she's going to visit her dad.
Yeah. I'm going to call Elena, have her check it out.
Yeah, she was by earlier today, arrived right after my shift started.
so did she get to see her father?
she spent about an hour with him.
by any chance, did you hear what they were talking about?
I was only in there a few minutes, but she did most of the talking.
we've been married for two years, and you're going to be a grandfather soon.
when I was...
when I was little,
I...
used to say my prayers at night, and I would ask god to send messages to you, like about things that were going on in my life.
dad, I...
I thought about you all the time.
just wondering about, you know, what it would have been like if you would have been around.
just wondering if you were thinking about me up there in heaven.
miss?
sometimes if he's not too tired, he'll blink once really slowly to say yes.
we missed out on so much, didn't we?
I came back later, she was gone.
okay, do you know what time she left?
well, she wasn't there when I went around with medications around 3: 00.
you know, this is a place people come to say good-bye.
we don't get a lot of hellos.
ma'am, just hold on.
nobody at port authority saw anyone matching Megan's description get off that bus.
I think I know why.
NYPD just sent this over.
911, what's your emergency?
I'm in labor.
you have to help me.
I'm trying to get to the hospital, but I can't make it.
Oh, god, it hurts so bad.
all right, ma'am, what's your name?
please, send someone quick.
what is your location, ma'am?
but I can't see.
it's so dark around here.
I don't know where I am.
Oh, my god.
ma'am, just hold on.
please. - Ma'am?
that's it.
the call dies there.
when did it come in?
20 minutes ago.
martin and Sam will be at the mother's house in five minutes.
wait, look at this.
two years before Megan's father left, her mother was institutionalized.
well, I've checked all the hospitals in Staten island, and Megan didn't get into any of them, at least not yet.
all right, so she's going to need a c-section so that she doesn't give the baby HIV.
I think we should set up a grid search from her last point of contact.
all right, I'm on it. - Good.
Mrs. Ryder, FBI.
Hello?
Mrs. Ryder?
Mrs. Ryder.
Mrs...
Mrs. Ryder, where's Megan?
I'm going to take a look around.
Mrs. Ryder.
I need you to look at me.
Where's Megan?
she's at the hospital having a baby.
no, she isn't.
she didn't make it to the hospital.
do you know where she is?
no.
she's not here.
did you do something...
to Megan?
I would never hurt Megan.
she's my whole world.
Oh.
I have been worried sick about you.
you know the FBI is looking for you.
I'm fine.
well, we need to call them.
I saw Linda.
she told me what really happened with dad.
Oh, you shouldn't listen to your sister.
he didn't die.
well, um...
your father really loved you girls very much, and I wanted you to have good memories.
how about reality, mom?
don't lecture me about reality, Megan.
all I've ever done is try to protect you.
from what?
the truth?
that dad left you for his secretary?
that you ran dad and Linda away just like you're doing with my husband?!
your husband cheated on you.
and I am trying to forgive him, but you won't let me forget!
he does not deserve your forgiveness.
Yeah, he does.
but you know, I...
I don't know if you do.
I've had enough of this.
no, no, no, no, no.
you are going to listen to me.
I have lymphoma.
what are you saying?
who told you this?
a doctor.
well, he doesn't know what he's talking about, because you're gonna be just fine.
we are all going to be fine. - Stop for once!
can you stop pretending that everything is going to be fine?!
I'm not going to have this conversation. - Then you know what?!
I don't want you in my life!
and I don't want you in this baby's life!
you do not know what you're saying.
good-bye, mom.
Oh... oh, damn it. - Oh, sweetheart.
stay away from me!
just let me help you. - Stop!
she just grabbed my car keys and left.
what kind of car do you drive?
what color?
blue.
I would have taken care of her.
what's your location?
we're heading down sycamore.
all right, make a right on Ilene.
PD has everything south of you.
they have a chopper on the way.
all right, copy that.
here we go.
okay, I think we got her.
700 block of Ilene.
Megan, I'm martin with the FBI.
how you doing?
you okay?
I need to get to a hospital. - I know, I know.
should we get her in the cruiser?
I don't think we should move her.
I'll follow you, okay?
special agent spade again. - Megan, can you scoot over real slowly?
take it easy. - I'm going to be escorting a blue caprice.
repeat, a blue caprice.
hang in there.
we're gonna get you to the hospital.
Hey, Mr. Sullivan.
they did the c-section.
your baby is gonna be okay.
how's meg?
doctor said that under the circumstances, she's doing fine.
thank you.
you're welcome.
what are you standing around here for?
get in there.
Hey.
maybe they'll name the baby after you.
Mm.
that seems cruel.
or, uh, little Jackie might work.
Yeah, I like that, little Jackie Sullivan.
but most importantly, be proud of yourself.
when you first came here to Shield House, you said that you had nothing.
no home for your kids, and no hope.
but now you leave us 152 days sober...
and a new apartment and a good job.
I know it's not much, Tyra, but "thank you" just won't cover it.
thank you.
Oh, and Breck gets one, too.
where is he?
right here, Gail.
my babies and me won't ever forget what you and Tyra and everyone of you all have done for us.
thank you.
you shouldn't.
I mean, I feel silly accepting thanks from any of you.
talk about heroes.
how hard you all work to lift yourselves up, to make yourselves better.
it really inspires me to want to do the same.
but enough about me.
you go, Gail.
all right, bye.
how's it coming?
nothing yet.
Danny just called from the guy's apartment, which happens to be on Park Avenue, by the way.
there's no car in his assigned spot, and the doorman hasn't seen him in two days.
let me ask you something:
what's a guy who lives on Park Avenue doing in the South Bronx?
community service.
possession with Intent landing him in jail for 30 days, plus 500 hours, which he completed a month ago.
really.
so why's he still here?
that's a very good question.
wait, wait. Stop it right there.
is that him?
that's him.
five hours before he went missing.
looks like he has company.
wonder what he has in the bag.
Mr. Mulligan, we're not even sure it's a kidnapping at this point.
what else would it be?
you name it. It could be any number of things.
did your son talk about any problems that he had lately?
no. Not that I know of.
have you seen this man?
no, I don't think so.
let's talk about your son's drug history.
when he was 16 his mother died and I...
I didn't keep him at home.
I let him go back to that, that boarding school, and the worst bunch of spoiled ne'er-do-wells that you've ever met.
so all those misdemeanors prior to his Class B felony was because of a bunch of high school kids?
no, I'm just saying that that's where it got started.
but he's a good boy.
that's why I had to get tough on him.
I just wasn't going to pull strings for him anymore.
dad!
this is a total setup.
just be quiet!
these cops are idiots.
those idiots have you on possession with intent, Breck.
that means jail.
not if I didn't do it.
look, I was at the club.
I grabbed someone else's coat.
just no more excuses.
now wasting your life is one thing, but I will not let you kill yourself.
kill myself?
look, let-let's just get out of here.
We'll-We'll talk about it over breakfast.
no, we're through talking.
I'm not fixing this, son.
not this time.
what the hell are you talking about?
I'll cover your legal fees and your basics thereafter.
we'll give it a year, more if necessary.
you're cutting me off?
you need to grow up, Breck.
you need to prove to me that you deserve all that you've been given.
until you do, you're on your own.
deserve?
like-like you deserve?
what the hell have you ever done with your life?
I never embarrassed my family.
Yeah, right.
Hey, Dad.
Oh, come on, Dad.
Oh, come on.
you-you can't do this, Dad! No, Dad, come on!
plea...
it was the hardest thing I ever did, I think.
but I'd like to think that it did him some good.
so just how cut off was he?
I keep a roof over his head, but no more weekends in Vail on the platinum card.
that sounds tough.
regardless of what you two may think, it was a rude awakening for Breck.
but he's making a go of it.
he sounded great last time I talked to him on the phone.
and what was that call in reference to?
he wanted money.
45000
for what?
he said it was for Shield House, but he didn't get it.
your son is a repeat offender.
did it cross your mind that he might be doing drugs again?
the thought had occurred to me, yes.
does he look familiar to you?
I don't know, it's-it's kind of hard to tell with this.
we're wondering if it might be drug-related.
I doubt that.
if anything, Breck counseled some of our residents.
how many do you have?
it varies.
right now, we're at 32 women with 26 kids.
some of these women have, criminal records, right?
drugs, prostitution.
a few, but they would never hurt Breck.
you seem pretty sure about that.
put it this way.
our women come to Shield House to start over.
they're not about to invite more trouble than they've already had.
what about abusive husbands, dealers, pimps?
they can't be happy about these women running out on them.
no.
no, and they can be a problem, and Breck did have a run-in with one of those guys.
but that was almost two months ago.
why don't you tell me what happened?
understand, Breck wasn't very helpful at first.
he was nice enough, but not big on getting his hands dirty.
until that day.
Breck, what the hell's going on?
Tyra, this is only temporary.
this guy came in.
I tried to stop him, but...
no. Where's everybody going?
the shelter.
what?
look, everything was fine until this drunken maniac came in.
can I help you?
where is Maritsa?
Maritsa? Wait. Is-is she expecting you?
sure, get her out here.
she's in a workshop right now.
don't you "workshop" me, maricon!
tell that bitch to come down here.
look, hey, hey, look, man, look, I understand.
you understand nothing! -You know what?
don't lay your hands on me, puto!
get off me, bitch.
get off me.
Dana, call 911.
I'll kill your ass.
the cops took him away, but one of them went upstairs to talk to Maritsa and stepped right through that hole in the floor.
Oh, no.
and the next thing I know, the city building inspector is here, and someone from the Health Department.
they're making us shut down six units until we can fix these violations.
Oh, God.
no. This will cost a fortune.
it'll be okay.
no,
Breck, it won't.
nothing's okay about the shelter.
Breck, do we really have to go?
no.
I mean, yes, but you won't be...
but I don't like the shelter.
I'm sorry.
here, you keep her.
the shelter's not safe.
you keep her here.
I will.
and I'll make sure she's very safe, okay, Loretta?
okay.
you start the repairs.
I'll get the money.
that's the day he really got it.
he understood the work that we do, what we mean to these families.
and I know he felt responsible.
how much money are we talking about?
almost $90, 000.
that includes plumbing and carpentry.
how much did Breck raise?
he was getting close.
he showed up with almost $25, 000 that first week alone.
but eventually the money did slow down, and...
he kept chipping away at it, but those families are still in the shelter.
where was he getting all this money from?
his rich friends, I guess.
all right, I'm gonna need a list of those donations.
also, any information you had about Maritsa's husband.
sure.
okay, so Felipe made bail the next day, and I can't seem to make out enough of this guy's face to catch any resemblance.
they're both ugly.
Yes, this is true.
how is that donor list coming?
well, it's okay, except for one thing.
that first 25 grand Breck raised, it came almost exclusively in banker's checks.
now, after that, he started showing up with, um, cash donations.
cash?
totaling $31, 000.
and it's listed as "In-kind Gifts from Anonymous Donors." See that?
all right, so...
so let's say Breck taps out his friends, borrows cash from this guy...
and gets killed for not paying him back?
don't think he got killed.
you can't squeeze money out of a dead man.
so, esta hombre, usted...
saw him tres noches pasado?
pardon, pardon, menos rapido, por favor.
good, you're back. I'm dying here.
un momento, por favor.
doing great, gringo.
keep going.
I think he said something about three white guys jumping out of a car.
SUV.
okay, you just asked him how much he weighs.
I did?
you did.
no. Que paso?
okay.
what the hell?
what do you thing you doing
get off me!
please, let me go
just ask him if he saw the plates, please?
the first three letters of the plates were P-D-H.
textbook kidnapping.
get off me!
please let me go gracias.
okay.
we got a hit off a partial plate from DMV.
champagne Escalade ran a red light on the East Side eight minutes after Breck was abducted.
I love photo tickets.
say that when you get one.
this one is registered to a Todd Kipling from Scarsdale.
he doesn't look like a Todd.
she doesn't look like a Todd either.
you're kidding me.
what is this, FBI traffic school?
why was your girlfriend in such a hurry?
first of all, Heidi's not my girlfriend, so I'm quite available.
Oh, that's a shock.
why don't you tell us what was the hurry?
we were late.
I didn't even know I ran the light.
Heidi, that's not what this is about.
we have a witness who saw that car involved in an apparent kidnapping that same night.
no.
that was a total goof.
a goof?
totally.
like a prank.
was Breck in on it?
no.
why would I ruin the surprise?
the party was for him.
so it was a surprise party?
or in Breck's case, more like a surprise intervention.
we hardly see him anymore.
he's so busy with that charity.
not that we didn't support what he was doing.
we've been friends forever.
since boarding school.
Breck and Todd.
but we go back even further.
Breck's like a brother to me.
please, just call him.
he'll tell you, it's no kidnapping.
why don't you just tell us a little bit more about this so-called intervention.
I planned the party, and Todd thought it'd be a fun way of getting Breck there.
I don't have any money!
you may think I do, but I don't!
stop! This is cruel!
okay, okay.
Oh, son of a bitch!
you guys!
what the hell?!
Oh, my God!
come on.
you should have seen your face.
you scared the crap out of me, man.
we wanted to see you, and God knows you never call us anymore.
after this, you wonder why?
how any self-respecting spoiled rich kid can lower himself to ask those crusty old blue bloods for money is beyond me.
it's beyond me, too, man.
I can't stay, guys.
what are you talking about?
you're not going anywhere.
no, we got the whole place to ourselves.
everybody's in there waiting for you.
you're the guest of honor, man.
you picked, like, the worst possible night.
but, Breck, come on, we miss you.
I don't miss you guys.
Yes, you do.
no, I don't.
he didn't stay long.
where do you think he was going?
I don't know.
was he high? Was he looking for drugs?
I wouldn't know.
I mean, that's not my thing.
it's not your thing?
I'm looking at your record here.
DUI 2002,2004,2005, a visit to the Betty Ford Clinic just this year.
that is privileged information.
you have no right... -Your privileges have been revoked in here!
now look at this picture.
clearly, you are driving this vehicle, probably under the influence, and your license has been suspended indefinitely.
now, if I put this in the right hands, you are looking at serious prison time.
just call Breck, please, and he'll tell you.
I would, if he wasn't missing.
missing?
missing.
I don't know anything.
I...
he wasn't in a good place.
he had been on an upswing, but he wasn't that night.
what is wrong with you?!
where do I begin?
it's been a bad couple of days.
a month ago you were on top of the world, preaching the joys of philanthropy.
which proves I can suck the joy out of just about anything.
that is not true.
you love what you're doing.
I can tell.
I love what I'm doing, Heidi, but not what I did, not at all.
what are you talking about?
yo, Breck, this one's got your name on it, man.
no, Barry, no, no. He's cool.
come on, like old times, dude.
Breck, no.
no, Breck.
why not?
who cares, anyway?
wait, do you want some food?
you should eat something.
look, I'm not hungry.
I got to go.
go?!
go where?
look, I'll be back.
God...
is there a pay phone around here?!
I don't know.
so it was drugs?
he's my friend.
and it didn't worry you that your friend never came back?
why would it?
I just figured that he went home.
okay, Heidi, we need you to write down the name of the club, the names of your friends and anybody else who may have seen him that night.
look, I'd be more than happy to help, but that's a lot of numbers.
just get your treo out and get busy, Blondie.
Mr. Mulligan?
any word?
no, not yet, sir.
look, if you'd rather be at home, we can always call you as soon as we know something.
let me ask you something, Agent,...
I was shown a photo of a man earlier, some kind of surveillance from Shield House.
right.
do you think you recognize him now?
no.
but
and I only thought about this afterwards
my son had asked me for money.
I was aware of that.
I'm sure that wasn't easy for you.
all his life,
I'd said yes to him, whatever he wanted.
the one time I say no, we end up here.
I just want him back.
I know you do.
thank you.
Omar's Dungeon confirmed that Breck's friends stayed there till closing with Todd Kipling picking up the check.
for wealthy people, they sure know how to slum it.
anything from the pay phone?
it shows six calls between the hours of 10: 00 and 12: 00, all 212, 917, and there's one 203 lasting less than a minute.
203-- that's Connecticut.
and it's to an E. M. Danforth.
why does that ring a bell?
hang on.
all right, here she is.
she didn't call us back.
$10, 000 from personal trust of Elizabeth Manning Danforth, dated 2/28/06.
Oh, my poor Breck.
I had no idea.
he was last seen before he placed a call here at 10: 23 p. m.
Oh, my God.
and here I thought he'd just gotten distracted by work.
what do you mean?
he said he was running late, and when he never showed,
I assumed he'd gotten busy with the charity.
miss Danforth, I wanted to ask you...
please.
okay, Betty, was Breck in the habit of making late-night visits?
occasionally.
is that a problem?
so what exactly was going on here?
we had a brief relationship several years ago.
how old was Breck?
younger.
we both were.
but then the world got a bit too small, so we decided to go back to being friends, until a month ago.
what happened a month ago?
we bumped into each other at a Guggenheim function.
he was trying to raise money, and feeling for him, I...
we had a few drinks.
so your next donation will go to repair these walls and this corridor, and...
I completely suck at this.
I've seen worse.
I got to get this money, Betty.
I mean, you should see these kids.
this girl, she gave me her doll to keep until she can move back in.
look, I'd write you another check, but my accountant already thinks I gave too much.
maybe next month.
I know.
you've been so great.
give me a hand, won't you?
sorry.
it's quite all right.
don't let Sotheby's give you less than $6, 000.
no, Betty, I couldn't.
I insist.
take it.
only this time, let's be discreet.
no.
I-I... I don't know.
don't know what?
we're both adults who've done it before.
and you want to help those kids, right?
so the relationship is back on?
I wouldn't say that.
I mean, believe me, I'm intensely fond of Breck.
it's just...
more of an arrangement now.
how often?
once, twice a week.
so it's safe to say that these in-kind donations are from you?
I'm not that generous.
there's others?
Oh, it's possible I may have bragged just a little.
so Breck was pimping himself out for charity.
Oh, that's such an ugly word.
what word would you use, Mrs. Danforth?
escort.
that's what he is, an escort.
we just don't happen to go anywhere.
you still on hold?
they play the worst Muzak ever.
is there good Muzak?
so I figure if a gigolo leads to lonely women, some of those lonely women got to have husbands.
I'm gonna cross-reference the Shield House donor list.
see what I can find out.
okay.
no, I'm here. Yes.
okay, and when was that?
all right, thank you.
we don't have to worry about this one.
he clear?
he's dead.
killed by a rival gangbanger two weeks ago.
Oh, Felipe, we hardly knew you.
okay, look.
I've been going over this Sotheby's list of everything Breck sold them, right?
there's jewelry, silver, watches, net worth over $30, 000, but the interesting item is a vase worth close to five grand.
because it was part of a set,
sotheby's put a call in to the previous owner to approve the sale.
and who was that?
that would be one Clayton Whitney, Esquire.
sorry to stop by so late, Mrs. Whitney.
what happened? Is it my husband?
what, he's not here?
no, he...
what is this about?
we're looking for Breck Mulligan.
who?
did you pay Breck for sex?
I don't know what you are talking about.
it must have hurt.
Breck give you that shiner?
no, no.
Breck would never...
so much for "Breck who?"
why don't you tell us about your relationship with him.
there is no relationship.
tell me. What happened?
he, Clayton, he...
Clayton did this to you?
he knows about us.
sotheby's called him.
he put it together.
he went crazy.
he wants a divorce.
a divorce?
but I don't care.
he can have one.
no, no.
look, it's just...
it doesn't matter, Breck, have you.
me?
we don't have to sneak around anymore.
I don't know how to say this.
I am so sorry.
no.
you have nothing to be sorry for.
Yes, I do.
listen.
I've never thought of us as anything more than...
what we've been doing.
I thought you understood.
get out.
I'm so sorry, Carol.
that was... three days ago.
Clayton's been in the Hamptons ever since.
have you spoken to Breck or your husband since then?
is it possible that your husband was pissed off enough to hire somebody to kill Breck?
no, I don't think so.
then again, I never thought he would hit me, either.
I'm going to need that address in the Hamptons.
right.
I'll take care of it.
unbelievable.
what?
that was Danny calling from Whitney's place out in the Hamptons.
his alibi check out?
he completely denies going after Breck, but he does admit that he called Shield House to let them know what Breck was up to with his wife.
you knew full well what he was doing to raise money.
Yes, but...
but what?
you just forgot to mention it?
I was scared.
I can't have you shutting us down.
we're not interested in shutting you down.
maybe not you, but 85% of our funding came from church groups.
if word of what he did got out, that would be gone, and we would be done.
and I can't let that happen.
even if that means us not finding Breck.
look, I love the guy, but I have to think of Shield House
the women, the kids.
all right, so you got a call from Mr. Whitney telling you what Breck was doing with his wife?
no, that's not how I found out.
Breck had come in because he knew it had to stop, but he had to admit it to me first.
is that the best way that you can think of to raise money?
by sexing up a bunch of old rich women?!
look, we needed the money, Tyra.
like there aren't other ways to get it?
when that little girl Loretta looked at me...
I mean, she...
I had to do something.
she needed me.
and if what you did gets us shut down, then where does Loretta go?
I...
I just wanted to help.
this could ruin us.
I won't let it.
look, I'll stop, and I will make it right.
I don't think you can.
you have to let me try.
please.
I need this place.
he had done so much for us.
I just couldn't say no.
so what was he planning?
he had five or six in-kind donations that he hadn't cashed in yet.
he was going to return them.
I guess it was his way of undoing things.
and did you happen to get a look of any of these in-kind donations?
didn't want to.
he had them in his bag.
right.
anyway, that's where he was going that night...
to make things right.
okay.
I need you to run a name for me.
what, your computer broken?
can you be nice, please?
all right, Nazar Rahim, of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.
what's up?
remember that vase that Mrs. Whitney gave to Breck?
it was part of a set.
exactly.
what happened to the other vase?
I don't know. -Sotheby's has no record of it.
neither does Christie's.
so I started to call the pawn shops.
there's this place called First Rate Collectibles that purchased the matching vase from a Nazar Rahim for $800 two days ago.
is that a coincidence?
I don't think so
check this out.
narcotics, narcotics, narcotics, assault with a deadly weapon, narcotics, narcotics.
I think this guy likes narcotics.
this is your finger drilling a hole in the guy's chest.
and this is you trying to steal his bag.
so what?
the guy owed me money.
for what, drugs?
what drugs?
I'm a businessman now.
what kind of a business are you in?
business of looking good, my man.
so how much did Breck owe you?
5000
so he paid you with a vase?
and he screwed me, too.
it wasn't even worth $1, 000.
Yes, it was.
I'd say it was First Rate Collectibles that screwed you.
look, Nazar, here's the deal.
we could keep you here as long as we want just for looking good.
I didn't touch one hair on his head.
no, you, you threw him against the wall.
I was pissed.
sucker owed me money.
I got only $800 for your stupid vase.
you think you could cheat me?
look, I told you where to sell it.
sotheby's knows exactly what that's worth.
I want the rest.
you had the rest.
I already paid you.
there's nothing in there for you!
then I guess I go back to see the bitch.
No!
look, this is my debt now.
I told her I'd take care of it, and I did.
no, you didn't.
you listen.
you leave her alone.
she has enough trouble staying away from you as it is.
you're killing her!
you don't tell me what to do.
okay?
that was it.
so if he's missing now, maybe he's hiding from me.
all right, who was the girl?
I think she must be hiding, too.
listen, Nazar, I need names.
who was the girl?
all right, why don't you take a seat right there.
thanks for coming in again, Heidi.
what's going on?
did you find Breck?
no.
but we have another friend of yours in custody.
he's no friend of mine.
that's not what he says.
he says you owe him 5, 000 bucks, and that Breck was covering for you.
that's a lie.
and why would I need Breck's money anyway?
because you've been snorting your own up your nose.
what?
what is...what is this?
Heidi, you want to explain to us why you bought a one-way ticket from the Fishkill train station into Manhattan the same night that Breck disappeared?
look, Fishkill, is about, what, a half-hour north from here?
so how'd you get up there, Heidi?
that's right.
I, um, I lost my bag last week.
you know, I have FBI agents combing Fishkill right now.
you could help narrow the search if you wanted to.
where did you get that?
the question is, where did you get it?
I don't know.
you don't know how Breck's bag ended up in your apartment?
you know what I think?
I think your parents wouldn't give you the money you owed, but you knew Breck would bail you out.
I didn't mean it.
you didn't mean what?
I want to be a better person.
I really do.
you could start right now by telling the truth.
I was just so scared.
and Breck had all these other things on his mind.
Breck, this one's got your name on it, dude.
no. Thanks, Barry, I'm-I'm...
come on!
dude, I'm cool.
I'm cool.
Thanks.
what?
don't look at me like that.
I'm-I'm a nervous wreck.
and if you laid off that crap to begin with, you wouldn't have to be.
you said you would cover me.
and I did!
look, Nazar's an idiot.
I'll-I'll talk to him, and we'll work it out.
tomorrow.
I-I got to go.
go?!
go where?
look, I'm-I'm taking all this stuff back.
Oh, my God.
hopefully marking the end of the stupidest thing I've ever done.
wait, Breck, just one of these would cover Nazar.
they don't belong to me, and they're not for him, either.
Breck, please!
you know, is-is there a pay phone around here?
I don't know.
I'm getting you out of here.
come on.
we took a cab back to his neighborhood and got the car and started driving up towards Connecticut.
just stop wasting time.
just get the money you need from your parents, and-and get clean and come and work with me.
come on.
that rich bitch won't even notice if we return this stuff or not.
you're not even listening to me.
what, you don't even trust me now?
not so much.
I trust you.
you trust anyone who can score you an eight-ball.
you make me sound like I'm a junkie.
it's because you are.
what?
you should see yourself.
these jerks you're hanging out with.
look, you only hang out with them 'cause they get you high.
they don't care about you.
that is not true.
stop wasting your life.
what are you talking about?
I'm-I'm sorry.
excuse me if I'm not whoring myself out for some charity.
look, I am trying to do the right thing!
I'm trying hard to help people.
Really? You're trying to help people.
I help people Oh...
I help people all the time.
you use people, just like you're using me right now 'cause you need someone to save your ass.
shut up.
shut up!
Oh, my God.
I didn't mean to hit him.
I didn't mean to hit him that hard.
he just lost control of the car, but I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean to hit him that hard.
then why'd you just leave him there?
I don't know.
Oh, no.
when nobody came to help us, I just panicked.
and I...
I-I crawled out of the car and followed the train station lights back towards town.
but you had the presence of mind to take this.
Breck was the only real friend I ever had.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
we got him, Martin.
quarter mile east of the train station, not 30 yards below the highway.
there is no way a driver going by fast would have seen him.
no way.
okay.
Thanks.
all right.
okay.
thank you.
did he suffer?
no, he didn't.
the coroner, uh, said that he died on impact.
what was he doing up there?
I-I think he was probably trying to make up for some of the mistakes he made in his life, but more importantly, he was really trying to help out those kids at Shield House.
shield House.
Yes, sir.
that place really meant a lot to your son.
I'm sorry.
thank you.
thank you so much, Mr. Mulligan, for completing the work that your son started.
while the money that Breck provided can be replaced, filling the void that he leaves behind will be no easy task.
how do you measure the spirit of someone who helped so many?
and while writing a check is no doubt a very generous act, actually touching someone's life
that takes more.
where will the next Breck come from?
I... I honestly don't know.
I just hope he or she comes soon.
time to close up.
can't you prop the back door again?
I've got to nail this jump.
tomorrow's the invitational.
Oh, geez, I don't know.
how 'bout I wait five minutes?
I'll walk you out.
the way I'm skating, it's gonna take a lot longer than that.
it's all right. I don't mind.
no, I don't want to keep you.
really, I'll be okay.
well, make sure it doesn't stick is time when you close it.
I will.
good luck.
Jack: Are you kidding?
I'd love to spend time with her.
no, drop her at the office. That's great.
okay.
Maria and the kids?
Yeah, she's in town.
she got them tickets tonight to see Wicked.
perfect choice.
Katie doesn't want to go.
Aw, she wants to spend time with her daddy.
that's right.
how much you pay her?
50 bucks.
okay, her name is Kelly McMurphy. 15 years old.
she was supposed to call her mom to come re and pick her up.
the call never came. That was two nights ago.
anybody see her leave this place?
I don't know yet.
Vivian's trying to locate the rink manager
his name is, uh...
how far does she live from here?
not far, three miles.
so she could have walked. Yeah, we set up a canvas.
Hey. Any luck on Mr. Wade Covington?
no, so I got Danny to run a background check on him.
he changed his name from Wade Covney, probably to hide the fact that he did time for raping a 14-year-old girl.
man: How's a guy like that get a joaround kids?
we're looking into that.
how long have you been your daughter's coach, Mr. McMurphy?
ten years.
I understand that, uh, you lost your son recently?
um, two months ago.
would you mind telling me under what circumstances?
Jason was driving home from the rink and he lost control.
his car went over the side of an embankment.
how did Kelly take it?
she was devastated.
Jason taught Kelly how to skate.
he pulled her around a pond near our old house in White Plains for an entire winter.
did your son compete as well?
no-- hockey rat, like me. I played some in college.
what's your daughter's training schedule like?
uh, she practices from 5: 00 to 8: 00 a. m. and then after school from 4: 00 to 9: 00.
sounds like a lot of pressure.
that's what it takes to get to the Olympics.
Kelly wouldn't just disappear, not with a competition tonight.
okay, I don't know about that.
she was very upset the other day.
what happened?
I know, I missed my triple toe.
it's okay, you were wonderful for the rest of it.
no. She wasn't.
your jumps were low, your position into your lay back was sloppy.
I couldn't focus.
dad, what do you want from me?
I want your best, Kel, which is clear you weren't giving out there. Why?
I've hadnough.
I don't want to do this anymore.
you're throwing away ten years of traing because you had an off night?
I've bn thinking about it for a while.
well, I'm not going to let you stop just 'cause you're having a bad couple of days.
look, I just...
it just isn't fun anymore.
commitment isn't easy, Kel, but I promise you, when you're up there with silver on one side and bronze on the other, it will be worth it.
I was not gonna let her waste her gift.
I think we've put too ch pressure on her since the accident
what do you want?
to let her think about what happened to her brother 24 hours a day?
she's 15.
Mr. McMurphy, we're not done.
do you have any idea where your daughter might go?
no.
Yeah. Sure.
I ran the rink's pay phone records, and turns out that a call was made right before closing, to a hotel in Poughkeepsie.
I don't suppose the parents would have any idea what she'd be doing there?
no, they don't.
and I spoke to one of Kelly's friends.
she's been blowing off the practice sessions that she usually goes to without her father.
any idea what she's been doing with her spare time?
doesn't have a clue.
is now a bad time?
no, no, no. Come in.
special Agent Cassidy.
special Agent Taylor.
all right, well, I'm gonna call local PD and make sure they start circulating
Kelly's picture around the hotel.
great.
okay.
how's the case?
you don't want to know. Too much?
do you need to cancel tonight? No, no, no.
actually, I wanted to ask you if, um...
you could make the reservation for three.
Yeah.
who's the surprise guest?
my daughter, Kate.
Oh.
she's sweet.
she's lovely.
you'd enjoy her.
Wow.
I, uh, I don't know, Jack.
what don't yoknow?
how to talk to kids, for starters.
well, it's not that difficult.
I tried to make smaltalk once with my nephews about the trade deficit.
what's wrong with that?
they're eight and five. Hmm.
why don't you just treat it like an anthropological experiment?
see how that works.
okay.
you sure?
Yeah. No, you're not, but thank you for doing it.
I'll call you to tell you where we're gonna be.
okay. All right.
you were convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor.
doesn't mean I did anything to Kelly.
then why were you hiding out at your ex-wife's?
I knew what yoguys would think, but I'm reformed.
are you sure it wasn't because you knew we'd search your office?
this looked right into the girl's locker room.
pretty nice view for a pervert.
I've never seen that before. Look, man, you were clearly watching her, but that wasn't enough, was it, Wade?
I didn't touch her.
the two of you alone at night and you expect us to believe that you didn't try and take it beyond a peep show?
I'm not the one you should be looking for.
there's some sicko who's got it out for her.
what, there's another sicko? I'm serious.
someone was at the rink the other day.
wade: Hey, Kel.
Hey.
I been meaning to give something to you.
it's Jason's practice jersey.
I found it when I was cleaning out the equipment room.
thought you might like to have it.
Thanks.
he was a hell of a player.
good kid, too.
I should go get ready.
what the hell?
I was outside that door a half hour,
I didn't see anybody go in.
so who did Kelly think it was?
she was sure it was some other skater.
me kind of prank to psych her out.
why didn't you call the cops?
she begged me not to.
said it would just make things worse.
so conveniently, no one but you or Kelly can actuallyouch that any of this really happened?
ask the rat.
garbage pickup isn't till Tuesday.
it should still be in the Dumpster out back.
are you kidding me?
it was right where Wade said it would be.
unfortunately, they didn't find the head.
okay, please, I just ate lunch, so, good-bye.
are you sure you don't want to pay your respects before I take it to the lab? I'll pass.
don't even think about putting it there!
I have like 20 more tapes to watch.
get out. Relax.
who's the guy?
boyfriend?
no, that's Kelly's brother.
he's always the first one to greet her off the ice.
how we doing on our rat girl?
we have this girl named Mattie Porter, she usually places first or second against Kelly.
I can never get past those outfits-- look at that.
Really? Beuse I think you'd look cute in tights.
I didn't do this.
of course, you didn't.
Elena: Is there a reason
Kelly would think you did?
no.
we like each other, at least I thought so.
this is probably some ploy on Kelly's part.
I doubt that.
okay, do you have any idea who might have done it, then?
I don'think so.
Kelly could be in trouble...
serious trouble.
do you understand that?
so if you know something, you need to tell us.
it was kind of weird.
I saw Kelly a couple of weeks ago outside the rink.
Hey, Kelly.
you okay?
I'm fine.
who was that?
no one.
looked like someone to me.
just please, don't tell anybody about it, okay?
Elena: Okay, do you think you can help us with a sketch of this man?
sure.
how old do you think this guy was?
like my dad's age, I think.
Hey, Jack.
sorry.
Thanks.
you going up?
uh, no, no, I'll just, I'll, well,
I'll just ride with you.
I, uh, I changed my mind about tonight.
Why?
it's just, you know, Kate, she's only here for the weekend, and I don't want her to think that I'm taking your time away from her.
you're not, it's just dinner.
no, but we could be putting her in a very awkward situation, and...
I mean, what if she hates me?
she's not going to hate you. Well, she might.
don't you think that you should let her decide?
Mm-hmm.
okay? All right.
just relax. Okay.
parents didn't recognize the guy in the sketch.
did Mack get anything off of Kelly's computer?
no, so he's checking the school.
you know, she's constantly with adults
coaches, judges, parents of other kids.
this guy could be one of them.
Yeah, I mean, we got the sexual predator part right.
we just got the wrong one.
well, don't count out
I'm still double-checking his alibi.
all right, so I think I know who murdered Binky.
Binky? Who's Binky?
the rat. You named the rat?
no, Kelly's biology class did.
our lab determined that it wasn't a street rat based on the food pellets that they found in its stomach.
right, so how did Binky end up in Kelly's locker?
somebody brokento the class three days ago.
you have any suspects? Yeah, a kid named
Bobby Hillman-- he's a hockey player.
they caught him breaking in after hours.
we got him on a security tape.
nice work, Dan.
why were you trying to scare Kelly, Bobby?
I was't.
Oh, so the rat cut off its own head and hung itself from Kelly's locker?
suicidal rat, right?
I wouldn't do anything to hurt Kelly.
she's my girlfriend.
hmm. Any reason why no one else knows about this?
Jason and I were best friends.
after he died, Kelly and I became close.
we were worried what people would think.
hmm.
if you are her boyfriend, who's that?
I've never seen him before.
you know what I think?
I think you found out that your girl was cheating on you, and you wanted to scare her straight with the whole rat gag.
No! No?
VIVIAN: Bobby, we have fingerprints from the locker.
if we compare them with yours, what are we going to find?
the rat wasn't even my idea.
well, then, whose idea was it, Bobby?
it all started because I went to see her at the rink a few days ago.
guess who?
don't.
sorry.
it's just, my dad's gonna be here any second, and he could see.
what's that?
nothing.
Hey, can I ask you something?
before the accident, did Jason seem weird to you?
no.
what do you mean?
I guess it was just with me.
every time I tried to make him laugh, he just got annoyed.
it wasn't because of you, Kel.
how do you know?
he wasuicing.
no, my brother wouldn't use steroids.
he did, for over a year.
I don't know.
it must have been too long.
he started acting strange, like, really aggressive.
it explains why he was driving the way he did that night.
the Jason I knew would never have gotten in that accident.
the next day, she demanded to know where Jason got his steroids.
who was the dealer?
he's the school trainer.
so he got you to put the rat up there?
he wanted to freak Kelly out, so she wouldn't say anything about him dealing.
he threatened to cut me off, unless I did it.
what's his name?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Bobby told us the rat was your idea.
well, he's lying. Really?
is he lying about the, uh, the steroids, too?
Yeah, exactly.
so that's why half the hockey team told us that you sell them steroids? Come on, guys.
you got any real proof? SAMANTHA: Here's what I got.
I got a 15-year-old girl who found out about what you were doing, and now she's missing, so that's motive.
and I'm sure I can find someone who saw you together.
that gives you opportunity.
so why don't you start talking?
all right, look, it's simple.
I admit to the rat.
it was stupid.
it didn't even work.
what do you mean "didn't work"?
Kelly came by my office the other night all bent out of shape.
Hey, Ray.
Hey, what's up, Kelly?
I just got my new order of one-and-a-half-inch tape in.
huh?
help yourself.
how is the steroid business working out for you?
you know, roid rage and backn and all that stuff?
what do you want?
2000
what, do you got a prom dress to pay for or something?
that's none of your business.
you're not going to get a dime out of me.
then I'll go to the police.
then I'll take you down with me.
what did Jason tell you?
nothing.
but he doubled his order four months before he died, and I know it's not for anyone else on the team.
why don't you go get your money someplace else?
are you absolutely sure that Kelly was using steroids?
Yeah, she pulled her groin at the same time
Jason was asking for drugs, so... you do the math.
you have any idea what she needed the money for?
I could care less.
you have an alibi for Wednesday night?
Yeah, I do-- I was at the Firefly with some buddies having some drinks, and they'll vouch for me.
okay.
okay.
Danny: Where you going?
sit downman, we're not done with you.
Hey. Hey.
so Kelly's log-in generated a number of web searches from last month
planned Parenthood, Council on Teen Pregnancy.
the list goes on.
Wow.
well, if she's pregnant, it could be that she needed the money for an abortion.
I don't think Bobby Hillman's keeping any more secrets.
Yeah, but there's the middle-aged boyfriend, and maybe he didn't want it to get out ??
no, Kelly's period didn't stop because she was pregnant.
they stopped because Pete upped her training.
and what you found was probably from before we went to the doctor and figured it out.
Uh-huh.
where is your husband now?
Oh, he had a work emergency.
how long has he been gone?
I don't know. He left a note.
uh, do me a favor.
could you write your husband's work number down?
thank you.
um,
Mrs. McMurphy, we have information that, um, both your son and daughter may have been using steroids.
is that something that you or your husband might have encouraged?
I know that it's out there.
but I would never do anything to put my child's health at risk.
what about your husband?
no.
your daughter was looking for a substantial amount of money.
any idea why?
I think...
Kelly may have been trying to help me out.
Hey.
you're home.
what are you doing in my drawer?
uh, I was looking for a sock.
and I thought maybe it got mixed up in your laundry.
it probably just fell behind the dryer.
you're stealing from me?
no, I'm justoing to borrow it, 'cause I have to pick up the dry cleaning.
$400?
you know what? Just forget it. Just... It doesn't matter.
no. Mom, what is going on?
I think, uh...
I think that...
I think things just got a ttle screwed up after your brotheried.
what-what do you mean?
I've, uh...
I've-I'veeen...
it's okay, you can tell me.
I've been taking things from Mrs. Kaplan's boutique.
they said they won't press charges if I pay them back.
it's going to be okay.
I just really miss him.
I know.
I know. So do I.
Jack: How much money do you owe?
a thousand.
I just spoke with your husband's workplace.
he's not there, and apparently, there is no work emergency.
dad!
Hey, sweetie.
how are you?
good.
Where's your mother and your sister?
they had to get to... the theater.
Oh.
how is Hanna?
she scored two goals last week.
she wantede to tell you, even though she's going to see you herself tomorrow.
and how's your mother?
good.
she works too much.
uh, listen, I wanted to ask you if, um, would you mind if I brought a friend to dinner.
can it be Danny?
Danny isn't exactly who I had in mind.
Yeah.
I'd like you to get to know her better.
sure.
dad?
you like Ann, right?
Yes, I do.
mom took hers off a long time ago.
Yeah, I noticed.
so why don't you take yours off, too?
I don't know. I...
I think I just left it on for you and your sister.
thank you.
try to get that high score.
you kn where to find me if you need me.
okay.
any word on McMurphy?
no, but I checked with some of the parents, and apparently,
McMurphy was banned from Jas's hockey games for fighting.
one guy ended up with stitches.
the guy press charges?
no, but one witness saw McMurphy getting really rough with Jason after he played badly in a big game.
maybe he was doing the same thing to Kelly, and then she took off.
maybe he's trying to find her first so that she doesn't talk about the abuse.
excuse me.
Uh-huh.
I got it.
right? Okay, thanks.
someone at the hotel in Poughkeepsie saw Kelly this morning with one of the guests-- a Linus Newell.
check it out.
looks like our guy in the sketch. It sure does.
this is it. All right.
could you give me the key, please?
stand back. Mr. Newell, this is the FBI.
open. Come on.
Oh. Clear.
it's clear.
are you sure he didn't check out?
he was here five minutes ago.
he's right there. Come on. Let's go.
Freeze! Freeze!
are you Linus Newell?
get out of the car!
Elena, check the trunk!
get out. Come here. I said get out.
all right, where's Kelly?
I don't know.
what did you do to her? Nothing, I swear.
look, this is a misunderstanding.
since when is having sex with a minor a misunderstanding?
no. This isn't about sex.
no? What's it about?
I was just trying to convince her to take me on as a coach, that's it.
okay, a witness saw you consoling her outside the rink two weeks ago.
was that part of the sales pitch?
no. No, no, no. She was a mess about her brother.
she needed someone to talk to. DANNY: Talk to?
I'm starting my own camp in Lake Placid.
that's why she came here to see me.
are you okay, Kelly?
Yeah, I'm great.
I... I'm just really anxious about this decision, I guess.
all right, well, let's talk about it.
so, if you coach me,
I can stay at your camp in Lake Placid, like, full-time?
like, live there, right?
that's how we'd arrange it, yeah.
provided your parents are on board.
you-you did talk to your dad, right?
Yeah, he's okay with it.
so, when can we go?
where are your parents, Kelly?
Oh, they couldn't come, but they did sign the nsent forms that you sent.
I still have to speato them.
is this about the deposit?
because I thought maybe we could work out some kind of payment plan, or...
I don't know.
I could pay you in some other way.
what the hell's going on here?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
I just really need you to coach me.
that's not what this is about.
I'm saying yes.
that's what you wanted, right?
Yeah, but not under these circumstances.
so, what, are you saying that I can't go with you?
look, there's something going on with you you're not telling me about.
I can't coach you if you're not honest with me.
I'm sorry.
I called her dad. Mm-hmm.
he accused me of-of trying to steal his daughter.
he threatened to kill me. ELENA: When was this?
a couple hours ago. DANNY: Why'd you wait a whole day to call him?
I wanted to give her a chance to work it out with him.
but when he didn't call, I figured I should.
two hours ago would make it 4: 00.
that's right before McMurphy went to go look for his daughter.
come on, let's go.
come on, come on.
all right, so I confirmed Newell's story.
he called McMurphy's cell phone at 4: 00 p. m.
Mr. McMurphy.
what happened to your hand?
I cut it.
how?
on a glass.
were you drinking?
no.
it was water.
I got pissed off when that jackass Newell called.
Yes, I heard that you threatened Newell.
you must have been equally furious with your daughter.
I would never hurt Kelly.
then why'd she run away?
Mr. McMurphy, your daughter blackmailed the steroid dealer, then she tried to prostitute herself to get away from you.
why is that?
you molesting her?
No!
then why did she go?
it's a family matter.
not anymore it's not.
look, Mr. McMurphy, if you've seen anything, if you've done anything and you're not telling me, it's obstruction.
do you want to find your daughter or not?
something happened this afternoon.
I thought you wanted to quit.
I guess you just wanted to kick me in the head.
dad, I should have told you.
Yeah, but instead, you ran away.
your mom and I have been worried sick about you!
half the FBI is looking for you!
I'm sorry.
sorry?
do you honestly believe someone can coach you better than your own father?
no.
then what the hell is this all about?
if I had one-tenth of the talent you had,
I wouldn't be pissing it all away!
I couldn't stand being around here anymore!
Why?
because of what happened to Jason.
what does Jason's accident have to do with any of this?
did you know that he was using steroids?
that's ridiculous.
no, it's not.
he gave them to me when I got injured.
he told me that he wasn't taking them himself, but he lied.
he had been using them for over a year.
Jasowould never take steroids.
it's because of you!
because of the way that you pushed him!
they screwed him up.
he killed himself, Dad.
where the hell do you get off saying that?
I found this in his room.
kelly: I was looking for music for my competition.
this doesn't prove anything.
it's just words on paper.
think about how he was before he died.
he didn't even leave it somewhere we could find it.
because he didn't want us to blame ourselves, even though it was all our fault.
our fault?
how? Ming him die in a car accident?
the car didn't just drive off the road by itself.
you know, I'm not talking to you about this! Getut!
you hear me?! Get out!
I know I shouldn't have let her go.
no, probably not.
please, you've got to find her.
you could have helped me if you'd called as soon as you'd seen her.
I didn't know how to explain without Joanie knowing the truth.
she'll never forgive herself.
she'll never forgive me.
you'll have to stay here until I can corroborate the story.
all right, she gets rejected by Newell, her father kicks her out of the house.
where would she go?
where she's supposed to be, the New York Invitational?
no, I don't think she's in the mood for skating.
wait a second.
what?
her parents talked about this pond, some pond where her brother first taught her to skate.
somewhere out in White Plains.
SAMANTHA: All right, why don't you come with me?
you, let's go this way.
SAMANTHA: I've got her!
Kelly, my name is Samantha Spade.
I'm with the FBI.
we've been looking for you.
do I have to go home now?
it's late, and your parents are worried about you.
you really don't want to go home, do you?
I just never want to skate again.
I rew my skates in there.
I don't know, maybe it's stupid.
but I think Jason would have liked that.
you know something, I, um...
I don't think it's stupid at all.
the night he died.
and I wouldn't listen.
chin. Good.
chin. Yes.
good. Good!
mcmurphy: I still think we need to work on the spiral.
my legs are killing me from the lunges yesterday.
I can't get my leg around.
we'll get the heating pads out tonight, you'll be good as new, all right?
Hey, Jas.
Hey. Hey.
what's up?
just figured I'd stop by on my way home.
is everything okay?
Yeah.
come on, Jay.
I don't know, I...
I've just been feeling down.
you want to talk about it?
got to go.
I guess now's not a good time.
wait, Jason.
it's nothing, really.
I...
there's just a lot of stuff gng on.
well, we can talk after dinner.
Yeah.
that sounds good.
later.
come on, got to go.
you're doing great. Doing great.
mcmurphy: Keep it up.
what happened to your brother is not your fault.
can we just stay a minute?
sure.
Hi. Sorry we're late.
no problem.
everything all right?
Yeah.
uh, Kate, this is Ann.
Jack: Ann, Kate.
Hi. How do you do?
we met a long time ago, actually.
it was at a party your parents had once.
but you were much smaller then.
I'm sorry that your husband got shot.
Oy.
no, no, no.
thank you very much, Kate. Thank you.
shall we sit?
Yeah.
and you thought dinner was going to be awkward for her?
are you drinking tonight?
Oh, yeah.
to the brim.
want something to drink?
um... I guess I'll have a...
what? Sprite.
sprite? Sprite.
911. What's your emergency?
my arm.
I think I'm having a heart attack.
ems is five minutes out, Mr. Matheson. Is anyone there with you?
no, no, it's just me.
somebody smashed the window and there's glass all over the floor.
is the intruder still in the house?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, Ma'am, this is 911, not 411.
I cannot give you directions to best buy.
how far apart are your contractions?
the fire department is just a couple of blocks away.
I can't open the window! It's painted over, and...
Mrs. Emmerson, can you safely exit the apartment some other way?
the smoke and fire, it - it's everywhere. I can't see anything.
okay, I want you and your kids to get down on the floor, under the smoke and see if there's some other way for you to get out.
Julie, oh, my god! Julie, no!
Mrs. Emmerson?
the fire department is on the scene.
can you put something bright in the window so they can find you?
no, no, Julie!
Mrs. Emmerson?
can anyone hear me?
dispatch? This is operator 7829.
I lost contact with the Staten Island fire.
Hey. Oh, I didn't mean to startle you.
someone's asking fbebeou on the emergency line number eight.
is it the Staten Island fire?
no, it's a man, but he won't give his name.
do you want me to dump it?
uh, no, I'll take it.
okay. 911. What's your emergency?
who is this?
listen, you can't call me on this line.
all right, I am hanging up. And if you ever call me again Jessica Lawson, 27, got a call from a man who asked for her by name.
coworkers say she was pretty upset.
she took a break and nobody's seen her since.
this is Tom Noles, her supervisor.
he's pulling up the call for us.
who called it in?
a coworker by the name of Paulette Harrison.
she transferred the call to Jessica.
I'm told this guy knew her name.
any chance the call was personal?
not on the emergency line.
and not Jess.
nobody took this job more seriously.
most people last only a couple years, but Jess, she was still going strong after five.
maybe she finally burned out.
I got the call.
911. What's your emergency?
you think you can get away with this?
who is this? - You little bitch.
listen, you can't call me on this line.
you think I'm going to let you screw around with my life, Jessica?
all right, I am hanging up. And if you ever call me again...
when I find you, you're dead, too...
you got a location on that?
Yeah, it came from J&Q technologies on Stanton Island.
no extension.
I'll get Danny on it. - Would you play that again?
when I find you, you're dead, too.
when I find you, you're dead, too.
when I find you, you're dead, too.
when I find you, you're dead, too.
he asked for her, I asked who it was, but he wouldn't give me his name.
now, tell me, how do you think he knew Jessica's name?
I mean, don't you normally use an operator number to identify yourself?
Yeah, they give us numbers, but sometimes when a person's freaking out, using our name helps calm them down.
did you recognize his voice?
no, but there was a guy yesterday outside the office.
he came looking for her.
there's nothing I could do then.
ten minutes for a java run. I hope there's no line.
I know. - Jessica?
Jessica? - Yeah?
I just wanted you to see her face.
you kept me on hold for five minutes!
remember?
my wife died while we wait for the ambulance to arrive.
I'm really sorry. - You said it was on the way!
don't touch me! - Her name was Janey!
let go! - Help! Help!
are you all right?
with all the stuff we hear, it takes a lot to rattle a 911 operator.
but I guess it's different when someone's right in your face.
all right. And you're sure he said "Janey"?
Yes.
okay. Now, did you see him hanging around later?
no, but do you think he came back and tried to...?
now, did Jessica ever mention the call that this person was referring to?
no.
we answer a few hundred calls a day.
I mean, sometimes there aren't enough operators, and the computer puts the calls on hold.
what happened, it wasn't Jessica's fault.
Hey, the super says she's been living here for six years, always pays on time, doesn't cause any trouble.
apparently, has a thing with building security, and gets really, really upset if any of the residents blocks the front door open.
might explain why she has such a big dog in a little apartment.
well, where's the dog?
Cooper's dead. He was killed three days ago.
I wish she'd come, stayed at my apartment.
maybe this wouldn't have happened.
and how was the dog killed?
someone broke into her apartment and beat him to death.
apparently, your daughter never filed a police report.
of course she did.
we had the police department run her name through their records.
nothing came up.
how did you find out about the dog?
well, I hadn't spoken to her in about a week, and then suddenly in the middle of the night the phone rings.
yes? - Mom?
Jessica? What's wrong?
somebody killed him.
who?
I got home and he's just...
he's just...
honey, are you sure they're gone?
they're not still in your apartment?
he's just lying here on the floor.
they beat him.
honey, how did they get in?
did they - did they break in the door?
did they come through the window?
I don't know.
sweetheart, did you call the police?
no.
all right, then you have to hang up right now and call them.
he looks so small.
what am I going to do now?
honey, honey, I know you're upset, but I need you to call the police right now, okay?
okay.
I called her back and said I was coming over, but she told me not to, said the police were coming.
now, besides the super and Jessica, who else has access to her apartment?
I don't know.
now, why do you think she lied to you about calling the police?
must have been about work.
why do you say that?
because it's the one thing we can't talk about.
Jessica was pre-med at Columbia when she got the internship at the call center.
and the next thing I know, she's dropping out of school to become an operator.
I made it clear I didn't approve.
and she never gave you a reason for dropping out?
Oh, I think she just got caught up in...
helping people.
Hey. - Hey.
did you find anything in her apartment?
that she doesn't have much of a social life.
all right, I'm going to go and...
wait a second, come here, come here.
do you know that we never talked about what happened...?
Yes, I was there. I know what happened, yeah.
it was weird, huh? - A little.
okay, so I just want to make sure that you're okay with how the whole thing went down?
we were just doing our job.
okay, so me dressing like a stripper and making out with you, it's just doing our job?
I'm cool. - Okay, I'm cool, too.
Yeah, but I'm super cool. - I'm super cool, too.
okay.
how'd you do at J&Q technologies?
well, I haven't been able to make a connection between the employees and our missing person.
is there a guy by the name of Nathan Kelly working there?
let me see.
he's not an employee, but they do a lot of outsourcing. Why?
I found out that he's the guy that confronted jessica at the call center.
911. What's your emergency?
my wife, she's having an allergic reaction.
okay, sir, are you at 225 Richmond Avenue?
Yes, yes! Please, you've got to hurry! She can't breathe!
an ambulance is on its way. Is your wife conscious?
I've looked everywhere for an epipen, but I can't find any!
why don't we have any?
I'm not sure what to do - it's been a long time since she...
since she stopped breathing. Should I... should I...
okay, sir, my name is Jessica, and I'm going to get you some help but I need you to calm down, okay?
I told you, she can't breathe!
ems is three minutes away.
I already waited five minutes!
Janey? Oh, my god, she let go of my hand.
Janey? Baby, wake up.
sounds like his wife died before the ambulance got there.
which makes him a great suspect, but I don't think he's the guy that called and threatened jessica at work.
you doing a voice print?
in the process.
and Kelly's on his way in - so I guess I'll ask him.
I told you, I don't know where she is.
the only time I saw the girl was at the call center.
Mr. Kelly, no one was in control of your wife's death.
I would have been pissed off, too.
you confronting her like that was an overt act of hostility, and it's more than enough to hang you with an assault charge.
I was devastated when my wife died.
I wanted to kill that operator.
after I confronted her,
I waited, and I followed her when she came out.
it's ridiculous... oh, God! What the hell?!
I'm sorry. - Idiot!
why are you following me?!
what do you want?
why don't you just leave me alone!
stay away from me!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! We got a problem here, man?
no.
no problem.
good. Why don't you just keep walking.
when she started hitting me,
I saw how scared and vulnerable she was.
it was like looking into my wife's eyes when she died.
so I went home.
is there anyone that can actually verify that you went home and what time you got there?
my son's baby-sitter.
Mr. Kelly, did you see which way Jessica went after your ordeal?
no.
and where were you when she first got out of the cab?
I think it was the corner of 47th and 6th.
well, I-I can't find any credit cards that would explain what she was doing in that neighborhood.
well, not everything I do can be explained by visa.
wait...
did you say 47th and 6th?
Yeah.
you know, three days before she went missing, she handled a call about a shooting on that corner.
that can't be a coincidence that she went back there, right?
Nope.
Yes, of course I remember her.
so, what'd she do that made her so memorable?
it's what she didn't do, actually.
well, we can guess, but it'd be much faster if you'd tell us what happened.
she asked to use the bathroom. I said okay.
I'm going downstairs to get more tape for the credit machine.
you watch up front.
what are you doing here? This is private property.
sorry, I thought it was the bathroom.
after all that mess...
she didn't steal anything.
what do you keep back there?
uh, excess inventory, items for repair, my business records.
what about your money, where'd you keep that?
in my safe.
Hey, look, there was a shooting out front four days ago,
you know anything about it?
Yeah. I heard about that. We were closed.
it's... very sad.
Yeah. All right, Mr. Ruben, thanks for your time.
anytime.
you know, it feels like she's gone past her expiration date.
the pressure at work, her dog being killed.
I mean, maybe she just flipped out.
Yeah, well, she had to have a reason to trash the place.
she was looking for something, but did she find it?
you know, maybe she did.
Mr. Ruben, uh, the security camera out front, does that work?
Yes. - Okay, where do you keep the tapes?
in my office.
I keep the old ones for a week, and then I use them again.
uh... wha-what day?
Saturday.
it's not here.
Hey, what's up?
we found the store's surveillance tape at Jessica's apartment.
it's of a woman by the name of Amy Wahlberg getting killed.
any connection to our missing person?
none that we know of.
we're synching up the tape now with the 911 call.
here we go.
911. What's your emergency?
uh, my name is Dr. Jeremy Burton.
I'm at the corner of 47th and 6th.
I got a woman here with a... a gsw to the chest.
doesn't appear to be a through-and-through.
you're a doctor?
Yes, Ma'am, I am.
I'm losing air out of the entry wound. She might have a pneumothorax.
Hello? Are you still there?
uh, yes, sir.
I am sending a unit to you now.
is the assailant still on the scene?
uh, no.
I think he might have ran north down 6th.
okay. Um, ems is just around the corner.
PD is one minute out.
okay, they should take her to St. Martin's hospital.
they got the best trauma center in this part of town.
I will alert the E. R. That you are on the way.
Oh, here they come, Ma'am. They're here. Thank you so much.
and that's it for the call.
can we get a clearer shot of the mugger's face?
male in his 30s, a tattoo on his neck.
any chance nypd picked him up?
well, they've got a very good description from one of the bystanders, but they haven't identified him yet.
we got a pop on some prints from jessica's apartment.
meet Alejandro Mendoza.
he is a former bronx tigres, and he's the main suspect in the murder of a rival gang member.
nice tattoos.
who's she? - The woman you killed.
what?
I didn't kill anybody. - We got it on tape.
is that right? - Yeah, that's right.
you don't remember? It was four nights ago.
no, he was probably too out of it. Right?
I don't touch the stuff.
what about Jessica Lawson's dog?
did Jessica say I did something to him?
we'd love to ask her, but unfortunately she's missing.
and your prints are all over her apartment.
we're friends.
so how do A 911 operator and a gangbanger get to be friends?
because I don't understand.
I decided to go a different way.
now I work at my uncle's botanica.
that's how I met Jess. She came in looking for spiritual protection.
um... what did she need spiritual protection from?
Jess seems... sort of broken.
you know how some people are.
how did you know about the dog?
she called me the other night, asked me to come over to help with his body.
I'm going to get him.
get who?
the guy who did this.
he's not gonna get away with it.
you know who killed cooper?
Jess, if you know, you need to call the police.
Why? So that they can arrest him and then he gets out on bail?
no, I'll take care of him.
didn't you feel better when your friends killed the guy who shot you?
it didn't make any difference. - I don't believe you.
how was killing that Cholo supposed to change anything?
he's dead, and I'm still a cripple.
are you sure you're okay?
I'll be fine.
you should come stay with me tonight.
I'll meet you downstairs.
she was pretty messed up. I'm not sure she slept all night.
and she never mentioned who did it?
no.
my guess is, whoever she called from my place the next morning.
they were arguing.
about what? - Cooper.
she saw me listening and shut the door.
I couldn't hear anything after that.
why didn't you ask her about it later?
I jumped in the shower, and when I came out, she was gone.
Mrs. Worth, why were you arguing with Jessica Lawson on the telephone on monday?
I don't know what you're talking about.
our phone records say that she called you, and we have a witness that overheard the argument.
well, I didn't speak to Jessica.
Oh, this is... this is Sue's number.
this is my sister.
why is your sister's phone in your name?
well, she doesn't have a phone of her own, so I put her on my wireless account last year.
is Jessica with her now?
I spoke to Sue this morning. She didn't mention it.
how do they know each other?
they live a block apart.
sue loves Jessica's dog so she walks him when jessica has to work late.
any idea what they've been arguing about?
well, Jessica's helping Sue.
she's trying to anyway.
when's he coming home? - Around 6: 00.
then we better get out of here.
let's go.
maybe I'm overreacting.
look in the mirror, Sue.
I'm sure that if I just talk to him we can work it out, and I know he feels worse than I do.
it isn't enough to feel bad about it.
Frank loves me.
no, Frank loves abusing you.
Hey, what's going on?
you didn't tell me we had company.
Jess just stopped by to say hi.
Oh. You taking a trip, honey?
she's gonna stay with me for a couple of days.
let's go.
I should've thrown your ass out the first time you came here.
yeah? While why don't you try now?
sue might not call the police, but I will.
come on. - Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
stay away from her.
she actually got her out of there for a couple of nights.
why only a couple?
you know...
she can't live without him any more than he can live without her.
after a couple days apart, he turns on the charm.
he makes a bunch of promises that she forgets he's made before.
they say some girls marry their fathers.
you think I'm going to let you screw around with my life, Jessica?
Yeah, that's him. That's him.
can you write down his address?
sit.
we're clear!
I'll get the paramedic.
you okay?
I'm Jack Malone from the FBI.
you able to talk? - Yeah.
who did this to you?
we're looking for Jessica Lawson.
you know where she is?
no.
I'm fine, really. I just... I tripped.
Really? How many times?
Jessica Lawson is missing.
I know you're trying to protect your husband, but we think he had something to do with it.
Jessica's fine.
and how do you know that?
Frank will be back in a little while and he'll tell you.
Yeah, we have agents posted on both corners.
I'll call you back.
Hey, man, what happened to your hand?
I know you? - Yeah, you're frank, right?
Yeah, who are you? - FBI. Against the wall.
what's this, a dog bite?
you better get that checked out. Now where's Jessica Lawson?
I don't know. I don't know!
let's go.
you can't arrest frank. He didn't do anything.
between your sister and the dog bite,
I got more than enough evidence to arrest your husband.
I don't need your testimony.
and if you don't tell me what happened to jessica,
I'm going to have you arrested for obstruction of justice.
it was me.
I swear.
just kept pushing and pushing, and she was making everything worse, not better.
and I just wanted... I wanted her to stop.
did you give him my key? My alarm code?
how could you do that, sue? I trusted you.
you don't have any proof it was him.
your husband bashed my dog's head in and left him bleeding on my floor.
Frank wouldn't do that. - Why not?
he's done it to you ten times before.
you don't know what you're talking about.
I talk to women like you every day.
their husbands knock them around, but they say, "he didn't mean it" or,"he works too hard,"
or "maybe they deserved it."
you'll just keep making excuses for him until he kills you.
I'm done talking to you.
you think I don't know what I'm talking about, but I do.
back in college, someone hurt me.
I remember how he hurt me.
I couldn't tell the police either, like it was my fault somehow.
and I still wake up at night and he's right there. I feel him.
and I'm always afraid that he'll hurt me again.
well, then why don't you go deal with that...
and leave us alone.
I never should have listened to her in the first place.
it sounds to me like she was trying to help.
does this look like she's helping?
when we were packing for my sister's, she took something that belonged to my husband.
What'd she take?
his gun.
she made things worse and now you people are doing the same.
I just... why can't you just leave us alone?
it's a little late for that.
okay. Well, thanks very much.
according to his boss at J&Q technologies, were setting up a network the morning that Jessica disappeared.
hmm, then we have to make sure that the dog-killing felony sticks.
listen, I think I know why jessica dropped out of college.
her junior year, she was treated for lacerations on her head, neck, chest, and she had cuts all over her hands.
an assault?
did she file a report? - She refused to file one.
maybe she was covering for someone.
you know, it might explain why she was so desperate to help that sue woman.
she knows what it feels like to be abused.
this one here is Derek Hudson.
he's the one that took her to the health center.
now, according to the report, he's listed as a boyfriend.
I haven't seen jessica since we broke up and I moved out.
was that before or after she left school?
before.
why did she drop out?
I don't know. - You don't know?
you sure about that?
you see, you took her into the university health center six years ago.
she took a pretty bad beating.
I know. - Did you do it?
of course not.
she had defensive wounds.
what, did she try and fight back and you hit her harder?
what?
she didn't report it to the police
maybe too scared to tell them what you did to her.
no, I didn't do anything.
I loved Jessica.
I thought we were going to be married.
but after that night, everything changed.
Oh, my God. Jess, what happened?
I'm fine.
baby, what happened?
I was at that med-pro recruitment event tonight.
and some of us, um...
we got, went and got some drinks after.
there are all these doctors and research scientists there tonight.
they're so smart.
I don't think I'll ever be that smart.
well, why don't you sit down? Let me get you some water.
I guess I didn't eat enough today, 'cause the alcohol hit me really hard.
so, um, well, then, when this one guy offered to give me a ride home,
I said okay.
Oh, my god, Jess.
he drove to some docks.
and I couldn't get away.
I was screaming, but nobody could hear me.
he kept hitting me.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I tried.
I swear that I tried to get away.
what's his name?
I don't... I don't know.
what's his name? Tell me his name! - I don't know!
just...
Oh, God.
Jess, I'm sor...
Jess, come on. please, I'm sorry.
please, open up the door.
I just couldn't stand that someone did that to her.
when did she go to the hospital?
a few hours later.
but it was too late.
she'd washed away all the evidence.
she wouldn't even tell them she was raped.
did she tell you anything about her attacker?
only that he had light hair and a southern accent.
I need to see that surveillance tape again.
hold a sec.
and... there's your perp. - No, keep going.
there.
Hello, are you there?
Yes, sir, I am sending a unit to you now.
is the assailant still on the scene?
no. I don't see him. I think he ran north down sixth.
freeze when he turns around.
she wasn't looking for the mugger.
she was looking for the man who raped her.
Dr. Jeremy burton.
Yeah. I need to know which hospital he's working at.
well, he's got a local cell phone, so I'm thinking probably the tristate.
Yes, it's urgent.
Burton called the 911 four days ago.
listen, why do you think she waited six years before going after this guy?
I don't know.
maybe it got to the point where she had no choice.
okay, thanks.
according to AMA, burton's a vascular surgeon at St. Andrews, but they also said that we're not the only ones who have been looking for him.
let's go.
whoa, whoa, whoa. This is for emergencies only.
Hey, you can't park here.
agents Johnson and Fitzgerald, FBI.
what's going on?
we're looking for Dr. Burton.
he just got his car a little while ago.
was he with this woman?
Yeah, they just left.
she had been waiting for him by the exit.
ma'am, if you need to make an appointment you can call my office.
I am not sick. I can't believe that you don't remember me.
I don't know what to tell you.
I guess that special time that we spent together didn't mean that much to a guy like you.
I really think you might have me confused with somebody else.
come on! Med-pro six years ago.
ma'am, I'm very sorry, but I don't know who you are.
I'm sorry.
get in the car.
did you happen to see which way they were headed?
they turned right out of the structure. That's all I saw.
thanks for your help.
if he got into the car without a struggle, she must have had the gun.
what make is his car?
if it's thlatest model, it's got to have GPS.
let's hope so.
Viv, you there? - Yeah, any luck?
Yeah, Burton's GPS is giving us a location.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.
what's in Jersey?
Jessica told Derek Hudson that she was raped on the docks.
port Elizabeth.
Yeah. Now, I also looked into the med-pro conference.
Burton wasn't even there.
he was in Malawi on a doctors without borders mission, but there was another guy, a Dr. Rose.
three years ago, he was arrested for sexual assault in maine.
can we get a picture? - I'll fax it over.
ma'am, I swear to you, I didn't do it.
Yes, you did do it! It was right here!
don't lie to me!
please.
I have a family!
I have a little boy.
FBI. Drop the gun.
he raped me.
Jessica. Put the gun down. You have the wrong guy.
that's what I keep telling her. - Shut up!
Jessica. I know you want justice.
and you deserve it.
but this is not the man that hurt you.
you're wrong. - We looked into it.
Dr. Burton was out of the country in March 2000.
please. I'm begging you.
please, just stop her.
I just want him to admit what he did to me.
but he can't, because he didn't do it.
I know its hard for you to believe me.
he did it.
but if you're going to shoot him, you want to be sure, right?
besides the southern accent, what else do you remember?
I don't know. - Come on, Jessica, anything.
what color was his hair?
how tall was he? How fat?
I don't remember.
what about the crease in his pants?
the pattern on his shirt?
please.
all right.
I'm going to show you something, okay?
now, I've got the picture of a man, and I want you to tell me if you recognize him.
I'm going to put my gun away, and I'm going to bring it over there for you.
now, did the man who raped you have a scar above his eye?
Dr. Burton doesn't have a scar above his eye.
not that I can see, anyway.
that's Dr. Rose.
he was at the med-pro conference as well, but now he's in prison for raping another woman.
I was so sure it was him.
I know.
the door was kicked in, there's blood on the floor.
three people missing.
still smells like gunpowder.
who are we looking for? - Sadik Marcu.
he runs a gang of Albanians.
Where's the Giordano family? - I don't know.
I probably wouldn't tell you if I did.
I heard that you put a hit out on that kid.
you're full of a lot of accusations, Mr. Malon but I'm guessing not a lot of proof.
otherwise we wouldn't be talking like this, right?
we need to find the Giordanos before Sadik does.
you think because there are rules I have to follow that you don't have to fear me.
I don't care about the rules.
you stay away from that family, or I will put a bullet in your brain.
Hey, where you going? Come here.
mom, stop it! Stop it, mom.
what, I don't get any hugs anymore?
not now, I'm busy.
Oh, you're busy? Well, how about you get busy getting ready for bed, because it's bedtime.
daddy!
Hey, rabbit.
you ready for bed?
no, I've got all this stupid reading to do.
Hey, reading's not stupid.
how else you going to know anything?
you got to be smart if you're going to go far.
okay, I'll do it.
good boy. Are you going to take care of your mom while I'm gone?
you're the man of the house.
good show.
all right.
lock up behind me.
officer...
make sure she doesn't get back in here, will ya?
11 hours missing what's going on?
we got Petros Marku, eight, Julia Martique, 27. Both abducted last night.
Petros is Sadik's son?
Mm-hmm and Julia is his girlfriend.
and he has a wife, Odetta.
Jack, um, did NYPD ask us to be here?
because I-I'm not getting a very warm welcome.
well, I have a friend in the one-six that gives me a heads up when ever Sadik's around.
so we're not invited.
the Giordano family is in the witness protection program.
as long as Sadik's around, we're invited.
is this about nailing Sadik or finding a mother and her kid?
who called in the 911?
a neighbor. His name is Paul Banks.
Mr. Banks. Jack Malone, FBI.
so what did you see last night?
well, it was what I heard at first.
Julia let out a horrible scream around 10: 00.
why did you wait until almost 11: 00 to call 911?
well, everyone knows Sadik is a member of the Albanian mob.
I call the cops, I better have a pretty damn good reason.
and that reason would be what?
well, I took Mookie out a little after I heard Julia, and that was, that was when I knew it was really serious.
Oh, god...!
No...!
I-I couldn't really get a clear look at anybody.
anybody else around?
maybe in a car, I don't know.
did you get a plate number?
Yeah, first two letters, f-H.
that's really all I know.
okay. Thank you.
Oh, um, detective Pappas, says he's on a special team investigating Sadik.
Yeah, I know.
he says this is his case.
where you going?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
what are you deaf or just disrespectful?
disrespectful.
Frankie. Easy.
say hello to agent Malone.
do you have any idea where your son is?
what's it to you?
where were you last night?
minding my own business.
why are we having this conversation?
because I stayed away from the Giordanos.
your girlfriend and your son are missing.
Oh, come on, what are you talking about? I was just there last night.
that's what their place looked like this morning. Take a look.
if you're calling your girlfriend, you're wasting your time.
it's going to go straight to voice mail.
no one is available right now.
you and you, come with me. - Where are you going?
I'm going to go check on my family. - I don't think so.
all right, everybody take a nice, deep, relaxing breath.
a felon with a weapon.
it's not your lucky day.
want tell your boys to put their guns down?
call Cohen.
let's go.
13 Hours Missing
agent Malone.
what the hell are you doing here?
look, I told your partner I'd be handling this case.
with two people missing, we think it's a better fit for us.
you're stepping on an ongoing investigation.
I'll watch where I put my feet.
come on, man, look, we've been on Sadik for six months.
if he knows feds are around he and his people just close up shop.
look, I'm not going to let a woman and her son twist in the wind because you want to make a collar.
Oh, maybe because you want to bust him yourself, is that it?
cause I know you've got a jones for this guy.
I'll tell you what.
you keep me in the loop, and I'll keep you in the loop.
Yeah, right.
so Sadik hasn't said anything? - No.
well, NYPD has linked his crew to two gang killings in the last month.
an Izzy Sandoval and a Ricardo Reed, both beaten to death with a pipe.
who's got the biggest beef?
latin kings, 118th street gang, the Bonnano family,
I don't think we should be working this case, vivian.
Oh, come on. - I'm serious.
this kid and his mom would be better off if Jack would let detective Pappas do his job.
he knows this world better. He knows the players.
what?
Julia called Shadik's wife an hour before
who does such a thing?
he's so innocent.
let's talk about Julia.
your husband has a child with another woman while he's married to you.
I imagine that's got to make you pretty angry.
you think I took them away? That's crazy. You're crazy.
why did Julia call you on your cell phone an hour before they disappeared?
I was just talking to her about dinner.
I told her we were making casserole.
I'm sorry, you were going to make a casserole for your husband's girlfriend?
no, the whole family, Sadik, too, every Tuesday.
and you're telling us that, uh, your husband having this girlfriend doesn't even make you a little jealous?
it's how things are.
it was difficult at first.
but then Petros was born.
he brought joy to Sadik.
he brought Julia and I closer.
now you're just one big happy family.
I don't expect you to understand.
okay, uh, was Sadik having trouble with any rivals, other gang members, anything like that?
I just work in club. I only know Sadik's men.
okay, why don't you tell me about his men.
they are like dogs in the yard.
they all want to be the next Sadik.
some of them are less patient than others.
anyone specific? Can you give us a name?
Artie Lazzaro. He's one of the new guys.
it's not fair.
all the other kids got a chocolate bar.
Oh, she just forgot. Your teacher will give you one tomorrow, Petros.
sweetie, it's okay you didn't get one.
wait a minute-- what do you mean it's okay?
what are you trying to teach this kid, Julia?
listen.
it's not okay that you didn't get your candy.
right? It's not fair.
the world isn't always fair.
which is why sometimes you have to take what's yours.
you understand?
I got this from a nun at an orphanage when I was feeling forgotten.
now, you know I'm always thinking of you.
Hey, boss.
I just delivered the case of wine you wanted.
I put it in the cabinet by the fridge.
how'd you get in there? - I used the clicker from the car.
you broke in their house? Into their house?
no, I didn't break in. I just grabbed it out of your car.
get your ass back to the club, you understand me?
I was just trying to do what Frankie told me to do.
you don't do what Frankie tells you to do. You do what I tell you to do, you understand?
I'sorry, Mr.Marku.
I guess I wasn't thinking. It won't happen again.
get out of here.
at first, I didn't think anything of it, but now I wonder.
you think a low-level guy like this would go up against your husband?
that's how they prove themselves.
that's how Sadik came up.
sorry to keep you waiting. - No, you're not.
Where's julia? Where's my son?
I don't have a clue.
who took 'em?
why don't you tell me.
you think I had something to do with this?
I would rather die than hurt my son, you understand?
he's my flesh and blood.
any problems between you and Julia?
you're trying to hang this on me.
I'm going to hang this on whoever did it.
that's such crap.
you brought me in here on a bogus weapons charge, so that you can build a case against me.
I brought you in here because I knew that you wouldn't talk in front of your crew.
you think I'm going to talk now?
I think under the circumstances it's not a bad idea.
look, my job is to find Julia and your son.
the fact that I think that you're a piece of garbage is irrelevant.
whoever took them waited until you left.
there's been no ransom call, so it's not about the money.
now, someone is sending you a message.
any idea who it is?
is this some kind of payback?
does it have anything to do with Ricardo Reed or Izzy Sandoval?
what about your crew?
is anybody climbing up the ladder looking to knock you off your perch?
I see what you're trying to do.
I'm trying to find out who your enemies are.
I'm asking exactly the same questions I would ask anybody in your situation.
you're trying to get me sent away.
well, that's the chance that you're going to have to take.
what's more imptant to you, running your crew or finding your son?
if I were you, I would pick one.
send my lawyer up when he gets here, please.
sure.
I can do that.
Hey, Danny, do me a favor, will you?
call his lawyer and tell him we're going to send Sadik to central jail.
well, are we?
look, I'm trying to buy a little time here.
okay.
Yes. Artie.
the guy's a little green, maybe, but he's not stupid enough to cross Sadik.
when was the last time you saw him?
yesterday.
where is he now?
I don't know. It's not my day to watch him.
aren't you guys overlooking the obvious here?
Hey, no disrespect to my boss's squeeze,
what are 95% of all child abductions?
you think Julia took Petros?
I'm just saying that chick's got issues.
you know how much that is, rabbit?
Hey! Get used to counting those Benjamins, Petros.
ten 100s makes a thousand.
good job. Put it there.
Hey, you want to see what ten thousand feels like?
come on, Petros, it's time to go.
that's good. Hold it like this.
that's good. - Sweetie, why don't you go wash your hands, okay?
what was that all about?
I don't like him around all this cash.
well, you sure as hell don't mind spending it, do you?
that's not what I mean.
he never sees anyone earn it.
you saying I don't work now?
you're not listening. - Then what?
you say you don't want this life for him, yet you keep dragging him into it.
don't tell me how to raise my son.
Julia's lucky she didn't get smacked. The point is, it could have been her.
no, the point is that we have a witness that saw the two of them getting forced into a car.
if there's nothing else, I'm needed at the club.
15 Hours Missing
no sign of Julia or Petros, huh?
no. Parking enforcement id'd the car from the APB.
no one saw him pull in, and no one heard the shots.
Artie lives in the village, right? - Right.
what's he doing in Staten Island? - I don't know.
it looks like he did some off-roading before he ended up like that.
17 hours missing is that where you think Artie went before he got shot?
Yeah, it looks that way.
we found a receipt on him printed at, uh, 1:37 this morning, at a gas station right here.
near Harriman State Park. That would explain the mud.
Yeah.
the park rangers are checking all the cabins and they're circulating photos of Petros and Julia.
could be he went up there to stash them.
Yeah, or to dump the bodies.
preliminary forensics came in.
Artie was killed with a .380 around 9: 00 a.m.
that sounds like Sadik's men got to him.
excuse me. Johnson.
I think they would have tortured him like crazy, and there's no signs of that.
I don't know... if someone took my kid,
I wouldn't waste my time with torture, I'd just shoot the guy.
okay, thanks.
that was local pd-- Harriman.
they found Julia, beat up, no sign of Petros.
did they take her to a hospital?
no, she insisted on going home.
18 Hours Missing
I lost him. I lost my baby.
well, we're here to help you find him, okay?
so tell us what happened.
they took him from me.
who took him? - I don't know.
I think one of them was Artie.
I knew it.
you have to find him.
we did. He's dead.
Julia, talk to us, please.
from the start, what happened?
Petros and I were alone in the house and there was a knock on the door.
I didn't think. I just opened it.
there were two men in masks.
they put us in a car, an SUV.
they tied us up.
where did they take you? - I don't know.
they put a bag over my head, I couldn't see.
we drove for what seemed like hours and then we stopped.
get out of there!
Petros! - Mommy! Mommy!
you tell Sadik he brought this on himself.
no, don't!
don't take him away from me!
it was dark.
I got lost.
and now Petros is gone.
and the other man, Julia, did you recognize his voice?
I tried to listen, but they had the music up very loud because Petros was crying.
does Sadik know that you found me?
not yet.
he'll blame me. I'm as good as dead.
I don't get why they let Julia go.
because she doesn't matter to Sadik, his son does.
Yeah, but she can I. D. Artie. Why take the chance?
well, apparently, Artie's not the one in charge. It's the other guy.
now, did the clerk at the gas station get a good look at him?
no, he only saw Artie.
Jack, Sadik's lawyer is in the lobby, and he's pissed that you sent him downtown.
do me a favor and stall him, will ya?
come on. I know what I'm doing.
Where's Petros?
they still have him.
Where's Julia? I want to see her.
we have her in protective custody, but she doesn't want to speak to you.
two men abducted them.
one of them was Artie lazzaro.
can't talk to him either.
they shot him in the head.
second man had a message for you.
he says that you brought this on yourself.
what else?
it's possible that Julia was sexually assaulted.
who was the second man?
is he from the outside?
or was he one of your own crew? Just give me a name.
go to hell.
I could have found Petros if it wasn't for you dragging me in here.
if anything happens to my son, I swear to god...
look, the reason Petros was abducted you and me are done.
look, I know you want to do this yourself, but I'm telling you it's a bad idea
it will not end well.
what the hell happened?
Yeah, he just left the interrogation room.
bring Martin with you, and do not lose him.
okay.
why did you bring me here?
I'm just a waitress in a club; I don't know about Sadik's guys.
do you know Artie Lazarro?
Yeah, what about him?
looks like he talked to you a lot from his cell phone these last few months.
we used to see each other.
he also called you this morning from a pay phone in Stony Point.
what did you guys talk about?
he gambles. I lent him money.
he wanted to come by and pay me back.
he stayed a while.
you live on Staten Island, yeah? On the corner of Mill and Abbots.
so?
so we found Artie's body in a vacant lot two doors down.
I can't believe it.
did he tell anyone he was coming to see you?
no. - No?
he was up in Harriman Park last night.
mention anything about that to you?
how much money did he give you?
five grand.
how did he get the money?
you listen to me.
there is a six-year-old boy missing.
if you don't help me out here,
I'm going to start asking about your green card status, you got it?
I think Sadik gave Artie a bonus for introducing him to this guy, some Aryan Brotherhood person.
I know those guys from the joint. Up at the saw?
no, glades.
I don't know any of those guys you mentioned.
I already told you, man.
they're friends of Damon and Vito's. - Oh, so you know two guys.
and what, because Artie vouched for you, you think you're in with me now?
come on, Sadik. The guy checks out.
I don't know this Fundarine.
I gave you five guys. You know, that vouch for me.
that ain't enough, well, you can go to hell.
what do you think you're doing?
I want some uzis, but I don't need this.
you don't lay cash on my table and then just pick it back up again.
no guns, no green.
that ain't how it works.
you're making a big mistake.
the deal went bad. The guy got the hell out of there.
but Sadik kept his money.
how do you know that?
I saw him put it in the safe.
did you get this guy's name?
I think Artie called him Travis.
I don't know his last name.
I think Dorina's is lying.
she said that no one knew Artie was coming over this morning.
but right after she talked to him, she called the club.
she works there. She probably makes 20 calls a day there.
at 8: 15 in the morning? Plus, the two calls were only one minute apart.
and then, an hour later, Artie shows up dead.
okay, you got a point. So what?
so I think it's worth looking into.
you picked up Sadik ten minutes before that call came in.
you saw who was at the club.
maybe if you go through some mug shots, you can I. D.
Samantha, I just don't have time for that.
Jack, this could help us find a suspect.
Sadik is going to do that for us. We've got somebody tailing him.
well, what if he doesn't lead us anywhere?
that jerk knows who did it.
I can tell from looking in his eyes when I talk to him.
well, what if he's wrong? What if he doesn't know who did it?
or does that not matter, Jack?
whatever it takes.
does anybody know where Sadik is at right now?
Viv, give me one second.
he and his men just got into an apartment building on 147th.
any idea who they're going there to see?
I'm already working on it.
can I speak to viv?
Viv, we're looking for a guy named Travis.
we don't have a last name.
look at the, the uh, the directory on the building.
we're on it.
all right, there's no, there's no Travis, but we've got a T.Gibson, a T.Billings, T.Holt, T.Brown.
here we go. I have the tenant list.
all right, I have a Tamara, a Timothy, a Trevor and a Travis Holt.
you get that? - Yeah, we gota Holt, apartment 4d.
okay, I want you guys to get in there. I don't care how you do it. But cover your ass.
you hear that?
in there.
I want my kid,
FBI! Keep your hands where we can see 'em!
drop it, Sadik!
he's got my kid!
get against the wall!
get against the wall! Now, both of you, get against the wall!
say good-bye to your family, maggot.
say good-bye to your family! You're dead! - Up against the wall, now!
get against the wall! Get against the wall!
let me see your hands.
I want my boy!
Where's Petros Marku? - I don't know.
I need an ambulance.
get your hands back where I can see them.
Where's the boy?
I'm a cop.
I'm undercover with the one-five.
20 Hours Missing
I want you to call Ann, make sure we can keep
you got it. I'll see you later.
let's go.
where the hell is Sadik?
U put my agents at risk. They could have been killed in there.
Hey, my guy's the one who got beat to a pulp.
Yeah, and if we hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't turned Sadik loose on him.
no, this wouldn't have happened if you had kept me in the loop about what you were doing.
Malone, this is my case. Stay the hell away.
you don't give a crap about your guy.
you're just pushing your own agenda.
Yeah, then I guess we're the same.
Yeah, you wish, jerk.
what are you looking at?
Travis, I'm agent Johnson.
I don't know anything about Sadik's kid.
we think that Artie took him with an accomplice.
someone in Sadik's crew?
it's a possibility.
then I might know who it is.
you don't lay cash on my table and then just pick it back up again.
no guns, no green.
that ain't how it works.
I won, dad!
you're making the biggest mistake of your life.
daddy?
Hey, rabbit, we're just playing pretend right now.
get him out of here, Frankie.
he's all wrong. Any moron could see that.
come on, let's go.
so we'll work something out about the money.
he ain't going to be around forever.
Frankie was serious.
I think he was going to make his move.
did you get the cash back?
we wanted him to keep it, so we could track how the money flowed through Sadik's organization.
so the money was marked?
Yeah.
Thanks. Heal fast.
I hope you find him. The kid saved my life.
21 Hours Missing
you beat up the wrong guy.
Oh, you heard?
they'll go for attempted murder. He's a cop.
I'm looking at 20 years.
sounds about right.
you just wound me up and let me go.
that stuff about Julia being attacked?
I made it up.
what are you doing here? You got what you wanted.
what I want is to find your son.
look, with good behavior,
Petros will be 18.
you still have time.
he's all I got.
then give me something.
I don't know. I thought it was Travis.
but now I don't know, I swear.
have you considered your friend Frankie?
Frankie? No.
no, you're wrong. You're wrong.
he knows what my boy means to me.
that is my point.
he would not betray me.
he was there from the beginning, when we were kids.
get in Sadik! Quick
mama - I'm scared!
Frankie, move further back!
move futher back!
Shhh! Quiet, Sadik, quiet!
Sadik, let me go!
they dragged the body away.
by the time we came out, there was nothing but her blood left on the floor.
that was a long time ago.
a lot of things have changed.
not frankie. Not me.
did you ever give Artie any of the money that you took fromTravis?
it went straight into the safe.
that money was marked.
Artie used that money to pay off Dorina.
and only somebody with access to that safe could get to the money.
Frankie had access.
he tried to make a deal with Travis behind your back.
he's like a brother to me.
are you willing to bet your son's life on that?
22 Hours Missing
Hey, Frankie, what's up?
Hey, I know you. - What's this all about?
it's about Petros.
I told you, I had nothing to do with it.
where is he? - Come on, guys.
it's marked.
I just got that money from Sadik's wife.
from Odetta? Really? What for?
I sold her a pair of blank Belgian passports a couple of hours ago.
24 Hours Missing. 380 automatic.
it's got your prints on it. We found it in the garbage behind your house.
and I'll bet it matches the bullet in Artie's head.
all right. Then let's talk about passports that you bought.
you leaving the country?
I think one of those passports is for you, and the other one is for Petros.
I think you don't have a child of your own, so you decided to take Julia's.
you are a stupid, simple woman.
you're going to jail for a very long time.
why don't you just return the kid?
I would never hurt Julia.
Yeah, but you'd hire Artie to do it and then kill him to cover it up.
you're wrong.
you asked Dorina to call you if she heard from Artie.
and she said yes because you're Sadik's wife.
and then you drove to Staten Island and you shot him. Why?
I was trying to help Petros and Julia.
help them with what?
something I should have done long ago.
get away.
get away from this life.
Petros, stop bouncing.
now you know why Sadik calls him rabbit.
does he ever stop?
when he gets thirsty.
he's growing up so fast. It kind of scares me.
I understand.
I know you do.
mama. Hands up.
Oh, my god, Petros. Where did you get that?
in daddy's drawer.
it's heavy.
Petros, put it down.
I'm playing pretend, like daddy.
it's not pretend.
please, what you're doing is very dangerous, sweetheart.
please, just give it to me. It's good.
do as your mama says.
that's when we knew we must get him away from his father.
so you paid Artie to help get Julia and Petros away?
I thought I could trust him. He betrayed us.
how?
he stole all the money I gave to Julia, and then just dumped her in the park.
where is Petros?
did Artie do something to him?
I think I've said enough.
doesn't make sense. Her story doesn't track.
neither does Julia's. There was no kidnapping and no second man.
you know what I think?
I think she's covering for Julia.
do you mind if I sit?
must have been very difficult to come back here.
of course it was.
you intentionally trashed this place
and then you had Artie drop you and your son off.
that's not true.
your neighbor witnessed the abduction.
he says that you were resisting.
under the circumstances, I would have thought that you'd have been more than willing to go.
Where's your son?
I don't know.
I think you do.
what happened to your son?
please, leave me alone.
that's why Artie carried him out of here in a bundle, isn't it?
he was already dead. Wasn't he?
did you kill him?
did you kill your son?
it was an accident.
it all happened so fast.
mommy, where are we going?
on a little adventure.
is daddy coming, too?
it's a surprise for dad.
are we going to go see him?
are we going to the club?
sweetie, where are your shoes? Put your shoes on, okay?
can I wear my heelys?
where are they? Did you leave them in your room?
I already looked.
okay.
do you think you took them off over here?
sweetheart, I'm not seeing them.
look, if they're not in your room, you're just going to have to wear something else.
I...
I was distracted. I stepped away.
it was only for a few seconds.
Julia, um...
I need to know where your son's body is.
did they find him yet?
Yeah, ten minutes ago.
they're bringing his body in for a positive I.D.
you know, I thought that I could nail Sadik and still find his son.
I thought I could do both.
one out of two.
that wasn't my job.
this was my job.
just tell me.
he's dead.
we found him buried at Harrington State Park.
who did this to him?
it was an accident.
what do you mean it was an accident?
Julia was going to leave you. She was taking him with her.
she packed a gun for protection.
she left him alone for a second and...
...that was it.
Hey, it's Martin.
Hey, I'm on my way. No worries.
listen, I wanted to give you a heads-up. I got a call from NYPD.
okay. Give me a second. Let me get my pen.
I think it's someone you know.
a detective Bianca Gonzalez.
Yeah, she's a good friend of mine.
we were partners at Vice. Is she the missing person? What happened?
well, she disappeared after a shootout at the Cipher House Hotel in Midtown.
according to her captain, she was undercover on a sting when things went haywire.
Elena, you still there?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm on my way.
3 HOURS MISSING
what happened?
homeland Security was buying stolen identities from a Ukrainian
a Goga Yurkovich-- and a Nils Barker.
how is Bianca involved?
well, DHS needed an undercover cop to open the doors for their agent Phillip Shen to the local market.
apparently, she came in with Agent Shen posing as black market distributors.
they made their introductions, and that's when they realized that Yurkovich had this partner Nils Barker.
she's the best undercover cop I know. What went wrong?
well, an agent posing as a janitor said that the trade went well.
the flash drive with the stolen identities for a hundred Gs.
the DHS agent in charge of the sting said they didn't expect this Barker guy to show up.
then everything went south from there.
we got two dead Ukrainians, and Yurkovich is in custody, but won't say a word.
what about the other guy, Barker?
well, he grabbed the money and ran.
Bianca went after him?
no one's heard from her since.
maybe she's still chasing after Barker.
she wouldn't give up without a fight.
4 HOURS MISSING
special Agent Delgado here to talk to Agent Shen.
Hey, I was just about to go in.
how you doing?
I'm fine.
when was the last time you saw your girlfriend?
uh, it's been a while. I don't know, eight, nine months.
are you guys still close?
Yeah, very close. We went to high school together.
then we were partners for, like, four and a half years.
why are you asking, Jack? Are you concerned or procedure?
both.
I got a case to run, and if your relationship's gonna get in the way,
I'm gonna put somebody else on.
I'm a professional. I can do my job.
okay.
I keep running the whole sting in my head to see if I missed any angles.
what's the story with this Nils Barker character?
I don't know the guy.
Yurkovich introduced him as his partner, but I didn't know he had one.
he wasn't part of the investigation?
no, Barker was a bogey. We had zero intel on him.
we should have bailed the moment he showed.
why didn't you?
cause Bianca just rolled with it, and I took her lead.
I don't know. Honestly, I'm starting to think there's something else going on here.
what do you mean?
it was a simple setup.
all we had to do was make the buy, Yurkovich walk away and follow the money.
that thing's going off like a moral aid.
it's another case.
you want to handle it now? 'Cause we need your head in the game.
no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
so I heard you were in with the Latin Kings for three months?
Yep. They killed a priest in my neighborhood.
people were scared to leave their house.
did you get your guy? - Yep.
nearly got my head blown off in the process, but we did get him.
I bet the brass took all the credit while you're back out on the street working your ass off again.
we all end up where we deserve, don't we?
let me look at that.
bro, you trying to get us killed?
any perp worth his salt would have found this, man. Come on.
I didn't think much of it at the time, but after the smoke cleared, we tried pinging that locator and got nothing.
wait, wait. What are you saying? That Bianca stole the money?
because your statement says that Barker is the one that took the cash.
except that now they're both missing and so is our hundred K.
look, I've seen this before.
cops staying under so long, they start getting... entrepreneurial.
we have to look into Bianca's bank accounts and phone records ASAP.
is there anything else about your girlfriend that would make you think she's dirty?
okay, Jack, no.
and I promise you she did not steal that money, okay?
I'm gonna clear that out of the way so we can get to what really happened here.
I'll see you back at the office.
you guys are on fire! All right, come on, you guys. We got to bring it in. Let's go.
you ready? Come on.
one, two, three. Go, Garfield!
all right.
they're going to have to thank you when they play for the Knicks.
Yeah, just don't tell them I can't hit a free throw.
what are you doing here?
I got a job offer at the FBI.
FBI? - Yep.
wow, I didn't even know you were looking.
I didn't want to say anything, you know, in case I didn't get it.
I didn't want to be embarrassed.
look at you, a la Jodie Foster.
moving up the food chain, right?
Yeah, I'm trying.
when do you start?
I go into the academy in a week.
that soon, huh? - Yeah.
moved fast.
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you before. - No.
tu sabes?
man, Bianca, I learned how to be a cop from you.
you know I'm going to always, always remember that.
you know, I don't, I...
I don't want to leave thinking that there's any hard feelings.
Ah, come on. Forget it. Forget that.
we made some bad-ass partners though, right?
best in the 16th, girl. - That's right. That's right.
Hello?
Hey, I've been trying to get a hold of you.
I'm so sorry. I meant to call you.
Oh, it's okay. How are you holding up?
uh, I'm not good, Danny. I'm really worried about her.
you know, I was thinking, remember you mentioned that Bianca had a cousin that lives in Long Island?
Yeah, yeah. I spoke to her already. She hasn't seen her.
all right, I'm just trying to cover all the angles.
I gotta go, okay? I'll call you later.
Hey, any luck at the precinct?
well, half of her colleagues love her.
the other half think she's a real pain in the ass.
well, it could be they're jealous of her record.
last few years, she's gotten convictions on every case she's worked.
any luck tying her to Barker?
not really. Her unit didn't know him.
well, there's nothing in her bank accounts or cell phone records tie them tother.
what about the calls she kept getting before the sting
those did not show up on her cell phone records.
my guess is she's rotating a burner phone.
well, that's good news. Uh, yeah.
Thanks.
we just caught a break.
TSA at MacArthur Airport just stopped Barker from getting on a flight to Toronto.
6 HOURS MISSING
Nils Barker, Special Agents Delgado and Fitzgerald.
my pleasure, I'm sure.
we're looking for Bianca Gonzalez.
I don't know who that is.
she's the woman that chased after you after the shootout this morning.
you remember the shootout where you stole 100 grand?
nobody chased me out of that hotel.
Really? Okay, well, then maybe the two of you ran off together.
you guys were gonna split the cash, but then you got greedy and you killed her.
that's a nice story. You got a title for it?
how about "The Nils Barker Story: Stupid Enough to Sell Stolen Identities to the Cops"?
you like that one?
that's cute.
you're going away already for what, 20 years?
what do you think is gonna happen if I find her dead?
who am I gonna pin that on?
look, she flipped me last week, okay?
she busted me rigging phony ATMs up and down Westchester Ave.
I was supposed to start snitching for her.
still doesn't clear you from killing her.
I'm a scam artist, not a killer.
I wasn't supposed to be working for Yurkovich, so when I saw Bianca at the hotel this morning I blew the meet and took off.
that's it.
I don't believe it. Doesn't make any sense, Martin.
cause if Bianca made him a CI, NYPD didn't say anything about that.
that's a good point.
why they didn't you'll have to ask them.
but the day I got flipped, you could tell she had bad blood with her crew.
so, what do I gotta do?
nothing.
just tell people, after they swipe their card, that the ATM is out of order.
the skimmer here records their info, and I'll pick it up before the tech comes out.
and I get 500 bucks a week?
free money right? - Dang...
actually, not so much, considering I'd go to jail for it.
Nils Barker, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
you have the right to remain silent.
he's on the run! I need backup!
where the hell were you?
we lost audio.
I called for you! He could've killed me, man!
what do you want me to do?
I'm pretty sure the audio thing was a yarn.
as soon as she walked out, these dudes were laughing about it.
you know, it's, uh, it's hard to believe that he could remember all those details after taking a beating like that.
the whole ride back the station they didn't say a word to her.
you better not be lying to me.
is he lying?
I don't know.
listen, Bianca can be difficult.
but for her unit to leave her hanging with a guy like this?
well, if ty had it in for her, today's shootout would've given them the perfect cover to take her out.
7 HOURS MISSING
detective Stevens? I'm Special Agent Jack Malone.
Hey, thanks for all you're doing to help find Gonzalez.
do you make a habit of putting your subordinates in danger?
what are you talking about?
recognize that guy?
I already told your guy no.
you sure? - Yeah.
interesting. Because that man, Nils Barker, almost killed Detective Gonzalez on Thursday night at a convenience store while you and your partners just stood outside and listened.
whoa, our audio went dead.
and I didn't know it was him.
Yes, you did.
and the reason you didn't go in to help was because...
just let me see here.
say in the report...
Oh, yeah. Because she was a "cocky slut.
who told you this?
you did.
you've been mouthing off all over the precinct.
only because she bailed on the job.
ten days ago we had a numbers bust in Van Nest.
gonzalez was supposed to be there, but she didn't show.
one of my guys almost took a bullet covering for her.
so this whole Barker thing-- that was just payback?
it wasn't supposed to go that far.
really.
look, I know where you're going with this, but you need to know I went to see her a few days later to make peace.
and I wound up stepping into something else.
he's going to pay for what he did!
and where do you think you're going to end up? Listen to me.
get out of my face!
I'm sorry, okay. I'm...
I'm just going to kill that punk bitch. - No. No, you're not!
I'm going to take care of it, all right?
but you've gotta swear to me you're not gonna do anything stupid, come on.
you get any dumb ideas, you call me. You understand?
all right?
all right.
are you following me?
Smitty told me you volunteered here.
I came to bury the hatchet.
after what you put me through?
look, I'm trying to make things right.
seems like you got enough problems as it is.
you just stay the hell out of my life.
she hopped a cab, drove off.
and where was this?
the Garfield Community Center.
and who was the "punk bitch" the kid mentioned?
I don't know. Gonzalez runs some teen abuse thing down there.
I just figured she got too involved.
Yeah. All right, thanks.
you okay?
trying. Yeah, hanging in there.
listen, no one at Garfield Community Center can ID the kid.
if he's been abused, I'm not surprised that Bianca would get involved, you know.
she's always trying to take care of everybody else's problems.
Hey, listen, it looks like Stevens wasn't lying after all.
Bianca called a cab from the community center office right before he saw her, and they took her to a 2292 Andrews Avenue in University Heights.
2292?
okay, that address is registered to Bernard Mills.
he has two teenage sons.
and a bunch of drunk-and-disorderlies.
I'll track him down.
you want to walk in together?
no, that's fine. Go ahead. I'll be right in. I'm good.
what's wrong? - Esty bien.
what happened to your eye? - Nothing.
Elena, what happened to your eye? Let me see it.
Bianca, I'm fine. - No, no, no. Let me see your eye.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Carlos? - Yeah.
Desgraciado! Donde. Where is he now?
no idea. I kicked him out. I haven't heard from him. No se, no se.
how come you never told me it got this bad?
he's never hit me before, Bianca. I swear to you.
and it's gonna be the last time. I know what I'm gonna do.
okay. I'm gonna get a restraining order.
I'm gonna get full custody of Sophie.
Yeah, and I'm gonna find Carlos, and I'm gonna... - No, you're not.
Bianca, please. No, leave it alone, okay. Por favor.
I want, I want to be done with this, okay?
okay. Okay. Esta bien. All right? Esta bien.
no. No matter how much foundation you try, you can't go in there like that.
no, that's fine. I just covered it. - Toma. No, no, mami, listen to me.
no, you're not going to go to work, all right.
you're going to go to my place. Toma. Toma.
you're going to go to my place, and you're going to go and rest, and I'm going to cover for you, all right? Toma.
I'm going to cover for you.
is that your kid?
doesn't look like either one of my boys.
or maybe it's just that you don't want to ID one of your boys.
what is this about?
this kid is part of a support group for abused teens.
two days ago Bianca Gonzalez was seen trying to talk him out of killing someone.
she said she would take care of it, then she went straight to your apartment, and now she's missing.
wait, Bianca's missing?
so you're admitting you know Bianca?
of course I know Bianca.
we've been together for over a year now.
she practically lives with me.
so why don't any of her colleagues know anything about you?
she doesn't want the precinct up in our lives, okay.
listen, guys, um, you gotta let me help you with this.
when was the last time you saw her?
she stayed at my house last night. She had a sting this morning.
rule is, I don't call her when she goes under.
all right, what about this kid? Did she say anything about him?
no.
but two days ago, there was definitely something going on with her.
Hey, baby.
what's going on?
nothing.
Bianca, what's wrong?
nothing. I'm fine.
come on. Stop that.
what's on the tape?
a while back I messed up, and, um...
and people got hurt.
what did you do?
I used to say to myself that...
that it was the collar that mattered, you know?
not how you got there.
Bianca, if you don't, if you don't tell me what this is, I can't help you.
there's nothing you can do.
how do you know that? How do you know that?
baby, you know I love you.
but you put up this... this wall between us, and...
I don't know if it's me or if something...
no, it's not you.
it's not you.
all right. Look, you gotta figure things out.
that's the only way this is gonna work.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
you're right. You're right.
I need to deal with this.
and I just figured that I'd let her come to me when she was ready.
do you still have that tape?
Yeah. It- it should still be in the dumpster.
10 HOURS MISSING
what have we got?
most of the tape was pretty damaged, but I was able to digitize about 20 seconds.
you have any idea what's on it?
it has a time stamp from February '05.
or confess now, man, you... you save yourself a chance at parole.
this is 18 seconds later.
say it, Donnelly: I shot Cue Ball.
I shot him in the head.
and this is, I- I just finished processing now.
11 HOURS MISSING
it's an interrogation Bianca did.
Jack, I swear to you, I had no idea this was connected. I- I...
you seriously expect me to believe that?
Yes, I do.
she has worked 1, 000 cases since then.
she was in a shootout this morning.
Yeah, and we have wasted 11 hours.
the key to finding her could be on that tape.
okay, uh, how bad did this case go?
is there any chance of criminal prosecution?
no. It's nothing like that.
then what is it?
Bianca and I busted a crack dealer on possession with intent.
he had killed the competition. He took the supply.
we had the drugs, but we couldn't hang the murder on him, so, we...
we needed a confession.
I get it, Donnelly.
you wanted to move up into the major leagues.
and that's why Cue Ball's in the morgue, and you're selling on his corner.
lady, you got some imagination, hmm?
look, you fight this in court, you lose.
or confess now, man, you save yourself a chance at parole.
you ain't got nothing on me except a bag of dope.
so, now that's the thing about being as ugly as you are, is that witnesses remember you easy.
you followed Cue Ball into the alley behind the bodega.
you put two in his head.
Hey, I'm just telling you what the witness told me.
what witness?
Yvette Russell? Neighborhood watch? Upstanding citizen?
she saw you kill him, and she ain't afraid to take the stand.
neighborhood watch?
you mean that old hag with the rent-a-cop truck?
Oh, just say it, Donnelly: I shot Cue Ball!
or my girl Yvette is gonna get you the needle.
take him back to holding. Come on.
what are you doing? - Stop. Stop.
what are you talking about? I had him! He was about to break.
or lawyer up, mama.
the drug rap is solid.
Oh, come on, Elena. This scumbag is gonna get a few years.
he'll be back like a cancer.
listen to me. Dropping Yvette's name-- that was a bad play. You know it.
what, are you gonna school me on the job now?
or are you gonna have my damn back?
Bianca was only supposed to bluff like we had a witness, but she took it too far.
and then two days later, this lady, Yvette, gets killed, 'cause Donnelly put a hit on her from jail.
and Homicide couldn't, uh...
couldn't make a case against Donnelly, right?
no. He confessed on the drug charges and went to prison.
and after that, it was never the same between us, you know?
who else knows about this?
nobody. Just Bianca and me.
is there anything else you need to tell me? - No.
okay.
how did it go?
it was just like I thought it would.
I'm gonna get some air. Okay.
Jack, you know, I really think if Elena thought it was relevant, she would have come forward.
I assume you're digging up information on Mitch Donnelly.
Yes, I am. - So, what do you have?
he's a drug dealer in the Bronx.
Elena and Bianca's bust cost him five years of his life.
he was just released from Wallkill three days ago.
hundred to one says she had that day marked down on her calendar.
Yeah, along with this parole hearing.
remember that raid that Bianca missed with her unit?
the one that Detective Stevens mentioned?
that's where she was that day.
so, where's Donnelly now?
we don't know. His PO went to his girlfriend's house. He wasn't there.
we've put out a statewide APB.
okay, let's check with his former inmates.
somebody knows where that g's hiding.
Yes, sir. - Thank you.
Yvette Russell's background just came in.
looks like she was a county social worker in Tremont, and then started a neighborhood watch program.
uh, she's survived by her daughter-in-law, Jordan Russell, and a grandson, Tom Russell, Morris Heights, New York.
there's a familiar-looking face.
it sure.
so, listen, we've, um...
we've connected a grandson of Yvette's to Bianca.
we think he's the teenager she was talking to outside the community center.
martin and Viv are on their way to talk to him.
I just thought you'd want to know. - Okay.
I really messed up, Sam.
with Jack? - Yeah.
and back then, you know. I keep thinking about this, and I could have warned Yvette, you ow, and protect her, and I...
Bianca told me to keep my mouth shut, and I was so stupid, and I...
I did.
you know, you're not the one who dropped Yvette's name.
Elena, this isn't your fault.
she's still dead.
right.
when the FBI called me, I...
I ran and never looked back.
you know, we, uh...
we still have to find your friend. Right?
Yeah.
and it's freezing out here. - I know.
let's go in and find her. Okay? - Yeah.
come on.
12 HOURS MISSING - Here we go. - This one here?
Yeah.
go ahead.
about damn time.
get your ass in here!
you heard the lady. - After you.
Hello? - Jordan Russell?
who wants to know?
we're with the FBI. We're not here for you.
we want to talk to your son, Tom.
he comes and goes. Ain't seen him much the past few days.
well, we're looking for Detective Gonzalez.
Yeah, we heard, uh, she was arguing with Tom two nights ago.
you know what that fight was about?
he- He didn't tell me nothing about that.
he didn't, huh?
so, how well do they know each other?
some, I guess.
a few years ago, Tom used to live with his Nainai.
Yvette Russell? - Yeah. She was his dad's mom.
he lived with her till she got killed.
gonzalez was there that day.
Tom was shook up real bad.
Tommy, hey. You want to come stay with me again?
are you Tom? - Yeah.
I'm Detective Gonzalez.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
your grandma was a great woman.
I know.
why don't you come with me?
it's okay. Come on.
from then on, she'd come by every once in a while, asking about him.
when was the last time?
mm, months maybe.
okay, so you don't mind if we wait around until Tom gets home?
you know, it's a bad time. I- I'm expecting company.
expecting company, huh?
you sure you're not waiting for a home delivery?
now, listen, if you want us to leave, quit playing games.
detective Gonzalez came by a few hours ago.
what? - Jordan, open up!
jordan, Tom's been calling me all day, but he's not answering now.
do you know where is he?
I ain't seen him, Detective. Why you so dialed up?
did he talk about going after Mitch Donnelly?
he ain't that kind of fool.
jordan, listen to me. Hey, listen to me.
get this through your junkie brain, okay?
Tom is looking to get himself killed.
maybe you need to stop getting up in our business and mind your own.
what the hell's any of this got to do with you?
look, hey, Jordan.
he ain't got the whole story straight when it comes to Yvette.
meaning what?
meaning he needs to know that I made a mistake.
and he needs to hear that from me.
when Tom came back, I told him what she said.
it started him thinking it was Bianca got Nana killed.
is that what he thought or what you told him?
she damn near admitted it.
well, where is he now?
I don't know.
I don't know where he is.
for real.
but when he left, he had a gun.
13 HOURS MISSING
so I've called Tom's friends. Nobody has seen him.
Jack, I need to go out there.
if the mother convinced Tom that it was Bianca's fault and he went after her, she could be lying in an alley right now.
come on.
I think it's much more likely that Bianca takes out Donnelly before Tom does.
then, all the more reason for me to find her and stop her.
the NYPD interrogated Donnelly's girlfriend. She finally gave up his cell phone.
we were able to ping it to a vacant department store in Queens.
it's a drug lab.
exactly. I mean, these guys
they bribe the security guards and then they set up temporary labs in these places.
okay, grab someone and go check it out.
all right.
Jack, I-I-I can't just sit at a desk.
what do you want from me?
you had a longstanding relationship with this woman, and you're trying to tell me that you could not connect the dots.
you know what? Y-You're right. I should have seen it coming.
Yeah, you should.
I didn't want to.
see if you can catch up with Martin.
thank you.
Hey, security guard admitted that Tom showed up about 20 minutes ago and Bianca was just a few minutes behind him.
the homeless guy in the alley heard a gunshot here, so I called for backup.
FBI! Drop the gun.
I'm a cop.
I don't care. Lower the weapon.
okay, all right.
down.
Elena, what the hell are you doing here?
I've been looking for you.
Tom, turn around and face the wall.
Hey, go easy on him, please. He's with me.
you have any weapons on you?
what did you do?
I've been waiting for this bastard to get out.
word on the street was he set up shop here, so I came to settle our business.
I took care of the guard.
we can cook here for a few days.
see you then, brother.
cooking rock is a parole violation.
we was just going to have a barbecue.
you should stick around.
get yourself a big sausage.
I owe you a bullet.
don't tempt me.
don't move.
we've been down this road before, Gonzalez.
you're all bark and no bite.
you got any more witnesses pointing fingers?
no? I didn't think so.
I should have done this a long time ago.
I put him out.
just like that?
Yeah, that's right.
what is Tom doing here?
he... he must have followed me here.
he walked in right before you did.
all right, Tom, let's go.
you're trying to confess to murder one?
look, this son of a bitch finally got his.
okay, I'm just telling you the truth.
okay, tenemos un problema. Mira, it doesn't match what the guard said.
okay, Tom got here before you.
you came after him, you wanted to stop him, and it was too late.
No!
Oh, no, no. No. Oh, no.
what did you do?
I know exactly what you've been going through.
no, you don't know anything about what I've been going through.
I know you're not a killer, but you weren't going to let Tom go down for this either.
you're just trying to protect that kid, Bianca. Don't do that.
okay, my word as a cop will close this.
it's not going to bring Yvette back.
I know that!
but it makes it right. - No, it doesn't.
Yes, it does. Yes, it does for me.
maybe not you, but for me.
and you know what?
we're different like that, you know?
this is what I need, Elena. Come on.
promise me you'll look after Tom.
por favor. - I can't.
Elena. Por favor.
I promise.
thank you.
I'm sorry.
you ready?
you didn't have to stay.
I wouldn't sleep.
I know you're worried, but we're going to do everything we can to help her, okay?
I know... I know.
I called a defense attorney that owes me a favor.
supposedly, he's the best and the most expensive, but we'll figure out the whole money thing as we go.
what?
why are you so good to me?
because I love you.
honey. I'm sorry for the times that I shut you out.
you know how I am.
but I know I can trust you, and that feels good.
Elena, you can trust me.
if I ever try to walk away...
don't let me, please.
never. - Okay.
never.
never, never, never, never, never.
how about home? Let's go home.
I have a test Monday.
Yeah, well, I have two tests and a 15-page papedue Monday.
what's your point?
some of us actually have to study.
you're hiding.
is Rachel here?
Yes, she's here, and she wants to speak to you, man.
come on. Let's go.
righ Girls like that get boyfriends at orientation.
I know for a fact that she's ngle, okay?
so, just, you got to talk to her.
uh, uh, I-I can't.
I'm not like you.
look, man, just be yoursf.
Rachel will either like you, or she won't.
but you have to try.
you're right. I mean, I'll just talk to her.
I can have a conversation.
Yes.
okay. Let's do it.
all right. That's my boy. Come on.
uh, Rachel?
have you met my roommate Tim?
Yeah.
um, we have art history together.
Yeah.
I should totally be studying for that test.
okay, that's exactly what I said.
Really? - yeah
well, you guys have fun.
Hey, man. How's it going?
listen up, everyone.
one second, one second.
take off your pants!
first you got to buy me a drink and tell me I'm pretty.
Hey, look, guys, tonight, we are going to get very drunk.
and make some-some very bad decisions.
But-But-But before we do that, okay, everyone take a moment to look at the person next to them.
it doesn't matter who they are, or where they're from, if they have money or not.
in this moment, every single one of us is standing next to a friend.
and pretty soon, we're gonna be shoved into the real world, and it's not gonna be that way, but tonight it is.
so, take it in.
enjoy it.
all right, raise 'em up, everyone.
to friends.
to friends!
Hey, Tim, I'm gonna go on a liquor run.
you're in charge.
I am too drunk to drive.
special Agent Taor.
lieutenant Mark Dowtin.
Hey, how are you?
so, the victim's name is Jay Lester?
22 years old.
he was host an off-campus party.
roommate reported him missg when he failed to return from a liquor run.
well, did you guys check the bushes?
I mean, this g might be drunk and passed out somewhere.
bushes are clear.
couple of witnesses said they saw a suspicious man near Lester's car, but not enough for a sketch.
have you notified his parents?
we can't find them.
why not?
you did contact the school, right?
Yeah, but that's the problem.
we found his student ID in the car.
when we ran it, it came back fake.
he attends class, hangs out with college kids, but he's not enrolled at the school.
never was.
why would anybody pose as a college kid?
see the acon around here?
I'd go back if I could.
what time did he leave the party?
Roomte said 12: 15, give or take.
his last page was at 12: 09.
he was lured out and ambushed.
looks like somebody wanted the charade to end.
it smells funny.
smells funny how?
like, I don't know, different than before.
we, Hannah, that is the accumulation of four years of bachelor dust.
appealing.
I like what you've done with the place.
your room is just down here.
Yeah, I know where it is, Dad.
I lived here, for, like, all my life until we moved, remember?
yeah...
have you seen the statistics on age and memory?
it's actually pretty alarming.
you should consider taking supplements.
not bad, Dad.
Yeah, well, I have to admit, I did have someone help me pick it out.
Yeah. lone.
Um...give me about 30 minut, and I'll meet you there, okay?
sorry, honey, I got to...
I know.
okay. I'll call you later.
I'll just keep myself busy with your handguns.
I'll call you in bit.
I have a boyfriend.
I know.
could he come see me?
Yeah, we can discuss it later. Okay?
talk to you in a bit.
dad?
yes?!
Bye.
okay.
lock up.
and ave the safeties on the guns.
so, what happened?
as I was telling Agent Taylor, Jay made a liquor run, and he said, Timmy, you're in charge.
Timmy, are you aware of the fact that you have the word "tool" inscribed on your forehead?
it's just what friends do to friends who can't hold their liquor.
so, Jay's not really a student?
that's right.
were the two of you close?
Yeah. Jay's awesome.
he basically changed mlife.
I was miserable here, totally depressed.
and then he answered my ask for a roommate a few months ago, and everything changed.
in what way?
hanging out with Jay, you just feel like it's okay to be who you are.
very existential.
considering he's not even who he says he is, it's totally Kafkaesque.
um, did you see anybody hanging around Jay's car last night?
no, I was in here the whole time.
you think some dude kidnapped him?
we're not sure. Do you?
maybe. I guess.
last parents' weekend, Jay's couldn't make it-- if he even has parents -
so he tagged along with us.
Yeah, I love you, Mom.
okay.
dad, thanks for coming.
Bye, guys.
okay. Drive safe.
hellish.
that was a hellish weekend.
Yeah. Whatever. Your parents are great.
you guys seem really close.
Oh, we're close.
we' close the way conjoined twins are close.
deal with it. It's a good thing.
you cool?
Yeah, it's nothing.
Oh, what's up?
okay, part of the reason for the visit was so my dad could tell me we can't afford tuition next semester
he lost his job, and we just don't have the money.
what are you gonna do?
I don't know. I'm gonna take a semester off and work until I earn enough money to reenroll, I guess?
you can't do that. It never works.
when you leave, it's hard to come back.
well, don't have a lot of choices.
I've already missed all the deadlines for financial aid.
I'll cover you.
it's ten grand, dude.
you can't afford it.
Yes, I can, and you're taking the money.
how? You don't have a job.
just don't worry about it.
you're a friend. You can pay me back over time.
this is important.
if you think you can swing it...
thank you.
that's really generous.
don't worry about.
you're my boy.
besides, you'd do the same thing for me.
no, I-I wouldn't.
I mean, I would do a lot of things for you, man.
I would take you to the airport.
I'd help you move, but I would not give you ten grand.
when we got back, he went into the closet and pulled out a roll of cash bigger than my head, and just peeled off ten grand, Scarfacetyle.
so, I looked into our boy's finances.
he has a checking account with less than $200 in it and no credit cards.
does he have a source of income?
none that I can find.
he does has a girlfriend, a teacher's assistant on campus.
Danny's going to talk to her.
so, how did it go with Hannah?
uh, you know, it was pretty good...
she liked her room.
thank you.
you're welcome.
I hope you took credit f it.
I thought about it, but she's, uh, way too smart to believe I had anythingo do with it.
anything on the prints from the car?
no, absolutely nothing You know, the name, the student ID-- it's all fabricated.
this Jay Lester doesn't exist.
these witness statements from the party are beginning to sound like an episode of Everybody Loves Jay.
well, not everyone loves him.
look at this I found this campus gossip site.
whoever posted this was pissed off and trying to dig up dirt on Mr. Lester.
maybe it's linked to the money.
the only number we found on the pager was from a burner.
maybe he was dealing and crossed the wrong person.
Yeah, but still doesn't explain why he was posing as a student.
well, if you were a student, and yore looking to buy a little weed, would you rather brave the towers, or buy from the guy playing ultimate Frisbee on the quad?
plus the campus police are no DEA.
all right, I'm gonna have Tech run down who posted this.
Jay is not a drug dealer.
well, Holly, he had a lot of money for being a college student.
Jay's broke.
he's never had any money.
I'm sorry. None of this makes any sense.
how did the two of you meet?
I teach computer science.
Jay's a student.
okay, uh, when did your relationship move beyond the, the student-teacher...
about a month and a half ago.
I tried to stop it, but sometimes you just meet someone and...
you just know.
Yeah.
did he mention anything about someone following him, or did he express any concern for his own safety?
no.
the school doesn't want me to talk about this, but Jay and I were involved in something a couple weeks ago.
can you slow down?
come on, any slowe we'll be walking.
what are you? What are you? Half Kenyan?
Oh, God, you're so pathetic.
Really?
Yes, yes, I am pathetic.
no. I can't be seen kissing a student, so...
I love you.
shut your mouth.
no, no, I am happy as hell right now.
well, yeah, it's because you're full of endorphins.
it's called a runner's high.
no, no, it's you.
I finally found my place.
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
here with you.
now you're supposed to say something.
it's just you're a student and...
I'm a TA.
it's just tricky, you know, and...
I don't want tgo public unless I know it's real.
it is real, Holly.
I love you.
well, then, I guess you're going to have to drop my class.
no problem.
no, get away from me.
help, somebody help, please!
leave me alone
what happened?
help me. He raped me.
Hey, hey!
you're okay. You're okay.
Oh, get off me!
nothing even happened.
she's lying.
shut up.
Holly, call campus security.
okay.
you're okay. Come on.
you're making a mistake, man.
you don't know who you're messing with.
told you to shut up.
we stayed with her till campus police arrived, and Jay gave his statement.
he said he'd do whatever it took to prosecute that pig.
did you know the attacker?
Yeah. Chad Boswell.
he failed my class two semesters ago.
Holly, the-there's something I need to tell you about the person that you know as Jay Lester.
what do you me "the person I know"?
so, talked to the university about the rape.
charges were never filed against Boswell.
the victim dropped out of school and refuses to talk to police.
boswell must have really intimidated her.
Yeah, that or she didn't want to go through a "he said/she said" rape trial.
okay, here's what I'm trying to figure out.
she dropped the case and she's no longer in the picture, then why is Boswell continuing to go after Jay and set up this Web site to discredit him?
these guys protect each other.
I mean, his fraternity is on probation.
there was a hearing set up to review this incident.
this could still cost them their charter.
well, it's starting to look more and more like Boswell's the one who ambushed Jay at his car.
Yeah.
morning, Chad.
what's up?
not much, bro.
how's your day going?
to be honest, less than stellar.
I got a test in, like, two hours that I crammed all night for.
wow, that's amazing.
with all the raping and the online slander,
I can't imagine you have time to hit the books.
I didn't do anything.
she never filed charges.
my attorney's na is Bryan Ruben...
put a sock in it, Chad.
I want to talk about Jay Lester.
I don't know anything about that dude.
that's interesting because we traced the Web site that you put up to discredit him back to your frat hous
sir, please,
I just want this whole thing to go away
Ah, now it's "sir," right.
let me tell you something, Chad.
I am going to take it all away from you.
since you like rape so much, I know a fraternity house upate that you're going to love.
I just suggest that you bring soap on a rope.
why am I being scapegoated?
probably because the whole world is out to get you and they've sent me as their representative.
what happened to Jay Lester?
I don't know.
all right, I-I don't want any part of that guy.
in fact, I'm the one who deserves protection here.
what's up, man?
why are you messing with me?!
w- Whoa, whoa, w- what did I do?
the Website...
it was my lawyer.
he told me to do it to make you an unreliable witness.
what did you find out about me?
nothing, really, except you're not who you say you are.
Yeah, who do you think I am?
I got a bunch of e-mails saying you're some guy named Blake Keyes.
look, it doesn't matter to me, man. Okay?
take the site down.
okay.
so who sent the e-mails?
I have no idea.
it was all anonymous, and I haven't seen him since then.
that's the truth.
Yes, I'm sure it is.
Oh, and by the way, Chad, I talked to the DA.
he's going to refile the rape charges.
is it "Y-S" or "Y-E-S"?
let's go with "Y-E-S.
okay.
Oh, here we go.
Fairfiel Connecticut.
check out the date of birth.
he's 34 years old.
Hey, sweetie.
how's it going?
good. I found some of your old records in your closet.
Yeah, yeah, I know, your old man's a relic.
what, are you kidding me? They're totally cool.
they'd go for major coin at a vinge store.
the Sex Pistols-- I had no idea.
Yeah, well, good luck finding something to play 'em on.
you know, I know it's hard to imagine, but I was young once, and, actually, I was pretty hip.
Yeah, don't push it.
all right, listen, um...
I'm going to have to stay at work longer than I thought.
Hanna, are you going to be okay?
dad, I understand you have a job.
mom has one, too.
you don't have to check up on me every five minutes.
I have stayed home alone before.
o- Okay, then, I'll, um, call you in a bit.
uh, no, I won't call you.
maybe later. Okay?
Bye.
all right, so Jay Lester, who we thought was 22, is actually a 34-year-old man named Blake Keyes.
Yep, Dr. Blake Keyes.
graduated top of his class from Pritzker School of Medicine.
most recently worked at an urgent care clinic in Fairfield.
Viv's on her way to the clinic now.
do we have a last known address for him?
no, the address on the license is a PO box.
uh, coeds?
or maybe he got into trouble and need a place to lay low.
well, college is a good place to do that.
I mean, he can blend in, be whoever he nts to be.
obviously, he plan didn't work 'cause someone caught up with him.
I have no idea why Blake would be living as a college student.
how long did he work here?
a few months.
I was really sorry to lose him.
great doctor.
patients loved him, totally dedicated.
he was in it for all the right reasons.
then why'd he leave?
look, most of my patients don't have insurance.
if this clinic closes, they don't have a lot of options.
I'm here about Dr. Keyes.
nothing you say to me will come back on you.
well, the hippocratic oath is one thing, but Blake got in over hihead.
here we go.
got it all.
Blake, everything all right in here?
get your ass out of here and let the man work.
Hey, hey, put down the gun.
what the hell's going on in here?
everyone just relax.
put the gun down.
what is this?
I'm sorry, Dr. Rivkin.
just let me, let me close him up and I'll explain
you don't think this was the first time he aided criminals?
I know for a fact it was.
apparently, the first time and then once his name got out there, these thugs kept coming back to him, but he promised it wouldn't happen again.
and with that promise you let him keep his job?
well, Blake was an asset.
most guys with his talent just use this place as a steppingstone, but Blake was all in.
so then why'd he leave?
I don't know.
after all that, he handed in his resignation a week later.
that was four months ago.
I haven't seen or heard from him since.
so, I just talked to Viv.
looks like Blake Keyes was the underworld's doctor of choice.
you get shot or stabbed committing a crime, he's your go-to guy.
he's probably getting pai under the table.
Yeah, and it also means that he can drop a dime on a lot of these criminals, and they are not going to let him walk away.
our suspect tracked him down to shut him up.
Yeah, and you know he knew these guys didn't get shot doing charity work.
he choose to get involved with these people.
it's hard to feel worry for him.
hope you guys aren't too attached to Blake Keyes.
Why? What's up?
Oh, a little thing called a death certificate.
the real Blake Keyes died eight months ago.
but we found out he has a PO box registered to a Steven Garcia.
Yeah, Steven Garcia.
been renting this room for six years.
there you go.
did he, uh, do something wrong?
a POox belonging to someone we're looking for.
we were able to trace it back to this address.
is this, uh...is this Steven Garcia?
Yeah, that's him.
you ever hear anybody refer to him as Jay or Blake?
no, but he's never here.
sends me a cashier's check once a month.
you know, perfect tenant.
when was the last time you saw him?
Oh, I don't know.
a couple...a few days ago.
so, what was it?
a couple? A few days ago? What?
come take a look at this.
there's at least ten IDs here, and this one dates back 16 years.
so, do you want to tell me when the last time it is you saw him?
he was here last night.
damn it!
Dave, you scared me.
who's that guy pard out front?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
well, your friend came by earlier and jacked me up looking for a guy named Blake.
did you let him inside?
Yeah, to prove you weren't here so he didn't blow my face off.
What'd you...what'd you say to him?
gave him the address you mail your rent from and I told him what kind of car you drive.
again, he had a pretty convincing gun in my face.
look, Dave...
you in some kind of trouble, Steven?
you need me to call the cops?
no, no, no trouble.
I'm sorry I got you involved ithis.
there's no need to call the cops, okay.
could we just keep this between the two of us?
Yeah.
I gotta go, Dave.
and that's it.
so, so guy shoves a piece in your face and you don't call the cops.
I'm in a beef with my ex-wife over alleged late child support.
I don't need the attention.
what was in the bag?
a human head, for all know.
I wouldn't even hazard a guess.
all right, do you think you could give us a sketch of the man that threatened you?
you bet.
tell me that you got his license plate.
damn right I did.
you stick a gun in my face, I'm getting your tags.
the vehicle s reported stolen two days ago.
I ran the plat saw your people had flagged it, so I called it in.
didn't touch a thing.
we appreciate that.
how long has it been here?
local called in a burned-out car about an hour ago.
you open it, please.
sure.
Hey, Jim!
so, that body you found in the trunk has a thousand-dollar smile.
the guy had three gold teeth, which rules out him being our missing person.
then who was it?
I don't know yet.
but I'm looking at the coroner's report.
he had a gunshot the stomach with a separate incision and some gauze stuffed up into the wound.
looks like somebody forced our guy to go back to work.
it would help if we could ID this body.
I reached out to NYPD in hopes that they could gives some reports on shots fired in the last 24 hours.
so, we'll see.
okay.
how you doing here?
well, he's been tumbling Social Security numbers.
he takes a valid number, then he changes one digit.
he's been working it for 16 years, and he is really meticulous.
so he's creating identities instead of stealing them.
exactly, except for Blake Keyes.
you know, he's the only specific identity Jay assumed.
but he's been stuing him really well, you know, the apartment was filled with medical texts.
what is so special about Blake Keyes?
I don't know, but Blake's sister is coming in from Williamsburg, so we'll find out.
I'm home.
Hola.
where the hell are you?
I went out.
clearly, after I told you not to.
where are you?
why are you so angry?
because you're in New York City and I'm your father, and I specifically told you not to leave this apartment.
no, you did not. You told me to lock up.
the's a difference.
do not be a wise ass with me.
this crap that you were doing with your mother in Chicago, is not gonna fly with me.
you got it?
when I tell you to stay in the apartment, you stay inside the apartment, okay?
end of story.
you got it?
whatever. Bye.
is that our burn victim on one of his better days?
I'm looking for mug shots.
NYPD sent footage of a pawn shop robbery that went down last night.
owner put a round into the suspect's stomach.
clothing matches fragments that we found on our corpse.
you know, whoever our missing son actually is, its kind of unfortunate.
this kid's got a lot of potential.
could've been whoever he wanted to be.
I think he's a lost soul.
he's still a criminal.
he's pretended to be a doctor.
he obviously kept doing these underground surgeries.
although, I'm not really sure it's just about the cash for him.
maybe he gets a rush out of it.
maybe.
here's our body.
Scott McBride, 27.
did eight years for armed robbery.
all right.
I'll check it out, see where it leads.
his real name is Jon Burroughs.
apparently he has a lot of real names.
no, that's Jon.
I've known him nce we were kids.
were you aware that he was impeonating your brother?
Yes.
I started getting telemarketing calls for Blake.
it used to happen all the time.
Blake had split up with his girlfriend, so he was living with me before he died.
and at first I just brushed them off thinking they didn't know about his death, but when the calls keep coming, I knew something was wrong.
good afternoon.
I'm Dr. Keyes.
I can explain.
what the hell are you doing?
this is sick!
my broth is dead.
I know.
I know, I saw th Blake died, and I got this idea, and it got out of hand.
got out of hand?!
unbelievable.
what? Are you getting some kind of kick out of this?
no, I didn't want to hurt anyone.
I just... wanted to be Blake.
or I wanted his life.
no, you don't.
you haveo idea.
do you even know what happened to him?
I saw the obituary.
I assumed that he got sick or was in some sort of accident.
he swallowed a bottle of pills.
he was a frustrated, broken, manic-depressive mess.
why would he do that?
he had everything.
well, I guess everything wasn't enough for him.
I'm...I'm really, really sorry, Chelsea.
Yeah, just live your own life, Jon.
and stop living my brother's because you don't know anything about it.
Blake was one of those people who looked like he had a perfect life.
always the center of attention.
but inside it was a different story.
jon didn't know that.
you id you knew him since you were kids. How?
well, Jon's mother was our live-in nanny.
I was the youngest, and she and Jon lived in our guest house untiI left for college.
all right, did Jon always idolize Blake?
I think it was more about the attention Blake got.
Jon's mother was with us all day, so, looking back, he was starved for that attention.
I want this one to go in the middle.
good eye, Chelsea.
that's a beautiful horse.
Mr. Keyes?
what happened?
wh happened, Jon?
I got anrgent call at work saying one of my sons had been caught shoplifting cigarettes.
when got there, it was Jon.
he told the manage that his last name was Keyes.
jonathan Burroughs, you look at me en I'm talking to you!
I am.
this family has been wonderful to us and this is how you repay them?
I didn't mean anything by it.
I just thought they'd forgive me if I was a Keyes.
well, you're not.
you're Jonathan Burroughs, and this is not your family.
am I clear?
Yes, ma'am.
go. I'lleal with you later.
I am so sorry, Mr. Keyes.
I will clear this ole thing up.
I really don't know what's wrong with that boy.
Jon's entire childhood was like that.
he was always on the outside looking in at all of us.
never his mother's priority.
have you seen Jon since the clinic?
no, I checked back a couple days later.
he was already gone.
Hey, Viv, hold up a second.
you got something?
Yeah, I sure do.
you know our burn victim Scott McBride?
He'got a brother named Grady McBride.
spent his entire life in and out of prison, including a 12-year stint for manslaughter.
take a look.
matches the sketch we got from the landlord.
and if he torched his own brother, I can only imagine what he did to Jon Burroughs.
we found a picture of your brother Scott from the good old days.
you know, when he still had skin.
you think I killed my brother, you're nuts.
um, I think you also murdered him.
I've never seen this guy.
Grady, your brother was shot during a robbery.
obviously you couldn't take him to save him.
I don't know any Jon Burroughs.
that's because you know him as Blake Keyes.
no, I don't know, period.
Grady, you had a bih of a night, okay.
you had robbery that went wrong, your brother died, you torched the car, and all because you picked up a doctor who happens to be a fake.
you know, right now I got you on two counts of murder.
I can spare you the injection if you can help me locate that guy.
can you make me some kind of deal?
he just did.
no, I...I want something.
I want my brother's teeth back.
I'm assuming you're referring to the gold ones.
they used to be a gold watch my dad gave him.
those teeth are like a family heirloom.
okay.
okay, first off, I didn't kill anyone.
that won't get you the teeth.
that's the truth.
I thought this guy Blake was a doctor.
Scottyot shot, and I knew he need help.
and-and this guy wouldn't answer my page.
I had some buddies who'd used him in the past, right?
they knew where he lived, but he wasn't there, so I-I finally ran him down at the college.
I thought we had more time than we did.
hurry up, man! He's bleeding a lot.
please I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
you're going to be all right, okay?
just...just put...
put some of this on your stomach, and hold it there, okay?
listen to me. Listen, okay?
what are you doing? Get to work, man.
the bullet might have perforated his stomach lining.
he needs a hospital.
hospital's not an option.
that's why you're here.
I told you I'm not a doctor.
I can't do it.
you've done it before.
no, we're talking major surgery here, okay.
it's over my head.
Look...my brother dies, so do you.
listen to me, all right.
I'm not a doctor!
I can't do it!
what the hell am I gonnao?
Hey, maybe...maybe I can slow the bleeding a little bit, but he-he needs a hospital.
right now.
I don't want to see your brother die out here.
you keep him alive.
and we got close to the hospital...
but Scotty couldn't hold on.
so I, I drove back to the parking lot and I...
I lit up the car.
but I couldn't bring myself to pull his teeth, you know.
it's understandable.
so what did you do with Jon Burroughs?
I let him go.
I- I dropped him off at Midtown.
could you be more vague?
a couple blocks from Penn Station.
that's all I got.
are we cool?
I'm going to have to verify your story fore I can release the teeth.
and you're sure he boarded the train?
okay.
thanks for your help.
transit confirms Grady's story.
Burroughs bought a single ri on the Adirondack about an hour ago.
making a beeline for Canada.
well, maybe not.
take a look at this.
that line-- it goes right by the campus, Viv.
but he's already burned all those bridges.
why circle back?
because it's over.
it all fell apart.
which is exactly when he cuts bait and starts a new identity.
why change now?
because he met a woman and he fell in love.
is there any better reason?
well, on the off chance that you're wrong, I'm calling the RCMP.
Where's Jon?
I don't know.
is he still here?
no.
how long ago did he leave?
look, I don't want to talk to you guys.
is he okay?
look, all we want to do is help.
he was waiting for m outside my office.
are you okay?
where have you been?
FBI's looking for you.
I'm fine.
Oh, well, that's...that's just great,'cause I'm not.
I don't know what to say.
you could start by telling me your name.
my real name...
is Jon Burroughs.
well, it's not spectacular, but the you go.
why do you do this?
I...I guess...
because nobody's ever looked at me.
I just never felt like I was enough.
SoI, I figure out who people want me to be and that's what I become.
but it never lasts until I met you.
you're the first person that's ever seen me, Holl
just don't.
none of it was real.
how could it be?
you weren't even you.
Yes, yes, I was.
every single moment between us was real
it was you and it was me and I've never felt that way before.
th is impossible now.
I know.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but this is by far the bigge.
you know what really sucks?
I would have loved you anyway.
he asked me not to contact the police so I didn't.
you have any idea where he was headed?
look, I told you he's okay.
can't you just let it go?
he's not hurting anybody.
unfortunately it doesn't work that way.
if you don't tell us what we need to know, we're gonna have to charge you.
you know, you've been very helpful.
that's my card. If you think of anything else, please do not hesitate to call.
good evening.
what the hell was that?
what was what? - That!
uh, she just said she saw him.
obviously, the guy's not missing.
Yeah, okay, I - I get that.
but the guy's also broken numerous laws.
we can't just let that go
we notified AMA.
we're covered.
I- I really don't think this guy's gonna be playing doctor anytime soon.
okay, how can you be so sure?
do you have any leads?
cause I sure as hell don't.
now if you want to go chase a ghost, be my guest.
me? I want to save some taxpayer cash and have a tofu burger, that's it.
tofu burger?
why you so intent on giving this guy a pass?
all right, let me ask you something.
you never wanted to scratch your name and start from zero?
because I have.
I don't know.
hell, Let's go get something to eat.
I might want to become a doctor after all this.
that's a scary thought.
or a Geterinarian.
Hey, Dad.
I picked up some Chinese, but, uh, I guess it could be lunch tomorrow.
listen, um...
I'm really sorry about flying off the handle this afternoon.
it was very theatrical.
Yes, it was.
look, I think you're old enough to hear it.
I really haven't had a chance to be a real father to you in the last four years.
so, you know, I'm a little rusty.
and, you know, anger is a...place that I go to easily, and usually with the same negative results.
but that was the father that you grew up with.
I'm getting really tired of being that guy.
I have no idea what kind of father I'm going to make.
but I'm pretty sure it's going to be better than the previous y.
does the new one like pasta?
as a matter of fact, he does.
good.
cause it's getting cold.
okay Chief.
so you're the new guy
Hey, nice to meet yo Bill.
I'm Jon Burroughs.
what you got there?
Oh, uh, it' uh, Dostoevsky.
I'm studying literature over at the community college.
these meatheads find out you can read, they'll think you're manement in disguise.
thanks for the heads-up.
welcome aboard.
thanks a lot.
it's really good to be here.
sync: Cheshire cat & Ethan -==www. ydy. com/bbs==
time for cake, uncle Bill
Hey, pal
you having any fun at all?
you bet
well, you're lying but that's very festive of you
I just thought...
I hoped the party would be good for you
get out, you know, be with people
I know
besides, there's cake
OK, kids, time for birthday cake...
I called a bunch of times, but he didn't answer, so I came by here
the papers were still on the stoop, and he hadn't brought the mail in
what about his car?
I know he drove it to my house, but it's not in the garage
Oh...
here's everybody who was at the birthday party
I talked to a few of them before I called the police
and what'd you find out?
he didn't talk to anyone at the party
I would like to look around. Is it okay?
of course -Thank you -I didn't touch anything -It's okay
you watch detective shows
well, the first 15 minutes, then I fall asleep
right
now, you said that your brother didn't talk to anybody at the party
not a very social guy?
Oh, he used to be
this is Bill's daughter, Lauren
she died of leukemia eight months ago
his whole life just fell apart
he and his wife got separated, he took a leave from his job
but recently, you know
I thought he was starting to come out of it
at least a little
um, can I borrow you for a minute?
excuse me
what do you got?
kiddie porn
little girls
the man have downloaded them
there's a high-speed internet connection behind the desk, but.
the laptop's missing
the sister did say her brother was coming out of some kind of funk
maybe he found a new hobby, or he went back to an old one
a lot of these look like they might have been pulled off the 'net
did you show the sister?
she was having a hard time believing me, so I showed her one
bet that went down well
stormed off and refused to talk to us anymore
okay, thanks
shields withdrew $2, 000 from his checking account this week- maybe blackmail- yeah, or he's off buying more porn
but regardless, why are we wasting our time with this scumbag?
let's just turn it over to local P.D
no, it's too early
what about that text message he received at the birthday party?
wasn't from a cell phone, but we're tracking it
okay
um, do me a favor?
see if you can track down the original source of these
thanks
I'm sorry, but we needed to know whether you knew anything about this
bill would never be involved in something like this
does Bill have an online handle?
I don't know what you mean
it's a name people use instead of their real name on the internet for privacy reasons
why do you want to know that?
well, because of the pictures
we just need to know whether he's been hanging out in any chat rooms
well, I don't know anything about that
and your daughter, Lauren?
is there any chance that Bill...
no
look, whatever he may have gotten himself into...
he loved Lauren
he would never have hurt her
his sister said that he's...
well, been different we waited so long for something
gene therapy chemotherapy alternative medicine...
something...
to make Lauren better
but nothing did
and all we could do was just hold her hand and watch her die
and how did Bill react when she did?
he, um sort of disappeared
like he couldn't stand to talk about it
and then...
assault, Bill?
I mean, who was it?
why were you beating people up?
I- I'm sorry, Julie, I'm really...
I- I need more than an apology
what do you need?
an explanation for why you're acting this way
what is going on with you?
I- it'll be better soon, Julie
I promise
better how?
you going to go back to work?
are you going to start talking to me again?
she wasn't just your daughter
I miss her, too
I know
I just... can't keep doing this
not with everything else
I'm sorry so whoever he beat up didn't press charges, and the, um...
and the sheriff let him go home
and that's all you know about the assault?
yeah
and I moved out of the house a couple of days later
okay, the fight was with a guy named Jamie Wolff a registered sex offender
the guy lives 90 miles from here
he couldn't find another pervert to have a fight with closer to home?
I don't know, I don't know
maybe they're business partners
nothing starts a fight faster than money
we're bringing him in, so he should be here in half an hour, okay?
okay Delgado - How's it going? - So far, more than, um, half of these are of the same girl
different ages, ranging from six to maybe 12
if he shot these photos, the chances are if we find her, we'll find him
Yeah, we're checking with his friends, family, neighbors...see if, uh, any of them can identify her
I have no idea who he is
the guy assaulted you
yeah
and I didn't know who he was when he attacked me, either
you were convicted of lewd and lascivious acts with a minor
then some guy who also likes kids beats you up
and you expect us to believe that it's random violence?
I didn't say it was random. I just said I didn't know him
then what did he want?
that guy's already gotten me in enough trouble. I don't need anymore
too late
it's about her
he wanted her
hey
who are you?
what are you doing hanging around back here
I'm Bill
I'm looking for this girl
I think she might live nearby
listen, I'll pay you if you just tell me how to find her
why would I know anything?
come on...I know you're on the sex offender's list
Hey!
how did you know that?
Mrs. Graff put you up to this?
no, nobody put me up to it
I'm just looking for the girl!
that's not my problem
look. Listen
I know how it is
it's just...
I have a thing for her
get the hell out of here
not until you tell me how to find her
I have to find her!
let go thank god, the cops didn't look in the garbage can
if they had found that picture...
did he say anything about her?
what her name was?
no
so you didn't press charges because you didn't want anymore attention?
Yeah, fat lot of good that did me
that bitch, Mrs. Graff, she'd been after me ever since I moved in
she saw him loitering, called the cops
I got kicked out of my apartment a week later
where were you Sunday?
at a friend's house watching football
write his name down
you know, that 5390 conviction was a long time ago
I haven't touched anyone since
I'm sure that's very comforting to your victims
if all he has is pictures maybe he hasn't found her yet
just put the local P.D. on it and have them talk to all the sex offenders in the area - see if he's talked with them - I'll check it out
and I have a friend at the center for exploited children.
see if she knows how someone could find one of these girls
guys... give me one second, please
the text message came from a guy named Ruben Davila
petty crimes, mostly theft
Oh...
okay, excellent. Thank you
local P.D. just found Shield's car at a motel near where Davila works
great
open up!
stand up!
put your hands where I can see them!
she's not here
turn around and face the wall turn around!
where is she, Shields?
I don't know
someone sent you a message "Bring money, night lights motel, Stonington.
what, were you gonna try and buy her?
No!
what happened? Davila didn't like the way you treated her and cracked you on the head?
I was trying to save her
is that what you tell yourself to make it okay?
I swear...
I would never hurt her
then how come you got all these pictures?
my daughter...
she loved to dance
and after she died
I wanted to sponsor a little girl's dance lessons
you know, as-as, like, a memorial
so I- I put a couple of words in Google and- and clicked on a link, and...and there she was in a pink tutu. She was so cute except...
there were these other pictures naked doing things
I turned off my computer but I couldn't forget
and I wanted to stop...
to stop it!
so...
so I started to look for her
what happened today?
I thought I'd finally found her
where have you been? I waited all night
had to make sure you weren't a cop- I'm not a cop- I know
no cop would've waited that long
only a man desperate to meet the girl of his dreams
yeah
uh... so where is she?
Where's the money?
$2, 000, just like you asked for
not till I see the girl
what's going on?
give me the money
Hey, listen, I don't want any trouble. Just- just tell me where she is
how about, I'm holding the gun
good
ready to meet her now?
of course
I'll bet you are...
pervert
and when I woke up he was gone, and so was my money
nice story
doesn't fit. We found over 200 kiddie porn pictures in your house
I didn't know how to find her except to use the pictures
they're not all the same girl
I- I- I only kept them if I thought they could help
like, uh, if they had something in common with one of her pictures- you can check- how?
I used keywords
for sorting
they're attached to the photo files
why didn't you give all this to the police?
I didn't know where she was...
and... I didn't know how to explain what I'd been doing all this time but you can help, right?
you have to find her
we'll need you to stay here. We may have more questions
local P.D. talked to Ruben Davila
he never had the girl
it was a scam
well, a pedophile's a great target
it's not like he's gonna call the police, right?
that's exactly what Ruben Davila said apparently he's done it before
Yeah. All right, look at this
looks like Shields is telling the truth
all the photos that aren't of the girl in the tutu have keywords on them and references back to her picture
can we identify this guy?
Mm-mm. This is the only picture we've got of him-- his arm, not his face
she ages six years in these pictures, and no one noticed what was going on?
I'm thinking it's got to be someone with a lot of access without supervision, maybe a family member
or a kidnapping
if so, she might be in our case files
it's worth a shot
Yep
wow, you're walking well
Yeah, anything below a canter, I feel pretty good
do me a favor
a kid from the center for exploited children thought she recognized our missing girl
they're bringing her up here right now. And, uh...
I thought it might be easier for her to talk to a woman- Where are they taking her? - Interview two
okay, I'm expecting a call from tech about these pictures- I'll cover it- Great, thanks
no. Thank you do you know why you're here, Brittany?
they showed me a picture
and you know the girl?
sort of
sort of...?
I met her once at a house where there was a...
party
can you tell me about it?
it's okay, take all the time you need while we waited, we watched TV
I'm brittany
I don't really like this show
do you have a pet?
do you?
a cat
what's its name?
cause he's got this shape on his side that looks like a butterfly
is he soft?
really soft
what grade are you in?
I don't really have a grade
let's go
and that was it
you never saw her again?
no
my foster dad was arrested a few months later and I went to the center
do you think...
you can remember where this house was?
no
did you see who Melissa came to the party with?
I wish I could help
you have helped, Brittany, you've helped a lot
all right, mac, man, show me someth...
Oh, agent Johnson thought he could help since he spent so much time with these photos
all right
just make sure he has an escort when he's moving through the building - I got it covered - Good
okay, uh, anyway Bill figured out that a lot of these pictures were taken at Hamlet suites motels
Yeah, the chain uses the same furniture and paintings in all their rooms
well, that...that's, uh, that's good
unfortunately, it narrows it down to, like, mm, 500 motels
which is why I got stalled
was that how you ended up at Jamie Wolff's?
is there a Hamlet suites motel in his town? -Yeah
okay
now, I analyzed the hamlet suites motel's pictures for light and color so I could determine which ones were taken at the same place at the same time
you airbrushed her out
to focus on the details just in the background
we're compositing all these pictures together - you know, kind of likea puzzle, right? - Right
and I got most of them in place, most of them finished
I was hoping that this would be the last one
hold on a second. What is that right there that looks like a cup? Can you enlarge that?
yeah hold on
there you go
Roger's barbecue and stuff
that must be near a Hamlet suites motel
Yeah, I bet if we cross-referenced these we'll get the town where the pictures were taken
the manager recognizes Melissa's picture. She was here about a month ago
he remembers because she cut her hand on a glass - you got a name? -The man she was with paid cash
so I guess he doesn't want anybody to know who he is
Hey, but the good news is he made such a stink about the cut that the manager paid for a trip to the local E.R.
Yeah, I remember
most kids with a cut like that would be screaming their lungs out
she barely made a sound
you get a chance to talk to her?
no, dad stayed pretty close
too close?
he didn't let her say a thing
wow, you're a brave girl
that's a big cut
I dropped a glass. She tried to help me pick it up
next time you won't be so helpful, I bet
Oh, she's a really good girl I don't think you could stop her
I've taken care of everything with the front desk
okay, we're just going to be a minute
do you need help, sweetheart?
how we doing?
we're all set
okay
all right. Let's go, sweetie
I knew something wasn't right
you know, it seemed like a pretty deep cut, for what he said happened
so she cut herself to get help?
maybe
you contacted cops?
Yeah, I called security to watch them, but they were gone by the time the officer got here
do you know the woman who came into the exam room?
I assumed she was a stepmom or a girlfriend
she didn't seem to have a relationship with the little girl
but she completed all the paperwork?
yeah - Can we see it?
of course
FBI, we need to ask you a few questions
Hey! Hey! Hey!
let go of me! Let go of me!
where is Melissa?
where is she?!
I don't know
she left
he took her - When? -Two weeks ago
that was the last time I saw her
I didn't do anything
then why'd you run?
because she finally got caught
it was him
and I didn't know until the end
what's his name?
I'm going to need an address
I don't have one. He travels for work. Fixes mechanics' tools
I only see him when he's got a job nearby
let me ask you something
how did you, um...
...finally figure out what he was doing?
they stayed at my place that day
I had to run some errands. I guess.
george didn't expect me back so soon - It's too little! - I don't care!
you put it on! -I'm not a baby!
what is the matter with you?
I'm not going to put up with this anymore!
you do what I tell you to do
put it on!
what's going on?
get out! -What are you doing, George?
it's none of your business - Are you okay, Melissa?
get out!
get out!
leave us alone!
he didn't say anything about it later
neither did Melissa
they left and I haven't seen them since
why didn't you call the police?
he'd know it was me
and he'd come back
all right, um...
what else can you tell me about him?
I think he grew up in southern New Jersey
and he was always complaining about how fast Melissa was growing up
he refused to throw away any of her clothes
He...there was a bag that he forgot to take in my closet
we're gonna need that if we need you, we can always call you at home
I know
that's not much of a dinner
I'm not really hungry
yeah
me either
you know
I've been, uh...
I've been in some of these UseNet chat rooms
see if I can find anything on Melissa, and...
yeah - You know her name?
that's a good thing to figure out, right?
Yeah, it's a really good thing
but you were saying about the chat rooms?
Yeah, right
well, I'm getting nowhere
and I was wondering if you think it might help, if I log in with one of your online profiles
it might
I'll write them down
that'd be great
it's hard being in those chat rooms, isn't it?
Yes, it is
when... when I first saw Melissa she was looking right at the camera
and there was something in her eyes, like.
she was begging me to make what was happening to her stop
it reminded me of Lauren
she used to look at me that way after she got sick
searching for Melissa has kept me going these last six months
I don't want to go home
all right
well, if that's the case, then I recommend the apple sauce
thanks
Melissa's 12?
this is a 7-8 wide
for a seven-year-old
apparently he likes to dress her in little girl's clothing
take a look at these
these are her drawings
they're all of the same thing. The same barn, same cows, chickens, every single one
my daughter likes to paint people in these fantastic colorful outfits
it's her way of rebelling against catholic school uniforms
I didn't know you had a daughter
Yeah, I do. She's six
there are 55 George Andersons in New Jersey
maybe we should focus on the ones in rural areas
kids like to draw whatever they're thinking and she seems to have some kind of connection to a farm
okay
I've got a credit card receipt
here
all his bills go to a P.O. Box
but he used the credit card yesterday at a clothing store
Yes, she and her father were in the store the other day shopping for clothes
poor thing
why poor thing?
well, she went into the dressing room to try some things on and she didn't come out for a while, so.
I went to check on her
do you need any other sizes or colors?
no
what is it, honey?
Oh, I'm sure it'll be fine. Just .
tell me what happened
Oh
do you know what's going on?
sort of
well, getting your period is totally normal for a young woman your age
do you have someone you can talk to about it?
a mom?
I could explain it a little if you want
what's going on?
don't tell him.
um, some button problems.
we'll be right out.
please, don't tell him.
she was embarrassed.
I understood that, but she was all alone.
I felt like I had to tell him.
and how did he react?
well, he seemed angry.
you know, I gave her a couple of tampons before she left, but someone has to show her how to use them.
did he, uh, leave any personal information, phone number, address?
for a credit card sale
I would have checked his id, but I don't remember what it said.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. Um, thanks very much for coming in.
we'll have one of our agents escort you out.
thank you very much.
thank you.
if her period started
she's going to lose her little girl appeal.
Yeah.
there's a lot of missing girls out there.
Yes, there are.
so what do you think he's going to do with her now?
Oh, he could sell her to a prostitution ring.
or trade her in for a younger girl.
sometimes these guys, they can't handle the thought of their victims being with somebody else, so they... unfortunately, they kill them.
not a lot of choices.
there are nine George Anderson's in the age range, but only one that lives in rural New Jersey.
want to go for a ride?
can you handle going through these files on your own?
I'm fine.
okay.
is he, uh...
is he having...?
look, we don't know anything for sure.
but the men who post these pictures are often sexually abusing their victims, yeah.
why would he do that to Melissa?
I don't know.
how did he get custody of her?
my sister and her husband died in an auto accident.
george is the older brother, and they thought he'd be a better guardian, in case anything happened.
do you have any idea where your brother is now?
no, I haven't seen him in a long time, since the day they moved away.
well, what if I don't want to go?
I know it's not easy to move, Melissa, but your parents wanted what's best for you, and they thought uncle George was the best.
you could come with us.
I have to stay here and take care of the farm, watch the cows and the pigs and your favorite chicken.
little.
I have to make sure that he's tip-top for when you come to visit.
I can visit?
as much as you want.
okay, Melissa, come on!
let's go.
I'd like to visit.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
uncle George is going to take good care of you.
chicken.
little.
all right, come on. Get in.
watch your fingers.
george called regularly for a while, but now it mostly birthdays, maybe the holidays.
do you have a telephone number for him?
I had one, but he moved and I kept asking for a new one, but George never got it to me.
well, that old number might really help us, so...
I'm sure it's in the house.
I'll go get it.
if you find her, what happens to her then?
well, she's been through a lot.
I'm married now.
and my wife and I...
please bring her here.
we'll make sure she gets everything she needs.
the disconnected phone was from an address in Norwich town.
that's like ten miles away from your children's clothing store.
but I can't find any listings in that area, or a G. Anderson. Nothing.
maybe they're living out of motels?
maybe.
I'll go get the phone books.
okay.
Hey, guys?
I think I got something here.
you know, when we, when we found out that Melissa may no longer be appealing to Anderson because she got her period, I started checking out these chat rooms that focus on pubescent girls, and I found this organization called Plato's vineyard, they're having a meeting tonight, and someone with the handle "farmboy61
says he has merchandise for trade.
that's a pretty rich target.
you shouldn't have any problem putting together a multi-agency surveillance team.
but Anderson might not show up, or he might not bring Melissa with him, and if we just case the party, we run the risk that we still won't get the girl.
so what's the plan?
well, you know, Bill Shields was a regular at these UseNet groups.
so, uh, I got you an invitation to the party.
and when you're talking to people, uh, ne-never use your name or ask theirs.
should I tell them I'm from the FBI, Bill?
No!
everyone goes by their online handle.
got the invitation using pirateship7.
and, uh, I'll let farmboy know that you're interested in the transaion.
but even if he approaches you, don't brg it up.
he'll talk to you, see if he's comforble pursuing it.
okay, Jack, give me a test.
testing, one,
that'll work. I'm going to make sure everything else is good to go.
great.
this is a list I made of, uh, people I've encountered.
their handles and what ey're interested in.
maybe it'll help you fit in.
this, uh, uh, George Anderson guy, um, how does he perceive Melissa?
what do you mean?
well, on the net, he referred to her as merchandise.
is that a code, or does he really think of her as property?
or does he think of her as uh, his daughter, or his girlfriend, what?
I don't know.
all right.
most people end up uninsured because their homeowner's policy has such a low liability ceiling.
well, I guess that's one of the advantages of being a renter.
Mmm. Bad move.
now he's going to sell you renter's insurance.
Ah.
well, if you're gonna do that, then I'm...
I'm gonna need some more coffee.
sugar?
Thanks.
you're a new face.
uh... pirateship7.
I'm farmboy61.
so, um...
want to sit down and we talk?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, you know, computers do most of the work these days.
I mean, the toughest part about inventory management is making sure that the employees don't steal everything.
Yeah. Yeah.
that's true lots of places.
Yeah.
I think you're right about that.
so... in the chat room, you said you were interested.
Yeah.
Why?
when I saw her picture, you could tell that she'd started so young, that...
do you mind me asking what her name is?
that's a sweet name.
like I was saying, when I looked at her picture, you know, she seemed to have started so young and she could have been hardened by now, but she still had this freshness to her.
I mean, obviously you've done a great job grooming her for... you know, her future responsibilities.
she's a good girl.
Yeah, I can see that.
she deserves a good home.
I mean, it- it won't be the same kind of home that you gave her, but I will really take good care of Melissa.
maybe we should see how the two of you get along.
Yeah, I'd like that.
where is she?
what's going on?
she's not here.
you running some kind of scam here?
no, everything's okay.
well, you can never be too careful.
is she a runner?
no, but you know, better safe than sorry, that's my feeling.
can I talk to her?
just don't close the door.
sure.
Hello, Melissa.
let's do it.
chicken little says hi.
he sent me to help you.
FBI! Get on the ground!
get on the ground!
that'll work.
keep your hands where
I can see them.
get up!
okay, come on, he's not going to hurt you anymore.
okay, okay.
mommy had to leave for work early, Ethan.
she had a meeting.
she always has meetings.
that's not true.
I miss Mommy.
I know, sweetie, but you'll see her later.
is she going to be home to read me a story?
she's going to do her best.
I am not happy.
just think of all the fun you'll have with your friends at school.
martin: Get anything out of the nanny?
just that the guy's tall, about six-two.
so what happened?
well, apparently the guy popped up out of nowhere, slammed the nanny's head against the car and took off with the kid.
a carjacking gone wrong?
Nah. He knew that kid was in the car.
Yeah. Rover's worth close to 100 grand.
sounds like these people have some cash.
sure looks like it, doesn't it?
dad's an R&D guy for Genacore Pharmaceuticals.
mom's a lobbyist.
uh, all right.
so much for the carjacking.
all right, thanks.
find the Rover?
Yeah, but the kid's not in it.
okay, keep me posted.
ERT says that the Rover's clean
no blood, no prints.
they must've transferred the kid to another car.
any witnesses? Not yet, but we're going door to door.
we've set up checkpoints and we went wide with the boy's picture.
what's the ETA on the parents?
I think the mom just got here.
are you okay?
they took Ethan. I'm so sorry.
Mrs. Heller?
special Agent Jack Malone from the FBI.
Where's my husband?
we've contacted him.
he's on his way.
um... is there, uh, somewhere more private we could speak?
Yeah.
somebody that knew your son's routine
what time he went to school, what time he came home...
God.
have you noticed anyone watching the house?
no.
have you noticed any unusual cars parked outside?
not that I remember.
Wha... Why would they do this? For money?
it's possible.
if it is a ransom, we're ready.
Mrs. Heller, uh...
I need to ask you, um...
...what kind of funds do you have available?
maybe $500, 000.
okay. Who else would know about this?
I'm not sure.
well, I need you to think about it and think about it carefully, because it could be relevant.
now, do you or your husband have any enemies?
Jim doesn't.
I'm a lobbyist for the oil industry, so you can imagine.
okay, so, have you received any threats lately?
uh... I get hate mail every day, mostly from EcoBrigade.
and they are an environmental group?
a pretty radical one.
uh, anything beyond the letters?
they picket the office.
two weeks ago, they... got past security and spray painted my car.
so they know what you drive.
they could've gotten your address from the license plate.
do you know the names of any of these people?
I know the one who harassed me the most:
martin: Come on, guys. What are you doing?
these suction-cup mikes-- they fall off all the time.
get this thing hardwired.
Yeah.
okay, well, you got my number.
if you hear from him, please have him call me.
it's urgent.
what if it's my fault they took Ethan?
what if it's all because of my job?
Danny: Excuse me, Jack.
uh...
I, uh, can't seem to get
Mr. Heller on the phone, and he should've been here by now.
you try his office?
Yeah. They said he'd left over an hour ago.
okay, keep trying.
okay.
what? Was that about Ethan?
we're just trying to figure out where your husband is.
have you talked to him since this happened?
I couldn't get through.
he didn't call when he heard the news?
I'm sure he tried.
my cell phone died on the way here.
are the two of you having any problems?
what does that matter?
everything matters.
things have been difficult.
he's been staying at a hotel.
since when?
last week.
we've been fighting a lot lately.
it just got to be too much.
what is this?
Hey.
it's the play set we ordered.
that's not what I thought it would be; it's too big.
come on down right now.
but Mommy said I could play.
and I'm saying that you can't.
now get down before you break your neck.
I told him it was okay.
it's not okay!
why don't you just let him run off into the traffic and get it over with?! Jim!
thank you.
Ethan, go inside for a minute, okay?
thank you.
what is wrong with you?
it's nothing.
that's not good enough.
you've been like this for weeks, Jim.
you're uptight all the time.
you blow up over nothing.
Ethan is a nervous wreck around you.
did you know he started wetting his bed again?
no.
Stephanie, I'm sorry...
I'm sick of the apologies.
what I want is an explanation.
I don't want to talk about it.
then you can't be here, Jim...
not until you figure this out.
I will not put Ethan through it anymore.
I really just wanted to shake him up...
get through to him.
he packed a bag and went to the Carson Hotel.
and you have no idea why he's been behaving this way?
I wish I knew.
he's a wonderful man.
did you two talk about custody?
we're having some problems; we're not getting divorced.
but you wouldn't allow him to be around your son.
Yes, but...
has he seen him since? No.
well, because you wouldn't allow it.
Jim had absolutely nothing to do with this.
so, you're sure Mr. Heller told you he was headed home?
of course. I mean, his kid just got grabbed.
do you think something's happened to him?
we don't know.
SAMANTHA: Do you remember what time he left?
okay, so, we called him at 9: 30.
he left at 9: 50.
where was he for 20 minutes?
he was in here with the door closed.
when he didn't come out, I-I started to get worried.
Mr. Heller, what are you still doing here?
I'm just... just finishing up a few things.
can't it wait?
you're right.
I don't know what I'm thinking.
do you need help?
is-is there something I can do for you?
no. I need to go... home.
if anyone calls, tell them I'm on my way.
we're all thinking of you.
we'll be praying for Ethan.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I just figured he froze, he got overwhelmed.
did Jim have any friends around here
you know, someone he can confide in?
he's pretty tight with Al Carter.
he's a research analyst. Viv.
check this out.
he got an email at 8: 46 this morning entitled "your son."
that's what, 15 minutes after the kid was grabbed?
now, there's no message, but he did download an attachment.
please, Daddy, do what he says.
please, Daddy, do what he says.
so, the video's only 11 seconds long.
it was uploaded onto a wireless hub at a coffee shop in Queens.
kid looks to be in the backseat of a car.
can't ID the user?
no, no, but I was able to dig out a voice.
here, listen.
man: Tell him what I told you.
Ethan: Please, Daddy, do what he says.
man: Tell him what I told you.
that's a Midwest accent, maybe 30, 40 years old.
what's it picking up here?
uh, most likely vibrations from his hand, shooting the video.
now, you see the second vibration source?
the most likely frequency match on that is an engine.
the car's moving. Yeah, yeah.
I'm thinking this was shot minutes after the abduction.
well, it can't be the driver who's shooting it, so that means we have more than one kidnapper.
right, right.
any chance of IDing the car from the upholstery?
um, well, there's not a lot of detail there.
you know, the-the, uh, right answer is "Yes, sir."
Yes, sir.
right.
man: Tell him what I told you.
Ethan: Please, Daddy, do what he says.
you recognize the voice?
I need to hear it again.
man: Tell him what I told you.
Ethan: Please, Daddy, do what he says.
I don't think so. I can't tell.
it's okay.
we really appreciate you trying.
what does this mean?
what are they going to do to Ethan?
well, Mrs. Heller, we're doing everything we can to get your son back.
what about Jim?
we're trying to find him, too.
Hey, Jack, one second.
we tracked down Neil Brown, the angry environmentalist.
no violent priors, plus he has an alibi.
how solid?
well, he's been in Oregon for the past three days living on top of a giant redwood.
that's pretty solid.
how we doing on tracking Heller's phone records?
he got a one-minute call from a prepaid cell just before he opened the proof-of-life video.
it's got to be the kidnappers.
well, it fits-- that's why Ethan told his dad, Do what he says.
I'm assuming he's referring to the call.
that schmuck is trying to handle this on his own.
we looked into his accounts, and he's not trying to take money out for ransom.
well, they kidnapped his son, so they want something.
Mm-hmm. Keep digging into Heller's past; let's find out what it is.
no problem.
thank you for sitting down with us, Mr. Carter.
I just hope I can help.
now, was Mr. Heller having any problems here at work?
no... um, not that I'm aware of.
he heads up the whole research division.
that's-that's certainly not an easy job.
uh, you two were pretty good friends, right?
well, I'd say we're more... colleagues these days.
why is that?
the truth is, uh, Jim's been acting a little...
odd the past month... withdrawn.
did he ever say why?
al: No.
and then four days ago, something really strange happened.
Hey!
Hey!
holy crap. Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
you sure? I'm fine, I'm fine.
who the hell was that?
Oh... Well, what did he want?
my wallet. I-I don't have it with me.
hold on, I'm going to call the police.
no, no, no. What are they going to do, right?
Jim, you should at least report this.
I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine, really.
just forget it.
all right.
he came to work the next day as if nothing even happened.
did you get a good look at this guy?
uh, not really.
the hood he was wearing blocked his face.
I don't know why I listened to Jim.
I mean, I should've reported it.
Stephanie: Jim was attacked?
unfortunately, yeah.
he never told you about it?
no.
well, we think it could be connected to the kidnapping.
how?
that's what we need you to tell us.
look, did Jim have any financial problems?
no. Uh, shaky investments, lawsuits?
does Jim have a gambling problem?
no, absolutely not. Well, look at everything that's happened-- he's clearly into something.
not that I know about.
you are married, right?
Yes, but I can't imagine what it is.
well, try imagining a little harder.
excuse me for a second.
what the hell was that?
I'm sorry, man. I just feel like crap.
I don't know if it's the flu or something I ate.
no, you know, maybe you should take a sick day.
: look, I'm not taking a sick day.
we're right in the middle of a case.
I'll be fine.
how we doing on Heller?
well, in the last two months, he used his credits cards at gas stations and restaurants all over upstate,
you see? Hotels?
a few times.
and listen, the wife doesn't know anything about the trips.
so what else is new?
um... do you see any patterns?
Elena: Well, they're all within a few hours' drive.
there's little towns, big towns.
he doesn't go to the same place twice.
romantic getaways?
well, it could be the guy that knocked him around was a jealous husband.
seems like he's driving a lot of miles to get laid.
okay, great. We'll be right there.
NYPD just found Heller's car...
with him in it.
FBI. Where is he?
in the Beamer.
he said not to approach him, so we just stayed put.
what's he been doing?
just sitting there.
I'll go talk to him.
do you want to stay here?
Elena: Sure.
Mr. Heller?
it's the FBI.
open up. I want to talk to you.
Mr. Heller,
I'm Jack Malone from the FBI.
I'm here to get your son back.
look, I know that they called you.
I know that you saw the video with Ethan, and I understand that you are scared to death.
you don't understand anything.
I know what they told you:
don't call the cops, and we won't hurt him.
you want to believe that if you do just as they say, this will just all go away
it'll disappear, be like it never happened.
but let me tell you something, Mr. Heller:
that's just wishful thinking.
I don't have a choice.
Yes, you do.
you have a choice; you're just refusing to take it.
now, they called you.
so what do they want?
it's not the ransom, because you haven't even tried to pay it.
so what do they want you to do?
I have nothing else to say.
I want you to listen to me very carefully, because what I'm about to tell you is what's going to happen next.
I am going to walk out of this car because you refuse to cooperate, and then next time we meet, it'll be in a morgue to identify the body of your dead five-year-old son.
you get the hell out.
okay.
fine.
what are you doing?!
you can't arrest me!
no, but I can detain you.
I'm not going to let your son die because you're an idiot.
Hey, Viv, check this out.
three weeks back,
Heller pulled $50, 000 out of his brokerage account.
any idea where it went?
Yeah. He transferred it to a dummy account, then wired it to an M. Villante.
okay, so maybe this M. Villante didn't think it was enough.
so what, he takes the kid to get more?
have we got an address?
we're looking for M. Villante.
that's me-- Maria Villante.
I was about to sell the house, pay for my son's medical bills.
it was like a miracle when that money showed up.
you have no idea who gave you the $50, 000?
the bank manager said the account it came from had been closed.
I just figured it was sent to me by mistake.
you know, I keep expecting somebody will ask for it back.
well, this is the man that gave it to you.
do you know who he is?
Yeah. Yeah, he's from Genacore.
it's Mr. Heller.
you work for Genacore?
no. No, my son Tommy
uh, he was in a clinical trial for Exilair.
it's their new asthma drug.
right. You have any idea why Mr. Heller would be sending you money?
no. It doesn't make any sense at all.
is your son still involved in the trials?
Tommy passed away in January.
I'm sorry.
it's hard for me to say it out loud.
um, just so we're clear here, you never met Mr. Heller before bringing your son into Genacore, is that right?
Tommy was in the trial for three years, but I didn't meet Mr. Heller then.
it wasn't until a few weeks after Tommy died.
he came to the house one night.
he was tired a lot of the time.
you know, lethargic.
so, is this normal-- this kind of follow-up?
we're just collecting information that might be useful one day.
for other kids.
well, that's good.
that's important.
I think so.
okay.
before the pneumocystis was diagnosed, what exactly were Tommy's symptoms?
well, he had these sores in his mouth.
oral ulcers?
Yeah.
that's right.
I'm sorry, I just, um...
I can't think of anything else.
you know, ever since he died, my memory's not so great.
well, you've been extremely helpful.
I can hardly remember his voice anymore.
how can that be?
I... really should leave you to get back to your children.
that's okay, you don't have to rush off, it's okay.
I have a long drive.
thank you so much for your time.
him coming by meant a lot.
you know, showed me that someone cared.
have you heard from him since?
Uh-uh.
no, but you're saying that he's the one who gave me the money?
so why would he do that?
Heller's afraid that Exilair is what killed that boy.
well, I bet she's not the only he spoke to.
maybe one of the other parents wanted payback.
do you know who did this, Jim?
do you know who took Ethan?
no.
but you know what they want.
why are you protecting them?
just talk to me.
talk to the agents.
we need to get him back.
that's what I'm trying to do.
still not talking?
not even to his wife.
something's got him really scared.
you know, maybe it's Genacore.
the place where we picked him up is two blocks from the corporate offices, and it turns out he was there this morning.
have a seat.
we're all in shock over Jim's son being abducted.
if there's anything at all we can do.
you can start by telling me how much of the company's revenue is generated by the sales of Exilair.
I can't believe that you need a lawyer to help you answer that question.
well, I was told we were here to discuss Jim Heller's situation.
what is that, 85%, is that about right?
it's the first product out of our pipeline to win FDA approval.
we've been very fortunate.
I would say so;
you now have five pharmaceutical companies courting you.
Genacore is the hot new girl that everybody's chasing, but without Exilair... she can't give it away.
very colorful.
what's your point,
agent Malone?
if there were something wrong with the drug, it would derail a lot of plans, correct?
there is no problem with Exilair.
it's been on the market for almost a year, we've helped thousands of patients.
is that something that you discussed with Mr. Heller in your office this morning?
you don't have to respond, Michael.
we know that you had security remove him after an argument.
what was the argument about?
you don't have to answer that, either.
don't you find it interesting, Mr. Fletcher, that after his son is kidnapped, the first person that Heller speaks to is you.
why is that?
it's okay.
I've got nothing to hide.
I saw Jim.
he just showed up at headquarters, he was acting totally irrational.
Mike, wait!
Jim. What are you doing here?
I know I shouldn't have gone behind your back with the investigation.
what are you talking about, what investigation?
it'll never happen again.
I just want my son back.
please.
your son?
you're not making any sense.
why would I have your son?
no, no, Jim, Jim.
you need to pull yourself together.
I know... Just pull yourself together.
I know that you know where Ethan is!
Hey!
get him off of me! Get him off of me!
you let them!
my boy!
why are you doing this to me?!
he's my little boy!
get off me!
I didn't hear the news about Jim's son till later on in the morning.
obviously, I feel terrible about it.
Heller thought that looking into Exilair was the reason his son was abducted.
that's absolutely absurd.
is it?
you're sitting here with your lawyer-- obviously you knew he had concerns about the drug.
I knew nothing about the investigation.
Yes, he showed me some raw data.
about what, lung infections?
pneumocystis, yes.
and did you report it to the FDA?
of course.
and they agreed with a dozen Genacore researchers who reviewed the data:
it was inconclusive.
we followed regulations to the letter.
tell that to the kids who died, Mr. Fletcher.
look...
who stands to lose the most if something bad comes out about Exilair?
the children benefiting from it.
do you have stock?
we all do.
everyone who started with us received a generous equity package.
share prices go down, people lose a lot of money.
nobody's made a dime from the sale of that stock yet.
it hasn't vested.
when does it come due?
when does it vest, Mr. Fletcher? Answer the question.
in two days.
so Mack enhanced the video, and the backseat Ethan was in is from six possible cars.
what are those?
our agents found medical files stashed all over Jim's hotel room.
more kids who died from Exilair.
Yeah, I been talking to the families.
did Jim visit them?
Yeah.
after he left, another man showed up and asked one of the families a ton of questions.
don't suppose they got a name, huh?
no. But they're giving us a sketch.
anybody see the car he was driving? Yeah.
hang on.
okay, blue Oldsmobile, late '80s.
okay, 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass.
it's on Mack's list.
let's put out an alert.
SAMANTHA: Do you know who this is?
I don't know.
but you've seen him before, right?
and he saw you interviewing those families.
we also think he's the guy who roughed you up in the parking lot.
I don't know what you're talking about.
look, you had problems with Exilair.
somebody in the company thought you were going to go public, and they didn't want you trashing the stock before it had time to vest.
so they grabbed your kid and told you to sit tight and shut up for 48 hours.
Malone: Look, we know everything.
so, whatever deal you made with them means absolutely nothing.
where does that leave my son?
in a much better place now that we're in the loop.
how the hell do you know?
look at this man.
he is a hired gun.
make no mistake, he will fulfill his contract, kill your son, and collect the money.
so why don't you tell us what the kidnappers told you.
just like you said.
I was supposed to keep quiet and they'd let Ethan go.
when did you first realize this drug wasn't safe?
about a year before the approval.
but the trial said that 99% of the kids on Exilair were actually helped by it, so I convinced myself the risks were worth it.
and what changed your mind?
couple of months back,
Stephanie and I took Ethan to the doctor.
he's had the fever and swelling how long?
five, maybe six days.
my hands are itchy.
then we'll just have to un-itch them.
Kristen, can you take Ethan to the play room?
we'll be right there, Sweetie.
what's wrong with him?
he's going to be fine.
the textbook name for his condition is mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome,
also known as Kawasaki's disease.
what is that, is it serious?
I won't lie to you. It certainly can be.
Oh, my God.
but...
with a course of intravenous gamma globulin, within a few weeks he'll be a good as new.
you're lucky.
before gamma globulin, there wasn't a lot we could do.
I, uh... I lost a little girl to it not long after I started practicing.
how safe is the treatment?
Oh, it's been around for 20 years.
you have nothing to worry about.
twenty years.
I knew Exilair didn't have that kind of track record, and it never would
yet people were depending on it.
they're trusting us with the lives of their children.
I couldn't look away anymore.
why didn't you tell your wife?
what was I going to say, that the drug I'd spent years working on was actually secretly killing kids?
I know what happens to whistle-blowers.
I wanted to protect my family, do it confidentially.
I was gathering information to send to the New York Times when they took Ethan.
did you talk to anyone, other than Michael Fletcher, about your concerns?
Nope.
that's why I became convinced that he had to be involved.
but now I don't know.
what am I supposed to do now?
talk to your wife.
officer spotted a blue Cutlass at a deli in the Bronx with a kid in the back.
this our guy? Yeah, it looks that way.
I'm going to have to agree with you on this one.
excuse me. Give me a little space.
all right, let's clear out.
watch. Thank you.
yo. How you doing, man?
you okay to talk?
Yeah.
well, you want to tell us what happened?
I spotted the Cutlass, so I went to check it out.
that's when I saw the kid.
well, was the kid okay?
as far as I could tell.
right after-- that's when it hit the fan.
sir, reach out with your right hand, lift the door handle and slowly step out of the vehicle.
all I could do was lie on my ... and get the plate.
okay, now, there was only one other guy in the car?
you're absolutely sure?
Yeah.
can you describe him?
reddish ir...
average-looking.
average-looking.
I'm sorry. It just happened so fast.
it's all right. It's all right.
you take care, okay?
Thanks.
you got something?
all right, thanks.
all right, so, the Cutlass is registered to a Scott Matthews.
you're looking at him.
no, I'm not looking for him.
I'm looking for information on him.
well, do you know who any of his friends are?
well, maybe he hung around with other people in the building.
okay, was that his first job after he left the Marines?
I'm going to need a list of employees going back about 10 years.
no, no, not tomorrow-- right now.
listen, lady, I could be doing other things, too.
I need it now.
what part of "now" do you not understand?
VIVIAN: He was a security guard?
Uh-huh.
and the company he worked for was WeimerTech.
can you tell me what year that was?
got it. Thanks.
I just found out who Scott Matthews used to work with at WeimerTech.
Yeah, I worked there.
what happened to that company, Mr. Carter?
you know, what happened to a lot of start-ups
didn't work out.
Jack: Is that where you met Scott Matthews?
I don't think I remember anyone named, what, Scott Matthews?
you are going to spill your guts in here one way or the other.
now, do you want to cooperate with me or not?
no?
okay. Fine.
Yeah.
clear the floor.
what?
Mr. Carter, you don't know, because you can't see through that window, but right now, every single agent out there is clearing the floor so they can't see what's about to happen in here.
it's like, uh, "if a tree falls in the forest" kind of thing.
I should get a lawyer.
go ahead.
let's see if you can make it to the door.
now, where's the boy?
I don't know.
you had him kidnapped.
you own 80, 000 shares of Genacore, and Jim Heller was about to flush it down the toilet.
am I correct?
he was going to ruin everything.
look...
Exilair-- it is a good drug.
it's just that...
some anomalies showed up in the data.
is that your way of saying that kids were dying?
very few compared to how many were being helped.
so I...
I reclassified them in the analysis for the FDA.
look, dozens of people reviewed those numbers, and no one noticed a problem.
Jim Heller did.
he was rechecking the data.
he have any idea what you were up to?
no one did.
no one wants to know.
so you think that makes it okay.
that's not what I'm saying here.
Yes, it is, 'cause 100 people turn their heads the other way, and no one is to blame.
now, who is Scott Matthews' partner?
I honestly don't know.
they were in the Bronx heading south.
where are they going?
I was supposed to meet them at the West Side docks at 50th Street at 8: 30.
with the boy?
I was going to let him go, I swear.
I didn't want anybody to get hurt.
it's a little late for that, Mr. Carter.
martin: I got Ethan.
I don't see the perp.
he's still here.
there's no way he left that kid without the cash.
you know, I don't care.
we can't just leave him standing out there like that.
Martin, listen to me.
we're going to stick to the book, all right?
backup's on its way.
it'll be safer for the kid. You know what?
we don't have time to wait for backup.
what if he shoots him while he's standing out there, huh?
what if he shoots him?
we're waiting for backup, all right?
no, we're not going to wait. You just cover me.
what are you doi?
Hey, Ethan.
Hey! Hey!
Martin, get the kid.
Martin, get the kid!
Yeah, okay.
come here.
it's okay. It's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
my name is Martin.
I'm a policeman. You're safe now.
Stephanie: We love you!
I'm so sorry.
thank God you're safe.
I'm going to go home now.
good night.
night.
Whoops. Oh, hey, Jack.
Hey, how you doing?
I heard that things went to crap pretty fast out there.
Yeah, yeah, they did.
listen, um...
don't worry about the paperwork tonight.
you can do it in the morning.
okay, cool. All right, good night.
good night.
Hey, uh...
I need to talk to you for a second.
Yeah, well, I need to talk to you, too.
all right.
you almost got that kid killed today.
I know.
I'm sorry; I made a bad call.
what is it?
what's what?
what is it? Is it... is it painkillers?
what are you talking about?
I already told you I wasn't feeling well.
I know what an addict looks like.
Yeah, but you got it all wrong.
Yeah, I must have it all wrong.
Martin, look at me.
you have a problem.
all right?
you have to get yourself straight, and you have to do it before you put any of our people in danger.
no, I would never do that.
you're already doing it.
excuse me.
911. What's your emergency?
my arm.
I think I'm having a heart attack.
ems is five minutes out, Mr. Matheson. Is anyone there with you?
no, no, it's just me.
somebody smashed the window and there's glass all over the floor.
is the intruder still in the house?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, ma'am, this is 911, not 411.
I cannot give you directions to best buy.
how far apart are your contractions?
the fire department is just a couple of blocks away.
I can't open the window! It's painted over, and...
Mrs. Emmerson, can you safely exit the apartment some other way?
the smoke and fire, it-it's everywhere. I can't see anything.
okay, I want you and your kids to get down on the floor, under the smoke and see if there's some other way for you to get out.
Julie, oh, my god! Julie, no!
Mrs. Emmerson?
the fire department is on the scene.
can you put something bright in the window so they can find you?
no, No, Julie!
Mrs. Emmerson?
can anyone hear me?
dispatch? This is operator 7829.
I lost contact with the Staten Island fire.
Hey. Oh, I didn't mean to startle you.
someone's asking for you on the emergency line number eight.
is it the Stanton Island fire?
no, it's a man, but he won't give his name.
do you want me to dump it?
uh, no, I'll take it.
okay. 911. What's your emergency?
who is this?
listen, you can't call me on this line.
all right, I am hanging up. And if you ever call me again Jessica Lawson, 27, got a call from a man who asked for her by name.
coworkers say she was pretty upset.
she took a break and nobody's seen her since.
this is Tom Noles, her supervisor.
he's pulling up the call for us.
who called it in?
a coworker by the name of Paulette Harrison.
she transferred the call to Jessica.
I'm told this guy knew her name.
any chance the call was personal?
not on the emergency line.
and not Jess.
nobody took this job more seriously.
most people last only a couple years, but Jess, she was still going strong after five.
maybe she finally burned out.
I got the call.
911. What's your emergency?
you think you can get away with this?
who is this? -You little bitch.
listen, you can't call me on this line.
you think I'm going to let you screw around with my life, Jessica?
all right, I am hanging up. And if you ever call me again...
when I find you, you're dead, too...
you got a location on that?
Yeah, it came from j&q Technologies on Staten Island.
no extension.
I'll get danny on it. - Would you play that again?
when I find you, you're dead, too.
when I find you, you're dead, too.
when I find you, you're dead, too.
when I find you, you're dead, too.
he asked for her, I asked who it was, but he wouldn't give me his name.
now, tell me, how do you think he knew Jessica's name?
I mean, don't you normally use an operator number to identify yourself?
Yeah, they give us numbers, but sometimes when a person's freaking out, using our name helps calm them down.
did you recognize his voice?
no, but there was a guy yesterday outside the office.
he came looking for her.
there's nothing I could do then.
ten minutes for a java run. I hope there's no line.
I know. - Jessica?
Jessica? -Yeah?
I just wanted you to see her face.
you kept me on hold for five minutes!
remember?
my wife died while we waite for the ambulance to arrive.
I'm really sorry. - You said it was on the way!
don't touch me! - Her name was Janey!
let go! - Help! Help!
are you all right?
with all the stuff we hear, it takes a lot to rattle a 911 operator.
but I guess it's different when someone's right in your face.
all right. And you're sure he said "Janey"?
Yes.
okay. Now, did you see him hanging around later?
no, but do you think he came back and tried to...?
now, did Jessica ever mention the call that this person was referring to?
no.
we answer a few hundred calls a day.
I mean, sometimes there aren't enough operators, and the computer puts the calls on hold.
what happened, it wasn't Jessica's fault.
Hey, the super says she's been living here for six years, always pays on time, doesn't cause any trouble.
apparently, has a thing with building security, and gets really, really upset if any of the residents blocks the front door open.
might explain why she has such a big dog in a little apartment.
well, where's the dog?
Cooper's dead. He was killed three days ago.
I wish she'd come, stayed at my apartment.
maybe this wouldn't have happened.
and how was the dog killed?
someone broke into her apartment and beat him to death.
apparently, your daughter never filed a police report.
of course she did.
we had the police department run her name through their records.
nothing came up.
how did you find out about the dog?
well, I hadn't spoken to her in about a week, and then suddenly in the middle of the night the phone rings.
yes? - Mom?
Jessica? What's wrong?
somebody killed him.
who?
I got home and he's just...
he's just...
honey, are you sure they're gone?
they're not still in your apartment?
he's just lying here on the floor.
they beat him.
honey, how did they get in?
did they- did they break in the door?
did they come through the window?
I don't know.
sweetheart, did you call the police?
no.
all right, then you have to hang up right now and call them.
he looks so small.
what am I going to do now?
honey, honey, I know you're upset, but I need you to call the police right now, okay?
okay.
I called her back and said I was coming over, but she told me not to, said the police were coming.
now, besides the super and Jessica, who else has access to her apartment?
I don't know.
now, why do you think she lied to you about calling the police?
must have been about work.
why do you say that?
because it's the one thing we can't talk about.
Jessica was pre-med at Columbia when she got the internship at the call ceer.
and the next thing I know, she's dropping out of school to become an operator.
I made it clear I didn't approve.
and she never gave you a reason for dropping out?
Oh, I think she just got caught up in helping people.
Hey. -Hey.
did you find anything in her apartment?
that she doesn't have much of a social life.
all right, I'm going to go and...
wait a second, come here, come here.
do you know that we never talked about what happened...?
Yes, I was there. I know what happened, yeah.
it was weird, huh? -A little.
okay, so I just want to make sure that you're okay with how the whole thing went down?
we were just doing our job.
okay, so me dressing like a stripper and making out with you, it's just doing our job?
I'm cool. -Okay, I'm cool, too.
Yeah, but I'm super cool. -I'm super cool, too.
okay.
how'd you do at j&q Technologies?
well, I haven't been able to make a connection between the employees and our missing person.
is there a guy by the name of Nathan Kelly working there?
let me see.
he's not an employee, but they do a lot of outsourcing. Why?
I found out that he's the guy that confronted Jessica at the call center.
911. What's your emergency?
my wife, she's having an allergic reaction.
okay, Sir, are you at 225 Richmond Avenue?
Yes, yes! Please, you've got to hurry! She can't breathe!
an ambulance is on its way. Is your wife conscious?
I've looked everywhere for an EpiPen, but I can't find any!
why don't we have any?
I'm not sure what to do-- it's been a long time since she...since she stopped breathing. Should I... should I...
okay, Sir, my name is Jessica, and I'm going to get you some help but I need you to calm down, okay?
I told you, she can't breathe!
ems is three minutes away.
I already waited five minutes!
Janey? Oh, my god, she let go of my hand.
Janey? Baby, wake up.
sounds like his wife died before the ambulance got there.
which makes him a great suspect, but I don't think he's the guy that called and threatened Jessica at work.
you doing a voice print?
in the process.
and Kelly's on his way in-- so I guess I'll ask him.
I told you, I don't know where she is.
the only time I saw the girl was at the call center.
Mr. Kelly, no one was in control of your wife's death.
I would have been pissed off, too.
you confronting her like that was an overt act of hostility, and it's more than enough to hang you with an assault charge.
I was devastated when my wife died.
I wanted to kill that operator.
after I confronted her
I waited, and I followed her when she came out.
it's ridiculous... oh, god! What the hell?!
I'm sorry. - Idiot!
why are you following me?!
what do you want?
why don't you just leave me alone!
stay away from me!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! We got a problem here, man?
no.
no problem.
good. Why don't you just keep walking.
when she started hitting me,
I saw how scared and vulnerable she was.
it was like looking into my wife's eyes when she died.
so I went home.
is there anyone that can actually verify that you went home and what time you got there?
my son's baby-sitter.
Mr. Kelly, did you see which way Jessica went after your ordeal?
no.
and where were you when she first got out of the cab?
I think it was the corner of 47th and 6th.
well, I- I can't find any credit cards that would explain what she was doing in that neighborhood.
well, not everything I do can be explained by visa.
wait...
did you say 47th and 6th?
Yeah.
you know, three days before she went missing, she handled a call about a shooting on that corner.
that can't be a coincidence that she went back there, right?
Nope.
Yes, of course I remember her.
so, what did she do that made her so memorable?
it's what she didn't do, actually.
well, we can guess, but it'd be much faster if you'd tell us what happened.
she asked to use the bathroom. I said okay.
I'm going downstairs to get more tape for the credit machine.
you watch up front.
what are you doing here? This is private property.
sorry, I thought it was the bathroom.
after all that mess...
she didn't steal anything.
what do you keep back there?
uh, excess inventory, items for repair, my business records.
what about your money, where'd you keep that?
in my safe.
Hey, look, there was a shooting out front four days ago
you know anything about it?
Yeah. I heard about that. We were closed.
it's... very sad.
Yeah. All right, Mr. Ruben, thanks for your time.
anytime.
you know, it feels like she's gone past her expiration date.
the pressure at work, her dog being killed.
I mean, maybe she just flipped out.
Yeah, well, she had to have a reason to trash the place.
she was looking for something, but did she find it?
you know, maybe she did.
Mr. Ruben, uh, the security camera out front, does that work?
Yes. -Okay, where do you keep the tapes?
in my office.
I keep the old ones for a week, and then I use them again.
uh... wha-what day?
Saturday.
it's not here.
Hey, what's up?
we found the store's surveillance tape at Jessica's apartment.
it's of a woman by the name of Amy Wahlberg getting killed.
any connection to our missing person?
none that we know of.
we're synching up the tape now with the 911 call.
here we go.
911. What's your emergency?
uh, my name is Dr. Jeremy Burton.
I'm at the corner of 47th and 6th.
I got a woman here with a... a gsw to the chest.
doesn't appear to be a through-and-through.
you're a doctor?
Yes, ma'am, I am.
I'm losing air out of the entry wound. She might have a pneumothorax.
Hello? Are you still there?
uh, yes, sir.
I am sending a unit to you now.
is the assailant still on the scene?
uh, no.
I think he might have ran north down 6th.
okay. Um, ems is just around the corner.
PD is one minute out.
okay, they should take her to St. Martin's Hospital.
they got the best trauma center in this part of town.
I will alert the E.R. That you are on the way.
Oh, here they come, ma'am. They're here. Thank you so much.
and that's it for the call.
can we get a clearer shot of the mugger's face?
male in his 30s, a tattoo on his neck.
any chance NYPD picked him up?
well, they've got a very good description from one of the bystanders, but they haven't id'd him yet.
we got a pop on some prints from Jessica's apartment.
meet Alejandro Mendoza.
he is a former Bronx Tigres, and he's the main suspect in the murder of a rival gang member.
nice tattoos.
who's she? -The woman you killed.
what?
I didn't kill anybody. - We got it on tape.
is that right? -Yeah, that's right.
you don't remember? It was four nights ago.
no, he was probably too out of it. Right?
I don't touch the stuff.
what about Jessica Lawson's dog?
did Jessica say I did something to him?
we'd love to ask her, but unfortunately she's missing.
and your prints are all over her apartment.
we're friends.
so how do a 911 operator and a gangbanger get to be friends?
because I don't understand.
I decided to go a different way.
now I work at my uncle's botanica.
that's how I met Jess. She came in looking for spiritual protection.
um... what did she need spiritual protection from?
Jess seems... sort of broken.
you know how some people are.
how did you know about the dog?
she called me the other night, asked me to come over to help with his body.
I'm going to get him, ale.
get who?
the guy who did this.
he's not gonna get away with it.
you know who killed Cooper?
Jess, if you know, you need to call the police.
Why? So that they can arrest him and then he gets out on bail?
no, I'll take care of him.
didn't you feel better when your friends killed the guy who shot you?
it didn't make any difference. -I don't believe you.
how was killing that Cholo supposed to change anything?
he's dead, and I'm still a cripple.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'll be fine.
you should come stay with me tonight.
I'll meet you downstairs.
she was pretty messed up. I'm not sure she slept all night.
and she never mentioned who did it?
no.
my guess is, whoever she called from my place the next morning.
they were arguing.
about what? - Cooper.
she saw me listening and shut the door.
I couldn't hear anything after that.
why didn't you ask her about it later?
I jumped in the shower, and when I came out, she was gone.
Mrs. Worth, why were you arguing with Jessica Lawson on the telephone on monday?
I don't know what you're talking about.
our phone records say that she called you, and we have a witness that overheard the argument.
well, I didn't speak to Jessica.
Oh, this is... this is Sue's number.
this is my sister.
why is your sister's phone in your name?
well, she doesn't have a phone of her own, so I put her on my wireless account last year.
is Jessica with her now?
I spoke to Sue this morning. She didn't mention it.
how do they know each other?
they live a block apart.
sue loves jessica's dog so she walks him when Jessica has to work late.
any idea what they've been arguing about?
well, Jessica's helping sue.
she's trying to anyway.
when's he coming home? - Around 6: 00.
then we better get out of here.
let's go.
maybe I'm overreacting.
look in the mirror, Sue.
I'm sure that if I just talk to him we can work it out, and I know he feels worse than I do.
it isn't enough to feel bad about it.
Frank loves me.
no, Frank loves abusing you.
Hey, what's going on?
you didn't tell me we had company.
Jess just stopped by to say hi.
Oh. You taking a trip, honey?
she's gonna stay with me for a couple of days.
let's go.
I shoulda thrown your ass out the first time you came here.
yeah? While why don't you try now?
sue might not call the police, but I will.
come on. - Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
stay away from her.
she actually got her out of there for a couple of nights.
why only a couple?
you know...
she can't live without him any more than he can live without her.
after a couple days apart, he turns on the charm.
he makes a bunch of promises that she forgets he's made before.
they say some girls marry their fathers.
you think I'm going to let you screw around with my life, Jessica?
Yeah, that's him. That's him.
can you write down his address?
sit.
we're clear!
I'll get the paramedic.
you okay?
I'm Jack Malone from the FBI.
you able to talk? -Yeah.
who did this to you?
we're looking for Jessica Lawson.
you know where she is?
no.
I'm fine, really. I just... I tripped.
Really? How many times?
Jessica Lawson is missing.
I know you're trying to protect your husband, but we think he had something to do with it.
Jessica's fine.
and how do you know that?
Frank will be back in a little while and he'll tell you.
Yeah, we have agents posted on both corners.
I'll call you back.
Hey, man, what happened to your hand?
I know you? - Yeah, you're Frank, right?
Yeah, who are you? -FBI. Against the wall.
what's this, a dog bite?
you better get that checked out. Now where's Jessica Lawson?
I don't know. I don't know!
let's go.
you can't arrest Frank. He didn't do anything.
between your sister and the dog bite,
I got more than enough evidence to arrest your husband.
I don't need your testimony.
and if you don't tell me what happened to Jessica,
I'm going to have you arrested for obstruction of justice.
it was me.
I swear.
just kept pushing and pushing, and she was making everything worse, not better.
and I just wanted... I wanted her to stop.
did you give him my key? My alarm code?
how could you do that, sue? I trusted you.
you don't have any proof it was him.
your husband bashed my dog's head in and left him bleeding on my floor.
Frank wouldn't do that. -Why not?
he's done it to you ten times before.
you don't know what you're talking about.
I talk to women like you every day.
their husbands knock them around, but they say, "he didn't mean it," or,"he works too hard,
or maybe they deserved it.
you'll just keep making excuses for him until he kills you.
I'm done talking to you.
you think I don't know what I'm talking about, but I do.
back in college, someone hurt me.
I remember how he hurt me.
I couldn't tell the police either, like it was my fault somehow.
and I still wake up at night and he's right there. I feel him.
and I'm always afraid that he'll hurt me again.
well, then why don't you go deal with that...
and leave us alone.
I never should have listened to her in the first place.
it sounds to me like she was trying to help.
does this look like she's helping?
when we were packing for my sister's, she took something that belonged to my husband.
What'd she take?
his gun.
she made things worse and now you people are doing the same.
I just... why can't you just leave us alone?
it's a little late for that.
okay. Well, thanks very much.
according to his boss at j&q Technologies, they were setting up a network the morning that Jessica disappeared.
hmm, then we have to make sure that the dog-killing felony sticks.
listen, I think I know why Jessica dropped out of college.
her junior year, she was treated for lacerations on her head, neck, chest, and she had cuts all over her hands.
an assault?
did she file a report? -She refused to file one.
maybe she was covering for someone.
you know, it might explain why she was so desperate to help that Sue woman.
she knows what it feels like to be abused.
this one here is Derek Hudson.
he's the one that took her to the health center.
now, according to the report, he's listed as a boyfriend.
I haven't seen Jessica since we broke up and I moved out.
was that before or after she left school?
before.
why did she drop out?
I don't know. -You don't know?
you sure about that?
you see, you took her into the university health center six years ago. She took a pretty bad beating.
I know. -Did you do it?
of course not.
she had defensive wounds.
what, did she try and fight back and you hit her harder?
what?
she didn't report it to the police
maybe too scared to tell them what you did to her.
no, I didn't do anything.
I loved Jessica.
I thought we were going to be married.
but after that night, everything changed.
Oh, my god. Jess, what happened?
I'm fine.
baby, what happened?
I was at that med-pro recruitment event tonight.
and some of us, um...
we got, went and got some drinks after.
there are all these doctors and research scientists there tonight.
they're so smart.
I don't think I'll ever be that smart.
well, why don't you sit down? Let me get you some water.
I guess I didn't eat enough today, 'cause the alcohol hit me really hard.
so, um, well, then, when this one guy offered to give me a ride home,
I said okay.
Oh, my god, Jess.
he drove to some docks.
and I couldn't get away.
I was screaming, but nobody could hear me.
he kept hitting me.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I tried.
I swear that I tried to get away.
what's his name?
I don't... I don't know.
what's his name? Tell me his name! -I don't know!
just...
Oh, god.
Jess, I'm sor...
Jess, come on. please, I'm sorry.
please, open up the door.
I just couldn't stand that someone did that to her.
when did she go to the hospital?
a few hours later.
but it was too late.
she'd washed away all the evidence.
she wouldn't even tell them she was raped.
did she tell you anything about her attacker?
only that he had light hair and a southern accent.
I need to see that surveillance tape again.
hold a sec.
and... there's your perp. - No, keep going.
there.
Hello, are you there?
Yes, sir, I am sending a unit to you now.
is the assailant still on the scene?
no. I don't see him. I think he ran north down sixth.
freeze when he turns around.
she wasn't looking for the mugger.
she was looking for the man who raped her.
Dr. Jeremy Burton.
Yeah. I need to know which hospital he's working at.
well, he's got a local cell phone, so I'm thinking probably the tristate.
Yes, it's urgent.
Burton called the 911 four days ago.
listen, why do you think she waited six years before going after this guy?
I don't know.
maybe it got to the point where she had no choice.
okay, thanks.
according to AMA, Burton's a vascular surgeon at St. Andrews, but they also said that we're not the only ones who have been looking for him.
let's go.
whoa, whoa, whoa. This is for emergencies only.
Hey, you can't park here.
agents Johnson and Fitzgerald, FBI.
what's going on?
we're looking for Dr. Burton.
he just got his car a little while ago.
was he with this woman?
Yeah, they just left.
she had been waiting for him by the exit.
ma'am, if you need to make an appointment you can call my office.
I am not sick. I can't believe that you don't remember me.
I don't know what to tell you.
I guess that special time that we spent together didn't mean that much to a guy like you.
I really think you might have me confused with somebody else.
come on! Med-pro six years ago.
ma'am, I'm very sorry, but I don't know who you are.
I'm sorry.
get in the car.
did you happen to see which way they were headed?
they turned right out of the structure. That's all I saw.
thanks for your help.
if he got into the car without a struggle, she must have had the gun.
what make is his car?
if it's the latest model, it's got to have GPS.
let's hope so.
Viv, you there? - Yeah, any luck?
Yeah, Burton's GPS is giving us a location.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.
what's in Jersey?
Jessica told Derek Hudson that she was raped on the docks.
port Elizabeth.
Yeah. Now, I also looked into the med-pro conference.
Burton wasn't even there.
he was in Malawi on a doctors without borders mission, but there was another guy, a Dr.Rose.
three years ago, he was arrested for sexual assault in Maine.
can we get a picture? - I'll fax it over.
ma'am, I swear to you, I didn't do it.
Yes, you did do it! It was right here!
don't lie to me!
please.
I have a family!
I have a little boy.
FBI. Drop the gun.
he raped me.
Jessica. Put the gun down. You have the wrong guy.
that's what I keep telling her. - Shut up!
Jessica. I know you want justice.
and you deserve it.
but this is not the man that hurt you.
you're wrong. -We looked into it.
Dr. Burton was out of the country in March 2000.
please. I'm begging you.
please, just stop her.
I just want him to admit what he did to me.
but he can't, because he didn't do it.
I know its hard for you to believe me.
he did it.
but if you're going to shoot him, you want to be sure, right?
besides the southern accent, what else do you remember?
I don't know. - Come on, Jessica, anything.
what color was his hair?
how tall was he? How fat?
I don't remember.
what about the crease in his pants?
the pattern on his shirt?
please.
all right.
I'm going to show you something, okay?
now, I've got the picture of a man, and I want you to tell me if you recognize him.
I'm going to put my gun away, and I'm going to bring it over there for you.
now, did the man who raped you have a scar above his eye?
Dr. Burton doesn't have a scar above his eye.
not that I can see, anyway.
that's Dr. Rose.
he was at the med-pro conference as well, but now he's in prison for raping another woman.
I was so sure it was him.
I know.
Oh, please stop! It hurts!
stop! Stop!
stop!
be gone!
stay far from this creature of god, for it is he who commands you.
Oh, it hurts!
the majestic Christ who commands you.
stop!
the mystery of the cross commands you!
Oh! Please stop! It hurts!
the blood of the martyrs commands you. - Stop!
give praise to the holy spirit, by this sign of the holy cross, - in the name of our lord Jesus Christ. - stop!
stop!
sleep now.
4 HOURSE MISSING
exorcism? As in spinning heads and pea soup?
the last time the girl's family saw her, she was actually being strapped down for the ritual.
the ritual. Come on.
so what's the profile on the possessed girl?
well, apparently you know her.
I do?
recognize her?
no, but I recognize that dork.
Yeah, this was my last day at white collar, before I came over to missing persons.
so what's her name?
Katie Duncan. She did a summer internship there in '02.
man, I do not remember her.
well, her brother asked for you by name, said that she'd mentioned you.
hm. Who was the last person to see her?
the priest.
police responded to screams.
by the time they got there, he'd long gone.
probably wanted to avoid them after his last run-in with them.
what kind of run-in?
the suspicion-of-murder kind.
a Brooklyn man died last year while undergoing an exorcism performed by the same priest.
and where is he now? - Nobody's seen or heard from him.
Yeah. Here's Millie from payroll and Dave from security. I remember most of these people.
I just have no idea who she is.
5 HOURSE MISSING
and when was the last time you actually saw father Mcguinness?
um... we must have fallen asleep around 4: 00.
he left without waking us.
you think he did something to her.
we're looking into it.
now, um, has Katie ever just up and left home before?
uh, Katie's mentally ill.
she lives on a very regimented schedule.
we have to know where she is all the time.
right. Was she seeing a psychiatrist?
Dr. Feller.
she takes the train into the city twice a week to see her.
but... she's been in all kinds of therapy since she was a kid.
and what did her doctor think the diagnosis was?
which one?
we've been seeing six different doctors.
they all have different opinions.
which we've been told is actually pretty common.
look, forgive my-my bluntness, but given her condition, why did you let her have an exorcism in the first place?
the exorcism was Katie's idea.
she asked to see a priest. So of course I said yes.
but...
what led you to believe that she was possessed?
Katie... felt like there was something dark inside her, something only god could take away.
the last few days, she's been even more scared, crying all the time.
she just wanted somebody to help her.
I just think we should hear what father Mcguinness has to say.
this is... beyond everything, Katie-- this is not a solution.
how do you know?!
I mean, you don't know what it's like in here, going to sleep every night hoping that I'll wake up better, and I don't.
I wake up and everything's the same, and I just want it to stop, and nobody's doing anything!
nobody's doing anything? - Hey.
Mr. Duncan, you have to understand that Katie's problems are not mental, they are spiritual.
only god can cast that evil out.
no offense, father, but there are people with medical degrees who are a little more qualified to say what's wrong with my sister.
no offense, but none of those medical degrees is doing your sister any good.
well, we just... we-we just need to keep trying.
I don't want to keep trying.
please, I want to do this.
please, mom.
I just... I want it to stop.
what harm can it do?
I shouldn't have gone along with it.
was there anyone that Katie may have run off to?
friends, extended family?
no.
my husband died in '93, and we really don't have any other family around here.
she didn't have any friends, just us.
okay, I'm gonna need the phone number for the parish priest, as well as Dr. Feller.
of course. Excuse me. - Yeah, go ahead.
thanks for coming by so fast. - Oh, no problem.
Katie said you were always really nice to her.
well, uh...
she was always easy to be nice to.
what do you think? - What do you think?
well, it's big.
and it's, you know, it's ten minutes from work...
you hate it.
it's, uh...
it's old.
honey, we can't afford new.
I mean, look at this rug, Jack.
I mean, there's generations of germs growing in this thing.
you can't put a baby down on it.
honey, you pull it up. There's probably hardwood floors underneath.
holes in the walls. - Spackle.
and then that linoleum in that bathroom-- that is disgusting.
I mean, they should be ashamed.
you know what? Let's just go.
wait. Do you like it?
look, we're not gonna buy a place that you don't like.
I didn't say I don't like it.
look, I asked you if you hated it, you didn't say no.
I just think we should maybe wait and find someplace with a little less history.
okay.
let's go. - Let's go.
7 HOURSE MISSING
I know that Katie was frustrated with her treatment, but an exorcism?
why frustrated?
Katie had a lot of... different symptoms
depression, mania, even occasional glimpses of psychosis.
would she hurt herself?
no, I doubt it.
Katie wanted the husband, the kid, the white picket fence.
she lived for the future. I don't think that she'd give that up.
and how long have you been seeing her?
I treated her for about a year.
treated? Past tense?
well, she stopped coming to her appointments about two months ago.
and did you call the family, tell them that she was missing sessions?
she's an adult-- I can't call her family just because she won't obey my wishes.
right. And have you seen her since?
heard from her last week. She sounded unwell.
so I stopped by her house to see her.
is he gone? - Is who gone?
the man. The man that was there. Is he gone?
there's nobody out there, Katie.
let's talk about your meds.
Why? They don't work.
they don't do anything.
I'm tired and I'm nauseous, and the voices are still there.
then we'll up your dosage.
or we'll change your cocktail.
I'm gonna write you a new prescription.
Yeah, but none of them work.
they just... they sit there like little rocks, and you can skip them.
you can skip them all day. You can skip them on the surface of the water.
what's going on with you, Katie?
I'm just afraid if I have kids, they're going to be like me.
well, there's a chance that your kids can inherit some of your mood problems
but it's treatable, just like yours, with the right medication.
so say I take your pills, say I do everything that you tell me to do.
so am I going to be normal?
you're going to be better.
we made an appointment after that, but she never kept it.
well, she said that there was a man standing outside her house.
did you see him?
Katie had paranoid tendencies.
it wasn't unusual for her to have persecution fantasies.
are you absolutely positive nobody was outside her house?
well, I didn't see anyone.
but I can't say that I'm absolutely positive.
7 DAYS BERORE DISAPPEAR SEES SOME OUTSIDE HOUSE
Martin. All right, we just finished the canvass of Katie's neighborhood.
we found a lady who says she saw a man parked outside of Katie's house for a couple days in a row last week, including the day Dr. Feller was there.
she get a good look at the guy?
Yeah, she's going to come in and talk to a sketch artist.
you talk to the family?
Yeah, yeah, they have no idea what she was doing in the city on the days of her appointments.
maybe she was checking out a Voodoo doctor on the side.
sounds like someone thinks this whole exorcism thing is a load of crap.
pretty much, yeah.
wait a minute, I thought you were raised catholic.
I was. Look... I'm all for surrendering to a higher power.
I just don't believe in all this hocus-pocus.
well, I've seen this hocus-pocus stuff work.
back home, there's this lady named Matilde La Loca.
she's crazy, man, speaks in tongues, her eyes roll back, the whole thing.
one day she came up to me, she's like "Danny Taylor, you're going to die.
she scared the hell out of me.
then she went and she spent two days with padre De Pio.
she came back brand new.
it's called the power of suggestion.
did the power of suggestion make her hair turn white overnight?
maybe it was an evil spirit.
all I'm saying is we don't know everything about everything.
once in a while you have to take a leap and believe.
well, I believe you don't know everything.
Yeah, well, that's what you're choosing to believe.
all right, thanks.
we just caught our friendly neighborhood exorcist trying to hop a flight to Mexico.
good news is, we're bringing him in.
bad news is, we're bringing him in with a lawyer from the archdiocese.
the church in no way supports father Mcguinness's actions or his methods.
this is an independent and unsanctioned member of the clergy.
if I was taking notes, I'd write that down.
other than soft extradition laws, father, what's in Mexico?
a conference which I've been scheduled to speak at for over a month.
was that before or after you decided to kill Katie Duncan?
I didn't harm Katie.
the last time I saw her, she was asleep in her bed.
the demon had been cast out of her.
so the exorcism worked.
I believe so.
like the one in Brooklyn.
is that what happened?
you have another dead body on your hands, you had to cover your ass.
father Mcguinness was cleared of any wrongdoing in that case.
you know, if you wanted to cooperate, you could show me those videotapes of Katie's exorcism.
you made tapes?
those tapes are protected by clergy privilege. They are private.
I'll make that determination.
you'll get the tapes after we've had a chance to review them.
review or alter?
you'll hear from us in a few hours.
can't wait.
father Mcguinness.
wouldn't make any plans to go to Cancun if I were you.
I'll need to talk to you soon.
we can't wait for the tapes. They could be destroying evidence of the murder as we speak.
I can subpoena the tapes.
but the church can argue that the tapes are protected by clergy privilege, and that way we'd be out of luck.
it was an exorcism. There was no confessional seal to be broken.
I agree. But the judge could also argue that it's privileged communication.
which we could appeal. But that would take weeks.
we don't have weeks.
Jack, every time you deal with the church doesn't mean you're going to run into a conspiracy.
look, I think I know these people better than you.
that's true, but I don't have a massive chip on my shoulder.
look, just subpoena the tapes, okay?
as soon as humanly possible.
I contacted the realtor.
she's sending over some new listings.
look, everybody in New York wants a brand-new apartment.
but I might be the only one who believes in the apartment as a metaphor for a relationship thing.
as long as you're happy.
it scares me when you're reasonable.
I'll call you when I get any information, yeah?
thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you; I know you're busy.
no, no problem. Um, what can I do for you?
anything on father mcguinness?
well, we talked to him, and we're checking into his story, but, uh, we're also checking into a man who was seen outside your house last week.
did Katie happen to mention anyone following her?
no.
but it's not like she hasn't before.
they're never real.
um, we also found a bank account in Katie's name here in the city.
seems like she's been depositing about $100 a week for the past eight weeks.
Katie did not have a job, is that correct?
she hasn't been able to work in over four years.
but I had a feeling she might have been getting money from somewhere.
knock, knock, who's there? - Sorry.
Hey, it's 4: 00 A. M.
I'm not tired.
you haven't slept in three days.
that's because I feel too good to sleep.
how do I look?
you look great. - You know, I have to agree.
how'd you pay for the dress?
I just sold some things, okay?
what things?
what is your problem?
I don't believe you is my problem. Did you get a job?
no.
you know mom and I don't think you're ready to go back to work.
Yeah, I know what you think.
but I'm a grown woman; I'm not a child anymore.
I know that. But you can't just do everything you want.
I mean, you can't just get dressed up and go to clubs to meet guys.
you know what?
maybe I will go out and I'll meet somebody, and we'll get married, and we'll move really far away from here, and then people here will stop looking at me and thinking I'm a freak!
nobody thinks you're a freak.
now I don't believe you.
I should have just let her have her moment.
she was happy for once.
a couple of days later, she did a complete 180.
um, do you have any idea who she might have been dressing up for?
no.
she hadn't gone on a date since college.
that's a long time. - She'd like to.
but she knows it's going to take someone pretty special to be able to deal with her... issues.
right.
I guess she's just waiting for Mr. Right.
aren't we all?
fine, all right, you're a genius. Okay, you happy? I said it.
let me call you back. Okay, bye.
who's the genius?
she lucked out.
the judge agreed to give us all of Katie's exorcism tapes.
Oh,good.
well, we tracked her deposits to an ATM next to the pre firm where she worked four years ago.
the last couple of months she's been delivering lunches there.
so what, you think she's tangled up in the dangerous world of food delivery?
well, it's a dangerous world of something. About a week ago , an exec by the name of Tracy Harrison was murdered.
she had her head bashed in with a fire extinguisher in the office garage.
11 HOURSE MISSING
I still can't believe what happened to Tracy.
she was here a week ago and then just like that...
did Tracy and Katie deal with a lot of the same people?
not really. Katie's only here a couple hours a week.
she mostly just deals with me.
so you know about her condition?
Yeah, she confided in me back then. That's why she left.
why did you rehire her?
you knew she was unstable.
well, she wasn't really looking for a career.
she just wanted to feel normal.
I have a niece who's bipolar, so I kind of know what it's like for Katie.
um, I made up something I thought she could handle.
which was what, exactly?
she brings in takeout twice a week.
everybody throws in a couple extra bucks.
it's a delivery charge.
never seen anybody so grateful for such a trivial job.
when was the last time you saw her?
she came to my office a couple of days before Tracy died.
tell me what's going on.
I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
Katie, come on, you've got to tell me.
otherwise, I'm just going to have to fire everybody.
tell me what happened.
I was bringing lunch in today.
something smells good.
Oh, it's Thai food from Bangkok grill.
no, no, it's not that.
it's you. What is that perfume?
Prell. It's shampoo. It's, um, green.
your cologne is very good.
it's called Vodka gimlet.
you ever been to bistro on fifth?
no.
they make the best gimlets. We should go sometime.
Yeah, you know, I don't really drink.
Oh, come on, everybody drinks sometimes.
stop.
can I see you in my office?
come on, Tracy, I... - Now, George.
are you okay?
sorry.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
look, I'm going to try harder.
I promise, I'm never going to be a problem again.
no, it's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll take care of it.
事实证明，我不需要照顾任何事情。
Tracy fired George right then and there.
and Katie came back to work?
even after the whole George thing?
she was supposed to come back that Friday
the day after Tracy died, but she didn't.
I assumed it had something to do with that.
did you tell the police about George?
Yeah, the whole office did.
I mean, I heard they interviewed him, but they haven't arrested him yet.
8 DAYS BERORE DISAPPEARSEXVALLY HARASSED AT WORK
two drunken disorderly, two domestic violence, no convictions.
the police liked him for the Tracy Harrison murder, but they didn't have enough evidence.
it's a hell of a motive. How hard they look?
well, no identifiable prints, no witness putting George at the scene.
if George killed Tracy for firing him, it's likely that he went looking for Katie.
well, he did-- a neighbor id'd him from his photo.
so she wasn't imagining a man outside her house.
do we know where he is? - We're looking.
Jack, I need you to listen to something.
okay, thanks.
stop! - For it is he who commands you.
get away from her!
does Mcguinness ever get rough with her?
no, but listen to this. Go ahead and isolate Katie's voice and back it up.
one sec, I got to filter out the lower frequencies.
sorry.
you're killing her! Stop!
stop!
you're killing her. - Okay, stop.
doesn't that sound less like someone who is possessed and more like someone who is describing a murder?
where was she the night that Tracy Harrison was killed?
we're not sure, but she asked for the exorcism the day after the murder.
you know, her mother said that she kept having these visions.
I don't think she was hallucinating. 
I think that she may have witnessed Tracy Harrison's murder.
12 HOURSE MISSING
I've never seen him.
one of your neighbors said they saw him outside your house.
Katie never mentioned someone following her?
no.
did she ever say anything about witnessing a crime?
Why?
well, a woman was killed at Katie's work.
we think she may have witnessed that happening, which might have something to do with her seeking out the exorcism.
if she saw something, she wouldn't have told me.
I would have just told her to go take her pills.
I... I don't know.
maybe she did and I... and i just wasn't paying attention.
did she say anything at all to you that seemed unusual?
understand, it's all unusual.
you never know what's going to come out of her mouth.
when she was little, we used to talk about boys and school and who was mean and who was nice.
the last few years it's all about psychic mind control.
pharmaceutical conspiracies.
it's exhausting.
I don't know how many times she's woken me up in the middle of the night.
and I want to listen. I want to be a good mother.
but this stuff coming out of her mouth, it just doesn't make any sense.
she's just been sick for so long.
I'm just so tired.
great. Great, great, great. All right, thank you.
Hey. I was just coming to see you.
NYPD just arrested George Lewis coming out of a bar.
Oh, well, if you're going to ask me about those videotapes,
I don't think they're going to help you... at all.
Yeah, but they constitute supporting evidence, if we extract a confession from him.
that's a big "if." Because without it, it won't hold up in court.
sorry, sorry, sorry. Did you say extract a confession?
no.
so, uh, I'll see you tonight? - Okay.
should we meet at our place?
what do you mean our place?
I called the realtor on the loft.
we are in escrow.
we are? On that dump?
I took another look, and there is nothing wrong with that apartment that can't be fixed with a little bit of work.
good?
so I'll see you there? - Sure.
I'll bring the spackle.
why am I here?
you nervous?
Yes.
you're not nervous because of me, are you?
I mean, guys like you push girls like me around, right?
I told the cops, I didn't touch Tracy.
well, you're not here because of Tracy.
you're here because of Katie Duncan.
the lunch girl from the office?
I barely know her.
well, apparently that didn't stop you from trying to feel her up, did it?
where is she?
I haven't seen her.
not since that day at work.
you saw her two days after that day at work.
see, her neighbors id'd you from your photo。
lie to me again, George.
come on.
I went to her house. I just went to talk.
you don't open this door, I'm just going to come back tomorrow and the day after and the day after.
I have no job, remember?
what, what do you want?
I want you to tell Buchanan to give me my job back.
just go away, okay. Please?
not until you say you'll talk to him.
what am I supposed to say?
just tell him that it was blown out of proportion.
it was all a big misunderstanding. Whatever.
just tell him that we're cool now and he should give me my job back.
I can't just tell Chris what to do.
sure you can. He'll listen to you.
no, I'm the lunch girl.
come on, seriously? You haven't noticed?
noticed what? - He's crazy about you.
look, he's the boss. He can't ask you out, but everybody knows he wants to.
he respects your opinion. He'll listen to you.
so be a good girl, please.
help me out.
I knew she had a thing for Buchanan.
I figured it was a good angle.
did Buchanan really have a thing for her?
I don't know.
but she was like a puppy.
he could have done her anytime he wanted.
you know what, George, that's a really interesting story.
here's the thing. You had motive, you had opportunity.
right now, you're my best suspect.
what makes you think I would believe that you didn't hurt Katie?
I needed her to go to Buchanan and get my job back.
if I hurt her, how is that going to help me do that, hmm? 
great, thanks.
Hey, I've been looking for you.
george Lewis's alibi checks out. He was on a flight from Chicago.
well, I just looked into Buchanan's financials.
last week he bought a $20, 000 engagement ring, had it engraved "for "Tracy, with all my love.
he never told us he was having a relationship with Tracy Harrison.
keeping an office romance a secret, imagine that.
Buchanan picked up the ring the morning that Tracy was killed, but they never found it on her.
so maybe he hadn't proposed yet.
maybe he did.
she said no and he couldn't handle the rejection.
so he beats her to death? Seems a little extreme.
it could be what Katie saw. I think it's worth checking into.
I'll catch up with you later.
14 HOURSE MISSING
Buchanan's not home and the neighbors haven't seen him all day.
isaiah here says he saw him about an hour ago.
Taylor. Tell him what you told me.
he was with a girl. I heard him screaming.
I went over to get a good look.
let go of me! WHAT YOU SAY?
don't touch me! Katie. Katie...
Hey, what's going on over there?
Hey, what's going on over here?
did you talk to him?
no, he got into a car and booked it after her, before I could get close.
all right, thank you.
that was Buchanan's office. He got into a car wreck. No sign of Katie.
can I get a phone call?
Why? Do you need a lawyer? - You tell me.
no, you tell us where Katie Duncan is, and then you can leave.
I told the other guy I don't know where she is.
then why were you chasing her?
did you go after her because she saw what you did to Tracy Harrison?
I didn't do anything to Tracy.
no? Then where were you the night she was killed?
I was at my place, waiting for her, with an engagement ring and a bottle of champagne.
so then why did Katie come to see you tonight?
I don't know. She wasn't making a lot of sense.
what YOU DOING HERE ?
I, uh...
I just wanted to see you.
have you been here all day? It's freezing.
I was just waiting for you to come home.
your family has been looking everywhere for you. They're really worried.
they're always worried.
but it's okay.
they don't have to worry about me anymore.
come on, let me give you a ride, okay?
no, I'm...
I'm exactly where I want to be.
look... I'm going to take you home.
Oh, my god. Katie.
everything is going to be all right.
look, I'm going to take you to the hospital, okay?
No! - Yes, you need help.
no, I do not need help. I'm fine!
you are not fine. Listen to me.
did you know that the FBI is looking for you?
Why?
they think that whoever attacked Tracy may have hurt you, too.
what happened to Tracy?
someone assaulted her at work last week and she died.
you were there.
Katie, what are you talking about?
I saw you.
you were kissing her. You said something.
I couldn't hear you.
and then you left.
she thought she was alone.
wait, wait, how do you know that?
because she wasn't alone. I was there, too.
what did you see?
I remember her face.
did you see who killed her?
let go of me!
what did you see? Did you see who killed her?
let me go! Get off of me.
Hey, what's going on over there?!
the newsstand vendor said that he saw you go after her.
I didn't know what to do, so I got in my car and I tried to find her.
I wasn't really looking where I was going, so I plowed into a garbage truck.
did you happen to see where she went?
no.
what I'm saying is, he lied to the police, and he's lying to us.
all right, but why place himself at the crime scene if he's guilty?
so he can blame it on a crazy girl who's conveniently missing.
look, Katie told George Lewis that she would go see Buchanan.
and she's the only one who can place Buchanan and Tracy together in the parking garage.
if she thought she could have a life with this guy, seeing him with another woman may have pushed her over the edge.
she snapped, grabbed the fire extinguisher, and killed Tracy.
and what, the devil makes her do it?
you know, maybe she really believed that.
because it's the only way she can make sense of what she did.
she needed the exorcism to make it all go away.
which works until Buchanan reminded her of the murder.
right.
I'll tell you, if exorcism was her last resort, and that didn't work,
I don't even want to think about where she goes after that.
well, we got the police on an alert. If they hear from her they'll call us.
agent Fitzgerald.
agent Fitzgerald, it's Laura Duncan.
Yeah, Mrs. Duncan, how can I help you?
she's home. Katie's home.
she just walked in the front door and she's fine.
okay. She's home. We need pd over there right away.
Mrs. Duncan, I need to know where Katie is right now. Is she with you?
Yeah, she's upstairs.
she said she was just really tired and wanted to go to sleep.
all right, listen to me. I need you to go upstairs and stay with her.
Why? What's wrong?
just keep an eye on her until we get there, okay?
she's not in her room.
Katie! - Come on.
look, just find her, okay?
I think she's taking a shower.
Mrs. Duncan, talk to me.
Mrs. Duncan, talk to me.
Katie, honey!
tough case.
it's closed.
how's Katie's family?
you know, I never did remember her.
I tried, but...
but, you know.
I'll see you in the morning. You take care.
all right.
good night. - Good night.
excuse me. Um, what's your name again?
Bonnie. Bonnie, that's right.
I'm Martin.
Yeah.
well, um, you have a good night.
good night. - Bye.
hello.
Hey.
what are you doing?
enjoying the view.
wondering what would happen if I dropped a penny.
why is it so dark in here?
I don't think lightbulbs were included in the price.
I'm not surprised.
do you want to dance?
would I kill the moment if I said no?
Oh, please stop! It hurts!
stop! Stop!
stop!
be gone!
stay far from this creature of god, for it is he who commands you.
Oh, it hurts!
the majestic Christ who commands you.
stop!
the mystery of the cross commands you!
Oh! Please stop! It hurts!
the blood of the martyrs commands you. - Stop!
give praise to the holy spirit, by this sign of the holy cross, - in the name of our lord Jesus Christ. - stop!
stop!
sleep now.
4 HOURSE MISSING
exorcism? As in spinning heads and pea soup?
the last time the girl's family saw her, she was actually being strapped down for the ritual.
the ritual. Come on.
so what's the profile on the possessed girl?
well, apparently you know her.
I do?
recognize her?
no, but I recognize that dork.
Yeah, this was my last day at white collar, before I came over to missing persons.
so what's her name?
Katie Duncan. She did a summer internship there in '02.
man, I do not remember her.
well, her brother asked for you by name, said that she'd mentioned you.
hm. Who was the last person to see her?
the priest.
police responded to screams.
by the time they got there, he'd long gone.
probably wanted to avoid them after his last run-in with them.
what kind of run-in?
the suspicion-of-murder kind.
a Brooklyn man died last year while undergoing an exorcism performed by the same priest.
and where is he now? - Nobody's seen or heard from him.
Yeah. Here's Millie from payroll and Dave from security. I remember most of these people.
I just have no idea who she is.
5 HOURSE MISSING
and when was the last time you actually saw father Mcguinness?
um... we must have fallen asleep around 4: 00.
he left without waking us.
you think he did something to her.
we're looking into it.
now, um, has Katie ever just up and left home before?
uh, Katie's mentally ill.
she lives on a very regimented schedule.
we have to know where she is all the time.
right. Was she seeing a psychiatrist?
Dr. Feller.
she takes the train into the city twice a week to see her.
but... she's been in all kinds of therapy since she was a kid.
and what did her doctor think the diagnosis was?
which one?
we've been seeing six different doctors.
they all have different opinions.
which we've been told is actually pretty common.
look, forgive my-my bluntness, but given her condition, why did you let her have an exorcism in the first place?
the exorcism was Katie's idea.
she asked to see a priest. So of course I said yes.
but...
what led you to believe that she was possessed?
Katie... felt like there was something dark inside her, something only god could take away.
the last few days, she's been even more scared, crying all the time.
she just wanted somebody to help her.
I just think we should hear what father Mcguinness has to say.
this is... beyond everything, Katie-- this is not a solution.
how do you know?!
I mean, you don't know what it's like in here, going to sleep every night hoping that I'll wake up better, and I don't.
I wake up and everything's the same, and I just want it to stop, and nobody's doing anything!
nobody's doing anything? - Hey.
Mr. Duncan, you have to understand that Katie's problems are not mental, they are spiritual.
only god can cast that evil out.
no offense, father, but there are people with medical degrees who are a little more qualified to say what's wrong with my sister.
no offense, but none of those medical degrees is doing your sister any good.
well, we just... we-we just need to keep trying.
I don't want to keep trying.
please, I want to do this.
please, mom.
I just... I want it to stop.
what harm can it do?
I shouldn't have gone along with it.
was there anyone that Katie may have run off to?
friends, extended family?
no.
my husband died in '93, and we really don't have any other family around here.
she didn't have any friends, just us.
okay, I'm gonna need the phone number for the parish priest, as well as Dr. Feller.
of course. Excuse me. - Yeah, go ahead.
thanks for coming by so fast. - Oh, no problem.
Katie said you were always really nice to her.
well, uh...
she was always easy to be nice to.
what do you think? - What do you think?
well, it's big.
and it's, you know, it's ten minutes from work...
you hate it.
it's, uh...
it's old.
honey, we can't afford new.
I mean, look at this rug, Jack.
I mean, there's generations of germs growing in this thing.
you can't put a baby down on it.
honey, you pull it up. There's probably hardwood floors underneath.
holes in the walls. - Spackle.
and then that linoleum in that bathroom-- that is disgusting.
I mean, they should be ashamed.
you know what? Let's just go.
wait. Do you like it?
look, we're not gonna buy a place that you don't like.
I didn't say I don't like it.
look, I asked you if you hated it, you didn't say no.
I just think we should maybe wait and find someplace with a little less history.
okay.
let's go. - Let's go.
7 HOURSE MISSING
I know that Katie was frustrated with her treatment, but an exorcism?
why frustrated?
Katie had a lot of... different symptoms
depression, mania, even occasional glimpses of psychosis.
would she hurt herself?
no, I doubt it.
Katie wanted the husband, the kid, the white picket fence.
she lived for the future. I don't think that she'd give that up.
and how long have you been seeing her?
I treated her for about a year.
treated? Past tense?
well, she stopped coming to her appointments about two months ago.
and did you call the family, tell them that she was missing sessions?
she's an adult-- I can't call her family just because she won't obey my wishes.
right. And have you seen her since?
heard from her last week. She sounded unwell.
so I stopped by her house to see her.
is he gone? - Is who gone?
the man. The man that was there. Is he gone?
there's nobody out there, Katie.
let's talk about your meds.
Why? They don't work.
they don't do anything.
I'm tired and I'm nauseous, and the voices are still there.
then we'll up your dosage.
or we'll change your cocktail.
I'm gonna write you a new prescription.
Yeah, but none of them work.
they just... they sit there like little rocks, and you can skip them.
you can skip them all day. You can skip them on the surface of the water.
what's going on with you, Katie?
I'm just afraid if I have kids, they're going to be like me.
well, there's a chance that your kids can inherit some of your mood problems
but it's treatable, just like yours, with the right medication.
so say I take your pills, say I do everything that you tell me to do.
so am I going to be normal?
you're going to be better.
we made an appointment after that, but she never kept it.
well, she said that there was a man standing outside her house.
did you see him?
Katie had paranoid tendencies.
it wasn't unusual for her to have persecution fantasies.
are you absolutely positive nobody was outside her house?
well, I didn't see anyone.
but I can't say that I'm absolutely positive.
7 DAYS BERORE DISAPPEAR SEES SOME OUTSIDE HOUSE
Martin. All right, we just finished the canvass of Katie's neighborhood.
we found a lady who says she saw a man parked outside of Katie's house for a couple days in a row last week, including the day Dr. Feller was there.
she get a good look at the guy?
Yeah, she's going to come in and talk to a sketch artist.
you talk to the family?
Yeah, yeah, they have no idea what she was doing in the city on the days of her appointments.
maybe she was checking out a Voodoo doctor on the side.
sounds like someone thinks this whole exorcism thing is a load of crap.
pretty much, yeah.
wait a minute, I thought you were raised catholic.
I was. Look... I'm all for surrendering to a higher power.
I just don't believe in all this hocus-pocus.
well, I've seen this hocus-pocus stuff work.
back home, there's this lady named Matilde La Loca.
she's crazy, man, speaks in tongues, her eyes roll back, the whole thing.
one day she came up to me, she's like "Danny Taylor, you're going to die.
she scared the hell out of me.
then she went and she spent two days with padre De Pio.
she came back brand new.
it's called the power of suggestion.
did the power of suggestion make her hair turn white overnight?
maybe it was an evil spirit.
all I'm saying is we don't know everything about everything.
once in a while you have to take a leap and believe.
well, I believe you don't know everything.
Yeah, well, that's what you're choosing to believe.
all right, thanks.
we just caught our friendly neighborhood exorcist trying to hop a flight to Mexico.
good news is, we're bringing him in.
bad news is, we're bringing him in with a lawyer from the archdiocese.
the church in no way supports father Mcguinness's actions or his methods.
this is an independent and unsanctioned member of the clergy.
if I was taking notes, I'd write that down.
other than soft extradition laws, father, what's in Mexico?
a conference which I've been scheduled to speak at for over a month.
was that before or after you decided to kill Katie Duncan?
I didn't harm Katie.
the last time I saw her, she was asleep in her bed.
the demon had been cast out of her.
so the exorcism worked.
I believe so.
like the one in Brooklyn.
is that what happened?
you have another dead body on your hands, you had to cover your ass.
father Mcguinness was cleared of any wrongdoing in that case.
you know, if you wanted to cooperate, you could show me those videotapes of Katie's exorcism.
you made tapes?
those tapes are protected by clergy privilege. They are private.
I'll make that determination.
you'll get the tapes after we've had a chance to review them.
review or alter?
you'll hear from us in a few hours.
can't wait.
father Mcguinness.
wouldn't make any plans to go to Cancun if I were you.
I'll need to talk to you soon.
we can't wait for the tapes. They could be destroying evidence of the murder as we speak.
I can subpoena the tapes.
but the church can argue that the tapes are protected by clergy privilege, and that way we'd be out of luck.
it was an exorcism. There was no confessional seal to be broken.
I agree. But the judge could also argue that it's privileged communication.
which we could appeal. But that would take weeks.
we don't have weeks.
Jack, every time you deal with the church doesn't mean you're going to run into a conspiracy.
look, I think I know these people better than you.
that's true, but I don't have a massive chip on my shoulder.
look, just subpoena the tapes, okay?
as soon as humanly possible.
I contacted the realtor.
she's sending over some new listings.
look, everybody in New York wants a brand-new apartment.
but I might be the only one who believes in the apartment as a metaphor for a relationship thing.
as long as you're happy.
it scares me when you're reasonable.
I'll call you when I get any information, yeah?
thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you; I know you're busy.
no, no problem. Um, what can I do for you?
anything on father mcguinness?
well, we talked to him, and we're checking into his story, but, uh, we're also checking into a man who was seen outside your house last week.
did Katie happen to mention anyone following her?
no.
but it's not like she hasn't before.
they're never real.
um, we also found a bank account in Katie's name here in the city.
seems like she's been depositing about $100 a week for the past eight weeks.
Katie did not have a job, is that correct?
she hasn't been able to work in over four years.
but I had a feeling she might have been getting money from somewhere.
knock, knock, who's there? - Sorry.
Hey, it's 4: 00 A. M.
I'm not tired.
you haven't slept in three days.
that's because I feel too good to sleep.
how do I look?
you look great. - You know, I have to agree.
how'd you pay for the dress?
I just sold some things, okay?
what things?
what is your problem?
I don't believe you is my problem. Did you get a job?
no.
you know mom and I don't think you're ready to go back to work.
Yeah, I know what you think.
but I'm a grown woman; I'm not a child anymore.
I know that. But you can't just do everything you want.
I mean, you can't just get dressed up and go to clubs to meet guys.
you know what?
maybe I will go out and I'll meet somebody, and we'll get married, and we'll move really far away from here, and then people here will stop looking at me and thinking I'm a freak!
nobody thinks you're a freak.
now I don't believe you.
I should have just let her have her moment.
she was happy for once.
a couple of days later, she did a complete 180.
um, do you have any idea who she might have been dressing up for?
no.
she hadn't gone on a date since college.
that's a long time. - She'd like to.
but she knows it's going to take someone pretty special to be able to deal with her... issues.
right.
I guess she's just waiting for Mr. Right.
aren't we all?
fine, all right, you're a genius. Okay, you happy? I said it.
let me call you back. Okay, bye.
who's the genius?
she lucked out.
the judge agreed to give us all of Katie's exorcism tapes.
Oh,good.
well, we tracked her deposits to an ATM next to the pre firm where she worked four years ago.
the last couple of months she's been delivering lunches there.
so what, you think she's tangled up in the dangerous world of food delivery?
well, it's a dangerous world of something. About a week ago , an exec by the name of Tracy Harrison was murdered.
she had her head bashed in with a fire extinguisher in the office garage.
11 HOURSE MISSING
I still can't believe what happened to Tracy.
she was here a week ago and then just like that...
did Tracy and Katie deal with a lot of the same people?
not really. Katie's only here a couple hours a week.
she mostly just deals with me.
so you know about her condition?
Yeah, she confided in me back then. That's why she left.
why did you rehire her?
you knew she was unstable.
well, she wasn't really looking for a career.
she just wanted to feel normal.
I have a niece who's bipolar, so I kind of know what it's like for Katie.
um, I made up something I thought she could handle.
which was what, exactly?
she brings in takeout twice a week.
everybody throws in a couple extra bucks.
it's a delivery charge.
never seen anybody so grateful for such a trivial job.
when was the last time you saw her?
she came to my office a couple of days before Tracy died.
tell me what's going on.
I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
Katie, come on, you've got to tell me.
otherwise, I'm just going to have to fire everybody.
tell me what happened.
I was bringing lunch in today.
something smells good.
Oh, it's Thai food from Bangkok grill.
no, no, it's not that.
it's you. What is that perfume?
Prell. It's shampoo. It's, um, green.
your cologne is very good.
it's called Vodka gimlet.
you ever been to bistro on fifth?
no.
they make the best gimlets. We should go sometime.
Yeah, you know, I don't really drink.
Oh, come on, everybody drinks sometimes.
stop.
can I see you in my office?
come on, Tracy, I... - Now, George.
are you okay?
sorry.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
look, I'm going to try harder.
I promise, I'm never going to be a problem again.
no, it's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll take care of it.
事实证明，我不需要照顾任何事情。
Tracy fired George right then and there.
and Katie came back to work?
even after the whole George thing?
she was supposed to come back that Friday
the day after Tracy died, but she didn't.
I assumed it had something to do with that.
did you tell the police about George?
Yeah, the whole office did.
I mean, I heard they interviewed him, but they haven't arrested him yet.
8 DAYS BERORE DISAPPEARSEXVALLY HARASSED AT WORK
two drunken disorderly, two domestic violence, no convictions.
the police liked him for the Tracy Harrison murder, but they didn't have enough evidence.
it's a hell of a motive. How hard they look?
well, no identifiable prints, no witness putting George at the scene.
if George killed Tracy for firing him, it's likely that he went looking for Katie.
well, he did-- a neighbor id'd him from his photo.
so she wasn't imagining a man outside her house.
do we know where he is? - We're looking.
Jack, I need you to listen to something.
okay, thanks.
stop! - For it is he who commands you.
get away from her!
does Mcguinness ever get rough with her?
no, but listen to this. Go ahead and isolate Katie's voice and back it up.
one sec, I got to filter out the lower frequencies.
sorry.
you're killing her! Stop!
stop!
you're killing her. - Okay, stop.
doesn't that sound less like someone who is possessed and more like someone who is describing a murder?
where was she the night that Tracy Harrison was killed?
we're not sure, but she asked for the exorcism the day after the murder.
you know, her mother said that she kept having these visions.
I don't think she was hallucinating. 
I think that she may have witnessed Tracy Harrison's murder.
12 HOURSE MISSING
I've never seen him.
one of your neighbors said they saw him outside your house.
Katie never mentioned someone following her?
no.
did she ever say anything about witnessing a crime?
Why?
well, a woman was killed at Katie's work.
we think she may have witnessed that happening, which might have something to do with her seeking out the exorcism.
if she saw something, she wouldn't have told me.
I would have just told her to go take her pills.
I... I don't know.
maybe she did and I... and i just wasn't paying attention.
did she say anything at all to you that seemed unusual?
understand, it's all unusual.
you never know what's going to come out of her mouth.
when she was little, we used to talk about boys and school and who was mean and who was nice.
the last few years it's all about psychic mind control.
pharmaceutical conspiracies.
it's exhausting.
I don't know how many times she's woken me up in the middle of the night.
and I want to listen. I want to be a good mother.
but this stuff coming out of her mouth, it just doesn't make any sense.
she's just been sick for so long.
I'm just so tired.
great. Great, great, great. All right, thank you.
Hey. I was just coming to see you.
NYPD just arrested George Lewis coming out of a bar.
Oh, well, if you're going to ask me about those videotapes,
I don't think they're going to help you... at all.
Yeah, but they constitute supporting evidence, if we extract a confession from him.
that's a big "if." Because without it, it won't hold up in court.
sorry, sorry, sorry. Did you say extract a confession?
no.
so, uh, I'll see you tonight? - Okay.
should we meet at our place?
what do you mean our place?
I called the realtor on the loft.
we are in escrow.
we are? On that dump?
I took another look, and there is nothing wrong with that apartment that can't be fixed with a little bit of work.
good?
so I'll see you there? - Sure.
I'll bring the spackle.
why am I here?
you nervous?
Yes.
you're not nervous because of me, are you?
I mean, guys like you push girls like me around, right?
I told the cops, I didn't touch Tracy.
well, you're not here because of Tracy.
you're here because of Katie Duncan.
the lunch girl from the office?
I barely know her.
well, apparently that didn't stop you from trying to feel her up, did it?
where is she?
I haven't seen her.
not since that day at work.
you saw her two days after that day at work.
see, her neighbors id'd you from your photo。
lie to me again, George.
come on.
I went to her house. I just went to talk.
you don't open this door, I'm just going to come back tomorrow and the day after and the day after.
I have no job, remember?
what, what do you want?
I want you to tell Buchanan to give me my job back.
just go away, okay. Please?
not until you say you'll talk to him.
what am I supposed to say?
just tell him that it was blown out of proportion.
it was all a big misunderstanding. Whatever.
just tell him that we're cool now and he should give me my job back.
I can't just tell Chris what to do.
sure you can. He'll listen to you.
no, I'm the lunch girl.
come on, seriously? You haven't noticed?
noticed what? - He's crazy about you.
look, he's the boss. He can't ask you out, but everybody knows he wants to.
he respects your opinion. He'll listen to you.
so be a good girl, please.
help me out.
I knew she had a thing for Buchanan.
I figured it was a good angle.
did Buchanan really have a thing for her?
I don't know.
but she was like a puppy.
he could have done her anytime he wanted.
you know what, George, that's a really interesting story.
here's the thing. You had motive, you had opportunity.
right now, you're my best suspect.
what makes you think I would believe that you didn't hurt Katie?
I needed her to go to Buchanan and get my job back.
if I hurt her, how is that going to help me do that, hmm? 
great, thanks.
Hey, I've been looking for you.
george Lewis's alibi checks out. He was on a flight from Chicago.
well, I just looked into Buchanan's financials.
last week he bought a $20, 000 engagement ring, had it engraved "for "Tracy, with all my love.
he never told us he was having a relationship with Tracy Harrison.
keeping an office romance a secret, imagine that.
Buchanan picked up the ring the morning that Tracy was killed, but they never found it on her.
so maybe he hadn't proposed yet.
maybe he did.
she said no and he couldn't handle the rejection.
so he beats her to death? Seems a little extreme.
it could be what Katie saw. I think it's worth checking into.
I'll catch up with you later.
14 HOURSE MISSING
Buchanan's not home and the neighbors haven't seen him all day.
isaiah here says he saw him about an hour ago.
Taylor. Tell him what you told me.
he was with a girl. I heard him screaming.
I went over to get a good look.
let go of me! WHAT YOU SAY?
don't touch me! Katie. Katie...
Hey, what's going on over there?
Hey, what's going on over here?
did you talk to him?
no, he got into a car and booked it after her, before I could get close.
all right, thank you.
that was Buchanan's office. He got into a car wreck. No sign of Katie.
can I get a phone call?
Why? Do you need a lawyer? - You tell me.
no, you tell us where Katie Duncan is, and then you can leave.
I told the other guy I don't know where she is.
then why were you chasing her?
did you go after her because she saw what you did to Tracy Harrison?
I didn't do anything to Tracy.
no? Then where were you the night she was killed?
I was at my place, waiting for her, with an engagement ring and a bottle of champagne.
so then why did Katie come to see you tonight?
I don't know. She wasn't making a lot of sense.
what YOU DOING HERE ?
I, uh...
I just wanted to see you.
have you been here all day? It's freezing.
I was just waiting for you to come home.
your family has been looking everywhere for you. They're really worried.
they're always worried.
but it's okay.
they don't have to worry about me anymore.
come on, let me give you a ride, okay?
no, I'm...
I'm exactly where I want to be.
look... I'm going to take you home.
Oh, my god. Katie.
everything is going to be all right.
look, I'm going to take you to the hospital, okay?
No! - Yes, you need help.
no, I do not need help. I'm fine!
you are not fine. Listen to me.
did you know that the FBI is looking for you?
Why?
they think that whoever attacked Tracy may have hurt you, too.
what happened to Tracy?
someone assaulted her at work last week and she died.
you were there.
Katie, what are you talking about?
I saw you.
you were kissing her. You said something.
I couldn't hear you.
and then you left.
she thought she was alone.
wait, wait, how do you know that?
because she wasn't alone. I was there, too.
what did you see?
I remember her face.
did you see who killed her?
let go of me!
what did you see? Did you see who killed her?
let me go! Get off of me.
Hey, what's going on over there?!
the newsstand vendor said that he saw you go after her.
I didn't know what to do, so I got in my car and I tried to find her.
I wasn't really looking where I was going, so I plowed into a garbage truck.
did you happen to see where she went?
no.
what I'm saying is, he lied to the police, and he's lying to us.
all right, but why place himself at the crime scene if he's guilty?
so he can blame it on a crazy girl who's conveniently missing.
look, Katie told George Lewis that she would go see Buchanan.
and she's the only one who can place Buchanan and Tracy together in the parking garage.
if she thought she could have a life with this guy, seeing him with another woman may have pushed her over the edge.
she snapped, grabbed the fire extinguisher, and killed Tracy.
and what, the devil makes her do it?
you know, maybe she really believed that.
because it's the only way she can make sense of what she did.
she needed the exorcism to make it all go away.
which works until Buchanan reminded her of the murder.
right.
I'll tell you, if exorcism was her last resort, and that didn't work,
I don't even want to think about where she goes after that.
well, we got the police on an alert. If they hear from her they'll call us.
agent Fitzgerald.
agent Fitzgerald, it's Laura Duncan.
Yeah, Mrs. Duncan, how can I help you?
she's home. Katie's home.
she just walked in the front door and she's fine.
okay. She's home. We need pd over there right away.
Mrs. Duncan, I need to know where Katie is right now. Is she with you?
Yeah, she's upstairs.
she said she was just really tired and wanted to go to sleep.
all right, listen to me. I need you to go upstairs and stay with her.
Why? What's wrong?
just keep an eye on her until we get there, okay?
she's not in her room.
Katie! - Come on.
look, just find her, okay?
I think she's taking a shower.
Mrs. Duncan, talk to me.
Mrs. Duncan, talk to me.
Katie, honey!
tough case.
it's closed.
how's Katie's family?
you know, I never did remember her.
I tried, but...
but, you know.
I'll see you in the morning. You take care.
all right.
good night. - Good night.
excuse me. Um, what's your name again?
Bonnie. Bonnie, that's right.
I'm Martin.
Yeah.
well, um, you have a good night.
good night. - Bye.
hello.
Hey.
what are you doing?
enjoying the view.
wondering what would happen if I dropped a penny.
why is it so dark in here?
I don't think lightbulbs were included in the price.
I'm not surprised.
do you want to dance?
would I kill the moment if I said no?
2 hours later
we have unconfirmed reports that the suspect, Terry Lee wicker is wanted for recent murders in the Las Vegas area.
but for now, authorities will only say that he is armed and extremely dangerous and that they are very concerned for the ten-year-old boy abducted yesterday outside a school in Boulder city.
reporter Kelly Walker was there for this morning's press conference.
Clark county sheriff Diego Nunez delivered a stark assessment of the suspect this morning, saying that this child abduction was not Wicker's first.
the FBI told us wicker kidnapped a four-year-old in New York city six years ago and the boy hasn't been seen since.
we want Kobe Karentino back safe and sound in Boulder city and we're not going to stop until he is, but we're gonna need the public's help.
according to the sheriff, Wicker is six feet tall, thin with brown hair.
he is 35 years of age.
if you see him...
excuse me, sir.
my son's not feeling well.
I think you need to get him off the bus, see if I can find a doctor.
hillside, AZ
Gil Grissom, Las Vegas crime lab.
nobody touched anything except Lenny.
he got here about 10: 00.
saw the bus to the gate at Auto lot.
realized all the keys in the lockbox were missing.
does Lenny know which car was stolen?
he's not much of a record keeper.
any kind of a surveillance system here?
no, sir.
think this Wicker's involved?
bus driver said he dropped him off nearby.
do you know if any of the businesses around have security cameras that would catch a piece of the street?
see what I can dig up.
that'd be great. Thanks.
so what do you think?
I think somebody rubbed up against this door recently.
this is where the car was.
right.
otc sleep medication.
that'd be enough to subdue the kid.
Yeah, but nobody sleeps forever.
are you two still in hillside?
no, it's just me.
Gil Grissom's headed back to Vegas to finish processing Gina Farentino's car.
what's going on?
it's more than likely that Wicker's gonna abandon the car he stole, so we're checking rail yards and airports within a 200-mile radius.
any luck finding any known associates?
well, wicker has a sister listed as an emergency contact at his last known job.
we're trying to track her down.
what kind of work did he do?
he worked maintenance on the railroad and got fired about nine and a half years ago.
that fits perfectly.
explains why he travels on trains.
we have a home address?
he had an apartment in Astoria about ten years ago, but a neighbor said he disappeared after Kobe was born and then Gina moved out two weeks after that.
that fits the timetable of Jason's adoption.
Yeah, and since we don't know the identity of his birth parents, it's possible that Kobe is Jason Taylor.
you should bring in his sister, see if she can confirm it.
Las Vegas, NV happy birthday mom Boulder city, NV
Yeah, that's definitely him.
that's the man that picked Kobe up.
and you just let him?
normally, Kobe walks home.
he didn't need permission to leave school grounds.
did he seem alarmed?
no, no.
but why would he?
the man who come by the school earlier that day with Kobe's mother.
is that him in the green shirt?
no.
Hey, miss Farentino.
Hi, Mr. Polchek.
kobe, your mom's here!
no, you don't have to interrupt him.
kobe, come here!
it's lunch.
I'm not interrupting anything.
mom, I got a "perfect" on my history test.
Hey, Kobe.
this is your uncle.
you know, from back east. He's a friend of the family.
your mom tells me you're quite the artist.
I'm okay.
I'm not in town very long, Mr. Polchek.
could I go look at Kobe's pictures?
I'm sure we'll have time for that later.
I'd like to see them now.
we got about 20 minutes before class.
why don't you go through there to the office?
tell them I said it was okay.
Kobe's a good boy, but he needs a male influence in his life.
I thought an uncle was a good thing.
did he talk to anyone later?
his friend Angelica.
I'm gonna need to speak to her.
of course.
Gina must be worried to death.
this is 11: 50 this morning.
no front plate.
Arizona, not a requirement.
I didn't see the boy.
well, maybe he's asleep in the back seat.
maybe.
what is that, a late '80s Buick?
VIVIAN: That would be my guess.
all right, I'll update the APB.
Viv, we know Wicker abducted Jason Taylor six years ago in New York.
now, if Kobe's our kid, how did Wicker lose track of him and then have to abduct him again?
well, maybe Gina was in on it originally, but killing the baby-sitter wasn't part of the plan.
so she got scared and ran.
wouldn't you?
she shouldn't have stopped running.
Mr. Polchek tells me that you're Kobe's best friend.
best school friend.
you're not friends outside of school?
he plays soccer.
I play piano.
um, did he say anything about the man that he met yesterday?
it's okay, honey.
he said it was a secret.
you know, Angelica, there, there are some secrets that are not so good, and I'm just trying to make sure this is not one of them.
kobe said he was gonna go look at the art projects.
that's on my game last week.
I scored a goal.
it wasn't like the winning goal or anything.
well, still, that's...
Yeah, it was cool.
I wish I could have seen it.
be nice to hang around together, wouldn't it?
I guess.
you know, kick a ball, eat hamburgers, that kind of thing?
you're gonna have to ask my mom.
all right.
your mom doesn't think this is the right time for them to tell you this, but, um...
tell me what?
I owe you a big apology, Kobe.
I wasn't smart before, and I ran out on you and your mom.
I'm your dad.
my dad's dead.
I understand why she told you that.
she was just trying to protect you, but look at me.
I'm definitely not dead.
listen, you can't tell anyone we had this talk, not even your mom.
not yet.
why not?
I'm setting up this vacation for the three of us, and if we tell her, she might not want us to go right now.
so you want to go on vacation, don't you?
where are we going?
first stop's here.
maybe we'll do some camping.
you like camping, don't you?
Yeah, me too.
I think it's gonna be a great adventure.
did he say where they were gonna go?
Tucson.
tucson, AZ
how you doing? Deputy Wheelock.
the Buick from your APB's right over there.
I think we may have found something of interest next to this structure.
there's some dirt here that's been recently disturbed.
go have yourself a cup of coffee.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
wicker bought two roundtrip tickets from Tucson to New York.
the gate agent screwed up and didn't realize he let Wicker on the plane until he got home and saw him on the news.
what time did the plane land?
about an hour ago.
we sent units, but he was nowhere to be found.
okay thanks.
there's a reason he came back.
well, from what we've been able to find out he spent a lot of time in the area, and I suppose there's comfort in the familiar.
Yeah, but he's a fugitive.
it doesn't make any sense for him to come back to a place where he'd be identified.
could be he thinks the Vegas luck rubbed off on him.
we were able to get a hold of his sister.
she should be here in about 20 minutes.
hopefully, she can tell us where he might have gone.
does she know he's here?
no. She hasn't talked to him in a long time.
command post.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
that was security.
CSI Grissom from Las Vegas is here.
new York here?
lobby here.
he's on his way up.
what the hell are you doing here?
Hello, Jack.
you know, when I asked for the evidence to be transported to New York,
I didn't expect you to deliver it personally.
these are my boxes.
I want to make sure I get them back.
also, I have news.
when they exhumed the child's body in Tucson, it was clear from the state of decomp that it had been in the ground a long time.
I also found a circular stain on the clothing around the child's neck.
whatever made the stain had been removed.
and what would that be?
I don't know yet. I have more work to do.
would you, uh...
have some place where I could do it?
we have...
we have a lab in the base...
Oh, Elena.
agent Delgado, I'd like to meet Las Legas CSI Gil Grissom.
nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, too.
would you mind escorting him to the lab?
the, um...
Oh, okay.
um, let's take the rear elevators.
I never even met the baby.
Terry and Gina were married before he was born, and the relationship ended almost immediately.
your brother was introduced to Kobe as an uncle, so I'm assuming they were estranged.
has a hard time connecting to people.
do you really think he took Kobe?
Oh, yeah, we're positive.
well, I'm sure Gina's scared, but there's no way he's going to hurt their son.
how long since you've seen your brother?
must have been about six years ago.
Hey! Terry. - Hey.
how are you? - Good.
good.
it's been two hours since you called.
I was beginning to think you weren't coming by.
I just took me a little while to get here.
I brought you something.
Aw, you didn't need to do that.
you're my sister.
you like it?
Yeah.
I just...I just think you should use the money to take care of yourself.
I'm fine.
well, thanks.
Hey, before we go in, I just...
I need you to know that I'm seeing someone now.
Oh, yeah?
he's got two kids.
that's great.
Yeah.
but that means that you can't stay with us.
not this time.
we just don't have room.
we can't have you hanging around for two weeks only to disappear without me knowing where you're going.
the kids wouldn't know what to make of that.
I'll find someplace else.
I just think you got to get your life together.
you were so happy when you were with Gina.
I screwed it up.
so it didn't work out.
try again.
you know, go back to the therapist you were seeing and figure out what happened.
I better go.
he called collect once more to ask if he could come by and stay.
and I said no.
he hung up, and that's the last I heard from him.
do you have any idea what therapist he saw?
someone through the union.
I don't know his name.
okay.
I'd like your permission to get your phone records.
see if we can figure out where he could have called you from.
you just need to sign right here.
you know...
Terry was in jail once for stealing.
has he done something like that again?
we have strong evidence linking him to recent murders in the Las Vegas area.
what?
Oh, my god.
no, that can't be true.
you approach with stealth.
something I picked up in Vietnam
um, I'm Samantha Spade.
you called upstairs.
Oh, right.
I mentioned the gift card that I found in my report, but I thought maybe your team would like to have the actual evidence itself.
thank you.
um, you get any prints off of it?
just smudges, small ones.
probably belonged to a child.
you know, I hope you won't take this personally, but it smells down here.
does it?
of chemicals.
okay, then. Well, it was nice meeting you.
I, uh...
checked the dental records.
the body from Tucson is Jason Taylor.
right.
there were no broken bones, no blunt-force trauma, no obvious signs of violence.
but without tissue, I can't determine cause of death.
I doubt the cause of death is going to be any consolation to his parents.
no.
I'm about to run a 3D algorithm on the shirt fragment to see what was around his neck.
I'll get you an image as soon as I have one.
thank you.
these are murders that fit his pattern:
victims near railroads, women covered with blankets.
now here's what's interesting.
when Wicker was able to communicate with his sister, he would go by and visit her or call her after every murder, but he'd murder with less frequency.
after their break in communication, the frequency of his crimes increased.
now how long after that visit did he kidnap Jason and kill the babysitter?
three days.
now Gina used to live in that neighborhood while Wicker was in jail.
if Kobe had the same babysitter as Jason, maybe Wicker went by there looking for his son.
well, he obviously had some emotional attachment to Jason.
if not, he wouldn't have buried him the way he did.
he thought Jason was his son.
he buried him with something important around his neck.
and since he went back for it, maybe whatever it is, he's using it to make a connection with Kobe.
hopefully, this buys us some time.
that gift card that Grissom turned us on to was swiped in Astoria.
where?
welling and 30th.
hold on a second.
you know, Wicker lived out in Astoria in '96.
I'm pretty sure about that.
let's see...
it's right here.
Yeah, 732 North Hampton.
say hi, mommy.
got a body here.
my dad went to New York and all I got was this stupid murder weapon.
you know, this fits Wicker's mode.
home invasion, find a weapon on-site.
kill the resident, except this time, he left the weapon.
I don't think Wicker came here to kill.
this is where he lived when Kobe was an infant and his life was the most stable.
my guess is, he's trying to recreate that.
Hey, Grissom.
we got lipstick.
according to the landlord, Weiss didn't have a girlfriend.
maybe Wicker does.
I had no idea.
I haven't seen Terry in years.
part of me always worried about what became of him.
well, we subpoenaed your records, and they show that you treated Mr. Wicker about nine and a half years ago.
that seems right.
did he mention Kobe in your sessions?
Yes, frequently.
what was his wife's name again?
when Gina had the baby, Terry had a steady job.
he seemed stable and happy maybe for the first time in his life, but it didn't last.
when I treated him, he was having difficulty managing his anger and his home situation was deteriorating.
let's talk about how you can communicate those feelings of anger.
that's why you're here.
let's get it straight:
I'm here because that union rep said so.
considering your outbursts at work, do you disagree with her?
only thing I know is I got this bad feeling inside me and where it wants me to go is nowhere good.
is this a new feeling?
no.
wasn't there when things were going good: Kobe was born, when I worked down at the yard, Regina wasn't all over my ass.
how about before that?
did you have that specific feeling before?
sort of, I did.
well, if we can find out what caused it, we can stop it.
tell me the first time you felt this way.
you can't go back to work until I sign off on it.
around the time I was a kid.
my dad used to drag me and my brother to look for buried treasures.
he had one of those metal detectors.
one day he found this medallion thing in the dirt.
a gold lion.
I remember how much I really wanted it.
but he always gave the best stuff to my brother.
dad was so excited, he ran to the truck to get the camera.
all I could hear was this...
hissing in my ears.
like those bugs down south, what do they call them?
cicadas.
it kept getting louder and louder.
I just wanted to stop the noise.
I found a rock.
he never saw it coming.
when I get mad like that...
what happened to your brother?
I was just making that stuff up.
I didn't hurt him, okay?
can we find something else to yap about?
Terry, I think you're telling me this because you're afraid you're going to hurt your son or Gina.
this is over.
doc, look, I got to go.
please sit back down. - I said I got to go!
I checked with the county sheriff.
their records showed that Terry's brother died from head wounds in an accidental fall.
did you see Wicker again?
no.
now did the medallion that he was wearing look like this?
well, it was an animal.
Yeah, it looks like the same thing.
I was told that you wanted to talk to me.
Yeah.
I analyzed the lipstick from the cup.
the brand name is Chameleon, the color: Crimson ride.
the sample also showed traces of spermicidal lubricant.
well, the last outgoing call from the murder victim's apartment was to a pager.
three minutes later, Wicker got a return call from a payphone in Battery park.
you know, in Vegas, we would speculate that that call came from a lady friend.
an Escort.
a Hooker.
in New York, we just call them hoes.
Where's Terry Wicker?
who's that?
this guy right here.
we traced your pager and we investigate a phone number.
we also know that you called him back on a payphone.
and if I did?
excuse me a second.
if you did, I'm willing to bet that this lipstick matches the lipstick we found in the apartment along with the fingerprints, and then you can explain to us how you know absolutely nothing about the dead body we found there.
hold on.
I didn't have anything to do with that.
so what were you doing?
when Terry paged me, I thought it was for his usual.
hey... what brings you to town?
make him stop crying.
honey, you know I'm not into that kind of thing.
make him a sandwich or something.
you're gonna pay me a hundred bucks to make the kid a sandwich?
there's nothing I could do.
the guy had to go.
Why?
why did he... - Stop crying!
honey, let the boy go.
I'm sure there's something I could do to help you calm down.
I told you to make him a sandwich.
all right.
I'll make him a sandwich.
everyone's gonna get a sandwich.
I know! I know! I know! I know! I know! I know!
you know what?
I know there's nothing you could do.
I'm okay.
tell her to go.
and we can watch the tape again.
I'd like to watch the tape again.
that kid saved your life.
it was a creepy scene.
that's why I jammed out of there as soon as I could.
you got to believe me: I have no idea what happened.
any idea where he went?
I didn't want to know.
but I know he was driving.
I saw some keys on the counter. - Keys? What kind of keys?
for a Toyota.
the kid's playing along to stay alive.
Yeah, but Wicker's not stupid.
he's gonna figure it out sooner or later.
and when he does...
he's not gonna need the kid anymore.
Wicker's been in New York for nearly two days and NYPD lists 28 stolen Toyotas in that time.
well, we need to narrow it down by borough.
now the apartment where Ed Weiss was killed is near Laguardia.
so let's focus on Queens and work our way out.
you know, I'd wait on that.
an assault took place 30 minutes ago in Newark and it was linked to a stolen Toyota.
the witness id'd the subjects as Kobe and Wicker.
thomas Mitchner? - Yeah.
you seen these two?
Yeah, that's the guy who sliced me.
why don't you tell us what happened.
well, I came to paint the trim on the place here.
needed to move my truck closer, but the car was in the way.
I had seen a guy walk away about 20 minutes before, so I talked to the kid.
Hey, kid.
I need to offload my compressor.
when's your dad coming back?
he's not my dad.
okay. Got any idea when he's coming back?
not really.
look, I know it's none of my business, but do you need some help?
I don't know.
maybe you could call my mom.
what's going on?
I need to park my truck here.
I'm leaving right now.
is everything all right here?
Yeah.
why wouldn't it be?
well, the kid wants me to call his mom.
kid wants an x-box, too.
why don't you get him one of those while you're at it?
why don't we just wait and call the police?
back off!
I called the cops right then.
please tell me that kid is okay.
we haven't located him yet, but you probably saved his life.
all right, you take care.
thank you.
you know, Kobe only ran off an hour ago.
they might still be in the area.
yeah?
Hey, jack, it's Martin.
it was definitely them.
and the boy made a run for it.
any violence?
Terry sliced a witness with a knife.
I'm gonna need some support for house-to-house.
I'll call it in.
great. Thank you.
wicker and his son were seen fighting.
apparently, Wicker assaulted the witness and then took off after the kid.
now it's possible that the kid figured out what his father really is.
that would shatter Wicker's fantasy.
wicker doesn't tolerate conflict.
nearly everyone he's had a run-in with has ended up dead.
according to his pattern, he'll kill the kid and jump the next train out of town.
Jack, forget the pattern.
he broke the pattern years ago when he had an emotional connection to one of his victims.
wicker took the time to bury Jason Taylor's body.
then he called his sister.
did you find Kobe?
no, not yet.
ms. Wicker, we're going to need your help.
what do you mean?
well, if your brother's patterns remain consistent, we believe that he's going to call you.
and when he does, we'd like you to talk to him for as long as possible.
Oh, my god, did he hurt Kobe?
we're not sure.
I've been thinking this whole time about my brother, and there's just no way he would've done those things.
he just wouldn't.
ms. Wicker, I'd like to show you some pictures.
this is Gaby Lawson from Wyoming.
Emily Temper from New Mexico.
and Tamara Fox. Tucson.
you recognize the jewellery?
he gave them to you, didn't he?
well, all of these women are dead.
and I know that it's hard for you to believe that he'd be involved in something like this, but he is.
so do we have your cooperation?
transferring to the hard line.
we're in.
you can go ahead and answer.
Hello?
Hey, Syl, it's me.
Hi, Terry.
how are you?
Oh, okay, I guess.
just thought I should check in.
he's using his cell.
it's pinging off a tower in south Newark.
uh, that, that's great. I-I'm glad.
I've been, I've been thinking a lot about you, Terry, and, um...
I don't know.
you don't know what? What's going on?
are you crying? - No. No, I'm...
it's, uh...
are you okay? - Yeah.
you sound kind a strange.
I can't.
Sylvia. What's going on?
this is special agent Malone from the FBI.
do not hang up.
Where's Sylvia?
she's sitting here right next to me. Okay?
you put her back on or I'm hanging up.
no, no, don't you hang up, okay?
right now, I have her for possession of stolen Jewelry from the women that you killed.
I have enough to charge her as an accessory to murder.
what do you want?
I want you to let your son go.
I want you to turn yourself in.
and your sister? She walks.
look, Terry, I know you want to stop.
that's why you called your sister.
that's why you took your son.
we both know that you're afraid of killing him, too.
you don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, I think I do know what I'm talking about, and I think you know what I'm talking about.
Terry, come on.
listen to me. We can make a deal.
I got a visual on the suspect.
late model pick up.
I'm not sure if it's Wicker.
remember, we got to take him alive.
he's the only one who knows where the boy is.
you alone?
what do you think?
I got FBI agents crawling all over this place.
but they don't do anything unless I say so.
guess that makes you the big boss, huh?
not right now.
not while you have the boy.
where is he?
I need to see my deal.
Yeah, I got it right here.
show me!
not until I see your son.
where is he? Is he in the truck?
doesn't matter.
it matters to me.
you want to cut a deal for your sister or not?
I want to see the boy.
believe me, I,I didn't want to hurt him.
you run away from me, huh?
I mean it!
I promise! I won't do it again.
no. No, please.
I won't do it again.
I promise.
go. Go.
kobe. Run.
run!
come on, Terry. You're a cold-blooded killer.
you honestly expect me to believe that you just let him walk?
he's my son.
I couldn't hurt him.
let's say I believe you.
your sister still wants to know if he's okay.
she know what I done?
Hey, I'm not gonna lie to you, Terry.
I told her everything.
but you have a chance to fix this.
what she say when you told her?
look, I'm not here to talk about your sister, all right?
I'm here to close the deal.
I want your son.
come on.
what am I gonna do now?
who do I got left?
you got plenty left, Terry.
you can keep your sister out of prison.
just give me your son.
tell her I'm sorry. - No!
he's not in the truck.
you'd think the kid would have gone to the police by now.
he's a kid. He's scared.
where do you think he's hiding?
the one place his father told him he'd be safe.
there's a warehouse rail staging area a quarter of a mile east from where Kobe Farentino ran off.
it's at Meeker east of Newark avenue. - Okay.
meeker, east of Newark avenue.
great.
Jack and Martin will be there in 20 minutes. - Okay.
it's okay. We're here to help you.
come here.
your aunt's here. Okay?
six years ago I got a phone call about Jason Taylor, and I drove out here and I looked around and I just thought, how the hell can anything bad happen here?
it hasn't changed much in six years.
Yeah, well, six years of not knowing must have changed something.
ever think about hanging it up?
every day.
at least you got your pay.
I do, yes.
what do you got, Jack?
the people that we get back.
cause there doesn't seem to be enough of them anymore.
want to come in?
I'd rather not.
me neither.
okay.
yeah
what's going on?
I'm sorry... - Brian.
Brian, yeah.
I'm pregnant.
what?
look, I just really need you to sign this piece of paper, and then you can forget all about it.
I think we should talk about this.
I need a location on Jack.
he's still not in, and he's not answering his cell.
son of a bitch.
listen, maybe kapel lied about Jack to throw up some dust.
roughing up witnesses, seizing files without a warrant.
no. That sounds like Jack.
I'm telling you, something's not right.
he's over there!
I don't know, Sam. We just got...
what do we got? - 46-year-old male, gsw to the right chest.
severe blood loss.
the patient is hypertensive.
do you know what type of weapon was used? - . 45.
get a cbc, chem-seven, chest x-ray cross-matched times four.
prep the or and page the thoracist on call.
you have to wait here.
I'm with the FBI. That's my partner.
there's nothing you can do back there.
let's cheer!
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven, eight.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
is everybody ok?
what was that?
that wasn't on me. You got out of position.
no, I did not.
you were off, Diana. Again.
God! What is with you?
coach richter?
Jenny's right.
anything?
no. He's still in surgery.
we left Danny at the courthouse with Romar.
bail?
his lawyers are angling, but it was denied.
the ausa-- they're asking for a debriefing.
want to know where we are inrahe t tfficking case.
they're going to have to wait a couple of days.
Yeah.
have you got an address for me?
all right.
thank you.
Nassau pd.
16-year-old girl went missing last night.
I can check it out.
okay.
just keep me posted on Jack.
excuse me.
we're going to need agenmalone's medical records from the bureau.
I thought you already had his insurance information.
we need to know his next-of-kin and any dnr orders.
I can get that information for you.
I'm going to head off.
let me know if anything happens.
you take care.
14 hours missing
coach richter told us that, when she left the school, Diana's car was still in the parking lot.
does Diana usually hang around after practice?
no, no. She's usually home by 8: 00, but, um,...
if her car is missing now, maybe...
maybe she just had an accident.
we've been looking into accident reports, and nothing has come up.
I don't know why we told her it was okay that she could drive alone at night.
because all of her practices are at night.
what were we supposed to do?
now, have you... have you noticed any strangers hanging around your daughter lately?
maybe at some of her competitions?
I guess it's possible.
who knows if some sicko's watching her?
does she have a boyfriend?
um... she had a crush on some boy named Joe, but that was a while ago.
does Joe have a last name?
she stopped talking about him after she got out of the hospital.
we never even met th boy.
why was she in the hospital?
she, uh... she had a heart transplant two years ago.
Diana was diagnosed with myocarditis when she was four years old.
it's an... inflammation of the heart muscle, and she's never really had a normal childhood.
and how is her health now?
she's okay.
the immunosuppressants make her more prone to infection, but that's about it.
okay.
what about changes in behavior?
well, before her surgery, Diana was introverted and sweet.
she was sort of a bookworm, really.
I guess she really didn't have a choice about that.
she spent most of her adolescence in and out of hospital beds.
and now... now we can barely get a civil word out of her.
Hey, honey. You look cute.
you going out?
Yeah. Gotta break in my new boots.
where you going?
just to meet a friend.
who?
just some serial killer.
he didn't tell me his name.
honey.
you know it's a school night.
I know, I know.
honey, I thought your chem homework was due tomorrow.
I'll finish it at study hall.
I thought you said you wanted to get your gpa up.
why are you making such a big deal out of this?
because colleges look at your sophomore transcripts.
don't you want to get into a good school?
like it matters.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
you're not going out. Not tonight.
she never used to talk to us that way, but how were we supposed to set limits on her after what she's been through?
look, she can be difficult, but imagine being 16 years old and knowing that your heart's got maybe ten, 20 years left, if you're lucky.
now, do you, uh... do you have any idea who she was going to see that night?
no.
Hi, elena.
any word?
doctor came out about an hour ago, um...
and said that while they were trying to fix his lung, they found additional damage.
blood vessels or something.
is he going to be okay?
well, he's lost a lot of blood.
well, for what it's worth, the knitting group at st. Alma's added him to the prayer chain.
your mom knits?
we all knit eventually.
listen, I just took a message for you.
it was from a Brian Donovan.
he wouldn't say what he was calling for.
Sam, you want the number?
no. I have that number.
look, eEena, I'm going... I'm going to call you when Jack goes into recovery, okay?
okay.
Bye.
according to school security, nothing out of the ordinary in the past week.
what have you got on the ex-boyfriend?
well, there are 17 Josephs at Cedarhurst high, so we're looking into that.
I'm going to have Lucy working on Diana's hard drive.
we have, like, a thousand e-mails to go through.
but I've been cross-matching the list of friends Diana's parents gave Martin with her cell phone records, and I found something really interesting.
look at this.
she texts or calls this Kelli Peters around 30 times a day.
well, maybe this is the person she was supposedo tmeet the other night.
I'll tell you what.
Danny is at the high school right now.
I'll call him and tell him to check into it.
17 hours missing
I saw her right before she went to practice.
that was it.
but we know she had plans to meet someone three nights ago.
any ea who that was?
I don't know.
do you know if she's dating anyone?
maybe someone that her parents don't know about?
dating? You mean like with a corsage and a curfew?
no. I mean hooking up.
no. Di wasn't hooking up with anyone.
what's so funny?
someone just sent me a joke.
yeah? You want to hear another joke?
I'm going to put you in juvie for six weeks if you don't help me.
okay.
I'm sorry.
I hear she's been lashing out since her transplant. Is that true?
it sounds like jealousy to me.
they're mad because she's popular and they're not.
so you'd say she's the Same girl that she's always been?
we weren't exactly friends before this year.
we're only in the Same year because she was in the hospital so long.
do you know if anyone's mad at her?
maybe someone who'd like to hurt her or get revenge, anything like that?
Yeah, okay, I guess there was this thing the other day with Craig.
I need to know why.
because I need it.
why does it matter?
I just can't. It's wrong.
Hey, what's the deal?
you guys are all secretive.
it's nothing.
I wasn't talking to you, loser.
Craigers here doesn't want me telling everyone how he grabbed Reesa Coleman's ass.
who?
the super-geeky special-ed chick.
no way.
I did not. She's lying.
let's see who believes you.
don't do this, Diana.
come on, Diana. Let's go.
we have to text Lainie the news. She'll freak.
I know, l alright.
di was just messing with him.
hmm, and you think[Uhe got back at her.
Craig's a total tool.
no one even knew who he was till that rumor got around.
look, all di wanted was to borrow his take-home spanish test.
Craig said no.
it's no big deal or anything.
right. What's Craig's last name?
I just want to help you, okay?
please.
18 hours missing
so Craig Baskin was a no-show at school today.
his parents haven't seen him since he left, and he is not answering his cell phone.
you know what? Maybe he wasn't the only holding a grudge, because this Diana reed wasn't exactly miss congeniality, you know?
no, according to several of her classmates, she's had a radical personality change since she had her transplant.
well, the change of behavior would explain this.
check it out.
Lucy discovered this blog in one of Diana's text messages.
and there is no one worse than Diana reed.
once a sickly but relatively cool girl, she drank the kool-aid and joined up with the bitchy sheep of cedarhurst high,
and now thinks it's fun to make plans with people and not show up.
this sheep needs to be slaughtered and made into a sweater.Wow.
it goes on for five pages.
whose blog is this?
um, a kid named Joe Chapelle.
ever heard of the first amendment?
freedom of speech doesn't cover death threats.
I talked to several of your friends, joe, and they said that Diana dumped you right after her surgery.
that must've hurt.
Yeah. It sucked at the time.
it sounds like you're still hurt.
what happened between you two?
how should I know?
now that Diana's a cheerleader, she doesn't have time for me.
so why were you gonna meet up with her the other night?
she came up to me at school, completely out of nowhere, and asked if we can get together.
did you think you were gonna do more than just talk?
is that why you were so upset?
No!
I had to sneak out of my house that night.
I waited at the park for two hours.
wouldn't you be pissed?
so you wanted her to feel a little bit of the pain that you were feeling.
I would never hurt Diana, even with the way she's been acting since coming back to school.
look, if there's anyone you should be talking to, it's her so-called friends.
omg
my heart's beating so fast.
you think it's the e?
where the hell were you the other night?
what?
two days ago you begged me to meet you at the park, and then you're a no-show?
I can't talk about this right now.
I'm not going anywhere until you explain to me why you flaked.
go away, emo boy.
so this is the new you, huh?
you've hit an all-time low, di.
yeah? I know what you think about me.
I read your stupid blog.
dude! Can't you see she's sick?
leave her alone.
when we talked to kelli, she didn't say anything about a party.
that's because Kelli Peters is a liar.
so where did they go after you saw them?
I don't know.
um... Kelli led Diana into the woods, and that was it.
and you just left her out there.
karma's a bitch.
20 HOURS MISSING
good afternoon.
I'm special agent taylor.
miss Peters' attorney.
Hi, Kelli.
Hey.
so why has my client been brought to the fbi for questioning?
well, I figured your client would be less likely to lie to me in here.
miss peters has cooperated fully with your investigation.
Kelli, I know you were with Diana later last night.
no, I wasn't.
no? Then why are your classmates telling me that the two of you were popping your asses off at a party in the woods?
popping?
popping. Taking ecstasy.
Kelli and Diana took ecstasy. Isn't that right?
hold on a second.
and the ecstasy made Diana sick.
she needed help, but you didn't help her. Why?
was the ecstasy yours?
don't answer that.
she had a heart transplant.
taking ecstasy could kill her.
do you understand that, Kelli?
that's not what happened. - Kelli.
then what happened?
the police are searching the woods.
if you left her there to die, we're gonna find the body. - I didn'T.
agent taylor.
my client is willing to share information -
in exchange for leniency in regards to the drug charges.
well, let's see what she's got first.
after Diana took the e, we waited till morning.
I-I guess she finally felt better because she wanted to leave.
that was really scary.
it's my fault.
I don't know what I was thinking, dropping E.
then why did you?
Diana, if something's up with you, you can tell me.
I just...
I really thought things would be less sucky after the operation.
it was like a fresh start, you know?
it's worse than it ever was.
Oh, my god! What happened to your car?
I got in an accident.
did you hit someone? Is that what this is about?
no. It's nothing. I swear.
di, are you okay?
Yeah.
sure.
but maybe we should call your parents so their heads don't explode.
no.
they'll just ask a lot of questions.
I cannot handle that right now.
we talked for a little bit, and then she left.
said she'd go straight home.
do you know where she was before the party?
she didn't tell me.
Hi.
wow... you're really pregnant. - Yeah.
um... so did you bring the release?
I didn't sign it yet.
well, when we talked on the phone you said you were gonna sign it and drop it off.
I know what I said, but I changed my mind.
um, it...what are you doing here then?
I'm not trying to make things difficult.
I just can't have some kid with my face roaming around the world and not know anything about it.
or maybe if we could just...
what is that?
the monitors go off all the time.
okay, well, is... is he gonna be okay?
I don'T...
all right. You know what?
we can talk about this later.
I don't know why you didn't just tell me this on the telephone.
I don't know what you're even doing here.
okay, look. I... I hope your friend's all right.
what happened?
I'm sorry, ma'am. I don't have anything new to tell you.
21 HOURS MISSING
let's have a little update.
I've checked all local pds within a 30-mile radius, and I'm still waiting on the hit-and-run reports involving any vehicles that match up to Diana'S.
you know, if she did hurt someone, that might explain why she took off, so I'm gonna exp danthe search area.
okay.
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
okay.
excellent. Thank you.
so, nassau county pd picked up Craig Baskin.
he was hiding at a friend's house.
all right.
uh, why weren't you at school today, Craig?
guess I just wanted to bail.
just wanted to bail.
see, according to your file, you're an "a" student with a nearly perfect attendance record.
see, guys like you don't just bail.
I just didn't feel like going to school, okay?
what's the big deal?
well, the big deal is that you skipped school the day after Diana reed went missing -
a girl that was spreading rumors about you, because you wouldn't let her copy your spanish test.
you're joking.
that's what she told you?
Craig, what did you do?
I didn't touch her, mom.
just tell me what happened.
I'm the editor for the school paper, and she asked to use my lexisnexis account so I could find an unlisted address for some guy.
okay. Does this guy have a name?
did you give her the information?
well, only after she made my life a living hell.
what do you want?
there's some guy in the newspaper office looking for you.
who?
I don't know, but he's pissed.
he says you're writing some article about his son?
did you pass yourself off as one of my reporters?
look, you didn't tell him I was here, did you?
what the hell is going on?
is this about the address I gave you?
just tell him you couldn't find me.
is that her?
are you Diana reed?
please, I have to go.
what the hell were you thinking, sticking your nose in my family's business?
look, I'm sorry, okay?
sorry?
do you think an apology's enough after what you did?
Hey, take it easy.
stay out of this!
my wife is a mess because of you.
if you ever come around my house again, you're going to regret it.
do you understand?
do you understand?!
Yes! Yes!
I'm sorry I didn't tell anybody.
I was just hoping Diana would eventually show up and this whole thing would blow over.
do you think Jenkins was waiting for her when she left?
I don't know.
I followed her out to her car, but she was in such a hurry to go she clipped a post on the way out.
all right. Do you know what he meant by Diana was messing with his family?
no.
she wouldn't say.
Martin, local pd's at Jenkins' house.
is he there?
no, but viv's on her way over there to talk to his wife.
let me show you something. You know, baskin said that Diana was passing herself off as a reporter doing a story on Jenkins' son?
Yeah.
well, I think I know why. Take a look.
local teen killed by drunk driver.
and the deceased was Paul Jenkins.
and the date of the accident was the Same day that Diana got her new heart.
wait, one kid dies, and on the Same day two towns over, another kid gets the heart that she needs.
probably not a coincidence.
why the hell would Diana want to get in contact with the family of her heart donor?
I don't know, but if she did try and contact them again, who knows what Roy Jenkins would've done to her?
22 hours missing his name is roy Jenkins.
he accosted Diana last night after cheerleading practice.
have you ever seen him before?
no.
did he hurt her?
we... we don't know.
our witness said that she was scared, but she was okay when she drove away.
who the hell is this guy?
why would he come after Diana?
we think he's the father of her heart donor.
you mean the...the kid from the accident?
you have any idea why Diana would want to contact him?
I don't understand.
she's never asked about her donor before.
actually, this came up at her last checkup.
your blood pressure's okay, and your echo looks good.
I don't see anything here that could cause those tremors.
is it possible there could be something wrong with the heart that she received?
all donors are screened for blood diseases and abnormalities.
plus your heart came from a healthy 17-year-old boy.
most likely, these are side effects from the anti-rejection meds.
we'll lower your dose of tacrolimus, and they should subside.
trust me, kiddo. You're doing great.
thank you, doctoR.
I'll have the nurse bring you your new prescription.
I got my heart from a 17-year-old boy?
you never told me that.
uh, yeah, we did.
no, you said that there had been an accident and somebody had died.
right.
It...your donor was hit by a drunk driver.
but he was my age.
I thought he was...older.
well... um... I'm sorry we didn't make it clear.
I... I guess we just didn't think it mattered.
well, what else do you know about him?
nothing much, really.
do you even know his name?
no, I don't.
all donors are anonymous.
you know this, honey.
I can't believe you kept this from me.
she didn't say a word to me the whole way home.
why didn't you tell me this?
because it's not like you would've wanted to talk about it anyway.
okay, we have an agent going to the Jenkins house right now, so as soon as I know anything, I will let you know.
Dr. Gant, ICU.
Jack, you're in the hospital.
Jack, Jack... - I need you to calm...
ma'am, I need you to leave.
Jack, it's Samantha. Can you hear me?
Hey.
Jack, you're gonna be okay, all right?
you're okay.
excuse me.
patient's had a right side thoracotomy, secondary to a gsw.
stable, but non-responsive since he got to the ward four hours ago.
Mr. Malone, can you hear me?
squeeze my fingers if you can hear me.
23 HOURS MISSING where's mrs. Jenkins?
in the living room.
Mrs. Jenkins?
special agent Johnson.
can you tell me what this is all about?
well... we're looking for this girl.
your husband was seen threatening her at her school last night.
well, I've never seen her before.
you got a bad poker face, Mrs. Jenkins.
why would I know her?
because she's the recipient of your son Paul's heart.
she came here pretending she's something she's not.
so, Paul was 17 when he died?
he had his birthday three weeks before the crash.
he was coming home from school with his brother and...
I guess that man had been drinking at one of those steakhouses on highway 27.
um, would it be possible to see Paul's room?
no.
I thought this was an article about his accident for mothers against drunk driving.
it is.
I just thought that maybe if I knew more about Paul, it would make a better article.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
this is still very hard for me.
we used to talk about Paul for hours.
but it didn't do anybody any good, so we stopped.
now we never talk about him.
some friends of his put up a memorial where he died, and I can't even bring myself to drive past it.
I don't know how we're supposed to get over something like this.
is this him?
that's Paul on the left.
he looks happy.
he was always laughing about something.
is this Paul's brother?
he was driving the car when they crashed.
he's never... been quite the Same.
I can't talk about this anymore.
um, I...
I need you to leave.
she left, and when Roy came home, I told him about her.
what happened after he threatened her?
he just asked her to leave us alone.
so why are they still both missing?
agent Johnson?
Yeah.
Thanks.
we found Diana's car parked down the street.
it didn't end here, did it?
she came back a few hours ago.
my husband asked you to stay away.
I know, but this isn't about him.
I lied to you earlier.
about what?
about who I am.
I don't understand. What do you mean?
I'm... I'm not from the school paper.
I have your son's heart.
what?
you have Paulie's heart?
wait. What did you say about Paulie?
Tim...it's nothing... - no, no, no.
I heard you say something about Paulie's heart.
I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
no, repeat it.
repeat what you said.
Timmy, don'T.
repeat what you said.
I said...
I have your brother's heart.
I-I needed a transplant.
his heart saved my life.
you gave away Paulie's heart.
answer me.
answer me now.
tim was in intensive care for weeks after the crash.
we didn't mean to hide it from him.
we just never found the right time.
what happened after she told him?
he got angry.
she tried to calm him down, but it just made things worse.
he... grabbed one of Roy's guns and took her.
where did he take her?
I don't know.
Roy's been out looking for them ever since.
25 hours missing maybe dinner how you doing, Jack?
I believe they have an expression for it.
um... crap.
I called Maria.
I just talked to her and the girls.
director sends his best wishes.
no, really. He called.
he's glad you're not dead.
I'm sure.
he's very happy with the work you've been doing with the task force.
we need to talk about that.
there's plenty of time for that.
OPR hasn't even opened a file yet.
Yeah, well, when they do, they're gonna find plenty of problems, and most of 'em are mine.
everybody who worked on that, especially vivian, a total pro all the way.
like I said, haven't even opened a file yet.
how about we watch some oprah, huh?
okay, thank you.
I just spoke with danny.
he found Roy Jenkins looking for his son at the home depot where the kid worked.
no sign of him or Diana.
okay, well, we tracked his cell, but he left it at home, so I've been dialing numbers from its records, and so far, nothing yet.
I'll tell you, this kid really fell apart after his brother died.
got kicked out of school for vandalism...
and then he just spent ten days in jail for assaulting a bartender.
now he has Diana.
Yeah.
okay, got it.
no, no, no, do not approach.
the kid's armed and dangerous.
Yeah, thanks.
new york state throughway authority just spotted Tim's car busting through a tollbooth on highway 27 just a half a mile east of the babylon turnpike.
that's where Paul died.
get out! - What are we doing here?
let's go. Come on.
come on.
you got Paulie's heart.
I'll show you how you got it.
what happened?
just sit down.
me and Paulie were going to my buddy dugler's house for a pool party, and Paulie, he was really into, into hip-hop.
and he made me this mix.
so I asked him...
I asked him to get it for me, but it was in the backseat.
so he took off his belt, and that's when this drunk came around the bend, and he was going so fast, I just, I just...
I just stared at his grill coming at me.
and I remember slamming into my seatbelt and hearing the windshield explode.
and when I woke up, I could see that he'd been thrown from the car, and that he was laying on the ground and his head was cracked open and he was covered in blood, but his eyes were still moving.
and I could hear him gurgle when he tried to speak.
but I couldn't help him because I was stuck underneath the steering wheel.
so I started screaming.
I started yelling my heart out, but nobody came because there's never anybody on the street!
there's never anyone on the street!
I want to know why he's dead and you're alive!
I don't know!
he was my baby brother!
I know it's not fair.
do you know how hard it is?!
do you know how hard it is?!
every day I wake up wishing it was me that was dead and not him, okay?!
and now you, you just come along!
do you know how hard that is?!
I didn't mean to hurt your family.
what did you think would happen?
I just... when I heard about Paul,
I just thought that if I, if I knew about him, that it would help with...
would help with what?!
look... I'm sorry Paul died, and I know I can never make up for it, but I'm going to do everything I can to do right by him, I swear.
put the gun down now!
get away from me. - Put the gun down now!
get away from me!
get the hell away from me! - Tim, I need for you to listen to me.
you need to drop the gun now.
get the hell away from me!
we can't do that.
get away from me!
please, tim, I know I didn't know Paul, but I know he wouldn't have wanted this!
Tim, put the gun down now.
please?
now step away from the gun.
step back...
back.
Hey.
I ordered you a decaf.
I didn't know how seriously you were taking the caffeine thing.
that depends on the day.
you want a latte chocolate?
uh, no, this...it's fine.
this is fine.
um... so listen, I'm sorry about before.
I... I'm sorry.
no, you were worried.
I mean, I guess I just expected that you would bring the release and give it to me and that would be that.
because here's the thing.
I don't know you.
I mean, we don't know each other.
and, uh, I mean, I'm not gonna say that this is, it was a mistake.
it's just that you don't have any obligation to me or to him.
him?
Yeah, yeah.
all right, here's the thing.
I don't want him to get attached to you.
you know, he gets attached to you, and then you wake up one day and decide that it's all too muchdiand, sappear.
because I'd rather he not know you at all.
I so guess the question is...
can you be here for him?
that's what I want to talk about.
I mean, it's what I'm trying to figure out.
well, you got six weeks.
that's nothing. I've had serious relationships that haven't made it that long.
Yeah, well, then it's a good thing we're going for friends, isn't it?
so you need to get back to the hospital?
Nah, someone else is sitting with him right now.
Oh, okay.
so where you from?
Seriously?
Yeah.
you got to start somewhere.
okay, um, Wisconsin.
you're a cheesehead.
Oh, my god, is that all anyone ever thinks of when they think of Wisconsin? Come on.
thirsty.
the nurse says you can only have ice chips.
sorry.
open.
are you really here?
uh, as far as I know.
let me know if you need another one.
Viv, I'm sorry.
I told the detective all the decisions were mine.
you know, now is not the time.
no.
it's okay, though, you know? You can leave if you want to. You don't have to stay.
tough. I'm here until 2: 00 A. M.
then Martin takes over.
you know, I picked up a couple magazines: Vanity fair and people.
what's your preference?
sports illustrated: Swimsuit edition.
people magazine it is, then.
let's see.
a cat calls for help and saves its dying owner.
you really are trying to kill me, aren't you?
Marie Lewis was making dinner in her tiny manhattan kitchen
when suddenly, she felt dizzy and collapsed right next to her three-year-old pussy smokey.
job for corporate security for my company and me personally.
I'll get back to you within 24 hours.
I want you to be the primary relief supervisor for the unit.
our unit doesn't have a number two.
things are changing around here.
agent Malone?
I had a call about you today.
Bryce Hunter is checking your references.
I didn't use you as a reference.
why was he calling you?
I have...I have no idea.
they made an offer.
wow, I guess you're going to take that job.
Hello, my friend.
Hey, Niko.
I tell your parents you go out?
what?
no. Uh... thanks.
I'll be back before they get home.
Hey, Mrs. B.
Thanks, Will.
I got it.
Oh, Will?
do you mind holding Cole a sec?
um... Yeah, yeah, sure. Of course.
got him?
he's so tiny.
Hey, buddy.
thank you so much.
sure. Of course.
say bye-bye to Will now.
Bye-bye.
will! I didn't do anything.
Hey! Hey, you! Get off him!
will, are you okay?
son of a bitch!
who was that?
I... I don't know.
let me help you. I'll get you inside.
no, I'm all right.
you bleed everywhere.
No! Okay?
gotta go, okay?
good morning.
morning.
you're not gonna pull a baby out of there, are you?
no.
but... I do have a picture.
want to see?
Oh, yeah. Looks like he's smiling.
or he's got gas.
agent Spade, Malone, good morning.
morning.
morning.
welcome back. How was DC?
it's actually very lovely this time of year.
Yeah, it's a shame you couldn't have stayed a little longer.
so this is Will Duncan, 17.
went missing about 5: 00 p.m. from Park Slope.
what does NYPD have on it?
well, the family came to me directly.
will went to the same grade school as my son, Dylan.
and, uh, I know them all pretty well, so, uh...
it might be best if you conducted the interview.
do we know where he was headed when he went missing?
well, we might be looking at a kidnapping.
will's dad's an agent for the Counterfeiting Division of the Secret Service.
he targets a vast array of scumbags.
and this might be one of them retaliating.
generally speaking, that's what "scumbags" do.
right.
did you search for pedophiles or violent offenders in our area?
Yeah, we just put out a list to NYPD.
it includes all prisoners that were released from local facilities in the last 48 hours.
what about an Amber Alert?
amber Alert's already in place, and we've put out a police BOLO in the Tri-State area, so...
all the release forms you'll need from us since Will's a minor.
didn't want anything slowing us down.
and I made a list of all of Will's friends.
the ones I called last night are highlighted.
this is the man that assaulted Will.
do you recognize him?
no, but...
you need to concentrate on counterfeiters.
this could be an associate of someone I put away.
you have anyone in particular in mind?
well, we've been chasing a crew out of Belgium dealing in supernotes.
they killed a couple of snitches last week.
well, we're gonna need to see all your files.
do you really think this has anything...
you have no idea what these people are capable of.
Mrs. Duncan, we're just covering all angles.
is there any reason that your son didn't call you after he was assaulted?
what do you mean?
well, according to the doorman when he went out to help him, he tried to convince Will to come back in the building, but Will just took off.
I can't imagine why.
is he having a problem with you?
he has been difficult lately.
he's a good kid, but I got him an internship at my office and he practically threw it back in my face.
we're not done yet.
you can't just quit the internship, Will.
What,'cause we can afford to send you to private school, you think you don't have to work like everybody else?
that's not what I said.
your mother and I work long and hard to give you everything you need.
I came up from nothing to get where I am!
I never wanted that internship, but you don't listen!
I do what I think is best for you.
no, you don't.
you do whatever the hell you want, and don't care who you hurt.
Hey, you watch your tone with me.
you're a frickin' hypocrite, Dad.
get back here.
you didn't tell me any of that when we talked about it.
I thought I'd handle it.
did you and your son have any other altercations?
I almost wish we had.
maybe I could've figured out what was going on with him.
Mr. Duncan seized $230, 000 in counterfeit cash from the Belgians, and put away four of them away at stateside.
who's on the board?
the Belgians that are still at large.
hmm, any matches to Will's attacker?
not yet, but I've got ten years of case files to go through.
Hey, guys, what do you make of this receipt?
it came out of Will's backpack.
the vendor's name is torn off, but check out what's on the back.
license plate.
Nah, I ran it. Nothing.
could be a password.
letters and numbers indicate a higher encryption.
could be a bank account.
I'm looking into their finances.
so Will's abduction might not be related to his dad's work.
why do you say that?
because I just got his transcripts, and look at this.
he missed three classes in two years, and then eight in the last four days.
his parents never mentioned that.
because they didn't know.
the school counts absences at the end of each week.
all right, back up Agent Johnson at the school and call me if you have any updates.
agent Medina.
uh, you got a second?
Yeah, what's up?
I, uh, I wanted to get back to you about your offer.
Oh, great, so I can count you in, huh?
actually...I appreciate you thinking of me, but I'm gonna have to decline.
you have any idea what you're passing up?
Yeah.
in fact, I really want the job, but I also want to know that I earned it.
yeah? Well, life goes by fast, Martin.
not everything waits around till you think you're ready for it.
well, be that as it may, I'm really not comfortable with the circumstances.
circumstances? Wh-what circumstances?
look, there's a number of them.
Mm-hmm, let me guess.
you're loyal to the last guy that sat in my chair, right?
thanks anyway.
we're looking for a Darby Wechsler.
Yeah, she's right over there.
mom, I don't have a staple gun. I just have tape.
special Agent Johnson and Delgado.
mind if we ask you a few questions?
what's this about?
I'm Paula Wechsler.
I'm Darby's mom.
this is about Will Duncan.
he's missing.
Oh, my God.
his mom called us last night.
you're Will's best friend, right?
Yeah.
you ever seen him with this man?
no. Who is he?
we don't know yet, but we do know that Will missed a lot of classes last week.
do you have any idea why?
Darby, if you know what he was up to, you need to tell them.
I knew he was ditching.
I just...I thought it was junioritis.
what about personal problems?
like maybe something with his dad?
no.
I mean...he idolizes his dad.
what up, Wechs?
I have a surprise for you.
Yeah, Scarlett Johansson's number?
you wish.
floor seats to the sold-out Interpol show at the Garden.
are you serious?
how'd you get these?
katy P.'s cousins couldn't make it, so how much do you love me right now?
you know the show's a Tuesday night before the midterms, right?
Yeah, but after two months of studying, I'm gonna need a break.
Oh, man, I can't go to this.
where am I gonna get 120 bucks for a ticket?
just ask your dad.
Yeah, right.
he says unless it involves me going to college or staying healthy, then I gotta earn it myself.
your dad is such a tight-ass.
at least he cares what I'm doing.
in his own screwed-up way, he's, uh, he's actually pretty chill.
okay, well, now who am I gonna go to the show with?
you could always ask Mr. Kalvin.
maybe he'll, uh, shave his mole hair for you.
shut up.
he's like, the only guy I know who spends time with his father.
how long ago was this?
a couple of months, I guess.
and he never told you they fought?
no. But a few weeks later, he showed up with these hundred dollar bills wondering if I still had the tickets.
so I asked if his dad changed his mind, and then he just got all aggro about it.
where did he get the money?
he wouldn't tell me.
do you know what his father does?
Yeah.
so could Will have stolen counterfeit cash?
I don't know.
okay, no, no, that's great.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, thank you.
okay, so I spoke to personnel at Counterfeit Division.
they said there's no way that Will had access to the phony money during his internship.
I know. He stole it from home.
Mr. Duncan does these counterfeit seminars at banks.
he just counted. He's missing 1, 200 bucks from his stash.
so maybe Will paid this guy with the phony money for whatever reason and he got a beat-down for it.
Yeah, that's a high price to pay to piss off your old man.
you think that's why he stole the cash?
well, it's clear that Will has beef with his dad.
I can relate to that.
Oh, yeah? How's that?
I just remember how I used to feel when my old man used to go on and on about how good we have it, just so he could feel good about his own sorry ass.
Yeah.
okay, shoot.
no, that's great. Thanks.
okay, that receipt we found in Will's backpack-- the one with the code on the back -
it turns out it's an online password from an Internet cafe in Fort Greene, a half mile from Will's house.
fort Greene.
it's called the Junction Box Cafe.
did Will have any connections in that area?
nobody from his class.
I talked to that Wall Street guy.
And?
I turned him down.
there were a lot of zeros on that card.
I know.
I just thought I'd stick around and see what opportunities opened up.
well, I,I think that's smart.
you know, you have a lot of potential.
I think I'll take that as a compliment.
can I help you?
I'm Agent Malone. This is Agent Spade from the FBI.
just wanted to know if you had, uh, seen this kid.
I know him. Will.
he comes in a lot.
when was the last time he was here...Lilah?
I don't know.
a few days ago.
saturday, Sunday?
I guess it was Saturday.
have any counterfeit hundreds turned up in your till?
we don't take anything bigger than 20s.
Why?
do you recognize this man?
no.
okay, did Will have any problems with anybody down here at all that you know of?
actually, the only mess I ever saw him get into looked like it followed him here.
something wrong with that last cup?
Oh, man, I didn't even notice that.
Really?
so you didn't just order this to get me to come over here?
see, that'd be smooth, and I'm, I'm the opposite of smooth.
you screwed me.
you gave me the wrong file.
no, I didn't.
none of it made any sense.
how would I know that?
look, I was counting on this, you tool.
now what the hell am I supposed to do?
that's not my problem.
well, I'm about to make it your problem.
yo, take it outside, man.
don't touch me.
you and me-- we're not done, Duncan.
I don't know what his deal was, but Will was freaking out about it.
did you ever see this other kid before?
that's the thing.
he was in here a few days earlier and they seemed tight.
all right, we're going to need to see the computer Will was working on.
I'll get the manager.
we pulled the Internet history off of both of the computers that Will used and we figured out what he was up to.
according to the Internet cafe logs, this is Will's last session.
at first, he just surfs, but then...
will hacked into the school server?
and not just once.
every time he was at the cafe, he downloaded a test.
we've counted 11 thus far.
I guess if you're running a cheating scam, you'd better sell the right answers.
you think Will was cheating?
I know he was.
he wasn't the only one.
please.
um... I was wondering if you could identify this kid.
he was seen trying to beat up Will for giving him the wrong test.
I'm sorry, but this doesn't add up.
we have a strict honor code here, and we've taken precautions to avoid this kind of situation.
is that before or after you found out that somebody hacked into your system?
our techs discovered that you replaced five midterms in the last two weeks.
putting in a decoy is the only way that Will would have given that kid the wrong test.
look.
this is a delicate matter.
I'd like a chance to handle it internally.
it's a little late for that.
if this kid shows up dead, you're going to wish that this was just a cheating scandal.
do I make myself clear?
very.
where were you last night?
I had a basketball game at St. Joseph's.
why does it matter?
it matters because Will Duncan is missing and you were seen threatening him four days ago.
what proof do you have of this?
well, for starters, we have a room full of witnesses as well as confirmation from Brett's school that he was cheating with a test that he picked up from our missing person.
I didn't do anything to Duncan.
okay.
maybe you paid this guy to do something.
okay, now you're just speculating.
this is ridiculous.
I've never seen that dude in my life.
Brett, let me handle this.
what time is it in London?
I want my dad on the phone.
you should call your dad.
we'll tell him you've been cheating.
Oh, please, you think he cares?
as long as I get into Yale, my father doesn't give a rat's ass what I do.
Oh, good.
well, we'll just call Yale.
I got it.
my client will discuss the matter, but only if it remains privileged and can't affect his academic standing.
well, why don't we see what he has to say first?
I didn't hurt Duncan.
but you were buying tests from him.
he wasn't selling the tests.
he was giving them away.
no way we can fit 20 formulas on a rubber band.
my cousin once printed a cheat sheet on his T-shirt like a logo.
except we wear uniforms, numb-nuts.
you guys should just grow a pair.
what did you say, twit?
you're so worried about cheating on a measly midterm.
meanwhile, people are out there rigging elections and busting up marriages.
what the hell are you talking about?
everybody cheats.
that's just how they get by.
so why not just learn how to do that really well and do it all the time?
that's inspiring, Duncan.
but how the hell are you going to pull it off?
just tell me what tests you want and I'll get 'em for you.
I didn't expect it from someone like him, but the next day he had the test.
well, how did he hack into the server?
word is he stole Mr. Parson's password.
it made him an instant hero.
Yeah, that was until he gave you the wrong exam.
he ruined my GPA.
you know, and I wasn't the only one who was pissed.
I talked to four other kids who flunked that midterm because of him.
all right.
give us their names.
Hey, Jack, listen.
so I get a call from the board of directors at Will's school.
something about you threatening their principal?
I mean, it's all about perspective.
I just persuaded him to cooperate, that's all.
Yeah, yeah, I got a stake in this case. You know that, right?
why didn't you come to me first?
because if I have to check in with you every 15 minutes, we may as well put this kid's face on a milk carton.
Hey, these are friends of mine, man.
these are friends of mine.
what, you take a wrecking ball to their lives, why?
you want to, want to get a rise out of me, is that it?
it's got nothing to do with you.
I'm just conducting the case the way I see fit.
Really? Because I asked you to keep me posted while I'm in DC, and I come back and I find out you squandered a whole day's worth of resources on a case that should have gone directly to the US Marshals.
what's your point?
my point is that it's not about saving people for you. Is it?
it's a power trip, and you just can't stand the fact that I'm spoiling it for you.
thanks very much, but I already have a shrink.
all right, all right, here it is.
you don't save...a kitten in a tree without coming to me first.
are we clear?
Yeah, we're clear.
you hate kittens.
Brett Farnsworth got a 36% on that bogus midterm he got from Will.
seven other kids bomb the test.
only three of them alibi out.
you know, I still can't get why he's cheating.
his grades have actually gotten worse.
and if he's not doing it for money, then what's he got to prove?
I think I may have ID'd Will's attacker.
three months ago, Will's father brought down a counterfeiter who matched our sketch, but that guy had been in jail, so...
meet Gene Fuller, his brother.
he's got two counts of assault and battery.
I'm thinking he's the family muscle.
depends who wants to know.
agent Delgado and Johnson, FBI.
we're here to talk to you about Will Duncan.
who?
Oh, I didn't hurt that boy.
Really?
his doorman saw you pinning him down after you hit him.
I didn't hit him.
that was somebody else.
I was trying to help the kid out.
then why did you run?
there wasn't anybody else.
you went after Will because his dad put your brother away.
look, my brother was a small-time fish in that whole counterfeiting thing. All right?
after his sentencing, I had a buddy of mine get me Agent Duncan's address, so...
I went over there to see him; that was it; and that's when I saw the kid.
what did you do to Lilah?
I came home and found her crying.
I didn't do anything.
don't lie to me.
and you're not right for her, so just stay the hell away.
get the hell off me, moron.
Hey!
Hey, come on. Leave him alone.
come near my sister again, and I'll kill you.
Hey, you, get off him!
and when the doorman came out, you know,
I didn't want to have problems with my PO, you know, so I ran.
and you're sure they were talking about a Lilah?
Oh, I'm positive.
that's the girl from the Internet cafe.
listen, give me a description here.
face, hair.
I don't know. You know, dark curly hair, uh, leather jacket, you know...
you're coming downtown with us until your story clears.
her name is Lilah Pritchard.
will met her at an Internet cafe.
they've been dating for about six weeks.
this is her brother, Terrence.
apparently, he's the guy who assaulted Will.
so, did you track this guy down?
no, they skipped town, but we got an APB out on the both of them, so...
will was hiding his girlfriend from us?
he's 17, Lisa.
it's normal.
what, uh...what exactly was going on with your son when he quit his internship?
I already told you. I don't know why he quit.
I think you do.
excuse me?
someone with a record like your son's doesn't start suddenly cheating and stealing for absolutely no reason.
we got a suspect with motive, and you're giving us the third degree?
mark, stop it.
what kind of dim-witted tactics did you learn at Quantico?
I think you're concealing something that would help us find your son.
I'm not concealing anything.
just tell them the truth.
what are you talking about?
will found out.
found out what?
that you're having an affair.
Oh, hey.
I picked up Patsy's for dinner after work.
I'm just gonna eat in my room.
will, wait.
just because your dad punished you about the internship doesn't mean you get to shut me out, too.
I'm not shutting you out.
then, what's going on with you?
look, I don't want to talk about it.
why not?
because it's nothing, Mom.
Oh, honey, we both know that that's not true.
I saw Dad with a woman about a week before I quit my internship.
what are you talking about?
they were...they were hailing a cab together.
she was probably a colleague.
no, she wasn't a colleague.
they were all over each other.
I'm sorry. I...
I...I just didn't know what to do.
no, you must be confused.
mom, I know what I saw.
no, you don't.
okay, Will?
you don't.
all right, fine.
I thought if I just ignored it that we could move on.
I swear to you...
stop lying to me.
he looked up to you.
um, Mr. Duncan...
we're going to need the name of your, um...mistress.
Yeah, come in.
connecticut State Police just caught Lilah and Terrence Pritchard caravanning back into the city on the Merritt Parkway.
they were traveling separately?
well, I think if they were trying to get rid of Will's body, a motorcycle wouldn't suffice.
all right, well, let's have forensics process both vehicles.
okay.
um, also, I think you should know that Will found out that his father was having an affair.
okay, thank you.
so, where's Will Duncan?
how should I know?
because you beat the crap out of him yesterday right before he went missing.
you lied to us about dating Will.
I'm sorry.
I guess I got scared.
scared of what?
us finding out that your brother killed him?
I didn't kill the kid.
look...
Lilah and I lost our folks when we were young, so I get overprotective sometimes, but the last time I saw Will, he was in front of his building.
hmm, then what were you doing in Connecticut?
we have a cabin up there.
is that where you buried the body?
no.
that's not what happened.
then, you better start telling me what did happen, okay, 'cause if you don't, I'm going to assume that Will screwed you over and you sent your brother to kill him.
will didn't break up with me.
then why did Terrence attack him?
he came home and found you crying.
what, did you and Will have a fight?
Yes.
what about?
I'm pregnant.
when I first told Will, he wanted to bail, but then last night, he came back.
Terrence did this to you?
he... he told me to stay away, and I don't blame him.
it's none of his business.
Lilah, I'm sorry about last night.
let me see your face.
no, it's okay. It stopped bleeding.
Lilah, stop.
we need to talk.
you said everything already.
I know you're mad at me.
I trusted you, Will, but I guess all that crap about hating your dad 'cause he's a hypocrite was all talk.
it wasn't.
I mean, yeah, I panicked when you told me you were pregnant.
but this morning at breakfast,
I had to listen to him lie to my mom so he could see that slut he's been with.
and I realized I never want to be like that.
like what?
a coward.
you're the only thing that makes any sense to me.
I want to do right by you.
I love you.
we talked for hours trying to figure out what to do.
he said he wanted to fix the things that were screwed up in his life.
then he called a cab and left.
when was this?
around 11: 00.
then when you guys showed up saying he went missing,
I thought maybe T had gone after him again.
all right, is that why you went to Connecticut?
Yeah, but T didn't do anything to him.
you have to believe me.
what about the cab company that Will called?
it was East City Cabs.
they always pick up down there.
okay, thank you so much for your time.
Hey, any luck?
Nope, but I think she was mostly deaf.
what's that?
Hey, listen, a lot of these places seem empty.
the cabbie said he dropped Will out front, but he must have gone to a different building.
look, why don't we split up and work the block.
Hey, look at this.
what do you think that is?
I think that's blood.
there used to be a rug here.
and I bet you they dragged it that way.
you see the scratches?
what's this?
I think we found the right building.
did any tenants step in to Will's life?
no, not yet, but according to the owner, half the units are being renovated, so we're still working on the rest.
well, I'm thinking that whomever he came to see wasn't too happy about it.
they got into it in the hall, and Will fell down the stairs.
and no one heard or saw anything?
there's a guy saying that he heard a crash, but they didn't check on it.
I have Martin outside looking for security cams.
wait. Hold on.
I think I know why Will was there.
apartment 203 is leased by his dad.
you hear that?
Yeah. Well, we knocked, and nobody was at 203.
this kid's dad is starting to make my old man look like a saint.
Mr. Duncan, we know about your apartment that you keep downtown.
why is this relevant now?
well, it's relevant because your son knows about it, too, and it's relevant because he was there last night.
what?
and it's relevant because we found his blood all over the staircase.
wait. Are you sure it's his?
well, we're waiting for lab results, but we have his headphones, and they're covered in blood.
how do you know they're his headphones?
without those lab results, this is just conjecture.
will could still be all right.
Mr. Duncan, did your son confront you about your affair?
I wouldn't hurt my own boy.
why didn't you tell us about your apartment in the first place?
because I didn't think it was connected.
everything is connected.
there isn't a jury in this country that wouldn't see the connection between your affair and your son's blood all over...
stop saying it's his blood!
who else had access to that apartment other than you?
my girlfriend.
she wouldn't do anything to Will.
how's it going in there?
well, I think all things are pointing at you, Mr. Duncan.
I don't think he did it.
knowing this kid, uh...
hit a little close for me, and, uh...
it may have clouded my judgment.
Yes, maybe it did.
that's the beauty of the team, right?
a consensus of opinions keeps you from making rash judgments.
sorry to interrupt.
uh, we pulled these from a security camera outside Duncan's apartment.
this is Will going in.
and three minutes later...
now, who's that?
this is Darby Wechsler, Will's best friend.
thank you.
we found Will's blood in an apartment building downtown.
and you were there.
there must be some kind of mistake.
these pictures are dark.
that could be anyone.
no, no, no, no. We're pretty sure it's Darby.
we were hoping that you'd have seen something that could help us.
did you do something to him?
she didn't.
she wasn't there.
she was at home with me.
can you verify that?
why would I lie to you?
why wouldn't you?
all right.
Darby, now we know you're overwhelmed, but if you know what happened to Will, then we need you to tell us.
you've got the wrong girl.
did you kill him?
Darby, don't answer that.
I wasn't talking to you.
did you kill him?
so you wouldn't mind giving us a DNA sample, right?
he wouldn't help me.
I found him at the Internet cafe, and I followed him.
dad, are you in there?
what are you doing here?
I need the English lit test.
I already told you, I'm not doing that anymore.
why not?
because it's stupid.
I was doing it just to piss off my dad.
did you follow me here?
what exactly is here?
it's where my dad brings his girlfriend, all right?
what?
I saw him bring a girl here, like, a week ago, and I thought they were gonna be here again tonight.
look, you got to go, okay?
fine, then just give me the test.
are you deaf? I said no.
then I'm not leaving!
I'm sorry, but I don't know what else to do.
I can't get any Bs this semester.
why not?
because I won't get into Cornell!
do you have any idea how hard I've worked?
if I don't get in, I swear to God I will kill myself.
Wechs, it's just school.
there's more important things in life.
we'll study tomorrow.
No!
the test is on Thursday.
okay, we'll figure it out then, okay?
you have to give it to me!
you promised you would!
just stop, all right?!
I didn't mean to hurt him.
what did you do with his body?
there's no way you could have moved that body by yourself.
who helped you?
who helped you?
Oh, my God.
he's dead.
what are we gonna do?
Darby, stop it.
come here.
we're gonna fix this, okay?
okay?!
okay.
okay, sweetie.
it's gonna be okay.
now get the rug.
we're gonna roll him up.
the car's out back.
you said that everything would be okay.
Darby, baby, why are you doing this?
because Will's dead, Mom, and it was all because of a stupid grade.
I'm so sorry.
I, uh, finished up the case report.
Yeah. Thanks. I'll take it.
okay.
so, uh, it was all fairly pointless, wasn't it?
depends on what you're talking about.
well, I mean, uh, you know, we could have run every play in the book, and we still wouldn't have saved him, right?
true.
you know, when, um...
when I came into this job, the guy that I took over for gave me some advice.
he, said, uh, stay with the facts, stick with your training, and don't take it home with you.
so, how-how's that been going for you, huh?
it was the worst advice I ever got.
the facts are never what they appear to be, and there's no amount of training that can prepare you for what people are capable of doing to each other.
and what about taking it home with you?
well, I wouldn't say that it helps me sleep, but it gets the job done.
???
the patient was vomiting when she got to the ER and Dr. Katz diagnosed probable gastroenteritis but I noticed in her file she'd been having headaches for three weeks
and upon exam I found a subtle visual field deficit.
so you ordered an MRI and found the brain mass.
at what point did you decide it was smart to transfer her to another hospital?
NYPH has the best neurosurgery department in the city.
we are perfectly capable of performing this surgery here.
all due respect, the mass is impinging on this lady's brain stem and our best neurosurgeon's up in the Catskills.
this transfer is the best chance she's got.
she's hypertensive and her pulse is falling.
if something happens to her on route we're going to be liable!
don't ever do this again.
she's been getting progressively more hypertensive and bradychardic.
we have to control her intracranial pressure.
and 100 of mannitol and give her 250 dexamethasone.
who'll be receiving the patient?
a doctor Nathan Friedman, it's all in the order.
10 HOURS MISSING
there was a code blue at Dr. Loza's ward around 11: 30 P. M.
she was paged repeatedly but didn't show up, so, the staff got concerned.
when was the last time anybody saw her?
she was up on the roof for a transport around, uh, 10: 00 P. M.
now, did anything out of the ordinary happen during her shift?
define out of the ordinary. Dr. Loza handles up to 30 patients at a time.
with any number of illnesses.
sounds like she's under a lot of pressure. Any chance she just up and quit?
if she was an intern I'd say, Sure.
but as a third-year resident she's seen it all by now.
this one is hers.
Mr. Cooper, what's the number you use to page doctors here?
okay, thanks.
I'll leave you to it, then. - All right, thank you.
Hey, Viv, it's Martin.
listen, um, our missing person received ten pages from a nonhospital number about an hour before she disappeared.
Yeah, would you run it for me?
Yeah, it's, uh, 718-555-0132.
okay, thanks.
she received ten pages from that number last night.
sorry.
what about this card? Anybody send her flowers?
not that I know of.
how about her boyfriend? - Well, maybe.
are there any, uh, nurses or residents that may have a problem with Dr. Loza?
Erica's the resident everybody loves to hate.
she's got great instinct, she's quick on her feet, unlike some slackers she'll go above and beyond for her patients.
I understand that the two of you had an altercation last night.
Erica authorized a patient's transfer without my consent.
is that something she's done before?
no, but yesterday wasn't her finest day.
and why is that?
one of her patients suffered massive internal bleeding.
why did Mr. Lewis crash? - He developed a hemothorax post-op.
well, how the hell did that happen?
I'm not sure yet.
he was fine when I did my rounds. - Is that her?!
is that the bitch that put my dad into a coma?!
Mr. Lewis, I'm Dr. Loza. - What did you do to him?!
your father is in our I. C.U. He is stable and on pressors.
he could die at any moment.
I understand you're upset but I don't want some beaner M. D. from San Juan treating my dad!
what did you say to me? - Security!
nobody talks to me like that!
I swear to God, if something happens to him...
??? - I will bury you!
you hear me?!
we're used to grieving families but Mr. Lewis was out of control.
what happened to Mr. Lewis' father?
he, uh, passed away in our I. C.U.
Dr. Loza responsible for that?
I'm not at liberty to say.
can we dispense with the protocol, please?
you'll need a subpoena. It's hospital policy.
I'll get a subpoena but if Dr. Loza dies while we're waiting for it, what are you going to do?
lay it off on the hospital policy?
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
now, if you'll excuse me.
12 HOURS MISSING
he's the son of one of Erica's patients. He threatened her at the hospital last night.
I've never seen him before.
okay, what about this card? Does it mean anything to you?
no, I'm sorry.
and how long have you two been together?
on and off for five years since she was in med school.
can't be easy dating somebody so committed to their work.
I guess I just got used to it.
do you mind giving us a writing sample?
please?
you guys think I did something to her?
I'm in love with Erica, why would I hurt her?
you tell us.
look, so, maybe things haven't been perfect between us lately.
what happened, did you have a fight?
this isn't about me. - Then what is it about?
I think she's been hiding something.
Hey! Oh, what are you doing here?
Dr. Moss said I could find you down here.
what's wrong?
I just spoke to our travel agent. She said you cancelled our trip to St. Lucia.
um... - What the hell's going on, babe?
they, uh, they rescheduled the boards prep for that week.
no, are you serious? We've been planning on this thing for months.
I know, I don't know what to tell you.
I have to take that course.
and so you just cancelled the trip without even talking to me?
I'm sorry, but I've been making choices by myself since I was six years old.
Oh, now you're going to throw growing up in foster care in my face?
you know what my career means to me.
Yeah, I do.
Seth, come back. Stop!
I called the hospital last week to get her alternate vacation dates.
but they told me there were no prep courses scheduled for that week.
so, she's not only hiding something from you, she lied to you.
I guess so.
she make a habit of that?
no, I mean, I didn't think so.
I would've called her out on it but she never came home.
the same day Loza's travel agent refunded her credit card for that vacation, she took out a $5, 000 cash advance.
Oh, well, maybe that five grand's connected to that threatening note.
m- Maybe.
well, how are you doing on the foster care?
well, Loza went into the system when she was six.
she got bounced from home to home till she was 12 and was ultimately placed with, uh, a Camilla Russo.
any chance this Russo lives in Long Island City?
red Hook. Why?
okay, check this out. Because look here.
we tracked the pages that Loza got to a payphone at the corner of 23rd and Queens Plaza.
all right, I'm going to put an agent on the phone and get NYPD to canvass the area.
Yeah.
well, haul him in.
Thanks.
new York State Police just picked up Peter Lewis on a DUI.
I shouldn't have been driving; I know that.
take your aspirin. - Well, my old man passed away.
just take your aspirin.
this isn't about your DUI.
we're looking for Dr. Erica Loza.
apparently you said some pretty harsh things to her last night.
Yeah, damn right I did.
my dad checks into the hospital to get a pacemaker.
next thing I know, he's dead.
well, that would give you plenty of motive to do something to her, wouldn't you say?
except I-- I didn't do anything to her.
according to our records, um, you were escorted from the hospital at, uh, 8: 50 P. M.
your bartender says you didn't get to the bar till 1: 00 A. M.
you called McGills? - You bet we did.
we're also checking every camera within a block of that hospital.
and if we find something that shows you did something to her,
no, I didn't, I didn't do anything, okay?
I wasn't, I wasn't waiting for her.
I was, I was calling people about my dad.
I was on the phone to my sister when the doctor came out.
wait, I'll call you right back.
there are at least six vials of morphine and a jar of hydrocodone missing.
and what do you want from me, Ana?
excuse me?
I know my nurses, all right? They're not stupid enough to steal drugs.
they've got kids and mortgages. They need their jobs.
and residents don't?
no, they don't! They just pass through here and do whatever the hell they need to do to get licensed.
look, I'm giving you a day to handle this or I'm going to report it, and then it won't just be your intern's ass on the line, you understand?
it kind of explained some things.
how do you mean?
doctors on drugs making mistakes, and patients like my dad paying the price.
and what happened to Dr. Loza after that?
I don't know, she took off.
you don't happen to know the name of the nurse, do you?
Yeah, yeah, I checked. Her name is, uh, Ana Griggs.
Yeah, I figured I need to know that for my lawsuit.
look, uh, can I go now?
no. Not until I verify your story.
in the meantime, sober up.
the nurses do inventory every 12 hours.
ana Griggs did the last one at 9: 30 P. M. last night.
hmm, ladies first. - Thank you.
Hey, Lucy, where are we on the footage?
I've looked through the first seven hours.
thirteen entries into that supply closet and so far it's all pharm techs and nurses.
the scanned ID comes up here and I'm matching it to the footage.
okay, how many are left? - Six more.
next one is George Young, a pharmacy tech.
wait a minute.
is that Erica?
well, it's definitely not George Young.
16 HOURS MISSING
where were you last night?
at home. - You never left?
what's this about?
this is about you stealing drugs from the hospital with Dr. Erica Loza and selling them on the street.
what? Erica?
you've got to be kidding me.
yesterday afternoon she stole six vials of morphine and a 200 count container of hydrocodone tablets using your key pass.
I lost my key pass yesterday.
why didn't you tell anybody about it?
because I found it a little later.
come on, quit lying to us, George.
I'm not lying!
you know, maybe you thought she was going to turn on you so you killed her.
No! Look, we're not dope dealers.
Erica and I are just friends from church.
wait a minute! I had lunch with her yesterday, a-and I swear about an hour later is when I noticed my key pass was gone.
okay, so, what? You're saying she stole it?
I know, it's weird.
but lately, I think Erica's been going through some things.
Hey, you okay?
a tough day in there, huh?
no, no. Nothing like that.
you want to talk about it?
no, thanks. It's not important.
you ever feel like a hypocrite?
every time I tell my son to study.
you don't know what it took to get where I am.
well, actually, I do.
it's pretty impressive.
that's not what I meant.
there are things I've done...
people I've hurt to get what I wanted.
we all got regret.
when I was little, I got sick a lot.
I remember going to the free clinic to see the doctor.
I was always amazed by how important he was to so many people.
I need to matter so badly.
I decided right then that's what I wanted to do.
and I did what I had to do to get what I wanted.
but now...
all I can see is how cruel and selfish I've become.
you're not cruel and selfish.
Yes, I am.
and the worst thing is, I don't know if I can change.
did she tell you what she felt so guilty about?
no.
but do you think it might be connected to her stealing drugs?
I don't know, man.
but if Erica did do that, there's got to be something else going on.
Erica is not a drug user.
then why was she stealing drugs from the hospital?
I don't know. This is the first I've heard about it.
what exactly put Mr. Lewis in a coma?
he has nothing to do with this.
Dr. Loza steals drugs from the hospital on the same day a patient that she is attending dies.
and you expect me to believe that this is a coincidence?
what do you want from me? - The truth.
was Loza high when she was attending Mr. Lewis post-op which resulted in his death?
what are you covering up?
I'm not covering up anything.
then tell me what I need to know.
okay, if you don't tell me what I need to know, I'm going to tip off the DOH that you have doctors who are using drugs under your supervision.
look...
Mr. Lewis' hemothorax wasn't Erica's fault.
then whose fault was it?
an intern by the name of Ian Geddes.
Mr. Geddes?
special Agent Fitzgerald, Agent Taylor.
what am I doing here? I'm missing work.
we're looking for Dr. Erica Loza.
I don't know where she is.
why don't you take a seat?
so, we hear you killed one of her patients yesterday.
I'm not at liberty to talk about this.
we also hear your career might be over.
there's a hospital inquiry going on right now and it's going to show that you punctured his subclavian vein while inserting an IV and you killed him.
that's not the whole story.
why were you working on Dr. Loza's patient, anyway?
look, I don't even know.
she asked me to cover for her but when I couldn't insert Mr. Lewis' line...
I got frustrated.
so I went looking for her.
Ian, what the hell are you doing here?
Mr. Lewis needs a new line. - Just go back upstairs!
hurry up, let's go!
what's this? I told you no witnesses.
he's just an intern. - But now he's seen us!
where are you taking this patient?
you shouldn't have came down here.
you're right.
stop it! Get off him! Please, just get him out of here.
you keep your mouth shut.
listen to me. You never saw anything, understand?
just get back upstairs. Now!
so who was this patient? - I don't know.
I didn't see him on our floor.
why the hell didn't you report this in the first place?
I was waiting to confront Erica but when she got back, Mr. Lewis was already crashing.
I figured I already had enough to deal with.
17 HOURS MISSING
Viv, I got some info on the patient that Erica smuggled to this guy.
he's an 18 year old male who was brought into the ER three days ago with a broken nose, broken ribs, and internal bleeding.
the patient have a name?
no, unfortunately, whoever brought him in gave all fake information.
Erica removing a patient from the hospital is a big risk.
I mean, she could lose her medical license.
Yeah, you know, I'll bet you that gunman threatened her.
which could mean that he had to get rid of her in order to cover his tracks.
we got a hit off the prints from that ER admit form.
a ten point match.
thank you, Roger. - Let me see this.
Okay...Jeff Ellis, minor charges.
possession, petty larceny, uh...
Viv, take a look at this. This is interesting.
not only did he check the patient in, but two days later, he smuggled him out.
I don't know where Jeff is at.
Mm-hmm.
but he lives here, right?
but I don't keep tabs on him.
you seen this girl? - No.
what happened to your eye?
it's none of your business.
you want me to match the other one?
what, you trying to tell me you patched that up yourself?
if I find out Dr. Loza's been here and you're lying to me,
I'm gonna arrest you right now.
no. Look...
all right.
she fixed my cut, but that's all that happened.
we were supposed to meet here tomorrow morning, but Jeff kept paging me about an hour ago, and I couldn't get back to him.
what do you want me to do? Jeff's not here.
I have to find him.
I'm a doctor, and his friend Dom is in bad shape.
Yeah, well, Jeff said he'd be fine, so...
no. Something must have gone wrong.
Dom's got three broken ribs and internal bleeding.
he needs to be on morphine and antibiotics.
maybe you give me the stuff, I'll make sure he gets it.
do you know how to dilute morphine with saline and administer the exact dosage?
uh, no. But maybe you could show me.
look, Pam...
I get that Jeff's your boyfriend, and you're trying to protect him and Dom from Yuri, but I owe these guys.
I owe them my life.
what happened to your eye? - Nothing. It's fine.
I have a suture kit in my bag. I can fix that cut in ten minutes, if you let me in.
please. I'm not the cops.
I'm just trying to help.
all right. Come in.
Jeff called an hour later.
he said he needed her help. So Erica talked to him and then she split.
and where'd she go?
I don't know. And I didn't ask.
that way if Yuri comes back, I can't tell him anything, no matter what he does.
Yuri do that to your eye?
What'd your boyfriend do to piss him off?
Yuri hijacks trucks in New Jersey.
Jeff did a job for him, but it must have gone bad, 'cause Yuri went after Dominic, gave him a beat down, then he came after me.
Dominic Mancuso? -Yeah, he's an old buddy of Jeff's.
okay.
okay.
so, listen, the call from Jeff to Pam's apartment came from another pay phone in Long Island City, less than a mile from the one that paged Erica right before she went missing.
we should re-canvass between them with Jeff and Dom's pictures.
start with motels and SROs since Dom's not mobile.
okay, do we know anything more about him?
well, he doesn't have a record, but when I ran his background, it turns out he lived in the same foster home with Erica from '94 to '97.
when she lived with Camilla Russo?
Yep, and Jeff Ellis was there, too.
so when was the last time you saw Jeff or Dominic?
little Dom-- I haven't seen him since he was a kid, but I did run into Jeff, though, a few months, uh, back.
it was at the Fulton Street soup kitchen.
so... what's he done?
he found Erica, and it looks like he convinced her to sneak Dominic out of the hospital.
that day at the soup kitchen, I told Jeff about Erica's residency at St. Agatha's.
Ooh, he was mad, he was mad. He just stormed off.
Really? Why would he be upset about that?
when Erica was in eighth grade,
I had to have an emergency hysterectomy.
I had no health insurance.
within the year, I was practically bankrupt.
Oh, hustle! Hey, Jeff, give him a break. The ball is bigger than he is.
Oh, hey, pussycat. Come, sit, watch. The boys are playing.
a man from the bank just called. He said you left your coat there today.
well, that's very nice of him.
is this about those bills I saw on your desk?
they all say final notice.
Hey, hey, not past that hydrant.
come on back. That's it.
we'll talk about it at dinner, okay?
about what?
it's complicated.
you're going to send us back, aren't you?
look, Erica.
I'm up to my eyeballs in medical bills, you know?
the state aid isn't enough.
the, the bank is threatening to take the house, the car.
we're all going to wind up on the street.
but where are we supposed to go?
who's going to take us? - Erica, it'll be okay.
I promise.
I've lived in eight homes before this.
at every one of them, I got beat up just for getting good grades.
I want to keep you...but I can't.
I can't keep you all.
I'll, I'll get a job after school. I can work weekends.
Oh, baby girl, I wish, I wish that would be enough, but it won't be.
please, Camilla?
there you go.
then keep me.
just me.
I need to stay here.
I won't make it otherwise.
please.
be okay.
I knew that Erica had a, had a chance at making something out of her life, you know, but, uh, Dom and Jeff they needed more than, than I could give.
it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
and were you able to find them a place to live?
there were no takers for two boys with discipline problems.
a group home, huh?
Yep, you got it. I tried to visit.
Jeff would just curse me out, and Dom...
Yeah, and were they aware of Erica's decision?
I took responsibility for that, but Jeff could never forgive either one of us. Never.
Jeff called Pam from the pay phone down the street.
the manager confirms that they checked in yesterday.
what room? - Number nine.
Jeff Ellis, FBI, open up!
you ready?
FBI! Get down! Don't move!
get off me! I got a gun on you.
get on the floor. On the floor!
Where's Erica Loza?
where is she?
19 HOURS MISSING
I haven't seen Erica since I was, like, 11 years old.
I don't know.
did you kill her?
I didn't touch her. - I didn't ask you if you touched her.
I asked you if you killed her. Did you kill her?
no.
look, she's--she went out, all right? She went to go buy bus tickets.
she's supposed to be helping Dom and I get out of town.
tickets to where?
I don't know--she said Ohio, okay? She should be back by now.
see, here's the thing that I don't understand.
why would Erica go out of her way to help you?
she owed us.
simple as that.
if we don't get him out of here now, Yuri will find us and he will take Dom out.
patients don't get murdered in hospitals.
you don't know these guys, Erica.
they think I stole from them.
did you? - No.
I didn't, I swear.
I'll make sure security keeps an eye on the room.
no, that's not good enough.
they'll just follow us when he gets released or when he gets sent to County.
then, if you're this worried, we should call the police.
man, are you slow? That ain't going to do anything.
we have to get him out of here now.
I'm not going to let him leave before he's ready.
so it's still the same with you, huh?
just do what you got to do, and screw the rest of us.
I don't know why I thought you would have changed.
excuse me, nurse.
I'm looking for a Dominic Mancuso.
can you spell the name?
begins with M.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nobody here with that name.
you sure? He's about five-ten, dark hair.
he came in really torn up.
he's not on the intake log.
maybe I'll take a look around myself. See if I can find him.
I can't let you do that.
you know, patient privacy rights and all that.
right.
well, if he does turn up, tell him I'm thinking of him.
I'll see what I can do, but like I said, there's no one by that name.
when she saw him, she knew what I meant.
so, we got Dom out of there and she's been taking care of him all night.
all right, what's Yuri's last name?
Ovsenko. - All right, thanks a lot.
well, if she bought tickets, she didn't use her credit card.
look, she went to go buy tickets.
if she didn't show up there, then I don't know what happened to her.
all right, here's what we're gonna do.
we're gonna to talk to Dominic.
and if I find out you've been lying to us, well, uh...
we're not going to be as nice as we've been so far, okay?
let's go. Come on.
Where'd the doc go? I need something for the pain.
he'll be back in a minute.
he just went to see if he could find a priest.
I'm supposed to ask you if there any immediate family members or friends that you would like to see before，before you go.
go where?
unfortunately, um... you have a pulmonary embolism, and with the other injuries that you sustained, they can't give you any blood thinner.
so it's just a question of time now.
to hell with this, man.
I told Jeff he should have never hooked up with Yuri.
and now you're the one who's paying the ultimate price.
listen, Dom...
since you're in this position is there anything that you want to get off your chest, that you want to talk about before you go?
like what?
DOM, listen to me.
if the cops find Erica dead, they're gonna pin it on Jeff.
the jury's going to believe that.
and unfortunately you're not going to be around to contradict that.
so if you're trying to protect him, it-it's just not going to work.
if you find her body, it ain't 'cause he killed her.
then who did?
it wasn't supposed to be like this.
she promised she'd help us start fresh.
but first we had to deal with Yuri.
I need to know what really happened, right now.
what really happened is that crap-for-brains over here decided to put his paws in my business.
now here we are.
all right, tell her the truth.
tell her why I did it.
I was jacking trucks for this guy named Yuri.
I had to unload a pallet of iPods to a hookup in Queens and take the money back to him.
you told me you didn't steal from him.
I didn't. Your patient over here did.
and he thought it was a great idea to hide it from me, to make a point.
DOM, these guys nearly killed you. Tell him where the money is.
no, you don't get it, do you? It doesn't matter.
if I bring back the money right now, I'm still as good as dead.
then I'll give it to him.
you?
he wants his money back, right?
I'll say I took it from you.
Dom...tell me where it is.
no. Jeff's got to promise.
all right, I promise, okay?
I'm done. I'm done with Yuri, I'm done with all of it.
it's in a Duffle bag in a storage locker at the Castle Hill Y.
the key's in my jacket.
I'm going to give him his money back.
and then you're going to leave town. I have money to set you up.
do we have a deal?
sure.
give me the key.
then you guys showed up before we heard back from her.
where was she taking the money?
Yuri's got an empty building up in the Bronx.
behind his wheel and tire on East 167th and Third Avenue.
you'll be happy to know your blood work checks out great and you should be out of here in no time.
what about me dying?
Wow.
wow, it's a miracle.
it's all there.
now you made me lose count.
I have to start all over again.
or you can tell me where Jeff and Dom are.
and then, I'll give you the money.
I don't know where they are.
like you didn't know where they were at the hospital?
blue team in position.
hold until we get a visual on the suspect.
exits covered.
red team holding at back entrance.
sierra One has a green light.
you protected your friends.
I like that.
maybe you can be my friend, too, hmm?
I'm leaving. - I don't think so.
the debt's not paid.
you have your money! - But the delay was costly.
so now, either you or your friends...
he's got a gun! Take him down.
it's okay. Come on.
come here. It's okay. Come on, go.
Hey, Erica. I'm Martin Fitzgerald. I'm with the FBI.
Hi. - How are you doing? You okay?
I'm fine.
there are two guys at the Queensboro Motel in LIC, one of them is injured.
we know. We know. Dominic's back at the hospital.
is he okay?
Yeah, he, he's going to be fine.
how did you find them? - Looking for you.
I didn't know what to do. I owed them.
I think you paid your debt.
can you give me a ride to the hospital?
Yeah, I'd be glad to, but, uh...
I think you might want to ask him.
pay now.
pay later.
pay later.
pay later.
last notice.
Hey, Dad?
when you're solving quadratic equations, is it factoring or completing the square that only works when the solution's rational?
I was with you up till "solving."
are we gonna lose the bar?
we'll be fine.
well, I wish there was something I could do to help.
I could pay you less.
I already work for free.
how about you pay me?
the exterminators still here?
I need to talk to them. -- Yeah, they're in the back.
what are you guys doing?
it's a miracle.
what are you talking about? -- The statue.
she's crying.
please... please back up.
I need you to stop pushing each other.
I know you've been waiting around a really long time.
I promise we'll get to everyone.
I know it's getting late.
just be patient, all of you, and we'll get to you all.
thank you.
Thanks. Go ahead.
excuse me.
honey,
I can't believe I slept that long. I only put my head down for a minute.
why didn't you wake me up? - Well, you need the rest.
okay. Well, we need to close the bar.
Hey, I'm sorry, everybody. Listen, I got to close up now.
Ken, some of these people been waiting over two hours.
I understand. I thank you for your patience, everybody,
I really do, but special circumstances dictate that I close.
thank you. Could you please make in orderly fashion in your way to the door.
thank you. Thank you very much.
dad we need their money.
I can't do this anymore.
I want you to go upstairs, lock the door, get ready for bed, okay?
I'll be up later.
okay, boss, we're looking for Ken Gilroy...
40, owner of Gilroy's Bar and No Grill.
also missing is the weeping statue of St. Theresa that made this place famous the past few weeks.
remember that little bodega in Queens last year had the Jesus empanada?
but the empanada didn't have the tears.
Yeah, at least you could eat it.
Gilroy's 15-year-old daughter, Addy, she's the one who called it in.
mother is deceased.
NYPD notified CPS.
I just told them to meet us at headquarters.
also, the back door shows evidence of pry marks.
the register's empty, so it looks like a burglary gone wrong.
statue's also missing.
maybe somebody wanted their own little miracle maker.
there's a lot of desperate people out there, man.
you know, the first thing to go are the eyes.
I would revise that and say that the first thing to go are the observational skills.
there is a bullet lodged there.
you want to use these?
thanks for meeting me. -- Sure.
I'm on my way I mean I've got to you know, get to work, but...
right. --No problem.
look, I'm sorry for just showing up at your apartment.
I was affraid if I called you'd tell me not to come.
Yeah, why did you come?
I wanted to see my son.
you signed the papers, Brian. --I made a mistake.
right.
I thought I was okay with giving up my rights.
but I'm his dad.
and just because we're not together doesn't mean that he isn't going to need me in his life.
I'm sorry, I...
I know this is a lot to handle.
look...
the truth is, I think...
I think I knew this conversation was going to happen,
I just...
I didn't expect it to happen quite this soon.
so the guy who answered the door of your apartment's a little too scary to be the babysitter.
I'm assuming he's your boyfriend?
I'm going to need some time to figure this out.
you know?
what I can tell you is...
whatever decision I make, I...
I think it has to be final...
for all of us.
right?
I understand.
give Finn a kiss for me.
sure.
I'm Special Agent Malone with the FBI.
I'm... here to assist in... finding your father.
and I was just wondering if you could answer a few questions?
sure. - It's... just some hot chocolate.
so...
the last time you saw your father was last night?
Yeah. I mean, I thought he'd be back soon.
he didn't even take his cell.
but then in the morning, he wasn't there.
and I saw the statue was gone.
do you think something happened to him because of the statue?
that's what we're trying to determine.
how long has he owned the statue? -- As long as I can remember.
my mom gave it to him.
and then after she died, he brought it to the bar.
when did you notice that the statue was...
crying?
a couple weeks ago.
when people heard about it, the bar got crazy.
and I understand that you were charging to put prayers in the box?
I mean, my dad said that since it helped people, we could ask for donations.
anybody object to that?
Why?
we recovered a bullet from the bar.
is there something you want to tell me?
it was... it was a couple days ago.
we'd just closed up, and I forgot to lock the back door.
that's a lot of money.
you know, it almost broke my leg. -- Don't worry, I'll buy you a new one.
we're doing pretty good.
if people keep coming in like this, it's going to be okay.
and it's all thanks to St. Theresa.
I don't know why this is happening, but I appreciate it.
nobody move!
get behind me.
come on!
Where's the money?
we're closed up. -- That doesn't answer my question!
Where's the safe?!
just go.
just go. We won't call the cops.
what are you doing, man? Back up.
Hey, no matter how bad things are, this is not the answer.
don't make me shoot you! -- Dad, stop!
you don't want to do this to us.
d-don't be stupid, man!
it's just money.
and the statue saved his life.
my dad said it was a miracle.
why didn't he call the police?
he said that if people heard about a robbery, they'd be too scared to come see the statue.
and we really need the money.
there's really no way for me to say this without sounding like a jerk, so...
is there any possibility that your father could've faked the statue?
he wouldn't do that.
is that what you think?
you know, it doesn't really matter what doesn't really matter what I think.
could you just excuse me for a minute?
Audrey Salke, CPS.
Jack Malone. -- Firm grip.
I hate it when I get the dead fish.
glad I passed the test.
with flying colors. Is she ready?
I was kind of hoping that she didn't have to go into the system right away.
paperwork's already moving. And there's no one else to take her.
there's questions that we need to ask her.
I was kind of hoping she could stay here.
come on.
it's not a bad thing for the FBI to owe you one.
how long do you want? -- How long can I get?
Logan Group Home locks its doors at 6: 00.
thank you.
the bullet from the bar was too mangled to I.D.
NYPD is looking for robberies with similar MOs.
you know, I don't get it.
how can people believe that this whole crying statue thing's real?
Danny, that's why it's called a leap of faith.
it involves trust.
people went to the statue because it gave them hope.
if I'm a believer and somebody scams me, I'm doing something about it for sure.
Yeah, maybe someone did.
I mean, some of these sound really desperate.
listen to this one.
please, don't let my Tony join the Latin Kings.
that life took his brother.
I don't think I could survive burying another of my children.
please give me the strength not to drink anymore.
I know it's my last chance.
make him propose.
nobody could love him as much as I do.
some jumper cables.
or a new car.
you know, I mean, whatever you... whatever you think is best.
I don't do drugs.
you know...
my wife, she's been sick a long, long time.
please take her so she doesn't suffer.
and tell her not to be afraid.
and then there's the less-charitable.
get rid of the statue or I will burn this bar to the ground.
God does that? -- Not since the Old Testament.
let me take it to the lab for prints.
I called you, like, five times.
Oh, yeah. I got...
I was...
we need to talk.
okay.
Brian wants to be a part of Finn's life again.
And?
and...
I'm gonna have to figure out what to do.
don't look at me like that. I already know what you think.
you don't know what I think. And it doesn't matter what I think.
it matters what you think. -- I don't know what I think.
that's I don't want to hear. -- Then don't ask me...
excuse me. Am I interrupting something?
Yes! -- No!
I'll talk to you later.
sorry.
your timing sucks.
looking for a missing person. -- Give me a call if you find 'em.
I'm about to interview a Luis Ochoa. He broke into the bar last week.
apparently, Ken caught him halfway out the door with St. Theresa in his hands.
why wasn't this in the initial report? -- Ken wouldn't press charges.
he said the guy worked for him. It was all a misunderstanding.
he's a liar.
you're good at this.
Hello, Luis.
I didn't do anything wrong. -- Ever?
that's very impressive.
so breaking into a bar, that's not wrong?
how about killing the bar's owner? Is that wrong?
somebody killed Ken?
very convincing. You know, the eyes, they're good, but the mouth, we're gonna have to work on the mouth, Luis.
I did break in to get the statue, but I didn't hurt Ken.
when I told him about my son, he promised to help me.
you said your son had a fever.
he's a lot sicker than that. He can barely breathe.
St. Theresa will cure Jaime. -- It's a statue.
you need to take him to a hospital.
I can't. We're not legal. -- Then I'll take him.
look, we gotta do something.
he could die.
you were given the miracle of St. Theresa for a reason.
I believe it was to save my son.
come on.
do you have a car?
and then all of sudden your son just got better?
she saved his life.
she...? St. Theresa?
he said a lady's voice told him to wake up.
okay, Luis, and that night, that's the last time that you saw Ken, right?
Yes.
if he's out there with St. Theresa, he's doing good for people.
Luis, this is the address of a free clinic...
just in case your son needs another miracle.
we got security video from a loading dock near the bar the night of the attempted robbery.
can we get an angle on the - on that license plate right there? -- Let's see.
there. -- I'll run it through DMV.
okay.
come on, Jason, take off the mask.
freeze it. Blow it up.
I've got an I.D. linked to the plate.
what are the odds the Gilroys are having a family reunion this week?
Addy, this is the man who tried to rob your father's bar.
his name is John Gilroy.
do you know him?
Yeah, they're brothers.
were you aware of any problems between the two of them?
I don't know.
Addy, I know this is difficult, but if you know something, you're not protecting anyone by keeping it to yourself.
Ken isn't my father.
John is.
so, if John is your father, why are you living with your uncle?
my father was a drug addict.
Ken... he's raised me since I was ten.
he loves me and takes care of me.
okay. Where's your biological mom?
I don't know. I never met her.
and when was the last time you saw John?
five years ago.
he would drop me off at the bar when he was using again.
Ken tried to keep it from me, but it was hard not to see.
all right.
Where's the olive?
Oh, incorrect.
one more shot.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Must be...
where is it?
wait a second.
there it is.
you want it?
not if it's been in my ear.
what?
no hello?
go upstairs, okay?
you're late.
I'm not a punctual guy.
you're three days late.
I am parched.
what's your problem?
my problem? Have you ever stopped for one minute to think about what you're doing to your daughter?
no, I'm not letting you put her through it anymore.
who are you to tell me what to do?
I'm her father.
that's not her fault.
do the right thing.
stay out of her life.
you can wipe that look off your face, 'cause it's only a temporary loan.
whatever you need to tell yourself.
at first, he'd call to say hi, but really, he just wanted to ask Ken for money.
and then, after a while, he just stopped calling.
you know, some people are not really equipped to be parents.
they do the best they can.
Ken always said that my dad showed he loved me when he gave me away.
do you know where John might be?
well, when I lived with him, we had an apartment in Howard Beach somewhere.
Hola.
so, how did your talk with Brian go?
he wants to be a part of Finn's life.
understandable.
I have enough moving pieces already, right?
I need another man like I need a hole in my head.
I know.
you don't have to say it. It's not about what I need.
it's... about what my son needs.
you are absolutely right. I'm glad I didn't have to say it.
Jack's never gonna be able to handle this, Elena.
listen, if he can't, that's something that you need to find out.
right.
all right.
you know, John's rap sheet doesn't exactly scream killer.
I mean, he's got a lot of busts for possession, in and out of rehab, but that's it.
well, Ken's brother is not his only problem.
I've been going through his financials. Now, the bank shows $40, 000 a month in cash deposits coming into the bar that aren't showing up in his books.
any idea where it's coming from? -- Not yet.
but, you know, a bar is a cash business...
perfect for money laundering.
okay, the prints from the "Burn this bar down" note belong to this guy over here.
okay, his hobbies are extortion and loan-sharking.
you got to love it.
Ken asks for a miracle. Instead, he gets a drug addict brother and this.
look familiar?
it's got your prints all over it, Tommy.
and people saw you going into the bar the night Ken was last seen.
hell, yeah, I went in there.
charging people money to see a miracle wasn't right.
Jesus himself kicked the moneylenders out of the temple.
sometimes, you just got to ask yourself, "What would Jesus do?
Yeah, well, we're asking ourselves, "What did Tommy do?
Tommy didn't do nothing.
let's see here...
40 grand in cash deposits showed up in Ken's account the first of every month.
at the end of the month, that cash was used to buy cases of scotch - from a company that you owned. - Now, that's what?
that's 150 cases per week, and it's clear from the bar's inventory that they weren't all delivered, so that's what I'd call money laundering.
well...
seeing as how it was his bar, that would be on Ken, now.
Yeah, but the murder charge for killing him when he wanted to stop, that would be on you.
whoa, hold on.
I didn't do that. -- Then, what did you do?
okay.
Yeah, maybe I was unhappy about the statue but it didn't go the way you think it did.
this lovely piece of plaster attracts attention.
attention which could bring the State Liquor Authority and the IRS around, two organizations which will not exactly shine the light of forgiveness on either one of us.
I get it. You'll never see her in the bar again.
right. Because I'm taking her. -- Why?
you don't believe in this stuff. -- Untrue.
I have a firm belief that I can sell Her Holiness for some serious coin.
all right, we can get rid of her, but at least let me take her to some people she can help.
holy crap.
you actually believe this thing is magic.
please make me the next Mr. Pam Anderson.
Hey, that's not the way it works.
she gives you opportunities to change your life a chance to make things right.
I'm deeply moved.
but I got to take a leak.
when I get back, I want her wrapped up to go.
we're closed!
we're closed!
you will not be forgiven!
give me the statue. -- It's right there.
just take it and leave. -- You think that I'll...
so, that's what you're going with, Tommy?
a priest with a razor? -- That's the truth.
you're telling me that you turned your back on a potential homicide.
who am I to interfere with God's plans?
Yeah. I'll send it over now. Thanks for the help.
here's a sketch of Father Slasher.
great.
so the archdiocese said they need the day to talk it over with their counsel before they talk with us.
okay, give them an hour, call them back.
tell them if they don't cooperate, we release the story to the Post.
nice. Playing hardball. -- Jack, come here.
I have a lead on Ken's brother.
three years ago, Ken wrote a check for $700 to a transient hotel in Howard Beach.
I love transient hotels.
they put toe tags on the pillows instead of chocolates.
what are the chances that his brother's living there?
zero.
but there might be somebody down there that remembers where he went.
agent Malone?
I was just about to call you.
we're making tremendous progress.
good to hear. Is... Addy ready to go?
she's been really helpful in the investigation.
it'd be great if she could stay a longer.
cps has rules, and I'm not gonna let the FBI break them.
even if she has to stay in an institution?
I am not in love with the idea, but what's our option?
she can't sleep here. -- I do.
do you want to tell her or should I?
did you find him?
not yet.
how you doing?
none of this would have happened without me.
what do you mean?
I was cleaning.
I'm supposed to dust under the bottles once a week.
but I wasn't paying attention.
and I dried it off, but right away, it started crying.
so I hid it in the back.
I mean, I thought after a few days, it would dry out.
but then those guys found it, and everyone started coming to see it.
and my dad was so happy, I couldn't bring myself to tell him.
did you keep putting water on it? -- No. I never touched it again.
and it kept weeping.
Yeah.
I should have told him.
I don't really think that would have made any difference.
ms. Salke is here to take you somewhere where you can sleep tonight.
I'd rather stay here.
you know, I get that, but really can't help you there. Come on.
listen...
here's my business card.
give that to the person in charge of where you're going.
tell them to give me a call when you get there.
okay, thanks. -- Okay?
in the meantime, we'll keep looking for Ken until we figure out where he is.
I really don't like calling him Ken.
we'll keep looking for your father until we find him.
thank you.
okay.
so, is Addy Gilroy off to Logan? --Yes.
well, it's the best of our city's facilities.
that's like saying the Hudson's the cleanest of our polluted rivers.
the archdiocese called.
the priest is not a real priest, but they know who he is.
what's his angle?
well, he's been in and out of mental institutions in the last ten years, kicked out of two seminaries, and last year he assaulted one of the archbishop's staff.
he's waiting for me in Interrogation One.
great.
if he starts speaking in tongues... -- I'll let you know.
father Shepard.
how are you doing today?
fine. -- Good.
so, do you know why we brought you in?
I suspect it's due to my faith.
it isn't the first time I've experienced religious persecution.
it's not easy being a true believer.
what would you know about that?
I know that for those who have felt God's touch, that they don't always fit into the establishment's belief system.
that is painfully true.
I know, too, that if you held a razor to a bar owner's throat, that there has to be another side to that story.
so... what did you do to Ken Gilroy?
I saved him.
from what?
from godlessness.
you will not be forgiven. Give me the statue.
okay, okay, fine. It's right there. Just take it and leave.
you think that I'll let you off that easy?
after you sold your gift like a cheap whore?
Oh, please don't kill me.
my daughter depends on me.
I was trying to pay the bills. I'm sorry.
God bestowed you with a sign of his grace, and you chose to profit from it, from fools who pray for their worthless things.
true miracles are not of the flesh. They are of the soul.
I... I know.
it spoke to me.
who spoke to you?
I don't know who it was...
God or the statue,
I'm not sure...
but it did tell me what I need to do to fix my life.
he speaks to me, too.
then you understand what I need to do.
when I saw a man who had experienced a true miracle himself,
I knew my work there was done.
and after all that, you just let him walk away?
forgiveness is a virtue.
we're going to have to check out your apartment, Father Shepard.
I do hope you're telling me the truth.
he's fine.
St. Theresa told me so.
good.
then we can stop worrying.
so we found the statue in the priest's apartment.
fantastic.
if we were the Department of Missing Statues, we could go home.
we also followed up on the checks to the transient hotel.
the brother doesn't live there anymore, but the manager remembered his girlfriend's name.
she still in the area?
we have a probable. Martin's tracking her down.
listen... -- Look, Jack.
just let me talk for a sec. -- Look...
you go first.
the thing about Brian and I... -- I'm gonna go first.
I don't want you to let this guy back in your life but that's not my decision to make.
no, it's not.
you know, if I hadn't done a background check on him... which
I had no right to do...
he would probably be in our lives anyway.
Yes, that's true. -- So I realize that, you know...
you have to do what you have to do to take care of yourself and Shorty, you know, the little guy, and my job is to support you.
who are you and what have you done with Jack Malone?
well, my initial instinct was to plant four ounces of black tar heroin in his car and call the DEA.
I really want this to work out.
Yeah, so do I.
okay.
I don't know where Ken is.
what about your boyfriend, the goalie for the Rangers?
I don't want to get in trouble.
then I'd go with the truth.
they both were here. -- When?
this morning.
I figured it was brother-to-brother business, so I stayed out of it.
I don't know what I was thinking. I owed this guy money and I thought, "I could use a miracle, too."
you pulled the trigger.
I don't understand how you could pull the trigger.
I didn't.
the piece just went off in my hand. The guy I bought it from - said it was solid. -- Addy was right there.
what if you'd hurt her?
what did she say?
nothing. I didn't tell her it was you.
you didn't? - No.
when I was holding that gun and I saw her face...
she's just so grown up now, you know.
I thought, the true frigging miracle is that I'm standing here wearing this ridiculous mask so that she can't see what a dumb ass I am.
look, Johnny, we got to stop this.
I know.
I promise I won't bother you no more.
not for me. It's for Addy.
she needs to know her father again someday.
I don't want the next time she sees you to be on a slab at the morgue.
so what do we do?
they both got into John's car, and I haven't seen either of them since.
you have any cats in that place of yours?
no. Why?
you know, sometimes they rile up the drug-sniffing dogs.
okay.
okay.
John was supposed to carry some prescription meds across the Canadian border for this black-market pharmacist.
he got to the crossing and he saw one of those...
mountie cops checking cars, so he dumps the pills in the woods.
how much are they worth?
10000
the pharmacist sent a nasty-looking guy over to tell John that he better pay up soon or something bad was gonna happen.
I'll need the address of the pharmacist.
FBI. Get your hands up!
I got one.
Where's Ken?
I don't know. I thought he'd be back by now.
okay, John.
your friendly pharmacist already layered up with the high pressed firm.
it's no way you can compete with that, so why did you just cut the crap and tell me where you brother is.
he is in Canada. -- He's in Canada?
Oh, that's great so generally anywhere about the 49th parallel.
just outside the Lac Paul cross.
it's better.
he never should going down like this.
that's all I got.
$4, 000, but I'll get the rest.
I'm not running a bank.
then I'll sign over my bar.
I already have a business, one that he's made a lot less profitable.
I already told you, I'd go get it.
I don't trust you.
I'm not really sure why I ever trusted you.
then I'll go.
fine.
but if my supply is not back here by tomorrow morning,
I'll have to inform my cousin, and then you'll be a lot less helpful.
I believe he's already introduced himself.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
Addy needs you. If something were to happen, - she'd have nobody. -- All right, listen to me.
there was a prayer box, I put it next to the Theresa statue.
I come down to the bar one day to collect those prayers and I find one with Addy's handwriting.
you know what it said?
she prayed that you were safe, and you had somebody who loves you and that one day you'd come back and see her again.
Yeah.
you gotta have faith.
this will work out.
I told him where to go and he left.
and how long ago was this?
nine hours.
he was supposed to call as soon as he got back across the border.
okay. Listen. I need to know where you dropped the drugs, what kind of container they were in, everything.
all right?
okay, you ready? The license plate is New York State
Thanks.
I'm gonna fax you his picture right now.
thank you.
RCMP's on the lookout.
they have the best hats.
we've notified all New York state authorities, just in case he had an accident along the way.
we got a call coming in on Addy's cell phone.
unknown caller. Area code 905.
905's Ontario.
okay. Let me take this.
don't hang up. - Where's Addy?
she's not here.
who are you?
special Agent Jack Malone with the FBI.
how do I know you are who you say you are?
because your niece contacted us when you and St. Theresa went missing.
is she okay?
Yeah, she's fine.
we placed her with Social Services while we were looking for you.
now I want you to listen to me carefully.
do not cross the border with those pharmaceuticals.
I was just trying to help my brother. - He's fine. He's okay.
we have the pharmacist in custody.
now we're just trying to get you back. Are you okay?
I don't know. I think I'm losing my mind.
Yeah, you and me both. What's going on?
the night my brother tried to rob me...
I was a little freaked out, so I had some drinks.
that's when everything went a little Twilight Zone.
I blame you.
first you brought nothing but good, money, the crowds.
then it all goes south.
then my own brother's shoving a gun in my face.
I should just call the cops.
it's the right thing to do.
what did you say?
what do you mean?
the right thing for her"?
I heard a voice in my head.
it was clear as day.
Yeah, I think I've heard that voice.
might I suggest that it's the alcohol speaking?
well, maybe. But St. Theresa was right.
if St. Theresa could come to the phone right now, she would tell you to put down the drugs and head straight for the border as fast as you can.
do I sound like a lunatic?
Yes, but I've dealt with worse.
when you get to the border, contact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
tell them to contact us, and we'll come and pick you up.
okay. -- Okay.
miracle worker.
Amen.
we could sit in my office. I have...
I have comfortable chairs in there.
I know, but then I can't see the elevator.
Yeah, I know, but, you know, I can have someone call us - and tell us when they're here. -- I'm fine.
agent Malone?
do you think the statue's real?
I don't think it really matters.
you know, people got what they could out of it, and some of them even got what they thought they needed.
you must be the guy with the phone.
you must be the guy with the statue.
thank you.
it was nothing.
what?
just your... your face.
what about it?
nothing.
go home.
bother your boyfriend.
who is that? Who is that?
should we go see? Come on.
Oh, up. Here it is.
hello.
come on in.
come on in, hon.
I got the paper if you got the coffee.
Hi, Cate.
Hi.
listen, I can come back.
no, no, no. We're just getting ready to go.
Hey, Gavin, how you doing?
okay.
mom, this is stupid. I'm fine.
you're not fine, Gav.
we need to have Dr. Reeves take a look.
but I'm going to miss my trip to the planetarium.
no, not if we get moving. Let's go, buddy.
drive carefully.
Thanks.
I will be back after I drop him off.
Hey. Kiddo, hug it out?
see you, Cate.
Gavin's asthma?
Yeah. His breathing's way off.
even with the machine.
I don't know what's going on.
I'm so sorry.
and the worst thing is, he won't tell us when he has a problem, so he could wind up in the hospital again, or worse.
he's a smart kid, Julie. He'll figure it out.
in the meantime, he has you to whip him into shape.
you know, I just can't be there all the time.
what about you?
how are you doing?
kind of hung over.
besides that.
a little better.
I didn't mean to be such a drag last night.
you weren't.
you just needed to talk.
thanks for being there.
Hey, what are friends for, right?
God, I need a refill.
what about you?
I'm good, thanks.
are you expecting someone?
no. Why?
well, a delivery or something?
no.
there's a van.
he's pulling in your garage.
what?
the garage door is closing.
Oh, my God, someone is trying to get in.
lock the door.
I'll call 911.
Oh, my God.
911. What is your emergency?
help. We need help. Somebody's in the garage.
he's trying to break through the door.
okay, thanks.
911 call came in 45 minutes ago.
our missing persons are Julie Fisher and her neighbor Cate Connelly.
how do we know the neighbor was here?
well, her voice was on the 911 tape and Mr. Fisher said that Mrs. Connelly comes over here for coffee.
where is he?
on his way.
witnesses?
a gray van was seen leaving, but that's all we got.
ERT's not even sure how many abductors were here.
whoever decided to pull this off in broad daylight had some stones.
what was the motive?
out of the ten I can think of, off the top of my head, none of them are good.
where are we with the canvass?
Mmm, a couple of joggers ID'd the van as a mid- to late-'90s Ford.
we updated the APB.
okay. Forensics in the house?
uh, ERT's still working on the prints.
nothing's popped.
you know, look, this could be a sex crime, a murder, or a kidnapping.
we have to cover all bases.
Where's Sam? -- She's running down known sex offenders.
listen, we're setting up a trap and trace in case a kidnapper calls.
do the Fishers have money?
a few grand in savings.
I don't think it's enough for ransom.
well, where is Cate's husband?
we need to check their financials, too.
Yes, Richard Connelly is going to be here any minute.
Hey, Viv, do you think it's possible that Cate might be the target?
well, we can't rule it out.
the Connellys have an alarm system at their house, so maybe when she went over to Julie's, the kidnappers saw their chance.
man, we could really use some hard facts right about now.
I got to pick up Gavin at school in a couple hours.
what am I going to tell him?
what's going to happen?
at this point, uh, we're not sure.
I'd like to ask you a couple questions about your wife.
what did she do for a living?
she volunteers at Gavin's school and she teaches piano on the side, but that's it.
what about you? What do you do?
Lydell Insurance. I oversee the claims division.
could be an unpopular occupation, I imagine.
any disgruntled clients?
it's the commercial property division.
it's pretty low-key.
okay. Let's go back to your wife.
possible that she's involved in anything illegal?
no. No. What are you saying?
you think this wasn't random?
it's very possible that she was the target.
I need you to think back over the last month.
anything unusual happen?
doesn't matter. Big, small, anything?
there's this guy who does some work for us.
Julie had a problem with him a couple weeks ago.
what's the matter? You were doing great.
no, I wasn't.
I suck at this.
you do not suck.
can I tell you a secret?
you play a lot better than my husband.
he can barely do "Chopsticks."
are you okay?
honey, is there a problem with Mr. Riegert?
can you tell me what?
it's okay, honey.
just tell me what happened.
I was walking home from practice and he wanted me to go for a ride in his truck.
did you go with him?
no, I told him I didn't want to.
I know I'm not supposed to go with strangers.
but he got mad and grabbed my arm.
when did this happen?
last week after my lesson.
please don't tell him I told you.
I promise I won't. Okay?
and he's never going to bother you again.
I fired him as soon as Julie told me.
and how did he take that?
not well. He took a swing at me.
it turns out he was on parole.
police come and get him?
I - I guess they went to his place, but he had cleared out.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
where you headed?
I'm going to go interview Gavin Fisher.
you know, he was with his mother at his house two hours ago and now this.
can you imagine?
no, I can't.
makes me want to give Sophie a hug.
me, too.
Hey.
did you talk to Behavioral Sciences?
they think it's a single intruder, probably a sexual or revenge kidnapping.
it fits with Riegert.
you know, Sam, I don't think Ron's our guy.
well, why not? He's got motive.
he has no record of violence.
he's a convicted sex offender.
I would say he's our best suspect.
we bought into that neighborhood so we could be out of the city, safe.
okay.
do you have any reason to believe that Cate was in any danger?
not at all.
she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
well, we-we don't know that.
what else would it be?
I mean, Cate didn't have an enemy in the world.
well, do you?
I mean, you're a partner at a law firm that specializes in civil litigation.
any angry clients in the picture?
no one that would abduct my wife.
well, I'm still going to need a list of all your clients.
of course.
now, when was the last time you saw Cate?
three days ago.
were you out of town?
I was staying in a hotel.
troubles at home?
it's private.
not anymore.
it might be connected to her disappearance.
what are you saying?
that I had something to do with it?
but did you?
absolutely not.
and why would I?
I don't know.
maybe she wanted a divorce and you didn't want her to have half of your money.
look, I know this is difficult, but you need to explain yourself, Mr. Connelly.
it is true. Cate and I are having our problems.
it all came out a couple of nights ago.
see you tomorrow.
thanks again for dinner.
Thanks.
what's the matter?
you barely said a word all night.
you know that condo the-the firm has in Bahamas?
we should go.
I'd love that.
I could work by cell phone.
we could fly there tomorrow morning.
tomorrow? We can't just leave.
why not?
we're booked solid-- you're speaking at the hospital benefit on Friday.
blow it off.
all the partners will be there.
you'd be giving them the finger.
listen, I'm gone all the time.
I just want to make things up to you.
this isn't for me.
I'm the one saying we can't do it.
come on, Richard.
what is this?
I slept with someone.
who?
it was just, uh, someone I met at that conference in Denver.
it doesn't matter.
it matters to me.
how could you do this?
it just happened.
having sex with someone doesn't just happen.
I don't know.
because I just felt lonely.
what do you mean,"lonely"?
we are out almost every night.
we're not really together, Cate.
if it's not a party, it's another fund-raiser.
I do that for you, Richard.
I try to be who you want me to be.
I am so sorry.
there is no excuse.
I just want to make things right.
you should have thought about that beforeyou cheated on me.
I went to a hotel.
I attempted to call her and she never got back to me.
and now she's gone.
I'm going to need the name of the other woman.
Why? She has nothing to do with this.
and neither do I.
her name, please.
what did the kid have to say?
he doesn't know anything.
he's just traumatized that his mom is missing, you know?
so, you got a lead on Ron Riegert?
well, a friend of his said he likes to get hammered at this bar, so I'm going to check it out.
Danny, that's more like a rumor, not a lead.
I made a career out of rumors.
you're going to love this.
let me call you back.
Ron, don't do it.
don't do what?
don't do that.
what's that?
shut up. -- Okay.
where is Julie and Cate?
who? Julie...
the woman that got you fired.
Hey, I didn't lay a hand on that little girl.
I didn't say anything about a little girl.
Julie is missing and you're a suspect.
start talking.
okay.
she screwed me over.
I was pissed off, I admit that.
but I-I didn't hurt that lady, all right?
you should look at that other guy.
there's always another guy, huh?
Yeah, there is...I'm serious. -- Who's the other guy?
who's the other guy?
two weeks ago, right before I got let go.
he was hanging around outside her house.
I'll get that for you, Mrs. Fisher.
Thanks, Ron.
apparently, I'm not as tall as I think I am.
um, can you get the little one, too?
sure.
you ready for your big night in the city?
I can't believe Adam is doing this.
do you know how much those rooms cost?
it will be worth it.
you guys never get away.
you can't change your mind, Mom.
I just picked out the movies I'm gonna watch on Cate's big-screen.
that's right.
no turning back now.
thanks for watching him.
are you kidding?
we are gonna have a blast, aren't we, Gav?
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, there's no way that guy was there to fix the phone lines.
yeah? Is there anything else that you would like to pull out of your ass at this time?
I'm not lying to you, all right?
he had the wrong tools.
and when he left, he got into a truck with no logos on it.
the guy was all wrong.
I'm telling you, man.
so are you. Come on. Let's go.
let's go.
get out!
walk away before I change my mind.
go.
a park ranger found her about 30 minutes ago by the access road.
we've set up checkpoints.
what about Cate Connelly?
they're still searching.
I'm going to go talk to the husbands.
uh, would you mind if I took that one?
well, no arrows point to Adam Fisher.
you think he's behind this?
or Connelly.
I mean, he was having problems with his marriage.
it's possible that he hired somebody to abduct Cate and Julie got caught in the crossfire.
well, I confirmed his story.
he had a one-night stand with a cocktail waitress.
and based on what we have,
I'm not convinced that either of these guys had anything to do with it.
I'm just playing the odds.
nine times out of ten, it's the husband.
what's going on?
we found your wife, Mr. Fisher.
she's been shot, but she-she's alive.
what?
we located her in Bear Mountain State Park.
she's been airlifted to, uh, Mercy Hospital.
and they're, uh, conducting surgery right now.
I can have Agent Jama take you to see her if you want.
Yes. Thank you.
Cate? What about Cate?
no news on her yet.
go, man, go.
go be with Julie.
the fact that he shot her...
what does that mean for Cate?
I'm not sure, but I would say that it would make her the main target.
that doesn't make any sense.
I know.
are you sure that there's no one in your lif that would want to harm your wife?
no, no. I mean, I would have said so if there was, earlier.
Mr. Connelly if there is anything you're holding back, if there is anything that you haven't told me, now is the time.
no.
well, there is something, but I'm-I'm sure it's not related.
everything is related, Mr. Connelly.
last Saturday, we were at a cocktail party at the Waldamont Hotel.
God, I feel old.
sweetheart, you're not old.
you look gorgeous.
Hey, Scott...
of course.
I took care of that on Friday.
Yes, but we have a court date next week.
we can subpoena the medical records then.
excuse me?
I - I know you.
I don't think so.
christie, right?
I'm afraid not.
excuse me.
I know I'm right.
I know it's you, Christie. Come on.
look!
don't touch me.
sorry, I thought you would remember.
is everything okay?
just making conversation.
well, she's not interested.
get lost.
see you around, Christie.
who was that?
I have no idea.
she said he must've mixed her up with somebody else.
and you believed her?
Yes, I did.
but now...
well, I've been keeping things from her.
maybe she's been keeping things from me, too.
you know, Cate's phone records came in.
there's no sign here that she led a secret life.
well, maybe she just looked like this woman Christie and we're chasing down a dead-end lead.
no ID on the man that hassled her?
no. There were over 300 RSVPs.
they're sending a guest list over.
where are we on this guy?
Danny contacted the phone company.
he is not a repairman over there.
that's all we know so far.
good news-- the results on the rape kit that the hospital did on Julie came back negative.
Yeah. That could rule out a sexual motive.
Yeah, it also puts us right back to square one as to why these girls were taken.
I'll be back in a little bit, okay?
Mrs. Fisher, I'm Special Agent Johnson.
are you up for answering a few questions?
now, do you know who did this to you?
uh, I don't know. I had never seen him before.
did Cate know him?
I don't think so.
did you find her?
not yet.
now, what do you rember about the break-in?
I heard the garage door closing and then...
it all happened so fast.
he's here, he's here, he's here!
please help us!
please don't hurt us.
do you want to die?
no, no, no!
then help me move her now.
go. Come on, let's go.
I helped him get Cate into the van.
he told me to get in, and then he tied our hands.
how badly hurt was Cate?
she came to a few minutes later.
we just sat in the back of the van, not knowing where he was going to take us or what he was going to do.
did he say anything to you?
not really.
Cate tried to offer him money and her diamond earrings.
he just told us to shut up.
did he make any stops?
not for a long time.
and then when he did...
I've never been so scared.
what's going on? What's he doing?
if we do what he says, we'll be okay.
what-what if he wants to... -- Just stay calm.
we'll be all right.
we're going to get through this.
get out.
Why?
I'm cutting you loose.
please let us both go.
we won't-We won't tell anyone. We won't go to the police.
I only need her. Get out.
you need to go.
I'll be okay.
get out.
I'm sorry.
walk away.
walk away before I change my mind.
go.
I laid there and played dead.
I...I thought he was going to shoot me again.
and then...
I heard him drive off.
with Cate.
now, do you think you could describe him to our sketch artist?
I'll never forget him.
okay, all right. Thanks.
state Police just found the van in a mall parking lot.
where?
white Plains. ERT's checking for prints.
who are these guys?
besides ugly.
well, these guys are affiliated with the mob.
they're out of Sicily.
they're into drugs, racketeering...
see this tattoo here?
that tattoo was seen by Julie Fisher, and we believe it's pretty much their trademark.
Uh-oh, here we go.
meet Mario Castro.
I think this guy is their enforcer.
so, we released Mario Castro's photo to the media with a hotline number.
maybe we'll get some action.
organized Crime doesn't have a 20 on him?
uh, all they can give us is a list of his known associates.
ERT searched the Connelly house.
no drugs.
nothing that connects them to illegal activity.
well, did Richard Connelly have any mob clients?
his law firm says no, but what else are they going to say?
all right, look, Castro did not kidnap this woman just for the hell of it, right?
so there's a missing piece here somewhere.
you know, there was a...
there was a charge on Cate's credit card at a bar in Newark yesterday.
let's see.
Yeah, here. In the Forest Hill area.
there's a lot of made guys in that area, right?
you know, maybe Cate's the one with the mob connection.
Yeah, I saw her last night.
her and her friend.
is this the friend?
no, she was, uh, with another woman.
her?
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
LikeDesperate Housewifetwins.
did they talk to anyone?
uh, no. Just each other.
they were just having a night out.
it seemed like they could use it.
all right, ladies.
another one.
Oh, no.
this one's on the house.
come on, Jules.
on the house.
one more.
Oh, I... Oh, I can't. I'm done.
Yes.
how did we end up here?
because Richard stepped out on me.
I mean, this bar.
I'm returning to my roots.
this used to be strip club way back when.
I worked here.
you're kidding.
you wouldn't get it.
you and Adam with your beautiful kid and your perfect life.
Yeah, and our credit card debt and our two mortgages.
Why?
I wanted to go to college, so I danced my way to a degree.
sometimes I did more than dance.
I bet I wrecked a few marriages along the way.
I got what I deserve.
no, you didn't.
Cate, it's not over.
maybe I was trying so hard not to be who I used to be that I just wasn't there at all.
I've seen the way Richard looks at you.
he loves you.
I love him.
I'm just not sure that's enough.
sometimes people make stupid mistakes.
but they deserve a second chance.
they paid their bill and took off.
did you see anyone follow them out?
no, Ma'am.
but it was a busy night. I guess it's possible.
Thanks.
I spoke to the owner of the strip club.
Cate's stage name was Christie, but he hasn't seen or heard from her in 15 years.
Oh, so that's how the guy at the party knew her.
check this out.
mario Castro was spotted at a fast-food joint about an hour ago.
was Cate with him?
well, we're about to see for sure.
I'm downloading the surveillance video right now.
all right, here we go.
she looks unharmed. -- Yeah.
what is that, an SUV?
I can't make out what they're saying.
God, I wish I could read lips.
Maya can lip-read.
Yeah.
okay, one more time.
he just ordered some kind of burger and fries.
she's telling him she doesn't understand.
why me? Why are you doing this?
the man's saying...
your husband stole our...
our what?
can you play that last part again?
your husband stole our money.
all right.
thank you.
how much do you owe them, Mr. Connelly?
owe who?
the mob.
they took your wife because you stole their money.
now, I want the whole story.
I don't know what you're talking about.
no, please. I don't understand. I...
who said I took money from the mob?
he did.
is Cate okay?
well, she was then.
but with every second her life is more at risk.
you know, you really need to be straight with me.
I swear to you, I don't know what you're talking about.
well, he is saying to your wife,"Your husband stole our money.
now, why would he say that?
he must have made a mistake.
look, somebody has made a mistake.
well, he shot Julie Fisher in the back and left her for dead.
is that what you want for Cate?
no, of course not.
then give me something.
I don't have anything.
I didn't steal anything.
I don't know why this guy said what he said.
I don't even know the guy.
she getting anything out of him?
enough for me to cut my odds in half.
he doesn't know anything about it.
all right. Well, maybe this guy can shed some light.
one of Castro's known associates, Charlie Moretti.
looks like our phone guy.
word on the street is he's a freelance hit man.
let's bring him in.
Yep.
so, how can I help the FBI today?
well, we'd like to ask you some questions about your close personal friend Mario Castro.
sorry, I'm drawing a blank.
Oh, well, let me refresh your memory.
he kidnapped two women this morning.
you were an accessory.
no, you're mistaken, gorgeous.
I'm in the import/export business.
Yeah. We know you're connected.
connected?
to what?
come on, smart-ass.
we already have you as an accessory to kidnapping and more than likely as an accessory to murder.
based on what?
based on the fact that we have an eyewitness that places you at Julie Fisher's house prior to the kidnappings.
and you think that's gonna hold up in court,'cause I was in her neighborhood?
you guys are reaching.
you want to play it that way?
Really?
okay, you can go.
I can go.
Yeah, get out of here.
what's going on here?
the minute you walk out of here,
I'm going to let it be known on the street that you were in here talking to us about the family, their operation.
the way they work.
I don't like your chances on the street after that.
what do you want?
information.
about what?
the kidnappings!
if I answer questions about that and only that, will my answers stay within these walls and will I get immunity in case anything else happens to come up?
we'll talk about immunity depending on what you tell us.
I turned down that job.
all right. You want immunity?
you're going to have to do better than that.
I'm telling the truth.
I turned the job down.
I did some recon and I realized it wasn't my type of gig.
Oh, what's the matter?
no dental plan?
I've have a code.
I don't do anyone with a wife and kids.
the Connellys don't have kids.
who the hell are the Connellys?
well, who was your target?
the husband, Adam Fisher.
where is your husband, Mrs. Fisher?
he's not home and he's not answering his cell.
I - I don't know.
don't lie to me.
he was here earlier.
where was he headed?
I don't know.
you don't know.
well, I'll tell you what I know.
your husband took money from the wrong people.
they sent Mario Castro after him.
castro grabbed you.
but what I need to know is why he shot you and kept Cate.
look, you need to tell me what really happened!
he came to the house.
Adam wasn't home, so he took the two of us.
which one of you is Mrs. Fisher?
I am.
good.
what are you doing?
he'll keep me and he'll let you go.
this is our best bet.
I can handle guys like this. You can't.
I won't let you do this.
listen to me.
Gavin needs you.
get out.
you need to go.
I'll be okay.
get out.
I'm sorry.
walk away before I change my mind.
go. Go!
she did it because of my son...and I let her.
and it's my fault she's still with that animal.
why didn't you tell me this before?
Adam begged me not to.
right.
so, your best friend risks her life for you and you're going to let her die to protect your husband?
who did he take the money from?
he wouldn't tell me.
and I tried to get the truth out of him.
I don't know what I would have done if I had lost you.
what is going on, Adam?
what do you mean?
that man wanted me.
why did he want me? I didn't do anything.
did you do something?
I - I did an inspection on an apartment building last month.
just...just checking it out before we issued the policy and...
I found a bag hidden in an air vent.
a bag?
what was in the bag?
there was $100, 000.
the place was empty.
it was going to be torn down eventually.
I figured somebody just...
I don't know, left the money there, forgot about it.
I didn't think anyone would find out.
why would you do this?
we're barely keeping up on the house.
and my bonus this year was a joke.
our cards are maxed, all right?
I feel like I'm drowning.
I just needed some relief.
look, I just...
it didn't seem like stealing.
I see what Richard does for Cate, and I just...
I want you and Gavin to have those things.
I don't need things, Adam.
all I need is my family.
we have to go to the police.
we can't. They left a message on my voice mail at work.
they're going to kill Cate if I don't give the money back.
baby, I will fix this.
all right, I will fix this.
I will get her back, I swear to you.
but you have got to promise me...
you can't say anything.
where was he going?
I don't know, I swear.
please, you have to find him.
both of them.
any clues as to where Adam Fisher hit the jackpot?
well, we checked his schedule from a month ago and the only empty building he inspected was at Jerome and 92nd.
that's South Bronx.
who owns it?
Ah, interesting.
okay, Organized Crime confirmed that he runs a mob family out of New Jersey.
here's the thing. I've been reading through all this stuff, Jack, and Joseph doesn't seem like the kind of guy who is going to let Adam just return that money.
no way.
well, I would assume the drop would have to happen in a secure location.
um, what other properties does this Savino own?
he's got about 20 of them, all over the city.
apartment buildings, a movie theater, a warehouse...
okay, okay, okay.
let's call NYPD.
let's get them involved.
let's hit them all at once.
what's up?
Yeah, I got Fisher's car at the Mayan Theater.
man, I'm at least 30 minutes out.
why don't you hang tight and I'll call for backup.
all right. I'm at the north entrance.
shots fired! I'm going in.
Hey, Danny, hang on.
that was a warning. I'll put the next one in your head.
don't make a move.
whatever you say.
throw it over.
throw it.
open it. Open it!
it's all there, okay?
I swear to you.
please, can we just go?
this ain't about the money.
it's about the fact that you took it.
no, no, no, no!
look, she's got nothing to do with this.
please just-just let her go.
maybe we can all just kiss and make up. Right?
thank you.
you're welcome.
do you think the DA is going to charge Adam?
with what?
grand theft of mob money or, uh, first degree stupidity?
you were right.
that it was the husband.
and you were right that it wasn't the husband.
they made an offer.
well, I guess you're gonna take that job.
well, I'd have to consider it, wouldn't I?
I like this.
I talked to that Wall Street guy.
And?
didn't think it would happen like this I turned him down.
just thought I'd stick around opened up.
well, I-I think that's smart.
you know, you have a lot of potential.
I think I'll take that as a compliment
have you seen my keys?
you know you don't have to go.
please listen to me.
you weren't invited.
it's not a good idea.
I have to go. - Rob...
it'll be okay.
I promise.
I'll be back in a few.
call me when you leave?
I will.
Kyle leaving so early fills our hearts with sadness, and perhaps even anger.
we may want to seek vengeance, but that is not what Kyle would want, and that is not why are here today.
we come together to honor the dead, and to find love and support in the living.
we are here to remember Kyle for the man he was and how he touched each and every one of us.
let's all bow our heads.
let us pray.
our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come.
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven...
the services lasted till 10: 00 a. m.
after, we held the reception in the Friendship Hall.
so, no one on your staff reported any problems?
no. Here'e guestbook.
okay.
now, did you, uh, see this man at the service?
uh, he looks familiar, but I don't know.
I'm not sure.
okay, I'm gonna need to speak with everyone on your staff to see if they saw him.
Absolutely.
we don't want any problems.
thank you.
any luck?
no. Actually, I don't think there's much luck around here.
that's not funny.
all right, anyway, I got some information on our missing person.
Simms is the COO of a company that charters private jets.
he was attending a funeral for one of his mechanics that died in a fire.
what happened?
apparently, he was doing some routine maintenance on one of the company's jets when a fire broke out, and some of the employees think that Rob's to blame.
as a matter of fact, Rob got into a shouting match with one of them-- a guy named Dale Kinecki.
Yeah, he's right here.
he was at the funeral.
how many people signed that guestbook?
Uh...say about 40?
maybe Kinecki got a little help from his friends.
I shouldn't have let him go to the funeral.
did you have any reason to think there would be some trouble?
it was just a very emotional situation, and I thought it would be better if he stayed home.
you know, a staff member at the mausoleum saw Dale Kinecki following Rob away from the funeral service.
do you have any idea if Rob had a problem with him?
problem? No.
Rob...Rob hired Dale.
they've worked together for seven years.
well, he blames your fianc for the death
that accident wasn't Rob's fault.
if the CEO orders cutbacks, it's Rob's job to implement them.
that's all.
whose fault did Rob think it was?
that's what I tried to get him to tell me.
you... really know how to seduce a girl.
those 1, 445 guys think they can hide their malt beverages from me?
nobody hides nothing from Mr. Rob Bob Simms.
did something happen with the lawyers today?
Nope.
the way they see it, it's not the company's fault.
and that is what they want me to say to the NTSB.
did they ask you to lie?
rob, I'm being serious.
if they asked you to do something that you don't want to do...
no.
they just don't want the whole truth.
Spence, the lawyers, everybody just wants me to say it's just another...
unfortunate workplace accident.
and it can't be that for you?
not this time.
I brought him home to sleep it off, and the next day, he woke up and said it was just an aberration, and that he'd start going back to meetings.
what kind of substance abuse problem are we talking about here?
he had a drug problem as a teenager, but he's been sober for 12 years.
what did he mean when he said, not this time?
had there been a similar incident at the company before?
I asked him what he meant, but he wouldn't answer me.
the next morning, he went to the NTSB hearing.
what did he tell them?
I don't know. You'll have to ask his boss.
that's the Spence he mentioned?
Yeah. Spence Liccardi.
he was there at the deposition.
okay.
thank you.
let me call you a little bit later, and we can deal with it then.
okay.
if Rob was feeling guilty, and went on a bender, I can't find any proof of it in his financial records.
you know, it would be so much easier for us to solve cases if drug dealers would just accept credit cards.
Yes.
I'm gonna check around.
I'm gonna see if anyone saw anything that made them think he was falng off the wagon.
uh, Samantha, uh...
are you, uh...Are you doing anything tonight?
I thought that I would, um, you know, pick up some Chinese and come over and...
I told you my mom was in town all week to see the baby, right?
Yes, you did.
I've just been in denial about it.
rain check?
Absolutely.
Hey.
did you get the video of the NTSB hearing yet?
it's downloading.
okay, well, maybe these employees are right about Simms's culpability for this fire.
Yeah. He could be covering up for someone.
either way, he's not dealing with the guilt very well.
here we go.
we will now convene the NTSB hearing with regard to Mr. Robert Simms.
and, Mr. Simms, where were you on the date of the incident?
in my office.
when I heard the alarm, I ran to the hangar, but it was too late.
I'm referring to my notes.
it says here that the company believes the chief mechanic was responsible for the fire.
that would be the mechanic who perished in the fire?
Yes.
and why do you believe he was at fault?
what I said is what's in the report.
I'm aware of your statement, Mr. Simms.
I'd like to hear it in your own words.
do you believe your chief mechanic was at fault?
no.
I'd like to ask for a recess.
let's talk.
whose fault do you believe it was?
mine.
it was my fault.
Mr. Simms!
I have to go.
rob, get back here!
you know, it hears you were quite upset that day, Mr. Liccardi.
rob was very erratic that day.
honestly, I was caught off-guard by what he said.
Why? Because he told the truth?
the accident happened because an undetected electrical fire triggered the ignition fuel.
it was not Rob's fault.
but his claims would expose you to lawsuits from the family of the deceased.
correct?
Yes, they would.
well, in that case, that gives you motive to keep him quiet.
I didn't do anything to Rob.
Yeah, but you ordered the cutbacks that he believed caused the fire.
is that correct?
the cutbacks had nothing to do with it.
well, not according to Dale Kinecki.
he blamed Rob for the fire.
and the last call he made on his cell was to you.
now, look, Mr. Liccardi, you may or may not have anything to do with Rob's disappearance, but one thing I know for sure: your company is in trouble.
and the last thing you want in your life right now is the FBI.
I may be able to help you in one aspect.
this where you'll find Dale Kinecki.
he's working at the Trenton-Mercer Airport.
I sent him there a couple days ago to calm his ass down.
you sure it wasn't to hide him?
well, I'd look pretty stupid giving him up to you now, wouldn't I?
you said it.
okay, where is Rob Simms?
I don't know.
why didn't you say that to the cops that found you?
they had bad manners.
you know, you can go straight to the holding cell if you want to.
you want to do that?
because if you're actually innocent, I think it's a better idea if you talk to me.
last I saw Rob, I just wanted to let him know I wasn't about to forget what happened.
Hey!
you got a lot of sack showing up here.
I just...I just wanted to pay my respects.
well, it's a little late for that.
maybe if you hadn't worked Kyle like a dog, he'd still be here.
look, I want to make up for it.
how?
you gonna bring him back?
I will see to it that his family is taken care of.
but I need something from you
from me? Really?
you'll get money for it.
ten grand.
and what exactly do you want for ten grand?
you're working for Trans Charter, right?
Yeah.
I need you to get me on a plane to L. A.but I don't want my name on the manifest.
ten grand?
that's right.
I'll see what I can do.
I don't suppose he told you why he didn't want his name on the manifest?
no.
and for ten grand, I wasn't asking a lot of questions.
special Agent Taylor.
Hey, I just got off the phone with Trans Charter Air.
they confirmed that a passenger matching Rob's description flew to L. A. yesterday.
you know, the company has their planes built in Long Beach, California.
maybe Rob knew his company was at fault, so he was looking for evidence without his CEO tripping to it.
or he's the one who's at fault, and he just wanted to get out of Dodge before he got arrested.
Hey. Did you get anything off the ping?
when we focused the phone tracking on the West Coast, we got a hit on his cell phone in South L.
LAPD recognized the location as a known crack house.
I've got a satellite link with LAPD.
we're going live now.
smile, Rob.
you're on Candid Camera.
you summoned?
Yes, I did.
um... How long is your mother staying in town?
a week, I've told you that, like, six times, Jack.
you comfortable with her looking after the baby?
uh, well, I hadn't really ever...why?
well, uh, I'm going to get to that.
um, Tech has been looking througRob Simms' computer, and they checked the browser and the history.
and it seems that he has been conducting an extensive search for a guy named Roger Davis.
okay.
well, Roger Davis was with the LAPD, then he retired to Jersey.
what does this have to do with my mother and Finn?
LAPD.
all roads lead back to La-La Land.
okay, so you're asking me to go to Los Angeles.
I'm asking us to go to Los Angeles.
do you have any idea how that would look, Jack?
like two colleagues investigating a case.
two colleagues?
I could invite some others if you want.
no, you and me is fine.
the most boring car the US government can provide.
a convertible's no good for you.
you'll get sunburn.
