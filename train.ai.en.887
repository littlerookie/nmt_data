ha, what do you think? - It's beautiful!
when did you ever find the time to come... - Well, last week, when you were...
anyway, slipped in at nights and worked on it. It ought to sell pies, though.
and get a free dinner. - Oh, never mind that.
a free dinner and second helpings.
Pancho, if you'll unload the car with Letty,
Arline and I can get started in the kitchen.
Wally, thank you... - Oh, go get cooking.
the way half chickens are served in most places, in one loathsome piece, I just hate.
how are people supposed to eat it that way?
well, we're going to serve it in pieces.
breast, wing, second joints, and drumstick.
all arranged in the icebox, so we can pick up a single portion with one motion.
truth is... I'm not expecting many people since it's my first night, and I haven't had a chance yet to build up my trade.
but, if you should be rushed, get their orders.
I've got to know whether I'm having vegetables or waffle before I can start, - so don't keep me waiting. - Call them both?
call the waffle, only. - Call biscuits?
no. I'll keep biscuits out all the time, just pick them up yourself.
pick up your own bread and your own biscuits.
bread on a plate, biscuits in a basket.
and remember, biscuits call for a napkin, to keep them hot.
three biscuits per person, more if they want them.
and, remember, you're responsible for desserts, too.
I know, desserts and starters. - Desserts and starters.
that's right. Desserts and starters.
Mildred's
so remember, dip the soup yourself.
and, um, starters, everyone gets a starter.
Oh, Pancho, do we have any extra napkins?
I don't think so. - You don't, at all?
people. - How many?
four.
four at number nine, soups all around, two and two, one waf.
fine. But don't call soup, just dip it up yourself.
Oh, right.
put this on.
good evening. - Hello.
thank you so much for coming tonight.
my name is Mildred and this is not only our very first night, but you are our very first guests.
so, I do hope you end up liking our little place, and keep on being our guests.
thank you, I'm sure we will.
why, how do you do? - Hi.
Mr. Sawyer, Mrs. Sawyer! Please.
this is so nice. Thank you.
delicious chicken!
thank you.
and don't forget, there are homemade pies, as well you might like taking home with you.
Oh, I think we should.
two at number three, but one of them's a kid that won't have soup.
so, she wants tomato juice with a piece of lemon and some celery salt.
I told her, we don't serve it, but she says it's what she always has.
so, what do I do now?
there's mother.
by God, Mildred, this is really something.
you got yourself a piece of property this time.
I mean, this place is real.
Bert. - Say there, Wally.
Veda. - I was just about to give these two a tour.
Mildred, I'm telling you. You're gonna have a mob in here.
that's the thing about direct-mail advertising.
it's not what you send. It's who you send it to.
I hit up every name on that old Pierce Homes list, and I just ran into six different people. They said they're coming here!
by the way, you did attend to that transfer of beneficiary? On the fire insurance?
Nah, I thought I'd wait until the joint burned down.
okay. Just asking.
I'm telling you. Mob.
well, Mother. I think you've done very well, considering everything.
well, thank you, Veda.
I was hoping, it was something you'd be proud of.
Oh, there's Ida. Will you all excuse me?
Mildred! Look at you.
my husband wanted to come, but he got a call on a job and had to run. So, I'm solo.
Oh, Mildred, it's just grand.
and, the space you got.
you could get two more fours in easy, just by shifting these twos.
and using trays. You got no idea how much that helps.
it'll save you at least one girl. At least.
I should get back to the kitchen. But, I'll come visit.
Ah, you go. Go on.
two fours just come in, Mrs. Pierce.
I got room for one, but what do I do with the other?
I can shove two two's together, but not till I get Miss Ida moved out.
no, no! Let her alone. - Well, then, what'll I do?
seat four, ask the others to wait.
Oh, let me do it.
excuse me.
Letty! Wrong door. - I know, I know.
thank you so much for coming. I have one table available now, but if you wouldn't mind waiting, it should just be a couple of moments for another.
all right, then.
I'm sorry, there aren't any chairs.
someone will be with you in a moment.
why, in the world, are you washing more plates?
he's washing plates, Mrs. Pierce, when it's soup bowls I need!
because, we're all out, and I can't serve any starters without 'em!
soup bowls, stupid, soup bowls!
Arline, please, I need you clearing tables. It's backing up out there.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Pierce.
just clean it up, then help Arline outside.
Oh! Damn! Shoot!
Oh, damn!
please, everyone. Nothing's going out! We need to start moving!
Pancho, if you could...
okay, Mildred, it's them dishes that's causing it.
now, she ain't no good out there, none whatever.
so, let her wipe while he washes, and that'll help.
just give us a second, we'll get this train right back on track.
okay, call your starters...
call your starters. - I want a right and left for two, three, and four.
chicken and tomato for one, and they've been waiting for several minutes.
so, we better... - Nah, that's fine.
let's get a move on.
Hello? Anything I can do?
Lucy! No, dear.
everything's under... - Sure, there is. Follow me.
eighty-five cents! Everything's 85 cents!
here's your waffles.
it's just terrific. - Oh, thank you.
I tell you, I haven't had waffles like that since I was a kid.
I love 'em like that. - I'm so pleased.
Mildred? - Yes.
it's Sally Crough. - Oh! Of course.
Mildred, I... I was so very sorry to hear about the little one.
thank you.
thank you, Mrs. Crough.
I got a four on six, chicken and tomato, two wafs. And nine won't budge.
mother! Mother!
guess who's coming in to your restaurant right this very instant!
you'll never, ever guess! - Well, who?
and who is Monty Beragon?
mother, don't you know? - I guess not.
he plays polo for Midwick, and he lives in Pasadena, and he's rich, and good looking, and all the girls just wait for his picture to come out in the paper.
he's the keenest!
say! Did she just tell you who came walking in to this place?
I've never seen her so sassed up.
Oh, I'm telling you, Mildred, if that guy's here, you are in!
there isn't a restaurant in town that wouldn't pay to have that guy to eat there.
am I right? - He's very well known.
known? Hell, he's a shot!
I just wonder how he got wind of us. He wasn't on anybody's list.
and I doubt that he reads those Glendale rags.
evidently, Mildred's reputation as a cook has spread far and wide.
which seems sufficient reason, in my book, without doing any fancy sleuthing about it.
Yeah, well, I got a notion to find out. I think...
why didn't you tell me about the little girl?
I don't know. I couldn't call anybody.
I didn't hear about it until her sister told me, just now.
she seems to be quite an admirer of yours.
well, she's an absolute delight. But I want you to know, if I'd had any idea about it, you'd have heard from me.
I doubt you're in the humor for gags.
Oh, Monty, they're lovely.
thank you.
I'd like you to meet Bert Pierce, of Pierce Homes, - Pleasure.
and my business advisor, Wally Burgan. - How do you do?
Monty Beragon. - Oh. Excuse me.
that's it! Everybody out!
we got two orders up and three waiting, and we're down on biscuits. Now shoo!
all right, let's go.
after you. - After you.
try the chicken yet?
thank you so much. - Well, see you then.
good night. - Good night!
we made 46 dollars and 37 cents!
forty-seven dollars?
that's 10 more than I ever dreamed of making.
we went through 24 chickens...
I only planned on 20!
to the best little woman that any guy was crazy enough to let get away from him.
to Mildred. You ought to know, you cluck.
Yeah, cut the mush!
Ah, Mildred, I wish you could have heard the comments.
you got no idea how they went for that chicken.
it's gonna do just grand.
you're quite a little wizard. I had... I had no idea.
thank you. And I had no idea how late it was.
Bert, I've gotta take Ida back since she stayed so late.
could you, uh, could you get her home? - Sure.
she's got school in the morning.
do I have to, Mother? - Yes, you do.
good night, everyone. - Good night, Mildred.
thank you! - Good night.
Oh, Ida... - Thank you, Lucy.
so, you must tell me, is there...is there a special young man in your life?
no, I'm much too young for that.
too young for that? Well, what are you talking about?
see, I would imagine that there would be 100 young men all lined up around the corner, eagerly waiting to steal a kiss from you.
Ah, well, if you ask me, I think it's perfectly juvenile the way most of them behave...
what on earth?
it's all my doing. We had a date.
Oh, you did?
Yes, yes. We had a date that I was to take her home.
so, I did. But we had to take pop home first.
or at least, to the...
mother! We saw...
we saw Biederhof through the window!
and they flopped!
it's true.
I'm sorry.
all right. All right, young lady.
the time has come.
good night, Monty. - Ah, good night, my darling.
sleep well. Sweet dreams.
Oh, Mother, isn't he wonderful?
he's terribly nice, yes.
he said I looked so much like you. He knew exactly who I was.
so you told him about me? - Of course!
you appear to have made quite an impression on her.
I've been looking at that damn costume all night, and with great difficulty, restrained myself from biting it. Now, get it off.
I'm not much in the humor... - Get it off.
and the second theory, and I suppose this second theory goes back to the days of Noah...
don't you snicker at me. - I'm not. I'm not.
I'm voting for him, because somebody's got to put an end to all this Hoover extravagance...
of course. - And balance this budget.
and all those people, demanding help.
you can't tell me, people couldn't get along, even if there is a depression, - if only they had a little gump. - Yes, Ma'am.
you're not even listening to me.
of course, I am. I, I find your political views fascinating.
but we were discussing something else entirely.
Oh, we were, were we?
look, all I know is what I hear from the kid.
that'll be $1. 72.
she takes lessons every week. - Yeah.
from some cheap little ivory thumper over in Glendale.
here. - Certainly not.
Oh, Monty, please. You've been too generous.
just this once.
and what do we mean when we talk about the reduction of poverty?
we mean, I think, the reduction of the causes of poverty.
look, it's not up to me to give you advice. It's really none of my affair.
Monty, please! You spend more time with her than anyone these days.
she absolutely adores you.
well, then why not put her with somebody who can really take charge of her?
like who, for instance?
well, listen.
if you're serious, there's a fellow in Pasadena, I think could do wonders. Charlie Hannen.
he was quite well known up to a few years ago in the concert field, and then his lungs cracked up and he came out here.
what?
nothing.
you're swell, that's all.
Yeah, you bet, I'm swell.
see what you make me do?
so how do we get in touch with this...
he's organist, or choirmaster, whatever you call it, at our church.
but I know he takes in a few pupils.
I'm sure I can get him interested in her.
and in his hands, she'd be getting somewhere.
I always want to play it that way.
I'll tell Rachmaninoff when I see him next.
and you've never studied harmony?
just a little. - Just a little, what?
I beg your pardon?
I might warn you, Veda, with young pupils,
I mix quite a bit of general instruction in with the musical.
now, if you don't want a clip on the ear, you'll call me "Sir."
Yes, Sir.
now, play the bit in the Rachmaninoff again, the way you said you always wanted to play it.
if you did play it like that you'd be in a little trouble, wouldn't you?
still, it could have been written that way.
I really think Rachmaninoff's way is better.
I mean, I find a touch of banality in yours, don't you?
what's banality... Sir?
I mean it sounds, well, corny. Cheap.
play it an octave higher, add a few trills, and it's...
listen To The Mocking Bird before you knew it.
Yes, I see. - But it makes musical sense.
I have plenty of pupils with talent in their fingers, very few with anything in their heads.
your fingers, Veda...
well, your technique is god-awful.
at the very least, we'll get some of that conceit drilled out of you.
but your head is something else.
and your sight reading is remarkable.
that's the sure sign of a musician, I'd like her over here twice a week, for one lesson in piano and another lesson in the theory of music.
I suppose, nothing will come out of it, if we're really honest.
many are called, in this business, few are chosen.
and, God, Veda! Your playing stinks!
I ought to charge $100, just to have to listen to it!
Oh, let her bawl. - Veda!
it's nothing compared to what she'll be doing when I get through with her.
Veda. - Oh, Mother!
Oh, Darling, what is it?
I was so afraid...
he wouldn't take me...
and then...and then he wanted me!
he said, I had something in my head.
mother, in my head!
Oh, Bert, I wish you could have been there.
just to see her face, and what it meant to her.
you always said Veda was artistic, Mildred.
I just always thought it ran in families, that kind of thing.
well, it has to start somewhere.
well, you were right, God damn it!
who cares if she can tinkle the keys or not?
is that what made Irving Berlin a millionaire? - Irving Berlin?
I thought she was going to be a classical musician.
a virtuoso.
more coffee? - Thanks, doll.
I'm fine.
can I ask a favor? - Anything.
I want to borrow the piano at mom's.
borrow it? - You know, they'd only be too glad to...- No. No. No.
I don't want it as a gift.
it would just be for a little while.
see, I want to get Veda a piano, myself.
but the kind of piano she ought to have, I mean, a real grand, costs eleven hundred dollars.
they'll give me terms, but I shouldn't be taking on any more debt, not just now.
so, what I'd like to do, is open a special account down at the bank.
if I keep putting in, I know by next Christmas, I can manage it.
sure thing, Mildred.
thanks Bert.
and don't breathe a word.
this is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly.
nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today.
this great nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.
so, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.
practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.
they have no vision - Mother!
and when there is no vision, the people perish.
Yes, the money changers have fled - Really?
from their high seats in the temple of our civilization.
we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths.
let me make it clear to you, that the banks will take care of all needs, except, of course, the hysterical demands of hoarders, and it is my belief, that hoarding, during the past week has become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime, in every part of our nation.
it needs no prophet to tell you that when the people find that they can get their money...
so, you got any plans for Repeal?
repeal? You mean of Prohibition? - Yeah, just that.
why, I don't see how it affects me.
you kiddin' me? It affects you plenty.
you may not have heard, but folks out there are getting crazy for a drink.
a decent drink out in the open without a secret password, or some yegg with his face in a slot.
you think your trade's gonna stick by you because they like your chicken and they want to help a plucky little woman get along?
ha, like hell, they will.
when they find out you're staying dry, they'll tag you for a back number, and go where they can get what they want.
what, you think, I should sell liquor?
it'll be legal, won't it?
I wouldn't even consider such a thing.
why not?
do you think I run a saloon?
Mildred, it's not going to be like it was in the old days.
it's going to be respectable.
it's going to put the restaurant industry back on its feet.
but I don't know the first thing about liquor.
well, I do.
you might say, Ike has a vested interest in the industry.
so, listen to this.
you put in the booze, and I'll run it for ya , for a straight 10% of what I take in, plus tips.
you? A bartender? - Why not?
I'd make a damned good one.
and how much would all this cost me, in your expert opinion?
five hundred, tops...
for bar, construction, furniture, plus the liquor.
five hundred dollars?
Oh, Lucy, I don't know.
this place is going gangbusters.
it's packed every night.
it's just not that simple. I've got loans.
There's...Veda's piano to think about.
I've still barely made a dent.
and then, there's...there's Monty.
Monty? He's flush!
he looks it enough.
the truth is, his business went bust.
just last month. - What?
the growers...the farmers that raise the fruit, they all signed up with the Exchange.
that's it.
every dime he had, was in that fruit company.
he's had to put his house on the market.
I had no idea.
and you're... - I'm helping out.
it's only temporary. He'll land on his feet.
I'll be...
so I've really gotta do this?
it's what I'd do.
that's Robert Mackey over there.
I tell you, if that church mouse is in here, Prohibition really has ended.
your Frankie was right.
I don't want to talk about it.
what is it, 80% profit per drink?
happy customers? I don't see the question.
Wally says, I don't have a choice.
is that your third drink?
I don't know. Who's counting?
Why? - Well, now I...
you didn't say anything to Veda, did you, about the piano? - No.
I can't stand the thought of disappointing her.
not a word.
truly? - Scout's Honor.
let's get out of here.
could you just run her by after practice tomorrow?
she knows exactly what she needs. I won't have time before Sunday.
she doesn't need a new dress to see my mother.
it's not just for that.
then, where?
quick sup at the Pie Wagon, or home, sweet home?
not the Pie Wagon.
why do you have to call it that?
Yes, take her to dinner.
I'll meet you after the rush.
for dinner, and gasoline.
your paid gigolo thanks you.
I don't think that's very nice.
well, it's true, isn't it?
is that the only reason you come here?
what?
not, not at all.
come what may, swing high, swing low, you're still the best piece of tail I ever had, or could imagine.
Monty, suppose you go home.
what? What's the matter with you?
I think you know.
by all that's holy, I don't know.
I told you to go.
baby, let's be straight here.
the time to worry is when those kinds of feelings go bust, not when they're going strong.
I was just paying you a compliment.
what you didn't like was how. - If you told me that, and intended it as a compliment, then it might have been one, I don't know.
but when you tell me that, and it's the only thing you have to tell me, then it's not a compliment.
it's the worst thing anyone could say.
I get it.
you want the "I love you" scene.
I want you to go.
we're talking about words.
I'm not a poet. I...
I say something my own way, and, wham, you go moral on me.
it's a pure question of communication, and...
that's a lie! - If you don't...
all I've ever been to you is a piece of tail.
you're ashamed of me!
it's no surprise. I've known it all along!
why don't you just admit it, Monty?
you look down on me because I work!
you're mad. - No!
you look down on me because I...
cook food and sell it.
you look down on everybody that works. But I got news for you.
you're the one that's gonna have to start working!
of course, I'm gonna work!
when?
as soon as I get the damn house sold, and that whole mess straightened out.
Oh, Monty...you make me laugh!
there's nothing about that house that can't be put in the hands of an agent.
you'd just rather keep that address on Orange Grove Avenue, where you can cook your own eggs in the morning, drive over to the club in the afternoon, and eat your dinner here with Veda, and take your spending money from me.
then go out and find a job. Who wouldn't?
sure, I don't know anybody I'd rather take money from then you.
your paid gigolo is damn well satisfied.
sugar and champagne, what could go wrong? Right?
stop it, Hans! - Thank you, Mrs. Pierce.
why do you always have to pick on me? - Merry Christmas.
Oh, thank you Mrs. Pierce!
I'm sorry, Ma'am, I can't understand what you're saying!
just hop on down Mildred's foot stompin' hoedown...
you know, if it wasn't for the labor force in this country...
we wouldn't have a country, without working men and women!
it's no use, Mrs. Roosevelt, you might as well save your breath...
how are people supposed to enjoy themselves with all that yelling going on?
Oh, they're lovely!
that is so, so dear of father!
here.
let me help you.
Oh, I can't wait to go riding!
Oh, they're very smart.
aren't they?
and this is for you, dear.
best for last!
what could it be?
it's so small...
it's...
it's not what I was hoping to give you, but it's...
I think it'll go nicely with school clothes, as well as with more... - Thanks.
Hello? - Merry Christmas, Veda!
Oh, Father! I just opened them up, and they're wonderful!
I adore them...
like a dream! I'm wearing them right now, and I simply refuse to take them off.
I may even sleep in them!
thank you so very, very much father.
what was that all about?
somebody kindly tipped her off.
not me. - No...
not you.
so, what did you give her?
a wristwatch. - She's got nothing to complain about...
I know.
you'll get her the piano when you can.
BERT: Is she coming later, to the cemetery?
I...I don't know.
I don't...I don't know.
is that everything?
you know, you might want to make a list so - you remember who sent what... - Christ, I hate this dump.
is there anything, in particular, that you object to?
no, Mother.
and, please, don't start changing things around, just to please me.
no, nothing, in particular.
just every lousy, stinking part of it.
and if it were to burn down tomorrow, I wouldn't shed a tear.
from The Elixir of Love, - by Gaetano Donizetti, 1798-1848.- I see.
you'll put out that cigarette, and pick up that match.
like hell, I will.
glendale, California.
land Where The Orange Tree Blows, by Ambrose Thomas.
garden Spot of the World?
more like a wormhole, for grubs!
I can only guess where that came from.
you are such a sap, mother.
you actually believe he'd marry you?
Yes!
if I were willing.
ye gods and little fishes, hear my cynical laughter...
if I were willing! Stupid, don't you know what he sees in you?
about what you see, I think.
no, it's your legs.
what?
he said that? To you?
why shouldn't he?
we're very good friends, and...
I hope I have a mature point of view on such matters.
really, he speaks very nicely about your legs.
and, he has a theory about them.
he says, that a gingham apron is the greatest provocation ever invented by woman, for the torture of man.
and that the very best legs are found in kitchens, not in drawing rooms.
"never take the mistress, if you can get the maid," is how he puts it.
not that he would consider them his equals, per se.
try as he will at his slumming, his shoes are still custom-made.
they ought to be. They cost me enough.
you didn't know that, did you?
you buy his shoes?
ye gods and little fishes. - His shoes, and his shorts, and his drinks, and everything else he's needed over the last four months.
including his polo dues!
so, you needn't call on your gods and little fishes.
no, Miss Pierce, it's not my legs he likes me for, it's my money!
and so long as it's that, we'll see who's the varlet and who's the boss.
you think he hauls you all over town because he likes it?
no.
in fact, he actually complains about it.
surprising as it may seem, he'll marry me, or not marry me, so his gentlemanly belly will have something to eat.
and, lo and behold, you're in exactly the same position.
and, I say, there'll be no more money for you, not one cent, until you take back everything you've said, - and apologize for it! - I don't have to apologize for anything!
you're the one who ruins everything always!
and that's the piano that you're gonna practice on, - Stop!
until I get ready, in my own good time, to buy you another!
so his phone's down.
send him a wire, baby.
there's no good reason to go out on a night like this, none.
all things must come to an end, Lucy.
I promised myself it would be tonight, and it will be.
Oh, that's all fine and good...
I'm going!
that's all there is to it.
well, not without your trench coat and galoshes!
I had no idea you'd show up!
what do you mean? - Careful. What...
slow down.
how the hell did you get here anyway?
I thought they closed the roads!
you know, Mildred, sometimes I wonder if you have good sense.
how could I refuse such a rare invitation?
pretty gloomy, huh?
not what it used to be. It's not so bad upstairs.
Yep, the Beragon brothers' "House of Beragon" has seen better days.
is your mother still... - Still in Philadelphia?
Yes. It's just up here.
her bank stock was assessable.
and the depositors, they want their money.
until the tide turns...
anyway, here we are.
my humble abode.
why, it's quite nice, actually.
servants quarters, really, but I liked having a little fire and they seemed cozier, somehow.
well. Get a load of you.
such grandeur deserves a drink.
shouldn't we wait for the Ewings?
the who?
isn't that their name? - The...
there aren't going to be any Ewings. Or any Biltmore.
what's gotten into you?
what do you mean? It's New Year's Eve.
MONTY: Can't you see there's a storm going on?
a real neck-breaker?
I didn't see any storm.
well.
if that's the case, I'm going home.
I'm certainly not in the mood for this.
there's really only one decision you'll be making tonight.
red pajamas or green pajamas? - Nope.
I'm going home.
well, in case you change your mind,
I'll leave the green pajamas out right next to your drink and you can...
I haven't left yet. - No, of course, - you haven't I'm inviting you to stay... - How could you go and tell her those things?
tell whom what?
if you don't mind my asking? - You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
how could you say such things to that child?
and who gave you the right to talk about my legs anyway?
well everyone else does. Why not me?
what? - Well, that's how you like it.
if it wasn't, why you wouldn't have your skirts taken up every time you - I don't care what you think!
it's no conversation for a child! - Child!
I don't know how it was where you came from.
maybe the, the sweet young things were told by their mothers at age 17, and were greatly surprised.
but that kid? She knows.
what am I supposed to do? Act like a zany when I drive off with you at night, and don't bring you back until the next morning?
you think she doesn't know where you've been?
hell, she even asks me how many times.
and you tell her?
sure. She greatly admires my capacity, and yours.
now I see it.
I always thought it was funny that she never invited these Pasadena people to visit her once in a while.
because, you've been filling her up with all this foolishness!
the best legs are found in kitchens, not in drawing rooms?
she actually believes Glendale isn't good enough.
and that, I'm not good enough! - Oh, for God's sake.
what invitations are you talking about?
to my mother's? To cocktail parties I've dragged her to?
who would expect a 14-year-old girl...- There have been plenty of others.
girls her own age... - No, actually, there haven't.
girls her own age, if you haven't noticed, don't interest Veda.
you've set her against me! I,I, I don't care...
I don't care a bit for all your fine talk! You've set her against me!
you wanna know why Veda never invites anybody to that house of yours?
no, I don't! - You wanna know why nobody ever goes there?
I'm going home. - Because you're afraid to have people come over,
what would you do with them? You haven't got the nerve!
doesn't it strike you as funny that, that Veda has 100 friends, here, there, everywhere she goes, and you haven't any?
no, I'm wrong, you have one. That bartender.
but that's all. Nobody ever gets invited to your house, nobody.
what...
what are you talking about?
how can I give parties, or invite people, with a...
with a living to make, and a...
a business to run... - Living, my eye!
that's your excuse!
because nobody but a varlet would give a second's thought to what you've been talking about tonight.
you know, once I thought I was mistaken, that maybe you were a lady, after all.
that was when you handed me that first $20 bill, and I took it.
you see a lady wouldn't care. But you...
before I'd borrowed even 50 bucks, you had to go, and make a chauffeur out of me to get your money's worth.
and rub it in. Well, no more.
I've taken my last dime off you, Mildred, and God willing, before my sun goes down, I'll pay back every cent of it!
you know what this needs, is the crime of rape!
don't be a fool!
not in this storm, don't be a damn fool!
Oh God.
help!
mother!
what... - Tomorrow, you get your piano.
mildred Pierce Part 03
part 5
don't forget, you have an appointment at 11: 00 this morning...
you book a studio at 9: 00. Not 9: 30, not at 10: 00.
eh, Okay, 9:00.
Mr. Treviso? - Yes? Do I know you?
I'm terribly sorry to startle you.
I'm Mrs. Pierce. We met once before.
my daughter, Veda, I believe, is now studying with you, singing.
okay...
well, um... for reasons best known to herself,
Mr. Treviso, Veda prefers her independence from me at the moment.
just the same, it was I who supported her studies from the beginning and...
even though she elects to live apart from me now,
I still feel her music is my responsibility.
so... in the future, Mr. Treviso, I'd like you to forward your bills directly to me.
I'm very sorry, Madame, but this is a subject, which I cannot discuss with you.
you excuse me, I have important engagement.
well, Mr. Treviso, I'm very sorry too, but I'm afraid...Veda is my daughter, after all, - and I feel that I have every right... - Why do you want this girl back?
tell me that? - What...
you're mistaking my motives.
no mistake, no mistake at all.
I tell Veda,"Hey, you pretty lucky kid, somebody else pay a bill now.
and she, she got no idea who to call up, say thanks.
sure is swell, how you like to see me again, huh?
Vincenzo, come to get me with the car!
that wasn't my intention, but certainly, if Veda did feel... - Yes, Sir, right away.
listen, you.
you seem like a sensible lady, no?
you go to a zoo, huh?
see little snake?
is from India, is all red, yellow, black, very pretty little snake.
you take home, huh?
make little pet, like puppy dog? No, you got more sense.
I tell you, it is the same with this Veda.
you buy ticket, you look at the little snake, but you no take home.
no.
what are you insinuating, that my daughter is a snake?
no, is coloratura soprano... is much worse.
uh, what is a coloratura...
Madame, is special fancy breed, like a blue Persian cat.
come once in a lifetime, sing all in the trill, staccato, ha, ha, ha, cadenza, a tough stuff.
cost like hell.
if is real coloratura, brings more dough to grand opera house than big wop tenor.
and this girl is coloratura, even her bones is coloratura.
you see the high nose, the deep antrum sinus?
you see Snack-O-Ham program?
I did.
so. She is not good singer. Is great singer.
she's a wonderful girl.
no, is wonderful singer.
the girl is something else.
well, that's your surmise, Mr. Treviso.
is no surmise.
for last two weeks, ever since Snack-O-Ham program, this little empress have told me that her poor, dumb mother will try to get her back.
and first thing she do, is come in here, offer pay for singing lessons.
she... - Yes!
I tell you, is snake, is bitch, is coloratura.
and me, I no enjoy a snake bite.
you want to try and keep her under mama's wing her whole life?
that is your business.
me, I have nothing to do with this intrigue.
now, if you'll excuse me...
avanti. - Si, Maestro.
Tommy, pull over the car. - Yes, ma'am.
Monty? Is that you?
what are you doing here?
uh, hot date with my creditors. Sort of between cars these days.
well, hop in. I'll give you a lift. - No, no, no.
I've actually come to enjoy the public pageantry, but you're very kind.
don't be silly, I insist.
I can't stand to argue with a lady.
what a surprise.
would you fill up table thirteen's coffee?
would you look who's here?
well, you look wonderful.
can't complain. Rather, I could, but I won't.
and you? How's our dear Veda?
Oh... Busy, very busy.
she, um, took an apartment by herself a few months ago.
it bothered her to have the neighbors listening while she vocalized.
she's singing, you know. - I heard.
I heard. She quite bowled me over, in fact.
you have quite a talented daughter, Mrs. Pierce. Please pass on my regards.
thank you. I shall.
Oh, who am I fooling, Monty?
I haven't talked to her in months.
she won't answer my calls. She won't answer my letters.
I'm honestly at my wits' end.
well, I'm sure it's just a phase she's going through.
she'll be coming back sooner or later. They always do.
how would you know?
no, I hope you're right.
I'm right. I'm always right.
well, there is something you may have been right about all along.
Oh?
it's Glendale.
I've simply gotta find a place more centrally located.
I'm in the car all day.
well, hallelujah.
and I've been thinking Pasadena.
Mmm-hmm.
between the three restaurants, it would really be the most convenient.
actually, I've been meaning to call you to coerce you into showing me around a little.
just to help me get my bearings.
nobody knows it better than you.
sounds like what you need is a real estate agent.
no, that's exactly what I want to avoid.
well, perhaps, something could be arranged...
I'd have to check my schedule, of course.
would you?
on one condition. I get this.
this side of Sierra Madre is, it's less desirable, though the price tag drops considerably.
Oh. All right.
eaton Drive is charming.
mcdonald Park, that's a laugh.
went to school with Duncan, when his father was busy buying up the block and renaming it.
this one off Lomora looks promising. I don't know about the condition.
Oh, and this place, the old Cunningham estate is top-drawer.
I like that.
this you can skip, and this one. I wouldn't even look at that.
and this old Tudor knockoff, it's, it's a bit of a farce.
Oh, I don't like that at all.
you're better off in Oak Knolls or Gwinn Park, I think.
here's 5441, not sure about the condition, but...
Oh! Might as well have a look.
stop that!
not quite what I had in mind.
do we get the dog too?
stop that!
well...
beautiful.
this? Could be. With a little money spent on it.
come in, if you want.
I don't have much to offer.
just for a peep.
beautiful. Just beautiful.
what do they want for it?
Oh, uh, year before last, 75 flat.
last year, 50, 000. Now it's more like 30...
when was it built?
uh, ground broke in '09.
so, I can offer you tea, or something stronger.
I'd love something stronger.
I'm out of ice and seltzer.
I prefer it straight.
ha. Since when?
I do think that Oak Knoll property is something to look into...
I'll see what I can dig up on the owners.
Cheers.
you haven't changed so much.
on liquor, I'd say you were about the same.
well, I prefer rye, these days...
Oh, gosh, Monty. It's such a wonderful place.
I'm tempted to stop looking right now.
it does have its charms.
you haven't even seen the gardens.
you don't have to sell me.
and you don't have to stand there yelling from across the room, either.
so how are you? Honestly.
I'm fine. - I'm glad.
how are you?
I'm fine.
well, I'm glad too.
you know, gentlemen in my circumstances don't, don't have a great deal of romance in their lives.
if you keep this up, you might find yourself the victim of some ravening brute.
being ravened isn't so bad.
just the same, we should try and stick to the house.
one thing bothers me.
what's that?
well... If I were to actually buy the place, what would happen to you?
I mean, would there be a brute, ravening around somewhere, or would I have it all to myself?
all yours. Lock, stock and barrel.
I see.
and I made a slight mistake before, about the price. To you, it's $29, 580.
that'll square up a little debt I owe you, that's been bothering me for quite some time.
you owe me a debt?
if you try, I think you can recall it.
Boo!
Oh damn it, your legs are still immoral.
you think they're bowed?
stop waving them around.
I asked you. - No.
no.
Oh, Monty.
how could I ever live here without you? I couldn't do it.
well, I always said you'd make some guy a fine wife, if you didn't live in Glendale.
is that a proposal?
if you move to Pasadena, it is.
you mean if I buy this house. - No.
no, it's about three times as much house, as you need, and there are plenty of other likely, wiser choices.
but, I won't live in Glendale.
then, all right.
Yes. Yes!
what do you say we ride to Laguna to celebrate? Under the stars.
Mmm.
not unless I can go in a dinner coat.
that mockery of elegance is about all I have left.
then we'll skip Laguna. I love you in a dinner jacket.
we'll step out properly and pop champagne!
if it's true.
if we really are engaged...
that's it. K-E-C-A,"The Aristocrat of the Air. "Told you she'd be on it.
you know who that is, don't you, on the radio?
that's Veda Pierce, Mrs. Pierce's daughter.
you don't say. - I do say.
give my regards to Mr. Eckstein.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.
she's a comer, too. You watch!
I sure will.
here. And the receipt.
also, Mrs. Jaeckel, it appears I might be looking at some extra expenses this month and may need to adjust my compensation.
what is it right now, exactly?
seventy-five a week from each of the corporation's parts, the three restaurants, and the pie factory. That's... 300 total.
starting next week, increase that to four.
four hundred? - Yes.
we'll have to transfer funds from the corporate reserve, ma'am.
into current cash. To cover the balance.
whatever you think best, Mrs. Jaeckel.
it's just for the time being.
certainly, Mrs. Pierce.
Mrs. Pierce? It's Mr. Beragon on the line.
thank you, Sigrid.
get over here. Something to show you at the plantation.
what, you mean, right now? - Yes, right now.
Hello?
when the furniture came, I couldn't resist any longer.
Oh, Monty! It's wonderful.
I have a simple theory.
whatever pertains to comfort, shoot the works.
but with whatever pertains to show, be a little modest.
people like you better if you aren't so damned rich.
you're very wise.
Oh, you framed it.
the dining room set arrives Thursday, but have a look in here.
Oh well, I don't know about this.
you don't think it's...
well, I don't know what to think!
sit down a minute, and take a lesson in interior decorating.
I love lessons in decorating.
do you know the best room I was ever in?
no. Tell me.
that den of yours, or Bert's rather, over in Glendale.
everything in that room meant something to that guy.
those banquets, those foolish-looking blueprints of houses that'll never be built.
they do things to you.
because, it's all part of him. And that's why the room is good.
and do you know the worst room I was ever in?
go on, I'm learning.
it's that living room of yours, in the same house.
not one thing in it, until that piano came, ever meant a thing to you, or him, or anybody else.
you see, a home isn't meant to be a museum.
filled with Picasso paintings, or Oriental rugs, like this place used to be.
it's meant to be furnished with things that actually matter.
let's have this place the way we want it.
and if you don't like the Pie Wagon corner, I do.
I love it.
then it stays.
I love it.
Oh, look at you two!
to the newlyweds!
to the happy couple!
sweetie.
congratulations, Mr. Beragon.
Tommy. Thanks.
he's a real thoroughbred, Mildred.
I couldn't be happier for you.
Oh thank you, Bert.
that means a great deal to me.
Where's Mrs. Beiderhof? I'd love to say hello.
well, funny story.
Maggie's husband struck oil in Texas not long ago, and Maggie decided to go join him there.
these days I'm living with Mom and Pop.
but, what husband? I thought she was a widow!
well, there's the thing of it. So did I.
Oh, Bert... - Feels just like Ginger Rogers, coming down the stairs, don't it?
best wishes, Mrs. Beragon. - Thank you.
thank you so much. - Honestly, Mildred, it just looks like heaven.
it's the lap of luxury, all right.
I tell you, it's all Monty.
ya know, Mildred, I've had a heck of a time getting you on the phone this week.
last month's books...
I can't make heads or tails of the balances.
if you've got just a minute tonight, maybe you could clear something up for me?
Oh, please, Ida, can't we leave business just for one day?
first thing tomorrow, I promise.
well, I suppose it can wait one more day...
still no sign of Mr. Beragon?
Oh, yes, ma'am, he just arrived. With a young lady.
Oh, there she is.
Hello, darling.
back with the olives, catastrophe averted.
thank you, Arline.
they said you arrived with a young lady and I, I just...
Oh... I thought I was doing so well.
Oh, you're doing brilliantly.
I sent her that invitation myself.
and I know she saw the notices in the paper.
and I just... I just hoped, that's all.
I'm sure she got the message.
then that's even worse.
don't be so sure.
thank you. - You're welcome.
well, God damn it, how did you get to be a singer?
when I discovered you, practically...pulled you out of the gutter, you were strictly keyboard.
darling.
I turn my back for one second and you, you turn into some kind of yodeler!
well, God damn it, it was an accident.
well, then report.
I was at the Philharmonic. - Oh, yes, I've been there.
and it was... the Schubert Unfinished.
and afterwards, I was walking across the park to my car, and I was humming it.
and that's when I saw him, walking ahead of me...
who? - Treviso.
now, I had plenty of reason for not wanting to meet the honorable signor.
why so?
I'd played for him once before, and he wasn't at all appreciative.
but he stopped and turned around and said "Was that you just now, singing?"
and I wasn't so proud of my singing just about then, because I was singing full chest and sounded exactly like a man.
Hannen used to call me the Glendale Baritone.
so, I said it really wasn't any of his concern whether I was singing or not.
and he grabbed me by the arm, and said it concerned him very much.
and insisted that I meet him the very next day.
And? - Thanks.
and I went. How could I refuse?
and then for a solid week, he worked on me, - Here you go.
trying to get me to sing like a woman.
and then finally, finally! It just began to come.
and that's when I got my revenge. - Do tell.
well, he said I had the voice, but if I wanted to be a real musician,
I would have to master music, too.
so I asked him if there was any sight reading he wanted done.
Oh, touche.
and he handed me the Inflamatus from Rossini's Stabat Mater.
well, I went through that like a hot knife through butter.
and then I showed him my arranging, and all the theory that Hannen hammered into me.
if the wop hit gold in Death Valley, he couldn't have acted more like a goof.
he started going over me with these little wooden hammers, and gadgets with lights that went down my throat, and...
he even went digging up my, uh... - He went for the dairy?
now, Monty... - What?
believe it or not, yes!
turns out it wasn't love he was looking for. Just meat!
he said it enriches the tone!
you just heard the Casta Diva aria from Bellini's Norma, performed by Miss Veda Pierce.
in Milano? Or Cannes? - When she lifted up her arm just so...
I tell you, if I ever saw one right out of the can, Mrs. Pierce, she's it, your daughter.
there she is, there's Veda. - Thank you.
well, you never know. - Congratulations!
now I'm not usually one to make rash decisions, Miss Pierce.
but we're about to start a promotion, on a new vitamin bread, it's called "Sunbake."
I handle Miss Pierce.
Ted Hobey, president, Consolidated Foods.
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Levinson.
I'm prepared to offer your client a two-year contract, $2500 a week, plus a guaranteed mention in 25% of Consol's national advertising, if you come to New York and sing for Sunbake Bread.
how does that strike you?
sorry, pal, it strikes me fine, but, uh, she's sewed.
she sings for "Pleasant," the mentholated cigarettes, so, uh, it's out of the question.
But...New York!
certainly there must be something we could... - Sorry, kid, a contract's a contract.
you signed on the dotted line. Nothing to do about that.
but... - Well, I'm sorry to hear it.
but if anything changes, the offer stands. You keep us in mind.
thank you, Mr. Hobey, we certainly shall.
I'm sorry, Ted. - That's all right.
sewed?
to Pleasant cigarettes?
for an entire year?
five hundred a week is nothing to sneeze at.
it's true, dear. That... that's still a great deal of money.
mother, that's not the point!
there are levels in this business, and we just had the chance to move up, and we missed it.
do you have any idea what New York means to a classical singer?
if Levinson had looked ahead two minutes, and not... jumped on the first boat that came along...
if he hadn't been so greedy... - Hey, hey.
now suppose ya take it back.
suppose ya say you're sorry.
why should I? It's the truth, isn't it?
cause I got an offer for ya, and this you're gonna want to hear.
what offer?
the Philharmonic.
headliner.
the Philharmonic Auditorium?
why, that's marvelous!
big time.
then, accept. If the terms are suitable.
not so fast, baby.
it's kind of a double offer. They'll take a Pierce, or they'll take Opie Lucas.
they leave it to me.
I handle ya both, and Opie, she don't cuss me out. She's nice.
a contralto's no draw.
contralto gets it, if you don't apologize.
Okay...Levy, I apologize.
don't go startin' nothing with Moe Levinson.
maybe ya don't know where you're comin' out...
Monty, go find Tommy, will you? Tell him we'll be ready very soon.
yes dear, Congratulations, kiddo!-- Say, Levy, how 'bout those snaps?
Thanks, Monty. - Oh, Veda.
the Philharmonic.
do you remember the first concert I took you to at the Philharmonic?
it was a Young People's Concert... - Picture time, doll.
mustn't keep the boys waitin'.
excuse me, Mother. - You go on.
here she is, fellas. She's all yours.
miss Pierce! Over here, Miss Pierce.
and Qui La Voce would be the perfect finish.
it'll be no Opie Lucas repertoire, I promise you that.
then there's the dress to consider... the color, the fabric.
not to mention, the little matter of a publicity agent.
thank you, Monty.
I saw a lovely pale peach gown at Bullock's, in satin.
this isn't the kind of dress you shop for, mother.
it's not?
this dress gets made. And the hat.
the hat? For the Philharmonic?
just for the first interval. To give a sense of progression, a gain in intimacy.
the consummate showman.
we'll need to reserve seats. A dozen at least.
I'll talk to Levinson in the morning.
Yes, do.
and some sort of supper following. That needs planning as well.
well, I'm done in.
you ladies are obviously up for hours, scheming.
don't go, Monty.
you might have heard, I have chores in the morning.
I think I'll stay in the tack room tonight.
Oh, I don't want to turn you out.
that's quite all right.
I guess we're truly middle-aged, aren't we, Monty?
I guess that's it.
good night, dear.
sleep tight.
that's four pounds shrimp, four pounds lobster, - two pounds crab... - Crab?
Yes. - And the caviar?
and one pound caviar, that's correct.
is this the restaurant account?
no, the second account.
and it's July 20th. - Ah, yes.
Yes, the big night. - Very big night indeed.
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Peters.
a pleasure, Mrs. Beragon.
Yes, Sigrid?
I have a pile of messages.
Mr. Eckstein called, says he still hasn't received his May payment.
I'll have to call him back.
also, your florist called. Plus Ida again...
Oh, Ida! Shoot!
is that the florist's number? - Yes.
Oh, and Mr. Burgan called.
Wally? What did he want?
he didn't say. Just that it was important you call him back.
take messages. I'll get back to them as soon as I can.
Yes, Mrs. Pierce...
Yes, Mrs. Beragon.
Hello, this is Mrs. Beragon.
Ah, Mrs. Beragon, how are you today?
very good, thank you.
now do you have any white orchids?
take these two down to the cellar. - All right.
Ah, swell.
the delivery we've all been waiting for.
Yes, sir.
nothing broken, I trust?
all looks fine.
I would put those on the top. - Yes, sir.
Hello, dear.
I thought you were seeing to the garden today.
well, I was. But the liquor showed up, so Frederick and I are stocking the galley.
just checked the Chateau Lascombes, 1929. A perfect year.
taste? - Honestly, Monty. At this hour.
No! No!
Veda. - This is all wrong.
Veda. - Levy, no.
none of this "Pasadena Starlet" business...
it's got to be Glendale!
and radio! And studied right here in Los Angeles!
what do ya mean? This is fantastic!
you couldn't have written it better yourself!
there are 2, 000 seats in that place, and they've all got to feel like I'm one of them!
don't you see?
well... Okay, I guess you got a point.
afternoon, Mrs. Beragon.
never thought I'd hear you rooting for Glendale.
there's a first time for everything.
are you ready, Mrs. Temple?
voila!
Oh, Veda!
I think it's enchanting.
it's first class.
we added the bodice.
you don't think it's too Vaudeville?
vaudeville?
I can't come out looking like both Gish sisters.
Oh, don't be silly.
I'd skip the bodice.
all right, without the bodice. But, with a matching parasol!
a parasol? By Saturday? It'll have to be a rush.
whatever she needs, Mrs. Temple.
this is a very special occasion.
Oh, Mother, the time! I have rehearsal at 3: 00.
come... I'll take ya. I'm heading that way now.
Mrs. Beragon, Mr. Beragon.
you two run along. There's still so much to do here.
the silver. The linens...
look at you.
you'd think nothing was happening around here in four days time!
you'd think everything just happens by itself!
the crowds.
Tommy, I had no idea. - It's a scene all right.
I'm going to get out here.
sure thing, Mrs. Beragon.
and tell Veda, break a leg!
thank you, Tommy, I shall!
Mildred! It's right down here.
have you seen her? - Not yet.
I was waiting out front.
Monty drove her to rehearsal hours ago. But the traffic was awful!
I'll let you get back in here later, I promise, all right?
Veda! - Sorry, lady.
that's my daughter. - Oh, that's very nice, but there just isn't time.
I'll make sure that she gets your flowers, all right?
the orchestra to places!
clear the backstage area, please.
suppose we ought to go find our seats.
I'm telling you, Mildred, this thing is a sellout.
Oh, just look at the place.
you must be so proud. - And nervous. I'm nervous.
Hi. - Dear.
mother. Pop.
how is she? Was she nervous?
Yeah. Like steel.
fantastic! - Brava!
Brava!
well it's none of my business, but in my opinion, after an applause like that,
Treviso should have let her sing an encore.
I'm not much of an authority in this field, myself, Bert, but it's my impression that encores are rarely sung in the first half of a program.
it's... it's all reserved for the end.
I'm sure that's the case.
my mistake then. All I know is, they're eating it up.
Oh, they're eating it up all right.
Oh, yes.
Brava!
Bravo!
Brava!
even if...
even if it's not a song that's supposed to be sung on a symphony program, may I sing a song just because I want to sing it?
this one's just for you.
some fellas look and find the sunshine I always look and find the rain Some fellas make a winning some time I never even make a gain Believe me I'm always chasing rainbows Waiting to find a little bluebird In vain
Brava!
Brava!
Eckstein, Rossi, your market man, and your two grocers.
listen, all they want is some reassurance.
I spoke to Mr. Eckstein, and I know for a fact that payments went out on Monday.
the payments did not all go out on Monday. Or the Monday before.
listen, Mildred, nobody here wants any trouble.
believe me, as council to your creditors, it's in the interest of everybody at that table that you get yourself back on your feet, and become the A- number-one customer you've been in the past.
well the bakery must be doing all right. I see your pies all over town!
no, the bakery is doing just fine.
thank you, Mr. Rossi.
as are the restaurants, in Glendale and Beverly.
but, here in Laguna, since the opening of the Victor Hugo down the street, we...
we have seen a dip in business.
must be quite a dip.
it's not as bad as all that. - So where's the problem?
it's true this year I've had personal expenses and household debt that have been a little more than anticipated. And I've had to increase my salary for several months to compensate.
though I certainly think it's fair, considering my investment, - that uh, should the occasion arise that I would... - Hold on, hold on.
so what you're telling us is, you'd be showing a profit if it wasn't for your mansion in Pasadena?
to be honest, Mr. Eckstein, it really isn't anyone's business.
none of it's anyone's business, Mildred.
if we just went by what our business was, we'd have gone to court already, and kept our questions to ourselves. But we didn't do that.
we wanted to give you a break, and hear and what you had to say.
so what do you want to know? - I want to know what Veda pays in.
she's the big expense, isn't she?
I don't keep books on my own daughter. - Mildred, Veda is making plenty.
five hundred a week from Pleasant, plus what I got her in the settlement.
I mean, why wouldn't you be justified, in asking her for an amount, that could ease the pressure all around?
Wally, neither you nor anybody else, has a right to take what belongs to me, or what belongs to my child, to pay the bills of this business!
maybe you've forgotten, Mr. Wally Burgan, that it was you who told me to incorporate for precisely this reason, to keep my personal property safe from any kind of creditor.
maybe you've forgotten, but I haven't!
no, I haven't forgotten it.
and you're right, no one here can take a dime of your money, or Veda's.
all they can do is go to court, have you declared bankrupt, take over.
the court will appoint receivers. You'll be out.
fine! Then I'm out.
you'll be out, and Ida'll be in.
who?
that's a lie.
she would never do it, never...
Oh, yeah, she would.
sure, she cried at first, said she wouldn't listen to such a thing, because she was such a good friend of yours. But she couldn't get to you for weeks, just for a little talk. You were too busy with the concert.
maybe that hurt her feelings, maybe it made her wonder. Anyway, now...
she'll listen to reason.
and we figure, she can run this business just as good as anybody can run it.
maybe not as good as you, when you had your mind on it, but better than a stage-struck dame, who'd rather go to concerts than pay what she owes!
I'm telling you, Mildred, you gotta do three things.
you gotta cut down on your overhead, so you can live off of what you make.
you gotta raise some money, from some place, the place in Glendale, Veda, so you can square these bills and start over.
and you gotta cut out all this running around, and get down to work.
you show us some action by a week from tonight, and you can forget about what's been said here.
you don't... maybe we take a little action ourselves.
two sets of books...
and they...
I'll be.
and the accountants, did they... - It's all my doing, Bert.
all my fault...
the different ledgers were my idea.
but how'd you ever think you'd pay it all back?
well...
if everything you tell me is accurate. - Oh, it is, it is, Bert.
I've told you everything.
you're the only one I've told.
well... as far as I can tell, there's been no actual violation of the law.
not saying it wasn't pretty damn foolish.
but the fact is, Veda is the one who's costing you money, and she's the one that's making it. She's got to kick in.
that's all there is to it. - I never wanted her to know.
I never wanted her to know either, but she found out just the same, when I hit the deck.
if she'd had a little dough when Pierce Homes began to wobble, and I'd taken it, and Pierce Homes was ours right now, she'd be better off, right?
and who the hell put that girl where she is today?
who paid for all the music? And...
that piano, and the car and the clothes and...
you did your share.
mighty little.
you did a lot, Bert.
you did plenty.
we lived very well before the Depression, as well as any family ever lived in this country.
and for a long time.
Veda was 11 when we broke up.
she's only 20, now.
I've carried on nine years, but it was 11 for you.
eleven years and eight months.
all right.
eleven years and eight months.
but you know what? I'm glad.
I'm glad it was eight months.
we didn't know I was pregnant when we got married.
that proves, I loved you, doesn't it?
me too, Mildred.
me too.
Bert, would you talk to her?
I can't ask her for money. I'm not Wally, - I wouldn't know how to begin. - Sure.
thank you.
so, tomorrow sometime?
at the house? - Mildred, we can't wait till tomorrow.
Why? What do you mean?
you've got to talk to her tonight.
tonight? It's too late, she'll be asleep.
I can't help how late it is, we've got to see her tonight.
because you forgot, and I forgot, and we both forgot who we're dealing with here.
Mildred, you can't trust Wally Burgan, not even till the sun comes up!
he was my pal, and he crossed me!
he was your pal, and he crossed you!
but he was Veda's pal too, Mildred. And maybe he's getting ready to cross her too, and somehow get his hands on her dough!
he can't, not for corporate debts. - How do you know?
I know, because...
he, he told me so!
he helped me set up the corporation... -That's it.
he told you!
Wally Burgan told you!
how can we believe anything that guy says?
maybe that meeting today was just a phony.
maybe he's getting ready to compel you to take her money, as her guardian, so he can attack it!
she's still a minor, you know.
Mildred, you're seeing her tonight.
and you're getting her out of that house before any process server can find you.
you understand me? - Yes.
you're meeting me at the Brown Derby, in Hollywood for breakfast, and by that time I'll be busy.
there'll be four of us at that table.
you, me, Veda...
and a lawyer.
Monty! - What?
it's me. I have to see you. Let me in.
why don't you go back to bed, and let me sleep?
it's about Veda!
now what? - I need to find Veda and she's not in her room.
she hasn't been there all evening. - Oh, for God's sake, is she an infant?
maybe she went somewhere. It's a free country.
she didn't go anywhere. -How do you know?
her dress is there.
couldn't she have changed it? - Her car is there.
couldn't she have gone with somebody else?
why, why are you?
Oh, God...
mother.
look, dear. You have a caller.
she looks a bit confounded, doesn't she?
for the life of me, I don't know why.
how could you?
how could I?
how could I!
that's quite rich, coming from you.
after so many years of using me for all your, your special purposes...
expecting me to jump every time you drop a bill, and begrudging me every cent.
you know, I,I thought it might be different this time around. I thought...
but you can barely even stand to look at me.
you don't think much of me, do you, Mildred?
does it make a difference what she thinks?
or what she pays for?
you thought you held the strings on everybody, didn't you?
you thought you could come around, and dress me up, and use me as bait to lure your famous daughter back to the teat!
no. - But it was live bait, Mildred.
it was live bait! And guess what?
this time the quarry and the bait fell in love! No kidding!
and for the first time in your life, there's nothing, - you hear me, nothing you can do about it! - Darling, please.
all this screaming. Get dressed now, and we'll clear out.
let go! Stop it!
Mildred, Let go!
Mildred, leave her alone!
Mildred, stop it! Stop this nonsense, right now!
came the dawn.
God, what a dawn.
surprise!
Congratulations!
to the newlyweds!
cheers to that!
I know this was you.
ma.
Oh, Mildred, let's get that out of your hair.
I can't believe it! I thought it seemed too quiet in here.
I never would have thought. - Look at you.
you look terrific.
so you liked Reno all right? - Oh, we liked it.
we liked it just fine. It wasn't here anyway, that's the main thing.
once the divorce came through, and Bert arrived, that's all I wanted.
well, we're sure glad to have you back. You know, I couldn't find the server.
Oh, I'll get it. I'll come with you.
I mean...
pop. You said you were watering the lawn. - I was.
how's Laguna? - Picking up.
strange, though, working for Mildred Pierce, Incorporated without you, baby.
and the new boss? - Ida?
I tell you, Mildred, I give her hell.
but we're still standing.
I thought she'd be here by now.
anyone else you're expecting? - Nope.
and if it's Veda you're hinting at, I did try calling.
didn't hear back.
well. I wouldn't have thought...
we did get a wonderful letter though, congratulating us.
and her voice is nearly healed, she said, which is...
well, that's a load off.
it would be if Pleasant Cigarettes hadn't cancelled her contract.
I meant for you.
Ida! I'm so pleased you came.
thank you, they're beautiful. - Oh, Mildred, I just...
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Ida, you did what you had to do.
I just wish it could of gone in a different way.
it's water under the bridge.
well.
you know, Mildred, Mr. Chris came in the other day.
I tell ya, he's just furious about the quality of pies that he's been getting, - you know, ever since we've been cutting back. - Can't blame him.
so I told him what happened, you know.
I explained to him, they ain't your pies no more.
and he says to me,"Why not, she still got hands, doesn't she?"
now, I know, I shouldn't be drummin' up more competition but...
there ya go!
right?
Bert? What is it?
it's, uh... Veda's outside.
well, let her in.
she wants to talk out there.
but why? - I don't know.
come inside. There's food.
I can't, Mother.
Hello, Father. - Veda.
but you've come all this way.
I'm actually on my way out.
I'm... I'm flying to New York this afternoon.
new York? Oh, we had no idea.
well, we all know that L. A. is hopeless for a classical singer, and...
now that my voice is better, uh, New York is the only real option.
but I heard you two were back, so I thought I'd stop by on my way.
so you're moving? To New York?
that's the idea.
alone?
no. Monty's there now.
and you're...
I presume you have some sort of job lined up?
as a matter of fact, I do.
I've been speaking with Mr. Hobey, Father, at Consolidated Foods.
he's been very patient. Very generous , and, uh, I think everything's gonna work out just fine.
they do a fine job. I've said so myself.
I'm very pleased with how it's all turned out.
how difficult it must have been...
playing your cards just so.
I have no idea what you mean, Mother.
consolidated Foods.
what was it? Twenty-five hundred a week?
not to mention, your ticket out of here, once and for all.
from everything you hate and despise.
that's the idea, isn't it?
now you're going to make me miss my flight.
goodbye, Father.
then go.
go!
was it even damaged, your voice?
was it? - Don't make a scene, Mother.
go! Get out of my sight!
I don't need you, either!
go to New York, for all I care!
and don't you ever come back!
do you hear me? Never again! I won't have it!
I won't have it!
thought I might find you here.
what?
to hell with her.
I said, to hell with her!
all right, Bert.
to hell with her!
God damn it.
that's what I wanna hear!
come on...
we've got each other.
haven't we?
let's get stinko.
Yes.
let's get stinko.
they live the lie so willingly, don't they, Father?
sorry, I didn't hear.
the ordained pretension of the sacred charade.
are you feeling close to God tonight, Father?
excuse me?
no, I won't.
tell me your sins. Tell me what a liar you are.
what's your name, son?
bless you, Father, for you have sinned.
son, wait a minute.
son.
inquisitor Deum, Father.
est in nomine Dei, Padre.
wait, wait, wait.
something smells wonderful.
what is it? - Scrapple.
what's scrapple?
it's a mystery. - It's leftovers.
what do you want to do today? - Aren't you gonna work today?
today's Sunday. Day of rest... and fun.
what's that, Daddy?
it's okay, Jordan. - Frank?
it's a bird! - Don't touch it, sweetie.
flew into the window. - Why?
saw its reflection and got confused.
what's the matter with it?
it's just hurt.
is it going to get better, Mommy?
we hope so, sweetie.
Yeah. Yeah, this is me.
hold on a minute. - who is it?
work.
it's not moving, Mommy.
it's just resting, Jordan. - Where in Tacoma?
it's not breathing.
okay.
is it going to die, mommy?
Ardis. - Hi, Frank.
where are we? - Closing ceremonies. The body's already been removed.
I thought you might want to see the crime scene. - Yeah.
the Tacoma P. D.'s a little overwhelmed right now...
but they're welcoming our help.
detective Kerney, this is Frank Black.
it's my understanding you have some insight into this.
there was a series of homicides in 1992 involving men of the cloth.
ms. Cohen and I were part of the F. B.I. investigative team.
did you catch the guy? - No.
the victim's name is Silas Brown.
Georgetown University...
and a former professor at the International Institute...
of Catechetical and Pastoral Studies in Brussels.
Ajesuit?
is that relevant? - I don't know.
I went to a Jesuit high school.
father Dodson left a permanent impression on me, if you know what I mean.
you see this, Ardis? He was wearing a sanbenito.
what's that? - It's a cloak.
during the Middle Ages, heretics were forced to wear it...
before they were burned at the stake.
did you see the forensics report?
same materials. - It was only a matter of time.
hold on. What do you mean the Middle Ages? What's that about?
the killer was very precise.
the process is important to him.
he treats the scene like a ceremony.
what kind of ceremony? - Medieval.
a freshly hewn stake, probably cut locally...
peat and wood for fuel.
and your group thinks this is the same guy?
very possibly. - Four years ago...
three men were murdered in a similar fashion.
then it stopped. Until last night.
victim is Caucasian male, 61 years old.
there is evidence of blunt trauma...
to the occipital protrusion on the cranium.
sooty residue in the air passages indicates the victim was most certainly alive...
when he was fastened to the stake.
he asphyxiated. - Carbon monoxide robbed his lungs of oxygen.
when the threshold drops below 21%...
thankfully, you pass out.
I know we both hoped we wouldn't be here again.
but here we are.
look at this, Ardis.
what?
you see?
the tongue. Something burned into it.
there was nothing specified.
fused in the char.
what is it, Frank?
a coin.
a Spanish peseta. - New killer, Frank?
a break in the pattern.
a refinement in his M. O.
some kind of symbolism. Or possibly an escalation.
maybe we can pull a print.
can I help you?
I'm sorry. I-- I don't know my way around here.
a friend of mine died. I'm supposed to arrange to have him sent to a funeral home.
father Brown? - Yes.
I'm Father Schultz. - You were his friend.
he was a good man. A true believer.
that's not as popular as it used to be.
don't look for a reason, Father.
are you saying there isn't one?
not one that would make any sense right now.
the man who did this-- who we believe did this
he does it without conscience.
is that evil?
there's a disconnectedness out there.
and those desperate with that feeling expect faith to fill the void.
and when it doesn't, they blame us.
I can't speak to that, Father.
no? - I'm afraid my own faith is lacking.
well, I've ministered to many who've lost their way.
I think my time would be better spent trying to catch the man who killed your friend.
coming up?
Yeah. Right up.
jordan had kind of a bad day today, Frank.
she was really upset about the bird.
what did she say?
she asked me if dogs die...
horses, cars, trees
us.
what did you tell her? - I mustered all my clinical powers and...
lied.
I told her you and I would live forever.
so back me up on that, will ya? - Yes.
they asked you to work on this murder...
of the priest, haven't they?
I saw it on the news.
it's frightening, you know?
churches, clergy.
symbols of what is supposed to be safe haven coming under attack.
why do they do it, Frank? - That's what we're trying to find out.
if you get a chance, talk toJordan, okay?
I'll be right up.
Ooh. Take a mulligan.
Nah. I'll just be chasin' two balls in the rough.
you go on ahead.
see you tomorrow? Same time?
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
this yours, Reverend?
titan three?
Yes, it is.
tough lie.
Yes. Uh, are you playing this hole?
I was considering it.
playing with one club?
one's all it takes, Reverend.
do I know you? - I kept my vows.
I loved, honored and obeyed.
I'm sorry. I don't remember.
well
it's just a job.
I've been retired for four years now.
retired from the Lord.
I hear you.
never pass up a chance to improve your lie. Right, Reverend?
Yep.
that hurts.
you were trying to trick me, weren't you?
Yeah. - You little rascal, you.
mommy said you had some questions for me.
the bird died.
Yes.
what happens to it?
lots of different ideas. No one knows exactly.
some people think the soul goes to another house.
A-Another yellow house?
Yeah. Kind of.
does God live there? - Lots of people think he does.
do you?
I think that if he does...
he'd say to you it's way past your bedtime.
I think he would say you're a little rascal.
say good night to Mommy. - Good night, Mommy.
good night, sweetie. - Good night, Daddy.
good night, baby.
this is Casey.
Hi, this is Frank Black. Can I speak to Ardis?
his name was Marcus Crane. He was a retired Presbyterian minister.
if this is the same killer...
this is the first time he's targeted a Protestant.
what was the cause of death?
again, blunt trauma to the head to incapacitate the victim.
the instrument was wedge-shaped, probably a golf club.
but he died of drowning.
the torture of heretics.
golf or drowning?
the staging is just another method of determining...
the piety of the accused heretic.
a one-man Inquisition. - He planned this very carefully.
he took time to watch the victim...
to plan the ceremony.
if that's what he's doing, Frank, what is he trying to tell us?
his choice to alter his methods is semiotic.
the coin in the mouth, the elaboration of details.
they're not meant as a message.
they're for his own satisfaction.
his lack of denominational concerns would indicate that he's becoming more random.
not more random. More precise.
my guess is he knew these men.
that he was once a member of their church.
a seminarian...
or an altar boy.
there's something else here.
something they found on the body. - What?
a man's wedding band in the victim's stomach.
were there initials? A date?
no. Nothing.
hmm.
the victim gagged.
the choke reflex made it difficult to swallow.
so you think something else might have been put in the mouth.
something that wasn't ingested.
something that was overlooked.
nothing here but drinking and driving. We've pretty much gone through it, Frank.
when they pulled the body out of the lake, which bank did they remove it from?
I believe the other side.
Ardis. - Yeah, what is it?
a woman's engagement ring, soldered to a wedding band.
it's engraved.
the killer's initials? - If we're lucky.
the initials are engraved by hand.
the craftsmanship is very fine.
messina is the designer.
the word is stamped two millimeters from the setting.
the number 750 is stamped one centimeter beyond...
the craftsman's stamp.
the ring is made of rose gold-- in Italy sometime in the '40s.
the number indicates the gold content to be 18 karats.
an American serviceman bought a ring for his sweetheart during the war?
or maybe it's a family heirloom. - Maybe both.
even if he were drafted at 18, that would make him about 70 years old now.
the killer's a younger man.
just came in over the wire.
" a John Matewon, convicted felon, 35 years old...
arrived in Cheyenne yesterday on a charter from Tacoma. "
he used a credit card to check into a Motel Eight on Route 60 at 8: 00 p. m.
no middle initial. - Will you take two out of three?
go, go, go, go, go!
check the bathroom!
we got him! Move it!
what is going on here?
Frank, this is Detective Romero, Rockford P. D. Forensics.
Hi. What else did you find?
the kitchen sink. We've got bloody prints off the cabinets.
what makes you think this is your guy?
you found a Spanish coin.
the man we've been looking for has left them behind before.
if it is him, he's getting sloppy.
this isn't like him. - Maybe he was surprised.
is there any description of the assailant?
the church secretary, Beatrice Crowly, could only give us a narrative
that a man attacked her, hit her across the face, then fled.
where is she now? - Froedert Hospital. She's gonna be fine.
was anything missing from the office?
we won't know till she's able to go through the mess.
with any luck, she's gonna take a look this afternoon.
Charlie, come here. - Excuse me.
we've got a big change in M. O. here, Frank.
the detail of the coin aside.
what was he looking for here?
information.
something important enough to travel a great distance to find.
for the Bible tells me so.
little ones to him belong
they are weak but he is strong
Yes, jesus loves me - Yes, jesus loves me. - I know what he's doing.
the killer? - Yes.
he's not killing men. He's killing faith.
Why? - I don't know.
he was here looking for a name, an address. - Choosing his next victim.
he didn't come this far by accident. He knows who his victims are.
I, uh, don't mean to bother you, Mr. uh, Calloway...
but I need the holder of the card to sign.
she's dead. - Pardon me?
the holder of the card-- my wife-- she's dead. Is that a problem?
no, no. No problem. I'm sorry to hear that. - Yes.
it's just that the, uh, credit card company won't authorize the charges.
cash still good here? - Wouldn't turn it down.
you wouldn't happen to know a man in town named Jack Harned, would you?
Reverend Harned? Sure. - Seems he doesn't live at his old address.
he, uh, moved into his dad's house a couple of years back...
after the old man passed away.
maybe I could get that address from you.
I'd like to make his reacquaintance.
sure.
this is the best one lifted from the set.
the initial thought was that these were partials.
but unfortunately this appears to be the killer's whole fingerprint.
the ellipticals were erased or mutilated.
we put them up on the N. e.I. e. to look for a match.
what if they were burned in a fire?
why a fire?
maybe the killer experienced an emotionally catastrophic event-- a loss.
something that consumed his faith but didn't kill it.
and now what? He's going to finish the job?
describe the killer. Define his victims.
but how is he choosing them, Frank? What's the victimology?
his victims have been a religious significance in his life.
but what?
I've got Beatrice crowly on the phone.
she was able to go through the files, says there are ones definitely missing.
which one? - Christening records.
a whole year's worth.
Mrs. Harned? - Yes.
Hi. I'm an old friend of your husband's.
a very old friend.
is, uh, he home by any chance? - Oh, he's just inside.
we're in a bit of a panic.
Jack's officiated hundreds of christenings...
but this is the first time he's doing it for a family member.
our little Emma.
your granddaughter. - Yes.
the light of our lives. You have children?
no. No, I don't.
well, Jack's so excited...
he didn't even remember to pick up his vestments from the cleaners.
why don't you come on in. I've gotta run out.
be right back.
I just don't understand it.
I could have given him the information he needed.
Mrs. Crowly, do you have any idea why he took those files?
no. They'rejust records.
there isn't much information on them.
do the files contain the name of the men and women who did the christening?
there was Reverend Lawrence. Sweet man.
he died last year. - What was the name of the other man?
Reverend Harned. - Yes?
I was just talking to your wife. You must be... mighty excited.
who are you? - My name is Galen Calloway.
you don't recollect my face?
no.
I think you'd better get the hell out of my house, son.
do you hear me?
aren't you gonna answer it, Reverend?
Hello?
Reverend Harned? My name is Frank Black.
I'm working with the Rockford Police Department.
we believe that your life may be in danger.
during the Inquisition, priests were forbidden to draw blood.
so they would heat their tools red hot.
Hello, sir? - That way the wound cauterized.
no blood...
no mess.
listen very carefully. We're on our way.
please, do not let anyone in your house.
Hello, sir?
Reverend Harned, don't let anyone in.
I already have.
Reverend Harned?
we missed him by minutes, Frank.
the son of a bitch. - Yeah.
in all these years, we work at a distance, with a remove.
it helps us to objectify.
so why is this one different to me?
the coldness, the calculation, the victims.
merciless acts against the merciful.
I haven't been to church since I was eight.
I've always been happily cynical.
so why am I taking this so personally?
I feel it myself.
have you and your wife raised Jordan in any particular faith, Frank?
no. Catherine and I haven't even dealt with it yet.
I know.
my husband and I make it up as we go along.
maybe faith is like a picture album left in a closet.
we don't go back and visit it every day.
we need to know it's there. We need to know it's safe.
so we can pass it along when the time is right.
Ardis, the killer.
we haven't found him yet...
because he isn't on the move.
he's still here. - What makes you say that?
he was at the house when we called.
he knew we were on our way.
he didn't hurry. He didn't compromise the ritual.
he was resigned, committed.
he's become comfortable.
you get the luxury of calmness in a murder when you know your surroundings.
you think he's come home. - I think...
that this is where the tragedy of his life occurred.
february 14, 1989.
Joan Calloway and her six-year-old daughter, Sarah, died in a house fire.
Galen ealloway, the father and husband, survived but suffered third-degree burns...
to his arms and hands.
" teacher of religious studies at Edgewood Catholic High School. "
geez, my kids go there. - Mother's maiden name mosier, janice marie.
it was his mother's ring, Frank. - Three years after the fire...
he was tried, convicted and sentenced to five years for D. U.I. vehicular manslaughter.
Ardis, he was paroled after three.
he didn't stop killing four years ago.
he was just interrupted.
I need two things, Detective.
the church where the wife's funeral was held.
and the one where the daughter was baptized. Both will be Protestant.
and one of them is where he'll strike next.
" I love thee, oh, Lord, my strength.
" the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer.
" my God, my rock of refuge.
" my shield. The horn of my salvation.
my strong- "
if any one of you tries to leave, you will die.
if you just sit down and sit still...
if you just sit down and sit still...
I will tell you about the fiction and the fallacy...
as brought to you by the salesmen of salvation.
who are you?
I...
am the lamb.
" the mercy of the Lord...
is from everlasting to everlasting, " he said.
confess your faith unto him who said 'All souls are mine. "
go, go!
we have to set up lines of communication immediately.
but hell...
is stronger than heaven...
and fire burns hotter than love.
there is no peace.
there is no forgiveness.
just lonely nights...
spent in empty houses.
rejoice!
thy kingdom come...
is here!
I hear a phone. Where's the phone?
it's right over
Where's the damn phone?
is he shootin' hostages? We gotta go in.
let's not make this any worse.
come on, Calloway. Come on.
Mr. Calloway, this is Frank Black.
you a police officer? - No, I'm not.
what's the shooting about? Is anybody hurt?
he'll live... for a while.
I want you to calm down. There's no need to shoot anybody.
really. Why is that?
I know why you're here.
you know why I'm here? You think you know why I'm here?
you're here because of Joanie and Sarah.
I'm gonna go in there.
and lose that chopper.
Frank, no.
you know as well as I do there's no hostage-for-hostage scenario that's ever worked.
the hostages are incidental. - Not if he's shooting them.
he's on a suicide march. - So you're gonna become another unintended casualty?
I think I can reach him. - What makes you say that?
I know what he wants.
I'm not armed, Galen.
I just want to talk to you.
then talk.
let these people go.
they're here. They have to be sacrificed.
just like Joanie and Sarah were sacrificed.
I hear you, Galen. I know what you're doing.
you lie.
just like the priests and the holy men.
get down on the floor. Now!
get down on your knees!
first lie that passes your lips, I blow your head off.
what do you want to know?
are you afraid to die, Frank?
Yes.
then you don't believe in God.
I haven't thought about it in a very long time.
Why?
because I've seen the innocent die.
I've seen children murdered in their beds.
the weak and the helpless slaughtered...
without purpose, without sense.
then you know the truth.
you know that God has abandoned us.
that's why you're afraid to die.
just like I am.
no. - You're lying.
I'm afraid, Galen, but not like you.
you're afraid to die because you fear God's judgment.
I've lost my faith.
no. You tried to kill it, but you can't.
I've... seen your ritual.
you try to kill your faith...
with the tools of your own belief because of your pain...
because you think God's forsaken you.
you think that you can get rid of your pain...
by slaughtering the faith that's inside you.
it is inside of me, isn't it?
it just won't die.
I want to help you, Galen.
I've
I felt his presence all along.
him watching me.
Oh. Joanie and Sarah watching me.
but God doesn't want you to kill yourself.
or anyone else.
no.
no.
but I have to.
because...
I can't kill... him.
put your hands behind your back!
get up.
Hi.
Hi.
I tried to wait up.
it's all right. It's late.
are you okay?
Yeah.
I was just thinkin' on the plane about this man, Calloway.
I felt how human he was.
so inundated by pain.
fragmented by grief.
it led him to surrender his humanity.
I know, Frank.
it scares me.
we can't stop people, but we can't lose our faith either.
and you're thinking that's what we need to teach Jordan.
I'm gonna tell Jordan that bad things happen.
and even though the bird died and it upset her...
we have to balance sadness...
with a sense of hope and faith.
I still have faith, Frank.
even in a world where men like that exist.
so do I.
never play someone who isn't buying what you're selling.
you're thinking, "What am I selling?" What you're selling is you.
the older the better, but beware of couples. No one whispers in your mark's ear but you.
and for God's sake, make sure the person you're conning isn't conning you.
that's good. All right. Let's go kick some butt.
this taken? - No.
you sure? You've got a lot.
this is nothing. You ought to catch me during Little League season. Three boys.
any of them cute?
Simon's about your age. Though you'd never guess. He's so hyper.
I'm gonna get a soda. Want anything? - No, thanks.
Oh, honey. You dropped something.
not mine. - You sure?
you gotta be 18 to play.
looks like someone put it through the wash by accident.
yesterday's drawing. That looks like the second.
probably a loser.
Yeah.
we should at least see if it hit.
excuse me, sir. Can we borrow your paper for a sec?
we're just looking for lottery results. - Yeah, okay.
metro, isn't it? Here.
Thanks. - Yeah.
let's see. There it is. Okay, ready?
six, 18, 30, 49... - Wait. Six, 18, what?
sorry. Thirty, 49, 60.
missed by one. - Oh, you're joking!
story of my life. - Mine too.
any luck? - Four out of five. Can you believe that?
four out of five? Four out of five pays.
it does? - Sure, yeah.
call the number on the back of the ticket.
well, thanks!
well, thank you. Thank you very much. - What did they say?
we won $600!
holy shit! - Holy moly! Six hundred dollars!
couple of winners.
the woman said we just take it down for verification, and they'll mail me a check.
we should call your mom and we can all go down together.
it's okay, I'm supposed to be home. - No, no, no.
we're in this 50-50.
good girl.
watch the cameras.
that's it.
three hundred dollars.
don't spend it all at the coin-op. Hide it when you get home.
did I do good? - You did...
you did very good. Very, very, very good.
see? Mom was wrong. I didn't just get your elbows.
well, there's one last thing. - What?
I want you to give her the money back. - What?
I told you I'd teach you a con, I didn't say I'd let you get away with it.
what am I supposed to say?
judging by that last performance, I'm sure you'll think of something.
this is so...
Angela, I would not be a responsible father if I let you get away with this. Let's go!
I mean, it's strange. Two weeks ago, this was ancient history.
now, all of a sudden...
...I have a daughter!
and I'm not scared shitless. That's good, isn't it?
it's however you feel about it, Roy. - Yeah.
Yes, it's wonderful.
don't take this too literally, but you've been closing doors for a long time.
it's good to see you start opening some again.
what?
I took Angela along with me over the weekend, selling a piece.
and sometimes in my business...
...you have to create a value for something which really isn't there.
some people call it sales, but other people call it...
lying. - Right. Which is a little...
I wasn't sure how Angela would go for it, but she took to it.
like a duck to water. She even helped out.
you know, this 14-year-old girl...
...working these people with me.
working them, doc.
do you regret it? Exposing her to that? Her seeing that side of you?
well, you know, it was a little... It made me feel... I was a little...
I really liked it.
I really did. It was the best time we've had together.
right.
fabulous cup trick. - You like that?
he wants to fly the money to the Caymans. Afraid he might get robbed.
as if somebody would do that. When's his flight?
Friday. What do you think?
about the hat? It's a little Dwight Yoakam around the edges.
you're calling attention to yourself. - Chicks dig it.
so where do you think?
where do you want to do it?
there.
I'm here. He sits there.
back to the bar.
back to the bar. It's important.
otherwise, we blow it off.
okay.
who's it going to be? - Ernie.
hobo Ernie?
Yeah, homeless Ernie.
he's a little over the top, isn't he? - For 50 bucks, it's a hell of a bargain.
okay, okay.
there's only one problem. - What?
I think I'm in love with you.
we're gonna be rich. - Do not do that.
that's embarrassing. Just stop.
does it turn you on? - No, it does not turn me on. Stop.
can you...?
here you go.
Where's that cute little girl of yours? - She went home to her mom's.
summer school.
she's a cute one.
must be lonesome without her.
see you tomorrow. - Okay. Hi.
it's Kathy, right? - Yeah.
I'm Roy. - Hi, Roy.
how are you? - I'm doing all right.
Hi, Dad, it's me. I just wanted to say hi.
summer school sort of sucks. I get out at noon on Wednesday.
I'll meet you out in front if you want. Okay. Bye.
Hi, Dad, it's me. I just wanted to say hi.
pervert. - Get in the car.
what would you like to do today, little girl?
mom wants me home by dinner. - You'll be back. What would you like to do?
what?
I own you. - Oh, yeah?
we'll just have to see about that.
let me show you a little something I learned in Taiwan.
what? - Dad...
...the first thing you need to understand...
...is 90 percent of it is knocking down at least one pin.
Oh, is that right? Is that right?
not now!
you want me to bowl for you? - Yeah, I'll just be a couple of minutes.
you'll be all right? - Yeah.
all right.
this better be pretty important.
he bumped it up. - What?
we gotta do it today. - I thought it was Friday.
me too, but he changed it.
we gotta do it now. - Tell him!
what am I gonna tell him? We can't postpone it.
he's leaving for the Caymans for a month. We've gotta do it now.
there's no time. I gotta get the money, get changed, get Ernie...
I know, I know. But we got no choice.
what time is his flight?
Roy? - Shit.
your turn.
I'm sorry, I gotta take you home.
I can't do this. There's no time. I can't even take you home.
do you want me to take the bus? - No, no. Shit!
is it a job?
can I help?
get in.
I thought you kept your money in the dog.
that's just my piggy bank. All right, I want you to wait here.
Hi, safety deposit box, please. - Of course.
I'd like to access safety deposit box 366.
signature and pass code, please.
why can't I see? - Because it's secret.
then why does she get to?
can I add an access signature to my account?
certainly.
sign here and here. - Do it.
now can I get into the whatever-it-is?
no, you don't have the pass code.
when do I get that? - When I'm dead.
you wait here.
I mean it.
booth? - No! No! No booth!
so how much is in there? - I told you.
no, in there!
three hundred thousand?
five hundred thousand?
a million?
Oh, my God! How did you get that money?
I've been doing this a long time.
why aren't you...? Why don't you go live in Hawaii?
why don't you go buy Hawaii? - I don't like the outdoors.
okay, you know what to do, right? Keep real far away from us.
anything goes off, you get out of there.
hand me a gold wedding ring, sweetheart.
thank you. These still make me look old?
old and rich.
okay, you remember your cue, right?
that's your cue. Then you enter. - I know.
okay, let's do this.
and just in case, take this, will you?
stop worrying about me. I'm barely even doing anything.
I went out with her, but afterwards I was pretty toasted.
does she have any sisters? - I don't know.
Arden, you okay? - It's my back. I strained it last night.
Oh, man. I told you, you gotta do yoga. - I was doing yoga.
do you mind if I sit there? The high back helps.
not at all. - Thank you.
Oh, Lord.
how are both of you? - Fabulous. So who goes first?
I suppose ladies do. The queen before Ben Franklin.
that's 80, 000? - Yeah.
looks like a lot less than I thought. - It always does. It always does.
sorry. I had to check.
as long as you don't mind.
no, no. Do your worst.
it's been counted?
gentlemen, looks like we have a trade.
God bless America. - Land that I love.
enjoy the Caymans, and don't get too much sun.
come on, I'm 21! My ID is in my luggage!
my plane doesn't leave for 30 minutes, give...
don't touch me! You touch me, I'll break every glass in this place!
Hey, airport bartender!
hope she's not on my flight.
speaking of which, it's about that time.
so who goes first?
you do. You just get up and take your new briefcase with you.
when I leave, I'll take my new gym bag.
simple is safe. - Simple is safe.
guys.
have a safe flight. - Thank you.
take care. - Let's do it again sometime.
you have my word on that.
go with him. Walk him to the plane. - What?
walk him to the plane! - They won't let you.
then walk him to the security check. Now. Go. Now!
did you see that old chick at the bar with all the makeup?
Yeah, I saw her. - She almost died when I threw that glass.
so, what happened? You take him? The whole 80?
my dad's a smooth operator!
dad, I thought about it. We should give the money back. I'd feel better.
just kidding.
do I get a cut? - Ask Frank for his.
dad!
get out of the car, you lousy, two-bit con! Get out!
get out of the car! - What are you doing?
give me my money! Give me my money!
you stinking little runt! - Roll up the window!
give me my money, you bitch! Stinking, little...
get down! - Give me my money!
roll up the window! - You piece of shit!
goddamn it!
in this situation, it's very important to remain calm.
I'm so sorry.
which one? Which one? - The middle one! The middle one.
or this one.
that one! That one!
come on, come on! Come on!
here you go. - Can I get a receipt?
I can get you one. - Let's go!
Hurry!
you saved a receipt for a hamburger?
come on!
I understand that. - Just breathe. Breathe.
save that tax. Have a great day. Thank you.
keep the change.
we can't accept gratuity. - It's kindness.
thanks for being kind, but we're not allowed. Please, take the change.
let's go, come on!
five, 6, 7, 8... - Hurry, he's coming!
...9, 10, 11, 12... - He's coming!
are you out of your mind? - Sir! Excuse me!
you stay in the car.
what's wrong?
stay in the car!
Hi, cutie-pie.
where did you get the...? - What did you do?
I told you...
I said walk him to the plane! Did you walk him to the plane?
you can't get to the gate without a ticket!
did you see him go through security...?
my daughter was there today!
I'm not the one who pimped her...
I'm not the one who pimped her into the fucking grift!
I'm not the one who put her at risk. She put us at risk!
how? - What if he goes to the cops?
he won't. They never do. - What if he does?
then he'd have to explain what he's doing with a briefcase with $80, 000 cash in it...
...and a ticket to the Caymans, okay?
we're not on the books. We're safe.
I know we are. What about her?
angela has never been arrested. - You don't know that. You don't know that.
turn it off.
all right, let's get this over with. Tell him you're clean.
you've never been arrested, have you?
that's terrific. That's great.
that's beautiful.
here's the money. Give me a call.
Jesus Christ.
you're 14! When did you have time to get arrested?
I forgot to pay for a pack of gum once. That's it.
so they called the cops on you over a pack of gum?
and some other stuff.
I might have put up a fuss when security...
the guard was groping me.
he was grabbing at my chest. What was I supposed to do?
how long ago? - Last year.
they photographed you? They printed you?
move your leg.
I have all of August off. I was thinking I could come visit you.
we could take a trip, even.
in September is fathers' visiting day at school. It's lame, but...
Yeah, well, I'll be gone for the next couple of months.
Frank and I have some out-of-town work, so...
when do you think you'll be back? - I don't know, actually.
maybe when you get back... - Okay, look.
you're getting in the way, okay?
you know, Frank and I are partners, and he says you're gone.
so you're gone.
I thought maybe it could work out, but it can't. It doesn't.
come on. - I feel sick.
just get out of the car. Let's go. Come on. Go!
I don't want to go. - Go!
Angela, move. Get out of the car. Come on.
your mother's gonna be waiting for you. Let's go.
go!
and don't ever call me again, okay? Don't.
what's that?
what's that?!
I got it for you at the airport.
I paid for it.
why did you even call me? - I'm sorry.
why did you? - Angie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
come on. Come on back in the car. Come on. I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
you're not a bad guy, you're just not a very good one.
hello.
Hey, Roy, pick it up.
pick it up.
hello. - You all right?
Yeah, what's it look like? - You hungry?
no.
want to meet? We still got Chuck's money to split.
what time is it?
it's almost 3.
taking your pills? - Can you hold on a second?
Pygmies!
medical Group. - Yes, Dr. Klein, please.
I'm sorry. He's unavailable. Dr. Wiley is on call if you'd like me to page him for you.
that's very good, but actually, I gotta talk to Klein.
is there a way I can get ahold of him? - I'm sorry, he is gone for the weekend.
where did he go? Okay, look, look.
listen, I need a new thing of pills.
well, actually, are you at his office now?
I'm sorry, sir. The office is closed. - Shit!
sorry, my phone is dying. - Yes, sir.
if this is a medical emergency, contact your local hospital or call 911.
help me! Is there a way you can help me help you help me...
...so that I can get in his office?
don't forget to drink plenty of water with that.
excuse me, hi. - I'll be right with you, sir.
I need a refill. I don't have a prescription...
sir, please wait your turn. - I know, but this is an emergency.
buddy, ever heard of a line?
ever been dragged to the sidewalk and beaten until you pissed blood?
listen, I'm sorry, I really need... Thank you.
thank you.
I need a refill of this. - Do you have a prescription?
no, but my doctor, my shrink, gave me these, and they're samples of...
darn it! I can't remember... Prefex something.
without a prescription, there's nothing I can do.
but I have the packet, so I'm clearly allowed to have them.
I need four or five of them to cover me for the weekend.
let me see it. - Thank you.
and I am sorry, sir.
these are supplements. - What?
this packet contains supplements. - No, no, no.
my doctor gave those to me. They're Prefex.
they're supplements. - Bullshit, man! Prefex.
Supplifem. - Prefex!
aisle four, sir. - Prefex!
did you call security?
did you give me this?
Yes. - Why?
because you don't need medication. - Look at me, I'm a mess.
agreed. But you weren't a mess last week, and you weren't on...
...Prefexall then either.
I have news for you. Your neurosis is small-time.
Small-time? What are you a...? You fucking quack!
your conscience is another story.
let me ask a question. What if you had to change careers?
what, if I wasn't an antiques broker? - If you weren't a criminal.
that's an 18th century Queen Anne footstool I've had my feet on.
I've had computer programmers tell me what a nice piece it is.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm a con artist.
the difference being? - They give me their money.
nice rationalization.
I never took anybody who didn't let me out of greed or weakness.
and I never...
...used violence.
would you say then you set an example in your trade?
you bet I do.
but now you have to set an example for someone else.
how is she?
she's fine.
she went back to her mom's.
have you spoken to her?
why not?
do we have to talk about this?
why haven't you spoken?
because she hates me.
why do you think she hates you?
because...
because I screwed it up.
Oh, God. I lost my little girl.
I lost my little girl.
I'm happy to...
I went to see a lawyer.
he specializes in custody suits.
that sort of thing.
like when one parent wants to get joint custody of the child.
there are things you have to do...
...file some paperwork...
...blood tests, go before a judge.
it would only be for weekends and some holidays to start.
but I'd have to make a lot of changes.
for one thing, I'd have to stop doing what I do for a living.
honey, I'm sorry. I should have asked you first.
will you try? Please?
Yes, I'll try, honey.
I'll try.
when?
as of now.
you gotta do what you gotta do.
I'm sorry to lose you.
you don't want the 40 G's?
keep it. Consider it a parting gift.
we should part more often.
did I tell you I love you?
Yeah, I love you back.
one of these days, I'm gonna get you drunk.
I should tell your mom about this. Let her know what I'm doing.
your funeral. - I know.
but I think she should hear it from me.
what do you think?
Yeah.
okay.
I'm excited about this. - We could get a dog.
either a German shepherd or a Lab. - They're messy, aren't they?
we could train it.
name it Frank. - That's a good name.
that's nice.
for you, se? Orita. - Thank you.
let's dance.
what is it, "my house is your house"?
get back.
Hello, Roy.
Hiya, sunshine. - Go wait in your room, honey.
let her stay. She's in this as much as you are.
it's Angela, right?
your mug shot doesn't do you justice. You wanna sit down?
if you come anywhere near her... - Don't play tough. I'm in your home.
Roy, I'm sorry, man.
shut up!
how did you find me?
I didn't.
I found her in black and white.
airport security cameras, Roy, they got a nice look at her.
that was sloppy.
there were no cameras in the lounge. - No.
there were in the gift shop. In my business, it pays to have friends on the force.
your girl is in their books.
your ex-wife doesn't know well enough not to give out your address.
we only hurt the ones we love, huh?
you look white as a ghost, Roy. I don't want you to pass out...
...before you make your first payment. First let's have the money you took.
I don't have it. - Well, let's start with what you do have!
four thousand, maybe. - Where?
the dog.
stop! Let her get it. You stay here with me.
it's okay. It's okay, honey, go.
run, Angela! Run! - Run, and Daddy's dead right now!
okay, okay.
next, I get half of whatever you make from now on.
if not, I call my cop friends, and your little girl goes to juvy till she's 18.
I'm out. I'm done with this. - You're not done, Roy.
you haven't even gotten your feet wet.
Frank's not done, are you, Frank? You done, Frank?
he's not done.
Angela, no. Put the gun down.
shoot him. - Quiet, Frank.
Angela, okay. Angela. Angela.
put it down. Don't... I'll take care of this.
I want you to go. - Know how to use that?
don't make it worse! - Shoot him!
goddamn it, shoot him!
okay, okay.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God! - Oh, shit, Roy.
he ain't gonna make it.
okay, okay, okay, okay.
you know where the Seven Palms Motel is?
it's out at the 15. - Okay, get a room there.
ground floor, if you have to go out the back. Wait there for me.
what if you don't show?
take her to her mother's, and drive south and never come back.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take him to the hospital.
Angela, sweetheart.
listen to me. Frank will get you out of here, all right?
he's gonna get you out of here, and I will see you in a day or two.
everything's gonna be all right, I promise. - Dad, I was just trying to...
I know, I know. Listen to me. Listen, I know, I know.
you didn't shoot him.
do you understand? I shot him. I did.
isn't that right, Frank? - Right.
so you just sit tight, honey.
and I want you to know that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I let you down.
okay, Frank.
go, okay? - Okay.
I'm serious. - Roy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
all right. All right. - I'm really sorry.
you're okay, man.
he's okay. - Nurse Hoffman to Pediatrics.
nurse Hoffman to Pediatrics. - Good morning, Roy. How do you feel?
cold.
take it slow, will you?
I'm Detective Bishop. This is Detective Holt.
the doctor will be in in a second.
you were given a pretty close haircut the other night, Roy. Bad concussion.
you got lucky, Roy. I wish we could say the same for Chuck.
am I under arrest?
well, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and may be...
I heard it all.
Roy, where's Frank?
who? - Frank Mercer. Your partner.
we've been spending time at your places. There's not a lot we don't know.
I like your place better. Clean.
where is he?
okay, then how about this?
Where's Angela? Because she's not at...
415 Chester Ave.
her mother's near hysterical.
I shot him.
I shot Chuck.
you sure about that?
because Chuck didn't make it. We found him facedown in your driveway.
it's not good, but I'm telling you, it could still get a lot worse.
alas, the print we took off your. 38 was just a little small.
so where is she? - I wanna see my doctor.
the doctor will be here in a second. - No, my doctor, my shrink.
you let me see him, and I'll tell you everything you wanna know.
what's his number?
Hello, Roy.
Hey, doc. - Hi.
can we have a little privacy?
that's not the way it works.
don't I have doctor-patient privileges, rights, something?
Yeah, technically, he's right.
that refers to testimony based on confidential information.
there's no privilege says I gotta leave you two alone.
there is if you want what I know.
five minutes.
Roy, what happened? They told...
okay, listen. Angela is in trouble.
if I don't help her, she will go to jail.
so please help me help her. - I can't do anything illegal.
you got her into this too. - Don't transfer responsibility, Roy.
just make a phone call for me, all right? Please?
all right. - Check out...
...Seven Palms Motel in Bakersfield.
it's like a giant cricket.
and then what?
I asked you to turn the machine off, right?
tell Angela the pass code, and then you tell her to write it down.
pass code? - They'll search you on your way out.
right. - It's 543N7942.
59... - Doc!
Oh, I'm sorry.
543N7942. Say it back to me. Say it back.
so it's 543N7542.
no, N7942.
n, Norman, 7942.
that's all you have to do. - 543N7942.
thank you, doc.
she's gonna be okay.
Angela's gonna be all right.
Hey, hello?
Hey, can you guys put the air conditioning on?
it's hot.
what is it? Bishop? Bishop!
detectives, can you make it a little...
...cooler in here?
dear Roy, you're probably pretty upset. I don't blame you.
you taught me most of what I know, so I suppose I owe you better than this.
but you always told me if I ever got a shot at a big score, I should take it.
and that's what I did.
Taxi!
sorry, sorry!
sorry about the sap on the head, by the way, and for everything else.
you always said guys like us can't afford to have regrets about what we do.
that's gonna be a little harder for me, but I'll manage.
well, no, I told her I'm a psychiatrist. I can't lie, Roy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, pal!
if it makes any difference, you're the best I ever saw.
I'd never find a better partner, and now I won't have to.
I love you, man. Frank.
booth today, Mr. Waller?
P. S. Enjoy the gift.
she said you were a bad guy.
you don't seem like a bad guy.
well, I don't think you're a bad guy.
she's...
she's not here, is she?
what? - Angela.
who? What?
Roy, what are you talking about?
the baby. You were gonna have a baby.
that's why you're here?
you were pregnant.
you were pregnant! You were. You were pregnant.
I lost it.
Roy, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
excuse me one second.
Hey, boss. - Roy, another live one.
all right.
afternoon.
how you doing? - Can I help you find anything?
Yeah, I need a carpet.
for your home? - For my secretary's office.
no, it's for my apartment.
all one room of it. - Big place?
Oh, yeah. - All right, well, you have a color in mind?
I have a price in mind. Cheap.
you don't need much, you don't know what you want...
...but no price is too low. - That's about me.
you are my perfect customer. Let's dig into the remnants.
wait, wait, wait, wait. My girlfriend knows a bit better than I do what we need.
Hey, sweetie.
there she is.
I think we should go with the dark because of the dog.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fair enough. We just got a dog.
let me guess, a Lab.
german shepherd, but...
my next guess.
there's no, like...
...I don't know, special carpet that dogs like, is there?
Yeah, yeah. We call it AstroTurf.
come on, remnants are in the back of the store.
you folks just move in together?
Yeah, three weeks ago.
big step. - I kind of like this one.
Yeah, that's a nice choice. So dark you barely notice stains.
you like it?
how much is it?
well, the sticker says 75, but I can knock 20 percent off if you pay cash.
this is our living arrangement. I pay rent. She buys the carpets.
shit. - What's up?
I think I left my wallet...
Yeah, I left my wallet in the car.
do you think you could go get it? - Yeah.
I'll be right back.
thanks for not saying anything.
how long have you worked here?
a while.
so, what, you working this guy?
no.
no, no. No, I'm retired.
that was a one-time deal.
no kidding? You were...
...Good.
I had a good teacher.
teachers. - I'm surprised to see you here.
I figured you would have moved out to, I don't know, Hawaii.
I kind of got screwed on my cut. You know Frank.
you're gonna go swimming, you're gonna get wet, right?
you changed your hair.
makes you look grown-up.
I am grown-up.
you always go out dressed like this?
sometimes.
why, you gonna ground me?
sorry.
I'm sorry too...
...if it's any consolation.
you mad at me?
you didn't take it.
I gave it to you.
it's a funny way of looking at it.
well, I see things differently now.
so you like this guy?
Yeah, he's sweet to me.
I met him at a bowling alley.
we had a good time, didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
Thanks, buddy. Right there.
let me tie it off. - It's good to see you, Roy.
it's good to see you too.
don't you wanna know my name?

it all began one Tuesday after school.
I was waiting in the playground for my best friend Benke.
I didn't know then...
Bosse!
that this is going to be the strangest day in my life.
we must be late.
OK, I am ready.
come.
just wait and you'll see. -Wow .
it's different from the other kite stand that I've ever made.
really!
Benke and I are going to try out his new kite.
the one he and his father had made together.
we steped to first on the corner store to buy some crackers for aunt Edna.
plain crackers, not a salty ones.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
Hello, you two.
there you are, Bosse. -Thanks, Mrs. Lundin.
not at all, Bosse.
Bye. -Bye.
you see. I lived with aunt Edna and uncle Sixten.
because my mother died when I was born.
and no body bothered to find my father and tell him about me.
I'll be right back.
don't slam the door.
and take your boots off and wash your hands properly.
I don't want dirty marks everywhere.
aunt Edna really wanted a little girl.
but they went to the orphanage and she couldn't have.
so she had to take me instead.
did you get the crackers? Put it on the table.
don't' leave the refrigerator open.
and rinsed up the glass, Properly.
Bosse? Bosse!
why don't you answer me?
I already rinse up the glass, Aunt Edna.
Benke is waiting for me down stairs.
may I go? Please!
these are salted.
I specifically told you unsalted crackers.
but you never listen, do you?
you don't pay any attention to what you're told.
you know perfectly well your Uncle Sixten can't eat salted foods because of his heart.
and this is the thanks he gets for taking you into this home.
Bosse! Take it! Run!
stay! Easy, easy...
come on, Benke!
it's my turn.
that's right. Without the line. Little more, that's it.
I sometimes wish that Benke's father was my father, too.
I think a lot about my real father.
who he is, where he is and why I can't live with him instead I having to live with aunt and uncle Sixten.
six thirty!
and aunt Edna said I had to be home for supper at six.
I've the very latest.
Hey! Over here! Here!
Oh no!
get away!
get away!
hey you, get out from that!
go on! Get out of here!
go!
say, look who we've got here!
grab his hat!
give it back!
go take it!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here! here!
let him go.
do you realize it's twenty to seven?
how many times must I tell you to brush out all the mud before you come in?
I spend all morning clearing the floor.
and don't hang your wet jacket on top of your uncle's coat.
why you late?
I'm sorry.
what's this?
it wasn't my fault!
into the bathroom!
look at it! Completely ruined.
just wait your Uncle Sixten gets home!
now go to your room.
Yes, aunt Edna.
I don't want to see or hear you in the rest of evening.
you took him into your home, gave him a decent education and this is the thanks you get.
it's a time you spoke to the boy.
Sixten! He is nothing but trouble.
we ought never to take him in. We stock pick, now.
and that boy's evil, Sixten. I know he is.
it's a render tree.
his father was no good bum, and he is up the same way.
a bum. That's his father.
my father is not a bum!
he isn't! He isn't! He isn't!
I'll find my father, I'll find him.
then she'll see how fine he is.
just you wait! I'll find him! You'll see.
Hello, Bosse.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
wait a minute, Bosse. I was expecting you.
would you like an apple?
Yes, please.
come in.
Thanks.
Mrs. Lundin was always kind to me.
gave me sweets, some fruit, some things.
since then, I thought how wonder about her because it was in her shop that it whole really began.
would you mail this for me?
sure.
use the mail box at the end of the street.
okay.
farewell, Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
to the King of The Land of Faraway.
the one you have been seeking for so long is now on his way.
he travels by day and he travels by night, and he bears in his hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
the Land of Faraway. I wish I was there.
that's much better.
who are you?
I am the spirit from The Land of Faraway.
the Land of Faraway? Is that where you come from?
it is.
and are you going back there?
I'm .
Oh, spirit! Please take me with you to The Land of Faraway.
I'm sorry, child, I can not.
Oh, but you can. I know you can. Please.
ask anything else. But not that. That is beyond my powers.
an apple of gold? Tell me, child, what is your name?
Bosse. Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson?
and you bear your hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
you're the one I have come to fetch.
you are the one the king of The Land of Faraway has been seeking for so many years.
now grap hold my beard.
hold on tight!
flying through the garden, Garden of the roses.
and the silver poplars I can see a bird.
it is the bird of sorrow.
I hear the bird of sorrow.
singing of the long lost Land of faraway.
and my heart is trembling Then I hear my father say
Mio, my Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
where are we?
we reach The Land of Faraway.
that's green meadows island.
and that man down there is...
No! Don't tell me! I already know.
it's my father.
Yes, your father, the king of The Land of Faraway.
father.
Yes.
I knew it. I was sure I'd find you.
Mio, my Mio.
Mio? But my name is Bosse.
Mio, my son.
I have spent nine years looking for you and I missed you so.
and all the time I kept saying to myself.
Mio, my Mio.
so you see? I should know that is your name.
all that about being coop us was wrong.
I knew it. It was all wrong.
the aunt Edna, and uncle Sixten.
Yes, everything is been put right, now.
and from now on, you're going to live with me in my castle on green meadows island in The Land of Faraway.
my father took me by the hands.
and it feels so good to feel my hand in his.
aunt Edna and uncle Sixten had never done that.
I wish Aunt Edna could see him now. How wonderful he is.
it's great.
and I'm so happy to be here to found you.
Oh, that's fine.
beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
this is your horse. His name is Miramis.
my Horse?
that's right.
would you like to ride him? Come on.
bane your knee.
I don't know how to ride. Will I be able to?
Yes.
you can do anything you want, as long as you have enough courage in your heart to do it.
go on.
come on.
thank you, father. Thank you.
if only Benke could be here...
Benke?
Yes, he's my best friend.
welcome to the green meadows island.
Benke.
my name is Jum-Jum.
Jum-jum? Hi, I'm Bosse.
Bosse?
no, of course. My name is Mio.
Yes, I know.
the king sent messages through out the land with the news: Mio was come home.
Jum-Jum's father takes care of all my roses.
he is the royal gardener.
you are lucky, Mio.
Miramis is the finest horse in the whole kingdom.
would you like to ride him, too?
would I?
you're the finest, cleverest horse in the wide world.
what a wonderful horse.
Yes. His name is Miramis.
I'm Mio.
I know. I'm Jiri.
these are my two brothers and my two sisters.
is it time, yet?
no, not yet.
time for what?
you'll see.
it's very deep.
where is the bucket?
it isn't that kind of a well, it's a whispering well.
a what?
a whispering well. That's what it's called.
welcome, Prince Mio.
you know who I am?
of course. Everyone knows who you are, Mio.
I've began to realize that. But I still don't know who everyone is.
what's your name?
Nonno. And these are my sheep.
what a strange music. Please teach me how to play it.
sure.
here.
this belong to my two brothers, but they are not been needed any more.
just put the flute to your mouth and listen how the wind sings through leaves.
Nonno taught us how to play these strange tube.
and he told us that his father told him how to play it.
and his father had learned it from his father.
for thousands of thousands of years, Nonno said, the shepherds on green meadows island had been playing it.
here you are.
thank you!
Thanks.
this is the best bread I've ever tested.
we call it "breads that satisfy all hunger."
take it. You'll need it.
thank you.
no, please!
what's going on?
you'll see.
Yes.
look into the well, but in perfectly quiet.
once upon the time there lived a cruel and evil knight in the blackest and crimest castle.
he was so evil he had carried of all the children from the peaceful country where they lived.
and his guardians and spies all had hearts of the hardest stone.
and for thousands of thousands of years, the people lived in fear and terror of the evil knight.
those children who refused to serve him, he turned them to birds.
turn the circle above the Dead Lake and to the day when all the christ left his terrible castle would be a pile stones.
but one day, the king's son would ride in through moonlight
he rode to the Forest of Mysteries.
accompanied by a single friend, on a beautiful white horse.
father, where is the Forest of Mysteries?
why do you ask, Mio?
I want to ride there tonight.
so soon...
please, father. I want to.
so soon...
would you rather I didn't go?
are you worried about me riding into the Forest of Mysteries at night?
no. Why? Should I be?
a forest that sleeps peacefully in the moonlight can do no harm.
do you want me to stay here with you instead?
no, Mio. The Forest of Mysteries awaits you.
you may ride through it as long as Miramis can carry you.
but there's one thing you must know.
there is something called The Land Outside which lies beyond The Forest of Mysteries.
who lives there?
kato, the evil knight.
you are so dear to me, Mio.
but my heart, it hurt so the thought of Kato.
if your heart hurt the thought of him, then don't think of him.
you are right. I'll try not to.
and you won't be sad?
I won't.
promise.
I promise.
you go now, Mio.
go! Go!
thank you, father.
I'll come back very soon. I promise.
Jum-Jum, guess what I'm going to do tonight?
when the moon is up, I'm going to ride through The Forest of Mysteries.
at last.
Yes. Do you want to come, too?
do I want to come, too?
of course, I do. Look what I've got.
these can keep us warm.
and I've got some of the bread that satisfies all hunger.
it's the longest bridge in the world.
this is all pass your father's kingdom and the land of the other side of world, too.
are those my father's guards?
Yes.
at night, they draw the bridge so that no one can cross over onto green meadows island.
that way we can all sleep safe at night.
Why? Who lives on the other side?
kato, the evil knight from The Land Outside.
Kato!
I must ride out to the other side. Come on.
stop them!
wait!
Mio!
Oh no! Stop! Miramis!
stop!
Miramis!
that was just like fly!
I didn't know Miramis can do it.
there's still so much you don't know, Mio.
where does it lead to?
I don't know. Let's find out.
come on.
wait here, Miramis.
Mio and Jum-Jum.
what's kept you so long? Come in.
don't be afraid.
come in.
seasons have passed when I waited
the prince and his faithful companion.
why do you sit at night weaving?
I weave the fabric dreams that can only be done at night.
the abstract fairy tales, the fabric dreams, are always wove at night.
lend me have your cape, Mio. You've torn it.
why does that bird singing like that?
Why?
it's a bird of grave, singing for my child. My daughter, who is taken away.
who took her away from you? Who?
no, don't tell me. I already know.
please don't mention that dreadful name.
no, or the moon was turn black.
it was Kato. Kato.
every time I heard that awful name, I feel so frightened.
I didn't know why or what I was supposed to do.
but as I listened to the bird of grave, as I heard the way it sang.
something strange happened inside me.
Jum-Jum, I'm going to The Land Outside.
Yes, I know.
how can you?
I didn't know myself until right now.
I've know that for long you'll go to The Land Outside, Mio.
everyone knows.
everyone?
Yes. The bird of grave knows, so does Nonno.
his flute sings about it.
and Jiri and all his brothers and sisters.
and whispering well knows it, too.
everyone knows.
and my father, the king?
he's always know.
and he wants me to go?
Yes.
I'm frightened, Jum-Jum. Why me?
only a melt child of royal blood can fight the Evil Knight.
only a king's son.
farewell, Jum-Jum.
I'm going with you.
no, you can not follow me to where I'm going.
I'm going with you.
the legend says.
a malt child of royal blood riding a white horse, accompany by a single friend.
that was set for thousands of thousands of years ago.
you can't change that.
you are a true friend, Jum-Jum.
Mio, your cape.
a finest fabric which I've ever wove.
and I give it to the one who'll rescues my daughter, Millimani.
thank you.
are we ready?
Yes, we are.
and so, we set off for The Land Outside, to do battle with evil knight, Kato.
and to rescue Millimani, the weaver woman's daughter.
Nonno two brothers
Jiri's two sisters and all the other children Kato had taken away.
the Land Outside.
we've reached The Land Outside.
come on!
Kato castle.
you should have a sword.
Yes.
please help me!
what's that?
I'm so very hungry!
it might be a trap.
but what if it isn't?
help!
whoever it is, we must find him and help him.
wait here, Miramis.
don't be afraid. We won't be long.
here.
Mio! Help me, Mio!
help me!
are you all right?
Yes. Thanks.
help me!
come on.
don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
we are not going to hurt you.
we heard your cries. We heard how hungry you were.
so we brought you some bread.
take it . don't be afraid.
here.
it's... bread.
bread to satisfy all hunger.
why have you come here?
we come to fight evil knight, Kato.
shush!
go back to where you come from. Go back before it's too late!
no, I will not! I came to here to fight evil knight Kato. And I will.
shush!
don't make so much noise about it. His spies would hear you.
they might be out there, or even in here, or both of there or anywhere.
spies everywhere.
you mean Kato's spies?
hold your tongue, are you tired of life?
whatever you do, don't trust anyone. You heard?
don't go into anyone's house. Even if you think you are among friends.
you won't be. They'll betray you, they'll handed you over to him.
don't trust anyone ever!
do you understand?
not even me.
how do you know that I wasn't his spies after you?
Hey, boy?
I don't know, but I don't think you will.
maybe not.
there are still a few people left in this land who won't betray you.
and there are still a few people who can fold weapon.
you are right. We'll need a weapon.
Mio must have a sword.
what's that?
it came from over there.
how did it get here?
take it to the castle!
you said that there was still people left who can forge weapons.
go to the forge of swords, and tell him that I, Eno, sent you.
how do I find the forger of swords?
look in the deepest hole, in the blackest mountains.
go through the Dead Forest. Go now!
Jum-Jum, some thing has happened to Miramis.
let's go!
come on! Bring it back!
come on, Jum-Jum.
come on! Let's go.
Miramis.
be quiet! Or they'll catch us, too.
hold the pack!
Miramis... Miramis
don't cry, Mio.
hold it's head.
come on.
we must find the forger of swords. You need a sword.
Yes, but first we got to get through the Dead Forest.
poor Miramis.
how would we get to the forger of swords without him.
I wanted to turn back, but I was king's son, a prince.
I had to go on.
for Miramise's sake.
and for the sake of all the children Kato had taken away.
well, now we are inside the Dead Forest.
Yes, I'm wondering if we ever come out again.
it's so quiet in cripping.
wait! I heard something.
so did I.
it came from over there.
no. I think it was over there.
go!
look! Through the trees.
Kato's spies.
I do think they've seen us.
where could we hide?
it's no where!
there! Get them!
Oh, Jum-Jum, it's all over now!
after them!
don't let them get away!
take them!
take them!
where they are?
Mio, look! Here!
where could they go?
no one here!
this way!
the tree saved us. I wonder why.
perhaps it hates Kato.
it must been his evilist that killed the full trees in the forest.
I don't think the tree can ever forgive anyone for doing that.
come on. We've got to find the Forge of Swords.
look at that! The blackest mountain.
that must be it.
come on!
now we found the mountain, Jum-Jum. How do we get in?
over there!
quick!
come on!
we pass them! Go back there!
after them. They mustn't get away!
over here!
Jum-Jum!
we got them. Come on. We got them.
there's no way out here.
come on!
get quick!
they must be here somewhere!
where could they go?
over here, I saw them!
maybe we pass over them!
well, now we are inside the blackest mountains.
but will we ever find a way out of here?
the deepest hole in the blackest mountain.
that's what Eno said.
that's what the Forger of Swords lives.
Jum-Jum!
Jum-Jum!
where are you?
Mio!
Jum-Jum! Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum , are you alright?
Yes.
but now that we found each other. Which way would we go?
I don't know.
but it doesn't matter as long as we go together.
who is playing in my mountain?
a prince and his companion.
a prince from The Land of Faraway. Prince Mio.
that's who plays in your mountain.
what a clear brow. What a clear eyes.
and how beauty to see you are playing in my mountain.
I've came to ask you for a sword. Eno sent me.
why you want a sword?
I'm going to fight evil knight Kato.
death to the Evil Knight! Death to Kato!
you see those swords?
they are the finest and sharpest swords in the world!
everyone of them made by these hands. For Kato.
I fold whole Kato's swords.
then, why did you shut "Death to Kato"?
because no one hates Kato more than I do.
why are you chained to the mountain?
why don't you melt your chain on the forge and escape?
I can't! Because Kato he seals me in cave.
that is the fire hot can't melt it. And no hammer strong enough to smash it.
it isn't easy to break the chains of hatred.
why chains of hatred?
I forged the all Kato's swords.
I forged the swords that killed innocent and good.
Kato needs me. He needs my swords.
that's why he keeps me in a chain to the mountain. Day and night!
but...
there is one thing he doesn't know.
he doesn't know about this!
for the thousand years,
I've been forging a sword that could cut through the hardest stone.
finally, last night, I've finished it. Only last night.
this was not forged to kill the innocent and good people.
this was forged to kill only one person, Kato!
but why does it have to cut through stone?
because Kato has a heart of stone.
does he?
Yes.
and the Iron Claw.
he doesn't have left hand. He has an Iron Claw in his hand.
and with it, he rips out the heart of everyone he catches.
and he puts in a heart of stone like his heart of stone.
give me that sword.
you'll never need that again.
come.
you see this. The way out the mountain.
it's too narrow.
too narrow for me, but not for you.
follow the stream all the way. It lead you to the show of Dead Lake.
it's a raft there to take you across the water to Kato's castle.
good luck to you. Good luck.
soon, soon! It would be time for your last fight, Kato.
beyond your watch, Prince Mio! Be aware of the iron clone!
as soon as you see it, strike with your sword. Or it can be too late, too late, prince Mio.
we have to climb the rock. It's the only way to get inside the castle.
come on.
give me your hand.
hand me a torch, quickly.
get down!
I heard something.
just a little further.
where is the torch, quick?
the guards.
here.
there is someone down there.
I can't see anyone.
tilt the torch lower. Lower.
I told you there's no one.
I heard something.
damn bird!
poor bird.
get another torch!
maybe they'll try on the other side. Let's go out and look.
hold on the guards!
come on, Jum-Jum!
Ouch!
Mio!
Jum-Jum, give me your hands!
Ouch!
Kato.
welcome, Prince Mio.
this is the most dangerous sword I've ever seen in my castle.
it can not be used to kill the good and the innocent.
what should I do with it?
I will throw it into the Dead Lake.
for this is the most dangerous sword I've ever held.
what should I do with my two enemies?
what should I do with my enemies who have come so far to kill me?
shall I cut them with others?
shall I turn their arms into wings?
then sent them out to circle around the Dead Lake for thousands of thousands of years, screeching?
shall I rip out their hearts and replace with hearts of stone?
and have them respect voice?
I can lock them up the tower until they die of hunger.
Yes. I will lock them up the tower.
in my castle, it takes one night to die of huger.
that is how long a night, it is how terrible of hunger.
and when the night is over there will be nothing left of prince Mio and his faithful friend, but little pile of white bones.
take them.
put seven times, seven guards in the carry doors between the tower and my room.
and when the night is over,
I'll go to the tower and I'll look at their little pile of white bones.
farewell, Prince Mio. Farewell.
Miramis!
Miramis!
mi... Miramis!
Miramis!
get down there! And the other one, too.
shut as loud as you like. No one will ever hear you.
when the night is over, all there will be left of us is little pile of bones.
I didn't want to die.
I didn't want to wend up a pile of bones.
I wanted to be back on the green meadows island with my father.
now, I would never see him again, or Miramis.
I'm tired. And I'm hungry.
I've never been so hungry in all my life.
I'm hungry, too.
if only we had left some of bread that satisfies all huger.
Mio! Mio, where are you?
here!
where?
right next you.
I can't see you!
you really scared me.
what happened? Where did you hide?
it's a new lining in the cape the weaver woman made for me.
when I put it on inside out, I become invisible.
look!
if only we could open the door.
then you can slyly pass the guards on your invisible cape.
and escape back to The Land of Faraway.
and what about you, Jum-jum?
I'll have to stay here. You have only got one invisible cape.
Yes, and only one friend.
if we have to die, we should die together.
my sword!
now I can fight Kato.
but what about the locks on the door?
how would you get pass seven times seven guards posted between here and Kato's room?
my sword will cut through the locks and my cape will hide me from the guards.
and if I never return, my very last thought would be of you and my father.
good luck, Mio. Good luck.
I heard a click.
I know that's a click.
face me, Kato! Your time is come!
you have to defeat me, Prince Mio.
strike, and make sure you in it's true.
I have known for a long time this moment would come.
but remember, prince Mio.
even if you kill me, you can not destroy evil.
another Kato would rule, and another, and another...
what can you do about it? Nothing.
let me leave.
take your faithful little friend and your white horse.
and leave this place . go home, to your father.
he's waiting for you. Go home before it is too late.
Oh! No! I came here to destroy you. And I will!
and even if you kill me, another prince will come. And another, and another.
then you must die.
at last, I am free of this heart of stone.
it has crushed and smothered me so long.
the spell had been broken. They were all down there.
but there won't birds anymore. They were free.
the weaver woman's daughter,
Nonno's two brothers,
Jiri's little sister.
and all the other children Kato had taken away.
what did I say?
the time has come for Kato's last fight.
that's what I said, and I was right.
wasn't I, Prince Mio?
look, look!
it was growing! It was growing in the Dead Forest. That's where I found it.
I knew you would succeed.
father.
Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
it's a while now since I first came to The Land of Faraway.
and I wonder what Aunt Edna and Uncle Sixten said when I never came home.
they cared so little about me.
I doubted if they even noticed that I have gone.
aunt Edna probably thinks that I'm still sitting on a park bench.
but she is wrong.
she won't find me there.
because I am here, in The Land of Faraway.
together with my father.
who my love so much and who loves me so much .
that's how it is.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson is in The Land of Faraway.
and he's very, very happy with his father, the king.

it all began one Tuesday after school.
I was waiting in the playground for my best friend Benke.
I didn't know then...
Bosse!
that this is going to be the strangest day in my life.
we must be late.
OK, I am ready.
come.
just wait and you'll see. -Wow .
it's different from the other kite stand that I've ever made.
really!
Benke and I are going to try out his new kite.
the one he and his father had made together.
we steped to first on the corner store to buy some crackers for aunt Edna.
plain crackers, not a salty ones.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
Hello, you two.
there you are, Bosse. -Thanks, Mrs. Lundin.
not at all, Bosse.
Bye. -Bye.
you see. I lived with aunt Edna and uncle Sixten.
because my mother died when I was born.
and no body bothered to find my father and tell him about me.
I'll be right back.
don't slam the door.
and take your boots off and wash your hands properly.
I don't want dirty marks everywhere.
aunt Edna really wanted a little girl.
but they went to the orphanage and she couldn't have.
so she had to take me instead.
did you get the crackers? Put it on the table.
don't' leave the refrigerator open.
and rinsed up the glass, Properly.
Bosse? Bosse!
why don't you answer me?
I already rinse up the glass, Aunt Edna.
Benke is waiting for me down stairs.
may I go? Please!
these are salted.
I specifically told you unsalted crackers.
but you never listen, do you?
you don't pay any attention to what you're told.
you know perfectly well your Uncle Sixten can't eat salted foods because of his heart.
and this is the thanks he gets for taking you into this home.
Bosse! Take it! Run!
stay! Easy, easy...
come on, Benke!
it's my turn.
that's right. Without the line. Little more, that's it.
I sometimes wish that Benke's father was my father, too.
I think a lot about my real father.
who he is, where he is and why I can't live with him instead I having to live with aunt and uncle Sixten.
six thirty!
and aunt Edna said I had to be home for supper at six.
I've the very latest.
Hey! Over here! Here!
Oh no!
get away!
get away!
hey you, get out from that!
go on! Get out of here!
go!
say, look who we've got here!
grab his hat!
give it back!
go take it!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here!
let me go!
hold him!
Hey, over here! here!
let him go.
do you realize it's twenty to seven?
how many times must I tell you to brush out all the mud before you come in?
I spend all morning clearing the floor.
and don't hang your wet jacket on top of your uncle's coat.
why you late?
I'm sorry.
what's this?
it wasn't my fault!
into the bathroom!
look at it! Completely ruined.
just wait your Uncle Sixten gets home!
now go to your room.
Yes, aunt Edna.
I don't want to see or hear you in the rest of evening.
you took him into your home, gave him a decent education and this is the thanks you get.
it's a time you spoke to the boy.
Sixten! He is nothing but trouble.
we ought never to take him in. We stock pick, now.
and that boy's evil, Sixten. I know he is.
it's a render tree.
his father was no good bum, and he is up the same way.
a bum. That's his father.
my father is not a bum!
he isn't! He isn't! He isn't!
I'll find my father, I'll find him.
then she'll see how fine he is.
just you wait! I'll find him! You'll see.
Hello, Bosse.
Hi, Mrs. Lundin.
wait a minute, Bosse. I was expecting you.
would you like an apple?
Yes, please.
come in.
Thanks.
Mrs. Lundin was always kind to me.
gave me sweets, some fruit, some things.
since then, I thought how wonder about her because it was in her shop that it whole really began.
would you mail this for me?
sure.
use the mail box at the end of the street.
okay.
farewell, Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
to the King of The Land of Faraway.
the one you have been seeking for so long is now on his way.
he travels by day and he travels by night, and he bears in his hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
the Land of Faraway. I wish I was there.
that's much better.
who are you?
I am the spirit from The Land of Faraway.
the Land of Faraway? Is that where you come from?
it is.
and are you going back there?
I'm .
Oh, spirit! Please take me with you to The Land of Faraway.
I'm sorry, child, I can not.
Oh, but you can. I know you can. Please.
ask anything else. But not that. That is beyond my powers.
an apple of gold? Tell me, child, what is your name?
Bosse. Bo Vilhelm Olsson.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson?
and you bear your hand the sigh of an apple of gold.
you're the one I have come to fetch.
you are the one the king of The Land of Faraway has been seeking for so many years.
now grap hold my beard.
hold on tight!
flying through the garden, Garden of the roses.
and the silver poplars I can see a bird.
it is the bird of sorrow.
I hear the bird of sorrow.
singing of the long lost Land of faraway.
and my heart is trembling Then I hear my father say
Mio, my Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
where are we?
we reach The Land of Faraway.
that's green meadows island.
and that man down there is...
No! Don't tell me! I already know.
it's my father.
Yes, your father, the king of The Land of Faraway.
father.
Yes.
I knew it. I was sure I'd find you.
Mio, my Mio.
Mio? But my name is Bosse.
Mio, my son.
I have spent nine years looking for you and I missed you so.
and all the time I kept saying to myself.
Mio, my Mio.
so you see? I should know that is your name.
all that about being coop us was wrong.
I knew it. It was all wrong.
the aunt Edna, and uncle Sixten.
Yes, everything is been put right, now.
and from now on, you're going to live with me in my castle on green meadows island in The Land of Faraway.
my father took me by the hands.
and it feels so good to feel my hand in his.
aunt Edna and uncle Sixten had never done that.
I wish Aunt Edna could see him now. How wonderful he is.
it's great.
and I'm so happy to be here to found you.
Oh, that's fine.
beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
this is your horse. His name is Miramis.
my Horse?
that's right.
would you like to ride him? Come on.
bane your knee.
I don't know how to ride. Will I be able to?
Yes.
you can do anything you want, as long as you have enough courage in your heart to do it.
go on.
come on.
thank you, father. Thank you.
if only Benke could be here...
Benke?
Yes, he's my best friend.
welcome to the green meadows island.
Benke.
my name is Jum-Jum.
Jum-jum? Hi, I'm Bosse.
Bosse?
no, of course. My name is Mio.
Yes, I know.
the king sent messages through out the land with the news: Mio was come home.
Jum-Jum's father takes care of all my roses.
he is the royal gardener.
you are lucky, Mio.
Miramis is the finest horse in the whole kingdom.
would you like to ride him, too?
would I?
you're the finest, cleverest horse in the wide world.
what a wonderful horse.
Yes. His name is Miramis.
I'm Mio.
I know. I'm Jiri.
these are my two brothers and my two sisters.
is it time, yet?
no, not yet.
time for what?
you'll see.
it's very deep.
where is the bucket?
it isn't that kind of a well, it's a whispering well.
a what?
a whispering well. That's what it's called.
welcome, Prince Mio.
you know who I am?
of course. Everyone knows who you are, Mio.
I've began to realize that. But I still don't know who everyone is.
what's your name?
Nonno. And these are my sheep.
what a strange music. Please teach me how to play it.
sure.
here.
this belong to my two brothers, but they are not been needed any more.
just put the flute to your mouth and listen how the wind sings through leaves.
Nonno taught us how to play these strange tube.
and he told us that his father told him how to play it.
and his father had learned it from his father.
for thousands of thousands of years, Nonno said, the shepherds on green meadows island had been playing it.
here you are.
thank you!
Thanks.
this is the best bread I've ever tested.
we call it "breads that satisfy all hunger."
take it. You'll need it.
thank you.
no, please!
what's going on?
you'll see.
Yes.
look into the well, but in perfectly quiet.
once upon the time there lived a cruel and evil knight in the blackest and crimest castle.
he was so evil he had carried of all the children from the peaceful country where they lived.
and his guardians and spies all had hearts of the hardest stone.
and for thousands of thousands of years, the people lived in fear and terror of the evil knight.
those children who refused to serve him, he turned them to birds.
turn the circle above the Dead Lake and to the day when all the christ left his terrible castle would be a pile stones.
but one day, the king's son would ride in through moonlight
he rode to the Forest of Mysteries.
accompanied by a single friend, on a beautiful white horse.
father, where is the Forest of Mysteries?
why do you ask, Mio?
I want to ride there tonight.
so soon...
please, father. I want to.
so soon...
would you rather I didn't go?
are you worried about me riding into the Forest of Mysteries at night?
no. Why? Should I be?
a forest that sleeps peacefully in the moonlight can do no harm.
do you want me to stay here with you instead?
no, Mio. The Forest of Mysteries awaits you.
you may ride through it as long as Miramis can carry you.
but there's one thing you must know.
there is something called The Land Outside which lies beyond The Forest of Mysteries.
who lives there?
kato, the evil knight.
you are so dear to me, Mio.
but my heart, it hurt so the thought of Kato.
if your heart hurt the thought of him, then don't think of him.
you are right. I'll try not to.
and you won't be sad?
I won't.
promise.
I promise.
you go now, Mio.
go! Go!
thank you, father.
I'll come back very soon. I promise.
Jum-Jum, guess what I'm going to do tonight?
when the moon is up, I'm going to ride through The Forest of Mysteries.
at last.
Yes. Do you want to come, too?
do I want to come, too?
of course, I do. Look what I've got.
these can keep us warm.
and I've got some of the bread that satisfies all hunger.
it's the longest bridge in the world.
this is all pass your father's kingdom and the land of the other side of world, too.
are those my father's guards?
Yes.
at night, they draw the bridge so that no one can cross over onto green meadows island.
that way we can all sleep safe at night.
Why? Who lives on the other side?
kato, the evil knight from The Land Outside.
Kato!
I must ride out to the other side. Come on.
stop them!
wait!
Mio!
Oh no! Stop! Miramis!
stop!
Miramis!
that was just like fly!
I didn't know Miramis can do it.
there's still so much you don't know, Mio.
where does it lead to?
I don't know. Let's find out.
come on.
wait here, Miramis.
Mio and Jum-Jum.
what's kept you so long? Come in.
don't be afraid.
come in.
seasons have passed when I waited
the prince and his faithful companion.
why do you sit at night weaving?
I weave the fabric dreams that can only be done at night.
the abstract fairy tales, the fabric dreams, are always wove at night.
lend me have your cape, Mio. You've torn it.
why does that bird singing like that?
Why?
it's a bird of grave, singing for my child. My daughter, who is taken away.
who took her away from you? Who?
no, don't tell me. I already know.
please don't mention that dreadful name.
no, or the moon was turn black.
it was Kato. Kato.
every time I heard that awful name, I feel so frightened.
I didn't know why or what I was supposed to do.
but as I listened to the bird of grave, as I heard the way it sang.
something strange happened inside me.
Jum-Jum, I'm going to The Land Outside.
Yes, I know.
how can you?
I didn't know myself until right now.
I've know that for long you'll go to The Land Outside, Mio.
everyone knows.
everyone?
Yes. The bird of grave knows, so does Nonno.
his flute sings about it.
and Jiri and all his brothers and sisters.
and whispering well knows it, too.
everyone knows.
and my father, the king?
he's always know.
and he wants me to go?
Yes.
I'm frightened, Jum-Jum. Why me?
only a melt child of royal blood can fight the Evil Knight.
only a king's son.
farewell, Jum-Jum.
I'm going with you.
no, you can not follow me to where I'm going.
I'm going with you.
the legend says.
a malt child of royal blood riding a white horse, accompany by a single friend.
that was set for thousands of thousands of years ago.
you can't change that.
you are a true friend, Jum-Jum.
Mio, your cape.
a finest fabric which I've ever wove.
and I give it to the one who'll rescues my daughter, Millimani.
thank you.
are we ready?
Yes, we are.
and so, we set off for The Land Outside, to do battle with evil knight, Kato.
and to rescue Millimani, the weaver woman's daughter.
Nonno two brothers
Jiri's two sisters and all the other children Kato had taken away.
the Land Outside.
we've reached The Land Outside.
come on!
Kato castle.
you should have a sword.
Yes.
please help me!
what's that?
I'm so very hungry!
it might be a trap.
but what if it isn't?
help!
whoever it is, we must find him and help him.
wait here, Miramis.
don't be afraid. We won't be long.
here.
Mio! Help me, Mio!
help me!
are you all right?
Yes. Thanks.
help me!
come on.
don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
we are not going to hurt you.
we heard your cries. We heard how hungry you were.
so we brought you some bread.
take it . don't be afraid.
here.
it's... bread.
bread to satisfy all hunger.
why have you come here?
we come to fight evil knight, Kato.
shush!
go back to where you come from. Go back before it's too late!
no, I will not! I came to here to fight evil knight Kato. And I will.
shush!
don't make so much noise about it. His spies would hear you.
they might be out there, or even in here, or both of there or anywhere.
spies everywhere.
you mean Kato's spies?
hold your tongue, are you tired of life?
whatever you do, don't trust anyone. You heard?
don't go into anyone's house. Even if you think you are among friends.
you won't be. They'll betray you, they'll handed you over to him.
don't trust anyone ever!
do you understand?
not even me.
how do you know that I wasn't his spies after you?
Hey, boy?
I don't know, but I don't think you will.
maybe not.
there are still a few people left in this land who won't betray you.
and there are still a few people who can fold weapon.
you are right. We'll need a weapon.
Mio must have a sword.
what's that?
it came from over there.
how did it get here?
take it to the castle!
you said that there was still people left who can forge weapons.
go to the forge of swords, and tell him that I, Eno, sent you.
how do I find the forger of swords?
look in the deepest hole, in the blackest mountains.
go through the Dead Forest. Go now!
Jum-Jum, some thing has happened to Miramis.
let's go!
come on! Bring it back!
come on, Jum-Jum.
come on! Let's go.
Miramis.
be quiet! Or they'll catch us, too.
hold the pack!
Miramis... Miramis
don't cry, Mio.
hold it's head.
come on.
we must find the forger of swords. You need a sword.
Yes, but first we got to get through the Dead Forest.
poor Miramis.
how would we get to the forger of swords without him.
I wanted to turn back, but I was king's son, a prince.
I had to go on.
for Miramise's sake.
and for the sake of all the children Kato had taken away.
well, now we are inside the Dead Forest.
Yes, I'm wondering if we ever come out again.
it's so quiet in cripping.
wait! I heard something.
so did I.
it came from over there.
no. I think it was over there.
go!
look! Through the trees.
Kato's spies.
I do think they've seen us.
where could we hide?
it's no where!
there! Get them!
Oh, Jum-Jum, it's all over now!
after them!
don't let them get away!
take them!
take them!
where they are?
Mio, look! Here!
where could they go?
no one here!
this way!
the tree saved us. I wonder why.
perhaps it hates Kato.
it must been his evilist that killed the full trees in the forest.
I don't think the tree can ever forgive anyone for doing that.
come on. We've got to find the Forge of Swords.
look at that! The blackest mountain.
that must be it.
come on!
now we found the mountain, Jum-Jum. How do we get in?
over there!
quick!
come on!
we pass them! Go back there!
after them. They mustn't get away!
over here!
Jum-Jum!
we got them. Come on. We got them.
there's no way out here.
come on!
get quick!
they must be here somewhere!
where could they go?
over here, I saw them!
maybe we pass over them!
well, now we are inside the blackest mountains.
but will we ever find a way out of here?
the deepest hole in the blackest mountain.
that's what Eno said.
that's what the Forger of Swords lives.
Jum-Jum!
Jum-Jum!
where are you?
Mio!
Jum-Jum! Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum!
Mio!
Jum-Jum , are you alright?
Yes.
but now that we found each other. Which way would we go?
I don't know.
but it doesn't matter as long as we go together.
who is playing in my mountain?
a prince and his companion.
a prince from The Land of Faraway. Prince Mio.
that's who plays in your mountain.
what a clear brow. What a clear eyes.
and how beauty to see you are playing in my mountain.
I've came to ask you for a sword. Eno sent me.
why you want a sword?
I'm going to fight evil knight Kato.
death to the Evil Knight! Death to Kato!
you see those swords?
they are the finest and sharpest swords in the world!
everyone of them made by these hands. For Kato.
I fold whole Kato's swords.
then, why did you shut "Death to Kato"?
because no one hates Kato more than I do.
why are you chained to the mountain?
why don't you melt your chain on the forge and escape?
I can't! Because Kato he seals me in cave.
that is the fire hot can't melt it. And no hammer strong enough to smash it.
it isn't easy to break the chains of hatred.
why chains of hatred?
I forged the all Kato's swords.
I forged the swords that killed innocent and good.
Kato needs me. He needs my swords.
that's why he keeps me in a chain to the mountain. Day and night!
but...
there is one thing he doesn't know.
he doesn't know about this!
for the thousand years,
I've been forging a sword that could cut through the hardest stone.
finally, last night, I've finished it. Only last night.
this was not forged to kill the innocent and good people.
this was forged to kill only one person, Kato!
but why does it have to cut through stone?
because Kato has a heart of stone.
does he?
Yes.
and the Iron Claw.
he doesn't have left hand. He has an Iron Claw in his hand.
and with it, he rips out the heart of everyone he catches.
and he puts in a heart of stone like his heart of stone.
give me that sword.
you'll never need that again.
come.
you see this. The way out the mountain.
it's too narrow.
too narrow for me, but not for you.
follow the stream all the way. It lead you to the show of Dead Lake.
it's a raft there to take you across the water to Kato's castle.
good luck to you. Good luck.
soon, soon! It would be time for your last fight, Kato.
beyond your watch, Prince Mio! Be aware of the iron clone!
as soon as you see it, strike with your sword. Or it can be too late, too late, prince Mio.
we have to climb the rock. It's the only way to get inside the castle.
come on.
give me your hand.
hand me a torch, quickly.
get down!
I heard something.
just a little further.
where is the torch, quick?
the guards.
here.
there is someone down there.
I can't see anyone.
tilt the torch lower. Lower.
I told you there's no one.
I heard something.
damn bird!
poor bird.
get another torch!
maybe they'll try on the other side. Let's go out and look.
hold on the guards!
come on, Jum-Jum!
Ouch!
Mio!
Jum-Jum, give me your hands!
Ouch!
Kato.
welcome, Prince Mio.
this is the most dangerous sword I've ever seen in my castle.
it can not be used to kill the good and the innocent.
what should I do with it?
I will throw it into the Dead Lake.
for this is the most dangerous sword I've ever held.
what should I do with my two enemies?
what should I do with my enemies who have come so far to kill me?
shall I cut them with others?
shall I turn their arms into wings?
then sent them out to circle around the Dead Lake for thousands of thousands of years, screeching?
shall I rip out their hearts and replace with hearts of stone?
and have them respect voice?
I can lock them up the tower until they die of hunger.
Yes. I will lock them up the tower.
in my castle, it takes one night to die of huger.
that is how long a night, it is how terrible of hunger.
and when the night is over there will be nothing left of prince Mio and his faithful friend, but little pile of white bones.
take them.
put seven times, seven guards in the carry doors between the tower and my room.
and when the night is over,
I'll go to the tower and I'll look at their little pile of white bones.
farewell, Prince Mio. Farewell.
Miramis!
Miramis!
mi... Miramis!
Miramis!
get down there! And the other one, too.
shut as loud as you like. No one will ever hear you.
when the night is over, all there will be left of us is little pile of bones.
I didn't want to die.
I didn't want to wend up a pile of bones.
I wanted to be back on the green meadows island with my father.
now, I would never see him again, or Miramis.
I'm tired. And I'm hungry.
I've never been so hungry in all my life.
I'm hungry, too.
if only we had left some of bread that satisfies all huger.
Mio! Mio, where are you?
here!
where?
right next you.
I can't see you!
you really scared me.
what happened? Where did you hide?
it's a new lining in the cape the weaver woman made for me.
when I put it on inside out, I become invisible.
look!
if only we could open the door.
then you can slyly pass the guards on your invisible cape.
and escape back to The Land of Faraway.
and what about you, Jum-jum?
I'll have to stay here. You have only got one invisible cape.
Yes, and only one friend.
if we have to die, we should die together.
my sword!
now I can fight Kato.
but what about the locks on the door?
how would you get pass seven times seven guards posted between here and Kato's room?
my sword will cut through the locks and my cape will hide me from the guards.
and if I never return, my very last thought would be of you and my father.
good luck, Mio. Good luck.
I heard a click.
I know that's a click.
face me, Kato! Your time is come!
you have to defeat me, Prince Mio.
strike, and make sure you in it's true.
I have known for a long time this moment would come.
but remember, prince Mio.
even if you kill me, you can not destroy evil.
another Kato would rule, and another, and another...
what can you do about it? Nothing.
let me leave.
take your faithful little friend and your white horse.
and leave this place . go home, to your father.
he's waiting for you. Go home before it is too late.
Oh! No! I came here to destroy you. And I will!
and even if you kill me, another prince will come. And another, and another.
then you must die.
at last, I am free of this heart of stone.
it has crushed and smothered me so long.
the spell had been broken. They were all down there.
but there won't birds anymore. They were free.
the weaver woman's daughter,
Nonno's two brothers,
Jiri's little sister.
and all the other children Kato had taken away.
what did I say?
the time has come for Kato's last fight.
that's what I said, and I was right.
wasn't I, Prince Mio?
look, look!
it was growing! It was growing in the Dead Forest. That's where I found it.
I knew you would succeed.
father.
Mio.
Mio, my Mio.
it's a while now since I first came to The Land of Faraway.
and I wonder what Aunt Edna and Uncle Sixten said when I never came home.
they cared so little about me.
I doubted if they even noticed that I have gone.
aunt Edna probably thinks that I'm still sitting on a park bench.
but she is wrong.
she won't find me there.
because I am here, in The Land of Faraway.
together with my father.
who my love so much and who loves me so much .
that's how it is.
Bo Vilhelm Olsson is in The Land of Faraway.
and he's very, very happy with his father, the king.
du har sett Astrid Lindgrens
Mio, min Mio.
med Nicholas Pickard som Mio och Christian Bale som Jum-Jum
flying through the garden, Garden of the roses.
and the silver poplars I can see a bird.
it is the bird of sorrow.
I hear the bird of sorrow.
singing of the long lost Land of faraway.
and my heart is trembling, Then I hear my father say,
Mio, my Mio.
high above the garden, Garden of the roses
I can see a big bird Making for the sky.
it is the bird of sorrow.
singing about tomorrow.
I must leave the garden, I must go away.
and my heart is trembling, Then I hear my father say,
Mio, my Mio.
this is your chance to do something positive.
give something back.
you can help people, you can really make a different difference to people's lives.
that's what community service is all about.
there are people who think you're scum.
you have an opportunity to show them they're wrong.
Yeah, but what if they're right?
no offence. But I'm thinking some people are just born criminals.
are you looking to get stabbed?
you see my point?
it doesn't matter what you've done in the past.
doing my community service. Hey.
boring as fuck.
I'm still talking here.
I thought you'd finished.
if my lips are moving, I'm still talking.
Yeah, but you could have been yawning, or chewing.
end the call. Hang up!
my probation worker...
you all right there, weird kid?
don't be disgusting. Call you later.
I'll rip at your throat and shit down your neck.
we need to work as a team here. Hey, that's enough.
can I move to a different group?
it's not gonna work for me.
what makes you think you're better than us?
what is that accent?
is that for real?
what, are you trying to say something?
it's... That's just a noise.
are we supposed to be able to understand her?
do you understand that?
I think she likes me!?
Hey, pack it in.
it's love, man! What?
do it, man, do it. You're a prick, man, look at you.
you're a fuckin' pussy, Bruv. He's taking the piss!
Oh man, there's paint on my cap. This is bullshit.
Ooh!
I know you.
no, you don't.
yes I do. You're that runner guy.
you screwed up big time.
you noticed, yeah?
thanks for reminding me.
I'm guessing shoplifting? No?
don't act like you know me, cos you don't.
I'm just making conversation.
this is a chance to network with other young offenders.
we should be swapping tips. Brainstorming.
come on, what did you do?
a girl called me a slag so I just got into a fight.
was this on the Jeremy Kyle Show?
no, it was in Argos.
argos?
you should have got one of them little pens and jabbed it in her eye.
what about you, weird kid?
don't take this the wrong way but you look like a panty sniffer.
I'm not a panty sniffer.
I'm not a pervert.
I tried to burn someone's house down.
what did you do?
me? I was done for eating some pick 'n' mix.
bollocks.
what is going on with this weather?
how did that happen?
I mean, you've been here five minutes.
it's painting benches.
how did you screw that up?
you tell me, because I've got no idea.
what the hell was that? Oh, Jesus!
what's going on?
that's my car!
classic.
Oh, my God!
OK, so I'm a little bit freaked out.
what is that?
right, everyone inside. Move! Move.
run!
keep going.
it's locked. Open it.
come on!
what is happening?
open the door!
I'm finding the right key. Come on! Open the door.
open the fucking door!
don't speak to me like that!
I feel really weird.
that'll be the lightning.
we should be dead.
a little reassurance might be nice, you know.
you're fine. Looking good.
wanker!
did he just call me a wanker?
Hey, hello?
is everyone all right?
we could have died, you dick.
are you all right? You're acting like a freak.
maybe we should call it a day.
that's right. "Scrape it back."
what did you say?
I didn't say anything.
"she's such a chav."
what?
What?!
do we just go then? Where's the probation worker?
I think there's something wrong with him.
it's like he was having a spasm.
he was probably just faking it, to get compensation. Cheap bastard.
I don't think so.
and you'd know all about being mental.
wanker!
are we waiting for something?
probation worker.
I'm not hanging around for that dickhead.
shit.
what you did to my phone?!
man, I'm telling you I'm coming out there, I'm gonna mash you up.
good boy. Who's a little baby?
you're my little man, are you?
cutie, cutie, my little cutie.
you dirty bitch. I've been licking my bollocks.
who are you fucking winking at?
I'm going to shag that poodle next door, she's proper dirty.
mum, it's me. My key won't work.
are you going to let me in?
I need to give my relationship with Jeremy a chance.
Jeremy?! Come on.
the guy's a total dildo.
you are always making fun of people.
nothing anyone says hurts you.
not everybody's like that.
has Jezza been crying again?
come on, open the door.
I've changed the locks.
what?
you can't be serious.
if you stay, he'll leave.
where am I going to live? Mum, open the door.
your things by the garage.
I've put some money in your rucksack.
I'll call you in a few days.
mum?
mum, don't, come on.
mum! Mum!
mum!
Hey, Adam, how's tricks, how's the herpes?
all right, calm down, it's a joke.
Billy. I need a favour, mate. Can I stay and yours?
come on, it'll be a laugh.
Liz, you don't mean that.
you, you don't.
well, I don't believe you.
Yep.
no, it's OK, I'll find somewhere else.
no, no, I'm good, I'm good.
it's dead weird.
it's like I'm off my face or something.
Keith was talking to me, and he's a dog, yeah?
it's doing my head in.
get at it.
I'm telling you, I'm losing it.
all right.
why don't she want to have sex with me?
come on, sex her up.
Oh, yeah!
what if she thinks I'm shit in bed?
she's been with loads more people than I have.
maybe she's screwing around.'
Argh! What are you doing?
I'm not a slag.
what? What are you talking about?
you think I screw around?
man, you've lost it.
that's what you think, you think I'd do that to you?
man, you're a mental case. We're over. I've had enough of you.
I fucking love you.
I can't believe I gave her that ring.'
mum? It's me.
so, I just want you to know that there's no hard feelings.
I forgive you. You made your point.
point made.
so let's stop all this nonsense, OK?
so...
I'll come round, and we'll hug and you'll cry, and I'll move back in
sorted.
everybody's a winner
anyway, so, call me, yeah?
I'll be expecting your call.
OK.
# Let him stay in bed Till he's fed up # You know he can't go on # His life has felt so long # All ready to go # You know he's so lonely... #
I'm GOING TO KILL YOU
this is a joke. Did one of you do this?
don't look at me, I didn't do it.
I'll tell you who did it, it's that Banksy prick.
there's a hidden meaning.
it's like that monkey policeman with the banana and the Tesco's bag.
maybe someone wants to kill us.
why would anybody want to kill us?
right, come on you lot, let's get changed.
have you seen this? Someone's taking the piss.
Yeah, it's terrible isn't it? All this anti-social behaviour.
Oh, is he having a dig at us?
right, that's it! All of you, just give me your phones.
no one's making any more calls today. Now, come on.
are you allowed to take our phones?
what?
I'm expecting a call from my mum.
OK, take a message.
wanker.
is he allowed to take our phones?
he's probably using them to call one of those sex lines.
those sex lines will eat your credit.
call them a lot, do you?
he's out there feeling himself on our phones, naked.
masturbating.
isn't this Gary's cap?
there's blood on it.
has anyone seen him?
did you see that?
what was that?
I'm talking to you.
something's happening to me.
I'm right here!
look at me! Look at me!
can't you see me?
do you want some of this?
no, I'm good.
give it here. Come on.
for fuck's sake.
Yeah, you just relax, innit? Take it easy.
someone's just going to write something else on there tonight.
they make us do these bullshit little jobs wearing these bullshit orange jumpsuits.
they can suck my dick.
nice.
feel free to check out my tits, yeah.
she can't throw me out, she's my mum.
I'm homeless. That is so embarrassing.
you know after the storm, did any of yous feel like dead weird?
Yeah. I had a strange tingling sensation in my anus.
I should say something.
I'm just so like a freak.
what, did you feel weird?
you don't want to hear about my anus?
do you really need to ask the question?
something happened.
what's that? Squeak up.
something happened to me.
are you a virgin? Hi ho!
shut up!
what was it?
it's nothing.
would I? I think I would.
Oh, my God, I'm thinking about shagging a chav.
get a grip!
what was that for?
Jesus.
Kelly. Where do you think you're going?
Oh, shut up.
you can't just walk off whenever you feel like it.
get your hands off me, you prick.
you just keep pushing, don't you?
push, push, push. I'm sick of dealing with scum like you.
I'll report you!
and who's going to believe you, eh? You're nothing! Little bitch.
Jesus!
it's a shame more women don't commit crime. Why is that?
the way I see it, we're a girl short, man.
how's that?
there's three of us and only two of them.
it looks like one of us is going without.
and I'm not being funny, but I'm guessing you drew the short straw.
bad luck.
there was four of us.
I'm talking about getting laid. So how are we going to do this, man?
do what?
divide them up. Because the one with all the frizzy hair,
I don't see me and her getting it on.
because she's beautiful?
no, because she'd be way too much effort.
she looks high-maintenance!
you'd have to treat her really well. Pff!
but that other one.
Kelly.
whatever. A couple of Bacardi Breezers, man,
I reckon she'd be good to go.
I might need more than a couple myself, but who's counting.
Yeah, and the girls like, do they have a say in this?
a group of young people doing mindless shit all day.
face it, man, it's going to happen. It's biology.
or physics. One of those.
so do we have a deal?
no.
fine, maybe I'll take both.
Yeah, I see that happening
Yeah, you will see it and then you'll be sorry you didn't accept the deal. And then who's laughing? Me.
what did he get done for?
he said he was done for eating some Pic N' Mix.
prick.
when I was in sixth form, you came to my school.
you gave this big talk about athletics and all your medals and that.
so, I'm guessing you're not going to the Olympics.
funny.
I heard he was dealing crack.
what? I wasn't dealing crack.
no, no, no, the papers said it was steroids.
that stuff will shrivel your dick.
it wasn't steroids. I'm not a cheat.
that stuff in the papers was bullshit.
so what was it then?
I got caught with a little bit of coke. All right?
I messed up one time.
no one gets community service for possession.
if it was anyone else, they'd have got a caution.
I get 200 hours' community service and a two-year ban from athletics.
they said cos of my profile they needed to send a message.
you let yourself down.
you let the kids down.
you let your parents down.
shut the fuck up! You let the people down.
all I ever did was train. You know nothing!
I shouldn't even fucking be here.
you can't hit someone in a wheelchair.
oof.
do want to know what I got done for?
not really.
fucking lesbo scum. >
me and my mate, Chloe, were having cocktails in this bar, yeah.
and she's hassling me, cos she wants to go to this party.
Chloe is on one, because she thinks Jack is doing Lucy.
a total slut fuck.
so we get in my car. I drive us to the party.
we go into one of the rooms, yeah.
Jack's not doing Lucy, he's doing Ellie.
she is a proper slut. Chloe freaks.
I'm driving us back into town.
Chloe's all like, "Oh I feel sick."
I'm like, "Don't puke in my car, donotpuke in my car."
that's when the police pull us over.
I'm already banned from driving, so I am like, Fuck.
this cop, yeah, he hands me the breathalyser. And I'm like...
do I suck, or blow?
it's insane, I'm totally working it.
now, I don't know if this cop is gay or what, but he tells me I'm four times over the limit.
it's bullshit. I didn't even want to go to the party.
he's going to kill us. Shit.
nice entrance. Very dramatic.
the probation worker has just attacked me.
something really weird is happening.
I'm hearing these voices. It's like I can hear what people are thinking.
have you been sniffing glue?
the storm, the lightning, it's done something to us.
OK. If you can hear our thoughts, what am I thinking?
this is bullshit.
do you think it's bullshit?
of course I think it's bullshit, you don't need to be a mind reader to know that.
why are you in a wheelchair?
it was the storm.
the strange tingling sensation in my anus has spread through my body and now I can't feel my legs.
I'm serious.
Ouch. Jesus.
what do you mean the probation worker attacked you?
this does sound like complete shit.
he is out there and he chased me.
something's happened to me too.
did you pop your cherry?
Ah, we are all very happy for you.
earlier on when we were in the locker-room,
I was invisible.
I turned invisible.
so, she's psychic and you can turn invisible. That seems likely, yeah.
did anyone witness this miraculous disappearance?
you were all there.
I think we might have noticed you vanishing into thin air.
you didn't.
I was standing right there. You couldn't see me.
all right.
go on, then. Do it.
turn invisible.
Oh, my God, he's disappeared!
can't you see me?
no.
you're invisible!? You two are hilarious.
really, keep taking that medication.
don't go out there, he will kill you.
of course he will because he's such a bad ass.
don't!
I would. I would definitely shag her.
come on, this is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard.
No!
Ah!
can't you see me? >
no. >
you're invisible?!
you two are hilarious. Really, keep taking that medication.
don't! Don't go out there, he will kill you.
of course he will because he's such a bad ass.
don't!
she's telling the truth.
and you know this how? I suppose you're a psychic now too.
all this. It's already happened once.
I open the door, the probation worker, he killed you.
you were right there.
you were dead. Everything froze.
you were all just standing there. Time went backwards.
what are you saying? What, you turned back time?
it just gets better by the second.
everything happened again. Exactly the same.
I'm telling you, don't open that door.
No!
he's right.
the probation worker's gone mental.
maybe he's on crystal meth. That stuff makes you crazy.
my friend Chloe did it, she nearly shagged her brother.
and he's really ugly.
the graffiti. I'm going to kill you. He wrote it.
what did I say - I said there was a hidden meaning.
or not.
did anything happen to you?
no. We should call the police.
he took our phones, he's got all our phones.
he's stopped.
you dickhead, why did you come back here? You should have gone for help!
what do you know, bitch!
shut up, you chav.
if you call me a chav one more time,
I'll kick you so hard in the cunt your mum will feel it.
her mum will feel it - how does that work?
he tried to kill me!
I came back here towards you lot and I could have left ya.
I'm sick of every single one of you judging me. You can all fuck off!
whatever. I'm getting out of here.
fuck's sake!
is that blood?
fuck! Jesus Christ!
get it off me.
Jesus!
I did wonder what had happened to him.
he's going to kill us.
turn back time, stop this happening.
I don't know how it works.
that's great, that's really useful!
come on.
don't look at him.
I've got to have sex with you right now.
you're so beautiful.
what's up with him?
let's go, let's do it now.
get off me, you freak!
what?
you're so hot! I'm gonna bone you, I'm gonna shag you senseless!
what did I do?
you said you were going to shag her.
you were getting your chap out.
shut up!
it's when you were touching her.
I'm so hard for you.
I want to rip your clothes off and piss on your tits.
what is happening to me?
you sick bastard!
what did you do?
is he dead?
I'm no doctor but...
you see the way the back of his head's caved in like that...
I'm not a chav!
that should do it.
you killed our operation worker.
this is very, very bad.
I feel sick.
he would have killed us.
we should call the police.
it was self-defence.
Yeah. He's right. We show him the dead boy in the locker they'll do some CSI shit and figure it out.
they won't believe us.
we just tell them the truth. We stick to our story.
what's our story? They can turn invisible and that you can turn back time?
it doesn't matter what we tell them, they'll say we're lying.
they'll say we killed them both.
no one's gonna believe you, not any more.
if there's no body, there's no crime.
we should bury them under the flyover.
yeah?
how do we do that? Someone's gonna see us.
no, we give them a quick little...
put them in those wheelchairs, wheel them up there, and if anyone sees us, we're just a bunch of young offenders taking a couple of specials for a walk in the sunshine.
I'm pretty sure this breaches the terms of my ASBO.
we don't tell anyone about this, yeah?
about the storm or what it did to us or anything.
we are about to bury our probation worker, we don't need to be drawing any attention to ourselves.
I don't want anyone to know.
I cannot be a freak.
what about you?
there's no going back now, man.
you were just as screwed as the rest of us.
you are black AND famous. You are probably more screwed.
I shouldn't even be here.
just then, when he was touching yer...
how were you doing that?
I don't know.
didn't you say you wanted to piss on her tits?
probably best to keep that kind of thing between you and your internet service provider.
are you all right?
if she can hear what I'm thinking, does she know I want to shag her?
shit, she can hear that!'
hold on, all of you have some kind of special power.
everyone can do something except me.
he can do something, he can do something and I can't.
that's ridiculous, look at him!
how does that make any sense?
maybe you can do something, you just haven't found out what it is yet.
Yeah, right.
what if I can't feel pain? Ow!
did you feel that?
stop hitting me!
# God knows your lonely souls # God knows your lonely souls # God knows your lonely souls # I believe there's a time and a place # To let your mind drift and get out of this place # I believe there's a day and a place # That we will go to and I know you want to share # There's no secret to living # Just keep on walking # There's no secret to dying # I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name # I'm gonna die in a space # That don't hold my name... #
if anyone asks what happened yesterday we say nothing, right?
it's just a completely normal day.
there's nothing here.
no note, nothing, it's like he's just disappeared.
some of them are here already.
Yeah.
I'll talk to them.
Gary and my colleague, Tony, have both been reported missing.
their families are very worried about them.
have you seen anything unusual, anything at all?
you saw something?
a few days ago...
I go into the toilets, Tony and Gary were in there.
they are butt naked, Tony has very by his hair, like this, and he's just doing him, doggy style.
and Tony is like, who's your daddy? I'm your daddy, I'm Big Daddy.
you like that.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
I'm Daddy Cool!
so I'm guessing they've ran away to continue their illicit homosexual affair.
I ask you, in this world of intolerance and prejudice, who are we to condemn them?
Hi, this is Tony, leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Bye.
I think we got away with it.
do you actually believe that or are you just really dumb?
I actually believe that.
I was there. I should have one of these bullshit powers.
you can have mine. You want to hear what people are thinking about you?
not so much. I want something good, something from the A-list.
maybe you can fly.
he's not going to be able to fly.
Yeah, there's always someone that can fly. Check it out.
don't.
Ow! No, that's not it.
so what happens now? Is this it? Are we gonna be like this forever?
what if we are meant to be, like, superheroes?
you lot, superheroes?
no offence, but in what kind of fucked-up world would that be allowed to happen?
I did not sign up for that.
superheroes! I love this guy - you prick!
what if there's loads of people like us all over town?
no, that kind of thing only happens in America.
this will fade away. I'm telling you, by this time next week, it'll be back to the same old boring shit.
this time next week
you!
you want to tell us who that was?
there is something weird going on with Jeremy.
can you get me a gun?
there's no way I'm getting a dickhead like you a gun.
my mum told me to stay away from girls like you.
your mum has never met a girl like me.
let's do it on the desk.
get off me!
let's get that wind flowing through your scalp, come on.
someone knows. They know we killed our probation worker.
Hart, can you get me Miss Arizona's number?
why would l do that, Clonsky? - Because she needs a man in her life.
yeah? Where do you fit in?
nice. Nice talk. Not too congenial, Hart. - Yeah.
it says right here you're supposed to be real amiable.
that's three weeks ago. I've been amiable since then...
...and now l just wanna hit somebody.
well, this could be your chance, Hart.
okay, let's go over this one more time. The Housewives...
...they knocked off nine banks in a month and wounded two guards.
we got a tip this bank is their next target. So stay frosty. Keep your heads up.
you know you can't wear a swimsuit on this mission, right, Hart?
that's good.
what happened to world peace? - It comes and goes.
control to Big Mama.
check your baby.
Hey, honey.
control, this is Big Mama. Confirm. - Confirm, Big Mama. Proceed on in.
big Daddy and Big Mama are inside. - Copy that.
l hope we wrap this early. l have Yankee tickets tonight.
what are you up to?
just basic paperwork, and then l got company coming over for dinner...
...so l just need to do a little- - A little defrosting.
Oh, your boyfriend Eric's coming over? - He's not my boyfriend. Just
we're just friends, you know? Friends and coworkers. Friendly coworkers.
Hey, you ever been to the Poconos?
where is that? What is that, New York? Pennsylvania?
you think it'd be hard to get a reservation there?
what, for you and your coworker?
that's so sweet, two agents in love. - Yeah.
so l guess this is a good time to tell you that this is not your baby.
housewives, front door. Housewives.
how old?
thirty- five. - No, the baby. Can l take a peek?
no, get lost, lady. We haven't changed his diaper in a week.
you're that Miss Congeniality lady.
no, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
l saw you on TV on the Miss United States pageant.
no, ma'am. Ma'am, you did not.
you're Gracie Hart! - Ma'am, no. Ma'am, please
Gracie Hart! - No, I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!
she's FBI! - I'm not!
it's a setup! - Okay, nobody move! Nobody move!
nobody's moving. Ma'am, please be
please be quiet! Get down! Nobody's moving.
get down, please! Please, get down! - Down, l said. Down!
nobody's moving. It's okay. Ma'am, get down! Get down!
we've got a hostage situation. We need backup. Now!
we gotta move, ladies! - Okay. Okay, it's okay.
get your hand out of the purse, Hart.
you too, hubby, get your hands up where l can see them.
tell me where every other agent is in this bank.
now.
now!
there's one in the baby carriage.
freeze, FBI! - FBI, freeze!
put the gun down! Put the guns down!
take her. Take- - - Got her.
Clonsky, where are you hit? Where are you hit?
ln the vest. I'm- - - Where?
m all right. I'm all right.
Oh, my God. - It hurt like a mother.
l know.
but l got something that's gonna make you feel a lot better.
here we go, 602- 555- 01 99.
what's that?
miss Arizona's number.
you couldn't tell me earlier? - No.
what do we got? - I'm okay.
excuse me.
would you mind?
sorry, sir. - Let's not make a bad day worse.
sir...
...about the bank, l don't know what happened.
it was like my high school reunion, except these people liked me.
well, l think we can all agree it didn't go according to plan.
but l wanna talk to you about something else.
this is some fan mail we've gotten for you since the pageant.
letters, cards, chocolates.
I'll take the chocolates.
'dear Miss Hart, l saw you on the pageant...
...and the next night l was coming out of a party...
...when this horrible guy grabbed me in the parking lot.
so l did your SING self-defense, and he totally backed off.
I've gone through some tough times lately, and you have no idea what it means...
...to feel like you can stand up for yourself again.
l just wanted to say thank you and you look beautiful in your e- -
evening gown? - Evening gown.
she liked it? - Lori, Newark.
sir, you're reading my mail. That's a class- B misdemeanor.
Hart, I've been getting five calls a day for you to be on talk shows.
the Bureau's had some bad publicity lately...
...and the director thinks you could be the new face of the FBI.
sir, I'm just a field agent.
most field agents don't have the president calling them at home to congratulate them.
l can't believe l hung up on him. l thought it was Clonsky.
this is important, Hart. Go home, have a nice dinner...
...and think about it.
well...
...l could use a nice dinner, sir.
I'll think about it.
well, hello, Agent Matthews.
no, I'm just putting the finishing touches on your chicken potpie. Yeah.
l think I'm gonna make some man very, very happy someday.
listen, l wanna ask you something.
do you know if the Poconos are in New York or Pennsylvania?
because l cannot seem to get a clear answer on this.
because l was thinking that maybe this weekend...
...we could take a little drive down there, do a little exploring, do
why, aren't- - ?
why do you wanna talk tomorrow? l mean, aren't you gonna be here in 10 minutes?
Oh, well, l thought we were moving at kind of a normal speed. l
well, l don't need any more space. l mean
you know, it's not like l expect us to get married or anything, but l
well, what is it? l mean, is it- - ?
ls it the way l snort? l mean, because l don't have to snort.
or is it the- - ? ls it the sex? Because...
you know, l could- - l could get a manual or something.
well, no.
no, you don't have to explain.
no. No, you know what? You know what? l have to- - l have to go.
don't worry about dinner. l...
Mrs. Flammenbaum next door invited me to a surprise...
...keg party. You know what? l have to go.
okay.
Bye.
this is where the health plan kicks in. - You ain't kidding.
morning, sir. - Hey.
I'd really like to talk to you for a minute, if l could.
Hart, have you been crying?
no. No. l don't cry. l don't even have tear ducts.
Sam Fuller. Transferred in from Chicago last week...
...because of anger-management problems.
Really? She seems like such a people person.
I've been giving this a lot of thought...
...and given the fact that going out on ops has become problematic in light of...
...the bank thing...
well, l have decided to become the new face of the FBI.
l really wanna be there and support the Bureau...
...and be a positive role model for women. l feel like this is a great ti
Oh, yeah. No way you could've seen me standing there.
sorry. - You were saying?
Hey! Yo!
how about a real " sorry, " huh? - Come again?
you heard me. - This is gonna be great.
l said, how about a real " sorry " ?
you are about to feel some real pain if you don't back off.
Hey, you know what? Don't talk to me about pain, sister. l invented pain.
no, you didn't just call me sister.
l don't recall seeing a little, skinny- ass white girl at the table growing up.
Hey! First of all, thank you for calling me skinny.
second of all, what is your problem?
and third of all, you better apologize to me or
make me! - You know, l don't make trash. Come on!
come on. - Knock it off, Fuller. Take a shower.
that's right, take a shower. Walk away.
you lucky you still can walk! - You want more?
take a shower. Go on. - Come here.
that's right, go on. Keep walking.
you were saying?
Oh, a positive role model for women, sir.
l want you to talk to someone before we schedule any appearances.
someone who can help with personal-presentation issues.
clothing, makeup, so forth. He comes very highly recommended.
l just went through a makeover for the pageant.
I'm still getting hairspray off my butt.
what? It prevents the bathing suit from riding up. Thank you.
sir, l just don't wanna become FBI Barbie again.
what's your option?
you can't go in the field without putting yourself and agents in jeopardy.
that part of your life is over. - Sir, it can't be.
that's all that l know how to do. That's all that l have.
you gotta make a choice. Sit at a desk pushing papers...
...or be out there boosting the Bureau's image?
look, when you make up your mind, let me know.
Rachel, did those transfer papers for Matthews come through?
on your desk, sir.
sir, is Agent Matthews going someplace?
Miami.
he's gonna be assistant SAC. Going to the top, that boy.
sir.
sorry.
you know, I'll meet whoever you want me to meet.
good.
Oh, l hope she's not a fatty.
joel Myers, Gracie Hart.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
l can work with this.
you will be my Mona Lisa, my Sistine Chapel.
l will find the sculpture in the stone. - Slow down, da Vinci.
how do you feel about a pushup bra?
how do you feel about a genital-shocking taser gun?
I'm open to it.
okay.
are you open to new experiences, like becoming the face of the FBI?
l did the pageant, l can do this. - That was three days. This is your life.
that was teaching a dog a few new tricks.
this is teaching a dog to become a butterfly.
not that you're a dog. They generally have smoother hair.
look, just- - You know, just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
rule number one, no hitting. - What?
the face of the FBI uses her words, not her fists or a chair.
rule number two, chew with your mouth closed.
you don't know how l eat. - You have ketchup stains all over you.
how did they get there if they didn't fall from an open orifice?
l don't know. Maybe l walked under a ketchup tree.
rule number three, no snorting.
why don't you just take the list.
and l truly believe you are capable of great class and style.
and, may l say, l also recently went through a breakup.
l didn't go through a breakup.
puffy eyes, no sleep, irritable.
and some of the other agents told me about it.
but believe me, you do as l say, and you will make him regret it...
...because people care about people who care about themselves.
so it's all in here? - No, it's all in here.
america wants a star. So you have to become a star.
you have to dress and treat your friends like you're a star.
you have to treat yourself like a star. Before you
l know, l know. I'm a big star!
our next guest was the runner-up at last year's Miss United States pageant.
we found out she was actually an FBI agent...
...on a mission to thwart an attack on the pageant.
you can read about it in her new book...
...from Misdemeanors to Miss Congeniality.
here's Agent Gracie Hart.
Hi, Gracie. - Regis. Good to see you.
joy. - How are you?
what a great suit. - Thank you, and you look fabulous.
thank you. - This is not how l picture an FBI agent.
you don't look anything like J. Edgar Hoover.
Oh, really? Because this is his dress.
listen, l watched the pageant- - - l bet you did, Regis.
every year, actually. It's embarrassing.
my favorite part was the women's self-defense thing, you know?
could you give us an encore?
actually, l don't do that anymore. l have someone who does it for me.
so, if l could, I'd like to bring out a little friend of mine, Agent Sam Fuller...
...who will be helping us with the demonstration.
here she is.
so, Regis, if we could have you come over to the mat.
stand right here with Fuller in front of you.
all right, Regis, grab her. - She looks angry.
do l have to grab her? - Go ahead. She has no place else to be.
all right, ladies, if you'll please remember, the word is " SlNG. " Solar plexus...
...instep...
...nose...
...and groin. - Not the groin! No!
very nice. Thank you, Agent Fuller.
come on, Regis, let's get you up.
Thanks, Gracie. And as a special treat for knocking my husband around...
...l have a little surprise for you. l think you know these people.
here's Cheryl Frazier, Miss United States, and Stan Fields, host of the pageant.
it's you!
l love your lipstick. - You do? Stila made it for me.
they named it after me. It's called Gracie. - That makes sense.
you did something to your hair. - Just a couple of highlights.
a couple? - Okay, okay...
...Miss l'll-Never-Grow-My-Bangs-Out- Because-It'll-Make-My-Face-Too-Long.
l feel we should all be sitting under dryers.
that's what happens when best friends get together.
wish we could have invited my best friend, Roger Coleman...
...but he got hit by a Goodwill truck last week.
Really?
don't we have a commercial coming up? Please.
it's so good to see you. - It's so good to see you. l
Gracie, I'm sorry to interrupt. We have another taping.
Oh, Cheryl, Joel Myers, my stylist.
miss United States, such a joy to meet you. This is my hair assistant, Janine.
a pleasure. - And on makeup and bass guitar, Pam.
your Majesty. - And you're having a bad crown day.
excuse me, private conversation in progress.
ticktock. - Okay.
I'm sorry l haven't called in a while.
don't apologize. We'll have plenty of time to talk once I'm de-queened.
Oh, that sounds painful. - Oh, l really miss you.
and Eric. - Oh, well...
...actually Eric and l aren't Eric and l anymore.
what? Since when? - Oh, just 1 0 months.
ten months? - Yeah, l didn't wanna bother you.
you're busy, I'm busy. l didn't wanna call and say, " We broke up. " It's no big deal.
miss Hart? My daughter would love your John Hancock.
what's her name? - Lauren.
so, what happened?
Oh, l just had to end it because he was getting, you know, really clingy.
Yeah, but I'm fine. I'm good. I'm great.
we need to get to Live at 5 for a wrestling demonstration...
...then there's a cocktail party at your publisher's apartment.
l could go for a little tanning time.
you're gonna go for a little unemployment time in about two seconds.
could you be a sweetheart and get me a Starbucks?
l am dying for an iced Venti Caramel Macchiato.
get yourself a little something too.
let me tell you when I'm gonna get you an iced Venti Caramel Macchiato.
when they elect a black woman president of the Daughters of the American Revolution.
okay. And if that happens, I'd also like one of those little muffins.
where would you like it?
fuller, I'm sensing a little subtle hostility, and l think we should talk about it.
fuller, you shouldn't keep things bottled up.
Fuller! What is your problem? - The problem is, l don't like you.
why don't you quit. l let you have this job as a favor to McDonald...
...because no one outside of the canine unit would work with you...
...because of your little attitude problem. - You know what? I'm out of here.
wait. Are you still going to Starbucks?
go!
no one beats my little bro! Let's go, let's go, pay up.
come on, pay up. Come on, who's next?
let's get the bets on the table because
yeah? - ls he there?
Yeah, he's here. - Well, has he got my money?
hold on, I'll ask.
excuse me, Highlander, you owe Mr. Grant 500 bucks. You got it?
get lost.
he says he doesn't have it, Mr. Grant.
okay! Okay!
he seems to have discovered some cash, Mr. Grant.
good. All right, l got another one for you boys.
who's the mark?
this is gonna be one for your scrapbook.
thank you very much. Your name, please? - Octavia.
l was wondering if you could tell me what skin-care regimen you use.
well, l like to catch as many felons as possible.
it really gets the heart pumping, and the increased circulation helps my complexion.
there you go. Thank you very much. - Thank you.
Hey. - Hey. Your name, please?
l have to do a book report.
and l wanna do it on your book because l wanna be an agent too.
Oh, well, good for you. Thank you, Priscilla.
Hi. Your name is? - Angela.
the other kids are doing their report on Beyonce or Britney...
...but if you come to my school and talk, they'd see why being an agent is so cool...
...and stop getting on me. - l would really love to...
...but as you can see, the agency's got me pretty busy.
there you go. Thank you.
what you could do is pull your hair up once in a while. It would open up your face...
...because remember, people care about people who care about themselves.
okay. - Hi. Your name is?
lf you change your mind, it's P. S. 31 , Priscilla, Miss Gordan's class.
got it. Thank you very much. Your name, please?
James. - Wait!
you're not writing it down!
bureau training. l can retain enormous amounts of information.
P. S. 31 , Priscilla, Miss Gordan's class. See?
and don't forget the hair tip. Try some bows.
there you go. Thank you. - Nice to meet you.
and sorry to hear what happened to Miss United States.
what happened?
Cheryl Frazier was last seen outside this Las Vegas senior-citizen home...
...accompanied by longtime pageant host, Stan Fields.
the two were walking to a limo after a goodwill mission...
...visiting the residents here.
apparently, Miss United States and emcee Fields were forced into a truck...
are they hurt? Are they alive? What demands have been made?
that's all we know. You'll find out more when you get to Vegas.
the director wants you to handle publicity on this.
public sees you on TV, they'll feel reassured.
absolutely, whatever l can do to help.
get your beauty team assembled immediately. The jet leaves at 0800.
l want you to have a bodyguard out of New York. They're strapped in Vegas.
sir, why do l need a bodyguard? - Crowd control.
you're gonna be the hottest celebrity in Vegas.
assuming Wayne Newton isn't in town. - Oh, of course, sir. " Danke Schoen. "
Fuller! l want you on a plane to Vegas with Hart.
she's gonna do publicity on the Cheryl Frazier kidnapping.
not going.
did you just refuse an order? - l can't take her, sir.
I'll kill her. And I'll enjoy it.
fuller, you are this close to being gone.
nobody wants to work with you in Chicago or here.
that's fine by me. l like to work alone.
then become a lighthouse keeper. This is the FBI. We like partners.
she's a pain in the ass. She's conceited and
keep people off her. Keep her safe. You be a good bodyguard, I'll find you a partner.
you blow this, you're gone. Period.
and by the way, l loved you both on Regis.
grant. - Boys.
Mr. Grant.
let's see what you got for me.
Stan Fields and- - - Miss United States.
you know what the pageant will pay to get her back? Millions.
so you're saying we hold her for ransom? - No.
l hold her for ransom, and you get a taste.
bring her to my car.
I'm a little bit hungry.
Hey! We grabbed her.
moron, you can't handle this job. The feds will come right down on you.
don't call me a moron. l got a BA in Fine Arts, and my brother...
don't call me a moron. - You were unemployed when l found you.
you couldn't keep a job on the show in the Strip.
l made that show! It was my concept.
then suddenly they change it and tell me and Lou we're not up to their standards.
you work for me now.
Lou. - I'm there.
bring me back up!
she's yours! She's all yours! Let me up! Let me up.
just let me up. Oh, God, let me up.
next time, he lets go.
you guys are crazy!
now what?
now we do exactly what he said. We ransom her.
please be careful. My guns are in that Fendi.
thank you. Thank you.
please tell me you have tickets to see Cirque du Soleil.
I'm your bodyguard. - What?
mcdonald thinks we have a bond because of our performance on Regis...
...and TRL, Oprah, the Food Network.
Oh, hey, hey, we got some great recipes from that one. The lemon chicken? Tangy.
now, look, like all great teams, Hope and Crosby, Fred and Ginger...
...the end must come...
...so bye- bye.
let me make this simple for you, Hart. McDonald gave me a mission...
...so that plane does not take off unless we're both on it. Got it?
you might consider a Tic Tac.
please...
...we're trying to cooperate.
shut your mouth. - You can't talk to her like that.
you trying to tell me what to do? - No, I'm just the emcee.
I've heard you sing. Lucky l don't shoot you now.
okay, let's line this up.
and... - l don't have my crown.
who cares? - l care.
fine. - Thousands of women all across America care. - Give her the crown.
when in public, Miss United States always proudly wears her crown.
okay?
all right, let's go again.
one, two, action.
we've been kidnapped, and there's two men here...
...who say they're gonna kill us by Friday at midnight.
but l don't want anyone to pay them any money.
cut! - That would be giving in to terrorism...
...and I'm Miss United States...
cut! - ...and l stand for fairness and decency...
...and the American way!
l said, cut!
I'd be happy to say it if you'd like.
I've done quite a bit of theater.
l played lago in Twelfth Night.
put two more choppers up.
sir.
Gracie Hart. - Yes.
I'm Walter Collins. - Sir.
l feel as though I'm in the presence of royalty.
Oh, no, sir, I'm not queen, just runner- up.
l would like to present to you Agent Sam Fuller.
fuller. - Sir.
joel Myers, Janine and Pam. - Joel, Janine, Pam.
why don't we get you to the hotel while l give the agents a debriefing.
Oh, that's too bad. It's been months since I've had a good debriefing.
although, I'm really more of a boxers man.
okay, wrong audience.
agent Hart, Agent Fuller, this is Agent Foreman. He's your liaison.
you need anything, Jeff is your boy. - Good.
welcome to Las Vegas
when my girlfriend found out that l would be working with you, she almost died.
Yeah, she's an agent too.
she actually thought that l was gonna fall for you.
l told her- - l said, " Janet, there's no way- - " - Foreman, we talked about this.
sorry, sir. Anyway, you're obviously too old for me, so...
Oh, good, well, that's a load off.
Frazier and Fields make an appearance at a senior center for a program...
...where the elderly spend time with kids. Mr. Fields' mother is there.
I think what you're doing here...
...shows that different generations have so much to learn from each other.
I mean, I know I learned a lot from my grandmother...
...specifically, how to kill a chicken.
and even though it wasn't something I enjoyed doing...
...I'll never forget the sound of their death squawks.
but if I had to kill a chicken, I'd know how.
they finish their appearance.
head for the limo, where they're attacked and kidnapped.
we got this video from a surveillance camera.
all we have is two hooded figures, the make of the truck and a fake license plate.
we talked to the limo driver, but he says he didn't see anything. And that's it.
these are your briefing folders.
Hart, you have a press conference at your hotel at 0900 tomorrow morning.
call me if there's any questions. - Sir?
we have to find her. - I'll find her.
l know we're on a tight schedule...
...but if you guys wanna see any shows, just let me know. Janet can get us tickets.
l don't know how she does it, but she does it.
she's really great. Expert marksman. She bakes.
Oh, almost forgot. Here are your coded ID cards.
you're gonna need these to get into the Bureau. And here are your earpieces.
we're- - Thanks.
we're gonna be on frequency 1145.
sorry, that is not FBI issue.
that's a sweater that l bought for Janet for her birthday.
and that's the hat that goes with it. Argyle. She's Scottish.
look, I'm sorry. I'm just really in love.
Where's the best place for me to throw up?
well, l am thrilled for you, Jeff.
because, unlike Agent Fuller, l, too, am carbon- based.
the Venetian Hotel.
miss Hart!
what a fantastic pleasure. l am Roberto Fenice, manager of the Venetian Hotel.
Oh, hello. - Your wish is my command.
Oh, well, l wish you wouldn't kiss my watch. It's not water-resistant.
although it's more action than I've had in months, so go ahead.
miss Hart, you are delicious. - Mr. Fenice.
Hi, I'm Agent Foreman. This is Agent Sam Fuller.
Oh, my gosh! It's Gracie Hart! - You're kidding!
where? - Right there!
Gracie! Hey! Grac
Oh, my! - Fuller!
all right, down! Down!
too much, too much, too much. Fuller, Fuller.
fuller, l don't think you fully understand the concept of " too much " !
Hey, McDonald told me to keep people off you.
and l don't think grandpa's coming back. At least, not under his own power.
maybe we should've stayed at Treasure Island, huh?
you don't see that in Jersey. - It's the best.
a ships sinks, and there's all these scantily clad sailors around.
makes me wanna join the Navy. - Yeah, you are just what they're looking for.
Hey, Hart, you sure this suite is big enough for you?
l can fit my entire room inside your steam shower.
feel free to move in there.
Yeah, right. Right, let's go over this schedule for tomorrow.
Gracie? - Yes.
Gracie, there's something about Cheryl on the TV.
we just received what appears to be a ransom video...
...which was e- mailed to our studios a few hours ago from an anonymous source.
it was sent from an unknown location.
we've been kidnapped. And there's two men here...
...who say they're going to kill us by Friday at midnight...
...unless they're paid $5 million by the pageant.
once again, that's $5 million by Friday at midnight.
l can't just sit here. l have to do something. l should just see
you should do exactly what you came here to do, Hart.
press conference at 9.
limos.
limos, limos, limos.
call for you, sir. Line two. - Thank you.
Collins. - Yes, sir, hi, this is Gracie Hart.
l was looking at the visuals, and l noticed that the limousine
we talked to the limo driver. - l realize that, but
we've got something on aerial. - Don't worry about it.
get some rest. Have a nice press conference.
okay.
thank you, Janet.
Yeah, hi, is this Desert Limo Service?
Yeah, I'm trying to locate one of your drivers.
a Mr. Tom Abernathy.
Hi, is Gracie Hart there, please? l have FBI Director Wilson on the line.
we need to speak with her ASAP, please.
ls Gracie Hart here? Gracie Hart?
ls somebody calling for Gracie Hart? - Yes, ma'am.
I'm Gracie Hart.
l recognize her! Gracie Hart's here! - Yes?
it's FBI Director Wilson, ASAP. ASAP. - Director Wilson. Thank you. Hart here.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I'm on it.
thank you very much. Okay, sir, bye- bye.
would you please sign this? - Oh, sure, l
my mom loves you.
and she does not love easily. - l love you too, Gracie.
you're fabulous. - You've got such great
thank you, guys, so much for your support.
I'm here on business to talk to this man about the Miss United States kidnapping.
Mr. Abernathy? - Yeah?
what did you do?
he was driving the limousine that Cheryl Frazier and Stan Fields were in...
...the day they were kidnapped.
l wanted to know why you parked so far away from the entrance of the home.
Yeah, why would you do that? Why?
so if l could show you something...
well, it's not these. It's not my badge. Well, what do you- - ?
it's my deployment schedule...
...and if you can look where it says " tomorrow's events. "
Yeah, go ahead, read aloud. - " Nine a. m. press conference...
...at the Venetian " ? - Speak up, we cannot hear you!
he said, " 9 a. m. press conference at the Venetian " ...
...where l will be in front of channels two, four
l mean, well, everybody's invited.
and l will probably have to say that Tom Abernathy is a suspect.
why are you doing this to me?
because l wanna find my friends.
and because you are sweating in all three stress spots...
...that people routinely start sweating in before they undergo public humiliation.
l had it on Letterman.
okay, everybody, l would love to stay and chat...
...but l have to go pick out my outfit for the press conference.
Oh, what time was that again? - Nine!
thank you. Watch the news, I'll do a little shout out.
Thanks, Gracie.
Hey! Hey! Hold up! Hold up. Wait.
okay. Somebody came up to me the day before.
she offers me 200 bucks if l will park far away from the entrance at the home...
...and that's it. That's all l know, l swear. - She? What did she look like?
Oh, Miss Hart, would you mind? - Oh, I'm actually in a hurry.
ls it true you're seeing Prince William? - Oh, I'm
no, we were just talking at a book party. He's in love with me, but l hate castles.
sorry, sorry, sorry. Hey. - Let me explain something to you.
you didn't do what was on the schedule, and I'm a schedule-type person.
you missed the press conference.
l went to the Bureau because l got a tip from the limo driver...
...who said that somebody who looked like Dolly Parton...
...paid him not to park in front of the senior home.
did you hear what you just said? - Yeah.
and why did you go out without clearing it with me?
clearing it with you?
Hey, I'll bet no one's had breakfast
I'm sorry, but l don't work for you. Okay? You work for me, so
no, you didn't just say l work for you. - You work for me.
you work for me. - Shut up.
you work for me. - Shut up.
fuller, l don't have the time for this, okay?
listen, why don't we just get something
okay, look. l am the face of the Bureau.
you are here to help me be the face of the Bureau, which means that you work for me.
it's no big
look, Hart, l am your bodyguard. That means l need a body to guard!
you hit me, which means l could bring you up on charges.
lf l could just bring myself up right now.
okay, look, l don't work for you. You don't work for me.
we're a team. Get it? As in " l will kick your sorry ass if you don't listen to me " team.
lf you remember correctly, it was " skinny ass. "
and, second of all, what is your problem, Fuller?
do you honestly feel it's okay to go around harassing people and bashing their faces in?
guess what. You will never make it in this Bureau...
...if you don't start using your head. You just use
what, you start listening to me now?
stop it! Stop! Stop!
all right.
fuller, violence is not the answer to our problems, all right? It's not.
and I'm not just saying that because I'm " scared " of you. Okay?
because I'm- - What is that?!
l am calling McDonald. Where's Joel? l can't go into public like this.
Hey, how are you? Joel!
hello. - You knocked my highlights off.
what happened? - Look!
this will take an hour. - Tell me about it.
misting. - Ladies.
l really think we should call the networks and set up another press conference.
you know what? You're absolutely right. Okay.
I'm gonna go back up to the room. I'm gonna get a little spritz, a little refresh
it's her. It's her. Hold this.
we are not questioning Dolly. - It's not the real Dolly, so relax.
l know it's not. Stay away from her.
okay, I'm an adult. l can act as l please.
you leave Dolly alone! - Get your hands off me!
thank you very much. Excuse me, fake Dolly!
Hi. Hello. FBI here.
Yeah, l just would love to have a few words with you if l could.
Hi, how are you? - How you doing?
Yeah, thank you for your support. Yeah. Get off me, you stalker! Get off me!
fake Dolly!
where are you going?
fake Dolly! - Gracie!
stop! - Hart, stop!
what is it about this outfit that is making everyone so uncooperative?
blondie! No pictures. Hold on.
excuse me. l need for you to
open! Just- - - Watch it!
someone stop that fake Dolly! - Hart, stop!
stop her!
excuse me. Excuse me.
please don't make me do something that's not ladylike.
okay, FBI. l have just a few questions for you.
me first! What is the matter with you?
miss Hart! What are you doing?
miss Parton is here for a press conference to announce her new world tour.
there is no world tour, and this is not Dolly Parton.
okay, look. Look, these are absolutely
what are you- - ? what is she doing? That hurts!
why did you run? - Some crazy woman was chasing me!
excuse me, excuse me. Miss Parton, " Here You Come Again " was my wedding song.
l just love you. - Honey, let's leave Miss Parton alone.
l love that song too. That was an amazing song!
why are you on top of me?
I'm just a big fan.
it's also on CNN...
...and Al Jazeera.
l was trying to question her regarding- - - You really think you're something special.
l have got 75 people working on this case day and night...
...and they don't stack up to you, do they? - The limo driver
l want you off this case.
well, l am sorry, sir, but you don't have the authority to kick me off this case.
l could call the director, who happens to be a close, personal friend.
or l could even call the president, who invited me to dinner at his house.
and l think we know which house I'm talking about, don't we? It's white.
actually, it's eggshell, if you
l am the SAC in Las Vegas. l have authority over my territory.
and when the director sees you on national television...
...nose-tackling his favorite country-western singer, he will back me up.
now, l want the two of you on a jet back to New York today.
do you think you can handle that tiny, little task, Foreman?
of course, sir.
okay. l got you the last three seats on the flight.
Janine, Pam, you have to take the next one. Sorry.
because we're just hair and makeup? - We could go to the bar.
for five hours?
okay.
the director's gonna call me back any minute.
good. And when he does...
...you can let him know that chasing Dolly was all your dumb idea.
Oh, really? Well, let me ask you something, Chatty Cathy.
what happened to, " Team, yo. You and me in it together " ?
don't do that again. And that was before you ruined my career.
what? - Yeah.
mcdonald said that if l screwed this up, then I'm out of the Bureau. Thanks, Hart.
what are you complaining about? You're not famous.
nobody knows who you are. You're a private failure.
but you see this? You see this? Everybody knows this.
so if l screw up, I'm failure face.
well, get your failure face out of my ruined-career face...
...because right now I'm mad, and I'm pissed off and mad, so
Oh, okay, hold on. So you're double mad?
well, if you're double mad, then l am mad, mad, mad. All right? Top that one.
back off! - You gotta stop hitting me...
...because every time you do, it wrinkles!
ladies, ladies!
calm down. Sit down. Sit down. I'm gonna separate the two of you.
mad, mad, mad, mad. Four.
l can still shoot her from here.
you have to lean over me to get to her.
now, let's calm down and try to focus on the positive. We have our health.
you'll be getting frequent-flyer miles. - Foreman, what did you just say?
frequent-flyer miles. It's a great way to get upgrades.
no, you said that she
you said that she would have to lean over you to get to me.
look at what the kidnappers are doing.
this guy is leaning over Cheryl to get to Stan.
why would they do that if they were after Cheryl?
okay, and look at this. Look at this. They're not even touching her.
no, she's just stuck in there, like a little Cheryl sandwich. She's- - She's
Oh, my God. She is grabbing them. l taught her that wristlock.
she's not defending herself. She's- - - She's defending Stan.
maybe they weren't after Cheryl. Maybe they were after Stan.
the man can't sing, but is that a crime?
that's what we're gonna find out. - Hey, look, they're boarding.
let it go, Hart. - Oh, Fuller, come on.
wake up and smell the iced Venti Caramel Macchiato. You know I'm onto something.
okay. Tell Collins. - We have issues. He won't listen to me.
and you think l am? - Yes. Yes, l do.
you know, you don't get your miles unless you're actually on the flight, so come on.
you're on your own, Hart. - No, I'm not.
because even though you refuse to dress up or separate those eyebrows...
...you cannot deny that you have a style.
gray suit, white shirt, masculine shoes. You are an FBI agent.
and that is all that you have.
and like you said, if you go back there now, you are out of the Bureau.
now boarding all rows on flight 624 to New York.
fuller, l am begging you.
do you have any idea how painful this is for me?
usually, they give an epidural for this kind of agony.
fuller, please, just... Just, please.
Hart, you better be right, or l swear
you're gonna kick my skinny white ass and break my face. l know.
l already paid for the seats, and l don't get reimbursed unless you're on the flight.
I'm letting you spend the night because l wanna keep my eyes on you.
tomorrow, you guys are on a flight. - Okay, as soon as we go to the home.
whose home? - Where Stan Fields' mother lives.
she was the last person to see him. Maybe she knows something.
you're supposed to be in New York. You're famous. Everyone there will recognize you.
not to worry. Joel will come up with something to make us blend.
he's a born blender. - l don't believe this.
you guys are lucky that Janet had to work late...
...because if she was here, she would not put up with any of this.
now, Janet- - Janet runs a tight ship.
l love shopping in Vegas. Where else can you find a 24- hour wiggery? Well, to work.
Hey, hey! That's my room! Hey!
Hey!
l never would have suspected. - What?
you as a dainty- travel- pillow type.
it's hypoallergenic. - Oh, really?
and what are you allergic to? - Besides you?
shellfish, cats, dogs, any type of animal dander...
...dairy products, dust
you should be in a plastic bubble. - Plastic.
that explains it. - Explains what?
why you're so angry. - I'm not angry, I'm allergic.
all l was saying was that it just, you know...
...couldn't have been easy being a kid sick like that all the time.
l mean, not being able to have a dog or a cat or ice cream or dust.
it wasn't bad.
Really? - l got to hang out with my dad a lot.
he was a sportswriter, so we got to watch all the games on TV together...
...and he taught me how to box.
taught me how to take care of myself.
well, I'm sure he was very proud of you.
was?
Yeah, l read on your file that he died before you became an agent.
you read my file? - l had to make sure you weren't crazy.
Yeah. Turns out you can't trust a file. - Yeah, well, l guess you can't.
l thought l would've liked a tough tomboy from Jersey whose mom was an agent.
you read my file? - Worse.
your book.
had to make sure you weren't crazy.
turns out you can't trust a book.
Yeah, they brought in this writer...
...who managed to turn the entire story into some fairy tale.
in the first draft, he made it sound like my mother died...
...single-handedly saving the country, when all it was just, you know, a
it was just a drug bust gone bad.
sorry.
sorry about your dad.
but I'm mostly sorry you had to read that book.
l like the pictures, though.
Oh, really?
Yeah, especially that one with that guy. What was his name?
which one?
the agent, the one that was in the pageant with you.
Yeah. He was hot.
l guess.
happy valentine's day.
Oh, happy valentine's day.
so, fratelli's tonight?
Hello, cannoli canoe.
Jay: I like it. Nice fit.
swanky material.
Jay, you look so strong and sexy,
like an olympic wrestler but with money.
your turn.
okay.
it's my favorite day in america!
happy valentine's day, gorgeous.
they're huge!
Oh, my god!
Yeah, those will work.
beautiful.
you can wear them tonight.
I have a surprise.
don't tell me, you're finally taking me salsa dancing!
and who's david brenner?
only a vegas legend.
is he a magician?
cause I love magicians.
he's a comedian.
a comedian.
it's valentine's day.
I thought we were going salsa dancing,
not to watch a comedian.
you're gonna love him.
trust me. The guy's hilarious!
okay. Tell me one of his jokes.
well, he doesn't do jokes.
does he have a mallet?
no.
so, then, how does he get hit in the head?
he doesn't get "hit in the head.
he -- he makes observations
he tells the truth in a funny way.
come on, he's been on "johnny carson" a hundred times.
who the hell is johnny carson?
Oh, for god's sake.
Gloria and I are from different generations,
and I won't lie -- it isn't always easy.
I mean, last week she thought simon and garfunkel
were my lawyers.
no, I didn't.
it was a joke.
I don't get it.
maybe that's because there's no mallet.
Yeah, I wish I had a mallet right now.
mitchell: Just stay in northern cal
did you indicate to her...
...how long that you were gonna take?
happy valentine's day.
happy valentine's day.
happy valentine's day, daddy.
happy valentine's day, lily.
notice anything different?
Oh, that is cute. "cute"?
we spent a lot of time on this.
I don't see how. You just cut up one of your boas.
actually, no, we repurposed it.
it was sort of a "bob mackie meets martha stewart" project.
okay, well, we just thought it would be a nice surprise.
well, it's hardly a surprise.
I mean, you dress her up for every holiday.
I was giving her a bath last night,
and I still saw traces of martin luther king behind her ear.
all right, not in the spirit. We get it.
no, I'm s-- I'm sorry. No, it's adorable.
I just -- I'm really nervous about my closing argument.
Oh, you've been rehearsing for weeks.
you're gonna be great.
let's hope so.
Hey, and I was wondering
since you're gonna be in court all day...
Yeahyou can open the chocolates.
score!
Hi, dylan.
happy valentine's day, mrs. Dunphy.
Oh! Dylan, thank you. That is so sweet.
you know, all women should look as tasty as you
when they're old.
huh. Conflicted.
Hey, baby!
Hey. Take this sweet gift as a token of my affection,
my unending love and admiration.
Oh, my god! Yay, it's big!
it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!
a black light on it.
it'll blow your mind.
Wow. Dylan, I didn't know you could paint.
Oh, I didn't.
I just took a photo,
and I put it through this program
that turns it into a painting.
so you two a-actually did...
that.
Yeah. Okay.
let's go put this over my bed.
no. No, no.
at all.
I'll take it.
Phil: Did he trump me?
D-money.
you tell me.
he made a painting out of a photograph one time.
I have handpicked a card,
drawn a heart in the steam on the medicine cabinet,
a family-style italian restaurant,
for 17 years in a row.
Yeah, he got me. He got me.
Bye, honey.
see you later.
see you later.
Phil, what is that?
you know, we don't have to go to fratelli's tonight.
okay, what do you have in mind?
well, I thought you might enjoy a night at a hotel.
I would.
but would you and the kids be okay?
I meant together.
I know.
Oh. I know. I know.
I got it.
so...
what do you think?
I think you're not getting any sleep tonight.
so you might want to take a nap at work today.
I always do.
sweetie.
as long as we're talking about being a little bit...
naughty,
what would you say to a little...
role playing?
role playing?
I'm in.
I'll set up sleepovers for the kids.
and I'll swing by after work to pick you up.
no, no.
why don't you meet me in the hotel bar
and see if you can pick me up there?
careful, lady, you're gonna wake up a sexy sleeping giant.
perhaps I'll be reginald appleby.
an english gentleman in town for a polo match.
or honorable businessman from hong kong
you're kinda wrecking it.
Oh.
it's not a big deal, claire.
I just train tigers for a living.
too -- no?
no.
are these rose petals?
Yes, to commemorate our love.
I had to settle.
well, your mom might think so,
but a lot of people think I'm a catch.
no, the case.
I-I was this close to nailing it,
and then my client gets scared and settles.
I'm sorry.
maybe you'd like a chocolate.
notice that I have not eaten any of the chocolates.
there were two levels. You know it, and I know it.
this is so frustrating.
I had one of the greatest closing arguments of all time
all about the big government rolling over the little guy.
and I even had this great moment at the end
where I would point to the state seal
and I'd say,"shame!
Oh, that's what you were doing in the shower.
I was a little worried.
um, that's manny.
I said we would watch him tonight. I hope you don't mind.
I didn't know you were gonna be going through all this. No, it's fine.
it might be nice to have him around.
he always makes me laugh.
Hi, manny!
the universe is cold and loveless.
Uh-oh. Bad valentine's day?
I went for the gold
Fiona gunderson.
I poured my heart and soul into a poem,
left it on her desk.
I even burned the edges to make it look fancy.
and she didn't like it?
Oh, she loved it.
but this kid durkas told her he wrote it.
well, manny, why didn't you justell her the truth?
she was already gone.
and she's on a date with him at my favorite restaurant,
great shakes.
how do you know all this?
I invited her in the poem.
right after the line of, "my love is deeper than the great lakes.
okay, well, this is unacceptable.
Oh, here we go. No, it's not that big of a deal.
this is what we're gonna do.
we're gonna shoot over to great shakes,
we're gonna get a table,
Manny can reclaim the love of his life.
you and I can get a couple mudslides.
I don't know.
durkas is gonna be there.
I've seen the kid do a pull-up.
Hey, manny, it's valentine's day.
it's not the day you run away from love.
it's the day you track it down, tie it up, and take it home.
now, if we can pull this off,
you and your little lady friend will be belly up
to an ice-cream counter,
having a milkshake with two straws.
what do you say?
I like it.
david brenner: Thank you. Thank you.
scientists, they don't know why this is true,
but it's true.
women with big rear ends live longer.
men who tell them that, don't.
did you read about this man
the 91-year-old bank robber in texas?
he goes into a bank, you know.
what the hell did I want?
they had over 4, 000 photos of him escaping from the bank.
see?
he's funny, huh?
mind if I join you?
I'm clive. Clive bixby.
Yes, I can see that.
I'm juliana.
so, clive, are you in town for a convention, or do you...
just forget your name a lot?
pretty kitty has nails.
I like that.
I'm in town for a trade show.
I design high-end electroacoustic transducers.
wow, that is very...
specific.
it's a fancy of way of saying I get things to make noise.
hmm. Two, please.
so, what's your story?
the miss america pageant in town?
well, you're pretty smooth talker, clive.
I'm pretty smooth all over.
sir, there's no smoking in here.
Oh, that's fine. I'm not actually a smok
you're quite the boy scout, clive.
tell me, would you be interested
in earning a merit badge tonight?
do you know anything about tying knots?
I probably shouldn't be talking to you.
I'm a married man.
well, I just so happen to like married men.
tell me about your wife.
well, she's beautiful, of course.
Really? Well, if she's so very beautiful,
why are you here with me?
because she's always so tired,
and she's always making lists of things for me to do.
maybe if you did them, she wouldn't be so tired.
Oh, no, she can make lists for days.
but back to your mouth and how sexy it is.
Unh-unh.
I want to go back to these alleged lists
and your nagging wife.
I-I'm not talking about you.
I didn't mean that. Can we try this again?
Yeah.
so, if your wife is so beautiful,
why are you here with me?
because...
I respect her too much
to do to her what I'm going... To do to you?
Oh, jackpot.
I'll be right back, clive.
do you have eyes on her? Is she here?
2: 00 -- the blonde at the back table.
Yep. Have a visual.
mitchell: Let's not talk like that anymore.
over.
ay, this is it.
I'm off to win the heart of my beloved.
well, this is nice.
I mean, if we can't have our own valentine's day,
it's nice that we can give somebody else one.
all right, cam... I'm sorry.
I'm so-- I'm sorry I have not been attentive.
I've been spending the last five months
pouring my core beliefs into the greatest speech
that I will ever write,
and then that moment gets taken away.
Hey, buddy, how'd it go?
I can't do it. Not while durkas is there.
he has the natural confidence.
I admire it and fear it.
we will deal with him directly. We need a plan.
could you be more dramatic?
we need a plan!
in oregon, the state legislature ratified a bill
that from now on
it is a crime to have sex in oregon with a farm animal.
how ugly are the women in oregon?
he's funny, jay.
I know. See?
I can tell -- you're not -- you're not from oregon. No, no.
you -- you are gorgeous. Thank you.
thank you for bringing your father to the show.
I'm -- I'm her husband, dave.
no kidding? Yeah.
what's it like to be married
to someone who was there when the bible was written?
what was it called then, just "the testament"?
that's -- that's good stuff.
Oh, now he's trying to turn out the light.
uh, yes, hello. Mr. Durkas?
yeah?
uh, yeah, this is don jolly
with the great shakes corporate office,
and I have good news for you.
you have been selected to take part in a random survey
that you could win cash and prizes.
does that sound like something you'd be interested in?
Yeah. Sure.
okay, just a few simple questions for you.
would you please rank your favorite ice creams
at great shakes from least favorite to favorite?
I don't know them by heart.
there should be a menu right there to your right.
to your right.
Mm-hmm. There you go.
Oh. Hi, manny.
Hi, fiona. Can I join you?
I guess so.
and you don't have to worry about him cheating
that's for sure
because if he does, you'll catch him
when he comes home with two sets of teeth in his mouth.
Yeah.
so, tell me, on the wedding night, what did he do?
did he say he wanted to change into something comfortable
and go into a coma?
Ah, ah...
listen, I got to use the men's room. No.
I got to use -- I'll be right back.
where you going? Wait a minute.
I'm only joking. That's what I do.
you know, you're way younger than I am.
you just don't look it.
I have a little something for you.
what is it?
my dress.
Oh...
my bra.
Oh, my g
my underwear.
my god. Yeah.
what do you say we take this upstairs?
this is so much better than cheesy garlic bread.
Durkas: Chocolate.
Uh-huh. Go on. Vanilla.
I'm taking copious notes.
keep going, mr. Durkas.
so, why would ted say he wrote the poem if he didn't?
maybe because you're the cutest girl in school
and you have a laugh that makes science lab seem like recess.
would you be more or less inclined
to visit a great shakes establishment
if you knew your satisfaction was guaranteed?
that's a dumb question.
excuse me, it is not a dumb question, mister
tarnation. He hung up.
then you can drop the accent.
Delgado. What are you doing here?
discussing poetry.
maybe you'll like to recite some of yours?
I'm not gonna recite anything.
just admit -- you didn't write the poem.
I don't know what he's talking about.
get out of here before you get your butt kicked.
I'm going over there. No, I got this.
Whoa! Whoa! Sir. Sir?
turn around. Sir...
you have no right
to claim oership of another person's work.
who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
you have a lawyer?
it is one thing to lie,
but then to bully this young man
it's unforgivable.
and this is wh wrong with the world today.
the big guy...
until the little guy says "enough.
and that what this little guy's doing,
right here, right now.
could we stop calling me "little guy"?
I'm in the 40th percentile.
shh, I got this. Okay, thank you.
clearly did not write that poem.
I know it. He knows it.
deep down in your heart, fiona...
...you know it, too.
shame!
fine! Whatever.
I stole the stupid poem! Fiona: You did?
I told you.
there you go.
I only did it because...
I had the feelings.
I just didn't know how to show them.
Fiona: Really?
that's the sweetest thing anyone's ever done for me.

Ooh, a twist.

Oh, I don't think -- no, no, no, no, I got it.

Oh, jay, papi.

he's just being funny.
because he points out the truth.
those people were laughing because they saw it, too.
what do you care what they think?
I don't.
I care what you think.
I love you. You're my valentine.
Yeah, for now.
but what about when I'm 80
and I' a wheelchair, on oxygen?
you still gonna want me?
do you think I'm so shallow
that I'm gonna leave you when you're old?
what if I gain 100 pounds? You gonna leave me then?
No!
what's with the pause?!
well, it's not exactly fair.
I mean, I have to get old. You don't have to get fat.
if I want to get fat, I get fat.
okay, fine. And if you do, I'll be there. You'll see.
Oh, yeah, watch me. Watch me how I get fat!
I can get fat.
and I'll be there.
good.
you want to go back in? No.
I got a better idea.
let's go salsa dancing.
this guy's not that funny.
perfect.
we're good! We're good!
I talked to maintenance.
they're -- they're coming, so go on ahead.
Oh. phil: See you guys.
see you later. See you at school?
good to see you guys.
maintenance is gonna take care of it.
so we're fine. Okay.
okay, how long till they get here?
I was faking it. No one's coming for us.
well, then, go and get them!
Hurry! That was the most embarrassing moment of my life!
stand by.
Phil: Hey.
what, did you get your belt stuck?
I did. Yeah. Yeah.
well, take your coat off. Here, let me help you.
no, no, dad, dad...
come on, what are you, naked under there?
Oh, geez.
it's okay.
I got this.
O...Kay.
Claire, follow my lead, okay? Claire: Okay.

Claire: Wow. Okay.
thank you.
it has happened to me before.
that was impressive.
take it down a notch,"clive.

Claire: Yeah, I'm good.
all right. Happy valentine's day.
Claire: Happy valentine's day.
see ya. Bye. Good night.
Oh.
sorry.
see you guys.
Phil: Hey. I just wanted to tell you how great you were last night. Hi, honey.
uh, phil...
sorry I got the, um, the oil everywhere, but, hey...
sweetie
they're not our sheets, right?
honey, honey, remember when the salesman told us
that the sienna was built with the whole fami in mind? Yeah.
well, the whole family just heard that.
uh, well, I guess...
I guessthe bluetooth works.
Mm.
why did you have oil?
because, buddy, we were making french fri!
in your room?
mom. The dog again.
I know papi. I want to strangle that crazy old thing.
just ignore it.
it's easy for you to ignore because you have the old-man hearing.
but Manny and I... We have the young ears.
I don't get how one dog keeps you awake when you grew up sleeping through cockfights and revolutions.
Mm-hmm. Very funny, Jay.
Manny hasn't been able to sleep in weeks.
it's screwing his brain for school.
and it doesn't stop.
it goes on and on and on and on and on and on - and on and on and on. - Yes! That could be annoying.
that's it. I'm going over there.
Gloria, now, don't go starting something because whenever you do, I'm the one that...
that she couldn't hear.
they're gone. Cam.
all the children are gone.
what children?
I was running in the park, and I noticed that none of the kids
Lily usually plays with were there.
well, it's still early. - But then I ran into Lori.
boobs Lori or adult-braces Lori?
Great-shoes Lori. - Oh, I like her.
and she said that they all sent their kids to preschool.
What?! We agreed to wait till next year.
it was a fake-out to make sure that their kids got a spot.
those skinny bitches.
we have got to get her into school, Cameron, or else she's gonna fall behind.
don't you think I know that?
this is perfect.
Oh, leave it to the gays to raise the only underachieving Asian in America.
okay, here you go.
guys, breakfast.
guys. Phil. Hello.
totally with you.
kids, put your dishes in the dishwasher.
okay, no. That's it.
everybody, gadgets down now!
why are you freaking out?
because you're all so involved with your little gizmos, nobody is even talking.
families are supposed to talk.
what are you doing that's so important?
Oh, I'm locking in my fantasy roster.
I'm unbeatable.
we're totally getting an aboveground pool.
die, stupid, die!
Luke, I told you to put that down now.
come on, buddy.
one second. I'm about to beat dad's record.
you heard your mother.
what is so funny?
nothing.
mom's insane." Thank you, Haley.
at least we talk.
hello.
Hey, it's me. What's a good preschool?
uh, well, our kids went to Wagon Wheel.
and it was good? You liked it?
Oh, well, you know my kids are middle-management material at best.
didn't want to waste a lot of money...
Yes, Mitchell, it's good.
why the interest?
I just realized that all of Lily's friends are going to school this year, and now she's late.
don't worry. She can wait another year.
just buy her a Blackberry, that's all she's gonna want to do anyway.
what did she say?
she says to buy her a Blackberry.
Lily doesn't have the dexterity for that, Claire!
what is happening?
can you just check with your school and see if maybe you can get us in?
hmm. I... I can probably get you an interview.
Oh, no. That's great. That's great.
thank you. I really appreciate it.
Oh, and, by the way, what do you think of that place Billingsley Academy?
Ooh. Billingsley. Very hoity-toity.
you can't get in there unless you're really rich or you know somebody on the board.
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.
Mitch, it's preschool. Don't overthink it.
my kids didn't go to Billingsley, and they are fine.
I have to go.
that's awesome.
buenos das. - Hi.
we haven't formally met.
I'm Gloria Pritchett from next door.
Larry Paulson. Yeah, I've seen you. - Mm.
lucky guy.
wait a minute, then tell me.
your dog doesn't stop barking.
all morning, all night.
he wakes my son up, and he needs his sleep.
it's not my dog. It's my soon-to-be ex-wife's.
she moved out three weeks ago.
is she coming back for it?
not unless it starts crapping money.
well, you need to do something about the dog.
the dog is old and stupid.
who are you really mad at, Larry?
the dog or your wife?
who the hell is this kid?
Hey, there's no need for that.
I'll tell you who he is.
his name is "shut up your damn dog"!
you know what's ironic?
you come over here complaining, and I have never once said a word about that obnoxious parrot of yours that's always squawking.
parrot?
what parrot?
what is he talking about? What parrot?
how the hell do I know?
so, what do we do now?
nothing. We did it. He heard us.
he didn't hear nothing.
Jay, don't go. Jay!
okay, we have called this family meeting because the personal electronics have gotten out of control.
starting today, there's going to be a one-week ban - on all cellphones, texting, - Oh!
IM'ing, video chatting, video-gaming, - anything on the Internet. - How am I supposed to do my homework?
the way I did.
with a chisel and a piece of stone.
Phil. - Can't unplug my funny bone.
I have a huge science paper due.
and we have a great set of encyclopedias... Somewhere.
what do you think the public library is for?
I thought that was a bathroom for homeless people.
can I still play Plants vs. Zombies?
are you not listening?
but you learn about plants. - Mm-hmm.
and plants are life.
are you against life?
how am I supposed to talk to my friends?
talk to them at school.
or at a juice bar.
or on the house phone.
nobody even knows our number.
I don't even know our number.
so, you're saying dad's not going to go online?
Yep. - Dad?
that's right. - What about fantasy football?
not a problem. My team's set this week.
I am completely on board your mother's horse and buggy to yesteryear.
for the next week, I may as well be Amish.
Jebediah Dunphy.
raising barns, witnessing murders, making electric fireplace hearths.
Oh! This is so unfair!
you know what?
we're gonna make this fun.
turn it into a game.
whoever stays unplugged the longest, wins.
not what I had in mind, Phil.
what do we win? - What do you want?
I want a new computer.
done.
we're gonna get them off of electronics with the promise of more electronics?
I want chicken pot pie. - And chicken.
I want a car.
no way! - Done!
Yeah, I'm getting a car!
Yeah, fun, right? - Phil!
we cannot afford a third car.
relax. They're never gonna last as long as us.
Oh, honey, don't take this the wrong way, but I have almost no faith in you.
Joanie will be right out.
she's just finishing up another interview.
okay. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you.
you're welcome. - I really like this place.
look at all these drawings. - I know.
and did you see the duckies in the yard?
Lily loves duckies. - I know.
I'm gonna mention that.
okay, well, do, because that's really gonna Set her apart - from the rest of the kids. - Oh.
we should also mention how she always perks up when we watch "Charlie rose.
that was one time. He was interviewing Elmo.
you boys ought to relax.
Oh, I'm sorry.
we just... We really want to make a good impression.
gay adoptive parents with a minority baby?
sugars, you can get into any school you want.
what was that? Really?
Oh, you didn't know that?
Oh, yeah.
all of these schools like to brag about their diversity.
you're diverse times three.
in demand.
you're like Jimmy Buffett tickets to these hybrid-driving, straight white folks.
I hear that, girl.
Yeah.
I'm coming!
where the hell is the dog?
who is it? - It's our neighbor.
the dog is gone.
maybe it ran away.
it was chained to a tree.
maybe your wife took it.
according to my credit card, my wife is in Europe, searching for the world's most expensive hotel.
then what do you want from us?
you come over complaining about the dog and the next day it's gone?
you tell me.
I'll tell... - How dare you?
you come to our house, you ring our bell many times, and you accuse us of taking your dog.
you should go home.
we're not done here. - Yes, we are.
what did you do?
you don't want to know.
Gloria's grandfather and uncles were butchers, so she's always had a certain comfort level when it comes to... Killing.
one time, we had this rat...
what? First you smash it, then you cut the head off.
it was like nothing to her.
I go to church now.
she left the head out there to send a message to the other rats.
Hey. - Hi, honey.
how was your day at work?
amazing. Mwah.
great. What happened?
instead of wasting my lunch hour surfing the web, checking football stats,
I put on some mellow music, and I meditated.
Wow. For how long?
I have no idea. I just woke up 20 minutes ago.
Hey, mom.
I need a bar of soap and a black marker for an art project.
okay. Well, the marker's over there, and the soap is under the sink.
isn't it great how much time you have now that you're not wasting it online?
Oh, my God. Is this what you always sound like?
look what I built, dad. Dunphy Towers.
200 condos, a happy family in every one.
way to go, buddy.
I got to hand it to you, honey.
24 hours without video games, he's already contributing to society.
die! Die!
to be fair, he's using his imagination.
there's no fire escapes!
they cut corners!
I'll cut your corners!
Hello?
Oh, hi. Luke, honey, it's for you.
Hi, Griffin. How are you?
Yeah, he's right here. Hold on.
Hey, Griffin.
Oh, my God! - What happened?
there's a parasailing-donkey video on YouTube.
Oh, my God!
wait, Luke. What about the contest?
I quit.
I'm not made of stone, you know.
Uhh! I can't believe it.
I got a "B" on my paper.
good for you. - Yeah.
no, it would be good for you.
it's terrible for me.
thanks to your moldy encyclopedias, my take on mitosis was completely out of date.
they don't even call it protoplasm anymore.
it's cytoplasm.
well, you could have asked one of us.
now you're making jokes?
I'm not making a joke. - Really?
what's the difference between a gamete and a zygote?
don't fall for it, Claire.
she's just making up words. - Huh.
that's it.
I need the Internet.
I'm out of your stupid contest.
and then there were three.
she's kind of scary.
we're not buying her a car.
Hey, buddy, what you reading?
the old man and the sea.
you like it?
I like that Hemingway gets to the point.
you read a lot of his stuff?
that was a hint, Jay. - Oh.
Oh, I want to ask you something...
between you and me.
you want to know if I think my mom did something to that dog.
Yeah. - Sit.
don't most kids drink soda?
who knows what they do?
so, your mom.
Jay, I've learned a few things in my 12 years.
don't skimp on linens, don't compliment a teacher on her figure, and when it comes to my mom, never ask questions I don't want the answers to.
I don't buy it. Sensitive kid like you.
I think you want to know every bit as much as I do.
you're wrong.
then why is your hand shaking?
this is my fifth one of these today.
I may have a problem.
okay. That's enough.
no, no, no, 4: 00 tomorrow is fine.
Yeah, my life partner and I will see you then.
thank... Thank you.
since when do you call me your life partner?
since a spot opened up at Billingsley Academy.
but I liked Wagon Wheel. It had all the duckies.
and it reminded me of where I went in Missouri.
cam, everyone goes to Billingsley for a reason...
it's the Harvard of preschools.
she's not even 2 years old yet.
she doesn't need the Harvard of preschools.
she needs finger painting and duckies.
I'm begging you to please just say "ducks.
Hello?
great news. Wagon Wheel loved you.
you're in. - Oh.
wagon Wheel wants us.
Oh, yes!
okay. Well, that's great and everything, but actually we have an appointment tomorrow - at Billingsley. - Really?
Yeah, apparently we are in very high demand.
Oh, well, just so you know, I don't think Wagon Wheel is gonna hold a place for you.
well, I think we're gonna take our chance.
take our chance? That sounds chancy.
you know, Mitchell, you were the one who called me in a panic.
you were the one who needed me to get you in.
I'm sorry, Claire. I didn't mean to put you out.
but let's not get too dramatic here. You wrote an e-mail.
it wasn't an e-mail.
it was a phone call from a land line.
what did you do?
what's best for Lily. - Did you?
cam, this is the first time that being gay is a competitive advantage.
they're choosing teams for gym class, and we're finally getting picked first.
I always got picked first.
I could throw a dodgeball through a piece of plywood.
but I see your point.
Hey.
don't sneak up on me like that.
what are you doing out here?
you got in my head about my mom.
is that the rat shovel?
Yeah.
are you checking it for signs of dog?
I was going to.
well, let's do this quick.
if she catches us, we're as dead as that dog probably is.
what are you doing here? - Nothing.
why are you looking at that shovel?
do you think someone did something with that shovel, Manny?
he thinks you killed the dog.
you little rat.
don't call me a rat!
she kills rats!
you really think that I would kill a dog?
well, what was I supposed to think?
I don't know.
how about I didn't kill a dog?
just tell me what you did with it.
he's in a better place.
that's what people say when something's dead.
okay, fine.
I took him to a farm where he has plenty of room to run.
that's the second thing people say when something's dead.
my hairdresser's brother has three kids.
they live in the country.
they were so happy to have the dog that they gave me a jar of pickles.
is that also what they say when something is dead?
Really?
look. Look how happy they are, instead of him being tied to a tree outside with no one to talk to.
why didn't you just tell me this in the first place?
like you would be okay with me stealing a dog?
no. - Exactly.
that's why I didn't tell you.
now the dog is happy, Manny can sleep, and we have pickles.
okay, it worked out this time, but don't forget that stealing is against the law.
now, maybe in Colombia... - Ah, here we go, because in Colombia we trip over goats and we kill people in the street.
do you know how offensive that is?
like we are Peruvians!
the contest was hard.
reservations.
even though we had sworn off the Internet, the rest of the world hadn't.
Orlando.
domestic.
representative.
Representative!
you've got mail.
really, Claire? - You don't understand.
I was trying to deal with our plane tickets to visit your family.
please stop. You're just embarrassing yourself.
well, it looks like it's just you and me, old man.
bring it.
and finally, here we are back at the office.
if you two would like to take a seat,
I will let Mr. Plympton know that you're here.
thank you. - Yes, thank you.
this place is amazing!
I told you.
it's like Hogwarts!
the ladybug sanctuary.
Oh, my gosh. The little cobblestones.
screw the duckies. We belong here.
do you think they're gonna let us in?
cam, relax.
we're queer, we're here.
Yes, we are.
okay. Just a few more minutes.
thank you.
Yes, thank you.
Hi. I'm Stephanie Kaner.
and this is Javar.
we have an interview with Mr. Plympton.
wonderful. These two are first. You'll be next.
single white mother, black child.
so what? Lily's Asian. We're gay.
in the school admissions poker game, we're the winning hand.
Oh, honey, sorry.
my partner Kavita.
Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hello. Nice to meet you.
it will be just a few minutes.
disabled interracial lesbians with an African kicker.
did not see that coming.
it's been a while since I read an actual newspaper.
miss that sound.
no, no, no, no! - What is it?
Brady's injured.
No! He's my whole team.
I have to change my roster.
honey, if you can't do it over the phone, you can't do it, because we're not buying Haley a car.
Yeah. - Yeah.
Yeah. Well...
well, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
Phil Dunphy, don't you even dream of it.
Claire, all my friends are in that league.
I'm gonna like an idiot. - So what?
so I paid a huge entrance fee.
how huge? - Not huge. Tiny.
Oh, my goodness. How is she not cracking up there?
listen to her.
no, I know, but do you know?
wait a minute. She's alone.
so?
she's alone.
Oh, my God.
I know. You should see her pants.
I'll text it to you.
Oh, wait. Okay. Hold on. I'll send it.
ha! Aha! - Aha! Busted!
Sophie, I have to call you back.
I knew it. I knew you couldn't do it.
I told you I'd outlast them.
this sucks! - What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.
I win.
nobody gets a car, I dump Tom Brady, and our long Amish nightmare is over.
I can't believe you thought you were gonna put one over on us.
I can't believe that he's actually already on the Internet.
believe it, girl.
so, you're actually online right now? - Yep.
well, then I hate to break it to you, daddy, but you lose.
what? - What?
this isn't my phone.
I carved it out of a bar of soap and colored it in with a marker.
Phil, she carved a telephone out of a bar of soap.
I can't believe it! I'm getting a car!
holy crap. We've been shawshanked.
sorry about the delay.
I was going over the plans for our new dance studio.
Wow.
so, tell me about yourselves.
uh, well, I'm a lawyer.
many of our applicants are attorneys.
of course.
what sets you apart?
um, well, I...
while my white-man name is Tucker, I am 1/16 cherokee.
while my white-man name is Tucker, I am 1/16 cherokee.
ready for child to soar like eagle.
Oh, God.
so, what are you saying?
um... - Uhhh...
you're not getting a car.
but I won.
Yes, but we never thought you would.
so?
so, congratulations on your victory.
nobody can ever take that away from you.
so true. - Mm-hmm.
but I spent two days in my room talking to a bar of soap.
it's not fair.
it's totally not fair.
we're outraged.
bad parenting.
but we had a deal.
which, in hindsight, was utter nonsense.
Hey.
we hated Billingsley.
the place is so stupid. - Ugh!
you blew the interview, didn't you?
lesbians.
in a wheelchair. - Oh.
you still mad at me?
you tell me.
what is this?
I've been thinking if you said as much about America as I said about Colombia, I'd be plenty ticked off.
doesn't make up for everything, but...
a trip to Colombia?
I want to see your village, learn your culture.
I love you.
I'm sure I'm gonna love where you come from.
Aw, Jay. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
no way he's going to my village.
I was in two car accidents when I was living there.
both times I hit a goat.
one was hurt pretty bad.
but it was a good thing I had a shovel in the trunk.
the tribe has foretold that, though I lay with fire-haired man, the giving hawk would bring us baby with her skin the color of sweet corn, which my people call maize.
please stop.
well, um...
knowledge is her sustenance, like so much maize...
knowledge is her sustenance, like so much maize...
which, you'll remember, means "corn.
what if I was a single dad?
why are there giant lollipops all over the front yard?
and why do they taste so bad?
because they're made out of cardboard, mouth-breather.
the world needs more dreamers, luke.
never stop licking things.
I know it's lame, but after last year, we promised the neighbors we would keep our decorations more family-friendly.
we can't even carve a pumpkin?
the petition was very specific.
every halloween, we have the best house.
last year, I took things to a whole new level, but apparently, it was too scary for some kids...
and one adult.
would you like some candy?
or would you rather have this?
come on. You're fine.
I don't care what anyone says.
you did not give that man a heart attack.
thank you.
I mean, you're not even scary.
can I grab a little bit of this candy for my open house tonight?
uh, yeah, sure, but...
it's genius.
an open house on halloween.
now they can get away from all that, and see a nice house.
what do you mean, i'm not even scary?
I literally almost scared the life out of a man.
you literally scared a little saliva and a little urine out of him.
that happens to me every time I see a monkey wearing people clothes.
I was plenty scary.
I used professional-grade makeup.
that's the point, claire. It was overkill.
you're the kind of person who can be twice as scary without wearing any makeup.
Bye.
you remembered to pick up the costumes, right?
Yes, they're right over there.
very excited.
cam has lost a lot of weight...no.
so we're throwing a halloween party to debut the new him.
I'll be dressed as a matador.
wh-what is it now, 30?
32. 4.
so I've lost lily.
where is lily?
do you-you don't have her?
no. Why would I have her? I don't have her in my pocket. - Cam?
what about the tiara?
uh, we didn't buy one.
you can just use the one from last year.
are we poor?
no, sweetheart, but you don't need two tiaras.
how 'bout next halloween you try a different costume?
no. I have to be a princess.
every year? Why?
because my mom's a princess, just like you told me.
cam and I have always known that someday, we were gonna have to have the big talk with lily about who her mom was.
we-we were gonna pick the right time and do it together, carefully following an agreed-upon script.
then I got tired.
and she was the most beautiful princess in all the land.
the end." Again.
why is tyler's mommy so fat?
Oh, that's because she has - She has a baby in her belly.
okay? Good night.
was I in my mom's belly?
Lily, no more questions, all right?
just-just go to sleep.
Where's my mom now?
um, she's...
in a faraway land.
Why?
because she's a princess.
and she's...
very, very busy.
okay.
I thought that she'd forget about it by the next morning.
I mean, I did.
Oh, I knew I was gonna have to tell cam, and he was gonna be furious, but I was hoping that he'd see the bigger issue.
you know, I was really tired.
Hey, cam, you know this whole thing about lily wanting to be a princess again?
well, I-I think it might be because I let her believe her mother was
this is a nightmare.
it was just a mistake.
more like a disaster.
they sent the matador costume in your size, and the bull costume in mine.
I didn't notice.
now no one's gonna see my bod in this bulky bull costume.
it was-it was honestly a mistake.
l- listen, um, you-you could do that other thing that you thought of.
you could put on that gorgeous white suit that fits you so well now, and you could be Mr. Roarke, and lily could be your tattoo.
No! I have to be a princess!
Oh, but, lily, you were a princess last year.
No! You promised! I'm being a princess!
why is she so obsessed with princesses?
well. . .
like we weren't at that age? I mean. . .
I'm not mad about the ticket.
it's just the first time I couldn't charm my way out of one of these things.
the way I see it, it's not a ticket.
it's a conversation.
no offense. You don't need that siren.
you could stop traffic just getting out of that squad car.
license and registration, please.
I, uh. .I'm no stranger to the police academy myself.
seen all seven of them.
sir, no one's seen all seven.
is this information accurate?
Yeah. Uh, except for the weight.
I thought they wanted to know how much I could curl.
I must be getting rusty with my moves.
moves? What moves?
you know, flash the baby blues, hit 'em with the devilish grin.
in case of emergency, break glass and bust out the dimple.
Hey, isn't that one from the smallpox?
cause I'm 100.
chicken pox.
and it doesn't matter where it's from. It always worked.
Hey, mom.
Manny, why are you coming back from school so late?
I got sent to the principal's office.
I am sending him an angry e-mail, because I don't like when - no, no, no.
it's not his fault.
what did you do wrong?
nothing.
Oh, that's it. I'm calling him.
I hate when he tries to - Nothing on purpose.
it was between periods, right before this big test.
I was clearing my mind by practicing some of my gene kelly dance moves.
as one does.
right.
and my umbrella accidentally snagged the fire alarm.
the principal thought I did it on purpose so we'd miss the test.
but you didn't!
that's it!
I'm going to his house! - Mom!
you gotta stop doing this.
I'm not sure if it's the pregnancy, which we both know isn't your fault...
but lately you've been such a hothead.
I am not a hothead!
I am colombian.
we get excited.
my country is covered in coffee.
just like the starbucks girl when she got your order wrong?
Half-caf, non-fat wet soy latte.
how hard is that to hear?!
you don't get to be 2 - time nonconsecutive district salesman of the year without thinking inside the box.
that's right.
I said "inside.
you know why?
cause while everyone's chasing each other around outside the box, you know what the box is?
empty.
which brings us back to our formal dining room.
now any questions?
can we have our candy now?
just as soon as we go over what you're gonna tell your parents.
now what was our style?
pre-war craftsman.- Good, good.
and how many square feet?
still no trick-or-treaters?
not yet.
well, maybe people are going out later this year.
well, the street's full of kids, but they're actively detouring around our house.
move along.
who wants some candy?
plenty of name-brand...
family-friendly candy right here.- It's a trap!
no. I-ooh, how about you?
hey - You want some candy, right?
come on, have some candy! - Mom!
mommy, she's got me!
no, I don't - I'm not trying - My candy! - Just leave it!
Jay, you have to get ready for mitch and cam's party.
Gloria, does my skin look looser to you?
what?
maybe I should try some of that fancy neck cream of yours.
don't you have some with specks of diamonds in it or something?
Trick-or-treat.- Trick-or-treat.
you guys don't even have costumes.
I'm a skeleton.
and I'm-i'm a lemon.
aren't you too old to be trick-or-treating?
aren't you too old to be having a baby?
Ah, you find that funny, lemon?
here's a better joke.
knock, knock. What's gone?
your candy!
what was that?
some rude dummies, that they think that they can - All right, listen.
let's just calm down.
get ready for the party.
calm down what?
you think I'm a hothead, like manny?
No!
you can be emotional.
volatile, maybe.
still, that's a far cry from
you put egg on my house, i kill what you love!
psycho.
plush utility room?
Yeah, right. I know a hall closet when I see one.
and your dad never lies?
what medical school did the great appliance doctor attend?
Hey, delgado.
Oh, no!
what I wouldn't give for this umbrella to have mary poppins' powers.
Oh, I pray he didn't hear that.
heard you pulled the fire alarm today and got us out of that test.
good job.
Thanks, Mr. Durkas.
you know what?
you don't need to call me that anymore.
anyway, we're all meeting at the playground at 8: 00 and heading out, if you want to join.
you're totally going to that.
Yeah, if you want to ruin your reputation.
you're finally gonna be in with the cool kids.
you need to talk at the school assembly on monday and apologize to all the teachers.
teachers. More like public sector parasites.
be strong, manny.
be smart.
adventures, parties.
juvie, heartache.
girls!
but not the kind we want.
they're all the kind we want.
Mr. Dur - Conrad!?
take one.
I'm an egg donor.
I love your costume, too, cam.
Adora-bull.
Oh, well, thank you. It's all in fun.
I half-wanted to wear something tighter.
you know, I've been reducing.
I can see.
well, you say it like you can't.
no, no, no. I totally can.
impressive, huh?
Yeah. I'm-i'm gonna...
Hey, cam.
I'm hearing a rumor that you keep flashing our guests.
Oh, well, not in a perverted way.
I just want people to see my body under this stupid costume.
that's very close to what actual flashers say.
daddy?
Yeah, one second, honey.
I'm just tired of throwing out compliments and not getting anything back.
I told roberto his spray tan looked real.
look for yourself.
it's on two of our pillows and our cat.
daddy.
lookit. It's my mommy. She came.
Oh, no, honey, that's not your mommy.
it's not? - No, no.
that's just one of daddy's friends.
what's going on?
Oh, nothing. She just wants one of these cupcakes.
but I already had - Oh, there you go, honey.
okay, off you go. Mingle! Mingle!
looks like some people came by.
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we had a few.
I saw that.
Hello?
Hey, honey.
Hi. How's your open house?
pretty empty, actually.
I kind of just took it out on a harry potter.
seriously, though, a gryffindor letting his mom carry his quidditch broom?
how hufflepuff is that?
it's pretty lonely here, too.
we have been shunned by the whole neighborhood.
that's ridiculous.
all over some mild little gag you pulled?
it was not mild.
there was an investig
Oh, I-I thought I heard someone.
I guess it was just trees tapping against the window.
it's pretty creepy over here in this rattly old house.
anyway, I'll probably give it another 30 minutes, then I'll see you at home.
okay.
Bye.
what are you laughing about?
Oh, it's just your poor dad, you know.
your poor, dumb dad.
that's hilarious! You sound just like him.
you are so doing that at christmas talent night.
Dude,"rich girl," "sara smile."
then a "maneater" encore.
it was scary how good they were.
close your eyes, it could have been the real band.
Yeah, he got lucky in the football pool once, and now he wants to double the stakes.
Oh, I'm so scared!
right?
well, this night was a bust.
not a single person even...
or did I speak too soon?
was someone in the mood to be a bad little ghoul?
Oh, connie, I didn't mean you.
I'm-hey, that's just- That's just the divorce talking.
hang in there.
Bye-bye.
well, someone decided to take a trip to fantasy island after all.
well, I'm tired of people not noticing my new physique.
if this doesn't work, i'm breaking out the diaper and top hat and going as baby new year!
hello. - Oh, my god!
John-john, is that you?
you look amazing.
Thanks! That's what happens when you lose 100 pounds.
Oh, come on. What a
who wants to lift me?
me. - Come on.
how could he have not called us? XXX
you know what?
I'm gonna go lift him and shake him till his staples pop.
cam, stop!
just saying that we could have caught those kids.
what, and chase them around all night?
I'm not a young man anymore, as the world keeps pointing out.
what did that waiter just call you outside?
medieval knievel.
that is hilarious.
I love when people put some thought into their outfit.
illegal alien, sugar daddy.
why do you say "illegal"?
because antennas are alien, and you're
what? Illegal?
because of the color of my skin?
why don't I dump your baby in your gas tank?
uh, no hard feelings, please.
just enjoy the party, okay?
first of all, relax. We're at a party.
secondly, you've been deported twice.
you're not allowed to be that defensive.
what is it with me lately?
Manny's right. I'm such a hothead.
it happens.
you're pregnant.
that's what it is, isn't it?
it's the baby.
it's angry in there.
No!
Yes!
you just said it yourself.
I have changed.
I have an angry baby inside of me making me do bad things!
it's just hormones.
it's your mama bear instinct kicking in.
and that's a good thing, because that means you're gonna be a great mom-again.
do you really think so?
you got a lucky little kid in there.
he's got a mom who's not gonna let anyone harm him.
or her.
or-or him.
Trick-or-treat.- Trick-or-treat.
go ahead.
you better run!
Oh, my gosh, is that the most precious thing you've ever seen?
Oh, my god.
do you know other princesses?
trust me.
I know lots.
okay.
bedtime.
Oh, no, it's not that late.
do you know my mom?
she's a princess.
she's exhausted.
she's not making sense.
she's so tired.
daddy, you told me!
what is she talking about, mitchell?
my real mom.
she is, right?
okay, I think we need to have a little talk.
Sam, do you notice how slim cam's getting?
nice try.
I will be back for that answer.
this isn't gonna work, claire...
cause I know you're here.
what's the plan, anyway?
you gonna pop out at me?
it's gonna take more than that to scare this...
Hello?! - hi!
is the house still open?
Oh, yes! Yes! I'll be right down.
Claire, this is serious! I have a job!
not that you don't.
you work 247 and you don't get half the appreciation you deserve.
can we talk about this later?
as you potential buyers can see, this is a, uh, a beautiful home.
what's behind here?
Oh, I wouldn't go in there!
unless you love formal dining rooms.
honey, look at this.
I'm in the kitchen.
Oh, we should probably stay together.
come on, sheila.
Phil, one question.
are these - wait, wait.
I just love to see people's reactions when I show them - So much storage.
what? It's crazy!
I think you guys will find that this house is full of so many...
delightful surprises that you'll be happy here for - Oh, my god! - I don't know her!
is this the original tub?
what?
Yes, it is.
it is, uh, the original tub.
um, original fixtures, beveled mirror, just a-a huge stall shower if you guys would, uh, want to have a party.
I'm kidding, of course.
but, um, just a house with a real personality.
we'll be right in, sweetie.
we agreed to tell lily about her mother together, wearing calming earth tones, and we agreed to tell her the truth.
I know, but haven't you ever said something dumb to lily that you wish she would just forget?
this isn't about me.
let's just fix this.
okay, great.
although...
the way you agreed so quickly makes me wonder what sort of things you've told her.
I may have told her her fibs kills birds.
we're coming back to that one.
Oh, hi, princess.
Hey, lil.
could we talk to you for a second?
am I in trouble?
Oh, gosh, no.
of course not, sweetie.
well, do you remember how we used to tell you there was a heaven for all the flowers that die?
what do you mean,"used to"?
sorry, I let it slip. We'll deal with it later.
much much are you not telling me?
why are you talking like this?
daddies took a little side trip. Sorry, sweetie.
um, so sometimes, uh, we tell you things like that to make you feel better.
and I might have done the same thing when I told you that your mom is a princess.
so she's not?
well, you know what?
she might be.
she might be.
but we can't know for sure, honey, because...
well, we don't know where she is or...
what she's doing.
B- but what-what we do know is that she loved you very, very much...
and she knew that she couldn't take care of you, so she made sure that you went with the most loving family she could find.
and that's how the three of us became a family.
does that make sense, sweetie?
do you have any questions for us?
why did you say a fib and kill a bird?
I noticed you walking in with your wife earlier.
she's stunning.
you know my favorite part of that compliment?
you knew she was my wife.
half the world thinks she's my daughter.
well, if you ask me, she's a lucky girl.
bummer for me, though.
handsomest man in here, and he's taken.
I'll bet you do all right with the boys.
I do.
it's the men i'm interested in.
you just put it all right out there, don't you?
I always try to hold a little something back.
Oh, my gosh.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
leave him.
no, but you know that's a
I know. He needs this.
okay.
it was great meeting you, jay.
you, too, sam.
looks like somebody really likes you.
what can I say?
I still got it.
I've been meaning to ask you - Have you lost some weight?
because you look good.
wow, you have no idea what that means to hear from you, jay.
uh, turn it that way.
I thought this might cheer you up.
da plane! Da plane!
baby girl!
look you! You even taught her the catchphrase.
Jay, have you seen my new tattoo?.
be in touch. - Well, thanks so much for coming.
Yeah. Thanks. - Okay.
okay, claire, they're gone. You can come out now.
honey, I'm sorry I said you weren't scary.
it's been such a long day.
can we please just go home?
all right.
I'm leaving without ya.
so...
this remote you know how to use.
yes?
Phil, where are you?
where are you?
I came over to scare you, but then I heard you showing the house to that couple, so I got out of your way.
are you at home?
Yeah. I got here ten minutes ago.
s - so...So you're saying...
this call isn't coming from inside the house?
what are you talking about?
just get home.
the kids and I are hungry.
Yeah, hurry up, dad.
we miss you!
miss you, too, buddy.
I wasn't really that scared.
okay.
Hey, you never told me if you hit those kids with that egg.
they blended into the crowd, but there was a slow one with them.
he couldn't run so fast, and I nailed him pretty good.
I warned you.
okay, reuben.
where are your cool friends now?
not q-tipping your ear, that's for sure.
okay, reuben.
this is why I never hang out with cool kids.
Yeah, you rejected them, shortly after you and your mom roller danced at the talent show.
we were robbed.
couldn't have been the song you picked.
wing beneath my w -" ow!
why are there giant lollipops all over the front yard?
and why do they taste so bad?
because they're made out of cardboard, mouth-breather.
the world needs more dreamers, Luke.
never stop licking things.
I know it's lame, but after last year, we promised the neighbors we would keep our decorations more family-friendly.
we can't even carve a pumpkin?
the petition was very specific.
every halloween, we have the best house.
last year, I took things to a whole new level, but apparently, it was too scary for some kids...
and one adult.
would you like some candy?
or would you rather have this?
come on. You're fine.
I don't care what anyone says.
you did not give that man a heart attack.
thank you.
I mean, you're not even scary.
can I grab a little bit of this candy for my open house tonight?
uh, yeah, sure, but...
it's genius.
an open house on halloween.
now they can get away from all that, and see a nice house.
what do you mean, I'm not even scary?
I literally almost scared the life out of a man.
you literally scared a little saliva and a little urine out of him.
that happens to me every time I see a monkey wearing people clothes.
I was plenty scary.
I used professional-grade makeup.
that's the point, Claire. It was overkill.
you're the kind of person who can be twice as scary without wearing any makeup.
Bye.
you remembered to pick up the costumes, right?
Yes, they're right over there.
very excited.
cam has lost a lot of weight...no.
so we're throwing a halloween party to debut the new him.
I'll be dressed as a matador.
wh-what is it now, 30?
32. 4.
so I've lost lily.
where is lily?
do you-you don't have her?
no. Why would I have her? I don't have her in my pocket. - Cam?
what about the tiara?
uh, we didn't buy one.
you can just use the one from last year.
are we poor?
no, sweetheart, but you don't need two tiaras.
how 'bout next halloween you try a different costume?
no. I have to be a princess.
every year? Why?
because my mom's a princess, just like you told me.
cam and I have always known that someday, we were gonna have to have the big talk with Lily about who her mom was.
we-we were gonna pick the right time and do it together, carefully following an agreed-upon script.
then I got tired.
and she was the most beautiful princess in all the land.
"the end." Again.
why is tyler's mommy so fat?
Oh, that's because she has - She has a baby in her belly.
okay? Good night.
was I in my mom's belly?
Lily, no more questions, all right?
just-just go to sleep.
Where's my mom now?
um, she's...
in a faraway land.
Why?
because she's a princess.
and she's...
very, very busy.
okay.
I thought that she'd forget about it by the next morning.
I mean, I did.
Oh, I knew I was gonna have to tell Cam, and he was gonna be furious, but I was hoping that he'd see the bigger issue.
you know, I was really tired.
Hey, cam, you know this whole thing about lily wanting to be a princess again?
well, I-I think it might be because I let her believe her mother was
this is a nightmare.
it was just a mistake.
more like a disaster.
they sent the matador costume in your size, and the bull costume in mine.
I didn't notice.
now no one's gonna see my bod in this bulky bull costume.

you could put on that gorgeous white suit that fits you so well now, and you could be Mr. Roarke, and Lily could be your tattoo.
No! I have to be a princess!
Oh, but, Lily, you were a princess last year.
No! You promised! I'm being a princess!
why is she so obsessed with princesses?

Oh, I'm so scared!
right?
well, this night was a bust.
not a single person even...
or did I speak too soon?
was someone in the mood to be a bad little ghoul?
Oh, Connie, I didn't mean you.
I'm-hey, that's just- That's just the divorce talking.
hang in there.
Bye-bye.
well, someone decided to take a trip to fantasy island after all.
well, I'm tired of people not noticing my new physique.
if this doesn't work, I'm breaking out the diaper and top hat and going as baby new year!
hello. - Oh, my god!
John-John, is that you?
you look amazing.
Thanks! That's what happens when you lose 100 pounds.
Oh, come on. What a
who wants to lift me?
me. - Come on.
how could he have not called us? XXX
you know what?
I'm gonna go lift him and shake him till his staples pop.
cam, stop!
just saying that we could have caught those kids.
what, and chase them around all night?
I'm not a young man anymore, as the world keeps pointing out.
what did that waiter just call you outside?
medieval knievel.
that is hilarious.
I love when people put some thought into their outfit.
illegal alien, sugar daddy.
why do you say "illegal"?
because antennas are alien, and you're
what? Illegal?
because of the color of my skin?
why don't I dump your baby in your gas tank?
uh, no hard feelings, please.
just enjoy the party, okay?
first of all, relax. We're at a party.
secondly, you've been deported twice.
you're not allowed to be that defensive.
what is it with me lately?
Manny's right. I'm such a hothead.
it happens.
you're pregnant.
that's what it is, isn't it?
it's the baby.
it's angry in there.
No!
Yes!
you just said it yourself.
I have changed.
I have an angry baby inside of me making me do bad things!
it's just hormones.
it's your mama bear instinct kicking in.
and that's a good thing, because that means you're gonna be a great mom-again.
do you really think so?
you got a lucky little kid in there.
he's got a mom who's not gonna let anyone harm him.
or her.
or-or him.
Trick-or-treat.- Trick-or-treat.
go ahead.
you better run!
Oh, my gosh, is that the most precious thing you've ever seen?
Oh, my god.
do you know other princesses?
trust me.
I know lots.
okay.
bedtime.
Oh, no, it's not that late.
do you know my mom?
she's a princess.
she's exhausted.
she's not making sense.
she's so tired.
daddy, you told me!
what is she talking about, Mitchell?
my real mom.
she is, right?
okay, I think we need to have a little talk.
Sam, do you notice how slim cam's getting?
nice try.
I will be back for that answer.
this isn't gonna work, claire...
cause I know you're here.
what's the plan, anyway?
you gonna pop out at me?
it's gonna take more than that to scare this...
Hello?! - hi!
is the house still open?
Oh, yes! Yes! I'll be right down.
Claire, this is serious! I have a job!
not that you don't.
you work 247 and you don't get half the appreciation you deserve.
can we talk about this later?
as you potential buyers can see, this is a, uh, a beautiful home.
what's behind here?
Oh, I wouldn't go in there!
unless you love formal dining rooms.
honey, look at this.
I'm in the kitchen.
Oh, we should probably stay together.
come on, Sheila.
Phil, one question.
are these - wait, wait.
I just love to see people's reactions when I show them - So much storage.
what? It's crazy!
I think you guys will find that this house is full of so many...
delightful surprises that you'll be happy here for - Oh, my god! - I don't know her!
is this the original tub?
what?
Yes, it is.
it is, uh, the original tub.
um, original fixtures, beveled mirror, just a-a huge stall shower if you guys would, uh, want to have a party.
I'm kidding, of course.
but, um, just a house with a real personality.
we'll be right in, sweetie.
we agreed to tell Lily about her mother together, wearing calming earth tones, and we agreed to tell her the truth.
I know, but haven't you ever said something dumb to Lily that you wish she would just forget?
this isn't about me.
let's just fix this.
okay, great.
although...
the way you agreed so quickly makes me wonder what sort of things you've told her.
I may have told her her fibs kills birds.
we're coming back to that one.
Oh, hi, princess.
Hey, Lil.
could we talk to you for a second?
am I in trouble?
Oh, gosh, no.
of course not, sweetie.
well, do you remember how we used to tell you there was a heaven for all the flowers that die?
what do you mean,"used to"?
sorry, I let it slip. We'll deal with it later.
much much are you not telling me?
why are you talking like this?
daddies took a little side trip. Sorry, sweetie.
um, so sometimes, uh, we tell you things like that to make you feel better.
and I might have done the same thing when I told you that your mom is a princess.
so she's not?
well, you know what?
she might be.
she might be.
but we can't know for sure, honey, because...
well, we don't know where she is or...
what she's doing.
B- but what-what we do know is that she loved you very, very much...
and she knew that she couldn't take care of you, so she made sure that you went with the most loving family she could find.
and that's how the three of us became a family.
does that make sense, sweetie?
do you have any questions for us?
why did you say a fib and kill a bird?
I noticed you walking in with your wife earlier.
she's stunning.
you know my favorite part of that compliment?
you knew she was my wife.
half the world thinks she's my daughter.
well, if you ask me, she's a lucky girl.
bummer for me, though.
handsomest man in here, and he's taken.
I'll bet you do all right with the boys.
I do.
it's the men I'm interested in.
you just put it all right out there, don't you?
I always try to hold a little something back.
Oh, my gosh.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
leave him.
no, but you know that's a
I know. He needs this.
okay.
it was great meeting you, Jay.
you, too, Sam.
looks like somebody really likes you.
what can I say?
I still got it.
I've been meaning to ask you - Have you lost some weight?
because you look good.
wow, you have no idea what that means to hear from you, Jay.
uh, turn it that way.
I thought this might cheer you up.
da plane! Da plane!
baby girl!
look you! You even taught her the catchphrase.
Jay, have you seen my new tattoo?.
be in touch. - Well, thanks so much for coming.
Yeah. Thanks. - Okay.
okay, Claire, they're gone. You can come out now.
honey, I'm sorry I said you weren't scary.
it's been such a long day.
can we please just go home?
all right.
I'm leaving without ya.
so...
this remote you know how to use.
yes?
Phil, where are you?
where are you?
I came over to scare you, but then I heard you showing the house to that couple, so I got out of your way.
are you at home?
Yeah. I got here ten minutes ago.
s - so...So you're saying...
this call isn't coming from inside the house?
what are you talking about?
just get home.
the kids and I are hungry.
Yeah, hurry up, dad.
we miss you!
miss you, too, buddy.
I wasn't really that scared.
okay.
Hey, you never told me if you hit those kids with that egg.
they blended into the crowd, but there was a slow one with them.
he couldn't run so fast, and I nailed him pretty good.
I warned you.
okay, Reuben.
where are your cool friends now?
not q-tipping your ear, that's for sure.
okay, Reuben.
this is why I never hang out with cool kids.
Yeah, you rejected them, shortly after you and your mom roller danced at the talent show.
we were robbed.
couldn't have been the song you picked.
wing beneath my w -ow!
night. - No.
middle of the phone. I got it. - Get it.
Oh! My arm's asleep! My arm's asleep! - Get the phone. Phil, get the phone.
that's me. Hello! Hi.
Yes, this is she.
who is it?
okay. Oh, God.
tell me what's happening here!
Haley has been arrested.
what?
phone! Phone. I bet that's mama. I was just dreaming it was raining chickens!
Mitchell, answer the phone!
look what I am doing. Look what I am doing, huh?
Hello? - Hey, Mitchell.
I'm sorry to wake you up, but Haley got arrested.
Oh, God. Haley got arrested.
that explains the chickens.
it does. It adds up.
what did she get arrested for?
Oh, she got caught drinking at some party.
look, could you drive up to the college with us?
I think we're gonna need a lawyer. - Yes, of course.
and Cam and Lily can come over and stay with Alex and Luke.
I'll guard them with my life. - Yeah, yeah.
I hate to bother him.
no, no, don't be silly. He's happy to do it.
okay, we'll be over in a little bit. Okay.
Oh, I get it.
when you told Claire I would come over and watch the kids, she was resistant because she doesn't trust my parenting skills.
no. Don't be silly. She just didn't want to put you out.
she's got a daughter behind bars and she's got the nerve to say I'm a bad parent?
you didn't defend me. - Because she didn't say anything.
why are you protecting her?
why is no one protecting me?
no.
ay! Answer! Answer!
this better be good.
Haley got arrested for drinking.
we gotta go bail her out.
do you still have a connection to that judge upstate?
he died. - Ay! Who died?
an old friend of mine.
ay, Jay, I'm so sorry.
he died five years ago.
then why are they calling us in the middle of the night to wake us up?!
nobody died. Haley's in jail.
okay. That makes more sense.
Claire has to go bail her out.
okay. Give me that.
Claire, listen to me
take a lot of cash.
and when you flash it to the police, do not speak about it.
let the eyes do all the talking, okay?
I heard the phone. Who died?
Jay's friend. - Oh, Jay, I'm so sorry.
okay. I can't do this again.
it's breakfastIt's breakfast time
it's breaky breaky time
uncle Cam. I thought I heard your voice.
what are you doing here? Where are my parents?
well, the school called, and your sister won a big award.
nice try. The only person who would believe that would be Haley.
she's in jail.
jail?
Lily, what did I say?
that it was only a matter of time.
okay, no. Didn't say that.
okay, so here's the truth.
your sister was caught drinking.
but it's no big deal.
your parents are there taking care of it right now.
so...
this is so awesome!
I hope she hits the weights so she's totally ripped when she gets out.
okay. Let's change the subject. Have a seat. Have some breakfast.
see if there's anything on that plate you like a lot.
is this bacon?
of course it is, silly.
been on a little bit of a health kick lately, so I took a vegan cooking class, and my new thing is "fakon.
it's like real bacon.
except for the look, the texture, and the taste.
maybe the store-bought kind.
but I make my own, so it's not even real fakon.
it's faux-fakon. "Faux-kon.
it's faux-kon disgusting.
you can't tell the difference.
and guess which one's the real one?
that one.
that one.
still that one.
this is the best bacon I've ever had.
Oh, well.
I can't wait to tell your Uncle Mitchell that you love it.
why would Uncle Mitch care?
because, my dear, that bacon you're eating isn't bacon at all, no, no, no.
it's made entirely of soy.
Luke's allergic to soy!
his throat closes! He can't breathe!
Hello? - Never mind!
okay, okay.
we have to, uh, get you to the, uh, hospital!
Lily! Come on, baby. - Okay, Luke! Put the fakon down!
I'm using it to scratch my throat!
okay. Okay. Let's go. Come on. Go.
that was weird.
Hey, Claire, do you wanna pick it up a little bit?
since when do you drive the speed limit?
my daughter has been arrested for drinking.
I would like her to sit in jail and think about that.
as a matter of fact, I might stop and do a little outlet shopping.
who wants a pair of last year's sunglasses, huh?
honey...
try to relax.
I don't feel like relaxing, Phil!
she has been in college for six weeks.
Yeah, and everyone goes a little crazy at first.
more than enough.
I'm not gonna lie.
sometimes it bothers me how calm Phil is under pressure.
it's like...
like I'm the one who's overreacting.
that's good. Let it out. It's g
I'm going to kill you.
Jay, do you have some time today?
we need to go and pick out a stroller.
just get whatever you want.
I mean, it's what you're gonna do anyway.
what I want is a husband who likes to go shopping for a stroller with me.
if you had a husband who liked picking out strollers, you wouldn't be having a baby.
so who wants to come with me to the spoken word festival this evening?
I only have two tickets, so somebody's gonna be disappointed.
I think it's gonna be you.
ay, Manny, I would go with you, but I'm so tired.
you just woke up. How are you tired?
maybe because I'm turning food into a human!
Jay will take you.
sorry, I would love to go to the spoken word festival, but I'm already going to the I'd-rather-blow-my-brains-out jamboree.
I can't believe this.
I'm living in a cultural wasteland.
with a heated pool.
Manny, vamos. You're gonna be late for school.
Oh, jeez.
Hello, DeDe.
good morning, Jay. Namaste.
let's not do this.
Oh, fine, silly.
I'm on my way to a retreat in Ojai, and since I'm passing through town,
I thought I'd pick up that photo album.
you know, it's really not a good time.
Oh, please.
all right. I'll meet you on the street.
drive by slow with the window open.
I was dreading DeDe finding out that Gloria's pregnant.
it's the one thing DeDe's hung on to, that she's the mother of my kids.
and considering their history...
I-I wanna...rip your head off!
No! Please stop it! - Whoa!
No! DeDe!
I wasn't exactly looking forward to round four, especially now that Gloria's a bigger, slower target.
I'd normally be having breakfast right now.
Hi, dad.
Hey, Claire. Any updates?
not yet, but we're almost there.
last time you were over at the house, you were looking at that photo album.
What'd you do with it?
Oh, dad, that was me.
I think I put it on the shelf behind the bar.
what are you doing there?
they asked me to come along in case they needed a lawyer.
shouldn't they have a real lawyer?
Oh, God. Should we?
I am a real lawyer, people. Environmental law is a thing.
don't get all sensitive on me.
I mean someone who doesn't defend pandas.
Yeah, dad,'cause that's what I do.
I-I defend pandas in court.
that's adorable.
you know what I'm talking about.
Haley needs somebody who knows criminal law, like Perry Mason.
okay, so I'm not a real lawyer, but Perry Mason is?
Oh, hell.
Hello, DeDe. How you doing?
Oh, mostly fine.
I have something called a telescoping uterus.
long story. - Aw, jeez.
out of my way!
out of my way! - I can't breathe!
this boy can't breathe.
he's having a severe allergic reaction.
no. You're squeezing me.
he needs medicine. His throat is closing up.
okay. Hold on.
we have an allergic reaction.
a young boy. Obstructed breathing.
what happened?
well, somebody gave him some soy bacon...
that was so good, he couldn't tell the difference.
Mitchell, I can't talk right now.
cam, it's Claire. My phone died.
I just wanted to make sure the kids got to school okay.
Oh, yeah, of course they did. Why wouldn't they have?
I hear we got a boy who can't breathe? - Right here.
what was that?
Oh, I'm just watching an original lifetime movie called "The boy who can't breathe.
that sounded like Alex.
Nope. Just Amanda Bynes. Okay, gotta go.
that's weird.
can you believe how many waffle places we passed?
I can't believe how much dad belittles me.
what were there? Five? Six?
I edited the law review. I passed the bar on my first try.
I have a briefcase. - I'm counting them on the way back.
can we focus?
uh, hi. We're here for Haley Dunphy.
I'm Mitchell Pritchett. I'm miss Dunphy's attorney.
she won't be needing a lawyer today.
Oh, I think I'll be the judge of that.
I'd like to confer with my client now. Thank you.
all you have to do is post bail, and she's all yours.
Really? Oh. That--that's fantastic.
sir, I am in no mood to defend my daughter today, believe me But do you think it is the best use of resources to lock up college kids who've had a few drinks?
ma'am, your daughter was charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.
what?
you probably should have called a real lawyer, 'cause I don't... I'm not...
look, this has gotta be some kind of mistake.
our daughter's tiny. There's no way she assaulted anyone.
insulted, maybe.
WAS--WAS the cop wearing white socks and dark shoes?
cause that really sets her off.
maybe you should watch this.
stop!
put your hands where I can see 'em!
okay. Now that's very blurry footage.
how can we be sure that that's Haley?
don't you move.
don't hurt me! I'm just a student! I'm Haley Dunphy!
so hot.
hot in here-- no.
how long is this gonna take?
I should be in school. I'm missing biology right now.
you're in a hospital. Just step out into the hallway.
listen to the nurses and doctors talk.
you'll learn more about science and humanity here than you would in a classroom in an entire semester.
attention!
if there's a yogurt in the fridge that says "Theresa,
then only Theresa gets to eat it!
drama. Soak it in.
Oh, good God. - Okay, Luke, the opening is supposed to be in the back.
no way. I don't want people to see my butt.
do I have to get another shot?
are you going to cry again?
should she be here? - Okay. You know what? Nobody's getting any more shots.
we just have to wait for the swelling to go down.
all right? I'm gonna go check on a little paperwork. I'll be right back.
but if it doesn't go down, that leg might have to come off.
sweet. Take them both.
then I could get some of those blade legs and finally be able to dunk.
how you feeling, champ? What do we got here?
the patient presents bronchial inflammation, dermal pruritus, and minor angioedema.
who can tell me the cause?
it's an allergic reaction to soy.
very good.
the rest of you have a lot to learn. Let's keep moving.
stay with Luke.
what is taking so long?
well, in my experience, these things can take time.
so... settle in. This--this could be a while.
there she is.
damn it.
Oh, thank God.
you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, mom.
Oh! What the hell were you thinking?
what happened?
it's not a big deal, okay?
there was a party, and people were drinking...
so the police showed up, and everybody ran, so I did, too.
and I started climbing down this fire escape...
and then I heard a cop yell to put your hands up, so I did and I fell... onto him.
you could have been killed.
Haley, you're supposed to be an adult.
how could you do something so childish...
okay, okay, okay, okay. - And so stupid?
let's calm down. We're all a little tired and cranky.
best thing we can do right now is get out of here, go get some waffles
I don't want waffles, Phil, okay?
I'm upset and I want to deal with this.
all right, I got some bad news here.
um, this afternoon,
Haley has to appear before a disciplinary board, which will decide whether or not she gets kicked out of school.
what?
Oh, wait. Wait, no. I got that wrong.
Oh, no, I got it right!
Yes! Score. 1 for me.
it's what it sounds like.
it literally telescopes.
you see, what happens is-- - DeDe, I hate to rush this, but I'm late for a meeting.
and it's been great seeing you, but can I walk you out?
okay. Sure.
ay, Jay, it's so weird.
the moment I came through the door, the baby started kicking like crazy, like it's trying to claw its way out of me.
Bruja!
Oh, my God.
what is she doing here?
you're going to have a baby?
I don't believe it.
uh, DeDe, don't get all crazy about this.
what's happening?
her brain. It snapped.
Oh! You're going to be a father again at your age.
and here you were thinking you would just sail off into the sunset with your beautiful young wife, not a care in the world.
this is fantastic!
I think my uterus just fixed itself.
don't ask.
who lives like this?
when I had a dorm room, it was...
Oh--it was spotless.
can we just agree that girls are dirtier than boys?
what should we do? - Well, I'd like to start by picking up some of these clothes. Then
I meant about the hearing, Felix.
do we have a game plan?
I think the best thing we can do is walk in there as a family and let them know we support Haley no matter what.
at this rate, we are going to be supporting Haley for the rest of our lives.
okay. Oh, I...
I just sat on half a peach, so I-- no.
I can't do this. I'm--I'm waiting outside.
disgusting.
what are you wearing?
what? What's wrong with it?
honey, you are fighting for your future in front of a disciplinary committee, not entertaining the secret service.
in "Legally blonde," Elle won her case because she was true to herself and dressed cute.
Haley, this is real life, not an excellent movie.
honey, just put on something else, and take down the makeup.
why are you guys acting like this is my fault?
everybody was drinking, everybody ran.
I just got caught. If anything, I'm the victim here.
What?! Just stop-- just stop talking, Haley.
you're not the victim here. You're the one who screwed up!
you made one bad decision after another, and now you're about to blow everything your mother and I worked so hard to give you.
and the worst thing is, you don't seem to care.
we all got up at 3: 00 A. M. this morningto bail you out of jail!
we haven't eaten a thing, and you know what I haven't heard from you yet?
I'm sorry, mom. I screwed up, dad. Please forgive me.
now put on some real clothes.
we'll see you at the hearing. Do not be late!
come on.
where are you going?
to get that man a waffle.
there. There. Did you feel it kicking?
Oh, yes! Oh, I remember those.
Yeah, Claire kicked me as soon as she grew legs, and she didn't stop until she was 4.
not Manny.
he was so calm, I think that he was reading in there.
this is beautiful.
look at you two, having a conversation like old friends.
well, it's easier to talk to her when she's not choking me.
I'm sorry.
I went through a bad patch there when I was trying to find the right balance with my meds.
I recently discovered my cat Frances buried in the backyard.
I'm just praying that she died first.
maybe you can dogsit for the shoe-eater one day.
Oh, well, she is a... funny-looking thing.
don't listen to them. You're beautiful.
turns out Gloria being pregnant somehow made DeDe think of her as less trophy, more human.
and all the animosity she had for Gloria just wafted up in the air...
I hope you're hiring a nanny, because this one won't lift a finger.
and landed right on top of me.
I don't remember him changing a single diaper.
what's that supposed to mean?
you can't even remember killing your cat.
Oh, I don't think I did.
but I'm sure that you never changed any diapers.
it's just that you were better at it than I was.
Oh, so I guess I was better at late-night feedings and cleaning spit-up, too.
you know what?
he wouldn't help me pick up a stroller or a blanket or a bouncy chair.
Oh, well, I had to get that stuff on my own.
he was just useless.
you poor thing.
makes all sense now why you became so crazy.
right?
listen to me, Jay Pritchett.
if you don't change your useless ways, you're gonna make me crazy, too!
like DeDe!
I just love our little visits.
mom, I'm home!
Oh, hi, Manny.
DeDe. How are you?
good.
DeDe. It's me.
how are you really?
I'm on a better path.
it's a journey.
thank you for asking, Manny.
and thank you for your letters.
it's a lost art.
no one puts pen to paper anymore.
Yes, that's me.
I'm Dean Miller with admissions. This is Professor Williams.
and this is our student representative, Aidan Feldman.
nice to meet you. - Seriously?
we sit next to each other in Econ.
Oh, right. You-- - Don't.
it insults both of us.
mostly me.
move it along, Aidan.
this is a disciplinary hearing, not JDate.
you are charged with public drunkenness, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer, all of which obviously violate our school's code of conduct.
sir, if I may speak on behalf of my client...
who are you? - I'm Mitchell Pritchett,
I'm miss Dunphy's attorney.
we require students to speak for themselves.
there are no attorneys allowed. You shouldn't even be here.
what if I just sat in this chair and I was really super quiet and I just listen?
I'll allow it.
knock it off, Aidan.
miss Dunphy, is there anything you would like to say in your defense?
actually, I have no defense.
I was drinking. I am underage.
I ran from the police.
and even though it was an accident, I injured an officer.
I am very, very sorry.
I've made a lot of bad decisions since I've been here, and it's time I take some responsibility.
like sometimes in the dining hall,
I slip my pinky under the scale when they weigh my salad.
also, I've missed more morning classes than I've been to.
she's kidding. - I don't know what the policy is on dating T. A.S, but I think I broke it.
twice. - Oh, man.
Oh, and if we're gonna be completely honest, on my application to get in here, - I lied about the fact that I was-- - Uh, objection!
on what grounds? - Oh, he gets to say it?! He gets to
miss Dunphy, miss Dunphy, we appreciate your... candor.
is there anything else you'd like to add?
go, Wildcats?
Oh, boy.
that's not even our mascot.
what does this do?
I don't know, but thanks to Obama, you're paying for it.
Hey. You're looking a lot better. How you feeling?
better than kidney stones over there.
Yeah, you know what? Now that you're doing better,
I think I should call your mom and tell her what happened.
you know, I know it was a bit of a rough ride in the beginning, but the important thing is, is I handled it.
and everybody's okay. - What happened to her?
Hello? - She passed out watching a C-Section.
never mind!
what are you looking for?
nothing! I am making a lot of noise because I'm angry!
Gloria, I'm gonna help you with the baby.
I am not young like with Manny.
I am tired already, and it's gonna get harder from here!
I can't do this on my own, and you did this to me, so you're going to be here this time!
back then, we were living paycheck to paycheck.
the reason I wasn't around is I was working all the time.
believe me, DeDe wasn't the only one having sleepless nights.
but now it's different.
now I can help you with everything.
Really?
let's start right now.
I like that one. Which one?
that silver stroller.
no, we're going to get the green one.
great. What's next?
how about I pick out the wrong crib?
how you doing, Alex?
I'm fine, except for the crushing blow of knowing I'll never be a doctor.
or have a baby.
I wonder what's going on with Haley.
I don't know.
I've been so petty about your mom judging my parenting,
I haven't even thought about what she's going through today.
I feel awful. You know what? I should call her.
what are you talking about? Mom thinks you're a great parent.
she does?
Yeah, she just thinks you can't bake.
Hello?
never mind.
making a child is the easy part.
the hard part is everything that comes after.
keeping them safe...
well, you can tell your mother that my scones are appropriately crunchy on the outside while delightfully dense on the ins
saw that. Saw it.
making sacrifices for them...
Hey, kid.
I'll take you to that poetry reading thing tonight.
actually, DeDe and I were just talking.
she's a huge fan of spoken word...
and I would love to escort him.
please. - Go.
and standing by them, even when they let you down.
I really am sorry.
we appreciate that.
it's good that you stepped up today.
Yeah. Sometimes it's healthy to get a fresh start.
Ugh. I can't believe this. What am I gonna do?
well, they said you could reapply next year.
in the meantime, you're gonna get a job and you're gonna take some classes.
well, I'm gonna buckle down and get a lot more serious.
good for you. - Yeah.
where are my keys?
Oh, they're right there on the makeup table.
Oh, honey...That's a desk.
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
I got kicked out.
so go ahead, make your jokes. Get it out of your system.
no, that's horrible. I'm so sorry.
it'll be fine. I'm sure of it.
thank you.
EW, what did you do to my room?!
well, it's not exactly your room. It's--it's mine.
this goes. This goes. I hate that.
this is ugly. - Haley, stop!
mom! - Mom!
what is this? A solar system?
it's molecules.
they're nerdy balls.
Alex, don't fight with her. She might have a shiv.
we cool?
mom, I'm not 12.
dibs on hers.
honey, you excited about your first day?
you know what? I really am.
there's something about going to work that makes you feel like you're...
I don't know, worth something.
no offense, mom.
listen... I wanna give you some advice.
do it fast. She's gonna be late.
work hard.
keep your eye on the ball.
stay focused.
never... Check it out! M overaras!
Mitchell sent me the same text!
why "look what you've done"?
Oh, because cam is helping me out with that baseball field, and mitchell hates it when he gets all farmed up.
his turn-offs are farm, fizbo, and, worst of all, farmbo.
Hey! Howdy, life pardner!
well, I gotta go.
don't wanna be late for my first - Oh, my god!
why didn't you guys tell me the time?!
so what do you think?
can we turn this into a baseball field?
Oh, yeah. No problem.
you know, back on the farm,
I once turned an acre of corn into a snowflake-shaped maze.
it'd still be there if our neighbor billy bob sheinberg hadn't seen it from his crop duster and said it looked like a swastika.
so how good's luke's team anyway?
well, you may have seen them on youtube under "boy stuck in batting helmet" or "pitcher beans self.
but a few of them went through puberty early this year, so...
they say it's because of hormones in our milk.
but whatever it is, they really jacked up.
Luke and manny's team tied for the final spot in the playoffs, but since nobody was expecting it, all the fields were booked.
the other team wanted to settle with a coin flip.
we said "rock paper scissors.
that's when talks broke down.
so what do you do when you can't find a field?
you build one.
and we got the last laugh,'cause guess what I found there?
rocks, paper, and scissors.
I see home plate up here.
I see pitcher's mound in here, and I see little boys' dreams coming true everywhere.
I found a dead snake!
it's perfect.
not dead! Not dead!
I'm gonna be mother of the year.
and this is our dining room, where we eat.
and this is our kitchen, where we also eat.
who are you talking to? It looks like you lost your tour.
or your mind.
the baby. Shorty's girlfriend darlene send it to me.
she said it's for prenatal bonding.
I love it. We took a tour of the house.
we took a look at all my shoes.
come on, jay. Say something to the baby.
Darlene's an idiot.
Oh, yeah, beautiful.
your first words to our baby - "darlene is an idiot.
this is stupid. The baby's only 2 inches away.
he doesn't need speakers blasting at him.
like in restaurants nowadays where you can't even hear yourself think.
Ah, you're gonna do whatever you want. Why do I bother?
get used to that.
sometimes you just gotta let him go.
then he eats some sherbet and falls asleep.
okay, I'll chalk the field with this bad boy.
and while you're doing that, I will get the bases.
we make such a good team.
why does your friend have a chalker?
Oh, he used it to propose to a skywriter.
Oh, ma'am?
ma'am, do you need help with that?
Oh, yes. Please.
is this your house?
I'm moving in with my son.
he's rich.
phone by the toilet rich.
all... - right, so have you lived here a long time?
I moved here in '62 to be an actress.
I had one line in a "rockford files.
he went out the back. - oh!
who went out the back?
that was you. Okay.
well, you're all set here.
you're not interested in the place, are you?
Oh, no, thank you. - Yes...yes, we are.
Yes. Yes, we are.
come on. - Okay.
you gotta keep your eyes open.
it's not natural when a ball is hurtling at your face.
will you choke up a little?
probably when they play the national anthem.
no, move your hands up the bat.
when they play the national anthem.
I had a perfect record...22 games, and I hadn't played a single inning.
then the mccoy twins' grandma dies, and suddenly I'm starting at right field.
what does that even mean?
is it the same as stage right?
all right, ready? Nice and easy.
I haven't even thrown it yet.
then it's your fault.
I'm doing my part.
forget it. We need to do something different.
let's change your stance. Try leaning in.
further. Now close your eyes.
perfect! You think you can do that every time?
what, get hit on purpose?
if you wanna get on base and be a hero.
some men are born into greatness.
others have it chucked at their face.
Yes!
okay, Mrs. Brooks, thank you very much.
we'll be in touch very soon.
say it one more time.
he went out the back.
Oh, love it! Love it!
Brava! Brava! - Bye-bye!
what do you think, phil?
well, I have to admit, it's a steal.
Yes! Yes! I told you!
and you said gil thorpe makes a killing flipping houses.
Yeah, he brags about it all the time.
every time he makes a sale, he calls himself "flipper
and walks around making this dolphin sound.
like... How does he do it?
I hate him so much.
okay, look, if the four of us go in on this together, we can minimize the risk.
or if none of us do it, we can eliminate the risk altogether because none of you know anything about flipping houses.
okay, well, we already have it figured out.
I'm gonna be the designer...
because I know about colors and shapes.
Yeah, so does lily.
I'm gonna be the contractor.
and I'm gonna be the astronaut.
Oh, this is fun. Phil, you go.
Mitchell, I am serious.
I have overseen lots of projects in our home.
I oversaw the remodel of our bathroom.
under budget. Right, phil?
Yeah. I was a little disappointed we didn't go for the butt-washing toilet, but otherwise...
you can wash your own butt for free.
well, that's not the same, is it?
this is all fun to talk about.
it is, but I don't think that you understand what-what this could really entail.
and - Okay, there it is.
Mitchell just said "no," so we're done. Surprise, surprise.
listen, we'll talk about this at home, okay?
so... Don't give up.
Phil, you think it's a good idea, right? - Totally.
Yes. And you know we can handle it, right?
I think you guys can handle anything.
Yeah. And you go talk to him.
you're a professional. He respects you.
okay. Give us some space.
I'll go talk him into it.
all right. - All right?
okay. - Okay.
listen... There's no way we're letting them do this.
I know, right?
they are not equipped to take this on.
we might as well flush all our savings down my boring old toilet.
Oh, you are really bitter about that.
it's the one thing I asked for.
don't sit on your sunglasses.
sorry, guys.
just to be clear, though.
under no circumstances are we letting them do this?
I am totally with you.
okay, you stay here. I'll go break the bad news.
sorry, guys. Not gonna happen.
Yeah, well, maybe if... - I would drop it.
it's not worth the fight.
come on, claire.
the faster we leave, the less it's gonna hurt.
hop in. Yep.
why does it have to be like this?
I don't know. He's your brother.
buckled up? Good.
Yeah.
No! No! No, no, I see what you're doing!
he doesn't want this either!
little radio? - Sure.
Phil! Claire! Come on!
it's such a shame because I know we would do a great job on that house.
totally. - If gil thorpe can do it, I can do it, right?
please!
please.
Gil thorpe has decades of experience and infallible instincts.
as much as we'd all like to believe otherwise, I did not marry gil thorpe.
can you imagine that?
God, We'd sell a lot of houses.
Oh! Great. Mitchell.
Oh, you know what, claire?
you gotta cool down or you're just gonna make this worse.
why don't you go get the coffees? And I'll deal with him.
well, okay, what are you gonna say to him?
I'm just gonna talk to him man-to-man.
MNH. Right. - Okay.
Hello?
Claire, phil doesn't want the house either, all right?
he's letting me take the fall. He's a liar.
and a clever one.
how long do you think you can keep this from her?
all right? I'm gonna talk to her eventually.
well, as long as we're swapping stories, maybe I'll tell cam what happened to the sweater he knit for you.
I can't. I can't! I can't! I can't do it!
I can't take this stupid thing anymore!
it was stolen out of the car.
do you understand me? - Got it.
that is low.
I know. Don't be mad at me.
that said, I suggest you lose this number.
I'm not proud of what I did, but I'm not comfortable squashing people's dreams.
I am a cheerleader.
I'm the guy on top of the pyramid shouting,"go, dreams, go!
you know what's not a cheer?
two, four, six, eight, you are going to fail at this and lose everything we've worked for, claire!
hush, little baby don't say a word.
Papa's going to buy you a mockingbird.
and if that mockingbird won't sing.
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.
papa'd buy ten diamond rings to get that mockingbird to shut the hell up.
but I wasn't gonna tell gloria she was a terrible singer.
that's just taking a bath with a toaster.
still, the thought of that poor little thing stuck in there like a hostage, listening to that racket days on end...
I just couldn't take it.
and if that billy goat won't push.
Papa's gonna get every le...
I'll tell you what papa's gonna do.
he's gonna take a turn on that mic.
Oh! Really?
Yeah, I've been thinking, if it's a chance to bond, I should take it.
ay, jay, that's great.
I think that the sound of my voice shouldn't be the only thing that the baby should hear.
same page.
breaker, breaker, big jay. Baby, what's your 20? Over.
ay, that's so cute. You sound like smokey and the bandito.
go on. Go on.
Hi, kid. This is your dad jay pritchett.
uh, we're all pretty excited to meet you.
just a heads-up...I might be a few years older than you're expecting.
but on the plus side, we're very comfortable.
what's that? Nothin'?
tough womb.
what are you doing in there? You sleepin'?
are you sleeping?
still daddy's turn.
dumb-dumb rock!
are you cryin'?
no.
no. I just can't get this rock to budge.
okay, what did we learn from "a league of their own"?
no crying in baseball.
no. That madonna's a lousy actress, and so are you.
what's really going on?
okay.
you know, over the last couple of months,
I've applied for, like, five different jobs.
I didn't know that.
no. I didn't tell anyone, because I didn't get them, cam.
I went to college, you know?
and... I just wanna be able to contribute to my kids' education.
and I wanna be able to buy my husband a present... With my own money.
Hey, you're preaching to the choir director.
it's actually why I became a choir director.
you became a part-time teacher in a public school for money?
I make more than you do.
I mean, before parking. But...
look, I'm sorry mitchell killed our house dream.
you know, now especially that I know you wanted to use the money for such noble reasons.
Yeah. And also... There was this pair of boots.
there's always a pair of boots.
Mitchell, do you know what I've realized?
that some thoughts are better left unexpressed?
no. That in this relationship, i'm the gas pedal, and you're the brakes.
okay, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
last week, you said that you were the painting and I was the frame.
that's if we were artwork.
this is if we were a car.
I know what part you'd be if we were a horse.
excuse me? - What?
Claire and I bring you this great opportunity, and you stop it cold.
I guess that's what brakes do.
you know what brakes also do?
they keep you from driving off cliffs.
maybe they're not cliffs.
maybe they're ramps, ready to launch us into new, exciting vistas.
I am not the only one against this whole house thing.
Phil doesn't want it either.
you keep saying that, but I find that very, very hard to believe.
Phil supports claire.
Phil is a cheerleader.
why can't you be more like phil?
and then it hit me. I could be exactly like phil.
I could pretend to be on board, forcing the cheerleader to be the bad guy.
I know it's underhanded, but that's the way I throw.
Mitchell? - You-you know what?
you've convinced me.
if-if you and claire and especially phil are into this, then I'm on board.
what? Seriously?! - Yes! 100%.
in fact, why don't you call claire and phil right now and tell them?
okay. - Yeah.
it was the ramp thing, wasn't it?
you know, I felt really good about it. - Yeah.
what? Are you serious?
that's fantastic!
I gotta tell phil.
I'll call you right back.
what's-what's up?
Mitchell changed his mind. He's all for it.
we're flipping a house!
Yeah. - Yeah!
well, hello, phil.
to what do I owe this pleasure?
cut the crap. You wanna play chicken? Chicken's my middle name.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just being supportive of my partner and my sister, both of whom I love very much.
how do you sleep at night?
soundly, knowing you'll do the right thing.
so how about it, phil?
you gonna stop this train?
cause these brakes are out.
and I suggest you lose this number.
Yeah, I was pretty ticked off that mitchell double-crossed my double-cross.
and then he stopped taking my calls, and so I sent him the following carefully worded text...
U suck.
I could tell phil felt pretty hurt... And betrayed, so I responded.
how r u gonna cheerlead your way out of this one, buffy?
we both know this house thing is a disaster.
then say something, or I will. I don't care if you tell cam...
I threw out that hideous sweater"?!
I spent months knitting that hideous sweater. - Yeah.
how are we seeing this?
they're using the group text from yesterday.
they have no idea these are even coming to me.
okay.
here's another one.
we need to shut this house thing down without them knowing it's us"?!
well... "2 late."
no, that-that's bad.
Claire, I am so sorry.
I know I should've been more honest with you, but I...
no, phil. You know what really kills me?
is you didn't believe in me, and you believe in everything!
you know, I knew that sweater wasn't stolen.
and here I pick blue yarn to match your eyes, but I should've picked black to match your heart.
although you look amazing in black. Damn you.
come on.
... Leaving 17 dead and thousands without power.
ay, jay, please!
it's bad that the baby listens to such terrible things.
he's heard worse.
Jay, do you know a good 1-hour dry cleaner?
and I don't mean the "must be in by 10: 00, only on weekdays, you need a coupon" kind. I mean a hard 1-hour.
this conversation feels like a hard one hour.
and what do you need it cleaned for? It's spotless.
there's mustard here from reuben's reuben.
that's what happens when you put a narcissist in charge of snack day.
okay, it's my turn again.
baby, it's your mother again.
I'm... - Gloria? Why don't we give him a break?
he probably needs a minute because he just learned about a deadly tornado.
okay, stop calling him a he.
what if he's a she, and you're making her upset?
I told you. That's just the shorthand I'm using.
don't jump down my throat every time I'm... - Ay, yes, because you always...
you think that... - What are you doing?
do you really want your unborn baby to hear you fighting like this?
studies show it's unhealthy for a fetus to be exposed to a stressful environment.
studies? You're 13. Read a comic book.
what time does your game start?
I have to be there at 3: 00 for hitting practice.
batting practice. - Not for me.
Jay, I don't want our baby to think that it's coming into an unhappy home.
let's promise that we're never ever going to fight in front of him.
no fighting in front of the baby. - Okay, good.
twinkle, twinkle little lamb.
I am going to...
Gloria, stop it! Stop it. No more singing.
Why? Because you stink.
you're a terrible singer.
come on. Let's get some lunch.
how dare do you say that I am... - I know!
ay, no, no, no. No fighting in front of the baby.
we just made a deal.
Yeah, but that's not fair because I am always in front of the baby!
Gloria, you're as close to perfect as woman gets.
nothing wrong with one tiny, little flaw.
yours is when you start to sing, is sounds like something got stuck in the vacuum cleaner.
that's you're just... - Ah! Ah! Ah! No, no, no.
that is just your... Stupid, stupid opinion, jay.
but I am very angry at you, and I am gonna make a list of all the things that I am going to scream at you as soon as this baby's out of me.
I didn't think it all the way through.
Oh, hello, mitch.
uh, you got claire flowers?
Yes. I had a little bit of a rough night.
Yeah, you and me both.
daddy slept in my room last night.
here, give me some of those. - What? No.
you got me into this. - Hey, stop! You're breaking them!
I need-i'm not going to cam empty-handed!
Phil, let go of the... - Stop it!
hold still!
Claire and cam did all this?
a week ago, that was all junk.
it's amazing.
I mean, there's that little bump in the middle.
but other than that...
even if one of those boys had hit five home runs, the biggest star on that field was claire.
that's the funny thing about marriage.
you fall in love with this... Extraordinary person, and over time, they begin to seem ordinary.
I think it's all the nagging.
this... This is incredible.
you literally saw a diamond in the rough.
Yeah, but I take on a lot of projects no one else is willing to.
I deserve that.
I was an idiot for doubting you.
please, honey, forgive me.
how could I not, when you give me this bouquet of crumpled flowers?
Mitchell did that!
Mitchell again?
ask lily!
Hey, cam. - Hey.
here you...okay.
well... - Oh. Broken and mangled...
just like my heart.
cam, I'm sorry for not supporting you.
what about the sweater?
that's unforgivable.
I mean, you put all that time and work into it, and I just toss it out the car window.
tossed it out the car window?!
I'm forgetting how much you knew.
you know what, guys?
honestly, I... I think we should do it.
I think we should go for the house.
Really? - Okay, but careful, honey.
don't say something if you don't mean it.
no, I do mean it. I think you two will do a fantastic job.
you know, I do, too. I'm on board.
on board for what?
Oh, well, the four of us, uh, might go in on a house.
Claire and I fix it up and flip it.
that's the worst idea I ever heard.
okay. You guys know nothing about construction.
you'll make all sorts of mistakes, you'll turn on each other, you'll stop talking, and suddenly I'm doing two dinners a week instead of one because you can't be in the same room.
family and business doesn't mix.
Ah, you're gonna do whatever you want. Why do I bother?
is he right?
y... you know dad. I mean, he's a pessimist.
I want us to get that house. I do.
but I don't want us to fight.
we're not gonna fight.
of course not. Probably.
I don't know. Will we?
maybe we just take a beat and think about it.
Yeah. - Yeah.
I...I guess that couldn't hurt. - Yeah.
you guys mean the world to us.
I don't want to jeopardize that over a house.
we feel the same way. - I know.
I just wanna say I know we'd do a good job, though.
Hello?
and I feel so - it's Mrs. Brooks, the lady with the house.
actually, it's good that you called.
what? - What happened?
Gil thorpe just made her an offer.
we did it! - We bought a house.
it's gonna be... Great!
what could go wrong? - Nothing.
sometimes I don't understand people.
they do crazy things for the dumbest reasons.
I'm going to march out there and swing as hard as I can.
and if every sports movie is correct, i'm going to smack that ball, and everyone will chant my name as I round the bases.
by the way, it is always counterclockwise, or do I get to choose?
I don't think it's gonna matter.
they convince themselves it'll all work out...
please rise for the national anthem.
I'm gonna show you who can sing.
Oh, this is gonna be rough.
despite all the evidence to the contrary.
which I guess isn't so bad.
all I'm saying is,
I hope to god you don't have your mother's singing voice.
but, man, I hope you get her self-confidence.
try to get some sleep. I'll talk to you in the morning.
2 outs, bottom of the sixth.
tied at 4.
this is it, folks.
the whole game comes down to this.
Manny delgado 0 for 3 on the day.
Gloria, your thoughts?
I think he's going to hit the home run.
please, god, give me one.
Manny, stand up straight!
but bend your knees.
widen your stance!
would you please let me just...
take your base!
what? - You did it!
you got it, manny!
no, no, no, no! Not that way!
wrong way! Go this way!
Oh, why do I bother? He's gonna do what he wants.
we got a package from my dad.
no air holes in the box. That's a good sign.
Lily loved having that chicken.
one more time than she realized.
listen, I just got an e-mail from our wedding singer.
he has a small request. - Another one?
since when does the wedding singer send us requests?
well, no, he just wants to change a few songs in your medley to avoid overlap with the stuff that he's performing.
well, I hope it's none of my showstoppers.
Oh, they're all showstoppers.
Oh, you're too kind.
Oh, my gosh, it's us.
for our wedding cake.
couldn't you just die?
I really think I could.
my dad made this. He's a world-class soap carver.
you know, once, when I was a kid, I cussed, and my mom washed my mouth out with the leaning Tower of Pisa.
she still blames herself to this day.
Oh, I would have nixed that wedding topper immediately, but Cam and I have an agreement.
we... we each got three vetoes of each other's wedding ideas...
no questions asked.
and it... it worked for... a while.
I think you're gonna love my wedding board.
I'm pretty excited, too.
veto. - Veto.
veto. - Veto.
veto. - Veto.
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.
it's just the nicest thing ever.
you don't think that I look just a little bit...
I mean, my dad carved through his arthritis!
maybe it's the kicky leg.
I mean, the hours his ruined hands put into this.
he found us in soap.
today, Mitchell, I know love.
I no love, either.
so, take your time looking around.
Thanks.
I'm helping Gloria sell the old apartment that she and Manny lived in before she met Jay.
it's in an up-and-coming neighborhood with a distinct multicultural bent that's undergoing an exciting urban renewal.
that's a fancy way of saying "the gays found it.
I can't believe that I lived here for five years.
even turning the lights on was a pain.
look at this.
keep it down, you bitch!
ay. Mrs. Rivera's still alive.
I am really digging this place.
right? The gas stove, the moldings...
they don't make 'em like this anymore.
I'll probably gut it.
rip it out. That's what I'd do.
I want my contractor to swing by, but I really like it.
great. All right. Thanks.
Bye-bye. - Talk to you soon.
so nice to meet you.
I'm not selling to him.
what? Really?
he's a quality buyer.
you're tired of finding renters.
this is a family building.
generations have lived there, and usually at the same time.
he just wants to flip it.
okay.
I got a backup I can probably get here in an hour.
you want to wait in there?
you walk in that door, you never come out.
no, no, not the bar... the coffee shop.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
but we can wait next door.
that's my old hair salon where I used to work.
you can get drinks there, too.
how are you doing, girls?
you finally brought Jay so we can meet him!
no, no, no, no. This is not Jay.
Ah, so you got yourself a lover.
give it to me when you're done with him!
so mean! - What's so funny?
what's so funny?
she thinks you're my lover.
that is funny!
I don't know if it's "a room full of women laughing" funny, but...
ay, Rita, no.
Phil is a friend of mine, and we're just killing time before an appointment.
I hate to ask, Gloria, but my new girl hasn't shown up.
any chance you could help?
ay, of course!
it will be so much fun!
Oh! I don't want to ruin my nails.
Phil, would you do my shampooing?
well, I-I guess so. We've got the time.
just a warning...I haven't shampooed professionally since college, and that was only part-time to pay for my cheer gear.
Wow. That was super-braggy.
what do we got, double sinks? What's the nozzle sitch?
not to sound too braggy, but your mom was kind of a badass at work this week.
it was hard enough with grandpa being sick and me suddenly in charge, but it was just one crisis after another.
Luke, honey, we're going!
fire in the warehouse, surprise inspection from Osha, our biggest buyer tried to pull out of a deal, and I have to talk him off a ledge.
whatever. It's over now.
I don't want to bore you guys with this stuff.
so, when I get to work on Wednesday, Margaret is already in tears, and there are two cops in the waiting room, and I say to them, "One of you had better be able to drive an 18-wheeler, because I've got 100 rosewood panels to get to Victorville, or it's coming out of my paycheck.
I told you guys about the drivers and the bad tuna?
bad tuna, yes. - Yeah. Yes, I did.
Hey, mom, I forgot how fun this car was.
and these automatic doors and that TV in the back.
you know what else was fun?
the party they threw for me at work on Friday.
I mean, it was a little bit embarrassing.
I didn't even know "she-ro" was a word, and there it was, in icing.
Hello, hello!
welcome to Jay's night. Names, please.
want to make sure you're on the list. Kidding! Just excited.
appetizers on the bar, scrabble on the coffee table, and our feature presentation, "The Great Escape.
speaking of which, Haley...
don't worry, grandpa. I'm not leaving.
I have no plans for the night.
me, either.
but when I say it, it's news.
when you say any complete sentence, it's news.
okay, girls. Dad, you feeling better?
you had a rough week, huh?
Nah. I'm fine.
looks like you had a big week.
you heard about that?
Yeah, I got the blow-by-blow on all the office drama.
by the way, sincerely... - Yeah?
...great...
great guacamole on the bar, there.
Wow. That's it?
everything you did for him, and he doesn't even say "thank you"?
I get it.
it's "hero" with a "she.
okay, I'm up to speed.
Yeah, that was cold.
it's just his way.
after years of disappointment,
I have learned not to expect a pat on the head from my dad.
he's not capable of it.
but it has taught me a very important lesson that you girls should learn, too...
approval comes from within.
I knew that, mom.
course you did, 'cause you're smart.
Hey, is Lily out of the tub? We got to be at my dad's soon.
Oh, no!
it's not that big of a deal. We can be a little late.
No! Lily had the cake topper in the tub with her!
Oh, no. How could such a terrible mistake have occurred?
I think she must have just thought it was a toy or something.
well, I hope it's not completely ruined forever.
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
my daddy uses a special shellac on this thing.
this is water-resistant, heat-resistant... you name it.
good to know. - Yeah, but put it someplace safe.
it could still be slippery, so be careful.
is it? Oh, yeah, it is! It's slippery!
is it okay?
not a scratch.
apparently, I'm tougher than I look.
Hey, boys. Having fun?
you know it. Love us some Jay's night.
okay, we're out of here.
Kristy Hughes, AKA "Kristy Huge Ones,
is having a pool party two blocks away.
what about Jay? He thinks we're at a party.
he'll never know.
we sneak out, work the room, cannonball, cannonball, and we're back in time for dinner.
were you even invited? - No.
but that's only because I don't know her or any of her friends.
we're not invading her house.
besides, this hair at a pool party...
one dunk, and it goes off like an airbag. Poof!
what's this? You made sauce?
well, you were sick. I didn't know if you could handle it.
back in Vietnam, I had hepatitis.
still managed to cook Thanksgiving dinner for 300 soldiers.
I think I can handle sauce.
well, I saved you the trouble.
so, Margaret tells me I'm using some new delivery trucks now.
Yeah. They're hybrid.
now, they cost a little more, but when I factored in the tax rebates you get for going green, we come out ahead.
speaking of "green,"you went a little heavy on the vegetables, huh?
I'm not sure I can stomach anything that's healthy.
gosh, mom, that truck thing sounds so amazing.
Yeah!
it's fine, dad.
only do what we're capable of, right?
Oh, damn. No, Stella, stay. No.
good girl.
thank you, Stella.
thank you for listening.
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
who's my best girl?
don't.
okay, girls, we are ready for Scrabble.
I'll grab some snacks.
uh, potato chips, please.
Oh, so I can hear about how much you hate yourself all night?
Hello, Luke.
come on! We've got to go!
that party's full of sophomores.
those women have lived.
no, we're going back inside, we're eating Jay's food, and we're playing his board games.
more like boring games.
they're already called "board." You don't make it more clever by...
never mind.
okay. Thanks.
did you work everything out with the wedding singer?
Oh, yeah... I'm just dropping my big finale because he's doing the same song.
my Way? - His way.
Hey, guys. Sorry we're late, but we come with wine.
and whittlin'!
check it out. This is a beautiful gift my father made for the top of our wedding cake.
I guess he ran out of soap before he got to me.
Darn. - For you.
ladies, check out your Uncle Mitch and Cam in soap.
Oh, wow! That's soap?
it's beautiful.
this is my worst nightmare.
you shouldn't have blown through those vetoes.
this is how Cam's dad sees me... like some fawning damsel.
if anything, Cam's the damsel. - Dad!
thank you.
a lot can happen before the big day.
believe me, I've already tried.
that thing is indestructible.
what if it went missing?
things disappear around here all the time.
do they?
all the time.
let's just say I have a friend who helps me in these kinds of situations.
I'm listening.
the less you know, the better.
I'm not listening.
we never had this conversation.
this is a non-versation.- Right.
I am giving you the... no-ahead.
remember when I put a sausage in my bag when I was coming back from Barranquilla?
Oh, I miss you girls.
nobody in my white family thinks that I am funny.
honey, Hector had a life before he met you.
so I have to eat dinner with his ex?
well, you certainly don't want him going alone...not with his history.
Hey. Who are you really mad at?
ay, I don't know.
come on, Luisa.
Hector's going to hurt me just like Raul did!
there it is.
but Hector isn't Raul, okay?
they're just cousins.
we need to get a move on.
the client's gonna come over to the apartment at 4: 00.
I am swamped. I can't just leave.
Gloria, we're here to sell your apartment.
we don't work at the salon.
thank you very much, Bianca.
don't you text him any more.
it's for a young couple with a baby on the way.
they're not flippers.
they're looking for a place to settle down and make a home.
okay, just move them.
if they really want it, they'll come back.
but, Gloria...
ay, please, just help me with Anna's foils.
I have a weave emergency!
something's not right. - What? What happened?
no, no, no, not with you. You look great.
you know who's gonna hate this, is a certain jealous sister.
cinco de my, oh, my.
how am I supposed to do this with so many I's on my rack?
Oh! Sorry.
Where's Luke? How long does it take him to get the dictionary?
we described it for him perfectly.
wait a minute. He's not coming back.
Ugh. Move your S.
I-I'm going as fast as I can.
Mitchell! It's gone!
what is?
the cake topper.
Lily, have you seen the little daddies you were bathing with earlier?
EW. Don't say that.
I saw Stella playing with it.
what?
Oh, look at her. She's all muddy.
she must have brought it outside and buried it.
she does it all the time!
Oh, no. We have to go find it.
good luck. That thing's as good as gone.
dang it! Oh!
and the worst part is, we don't even have a picture of it.
do we? - Okay, we can't give up.
let's go out into the yard and look for it.
careful. I wouldn't come between Stella and anything she's buried.
she's a wild animal. No telling what she'll do.
that's a very aggressive stance.
Luke! Wait!
Oh. Look at that.
you left your yard, and your little shock collar didn't go off.
Luke... - Okay, so, here's the new plan.
you hang back while I break the ice, and then, when the time is right...
Manny! You made it!
who's this?
who's this?
excuse me, Kristy Huge Ones, I have a name.
okay, come on. Stop. I'm tired of chasing you all day.
then don't.
stay as long as you want at that lame party.
you want to talk?
you're the dorky sidekick, not me.
want to talk nicer?
how could you be invited and I wasn't?
I don't know.
it's like the stuff that used to make me kind of weird, people are starting to like.
so?
I'm the same as I always was.
well... maybe you could upgrade a little.
uh, we're tired of the Yoda voice, and if a girl tells you she went to London, maybe don't ask if she also saw France.
I liked things better when you were the one who was ostrich-sized.
what?
you know, like a freaky outsider...
the way an ostrich feels around regular birds.
you know what else girls like?
the mysterious, silent type.
what are you doing with my sauce, there, cookie?
that's yours. This is mine.
I prepped it this morning. I figured, why not make it?
um... maybe because I already made sauce?
can't have too much. - Can't ya?
hand me that ladle, huh?
what are you doing? I got it.
what do you say? - What?
what do you say when somebody does something for you?
what do you say?
you want me to thank you for handing me a ladle?
you thanked the dog for staying...
which is basically doing nothing...so I know you know the words.
fine. Thank you for handling me the ladle.
you sure those are ready?
you didn't throw one against the wall.
Oh, dad, nobody does that anymore.
Oh. I guess we have new ways for doing everything now, huh?
no. I didn't say that.
I'm just saying that you can taste your food instead of flinging it at the wall like a chimp.
okay.
how's it taste?
actually, mm, that's pretty good.
but it could use a little, um... sauce.
let me just... ooh, hot.
try a little Parmesan with that?
I should probably get that bread in the oven.
just...
okay! Hey!
Hey, how about we take over in here while you two get cleaned up for dinner?
Yes, good idea.
Yeah. Okay.
approval comes from within.
thank you.
your sauce needs garlic.
okay. - Okay.
and that's a clock.
okay, well, do another one. I've done like four.
this dog is a worse hoarder than your Uncle Clayton.
he's a collector.
of expired yogurt?
getting tired.
cam, can we just stop, please?
I feel like we've done our best, - but we're just not gonna find it. - Found it!
Yay! Oh! Good.
thank God. I hadn't even told you my biggest plan for this yet.
bigger than the top of our wedding cake?
I'm gonna have a mold made of it and give a reproduction to everyone who comes to the wedding and everyone who can't come to the wedding.
imagine hundreds of these across the country.
No! No! No! Absolutely not!
I hate it! It's awful!
I knew it!
I knew it!
it just shows up in Lily's bath, and then, all of a sudden, the dog has it?
you have it in for this beautiful topper.
look at this. Look at it. Look at it!
come on, you're all heroic and Paul Bunyan-y, and I'm... I'm, like, some sissy man with... with pinkish cheeks and a turned-out heel.
it's a caricature.
what matters is what it represents.
my daddy making this for us means he's accepted us for who we are!
don't you get that?
I never really thought about it that way.
no. You hadn't.
I'm just being sensitive.
I need to have a thicker skin.
I-I'm really, really sorry.
no, don't... don't... don't be sorry.
no. And I... n... I don't want something at the wedding that makes you uncomfortable.
well, no, that doesn't seem fair.
I've used up all my vetoes.
well, if it...
I guess, if it makes you feel better,
I could give you one more veto...
if you give me one more, too.
okay, sure.
and in the future, if there's anything...
the wedding singer.
okay. Thanks, daddy. I'll send you the perfect picture to model it on.
after today, I'm convinced our landfills are 10% hair.
Oh, yes.
I forgot how exhausting this is.
well, all we have to do is meet the clients back at the apartment, and then we can head home.
ay, no. I'm too tired now.
let's reschedule.
Really? Again?
Yes. Let's meet them next week.
and besides, we're late for Jay's party.
well, I'm not letting you go home looking like this.
you're a little ratty back here.
ay, no.
no, no, no. I got it. Yep.
you just relax.
what a day, huh?
being back here must bring up a lot of memories.
Oh, yeah.
maybe even some emotions.
Yeah. It feels weird.
no, weird's an adjective, not an emotion, but go on.
well, it's just that my life now is so different than before...
so much easier.
and that makes you feel...?
good.
and also...?
and bad.
Why?
I don't know.
come on, now, Gloria.
I don't know. I guess it just makes me feel a little ashamed.
now, what in the world do you have to be ashamed of?
it's just that, you know, before, when I used to live here,
I used to work for every penny.
I would stand on my own two feet.
now I just stand on expensive shoes that Jay buys for me.
is that why it's so hard to let go of the apartment?
no, Phil, it's not that... - Gloria.
maybe.
Yes. It's the last piece of the old me.
no, no! You're going too deep!
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but I think you're looking at this all wrong.
the old you hasn't gone anywhere.
I-I-I see it in the way you're raising Manny and Joe, the way you care for Jay.
you never take anyone or anything for granted.
you worked hard for years without knowing that things were gonna get better.
and then the universe rewarded you.
there's nothing to be ashamed of.
so you're not mad at me because I don't want to sell the apartment?
no.
you'll know when you're ready, and I'll be here.
you're the best.
there's no one like you.
Mnh-mnh. Yuck.
Claire, that looks so good.
I can't wait to try it. - Thank you.
something has happened here.
well, you'll all be happy to know that our search for the cake topper unearthed a number of family treasures.
come on, Cam. We're eating over here.
wait.
didn't I give you this for Father's Day?
and that.
you see how this dog is?
my karaoke microphone.
Jay, check it out! The other walkie-talkie!
shame on you, Jay Pritchett!
you have used this dog to bury the things that you hate.
what? - Yeah!
since when do you need help burying things?
calm down. She buries stuff of mine too. Look.
everybody at the office bought me this clock last month.
honey, what's the matter with you?
that's a question that maybe you should answer. - Oh, my gosh! My headphones!
that's the worst.
here's to 40 years in the business.
enjoy your new timer, old-timer.
suddenly, it made sense.
in my dad's mind,
I was reaching for a torch he wasn't ready to pass.
sure, someday, I'm gonna take over his business, but not tonight.
tonight is still Jay's night.
so, dad...
turns out, I did have a bunch of questions for you last week, but I didn't want to bother you with them.
I didn't want you to think I couldn't handle it.
there's no shame in asking for help.
you can always call.
well, I won't need to.
you'll be in the office down the hall, right?
right.
Goldilocks to Papa Bear. Goldilocks to Papa Bear.
come in, Papa Bear.
this is Papa Bear.
on location in the garage, Papa Bear.
got some cocoa with your name on it. What's your 20?
Oh, what the hell? - What's going on?
the kids unfriended me again.
how am I supposed to know what's going on in their lives if they never talk to me?
honey...
I got this.
Yeah. It's been kind of a rough year.
new school, new kids, and now I'm taking advice about girls from a kid who has his own shoe buffer.
What?!
I tried beer.
wow, dad. This feels great.
good. Good.
you're... you sure there's... there's nothing on your mind?
no.
why do you ask, dad? You seem upset about something.
it's just, you reach a certain age, and you start to wonder, "Am I everything I wanted to be?
I mean, am I selling houses, or am I just selling out?
anything else? - Alex tried beer.
Yeah.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry. Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge. How lovely to see...
uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
what is it?
nothing. School stuff.
later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
Oh, you're still here, are you? - Yes.
don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
damn good of my brother to keep you.
he'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh?
give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.
take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
can I tempt you, Marge? - Just a small one.
excellent nosh, Petunia.
a bit more.
usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
just a bit more. That's a boy.
you wanna try a little drop of brandy?
a little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
what are you smirking at?
where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...
...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
you mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
it's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out.
what is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.
and a drunk too, no doubt? - That's a lie.
what did you say? - My dad wasn't a drunk.
don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.
actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
it's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs.
if something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
shut up! Shut up!
right.
let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon! Vernon, do something!
stop!
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.
hold on, hold on. - Get off.
don't you dare! - Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
please!
Marge!
come back!
you bring her back! You bring her back now.
you put her right! - No. She deserved what she got.
keep away from me. - You can't do magic outside school.
yeah? Try me. - They won't let you back now.
you've nowhere to go.
I don't care. Anywhere is better than here.
welcome to the Knight Bus...
...emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
my name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening.
what you doing down there?
I fell over. - What you fell over for?
I didn't do it on purpose. - Well, come on, then.
let's not wait for the grass to grow.
what you looking at? - Nothing.
well, come on, then. In.
no, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.
come on.
come on. Move on, move on.
take her away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
it's going to be a bumpy ride.
what did you say your name was again? - I didn't.
whereabouts are you headed? - The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
you hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
the Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup...
...make sure you eat it before it eats you.
but the Muggles. Can't they see us? - Muggles?
they don't see nothing, do they?
no, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Yes!
who is that?
that man.
who is that?
who is...?
that is Sirius Black, that is.
don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
he's a murderer.
got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
how did he escape? - Well, that's the question, isn't it?
he's the first one that done it.
he was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
they're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
mind your head.
Hey, guys? Guys?
why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.
the Leaky Cauldron. - Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
take it away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
room 11.
Hedwig.
right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
he arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
as Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...
...earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
the Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
she has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
she will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
so that's that...
...and no harm done.
pea soup?
no, thank you.
minister? - Yes?
I don't understand. - Understand?
I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
on the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things...
...was very, very irresponsible.
the state of things, sir? - We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
but what's he got to do with me?
nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters.
and tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
these are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty...
...of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't...
...wander.
right! You gonna move that bus or what?
housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
it's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect?
it's in his nature. - A cat? Is that what they told you?
looks more like a pig with hair. - That's rich...
...coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
egypt. What's it like? - Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...
...like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
you know Egyptians used to worship cats. - Yeah, along with the dung beetle.
not flashing that clipping again? - I haven't shown anyone.
no, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom.
the day maid. - Night maid.
cook. - The bloke who fixed the toilet.
Harry. - Mrs. Weasley.
good to see you, dear. - Good to see you.
got everything? - Yes.
yes? All your books? - It's all upstairs.
your clothes? - Everything.
good boy. - Thank you.
Harry Potter. - Mr. Weasley.
Harry, wonder if I might have a word? - Yeah, sure.
Hermione. - Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
looking forward to a new term? - Yeah. It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
but I think that you need to know the facts.
you are in danger.
grave danger.
has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
what do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
only that he's escaped from Azkaban. - Do you know why?
thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
Voldemort. - Don't say his name.
sorry.
when you stopped You-Know-Who...
...Black lost everything.
but to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
and in his mind...
...you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
and that is why...
...he has escaped from Azkaban.
to find you.
and kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear...
...you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley...
...why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
quick. Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...
I lost control. - Brilliant.
honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
come on. Everywhere else is full.
who do you think that is?
professor R. J. Lupin. - Do you know everything?
how is it she knows everything?
it's on his suitcase, Ronald. - Oh.
do you think he's really asleep? - Seems to be. Why?
I gotta tell you something.
let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...
...to come after you? - Yeah.
but they'll catch Black, won't they?
I mean, everyone's looking for him. - Sure.
except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before...
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. - Thanks, Ron.
why are we stopping?
we can't be there yet.
what's going on?
I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.
there's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
bloody hell! What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
thank you.
here, eat this. It'll help.
it's all right. It's chocolate.
what was that thing that came?
it was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.
it was searching the train for Sirius Black.
if you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
eat. You'll feel better.
what happened to me?
well, you sort of went rigid.
we thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
and did either of you two...
...you know...
...pass out? - No.
I felt weird, though.
like I'd never be cheerful again.
but someone was screaming.
a woman.
no one was screaming, Harry.
welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
now, I'd like to say a few words...
...before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
first, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R. J. Lupin...
...who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
good luck, professor.
of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter. Is it true you fainted?
I mean, you actually fainted? - Shove off, Malfoy.
how did he find out? - Just forget it.
our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years...
...has decided to retire...
...in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
fortunately, I'm delighted to announce...
...that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
finally, on a more disquieting note...
...at the request of the Ministry of Magic...
...Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban...
...until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
now whilst I've been assured...
...that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities...
...a word of caution.
dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
therefore, I must warn each and every one of you...
...to give them no reason to harm you.
it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
but you know, happiness can be found...
...even in the darkest of times...
...if one only remembers to turn on the light.
fortuna Major.
here, listen. She just won't let me in.
fortuna Major. - No, no. Wait, wait.
watch this.
amazing. Just with my voice. - Fortuna Major.
Yes, all right. Go in. - Thank you.
still doing that after three years.
she can't even sing. - Exactly.
Hey, man. - Hey, man.
Oh, God. - That's awful.
green. That's a monkey.
what is that? - You call that a monkey?
do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
Ron, catch. - I will.
I think we have a winner.
Oh, don't try one of them. - Oh, no.
look at him. His face.
welcome, my children.
in this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
in this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
this term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
so please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
what do you see?
the truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
but first, you must broaden your minds.
first, you must look beyond. - What a load of rubbish.
where did you come from? - Me?
I've been here all this time. - You, boy...
is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup.
pity.
broaden your minds.
your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond?
I think you are. - Sure.
look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering.
and that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
so...
...you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
my dear...
...you have the Grim.
the Grin? What's the Grin?
not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.
taking form of a giant spectral dog.
it's among the darkest omens in our world.
it's an omen of death.
you don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
a fair few.
hang on. That's not possible.
ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
you have to be in two classes at once.
don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.
that's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
a great lesson. So follow me.
right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there.
and open your books to page 49.
exactly how do we do that?
just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me.
don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. - I'm okay. Okay.
I think they're funny. - Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.
witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs.
wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor! Dementor!
just ignore him. - You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
isn't he beautiful?
say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
that, Ron, is a hippogriff.
first thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
it may be the last thing you ever do.
now, who'd like to come and say hello?
well done, Harry. Well done.
come on now.
now...
...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So...
...step up. Give him a nice bow.
then you wait and see if he bows back.
if he does, you can go and touch him.
if not... Well, we'll get to that later.
just make your bow.
nice and low.
back off, Harry. Back off.
keep still.
keep still.
well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you.
right. I think you can go and pat him now.
go on. Don't be shy.
nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow.
not so fast, Harry.
slow down, Harry. That's it...
nice and slow. Now let him come to you.
slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
that's it...
Yes!
well done! Well done, Harry, well done!
does he get to fly?
I think he may let you ride him now. - What?
come on. - Hey, hey, hey!
put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
that was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
well done, well done.
how am I doing me first day? - Brilliant, professor.
you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa! Buckbeak!
away, you silly creature...
it's killed me! - Calm down. It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
he has to be taken to the hospital. - I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
you're gonna regret this. - Class dismissed!
you and your bloody chicken!
does it hurt terribly, Draco?
it comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky.
madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
I can't do homework for weeks. - Listen to the idiot.
he's really laying it on thick, isn't he? - At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
he's been sighted! He's been sighted! - Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
you don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
with dementors at every entrance? - Dementors?
he slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?
that's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke.
like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
intriguing, isn't it?
would anyone like to venture a guess...
...as to what is inside?
that's a boggart, that is. - Very good, Mr. Thomas.
now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
no one knows. - When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
they take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
that's what makes them so... - So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
let's practice it now. Without wands, please.
after me. Riddikulus!
Riddikulus! - Very good.
a little louder and very clear. Listen:
Riddikulus! - Riddikulus!
this class is ridiculous. - Very good.
so much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
what really finishes a boggart is laughter.
you need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?
come on, don't be shy. Come on.
come on.
hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?
professor Snape.
sorry? - Professor Snape.
professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.
and I believe you live with your grandmother. - Yes, I don't want Boggart to turn into her, either.
no...
...it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.
only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
she carries a red handbag... - We don't need to hear.
as long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe...
...Here's what I want you to do. Excuse me.
imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
can you do that?
Yes. Wand at the ready.
think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay...
...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line...
form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most...
...and turn it into something funny.
next! Ron!
concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!
wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
you see? Very good, very good!
marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!
show us what you see.
keep your nerve. Steady.
Riddikulus!
and next! Step up, step up!
wonderful, wonderful!
here!
Riddikulus!
right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today.
collect your books from the back.
that's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry!
sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
no permission form signed, no visiting the village.
that's the rule, Potter.
those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.
forget about it, guys. See you later.
professor, can I ask you something?
you want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
but then I remembered that night on the train...
...and the dementor. - I'm very impressed.
that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
this is very wise.
before I fainted...
...I heard something.
a woman...
...screaming.
dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother...
...the night she was murdered.
the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
not by your scar, by your eyes.
they're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her.
your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
not only was she a singularly gifted witch...
...she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
she had a way of seeing the beauty in others...
...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
and your father, James, on the other hand...
...he...
he had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
a talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
you're more like them than you know, Harry.
in time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
we never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
you heard it's the most haunted building in Britain. - Yeah, I know.
what's going on?
probably Neville forgot the password again.
Hey. - Oh, you're there.
let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
get back, all of you.
no one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
the Fat Lady! She's gone!
serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
it's not funny, Ron.
keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room.
be quiet. - Make way.
the headmaster's here. - Come on, move.
you heard. Move!
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
there's no need for ghosts, professor.
the Fat Lady's there.
mind where you're going! Slow down!
you listen! I'm Head Boy!
come back here! - Keep moving!
dear lady, who did this to you?
eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
it's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about.
he's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
thank you. - The third floor's clear too, sir.
very good. - I've done the dungeons.
no sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
remarkable feat, don't you think?
to enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
...completely undetected? - Quite remarkable, yes.
any theories on how he managed it?
many. Each as unlikely as the next.
you may recall...
...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...
...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
what about Potter? Should he be warned?
perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.
for in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
turn to page 394.
excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?
that's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching...
...at the present time. Turn to page 394.
werewolves?
sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
we're not meant to start that for weeks. - Quiet.
when did she come in? Did you see her come in?
now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
no one?
how disappointing. - Please, sir.
an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
a werewolf has no choice.
with each full moon...
...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend.
further more, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time...
...you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
are you incapable of restraining yourself...
...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
he's got a point, you know. - Five points from Gryffindor.
as an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning...
...Two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it. - Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow.
then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
loss of limb will not excuse you.
page 394.
the term "werewolf..."
...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer," which means "man," and "wolf. " Werewolf, man-wolf.
there are several ways to become a werewolf.
they include being given the power of shape-shifting...
...being bitten by a werewolf...
go, Harry! Go, Harry!
he looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? - Peaky?
what do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.
let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
probably a right sight better than he normally does.
how are you feeling? - Oh, brilliant.
you gave us a right good scare.
what happened? - Well, you fell off your broom.
Really? I meant the match. Who won?
no one blames you, Harry.
dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
after he saved you, he sent them straight off.
there's something else you should know too.
when you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
is there no chance of fixing it?
no.
professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
I mean, more than everyone else? - Listen.
dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
they feed on every good feeling, every happy memory...
...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
you are not weak, Harry.
dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
you have nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm scared, professor. - I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me.
you made the one on the train go away.
there was only one that night.
but you made it go away. - I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
but as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you...
...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays.
for now, I need to rest.
last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!
guys, let me go. - Clever, Harry.
but not clever enough. - We've got a better way.
I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. - We know.
we'll get you there.
we'll show you a quicker way. - If you pipe down.
bless him. - Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...
now, Harry. - Come and join the big boys.
what are you doing?!
what's this rubbish? - "What's this rubbish?" he says.
it's the secret to our success. - It's a wrench giving it to you...
but we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs...
...are proud to present the Marauder's Map.
we owe them so much.
hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that...
no. Is that really...? - Dumbledore.
in his study. - Pacing.
does that a lot.
so this map shows...? - Everyone.
where they are. - What they're doing.
every minute. - Every day.
brilliant! Where did you get it? - From Filch's office.
first year. - There are seven secret passageways...
...out of the castle. - We'd recommend this one.
the One-Eyed Witch passageway. - Leads you to Honeyduke's.
hurry. Filch is heading this way.
and don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
"mischief managed. " Otherwise, anyone can read it.
now, how much do you want?
delicious.
it's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
twice.
do you want to move a bit closer?
to the Shrieking Shack?
actually, I'm fine here.
well, well. Look who's here.
you two shopping for your new dream home?
bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in one room?
shut your mouth, Malfoy. - Not very friendly.
boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
hope you don't mean yourself. - How dare you talk to me!
you filthy little mudblood!
who is that?
don't stand there! Do something! - What?
what's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
get out of the way!
move!
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Harry!
bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny.
those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
he won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
aren't you? - Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
Ron fancies her. - That's not true!
professor McGonagall! - Cornelius!
allow me, minister.
Oh, Hagrid... - Sorry about that.
Hojo! Hojo! Who will take my photo?
tell your friend about me.
and tell him what I'm going to do to him.
dado Hojo! Dado Hojo! Dado Hojo! Dado Hojo!
dado Hojo! Dado
Sidhu, I lied to you.
run from here， Sidhu.
let go of me!
I made a terrible mistake.
I was no Liu Sheng in a previous life.
I was a mosquito. And still am.
sir, I'm an ordinary man from Chandni Chowk.
Dada's foolish boy.
don't beg!
no, it isn't his fault. I'm to blame. Punish me.
let him go, sir. It isn't his fault.
it isn't his fault.
Sidhu, get up!
I'll be disgraced forever.
Sidhu, get up!
this is the man you call your Liu Sheng?
liu Sheng?
you think you can destroy me?
you want this man to save your village?
first Iet's see...
...if he can save one man.
if you can't use your hands to defend me, then don't fold them to beg.
destroy them! Remember you are from Chandni Chowk.
you bastard!
you have 20 hired hands and think you're a strong man.
if you're so brave, then fight me. I'll chop you into bits and scatter them.
you are naive. Don't trust these work-shy bastards.
danger lurks in the strangest places.
I know you'll save me if I get into trouble.
liu Sheng?
throw this Chandni Chowk man out of China!
you want to be Liu Sheng?
then die like him.
the man whose hand I clasped as I walked
he changed life's colors for me
my life turned upside down in a minute
filled with grief
my God is slumbering
my protector has gone away from me
having shown me the path to tread
your destiny is not in the Iines of your palm...
...but in hard work.
his name is Sidhu
now what do you want?
my sister.
please don't send me
I belong nowhere.
I have no one to turn to.
I can't go back to Chandni Chowk.
give me some work. I'll do anything.
I'll shine your shoes.
to unite Meow Meow and Sakhi, Chopstick joined Hojo's gang.
three months later.
you blessed me with one hand...
...and took Dada away with the other.
why, Lord Ganesh? Why?
what can I do here in China?
where to go?
Oh, Lord. No one speaks Hindi here.
what shall I do? Show me the way, Lord.
have you lost your mind? Talking to a potato.
make french fries and eat them.
you've lost weight.
it isn't a potato.
this is my god.
don't talk nonsense, old beggar.
and people say I'm mad.
what did you say?
I said, people say I'm mad.
you speak Hindi.
I was just repeating what I hear.
but you're speaking Hindi.
no, it's Chinese.
no. You were speaking Hindi.
how can I? I'm Chinese. You're mad.
sure. You're Chinese. But you can speak Hindi.
be quiet. I can't remember. I know nothing.
Lord, I asked for the way and you send the whole map.
stay away from me.
lord Ganesh has sent you.
lord Ganesh has sent you. People here think I'm Liu Sheng. Listen.
oid beggar, Iisten to me.
my God has sent you. Do you understand who Lord Ganesh is?
oid beggar, Iisten to me.
liu Sheng, Liu Sheng, Liu Sheng.
Hojo?
your future and your past have changed, Sidhu.
you're the great warrior Liu Sheng.
dada, I will avenge your death.
I will become Liu Sheng.
I will become Liu Sheng.
that's good. Look at my friend.
go on. Laugh.
when I become Liu Sheng, I'll be laughing at you.
go on. Laugh.
the great beggar of China's Great Wall.
I'm not a beggar. I'm Liu Sheng.
sure. They'll laugh themselves silly.
but don't stop your brick-smashing act.
when I have some chicken soup and my muscles are toned...
...I'll become Liu Sheng.
what do you want?
my friend needs food.
we have nothing cooked. Can't you see? We're redecorating.
get out.
what did he say?
he said the restaurant is closed now.
no food here.
what do you mean? I can cook.
well! So Liu Sheng is a chef?
yes' he is.
you're no better than me.
you've no family and remember nothing.
look at your face. You Iook like a beggar.
white Bull!
what are you doing? Get out!
police! Police!
police!
sorry.
liu Sheng has stirred.
liu Sheng has stirred in me.
liu Sheng has stirred.
greetings.
liu Sheng has stirred.
you fool. It's me. The old beggar.
is Liu Sheng alive? Then fight him. -He's dead now.
my eyes!
easy. My Iegs aren't made of steel. Fool!
what are you doing?
liu Sheng has saved me.
not Liu Sheng. I saved you.
why didn't you save me again?
save you? I'll show you saving.
he's back.
give me your hand.
chiang Kohung.
oid beggar. Are you Chiang Kohung?
chiang Kohung. You're still alive.
you killed Dada. My Dada.

dead at Iast.
lord Ganesh has sent you to me.
you're under arrest. -I want to be under you.
get off.
the murder weapon. The corpse. The evidence.
you're the killer. Straight to prison. Case solved.
what case? -This case.
you stay right here.
I'm calling the police.
don't move.
odd fellow.
he imagines he's a police officer.
opera?
hello.
I'm waiting behind the Opera.
I'm on my way.
any word from Joey?
go. Call him.
the boss wants his specs.
give me my hat.
hurry up, idiot.
run, Sidhu, run.
what's going on? -Sidhu is alive.
Hojo has gone after him.
stop right here.
get in the car.
you handle them. I'll follow Sidhu.
go' go.
I'm trying to enjoy playing this game with you, my friend.
but the game is over. The winner is...
meow Meow?
come with me. Come on.
let go of me.
where are you dragging me, Meow Meow?
I'm Miss TSM. Your Sakhi.
miss TSM?
the Chinese Consulate girl?
he's here. Come on!
only one way to escape. -That's suicide.
your eyes smiled at me
overwhelming my heart
now I have found you, don't go away
stay in my eyes. Sleep in my embrace
these are the ways of love
some magical encounters
we meet, our hearts smile. The season changes
your smiling eyes
this is me and my twin, Suzy.
no wonder! I was so confused.
a dark cloud hung over me every time I saw your sister.
but when I...
when I see you...
look at me.
when I see you, my heart floats.
I feel like gliding away like a butterfly.
off to prison.
why are you hitting me? No prison for me. I have Iots to do.
you should be thanking me. Your memory is back.
stop hitting me. You're not an inspector. You're Chiang Kohung.
Chiang?
nothing but punches since I arrived in China.
who's Chiang Kohung?
chiang Kohung! Enough is enough. Stop!
where do you think you're going?
why are you hitting me?
dad?
whose dad?
my daughter.
whose daughter?
dad.
believe me. I've told you everything.
I know nothing else.
I'm a poor teahouse owner. They came and wrecked my place.
the enemy is back.
sir, Hojo knows you're alive.
he knows Sidhu
let him go.
...forgive me.
pIease?
I want to Iearn Kung Fu and karate.
be a master like you...
...and avenge Dada's murder.
you want to Iearn Kung Fu?
take revenge, eh? Against Hojo?
Hojo has erased 20 years of my life.
leave the avenging to me.
you relax. -Should I go back to India?
Yes.
then I'll go back.
when people ask, "Where's Dada?" what do I say?
"well, Dada's dead."
"how come?" "Because of me."
"what did you do?" "I sat by and watched."
you relax, sir.
you have found your family...
...but I will never find my Dada again.
he has gone forever.
he died a dog's death at the hands of Hojo.
he came from Chandni Chowk to show me he cared.
and Hojo slit his throat.
I will have my revenge on Hojo.
Hojo will kill him too.
it's my fault, pinning my hopes on you.
dada always said' "Don't count on anyone.
believe in yourself, Sidhu."
and that's what I'll do from now.
you watch. The world will watch.
I'll kill Hojo.
I'll do it alone.
why are you here?
your training starts tomorrow.
what's this?
what's wrong?
fIying to the moon? You clown.
don't teach me any old rubbish.
I want to Iearn Kung Fu.
be the best, not second best. Get it?
I want to Iearn Kung Fu, not tickling.
cosmos Thumb. My special move.
untouched outside. Pieces within.
I want to learn Cosmos Kung Fu.
there's an old Shaolin saying:
"fear not the 1 0'000 moves practiced once.
fear the single move practiced 1 0'000 times."
look within you, Sidhu. Have you such a move?
a move you've known since childhood...
...that no one can match.
everyone has such a move.
a move that's second nature to you.
your own Kung Fu will help you the day you challenge Hojo.
tell me.
I eat and drink every day.
I chop vegetables. I bathe, I wash. That's it.
training you will probably drive me crazy again.
Masterji.
no arrows, no swords. No weapons, no bullets
you are your own army. You are your own force
is this Kung Fu?
if it is, then every Indian woman who rolls bread is better than Bruce Lee.
I rolled bread in India. Now here too.
tell me, daughter. What was life like when you were 4?
four? How can I remember, Dad?
take your time. We have nothing but time on our hands.
let me fill you in. She drank milk when she was 4.
I'm over 27 and still making bread.
wow, delicious.
can I have another bread? -Another? I'm breaking my back here.
enough is enough.
wait, I'll do it. Okay, enjoy the bread.
now for the next move.
the next move?
if you weren't Sakhi's father, I'd shove this you know where.
I've chopped vegetables all my life. Now you teach me to roll bread.
I want to Iearn Kung Fu. Will you teach me or not?
here's some Kung Fu for you.
why are you hitting me?
this is called Iron Forearm Kung Fu.
I smashed it. Like the star Dara Singh. I'm a Kung Fu master.
put everything behind you and forge ahead
the enemy will run for cover If you use your might
higher.
I've mastered Iron Forearm.
soon I'll master Iron Legs, Iron Chest...
...Iron Stomach and Iron
enough.
don't stop me. My body has turned to iron.
my iron man.
let's go for an iron kiss.
a ticket for India?
rusty iron is of little use to anyone.
Hojo isn't my enemy. You are.
I know. Stay away from her.
enough? Can I get down?
higher.
okay?
do you want me to call on God?
dad, he'll fall.
no more training then. -Never mind, Sakhi. Your father is a tyrant.
I see a bird's nest. Okay? -Jump.
what? Did you say "thump"?
I said' jump." -Impossible. Stop joking.
joking?
Wow!
you're a clown. Hojo will die of laughter when he watches your moves.
fall from any height without breaking a limb.
land like a feather.
jump.
I'm jumping.
you're hopeless.
go back to Chandni Chowk.
just make your way home.
Sakhi, pack his bags. -No, I'll jump.
forging metal turns it to gold. Turn your body to steel
be brave and even, God will bet on you
let embers smolder
let diamonds dazzle
do it! Today's the day
it's beyond you.
your growl echoes like the roar of a lion
you are no less than a tall mountain
wrestle the fiercest waves
stop the raging storm
do it! Today's the day
in the face of danger, show your might. The might of force
your goal is nearing you. Show your might
do it! Today's the day
if you so desire
you can conquer the world
just believe in yourself
Sidhu was trained and ready.
Hojo got his diamonds back...
...and Chopstick was still spying for Sakhi.
ship out the diamonds.
chopstick has sent news.
see you at the harbor.
make sure no outsiders here.
good morning, sir. -What?
hello.
not his shoulder. Hit his chest. Like this.
what move was that? -The Wild Bull.
you keep at it.
I'll sit and watch.
no good. Six out of 1 0.
I'm busting a gut here...
...and you're unimpressed.
from Chandni Chowk to China
look at my face Plain and simple
they say I'm a king, not a pauper
don't use your hand to stop traffic.
stop the enemy's heart.
get it? You Iazy fool! -Lazy fool?
Sidhu! -What?
don't come
don't move, or he dies.
the same old dialogue.
"don't move, or he dies"' et cetera, et cetera.
Sidhu, my day of reckoning has come.
master, you have great powers, and are all-knowing.
your predictions come true. -Stop.
kill him. Don't worry about me.
you worry me the least.
stop, or he dies.
you stopped.
I knew you cared for me deep down.
no way. A question for you. Must I immerse your ashes in the Ganges...
...or in a Chinese river? Well?
let's split your remains. Ashes here, urn there.
finish him off.
Sidhu, forgive me. I touch your feet.
cosmic Thumb.
touch my feet, then.
in the face of danger, show your might
your goal is nearing you. Show your might
let your breath be your guide
let your feelings show
do it! Today's the day
if you so desire. You can conquer the world
just believe in yourself
that's new.
cosmic Kick.
thank you.
nine and a half.
thank you, thank you.
onIy nine and a half? You old man!
Hojo heard a familiar voice on the phone.
a voice he had not heard for 20 years.
Hojo was promised the return of his son in exchange of Meow Meow.
time you know the truth about your father.
Hojo's men are everywhere.
Suzy. I want you to know I'm your
this is for my father.
you killed my father. You destroyed my family.
attack!
why did Suzy stab you?
no, it's all Hojo's ruthless scheming.
Suzy believes I murdered her father.
Sidhu, where to?
to where it all began.
he's my father, isn't he? -He's a foe.
it was now clear to Meow Meow.
Hojo had kept the truth from her.
we made a big mistake. You're not a reincarnation of Liu Sheng.
you don't owe us anything. You had better go.
tell him to leave. We know he isn't Liu Sheng.
Sidhu, they say they made a big mistake. You aren't Liu Sheng.
the village is their problem, not yours. They say, "Return to Chandni Chowk."
I may not be Liu Sheng...
...but now they are my own people.
so what if I was a mosquito or Liu Sheng in a previous birth?
my purpose in this lifetime...
...is to destroy Hojo.
lord Ganesh.
today I'll fight alone.
just me.
Lord, you've always been on my side, and always will be.
where are you going? -Hojo is here. I'm all right.
I have both your daughters now.
stop right there.
who will stop me?
I will.
you traitor!
one of my daughters goes after me.
Papa.
...Sidhu will fight alone.
liu Sheng. Ready for your next rebirth?
the time of promises is over seize the day
learn the wisdom of action
take what belongs to you
never beg for what is rightfully yours
so you still believe God is in the potato?
God only helps those who help themselves.
believe in yourself, Sidhu.
your destiny isn't in your palm Iines. It's in your might.
know your true self.
chop them down like corn and carrots.
destroy them!
get up, Sidhu.
pIease.
fear not 10000 moves practiced once.
fear a single move practiced 10000 times.
look within yourself, Sidhu.
your destiny is not in your palm Iines. It's in your might.
do you have a unique move that none can match?
know your true self.
that move is within you, Sidhu.
chop them like corn and carrots.
that move is within you, Sidhu.
destroy them!
Sidhu, look within. Do you know such a move?
do you have such a move, Sidhu?
a potato?
you're laughing? You're done for.
the man with hesitant steps. Is now steady
making the impossible possible
he is a new man -Liu Sheng. -Sidhu.
now watch my Indian Kung Fu.
the Kung Fu that I learned in Chandni Chowk's lanes.
that Kung Fu that all Indian women practice as they chop vegetables.
that Kung Fu
his name is Sidhu
bread. All shapes and sizes, with cheese or radishes?
shall I repeat the menu for you?
bread. All shapes and sizes, with cheese or radishes?
will I serve you up as a potato dumpling?
why so quiet? Cheer me on!
he sees big dreams. He does great deeds
the Delhi dreamer is now China's champ
the potato of the day...
...is cut to size.
and that's how Sidhu-- Liu Sheng ended Hojo's days.
how long could the great Liu Sheng tolerate tyranny?
his spirit can rest in peace now.
happy days have returned to Zhange village.
with Dada's blessings...
...Sidhu champions a charming cheer from Chandni Chowk to China.
inspector Chiang was at last reunited with his daughters.
chopstick was delighted to discover his Chinese roots.
but Sidhu warned him: No more conning!
what's this?
what's wrong?
they say they have a big problem in their village.
I'm no troubleshooter. How come you understand them?
Sidhu, I lied to you. -About what?
my mother wasn't from China. -Africa?
from Chandni Chowk to Africa<b> TO BE CONTINUED</b>

enough. We're off to Chandni Chowk.
it's a wrap.
he is Liu Sheng, reborn.
the GAME OF DEATH.
Mr. Kurtainbaum, why did you decide to continue production on The Game of Death?
l feel l personally owe it to Bruce to finish this picture.
this was his passion project, his statement to the world.
this was his Gone with the Wind.
Ronney. how do you plan on completing the movie without its star?
you see, we are going to do a worldwide search for the man who will literally be stepping into Bruce Lee's shoes to complete his performance.
Ronney, won't it be obvious that it's someone else playing Bruce Lee?
film reality, my man, it's made in the editing room, you know?
eisenstein, you know, he taught us that with associative editing, and that was 50 years ago.
we're only limited by our own imaginations.
we meet again, Bob.
Yeah.
l knew you were a snake, Leroy Jackson.
Yeah.
well, it doesn't matter because l will destroy both of you.
have you met my sirens of fury?
Oh, you've joined the Nazi Party.
poor birds.
l feel sorry for all of you in the after life.
ninjas!
you know, l really don't know why people keep confusing me and Bruce.
l mean, seriously, we are two totally different actors.
Yes, but... don't you see the obvious similarities?
look, the cat wears a yellow jumpsuit on the big screen, l'm always wearing a blue one. He's Bruce Lee, l'm Breeze Loo.
lt's kind of like Pepsi and Coke. l can guarantee one thing anyone who's taken that Pepsi Challenge can definitely taste the difference.
is it true you don't do your own fighting?
that's correct. l mean, why should l, right? l'm an actor.
there's a name for actors that do their own fighting. They're called stuntmen.
to me, acting's all right here, in the eyes.
what do you think of Bruce Lee's acting?
you know, l wouldn't really know.
I've never seen any of his films.
Really?
come on. I've done 14 films in the last two years. I've been a little busy.
why are you entertaining the idea of finishing his film?
the cat and l are peers.
l figure if l was the one who passed early, l hope he'd have done the same for me.
Yes, master.
would you like another? What do you think?
l think that was pretty good. l liked that one. You sure?
l asked Saraghina to be my manager.
Yeah, but l'm still his lady.
lt's the ultimate when you get to work with someone you love.
Yeah, yeah. l'd do anything for Cole.
what is it you are doing at these studios?
well...
you go first, honey.
well, l'm here to be in my first Hollywood movie.
l feel really blessed. Yeah, yeah.
l was at this swap meet and l found this flyer that said that The Trombone Thief Part 3 was needing someone to play the butler.
l only have one line, but l think it's a big deal because they're already on part three.
Yeah, plus this gives us momentum to go into The Game of Death.
lt's a perfect career move.
Cole Kim, we need you on the set now.
you look great. You look great.
OK.
best butler ever.
l think it's one of those European films. Yeah, maybe.
you do golden showers? Um...
l,l'm Cole Kim. l,l'm playing the butler.
well, go change into your butler outfit and sit outside the door.
as l'm humping the blonde and chomping on the Oriental's furburger, look through the peephole and whack off, OK?
go. Wardrobe. Whack off?
Yes, whack off. The fuckysucky is reserved for me.
daylight, come on.
Change.Forget you.
amateurs.
get me another butler, OK? Quickly.
aim low. l want to see the hardcore.
lf you don't see the hardcore, don't shoot. OK...
and... action.
now stick it right in her ass. That's it. A little deeper.
bend over.
please.
Oh, that's...
that's great.
today's my first day as a doctor.
seven years of schooling. three years as a resident.
today's my last day as a doctor.
l'm quitting to become an actor.
l'm a little confused.
for as long as I can remember.
I've always wanted to be a ninja. or an actor.
so then why did you choose to go into the medical field?
when l was 15, my mom got ill.
before she died, she asked me for one thing to become a doctor.
today l've fulfilled that promise to her.
and tomorrow l try to fulfill my promise to myself.
do you think she intended that when she asked you to be a doctor?
l kept a promise.
that's all l can say.
so how do you intend to jump into the industry after all these years of medical school?
you know, l've done my best to incorporate my theater training into my medical career.
very good, Victor, but it's more like a groan from below.
right, and you're having a kidney stone, so the pain is in your lower abdomen or groin. Try again.
as an intern. I came up with the idea to work with actors as patients so that medschool students could have real people to diagnose.
sort of like community theater, except everyone's sick.
all the time.
how about film experience?
I've done some film work here and there.
I got to work as a stunt double.
I've even worked as Breeze Loo's stunt double a couple of times.
lt's not exactly what l want to do, but...
l get to combine two things l love the most, acting and martial arts.
Addey, Addey,
Addey, Addey, Addey.
Hi, kids!
Hi, Addey!
do you know what my name is?
Addey the Astroduck!
say it again!
I was hired by NASA's outreach division to raise awareness about the Skylab project and the space race against the Russians.
I make public appearances as Addey the Astroduck and they treat me like a king.
especially moms.
is space exploration an important issue for you?
actually. no. I think there are far bigger problems here on Earth and here in this country.
can you elaborate on that? Racism for one.
our people have been oppressed for far too long.
Really? Yeah.
there have been no reparations for the abuse our people suffered building the railroads in the 1 860s.
that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.
but, Tarrick, um...
aren't you Caucasian?
l'm half Chinese.
so, um... so, Tarrick, why do you want to audition for The Game of Death?
l admire Bruce Lee as a role model for the Asiatic community.
I try to be the same. Maybe my work is on a smaller. more humble. grassroots level.
but I think that reaching out to promote the yellow brotherhood certainly has its place.
do you really feel like you have a shot at getting the part?
nothing has ever been given to me.
my life has been a continual struggle.
lt's that very struggle that fuels my art.
you call me " slanty eyes. "
l stay silent. But my eyes can see the damage being done to me.
railroad worker
railroad worker
emasculated halfman.
l don't deny there's a piece of me longdead on the tracks.
but l am railroaded every day.
tracked and trapped.
but never defeated.
never defeated.
but also...never free!
let's face it, leading men and ladies are white. You can't deny it.
but what about the people they visit, the ones they encounter?
the noble savages, the angry Pygmies, the exotic geishas and the street thugs.
all of them? Colored folks.
and when l say " colored, " l mean all colors.
Hollywood needs these colors to paint their pictures.
and l'm the one who delivers the variety.
l represent Latinos, Orientals and AfroAmericans.
hell, l even got clients who are AfroLatinos and LatinOrientals.
you want 'em, l got 'em.
some of my clients have even stepped into the spotlight and made a real name for themselves, courtesy of Roy Thunder.
clear. Go!
just relax.
Troy Poon was the costar of a hit primetime TV show .
Chang.
bring this clown down to the squad car.
Hey, man, l ain't gonna do your laundry.
'hey. man. I ain't gonna do your laundry. "
Troy's tag line swept the nation.
J. J. Walker had nothing on him.
Wow.
lt's Rob Force.
you know, the last time we met, you had the gun to my head.
l should have shot you when l had the chance.
woulda, coulda, shoulda, Robbie.
any last requests?
Hey, Chang, why don't you send for someone to pick up this rotting corpse?
Hey.
l ain't gonna do your laundry.
you know what l like about you, Chang? What?
absolutely nothing.
it was the highestrated show in the country on Friday nights.
but after only nine episodes.
something horrible happened.
Dean Silo, best known for his role as toughtalking detective Rob Force, was found dead early this morning in his Beverly Hills home.
l'm here on the scene with Officer Williams.
officer Williams, when did Dean Silo pass away?
well, the preliminary report put the time of death at approximately 3: 37 a. m.
and the circumstances surrounding his demise?
well, based on the position of the body of the deceased and several pieces of evidence, it appears that Mr. Silo was in the midst of selfasphyxiation and attempted autofellatio at the time of death.
thank you, Officer Williams.
traces of several substances were found in, on or around the body, including amphetamine, morphine, Dramamine, codeine, Sizzlean, quinine,
quaaludes, preludes, mescaline methadone, methadust, angel dust,
Mercocet, Percocet, Darvocet,
Roxicet, Vicodin, OxyContin, tin,
LSD, CPC, PYT, amphetamines, barbiturates and Elmer's Glue.
also, several male juvenile pornographic magazines and a giant Nazi flag were strewn around the body, and the deceased was wearing a Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard's outfit.
needless to say. Troy's show got canceled.
and all the networks refused to air the reruns.
for me, a job in sales is the same as an acting gig.
you know, l mean, it really is.
the only difference is you, um...
you're performing in front of a smaller crowd.
Hello, how are you? My name is Troy Poon.
do you have a moment?
l'd like to show you a great product.
aren't you...?
aren't you...?
aren't you that guy? The one on the television?
Yes, yes, that's me. Oh!
do you have a moment? l'd like to show you the...
why not?
don't mind the mess. The more mess, the better.
that's what this thing is for.
and as you can see, the MegaVac cleaning machine is extremely simple to put together.
see? l mean, it doesn't get any better than this.
lt's beautiful.
lts sucking power is unrivalled.
oops!
let's see how the new MegaVac cleaning machine handles the job.
sorry to interrupt, but could you say it?
excuse me? That little thing you say about the laundry.
please say it for us, just once?
cheese! Me, me, me!
go, go, go. Ready? OK, here we go.
ready? Everybody, " Cheese! "
well, hello! There are quite a lot of you here...
so today is the first day of your auditions.
what are you experiencing right now ?
I imagine this is how Godard felt when he was casting " Breathless " .
Yeah, yeah. But on to the new Bruce Lee.
so, l'm thinking... Here's what l'm thinking.
a loud, intimidating type, like a... like a...
like a hip Genghis Khan, you know?
well, he needs to be the silent calm type with an inner strength.
Oh, yeah. Of course. Well, that's what l meant.
you know, l don't mean " loud " in, like, a volume sort of way, like, " l'm Bruce Lee, " screaming.
l meant that he has an intense internal power.
Ronney... When you work with these young directors.
you very often have to give them what they need.
even though they're not aware they need it.
you know, 90% of filmmaking, it's the casting.
so this is the time to lend my support to a young director.
you know, give him my years of experience. Right now.
well. I love open auditions.
all bets are off and anything is possible.
you never know when you might discover the next Pat Morita or the new Esther Rolle.
you got a great look.
great look.
Roy Thunder, talent manager.
'Colored people " ?
last time l checked, yellow was a color, my man.
the casting process isn't about which of us is better than the other or who's more right for the part.
honestly. it all comes down to covering your bases.
for example. I happen to know Cassie thinks I'm a great lay.
she rode me for six days last summer. I got a spot on " Sanford and Son. "
now, that may be a coincidence.
but I'm not willing to take the chance that it was.
you are the best in the room.
you are filled with strength and power.
but all around you is weakness and insecurity.
they are afraid of you because they all know that the part is yours.
open your eyes and look at them.
really look at them.
they're weak.
weak.
Hey, is...
Hey, l think that's Breeze Loo.
Cole? Cole, you're disrupting my exercise.
but it's Breeze Loo! Who cares? You're Cole Kim.
l gotta go meet him. Well, he's the competition.
but he's Breeze Loo!
solid, baby. Solid. Peace.
Hey, Mr. Loo. Hey, brother.
my name is Cole Kim and l'm a big fan. Very cool.
Yeah, l love Fist of Fhrer and l've seen Exit the Serpent, like, 17 times.
Oh, that's a lot of times, brother.
and your moves, they're, like, flawless.
Yeah, how do you kick three guys at the same time?
Oh. Saraghina,
Mr. Breeze Loo.
it was like he was sleeping with the enemy.
I couldn't believe it.
Oh. I didn't think it was a big deal. He was a nice guy.
lt made you soft.
lt made you lose your edge. Edge?
Yeah, you asked him to autograph your shirt.
well, what else was he supposed to sign?
Cole, come on.
look, imagine you saw Warren Beatty. l mean, what would you do?
OK, Breeze Loo is no Warren Beatty.
he can beat up three guys at the same time.
Oh, Reggie!
how you doin', baby?
this cat makes me look real good on the big screen don't you, Reg?
Hey, baby. l'm here to see the director.
Oh, great. Um, your name is...?
lt's Loo. Breeze Loo.
OK, all right.
Oh. OK. Mr. Loo.
you are in group C, so it's gonna be about an hour before we send you guys in.
whoa, whoa, whoa, kitty cat.
l ain't here to audition. l'm here to meet the director.
you know, the director is unavailable right now, so...
what l can do is l can put you into group A.
do you mind if l use your phone?
of course. We have a pay phone outside.
one of your current clients will be auditioning.
Oh, Troy. l got him this amazing opportunity.
not the usual Oriental bit part.
l'm talking leading yellow role in a film with serious distribution.
that's like Nixon visiting me in Watts. lt just don't happen, baby.
thunder, l need to talk to you. Not now, Troy.
Hey, now. We got this dynamite interview going.
Troy, look...
man, we're... Look, Troy... Thunder, listen to me.
why, huh? Why did you send me here?
lt's a big part.
this is not a part. lt's a bodydouble gig.
but it's an opportunity.
l... l can't believe you're actually trying to sell me on this.
look, Troy, come on, man. Look what's out there.
you don't wanna go back to playing delivery boys.
no, of course not. But this?
this is even more insulting.
Troy, what have you got to lose?
you know what?
you ain't doing shit for colored people, Thunder.
Troy, hold it, man. Look.
you're making a big mistake.
Yeah.
big mistake. OK!
OK!
OK, hello, everyone.
Hi.
hello... Don't stand behind me. Thanks so much. Over there.
Hi, everyone. l wanted to welcome you to the auditions for The Game of Death.
my name is Eloise. l am the casting director.
this is Ronney. He's the director of the film.
l wanted to tell you how much l appreciate you being here today.
l'm very grateful and l appreciate your time and patience. Absolutely.
so, look, to find the best man for the role, guys, we are going to have three rounds of auditions.
not six, three. lt's just so you can all see this.
OK, and it's gonna be a really, really fun process.
so how about, just to kick it off, raise your hand if you have formal conservatory training with an emphasis on Shakespeare.
Wow. That is... Good for you.
very good for you. l love the classics. Excellent.
how about all of you eager people with your hands up in the air can follow Cassie here right out that door?
thank you so much.
it's pretty simple.
I have found over the years that actors with all of that training.
they spend so much time connecting to their inner truth.
they don't connect to the average moviegoer. you know what I mean?
and our Bruce Lee needs to be the kind of guy
middle America can really relate to.
someone... someone like Larry in Omaha would drink a Bud with.
you know what I mean?
the last thing we need is some educated. snooty Bruce Lee to alienate America.
right, Ronney?
Yeah. Yeah.
so what's gonna be happening during today's audition?
well, today, in this round, we give the actors sides these pages right here with basically their lines on them.
and, um... it's a cold reading today, meaning the actors have never seen the lines.
specifically, what qualities are you looking for from these gentlemen?
well, it depends on the person. Everyone brings something different, but l would like to see the relationship between the text and the subtext.
it's very important what an actor brings in on his own.
which is inbetween the lines.
but what he also does with the text. you know ?
you offended me.
you offended my family.
great. Thank you.
my name Remi Nguyen.
l would like very much to be part of your movie.
ln my village in Vietnam, l dreamed of being on the big Hollywood movie screen.
my parents, they would be proud to see me that way.
but they didn't make it out of Saigon.
l dedicate this to them.
OK. Let's get started.
you offend me.
you offend my family.
that was nice. Can l give him a note?
can you try it one more time?
but l want you to think about your family stuck in Saigon.
you offended me. You offended my family.
you have offended me!
you have offended my family!
you offended me.
you offended my family!
you offended me and you offended my family.
can we lose the glasses? l'd really like to see...
l wouldn't bother. l think he's just bad.
l think he's just... l think...
l think you're not ready for this. l don't... Let's not... Let's move on.
you offended me.
you offended my family.
can you hold on one second?
l think we should ask him to do a move, see if we can inspire some more aggression.
ls that all right? Oh, yeah.
OK. Maybe just to get a little bit more voice out of you...
l see the outfit. Do you know a little karate, a little jujitsu or something?
l do.
would you mind... Maybe you can say the line, this time doing some type of move.
you offended me.
you offended my family.
better. Way better.
a lot better. Way better.
there he is. Here l am.
the man. You look great, Breeze.
do l? Yeah, you look fantastic.
thank you, brother. Thank you.
l have a question, though. Shoot.
you are a powerful agency.
that's the word in the street.
you cats are in the Hollywood big three, am l not right?
number one in the big three. Wow.
that must mean you have a lot of muscle. Might makes right.
how many feature films have l starred in in, let's say, past two years?
14. Wow! You cats remembered.
of course. You're a star, Breezy.
Oh, stop that. Stop.
just the truth, man. Thank you.
but l'm a bit confused. Why is that?
lf you cats are such a powerful agency and l'm such a big star, then why the fuck am l standing here like a motherfucking idiot at this goddamn motherfucking cattle call?
there must've been some sort of mixup.
a little confusion, that's all. Confusion?
what is so fucking confusing about offeronly?
we'll straighten it up. Do you know how humiliating this is?
l can only imagine. lt's awful. lt's awful.
breezy.
l know this place, it's like a concentration camp, it's beneath you...
lt's offeronly, you dig?
you got it. Trust me, l'll take care of this.
let's take care of this, fellas.
lt's done. Good.
I thought he was completely contrived.
he had no subtext, you know? There were no layers.
Yeah. Yeah, l mean, l don't disagree.
l completely hear what you're saying.
he's not a very strong " actor, " you know, but as l understand it, we're looking for a star, not an " actor, " you know?
and, l mean, they're completely different animals.
for star searching, l think it comes down to something more immediate and visceral.
like what? Fuckability.
l simply ask myself, " Do l want to fuck that guy? "
since we're looking for the new Bruce Lee, the question should be:
'do l need to fuck this guy? "
you know? Give me an example.
charlton Heston. Are you serious?
Oh, yeah. How do you think he got to be Moses, BenHur, the guy with the apes?
the world wants to fuck Charlton Heston.
this guy, here he's no Charlton Heston, but l'd fuck him.
after a few gin and tonics l would fuck him silly.
l mean, he deserves a callback for sure.
all right, well, who... who in this group would you fuck sober?
hm. Sober.
Yeah.
Ooh, him.
him? A star?
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?
charisma, sensitivity, presence.
he's got that, you know, refugee survivor grit. Yeah.
Oh, and l would... l'd fuck him good.
l mean, look, l'm not saying he'd be a Steve McQueen kind of movie star, but, you know, he's got Gene Hackman potential for sure.
Oh, yeah. l'd fuck him.
right? All right.
so who would you fuck, unconditionally?
unconditionally...
so is someone gonna say, like, " action " ?
would you like that? lf you like it.
sure. l will.
this is Ronney, the director. So he's gonna call " action. "
thank you. OK.
action.
you've offended me and you've offended my family.
Cole, can l ask you to do it again?
of course, sure. Do you... l...
lf you want me to change it around or something, l can...
could you wait one second?
l think he needs to be more intense.
Yeah. Yeah. Um, just... Maybe... Yeah, go ahead.
maybe a little more intensity.
you seem happy that they offended you.
you shouldn't... l'm happy to be here.
that's really nice and we're thrilled to have you, but, Cole, maybe a little, you know, anger.
anger is hurt turned out.
l think... l think maybe a little anger.
you've offended me and you've offended my family.
Oh... What?
Oh, come on. l mean, maybe if he had the teensiest bit of confidence, but this guy?
no, wait a minute. Wait a minute, no, l...
Yeah, l would still fuck him, even without the confidence.
no, you think so, but you wouldn't.
Oh, yes, l would. l would. And...
He...wouldn't have to buy me dinner beforehand.
l would just... fuck him.
all right, Ronney, are you listening to yourself? 'Cause now you just sound silly.
what? Who are you to tell me who l wanna fuck?
no, you're totally right. You're right.
you can want to fuck whoever you please 'cause you're the director.
Absolutely. l'm sorry. You're right.
lt's OK.
Hi! l am so sorry, everyone.
l know you've been so patient. Thank you for waiting.
we are finally ready and before l put the list up, l just want to congratulate all of you.
we saw some really wonderful auditions today.
Congratulations. Have a good night.
excuse me.
Yeah! Yes!
all right!
l told you! l told you.
look. We made it?
so. Raja. how do you feel right now ?
all l can say is l did my best.
do you think that you'll return to your career in the medical field?
probably not.
l heard Warner's is doing a musical about Geronimo.
maybe l could pass for an lndian.
so. Breeze. how often do you get to relax like this near the pool?
you know what most people don't realize?
being an actor is a 24hour job, man.
like right now, l'm working.
l'm taking the time to finetune my appearance in order to be that image that's on the screen that's bigger than life, baby.
see, Breeze Loo isn't just the cat that you see sitting in front of you right now.
no. Breeze Loo is an idea.
he's a force of nature that includes each individual out there that keeps that Breeze Loo juggernaut alive and pumping.
l work very hard at what it is that l do.
all l ask is for those individuals out there to do the exact same thing pull their weight.
that's why l fired my agents.
so, then, what's your next career move?
l got the Bruce Lee audition tomorrow.
but what about your refusal to audition and your " offeronly " policy?
l realized it's a bit premature for me to be considering any offers at this point in time, mainly because the producer and director really don't know how much they need me.
so, l'm gonna go through this audition process, they're gonna see firsthand how much better l am than the competition, and then they're gonna pay the full price of what the Breezy Breeze is worth.
$500. that's what we paid for Breezy.
we couldn't have children of our own. Oh, we certainly tried, but, uh...
well, we got Breezy when we lost Penny and that was horrible.
Yeah. Yeah, Penny was our cocker spaniel and she died and...
my wife was so upset, so, uh...
to make her feel better, we got Clarence.
breeze. Breeze.
$500. that's what it cost.
Tom, don't talk prices.
why not? That was a lot of money then.
well, Breezy certainly is generous with us.
he gave us this house and a big Cadillac and all this art.
Oh, yeah, we sure as hell won't forget what he looks like, that's for sure.
my dad fought in the Korean War.
that's where he met my mom and me.
Yeah, most guys, they would have made the women leave the babies, but not Cole's dad.
lf not for him, l never would've met Cole.
Yeah, we grew up in Alabama where l was the only Asiatic and Saraghina was the only Colombian in town.
we weren't very popular.
Yeah, if l got hit in the head with a bottle, l knew it was the white kids.
lf it was a rock, it was the black kids.
lt all hurt the same.
we dreamed of leaving the South.
we even tried getting rid of our Southern accents.
we'd sit around for hours, talking like our favorite movie stars.
Mmhm. Mine was Grace Kelly.
Mr. Rogers.
buddha never bowled! He won't be bought and sold!
buddha never bowled! He won't be bought and sold!
buddha never bowled! He won't be bought and sold!
buddha never bowled! He won't be bought and sold!
buddha never bowled! He won't be bought and sold!
buddha never bowled! He won't be bought and sold!
Tarrick's always been very active, just like his dad.
many men abandon their families with all sorts of pathetic excuses but Derrick,
Tarrick's dad, was in his own league.
first of all, he was a real narcissist.
he named his sons Garrick, Tarrick and Erick.
lf we had girls, what would he have named them?
anyway, the marriage didn't work out, mainly because Derrick was an abusive drunk.
l can't believe l put up with that shit.
he moved to Cincinnati after the divorce.
l was relieved, to tell you the truth, but to completely cut off all contact with the kids, his own sons, l mean, who does that?
he wanted a new family, fine, but guess what he had the balls to name the kids?
Garrick, Tarrick and Erick same goddamn names in the same goddamn order.
who does that?
I used to have meaty roles that any actor would kill for.
I was entrusted to play characters well beyond my age range and from various walks of life.
but that was college.
Hey, man, have you seen my brownies?
l saw them.
and then l ate them.
you what? That's my evidence!
l don't know what to tell you, man.
the more l ate, the hungrier l got.
that will be 14. 39. Yeah!
you know what? You're nothing but a big...
now, that's what l call saved by the bell.
Hi. That'll be 11.76.
well. the good news is.
I've been in 12 feature films and 23 TV shows.
OK, that will be...
...9. 69.
and the bad news is. every role except for one was a Chinese food delivery boy.
last week. I got a call from this agency.
they said they wanna represent me.
I mean. this could be huge for my career.
gentlemen, this is Troy Poon. There you are.
they're one of the biggies.
finally. representation with power.
they can fight for my artistic integrity.
thank you for coming in. Appreciate it. lt's good to be here.
we think you're a movie star.
so no more TV.
we are gonna reintroduce you to the world in a big way.
l just got you a meeting with this hip young director who is starting a major motion picture, and he's looking for a yellow lead.
this flick has a builtin audience. A lot of action.
some cool camera work. Groovy soundtrack.
we're talking major opportunity.
you ever hear of Bruce Lee?
anyway, he's hotter now than when he was alive.
lmagine, getting to be Bruce Lee.
right when it matters most.
what in the hell was that?
huh?
Cole. why did you choose Saraghina to be your manager?
when l told her l was going to be an actor, l think the idea of me kissing other women upset her.
well, l mean, when you feel so strongly for someone, it's hard to see them do something like that with someone else.
what if there's a kissing scene in The Game of Death?
Saraghina's gonna be right there with me, and she's gonna realize it's not a big deal, right, hon?
how has your relationship been affected by your new professional partnership?
lt's been, um... a bit challenging, because as his girlfriend l try not to tell him what to do, but as his manager, l have to tell him what to do.
no, you don't. We can figure it out together.
but l'm your manager. You asked me to be your manager.
l know. That's my job.
l'm doing my job. What do you expect me to do?
you're doing a great job, honey.
no, l'm not. You know, you don't even listen to me.
l'm trying to help you, but you're running around getting autographs, you're eating chili fries when you're supposed to be fit and...
l don't know.
what? See? l wind up feeling like your mother.
l'm listening, OK? Oh, baby.
l'm serious. You're doing a great job, OK?
you're doing a great job.
can you pass me a napkin?
so, round two, l thought, you know they all take karate classes and things, so l needed something that was going to separate the boys from the men.
attention!
give us one line facing front. Now!
so l thought Mac and TJ, having had all that Vietnam experience, you know, killing, you know, babies and running around hurting civilian people, l kinda feel like they have a life experience that is gonna lend a little uh...a little gutso to this process.
l understand we're here to help you pretend to be real men. ls that right?
that's kinda funny to me.
cause on the battlefield, you're either a shit bag or the real deal.
there's no mistaking the two.
see, the real men, they march towards the danger, and the shit bags, they stay back 'cause they never grew the balls to battle.
tell you the truth, you all look like shit bags to me.
but you'll get a chance to prove me wrong.
you will engage in oneonone combat.
see if any of you have any fight in you.
do you understand? Yes, sir, sir!
Oh.
a military boy.
you serve for Uncle Sam?
no.
fuckin' pussy.
who do we have here?
what's your name, boy? Remi Nguyen.
'Nguyen. " lsn't that a commie name?
no, l fight the Vietcong!
sneaky bastards, aren't they?
what's so funny, douche face?
nothing. Oh.
you think you're something special, don't you?
l'm gonna keep my eye on you.
we think it's sad what America has come to.
all you pinko fuckin' hippies taking our freedom for granted.
mac here, he gave up his eye for your freedom.
and you wanna know how you showed your gratitude?
l said, do you wanna know how you showed your gratitude?
you spit on us and burned our flag after we went through hell for you.
never knowing where the next bullet was gonna come from.
going into a village, not knowing who to shoot, who to kill.
tell 'em how it was, Mac.
hearing and smelling goddamn commies.
right, talk about the hell, Mac.
crawling on our bellies while those bastards were tunneling under us, ready to slice and dice us and eat us for dinner.
that's hell! Hell was... Tell 'em!
hell was getting called a gook by your own platoon while they step on your body and leave you for dead in My Lai village.
that's hell! Thinking you're the enemy!
spitting up blood, gasping for air, choking on your own vomit.
but let me make this clear.
l would have gone through that hell 1 4 times over to serve my country.
ROUD2：ONE ON ONE COMBAT
he has better legs. Much better legs.
l mean, we need to start thinking about...
that was good. That was good too.
Yeah, kill him.
no, no. Cross him off. He did not take that hit.
breeze Loo, what do you think about today's part of the audition?
l'm not exactly sure what this round is for, man.
l mean, aren't we auditioning for an acting role?
lt's a little overwhelming at times, you know?
you're in front of Mr. Loo like that and he's your idol.
I mean. I've seen him in tons of movies.
that's the reason I became an actor.
come on!
fight! Huh!
stop dancing!
it was the last straw . really.
I just couldn't take it anymore. you know ?
lt was bad enough that my client, Cole, choked, but l just couldn't handle the disappointment l felt towards my boyfriend, Cole.
you know, it was just...
lt was... too much.
so...
so that's why l broke up with him.
but l'm still his manager, though.
and, um...
so now l can guide his career without any of the guilt or the conflict or the drama.
l need to talk to you. Turn off the camera. l said shut it off!
we're... Get out!
shut your face! Get out!
you need to calm down!
I want you back.
we agreed this is how it needs to be.
No!
you stupid face!
finally. It was my chance to prove my value.
show 'em who I really am. you know ?
the color of my skin. my economic class...
none of it mattered. I was expressing myself.
the room was captivated. I could feel it.
and then he showed up.
Eli, hi! Ronney. Hey, how are ya?
when my stepcousin was abroad.
he caught Eli in a movie and tipped me off immediately.
l mean, he may be unknown here, but he just won the New Zealand Oscar for best actor.
and l think it's just a matter of time before he is the next David Carradine.
you know I'm saying?
G'day, guys.
that guy Eli waltzed in late like he owned the fucking place.
he didn't even show at the first round of auditions. How fair is that?
some of us know what struggle is.
some of us had to fight to get where we are.
Eli is not " some of us. "
how's it all going, everyone?
lt's good. Great.
Yeah, it's good fun. Eli...
Yeah, he's pretty good. lt's so obvious. lt is!
l mean, he is Bruce Lee, you know?
well, hold on. l mean, let's not get carried away with ourselves.
we have a few very, very solid options.
close the deal and cancel the next round. There's no need to keep looking.
what? What are you talking about?
lt would be a waste of everyone's time to keep looking.
OK, Ronney, you oughta know, that's just not how it's done.
l'm the director.
cast him now.
so, Eli, what's it like to be offered this role?
well, there's a certain amount of satisfaction that l feel when my work is acknowledged, you know?
what challenges do you expect when you take over for Bruce Lee?
well, you mean if l choose to take the role?
are you suggesting you're not gonna accept the part?
there's... there are some questions l need answered first, before l agree to anything.
like what? Well, firstly...
am l working with the right people?
you know, it's important to me.
secondly, is this really a safe and nurturing environment for me?
and third...
how is this for my career, you know?
l'm trying to build one, so it's important right now.
you know, this cat, Eli, does he have anything going on in his eyes? No.
does he even indicate for one second what's going on up here why he fights?
no. l see.
but do you think that his presence in the competition will affect your chances?
absolutely not. The cat's parlor tricks are just an act of desperation because he knows he doesn't have what it is that l was innately born with true power and the ability to destroy with my very presence.
this is just unacceptable.
all I asked for was a fair fight.
instead. I'm stuck here.
we're stuck here. in limbo.
waiting.
the studio just doesn't get it.
Eli's not even American. he's not even close to American.
and they're allowing him to come in here and hijack this whole process.
typical.
foreigners coming in here and taking our jobs.
we Asian Americans have it bad enough.
this is just insult to injury.
so what's about to happen next?
well, Eli called a meeting. Of course he did.
well, what do l do?
lt's... Ronney, it's an actor thing, OK?
you just stroke his dick a bit and, you know, he'll feel better.
lt's standard procedure, OK?
G'day, fellas! Hi.
l got you some coffee. Thank you.
Hey, Eloise. l just need to speak to the director alone.
Oh! Yeah.
alone. You mean us?
no, just the boom guy. Of course l mean you.
all right. What's on your mind?
Ronney? What happened?
are you OK?
do you wanna talk? l'm here for you. Ronney?
ls this his home?
eight.
here he is. Number nine.
you couldn't pay me enough to live here.
Ronney!
Ronney, can we talk, honey?
all right, come on. Look, it's not like he's Jesus or something.
l mean, we can do a lot better than, you know, Eli from New Zealand.
Ronney?
all right, Ronney, not to state the obvious or anything but Eli? Not a team player.
Eli cares only about Eli.
he would have been a nightmare to work with, trust me.
what's your next move?
you don't have to touch me.
Ronney.
Ronney, sweetheart?
goddamn fucking... goddamn fucking pussy!
OK, Ronney. Ronney, we haven't even seen the other actors on screen yet!
you know, and that's where it counts!
do you know how many amazing stars seem just... pathetic?
they were shit until they were projected on the silver screen. That is how it goes.
l mean, our best is probably still with us.
Ronney...
all right.
Ronney, here's what l'm gonna do for you, OK?
l am going to handle everything from here on, all right?
l'm gonna... l'm gonna run the screen tests myself and l will make the final choices for the studio, OK?
so don't you worry about it.
OK, let's go! Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Oh. Hi.
ROUND3：SCREEN TEST
well, well.
you made it. Surprised?
l'm only surprised that it took you so long.
lt takes time to track down cowards like you.
l wasn't the one who ran away last time.
that's because you were hiding behind the army of venom.
excuses, excuses.
l'm shocked to see you're fighting your own battles.
you will pay for your audacity.
run, baby, it's a trap!
kimberly, l'm not going anywhere without you!
l've got to hand it to you, brother.
you always did have good taste in women.
brother. ln school, you always got the pretty ones.
unlike me.
you can't let the past be your master.
and you can never master the past.
but, my dear brother, l can seize the present!
you keep her out of this, brother. This is between you and me.
we're not kids anymore.
you can't tell me what to do.
and besides, you're in no position to call the shots now.
l can't let you get away with this.
move another inch closer and you will have a very dead girlfriend.
do you really think l'm gonna let stand here...
do you really think l'm gonna stand here and let...
l'm sorry. Can we just cut that and we'll just start from the top?
no, we're fine, Breeze.
why don't we go six lines back when l enter the forest?
lt's not necessary. He's good, l'm good.
he's seen all he needs to see. l'm good.
Yeah, but we don't have a clean take
we've seen it. We've seen it.
lt's enough? Yeah.
thank you, Breeze. Thanks, Breeze.
that's ridiculous. They cut you off and you were just getting started.
l thought we were working with professionals!
l agree. That's why you need someone who will fight for you, someone like me.
Cole, are you ready?
you call me.
Thanks. Cole, are you ready?
Cole?
OK, let's go.
roll camera.
mark it.
set.
action.
look at you. You're powerless.
Tonguetied, brother?
you may be holding the cards, but you have nothing.
that's why you're trying to take everything away from me.
but it won't work because you have to live with yourself.
who are you, really?
you're the worst kind of villain that pretends to be something that they're not, a monster who acts like they care about people, but then will betray them when they least expect it.
Yeah, l may have been a fool for trusting you, but that was my biggest crime.
but you...
Oh, you'll get what you deserve.
maybe not now, but all your lies will catch up to you, and you will be left alone to see yourself and suffer.
Wow. Where's he going?
Cole, that was... Cole? Oh, my...
Where's Breeze?
where the fuck is Breeze?
a screen test to me is like going to the bathroom for anyone else.
lt's not exactly fair. l have much more camera time than pretty much any of the other candidates.
you know, for me, it's the difference between preparation and actually acting.
lt's pretty seamless. lt's not really there.
Hey, fucker.
Cole?
Cole, Cole, Cole! What are you doing?
get off me!
Cole! Cole! You asshole.
stop that! Stop it! You're gonna hurt him.
Cole? Breeze. Breeze, are you OK? Breeze!
Oh, my God! Breeze, can you hear me?
are you OK?
can you hear my voice? Guys! Breeze!
what's happened? ls everyone OK up there?
Cole, what was it like to see Saraghina talking to Breeze?
she just betrayed me in front of my face.
that's all l have to say.
breeze, what do you think of Cole Kim now?
he's a coward. Only a true coward would Pearl Harbor someone like this.
why did he attack you?
lt's the price of fame, baby.
what are the chances of you getting this part?
well, was it even a question from the start?
l mean, seriously, take a look.
l'm the real deal, baby. l mean, this is a bigtime Hollywood studio film.
do you think the studio was considering giving it to one of those other cats?
come on.
Hey, Doc.
Reggie!
when did you become a doctor? What the hell is going on here?
my name is Raja.
Really?
Cole.
Cole is intense.
he did some really good work. He did, but, uh...
l'm sorry. l gotta go with my gut and the gut never lies.
OK. Well, uh, l don't know.
he's kind of...
l don't feel comfortable around him at all.
Really? No. He's really creepy.
well, Ronney, Jack Nicholson's kind of creepy.
l mean, creepy's... creepy's in.
no.
all right.
OK, got it.
well, you know what? We've got Breeze.
l mean, Breeze is a pretty safe bet.
makes sense.
OK.
all right, so Breeze.
Yes. OK.
Cole and Breeze. OK.
anyone else? No.
no. No one else is really gonna cut it, l don't think.
well, we need to find one or two more for the studio, cover our ass.
Yeah, fine. Fine.
l have my pick, so you can choose the backups.
OK, well, Cassie, uh... why don't you choose the backups, OK?
OK. Sure, yeah.
they will tell you you are not unique, you are not one of a kind.
you are. You are, and in your poetry, when you speak...
Oh, my God, Breeze!
Oh, my God. What happened?
excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse us.
what in the hell is going on here? First of all, where in the hell is Cole?
l've been calling him. He's not picking up. Fuck.
OK, can someone tell me why the fuck the white guy showed up, please?
he's like a fucking fungus. l asked you for two backups...
Hey, Dad. Hey!
Mr. Kurtainbaum, l would like to introduce you to the finalists for the film.
would you get 'em out of here, please? What?
please go. Get 'em out. Out of the office?
now. Now.
go... You too, please. Please.
l'm gonna ask you once, please go.
go. Just a few minutes?
this will just take a few minutes.
l told you once, l told you twice, now go!
are you guys fucking retards or what?
we just spent a week of good money on this bullshit!
do you have any idea any idea what's going on here?
you give me some crippled Chink, a white guy and some guy who's obviously, what?
two feet taller than the real Bruce Lee!
God!
you're... you're fired.
and you're fired! Dad! Dad!
fired! Dad, please!
Ronney had a vision of a man...
a vision, my ass. Go! Go!
but we can't find him. OK, OK.
please, would you go...
go! Dad, please? Dad, please!
son, go!
Oh, you. Who said you could stay?
take your fucking fishing pole and go fish somewhere else, but not in my pond!
so how do you plan on completing the film now ?
we're in the business of making money. lt's very simple.
we own some footage of someone who's very famous, but he's dead.
we need to find someone who looks like him so he can walk around for an hour so we can package the picture and sell it as a whole movie.
huh?
what's so hard about that?
are you gonna conduct another search to find a replacement?
search? What search are you talking about?
l can go down to fucking Chinatown and find someone who looks just like him.
five minutes.
but would that be the right person for the part?
faster than you could say.
l found him.
and his brother.
howdy, pardners. lt's EZ Breezy bringing you the best deals in the Wild, Wild West.
this Gremlin's a peppy critter that'll outrun any rapscallion that dares to race it.
that's right, ladies and gentlemen. lt's got 63, 000 miles and it's listed at $470.
$470? l think that's hogwash!
l'll give it to you for $440.
that's right, l said $440 and l'm not bluffing, but you gotta mosey on down here mighty quick 'cause this here Gremlin's going fast!
frankly, that audition process was eyeopening for me.
lt made me realize that the only way to effect change is from a position of power.
no longer will l be at the mercy of someone else's whims, you know?
what is it you're doing now?
directing and starring in my first film.
but it's not just a movie l'm creating, it's a... it's a watershed event.
till now, the AsianAmerican male has been neutered and castrated by being systematically excluded from the sexual landscape of America.
ls that why you went into pornography?
lt's a revolution.
so, Cole and Saraghina, what's been happening with you two?
well, we were having a few problems but, well, we worked them out.
Mmhm, and we're getting married.
l just can't imagine my life without her.
and... action!
action! Oooh!
Oh, that looks terrible. Yeah, that's really bad.
Oh, baby, that was so sexy. Do it again.
Oh, l like it!
l'm gonna gash your head open! Do it!
this is like Crash.
look at his face, dude!
Lasttake shuffle!
spin kick?
action!
you know, people say l have a hairy problem.
l don't quite understand.
check the gate so we won't be late
there's a party goin' on after the gate
so when a position opened in the Art History department...
...she pursued it single-mindedly until she was hired.
it was whispered that Katherine Watson...
...a first-year teacher from Oakland State...
...made up in brains what she lacked in pedigree.
which was why this bohemian from California...
... was on her way to the most conservative college in the nation.
excuse me, please. -Oh ， sorry.
excuse me.
excuse me. The bus?
keep walking, ma'am. -Thank you.
but Katherine Watson didn't come to Wellesley to fit in.
she came to Wellesley because she wanted to make a difference.
violet. -My favorite ltalian professor.
nice summer? -Terrific， thanks.
who's that over there? -Where?
Oh， Katherine Watson. New teacher in Art History. I'm dying to meet her.
who knocks at the Door of Learning?
I am every woman. -What do you seek?
to awaken my spirit through hard work...and dedicate my life to knowledge.
then you are welcome.
all women who seek to follow you can enter here.
I now declare the academic year begun.
a shame you didn't come yesterday. It's so quiet before the girls arrive.
just a few rules. No holes in the walls.
no pets, no loud noises, no radio or hi-fi after 8 on weekdays...
...10 on weekends...
...no hot plates and no male visitors.
anything wrong?
I don't think I can go a year without a hot plate.
don't you just love chintz?
and look.
they match.
Sweet,right? Your room's here.
my room is just across the way...
...and Amanda Armstrong's down the other end.
you grew up here? -My whole life.
you'll meet my parents when they come to visit.
they visit? -Regularly.
what do you teach? -Speech， elocution and poise.
dinners are communal, so I'll handle that.
but breakfast and lunch, you're on your own. So...
...we each get our own shelf. I'll make your label this evening.
I don't need to tell you, everything on our individual shelves is sacrosanct.
I just knew when we met.....we'd be instant friends.
be careful. They can smell fear.
good morning. -Good morning.
thank you.
this is History of Art.
we'll be following Dr. Staunton's syllabus.
any questions so far? -Your name?
why don't you go first? -Connie Baker.
Katherine Watson. Nice to meet you. -Dr. Watson, I presume.
not yet. And you are? -Giselle Levy.
Susan Delacorte. -Thank you, Susan Delacorte.
from the beginning, man has always had the impulse to create art.
can anyone tell me what this is? -Wounded Bison, Altamira, Spain...
...about 15,000 B. C. Joan Brandwyn.
very good, Joan.
despite the age of these, they are technically sophisticated because
the shading and the thickness of the lines moving over the bison's hump.
ls that right? -Yes, that's exactly right.
next slide.
this is probably less familiar. It was discovered by archeologists
in 1879, Lascaux, France. Dates back to 10,000 B.C.
singled out because of flowing lines depicting the movement of the animal.
lmpressive. Name? -Herd of Horses.
I meant yours. -We call her Flicka.
Elizabeth Warren. They call me Betty.
very good.
Betty is also correct.
just because something is ancient doesn't mean that it is primitive.
for example. Next slide, please.
Mycerinus and His Queen. 2470 B.C.
it's a funerary statue of the pharaoh and queen...
...originally intended to preserve the pharaoh's ka. Soul.
have any of you taken Art History before?
no.
let's go on. Slide.
seated Scribe. Egypt. 2400 B. C.
peasant Couple Plowing. Sixteenth century B. C. Egypt.
snake Goddess. Minoan. 1 600 B. C.
fresco. Minoan. 1 600 B. C.
funeral Mask. Mycenaean. 1 200.
could someone please get--?
thank you.
by a show of hands only...how many of you have read the entire text?
and the suggested supplements. -Long way from Oakland State?
well, you girls do prepare.
if you've nothing else for us, we could go to independent study.
I was in California once. How do you get work done with all that sunshine?
we tan in class. -Really?
no.
you know, not everybody wanted you.
I'm not naming any names.
these jobs usually go quickly. Ex-students, friends of, you know...
...the right people.
the person they wanted took a job at Brown, and no one else was available.
so here you are.
you can go in now. Good luck.
your first class left a lot to be desired， Miss Watson.
and I'm curious about the subject of your dissertation.
you suggest, "Picasso will do for the 20th century...
...what Michelangelo did for the Renaissance, unquote.
in terms of influencing movements.
so these canvases that they're turning out these days...
...with paint dripped and splotched on them...
...they're as worthy of our attention as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel?
I'm not comparing them.
have you ever seen the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?
actually stood there?
I've never been to Europe.
I can assure all of you this is the place I want to be more than anything.
better discipline next class， Miss Watson.
hello. -It's me.
Hey! -Collect from Katherine Watson.
will you accept? -Yeah， sure， of course I will.
Hey, is everything okay?
Yeah.
tough, huh?
well, how are the classes?
snobs, right?
I hate to say I told you so. -You don't have to.
I can't really talk right now.
I'll write you tonight.
so you got a fella?
he's-- He's there. I'm here.
long distance. Torture. I know. Come. Come in and sit down.
when Lenny left for the South Pacific， it nearly broke my heart.
we wrote every day until...
he was a great man.
I'm sorry. -lt was a hundred years ago.
I'm babbling.
I love Lucy. Even if she is a communist.
the only thing red about Lucy is her hair.
and even that's fake. Desi said it.
Winchell wrote it.
Amanda Armstrong. I see you survived.
Katherine Watson. Just barely.
Oh, good. You've met. Katherine's taken the third bedroom.
how about a little dinner before What's My Line?
how about a little drink?
her companion died in May.
companion?
you know, companion.
Josephine Burns. Taught biology here for 30 years.
you'll love it here, Katherine. You'll see.
I already do. I-- Honestly, it's beautiful. It's perfect, really.
well, don't fool yourself. They have claws underneath their white gloves.
who?
the alumnae, their offspring, the faculty. You name it.
watch out for yourself.
too much independence frightens them.
will you please stop? -Oh, a word of advice.
don't let those girls know that they got to you.
they didn't. -Good for you.
you almost convinced me.
what is that? -You tell me.
carcass by Soutine. 1 925.
it's not on the syllabus. -No, it's not.
is it any good?
come on, ladies. There's no wrong answer.
there's also no textbook telling you what to think.
it's not that easy, is it?
all right. No. It's not good.
in fact, I wouldn't even call it art. It's grotesque.
is there a rule against grotesque art?
I think there's something aggressive about it...
...and erotic. -To you, everything is erotic.
everything is erotic. -Girls.
aren't there standards? -Of course.
otherwise a tacky velvet painting could be equated to a Rembrandt.
my Uncle Ferdie has two tacky velvet paintings. He loves those clowns.
there are standards, technique， composition, color, even subject.
so if you're suggesting that rotted side of meat is art...
...much less good art, then what are we going to learn?
just that.
you have outlined our new syllabus， Betty. Thank you.
what is art? What makes it good or bad?
and who decides?
next slide, please.
twenty-five years ago someone thought this was brilliant.
I can see that. -Who?
my mother. I painted it for her birthday.
next slide. This is my mom.
ls it art? -It's a snapshot.
if I told you Ansel Adams had taken it， would that make a difference?
art isn't art until someone says it is. -It's art!
the right people. -Who are they?
Betty Warren!
we're lucky we have one right here. -Screw you.
could you go back to the Soutine， please?
just look at it again. Look beyond the paint.
let us try to open our minds to a new idea.
all right, back to chapter three. Has anyone read it?
okay.
when your courses are set, and a dream boat you've met...
...have a real cigarette. Have a Camel.
I've got my courses, I've got my Camel cigarette. Where is my dream boat?
Giselle, where is my dream boat? -Betty's cousin isn't good enough?
I haven't met him. -Don't encourage her.
he's only escorting Connie as a favor.
why are you like this?
I didn't mean that.
I'm just under so much pressure with the wedding.
do you realize November 2 is three weeks from now?
Oh, honey. -Don't have it.
don't come. -Here. Here.
I'm working on table seating now, so I can just erase your name.
can I see it? -No.
let me look. I can't look for a second?
you want to see where Bill is sitting. -No. That is over. Right?
right? Giselle, right?
damn it.
do I look a little bit like her? -Like who?
Katherine Watson. -You mean, "crap is art"?
I think she's fabulous. -Well, no man wanted her.
she isn't dead. -She's at least 30.
Oh, no. No. -I guess she never wanted children.
for your information...
...Katherine Watson had to take this job to escape from California.
please.
she had a torrid affair with a Hollywood movie star.
she came here to get away. -That's ridiculous.
who was it? -I don't know.
who was it, Giselle? Don't be a pimple! Tell me!
it's ridiculous. -Tell me. No， it's not. You know.
you know something. Tell me. -It's William Holden.
fantastic! -I know.
who is it?
william Holden.
I know. I know. I'm late. I'm-- Abject pleading, apologies, forgiveness.
is she giving you any trouble?
if these girls can't get back on time， know what I say? Lock them out.
come on. Out! I'm going to lock the door. Out!
bedtime, ladies. Bedtime. Let's go. Bedtime.
Hey, Betty. -Quiet time， ladies.
women like Katherine Watson don't get married...
...because they choose not to. -No woman chooses to live...
...without a home, unless she's sleeping with her ltalian professor.
you are so critical. -I am not.
of course you are. You're your mother's daughter.
it's a classic Electra complex.
I don't blame you. I mean...
...who wouldn't want to murder your mother?
Hey. How's the Harvard sweetheart? -Divine.
got an extra ciggie?
did you do his homework? -Of course.
want to do mine? -No.
this isn't what I think it is. Is it?
Where'd you get it?
from the school nurse.
it's against the law. -Oh, honey. It's a girl's best friend.
a certain kind of girl. -Meet the last virgin bride.
Spencer is a gentleman. -And even gentlemen have dicks.
maybe I'll get one. -What? A dick?
don't be stupid, Connie.
Someone， somewhere, someday might be interested.
just in case. Just in case, I'll be prepared.
was that necessary?
I was taught it's best to speak honestly.
okay. You're a bitch.
we recently learned that Amanda Armstrong...
...our nurse, has been distributing contraception to Wellesley girls.
this revelation is disturbing to an institution... that prides itself on propriety.
go, go, go! Go, go! It's been going on since the late '80s.
whoever wins is first to marry! -Do the girls take it literally?
only the girl with the winning hoop. Oh， look, it's Phyllis Nayor!
good for her. It gets me every time.
why the buggies? -They've got their man.
they're wishing for their babies.
have you seen this?
what is it?
it's a front-page attack on Amanda Armstrong. Betty Warren wrote it.
by providing contraception on demand, our school nurse...
...is little more than a cheerleader for promiscuity. Wow.
Oh, they're not going to dump her in a lake!
I'm coming, Phyllis! -Have you seen this?
I wouldn't worry. Betty's just a young girl flexing her muscles.
so was Lizzie Borden， and her mother wasn't president...
...of the alumnae association. -Would somebody get that girl a towel!
that's her mother? -Apple, tree.
is Amanda going to get into trouble?
Amanda needs to start minding her p's and q's.
the trick to surviving Wellesley is never getting noticed.
Ciao, Mona Lisa.
the big war hero.
he thinks he's something special.
he sleeps with his students.
the gold is fine. The napkin rings are vulgar.
the glassware should be trimmed with gold.
the little sugar boxes, gold and white， filled with chocolate. No candlesticks.
freesia instead of daisies. -Wise choice, madam.
no baby's breath.
you already had your fitting? -We're on our way.
here's the seating chart and Spencer's list of groomsmen.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I spoke to him about reading the poem. He'd rather not. I said all right.
excuse us for a second, Joan.
a good wife lets her husband think that everything's his idea...
...even when it's not. -I don't care if he reads it.
you will in retrospect.
now, why don't you see if you can't nudge the idea into his head.
I've been here now for 21 years， Jocelyn.
I remember you as a student. -Twenty-four, if you count that.
so why the theatrics?
we cannot appear to promote sexual promiscuity.
okay. It's about appearances, then? No.
all right, all right.
all right. Well, I promise not to appear to be sympathetic, progressive...
...or what did Mrs. Warren call it? Liberal.
Scout's honor.
I spent the better part of Friday afternoon convincing the alumnae...
...that your record was impeccable...
...that you would no longer provide contraceptive devices...
...and you'd make a public statement to that effect.
I'm not willing to make a public statement.
it doesn't matter, Amanda.
they're letting you go.
it's out of my hands.
and this champagne cup is in the wrong place.
and up and down. And up.
Katherine. Good evening, Miss Watson.
good evening, Miss Watson. -Join us.
no.
good night, Miss Watson. -Good night， Miss Watson.
and down. Very nice. Very nice.
Hey.
heard about Amanda. I'm sorry.
she seemed all right about it. I wouldn't be.
they don't give you too many chances around here.
Oh, that depends how much they hate you to begin with.
can I buy you a drink? Or are you here for dinner?
how long do the marriage lectures take?
get this woman a booth.
your husband is at a crossroads in his career.
he's competing for promotion against two rivals, Smith and Jones.
to get the edge, you have wisely decided to invite the boss.....and his wife to a 7:00 dinner.
you've carefully planned your meal...
...set your table and arranged for a babysitter.
Oh, we have babies! -Yes， and I have twins!
then, surprise. It's 6: 1 5...
...and your husband's called to say that Smith， Jones and their wives...
...have been invited at the boss's request.
ever the Wellesley girl...
...you keep your cool and understand...
...that the boss is probably testing you as much as your husband. What next?
yes? -File for divorce?
that's very funny.
but the thing is, it's not a joke.
a few years from now your sole responsibility...
...will be taking care of your husband and children.
you may all be here.....for an easy A...
...but the grade that matters the most is the one he gives you， not me.
you'll need to-- -Whatever you do...
...don't put the boss's wife next to your husband.
why not? -She's screwing him.
is that where you learned to speak ltalian? In ltaly?
Yeah.
have you got a boyfriend? -Yes.
you know, if you were mine, I'd never let you go.
I wouldn't have asked your permission.
Yeah, they say you're progressive.
a forward thinker.
are you? -There are a lot of labels here...
...I've noticed.
right family, right school, right art， right way of thinking.
well, saves the effort on thinking for yourself.
how do you expect to ever make a difference if everything is a joke?
Oh, Katherine Watson comes to Wellesley to set us all free? Come on.
thank you for the drink. -No, no. Wait. I was teasing.
they have their own way of doing things here.
you've just gotta find a way to work with them. We all had to.
I'm sorry.
five years ago, they'd have slapped my wrist.
but now there's a committee for the protection of everything.
they think you're dangerous?
Oh, no, darling. No. Subversive.
it's gotten to the point...
...where you don't know who is protecting whom from what.
or should that be "from whom"? Well， whom gives a damn anyway?
they're doing me a favor really.
will you be all right?
better than that.
I should really have left when Josephine died.
nothing left to love here anymore. So...
Hello?
miss Watson? -Yes. I'm back here.
I've never been to this part of campus before. Where are we?
no man's land. So to speak.
come on in.
what's all this?
different things different days.
people who inspire me, artists I admire, editorials I don't.
so you came to see me.
you gave me a C. -I'm kind.
the assignment was to write about Bruegel. I did that.
no, what you did was copy Strauss. -I was referencing an expert.
if I wanted to know what he thought, I'd buy his book.
miss Watson, with all due respect...
bruegel was a storyteller. Find the stories.
break them down into smaller pieces. You might actually enjoy it.
you're giving me another chance? -So it seems.
is that my file? What's it say?
well, let's see.
straight A's. -Until now.
president of the poetry society, captain of the debate team...
...co-captain of the tennis club, founder of the horticulture league.
I sound like a pompous ass. -Yes, you do, but a very busy one.
and it says here that you're pre-law. What law school are you gonna go to?
I hadn't thought about that. After I graduate, I'm getting married.
and then? -And then I'll be married.
you can do both.
just for fun, if you could go to any law school, which would it be?
Yale.
Yale.
they keep five slots open for women， one unofficially for a Wellesley girl.
but you haven't really thought about it.
wake up, Joanie, wake up. Wake up.
okay, don't get up.
don't hear what I have to say about Tommy and Spencer...
...Iooking at an engagement ring.....for you.
you're sure?
that's everything we always wanted， huh?
we'll be best friends, and our husbands will be best friends...
...and we'll have houses together and we'll have babies together...
...and they'll be best friends.
you're going to be Mrs. Tommy Donegal.
when?
I'll get the scoop tomorrow. You go back to sleep.
the first part of the exam will consist of two pairs of slides.
please identify each of the slides by name, period and date.
then compare and contrast them.
you will have 10 minutes for each pair.
then you will write a 1500-word essay...
...describing the stylistic differences between Raphael and van Eyck.
eyes forward, Miss Delacorte.
you have 40 minutes.
good luck.
excuse me. -Governor. Another shot， please.
this way, please. Thank you.
excuse me.
this is quite the event.
I'm surprised I was invited. -Well， look around you.
who wasn't?
you ever hear the expression "Keeping up with the Joneses"?
of course.
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Jones.
the actual, historical family they invented the phrase about.
good to know.
that's him!
thank you. -Good to see you.
thank you very much. -A beautiful dress.
Hi, we're so glad you came.
we're together. Table 1 9. -Good.
holy God!
the governor is right behind you. Don't turn around.
great band.
violet. -Yes?
would you mind if I go here? -Not at all.
over here. Thank you.
great band. -Great band.
Hi, Katherine. -Hi， Professor Dunbar.
I'm getting a Manhattan. Like anything?
no, thank you.
I'll take a Jack and ginger.
he's making his move.
I knew he'd go for her.
she's too old for him.
she's too smart for him.
hold that.
they're playing our song. -What?
they're playing our song. -I heard you.
Hi. -Hi, Giselle.
ladies' choice? -Sure.
excuse me.
ladies, gentlemen! Quiet!
what's this about the poem you wanted me to read?
lt was your idea, remember? -I never said that.
ready?
excellent.
well, I wrote this down， just in case you forgot. It's my favorite.
smile.
now, Betty, I tried to think of a million ways to tell you how I feel.
but instead...
...I prefer to your favorite poem.
good catch. -You said it.
he's a morsel. Miss Watson!
he's a favor. Remember? -Come on.
miss Watson, I want you to meet Tommy.
Tommy, come here for a second.
you are so beautiful.
this is Katherine Watson. -Oh, wow! In the flesh.
she has not shut up about you. -Oh， stop.
you know what I'm saying? -I do.
you did something to impress her. -Well, it seems you did too.
you make these especially well. -Thank you.
I had a fella. Lenny.
you remind me of him so much.
he had this...funny little thing where his two front teeth...
...they overlapped.
he's dead.
south Pacific.
my parents say my future is right on the horizon.
tell them the horizon is an imaginary line...
...that recedes as you approach it.
I think I'll go back to my seat.
I had a really nice time. Thank you.
Connie.
ls this the brushoff? -No.
I thought you were， you know.....done with me.
why would you think that? -Betty said that you.
I don't wanna take advantage. I know that this was some favor.
she did me the favor, not you.
come on, dance with me.
she's too good for you.
maybe you're right.
I'm too good for you too.
but I have lower expectations. -I thought we settled this last spring.
so then we probably shouldn't have slept together over the summer.
stop.
you ready?
do you wanna know something funny?
Lenny's not dead.
not technically.
he...
he's got married.
he's got a wife and kids...and a mortgage.
it was all supposed to be mine, except for the wife.
and you... You don't look a thing like him.
you ugly bartender. -Stop it.
you couldn't shine his shoes. -I'm sorry.
it wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
it wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
which way? -Let me just see here.
I'm not sure.
where are we supposed to go? -I think it's here.
come this way. We're almost there.
Joe.
hello. -Hi. How are you?
great. Thank you so much for this. You're a pal.
it's a pleasure. Your timing is perfect.
there it is.
that's Jackson Pollock. -ln a word.
I was getting used to the idea of dead， maggoty meat being art, now this.
please don't tell me we have to write a paper about it.
do me a favor.
do yourselves a favor. Stop talking and look.
you're not required to write a paper. You're not even required to like it.
you are required...to consider it.
that's your only assignment today. When you're done, you may leave.
thank God Betty isn't here.
where did you come from?
Mars.
what a coincidence.
Tom Donegal came by to see Joan. So I hopped a ride.
Why?
so I could do this:
Katherine. -Yes?
have you got a minute? -Of course.
walk with me.
you going home for the holidays? -No.
too far? -Too expensive.
but I've never had a New England Christmas, so...
our weather hasn't scared you away? -I love it here.
do you?
I've been getting some calls about your teaching methods, Katherine.
they're a little unorthodox...for Wellesley.
we are traditionalists, Katherine. -Yes， I noticed.
so if you'd like to stay here...
ls that a question? -More a discussion.
about my staying here? -You'll have your formal review in May.
until then...
...a little less modern art.
happy holidays.
and to you.
afternoon. -Oh, hi
I hope you get that ring!
Bye, girls, see you next year. Have a safe trip.
so, what's the big hush-hush secret?
are we gonna hear the pitter-patter of little Spencers?
stop. They'll tell us when they're ready.
are you ready?
is she the cutest? You are the cutest. Come here, you.
Spencer's been made junior partner.
lt is about time. -And it's a significant raise too!
Betty! -What? I can say that, can't l?
to Tommy and Joan?
well, it is. So maybe a family isn't far behind.
let's take our coffee in the sitting room, shall we?
I'll help.
keep them closed. -All right.
beautiful! You've got everything you've ever dreamed of.
you will too.
I've got a secret to tell you. You swear you won't gab to anyone?
I got accepted early to Yale Law School.
to what?! Why?! You don't want to be a lawyer.
maybe I do.
you won't switch cold creams without asking me， but you applied to school?
on a lark. We never thought I'd get in.
who's "we"? -Miss Watson.
she practically filled out my application for me.
you've got to be kidding me! What right does she have?
you're getting married!
first of all, there's no ring on this finger.
second, I can do both. I can.
how does Tommy feel about this? -He doesn't know. No one does.
not even her? -No one.
Joanie! Betty!
you are this close to getting everything you ever wanted.
and this close to losing it.
I just got a call. They need me in New York tomorrow.
Joan and Tommy are here. Can't you leave in the morning?
then I'd miss the meeting. Sorry， guys. We take a rain check?
sure, buddy. -We'll see you in the new year.
happy and merry.
I'll call you in the morning.
coffee?
guess who has an early Christmas present?
Oh, my! How can you live like this? -Like what?
we'll just wait for you to tidy up a bit.
in this lifetime? It'll never happen. Come here, beautiful.
what are you doing here?
you still like it here? -I do. I like getting to know the girls.
most of the time.
and the weather. -Yeah, the weather's nice.
are you freezing? -Yeah.
your lips are a little blue. -I like them that way.
why didn't you bring a coat?
bill.
Giselle, what are you doing here?
freezing.
look, it's over. I can't see you anymore.
I can't. -I know.
really.
I just want to talk to you for a minute.
come on.
Oh, I missed you.
you're beautiful.
life without you...just isn't life.
and I don't want to go through life not living. Do you?
no.
I love you so much I would move to this elitist icebox if you want me to.
miss Watson?
Hi. I didn't know you were here.
Giselle Levy, Bill Dunbar， this is...
this is my... Paul. -Fiance.
as of about a minute and a half ago. Paul Moore.
God. Congratulations! Your fiance?
you must be thrilled.
I don't think she's caught her breath yet.
I haven't.
well, sit down. We'll have a toast. -We'd love to. We're in a hurry.
but that's really great. Congratulations， old man.
Congratulations. Merry Christmas. -Come on, let's...
best of tidings to you both. Bye.
no, Paul.
Nancy'll have a heart attack. She has these rules.
come on. -No.
Why? -I said no. I'm not comfortable.
I'll make up the convertible sofa.
what are you doing?
you're not kidding?
I just came 3000 miles to see you. I'm sleeping down here by myself?
stop. Stop. Stop for a second.
tell me what the hell's going on. -I don't know.
I feel like everything is getting away from me.
we haven't actually, literally looked at each other for three months...
...and now you're here, and I have this ring on my finger.
which makes you uncomfortable too?
the last time I checked, we weren't on this track.
when was the last time you checked?
bill...
the name is Paul.
I'm not saying no to you.
no, you're not saying anything.
you never really do.
if you need me for anything else, my number's on the refrigerator.
I feel so guilty leaving you alone after
I'm fine. I have lots of research to do.
that's right. Throw yourself into work.
I'll be back...on the 2nd.
see you next year.
sunflowers. Vincent van Gogh. 1 888.
he painted what he felt, not what he saw.
people didn't understand. To them, it seemed childlike and crude.
it took years for them to recognize his actual technique...
...to see the way his brush strokes seemed to make the night sky move.
yet, he never sold a painting in his lifetime.
this is his self-portrait.
there's no camouflage， no romance. Honesty.
now, 60 years later, where is he? -Famous?
so famous, in fact, that everybody has a reproduction.
there are post cards-- -We have the calendar.
with the ability to reproduce art, it is available to the masses.
no one needs to own a van Gogh original.
we do. In the Newport house.
but it's small. Tiny.
they can paint their own. Van Gogh in a box， ladies.
the newest form of mass-distributed art:
paint by numbers.
now everyone can be van Gogh. It's so easy.
just follow the simple instructions...
...and in minutes， you're on your way to being an artist.
van Gogh by numbers?
Ironic， isn't it? Look at what we have done to the man...
...who refused to conform his ideals to popular taste.
who refused to compromise his integrity.
we have put him in a tiny box and asked you to copy him.
so the choice is yours, ladies.
you can conform to what other people expect or you can
I know. Be ourselves.
you're a sight for sore eyes.
I would've been on time but, silly me, I thought class was in the classroom.
glad you could join us， Mrs. Jones. We thought we'd lost you.
there's an unwritten rule for marr-- -Don't bother.
since your wedding, you've missed six classes, a paper and your midterm.
well, thank God I didn't miss the paint-by-numbers lecture.
I was on my honeymoon and then I had to set up house.
what does she expect?
attendance.
it's A GOOD SHOW, MR. MONK. VERY OLD-FASHIONED.
no SEX OR ANYTHING.
I- I THINK YOU'D LIKE IT.
no, THANK YOU.
why, BECAUSE IT'S ON CHANNEL 11?
that's RIGHT.
but YOU'D WATCH IT IF IT WAS ON CHANNEL 10.
that's RIGHT.
okay, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
that YOU'RE FLIPPING THROUGH THE CHANNELS,
and YOU SEE A SHOW THAT YOU REALLY LIKE,
and IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE ON CHANNEL 23
why WOULD I BE FLIPPING CHANNELS?
if IT'S A GOOD SHOW, IT'S ON CHANNEL 10.
well, YEAH, I MEAN...
okay... OKAY.
uh, YEAH, HERE THEY COME.
uh, YEAH, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
thank YOU, DOCTOR.
who WAS THAT?
nobody.
you JUST SAID, "THANK YOU, DOCTOR."
no, I DIDN'T.
it WAS DR. KROGER.
the CRIME SCENE BOYS FOUND SOMETHING INSIDE
that MIGHT UPSET YOU.
that's WHY WE CALLED.
we FIGURED YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO HIM,
so HE SAID HE'D STAY UP AND WAIT FOR YOU.
did SOMEBODY DIE?
somebody WE KNOW?
it's NOT HOMICIDE.
nobody WAS HURT.
it's A STRAIGHT-UP BURGLARY.
monk, IT'S PRETTY INTENSE.
if YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT,
maybe YOU SHOULD JUST GO HOME.
I UNDERSTAND.
wait, WAIT, WAIT. COME ON.
no, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
we HAVE TO SEE.
we FOUND THIS BY THE FRONT DOOR.
it WAS, UH, FOLDED UP.
the GUY WHO BROKE IN MUST HAVE DROPPED IT.
to FORCE HEAVEN, MARS SHALL HAVE A NEW ANGEL.
some KIND OF CODE.
is THAT IT?
that's JUST AN APPETIZER.
apparently THIS GUY HAD A GROCERY LIST.
he TOOK A COUPLE OF CELL PHONES,
a FLASHLIGHT BULB,
some WATERPROOF SEALANT,
and SOME BRAIDED COPPER WIRE.
okay... HE'S MAKING A BOMB, REMOTE CONTROL.
I'm NOT DONE.
he ALSO TOOK TEN 20-VOLT MAGNESIUM BATTERIES.
20 YERS, I'VE ONLY SEEN ONE OTHER BOMB LIKE THAT.
Trudy?
he USED THIS TO PRY OPEN THE DOOR.
it's JUST A CROWBAR.
look AT THE FINGERPRINTS.
thumb, INDEX FINGER,
middle FGER, RING FINGER,

okay.
let's JUST REVIEW WHAT WE KNOW.
so THE PAGE WAS TORN OUT OF SOME KIND OF APPOINTMENT BOOK.
it's MARCH 14TH, WHICH IS TODAY.
11 P. M. IS CIRCLED.
so SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT AT 11 P. M.
now LET'S REVIEW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.
everything ELSE!
what's GOING TO HAPPEN? WHERE IS IT HAPPENING?
who IS INVOLVED?
I've BEEN WORKING ON THAT.
I BOUGHT A BOOK LAST NIGHT ON CODE BREAKING.
Oh! GOOD.

let's JUST THINK.
the PLANET?
no, THE GOD OF WAR.
maybe IT'S PART OF A POEM.
you KNOW? LIKE A REALLY DREADFUL POEM.
were YOU DRINKING FROM THIS?
no.
it's LIGHTER THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY.
about FOUR OUNCES.
Mr. MONK... YOU OKAY?
you STILL THINKING ABOUT THAT DREAM?
to SEE HER...
it MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL.
then I WAKE UP...
and SHE'S GONE AGAIN.
after ALL THESE YEARS...
to BE SO CLOSE.
Natalie, I CAN FEEL IT.
I CAN JUST FEEL IT.
it's RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!
to FORCE HEAVEN, MARS SHALL HAVE A NEW ANGEL.
to FORCE HEAVEN, MARS SHALL HAVE A NEW ANGEL.
why CAN'T I SEE IT?
why CAN'T...
Wha...

to FORCE HEAVEN.
you DID IT, DIDN'T YOU?
Oh, MY GOD, YOU FIGURED IT OUT!
I GOTTA CALL THE CAPTAIN.
everybody's GONNA WANNA HELP.

I HAVE TO GO MEET JULIE. SHE HAS THAT DANCE RECITAL.

your HONOR, MY CLIENT IS NOT A FLIGHT RISK.
he's A FORMER POLICE OFFICER.
he SERVED THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HONORABLY FOR 14 YEARS.
he STILL HAS FRIENDS IN DEPARTMENT,
some OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY.
I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT,
even IF HE WANTED TO FLEE,
my CLIENT DOESN'T DRIVE.

and TRUCKS.
and TRAINS.
he's NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
your HONOR, ON TUESDAY NIGHT,

to BOARD A BUS AND TRAVEL 95 MILES TO ANGEL COUNTY.
his RECORD OF SERVICE IS IMPRESSIVE.
but EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IS THE MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.
Mr. MONK'S MOTIVE IS CLEAR.
he WAS OBSESSED WITH THE VICTIM FRANK NUNN.
that's NOT GOOD.
furthermore, MR. MONK HAS ADMITTED UNDER OATH THAT HE OWNED THE GUN.
that HE TOOK THE GUN FROM HIS HOUSE.
that HE CARRIED IT TO THE CRIME SCENE.
and THAT IT NEVER LEFT HIS POSSESSION.
that's NOT GOOD.
and WE WILL INTRODUCE BALLISTIC EVIDENCE
which WILL PROVE THAT MR. MONK'S GUN
the GUN THAT CAME FROM THIE,
the GUN THAT NEVER LEFT HIS HAND IS THE SAME WEAPON
that FIRED THE FATAL BULLET.
it's ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
the BULLET DEFINITELY CAME FROM HIS GUN.
it's BEEN TESTED BY TWO DIFFERENT LABORATORIES.
bail IS SET AT $900, 000.
um... WITH THE COURT'S PERMISSION,
could YOU MAKE IT AN EVEN MILLION?
Oh, MY GOD.
what DO YOU THINK?
what?
right NOW, I'M AFRAID TO THINK.
he CAN'T GO TO PRISON. HE CAN BARELY SURVIVE OUT HERE.
okay, WELL, THERE'S GONNA BE A TRIAL.
I MEAN, IF HE GETS A GOOD LAWYER, RIGHT?
but ALL THE EVIDENCE. YOU HEARD THE JUDGE.
the BULLET CAME FROM HIS GUN.
monk SAID HE DIDN'T DO IT.
that's FUNNY- THIS IS THE KIND OF CASE
always SOLVES.
you KNOW, NOT FUNNY, "HA HA" FUNNY.
you KNOW, MORE LIKE... NOT FUNNY AT ALL FUNNY.
it WASN'T ME.
cap, IT WASN'T ME.

then HE DRANK SOME ORANGE JUICE. ABOUT FOUR OUNCES.
then HE FOUND MY HANDGUN.
he SWITCHED GUNS?
not THE WHOLE GUN, JUST THE BARREL.
my GUN'S A LANE & WESTING.
the BARRELS ARE INTERCHANGEABLE.
RIGHT-HE USED THE SIX-FINGERED MAN'S PRINTS
and THE NOTE TO LURE ME TO THE SCULPTURE GARDEN.
he WAS HIDING THERE, ABOUT 50 FEET BEHIND ME.
he WAITED FOR ME TO PULL MY GUN,
and THEN HE TOOK THE SHOT.
I NEED YOU FACE DOWN ON THAT FLOOR.
he TOLD ME TO LIE ON THE GROUND FACE DOWN.
that's PROBABLY WHEN HE DID IT.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
anything YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.
he SWITCHED THEM BACK.
so WHEN THE LAB SAID THE BULLET CAME FROM YOUR GUN...
they WERE RIGHT- IT WAS MY GUN.
at LEAST... PART OF IT.
okay, CAN YOU PROVE IT? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE?
okay.
Leland, ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?
I HAVE A PLASTIC TAB FROM A JUICE CONTAINER.
d- DO YOU HAVE ANY FINGERPRINTS?
fingerprints? UH... NO.
no.
that's NOT ENOUGH, IS IT?
no, IT'S NOT ENOUGH!
you OKAY?
who WAS THAT?
that WAS ADRIAN MONK.
you're KIDDING.
Nope.
I'm GONNA MEET HIM TONIGHT.
I JUST SET IT UP.
he WANTS ME TO BRING HIM SOME FOOD.
good WORK, CAPTAIN.
call THE TAC SQUAD.
he SAID I SHOULD COME ALONE.
Yeah, I'M SURE HE DID.
can I COME?
Yeah, SURE.
Hey, BUDDY!
I BROUGHT YOU SOME CHICKEN POT PIES.
did YOU HEAR THAT?
relax, WE'RE OKAY.
I TOLD YOU TO COME ALONE.
are YOU SETTING ME UP, LELAND?
monk, I SWEAR.
I TOLD YOU,
I CAN'T GO TO PRISON.
I- I CAN'T GO!
you KNOW I WOULDN'T SURVIVE IT.
just PUT THE GUN AWAY.
monk, PLEASE DROP THE GUN!
to be continued...
