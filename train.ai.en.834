but, sweetheart...
...l thought you liked working at the slaughterhouse for my daddy.
l did.
you got a real talent for this, boy.
someday this is all gonna be yours.
lt's just, as much as l loved it, Edith, l want more than that.
ain't no musician ever made no money, Dewey.
what? Of course they do. Plenty of them do.
name one.
slim Whitman.
who the hell is Slim Whitman?
all right, Frank Sinatra.
who the hell is Frank Sinatra?
Edith, l am starting to think...
...that maybe you don't believe in me.
l do believe in you.
l just know you're gonna fail.
what are you talking about, Edith? What about my dreams?
Edith, l told you, l can't build you a candy house!
lt will fall down! The sun will melt the candy! lt won't work!
lt will if it never rains.
Dewey, you have got to give up your dream.
dreams don't come true.
l am gonna make this dream come true.
nobody ever said it's gonna be easy.
lt's hard.
lt ain't easy to walk to the top of a mountain.
lt's a long, hard walk.
lt's a rocky road.
but l plan on walking.
Oh, l'm gonna walk.
hard.
l will walk hard.
walk hard.
l got a full house coming tonight.
lf Bobby Shad can't play l need to find someone who can.
l'm fine. l can play through the pain.
should've thought before you punched your landlord and got laryngitis.
l guess there's no music tonight.
Bullhickey! People come here to dance erotically!
l ain't got no music, l ain't got no nightclub.
excuse me.
l play a little.
l don't know how to tell you this, boy.
you're white. This crowd will eat you alive.
l been watching Mr. Shad every night.
l know all the songs.
lt'll be the same show.
lt'll be just like Bobby Shad and the Bad Men only it'll be me tonight.
this is crazy.
but l ain't got no other choice.
l don't mean to put more pressure on you, boy.
the suits from the record company just got here.
Oh, okay.
scared?
a little. Well, you should be.
those Jews control show business.
just lay it down exactly like Bobby does.
good evening. We're Bobby Shad and the Bad Men.
l'm Dewey Cox.
Bobby Shad couldn't be here tonight so l'm gonna do his show for you.
and l hope you enjoy it.
this first song we're fitting to do is...
well, it's about...
lt's about when your woman catches you.
you know, she catches you running around town...
...getting into all kinds of strange.
this is racially insensitive.
and she says, " Son, get your lazy, twotiming, Negro ass up out of here. "
and you say to her:
what's he doing? You see that?
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love, love. ls he playing " Negro Man " ?
he is playing " Negro Man " .
he's playing " Negro Man " .
from early in the morning till late at night
you know I love your apples Let me take a bite
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love, love, love, love, love
your Negro man
Yeah, come on, Dewey.
I know I treat you wrong And that ain't right
let me put it on you, mama. And you'll feel all right
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love your Negro man
you got to love, love, love, love, love
your Negro man
now, that's what l call winning over an audience.
go, Dewey, go.
l like what you did out there tonight. Have you ever made a recording?
Oh, Mr. L'Chaim, Mr. Mazeltov, that's been my dream.
he's not the one you want. l'm the one you want.
l think he's the one we want. He's got a nice thing.
he's not bad with the singing and the playing and the shaking of the tochis.
l think you've got what it takes to make it in the big time.
the big time?
when the moon hits your eye Like a big pizza pie
that's amore
when the world seems to shine
what the hell is this?
pizza pie. What's in a pizza pie?
bells will ring tingalingaling, tingalingaling
and you'll sing " Vita bella "
hearts will play Tippytippytay
please, l can't anymore.
that's what l was gonna say.
that's amore. Amore
that is amore
all right. Hold, please. Stop that. Stop your singing!
stop your singing this instant, young man!
l will not have this in my studio!
that's just a terrible, terrible...
...terrible, terrible " That's Amore. "
maybe it was a wrong song choice?
lf you just let me play one of my songs, l think you'll like it a whole lot better.
you have failed conclusively. lt's over.
and there is nothing that you can do...
...Here in this room that can turn that around.
nothing you can do that can make up for what you did to " That's Amore. "
well, my mother liked it a whole lot. Your mother was wrong.
l was willing to open my mind...
...because these Jewish gentlemen brought you in here.
they usually have good taste.
and now here you are in front of me pretending you can sing.
and l have to say that today...
...your performance has shaken my belief in the Jewish people.
well, there's nothing l would like more, sir...
...than to restore your faith in Judaism, if you could just give me that shot.
but l'll tell you, you have failed so far...
...and if somehow you are able to sing a song now...
...bringing these boys together you haven't even met...
...and make something so personal, so new...
...that the whole world takes notice...
...and that your life is never the same again...
but l'm telling you right now, l don't think it's going to happen.
wait, wait, wait. We're here already.
what could it possibly hurt?
L'Chaim, l'll do it for you. But just one more song.
all right.
all right, son. l'm gonna give you 15 more seconds.
thank you, sir. l hope you won't regret it.
Dewey, we don't know this song.
you just follow me.
l don't know.
walk hard
hard
walk hard?
down life's rocky road
walk bold
hard
that's my creed
my code
I been scorned and slandered. And ridiculed too
had to struggle every day. My whole life through
seen my share of the worst. That the world can give
but I still got a dream. And a burnin' rage to live
walk hard
hard
here is America's new hit song " Walk Hard " ...
...recorded just 35 minutes ago by Dewey Cox.
hard
though they say
you're not the one
even if you've been told Time and time again
that you're always gonna lose And never gonna win
you gotta keep that vision In your mind's eye
when you're standin' on top Of a mountain high
he walks so hard.
how do l walk, boys?
hard
when I meet my maker On my dying day
I'm gonna look him in the eye And by God, I'll say
I gave my word And my word was good
I took it in the face And I walked as hard as I could
Oh, hey, Shorty. Hello, my darling.
l sang a song at a circus in New Jersey.
they said, " We'll give you 5 grand. "
l said, " No, you won't. You'll give me that giraffe. "
and they did. They gave it right to me.
that is one beautiful giraffe.
thank you.
lt'll just be a few weeks, Edith.
who's gonna help me take care of the children?
Dewey, you have got to give up this dream.
you're never gonna make it. Give it up, Dewey.
what are you talking about? l got a number one hit on the radio.
l'm playing my music for people who wanna hear me.
lt's everything we always wanted, Edith.
l never get to see you anymore. Your kids never get to see you.
l don't know how to tell you this.
l'm gonna miss some things, okay?
l'm gonna miss some birthdays and some christenings.
l'm gonna miss some births, period.
unrealistic to think l'm gonna be here every time you have a baby.
but aren't you happy? You have a beautiful new home.
all your fancy new clothes and your monkey and your giraffe.
look, what else you need?
how about l get you a crow that could talk?
and l'll teach him phrases that l say. " Good morning, honey. "
but it'll be a little crow talking.
this ain't about no exotic pets!
lt's about love, you stupid piece of shit.
Dewey. Edith!
don't you go in the bathroom.
Edith, please.
mama said there's a lot of evil on the road.
temptations.
they'll make a man do evil things.
Edith, that is ridiculous. ls that what this is all about?
there ain't no evil out there.
come on, now, cupcake, open the door.
Edith.
my beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel.
you know how much l love you.
you and this fastgrowing family of ours...
...is the only thing that matters to me.
you understand that?
heck, life without you would be like no life at all.
like no life at all.
Where's a pencil? Where's a pencil?
Dewey!
Hello, baby!
Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speaking.
Oh, you sweet thing.
do l what?
will l what?
Oh, baby, you know what l like.
Chantilly lace and a pretty face And a ponytail
how are we supposed to follow that?
don't worry, Dewey, you'll do great.
Thanks, Buddy Holly.
lf you don't, l'll pick it back up.
you got nothing to worry about. Oh, thank you.
l really like that " Walk Hard " song.
Oh, thanks.
l like that " Peggy Sue " song.
lt's my favorite Buddy Holly song.
Thanks, Dewey. l'm awful proud of that one.
man, l'm awful nervous, Buddy Holly.
Dewey, you'll be fine, or my name's not Buddy Holly.
change of plans. Elvis wants to get out of here early. He's hungry.
we'll change the order.
after the Big Bopper, it's Buddy Holly...
...then Elvis Presley, and then you, Dewey Cox.
so it's the Big Bopper...
...and then Buddy Holly...
...and then Elvis Presley, and then me?
Yeah. Just for tonight.
well, l'm just happy to be here.
what am l doing?
l ain't good enough to follow Elvis.
what are you talking about, Dewey?
Nate. Nate, is that you?
you can do it, Dewey. l know you can.
l know because l'm your brother, and l believe in you.
but, hell, ain't nobody can follow Elvis.
wait, did you say Elvis? Yeah.
Elvis Presley? The King of Rock 'n' Roll?
Yeah, Elvis Presley.
he has nine number one hits.
Nate, l understand that.
he has 50 million fans.
l'm aware of that, Nate. That's why l'm out here.
l'm having a crisis.
holy shit.
Dewey! The big fella's on his final encore.
are you ready?
Yeah. l'm ready.
Elvis!
ladies.
dang, Elvis Presley, you didn't have to rile them up like that.
what, now?
no, l'm... Excuse me, what?
l'm just saying, we gotta follow that and
well, sometimes you have to go all out when you're the King.
because there's only one man who's the King.
God picks him, handplucks him.
one night, God looked down at all the millions and millions of people, man...
...and he decided which one was the best, and it was me.
he plucked me from all those millions and millions of people, man.
Yeah. Listen to this, right now.
there's two things you need to know. l'm the King. And number two is:
look out, man! Look at that coming at you. You see that?
lt's called karate and only two kinds of people know it.
the Chinese and the King.
and one of them is me.
you're the King.
on to Memphis, they want a nice little honey and a little bit of June bug.
yeah? Yeah...
come on, man...
look out, man!
well, thanks, Elvis.
let's go. Come on, mama.
what the fuck was he talking about?
how y'all doing? My name's Dewey Cox.
and, well, looks like l got some proving myself to do.
Sam.
walk hard
hard
down life's rocky road
wow, great playing, boys.
the fillies love you, Dewey.
lf l wasn't married with a good head on my shoulders l don't know what l'd do.
you gotta get back out there. They are going crazy.
let me splash some water on my face.
okay. Hurry up!
golly, that rock 'n' roll.
get out of here, Dewey. What are y'all doing in here?
we're smoking reefer, and you don't want no part of this shit.
you're smoking reefers?
of course we are. Can't you smell it?
no, Sam, l can't.
come on, Dewey, join the party.
no, Dewey, you don't want this. Get out of here!
l don't want no hangover. l can't get no hangover.
lt doesn't give you a hangover.
will l get addicted to it or something?
lt's not habit-forming.
Oh, okay, well...
l don't know. l don't wanna overdose on it.
you can't overdose on it.
lt's not gonna make me wanna have sex, is it?
lt makes sex even better.
sounds kind of expensive.
lt's the cheapest drug there is.
you don't want it.
l think l kind of want it.
okay, but just this once. Come on in.
what do l do? Like this.
Oh, my.
Hey, listen, folks. l'd like to play a song l wrote for a very special lady.
l'm talking about Mrs. Dewey Cox.
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I have a perfect life
you are the perfect wife
I don't know why
I sit and cry
and now I miss you so
please don't let me go
I make mistakes and that is true
at least I learn each time I do
here, have some of this.
darling, you must believe
I could never leave you If I tried
a life without you
is no life at all
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Beth Anne.

Thanks, Dewey.
tears fall in vain
I'm standing in the rain
no matter how I feel
I never seem to know what's real
so sharpen up your knives
can l get that for you? Thanks, Dewey.
l'm a bad horse.
Phil, can l get that for you?
Thanks, Dewey.
darling, you must believe
I could never leave you If I tried
Phil? What happened?
a life without you
is no life at all
well, the tour's going real great, baby.
Yeah, we're having a real nice time.
Yeah, the boys have been playing great...
...and the audiences have been just wonderful, so...
when you coming home? Soon, baby, real soon.
we gotta hit the major markets in the Northeast
Chicago, Detroit
Dewey, could you shut up? l'm trying to have sex with these women down here.
who's that?
Oh, that's Sam.
he's just looking for his drumsticks. Howdy.
excuse me.
anyway, you don't wanna hear about this boring stuff. How was your day?
Oh, you know, just taking care of the kids.
went down to Wilson's Market the other day to pick up some milk.
completely out of milk.
I had to go down to Peach Street.
I hate going down there. Oh, brother. Can you believe it?
Yes, Bert? Hey, Dewey.
you want a cup of coffee? No, thank you.
will you give me a minute? l'm on the phone here.
who's that? That's Bert, my roadie.
just wants to know if l want any coffee or anything like that.
Dewey, there's a distance growing between us, l feel and l don't like it.
Oh, now, that is crazy talk, Edith.
you know l'm just the same old Dewey.
Hey, Dewey. Yes, Bert?
you seen my sandals?
I don't know. I'm talking to my wife, Bert.
baby, there's somebody at the door. l gotta go.
can I call when I get to New Jersey?
okay. Bye, Dewey.
I love you. All right.
I love you. l love you.
you're never gonna make it, okay? Okay, bye.
Bye.
pa. Dewey.
what are you doing here?
lt's about your mama.
ma? What about her? ls she okay?
we better step out into the hall.
what happened? l'll tell you what happened.
we were readying for bed when your song comes on the radio.
lt's Dewey!
your son is talented. You should be proud.
well, l must admit, it is kind of catchy.
dance with me, Pa.
lt does make you kind of wanna move, doesn't it?
lt sure does.
maybe l have been kind of hard on little Dewey.
maybe you have.
be careful, Ma.
you all right, Ma? l'm all right.
the vertigo, it won in the end.
she lost her balance...
...and fell out the window...
...and then the radio crushed her head?
while she was dancing to your song.
l thought you should know what your music does.
lt kills people.
you made her happy and it killed her.
lf Nate was alive, this never would have happened.
wrong kid died.
damn you, God!
how could you let my mama fall out a window?
and then let a radio hit her on the head?
get out of here, Dewey. What are y'all doing in here?
lt's called cocaine, and you don't want no part of this shit.
cocaine?
what's it do?
lt turns all your bad feelings into good feelings.
lt's a nightmare.
l'm thinking maybe l'd like to try me some of that cocaine.
when I meet my maker On my dying day
look him in the eye And by God I'll say
I gave my word And my word was good
I took it in the face And I walked as hard as I could
walk hard Walk hard, hard, hard
walk hard, hard, hard Walk...
all right, again. Faster.
this is crazy, Dewey. Ain't nobody gonna wanna listen to music like this.
standing there playing as fast as you can...
...singing like some sort of punk.
don't you dare try to stifle me.
whose band is this anyway, you cocksucker!
l'll punch you in the mouth!
Oh, God. l'm sorry, Dave.
no, l didn't mean that.
just with my mama dying and all, l'm just all twisted up inside.
Mr. Cox?
l heard you were looking for a new backup singer.
for your new duet.
you heard right.
l was wondering if you might like to give me a try.
l reckon l might.
l've been singing in my church choir since l was a girl.
l like the sound of that.
Darlene Madison.
Dewey Cox.
Hello, Darlene.
Hello, Mr. Cox.
you ready to sing one?
l'm always ready.
well, all right.
in my dreams you're blowin' me
some kisses
that's one of my favorite things To do
you and I could go down
in history
that's what I'm prayin' to do with you
let's duet
in ways that make us feel good
let's duet
and make that sacred sound
Dewey Cox! l am not that kind of woman.
all right. Well...
...that doesn't mean that we still can't be friends.
okay.
well, then, here's to us being great friends.
l can't! We're friends!
I'm gonna beat off
all my demons
that's what lovin' Jesus' all about
lookin' in your eyes I start believin'
let's bring this whisper to a shout
let's duet
in ways that make us feel good
put two and two together
perfect harmony we've found
we know it's only natural
let's duet
I just wanna make out
what you're sayin'
read my lips It's what you're lookin' for
here I am sneakin' up behind you
you can always come in My back door
let's duet
Darlene, these last three weeks have been so...
...full and wonderful.
we've shared so many activities together as good friends.
lt's like you understand me the way nobody else ever has.
l mean, if l
what is it, Dewey? l don't know.
lt's nothing. l'm fine.
nothing? You look like you seen a ghost.
l got a lot of pain in me, Darlene.
you should know that.
where does all that pain come from, Dewey?
did you ever have something that you really loved that you accidentally...
...killed, or hurt in some way, with a machete?
no. No, me neither.
wouldn't that be terrible?
how would you live?
l know, right? Exactly.
darling Darlene
darling Darlene
I'm in love with you I'm havin' fun with you
I'm in love with you I'm on the run with you
I'm in love with you And I'll be one with you one day
thanks for letting me sleep in your bunk, Dewey.
gotta sleep somewhere, right?
Dewey, l can't. l know. l know.
we both know that the sexual tension between us is palpable.
don't you know that l wrestle with the same temptations you do?
l know l shouldn't be saying this to you, Dewey...
...because we're not married and we're just friends...
...but sometimes l lie awake at night aching for a man's touch.
and by " a man's touch, " l mean a penis in my vagina.
lt's just so silly.
Oh, that's so silly.
well, we better get some sleep. Okay.
take my hand, Dewey.
let's promise to never, ever give in to our lesser desires.
after all, we're not married.
l'm ready for sex.
l been waiting for this for so long.
me too.
from the moment l laid eyes on you.
Oh, my.
Dewey, l'm nervous.
don't worry, angel. l'll show you the ways of love.
whoops a daisy.
Oh, Dewey.
surprise!
Edith!
who are you? l'm his wife, that's who l am.
no, you're not. l'm his
good Lord, you're already married? l can explain.
explain to her? You should explain to me l am the mother of your children.
lt's not what it looks like. Children?
lt's not what it looks like.
not what it looks like to me, or not what it looks like to her?
lt's gotta be the way it looks like to at least one of us.
we're married.
l did the right thing. lt's not like we're not married.
lf you're married, you can't get married again.
l know, l know, and that was wrong, but it's just...
we were such good friends.
you told me about that dream where you were licking my balls...
...and that seemed like a signal, and...
l forgot.
l'm leaving you, Dewey Cox, and l will see you in court!
no, Edith! Don't go!
Oh, well. She's gone now.
l'm leaving too. You got the order of things all backwards.
Darlene, don't go!
Edith, don't go either!
l made a mistake. l made a terrible mistake.
Edith! Edith! Edith!
leave me alone, Dewey. l never meant no harm to you.
Edith. Cupcake.
baby, you don't know what it's like out there on the road lt's lonely out there.
Edith, l can't be alone.
maybe you should've thought of that before you got double married.
ls that what this is about?
don't you stand there and judge me like l'm some kind of criminal.
you are a criminal. This is illegal, Dewey.
what do you mean?
lt's illegal to be married to two people at the same time, Dewey.
what about if you're famous? ls that?
you never done nothing you shouldn't have done?
what have l ever done?
you woke up in the middle of the night and drank the milk.
l got up to have my cornflakes, there's none left.
Dewey, you cheated on me!
so l'm a cheater, but you can just drink up all the milk.
okay. All right, that's fine, l get it.
you're innocent, and l'm guilty.
guilty as charged.
guilty as charged
don't you dare write a song right now, Dewey!
you know what? Go ahead. Take the children. l don't care.
all l need is my music.
l don't need you.
and l don't need you.
and l don't need you.
and l don't need you.
you're just sitting there all high and mighty in your diaper.
lf anything, you need me. You're a baby.
come on, Miles.
don't you dare take Miles.
you can take the children, but you leave me my monkey.
fine.
goodbye, Dewey Cox.
No! No, come back.
don't leave me, Edith.
don't leave me, Edith. " There's a title for a song.
that's not a bad title, but please don't leave me.
what have you done?
l'm telling you, l've had it. l've had it with all this crap.
you took her side every time.
all you care about is fruit and touching yourself. Well, fuck you.
get out of here. You don't want no part of this.
what y'all doing in here?
we doing pills, uppers and downers.
they're the logical next step for you.
l want some of that shit.
good morning, Your Honor. May l approach the bench?
I don't give a damn What anyone thinks
I stay up all night And I smoke and I drink
I'm a wanted man And I'm blowin' town
don't waste your time Tryin' to hunt me down
the cops are sayin' I belong behind bars
and I'm guilty
guilty
I'm guilty as charged
does Dewey seem unhappy to you?
he's changed, l tell you, he's changed.
that was early Dewey, this is middle Dewey.
Dewey, are you enjoying yourself?
what? Oh, l'm sorry. l forgot you were here.
Hey, Dave. l like your girl better, let's switch.
well, Dewey, this is my wife. Oh, nice to meet you.
well, this is Kathy. Kathy, this is Dave.

Hey, Jerry, l'm a long time listener and a first time caller.
Yeah, l just wanted to say l love the show, keep it up.

then I'm guilty
goddamn it, this is a dark fucking period!
Oh, I'm guilty
Freeze! Hands above your head.
lt's not what it looks like.
I'm guilty as charged
stop!
you got me.
come on, Mr. Cox. How about it? Look here.
I'm guilty as charged
Cox, you got a visitor.
prison has changed me.
l understand the common man in a way l never did before.
l gotta get out of here so l can bring joy to the men back in here.
but l don't wanna live with them.
lean closer.
l'm going to speak to you in my language...
...so that the guards can't understand what l'm saying.
there must be something you can do.
l'm 21 years old.
l got my whole life ahead of me...
we think we can get you off.
what do l have to do?
you gotta go to rehab.
"rehab " ? rehab.
rehab? Oh, rehab. Okay, okay, l gotcha.
doctor! Doctor!
l'm so cold. We need more blankets.
we need more blankets.
doctor!
l'm so hot! l think he has too many blankets.
fewer blankets!
l'm hot and cold at the same time!
he needs more blankets and he needs less blankets.
l'm afraid you're right.
Dewey?
my wife sends her love...
...asshole.
Dewey, tall and powerful
Dewey, l don't know if you can hear me in there...
...but the wrong kid died.
Dewey. Do you mind if we get stoned in here?
he can't hear you. He's gonna die anyway.
are you ready to go home, Dewey Cox?
Darlene.
l could never get you out of my head.
me neither.
l could never stop thinking about you.
but l wasn't gonna be no home wrecker.
now that l'm your only wife though it seems different.
l'm a new man, Darlene. Prison and rehab have changed me.
all these blankets have saved my life.
l think you're finally ready to be the man l always thought you could be.
let me get this off.
l love you.
l love you too.
Oh, my God.
Oh, don't stop.
don't stop. Don't stop, Dewey.
Oh, God.
Oh, yes!
Hey, boys, have you seen Dewey?
l think l saw him in the barn with Wavy Gravy l saw him by the creek talking to Donovan.
no, l think he was painting a portrait with Joni Mitchell.
Jerry Garcia, brother, have you seen Dewey?
l think l saw him in the study, Sister Darlene.
Thanks, Jerry Garcia.
Hey! Casey, Jones, watch your speed.
come on, Dewey. lt's almost time for Dewman's cake.
all right. lt's just lt's hard for me to sit around at some birthday party...
...when l know there's so much injustice going on in this world.
l know. My daddy was right.
l can't spend all my time thinking about Dewey Cox no more.
l've got to think about the other people.
like your family?
no, l mean, like, people that's having injustices done to them.
like women and midgets and such.
l mean, it's 1 966, Darlene. And, baby...
...l'm feeling it.
l know. The '60s are an important and exciting time.
aren't they? lt's like there's something happening here.
and what it is ain't exactly obvious.
l have to try to help people with my music.
some people are saying that your new music sounds a lot like Bob Dylan.
well, maybe Bob Dylan sounds a lot like me.
how come nobody ever asks Bob Dylan:
'why you sound so much like Dewey Cox? "

Oh, say can you see 'em?
stuffed cabbage is the darling Of the Laundromat
the mouse with the overbite explained How the rabbits were ensnared
what the hell is this song about?
l have no idea.
you guys are idiots. This song is very deep.

Mr. Cox, why are you going to lndia?
well, l'm searching for something, if you must know.
l'm fixing to do some meditating with the maharishi.
and Dewey Cox needs lndia right now...
...and, heck, l reckon lndia needs Dewey Cox too.
only through meditation can we begin to understand our role.
we're nothing but grains of sand.
that was freaking transcendental, Paul McCartney.
don't you agree, John Lennon?
Yes, Dewey Cox.
with meditation there's no limit to what we can imagine.
what do you think, George Harrison?
l don't know l'm just trying to get some more songs on the album, you know.
and as Ringo Starr, l'm not so interested in meditation.
l just like to have fun.
l like the little one. lt's so dark in this tent.
reminds me when we, the Beatles, the four Beatles, us
from Liverpool. Yes, we are from Liverpool.
we used to play those dark clubs in Hamburg
remember that, Paul?
of course l do, l booked them l'm the leader of the Beatles.
well, l have to say l like your stuff. lt's pretty good.
and most of your records, l really enjoy.
we're big fans of your records too.
we like to think that Hard Day's Night is our Guilty as Charged.
great record. Excellent album.
we learned a lot from you. Great record.
we're big fans of y'all. Huge fans.
you're almost as good as the Monkees. You guys are great.
l think l might adjourn to another dimension, take some LSD.
do you care to join me? Yeah, let's do that.
care to join us for some LSD?
lt's good for you.
built by scientists, it is. Lysergic.
gotta check with headquarters.
come on, Dewey Cox. Think you might enjoy it.
open your mind to a new experience, a new level of consciousness...
...like we do, because we are the Beatles.
let him decide. lf he wants to take LSD, he'll take it.
he doesn't have to listen to you. You're not the boss of him.
don't tell me what to say and what not to say
paul McCartney.
l'm sick of you being so dark when l'm so impish and whimsical l'm sick of it.
Hey, everyone, l've got a brandnew mantra:
Paul's a big fat cunt.
don't know why you don't let me write more songs.
you know, l just sit here while me guitar quietly whimpers, you know.
you are the quiet one, so why don't you shut the fuck up?
l've got a song about an octopus.
jam it up your ass.
you're lucky we still let you play drums.
wow, seems like there's a rift happening between the Beatles.
l wonder if your songs will still be shit when l'm 64.
great sod. No, stop it!
you bastard! You sissy.
Beatles. Please stop fighting here in lndia.
no, no, let them go. Let them work it out.
taste it.
right there in the bollocks.
bastard! Cunt!
Dewey, you been living clean for three years now...
...and it's done you a world of good, has it not?
l know l've had trouble with drugs in the past.
but l'm addicted to coke, weed, booze ludes and speed. Not LSD.
nobody gets addicted to LSD.
lt was invented by scientists.
ringo Starr just told me.
l heard that doing LSD can awaken your demons.
l ain't got no demons gonna get woke.
lf you promise it'll just be this one time.
okay.
let's go drop acid with the Beatles.
Hello, Dewey.
welcome to your LSD trip.
where everything's a cartoon.
we're the trippy cartoon Beatles.
look at that. lt's a flying fish.
totally trippy!
wow, this LSD's all right.
l like being a trippy cartoon.
just keep thinking happy thoughts, Dewey.
l'd hate for this to turn into a bad trip.
what's that scary music?
l had an unhappy thought.
lt's a bad trip.
bad trip, bad trip!
help! Trippy machete!
Oh, fuck me. l can see my large colon.
l guess l do have some demons.
you all right, Cox?
l don't know.
do you want some more LSD?
Yeah. l think l do.
eight months later
Mr. Schwartzberg, you're his longtime manager
maybe you can talk to him.
well, what's the problem?
he's been on that trampoline for four days.
you have got to talk some sense into him, l'm worried.
Dewey, as your manager, l have to tell you l'm concerned.
l think the LSD has changed you.
lt has changed me. lt's opened my mind right up.
l'm reinventing music.
l'm creating something new that l call " shmusic. "
you've recorded the same song for months
you're not close to finished.
because this record is different than any other l've made.
l told you. This is going to be my masterpiece.
the one l'm remembered by. lt's for my brother.
what brother?
nothing. Never mind. lt's private.
l've got this sound in my head and it's trying to get out.
l can't find it on this human plane of existence. l've got to keep searching.
but l'll tell you what, l'm gonna find it.
you guys should make friends. He's a wonderful man.
professor, good morning. All right, everyone. Thank you.
l've just been outside, l had a little bounce.
what we're going to do is run through the entire piece...
...in our minds, silently.
and...
...begin.
as we sit here together on Thanksgiving on our beautiful trampoline...
...l think we should take a moment to think about what it's like to be a turkey.
gobble, gobble, gobble. Gobble, gobble, gobble.
'hi, l'm just a little turkey. "
just cut the damn bird, boy.
Dewey? Can we just enjoy our Thanksgiving dinner?
you think you're so great sitting there all drugged up...
...on your trampoline.
you're the black sheep of this family.
you call yourself a Cox.
until you get right with Jesus...
...you'll never be nothing but a big, black Cox.
nothing l do will ever please you, will it?
we're both Cox, Pa. Both of us are Cox.
l've got 137 musicians waiting on me.
you'll have to excuse me.
Dewey, watch the turkey.
I wasn't dreaming
barely awake
off to the grinder we stroll
this is not a good song.
lt's like five songs on top of each other at the same time.
not even a song. lt's some kind of concerto.
just let him work it out.
masterpieces take time.
do you hear that? That goat's been singing...
...more than l am on this damn song.
well?
that was beautiful, Dewey. lt was perfection.
Yeah, even the goat was perfect.
Yeah, the goat was good
were the strings tangy enough?
Oh, they were tangy. They were very tangy.
unbelievably tangy.
no, guys, the strings were not tangy!
they were salty!
am l crazy?
let's do one more time. Okay, strings, lean into it.
l want it really tangy this time
now, Mike, you're flatting.
bushmen make it sound like you're in the fucking bush, okay?
back off the goat on the second prechorus.
l wanna hear his heart, not his soul.
Sam, go back to that thing you did yesterday on the bridge.
what did l do?
lt sounded like velvet pancakes.
Yeah, right. Okay, everybody, one more time.
what on earth is a velvet pancake?
lt's the LSD. l think it's having an effect on him.
from the top of the overture. Slate it.
"black Sheep, " take 112.
I just close my eyes When I fantasize
much to my surprise I'm only half the size
that I used to be
Byebye, white brother
this black sheep gotta roll, lt's on the beat!
I just open up Like a catacomb
though my heart is half From the half F tone
that tickles.
Byebye, pastures of plenty
I don't know where I will
roam, Black sheep, black sheep
like that, with some urgency.
not, " l'm in the yard. l wanna go outside. "
like, " l'm about to die. " Like that.
the blade has been swung
black sheep, black sheep
all right? Here we go.
push. Push, baby, push.
are we recording this? No.
well, we should be. Get a microphone. Push, baby.
push.
push! Push!
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'
I'm losin' no sleep I'm dyin'
why shouldn't I keep from cryin'?
cryin'
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'
I'm losin' no sleep I'm dyin'
why shouldn't I keep from cry?
lt's still not finished yet.
l'm hearing more aboriginal percussionists.
and l want an army of didgeridoos.
fifty thousand didgeridoos!
folks, can we have a moment with Dewey?
what the hell are these songs about?
you're singing about cutting people in half l'm working something out. lt's called a metaphor.
well, what are you working out?
lt's secret. That's why it's called metaphor.
that's what metaphor means. Secret.
l just don't see why you gotta throw away the recipe.
why don't we just go in there lay down some tracks like we always done?
Yeah, why can't we just walk hard?
what do we need all these people for?
l don't need people around me stifling me.
so if you don't like it, there's the door.
Dewey?
are you saying you don't need us no more?
not unless you can open your mind and learn to play the fucking theremin.
fuck you, Dewey!
Yeah, fuck you, Dewey.
ln 20 years not once have you thrown a woman my way.
you don't think we like cheating on our wives too?
and you never once paid for drugs. Not once!
you pay that chimp more than you pay us.
l had to borrow from the chimp to get a mortgage on my house.
and those stupid Siamese glass cats you get us every year for Christmas.
l don't want any more Siamese glass cats!
the Siamese cat is a symbol of nobility in ancient Egypt.
fuck nobility!
fuck ancient Egypt.
fuck cats!
and you never paid for drugs.
not once.
you slept with my wife.
you slept with me too!
and l've had confused feelings about that for 10 years now!
and you never once paid for drugs.
not once.
you're on your own, Dewey Cox.
we're leaving.
well, l guess this is the end of a chapter in your life
Dewey Cox.
what's happened to you, Dewey Cox?
stay out of this, Darlene!
you're driving away the people who love you most!
l don't need anybody, Darlene.
all l need is my music.
this ain't about your music, Dewey. lt's about the drugs.
honey, l told you l'm gonna quit again.
as soon as the record's done. Whenever that is.
look, you can't rush a masterpiece.
you need to take a break. You need to clean yourself up, otherwise
otherwise what?
otherwise l can't be married to you no more.
l know you don't mean that.
l believe you know that l do.
okay.
okay? Okay.
you'll take a break?
l will take a break.
and you'll quit the drugs?
and l will quit the drugs.
Dewey!
Oh, baby. l've been praying about this day for so long.
what did you just put in your mouth? Gum.
you ain't chewing no gum. Candy?
what did you put in your mouth?
lt's PCP.
Oh, you just said!
l'm going to town!
get out of the road, you jerk!
Hey!
Hey! What's going on?
there he is!
Dewey! Get off that building! lt's inappropriate!
Dewey Cox, you give me no choice.
lt breaks my heart, but l'm leaving you.
l'm Zeus!
no mortal can stop me! l'm Zeus!
rehab? Rehab.
Nate!
Nate?
this is what l'd look like if l'd grown up...
...and perhaps hadn't been murdered, or whatever.
l just came to tell you you need to get your shit together!
l know.
l've fallen again.
listen to yourself. Whining like a little bitch.
lf l was alive right now l'd be the fucking president of the United States.
l'd be on the moon, walking around looking for aliens to kill.
what? You know why Dad liked me better?
because l was better than you.
when l played the piano, l was fucking awesome.
well, you think it's been easy for me?
since you're gone l got no sense of smell.
Oh, you got no sense of smell?
you can't smell anything? You can't smell anything?
l got no sense of having legs, Dewey!
l have no life! l'm dead because somebody...
...l'm not gonna point out names right now...
...decided to murder me with a machete.
Nate. l can't even smell, touch, feel.
l can't even masturbate. You ever try to jerk off with a ghost hand?
nothing!
l'm just trying to say you need to fix this shit.
you need to get out of that bathtub. Start writing songs again.
ls he almost done thinking about his life?
he just reached the '70s.
Schwartzy, l don't know. l don't know. l don't know what's going on with me.
l got the song block.
song block.
l don't need to write any new songs.
l'll just do my old ones. We'll do an oldies tour l'll do " Walk Hard. "
Dewey, " Walk Hard " is over 20 years old.
well, a lot of people like my old songs.
old people like your old songs.
may l make a suggestion?
are you familiar with the Donny & Marie show?
the television show?
l got a call from CBS.
they wanna do the same kind of show with you.
l'm a serious musician.
l'm not some TV personality.
well, why can't you be both?
look at those goofy bastards on Hee Haw.
well, l do love Hee Haw.
television, Dewey. lt's the way into the people's hearts.
all right. You call them back today...
...and you tell Mr. CBS...
...that l will do it if l have total creative control.
Dewey, you can't have any creative control.
okay.
all right, let's just do it then. Fuck it, let's do it.
l'm bored.

Cheryl, you know, you remind me of a 1977 Corvette.
why is that?
because you're a beautiful new model.

you are not going home. You are sleeping in the guestroom.
forever.
because you're the only one who stuck around.
everyone else got sick of it and left...
...but you stuck around, which means you're my friend.
there's a star man waiting in the sky
he'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'd blow our minds
there's a starman waiting in the sky
he's told us not to blow it 'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
he told me
let the children use it Let the children lose it
let all the children boogie
goddamn it!
l mean, what do l have to do to get you on my bone? lnvent fire?
and then huge laugh and we go to commercial. All right, take five.
Hey.
great rehearsal, Dewey. Very funny sketch.
thank you. Have you seen the ratings?
we're getting our ass kicked by The Incredible Hulk.
well, last night's episode was a very special episode.
they revealed that the lncredible Hulk has an evil twin.
and he's not green. He's red.
l know. lt was amazing. Did you see it?
you can't compete with that.
but we do need to do more promotion.
here's what we'll do. We'll introduce people to the new Dewey Cox.
l got a girl here to interview you
she's from the local affiliate in Dallas.
l don't know. l'm not so good on interviews.
Bubbe, it's a puff piece. lt's very puffy.
all you have to do is remind the audience...
...you're not mainlining acid anymore
and the show, it's a lot of fun, right?
you're having fun. Yeah.
lt's on every Thursday night after the local news.
'lt's on every Thursday night after your local news l'm not mainlining acid. "
anymore. Oh, l'm not gonna promise that.
whatever you're comfortable with.
l don't smoke angel dust anymore.
so don't be afraid. Something like that?
why don't you tell us about your new TV program?
Gail, it's a variety show. l do a little bit of everything.
l do some singing, some dancing, chatting with the guests...
...the skits, the monologues, the comedy.
wonderful. Comedy.
lt really is a lot of fun.
we'll have more fun when we come back from this word from our sponsors.
don't go away.
okay, you know what, l gotta tell you, my heart goes out to you.
l know what it's like to be on a piece of shit television program...
...because l'm hosting one right now.
excuse me?
must wanna blow your fucking brains out, l'll bet.
l know l do.
and we're back with Mr. Dewey Cox.
we're talking about the fun he's having on his show.
but right now, let's talk about your lovely wife
Darlene. How's she doing?
Darlene and l separated some years ago, Gail.
Oh, okay. Guess l didn't do my homework.
and to answer your question, l miss her terribly.
well, that's sweet.
why don't we talk about your parents? They've gotta be proud of you.
well, my mom is dead.
and my pa and l don't speak to each other...
...so we're not very close.
we can always cut around this if it gets too pathetic.
tell us about your kids l know you got a whole slew of them.
l'm locked in a custody battle at this time.
custody is being forced upon me, which l don't think is right.
you know, if you don't want the responsibility of children...
...you should be able to walk away...
...and apparently a couple of my Ex-wives don't feel the same. So, yeah.
wherever my kids are they're watching The Dewey Cox Show...
...on Thursday nights at 8: 00, right after the local news.
and l just wanted to say to everyone out there...
...l'm no longer mainlining acid or smoking PCP.
lt's official.
okay. Why don't we lighten it up just a bit here?
you're so busy, Dewey Cox do you have time to stop and smell the roses?
l've got no fucking sense of smell.
all right, l'm done.
come on, folks. Do a little research.
that would've been nice information.
l'm sorry, l must be tired from the show or something.
lt's okay. Yeah, Dewey, it's okay.
no, it's not okay. l should be able to do this.
we're in no rush.
should we get an American lndian woman?
no, that won't help. l mean, it should already be pretty exciting.
there's three of you.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Dewey. Nate?
you were supposed to be double great. What the fuck is this bullshit?
l know. All l'm asking...
...is that you write one masterpiece that is the culmination of your entire life.
how hard is that?
l'm empty, Nate. What do l do?
Dewey, who's the one person in your life who's made you feel like shit?
pa. You need to talk to him, Dewey.
l don't know. You need to hug him.
l have been putting this off my entire life...
...but l think you might be right.
the wrong kid died
Hello, Pa.
what do you want?
l feel like there's some things l need to say to you.
well, go on. Talk.
l've realized that...
...l never really said l was sorry for what happened with Nate.
pa, l've spent my entire life...
...trying to find love with wives...
...and hotel clerks...
...and tollbooth attendants...
...and giraffes and monkeys and trampolines...
...and men who dress like women and men who look like you.
and l realized the only person l've ever really wanted to love me...
...was you, Pa.
Dewey, l don't know what to say.
you don't have to say anything, Pa.
l just wanted to come here and tell you that l loved you...
...and l always have.
l appreciate you finding the courage to say that, Dewey.
but there's only one way to settle this.
machetes. What?
the right kid is gonna die tonight.
you've been practicing!
no, Pa. No!
l been waiting for this for a long time!
you have?
Oh, no.
Oh, my goodness!
l halved myself.
pa! No, Pa!
Dewey, l guess l never realized until this moment...
...just how easy it is to accidentally cut someone in half.
lt is, right?
l'm sorry for blaming you, Dewey.
of course you didn't mean to cut Nate in half.
lt's all so obvious now.
pa.
l should've been a better father to you, Dewey.
l wish l spent more time playing catch with you...
...and less time training my body and mind to kill you in a machete fight.
you be a better father than l was, Dewey.
l'll try, Pa.
lt shouldn't be that hard.
ln case l don't make it
pa! You're gonna make it! lt's the 1970s!
they got all kinds of new procedures that can attach tops to bottoms now!
hang in there! You're gonna be fine!
l reckon you're probably right. Now, go call the doctor...
...and bring me some ice, a lot of ice. Some ice.
and a tourniquet. Don't forget a tourniquet.
all right, ice and a tourniquet? lce and a tourniquet.
and a tourniquet. Don't forget that tourniquet.
and you know those three words you always wanted to hear, Dewey?
well, here they are.
l love...
you love what?
pa, you love what?
what was the third word?
come on, one more word!
No!
l want all you fucking parasites out of my house...
...right now!
l said, everybody out!
well, look at you, you arrogant cocksucker.
how dare you. What happened to you, Dewey?
l don't know what's happened to me, but l know what happened to you.
Patrick Duffy took a beating.
stop it, Dewey, you son of a bitch.
stop it!
Patrick Duffy was only saying what we were all feeling.
you get the hell away from me
Cheryl Cox Tiegs!
lf you tear that sink off the wall, l'm leaving you.
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
l'm leaving you, Dewey Cox.
No!
dad?
Yes, what is it, son?
l was just wondering if you wanna have a catch.
a catch?
son...
...there is nothing in this world l want more...
...than to have a catch with you.
son, forgive me, this is going to sound strange...
...but what is your name again?
l'm Dewey Junior, but my friends call me " Dewdrop. "
well...
lt's nice to formally meet you, Dewdrop.
so this is catch.
this is what l been missing out on all them years on the road huh?
l like it, it's wonderful
you throw it to me, l throw it back to you.
lt's so simple, and yet so powerful.
boy, you're really terrible at this game.
well, l mean, you never really played with me before.
how am l supposed to learn? A boy needs a dad.
Yes, he does.
well, l reckon we got some lost time to make up you and me.
and all your brothers and sisters. How many of you are there?
twenty-two brothers and sisters. And also 14 half-brothers and half-sisters.
holy shit.
this may take a while.
that's real good.
so beautiful.
are you sure you're one of mine?
go ahead and taste some dirt.
that's good dirt. That's good dirt.
on the surface, Macbeth is about revenge.
but what is the subtext?
a power struggle for the Scottish royal family that's what it is.
l just gave you it. That one's a mulligan.
Yeah.
Hello, Dewey.
Darlene.
lt's Dewina's birthday l brought her a present. lt's a bracelet.
how's Glen Campbell?
he and l split up a long time ago.
Really?
lt's just me these days.
at age 50.
would you care to take a walk with me, Darlene Madison?
l haven't been playing too much music last for years.
l realize now l wasn't much of a father when l was out on the road.
now this is what makes me happy.
not the music, not getting high...
...just my family.
that's all l care about.
and that family is missing one piece, Darlene.
my God, you're as beautiful as the day l met you.
you don't want this dirty old Cox.
Oh, l want it more than ever.
did you wash your hair today?
l sure did. How could you tell?
lt smells terrific.
l smelt it.
you mean...?
l smelt it!
l can smell again!
l smelt it!
l smell you. Smell it.
Oh, you've been driving me wild.
l smelt it! l smelt it!
l smelt it, God!
lt's a miracle!
l smell you, flowers.
l smell you, twig.
l smell horseshit!
lt's horrible!
but l can smell it!
smell that shit, baby!
l smelt it.
anyway, that's when l learned...
...that Quaaludes and waterskiing do not mix.
now, you remember that.
how come you did all of that stuff, Grandpa?
well, Dewey Rahim, l'll tell you.
l was young and stupid then.
l didn't understand a lot of things.
think it had to do with how l was reared as a boy.
but, you know, l got no complaints.
lt's been a beautiful ride.
a beautiful ride?
a beautiful ride.
Dewey, sweetheart, there's someone here to see you.
Mr. Cox.
l'm sorry, have we met?
you worked with my father, Kvetch L'Chaim.
you're Mr. L'Chaim's boy?
dreidel L'Chaim, that's me.
well, it's nice to see you again, Dreidel L'Chaim.
the pleasure's all mine.
listen, Mr. Cox, there's something l want to show you.
I never rock a fella But I rock a Cinderella
while she's sittin' in between A nigga's legs like a cello
must be those pair of doubleDs
that got a nigga sittin' Rockhard in his jeans
time to play Make your mouth into a hole,you
tell me how I feel When I'm rockin' your boat
I wanna make you fuckin' Hard
I'm so wet, I gotta make you
hard
Mr. L'Chaim how could you allow them to do such a thing...
...with my husband's music?
through the roof, we're selling.
lil' Nutzzak
that's the rapper. Sweet kid.
anyway, he's introduced a whole new generation...
...to the magic of Dewey Cox.
you could even play together
cox and Lil' Nutzzak. What a package.
anyway, as if that was not enough...
...they're giving Dewey the Lifetime Achievement Award next month.
the Lifetime Achievement Award?
baby, that's wonderful.
you go on TV, they give you the award you play a song, it's a magical thing.
l can't go on TV and play.
what? Why not? Why, Grandpa?
hell, l'm 71 years old. l don't even know if l can rock no more.
of course you can rock, sweetheart.
of course you can rock, sweetheart.
well, l don't know that l can rock.
and besides that...
...l gave that life up for a reason.
l'm afraid of the temptations, Darlene.
you can do it, Dewey. l know you can.
just go out there and sing your song.
l'm gonna need my band.
my hip.
ladies and gentlemen...
...please welcome Jewel, Lyle Lovett and Jackson Browne.
walk hard
hard
down life's
rocky road Rocky road
walk bold
hard
that's my creed
my code My code
I been scorned and slandered And ridiculed too
had to struggle every day My whole life through
seen my share of the worst This world can give
but I still got a dream And a burnin' rage to live
Hi. Hey there.
hello.
Oh, he is so cute.
what are you doing later, Dewey?
l am returning to the hotel with my family.
good night to you.
he fucked my grandma.
that's awesome.
Ghostface Killah.
walking hard I'm a real hard walker
fast on the trigger And a smooth talker
my guns pop out like a jackinthebox
I'll cut you in half like Dewey Cox
walk hard My skin stays scarred
you can ask God
lots of ladies unsnapped they bras
ask Lyle Lovett I had sex on Mars
that's how we do it When we walk hard
walk hard How do I walk? Hard as a stone
how do I walk? Hard like a bone
walk hard How do I walk? Like a jackhammer tool
how do I walk? Harder than Jewel
tell me how we walk Hard hard, hard, hard
Oh, no. You're adorable.
Sam. What are y'all doing in here?
Dewey, get out of here. You don't want no part of this shit.
what is it?
lt's a medication for erectile dysfunction.
lt gives you a boner.
not to be used if you have a heart condition.
lf boners last for more than four hours call more ladies.
well, that does sound tempting.
but do you know what, Sam?
l really don't want no part of that shit.
did you hear what l said? lt gives you a boner.
hate to let you down, old friend...
...but l don't wanna succumb to the temptations.
my girl My girl
talkin' 'bout my girl, yeah
my girl
the Temptations!
when it's cold outside
I got the month of May
do l still have what it takes?
am l still the man l used to be?
and do l even want to be?
you're still Dewey Cox.
and you're the only man who ever will be.
but is that enough?
lt's more than enough.
Nate. Have l fulfilled my promise to be double great for the both of us?
are you kidding? You've made 44 gold records.
you've been addicted to, and then kicked...
...almost every drug known to man.
you slept with 411 women and three men.
Dewey, you have had an awesome life.
l have, haven't l?
you sure have.
pa. Son, you learned the hard way.
you can't spend all your time thinking about Dewey Cox.
you gotta think about the world and your family.
but then, at the same time...
are you my inner child?
Yeah, Dewey, l'm you. He's us.
you realized you gotta take care of Dewey Cox.
that's a little different than what l was saying.
you're all right.
pa, inner child, Nate, my own reflection.
l've learned that l can't spend all my time thinking about Dewey Cox.
and l've also learned l need to love Dewey Cox.
l can't spend all my time thinking about other people.
l have to focus on myself.
but also not focus on myself and instead focus on other people.
lt's all so clear now.
lt's not about yourself and other people.
mama. lt's about the music.
lt's about the music. lt always has been.
lt always has been.
lt always has been.
who are you? l'm your feminine side.
l've been waiting for you to get in touch with me.
we heard him sing about walking hard...
...and we learned a little something about how we wanted to walk.
what do we think about when we think about Cox?
he's been called the Drifter.
also the Shape Shifter, the Master Chef, the Chameleon.
the Problem Child. The Hard One.
the White lndian. The Giant Midget.
lf Elvis and Buddy Holly are the Cain and Abel of rock 'n' roll...
...and Bruce Springsteen is Zechariah...
...lggy Pop is
Methuselah...
...and, of course, Neil Young is the wise prophet Ezekiel...
...then what does that make Dewey Cox?
well, l don't know what God...
Mr. Cox?
l don't wanna rush him, but he goes on in a minute.
ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor to introduce...
...for the first time onstage in 25 years...
...performing his final masterpiece...
...that will sum up his entire life...
Mr. Cox?
...the one, the only...
l'm ready.
...Mr. Dewey Cox.
thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
you'll forgive me if l'm a bit rusty.
this is the first song l've written in a very long time.
l hope you enjoy it.
now that I have lived
a lifetime's worth of days
finally I see
the folly of my ways
so listen when I sing of
the temptations of this world
fancy cars and needles
whiskey, flesh and pearls
and then in the end
it's family and friends
loving yourself
but not only yourself
it's about the good walk And the hard walk
and the young girls you've made cry
it's about make a little music Every day till you die
it's a beautiful ride
beautiful ride
a beautiful ride
beautiful ride
beautiful
beautiful ride
as I stand on the precipice of death
my perspective is enormous
every leaf, every cloud
I see the hands Which have formed us
and some days all you got
is a nighttime graveyard walk
and you whistle some sweet melody
to the ghosts down at the dock
sing into your hand
lead the marching band
don't you let 'em fade Your colors gray 'Cause when all is said and done
when youth is spent and burned
you'll see that it's all about
music
flowers
babies
sharin' the good times
travelin' not just for business
accepting your mortality
this is finally what I've learned
and then in the end
it's family and friends
loving yourself
but not only yourself
it's about the good walk And the hard walk
and the young girls you've made cry
it's about make a little music Every day till you die
it's a beautiful ride
beautiful ride
beautiful ride
beautiful
beautiful ride
beautiful ride
beautiful ride
beautiful
beautiful ride

Oh, Jesus.

I'd say about 20 feet up!
Hey!
officers down!
Hey!

come on, Dom!
Oh, Jesus.
I can't get this off him by myself, Sarge.

No! No! You're gonna get him out!
you're gonna get him out!
all right.
here we go, Willy.

I can't get you out, Willy.

I'm hurt.
DOM, it's me, Willy.

Yeah, Dom. You take a break.
I'm dying, Willy.
no. No, you're not. Dom, stop this.
don't forget I really tried to save you guys.
I love you, Willy.
I love you, too, Dom.
Dom's gone.
Dom's gone!
I know.
Jimeno, can you still see the light?
can you still see the light?
Yeah.
Yeah!
how far up?
I don't know. Maybe 20 feet up. There's still stuff in the way.
what else do you see?
beams. Plaster. Nothing.
it is with deep sadness and regret that I have to advise you that two hijacked planes have crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center...
...from what remains of the World Trade Center for 9: 00.
one airplane crashed into World Trade Center Two.
about 15 minutes later, an airplane crashed into the second one.
about an hour later, both of them collapsed.
associated Press is reporting that a plane or helicopter crashed at the Pentagon, and the Pentagon is being evacuated.
whether that fire is in the building itself or outside, we have not yet confirmed.
this is a live picture of the Pentagon and an Associated Press reporter says he could see the tail of a large airliner as it plowed into the Pentagon.
and that fire there in Washington continues to burn.
bastards!
...just a few minutes after that, it wasn't very long, you will see, it happened again. The second tower came tumbling down.
that was the first tower collapse that we just saw.
this is the collapse of the second tower.
and so now, as we stand here, both towers...
the tops of both towers are gone.
Allison, let's sit outside.
behind somewhere that plume of smoke that continues to rise over the...
he's probably still at the bus terminal.
what is left of those buildings, we cannot tell you.
we cannot tell you.
Allison. - Jerry.
al, I'm looking at the Tunnel.
there's no one there.
no Port Authorities there.
al, I don't...
I guess they got called in.
can you get someone to drive you?
Allison? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
okay, I'll see you at home in half an hour.
I'll call Mom and Dad.
okay.
we got to pick up Bianca.
both towers came down, trapping thousands and thousands of people inside.
we do not know the numbers yet, but we do know thousands of people work inside those buildings.
that... The buildings are gone.
there are reports that hundreds and hundreds of fire and police and rescue crews are missing or unaccounted for.
officials seem simply stunned by the scale of the losses...
they keep showing the same thing over and over and over.
Jay's there.
they must have called in every company in the city.
he would have been there early.
Yeah, John, too, probably.
he knows those buildings so well.
they've seen something no one has ever seen before.
one man who came by said he had seen this building come down.
it looked as though it was imploding.
this was complete chaos and utter hell that has come to Lower Manhattan.
Oh, my God.
Judy. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look.
they evacuated those buildings. All right?
I'm sure most everybody got out. They're fine.
in the '93 attack, John said everybody got out real quick.
God. In '93, the buildings didn't fall down.
all right, well, I'm going to call everybody and cancel.
a Den Mothers meeting right now sounds pretty dumb, right?
I keep looking for John.
there's so many policemen running around.
maybe I'll see him.
Judy. - Yeah?
Judy...
they're here to tell us they're dead. - No.
no, they're not. They're not.
Hey, Judy. Jay... - No. No.
look, we know he's alive. All right?
they know where he is. They're communicating with him.
he's alive?
Yes. Yeah, we're gonna go down there now and help out.
Oh, thank God. - Yes!
there you go.
thank God. Oh, my God. - There you go.
Oh, that's good.
that's good. - Thank you, God.
PAPD.
officers Jimeno and McLoughlin.
we're trapped near the FE Five vestibule.
will you please work?
I'm so thirsty.
you're not kidding.
my mouth feels like a beach.
how's your pain? - Comes in waves.
every 20, 30 minutes.
every wave, I feel the pain less.
but I'm more numb.
the number I get the more I want to sleep.
what's wrong with sleep?
I wish I could so this pain would go away.
you're bleeding inside, Will.
you sleep, you don't know if you're coming back.
awake, at least you got a shot.
your brain, maybe, keeps you alive.
that's what I think, anyway.
you know that movie, G. I. Jane?
what's-her-name?
Yeah, Demi Moore. - Yeah.
you know the part where the drill sergeant says, "Pain is good. Pain is your friend. If you're feeling pain you're still alive"?
I didn't see the movie.
I keep thinking of that line.
pain is your friend.
it means you're alive.
we'll make it, Will.
just don't go to sleep.
Sarge, I got a fire here!
Sarge!
there's nothing I can do here!
Sarge!
I'm burning! I'm burning!
please God.
Where'd that wind come from all of a sudden, Sarge?
I don't know.
the fire just goes out like that, Sarge?
Why's that?
I don't know.
you're not a big talker, are you?
no.
well, see, you got to talk to me 'cause...
I can't, 'cause my knees are crushed together!
that's why I can't fucking talk!
Oh, God!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
holy shit!
Dom's gun is cooking off!
will!
will! Will, that's it! All the rounds got to be done, Will.
I can't believe this is happening!
not in my whole goddamn life! - Breathe, Will.
come on, breathe.
get your mind right!
Mrs. Jimeno, please hold.
...Pennsylvania. This is where the United Airlines flight,
I believe it is 176...
I'm sorry, I'm correcting... United Airlines 93...
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jimeno, we can't make that kind of assessment yet.
we just... - Is that Allison Jimeno?
we grew up together. Let me talk to her.
al, it's Brian. I just got in.
Hi, Brian. - Allison, listen, they sent Will down on a bus with a bunch of the guys.
so he did go down there? - Yeah.
and did he go in the buildings?
we don't know.
Brian, did he go in the buildings or did he not go in the buildings?
we're trying to find that out.
it's very basic. Did he go in or did he not go in?
Allison, I'll call you as soon as we know.
Bianca? Sweetie, I'm sorry.
Brian, I... Brian, why don't you tell me what's going on?
I'll take Bianca to my place. - No.
I'll keep her here. I wanna... - My parents are there.
they'll take care of her. Okay? She'll be five houses away.
want to go play?
...shards of metal coming past...
Brian?
president Bush was in Florida when the attacks began.
he spoke a short time ago from an Air Force base in Louisiana.
here's some of what the President said.
the resolve of our great nation is being tested.
but make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass this test.
God bless.
we're told the President's plane has flown on, but for security reasons, the government will not say where Mr. Bush is going or for how long.
I don't know if you guys know it yet, but this country's at war.
pastor, I gotta go down there.
where? - New York.
you can't. Only emergency responders are being allowed in.
I've spent my best years with the Marines.
God gave me a gift to be able to help people, to defend our country.
and I feel him calling on me now for this mission.
then find a way to listen, Dave.
I'll leave that to you to determine just how widespread the human loss will be in New York City alone.
america has changed today. This is a dark day in this country.
it's in bold print in future history books about how America was attacked within its continental borders to devastating effect by terrorists in a coordinated assault using hijacked civilian airliners.
Hey, Mom? - Yes, sweetie.
dad knows it's my birthday party Saturday, right?
your birthday, are you crazy? Of course he does.
he's just...
he's still working to help people at the disaster at the Trade Center.
but they keep saying a lot of those people aren't coming back.
I'm not supposed to tell you this, okay?
but he told me that he was gonna take you to the playoffs next month.
the playoffs? Are you serious? - I'm serious.
Yes! The Yankee playoffs? I knew it. I knew he was going to.
mom, you better come here.
stay here, okay?
what's wrong?
dad and Uncle Pat have a deal.
if anything happens to one of them, they go and tell the other family.
are you here to tell me something?
don't come in here, Pat. I mean it. Don't you come into this house.
Donna, he's not.
we don't know. We don't know.
they've declared him as missing, that's all. He's just missing.
I know. I know. I'm with you. Come here.
I know.
we got confirmation. John went in.
Oh, Dad.
it's okay, baby.
it's okay. It's gonna be okay.
Hey. Hey.
will's a tough nut. He's gonna make it.
I know it, honey. - Dad.
I just know it. Come on. - Dad.
dad. - Your mom's out there.
I'll clean you up. - Dad.
what?
how...
how would I tell Bianca her father's dead?
missing means missing, Ma. It doesn't mean dead.
she's very strong. She's gonna be all right.
Jer. - Yeah.
we've got to call a doctor. Give her something fast.
Why? - She could lose it.
what is happening to this world?
...of this horrible and vicious act of terrorism, acts of terrorism.
and our focus now has to be on saving as many lives as possible.
do we know the number of casualties at this point?
I don't think we really want to speculate about that.
the number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear, ultimately.
sounded like a truck bomb.
like in '93.
blasted out the lobby. Pushed everything in here.
concourse must have collapsed.
you never answered, Sarge.
what have we got?
how long does this internal bleeding take?
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
twenty-four hours is the most I've heard of. Maybe 14, 16.
just don't sleep.
so we've been in six, seven hours. What does that mean?
another seven, eight hours from now?
you remember that earthquake? Where was it? Turkey?
Carl: You have very beautiful toes.
did l ever tell you that? Yes, you have.
l'm not even... l'm not even a foot guy.
they're not even webbed. Are you concentrating on the game, or are you just lusting after the feet of your soon-to-be wife?
l'm concentrating.
NElL: Carl, it's Neil. Are you there?
no, we're not.
NElL: Carl. lt's Neil. There's a problem.
NElL: There's a wedding-related problem.
all right, go. Get it.
Hey.
NElL: l hear you whispering about not answering me.
just remember, when this is all over it's just you and me.
NElL: Carl, if you're humping, stop, 'cause l'm coming in.
dude, it's Dupree.
how the hell did Dupree end up on the wrong island?
Dupree was born on the wrong island.
man: Gentlemen, move this out of the way, please! We're coming through.
thank you very much. Right this way, please.
careful with the boxes.
ten minutes ago those were supposed to be out.
Where's Mr. Thompson?
MOLLY: Dad, this is incredible.
we really didn't need all this.
l know. But l did.
there he is.
did other people land on the wrong island?
DUPREE: Guys, l know l'm in the doghouse, but come on.
these islands, Maui, Cowee, Lenowi, very easy to get mixed up.
don't worry, you're here. Don't worry.
l got my head turned around. l'm sorry.
come here, you big lug. All right.
thompson: Thank you.
folks, this is a bittersweet time for me.
a day that Molly's mother, rest her soul, and l used to dream about.
on one hand, l'm inheriting a new son-in-law, but on the other,Daddy's losing his only little girl.
now, when Molly told me that she was gonna marry Carl, l said, " Who? "
and Molly said, " Daddy, he works for you. "
l said, " Honey, l've got 1, 200 employees nationwide. "
but then l started to worry.
maybe he was some young buck trying to push me aside, grab the reins of my company.
and then l met Carl, sitting in cubicle 26.
and l said, " You know, l like my chances. "
so, ladies and gentlemen, will you raise your glass to Molly and Carl, to health and happiness. He's funny.
Cheers.
all: Hear! Hear!
Hey, everybody, listen up.
now, wait. Just wait.
ln honor of your impending nuptials, l want to perform a feat that l've used to mark every special occasion in our lives since at least high school.
ladies and gentlemen, birds and bees, l present to you the Flaming Tornado!
honey, look who's here! Hi!
this is just a safety precaution.
okay. Little room here. Need to focus.
barkeep, your finest Kentucky bourbon, low-grade tequila...
l've got a mai tai.
don't let him start till l get back...lemon slices, a funnel, and an open flame.
Neil: Yeah!Okay. Funnel.
all: Tornado! Tornado!
open flames. Carl will have the honor.
will the groom please light the liquid?
Carl, grab this. Carl, you got... Where...
what are you doing? Do the Tornado.
maybe later. NElL: No!No. What are you doing, man?
no, we'll do it later.
do it now!
man: Carl has to be here. Now!
let Carl come and do it. Dude.
l'm doing the Tornado, bitch!
do that Tornado!
GlRL: Oh, my God!
yo, Tornado Man.
this one is for you, my brother.
nice one.
well, l guess this is where the road ends for you and me.
we had a good run, though, didn't we?
Hey, Dupree, l'm not dying. l'm just getting married.
Yeah, l know. Hey, listen.
l feel bad about, you know, earlier when l was laughing like a hyena when Mr. Thompson was making all those jokes at your expense.
well, they weren't really at my expense.
no, no, no, they were.lt was a shot across your bow. Yeah? You think?
lt wasn't that funny. l mean, it was, but l shouldn't have been laughing, 'cause l'm your best man, and l don't want this guy getting in your head, okay?
cause he's in my head a little bit.
lt just... lt's... l don't know. l don't want you to forget that you're bringing something to the table, too, okay?
you've got that... That Carlness.
that little twinkle in your eye.
and you're giving it to me right now.
that little glint that says they're never gonna beat you.They can't lay a glove on you.
and don't forget that, because you can't put a price tag on it.
end of sermon.
well, thanks, buddy, l appreciate it.
but, you know, l really think he was kidding around.
Yeah. Guy's got a kind of a weird sense of humor.
besides, it's not like l'm gonna be working for him for the rest of my life.
you know, l got plans of my own.
there it is. There's that Carlness.
they can't lay a glove on you, can they?
God, l admire you. l really do.
that's no secret.
Thanks, buddy. Thanks.
Oh, l wanted to give you this.
you know, for being my best man.
you got to be shitting me. lt's a flask!
you like it? l love this.
good. Hey, you know, that reminds me of the groomsmen outfits.
l really like them, but l'm wondering, should mine be a little different since l'm the best man?
what did you have in mind?
just like a little insignia or a patch.
l don't want people to be confused.
l'm talking something understated, like a lightning bolt. Nothing big.
lightning bolt? Something.
could be cool. Yeah. l like it.
although, it is going to be listed in the program that you're the best man.
Really? Uh-huh.
that's pretty good. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That should be enough.
now, is Neil gonna be okay over there?
l'm seeing him, and it looks like the tide's coming up.
Neil's gonna be fine.
Bingo!
MOLLY: Oh, wow! How many thank-you notes do you think we have to write?
well, l counted 1 1 1 .
honey, l'm gonna do half of them.
Oh, come on. Really? No, no, no. Really.
dear whoever gave us this platter, l love it!
finally a platter. Just what l always wanted ever since l was a little boy.
and now you've made my platter dreams come true.
that's perfect. And then you write 55 more just like that, and you're done. Yeah.
MOLLY: Hi, this is CarI:
and this is Molly. Molly.
we can't get to the phone right now. You've reached the Petersons.
so, if you leave a message... Wait for the beep.
...We'll get back to you as soon as we can. All right...
have a beautiful day.
all right, let's do it again. No. That was really cute.
l called you Carl. lt was really funny. Molly, it was cheesy.
no, it wasn't cheesy.
give it to me. lt's totally cheesy.
give me the machine. No! lt's good cheesy!
give me the machine. No!
PACO: lD? Hey, married guy, how you doing?
good morning, Reese.
LD? Top of the morning, Paco.
so, we're back from the honeymoon.
Oh, yeah, we...
we had a great time, sir. lt was just...
lt was really wonderful.
so l took a look at your proposal while you were gone.
the Oaks at Mesa Vista. You like it?
did l like it? l loved it!
lt's perfect for lot 208.
208? lt's huge.
lf l may, Mr. Thompson, it...
Mesa Vista is really more of a smaller, 40-unit eco-community.
not anymore, Carl. You got to think big, you got to think bold.
you're a married man now. You're married to my little girl.
l'm fast-tracking this project. And you, sir, you're the lead designer on it.
excuse me, sir? That's right.
you are the lead designer.
wow, that's... Wow, that's... That's great.
what happened to Harrison?
l had to let him go while you were gone.
l had a little problem with Rancho del Mar.
but, Carl, l believe in you.
you've got it. lt's here and it's here.
release it. Okay. l'll do that, sir.
release it.
Wow! l can't believe it. He made you lead designer.
Yeah. Apparently, he just loved my proposal.
and it's a little bit bigger than l initially planned, but you know, hey, maybe that's a good thing.
so, what does this mean?
well, it means l've got my own office.
which is reaIIy great: Oh, and it's got a view:
a view of trees and some cars. lt's just terrific, and...
living the dream, honey. Living the dream.
MOLLY: Wow, maybe we can ceIebrate a little when you get home tonight from guys' night.
are you trying to seduce me?
Carl: AII right, I'II see you tonight。
Carl: What's up, guys? DUPREE: Carl, you made it!
DUPREE: lntense matches going on. Guys' night, man!
Hey, there he is! Guys' night!
can you feel the fun for the guys' night?
l can just feel it, you know?
shit balls!
what's that?
lt's my alarm. My hour's up. That's it for me.
what, are you kidding me? Bullshit.
where are you going?
l've got to go meet my wife and watch Sisterhood of the TraveIing Ya-Ya Pants.
l don't... How late do you get to stay out? l used to have midnight.
do you get midnight? 'Cause l was late once, and...
l'm a grown man, Neil. l don't have a curfew.
not yet you don't.
but in all seriousness, you got to tell me something, okay?
do l smell like beer? Yeah.
good. Because you know what l don't smell like, then?Cigarettes and weed. That one's free.
Yeah!
the dream continues! Still undefeated!
Yes! Nice.
will you look at this guy? Look at you.
ls this what it looks like to be married?
come here, man. lt's still early on.
to fidelity, commitment, the whole shebang.
Yeah, and l also got a promotion today.
add it to the list. Forever blessed as the dream continues.
how are you doing, buddy?
how am l doing?Good question.
turns out l got fired for taking that week off to go to the wedding.
wait a minute. You got fired?
apparently, l never had authorization.
my boss claims he never received my e-mail.
then l had a little bit of a cash flow situation, so l ended up losing my apartment.
you're not living out of your car?
Carl, l'm not an animal.
Plus, it was a company car. So when l lost the job...
lt's okay. l picked up a ten-speed.
Dave's letting me crash at the bar after hours.
Dupree, you can't sleep in a bar. We're not in our 20s anymore.
sure you can. l got a cot set up in the back.
this is ridiculous.
look, you're gonna come home and you're going to stay with us.
that's sweet of you to say, but l can't impose, and l won't.
Dupree will land on his feet as always.
can l have a toast, please? Thank you.
listen, Dupree, we've got to get rid of the cot.
some of the regulars are starting to complain.
they don't think it's fair that you get to sleep here and they don't.
curley said that, didn't he?
Curley? Curley! What?
what? You got a problem with me sleeping on the cot?
we all have a problem with you sleeping on the cot.
we took a vote. The ayes have it.
Dupree? Live with us? Not live.
just stay for a couple of days until he gets back on his feet.
Molly, he's been sleeping in a bar.
how does that happen? Who knows? lt's Dupree.
l mean, l told you. His mother moved to Florida with that yoga idiot, and all of his friends are married, including myself.
he's got nowhere to go. He's like an orphan.
wait a second.
what's all this?
this is that celebration we were supposed to have about your promotion. Oh, that's right.
l'm sorry, honey.
look, Molly, let me go outside and tell Dupree to bring his bags in...
what? Dupree's here?
okay, look, you're right.
l screwed up. l did this all wrong, and l'm sorry.
l should have called first.
you know what? Maybe l should just give him some money for a motel.
he's your best friend. He's here.
he can stay. That's great, Molly.
look, it's only gonna be for a couple days.
well, a week at the most. Okay.
after that, he's out of here.
keep those candles burning. l'll be right back.
okay.
Hey, Molly.
l want you to know l really, really appreciate this, okay?
Yeah. No. lt's really no problem, Dupree. Thanks.
nice moose. Oh, yeah.
Murphy, say hello to the missus.
Hi, Murphy.
come on in, buddy. Make yourself at home. Great.
l hope the couch is okay 'cause we're working on everything upstairs. Oh, yeah. l'm fine anyplace.
and you know where everything is. Thank you.
great. Thanks.
thank you. And, hey, listen, just to put your minds at ease, this is not a permanent situation. Okay?
l'm hitting the job trail, l'm gonna hit it hard tomorrow.
wheels of change are in motion.
good. Good. That's a good attitude.
despite what my ex-boss said, l'm not unhirable.
those copiers didn't exactly sell themselves.
and frankly, l think we had an inferior product, and l'd tell people that if they asked.
l wasn't going to lie for that son of...
l don't want to get started on him, but...
okay, great. Well, make yourself at home, and Molly and l are...
well, we're going to go upstairs and take care of some stuff.
well, hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen, we're all adults here.
you're newlyweds. Making love's a big part of that.
you're supposed to explore each other. l get it.
come on.
lf this situation's gonna work, we've got to be honest with each other.
now, go on. Enjoy yourselves. l'm not gonna listen.
hump away. Go on, get out of here. Good night.
okay.
good night.
MOLLY: l'm kind of dreading the talk with his parents.
he hasn't really been treating anybody very nicely at...
that's not good. No. Not for us or our couch.
computer skills. Not really.
the Oaks at Mesa Vista.
this is exciting, isn't it?
stunning. Just stunning.
you know, sir, if we're not gonna have any trees, maybe we should consider changing the name.
no. No, no, l love the name.
names are important, Carl.
are you gonna answer that phone?
give me a second.
what do you want? DUPREE: CarI, hey:
real quick, where do you keep the plungers?
a plunger? What do you need a plunger for?
no reason. Just want to stay on top of stuff.
what do you mean " no reason " ? what happened?
no reason. l just want to know where things are in case there's an emergency, which there probably never will be.
l don't have time for this. l'm...
l don't have time for this. l'm at work. l got to go.
you better make some time for it 'cause we got a little bit of a situation.
l didn't want to have to say anything, but...
just stopped.
where were we?
we were talking about names, Carl. How important they are.
would you ever consider letting Molly keep her last name?
l mean, l know it's a strange request coming from a father-in-law, but a man's name is his legacy, and if Molly takes yours, then the Thompson name dies with me.
well, there's lots of Thompsons around, aren't there?
not in a direct line, Carl. No, no, not in a direct line.
well, what about our kids?
children should have the last name of the father, don't you think?
you're having kids?
well, not right now, but eventually.
you know, in certain Asian cultures, Carl, the husband takes the wife's name.
wait a minute. You just said a man's legacy is his name.
all right. What about a hyphen?
a hyphen? Yeah.
l could ask Molly, but l don't think she...
wait a minute. You mean me.
you mean l'm supposed to hyphenate.
well, then you can still use your own name, only you'll be hyphenating it. lt's win-win.
with all due respect, not for me it isn't, sir.
all right, forget it. You're obviously upset about it.
you know what, l'm sorry l even brought it up.
let's keep focused on your project.
come on! Come on! Toshi, what are you doing? You gave him a meatball!
boy: Watch the car!
DUPREE: Throw it, throw it. We got him.
throw it, throw it!
did he touch the plate? He... Oh, here we go.
the game just turned. Yes!
Carl Peterson, third team honorable mention.All-district, 1984. We get Carl.
boy: No, we get him. Hey, what's going on?
there he is. Hey, sweet heart.
time to dust off the old jockstrap.
this kid Dougie's been killing us all afternoon.
we need your arm out there. Let's go.
Dupree, l'd love to, but l can't. l kind of had a rough day.
and l better go in and see Molly.
l like it. Family first. Priorities.
okay, he can't play. We're gonna have to do it ourselves.
now listen, l want you to brush him back here, okay? What's a brushback?
lt's where you throw it really close to him. Scare him a little bit, but don't hit him 'cause he's bigger than you.
but, Mr. Dupree, l don't even play baseball.
l'm in the orchestra, remember?
first of all, call me Dupree 'cause l'm your team-mate.
second of all, so what if you're in the orchestra.
so was Catfish Hunter.
let's go. Let's go. Here we go! Here we go! Hey, batter, batter...
Hi! How was work?
lt was fine.
good fine? Bad fine? Fine, fine.
you wouldn't believe the response l'm getting for my Career Day program.
and l saved a spot for you on the 15th if you're interested.
Yeah, of course.
l'll bring in some blueprints and maybe even some models.
lt'll be fun. TOSHl: No. Get away.
DOUGlE: You hit me! You hit me on purpose! The kids'll really love it.
man: No more fighting. Thank you, that's it!
Hey! Hey! Come on now! Break it up. That's it!
DUPREE: Hola, you've reached Dupree:
if this is in regards to empIoyment, pIease be aware that my CIass Four driver's Iicense has expired, and I am no Ionger wiIIing to work with asbestos: I won't do it:
can you believe that? A little chin music and the whole neighborhood goes crazy.
lt was like... Oh, and for CarI and MoIIy, press two:
Oh, l meant to tell you about that.
l changed the answering machine in case somebody calls about a job.
l'm staying on top of this job thing.
you guys are okay with that, right?
we got to put the job first.
well, Carl, are we okay with that?
Molly. Molly, come on.
nice.
man ON TV: HBO: SimpIy the best:
when did we get HBO? Yeah, you saw that.
l upgraded us, and l'm going to go halfsies on it 'cause l love it also.
you get it upstairs, too.
l think you get the Oxygen channel, too.
what? What are you doing? What?
what do you want? Cinemax?
what do you hear? What do you say?
MOLLY: So, let me get this straight. l mean, he hijacks our answering machine.
"carl and Molly, press two." Okay?
and then he decides, " Hey, l'm sleeping on the couch, " and l'm gonna order HBO. "
l mean, l don't know, Carl. Am l wrong here?
Molly, what do you want me to do, whack the guy?
look, l told Dupree not to change anything without asking, and l gave him a pair of pajamas.
Dupree's gonna get the hang of this.
he's never truly been domesticated. He's like the ape-man of Borneo.
Oh, so we're the lucky ones who get to housebreak him?
no, you know what l mean, honey.
l'm over it.
l finished my thank-you notes today.
do you need help with your half? No, no, no, l...
candlesticks, bread maker, Crock-Pot. l got them covered.
lt's my final offer.
no, l got them covered.
sorry to interrupt. Oh!
damn it, Dupree! What is this? This is an emergency.
l'm sorry. The downstairs crapper, it's on the fritz again.
what do you mean, " lt's on the fritz " ?
l don't know. lt's on the fritz.
please tell me he's joking.
we might need some matches.
does that answer your question?
MOLLY: Oh, God!
Dupree! Oh, my God. l don't...
yo!
Dupree, what you did in our bathroom last night was disgusting.
Molly nearly passed out.
l know, l know.
believe me. l'm never eating Buffalo wings again.
l don't care how much l love them. l'm off them.
lt's weird. l used to have a stomach like a billy goat, but not anymore.
now, l made a little breakfast for... Molly, great.
come here. Morning.
DUPREE: Good morning.
right here. Let me get this chair for you here.
have a seat. Breakfast is served. Yes.
l believe Carl told me you're a fan of the banana pancake and the soy macchiato.
one second.
DUPREE: l want this to be perfect.
did you tell him all this?
here you go.
soy macchiato.
Dupree, you really didn't have to do all this. Yes, l did have to do this.
look, l know l got off on the wrong foot, and l just want you both to know that l really appreciate this.
and l'm grateful.
l don't know what to say, but... Don't say anything.
just accept my apology and enjoy this feast.
l'm off to a very promising job interview which explains my natty attire. Wish me luck. Goodbye.
Carl: Good luck. Go get them, tiger! l will. Thank you.
off like a prom dress.
manager: So, why don't you describe yourself, Mr. Dupree.
l'm a people person. Very personable.
l absolutely insist on enjoying life.
not so task-oriented. l'm not a workhorse.
lf you're looking for a Clydesdale, l'm probably not your man.
like, l don't live to work.
lt's more the other way around. l work to live.
lncidentally, what's your policy on Columbus Day?
Yeah, we work. Really?
the guy discovered the New World.
l'm afraid to even ask about Victory over Japan Day.
Hey, we tried. Right?
thanks a lot. Yeah.
l'm gonna keep my résumé. Excuse me.
you've got to lean into it and commit to it.
that's the way. You get hurt if you're afraid.
and if you time it just right, then you both...
there he goes. Come down. You guys got to get a rhythm going.
come on.
here, watch me. See, l'm just running down the ramp.
lt's actually harder than on a skateboard.
there we go. Speed's your friend. Hold on.
Yeah, come down. Go.
you see how he's timing it? And then he pops it up? Go!
Yes! Go! One more time.
so, what's going on over here?
Carl, check out this badass skate ramp l had Aaron's dad build for us.
Hey, man, l was just telling these guys how we used to tear it up back in the day.
Yep! Pretty good.
Hey, l got an idea.
what do you say we put on a little show for these guys?
throw down some one-wheelers. Make it rain out here.
come on. For a second.
boy 1: Yeah, let's see what you got.
boy 2: Yeah, show us something.
okay, give me a board. Yes! Carl!
step aside, guys.
honey, l need some help.
Carl: Yep, just like back in the day.
DUPREE: Nice!
Carl: Let's show them how we used to do it.
DUPREE: Step aside. Step aside.
well, no one ever said we were gonna live forever.
let's go.
Carl! Carl, what are you doing?
what's it look like he's doing? He's getting ready to rip it up.
relax, Molly. This is only gonna take a second.
boy: Come on, Dupree! Say when.
when! Yeah!
DUPREE: Oh, l'm racked!
Oh, l racked my little Duprees.
when was the last time you were even on a skateboard?
1987. Oh.
for a second there we almost had it back.
Carl: Yeah.
Carl: What is this?
are you kidding me?
are you kidding me?
ls this some kind of a joke?
Carl, Thompson wanted more units.
thought it would work better as a wraparound.
wraparound.
Mesa Vista is not a wraparound.
look, Mr. Thompson. Hey. You see the preliminaries?
Yeah, l did, and it's completely different than my original proposal.
God damn it, Carl. Will you stop fighting this?
people buy homes. Let the government pay for the parks.
that's why we have taxes.
the Oaks at Mesa Vista is a money train.
you wanna be on it?
Yeah, l'm on it.
money train. l'll give you a money train.
DUPREE: Right there! Right there! You gotta throw it now!
NElL: Please, please, please!
no, he didn't go over! No! No! Why?
he didn't make it, man. Carl! Welcome home!
come here, buddy! We got one for you.
DUPREE: Get a beer for him. What are you guys doing?
we're watching the game. Yeah, l can see that.
Hey, guys! Please, shut the hell up for two seconds 'cause it's fourth and inches. Please, just shut up.
you shut up! NElL: lt's fourth and inches!
why don't you watch it in your house?
l can't have friends over on weeknights and you know that.
grow a sac. lt's not my problem, Neil.
take it up with Annie.
time for the lion tamer. Yeah, well, l can't talk to him like this.
what's going on? You all right?
Yeah. l'm fine.
God, l've been watching you lately, man, and you're really putting in the hours, but you got to find some balance.
find a little Carl time. You know what l'm saying? Carl time.
man ON TV: First down, Cougars: Now Washington State:
you're right.
Carl time. Come here.
Molly's got the Back to School thing tonight.
we got the house to ourselves for a while. Let's watch the game.
let your hair down. Let your hair down. l mean...
you think l've been overdoing it with the work thing?
l know you've been overdoing it.
Yeah. Shake it loose, huh? Just live a little, man. Just live a little.
Yeah. You know, maybe l ought to make my nachos.
nice! Yes!
Carl time! NElL: Nachos, Carl nachos are in my belly.
Carl: Hey, Neil, turn up the volume. Okay. Yeah, yeah.
you know who else loves Carl's nachos is Eddie.
give him a call. l already did.
Carl, soup them up, man! Make them spicy!
okay, guys. This is it. This is it.
come on. Just come on. Please. Please, God!
send everybody! Send everybody!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Damn!
DUPREE: No, no. NElL: No, no.
No!
no, no! No! No!
No! Yes!
what did l tell you? That's what l'm saying!
congratulations, idiots. Congratulations, guys. Very good.
fifty pushups, faggot. Fifty pushups.
l'm not giving you any pushups.
that was the deal. Fine. Okay? Enjoy it.
all: One, two... He has a condition.
all: ...three, four. That's right! l have a condition.
l should not keep doing this. Come on!
NElL: l have a gamey colon, and it gets spastic and spasms.
Carl: You don't have a condition.
Carl. Carl! Neil, shut up! Carl. l didn't read that.
mark, what? What is it, Mark?
Hi.
Oh, hey, Molly.
Carl: You're home early. Really?
l just invited some of the guys over to watch a little football.
figured it was just a little time to loosen up. A little Carl time.
me gusta margarita!
HoIa, Dupree.
HoIa, Molly.
all: Charlie. Brilliant.
CHARLlE: Sorry. We should go.
you guys want to go? Yeah, let's get out of here.
that's a good idea. Let's go to Larry's.
let's get out of here. Let it go. Let it go.
CHARLlE: What'd l do with my tie? Let's go.
Bye. Sorry, l ashed on your floor.
great. Take that tie off your head.
l'll bring this back tomorrow. l'll give it to Carl at the office.
so, don't tell Annie l was here. And if you do, don't...
just don't tell her that l asked you not to... Get out, Neil.
out! Okay. l'll just go.
l know what you're thinking, Molly.
but we were gonna have this rug shampooed. l promise you.
Oh, and look. Look at that.
lt's my grandmother's silver cheese platter.
you used it to serve nachos.
well, nachos have cheese in them.
let me just start cleaning up some of... Dupree, please stop.
somebody arriving late for the party. Don't worry about it.
the party... Game's over!
go away! The party's over!
party... Molly, for the love of God! Please!
we heard there were some bad boys in here.
there were, but they left.
you know, Carl, l...
l really think l've been pretty cool about this whole situation, and l hate having this conversation with you.
but this is not exactly how l pictured us getting started.
l know.
look, Dupree's got to go.
no. lt's not about kicking Dupree out.
lt's just that you said it was gonna be a couple of days.
look, Molly. He's my best friend.
somehow l feel responsible for him.
then maybe it's time to start prioritizing your responsibilities.
you're right.
what if he had a girlfriend? Good idea.
but how is a guy with no job, no car, living on somebody's couch gonna find any kind of girlfriend? Our new librarian.
she seems really nice.
you want to fix Dupree up with a really nice librarian?
listen, l know the guy for 25 years.
l think he's more into the young, foreign, non-librarian type.
well, it wouldn't hurt to ask. l wouldn't get my hopes up.
l'll do it.
Oh, that's great. Do you want to know anything about her?
no. Well, does she have a car?
Yeah. She does.
good. See if she can swing by and get me around 8: 00. or quarter to.
tonight? Please.
okay. Candy?
Mandy. Mandy. That's even better.
librarian.
no. No.
l thought you were really brave.
l mean, l have a whole new respect for you, Carl.
well, the rice was okay, but just for the record, octopus does not taste like chicken.
but you ate it.
what is that?
funky CoId Medina?
lt looks like Dupree brought his date home.
honey, what is a tie doing on our door?
Molly, l think we ought to drive around the block a couple times.
wait a minute. No way. Mandy's a Mormon.
she's not the kind of girl... A Mormon?
...who would get busy on the first date.
you fixed Dupree up with a Mormon librarian.
Molly, wait!
Oh, my God. What?
let's drive around the block.
that butter dish was our wedding gift.
guys, guys! Hold it! Let me explain. What was he doing with butter?
Dupree, no need to explain. lt's not what it looks like.
Dupree, no explanation necessary. l know.
go back in the house!
not before l thank Molly for the best night of my life.
mol, Mol. Thank you.
what happened in there, it was so natural. So beautiful.
go back inside. Listen, l've got neighbors. l know you do.
but listen to me. l'm in love.
Dupree. Dupree, l'm not going to do this with you tonight!
Jesus! Molly, call the fire department! Oh, my...
MOLLY: Fire in our house! lt's fire!
Carl: My couch! DUPREE: Roll!
God, l loved this couch.
you know, when l saw you on fire, my heart stopped.
l had so much adrenaline pumping through me, l probably could have...
could have picked up this car and just hurled it 10 blocks.
are you gonna do this, or am l gonna have to?
l'll take care of it. Tonight, Carl.
go on, get out of here.
or l'm not responsible for what these hands are gonna do. Go!
Bye.
you okay? Yeah.
Yeah, just a little smoke inhalation.
Wow. Unbelievable.
Mandy was completely unharmed.
fire chief said that the butter probably saved her life.
you talk about a miracle. You just got to thank the big man.
lt's all you can...
what is wrong with you? Why did you have to use so many candles?
l was just trying to set a mood.
you know how l am, Carl.
Yeah. l do.
look...
lt's about time you got on the road.
you guys need any help? No, we're good. Relax.
DUPREE: Well, l had a lovely stay.
thank you both for your generosity.
sorry about last night, and no hard feelings.
l hope. At least, there are none on my part.
okay. Are you sure you got a place to go? Yeah. l got a place to go.
going to Mandy's.
the librarian?
don't you think that's kind of moving a little quickly, Dupree?
maybe it is, but so what?
something special is happening there. l'm not gonna fight it.
Hey, take care of this big mook for me.
Bye. See you guys.
Toshi, listen.
you got the heart of a damn lion.
l respect you. You took a beating, but you took it like a man.
God bless all of you.
DUPREE: Goodbye!
off to Mandy's!
Oh, my God! Carl.
okay! Sir, are you sure you're okay?
DUPREE: My helmet saved me.
you see that? He's gonna be fine.
here's your bag. Thank you.
Bye!
Bye.
we've been staring at this for over two hours. Let's go get some dinner.
or margaritas. Celebrate our emancipation.
the insurance adjuster recommended that we sue Dupree.
for a moose head?
just curious.
lt was the margarita that did it, wasn't it?
lt was the emancipation that did it.
Carl: l like this song.
Oh, my God. What?
are you kidding me? What the hell is he doing?
MOLLY: l thought he was going to Mandy's.
honey, l don't think he can see us.
maybe we should just keep going.
lt's pouring rain outside.
not that bad. Honey, look at him.
what?
damn it.
Dupree, what are you doing? lt's pouring rain outside.
l don't know what l'm doing anymore.
Yeah, well, what about Mandy? Don't ask.
Carl, can you get his bike?
come on. Let's go. Let's go home.
MOLLY: Carl, honey, bike.
MOLLY: Carl! l'm coming!
l really appreciate this, guys.
trust me, no more open flames. l've learned my lesson.
all right, well, it's been a long night.
so, l'm gonna go to bed.
Dupree, try not to go to sleep with that head wet. Okay?
good night, Molly.
Dupree. l don't mean to come down on you, but you need to start getting your life together.
we're grown-ups now. Yeah.
you know what l mean? l know. l know. You're right.
and if you're going to stay here, things are gonna be different from now on.
no more naked stuff.
well, it felt natural to be naked. l... l don't care!
okay. l do not care.
clean up after yourself, watch the noise, try to help out around the house, please?
lt's not too much to ask.
you're right.
Carl? l can be really helpful when l set my mind to it.
and that's what l'm gonna do.
Oh, and...another thing.
would you mind writing some thank-you notes for me?
okay.
Yeah. That'd be great.
try to get some sleep.
gut-check time, Dupree.
dear Aunt Kathy.
"thank you so much for the wine glasses. "
man ON TV: And this, of course, is the point of the race where speed wiII pIay a major factor, where Iong months of training certainIy pay off:
Hello?
Yeah, Dupree. l'm gonna need you to do me a solid.
Yeah, no problem. What do you got?
l promised Molly l would give this Career Day presentation today at 1: 00.
but her father just dropped a big one on me, so l'm gonna need you to step in and fill in for me.
can you do that?
l don't know, Carl.
l don't know the first thing about the development business.
l really think Mr. Thompson might find me in over my head.
no, not the development business. School, Dupree.
Carl: I'm gonna need you to fiII in for me at MoIIy's schooI:
no, no, no. Not this time.
what? No, no, l'm talking to Lance Armstrong.
Hey, Molly.
Dupree, what are you doing? Carl asked me to fill in.
I guess there was some sort of work conflict.
what? Conflict? What kind of conflict?
I don't know. I don't ask questions.
I just ride to where I'm needed.
but don't worry. I'm sort of a good Public Speaker.
Oh, no, no. It's a Career Day Presentation, DuPree. You don't even have a job.
I understand that. But here's what I'd love you to do.
please get Mandy here. I want her to see this.
I think this will win her back.
now where are these little rug rats?
they're in the third door.
Hey, how are you?
first of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to come talk to you on Career Day.
now, I am not Mr. Carl Peterson and I don't have a career.
I guess you could say my career is living and loving.
and I do that to the utmost.
DUPREE: She coming?
keep going? Okay.
I see all you fresh-faced kidlets, sitting there in your neat little rows, and you're all just Pods.
pods, waiting for your instructions.
now some of you are gonna get zapped right away and be 15-year-old Prodigies, little midget OlymPic gymnasts with their Pictures on cereal boxes.
some of you will go on to college, and you'll find your rhythm there, and then go chase down the titans of industry, or maybe straighten out our problems at the UN.
but some of you, and this is the group that no one ever comes into Career Day and addresses, and it's criminal, some of you are just gonna float along, eating spicy foods, humming black People's music into your 30s.
well into your 30s, languishing.
this group of Pods is gonna do a lot of languishing.And you're gonna take some heat for it.
sadly, you will.
europe's a little easier. They seem to understand a little better.
so does South America.
I went to Argentina one time, and everyone just seemed to be sitting around. It was beautiful.
but that's okay. You stay loose. Stay liquid.
laugh a lot. But be ready.
that's what DuPree's doing with his life's little Pod.
staying nimble. Till I get the call from the mother ship.
my raison d'etat. Then I'd fight.
then you'll see DuPree coming in here throwing seven different kinds of smoke.
that's fine. The Pods that were supposed to hear this did.
it'll kick in when it needs to. I'm done here.
I told you. Now, do you think it went over their head?
no. It was really good. They got it. They got it.
now, where's Mandy? I'm only gonna do this one more time, but we got to get her here!
Dupree, Mandy has to... She had a...
she had a book that was lost.
I'm sorry, DuPree.
Dupree, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Dupree, there's something you need to know about Mandy.
well, it turns out that she's a total slut and is sleeping with half the male faculty.
what? No. I'm sorry.
my Mandy? Yeah.
sorry, DuPree. I would have never set you up with her if I would have known.
ever. TEACHER 1: Okay, kids, back inside.
teacher 1: Let's go. Ever.
with that guy?
afraid so.
he's not even on the faculty.
there really aren't any more Audrey Hepburns out there, are there?
Oh, what a sucker.
Dupree? DuPree?
you talk to Sam about the zoning issues?
Yeah. And to be honest with you, sir, they're still in flux.
Carl, I'm going to the bank in days, all right? I cannot have things in flux.
I realize that, sir. I'll get on it right away.
Carl, sit down, Please. Please just sit down.
you know, there's something you said to me a few days ago that I just cannot get out of my mind.
something about you and Molly having children.
Oh, right. Yeah, no. That was... That was hyPothetical.
that's not something that we're talking about doing any time soon.
you know what I did, Carl, when I started dating again?
no idea. I got a vasectomy.
a vasectomy? --- Yeah.
okay. That's a little extreme, don't you think?
not really. It's a mild outpatient Procedure.
a little local anesthesia, snip snip, sit on a bag of frozen Peas for a night. Voila.
I mean, that was it, and it's one hundred percent effective.
Yeah. And 100% permanent
Carl, read the literature. It is reversible.
seventy Percent of the time. All right. See you get your shit together, all right?
I want it back on my desk, this zoning stuff, by 3: 00 today.
all right? Thank you, Carl.
all right?
woman ON TV: Fine. How are you? "Fine. How are you?
Oh, fine.
man ON TV: Say, you know, you were great back there.
you were so bad yourself.
man ON TV: Guess we'd better get Irving's car and get out of here.
so you really were serious about Audrey Hepburn, huh?
she had it all. Style, grace, ethereal beauty. Just like I thought Mandy did.
I don't know. I have a hard time imagining Audrey Hepburn getting buttered up to Funky Cold Medina.
Really? I don't.
the Mouth of Truth. The legend is that if you're given to lying and you put your hand in there, it will be bitten off.
I'm still trying to understand why Carl didn't show up today.
I know he's under a lot of Pressure right now, but just lately he seems like a different person.
no, he's just working really hard. He gets like that sometimes.
maybe if he opened up a little bit more.
look, Carl's never gonna be mistaken for the great communicator.
I mean, just mention the word "feelings" or "emotion, and you watch his eyes glaze over. But...
I don't know. He just puts up a wall.
well, how do you get past it?
I think you just fight through it. Patience.
that's what I did. I ask a lot of questions.
I let him know that I care.
and I just Pray he drops his guard, 'cause when he does, it's so worth it.
hello.
you beast! It was perfectly awful!
that gets me every time, and I know it's coming.
so, DuPree did a good job?
did he mention the mother ship?
actually, in a weird way, he was really inspiring.
I didn't know he was so sensitive. Did you know he writes Poetry?
poetry? Yeah.
man, what a Homo. Wow.
that is really mature, Carl.
look, honey, I'm sorry I didn't make it today.
what is going on with you lately? Oh, nothing. I'm fine.
you are clearly not fine, Carl. So why don't you meet me halfway here, Please.
all right. You want to know what's going on? I'll tell you what's going on.
I think your father hates me.---- What?
Carl. Carl, my father does not hate you.
he gives you this big Promotion, which you said was a dream come true.
why would he do that? Because he hates you?
that's exactly what I'm beginning to think.
for the same reason he's been systematically trying to emasculate me and sterilize me.
slow down. 'Cause now you're not making any sense.
I'm not making any sense?
well, here's something that should make perfect sense to you.
now, everybody knows that your father, when he likes somebody, he invites them out on a little fishing trip.
fact. I've never been invited fishing. Not once.
you hate fishing. ----- He doesn't know that.
I'm telling you, Molly, he hates me.
look, Carl, I know how my father gets sometimes. I do. He pushes people when he wants results.
and it's frustrating, I know. But he doesn't hate you.
and I know you want to do a great job on this project, but it's taking over your life.
and we're supposed to be having fun.
why don't you come home at a decent hour tomorrow night?
Dupree wants to cook for us.
we'll sit down, we'll have dinner, relax. Talk about things other than work.
and everything will be okay.
Yeah.---- You'll see.
fine.
fine.
Yeah.
Hey.
you busy? No.
just catching up on some back issues.
what's going on?
I wanted to ask you something.
yeah?
would you be offended if ThomPson asked you to get a vasectomy?
what? Why would he want me to get a vasectomy?
Carl, I barely know the man!---- Wait a minute! Wait! DuPree.
Yes, I'd be offended! ----No. Not you.
that's not what I mean. Just what do you think of vasectomies?
cutting off my manood? I think it's barbaric.
no one's getting near that Part of my body. No one, Carl.
unless, of course, it's a woman. And then she better not have a scalpel.
of course.
why would he want me to get a vasectomy?
he doesn't want you to get a vasectomy.
it was a hyPothetical question. ---- Okay.
just forget I asked.
don't joke with me like that, man.
go back to your reading.
watch that heat. Slow stirring, Molly.
how are my game hens doing?
MOLLY: Wow. DUPREE: Gorgeous.
okay, get started on the salad. Put some walnuts in.
I'll take care of this. ---- Okay. How'd you learn all this?
most of it I Picked up in a six-week series, Treasures of Tuscany.
the garlic technique, however, I got from watching Goodfellas.
I actually make an incredible risotto, but I want to keep it low carb tonight for Carl.
poor guy has kind of let the wheels come off a little bit. Okay.
twenty minutes till the big guy gets here.
focus. We got to come together now.
Merlot. I want you to get it out. Get it breathing.
we're gonna use the 2005, NaPa wine glasses Aunt Kathy gave us.
how did you know Aunt Kathy gave us those wine glasses?
DUPREE: He would have written these notes. ---- DuPree, Please!
please stop making excuses for him. ---- I'm not.
but I think that he would have if he... ----No, you are.
and you have to stop doing that now because your buddy is wrong. Okay?
if he didn't want to write them, he should have just told me.
and, big surprise, he's late again.
look, you know, forget him.
you made this beautiful meal. ----Thank you.
we're gonna sit here and we're gonna enjoy it.
we're gonna drink. And we're gonna eat. And we're gonna drink some more.
well, it's frustrating for me, too, 'cause I know he would have loved this meal.
MOLLY: Yeah.
I can't do it...
DUPREE: Oh, boy.
MOLLY: No. But I used to be able to touch it to the top of my nose.
no, really? ---- Yeah. Oh, wow. Can you do it?
no.
Hey, guys.
there's a plate for you in the oven.
okay, look, I'm sorry I'm a little late. I got hung up at work.
would it have killed you to make a Phone call?
no, Randolph, Randolph, wait!
I'm sorry, Molly, but, damn it, Carl, you really press my buttons sometimes!
is he kidding? ----No. Now you've upset Randolph.
Randolph?
Randolph? You got to be kidding me. I know a Randy DuPree.
I do not know a Randolph. ----Did it ever occur to you that maybe he prefers to be called RandolPh?
no, Molly, it never occurred to me.
you know, the guy writes some bullshit Poetry and suddenly he's got a brand-new name.
that's funny. Turns out that's not the only thing he writes. Apparently, he is a whiz at thank-you notes!
he told you about that? ----It just kind of slipped out.
Oh, I bet it just kind of slipped out.
guy stabs his best friend in the back. He's getting drunk with his wife.
what can I say, Carl? I'm kind of fun to get drunk with.
maybe you should try it sometime, because I'm here every night!
Molly, I'd be delighted to try it sometime, but unlike your friend, DuPree, I've got a job!
and what was with the groomsman shirt?
that was a one-time deal, Molly.
he was trying to look nice for you.
and why are you coming down on DuPree?
he's the one who went through all this effort to cook low carb for you. You didn't even bother to show up.
low carb? What the hell does that mean?
you know, he's on the whole health kick with the bicycling and Lance Armstrong.
so he's just trying to help you out. He's trying to help me out?
that's a laugh, Molly.
I'm the one who put a goddamn roof over his head!
one. We put the roof over his head.
and B. I mean, you haven't really been taking care of yourself.
I can't remember the last time you exercised.
and how many Twinkies have you had today?
what are you talking about?
Oh, Carl, Please. There's, like, a million Twinkie wrappers on the floor of your car.
you're not fooling anybody. ----All right. All right.
so I admit it, I enjoy one occasionally. Is there something so wrong with that?
and, Molly, look, I am under a great deal of stress.
what do you want from me?
wait a minute. Is this the kind of thing that turns you on?
Oh, Carl!---- Is this what turns you on?
come on, Molly. I was reading an article on Oprah.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I can't be one of your boy-band flavor of the weeks.
with their enanced frosted tips and their washboard bellies and their hairless backs!
what's happening to us, Carl?
I don't know what's happening to you, Molly, but apparently I'm getting fat!
nice. Looks like somebody's tired of getting sand kicked in their face.
good job. Good to see you living strong, buddy.
please. Would you listen to yourself?
you get your first ten-speed bike, and suddenly you're Lance Armstrong.
let's leave Lance out of this.
guy's done more with one testicle than you and I can do with three.
now, listen. I know you're under a lot of Pressure at work and you and Molly are having some trouble.
trouble? No.
I wasrt having any trouble until you arrived, Randolph.
what's that supposed to mean? ----You know what it means.
no, I don't.
you sold me out with those thank-you notes.
and what's with this Roman Holiday obsession?
I know you, DuPree. Your favorite movie's Fletch.
no, sir. No, it's not. Fletch is in my top five. It's not my favorite.
what's with the Poetry? I think you're trying to show me up.
maybe I like Poetry. Did that ever occur to you?
listen, if I got to be the lovable fuck up all my life to win your best friend Prize, maybe you should keep your award.
I've got news for you, DuPree. You're not that lovable.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that, Carl.
goodbye, Mr. GrumPy.
sugar.
top shelf, behind the honey.
where? ----Top shelf, behind the honey.
Oh, yeah.
DUPREE: You got to reach for it.---- MOLLY: Okay.
Yeah, right there. ----Oh, God.
you gotta reach. Right there.---- I'm reaching.
Oh, goodness.
right there.
there's the sugar. Right behind the honey.
right there. You got it?---- I got it.
why do you do this to me? Got it.
so good.
Bye, honey.
woman: Hello? Hello. Yes. Is Mandy there, Please?
is this Dupree calling again?
Yes, this is DuPree again.
get it through your head. Mandy does not want to talk to you, okay?
okay, yeah, just tell her that I called.
good night. Thank you.
looks like we're going camping again, MurPhy.
Oh, God! ----Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't know you were down here. ----No, it's my fault.
what in the hell is going on? Nothing, honey. It's fine.
nothing. Nothing. ----Are you naked again?
no, no, no, it's fine. ----We talked about this!
I know we did. Yes.
everyone's asleep, and here's lonely old DuPree just waling away on himself. ----You weren't waling away on yourself. It...
God! An animal wouldn't debase himself thus.
what is happening to me? ----Is this one of my tube socks?
Carl, Please.---- Answer the question!
Oh, my God. ----Mine were dirty.
Carl, stop it! Relax.
wait a minute. What are you even doing down here, Molly?
are you serious? ----It's a simple question.
I couldn't sleep.
I'm getting a broom.
this is rock bottom.
I was doing so good.
wasn't I doing good, Carl? Huh, buddy?
but, DuPree, where did you find this?
Oh. I got it from that box marked "Carl's camping equipment" in the garage.
you Put the box away, didn't you? Yes. Yes.
I'm 99% sure I put it away.
I didn't realize you were such an outdoorsman, Carl.
MOLLY: Asian Assault? ----Molly, let me explain.
that one was in the wrong section at the video store.
Oh, you're gonna lie to my face.
I thought it was a kung fu movie with Bruce Lee.
okay. Pacific Rim Job. ----CARL: No idea.
all right. That one I kind of knew about.
Oh, Beijing Bang Bang?
Carl! Is this what our marriage has come to?
lies and all these Chinese fetish videos?
I'm just curious. All right. I admit, Molly, that I was into Asian Porn for a little while.
all right. I admit, Molly, that I was into Asian Porn for a little while.
but it was just a phase.
anyway, why am I the one who's on trial here?
he's in there starching my sock, and you don't even bat an eyelash.
because I'm not married to him! I am married to you.
do something with that.
is there anything worse than having to throw away your Porn collection?
what's going on with you and Molly?
what? ----You heard me.
are you in love with my wife?
have you lost your mind? What are you talking about?
Dupree. DuPree, just answer the question.
whoa, hold on, Jake LaMotta. I'm not gonna...
that's a sick question. ----How come you can't answer it?
I'm not going to answer because it doesn't deserve an answer.
how could you ask me something like that?
you're very clever, DuPree.
you're living in my house.
you're going to town on yourself in my living room.
and now you're moving in on my wife.---- What?
you think you got it all figured out, but I'm on to you, and you're out of here!
Oh, no. Hold on. You're not throwing me out of here.
I'll leave! ----Good! And while you're at it, leave the flask and the groomsmars outfit.
but you gave those to me. Those were gifts.
all right! You know, keep those. All those were gifts.
but leave the insignia. Because that was for my best man.
because that was for my best man.
Hey. It's for the best.
the guy would have been living off us forever.
dinner is at 7: 30, and my father will be here at 7: 00, so...
Molly. With all things considered, do you think that maybe tonight isn't the best night to have your father over for dinner?
Carl. Carl. Please don't be late.
please.
so, I hear the albacore are really biting this time of year.
it's not albacore season, Carl.
Oh. Really?
I'll get that.
it's right over here.
hello.
hold on. Hey. Hey, Carl. Carl. It's Neil.
did you actually throw away your Porn collection?
look, Neil, I'm having a dinner Party.
I'm coming to get it.
going to Starbucks! Be back!
Carl, I read your new presentation.
and how would you feel about Tony taking it from here?
what?
I hope you guys aren't talking business now.
let's keep it at the office.
no, no, no, not at all. No, we were...
Oh, my God. Is that Mom's crab cakes?
they sure are. ----Rabbit, come here.
excuse me. ----Come here, rabbit.
they look exactly like Mom's. I can't believe it.
Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Give it to Tony. Tony. Yeah.
Yeah. Want to give it to Tony?
Yeah, I have a Pretty goddamn big Problem with that.
is that what you're saying? You'd be demoting me?
Tony deserves it! Give it to Tony!
do you think I care? Go ahead.
what are you doing? Son of a...
huh? ----Your father's got it out for me.
Oh, Carl! No, no, no!
Carl: You know he asked me to get a vasectomy?
MOLLY: What?---- He's crazy!
Carl, first of all, this is my father you're talking about!
he's irrational.
who... You want...
what was that? ----Oh, my God.
you. What the hell? ----Oh, my God. DuPree!
what did I tell you? ----Molly, don't.
I'm okay. I just slipped on the drainpipe.
come on. Let's get in the house.
I didn't want to bother you guys.
put him out by the curb! ----Carl.
why am I getting blamed for everything? ----What's going on here, Carl?
daddy, will you Please grab DuPree's things?
I was just trying to get my stuff. ----What?
you know, Molly, I don't know that I really have time for dinner. I might just...
you know, I really don't want to imPose. Here.
maybe I... I know, but I... ----No. You're staying.
you're gonna eat something. It's fine. You're eating.
here, have some salad. It's good.
I put a little extra balsamic like you like it.
Thanks. Thanks.
eat something.
well, it does look tasty. Thank you.
DUPREE: Sir?
that's a beautiful Schwinn bike you got out there, DuPree.
thank you. Although it's not exactly state-of-the-art.
it's about 25 years old, so sometimes I feel like it's tough to keep up with the other riders on the road.
now, I don't buy that.
did you read Lance Armstrong's book, It's Not About the Bike?
the bike. Touche. And it's true.
it isn't about the bike. It's about here.
it's about your heart.---- And that's the truth.
and I've said it to Carl. If you...
did you see his seventh win?
the final one?---- DUPREE: The last one?
I watched every stage. ----Carl. Get the Phone.
thompson: Me, too. I've watched every single one of those races.
DUPREE: Did you ever cry? ----THOMPSON: Oh, yeah.
I defy you to watch that and not cry.
daddy? Excuse me. Could you pass the wine, Please?
DUPREE: What color was your bike?
hello. ----Hey, Carl.
Hey, hey. It's Neil.
okay, so is it in, like, the garbage, or did you recycle it?
listen, you sleazebag. Get off my ProPerty!
I'm tired of this crap! Get the hell out of here! Go home!
jackpot.
it's the wrong number.
you like to fish, DuPree?
I'm not the world's greatest fisherman.
although I did have one Pretty great adventure.
true story. Off the coast of Baja during spring break,
I spent four days reeling in this marlin.
great, big, old shitkicker, and I finally landed him.
four days?
well, I hope you mounted that son of a bitch.
no. I didn't. Catch and release, Bob. Honor the fish.
thompson: That's really noble.
Dupree. How would you like to go fishing with me in my boat?
DUPREE: Really?
Yeah. Just the two of us.
DUPREE: Why not?
Hey, Bob, is it just me, or are the albacore really jumPing?
you're funny.
what type of fool thinks it's albacore season?
Dupree, from now on, you call me "Dad."
Yeah. Go out there. Maybe bring Molly along.
nice, DuPree. Need some of this?
you sure you're okay with this, Bob?
as long as it's not Carl, you can do anything you want with her.
poetry, Aunt Kathy, librarian-banging, backstabbing, bike-riding, couch-burning masturbator!
you ruined my life! You ruined my life! ----Carl, get off of him! Stop it!
get a hold of yourself!
MOLLY: Oh, my God! ----I will not get a hold of myself!
this is my house!---- Are you kidding me?
what are you gonna do, hit me with that thing?
you gonna hit me? ----Carl, stop it!
come on! I dare you!
dad!
you dared me.
don't tell me you want the Porn back, because you can't have it!
why is it all Asian?
whoa, what's with the bag of frozen Peas, man?
there was a little bit of a blowout at the house.
my wallet's still there and my car's boxed in.
it's not a big deal. I need a place to stay.
I've got nowhere to go. ----You want to stay here?
Yeah. ----Yeah. That'll be fun.
that'll be really cool. Let me ask Annie.
Neil: Yo, Annie.---- ANNIE: What?
Carl wants to stay here. ----Carl?
Oh, really? I just got off the Phone with Molly. He tried to kill DuPree.
he cannot stay here. ----He needs somewhere...
what are we gonna do? ----Be afraid in my sleep? No!
tell him to leave! Now! Now!---- Okay. Fine. I said fine!
look, I don't know what you did, but she just talked to Molly.
she's freaked out at you right now, man.
Neil, what are you saying? I can't come into your house right now?
you cannot come in here.
she said so, man. She makes the rules.
you know what? I don't need this, Neil.
I don't need this. I don't need this!
I'm sorry! ----ANNIE: Neil, get back in here!
she controls what I do!
guys' night. Thursday. I'll see you there.
frankly, Molly, I'm worried about your safety.
maybe I should have Paco come stay at the house.
Oh, Dad, Please. I don't need this right now.
Molly, I love you more than anything, but you're an idealist.
you don't see the world the way it is.
the doc says most of my injuries are emotional.
dad. I'm going to ask you something, and remember, you've never lied to me before.
do you ever really want my marriage to work?
that's a really complicated question, Molly.
no. Actually, it's not.
Dupree.
Molly? Molly.
Bob, before I go, I have my own question for you.
and remember, you've never lied to me either, as far as I know.
who did you really want to get a vasectomy?
me? Or was it, in fact, Carl?
take care of your neck, DuPree.
okay, Bob.
Carl?
he didn't come home last night.
he loves you, Molly.
I know. I know.
maybe it's just not enough.
it has to be enough. It is enough.
Dupree, you gotta piece this beautiful thing back together again.
by God, it took 36 years, 9 months, and 23 days for the mother shiP to sPeak.
well, guess what?
Dupree hears you.
okay, gather around! Come on! Everybody, gather around! Over here!
boy: What's going on, DuPree?
I'm gonna tell you what's going on. We got an emergency.
that's why I gave you permission to miss school.
now, listen. Carl's missing.
he ran away from home last night.
it's up to us to find him. And here's the deal.
I don't know what he's capable of.
if he attacks you, go limp. Play dead.
that's what I did, and I think it saved my life.
Toshi, pass out these fliers. Give them to everybody.
okay, Nancy, go to Neil's house. ----Okay, I'm on it.
go. Go! Cesar, get up here.
I want you to hit the grocery store. ----Got it.
thompson Land DeveloPment. Danger! Be careful here.
go! Go! Fall out!
and if you see him, call someone. Do the buddy system. Run!
I'm just looking for this guy, Carl Peterson, if you see him. Right here.
I've just lost my friend. Carl Peterson.
here you go. Just stand there. Put your head through this.
Carl!
here you go. There you go. Looking for a friend. That's all.
back again, huh?
just came in to make a pit stop.
well, that's good 'cause your cot's been taken.
what's he talking about?
in case you think I'm still in love with Molly, maybe you should take a look at these.
they're all about Mandy. Love Poems.
sonnets. Little ditties, haikus.
I loved her.
how come you never told me you wrote Poems?
I don't know. I guess I figured you'd call me a homo.
well, I guess I might have.
listen, if there's one thing I know about, it's loving and losing.
but you can't lose unless you stop waiting. And...
look, DuPree. Listen, I'm really not in the mood for one of your soliloquies.
my life's in the shitter right now. ----Yes, it is.
but what are you gonna do? Quit?
so what if you made some mistakes. Everybody does.
so what if her dad hates you.
you think you're the first guy to be hated by his father-in-law?
so what if he beat your ass with a candlestick.
that's Probably happened before.
the Point is, is somewhere along the road, you lost your magic.
they knocked you off your game. Your Carlness went right out the window.
what's with this "Carlness"? It's not even a real word.
Yes, it is.---- Oh, it is?
it's a verb. It's a conjunction, a PrePosition, it's a PhilosoPhy, a way of life.
it's your name with "ness" attached to it.
bullshit. There's never been any Carlness.
there's just Carl.
well, I'm glad we got that straightened out. My mistake.
you know, the truth is,
I never really thought you and Molly were right for each other.
there was something about her I never bought, right from Jump Street.
that whole, "Hey, look at me. I'm a great Person.
I'm always smiling. I'm Pretty. I'm smart. I work with inner city kids.
get the hell out of there. I saw through that sham, and you did, too.
and if you want to know the truth, frankly, I'd blame her.
now, wait a minute! ----No, I won't hold it!
hold on a second! ----Your life is going to hell in a hand basket!
Molly is the best damn thing that ever happened to me.
leave her out of this. ----Sure she is.
did you see what just happened? When I tricked you?
all of a sudden you had that instinct to fight, that Carlness.
that's what this situation needs. It's crying out for it.
you're trying to get it back, that fight, the will to fight.
you're thinking.
come on. What do you got?
Dupree, get your helmet.
shit.
Paco's on duty.
Hey, can you get me 10 minutes in there? ----I'll get you 15.
hold on a second. He's a lot faster than he looks.
hello there. Have a message I need to deliver.
do you have identification? ----No.
you kidding me? Just got the old bike here.
pretty obvious I'm a bike messenger.
what are you, Samoan?
what do you think?
could be Greek. Could be Italian. Either way, you're a big man.
it's okay, I specialize in big men.
where is your message?
I keep them up here. Saves on the Paperwork.
all right. Have a good day. Maybe I'll see you around.
come on.
hold it.
they said you were quick.
easy now, big 'un. I got to tell you, you're catching me on a day where I'm throwing seven different kinds of smoke.
yeah? Let's see them.
that's what I thought.
that's number one.
baby wants to play chase? Okay, let's chase.
okay, here we go. Here we go.
up or down? UP or down?
down!
gotcha. ----Missed! Number two.
Mr. Peterson-ThomPson?
where is he?
PACO: Stop! Stop!
DUPREE: Catch up!
guy in chair. Number three.
did you see that? I got him.
dispatch, lock down the building.
that was my number four.
what's number five?---- I can't tell you. I don't know myself.
nice job, weasel. Now it's on!
number five, invisible.
woman: What is he doing?
you can manufacture these for $90 a square foot.
you sell them at $400 a square foot.
you got 25 in this whole arena right here.
I even think you can do the advertisement, "Fifty million square feet."
come here, weasel!
number six.
open the door. ----I need a number seven.
Oh, shit.
I need a number seven!
you want Samoa? I'll give you Samoa!
hello. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.
you know, for the last 14 hours, all I've thought about is kicking your ass.
don't make me look for another candlestick, Carl.
I've taken you down once. I could do it again.
not today, Bob. Not today.
I'll go get Paco. Yeah. ----You go get Paco.
you've done everything you can to undermine me.
you've tried to intimidate me. You've tried to humiliate me.
you bastardized my Project to the Point where it's unrecognizable.
but here's the thing, Bob. I don't care.
I don't care about this job, and I don't care about you.
I care about Molly.
she means everything in the world to me.
and if you're going to stand in the way of me trying to win her back, you'd better bring a pretty big candlestick.
Carl?
Hey, Carl.
you... Will you all excuse us?
can everybody go?
you know, Carl, I've been thinking maybe I was a little rough on you. ----A little?
but you got to understand, you know, I love Molly, too.
and I've been having a really, really tough time letting go of her.
you asked me to get a vasectomy.
Yeah, that was a little excessive.
I apologize.
I'm not gonna hyphenate my name, Bob.
I know.
Hey. There's Carl and DuPree.
Dupree found Carl.
he's on his own now.
Molly?
Carl: Molly?
Molly.
I'm sorry.
don't ever walk out on me again.
ever.
I know. I lost it.
I didn't know what I was doing anymore.
well, Carl, I don't always know what I'm doing, either.
but we are in this together, when it's good, when it's bad.
Yeah.
I mean, so you launched yourself across our dining room table at your best friend like a crazy Person.
I guess I... But, ----Carl,
I know who you are. And I love who you are.
and that's why we don't walk out on each other.
I love you, Molly.
and I Promise you, I'm not going anywhere.
Yes! My work is done here.
come on! Let's go! Go!
who wants some ice cream? Go down there and you get it. Go!
Yeah!
Dupree ON MICROPHONE: Life may knock you down. Scratch that.
I'm okay.
life will knock you down. Okay?
it'll kick you in the gut and knock you to the curb.
but you can't let it rob you of your "ness.
now what's "ness"? It's your name Plus "ness.
you, sir, white-haired gentleman, what's your name?
my name's Joe. ----No! It's Joeness.
you follow me? Listen to me.
hang on to that, and as long as you do, you'll always be ready.
because when that moment comes, and trust me, it will come, that's when you start throwing Seven different kinds of smoke!
the mother ship hears you!
Paco! Kick it!
relax. Nobody's been up here in years.
Oh, Christ.
- This way?
where? - It's up there?
Hey, you sure it's up there?
he's sure.
he'd better be right. You tell him.
come on. Let's get the stuff.
step on it.
should be a gold mine
why the hell would they build a church out here?
check this.
here we go.
my God. Look at the walls.
there's nothing here.
so where's the cave? - You're standing on it.
so, how do we get in?
fire in the hole.
perfect. Let's go.
- Shut up.
shut up!
what the hell's that?
you know what? It's more than a cave.
this one could run deeper than Postojna.
Oh, look at this.
if this is what I think it is, it's going to be a fantastic find.
let's have a look at it shall we?
yeah
hear that? Running water. It's a good sign.
Nic?
come Have a look at this
we're going to need cave divers.
I know just who to call.
no picture, Charlie. This antenna's a piece of junk.
how's that? - Got it.
Strodey! Get your skinny ass down here!
boys. You found it yet?
Jesus! My kids could get in and find it quicker than you two.
ready, Top? - Yeah.
Jack and Tyler back yet?
not yet.
top: That's Tyler 's unit He found it
bastard did it again.
Jack's gonna be pissed. He called time five minutes ago.
you don 't have to say anything. I know I was stupid, but... we got it.
Hey, I call time, and you surface.
OK.
how's that? You got a signal there yet? - Not yet, Strodey.
and now? - Yeah
Yeah.
dr Nicolai - Hello
Hey. It's Jack.
you got some good news? - Yeah we've got the funding
you do? Really?
we've done the surface scans The cave is huge Jack
there is a river off the main cavern, and there's nowhere it can come out for at least 19 miles
sounds like the Amazon of underground rivers, huh?
dr Jennings our biologist is bringing a cameraman to shoot the whole thing but you know it 's gonna be tough.
which is why I need your team and need you to run the show.
great! When do we start?
we want to start right away
we're in a hundred per cent
that's great Jack I can 't wait to see you here Ciao!
Thanks, Dr Nicolai. - Bye!
good to finally meet you, Dr Nicolai.
NICOLAl: Let me show you around - Please
what have we got?
that's the main cave, hidden under the church and half the mountainside.
Tyler? - Yeah?
everything made it OK.
take a look at this mix computer. It got a little banged up.
Oh, man. Yep.
all right. Break it down, and reinstall the programming.
Tyler: Whoa!
hello.
I'm just gonna go visit with a fellow scientist - Hi. - Hi.
I'm Tyler McAlister. I'm the first scout.
one second.
do you mind if I... - Sorry. Let me just move this for you.
dr Jennings. - It's good to meet you.
and this is Alex Kim our cameraman.
Oh, yeah. I've seen your work.
heard a lot about you, too.
so, it's unusual for a rebreather.
who modified it? - That would be my brother Jack.
Really? - Yep.
I did all the reprogramming, though.
why the canister?
we're using lithium hydroxide to filter out the CO2.
it's a little dangerous, but it's much more effective than calcium.
hope you got a redundancy for this Meg.
there's actually a triple redundancy. It's the backup, a primary, and a HUD.
so you can stay submerged for what, 18, 20 hours?
24.0
Kate. Alex. This is Jack McAlister.
dr Jennings. - It's a pleasure.
we read about some of your Yucatan expeditions. Pretty amazing.
thank you, thank you.
I don't understand you have a great interest in cave biology, Mr McAIlister.
I'm starting to.
and it's just Jack, please. - Kathryn.
perhaps you want to see some samples? - Yeah, sure.
Hey, bro. Double-check all the rebreathers, will you?
Yeah. One in 14.
one in 14?
it's the number of cave divers that die each year.
what's this?
it's all that's left of some poor guy they found in the mouth of the cave.
Tyler? Let's go.
so how did you hook up with these guys?
my dad had a dive business in North Florida, and when Jack got out of high school, he kind of took him under his wing.
we're all kind of like family. - And Tyler?
he joined the business out of college.
Briggs we found table-dancing in a club outside Calgary.
all right, everybody, listen up. Here we go.
you all right Strode? - Yeah, good, man.
I've been analysing these read-outs, and here's what we got.
there's an enormous cavern about 300 feet down, just below the cave entrance.
dr Nicolai has already named it Titan Hall. - Oh, yeah, it's huge, believe me.
there's a sump... Strode?
...right about here, which then leads to this underwater passageway.
look who's here
Jack: We need to find a dry cavern somewhere in the system where we can set up advance base camp, and Dr Nicolai and Kathryn can gather their samples
we'll be under for 12 days. We're gonna go deep on this one.
Yeah! - All right
top, anything you want to add?
everybody just remember, now - this cave is a very serious piece of work.
it's already taken at least one life
Briggs, you're gonna take first scout.
Ouch.
BRIGGS: Right on
Jack: Any questions? All right listen
a toast - To virgin caves. ALL: To virgin caves!
Cheers. Thank you very much.
to virgin everything.
they built the church to seal the cave as a display of God's protective power.
now, try to imagine...
these Knights Templar entering the cave, and according to the local legend, fighting these winged demons.
demons, huh? - Yeah
well? Did they win?
unfortunately, no.
european legends always have sad endings.
there you go.
Yeah.
is the ladder safe? - Yeah, I hate ladders. - Whoa!
next thing you know they're putting in elevators.
she's such a show-off.
it's the only way to go, doc.
Whoo!
Oh, man.
titan Hall
Charlie: It 's awesome.
top: Pre-dive checklist O2 sensors calibrated?
BRIGGS: Calibrated, check.
top: Oxygen running 0. 4?
0. 4. Check.
now, you find it, you name it. Make it good.
first scout's privilege. I got a few ideas. You know I'll come up with something good.
OK. Synchronise watches to 0811 on my mark.
three, two, one, mark.
all OK? - I don 't think it could be any better, Tyler.
Yeah, I bet. - All right. Here we go.
this is a long passage, so I want you to pace yourself now.
Yeah.
turnaround's one-third, OK?
if I find a dry cavern, I'll give you a call, Jack.
you'd do that, would you? - Go and get it!
Jack: How's it looking down there?
it's dark, it's deep, and it's wet, Jack.
give us your current depth - Depth at 162
what's your gas reading?
o2's reading 1800
so, how you feeling down there, Brggs'?
I'm feeling pretty good How you feeling up there?
I'm all right.
how about the warning lights? How do they look?
nothing yet There's a curve in the tunnel up ahead though
probably gonna lose you guys on the dark side of the moon
tell Tyler I will give him a call from first base camp after I set up that fibre optic
you know, Briggs, I'd warn you not to be so arrogant, but then you'd have no personality at all.
come on Top Take away the arrogance
Charlie: There he goes - That's it.
Thanks, Strode.
we need you ready around 0100 hours, all right?
Oh, I've been ready.
you got something to say, say it.
you know I'm the best scout. - Maybe so
but I can count on Briggs.
first scout consolation prize.
Yeah. - You wish it was you in there?
I just wanna be first in a place nobody's ever been.
well, you and I aren 't that different.
I mean, if I find something unique, I want to put my name on it.
so, what happened?
it's my brother's call. JACK: Hey Tyler!
checked the line three times. There's nothing wrong with it. We just don 't have a signal.
check every five minutes till we get something.
Tyler: What's up?
if he doesn 't show in ten, I'm sending you in. - It's Briggs. He's probably just showing off.
Jack!
guys! I got him. - Wakey wakey
titan Hall! Is anybody there?
all right Get up!
morning. We're all here, buddy. Where are you?
good morning to you too Top I'd say llm sitting at advance base camp which will now be forever known as Kublai Khan.
about how far in would you say, Briggs?
Oh only about 24 miles Jack - Fantastic! - 2. 4!
I'm uploading the data now Read it and weep.
it's amazing in here man
I haven 't seen a hole like this in a long time
Oh shit!
Briggs! - Yeah Hold on a second Something ran past me. Got it!
Kathryn can you and Nicolai see this?
it's some kind of a large rat or a mole or something
buck teeth webbed feet looks a lot like Tyler - You all right, man? - Shit!
yeah
I think I pissed him off with that Tyler comment
listen, man, good work. Get some sleep now.
Yeah, yeah. Some sleep - You need anything down there, man? - Hold on a sec
Jack: Briggs?
yeah Yeah hold on guys - I'm gonna to try to get
there's something that - Briggs?
what's up, Strode? - Could be feedback in the line.
what was that? Damn, pick the picture.
fibre optic must have snapped, huh?
maybe we need to send another one to make sure he is safe.
no, come on. We gotta get in the water.
top and I are in the water in 30 minutes.
strode, Tyler, fix the cable on the way in. Let's do it.
OK, let's be a little slower.
break in the line could be anywhere
strode: Right on your tail mate
Jack: It 's not bad huh Top?
yeah there's a lot of life in here
Jack: You OK?
yeah Just thinking about Briggs - He can take care of himself.
how long does it take to get to the cave?
Jack: It 's a long run Nicolai Enjoy the ride
Charlie: This beats anything in you do here.
hey Kim did you get a shot of those cave draperies? Sick dude!
Alex: I got it
Charlie: It 's totally rockin.
Jack: Dr Nicolai you and Katherine should check this out
advance base camp should be about 200 yards ahead
thank you, we see you there.
yo, Briggs!
Briggs!
Briggs!
Hey, Briggs!
about time you two ladies got here! Come take a look at this.
we're not the first ones here after all.
top: Looks like somebody lost his boots.
strode: What the hell was that?
strode: Tyler hang on l'm gonna make a jump here for a second.
Tyler: Strode how you doing? - Good I think I saw one of those moles - Be right back - All right I will keep looking for the break
strode I found the break right here It's gonna take me a few minutes
Strode? Hey Strode?
yeah right here Just give me another minute
BRIGGS: There's a flat area just up there where we can set up camp.
Charlie: Any hot showers? BRIGGS: That would make my day.
top: I've had enough water.
Tyler? You still reading me mate?
Tyler?
Whoo!
what the hell?
what the...
son of a bitch!
Hey, Tyler. Tyler, you read me?
what the hell ? strode
this cable looks chewed - Mate, you there?
- Argh!
help! Help! - Strode? Strode!
Strode! Can you hear me? Where are you Strode?
Jack: Tyler! CHARLIE: Jesus! What the hell was that?
Jack: Top!
Jack: Tyler, Tyler, hey... You all right?
Yeah. Yeah. I think so. - Where's Strode? Huh?
I... I don 't know.
shit! Top. - Bring the J-bar.
he kept saying, "help," like he was being attacked, so I went back, but I don 't know what the hell exploded.
at least the rope is connected.
Jack: Let's keep our eyes open
top: Looks like the whole damn tunnel collapsed
Jack: He's got to be in here It's the only way through. Son of a bitch!
top: Jack? JACK: That's his counter lung
Oh man this isn 't good
top: Jack look out! It 's coming down!
shit!
Jack, back on the rope.
all right, listen up.
the first is that we're not going out the way we came.
the passage is completely blocked.
the second is that we're not even gonna be missed for 12 days, which is right about when our supplies run out.
so we're gonna have to find our own way out. BRIGGS: Hold on a second!
you still haven 't told us what happened to Strode.
Tyler said it sounded like he was being attacked.
he was Special Forces, for Christ's sake, Jack.
he knew what the hell he was doing.
something got him. I'll bet you it was the same thing that got whoever owns those boots.
we're all hurting, man.
strode was a friend to all of us
don 't you forget that.
what do you think, Dr Nicolai?
is there anything that could have attacked Strode?
I don 't know. The mole is the largest animal we've seen in this type of system.
our friend here does prove there's an abundant food supply.
question is, is he at the top of the food chain, or is there something else?
strode could have just screwed up his mix.
narcosis hallucinations
it happens. I mean, he panics, he ruptures his scooter.
whatever it was, it doesn 't matter now.
because right now our primary concern is getting out of here alive.
Jack, this is the Carpathians.
we could spend an eternity trying to find a way out lf... there even is one.
come on, Jack, we wait. A rescue team will come for us.
dr Nicolai, we're a mile below the surface and three miles in.
the best people to get us out are all right here.
we are the rescue team.
now, here's how it's gonna go. Top and I, we're gonna start scouting for an exit immediately.
now I'd recommend that you all get some rest. You're gonna need it.
Jack: Top.
I never lost anybody, Top.
I don 't like it, Mac. Something's not right.
no shit, buddy.
narcosis my ass! That's bullshit and you know it.
I'm not getting into this.
why is that, Tyler? Because you forgot to stick with your dive buddy?
you asshole! I had no idea...
Charlie: Hey! You guys!
Hey! Stop it!
you guys, cut it out! Stop it!
Hey! We just lost a friend, and this is how you deal with it?
come on.
never seen a white algae bed before.
Yeah. Looks like we found the base of the food chain.
it's not the base I'm worried about.
someone made it this far.
let's keep moving.
Nicolai. Look at this.
it's a parasite. - Mm-hm.
that's from the mole.
Yeah. - And this is from the salamander.
it's the same parasite. - Uh huh.
think we should have tried door number two.
it looks like it opens up. I'm gonna try to slip through.
Jack: Ah shit Hey Top?
yeah?
you mind backing up, bud?
backing up.
Jack.
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
get the medical kit!
BRIGGS: I got it! TYLER: What happened?
Ah, shit! Look at him. You all right?
top, what do you need? Tell me! What happened, Top?
found that hooked in his sling. - What the hell is that?
I cut it off. - Did you get a look at it?
it jumped me too fast. - Hold still.
Jesus, how big was it? - It's big.
how's it looking? - Ripped you up good.
need to put you on an antibiotic. Give me a syringe!
you son of a bitch!
all right
there's a... There's a resemblance to amphibian tissue, but these hair follicles would seem to rule that out.
I mean, the only thing I do know - this is definitely a predator.
so now we're part of the food chain.
we always have been. Just forgotten that, living in cities.
- Just reflexes. Don 't worry.
what is it? - Without DNA testing, it's impossible to tell.
every cave organism we've discovered so far originated on the surface.
over time, they've adapted.
lost pigmentation and sight, developed a heightened sense of hearing and smell.
if this is a totally self-contained ecosystem...
Yes, we may have discovered the primeval creature that has evolved in total isolation.
well, it looks like a piece from those things on the mosaic.
look - What? - There.
Charlie: It 's still alive?
those tendrils look familiar? - Yeah. The parasite.
it appears to be ubiquitous.
all right, let's pack it up.
it's time to go.
we should wait here.
wow, that's just brilliant, doc.
you really wanna be sitting here on your ass when the lights go out?
top: OK, people, take only what you need, but keep your dive gear.
Charlie: Hey maybe there's a way to climb out
Yeah, better up than down.
top: Looks like we found the owner of those boots
teeth marks.
let's go.
take a break right here - Talk about a fork in the road, huh? CHARLIE: A fork or a dead end?
Where's Jack? - Scouting the tunnel
BRIGGS: So, why aren 't we helping him?
you know the drill, Briggs. Give him a chance to read the sediment.
Yeah, I know the drill, Top. You don 't have to tell me about drills.
sonar gun 's right here...
what the hell's going on?
just wanna get the hell out of here.
well, maybe you ought to follow me, Briggs.
this is bullshit.
BRIGGS: Jack didn 't pick the dominant artery - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
this is the one right here. Take a look at it.
there's something in there that wasn 't there before.
well, why don 't you go scout it out for us, Briggs?
forget about it.
Charlie: On belay.
you 're safe to climb
you gotta let me change that bandage when we get to the top.
I'm all right.
looks like it's getting infected. You sure?
how many expeditions we been on together, Top?
too many.
KATHRYN: We need a break. TYLER: Not with that thing out there.
you gotta let them rest, Jack.
once we hit the water. - The water?
I don 't hear any water, Jack. - Yeah
I smell it.
we're gonna need footage like this.
get that camera out of my face! - Hold on a second
KATHRYN: Hey, hey. Quit...
Alex: That camera paid for this expedition - Alex.
I'm sorry.
sorry.
Yeah.
there's a current.
grab some food. You two keep an eye out.
I'm getting a little worried. Gangrene might be setting in.
I don 't think those antibiotics are working. - What should we do?
not sure we can do anything. TYLER: Maybe I should talk to him?
BRIGGS: I've never seen Jack like this before. He's completely losing it.
Alex: We're five miles in. CHARLIE: We're not going back.
Alex: That's for sure. CHARLIE: Jack's the most experienced one.
Charlie: If anyone can get us out, it's him. BRIGGS: Come on!
BRIGGS: We don 't know where the hell we're going.
how you doing?
Jack...
I'm worried about you.
Briggs is gonna be a problem.
you know that, don 't you?
I can 't save them, Tyler, if they don 't trust me.
I'm gonna need your help with that.
you understand?
OK.
Tyler: All right Let's get in the water.
let's not get too spread out. Everybody should be in the water by now.
let's hope it doesn 't come to that.
the current's pushing us up
looks like it 's pretty choppy up there
all right, listen up. Secure all your gear.
Jack, we don 't know where the rapids go. - What do you want to do, go back?
she's right. We should find another way. - This is the goddamn way!
I'll go first. - Yeah get going - All right, Dr Nicolai, you're coming with me. - You'll be fine, all right? Come on.
Tyler, you take Kathryn. Let's go!
Briggs, Charlie, go now!
Jack!
Argh!
Jack: Dr Nicolail
here.
now put your goggles on and hang onto me
here we go.
your brother's got a serious death wish.
listen to me. You have to trust him, OK? We will get out.
it's OK. You'll be fine. Come on.
I'm stuck!
what is it? - Tyler, something has me!
cut your harness free! - Tyler!
Kathryn, the current's too strong! - Tyler, I'm stuck!
I can 't get back! - Tyler!
Kathryn!
Tyler!
Tyler!
my God!
Tyler!
help me!
what happened? You OK?
something had me back there. - You hurt?
I'm OK. I'm OK.
there's something in the water!
Oh, shit! It's some kind of eel.
Jack: Does anybody have eyes on Dr Nicolai or Charlie?
Yeah, I got Charlie and Kathryn.
nicolai's wracked up on the rocks above the falls. He's in bad shape.
all right. Flare's coming up. Top.
I see them.
Yeah, looks like a couple of hundred yards. All right. Come on. Come on.
Jack: Alex you all right?
well, that was a great idea. - You're alive, aren 't you?
Tyler: Jack - Everyone all right? - Yeah.
Jack: Stick close together.
Jack: That's Dr Nicolai. Top, light another one. I'm gonna go after him.
help me!
Jack: Nicolail
I'm here!
Nicolai!
Nicolai! - Everybody stay put!
Nicolai!
we have to help him! - No! Everybody in a circle!
backs to the centre. KATHRYN: We have to help him! Nicolai!
dr Nicolai?
we can 't just sit here. There's got to be a shore close.
nobody's going anywhere till Jack gets back.
- What was that? You hear that?
Oh, shit! What the hell was that?
top: Get back in a circle! - I can 't take this! God!
Nicolai!
Nicolai!
let's get the hell out of the water.
he said he didn 't want to go deeper, Jack! He was your responsibility!
he said he didn 't want to go deeper.
it's over, Kathryn.
BRIGGS: There's a ledge here. We can walk.
what the hell is that? - Echolocation.
this thing can probably see us as easily as a bat sees a moth in complete darkness.
Jack: Wait here. I'm gonna scout ahead.
BRIGGS: It's a strong current. It's definitely worth a try.
KATHRYN: Yeah.
that's gotta come up on the surface.
I'm not sure I like the idea of deep water right now.
Jack: Tyler
you and I are going up this wall.
but this is the main water flow. We just follow it out of the system.
when we get to the top, we'll secure ropes. The rest of you come up on ascenders.
Jack, I'm the best climber. I'll go first.
nobody's climbing anywhere. There's a huge exit sign right here in front of us...
you don 't have a goddamn clue what's going on.
it's a trap.
the wall's the safest option. - Jack's right. I'll go.
I said no.
let's go.
you see that?
that's where we're going - I'll route the left. Let's do it. - All right.
a little insurance for you guys.
we bored out these propane valves. Should give you a nice flame for four or five feet.
scare anything that tries to come close. Enough for a couple of blasts.
Kim, give me a hand with this. - Yeah.
Jack's ill, Tyler. He's not fit to lead anymore.
he's not the man we started with. - He's my brother.
Charlie!
I told you no!
KATHRYN: Hey, be careful! - Get the rope.
get your ass back down here, Charlie!
I'll be all right!
BRIGGS: The girl's quick man Get the rope TOP: OK l'm on belay
let's find a route. Let's go!
BRIGGS: Top, you got it?
top: Damn that girl moves fast
BRIGGS: Be careful up there Charlie!
Jack ON RADIO: Charlie you got good holds to your right - - Keep moving right
Tyler: I think she's over the edge BRIGGS: All right!
Alex: How the heck are we gonna follow that? JACK: She went over the bump She's good
top: I got it here Keep feeding it out.
there we go.
BRIGGS: How's it holding? How's it holding Tyler?
Tyler: Looks good.
safe!
Jack: Talk to me Charlie What's going on?
is the line set? Ready to climb Charlie
Charlie?
Jack, I'm over the edge. I can feel a draught.
Jack: I'm going up. TOP: Go for it.
what's going on, Charlie?
you safe Charlie?
Charlie?
Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie, talk to me!
Jack: Charlie!
get me down!
it 's up here! - Get that rope free!
Jack! - I'm going up!
Jack: Come on, guys! Come on!
get me down! Save me!
Charlie!
they fly! They freak in fly!
No!
Charlie!
there's enough secured rope to make it to the opening.
what's happening to you?
as long as we stay together as a group, we can hold them back.
I think I know now.
it's a parasite. - That's from a parasite?
it mutates the host so they can both survive down here in this environment.
and that's what's gonna happen to all of us? - I don 't know, Alex.
I'd say...
it entered your bloodstream through one of your cuts.
Jack, it's affecting your nervous system.
so the other cavers? It happened to them.
so, what? It just ate them? - No.
they weren 't eaten by the creatures.
they are the creatures. Right, Jack?
and now there's nothing human left. - They're enjoying this, Kathryn.
so now you understand them, Jack?
Jack. Jack, you're gonna be fine.
you've gotten us this far. - Got us this far, Tyler?
come on. He got Charlie and Dr Nicolai dead.
that's what he got
no. No more.
the river's the way out.
Kathryn 's right. I'm with her.
who else is coming?
Alex?
if you ever wanna see the sun again, you should follow me now.
this is bullshit! We have to stay together!
Tyler, look at him. He's not human.
we need you with us.
Tyler?
good luck.
BRIGGS: Fine Let's get in the water
tell me we're doing the right thing.
don 't stop believing in him, Tyler.
Jack: It 's getting cold
where to?
down.
are you sure ?
Yeah, down.
my lead. Let's go. - Yeah.
you OK?
Yeah, it's solid! Off rope!
Argh!
Tyler! - Tyler!
shit!
hold on, Top!
shit!
top! Top! You all right?
my leg.
can you walk? - I don 't know.
Oh, shit!
Tyler: Looks like the rebreather punched a hole through the ice
Yeah.
smells like methane.
some kind of killing ground.
it's just like Nicolai's mosaic legend.
that means there's gotta be an opening close by.
top! Tyler!
you see the light? - Yeah.
there's cold water coming up. That's the way out of here.
I think you're right. - It must have been a dry passage.
- Jack? Jack?
Jack, what's happening? Top?
what's going on?
Jack.
you two get out of here. I'm going back for them.
you're in no condition. Top can barely walk.
I'm the one that has to go. - Put your gear on and get in the water.
I'm not getting in the water. You're not going back.
Mac. Whoa! Whoa!
he's right.
now, come on, Jack. You led us here. You were right.
but I'm doing this now. I'm going back for them.
this is the way. We walk until it opens up again.
run. Run!
Jack: Shit, we got company. He must have followed us here.
this thing has got to have a weakness
Jack: Everything's got a weakness TOP: Where is it?
it's moving.
top!
it took one of the rebreathers.
he's playing with us.
Kathryn!
Briggs!
help!
Briggs! - Help!
Briggs!
no, no!
come on! - No!
come on!
Tyler!
shit!
help!
Tyler
Briggs.
Kathryn.
where?
sorry. Go.
go - No.
Briggs!
shit.
Tyler.
are you all right? What happened?
why did they leave? - Sound waves.
they retreat from the pulse. Doesn 't last long.
we found a way out. - Jack was right.
and the others? Briggs?
no, no. He didn 't make it.
Where's Kim? - I don 't know. We got separated.
shit!
all right, come on. This way.
this is it. You ready?
you can make it - Yeah.
all right.
let's go.
don 't be scared. It's gonna be fine.
watch your head.
Tyler!
Tyler: We've gotta go under
come on, Kathryn. Breathe.
are you all right?
Alex! - We gotta go. They're coming this way!
look, I can 't go back in the water. - Come on.
the way out's next to an ice vein. This has to connect to the other one. Let's go.
all right.
they gotta be here somewhere.
but where?
Jack, Top.
quiet.
kill your light.
Where's Briggs?
they're watching us.
they see with sound.
and the steam, it's confusing them.
they took one of our rebreathers, but they've left us alone since.
they're waiting on something. - There were more right behind us.
we should get in the water now.
look. This works for a while.
we have to split out the tanks, the air and oxygen. Won 't last long, but it's our only choice.
we need the other rebreather, Tyler.
you see it there?
yeah - I'm going for it You get the rest in the water
OK.
Tyler: Top start breaking down that unit
Kathryn you and Alex buddy-breathe from the air tank
top, that's gonna leave you with the oxygen.
no regulator - Cool.
Jack!
I'll cover you with the mapping gun.
all right, let's go. Let's get out of here.
Tyler: Let's go! Come on!
Alex!
Oh!
top: Tyler! - Tyler!
Jack!
Tyler, behind us!
Tyler!
Jack, there 's another one!
Jack, no!
go!
Jack! Get in the water!
come on, mother...
No!
top: You gonna be OK, Tyler? - Yeah.
take care of yourself, man.
Bye, Kathryn.
travel safe, OK? - All right.
Tyler?
I'm sorry.
you're thinking about him.
Yeah.
you said that parasite was changing him.
I mean, he never could have survived out here, could he?
at first... I thought it could only survive in a cave environment.
but now I'm not so sure.
I think it wants to get out.
no.
excuse me.
Hey!
but me, l ain't playin' no more.
man, Coach Porter say we work hard, we gonna be winners.
we worked hard, but we got destroyed.
he didn't even tell me when l was supposed to be on the field.
then he starts screamin' at me.
man, what the hell y'all doin'?
Sean. Can l see you a minute?
can it wait till after practice? -No.
this better not be about stoppin' the program.
kids don't wanna play anymore. -Then let them tell me that.
Sean, l was hoping it'd work. But during the game, it...
listen, if it's me, l'll let Malcolm take over the team. l'll quit.
we wanted to create self-esteem. But it was just the opposite.
these kids, they can't handle that kind of disappointment.
I'm really sorry, but I've gotta pull the plug.
so Donald Lopez. We need verification from Van Nuys court.
the document number is 2...
M-U-S-T-A... -I'll call you back.
...N-G-S.
M-U-S-T-A-N-G-S!
Mustangs! Mustangs! Mustangs!
all right, clap it up.
Hey, Coach.
Sean, what's goin' on here?
l don't know. Whose idea was this?
like l told you, Coach, we're tired of bein' losers.
you still with us?
l'm with the team.
yo, Mr. Higa. Catch.
yo, Mr. Higa. Hit me.
run a post pattern. -Paul.
good catch, Kelvin! That's what l'm talkin' about!
41-yard gain by number 31, Kelvin Owens.
all right, Kelvin!
bulldogs 21, Mustangs 14. 1.12 remaining in the fourth quarter.
lt's 21-1 4. We can maybe win our first game right here.

and the final score, Bulldogs 21, Mustangs 14.
you're a tough kid, Willie, but you give up on yourself way too easy.
you're a good football player, too. l think you may even be great.
and l'm gonna push you until we find out.
we gonna start with the circles to the front.
ey, yo. Ey, yo. What the...
man, what's he think he's doin'? -That fool crazy.
l've come for Willie Weathers.
what you want with me?
l'm here to find out just how good you are.
this a joke? -Let's go.
leon, throw Willie the ball.
you see this line, Willie?
you knock me past this line, you'll have my respect.
what if l don't wanna?
then everybody will think you're a chicken shit.
'chicken shit " ? that's wrong.
let's see what you got, Weathers.
come on, Weathers, l wanna make it clear. Run through me. Run over me.
that's not gonna work, Weathers. Not like that.
get back there and do it again.
lt's all right, Weathers. Pick it up.
come on, let's go! Let's go, Weathers!
keep your head up and run through me.
get up and do it again! Are you kiddin' me? Get back! Do it again!
now, dip your shoulder, keep your head up and run through me!
do it again! We're gonna stay out here all day if it kills us, Weathers!
you are gonna put me on my ass!
now, keep your head up. Accelerate.
put your shoulder down and run through me!
what are you lookin' at? Don't look at them. They ain't gonna help ya out here, Willie.
ya got no homeboys, ya got no help!
ya damn sure ain't got no gun! And ya can't run away!
ya got nobody but yourself, but, god damn it, that's all you need.
believe in yourself and knock me on my ass!
all right, all right, all right, all right.
you know you're a idiot, right?
well, l'm makin' progress. 'Cause l used to be an asshole.
come on.
all right, listen up.
we've got to run this punt all the way back. You can do this.
now get out there, do it together, work as one and go make it happen!
let's go!
kick return! Let's win it!
lions lead by one with 15 seconds to go in the game.
Willie, let's go!
come on, Willie.
come on, Willie! Go!
Yeah, that's what l'm talkin' about, baby!
Oh! Y'all messed my arm up!
Hey! Hey! Come here.
Oh, it's my shoulder, Coach.
hold up!
C'mere, lemme see.
that's it! That's it! That's it!
bout time for practice, isn't it?
l gotta miss today. Goin' to the hospital.
how's she doin'?
not that good. They don't give her long.
Sean, if you wanna take some time off, you know...
she won't let me.
Hey, shouldn't the team be out there?
Yeah.
he's on his way.
how come you guys aren't out there?
lt's for your mom, Coach.
we all signed the card.
Yeah, tell her she needs to get better so she can come see us, Coach.
that's right, man.
for real.
Thanks.
you guys get out there and practice.
Hey, Coach.
my next touchdown's gonna be for your mom.
all right, y'all, bring it in. Come on. One, two, three.
porter!
l see Kenny.
and where's Willie? -Right here.
they're some good boys. -Yeah. They are.
ya know, what's crazy, Mom, is next year l'll have a whole new group.
that's a long way away.
l'm so proud of you.
your father would be proud of you too. -Mom.
he tried, Sean.
he tried.
you're so darn stubborn.
l know.
guess if it wasn't for bein' stubborn, there wouldn't be no football team.
you know my greatest accomplishment?
l raised a good man.
a couple hours later, she was gone.
that game today was just like a dream.
l stood on those sidelines thinkin' about her and all the games she watched me play.
all the times she bandaged my cuts, got me ice packs.
she washed my stuff.
she cheered me on.
she cheered me up.
l just felt so bad for all those kids who never knew that type of mother.
what about your dad?
l don't talk about him.
l'm glad to hear that things are getting better, Mom.
maybe when l get out we can live together again.
football is great. And l'm good at it now.
l love sackin' the quarterback.
sometimes l can't even believe it's legal.
throwin TD's don't pay as much as slingin' rocks, but damn, it feel good.
grandma, you'd be proud of me. l'm stayin' outta trouble.
l don't have enemies here anymore.
we done won seven in a row now.
l can't remember the exact number of touchdowns l scored.
l think about 60.
dear Danyelle, l wish you would write back to me.
l'm different than l was.
l think you would like me again if you saw me play football.
how ya doin'?
doin' great, sir. How can l help you?
l've got a letter for a Danyelle Rollins. -Well, who from?
Willie Weathers.
and who are you? -His football coach.
lsn't that kid in jail? -Yeah, he is.
we've got a team now. And Willie's a hell of a player.
he's also a hell of a young man.
l just don't understand how you could read his letters and not write him back.
l never got any letters.
look, mister, my baby's going to college. She's gettin' outta this place.
daddy, you kept his letters from me?
and if she's going to fulfill her potential, there's no room in her life for some gang member.
ya understand that? -Absolutely.
that's not who Willie is anymore.
with a little bit of support, maybe he'll stay that way.
l'm glad to hear it.
but l'm not willing to bet my daughter's future on it.
l understand. Thank you.
thank you. Enjoy your visit.
who ya here for? -Willie Weathers. l'm his brother.
you're awful big for a six-year-old. -Say what?
says here Willie has one brother, six years old.
that's wrong, 'cause l'm here, ain't l? -Yeah. Yes, you are.
but you ain't gettin' in.
come on, man, l'm all he's got.
sorry. Now, you have a nice day.
bitch.
l'll catch you on the rebound, homey!
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a new addition to the Mustang team.
Mustang Cheerleaders from Camp Scott, California.
camp Scott, that's that girls' prison.
that's my girl Cherise! She's so hot, man.
who? The one on the end there?
go Mustangs!
Nah. Come on, now, the one in the middle.
hot like the summer.
the one in the middle!
Hey, hey! All right, eyes front!
Hey, turn around! Turn around!
and at the end of the two-minute warning, the Mustangs lead 17-14.
Drac! Yo, Drac!
do your thing, boy! Drac!
show these niggas what you can do! -What up, baby!
Willie! Get goin'. Let's go! Focus!
green 18. Hut!
Yeah, baby!
touchdown, number 13, Willie Weathers for the Mustangs.
that's what l'm talkin' about!
88, baby! -l'm gonna represent, baby!
Hut!
and that's the game, Mustangs 21, Eagles 7.
Mustangs! We're goin' to the playoffs!
good game.
good game, good game. Y'all did y'all thing.
good job, good job. Wassup?
congratulate on the 88. -8-8!
88 for life, homey.
what up, 95?
get up off of me, bitch! -What up?
you be payin' for that, nigga!
you a bluff! You ain't got nothin', fool! -Don't let me catch you in the street.
l be like this! l know that! Take that, nigga!
Kelvin!
go to sleep. Go to sleep!
free!
any news? -No, he's still in surgery.
Sean, they're makin' us forfeit the playoff game.
season's over.
l told those kids that no matter what happened, they'd be winners.
Hey, man, you did your best.
we all did our best, l guess.
what do we tell 'em now? -That's what l don't know.
all right, gentlemen, line it up.
come on, move! We've done this before. Let's go!
a line here. A line here. A line here.
l heard about you. You buster! Got your boy Free killed.
l'll kill you! -Get off me!
l'll kill all you bitches!
l'm 88! 88 for life! -lt's Willie. Come on, man!
did you hear me! 88 for life, bitch!
he goin' crazy! -l'm a 88! 88! 88, man!
get 'im off me!
screw this bitch-ass football team!
you're goin' to the box, Willie. -l don't give a shit!
get 'im outta here!
and l don't need this football team shit!
l just got back from the hospital. Kelvin's gonna be okay.
better for me if the nigga was dead.
ya think so? l really don't think it matters 'cause you're screwed either way, Willie. Your homeys know what you did yesterday.
so you go back to the hood, they're gonna put a bullet in your head, 'cause they think you're not down for the set anymore.
no matter what you say now.
you know what? l think they're right.
man!
you better be good to me, asshole, 'cause l'm all you got!
man, fuck you! -Who else cares about you?
l don't need nobody else!
you don't give a shit about me or anybody else!
man, that's right!
then why'd you try and save Kelvin yesterday?
huh? Answer me that!
why'd you side with the enemy over your own homeboy!
man, 'cause-a you! And this damn football team, man!
that's bullshit! You made a choice!
no, l didn't!
l ain't even know what was happenin' to me! lt was just so...
everything so quick!
l don't know what's happenin' to me, man.
l do.
you're not the loser you were when you first got here, Willie.
you're just not used to bein' a winner.
my father said l was a waste of his time and his money.
your father was a loser, Willie.
my old man was the same way.
he spent so much time tellin' me l was no good, tellin' me l was nothin', l believed him.
that why you so pissed off all the time?
Yeah, that's probably got somethin' to do with it.
l know how you feel, Willie.
you get to the point where you expect to screw up. You expect to fail.
lf we wanna win, we gotta let 'em go.
forgive 'em and move on.
forgive 'em? -Forgive 'em.
otherwise we give 'em too much power over us.
and they don't deserve it.
well, how long it take you to forgive your dad?
till just now.
till just now.
Kelvin's gonna be okay?
Yeah.
whole football team's done, though, huh?
maybe not.
after our game, Willie Weathers tried to save Kelvin Owens 'cause he didn't see him as an enemy, he saw him as a teammate.
everybody wants to talk about us winning eight games in a row and how great that is.
that's nothing compared to breaking the power that gangs have over these kids.
lf you cancel this game, we're givin' that power back to them.
l admire what you're tryin' to do, Coach, l really do.
but how can l ask our parents to expose their kids to potential violence?
Yeah, you see, our problem is, while you didn't cause the shooting you couldn't prevent it either.
what if we could?
what if we could guarantee it won't happen again?
well, what you see behind us here is a force of volunteers from the Department of Probation, the LAPD and the Sheriff's Department.
the County Board of Supervisors firmly believes we can't allow gangs to dictate the terms by which our young people live.
M-U-S-T-A-N-G!
well, l know they had their uniforms donated, but where did they get those moves?
they're Mustangs, Coach. They accepted the challenge.
relax, guys. What're you worried about? That they beat ya 30-nothin' last time?
38 to nothin'.
they didn't beat you. They beat a team that never played before.
but on this day it's gonna be different.
on this day, you're gonna have Mustang pride.
you're gonna go out there, you're gonna put your helmets on, buckle your chinstrap, and hand out 38 ass-whoopin's!
you understand? Mustang pride!
let's go, Mustangs!
Hi, Dad!
go Mustangs!
Kenny! -Mom!
l made it!
Willie! Willie!
captains, let's go out for the coin toss.
that's a psych-job. Sending out eight guys to a damn coin toss.
psych 'em right back.
let's go, Willie!
little flag. -We've got a clipped ball -on the receiving team. -Flag on the play. No touchdown.
you gotta be kidding me! -Clipping on the receiving team!
that was a fair hit!
clipping on number 88, Kenny Bates.
Bates! Bates! C'mere!
don't worry about it, we'll get it back, all right? You hear me?
take it easy on the ref, he knows he made a horrible call.
that's okay.
offense, let's go! -Kenny, it's okay!
come on, Mustangs!

Barrington recovers the ball on the Mustangs' 40-yard line.
leon's intimidated.
he's too worried about throwin' another interception.
Yeah.
first down, Barrington Panthers.
come on, defense, let's go! Get out there!
Leon! C'mere. Look at me. You're a great quarterback.
believe in your teammates and believe in yourself. You understand?
let me see you smile. Come on.
Attaboy.
blue 15! Hut!
Perez!
come on, man!
touchdown, Barrington. Number 3, David Smith.
l smoked that!
halftime!
we got a whole half to play. We got a whole half of football left.
come on, guys.
hold your head up, come on!
Sean, you gotta get 'em ready for the second half.
they're ready. -What?
just wait.
they're ready.
man, those fools are whippin' our ass.
for real, man.
shit.
they ain't that good, man.
we're better.
and it means much more to us. You know?
when this all started, man,
coach, he said we'd be winners.
l thought he was full of shit, man.
l hated y'all.
didn't want no part of it.
but then we made a team.
we showed people somethin'.
coach is right.
we changed.
we're not losers no more.
all we gotta do is go out there and show it one more time.
you know what l'm sayin'?
let's get out there and kick some ass!
break! -Let's go!
ln the third quarter the score remains Barrington Panthers 14,
Kilpatrick Mustangs 0.
let's go!
boom!
that's what l'm talkin' about! Let's go!
man.
Damn! Damn, that white boy be killin' us!
Woo! l'm back, nigger!
Stevens, come on, man.
don't go nowhere, dawg, l'll be right back.
huddle up.
let's get back in the game, baby. On one.
let's make it a 625 swing. -Coach called a flood.
you can call a audible if you see an opening, right?
look, l got an opening.

that's not the right formation. What the hell are they doin'?
Leon! Leon, what're you doin'?

Yeah, baby!
that was number 13, Willie Weathers. Touchdown for the Mustangs.
that's what l'm talkin' about!
Woo! You all right, nigga?
great job! Great job!
fourth quarter, Barrington's ball on the Mustang's two-yard line and we have one minute of play remaining.
you stop 'em now, we got a chance.
unless they score again, then it'll be all over, man.
man, shut up, Bug!
shut the hell up, Bug.
left! He's throwin' left!
blue 16! Hut!

all right! Go offense!
fumble recovery, number 5, Miguel Perez.
the Mustangs have possession with the score 14 to 10,
and 50 seconds remaining.
coach, l'm goin' deep.
ya think? -Yes.
Leon. Bates. Feel like catchin' a ball, Bates?
coach, the deep pass always goes to Perez.
everybody knows that, including Barrington.
coach, l don't wanna... -Hey, it's only a game, Kenny.
you just get out there and give it your best shot. Catch the ball.
let's go. Get out there. Come on.
let's go, Hayes.
we got the ball back, let's go!

with the ball on the 20-yard line, the score is 14-10.
come here. All right. We got time for one play.

Touchdown! Let's go!

no, you ain't! No, you ain't!
no, you ain't!
touchdown, number 13, Willie Weathers.
you're the best!
Hey. C'mere!
Mustangs, baby!
we played the championship game the next week.
we lost 17-14. But we played a helluva game.
and no one called us losers.
l told 'em, far as l was concerned, they were champs.
since then all the kids have been released.
24 are goin' to school. Three are working full-time jobs.
and only five are back in jail.
that's a lot better than the average failure rate of 75 percent.
after his release, Junior Palaita got a job working for a furniture company and lives with his family.
Kelvin Owens recovered from his bullet wound.
he's gonna play for Washington High next season.
Miguel Perez and Donald Madlock went back to their old gangs and are now in California Youth Authority prisons.
Kenny Bates is goin' to school in Redondo Beach and living with his mom.
leon Hayes is trying to resist the crack dealer's lifestyle.
he's gonna play football for Dorsey High this year.
bug Wendal was killed in a drive-by shooting in Compton.
Willie Weathers got a full scholarship to play football for a top boarding school.
a school that's a long way from 88th Street.
and how'd things change for me?
not a whole lot.
on the gridiron we do it my way. Not your way, my way.
right now you're all losers.
that's why you're in here. 'Cause ya lost.
but if you accept this challenge, if you accept the Mustang challenge, then come this December, when it's all over with, l promise you you'll be winners.
ready?
M-U-S...
a!
A-N-G-S!
Mustangs!
you don't know how to spell " Mustangs " ? you have got to be shitting me!
all right.
here we go again.
M-U-S-T-A-N-G.
tell me to shoot somebody, l'll shoot 'em.
they would have killed me if l wouldn't-a killed them first.
l played football in high school and college and most of my life.
you know, l had people work with me as a kid and they made a difference in my life, and l was just hopin' to pass that on to somebody else.
the Kilpatrick sports program is three-pronged.
the dorm, where you're at now.
you've gotta learn to get along with people from different neighborhoods, different backgrounds. And school.
apply yourself, learn, become a better student.
on the field, you do it my way. Not your way.
your way got you here.
you played a game, sellin' drugs, robbin' people, rippin' people off, and you lost. Right now you're a loser.
mustangs are winners.
why'd you take 'em off?
good job, man.
where you goin'? -l'm goin' to put my shorts on.
why'd you even come out with 'em off? Why'd you even walk off the field?
you quitting again? You know your program.
your program is you run, you get in shape, and you get a uniform.
you just keep walkin'. Football team's here. You wanna be part of it, we're here.
but you bring a heart with you next time.
l'm tired of bein' a loser.
out there on the field, l can just show 'em that l'm somebody.
show 'em that l can play.
this program has helped me get a relationship back with my mom.
l want her to hold me and tell me she loves me.
lt's up to you to accept the challenge.
lf anyone tells you it's gonna be easy, they're lyin' to you.
l'm gonna push you. l'm gonna challenge you.
put your helmets on and go shake their hands.
but l still don't believe that they're 26 points better than you.
l still think you're the better team. l still would not trade you for them.
these kids, the anxiety's weighing them down, it's holdin' 'em back.
lt's almost a fear of the unknown.
lt's gonna be a whole new experience for 'em.
we wanted to thank you for not giving up on us, even though we didn't want to put out the effort at times.
thank you for teaching us more than football.
you taught us about the game of life.
this ball, l wanna give it to our head coach,
Sean Porter.
when they came in here a lot of people thought of them as criminals and delinquents.
no way.
you did a great job.
you're a helluva group of young men.
sounds like...
tiny hammers.
let's go skating!
they're coming right at us! -- Take us to Elfcon three!
take us to Elfcon three.
these guys aren't stopping.

I lost it! -- What do you mean?

sir, you're gonna want to hear this.
you better not cry
you better not pout and I'm telling you why

Santa, I've got her on the locator.
he knows when you are sleeping
he knows when you're awake
he knows if you've been bad or good
so be good for goodness'...
# You better watch out # You better not cry
you better not pout
and I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to tow-...
what now? -- It's just gone.
in the middle of the chorus!
nobody needs to know about this.
maybe we should mention the Smokey Robinson thing, sir.
we're at Elfcon four. All clear.
Curtis, what do you say we get you headphones this Christmas?
it's all right, everybody. Back to work.
Curtis, you're 900 years old. Grow up!
Bernard.
you know I didn't break any of the rules according to The Santa Handbook.
the handbook! Curtis, do you go pee-pee with that thing?
it says elves are encouraged to listen to music.
look out!
it's OK. -- Let's go!
is he all right?
Wow! That's gonna leave a mark.
is that Blitzen? Looks like Prancer.
who is that? -- It was Chet.
a reindeer in training.
well, please tell me that it's early in his training.
nice fall.
when are you gonna tell him? -- Not now!
it's cold up here. How can you not be freezing?
you have not seen cold till you see where my dad lives. It's...
don't be embarrassed. My parents are divorced.
no big deal. -- I'm not embarrassed.
why don't you talk about your dad? -- He doesn't like me to.
it's complicated. -- Is he a spy?
no, he...
he works with toys and these...Iittle people. Kids.
can we just do what we came here to do?
sure.
all right.
Charlie, this is really dangerous.
someone could catch us at any moment.
kinda exciting.
well, you know, Danielle, I may not come out of this alive.
so, in case we don't see each other again...
Aagghh!
are you OK?
Oof!
almost done. -- OK. I'm not leaving.
# I've been a naughty boy # I didn't get a toy # Santa Claus left nothing underneath my tree # He knows that I've been bad # But being good just ain't my bag...
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, Principal Newman.
OK, try it now.
OK, all right. Here's what we need.
get one more bolt on that flange and it's ready for Christmas.
good work, guys. Whew!
perfect job on suspension, you guys.
thinking outside the box. I love it.
do you want a cookie, Santa? -- Do I want a cookie?
Yes! What's fresh?
sweet, just like you.
Alexander, let's think.
take the hat off.
too much counterweight.
Thanks, Santa. You're the man.
that's why they give me the big belly, so I don't fall over!
Hey, Joey! How's that static-free-tinsel coming?
Hey, guys, Santa wants to see the new tinsel.
I could come up there and take care of this the ugly way.
or... we go outside and play some football.
Curtis, you need to tell him right now!
I don't know. He's so happy right now.
why do I have to be the one to tell him?!
because I'm the head elf. I don't give bad news.
it's one of the perks of my seniority.
now, tell him!
come on, pork chop. Bring it on.
who you calling pork chop, meatloaf?
Meatloaf?!
you wanna talk some trash? I'll talk trash with ya.
but first, I'm gonna blitz. -- Ready, set!
I'm coming after you, buddy. -- Seven swans are swimming!
six geese are laying!
five golden rings!
Hike!
who's got the ball? I can see it. Let go of me.
he's too quick! He spins! He moves! He's on the way!
and he might go all the...
way!
rumbling, stumbling, bumbling!
Oh, they pile on!
OK, you win!
you guys aren't elves. You're wizards!
no matter how many times you run that play I never see it coming.
Santa? We need to talk.
that's weird, isn't it?
these fit yesterday. -- Hot cocoa for you.
this is not a good time, Abby.
I sent Dasher down for some Brazilian cocoa beans.
what's the bad news? -- What do you mean?
whenever you play the designer bean card, you have bad news.
what you doing with the naughty-and-nice list?
just don't shoot the messenger.
it's... Charlie. - Sheen?
I thought he straightened out. -- Not that Charlie.
my Charlie. My son Charlie? He's on the naughty list?
there's gotta be a mistake. -- We don't make mistakes.
I'm sorry, Santa. Please excuse me.
how could this happen? Is this what you were trying to tell me?
great! You told him! Let's get you dressed for that meeting.
I can't have the meeting here. I'm gonna have to see Charlie.
number two, tell him now. -- Tell me what, guys? Come clean.
Santa, there's a Clause. -- That would be me.
no, I mean there's another Santa clause.
in case you haven't noticed - this time of year, the malls are filled with other "Santa Clauses."
Yes, but there's another Santa Clause.
there was a first Clause, and a second Clause.
get on with it!
when the last Santa fell off your roof and you put on his coat, you found this.
right. Who wears the coat takes on the responsibilities of Santa Claus.
and the rest would be history, right?
but it seems our number two elf, the keeper of the handbook, overlooked the single most important detail in the history of Christmas!
Wow! One mistake in 900 years.
look.
I can't see that. -- Better now?
or now? -- Well...
better now? -- It's getting there.
or now? - I can't see anything.
I see. Good, good, good. I see it. OK.
the card holder acknowledges a woman of his choosing...
true love... Not valid in the state of Utah...
holy...
matrimony?!
I gotta get married! -- Yes.
it's... the Mrs Clause.
what if I don't want to get married?
Oh, dear. The de-Santification process has begun!
the de-Santification?
are you telling me that clause says if I don't get married...
I don't get to be Santa any more?
Wh-... what about the kids?
what about the elves?
what about you guys? -- It's not completely hopeless.
you still have time to find a wife.
how much time do I have? -- 28 days.
28 days? So I've gotta... find a wife by Christmas.
actually, Christmas Eve.
I guess it's over. -- No! You can't think that way!
please, don't give up hope.
cos if you do, then we have to.
Christmas is getting very complicated.
Santa?
Santa?
are you with us? - I'm sorry, yes. Yes, I am.
well, on behalf of Father Time and the Council of Legendary Figures,
I'd like to thank you for being such a gracious host.
hear, hear. -- What a lovely place.
without further ado, let us convene the year-end conference.
tooth Fairy. -- Thank you, Mother Nature.
fellow Council members,
I'd like to again propose a new name for myself.
Oh, please! - Good heavens!
in the past, you have rejected Tooth Man, Tooth Guy and Tooth.
because they stunk. -- Today, I'd like to submit...
captain Floss. -- Nice!
plaque Man. And Roy. -- Roy! No.
no kid's gonna put a tooth under a pillow for a man named Roy.
this from someone in a diaper who shoots people's butts!
wait a minute. I got it. I got it. I got it.
now, how about this? The Molarnator.
the Molarnator! I like it.
thank you, Santa. Can we vote now on the Molarnator?
all in favour of a name change for Tooth Fairy?
all right. And all opposed?
Easter Bunny?
sandman? -- Wha-...?
what happened? Was I asleep again?
name change for the Tooth Fairy. Yes or no?
no. I'm sorry.
all right. Next item on the agenda. Santa? Status report.
OK. First, welcome to the North Pole. Great to have you here.
this is our big time of year, so things are busy as usual.
there's a little speed bump in the road this year.
you all know Charlie. -- I love Charlie!
great kid. -- Good boy.
sweet kid. -- Good teeth.
well, Charlie... got himself on the naughty list.
What?! -- Oh, my!
I'm struggling with the timing, cause it's...
I gotta be up here and I've also got to take care of Charlie...
that's every parent's dilemma: how to balance work and children.
most people lose sleep over that.
tell me about it! I have 33, 000 offspring. All in private school.
well, to top it off... I have to get married by Christmas Eve.
What?! --Otherwise I stop being Santa.
What?! -- No!
the de-Santification process has already begun.
wait a minute.
you do look thinner, and...
your beard is shorter! Right? -- You're right!
apparently, it's called the Mrs Clause.
don't mess with me, Santa. I'm pre-El Ni'no.
no, I'm not messing with anybody. What I'm saying is...
I have to find a wife in...
27 days, 20 hours and 17 minutes.
it's what I do.
wait a minute. Cupid! Cupid, come over here.
what do you need? -- Shoot me with a dart.
then I'll fall in love. -- First of all, they're arrows.
second of all, no can do.
why not? -- Arrows have no effect on us.
if they did, I would have shot myself, met a nice girl, Ieft the business years ago.
enough with the questions. - You can't stop being Santa.
I don't want to.
kids are 86 percent happier since you've taken the job.
he's right. -- This is all I want to do.
but what am I gonna do?
well, you...
you can't be two places at once.
maybe you can be.
OK, everyone, can I get the room for a minute? Thank you.
can I just...? One minute. Take a cocoa break.
have a nice long break. Relax, everyone.
I want to show Santa some improvements on the pantograph. Thanks.
walk with me. I've tripled the RAM and reconfigured the circuitry.
I see you've externalised the power source to make better use of the electromagnetic energy.
no, it's just there cos it looks really cool.
Yeah, it does.
wait a minute. You tripled the RAM.
I see where this is going. I am not getting in that machine.
besides, creating a copy of Santa won't solve our problems.
the elves will know. -- But this would be a special toy!
how's that, Curtis? -- I added a fuzzy logic circuit.
the duplicate will look and think just like you.
when you're with your family, dealing with Charlie, looking for a wife...
the toy will be up here melting in front of my fireplace.
no, the toy Santa will be dealing with business up here.
I can deal with business up here.
Santa, if the elves find out we've made a switch...
No! No! This machine is not the answer.
you! Shoo!
look, you can't get much better than that.
and I promise - it won't hurt a bit.
I'm going in. -- I can't watch this!
it's perfect!
that's because it's me, Einstein.
are you all right? -- Yeah, I got a shock in there.
is there supposed to be a shock?
it's naked!
throw something over it.
it's incredible! -- Yes, it is.
can he talk?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
not bad. -- Not bad yourself.
I can't put my finger on it, but there's something about you I like.
there's something about you that I like!
watch him. I'll be right back. -- He's coming right back.
Bernard, I needs your help. -- What do you mean?
I mean I gotta go see Charlie and I want you to convince the elves...
that... toy Santa is me.
hm. Have you seen that thing? - I've seen it.
keep the elves at a distance and tell them...that I've changed my look, it'll work.
Santa, we're in way over our heads here.
if anybody can do this, it's you, number one.
I... I'm not gonna lie to all the elves.
I myself think he looks absolutely terrific!
better and fresher somehow than he has in years.
there's now a more supple veneer to his skin and an added lustre to the thickness of his hair.
you could almost say there's a...a toy-like quality to him.
most importantly, he's very happy with his new look, and I would caution you all not to point or stare or use the word "plastic."
OK? OK.
thank you. That's all. Back to work, please.
comet, because I don't want to take Prancer.
I want to take a trip with you. When's the last time we had a cruise?
I love you, buddy.
besides, Prancer had too many apples. We know what that means.
before you go, take a look at your watch.
Hey! Can't go anywhere without that.
I've done some work on it. -- It's beautiful. It really is.
you like it? -- The workmanship's fabulous.
it has a power reserve that measures how much magic you have left.
it's at ten. -- That should be enough.
but if you use up any magic for any reason the level drops.
Santa, if it gets to zero - you won't be able to return to the Pole.
then let's not let it get to zero!
now, look at me. -- Mm-hm?
what's the most important thing?
for you not to touch Santa?
for you to come back!
thank you.
comet, please just chill out a little bit, OK?
come on! It's not like we're pullin' the sleigh. Right?
there's no packages. It's one spot.
and I think I might have forgot we're gonna go see Charlie.
Scott! Hey! You trimmed your beard.
Yeah.
come here, big guy.
lost some weight there.
Slim-Fast? -- You don't know how fast.
we should get going. -- Oh, OK.
how do you always know when there's a problem?
I see you when you're sleeping. I know when you're awake.
which is a frightening concept when you think about it.
we're really worried about Charlie.
he keeps upping the ante. This time he defaced school property.
it's classic acting out. -- I'm blaming myself for this.
we're both his parents. -- Where is he?
he's waiting for us in Principal Newman's office.
something about her makes me want to deface public property.
Hello, Mr Calvin. Laura, Neil.
miss Newman. -- Principal Newman.
haven't seen you since the last time Charlie was in trouble.
I've been travelling for work.
if you spent more time with your son there'd be fewer problems.
then I wouldn't spend so much time with you, which is always such a pleasure.
a battle of wits. It's a shame you come unarmed. Excuse me.
Ouch!
good morning, Principal Newman.
mr Picardo, I want you to look into my eyes. What do you see?
it's dark. And it's cold.
it's your future, Mr Picardo - keep this up and you will spend your life stabbing trash.
do I make myself clear? -- Yes.
so what are you gonna do? -- I'm going to geometry.
have a nice trip.
it's an affront to authority and blatant disrespect for property.
if this continues I'll have no other recourse than suspend...
excuse me. Is there a rest stop between here and the end of the lecture?
I'm interested in why this happened in the first place.
so am l. Charlie, we're all worried about you.
it feels like you're trying to get someone's attention.
what's bothering you?
dr Miller? - Neil. -Neil - Neil, any theories? -- Well, frankly I have several.
here we go. Let's just order a pizza.
Scott, you're not helping.
I was listening to a tape series on child development last night.
you know what the problem is? Excuse me, Neil.
it's four weeks until Christmas.
that's a holiday in December. -- Oh.
have you noticed the hallways? Not a decoration, not a twinkle light, not an expression of the joy kids are supposed to be feeling.
what kind of school is this? -- A public school.
a top-rated public school. That takes effort. And money.
spending any of that money on holiday decorations would take away from the things that matter.
forgive me, but I think holiday cheer matters.
what are we going to do? We are worried...
let me handle this. You know what you did is wrong. Right?
I guess so. -- There's no guessing.
guessing is gone. It was wrong what you did.
and you're not gonna do it again. Promise me.
OK. -- There you go.
he won't do it again. Meeting is adjourned.
it most certainly is not! Charlie... Charlie...
you know what else? Here's a little donation.
why don't you buy yourself a wreath?
I am Santa Clause.
Yeah. No, no, I think that this is gonna work.
good... Good job, Curtis.
would it kill you to give a wholehearted compliment?
Santa?
I need you to look at this. -- All right!
nice!
no. I mean, I need you to read it.
well, let's try to be specific, shall we?
Ha-ha!
I'll take a look at it over at my desk.
how does he know where it is? -- I programmed him that way.
he has most of Santa's memories.
OK, we need you to study everything that's in that book because it is the key to being Santa.
right! I'll memorise everything in the book.
I'll follow all the rules.
I like this guy. -- I can barely read this.
Hi, Santa.
Hi. -- You look...
like he got a good night's sleep.
like you got a very good night's sleep.
how about a nice chocolatey cocoa?
careful, it's hot. -- Of course it is.
that's delicious! I like cocoa!
cocoa's superior refreshment!
get me some more cocoa!
right away, Santa.
I think Santa feels a little buzz!
let me get this straight. You were de-Santified?
and you only have 27 days to find a wife or you're out?
Yeah.
what are you gonna do? We dated for three years before you got up the courage to propose.
that's a pretty serious commitment issue, isn't it?
Yes, Sigmund. I was afraid I'd mess up the first time.
I'm more afraid now. -- You can't give up.
there's never been a better Santa.
I appreciate that.
it's for the best. If l had spent more time with you, you'd spend less time in the spray paint industry.
don't do that to yourself. You have been a great dad.
and being Santa has made you an even better man.
I'm gonna go out on an emotional limb.
don't try to make me cry.
believe it or not, you have a great capacity for love.
I know you can find someone wonderful to spend the rest of your life with.
don't let the facts that you have no time, no prospects and a paralysing fear of intimacy get you down.
hm.
have you ever helped anyone? Ever?
you know what I'm gonna do? I am gonna look through my phone book and see who's still single out there and not bitter.
there's divorced moms at school who'll go out with anybody.
as promising as this sounds, I don't need help with this area.
your old man was a high-school legend. A double letterman.
I had a Mustang.
so as far as dating goes,
I think if anybody can stir up the old mojo it would be moi.
come on! I don't think there's a woman out there that doesn't want a piece of this.
Hi, Mom! - Lucy! -Lucy - Uncle Scott! -- How's my little sweet pea?
Ohh! I haven't seen you in a long time.
tell me what's been happening. -- I learned to swim underwater.
and I'm not afraid! -- That's amazing!
maybe we'll have to go to the mall and... get some ice cream.
plenty of women at the mall. - Charlie...! -Charlie...!
Santa, look forward and put on a smiley face.
say hello to your elves.
you're doing a wonderful job!
Santa, when you said the bigger wheels, is this what you meant?
you're doing a wonderful job!
you're doing great. Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's, but otherwise you're gold.
why don't you just say it? "You were right, Curtis. I was wrong."
OK, I admit it.
they're happy. They're working hard.
everything's going to be fine.
this book is very interesting reading.
there's a lot of rules they're not following.
that's what I've been saying all along.
things have gotten a little too sloppy around here.
Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes. Mistakes aren't a good thing!
I might have to make some changes here.
what do you have in mind? -- Let me show you.
there's many things. Look here...
Neil, are you sure you don't have any other clothes I can borrow?
the idea tonight is to attract a woman.
what are you talking about? -- I look like a limesicle.
I think it makes you look hot.
what do you think, Laura? Honestly, what do you think?
doesn't he look hot, Laura?
I think it's what's inside that really counts.
thought you liked the sweater. -- We'll talk later.
I'm off. I may need to borrow a car.
I'm parked behind Neil. The minivan - I just had it washed.
the minivan.
OK, then. Well, wish me luck.
I got a needlepoint sweater, and a minivan...
see ya in about eight minutes.
Scott? Hey.
Tracy! -- Yes!
it's nice to meet you. -- Nice to meet you.
here, why don't you sit down? -- Oh, thank you.
thank you very much.
so, I'm so glad we finally got to do this.
I'm pretty nervous. --Oh, are you?
Laura says we have a lot in common.
I hear that you love this time of year also?
it's my favourite time of year and busiest time of year.
whoa, look at the sweater! -- Yeah!
some sweater. Like I should talk!
I also have my Christmas charm bracelet.
that's beautiful. Look at them! -- Yeah.
I wear it all year just to keep the spirit alive.
that's gorgeous. A little teddy bear and packages. That's very nice.
so what work do you do? -- I'm in the toy business.
no way! -- Way!
that sounds so creative. -- I love it.
I love creative people. -- Yeah?
Yeah.
so what do you do?
I'm hoping someday to break into the music business.
as a singer-songwriter. -- No way!
way!
what's your favourite music? -- Country-western.
Yeah.
do you like Shania Twain? -- Yeah!
# The best thing about singing at Christmas # Is the cocoa, carolling and fun - You know that one? -- I know that song.
# Go totally yuletide - # Takin' a sleigh ride - You're good.
# Santa shirts, reindeer skirts # Watchin' the windows fog, drinkin' some eggnog -- That's good. - # Whoah-oh-oh!
# Fill up a stocking # Spray on some flocking
put up a tree! Sports on TV!
# I want to be free, yeah to feel the way I feel
man!
# I feel like some Christmas
you hated it?
it kind of scared me a little bit.
no, I just. I...
I just... I wasn't prepared for a performance, so if l...
I put myself out and that was not an easy thing to do.
if you can't support a woman's ambition, then I don't think there's any reason to continue this date.
dad? -- Hey, sport.
how'd it go?
well...
let's just say I'm not booking a church yet.
boy, I'll tell ya, women are hard to figure out.
tell me about it. -- You too, huh? Girl trouble?
well, there's this one girl.
we just used to be friends and hang out at the mall and stuff.
then one day I looked at her and I got this weird feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I started worrying about what to wear and what my hair looked like...
and then I wanted to kiss her.
how did she do that?
I don't know. But they all can do that.
Oh, look at that. The snow globe!
this is so beautiful. I remember when Bernard gave this to you.
he said all I have to do to see you is shake it.
now, all you have to do is yell down the hall.
and I'm there whenever you need me.
Yeah.
I'm a little tired, Dad. I'll see you in the morning.
OK.
good night. -- Night.
can you turn the light off, please?
Yeah, cos it's such a big reach for you!
what do you mean it's not straight?
sure it's straight.
maybe your head's crooked.
Prancer's not this picky. -- Yes, he is.
Hi, Comet. -- Hi!
I've got something for you.
Hey, Lucy, what have you got there?
careful with the sweets. He tends to overeat.
uncle Scott, are you Santa Clause?
what? Why would you ask me something like that?
cos you have a reindeer, and only Santa has reindeer.
nonsense. A lot of people have reindeer.
name five.
well... most of them live in Finland.
I can't pronounce their names.
besides, reindeer are too stupid to make good pets.
well, I think you're very smart.
well, I think he's learning at an excellent rate.
Oh, really? This morning he ate a bowl of waxed fruit.
wait a minute.
I need the naughty-and-nice list.
no.
it says I'm supposed to check it twice.
Santa already checked it. -- No, I didn't.
the real Santa. -- I am the real Santa!
I'm sorry? -- I'm in charge here.
what? -- I check the list twice.
that's the rule. I like the rules.
you know how I feel. -- You're misunderstanding.
no, I'm the rule-maker. I like the rules. Santa likes rules.
I've got a good idea. How about we have some fun?
huh?
it's good to have fun. --Right.
Santa, look over there. See those elves?
go ahead. Go play some tinsel football.
break!
what's the object of tinsel football? -- Come on down.
if you don't have the ball, get it.
if you have the ball, run to the end zone.
OK, I'll go get the football.
ready, hike!
I've got the ball. What are you gonna do? Who's gonna stop me?
come on!
this is a lot of fun!
Oh, so sorry!
come here! Stop! Slow down when I'm talking to you!
come here, you! Come on.
he's headed east toward the main entrance!
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, Principal Newman.
are Laura and Neil on their way?
no, I volunteered to go solo.
Oh. You look...
you've lost weight. Feeling all right?
I was until I got this phone call.
Charlie, you promised you weren't gonna do this again.
what's the matter with you? I'm gonna have to punish ya.
I'll ground him for... two months.
I thought you were on my side! -- I'll go one better.
you're suspended. -- But... Dad!
I'm as upset about this as you, but isn't there a punishment that doesn't mean taking him out of school?
what did you have in mind? -- We could...
community service?
that's not a bad idea.
OK, Charlie. I want you to start by cleaning up this wall.
I want everything off of there by tonight.
and then clean off every mark off every locker in this hallway.
every one?! -- Do as she says, Charlie.
but I have homework, tests to study for.
not my problem. I have a detention group on Saturday.
so we will all get together at the rec centre and scrape off graffiti at 8 a.m.
see you both there. --You say both of us?
no, l... I'm very busy. I do a lot of other community service.
that's good. You just got yourself elected parent rep.
and, Charlie... We'll talk about the suspension.
Curtis, what is he doing in the naughty-and-nice centre?
what's going on? -- I'm checking the naughty-nice list.
I'm checking it twice. -- I already told you!
it's been checked. Don't worry.
I do worry. There's a lot of mistakes.
I'll give you a big fat for instance!
in Denmark, there's a guy named Sven Halstrom right here.
he's a Dane. He was wiping his nose on his sister's shirt.
Yuk! That's not very nice! And yet he's on the nice list.
we try to cut most children slack this time of year.
I don't understand that! Kids are misbehaving everywhere.
they're running with scissors. They're sticky.
I'm not gonna stop this car! We're not there yet!
brush your teeth! Pick up those clothes!
it goes on and on.
but they're just kids! Everybody misbehaves some time.
but according to The Santa Handbook, naughty kids get lumps of coal in their stockings. Right?
we will make stockings.
in my opinion, they should all get coal in their stockings.
don't you? -- No! That's not how it works!
get me the naughty-nice list. Get me every list!
get me... everything.
mr O'Reilly, Mr Leary.
you in charge of the gangbangers?
they're students, actually, and yes.
keep them away from the car. It's new.
I don't need some delinquent kids scratching it up.
they're not delinquents. And don't worry about your car.
I'd worry about your legs in those shorts.
I thought only swimmers shaved their legs!
whoa, good one!
good morning. -- Good morning.
brought you coffee. -- Thank you.
so you have a nice-guy side. -- I'm a man of many sides.
I'm a puzzle. I'm a Rubik's Cube with pants.
a laugh! Actual laugh.
dad, it doesn't come off. -- It's not supposed to come off.
hence you've got to be careful where you put it.
hence tagging is serious. Hence your presence here.
don't say "hence" any more, Dad. It's really annoying.
nicely done!
how do you do it? I have trouble with one. You have hundreds.
Hi. -- Hi.
I was really good this year.
is that so? Are you absolutely sure about that, Pamela? Pamela?
I want a doll house and a swimming pool.
a swimming pool?
I'm sorry. She insisted on talking to you.
it's not a problem. -- OK.
I'll tell you what. If you can promise me you'll be good,
I can guarantee you'll have a great Christmas.
OK! Yeah! - Come on.
kids get so nutty this time of year.
is she a neighbour? -- No.
Oh. How did you know her name?
Oh, the... necklace, it said Pamela on it.
Oh, I guess I missed that. I'm gonna go check on this group.
you cost me, Pamela.
I just couldn't sleep thinking about all those rules.
am I wrong? Am I right? Does it matter?
couldn't have been the three gallons of cocoa I had!
but you understand rules, don't you? You're highly decorated.
and look at that face. There you go.
there's a face only a mom would like.
I don't have a mom, so I wouldn't know about that.
now, it's time for the big event.
guess what?
son, it's show time!
you're in the spotlight. Get bigger with it.
it's your big chance. I need a little help.
I need a little muscle. I need a little nudge.
let's call yourself the little nudge!
this won't hurt - except for the electric shock through you.
see ya on the other side!
Hi. -- Hi.
it looks like you're going out.
sorry. I should have called. -- No, it's OK. Come in.
you sure?
is there a problem? -- No. I just...
I wondered if...
if you would...
do you want to go get some noodles?
or pie?
but I don't want to keep you from your date, so...
Oh, it's not a date. It's the faculty Christmas party.
is that your idea of a night on the town?
noodles and pie?
Yes. What would be your idea? -- Pizza and a movie.
thick or thin crust? -- Thin.
good! Movie?
two For The Road. Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney.
movie's OK, but the car was the star. '53 MGTD.
racing green, wire wheels... Beautiful.
I'm impressed. That is a great car. My favourite car.
didn't like driving them in the rain.
you have to push it to start it. Other than that it's perfect.
it's perfect, though.
I could drive you to your party. -- That would be great.
except for, eventually, I'm going to have to get home.
well, l... I could pick you up.
so you're going to drop me off, then come back and pick me up?
Yeah. -- Why don't you just stay?
all right, I'll stay. -- I'll get my coat.
so, Mr Andretti, what are you driving?
you know... I think you're gonna like it.
mind if I ask you something personal?
please.
you look really different. --The weight.
it's lndian teas and it's a lot of salves and stuff. It's...
do you want some cocoa? -- Yes.
cocoa. You have thought of everything.
well, this time of year, l... I really shine.
Yeah, I can't wait till it's over, though.
streets are crowded, the malls are jammed, people max out their credit cards... It's noisy.
when did you become such a cynic?
Oh. I don't know.
I used to love Christmas, too.
it was the only day that my parents didn't fight.
Oh. -- Oh.
they were at each other all the time.
but on Christmas, they tried to make the holiday special.
my dad went through this charade so I'd believe in Santa Clause.
he put a cot by the fireplace so Santa could take a nap...
like he has time to take a nap!
consider the amount of gifts he would have to... deliver.
why would he nap? He would probably need some coffee.
Yeah. And there was cocoa and cookies.
and carrots for the reindeer.
that's a good gesture. The reindeer love carrots.
and the thought is important to them, too.
Yeah. And I'd wake up and the cocoa and cookies would be gone and the cot would be mussed and the carrots gnawed.
they swallow them. If they're fresh they'll eat them like that.
they love red bell peppers, too.
you know the stories. If you read...
and there would be incredible presents under the tree.
one year was a rocking horse, and I named it Harvey.
and the next year was a little red wagon, which I made a lemonade stand, which was great.
and the last year was...
it was just... a Baby Doll. She was pink and soft and beautiful.
beautiful? -- Yes.
I believed in Santa so much I'd get in fights at school with kids who tried to tell me that he didn't exist.
and one day I came home with a bloody nose.
that's when my parents decided to tell me to...grow up.
I was devastated, and...
good, Carol! This is great sleigh-riding conversation!
I'm a terrible sleigh conversation.-- It's fine conversation.
a person just wants something to believe in, you know?
Yes, I know. Yes, I know.
OK, we have cocoa.
we have a blanket. We have a horse-drawn sleigh.
the only thing that's...
what?
it's snowing.
as if by magic?
that's what I was gonna say, that it should be snowing!
I owe you one.
it's a great party.
look. That guy moved.
would you excuse me?
could I have your attention? Your attention, please!
there we go. Hi. I'm Scott Calvin and I just thought I'd step up here and...and say the word that we've all been longing to hear.
fire!
OK. What I think, folks, is that a lot of you have forgotten what the true spirit of Christmas is all about.
Mm?
if you're not willing to dance or laugh or flirt or risk the buffet, I don't think we have much choice.
so before the choir gets out here I say we rock this house with a secret Santa! Huh?
Carol - happy, happy Christmas!
I think they're just decorations for the carollers.
she's afraid these are decorations for the carolling.
I think Carol is right about the carolling!
I'm talking about the packages that are backstage.
there aren't any packages backstage.
there's none back there.
so I was mistaken when I saw this bag of gifts.
maybe I'm wrong, but it sure looks like a bag of gifts.
it's heavy like a bag of gifts.
look at this! What's in here?
it's very heavy.
John Pierce.
doesn't your mom call you JJ?
merry Christmas, JJ.
no way.
this is Toss Across!
I used to love this when I was a kid!
but I never told anybody.
where did...? Who did this?
grace Kim.
Yes, there you are! Merry Christmas.
thank you. -- Tom Astle.
me! Sorry, Gordon. -- Hey!
haven't changed a bit! -- Gee, thanks.
Lizzy Garcia. -- Here.
there. Merry Christmas. -- Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!
mint condition! This is incredible!
the Holly Hobbie Oven!
come on up and get the rest of your presents.
Marie? -- Here!
there she is. Katie. Jerry.
here! -- Cory. Cory?
here!
Carl, you need a net. -- Not me!
this is great.
Hey, party animal, you want to play?
I can't figure it out. -- It's beanbag tic-tac-toe.
no, I mean the secret Santa thing.
someone tracked down all those wonderful antique toys.
probably someone who knows his way around e-Bay.
Yeah. -- Yep.
it was you. I know it was you.
I just can't figure out... How did you do it?
sometimes you don't need to know all the answers.
speaking of which...
even the principal needs a Christmas gift.
merry Christmas.
come on, open it. Rip it open.
come on. We're not gonna save the paper.
it's Baby Doll.
come here.
did you call the office? --No.
did they call you? -- It's not like that.
did you investigate us? -- No, I wouldn't do that.
did you...? I told you about Baby Doll an hour ago, and...
did you send someone to...?
no. -- No.
well... I don't know how you did it.
it's like some kind of magic.
Yeah, sort of like some kind of magic.
and... and pretty much the last that I have.
what? Well, what...? You know what?
I don't want to know.
what you did in there tonight for everyone was wonderful.
thank you.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.
is that OK? --Yeah.
got this weird feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I'm not... real good at this.
where did that come from?
I don't know.
Hi! Merry Christmas!
can I have your attention?
stop the work, please. Everybody stop the work.
merry Christmas!
that's nice. I have a little announcement to make.
from this moment forward, we're not gonna make any more toys.
the children of the world don't deserve presents.
they're running rampant with naughtiness.
this Christmas we're gonna give those greedy kids exactly what they deserve.
a beautiful, high-quality yet low-sulphur variety of coal!
quiet!
we have to focus, all of us, on the goals ahead.
and just to make sure that that happens...
thank you, sweetie.
I... I hate to blow my own horn.
stay where you are! Don't be afraid!
back! Back!
I was up late, couldn't sleep.
milk wouldn't do it, cocoa is a little sweet, so I decided to make an army of toy soldiers.
they don't have a good sense of humour like me.
I would do what they ask you. Which is what I'm going to tell you!
don't listen to him! This guy's not Santa!
he's not Santa? -- He's a toy!
he has a rubber face and a plastic tushy!
trust me! Don't let him ruin Christmas!
thank you for those kind words, Bernard!
well, now that we all have an understanding, have a joyous and merry Christmas!
merry Christmas!
OK, ready? Go!
this is what I call community service!
here she comes. Duck down!
Hey!
attention you hooligans behind that snow bank!
you have snowballed the wrong house.
drop the snowballs, kick them away from the snow suits and keep the mittens where I can see them.
your dad is hanging with Principal Newman?
is he dating her? -- No.
go to your homes. Pelt the ones you love.
and a merry Christmas!
that is really gross, man. --Shut up.
there are things about me you should know. Personal things.
we don't need to rush things, Scott.
I think you need to know these things.
OK.
remember the mistletoe, how it just showed up?
Yes. -- And the sleigh.
how magical that was? --Yes.
secret Santa Claus?
that was me. -- Yeah?
I'm not this size much. I'm usually much bigger than this.
so am I sometimes.
I have a big white beard that's beautiful.
I don't. -- I work a long way from home.
when I get back home, I sleep for a long time.
see? OK. It's not so bad so far.
you work far away from home and you sleep a lot.
you've never been to prison and you don't wear socks with sandals.
well...
I'm Santa Claus.
what?
the suit, the red suit's real. The North Pole is a place.
there are elves. They make toys. They're beautiful and it's real.
I exist. -- That's not funny.
it's magical. -- Cut it out.
I'm telling the truth.
I told you something personal from my childhood and now you're making a joke out of it and it's not funny. It hurts.
I know how hard this is to believe, but connect the dots.
think what's happened. -- I know what's going on.
think about the little girl. -- You felt something for me.
now you're acting like a mental patient because you're scared.
I deliver gifts in a sleigh. -- lncredible.
I go down chimneys with burning logs and I still deliver gifts.
I'm not scared. That's not what this is.
if you're trying to push me away, it's working.
Carol, don't make me leave.
please.
how could you pick her? -- I didn't.
you don't care any more.
I care more about you than anybody.
but it's a two-way street.
you won't confide in me. -- You want it? Here it is.
what? Talk to me. -- I don't live a normal life.
you live a great life here. -- Just listen to me!
my friends get to go around saying, "My dad's a plumber."
"my dad's a pilot." "My dad's a dentist." You know what?
my dad is the best thing of all and I can't tell anyone.
you have no idea how hard it is, walking around with that secret.
and now you're going out with Principal Newman!
and you don't even tell me about it.
my whole life has become about secrets, and I hate it!
I'm sorry.
forget about Principal Newman, all right?
and forget about Santa. I'm done.
my time's up.
who cares any more?
Hi, Charlie. -- Hi, Lucy.
what are you doing? -- Just shovelling.
Oh.
Charlie, is Uncle Scott Santa Clause?
no. Why would you think that?
I don't know.
how come Uncle Scott was sad? -- What makes you think that?
I asked him to stick a straw in his nose and blow bubbles in his milk.
and he said no. -- Whatever.
can you talk to him? --I don't think so, Lucy.
did you have a fight? -- Sort of.
are you gonna make up? -- I don't know!
are you gonna be mad forever? -- Lucy! -Lucy!
what? -- These are hard questions.
no, they're not. They're easy.
and you can't be mad at him forever, Charlie.
he's your daddy and you love him.
# Dashing through the snow # In a strip-mining machine # Flatten the hills we go
come on!
put a smile on that face, little troll!
wait a minute. I got a joke. This will cheer you up.
knock, knock! -- Who's there?
aren't you? -- Aren't you who?
aren't you supposed to get back to work?!
all of ya! You little idiots! Back to work!
got any twos?
go fish.
what was that? -- I don't know.
want some more hot chocolate?
would you get that, honey? -- Yeah, sure.
is S... Scott here?
who are you?
Curtis, a friend from... Buffalo.
are you an elf? --Of course not!
why would you ask such a silly question?
how come you have pointy ears?
it's... because I never ate my green vegetables.
do you eat your green vegetables?
uncle Scott!
Yeah, I'm right here. What's wrong?
Oh... Curtis! What are you doing here?
there's a little trouble at the plant.
it's OK. Curtis is a very old friend.
we have a large firm. We work together in...
Buffalo. -- Buffalo?
we work together in Buffalo. So... we're gonna talk business.
what business? -- It's none of your business.
soon I'm gonna be seven. And then I can know things.
good night, Curtis. -- Good night, Lucy.
good night, Lucy.
what's up? -- Toy Santa's out of control.
he's locked up the elves, shut down the workshop, he thinks everybody's naughty and he's gonna give everyone coal!
why didn't Bernard tell me? -- He's under house arrest.
fly back with me to the North Pole to save Christmas!
I can't. I have no magic left. I'm out of magic. Look.
I thought you had Comet. -- Yeah, we...
Yes! Come on!
Hey, Comet. We just...
look at me.
what are ya doing?
eating sugar is bad for you.
what do you mean, you didn't eat this?
who did?
a squirrel?!
get this. You gotta fly both of us back to the North Pole.
Yeah, tonight.
OK. I'll help you up.
all right? Ready? You've got to help me a little here.
pull.
good. OK, we almost got it.
that's OK.
OK, now, help me. Can ya move anything?
fire in the hole! Get away!
eat some roughage, will you?
Oh, what about the jet pack? -- It burned up on reentry.
what am I supposed to do? Grow wings?
I hope he doesn't have too many stops to make tonight.
you and me both, pal. OK. Let's just get it over with.
OK.
one, two...
three!
what's going on down there? -- Are you sure about this?
what? The old toaster trick?
when we were kids we used to do this to get a little extra cash.
works every time! -- I can't watch this.
you ready, buddy? -- All right. Let her rip.
one, two, three!
are you all right? -- Mom!
yes? -- I lost another tooth.
should I put it under my pillow?
Yes!
by cuspids!
this way. Come on.
Curtis, get the door. It's a Tooth Fairy ambush.
what do you people want? I only carry $20 in change.
tooth Fairy, it's me, Santa.
I've lost the weight and beard, but it's me.
I know Santa. Santa is a friend. And you, sir, are no Santa.
I am too.
how did I know I could capture you by holding on to a wing?
you wanted to change your name to Captain Floss or Plaque Man.
or, as I recall, Roy.
and it was Santa's idea to call you the Molarnator.
who's the kid? -- One of my elves. He's an elf.
Santa!
the Molarnator at your service!
a little altitude, please! -- What?
could you possibly fly a little higher?
what? -- Never mind!
principal Newman?
what is it, Charlie?
you keep asking me if there's something bothering me.
well, there is. I...
I couldn't talk about it before, but...
I want to talk about it now.
OK. Go ahead.
my dad is Santa. -- Oh, please. Not you too.
hold on.
if you have no feelings for my dad, then fine.
but if the only reason for not being with him is that you don't believe in him, you're making a big mistake.
Oh, Charlie...
here.
I want you to take this. Look into this and try to remember what it was like when you were little and you still believed in Christmas.
seeing isn't believing. Believing is seeing.
you haven't seen anything yet!
Curtis? --What? --Curtis?
what do I do? -- Slow down.
OK.
piece of cake. Attaboy. There you go.
why can't you fly higher?
tooth Fairy, I want to thank you. I'll never forget this.
I wish I could do more, but I gotta go.
denver just started a new pee-wee hockey league.
before you go, I want you to know that nobody, nobody was braver than you were today.
you should be proud of your wings.
they're not too girly? -- Not on you.
wouldn't it be easier to go through the workshop?
no. That way Santa and his soldiers would be expecting us.
sound military strategy involves taking your enemy by surprise.
it's good strategy.
sometimes being a despot is a tough business.
come on.
it's Scott, isn't it?
Yeah. What are you supposed to be?
a better, stronger version of what you used to be with a flawless complexion, I might add.
look, it just glistens. -- Listen to me. I'm back now.
so untie us. Let the elves go and give me back the coat.
no can do! It's Christmas Eve! I have coal to deliver!
and I don't want those naughty kids to suffer!
boys! One, two, three!
and... one, two!
try to keep up! Let's go. Move it on!
try to... This is just too tight.
this is all my fault.
I thought I could create another Santa.
my elfin pride blinded me to all reason.
there's only one Santa.
well, I've done a pretty rotten job.
I didn't check the list twice.
my kid thinks I betrayed him.
I hurt the woman I love.
I ruined Christmas.
how'd you get up here?
I got to fly in with the Tooth Fairy.
are you OK? -- Yeah.
brush between meals and don't forget the floss.
and if anybody cares, I'm exhausted.
and she... has a beautiful smile.
thank you for everything. -- No. Thank you.
I am... the Molarnator!
come on!
get out of the way!
what are you doing?
you gotta save Christmas. -- How am supposed to save...?
no, no, no. -- Please. Don't worry.
slow down.
stay.
Thanks. Excuse me, pork chop.
OK. Chet, this is it. You ready to rock and roll?
Chet? -- Yeah. He's still in training. -Chet?
has he had much flight time? -- About a minute and a half.
he's had a lot of crash time! -- Curtis...! --Curtis...!
he's just a baby. -- All right.
let's see what this baby can do.
ready to go, buddy? You know what we gotta do.
you gotta focus, Chet.
OK, everybody! Outside, now!
almost there, boys. Let's go!
snowballs, on three!
one!
two!
three!
OK, elves...
let's get them!
not so far!
back for more action, eh, Scooter?
cut the chitchat, Chet!
why is this such a problem? Come on!
where do you think you're going?
go! -- Come on!
faster!
the lead. The one in the front, Chet!
leave my reindeer alone!
go!
come on! We got to get them before they get out the hole.
stay away from my lead reindeer!
holy Hannah, he's an action hero!
what are you doin' up there? I can't see where I'm driving.
you are a sad, strange little man.
you're gonna fall... I hope!
that's a good way to lose an eye!
look out! You're scaring me!
can I help you?
honey, I'm home!
loser!
Hey, I'm supposed to wear this coat! How about a little elbow?
there you are. That's gotta feel good.
you want the shoe? Take it off. Go ahead. Go on!
what are we gonna do now, smarty pants?
watch out! The building! Left, left!
Oh, well. The town'll break the fall.
look out!
yo, Tony! Hey, Brian, stop me!
get off of me! Now remember, rules are very, very important!
I want hot chocolate.
Hey, guys, back up. I've got a special place for him.
you idiot! Wait a minute, something's shocking me.
you were great. -- You were too.
we've got ten minutes. -- Where is Carol?
Carol! Are you all right? -- Yes!
where are you going? -- I gotta deliver gifts.
aren't you forgetting something?
no. -- You gotta get married.
excuse me?
Carol, l...
I cannot continue being Santa... unless I find a Mrs Clause.
Oh. So that's what the whole noodles and pie thing...
you just needed a wife. -- No.
no?
Yes. -- Yes?
Yes, I was looking for a wife.
no, I didn't figure on falling... in love.
you love me?
this is all happening so fast. -- Well, there's no pressure.
good.
I mean, if I don't get married I just won't deliver the gifts and children everywhere will stop believing, the elves will lose their jobs, the North Pole will disappear and Christmas will be gone.
get down on one knee. -- Hm?
do it. Now.
say "Carol.
you say this is happening all so fast.
you say this is happening all so fast.
but you've known me your whole life.
but you've known me your whole life.
when you were little and alone...
Santa..." -- I can take it from here.
Santa was always there for you.
and I will be, as long as you continue to believe in me.
I know I'm asking you to leave everything at home, but I can guarantee you that this is worth it.
this place...
this place is all about magic and love... and wonder.
and occasionally a thin-crust pizza and a movie and a long winter night.
is there a school here?
Yeah, we have one, a school, but the elves need a new principal.
cos as of late some of the elves have been acting a bit impish.
I love you. -- You do?
would you be my wife?
I will.
thank you. I've got it from here.
I will.
by the powers vested in me by me,
I now pronounce you Santa and Mrs Clause.
well, go on now. Kiss her!
dad, we gotta go. -- Walk me to my sleigh.
we gotta go! When we get back, we start making some more toys.
all right. Well, Mrs Clause, you might want to get some rest.
you see, tomorrow begins vacation season for me, which means a three-month honeymoon for us.
nothing tropical. You do not want to see this in a Speedo.
don't be home too late.
and so it begins.
boys, we've got some toys to deliver!
what, Charlie?
come downstairs. I want you to see something.
watch this.
uncle Scott?!
do you have any twos? -- Go fish!
you are Santa! I knew it was you all along.
and you were right. -- Uncle Scott...
you look all rosy. Are you feeling better?
I'm feeling much, much better.
is there anything else I should know about?
I don't know. But Charlie has something he wants to tell you.
OK.
you know, I was exactly your age when I found out my dad was Santa.
but I couldn't tell anybody. -- I can't tell anybody either?
no. But knowing it isn't a burden.
it's a gift.
most kids stop believing in Santa when they grow up.
but I get to believe in him forever.
I love you, Charlie. Thank you.
but do we still get toys?
if you ever get to bed and go to sleep like the other kids.
Oh... OK!
merry Christmas, Lucy. -- Merry Christmas, Santa.
sport, I gotta fly.
easy, boys, easy.
you're getting it, Chet.
look, Charlie!
merry Christmas, Comet!
all right, boys!
merry Christmas to all! And to all a good night!
nothing wrong with a straight line, Chet.
# Everybody loves Christmas # Everybody has fun # That time of the year, that holiday cheer # A good time for everyone # Everybody loves Christmas # Oh, count the ways # You know it's almost here # Oh, Christmas Day # Christmas Day #
Hey!
what the heck are we doing out here?
look, if we're gonna dance...
dance like this. All of us!
everybody, you idiots!
Hey, lady!
watch this!
after you doc. What. Are you gonna run?
so you're not gonna kill me?
no, I'm not gonna kill you.
how can I keep making a drug that would kill another person?
I won't. - No, no, no.
I want you to finish the drug, so I can use it... on Jason.
I've been trying to manage this thing for a very long time and I don't think I can anymore.
don't let this darkness overtake you, Jason.
what is Dr. Cole hiding?
I don't want to be a tattletale.
who's gonna know? - Ian Price.
who's Ian Price?
that's him.
that's the bad man, Ian Price.
your latte. - Thanks.
lab again?
can't live without you, huh?
some more than others.
well, it's good to have a few days off.
something wrong?
no, it's very good. Thanks.
it's just that there's a bitter...
where are they from? Sorry, the beans, I mean.
uh, Colombia. Free trade.
right, so Arabica beans.
Arabica beans are between 45 and 60% polysaccharides.
sugars.
in this case, arabinogalactans or galactomannan.
Galacta... what? - Mannans.
what is the temperature of the water in the machine?
190. - That explains it.
Polysacchs are best extracted at 200.
even a few degrees can make the biggest difference.
play with it.
the right equation's always out there.
he's back. Where'd you go?
nowhere. Stayed in town, tried not to think about this place.
what did Cole say to get you back?
nothing. Didn't come back for him.
you just can't leave any work undone, huh?
otherwise known as a scientist?
Ruben, it's Jason.
some things have changed. I've talked to Young.
I'm coming back to work at the hospital.
we need to get back to work on the drug.
please, call me as soon as you get this.
rubes, it's Ian.
what's up, brother?
I want an update on that Jason Drano you're working on.
it's Jason again, is everything okay? Where are you?
Rubenator! I came by the lab last night, you weren't there.
where were you? Hot date? Seriously, where were you?
honestly, Ruben, we don't have time for this. I need you.
Ru-u-ben, come out and pla-ay, 'cause I got some girls that are just dying to meet you.
not really, but I can get some.
Ruben, I have patients, I can't drop everything and track you down... This is Jason, again.
Ruben, what the hell's going on?
it's Ian. You're making me very angry, Rubes.
Ruben, it's Jason... - Ruben, it's Ian...
where the hell have you been?
Hey, Jason. Great to see you too.
I needed a break.
a break? Are you kidding?
Ian knows we're trying to kill him.
it's only a matter of time before...
before what?
before he threatens my family? Because it's already happened.
what? What are you talking about?
what happened? Why didn't you tell me?
what would you have said?
Oh, Ruben, stop. It's too dangerous?
I don't think so. - What-what happened?
did he contact you? How? Tell me everything.
it doesn't matter. I'm back here, aren't I?
besides, I have nothing new to show for it.
new day, new tests, new failures.
look, everything gets us one step closer, right?
that's all that matters.
close isn't good enough, Jason.
we can't afford shortcuts. I have a son!
what?
I have a son.
I... met him.
he's five years old, and he's...
I read to him.
Olivia won't let me see him again, not while Ian's around, so...
Jason, I don't know what to say.
it's 10 after 8: 00. I got to go. Look...
that's what I like to see, a great mind at work.
Hi, Rubes.
I've been worried about you.
you're a lab rat, and yet you haven't been in the lab, so what does that make you?
I guess just a plain old rat, huh?
sometimes I think better when I'm away from the lab.
Mmhmm. Like where? On the beach in Jamaica?
you know, Ruben, if I didn't know better,
I'd think you were still working with Jason.
Jason? No.
but this is not simple stuff, Ian.
mm, yeah, I see.
well, maybe you need to be a little better...
what's the word? Motivated.
and think of all the bad things that'll happen if you don't.
I'm just saying, it's complicated.
Yeah. - Try to understand, Ian.
there are two distinct neural pathways in your brain.
it's like two train tracks that split.
we need to find a drug that neutralizes one pathway.
very, very complicated. Yeah, you said that already.
what?
what, this is funny to you now?
no, not at all. Dead serious, actually.
I think my prescription's ready.
okay. Ruben, it's showtime.
Ian, listen, it's not safe.
we should do more tests. There could be side effects.
I didn't babysit you for the last 12 hours so you could do more tests.
now, let's go.
Ian, I can't. What you're asking me to do...
I'm not asking you anything.
think about what's important to you, Ruben.
and you'll leave me alone? You'll leave my family alone?
of course. Unlike Jason, I'm a man of my word.
now, let's go.
don't think of it as taking a life.
mine and yours.
come on, running out of time.
give me the drug.
he's coming. You lied to me!
no, I wasn't lying! - Ruben!
Dr. Cole!
send security to the lab!
what happened?
I tried to kill you.
good morning, Lena. - Good morning.
Hey, Ken, hold up a second.
do you remember that patient the other day?
the D. I.D. Will Hayes?
look, I already said I'm sorry I overreacted.
no, no, maybe you didn't.
I was taking him to psych, and he saw this photo on the wall...
that photo... and he said that it was someone he knew, someone named Ian Price.
I did some poking around, and I found an article that talked about an Ian Price being arrested in a bar brawl in Minneapolis seven years ago.
the same time Jason was doing his residency there.
Yeah. - What do you think?
I don't know. I don't know what to think.
maybe an alias? - Lena.
Hey, good morning, Ken. Hi, Jason.
look, I'll get back to you about that other thing.
Yeah. - Listen, it's...
save it. I've been waiting long enough.
lieutenant Tracey McCoy, 31, Marine.
she just got back from Afghanistan six months ago.
severe PTSD, not responding to medication or therapy.
Yeah, listen, Lena, my day just exploded.
it's a mess. - Oh, wow, yeah.
you should have just said so.
I can talk to her husband and her daughters,
when should I tell them you're free?
uh, right now.
thank you.
I did two tours.
I-I'd have laughed in your face.
why don't you tell us what's been happening?
it started with nightmares.
me waking up screaming, punching holes in the wall.
now, the worst of it happens when I'm awake.
one day my daughters had some friends over.
I was in another room.
and it was like this horrible wave washed over me.
next thing I remember is...
waking up, I guess you'd call it...
with my hands around the neck of my oldest, my husband screaming at me, my girls, their friends screaming.
my husband grabbed my daughter and pushed me away.
I can still see their faces just terrified of me, like I was a monster, but it was me.
I think she's a candidate for a stellate ganglion block.
it's noninvasive. It's an injection of local - in the sixth vertebra. - For PTSD?
there's a handful of cases that have worked.
stellate ganglion regulates the fight-or-flight mechanism, so anesthetize it.
that's the basic idea, yeah.
why don't you talk to McCoy and book me in O. R.
Yeah, but are you allowed to... - I'll talk to Young.
don't worry, I'll get her approval.
and I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
so how are you?
I'm feeling better.
took your advice. I'm doing what I need to do.
seeing a specialist for your condition?
Vanessa, I'm ready to get back to work.
real work, not just consults.
I want to get back in the O. R.
I'd like to do the SGB procedure on Lieutenant McCoy.
it's only been a few days. What's changed, Jason?
my perspective maybe.
no more slips. No more mistakes.
you have my word.
you know I want to believe you.
and you should.
will you approve the procedure?
I will.
good. Thank you.
I'll keep you posted.
Hey, Connie.
Dr. Young, I have a Connie Pence from Dr. Marcado's lab here to see you.
she's upset, says it's urgent. - Okay.
hello. Dr. Young.
lieutenant McCoy, how are you feeling?
you have two daughters, right?
nine and four.
it's been so long since I've seen them.
I don't now how to describe it.
I understand.
I dream about them, their faces.
but then I wake up and realize they're still gone.
well, let's get you back to your daughters.
when properly functioning, the stellate ganglion activates briefly during periods of intense stress and shuts itself down.
now, in Lieutenant McCoy's case, we will attempt to shut it down with a local anesthetic.
the brain is so cool. - Yeah, when it works.
I was right. It works.
what? - Uh, what works?
he gets very excited about lab things.
excuse me one second. What's going on?
it works. The drug works. You should be dead now.
okay, well, apparently, I'm not, so why?
the compound was too polar.
it couldn't cross the blood-brain barrier.
the drug just couldn't get where it needed to go.
so what do we do now?
I don't know, but the drug works. I did my part.
Ruben, but if you can't successfully administer it, then... - Jason, I'm sorry.
I really am, but... - What? But what?
but I have to go.
go? Where are you gonna go?
somewhere safe. Ian is gonna kill me.
Ruben, listen to me. Take it easy. Calm down.
we've got eight hours until he gets here. Okay?
that isn't enough time to figure this out.
you really think he's gonna let you walk away? He's not.
killing him is the only option for both of us and for my son.
I didn't ask for this.
I know you didn't, and I'm sorry, but I'm asking you for eight more hours, please.
fine.
Ian knows everything, so if we can't figure this out in eight hours, we're both done.
there you are.
here I am. - I need something.
Yes, your lips are moving.
but I don't think you can get it.
try me.
anti GTP-tubulin antibodies.
I've called every lab in Philly and...
and haven't gotten anywhere. Not surprising.
Tubulin. That's a tough get. What do you need it for?
do you even know what tubulin is?
I think they're clean.
Yes, I'm sure you do.
can you get us some or not?
time me.
calm down. You're okay.
Dr. Solis. Hey, what happened?
Hi. Everything's under control now.
Tracey had an attack.
I got the kids out of there, but some orderlies had to restrain her.
so the procedure didn't work.
listen, we should talk about some possible next steps.
where are your girls now? - By those nurses.
Hey, girls.
so tell me, which one of you is Rachel and which one of you is May?
I'm May. - You're May?
you know, that's my favorite month.
who are you? - Good question.
I'm Dr. Cole, but you can call me Jason. Okay?
now, your dad is down there talking to Dr. Solis, but he told me to tell you that if you wanted some cookies, there happen to be some right over there at that desk.
you want some?
all right. Enjoy.
you're not a fan of cookies, Rachel?
my mom's not getting any better, is she?
well, not as fast as we'd like, but sometimes when we try things that we think will help people and it doesn't work out the way we'd like, we're at least one step closer to something that will.
does that make sense?
I think we should stop coming to visit her.
you shouldn't give up on your mom, Rachel, 'cause she'd never give up on you.
you know why? - Because she's a Marine?
well, yeah, but mostly because getting better means that she can be close to you, and there's nothing more important than that to her.
how do you know that?
it's just how parents are.
twin Cities Memorial, records.
Hi, this is Dr. Ken Jordan from Independence Memorial Hospital.
we don't have anyone who was here by that name.
how about a patient file? Same name, Ian Price.
we do have a patient file for an Ian Price.
could you send that to me, please?
not without Mr. Price's written permission.
I don't know how things work where you are, doctor, but we can't just release a patient's file.
okay. Just give me the name of his attending physician?
Dr. Philip Charmelo.
that's the Philip Charmelo?
our Chairman Emeritus, if that's what you mean.
so he's still based there?
Dr. Charmelo has his own foundation now, but I can give you his direct number.
the equipment in this room can be used to create a three-dimensional map of your brain.
I'm hoping that if we can do that,
did you talk to my girls before they left?
were they okay?
Dr. Cole did, yes, and they're fine.
good. That's good.
is that even possible?
Yes, if we induce the PTSD episode during the mapping.
you want me to go crazy while you watch, is that it?
if you were to talk me through that day in Kabul, take me back there.
then you better strap me down.
it was early morning. People were still praying.
I was on patrol near the school when some bad guys started firing off some rounds,
I saw three go down before I made it inside.
I was alone, going room-to-room, but I can't find the girls.
I can hear them, though.
every time rounds hit the windows, glass shatters and the kids scream.
more shots. More screams.
I follow the sound until I find ten girls in a corner of this one room.
I have gum on me... I always have gum...
so I hand some out.
the girls grab at it and light up like it's a sign that it's all okay, that it's safe.
Shh. Shh. Shh. Not yet.
but they don't understand.
a few of the girls start to laugh, one stands up.
get down!
I hear glass, and her head snaps back. "Get down!"
yellow is pre-attack and red is during.
you see how one pathway is completely overtaking the other.
Yeah, I know, and it got me thinking, what about deep brain stimulation?
you mean via electrode?
Hey, I talked to Josh. He said he could get us...
Ruben, come here a second. I want to show you something.
sorry, Lena, go ahead. Take a look at this.
a surgically implanted electrode would target the amygdala directly.
the pathway where the PTSD is manifesting, you know, like flipping a switch.
switching tracks. - An electrode.
what do you think?
I think it could work. What do you think?
Yeah, yeah.
it could work. An electrode.
I can't believe I didn't think of it before.
did you talk to him about this?
Lena, this has never been done before, not for PTSD.
I know, but I can get it approved - if you're the one doing it. - You?
I'm sorry, when are you doing this never-before-done surgery?
you think McCoy would agree to it?
you've seen her girls. What do you think?
Jason. - All right, we do the surgery right away.
I'll talk to McCoy. - Great.
even if we use an electrode on you, we still need to deal with the timing issue.
the drug needs to be delivered during transition.
we use a chip, like chemo chips used to treat brain tumors, only we retrofit for compound delivery.
we just have to code it to deliver at exactly 8: 25.
so a time-released dopaminergic, okay.
we still need the right platform for the chip.
platinum maybe?
Yeah, platinum. Exactly... - Or one of maybe 20 other metals, but you know what?
it will probably be our first guess, 'cause you know, that's how science usually works.
we'll get it. We'll get it.
gentlemen.
Dr. Young. - We have a problem.
or should I say, the two of you have a problem.
okay, what is it? - Well, let's start with your lab tech calling security this morning because she saw you strangling Dr. Marcado here.
we can explain that. - Can you?
I've been with her in security all morning.
she paints quite a picture.
accusations of you testing experimental drugs on yourself and an overall pattern of behavior that shatters not just the protocols of this hospital, - but Pennsylvania State Law. - Oh, God.
Oh, yes, Dr. Marcado.
should any of this be true,
have you any idea what position this puts the hospital in...
puts me in personally?
until then, I have no choice but to shut this lab down and to suspend the two of you without pay.
Vanessa, please, wait. You can't shut the lab down.
not yet. - Jason, I can.
and I am.
this is... everything we need from the lab, right?
Jason, it's almost 8: 00. - Yeah, I know, but...
but nothing. It's 8: 00, and we're sitting here - in your kitchen. - Ruben, we can do this.
we don't know what the right platform metal is for the chip.
we're nowhere.
it's almost 8: 00. We're out of time.
I'm sorry, Jason, but we just are.
no. I'm out of time, you're not.
here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna...
you're gonna lock me up upstairs.
you're gonna handcuff me, and then you're gonna come back and get me in the morning.
you can work all night.
it's not a permanent solution, but it should work, right?
it might.
Yeah, exactly. - And it might not.
Ruben... - You said it yourself.
Ian knows everything now. He can't be controlled.
Yeah, he can! For one night, he can!
and who's to say it's gonna take one night?
who's to say I'm close to having the right kind of chip?
we... I... - I told you I would give you eight more hours, that's what I told you!
I know you don't owe me a second more of your time or your friendship or any more of that consistently amazing brain of yours, but I am begging you.
please, lock me up and keep working.
I don't know what else to do.
it's 8: 21.
okay, I-I think we're good, right?
just in case.
stretch out your leg.
good. It's better safe than sorry.
we don't need to be sorry.
we're gonna finish this thing once and for all.
all right, good luck tonight. Thanks.
Hey, Ruben?
I'll see you in the morning.
there you are. Six hours, three minutes.
Anti-GTP-tubulin antibodies. Bam.
sorry, I don't need those anymore.
what? Are you kidding?
do you know what I had to do to get those?
I'm sorry. Thank you for your hard work.
Ruben, what's going on?
what is this? Are you going somewhere?
things went haywire, Josh.
actually, what's worse than haywire?
what things? Where is Dr. Cole?
he's at home. - Home?
but you can't go there! - Why not?
Josh, honestly, my advice to you is to just forget about Jason.
forget about him?
Jason's sick, and if you see him again...
if I see him again? How sick is he?
so sick that it would be best if you didn't.
trust me.
where are you going?
somewhere warm and safe, and I suggest you do the same.
good-bye, Josh.
Hello?
Dr. Cole?
you okay?
Dr. Cole?
are you all right?
it's me, Josh.
Dr. Cole.
Oh, my.
good evening, Josh.
uh, hello, Dr. Cole. Are those handcuffs?
okay, thanks.
is there someone else here?
that's a great question.
no, there's not.
can we skip the part about how I got here, and you help me find a way out?
Ruben? What did he tell you?
that you were sick, and that he was going someplace warm and safe, and at the moment, I can't say I blame him.
well, that makes one of us.
look, Josh, there must be some kind of key or something around here.
could you start looking for it?
there's a bottle of scotch in it for you if you find it.
I don't drink scotch.
just start looking. Okay? Today.
Yeah, ma, I need you to stay.
just get everything, move to Tio's place for a couple of days.
I love you too. I will call you as soon as I land.
I'll explain everything. - I'm not wearing a belt.
I got to go. I'll call you back.
your departure will be delayed one hour.
the new departure time is 10: 50 P. M.
your machine's probably broken.
probably not, actually.
well, I don't have any metal on me, except the damn rod in my leg.
and what might that rod be made of?
titanium, I think.
it doesn't usually set this stuff off.
that doesn't mean that it can't.
titanium is a dynamic element when fused with organic material...
sir, step this way, please.
titanium. That's the platform.
if you haven't already done so, please stow your carry-on luggage underneath the seat in front of you or in an overhead bin.
this is your captain speaking.
we'll be pushing back in just a few minutes for what should be a pretty fast trip down to sunny Jamaica.
thanks for flying with us.
flight crew, prepare the cabin, arm and cross check.
right on time.
Charmelo couldn't email you?
I mean, what's with the phone call?
I don't know.
his office called, they gave me a number, they told me to call him right... now.
they said he was overseas.
Ken, you know, why push this any further?
Jason's already suspended. You won, right?
come on, Lena, you want to know this as badly as I do.
Dr. Charmelo, hello. This is Dr. Kenneth Jordan.
I'm here with Dr. Lena Solis at IMH in Philadelphia.
it's a real honor to speak to you, sir.
thank you very much for taking the time to help us with this.
I was told you're interested in a former patient of mine, - Ian Price? - That's correct, sir.
are you treating him there? - That's just it.
we're not exactly sure that it's the same Ian Price that you treated.
our patient is unable to verify his information.
we're hoping you could help us out.
let's see, I saw an Ian Price in the summer of 1983.
he was six years old and had Fanconi's syndrome.
Fanconi's? - So full kidney failure?
that's right.
Dr. Charmelo, this is Dr. Solis.
I'm afraid our patient is not on dialysis, so it's impossible that we're talking about the same person, but thank you so much for your time.
we really appreciate it. - Are you sure you're recalling this Ian Price correctly?
I don't recall patients incorrectly, Dr. Jordan, especially when I'm staring at their file.
is that all?
uh, yes, thank you, sir.
can I get you another drink, sir?
Yeah, sure. That'd be great, thanks.
sir, the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign is on.
Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to...
Oh, my gosh, Ruben. What a small world.
this is a really good friend of mine.
you know what? I'm going to sit right here next to him if that's okay. No, actually, he's not.
Oh, come on, it's fine.
he just had a rough week at work.
you know what? Bring us another two of whatever he's drinking. I'm buying.
no. No. - Hey, come on.
your money's no good up here.
36, 000 feet, just the two of us, nowhere to go, unless you have a parachute.
you don't sell parachutes, do you?
I'll be back wi your drinks.
uh... - Thank you.
you don't want a drink?
Ruben. - Excuse me, miss?
you want to have this conversation up here around all these people, or when we land and it's just the two of us alone somewhere?
thank you so much. - Okay.
we're just gonna talk?
Yeah.
your screensaver.
what?
your screensaver on your computer.
Jamaica, exclamation point.
Montego Bay, exclamation point.
caught a glimpse of it, and I took a chance.
caught the last flight out from Philly to... wait for it...
Montego Bay, Jamaica.
exclamation point.
it's funny, if you just had a picture of, like, a cute cat or something, this might be a very different situation.
I'm allergic to cats.
Yeah, me too. Hate 'em.
more of a dog person, you know? Dogs are loyal.
you could die in front of your dog, and they would stay with you until somebody found you.
might even help pay for the funeral, but not cats.
no, they would just check your pulse, take your wallet, and split.
I left him there. I was supposed to stay and I left him there. Yeah, I noticed, handcuffed.
okay, I left you both there, but still, I didn't help him.
I went and I deleted every file on the drug in the lab.
you can check.
you didn't delete all the files, Ruben.
no, I did, Ian. I did, honestly.
no, you didn't.
there's one file that you didn't delete.
this one right here, and now that I know that you can't be trusted, that you are, in fact, the pesky little cat that I thought you to be...
but that's the whole thing. You don't have to trust me...
because the drug doesn't work, and I don't know how to get the drug to work, so you're safe.
you want to know what I think?
I think we're gonna have a great time in Jamaica.
quick trip, though, for me at least.
quick turnaround, you know?
no, this can't be happening.
when we land, I'm going to go to the police...
Oh, really? - And I'll explain it to them.
they'll listen to me. They will.
you mean the Montego Bay Police Department?
that is such a good idea. They're such good listeners.
what are you gonna tell them?
look at me. I'm Jason Cole.
then I'll kill you.
okay.
I don't need a drug to do it. I will.
take it easy. - Go to hell.
as opposed to where?
okay, okay, we can work something out.
Mm-hmm. - I'll get back to work on the drug for you. I will, I promise.
that'll be $12 for both. - Thank you so much.
you know what? Here you go.
put an extra $10 on there for you.
thank you. - Thank you...
so much. Mmm.
Ruben, when I was a little boy, my father used to tell me that some people are born bad.
they just pop out that way, but I don't believe him.
I believe whatever you do in this life, good or bad, or in between, you do it so you can get by.
whatever it takes to survive.
so have a drink with me. It's now or never.
what am I supposed to... drink to?
survival. Mine, at least.
morning, Jason.
Hey, Josh, have you seen Ruben?
wait, what are you talking about?
is that what he told you?
Yes, Dr. Cole.
when did you see him?
before 9: 00, and I'm pretty sure I saw him pack up half his office into his suitcase and delete some computer files.
what happened between you two?
with all due respect, Dr. Cole, things have gotten a little weird.
a lot weird, actually.
are you okay?
Lena, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to tell you, but I don't think - I'm going to be able to do... - Lieutenant McCoy's surgery?
Yeah, I heard. The entire hospital is talking about how you're being suspended.
right, well, maybe you could call...
l. L. Richards in Vancouver or Amsel in Hamburg?
I already have.
they'd be lucky if they can fit her in in the next few months, and that's if she has the money.
I want nothing more than to do this surgery, come on.
my... I can't do it. My hands are tied.
I used to think that whatever your personal issues were, your character issues, whatever those were, they didn't affect you being a doctor, and now I really can't say that, can I?
I have nothing but questions about you, Jason,
okay. Then let's go see her.
lieutenant McCoy, you're checking out?
well, no point in just taking up space here, right?
Dr. Solis told me about your suspension.
you can't do the operation now. I get it.
orders are orders, right?
let me ask you something.
you regret running into that building to save those kids, even though you were ordered not to?
no. - I didn't think so.
if you'll agree to it, I'd still like to do your surgery.
Jason. - I know.
okay. - Okay.
Hey, Joy, I need a favor.
can you book me an O. R. off the board?
first of all, I want to thank you all for being here.
lieutenant McCoy thanks you as well, but I want to be very clear about one thing.
you probably shouldn't be here.
you've all heard about my suspension,
now, I have nothing left to lose, but you do.
I would understand completely if you didn't want to risk it.
I understand your loyalty is not just to me, but to this patient.
we're with you, Dr. Cole.
thank you.
190 offset at zero depth.
what we are about to attempt has never been done before.
if it's successful, it will change Lieutenant McCoy's life and many other lives.
localizing lateral offset.
100% concordance.
but we won't just be changing lives, we'll be saving them.
we're there, Dr. Cole.
lightening anesthesia.
the people that make our lives worth living.
okay.
went well. No issues.
she should recover relatively quickly.
you'll be able to run some tests later today.
I know. That's why I did it.
I should get going.
I'm never gonna understand you.
well, maybe we never really know anyone.
what did... - Dr. Cole!
Dr. Young.
did you just perform surgery on an IMH patient in an IMH O. R?
I did. - You're fired.
I want you out of this hospital immediately.
you're finished here. - I'm sorry, Vanessa.
Oh, yes, you most certainly are!
you know, it's almost funny.
I thought I would enjoy this moment, but I just feel... sad.
what a waste.
Oh, thank you, Ruben.
so have a drink with me. - What am I supposed to drink to?
survival.
mine.
it's a solitary lesion. - It's a tumor.
tomorrow, in the O.R. instead of taking out the tumor I don't have, you are gonna place this chip, keep Ian from coming, hopefully for good.
my full team is flying in.
it would be an honor to be your first in the O.R.
my old hospital is looking for a Chief of Neurosurgery.
twin Cities Memorial?
this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
unfortunately, we just don't have an opening right now.
what about the department chair?
that position's filled.
we're just finishing up the paperwork.
Charmelo knew that.
we're operating today on Jason Cole to place a neurotransmitter in his brain.
where is the tumor?
you ready, my friend?
Yeah.
look, there he is. - Oh, such a big boy.
happy Birthday, kiddo.
are you having a good time?
Where's Jason?
Ian, hey.
Jason, can you hear me?
without hopefully stopping your heart.
great.
Jason, nod if you can understand me.
twins.
Ian and I, I saw it.
it was just a dream, Jason.
anesthesia will do that.
no, it felt real. - Oh, come on.
you're not the first patient to hallucinate during surgery.
help me up.
lie back down, Jason.
Phil, what if it's a memory?
you're not making any sense.
if you'd had a brother, you'd know it.
think about it.
dreams are a reflection of your conscious reality.
I don't know.
Lars, how are we doing on that anesthesia?
we're close. About ten minutes.
so, once Ian comes back, the surgery is off.
the chip can only be implanted on your time, not his.
I just wish I had more time. - Well, there isn't.
what do you want to do, Jason?
Yeah, let's get it over with.
easy.
I'm sorry, but Dr. Young's in a meeting.
I don't care.
Vanessa, I need your help.
this is not a good time.
no, I need you to look at these MRIs.
there's multiple discrepancies.
there's irregularities... I said not now.
Jason doesn't have a brain tumor.
I was in the room. I saw the MRI.
I assure you he does. - His scans are clean.
there's nothing there, Vanessa.
are you saying that Dr. Charmelo imagined it too?
Jason does not need this surgery.
he knows it, and Charmelo knows it.
Charmelo's doing everything he can to help Jason.
everybody's doing everything they can to help Jason.
I suggest you do the same.
I'm sorry, detective. Please continue.
no, I wasn't.
but he is employed here? - Technically.
currently he's suspended and under review.
well, Dr. Marcado never checked into his hotel.
his luggage went unclaimed for over a week.
he hasn't been in contact with friends and family, so they opened a missing persons case.
I had no idea. - Dr. Marcado's
and who was that?
a Jason Cole.
do you know where I can find him?
Hey, where's Dr. Cole's surgery?
O.R. 6.
charge nurse. - Hi. This is Dr. Solis.
I need security to unlock the observation room to O.R. 6.
that observation room is off-limits.
you've got to be kidding me.
Hi, Dr. Lena Solis. I need in.
sorry, I'm under strict orders.
no one goes in.
well, I'm Dr. Cole's neurologist.
Dr. Charmelo said no one.
then I'm going to need him to step out and speak with me.
until the surgery is over.
Hey, Ken, can I, uh, can I call you right back?
it was a lie, all of it.
they just wanted me out of their O.R.
what are you talking about?
the neurosurgery job here was filled a week ago.
Charmelo knew that.
he just wanted to keep me away from Jason's surgery.
I mean, how incompetent does he think I am?
no, Charmelo's locking us all out.
Why? - I don't know.
listen to this, I got my hands on Jason's MRIs,
what?
they're clear.
there's no tumor.
wait, are you sure? - I'm positive.
and there's more.
okay, one set of the MRIs was labeled "J. C."
and the other set was labeled "I. P."
who else could it be? - Lena...
if Charmelo's not removing a tumor in there, - then what is he doing? - I don't know, but I have to stop this.
anesthesia report.
warmer in place. Start the ketamine drip.
this new anesthetic cocktail would knock out secretariat.
hmm. - I hope you're ready.
I'm ready.
you know the drill.
which one do you want?
mom said we have to clean up first.
Jason, it's our birthday.
these are our presents.
awesome. - Gross.
if you don't want it, I'll take it.
what will you trade me?
Oh, take this.
Really?
it looks boring.
Ian, be careful. - I got it.
see?
boys, what happened?
what do we do?
what.
my mother's vase.
it was an accident.
who did this?
mom, please don't get mad.
who did this? - I did.
Jason, you're lying. - No, I'm not.
you know the rules about lying.
I did it. I swear.
stop covering for him.
stop, you're hurting me.
I am sick of you always covering for him!
don't hurt my brother.
evac all O.R. suites to post-op.
Hey, Garrity, how are we doing with that annunciator panel?
we're showing a water flow alarm on the fourth floor.
what the hell's going on?
we show two pulled fire alarms,
O.R. 6 and the west hallway.
Where's the fire?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
sir, there are 70 patients on this floor.
have you any idea how long this is gonna take?
we're working as fast as we can.
the surgery's been put on hold.
you're perfectly safe.
door.
come this way. - Where's the fire, Vanessa?
it was a false alarm.
only the neuro suites were affected.
affected?
the damn sprinklers went off.
the O.R. is contaminated.
we'll sterilize it.
in 24 hours?
Jason doesn't have that kind of time.
well, it will be our first priority.
that's not good enough.
this surgery is going forward today, which means we restart in one hour.
all right.
okay, listen, now, we have some...
we have some O.R.s up on the sixth floor.
we don't usually do neurosurg there, but they just might work.
I need to see them.
Yes, doctor. - Some hospital you run here.
Hi.
I'm Ken Jordan.
I'm the new Chief of Neurosurgery here.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I heard they just hired someone, but I never meet the higher-ups.
Aw, that's a shame.
you got that right.
well, Joanna, I'm wondering if you could help me out.
I need to take a look at the file of a former patient.
of course.
have you been issued a T.C.M. security clearance card?
H.R. was my next stop.
an hour? Try three.
well, see, I should have interviewed with you to get the real scoop on this place.
well, you're stuck here now. - Yes, I definitely am.
uh, so what do you think? Can you help me out?
what's the patient's name again?
okay, everyone, it's safe.
you can go back to your rooms.
family members, please return to the waiting room.
it's fine.
it's just a false alarm.
Dr. Young!
Dr. Young, where's Dr. Cole?
is he okay? Is he alive?
he's fine. He's fine.
he's just sleeping it off while they're prepping a new O.R.
is there anything I can do. Anything?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.
anything.
Why? He's just on vacation.
well, he never got to where he was going.
Oh, my God. Is he...
missing. That's what we know.
we know he's missing.
Jason. - Jason is sick.
we all know his recent behavior, especially towards Dr. Marcado.
no. No! There is no way that Dr. Cole had anything to do with Ruben going missing.
well, the police are not convinced.
I am. - Good, because Jason's in no shape to defend himself, and he won't be for quite some time.
listen Josh, I need you to find something that puts him as far from Ruben Marcado as possible.
I will. I won't stop until Dr. Cole is completely exonerated.
well, he hasn't been convicted yet.
well, I acquit him of any suspicion, disprove any motive.
I'm on it.
thank you.
you hungry?
Thanks.
how much longer is mom going to keep you locked up in here?
I don't know.
but I will get even with her. Watch me.
Ian, you can't keep doing these things.
what things?
hurting people.
I wasn't hurting mom. I was protecting you.
still...
as long as we stick together, no one can ever hurt us.
together forever.
together forever.
we're moving up to the sixth floor.
it's going to be a very tight squeeze up there.
we need to find room for our intraoperative E.E.G. a plasma screen for radiology, and the extra anesthesia.
I'm on it.
you'll need to pack up a full neurosurg kit.
they've got nothing up there. - Yes, doctor.
Oh, and people, hustle it up.
I start to scrub in two minutes.
is it over?
the surgery? Yeah, for good.
saw your scans.
there's no tumor, but I'm guessing you already knew that.
no, that's it, no more lies.
Jason, there is no surgery unless you tell me why you faked a tumor, why there's a guard outside of your O. R. and who in the hell is Ian Price?
the truth, Jason, all of it, or there's no surgery.
I want each of you to to take a different wing in the hospital.
somebody moved Jason out of the post-op, but they can't have taken him far.
he won't be Jason for long, and we're running out of time.
you wouldn't believe me if I told you, so I'll have to show you.
start at the beginning.
I don't remember the beginning.
my childhood is a blank.
then start with what you remember.
okay.
I was ten years old.
it was night.
I was in my room doing homework, and then, suddenly, I was standing outside in the woods.
and then it happened again a couple of weeks later, at exactly the same time, 8: 25 P. M.
at first, I'd black out for ten minutes, and then it was 1/2 hour, and then an hour, and slowly, over time, it was half of my life.
I'd wake up in different places, with different people, having done terrible things.
one morning I woke up and there was a message written on the mirror.
"let me introduce myself." It was signed...
Yeah, Ian Price.
Lena, this surgery, it's all I've got.
it's my only shot at a cure.
I want to believe you, Jason, I do.
but what you're describing, it doesn't exist.
Lena, when I transition, you'll see.
you'll have your proof, and once you do,
I need you to call Dr. Charmelo immediately.
he'll know what to do. - Okay.
and, Lena, no matter what I say, no matter what Ian says, promise me you will not come in this room.
I promise. - Okay.
I'm watching.
I just... I wanted to...
Oh, my God.
are you okay?
Jason, tell me you're okay.
can you hear me?
guess again.
Lena, is that you?
I guess the cat's out of the bag now, huh, Lena?
come on, I'll let you scratch my back like I scratched yours at that motel room.
you remember that, don't you?
Ooh, what a night that was.
thomas Cole and Evelyn Price?
it was you, wasn't it?
all those times.
it's always been you.
only when you were having fun.
when you were bored out of your mind, that was Jason.
at the motel room, late at night at the hospital.
Yeah, I guess I should properly introduce myself, huh?
Ian Price. - Ooh, a believer.
I'm getting there. - You look scared.
you're not helping. - What's the deal, Lena?
I just needed to see it for myself.
I see.
so the doctor in you wanted to make sure I was real before you kill me, is that it?
so much for "Do no harm," huh?
it's okay.
take a look.
I'm flesh and blood, just like him.
one body, two minds, two lives.
I didn't think it was possible.
well, now you know. - Yeah.
don't let them kill me, Lena.
I am just as real as he is. - Are you?
I have a son.
I have a woman that I love.
so, yes.
you'll say anything, won't you?
let me ask you this, if killing me is the right thing to do, why keep it a secret from everyone, especially you?
I'd like your professional diagnosis here, doc.
am I some disease that needs to be cut out?
some cancer? A tumor?
I don't know what you are.
who are you to judge?
who are any of you to decide who lives and who dies?
they are gonna kill me, Lena.
please, don't let them kill me.
I'm sorry, Ian.
get me out of this!
let me out of here right now!
get me out of here!
right now!
it keeps getting worse, the older he gets.
I'm scared of him, my own son.
he's violent, angry, destructive.
my husband couldn't take it anymore.
he just left.
I'm on my own now, and I can't live like this anymore.
I lock my bedroom door at night.
I'm scared to close my eyes.
I told you what he did to my arm, completely unprovoked.
I was thinking about sending him away, until I read about you.
well, reform school is an option, but what I do has a more lasting effect.
it's targeted and permanent.
with surgery, we can alter impulse control, memory, his personality.
and you guarantee Ian will be different?
I promise you I won't rest until your son is cured, no matter how long it takes.
I am so grateful to you, Dr. Charmelo.
where is he?
Jason told me to call you, so I did.
I don't know what the hell you're up to, but you are way...
listen to me, I know everything.
the fake cancer, the doctored MRIs, Ian Price.
don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody.
I'm on your side.
I don't give a damn who you tell.
where is Ian now?
he's asleep in a patient room.
which one? - He's safe.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means I sedated him with haloperidol.
haloperidol is never gonna work.
well, I gave him over ten milligrams.
he's built up a resistance to anesthetics.
it wouldn't matter how much you gave him.
now, you listen to me.
you have no idea who you're dealing with.
paging Dr. Charmelo.
paging Dr. Charmelo.
hello.
Dr. Young, it's Josh Stern.
I'm so sorry to be calling this late.
no, it's okay.
I'm... I'm... I'm awake.
you know, maybe we should wait until tomorrow, until Dr. Cole's out of surgery and he can explain this himself.
explain what?
you want what's best for Dr. Cole, right?
I do.
and if he were in some kind of trouble, you'd want to protect him, right?
what did you find, Josh?
Dr. Cole was on Ruben's flight to Jamaica.
he used his credit card on the plane.
I didn't know anything about the flight,
I didn't book it.
and he was back at work the next day.
I didn't even realize he was gone.
no one did.
well, I'm glad you called me.
I'm not. - No, you did the right thing.
you'll protect him, won't you? - Of course.
thank you.
Yes, Detective Carson, please.
this is Dr. Vanessa Young speaking.
Hello, Ian.
I'm Dr. Charmelo.
I figured.
you don't remember me, do you?
should I?
Oh, we've been acquainted for a long, long time.
I'm sorry, doc, I'm going to have to cut our reunion a little short.
I think you'll want to hear what I have to say.
well, I'm not a very good listener.
Oh, you'll want to hear this, trust me.
what do you want? - Are you Evelyn Price?
who are you?
I'm Ken Jordan. I'm a doctor.
wait, wait, wait, please. It's about Ian Price.
what about him?
you know him? - Um...
my file has this listed as his last residence.
it says he lived here with his parents, a Thomas Cole and an Evelyn Price.
Oh, oh, they lived here a long time ago.
I don't know where they are now.
well, do you recall if they had a son?
he died.
was his name Ian?
um, I don't remember.
that's all I remember.
what about the name Jason Cole?
I don't recall.
good-bye, doctor.
Philip, what happened? - It's okay.
everybody's safe. - Lena?
including her, though that wasn't your brightest idea.
Ian, did he get out? - Yeah.
it's okay. I know how to handle him.
what did you do?
he just needed a good talking to.
I'll let you two catch up.
you're back. - I'm back.
you believe me?
Ian was everything you said he'd be, and a little more.
you okay? - Yeah.
I'm better than okay.
I understand, finally.
wait.
do that again.
I just need to make sure that was real.
O.R.'s prepped.
I'll come and find you when we're finished.
I'd like her there, Philip.
okay, then away we go.
Philip, that looks like an old surgical scar, doesn't it?
Yes, it does.
Jason never mentioned a previous surgery to me.
is that so?
scalpel.
nasty looking cut.
Hey, buddy.
Oh, you have no idea how long I've waited to do that.
this is for the life you took from me.
now I'm gonna take yours.
what's happening? - Asystole.
I do not have a pulse. - Hit him with an amp of epi.
starting compressions.
get the code cart. I'll report.
pushing epi.
check his potassium.
electrolytes are normal.
check him again.
pulse? - Still no pulse.
deeper with those chest compressions.
Yes, doctor. - His brain's dying.
if you hit his orbital surface on his frontal lobe...
I'm not even through his skull yet.
pulse?
still no pulse.
nothing on his E.K.G.
damn it. High dose epi, now.
the meds aren't doing it. - High dose epi.
open his drapes.
I've got to go into his chest.
scalpel. - Scalpel.
he needs cardiac massage.
prepping for cardiac massage.
do me a favor.
die a little quieter.
I wouldn't want them to hear us.
cute, huh?
that's right, Jason.
we're brothers.
I just found out myself.
who knew?
let's go. Let's go.
we're out of time.
there's just so much you don't know, Jason.
too bad you're never going to find out.
wait.
there's v-fib on the monitor.
shock him now.
all clear.
I have a pulse. - Sinus rhythm.
pulse getting stronger.
he's back.
he's back.
Ian, let's fill up our canteens.
cool.
I'll start a fire.
we can cook squirrels for dinner.
what took you so long?
you're gonna want to see this.
this is how it ends.
I brought spaghetti.
spaghetti won't last us more than a day, but we can eat squirrels forever.
we never have to go home again.
Ian? - Yeah?
I don't know if I can kill a squirrel.
that's okay.
I'll kill enough for the both of us.
what a pisser.
come on.
you don't want to miss all the fun, do you?
Jason, come on. Hurry up.
I'm tired.
we're almost there. - How do you know?
because I know. See?
now, we're going to set the camp right here.
the fire can go over there. Ian.
we should go back.
what?
we should go home.
we are never going home, ever again.
mom will forgive you. - No, she won't.
she wants me to see that doctor so he can cut open my head.
maybe he'll help.
help me what? - Help you be better.
I thought you loved me. - I do.
then why do you want me to change?
I just don't want you to hurt anyone.
you want me to be more like you.
I'm going home. - You're not going anywhere.
stop. Let go!
don't leave me. - Stop.
you told me we'd be together forever.
you told me that.
you promised.
you said we'd be together forever.
don't! Stop!
stop! All right!
No!
come on. Come on.
come on.
come on!
don't bother.
you're dead.
no. This... this isn't real.
this is... This is a dream.
come on.
come on.
it's not a dream, Jason.
come on. - You're remembering.
no.
no, it's not possible.
you couldn't be saved then, and you can't be saved now.
no. No!
you died in this river 25 years ago.
you only exist in my mind.
I created you, Jason.
No! You're lying.
you're lying.
am I?
you don't believe me?
check with your doctor. I'm sorry, my doctor.
Charmelo. - He told me everything.
and now he's cutting you out, finally, after all these years.
you know why?
because you're the alter, Jason, not me.
probe.
let's confirm.
where are we?
the E.E.G. s say we are at 180-32-1. 02.
that the exact location of the Ian-Jason overlay?
Yes, it matches the MRIs perfectly.
chip.
good-bye, Jason.
it's lovely!
you want to buy Shukina?
or Peshwami? Most beautiful Peshwami in all of Shan Shen.
er, no, thanks.
tell your fortune, lady?
the future predicted. Your life foretold.
0h, no, thanks.
don't you want to know if you're going to be happy?
I'm happy right now, thanks.
you've got red hair.
the reading's free for red hair.
all right, then.
Oh, you're fascinating! No, but you're good.
I can see... a man.
the most remarkable man.
how did you meet him?
you're supposed to tell me.
I see the future.
tell me the past.
when did your lives cross?
it's sort of complicated.
I ended up in his spaceship on my wedding day.
long story.
but what led you to that meeting?
all sorts of things, but my job, I suppose.
it was on Earth, this planet called Earth. Miles away.
but I had this job, as a temp, I was a secretary, in a place called HC Clements.
hc Clements, can I help you?
sorry.
it's the incense.
just breathe deep.
this job of yours.
what choices led you there?
there was a choice. Six months before.
cos the agency offered me this contract with HC Clements.
there was this otherjob, my mum knew this man...
Jival, he's called, Jival Chowdry.
he runs that little photocopy business and he needs a secretary.
I've got a job! -- As a temp!
this is permanent! It's 20, 000 a year, Donna.
hc Clements is in the city, it's nice, it's posh, so stop it!
your life could have gone one way or the other.
what made you decide?
I just did.
but when was the moment?
when did you choose?
it won't take long, just turn right, we'll pop in and see Mr Chowdry, so Suzette can introduce you.
I'm going left, if you don't like it, get out and walk!
if you turn right, you'll have a career. Not just filling-in.
you think I'm so useless.
0h, I know why you want a job with HC Clements, lady.
cos you think you'll meet a man with lots of money and your whole life will change.
well, let me tell you, sweetheart, city executives don't need temps.
except for practice.
Yeah, well, they haven't met me!
you turned left.
what if you'd turned right? What then?
let go of my hands.
what if it changes? What if you go right?
what if you could still go right?
stop it!
what's that? What's on my back?
what is it? What's on my back?
make the choice again, Donna Noble, and change your mind.
turn right!
I'm turning.
turn right.
turn right!
turn RIGHT!
let me tell you, sweetheart, city executives don't need temps.
except for practice.
Yeah. Suppose you're right.
turn right, and never meet that man.
turn right and change the world!
get out ofthe way!
get out ofthe way!
here we are! Feed at the trough!
Mooky says, let's go to the Boardwalk, it's two for the price of one.
Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving!
well, exactly! Get in and grab them!
that's the second round of drinks you've bought, it was my turn.
I can afford it. Promotion!
you are talking to Jival Chowdry's Personal Assistant, I'll have you know.
here's to Mr Chowdry!
mr Chowdry!
she gets all the luck.
what's wrong? What is it?
sorry?
did someone spill a drink on me? -- No.
why'd you keep looking at my shoulder, what's wrong?
I don't know.
Oh, don't tell me you're getting all spooky again.
it was bad enough when you saw the ghost of Earl Mountbatten at the Boat Show.
What're you looking at? What is it?
it's like...
it's like there's something I can't see.
no, shut up all of you! Come and see.
just look at the sky! It's a star!
it's a Christmas star!
come on, then.
what the hell is that?
Ken Livingston, that's what!
spending our money on decorations!
how much did that cost?
don't be so stupid, it's flying, it's really flying!
that's not a star - that's a web.
it's heading east, the middle ofthe city.
Alice, there's a great big web star thing shooting at people and you're looking at ME!
there's something on your back!
Donna! Where you going?
you'll get yourself killed! Donna!
fire!
everyone stay back!
the Thames has been closed.
return to your homes.
keep away from the river, and that's an order.
trap 1 to Greyhound 15, what is your report? 0ver.
from the evidence I'd say he managed to stop a creature, some sort of red spider.
blew up the base underneath the barrier, flooded the whole thing. Over.
and where is he now? 0ver.
we've found a body, sir. Over.
is it him? Over.
I think so. Just didn't make it out in time.
the Doctor is dead.
it must have happened too fast for him to regenerate.
escort the ambulance back to unit base.
what happened, what did they find?
did they find someone? -- I don't know.
bloke called the Doctor or something.
where is he?
they took him away. He's dead.
I'm sorry. Did you know him?
I mean, they didn't say his name. It could be any doctor.
I came so far.
it could be anyone.
what's your name? -- Donna. And you?
Oh, I was just...passing by, I shouldn't even be here. This is wrong.
this is wrong. This is so wrong.
sorry, what was it, Donna what?
why'd you keep looking at my back? -- I'm not.
Yes, you are. You keep looking behind me, you're doing it now.
what is it, what's there?
has someone put something on my back?
you can't sack me!
I'm your Personal Assistant!
you don't have to make a scene, just come downstairs, and we can talk.
0h, I'll make a scene, right in front of a tribunal.
and the first thing I'll say is 'wandering hands'!
you know what it's been like for the past few months, ever since that Christmas thing.
half my contracts were on the other side of the river, and the Thames is still closed off.
look, I can't deliver, I'm losing a fortune.
well, sack one of this lot! Sack Cliff!
he just sits there, I don't know what he does all day.
sorry, Cliff...
actually, I'm not sorry, what do you do all day?
what the hell?
like an earthquake. That's weird.
funny sort of clouds...
who typed this?
I'm your PA, did you get someone else to type this?
it sounds impossible, but the entire hospital has vanished.
the Royal Hope no longer exists.
it's not been destroyed, there's no wreckage, it's simply gone.
reports from bystanders say that the rain lifted up around the hospital...
hole punch, having that. Stapler, mine.
toy cactus, you can have that, Beatrice, catch!
cliff, I'd leave you my mousemat, but I'm worried you'd cut yourself.
all right, Donna, have some respect.
there's 2, 000 people in that hospital. And it's vanished!
I'll show you vanishing. Thanks for nothing!
Oh , and you know when that money went missing from the kitty?
Anne Marie. That's all I'm saying.
Oh, don't tell me, the hospital's back!
well, isn't that wizard?
to confirm. The Royal Hope Hospital was returned to its original position.
but with only one survivor.
the only person left alive, is medical student Oliver Morgenstern.
and there were these creatures.
like rhinos. Talking rhinos in black leather...
rhinos?
rhinos could be aliens...
we couldn't breathe, we were running out of air.
a colleague of mine gave me the last oxygen tank. Martha.
Martha Jones. And she died.
least you've got a hole punch.
and a raffle ticket.
Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle, I wouldn't take a penny off that man.
honestly, you two! There's aliens on the news!
they took that hospital all the way to the moon, and you're banging on about raffle tickets!
don't be daft, Gramps, it wasn't the moon, it couldn't be.
I am telling you, it is getting worse, these past few years.
it's like all of a sudden, they suddenly know all about us and there's keen eyes up there and they're watching us, and they're not friendly.
this stapler says Bea.
can't believe how well you're taking it, me getting sacked.
thought you'd hit the roof.
I'm just tired, Donna.
what with your father and everything.
to be honest, I've given up on you.
this further report just in from Oliver Morgenstern.
there was this woman who took control.
said she knew what to do, said she could stop the MRI or something.
Sarah Jane, her name was Sarah Jane Smith.
Sarah Jane Smith was a freelance investigative journalist, formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.
her body was recovered from the hospital late this afternoon...
what's for tea?
I've got nothing in.
I'll get chips.
last of my wages.
fish and chips, yeah?
along with his teenage friends Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer.
it is feared that they also perished.
blimey, you all right?
what was that, fireworks, or...?
I don't know. I was just... walking along. That's weird!
you're the one...
Christmas Eve, I met you, in town.
Donna, isn't it? --What was your name?
How're you doing? You're looking good.
what you been up to?
you're doing it again. -- What?
looking behind me.
people keep on doing that.
looking at my back.
what sort of people?
people in the street. Strangers.
I just catch them, sometimes. Staring at me.
like they're looking at something.
and then I get home and I look and there's nothing there.
see? Look, now I'm doing it!
what are you doing for Christmas?
what am I what?
next Christmas. Any plans?
I don't know, that's ages away!
nothing much, I suppose. Why?
I just think you should get out, you and your family.
don't stay in London. Just leave the city.
what for? -- Nice hotel. Christmas break?
can't afford it.
well, now, y0u've got that raffle ticket.
how'd you know about that?
first prize. Luxury weekend break.
use it, Donna Noble.
why won't you tell me your name?
I think you should leave me alone.
blimey! That's what I call posh!
I said you were lucky! Didn't I always say, my lucky star?
for God's sake, don't tell them that we won it in a raffle. Be classy!
dad, take those things off.
no, I shouldn't, it's Christmas!
I'll have that one, thank you, it's got my liniment in it.
I reckon we deserve this.
it's been a hell of a year.
your dad would loved this.
Yeah. He would.
Oy! Gramps! Get that, that'll be breakfast!
we've got croissants!
why can't you get it? Lady Muck!
it's Christmas Day, I never get up before ten.
only madam there was up with the dawn chorus.
like when she was six years old!
I'm not wasting a second in this place!
how was the sofa?
Oh, yeah, not so good, really.
you know we could've paid for a second room. Oi!
merry Christmas!
merry Christmas. -- Merry Christmas, Dad.
all right!
all right, my darling! Grub's up!
merry Christmas! --Merry Christmas, sir.
we interrupt this programme to bring you breaking news. -- Have you seen this?
nice early breakfast, then we'll go for a walk.
people always say that at Christmas, "Oh, we all went for a walk,"
I've always wanted to do that.
so, walk first, presents later, yeah?
Donna, come and see.
-- What?
Donna, look at the telly.
what does that mean? I don't know what you're saying.
Donna, look at the TV!
for God's sake, Donna, don't just stand there, come and look!
this footage is live and genuine.
the object is falling on Central London.
I repeat, this is not a hoax.
a replica of the Titanic is falling out of the sky and it's heading for Buckingham Palace.
we're getting this footage from the Guinnevere range of satellites.
is that... a film or something?
the Royal Air Force has declared an emerg...
it's gone dead. All of them.
no, but the Titanic?
Oh, don't be daft!
is that like a sequel?
Oh, God rest their souls.
I was supposed to be out there, selling papers.
I should been there. We all should. We'd be dead.
that's everyone.
every single person we know.
the whole city.
can't be.
but it is. It s gone.
london's gone.
if you hadn't won that raffle...
Leeds? I'm not moving to Leeds!
I'm afraid it's Leeds, or you can wait in the hostel for another three months.
all I want is a washing machine.
what about Glasgow, I heard there was jobs going in Glasgow.
you can't pick and choose! All of Southern England's flooded with radiation, 7 million people in need of relocation, and now France has closed its borders, so it's Leeds or nothing...
next!
the Daniels Family, billetted at number 15.
mr & Mrs Obego, billetted at number 31.
miss Coltrane, you're in number 8.
the Noble family, billetted at number 29...
that's us! Come on. Off we go, all right?
used to be a nice little family, number 29.
they missed one mortgage payment, just one, they got booted out, all for you lot.
don't get all chippy with me, Vera Duckworth.
pop your clogs on and go and feed t'whippets.
sweetheart, come on. You're not gonna make the world any better by shouting at it.
I can try.
what happens, do we get keys? -- I don't know, do I?
who do we ask, the soldiers?
is a big house! Room for all!
welcome! In you come.
I thought this was our house.
is many people's house! Is wonderful!
we've been here for eight weeks already.
I had a nice little paper shop in Shepherd's Bush.
all gone now.
so, upstairs, we have the Merchandani family, seven of them, good family, good kids.
except that one, be careful of him.
that's a joking!
Where's that smile?
Rocco Colosanto, I'm here with my wife, and her sister, and her husband, and their kids, and their daughter's kids.
we've got the front room.
my mother, she's got the back room. She's old, you forgive.
and this, this is you, this is your palace!
what do you mean, this is us?
you live here! -- In the kitchen?
you got camp beds! You got the cooker, you keep warm, you got the fridge, you keep cool!
is good!
what about the bathroom?
nobody lives in the bathroom!
no, I mean, is there a rota?
is pot luck! Is fun!
I go wake Mamma, she likes new people.
mamma! Is people! Nice people!
Ah, well...
we'll settle in, won't we? Make do.
bit of wartime spirit, eh?
but there isn't a war.
there's no fight, There's just... .this.
well, America, they'll save us. It was on the news.
they're gonna send Great Britain 50 billion quid in financial aid!
God bless America!
america is in crisis with over 60 million reported dead.
sixty million people have dissolved into fat.
and the fat is walking.
people's fat has come to life and is walking through the streets.
and there are spaceships.
there are reports of spaceships over every major US city.
the fat is flying, it is leaving,... -- Aliens.
Yeah.
Mary Mcginty, do you remember her?
who was she?
worked in the newsagent on a Sunday.
little woman, black hair.
never really spoke to her.
she'll be dead.
every day, I think of someone else.
all dead.
maybe she went away for Christmas. -- Maybe.
I'll go out tomorrow, I'll walk into town.
there's got to be work.
everyone needs secretaries.
soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.
just you wait, Mum.
what if it never gets better?
course it will.
even the bees are disappearing.
you don't see bumble bees any more.
they'll sort us out, the Emergency Government.
they'll do something. -- What if they don't?
then... we'll complain.
who's gonna listen to us? Refugees.
we haven't even got a vote.
we're just no-one, Donna.
we don't exist.
I am going to kill that man!
now, listen, Mussolini!
I am telling you, for the last time, to button it!
if I hear one more sea shanty...
always loved a sing-song.
you stay here!
everyone, stay!
firing at the car, is not so good! You crazy or what?
it's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop, it's like gas, it's toxic.
well, switch it off!
I have done! It's still going!
it's all the cars, every single ATMOS car! They've gone mad...
you... lady, turn round. Turn around!
are you crazy, boy? -- Now!
put that down! -- Turn round!
do what he says! -- Show me your back!
turn around! -- Show me your back!
sorry. I thought I saw...
call yourself a soldier?
pointing guns at innocent women! You're a disgrace!
in my day, we'd have had you court-martialled!
Donna, where are you going?
it's not safe at night!
hello.
it's the ATMOS devices.
we're lucky, it's not so bad here, Britain hasn't got that much petrol.
but all over Europe...
china, South Africa...
they're getting choked by gas.
can't anyone stop it?
Yeah, they're trying right now.
this little band of fighters, on board the Sontaran ship.
any second now.
and that was...
that was the Torchwood team.
Gwen Cooper, Lanto Jones, they gave their lives.
and Captain Jack Harkness has transported to the Sontaran homeworld.
there's no-one left.
you're always wearing the same clothes.
why won't you tell me your name?
none of this was meant to happen.
there was a man.
this wonderful man. And he stopped it.
the Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS - he stopped them all from happening.
that... Doctor?
you knew him. -- Did I? When?
I think you dream about him sometimes.
it's a man in a suit.
tall, thin man. Great hair.
some really great hair.
who are you?
I was like you. I used to be you.
cos you travelled with him, Donna, you travelled with the Doctor in a different world.
I never met him. And he's dead.
he died underneath the Thames on Christmas Eve.
but you were meant to be there.
he needed someone to stop him, and that was you.
you made him leave, you saved his life.
doctor! You can stop now!
stop it!
I don't know what you're talking about, leave me alone!
something's coming, Donna. Something worse.
the whole world is stinking.
how could anything be worse than this?
trust me. We need the Doctor more than ever. I've...
I've been pulled across from a different universe, because every single universe is in danger.
it's coming, Donna.
it's coming from across the stars, and nothing can stop it.
what is?
the darkness.
well, what d'you keep telling me for?
what am I supposed to do?
I'm nothing special. I mean... I'm not...
I'm nothing special. I'm a temp!
I'm not even that! I'm nothing.
Donna Noble, you're the most important woman in the whole of creation.
Oh, don't. just... don't.
I'm tired. I'm so tired.
I need you to come with me.
Yeah, well, blonde hair might work on the men, but you ain't shifting me, lady!
that's more like it.
I've got plenty more.
you'll come with me. Only when you want to.
you'll have a long wait, then.
not really, just three weeks.
tell me, does your grandfather still own that telescope?
he never lets go of it.
three weeks' time.
but you've got to be certain.
cos when you come with me, Donna...
I'm sorry, so sorry, but...you're going to die.
and you! I'll gonna miss you most of all!
all flame-haired and fiery!
Oh, but why d'you have to go?
it's the new law! England for the English, et cetera.
they can't send us home, the oceans are closed, they build labour camps!
I know, but labour doing what? There aren't any jobs.
sewing, digging - is good!
now, stop it before I kiss you too much...
Wilfred! My capitano!
it'll be quiet with him gone.
still, we'll have more room.
labour camps.
that's what they called them last time.
what d'you mean?
it's happening again. -- What is?
scuse me! 'Scuse me, where are you taking them?
where are you going? Where are you going?
where are you going?
where ARE YOU GOING?
I asked about jobs with the army.
they said I wasn't qualified.
you were right.
you said I should have worked harder at school.
suppose I've always been a disappointment. -- Yeah.
you know we'd get a bit of cash if we sold this thing.
don't you dare.
I always imagined, your old age...
I'd have put a bit of money by make you comfy.
never did.
I'm just useless.
you're supposed to say, "No, you're not."
Ah, it must be the alignment... -- What's wrong?
well, I don't know, I mean it can't be the lens cos I was looking at Orion, the constellation of Orion. You take a look.
now, tell me, what can you see? --Where?
well, up there, in the sky!
well, I can't see anything. It's just black.
well, I mean it's working. The telescope is working.
well, maybe it's the clouds.
there's no clouds. -- Well, there must be!
there's not! It was there, an entire constellation.
look! Look there.
they're going out. Oh, my God!
Donna, the stars are going out.
I'm ready.
loadstone testing now at 15.4, repeat 15.4.
ma'am. -- I've told you, don't salute.
well, if you're not going to tell us your name...
what, you don't know either?
I've crossed too many different realities.
trust me, the wrong word in the wrong place can change an entire causal nexus.
she talks like that. A lot.
and you must be... Miss Noble.
Donna.
captain Erisa Magambo. Thank you for this.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
is it awake?
seems to be quiet, today. Ticking over.
like it's waiting.
do you want to see it?
what's a 'police box'?
they salvaged it from underneath the Thames. Just go inside.
what for? -- just go in.
no way!
what do you think?
can I have a coffee?
time And Relative Dimension in Space.
this room used to shine with light.
I think it's dying.
it's still trying to help.
and... it belonged to the Doctor?
he was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.
but if he was so special, what was he doing with me?
he thought you were brilliant.
don't be stupid. -- But you are.
it just took the Doctor to show you that, simply by being with him.
he did the same to me, to everyone he touches.
were you and him...
d'you want to see it? -- No.
go on, then.
we don't know how the TARDIS works, but we've managed to scrape off the surface technology, enough to show you the creature.
it's a creature?
just stand here.
out ofthe circle, please.
Yes, ma'am.
can't you stay with me?
ready?
and... activate.
open your eyes, Donna. -- Is it there?
open your eyes. Look at it.
I can't. - It's part of you, Donna. Look.
it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, calm down! Donna, Donna, Donna! OK.
what is it? -- We don't know.
Thanks.
it feeds off time.
by changing time, by making someone's life take a different turn, like, er, meetings never made, children never born, a life never loved.
but with you it's...
I never did anything important. -- Yes, you did.
one day, that thing made you turn right, instead of left.
when was that?
you wouldn't remember. It was the most ordinary day in the world.
but by turning right, you never met the Doctor.
and the whole world just changed around you.
can you get rid of it?
I can't even touch it.
seems to be in a state of flux.
what does that mean?
I don't know.
sort of thing the Doctor would say.
you liar!
you told me I was special.
but it's not me, it's this thing - I'm just a host!
no, there's more than that...
the readings are strange.
it's like reality is just bending around you.
because of this thing!
no, no, we're getting separate readings from you.
and they've always been there, since the day you were born.
this is not relevant to the mission.
I thought it was just the Doctor we needed, but it's the both of you.
the Doctor and Donna Noble. Together.
to stop the stars from going out.
Why? What can I do?
turn it off! Please.
captain. -- Power down.
it's still there, though.
what can I do... to get rid of it?
you're going to travel in time!
the TARDIS has tracked down the moment of intervention
monday the 25th, one minute past ten in the morning.
your car was on Little Sutton Street, leading to the Ealing Road, but you turned right, heading for Griffin's Parade. You need to turn left.
you've got to go back, turn left. Have you got that, Donna?
one minute past ten, make yourself turn left, heading for the Chiswick High Road.
keep the jacket on at all times - it's insulation against temporal feedback.
this will correspond to local time wherever you land.
this is to combat dehydration.
this is where we leave you.
I don't want to see that thing on my back.
no, the mirrors are just incidental.
they bounce chronon energy back into the centre, which we control and decide the destination.
it's a time machine.
it's a time machine.
if you could...
powering up!
how do you know it's gonna work?
Oh, we... we don't. We're... we're just guessing.
brilliant, just remember, when you get to the junction, change the car's direction by one minute past ten.
how do I do that? -- It's up to you.
well... I'll just have to run up to myself and have a good argument. -- I'd like to see that.
activate lodestone.
good luck. -- I'm ready!
one minute past ten.
cos I understand now!
you said I was gonna die, but you mean this whole world, it's gonna blink out of existence...
but that's not dying, cos a better world takes its place.
the Doctor's world!
and I'm still alive!
that's right, isn't it? I don't die.
if I change things, I don't die. That's... that's right, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
but I can't die!
I've got a future!
with the Doctor - you told me!
activate!
but... Hold on...
but this is... I'm not...
this is Sutton Court!
I'm half a mile away. I'M HALF A MILE AWAY!
four minutes. Oh, my God!
he runs that little photocopy business in Merchant Street and he needs a secretary.
I've got a job!
hc Clements is in the city.
it's nice, it's posh, so stop it!
it won't take long, just turn right.
I'm going left - if you don't like it, get out and walk!
you think I'm so useless.
0h, I know why you want a job with HC Clements, lady.
cos you think you'll meet a man.
I'm not gonna get there.
you're gonna die.
city executives don't need temps - except for practice.
Yeah. Suppose you're right.
please.
can you hear that?
Oh, no! Go back!
Oi! Get a move on!
the traffic's stopping.
something must've happened.
tell him this. Two words.
well, that decides it. I'm not sitting in a traffic jam.
I'm going left! Left...
what the hell is that?
you were so strong.
what are you?
what will you be?
what will you be?
everything all right? - Oh, God...
what was that for?
I don't know!
can't remember. It's slipping away.
you know, like when you think of a dream, and it sort of goes.
just got lucky, this thing.
it's one ofthe Trickster's Brigade.
changes a life in tiny little ways.
most times, the universe just compensates around it, but with you...
great big parallel world!
hold on, you said parallel worlds are sealed off.
they are. But you had one created around you.
funny thing is... seems to be happening a lot. To you.
how do you mean?
well, the Library. Then this.
just goes with the job, I suppose.
sometimes I think there's way too much coincidence around you, Donna.
I met you once. Then I met your grandfather. Then I met you again.
in the whole wide universe, I met you for a second time.
it's like something's binding us together.
don't be so daft. I'm nothing special.
Yes, you are, you're brilliant.
he thought you were brilliant.
she said that.
who did? - That woman.
I can't remember... -- She never existed, now.
no, but she said... The stars...
she said the stars are going out. -- Yeah, but that world's gone.
no, but she said it was all worlds. Every world.
she said the darkness is coming. Even here.
who was she? -- I don't know.
what did she look like?
she was... blonde.
what was her name? -- I don't know.
Donna, what was her name?
but she told me... to warn you.
she said... two words.
what two words? What were they? What did she say?
bad Wolf.
what does it mean?
doctor, what is it?
what's Bad Wolf?
it's the end ofthe universe.
ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.
it can't be.
there's nothing I can do.
Oh, my God!
what is it, who are they?
what are we going to do?
it's impossible.
it can't be!
I'm sorry, we're dead.
doctor, come back!
it's onlyjust beginning.
Signora, your school offers a chance for betterment, escape.
my daughter...
Isabella is 17 now, but what prospects are there for the daughter of a boat-builder?
there's no future for us. No future but you.
I am moved by your concern for your daughter.
I believe protecting the future of one's own is a sacred duty.
Signora she...
...she is my world.
then we will take your world.
I knew it!
say goodbye to your daughter.
now, signora?
why wait?
time ticks.
be brave, my girl. Make me proud.
step into the light, my dear.
that's it.
what say you, Francesco?
do you like her?
Oh, I do, Mother.
I do.
it's me! Hello!
how are you?
the reason for this call is because I haven't told you for seven hours 'that I love you, which is a scandal, 'and even if we weren't getting married tomorrow,
I'd ask you to marry me anyway. '
Yes, I would, because you are smashing.
Oh... Oh. Oh, blimey.
I've... I've... I-I-I...
I'll see you tomorrow.
out! Out! Out!
that's a relief. I thought I'd burst out of the wrong cake. Again.
that reminds me, there's a girl outside in a bikini.
could someone let her in, give her a jumper? Lucy. Lovely girl.
diabetic.
now, then. Rory.
we need to talk about your fiancee.
she tried to kiss me.
tell you what, though. You're a lucky man, she's a great kisser.
funny how you can say something in your head and it SOUNDS fine...
Oh! The life out there, it dazzles.
I mean, it blinds you to the things that are important.
I've seen it devour relationships and plans...
it's meant to do that.
...because for one person to have seen all that, to taste the glory and then go back, it WILL tear you apart.
so...
I'm sending you somewhere. Together.
Whoa! What, like a date?
anywhere you want, any time you want.
one condition... it has to be amazing. The Moulin Rouge in 1890!
the first Olympic Games! Think of it as a wedding present, because it's either this or tokens.
it's a lot to take in, isn't it? Tiny box, huge room inside.
what's that about? Let me explain.
it's another dimension. - It's basically another dimen...
what?
after Prisoner Zero, I've been reading up on all the latest scientific theories.
FTL travel, parallel universes.
I like the bit when someone says, "It's bigger on the inside!"
I always look forward to that.
so, this date.
I'm kind of done with running down corridors.
what do you think, Rory?
how about somewhere... romantic?
Venice!
Venezia!
la Serenissima!
impossible city. Preposterous city!
founded by refugees running from Attila the Hun.
it was just a collection of little wooden huts in the marsh, but became one of the most powerful cities in the world.
constantly being invaded, constantly flooding...
constantly... Just beautiful!
Oh, you gotta love Venice.
and so many people did. Byron, Napoleon, Casanova.
that reminds me. 1580.
that's all right. Casanova doesn't get born for 145 years.
don't want to run into him. I owe him a chicken.
you owe Casanova a chicken?
long story. We had a bet.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
papers, if you please.
proof of residency, current bill of medical inspection.
there you go, fella.
all to your satisfaction, I think you'll find.
I am so sorry, Your Holiness.
I didn't realise.
no worries. You were just doing your job.
sorry, what exactly is your job?
checking for aliens.
visitors from foreign lands what might bring the plague with them.
Oh, that's nice! See where you bring me? The plague!
don't worry, Viscountess.
no, we're under quarantine here, no-one comes in, no-one goes out, and all because of the grace and wisdom of our patron, Signora Rosanna Calvierri.
how interesting. I heard the plague died out years ago.
not out there.
no, Signora Calvierri has seen it with her own eyes.
streets are piled high with bodies, she said.
did she, now? - Yeah.
Oi!
according to this, I am your eunuch!
Oh, yeah, I'll explain later.
veils down, girls.
it's the Calvierri girls.
what do you want? - Where's my Isabella?
what are you doing? Get away from there.
it's me!
girls! Come along!
she's gone.
Isabella! It's me!
what was that about?
I hate it when he does that!
who were those girls?
I thought everyone knew about the Calvierri school.
my first day here. Parents do all sorts of things to get their children into good schools.
they move house, they change religion.
so, why are you trying to get her out?
something happens in there.
something magical, something evil.
my own daughter didn't recognise me.
and the girl who pushed me away, her face...
like an animal.
I think it's time I met this Signora Calvierri.
mother?
mummy's hydrating, Francesco.
and we never interrupt Mummy when she's hydrating.
we were accosted again.
a man made a grab for one of the girls.
the longer we wait, the greater the risk of discovery.
I mean, we've already converted more than enough.
surely it is time to introduce them to my brothers?
I shall decide when we have enough.
if it's more you want, let me take the girls into the city tonight. We could.
we follow the plan.
let them hammer on our door...
beg to be taken.
and what have you been doing?
well... running.
and fighting.
I've been scared. More scared than I thought was...
did you miss me?
I...
I knew I'd be coming back.
he was right. It blots out everything else.
Rory... this is our date.
let's not do this, not now.
we are in Venice and it's 1580.
I know!
flowers, signor?
what was that?
she'll be OK.
where are you... Amy! Come back!
you have my daughter. Isabella!
you're not coming in, stop there! We've told you...
you have my daughter. Isabella!
I demand you let me see my daughter.
Isabella! It's me! It's your father.
I'll arrest you... - Isabella!
Hello, handsome.
who are you?
how are you doing that? I... am... loving it.
you're like Houdini, only five scary girls, only he was shorter.
will BE shorter. I'm rambling.
I'll ask you again, signor. Who are you?
why don't you check THIS out?
library card. Of course, it's with... He's...
I need the spare.
pale, creepy girls who don't like sunlight and can't be seen in...
am I thinking what I think I'm thinking?
but the city. Why shut down the city?
unless... - Leave now, signor.
or we shall call for the steward...
...if you are lucky.
tell me the whole plan.
one day that'll work.
listen, I would love to stay here. This whole thing...
I'm thrilled. Oh, this is Christmas!
doctor!
I just met some vampires! - We just saw a vampire!
and creepy girls and everything.
vampires!
we think we just saw a vampire.
Yeah, yeah, I know. Amy was just telling me.
Yeah! The Doctor actually went to their house.
Oh. Right. Well...
OK, so... first we need to get back in there somehow.
What?! - How do we do that?
back in where?! - Come and meet my new friend.
as you saw, there's no clear way in.
the House of Calvierri is like a fortress.
but there's a tunnel underneath it, with a ladder and shaft that leads up into the house.
I tried to get in once myself, but I hit a trapdoor.
you need someone on the inside.
no.
you don't know what I was going to say!
we pretend you're an applicant for the school to get you inside and tonight you come down and open the trapdoor to let us in.
so you know what I was going to say! - Are you insane?
we don't have another option. - He said no, Amy.
listen to him.
there is another option.
I work at the Arsenale. We build the warships for the navy.
gunpowder.
most people just nick stationery from where they work.
look, I have a thing about guns and huge quantities of explosive.
what do you suggest, then? We wait until they turn her into an animal?
I'll be there three, four hours tops.
no, no, no, no, no, no. It can't keep happening like this.
this is how they go.
but I have to know. We go together. Say you're my daughter.
What?! Don't listen to him!
your daughter? You look about nine.
brother, then.
too weird. Fiance.
I'm not having him run around telling people he's your fiance!
no. No, you're right. - Thank you.
I mean, they've already seen the Doctor. You should do it.
me? - Yeah!
you can be my brother.
why is him being your brother weird, but with me, it's OK?
actually, I thought you WERE her fiance.
Yeah, that's not helping. - This whole thing is mental!
they're VAMPIRES, for God's sake.
we hope.
so if they're not vampires...?
makes you wonder what could be so bad it doesn't actually mind us thinking it's a vampire?
so, basically, both of our parents are dead from getting the plague.
I'm a gondola... driver...
so... money's a bit tight...
...so having my sister go to your school for special people would be brilliant.
Cheers.
have we met?
I've just got one of those faces. - I wasn't talking to you.
she's got the same face... which is because she's my sister!
Carlo, explain yourself. Why have you brought me this imbecile?
Signora, they have references from his majesty the King of Sweden.
What?!
let me see.
well, now I can see what got my steward so excited.
what say you, Francesco?
do you like her?
Oh, I do, Mother.
I do.
then we would be delighted to accept her.
say goodbye to your sister.
tell Uncle... Doctor... I'll see you both pretty soon, OK?
I'll be fine.
there are clothes on the bed. Get changed and wait here.
blimey. This is private education, then?
Hey. Hello.
I'm Amy.
what's your name?
listen, we're going to get you out of here, but I need you to tell me what's going on.
what is this place? What are they doing?
they, um... they come at night.
they gather around my bed and they take me to a room...
with this green light and a chair with...
with straps, - as if for a surgeon. - What happens in there?
I wake up here.
and the sunlight burns my skin like candle wax.
she'll be fine.
you can promise me that, can you?
we're here.
right. OK, I'll go first. If anything happens to me, go back...
what happened?
between you and Amy?
you said she kissed you. - NOW?!
you want to do this NOW?!
I have a right to know.
I'm getting married in 430 years.
she was frightened, I was frightened, but we survived, and the relief of it...
and so she kissed me.
and you kissed her back? - No.
I kissed her mouth.
funny!
Rory... Rory, she kissed me because I was there.
it would have been you, it SHOULD have been you.
Yeah, should have been me. - Exactly.
that's why I brought you here.
can we go and see the vampires now, please?
control yourself, child.
get your hands off me.
psychic paper.
did you really think that would work on me?
push...
come on. There we are.
Where's Amy?
I can't see a thing.
just as well I brought this, then.
ultraviolet. Portable sunlight.
yours is bigger than mine. - Let's not go there.
where are you from? Did you fall through the chasm?
mother this is pointless. Let's just start the process.
hold your tongue, Francesco!
I need to know what this girl is doing in a world of savages with psychic paper.
who are you with?
I scarcely believe your idiot brother sent you.
what are you doing in MY school?
OK, I'll tell you.
I'm from Ofsted.
put her in the chair. - No!
get your hands off me!
Oh, make sport of me, will you?
tease me as if I were your dog?
well, this dog has a bite, girl.
doctor...
if we cancel now, we lose the deposit on the village hall, the salsa band...
what happened to them?
they've had all the moisture taken out of them.
mother...
where you drink from her, may we share?
I'm so thirsty.
of course, darling.
that's what vampires do, right?
they drink your blood and replace it with their own.
Yeah, except they haven't just had their blood taken, but all the water in their bodies.
why did they die?
why aren't they like the girls in the school?
maybe not everyone survives the process.
you know what's dangerous about you?
it's not that you make people take risks.
it's that you make them want to impress you.
you make it so they don't want to let you down.
you have no idea how dangerous you make people to themselves when you're around.
who are you?
we should run. Run!
this is how it works.
first, we drink you until you're dry.
then...
we fill you with our blood.
it rages through you like a fire, changing you, until one morning you awake and your humanity is a dream...
now faded.
or you die.
that can happen. - And if I survive?
then there are 10, 000 husbands waiting for you in the water.
Yeah, sorry.
I'm kind of engaged.
Rory, come on!
cab for Amy Pond?
she bit me!
this rescue plan, not exactly watertight, is it?
Amy! - Quickly, through here!
seal the house.
they're not vampires! - What?!
I saw them, I saw her. They're not vampires. They're aliens!
classic! - That's GOOD news?!
what is wrong with you people?!
come on, move!
keep moving! Come on, guys.
quickly.
get out. Quick!
come on, run!
I can't!
is he dead? - No, he's breathing.
and so in memory of the children lost to the silence, the traitor is delivered to the arms of those she betrayed.
do you expect me to drown?
I'm Venetian!
I can swim!
we can all swim!
something touched my leg.
they're all around me!
they bite!
now leave us.
mother!
change your form...
or my brothers will think they are being fed twice today.
not long now.
it's not long.
long way from Saturnyne, aren't you...
sister of the Water?
no, let me guess.
the owner of the psychic paper.
then I take it you're a refugee, like me?
I'll make you a deal. An answer for an answer.
you're using a perception filter.
it doesn't change your features, but manipulates the brainwaves of the person looking at you.
but seeing one of you for the first time in, say, a mirror, the brain doesn't know what to fill the gap with, so leaves it blank...
...hence no reflection.
your question?
why can we see your big teeth?
self-preservation over-rides the mirage.
the subconscious perceives the threat and tries to alert the conscious brain.
Where's Isabella? - My turn.
where are you from?
Gallifrey.
you should be in a museum.
or in a mausoleum.
why are you here?
we ran from the silence.
why are you here? - Wedding present. The silence?
there were cracks.
some were tiny...
...some were as big as the sky.
through some we saw worlds and people and through others we saw silence...
. and the end of all things.
we fled to an ocean like ours and the crack snapped shut behind us...
...and Saturnyne was lost.
so Earth is to become Saturnyne Mark II?
and you can help me.
we can build a new society here, as others have.
what do you say?
Where's Isabella?
Isabella? - The girl who saved my friend.
Oh, deserters must be executed.
any general will tell you that.
I need an answer, Doctor.
a partnership.
any which way you choose.
I don't think that's such a good idea, do you?
I'm a Time Lord.
you're a big fish.
think of the children.
you're right.
we're nothing alike.
I will bend the heavens to save my race, while YOU philosophise.
this ends today.
I'll tear down the House of Calvierri, stone by stone.
take your hands off me, Carlo.
and you know why?
you didn't know Isabella's name.
you didn't know Isabella's name.
open the gates.
attend!
attend!
the storm is coming!
mummy...
what's wrong with your perception filter?
that idiot child must have damaged it when she kicked me...
now... assemble the girls.
I have a job for them.
you're fine.
open wide.
I need to think. Come on brain, think, think. Think!
think!
if they're fish people, it explains why they hate the sun.
stop talking, brain thinking.
it's the school thing I don't understand.
stop talking, brain thinking.
I say we take the fight to them.
what?
her planet dies, so they flee through a crack in space and time, and end up here, then she closes off the city and, one by one, changes people into creatures like her to start a new gene pool.
got it. Then what?
they come from the sea, they can't survive for ever on land, so what's she going to do?
unless she's going to do something to the environment to make the city habitable...
she said, "I shall bend the heavens to save my race."
bend the heavens...
bend... the heavens...
she's going to sink Venice. - She's...
she's going to sink Venice?
and repopulate it with the girls she's transformed.
you can't repopulate somewhere with just women.
you need... blokes.
she's got blokes. - Where?
in the canal. She said, "There are 10, 000 husbands waiting in the water."
only the male offspring survived the journey here.
she's got 10, 000 children swimming in the canals, waiting for Mum to make them some compatible girlfriends.
I mean, I've been around a bit, but, really, that's... that's...
the people upstairs are very noisy.
there aren't any people upstairs.
I knew you were going to say that.
did anyone else know he was going to say that?
is it the vampires?
like I said, they're not vampires.
fish from space.
aren't we on the second floor?
what's happened to them?
there's nothing left of them. They've been fully converted.
blimey, fish from space have never been so...
buxom.
OK...Move.
come on.
give me the lamp.
go, go, go, guys! Keep moving, go, go go!
stay away from the door, Doctor. - No! Guido! What are you doing?!
I'm not leaving you. What are you doing?!
come on. That's it...
??? Come on.
come on.
come on. Come on!
we are Venetians!
right, to begin, let's fill the sky with fire.
Yes!
in sight of the Lord, protect and keep us!
Rosanna's initiating the final phase.
we need to stop her. Come on!
no, no. Get back to the TARDIS. - You can't stop her on your own.
we don't discuss this! I tell you to do something, Amy, and you do it.
thank you.
yeah... You're welcome.
Oh, my God! What is going on?
the sky, it's like it's boiling.
you're too late.
such determination...
...just to save one city.
hard to believe it's the same man that let an entire race turn to cinders and ash.
now you can watch as my people take their new kingdom.
the girls have gone, Rosanna.
you're lying.
shouldn't I be dead?
Rosanna, please, help me.
there are 200, 000 people in this city.
so save them.
Amy, run!
this way, you freak!
don't!
this... this... this way, you big, stupid, great... SpongeBob!
the only thing I've seen uglier than you is... your mum!
no...
did you just say something about Mummy?
careful!
hit him!
this way, bring him this way!
you stink of fish.
well, I'm hardly going to smell of cheese and biscuits!
Hey! Mummy's boy.
that was lucky.
why did you make the sign of the cross, you numpty?
Oh, oh, right! I'm being reviewed now, am I?
now we go help the Doctor.
Rightio.
open the gates!
??? - It's the Almighty! Look at the sky!
get out! I need to stabilise the storm. - We're not leaving you.
right, so one minute it's, "You make people a danger to themselves,"
the next it's, "We're not leaving you!"
but if one of you gets squashed or blown up or eaten, who gets...
what was that? - Nothing.
bit of an earthquake.
an earthquake?
manipulate the elements, it can trigger earthquakes. But don't worry about them.
no? - No.
worry about the tidal waves caused by the earthquake.
right, Rosanna's throne is the control hub but she's locked the program, so tear out every single wire and circuit in the throne. Go crazy.
hit it with a stick, anything. We need it to shut down and re-route control to the secondary hub, which I'm guessing will also be the generator.
shut up! Shut up.
that's better!
OK.
there he is!
come on!
come on! - Come on!
you did it!
one city to save an entire species.
was that so much to ask?
I told you, you can't go back and change time.
you mourn but you live.
I know, Rosanna, I did it.
tell me, Doctor...
...can your conscience carry the weight of another dead race?
remember us.
dream of us.
no...
No!
now, then? What about you two, eh?
next stop Leadworth Register Office?
maybe I can give you away.
it's fine.
drop me back where you found me. I'll just say you've...
stay.
with us. Please.
just for a bit.
I want you to stay.
fine with me.
yeah?
Yes, I would like that.
nice one. I will pop the kettle on.
Hey, look at this.
got my spaceship, got my boys.
my work here is done.
we are not her boys.
Yeah, we are. Yeah, we are.
Rory, listen to that.
what? All I can hear is...
silence.
there were cracks.
through some we saw silence and the end of all things. '
Oh, look at you both, five years later.
time to sleep.
or are you waking up?
if you're the Time Lord, let's call me the Dream Lord.
two worlds, here in the time machine...
and there in the village that time forgot.
one is real...
the other's fake.
trouble is, Rory, Amy, which is which?
so here's your challenge.
if you die in the dream, you wake up in reality.
ask me what happens if you die in reality?
what happens?
you die, stupid. That's why it's called reality.
pick a world, and this nightmare will all be over.
this is going to be a tricky one.
go on. Go on, it's alright.
I'll see you this afternoon.
and I'll rake those bushes like they've never been raked before, I promise.
I'm sorry about that branch. There were so many apples on it.
I should have cut that brance, but I got greedy.
is it greedy to want to feed your family?
so how come you don't like me?
why do you ask me that?
when I get close to you, you edge away.
no, I don't. -- You did so.
when we were thinning the seedlings in the bottom row.
how am I supposed to show you what I do if I ain't allow to touch you?
you tried to kiss me.
Vera never took any interest in the apples. She hates the orchard.
the is the first time I've ever met anyone, who understand about the apples.
sorry... it made me so happy.
it's alright.
no, it ain't alright. I reckon the stuff about the apples is just words in your mouth.
if you can't really share my pleasure...
I do.
Vera wants me to picking apples from trees that are barely in the ground.
things take time. That's love!
seeing what they need and respecting those needs.
if anyone understands that, it's you. At least I thought so.
I do understand that.
but you edge away when I get close.
why do you find me so repugnant? --I don't find you repugnant.
don't be upset.
I'm sorry if I doubted you. It won't happen again.
I promise you.
when you fended me off, a thought came into my mind that made me ashamed. A thought that you would hate me for.
I would never hate you, never.
what?
Chuck, I've treated you unfairly. It's alright to have angry thoughts.
I thought of turning you in!
I thought of blackmailing you into respecting me.
it means that much to you? It does, doesn't it?
you've really been alone up here, haven't you?
you haven't had anyone to comfort you and I should ask you for forgiveness.
still friends?
sorry... Were you asleep? -- No.
awful lot to do here in Dogville, considering nobody needs anything done.
Jason wants to sit on my lap all the time.
I think you're doing a wonderful job.
you give us all so much. What Mr. McKay said right on the button. right on the button.
he tried to put his hands on my knee today.
Oh, he is blind, after all. Probably an accident.
and Ma Ginger got angry at me for running across the gravel path.
well good. She gets angry at me, which just means that you're one of us now.
you can see through it all, can't you?
I'll tell you, I'm gonna be asleep in two minutes.
what if I don't want you to go to sleep?
I don't think you have a choice tonight.
I do love you, Grace.
I'm glad you love me. I love you, too. I really do.
no, I mean, I yearn for you when I am not with you.
I yearn for you even when we're alone like this.
I yearn to be even closer to you... to touch you, the way that people...
we have our whole lives ahead of us.
the thing that I love about you is that you don't demand anything of me.
that we can just be together.
Yeah.
yearning will only make it better.
thank you for your words, your wise words.
you're welcome.
do you want your shoes off?
Jason, what are you doing here? That's wrong.
the words have to be divided differently.
stop it.
how's that for dividing the words?
this is not a good day. Everybody should leave.
everybody except Jason. Jason, I wanna talk to you alone.
what is it? What's going on?
I can be very bad. I bet my pa told you.
I don't think that. I think there is another reason for this.
I'd love to have you on my lap all the time, but I can't, not with the others here.
when somebody can't do all the things they'd like to do for others, sometimes the people they promised get mad.
that's what Mrs. Henson says.
Yes, that's true.
I suppose I know why you won't let me sit in your lap anymore.
Why? -- Because I've been mean lately.
Oh, come on. I'm sure you have your reasons for that.
I have been mean to the others, too, even baby Achilles.
and he's so tiny he can't put up a fight.
it's not right. -- No, it's not.
I got it coming to me, I know.
I deserve a spanking.
what? I should hit you? I'm not gonna do that.
your mother doesn't believe in physical discipline. I'm not gonna hit you.
I know. She'd be awful mad if she found out you whipped me.
Oh, I just said I won't do that.
it's good having ma on your side, right? It'd be pretty serious if she turned against you.
I am the way I am. If people in this town don't like me, then there is nothing I can do about that.
the fact is, I wouldn't have any respect for you if you don't give me a spanking.
I don't care how much fun you think it would be.
I'm not gonna spank you, Jason.
in that case, when Ma gets home maybe I'll just have to tell her you hit me.
but I just said that I wouldn't!
I reckon Ma will take my word for it.
if you give me that spanking, nobody's ever have to know.
stop it. Get away from Achilles. Stop it.
I gave his crib a shove. It's not my fault it didn't tip over.
don't you touch him. Move away from the crib.
stop it, Jason. Stop it!
all right. You want a spanking. I'll give you a spanking...
come here. Come here!
there! There we go. -- That wasn't hard.
it's gotta be hard or it isn't punishment.
all right. -- Harder!
Oh, this is... come on. All right, that's enough.
that is enough punishment now.
maybe I should go stand in the corner and be ashamed?
I don't care. Stand in the corner. Do whatever you gotta do.
Hey, there is Pa!
he's early. I hope there is nothing wrong.
[Narrator] Just as Dogville had done from its open, frail shelf on the mountainside, quite unprotected from any capricious storms,
grace, too, had laid herself open.
and there she dangled from her frail stalk like the apple in the Garden of Eden.
an apple so swollen that the juices almost ran.
and once again the police had come to Dogville.
I said I'd tell you, to save Martha the confusion about the ringing. But I forgot.
they're already down by Canyon Road.
the fellow in the other car is from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
you forgot! -- Yah.
it is the busy time for the apples, you know.
the FBI?
they were most interested in hearing what I'd seen in the past six months, anything related to that wanted poster.
they asked me if I'd seen any signs in the woods of anyone camping out there.
God only knows what that woman's capable of.
you know, she is not capable of anything.
well, that's what you say. But it sure didn't sound that way coming from the laws.
that's why I felt I had to tell them what I knew.
what did you tell them?
an item of clothing to be exact.
it turned out that it was just an old hat Tom had lost.
but it could've been this. -- Chuck. give me.
expensive, by the feel of it, and your initials on it.
I imagine they'd draw the same conclusion from this as anybody would.
I told the law it'd take me no time at all to find this piece of clothing.
I reckon we got us ten minutes, maybe fifteen, before they start knocking on doors.
why would I wanna run away, Chuck?
I wouldn't try to holler, either.
why would I wanna do that?
it wasn't me who wanted you here.
you were far to beautiful and frail for this place.
you tricked me into feeling that I meant something to you.
it's your own damn fault. I need your respect, Grace.
you have my respect. -- I want your respect.
don't...!
this is wrong.
if I can force the flowers to bloom early in spring, I can force you...
please...
please! Please...
please look at me, talk to me.
we're friends, you and my family.
stop it!
have you seen Grace?
she's at my place.
is she busy? -- Not anymore. Go right in.
[Narrator] Yet again Grace had made a miraculous escape from her pursuers with the aid of the people of Dogville.
everyone had covered up for her, including Chuck, who had to admit that it was probably Tom's hat he'd mistakenly considered so suspicious.
but had to plead with Grace for ages before she finally broke down and unburdened herself.
I have to confront him. I mean. -- No!
I have no other choice. -- No.
no one will accept what he did to you. No one. -- I don't want you to.
I came here with all these ideas and these stupid prejudices.
he is not strong, Tom.
he looks strong, but he's not.
I'm gonna start looking for a way to get you out of here.
[Narrator] The end of the summer had come.
and in Elm Street the second clutch of Dogville's scatty squirrels scooted in and out of the legs of children and grown-ups alike searching in vain for Elm Street's non-existent elms.
the heat had turned the soil among the gooseberry bushes to stone, but Grace did not complain.
she threw herself into her work, happy that it was something you could actually grasp between your fingers.
Hey, Liz! Hey, Vera!
better watch out, Grace. Vera's got it in for you today.
what are you talking about?
maybe you thought he wouldn't tell me?
who?
you hit Jason.
I did.
how could you do such a thing?
I know it sounds implausible, but he was asking for it.
it's true, Vera. He's always asking for it.
I should have done that myself a long time ago.
Liz! -- It's your fault, the way you've spoiled him.
it won't happen again. It really won't.
no. I know it won't, because I'll never leave them with you again.
that'd be far too dangerous for any child of mine.
I've been tired.
well, maybe you should see about sleeping at night, like most folks do.
sleeping at night?
Martha saw a certain Tom Edison sneak out of her shed early this morning.
grace, you won't hear anything from me about whipping that idiot kid.
and I'm also grateful to you for turning Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts.
but on the other hand, I'd expected more from you than that.
but if that's the kind of thing you're after, then I'm sure, with your innocent look, you will do just fine in a place like Dogville.
it's not what I'm after, Liz. -- Oh, no?
we all saw you take his hand to the picnic. Maybe that wasn't flirting?
yes... Maybe I was flirting.
[Narrator] Next day the weather changed. The fog came rolling down from the mountains.
she had sat by Jack Mckay so many times now, but Jack had not got better at judging the distance between them.
on the contrary, where fingers alone had previously brushed her young flesh, now it was a and that remained in place throughout the allotted span.
the hour in the orchard were long now, for the harvest was under way.
and Grace had long since given up arguing with Chuck's perception that respect for cultivation, harvest, and fruit could be directly measured in provision of carnality.
though reluctant to leave Grace alone, Tom wantered around quite often now, lost in thought as he tried to crack the problem of possible escape.
and as Grace's wages no longer found their way to her purse he had stepped in, and together they had triumphantly picked up the last of the seven figurines from Ma Ginger's windows.
what's the matter?
nothing. -- Are the police on Canyon Road again?
no. This is just girl talk.
it's funny you should mention Canyon Road, though... right, Martha?
she was just there this morning. -- Yeah.
on the way home from church... -- You see so much more on foot, you know.
when you're in a car you never notice the apple orchard, for example.
you can only see it from one spot on Canyon Road.
do you know that spot, Martha? -- Yes I do.
and did you stop there to enjoy the view this morning?
it's harvest time, you know, in the orchard after all.
the old masters always loved a good harvest theme.
Redolent, with fertility, not to mention sensibility or even eroticism.
but how silly of me to ask you that, Martha, because you already said you did.
she saw you, Grace.
she saw you.
behind this pile of broken limbs.
with Chuck...
he said it wasn't the first time you'd made advances towards him.
he never told me before because he wanted to spare my feelings.
he's a withdrawn and primitive man, but at heart he's loyal and he is good.
what do you want with my husband?
I don't want anything with your husband or anybody.
what about Tom and the hand-holding at the picnic?
that's different. I like Tom.
but you don't like Chuck.
I believe in education.
Vera!
no. I believe smashing them is less a crime than making them.
Vera. remember how I taught your children.
what? -- Remember how happy you were, when I...
when you what? -- When I taught your children about the doctrine of stoicism and they finally understood it.
all right. For that, I'm gonna be lenient.
I'm going to break two of your figurines first, and if you can demonstrate your knowledge of the doctrine of stoicism by holding back your tears,
I'll stop. Have you got that?
[Narrator] In her lifetime Grace had considerable practice at constraining her emotions, and would never have believed it would be hard to control them now.
but as the porcelain pulverized on the floor it was as if it were human tissue disintegrating.
the figurines were the offspring of the meeting between the township and her.
they were the proof that in spite of everything, her suffering had created something of value.
grace could not longer cope.
for the first time since her childhood, she wept.
grace went to see Tom that very night, and informed him that she was ready to follow his advice and leave the township.
and since Tom had just made up his mind that a third party would be needed to ensure the success of an escape, they agreed that Ben possessed the greatest potential.
but it was a case where money was required, Tom concluded, and estimated, that considering the times and all, ten dollars would suffice for Ben and his truck.
but we don't have ten dollars. -- No. We borrow it.
from whom? -- From Dad.
he has more than that in the medicine closet.
I talk to him in the morning and arrange a loan.
but you have a word with Ben...
it's the end of the week, he's bound to be flat broke.
tell your father that I will pay him back.
of course.
thank you.
you are always rescuing me.
I can't believe that you go on being there for me.
good night.
you should get some sleep.
[Narrator] Grace went to see Ben next morning.
when Grace presented the payment as compensation between friends,
Ben did not object too heartily, considering the trouble he could receive from the rest of the towns-people when they realized what had happened.
perhaps they'd all be relieved that she was out of their lives, but somehow Grace wasn't too sure of that.
Ben agreed to drive her, even though he wasn't out to profit from other folks' misfortunes, as he put it.
I don't wanna profit from other folks' misfortunes. -- No.
[Narrator] The fact was that Ben would have driven to the gates of Hell and back for ten dollars.
and the criminal aspect bugged him less than Grace would ever have guessed;
he had freighted all kinds of things in his day.
the plan was for Grace to hide among the apples.
knowing the exact time to harvest is the greatest art of all, Chuck had said, and the time had come for the apples and for Grace.
grace, where've you been?
if I'd displayed the same indifference to the timing of my chores I'd be in for a whipping.
I'm sorry, Olivia. I had to talk to Ben about something.
june is near to bursting.
she can't use the pot on her own, as you well know.
it ain't fitting to toy with her just 'cause she's crippled and can't help herself.
[Narrator] The evening before the escape Tom tactically thought it best not to press his desires of the flesh too hard upon Grace, and instead he adopted a more sensitive approach.
but there is a right and a wrong time to plant seeds and you can't plant seeds in the winter.
that's true. But I love you...
I know. -- And you love me and we will meet again in love and in freedom.
Absolutely.
I shouldn't be ashamed wanting you, should I? It's nothing to be ashamed of.
no...
no. --No. No. It's lovely. It's lovely that we want each other.
but not this way. -- No.
it's not right.
[Narrator] The next morning, when Grace wanted to slip down to Ben's as invisibly as possible, it seemed to Grace that the entire township was up and about at the same time.
grace! -- Yes, Vera.
if you think that by hitting my child you can get out of working for me, think again.
why don't you just come by as planned, and we'll find something where you won't be able to harm anyone.
at twelve o'clock? -- Yes.
afraid you are gonna loose them?
grace, Ben's hauling apples today so we won't be loading glasses.
but that don't mean you're off work. Dad wants you to repack the whole last load.
maybe you can do it better and we'll have an extra crate.
an old crate like that may not have much value in your eyes, but this is Dogville.
we're not wealthy here.
and if your hands get a bit red, well, I've got a tip about something you can rub on 'em.
we have to wash the flagstones at the foot of the steps again.
dirt has gone blown under the door. I can't get the door open.
where have you been? Harvest is the holiest time of the year.
does it not sound like something you could have said?
I'll be down in a minute, Chuck. I'll bring the crates down.
good.
[Narrator] As Grace hastened to the garage, she grew more and more pleased with the decision to keep her departure under wrap.
there was actually quite a bit of work Dogville didn't need doing that its residents would have to carry out for themselves in future.
Yeah, er, Grace, I don't like having to say this, but I'd like to ask if I could have the money up front.
see, it's always the way in the freight industry.
once you deliver a load you ain't got much to bargain with, if you catch my drift.
of course. Here's the money.
not that this is a professional job, of course.
don't get out... -- All right, Ben.
till I give the say-so!
[Narrator] Canyon Road snaked down the valley and away, and Grace went too, and with every bend the township and its noises faded ever more mercifully behind her.
is something wrong? -- Yeah.
there are a hell lot of a lot of police up ahead.
I wasn't expecting that.
it's more dangerous than I thought. We'll have to go back.
No! we can't do that.
it's just...
if this was a professional transport job, you know, paid proper like...it'd be a lot easier, but...
but it's been paid for...
Yeah, but, in the freight industry carrying dangerous load it cost more.
a surcharge, they call it.
if this were a professional job, I could just charge you.
but Bun, I don't have any more money.
Oh, that's no good then.
you said once, you said once, that there aren't many pleasures in my life.
and you know, I go to Miss Laura once a week.
and you got me to see that it weren't nothing to be ashamed of.
I was gonna go there tonight and of course it costs me.
I mean, not as much as...not as much as a surcharge for dangerous goods, but still..it does cost me, you know.
no, Ben, no... please don't.
it's not personal, Grace. It's not personal. I just...
I have to take due payment, that's all.
I don't. I don't have a choice.
I can't buck the freight in this big craft.
we're parked in the square in Georgetown. Right outside the church.
no, Ben...
this ain't something I'm proud of, Grace. Don't go thinking that.
[Narrator] Grace fell asleep on the long highway, thanks to her healthy ability to push any unpleasantness around her far away.
a generous God had blessed her with the rare talent of being able to look ahead, and only ahead.
and later when the truck slowed down about to reach its destination and she slowly returned to consciousness, she had no way of knowing how long she had slept.
all she knew was that she would be happy to see the light of day again.
and then she heard the dog.
all your fondness for apples seems less and less believable.
you've bruised them.
we had a meeting last night at the mission house.
they said you might be going to try to run away, so when I discovered you'd hidden yourself away on my truck,
I didn't have no choice but to bring you back to Dogville.
in the freight industry we can't take sides.
[Narrator] It didn't help Grace that the first theft ever registered in Dogville had taken place the previous evening, when most people were assembled for the town meeting.
old Tom Edison Senior had a considerable sum of money stolen from his medicine closet and suspicion soon fell on Grace, who had apparently been planning an escape that would surely require funding.
grace chose to remain silent in the face of these new charges.
and then Bill, who had lately improved his engineering skills to an astonishing degree, had, by way of his first design, implemented a kind of escape prevention mechanism.
beautiful it might not have been, but effective he dared say it was.
grace, we don't like having to do this.
we don't have much of a choice if we are to protect our community.
could you... Do you mind moving? Try moving.
it works.
we had to make this heavy enough so that it can only move where the ground's level.
and the ground is level in town.
may I go now?
I have to figure out how I'm going to get into my house.
or is that part of the punishment, having to sleep outdoors?
no, no no Grace.
don't think of this as punishment. Not at all!
bill, he made the chain long enough so that you can sleep in your bed.
grace, six o'clock.
Yes, Mrs. Henson.
I couldn't run the risk of Dad turning me down.
but, they think it was me that took the money.
cause I told them so.
you did what?
first they suspected me, but then I convinced them that it was you, since you were the one using the medicine closet.
Why?
because I'm here to do the thinking for you.
if we are to have the slightest chance of getting you out of here, they can never know how close we really are.
they can't know I'm trying to help you.
if they knew it was me that took the money, I wouldn't be here talking to you now.
please don't disappear, Tom.
I need you.
I'll break this one... with some thinking.
[Narrator] It was not Grace's pride that kept her going during the days when fall came and the trees were losing their leaves, but more of the trance-like state that descends on animals whose lives are threatened, without too much painful reflection.
like a patient passively letting his disease hold sway.
and now that Vera had received proof that it was in fact Chuck who'd forced his attentions on Grace, she was meaner than ever.
had Grace had friends in Dogville they, too, fell like the leaves.
the most towns-people of the male sex now visited Grace at night to fulfill their sexual needs.
it had occurred to the children to give the bell an extra ring every time such an act had been consummated, much to Martha's confusion.
they were embarrassing in the way it is when a hillbilly has his way with a cow, but no more than that.
Tom saw everything.
it pained him, and the sexual visits were a particularly severe blow.
but he supported her as best he could, the way a spider supports, when it has been tangled in its own web by the wind.
Tom!
everything I tried to do went wrong.
I can't come up with the answe I was looking for.
you'll come up with it, you'll see. You're very clever.
we provoked them. -- I wouldn't worry about it.
we provoked them. Now it is time for us to provoke ourselves.
what do you mean?
I mean, by showing them some trust.
it all started with a meeting, so it will be logical to end it with one, too.
you'll talk and they'll listen. They can't refuse to listen.
what will I say? --Everything. You'll say everything.
everything? -- Yeah, the truth. The Truth.
just the truth about each and every one of them.
I don't think they are gonna want to hear that.
I know, I know. It is like a child who doesn't want to take his medicine.
they'll be furious at first, but in the end they'll see it is for their own good.
just don't be hateful. Don't be reproving.
if anybody can do it, Grace, you can.
they'll all realize that this weapon and this understanding and injustice has only one true victim and that's you.
and from there it is only one small step to forgiveness.
you've done some hard thinking, Tom Edison.
I'm sure it is an excellent plan. I'm sure.
[Narrator] If forgiveness was close at hand in the mission house, they were all hiding it well.
it hadn't been easy for Tom to get them there.
appealing to consciences stowed farther and farther away by their owners every day as if they were as fragile as Henson's glasses after polishing, had proved quite a task.
but if one was going, the others might as well come along, too, so nobody could talk behind anybody's back.
Tom had set the scene for Grace's speech.
now she'd have to sink or swim, and sincerity be brought to bear.
while Grace addressed the silent congregation in the mission house on Elm Street the first of the early autumn snowstorms embraced the town.
the snowflakes dusted down over the old buildings as if this were just any old town.
and they played in the brances and twigs from which the apples had hung, but luckily the harvest was home and via the freight industry had found a market despite the ever disappointing prices.
grace had presented her story with clarity.
she had not embellished or understated.
and just as she finished the snowflakes all at once stopped tumbling down, leaving Dogville clad in the daintiest, whitest blanket of snow imaginable.
I don't think it went very well.
it's fine. You did good.
[Narrator] The snow had come early, perhaps too early.
a misplaced augury of conciliation.
Tom looked around, worried: Vera's teeth were clenched. She was the first to speak.
copious lies. Just lies.
Yes, Tom. It doesn't accord with the perceptions I got of this town and its residents.
I'm a doctor, damn it, I don't need anyone to tell me if I'm sick or not.
what do you have to say for yourself, Tom?
maybe it's time you picked sides!
are you for us or against us?
Liz is right. We've been far too indulgent with Tom.
Tom, I got to tell you. Even I have trouble defending that girl.
with your help, which I prefer to think was accidental, Tom, she has managed to spread bitterness and troubles throughout this whole town.
so how do we do it, Tom?
I agree, Tom. You brought her in here. You got to figure out how to get her out.
without her lies and accusations spreading.
I asked you here to listen.
you only came to defend yourselves.
I'm sorry it's quite a blow to me...to see all of my friends act this way, so uncivilized.
your plan didn't work out very well, did it?
you'll think of another one. -- No,
no more plans, I promise.
they asked me to choose between you and them.
that's not difficult on a day like today. I love you.
you may be stronger, it's true, but the ideals, the ideals we share.
you're exhausted. Lie down.
I've chosen, Grace. I have chosen you.
now it is the time! The time we've been waiting for.
we free ourselves of Dogville.
you're right. You're right, Tom. It'd be so easy to make love right now.
they may kill us any minute. It would be the perfect romantic ending.
I know. I feel it too. I love you.
it would be so beautiful, but from ...
we were to meet in freedom.
you're cold now, Grace.
I've just rejected everybody I've ever known in your favor.
wouldn't it be worth compromising, just one of your ideals just a little to ease my pain?
everybody in this town has had your body, but me.
we're the ones supposed to be in love.
my darling Tom.
you can have me if you want me.
just do what the others do.
threaten me...
tell me that you'll turn me in to the law, to the gangsters and I promise you, you can take whatever it is you want from me.
I trust you...but maybe you don't trust yourself?
perhaps you've been tempted, you've been tempted to join the others and force me.
perhaps that's why you're so upset.
all I've ever tried to do is help you.
I'm just asking if you're afraid that you could be so human.
no, I'm not afraid of that. Not in the least.
good.
let tomorrow bring that it's gonna bring.
it's not a crime to doubt yourself, Tom.
but it's wonderful that you don't.
I can't find the rest.
maybe I should go out for a couple of minutes.
take a walk or something... I don't know.
to get it all out of my system.
trudge the streets.
listen to the wind as it passes through the woods up through the valley and all that.
you go to sleep, though...
you go to sleep and I will be back very soon.
[Narrator] Of course it was all a load of nonsense.
if anybody was capable of keeping track of ideals and reality, he was.
after all, it was his job. Moral issues were his home ground.
to think that he might doubt his own purity was really to think very little of him.
Tom was angry.
and in the midst of it all, he discovered why.
it was not because of he'd been wrongly accused, but because the charges were true!
his anger consisted of a most unpleasant feeling of being found out!
it was all quite a blow to the young philosopher!
and realistically enough, he thought that if the doubt was already present, it could grow.
Tom stopped.
he almost began to shake when the threat to his career as a writer dawned upon him.
it didn't take him long to agree with himself that the risk was too great to run.
the danger Grace was to the town she was also to him!
Tom did not like it.
and he was man enough to take action to prevent it.
fortunately Tom was as conscientious as regards his future profession as he was practical.
he allowed sincerity and ideals plenty of room in his life, without getting "sentimental" about it, as he would put it.
throwing away a document that might be of significance to Tom and with him future generation of readers as the basis of a novel or indeed a trilogy, was not an act he was so stupid to commit, although he had to admit that in a moment of weakness he might have said he would.
before returning to the meeting that night Tom opened the little drawer he had open the night of Grace's arrival, and found it still there: the card from the gangster in the car.
[Narrator] The next day the sun was shining in the brisk autumn sky, and the snow was long since gone.
for the first time for ages the pile driver could be heard in the marshlands as it hammered in the piles for what might or what might not be a penitentiary.
grace opened her eyes after an almost unconscious sleep, and was confused.
judging by the light coming through the cracks in the walls, it had to be nearly midday.
"the grey hour" as Jack McKay for some reason called noon in Dogville, being a man of many ideas and proclivities, quite a few of which Grace would prefer to remain ignorant of.
but why had nobody roused her?
nobody had hammered furiously at her door.
not a child had thrown mud into her bed or broken her remaining windowpanes.
now she remembered.
she recalled the meeting the previous day, and puzzled still more.
why had she not been confronted with the outcome of that meeting? Or even killed?
it was quite unlike Dogville to restrain its indignation at any point.
perhaps things had turned out well after all?
good morning, Mrs. Henson. -- Oh. good morning?
Oh, never mind. Liz put her back into it htis morning.
we thought some time off would be good for you.
that was quite a speech you made yesterday.
it gave us all something to think about.
Hello, Liz! -- Hi, Grace.
I overslept.
good morning Miss Grace? -- Good morning.
how are you this morning? -- I overslept.
Oh, that's all right.
Tom. Tom, I think it's Grace.
Hello, Grace. Two seconds. Good news.
I went back to the meeting last night.
I wasn't going to let them get off so easily.
but I'll be damned if the mood hadn't changed.
I wouldn't say we won exactly, not exactly, but I think something very good can come out of this, - something very good. - Why didn't you come back and tell me?
I did, but you were asleep.
and you know, you looked like you needed it.
and that made me suggest that maybe you should have some time off.
and you know, not one single person objected.
that sounds wonderful.
I know it does, doesn't it?
the people of this town they surprise me again and again.
I might even have to revise my theories a little bit.
you know how much I hate doing that kind of thing.
you know, Grace, last night when I came back and I saw you lying there asleep so sweetly,
I was suddenly inspired. I wrote the first chapter of a story.
a story about a small town.
but I haven't come up with a name for the town yet.
why not just call it Dogville? -- Wouldn't work.
no, it wouldn't work. It's got to be universal. Lot of writers make that mistake, you see.
Hey, do you want me to read it to you?
if there is any love in it, it comes from you...
would you be offended, if I said no?
no. -- If I really do have the day to myself, I...
no. No.
two people only hurt each other if they doubt the love they have for one another.
you can read it some other time.
you sit down some place and gaze out at the mountains.
it's what the girl in my novel does.
I'll see you later. -- I'll see you. Good news!
[Narrator] Sensibly, Grace chose to hope for the best rather than fear the worst, and planned to spend the day calmly washing her clothes and herself, which, for some reason or another, she was sure none of the characters from Tom's fictitious township would dream of doing.
and then it was as if Dogville just waited.
even the wind dropped, leaving the town in an unfamiliar calm.
as if somebody had put a large cheese dish cover over it, and created the kind of quietness that descends while you are awaiting visitors.
after two days off Grace had been put back to work, but the quietness remained.
indeed it intensified until on the fifth day it swelled into a strange mood that, all of a sudden, brought all the citizens to the street to listen.
they asked each other if the phone was really still down, or if they'd heard about Ben having had to turn his truck around on his way to Georgetown that very morning on account of a large tree blocking the road.
they were not worried.
"worried" was not the right word, and then Tom spotted the cars.
Tom has binoculars. But you can see them with the naked eyes.
there must be at least eight!
I thought the road was blocked.
they must have come through before the tree came down.
june's bed! The sheets need changing. I'll be there in a minute.
Hello, June.
[Narrator] Grace had just started on the bed, which June had soiled yet again, when an irritating feeling of wasting her time forced itself upon her.
nobody gonna sleep here.
[Narrator] She didn't say them out loud, but even so she was startled by the uttrance that had urged itself upon her.
where had these ominous words come from?
darkness was falling as Grace made her way home from work that evening.
the people on the square overlooking the valley had finally given up hope of seeing anything else now the light had faded.
they trudged up Elm Street in disappointment.
Tom? -- Hi, Grace.
there were some cars, but it's too dark, we can't see any more.
we haven't seen much of each other.
yah, I know. I've been busy with my book, you know.
can I ask you something?
Yeah, anything.
you couldn't bring yourself to throw it away, could you?
the number he gave you that night. You couldn't throw it away.
I told yhou how dangerous that man was. That was stupid.
[Narrator] Stupid or not, Tom was soon a passionate spokesman for locking Grace in her shed that night.
if the vehicles were indeed a sign that the call Tom had placed five days earlier on be half of the community to the number indicated on the card from his bureau drawer had at last led to action, and Grace was now to be eliminated from their lives, it would surely look good if the town had also locked her up.
grace was lying on the bed when Jason was sent up with the key.
grace heard it turn in the lock,
from the moment when they'd finally heard the sound of vehicles starting one after the other from the direction of the edge of the woods, things had moved rapidly.
Tom had arranged a delegation to provide a proper reception.
Dogville might be off the beaten track, but it was hospitable, nevertheless.
welcome gentlemen. Welcome.
the town places itself at your disposal!
I should have a large key to give to you. But I only have this small one.
where is she? -- Secured by this very key.
where is she?
the driving piles for the new penitentiary.
tell me, has the crime rate really gone up in this country, as we are lead to believe?
maybe people just regard things as criminal, because they envy their success?
maybe you have none. I'll get the door... sorry.
voila! As the French might say.
what the hell is this?
who did that?
Billy, put your hand up, put your hand up.
we felt safer, when she had the chain on. You are probably more adapted at handling her kind.
none of us feel able to accept money for just helping people.
I mean not unless it would make you feel better to diverst yourself.
shut the hell up! -- Absolutely.
[Narrator] Grace was no expert in exclusive automobiles, yet she recognized with no difficulty the sound of vehicle that was rounding the corner from Canyon Road at that very moment.
alas, in Grace's memory the legendary purr of the Cadillac series 355C was inextricably linked with another, rather less sophisticated sound: that of gunfire directed against her person.
you need to justify your actions before you shoot us.
that's new.
that could be interpreted as weakness, Daddy... I'm disappointed in you!
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.
you shot at me before.
Yes, I'm sorry. I regret that.
you ran away.
but shooting at you certainly didn't help matters.
of course not. You're far, far too stubborn.
if you don't want to kill me, then why did you come?
our last conversation, the one in which you told me what it was you didn't like about me never really concluded, as you ran away.
I should be allowed to tell you what I don't like about you.
that I believe would be a rule of polite conversation.
that's why you showed up?
and you call me stubborn.
you're sure you're not here to force me to go back and become like you?
if I thought there was a chance of forcing you, but of course that will never happen.
you are more than welcome to return home and become my daughter again anytime and I would even begin to share my power and responsibility with you if you did.
not that you care.
so what is it?
it was a word you used that provoked me.
you called me arrogant.
to plunder, as it were, a God given right. I'd call that arrogant, daddy.
but that is exactly what I don't like about you.
it is you that is arrogant.
that's what you came here to say?
I'm not the one passing judgement, Daddy. You are.
you do not pass judgement, because you sympathize with them.
a deprived childhood and a homicide really isn't necessarily a homicide, right?
the only thing you can blame is circumstances.
rapists and murderers may be the victims, according to you.
but I, I call them dogs, and if they're lapping up their own vomit the only way to stop them is with the lash.
but dogs only obey their own nature.
so why shouldn't we forgive them?
dogs can be taught many useful things, but not if we forgive them every time they obey their own nature.
so I'm arrogant. I'm arrogant because I forgive them?
my God.
can't you see how condescending you are when you say that?
you have this preconceived notion that nobody, listne, that nobody can't possibly attain the same high ethical standards as you, so you exonorate them.
I can not think of anything more arrogant than that.
you, my child... my dear child you forgive others with excuses that you would never in the world permit for yourself.
why shouldn't I be merciful? Why?
no no no. You should be merciful, when there is time to be merciful.
but you must maintain your own standard. You owe them that. You owe them that.
the penalty you deserve for your transgressions, they deserve for their transgressions.
they are human beings.
no no no. Does every human being need to be accountable for their action?
of course they do. But you don't even give them that chance.
all that is extremely arrogant.
I love you. I love you. I love you to death.
and you call me arrogant!
I have no more to say.
you are arrogant. I'm arrogant. You've said it. Now you can leave.
and without my daughter, I suppose?
I said, without my daughter? -- Hmm, yes!
well. -- Yes.
no. No more trouble than back home.
I'll give you a little time to think about this.
perhaps you will change your mind. -- I won't.
listen, my love. power is not so bad...
I am sure that you can find a way to make use of it in your own fashion...
take a walk and think about it.
the people who live here are doing their best under very hard circumstances.
if you say so, Grace.
but is their best really good enough?
do they love you?
grace had already thought for a long time.
she had known that if she were not shot when the gangsters arrived she would be faced with her father's suggestion that she return, to become a conspirator with him and his gang of thugs and felons and she did not need any walk to reconsider her response to that, even though the difference betwen the people she knew back home and the people she'd met in Dogville had proven somewhat slighter than she'd expected.
grace looked at the gooseberry bushes so fragiles in the smooth darkness.
it was good to know that if you did not treat them ill, they would be there, come sping as always, and come summer they'd again be bursting with the quite incomprehensible quantity of berries that were so good in pies, specially with cinnamon.
grace looked around at the frightened faces behind the windowpanes that were following her every step, and felt ashamed of being part of inflicting that fear.
how could she ever hate them for what was at bottom merely their weakness?
she would probably have done things like those that had befallen her if she'd lived in one of these houses, to measure them by her own yardstick as her father put it.
would she not, in all honesty, have done the same as Chuck and Vera and Ben and Mrs. Henson and Tom and all these people in their houses?
grace paused.
and while she did, the clouds scattered and let the moonlight through and Dogville underwent another of little changes of light.
it was as if the light, previously so merciful and faint, finally refused to cover up for the town any longer.
suddenly you could no longer imagine a berry that would appear one day on a gooseberry bush, but only see the thorn that was there right now.
the light now penetrated every unevenness and flaw in the buildings... and in...the people!
and all of a sudden she knew the answer to her question all too well: If she had acted like them, she could not have defenced a single one of her actions and could not have condemned them harshly enough.
it was as if her sorrow and pain finally assumed their rightful place.
no, what they had done was not good enough.
and if one had the power to put it to rights, it was one's duty to do so, for the sake of the other towns, for the sake of humanity, and not least, for the sake of the human being that was Grace herself.
if I went back and became your daughter again, when would I be given the power you're talking about?
now? -- At once!
why not?
so that would mean that I'd also take on the immediate responsibilities at once.
I'd be a part in the problem solving...like the problem of Dogville.
we can start by shooting a dog and nailing it to a wall.
over there beneath that lamp, for example. Well, it might help. It sometimes does.
it would only make the town more frightened, but hardly make it a better place.
somebody happening by, revealing their frailty.
that's what I wanna use the power for, if you don't mind.
I wanna make this world a little better.
that damn kid won't shup up. Says he wants to talk to you, Miss.
can we just shoot him now?
what? What is it?
a man can't really be blamed for being scared now, can he?
no. That's true. -- No!
I'm scared, Grace.
I used you. And I'm sorry.
I am stupid, I am. Maybe even arrogant sometimes.
you are, Tom.
although using people is not very charming, I think you have to agree that this specific illustration has surpassed all expectations.
it says so much about being human.
it's been painful, but I think you also have to agree it has been edifying. Wouldn't you say?
not now, Tom. Not now.
if there is any town in this world would be better without, this is it.
shoot them and burn down the town.
what? Something else, honey?
there is a family with kids...do the kids first and make the mother watch.
tell her you will stop if she can hold back her tears.
I owe her that.
we'd better get you out of here.
I'm afraid, you've learned far too much already.
are you cold, Sweetie. Do you need a wrap?
I'm fine.
you want the curtains opened? You don't need them anymore.
what do you think?
I think we should open them. I think it's appropriate.
bingo, Grace!
Bingo!
I have to tell you, your illustration beat the hell out of mine.
it's frightening, yes, but so clear.
do you think that I can allow myself to use it as an inspiration in my writing?
goodbye Tom.
somethings you have to do yourself. -- Really
that one you're gonna have to explain to me on the way home.
[Narrator] Suddenly there was a noise.
but loud enough to work its way through the final sighs of the timber that was rapidly burning out.
it came again. Everyone heard it.
grace was the first to recognize it.
that's Moses,
that's Moses, she said, and jumped out of the car.
she quickly covered the distance to the dog pen over what, now the buildings were gone, could scarcely be called a street, and certainly not Elm Street as there wasn't a tree left on Dogville's little mountain ledge, let alone an elm.
it was Moses.
his survival was astonishing. A miracle.
no, just let him be.
they will have spotted the flames in Georgetown by now.
some one'll come and find him.
he's just angry because I once took his bone.
whether Grace left Dogville or on the contrary, Dogville had left her is a question of a more artful nature that few would benefit from by asking and even fewer by providing an answer.
and nor indeed will it be answered here!
I was her best friend.
this is what I got for it.
this is my gift from Caroline.
and you said this time he took all of Caroline's imprints?
Yeah. - Where's her original self?
you have a backup?
this was the backup.
alpha mapped his entire brain.
I'll try and piece it back together.
you made me a doll?
then why do I feel like myself?
you are, but it's an imprint.
there's only one place for a doll That's irreparably damaged.
that attic.
they say it's whatever hell you imagine.
this is your worst nightmare?
this is the shape of things to come.
we got it-- the information we were looking for.
I know how to get at the heart of Rossum.
we're ready. - It's time for me to meet Caroline.
Hey, not-not this one.
Aw, come on. You said you'd give me the tour.
okay, well, here it is, all right?
it's just like any other office. Can I have my key card, please?
I want to take you to the roof.
why are you so nervous? Whose office is it anyway?
it's nobody's.
look, nobody's got a bar!
come on, you want to get me fired?
no.
I want to get you fired up.
you know, we really shouldn't be doing this.
come on.
but I... I mean, just in here.
you said you dummied up the security feed.
no, I know, it's just that I, you know, I just don't want to leave any DNA.
then don't make me bleed you.
what are you doing?
what I came here to do.
Oh, god, you're... You're a thief?
I let a thief into the building?
relax. I'm not a thief. I'm a terrorist.
Oh, I am so screwed.
the woman who works here-- what do you know about her?
nothing. I don't know anything.
I work for a security company. I'm practically a temp.
Rossum's not going to give a temp Full access to one of their buildings.
off-the-chart smart.
bet you could kill me with your brain.
what makes you a priority?
full scholarship.
what's in Tucson?
I don't know.
please, just put all this stuff back.
what the hell is this?
I have no idea.
but that can't be in this building.
then let's bring down the building.
see what's underneath.
who are you?
Yes.
we need to know what she knows.
Clyde said there was one person Who had seen his partner face-to-face, and that was Caroline.
she can I. D. the man in charge.
or the woman. - Or hermaphrodite.
say, can we get back to the part Where the chair-less imprinting tech That I designed,
which you handed over to Harding In order to get the swank office back
how that leads to the apocalypse?
cause I thought that was kind of an interesting detail.
it doesn't matter where the tech comes from.
we have to do more than disrupt production.
as long as Clyde's partner is still out there, Rossum will go on.
we have to cut the head off the snake.
and Caroline's the only one who's ever met that snake.
she's been behind the curtain.
now we need for her to take us there.
well, what if she won't?
I mean, you're impressive; you are.
you're carrying multiple constructs.
and something in you Has allowed you to fuse them into a kind of super ego.
but Caroline isn't just one more Personality build you'd be adding to the mix-- She's real.
echo is real.
you're damn right she is.
Ivy's right. We actually don't know What dumping Caroline into echo's brain will do.
your original self comes home to find the house party that's going on inside your head
she might fight back.
she'd lose.
all right.
pull Caroline from the vault.
put echo in the chair.
is that really necessary?
it's just a precaution.
and not an unwise one. Unlike the rest of you, I've actually met Caroline.
are you okay?
I'm good.
we haven't really talked since you... Died.
I guess we've both died since then.
Yeah. Weird week.
so are you finally ready to meet the girl Who started all the trouble In your life?
what?
Janice Charles from my fourth grade math class is here?
okay. We're all set. All we need now is...
Where's the wedge?
gone. - What?!
Caroline's missing.
so, I was like, "you go anywhere near him...
it's very crowded, and you ladies are taking up four spaces.
also, you appear to be finished.
Yeah, well, we're not finished.
I mean, does it look like we're finished?
um, yes, I just said that.
Oh, god, was that the bisque?
did you have the bisque? I had the bisque, and... It's coming up again!
Oh, god.
love your bag.
take the table.
care to join me?
you're not ill?
no.
see, the mistake you made was trying to reason with them.
but I find that even rude people don't like to barfed on.
I imagine that's true.
so I'm just going to guess.
neuroscience major.
how did you know that?
fish. Brain food.
also brain books.
of course. I'm an idiot.
and a genius, probably.
technically.
and you?
not a huge genius.
I meant, what are you studying?
I'm still trying to pin it down.
I see all the things they have to offer, and I figure Once I settle on one thing,
I've excluded everything else.
and there are a lot of things I'd like to be.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
get that thing out of my face.
it's for the video yearbook.
okay, hi, mom.
are we done?
anyone else you want to say good-bye to?
dieter and meg.
Oh, and the girls of sigma tau.
sister's forever.
let's hope those venereal diseases... - She seems so innocent in a way, doesn't she?
unspoiled.
Yes.
she wasn't, you know.
Caroline Farrell left quite a trail of unhappiness in her wake and not a few bodies.
are you saying she's evil?
worse.
an idealist. - And I want to travel.
I shouldn't be at all surprised If it turned out her wedge had got up and walked out of here on its own.
I was glad when I heard it was missing.
it's only natural.
but I didn't take it.
I only considered it briefly.
what can I say?
I want to do everything.
is that too much to ask?
why would echo steal her own imprint?
because she's become a real girl.
and if Caroline were to come back, she might cease to exist or wind up nuts Or very confused.
okay, but it doesn't track.
echo went to the attic for the cause.
whatever that does to your brain Is worse than getting a roomie.
now, this is just Rossum being five steps ahead of us again.
we're there.
Harding was running this place for months.
his people were everywhere.
Rossum could have had them grab the wedge at any time.
we have ignition.
ghost chair's just been engaged.
let's do this.
after Apollo's accomplished Bring Cassandra down for a full diagnostic.
she's been complaining about... That's wrong.
something's happening.
something unintended.
not... Not unintended-- intentional.
cancel this imprint. This imprint's been corrupted.
corrupted from the outside.
school pranks.
this reeks of Topher Brink.
we're in.
she's here. We got her.
is she okay?
is she still cute?
don't you hurt her.
gingersnap.
what is this? What are you doing?
I'm taking you to see an old friend.
we're not leaving yet.
and the flight-- not too exhausting, I trust?
you used the company jet to abduct the programmer of a rival house.
I'm certain I'll be kicking myself come holiday bonus time.
I'm sure you'll be dead by then.
it's a very open space.
quite a lot of beige.
you let them roam.
they roam like free-range chickens.
we keep ours more like veal.
welcome.
you routed through an I-09 to seize control of my chair.
impressive.
topher here is going to explain Why we've gone to such lengths to procure your services.
you won't be getting my services.
but you-you don't even know what we-- what we need yet.
Oh, I don't care.
this man assaulted me.
struck me in my own lab.
I'd like to file a formal complaint.
ms. Halverson, as you correctly noted, you have been abducted.
now, you could be treated as a prisoner or as a guest.
it's entire...
can I get you anything?
a diet soda.
I have some!
I mean, in my fridge.
come on.
well, lab's in here.
you showed me yours.
let show you mine.
I can... I'm all right.
how long do you think before they track her back here?
sooner than I'd hoped, I'm afraid.
damn romantic fools.
I'm surrounded by them.
he couldn't just leave her there.
no, I suppose not.
but I had hoped for an outward appearance of normalcy While we marshaled our forces.
however, any good battle plan must be fluid.
we'll be going into full lockdown mode.
you did a good thing.
did I?
she walked away from me, and I let her.
I never looked to see if she was okay.
she was a person, And now she's... Nothing again.
we'll fix it.
we'll make her right.
once they've done this to you... Can you ever be right again?
imprint wedge.
it's an original personality.
what happened to it?
it, uh... Got damaged last year.
I only kept this around to see if, as an exercise, I could restore it.
like you did with the Hamilton wedge.
you heard about that?
that was legend.
thing is, I still have no idea Which decompression algorithms you used to recover the imprint.
the Hamilton wedge was only missing half its data.
that's a one to two compression ratio.
this is only one to four.
an exponential increase.
failed test pins... Microcracks in the spindle, mag comp corruption...
why do you need this one restored?
would it sound out if I said this could help prevent the end of civilization as we know it?
I would need to understand the context.
you could use perceptual coding to reassemble the autonomic functions, I suppose.
how much data loss would we suffer?
one generation.
no loss. Every memory will be intact.
awesome.
then maybe we could work on the one memory I'd like to erase.
Bennett... I'm so sorry I hit you.
I didn't want to.
God, how I didn't want to.
well, I was trying to kill your active at the time.
you had your reasons.
still... That face.
slugging it.
not my first instinct.
Oh, I didn't think it was.
some form of contact, but not...
who's on that wedge? - Huh?
who are you trying to resurrect?
uh... This person.
it's stupid.
does it... Does it matter?
it might.
it's not like it's Stalin or somebody.
I didn't suppose that it would be a historical figure.
who is it?
ready for your treatment?
I think I changed my mind.
no mind changing. Come on. Back in the chair.
is it so bad right now?
Oh, it's not bad. It's just... Dull.
we're going to make you pop.
I'm not, I'm not sure I wish to pop.
you're gonna pop. And like it.
in the chair.
lay back.
all right. You're starting a big new job tomorrow.
you want to turn heads.
I'll mostly be studying them, And-and there'll be rat heads.
well, you want to look nice for your vermin.
they're largely color blind, though they can detect some ultraviolet.
then they'll love this.
the purple's really going to bring out your eyes.
close them. I'm kidding.
this is your color.
what your color should be.
you'll still be you; just more you.
I've often thought I'd like to be less me.
more like... Well, you, actually.
me?
I'm still undeclared.
you know who you are.
you're so fearless.
I'd love to get a look at your amygdala.
you'd have to buy me dinner first.
no one's ever done this for me before.
washed your hair?
taken an interest.
it's me.
I'd have called. I don't trust the land lines right now.
dewitt's ordered the house into full lockdown.
I think it's time we brought you in.
do we get to have one drink first?
are you scared?
not anymore.
what did you do?
her left arm may be dead, but she's got a terrific right cross.
if anyone asks.
actually, if anyone asks, don't say I got beat up by a one-armed girl.
what did you do to him?
him? - Him who?
I gave him his life back.
you made him a doll.
I had to reconstruct his neural landscape Based on the brain scans alpha made when he damaged it,
but he's still Paul.
same taciturn, self-regarding guy.
no, he's not the same.
he's different.
half his brain tissue was scarred.
I had to do major rewiring, which required healthy brain tissue.
there were two pieces of real estate big enough for the job.
the motor cortex or the cingulate gyrus.
so either he could live his life trapped in a paralyzed body,
or I could take away something else.
me, wasn't it?
not his memories of you.
he's still got those.
our connection.
I think so.
the freshest, brightest paths... Those are the ones I needed.
I think that was you.
Yeah.
you're still bleeding.
why don't you let me do that?
Dr. Saunders?
hop up.
tilt your head back.
how did you-- you mean... You two?
wait.
less talking would mean less bleeding.
and I mean that in so many ways.
so you're the reason Boyd's been All tardy and sleepy the last two months.
glad you're back.
you might not be.
topher, that troublesome one-armed creature-- Where is she?
I had to lock her up.
couldn't leave her in the lab unattended.
and your charm offensive?
mostly just offensive.
when Dr. Saunders is finished with you, Come and see me, please.
right.
Dr. Saunders.
I try to be my best.
of course you do, my dear.
try and have her back on rotation as soon as is practicably possible.
she is, after all, our number one.
ma'am, a word?
three months ago, someone deleted a substantial portion of security footage from the system.
three months ago?
not our system. The main building.
I only learned of it recently.
And?
I spoke to the security officer on duty that night.
he admitted to it.
freely?
loudly. There was some pleading.
turns out he let a young woman into the building.
your office, to be exact.
I'll ask Judith to inventory my files.
I already did. Two were missing.
one of them was Caroline Farrell's.
the security officer Identified her as the woman he let in.
thorn in my side, that girl. I thought we'd finished with her.
she'd dropped off the radar.
you said there were two files missing?
the other one was Bennett Halverson's.
damn.
Halverson is one of Rossum's rising stars.
rumor has it, the man at the top selected her himself.
guess who's rooming with Bennett Halverson at Tucson tech?
who else knows about this? - Just us.
keep it that way. We need to get to Tucson.
Benster. You're home early.
they were doing routine maintenance at the lab.
you broke out the tasty couture. Good choice.
you said it was okay for me to borrow it.
Yeah, totally. Rock on.
I kind of got it for you.
is something wrong?
I wasn't snooping. I just... Went into your closet to find the outfit.
who are you? - Bennie.
who are you?! - I'm Caroline.
you know me.
no, I don't think I do.
where did that file come from? - L. A.
the Rossum office in L. A.
why do you have it?
because I took it.
and it led you to me?
I saw you were valuable to them, which means you're valuable to me, yeah.
you wanted to get close to them?
to hurt them?
a lot.
Bennett Rossum is out of control.
they're doing things, experiments not just on animals.
if you'd seen what I'd seen... - I thought you were my friend.
I am.
then why won't you let me help you?
you're not... Pissed because I used you?
I'm hurt that you won't.
do you want to blow up a building?
Hey, stud.
mother always wanted me to date a doctor.
Yeah.
I wonder what mine wanted.
guess we'll find out.
it's scary, isn't it?
we need Caroline.
we need you.
I keep thinking there is a me, That I'm real,
but every time I talk to someone, they act like I'm doing tricks.
paul never believed echo was a person Even when he cared.
now he's just waiting for Caroline to kick me out.
that's never gonna happen.
look, I never met Caroline Farrell.
I know she drives Dewitt about as crazy as you do, So I figure she can't be all bad.
but I know you. I've watched you grow.
I've watched you build yourself from scratch against all odds.
against us.
you're stronger than everyone here, echo, Even Caroline.
if she gets in there, I think she'll be proud to know you.
okay, I have to put the house on lockdown.
you gotta do that now?
Yeah. Orders.
give me three minutes.
I'm glad you have found something for us.
we were starting to feel like a couple of fifth wheels.
what do you need us to do?
I need you to get the hell out of here.
there's time. Probably not much but some.
I don't want you spending it here.
I don't understand.
look at her.
understand?
we're about to go to war.
you never know what you're gonna lose in a war.
you never know what you're gonna lose anyway.
go. Be with each other Even if it's just for the night.
thank you.
guys... If you somehow forget the way back here, That's okay, too.
Clyde's dead.
Rossum's on to you. They're coming...
he said they're on to us. Probably headed this way.
this could alter our plans considerably.
okay, am I the only one thinking we're getting Maybe a little too much of our intel from the matrix
or possibly Tron, given the outfits?
we'll assume the information is good.
we'll begin evacuation procedures at once.
every active to be brought to imprint, their original personality restored, Then released.
we can dispense with the niceties. I'm not leaving behind a house full of helpless creatures.
behind? Where are we going?
tucson, obviously.
these are the labs with restricted access.
then those are the targets.
you sure you're up for this?
we're in it together, right?
till the end.
go. I'll do my work from here.
you should be above the first lab by now.
copy.
the charge is in place.
ten minutes on the clock?
first charge is hot.
no backing down now.
I'm above a lab just past the L junction.
it's not in the schematic.
set the last charge and move on.
the only reason you build a room That's not in the plans is to hide something.
I'm going in.
you don't have time!
when you get curious, you get dead.
do you read?
Bennett, we have to abort!
What?!
there are people in here! - You can't!
the timers are set!
I have to try and pull the detonator caps!
you have to run!
help me!
run! - I won't!
run! Run!
he was in there too long. He's going into shock.
we need to get him to a hospital.
that's not possible. My entire support staff are engaged in the evacuation.
evacuate him. He risked everything to get his message to us.
put him back in the attic.
it's his best hope.
no. No, you bitch.
I'd rather die.
well, I'd rather you didn't.
see that it's done.
let me take him.
it's done, Mr. Ballard!
she's right.
his best chance is back in the attic.
and we could use someone on the inside When we hit the mainframe.
I don't know you anymore.
I know.
uh, Mr. Ballard, do you recall your former neighbor Mellie?
you insisted she come along. I insist she be someone who trusts you entirely.
we shan't have time for any senate subcommittees.
what's happening?
is this place what I think it is?
Yeah.
are you taking it down?
we're taking it down.
and you found her?
you're Caroline.
he never gave up, you know.
he never stopped looking.
I know.
Mr. Ambrose!
what a lovely late-night surprise.
are you surprised, Adelle?
surprised and delighted.
he doesn't look surprised.
he's paid not to look surprised.
what can I do for you?
you can go with these gentlemen.
they'll escort you to your debriefing.
as of this moment, I'm taking over this house and liquidating the inventory.
I beg your pardon?
let's not play games.
nobody comes out of the attic, Adelle.
there've been multiple breaches.
you're done. Take her.
I don't think so.
well, I guess we can agree this carpet's done for.
Mr. Langton!
what are you doing?
you were working late.
the building was attacked. They'll find you. You'll be fine.
no, you can't leave me! I'm with you!
you're not.
don't leave me!
sorry, sister.
I stay, we both get nabbed.
and I'm gonna make sure it's just me.
don't leave me!
you're gonna bring her back.
I don't think so.
no, you're going to.
or what, you'll hit me?
I considered that.
I also considered letting you go.
I don't want her back any more than you do, But the fact is, I need her.
I need what's in her head. And I need you to get it.
I'll make you an offer: You resurrect Caroline Farrell long enough for me to save my friends,
and I'll let you do anything you want to her.
I will hold the bitch down.
deal?
are you out of your mind?
no, but Ambrose is.
you think a ranking Rossum board member would confine His consciousness to a single body?
when he finds out you've killed him, you'll be a target.
how's he gonna find out?
I'm going to tell him. Which is why you're going to run.
to draw their fire.
it is a war.
Yes, it is.
Claire?
she should stay with the group.
she'll be marginally safer.
Thanks.
thank me later.
what do you know? Term's up!
you're done!
has it been five years?
Yeah, sure, sure.
Sanderson here is going to see you make it back into the real world okay.
five years, huh?
Yeah, so fast.
seems like I just got here yesterday.
last Tuesday, actually.
okay. That all of them?
one more.
you change your mind?
turns out echo and I share some common interests.
give me a hand?
I'll give you both.
that wasn't a reference.
I'm going for a walk.
thanks for grabbing these.
where will you go?
I don't know yet.
I'll have to figure that out on the move.
somewhere they can't pinpoint me.
where is that? - I don't know.
and I wouldn't tell you if I did.
echo's already in danger. I don't want you to be.
it's an understatement to say they have ways of making you talk.
maybe I'll just keep moving. I'll be okay.
you won't be able to go to the hospital if you need it.
some extra bandages if you have to rewrap it.
I'm feeling fine, Claire.
and you'll need these to fight off infection.
fever is the first sign... - Claire!
I'll be okay.
I wish we had more time.
I know.
I'll come back for you.
you understand?
Yeah.
I'll come back for you.
we are now officially evacuated.
topher, I'm going to go in the back and deal with the burn racks.
take a message.
you're using nonlinear transformation for all the cognitive controllers.
Yes, I am.
if you had a Dewey pin, this might go a little faster.
sure.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
more of that if we prevent the end of the world?
Yes.
you know, I always had a crush on you, even when I thought you were a dude.
this is better.
he's in love with you.
I'm sorry?
I was the house doctor.
I used to be number one.
I see.
Yes. Topher mentioned there had been... It's nice to meet you.
is that Caroline?
do you really think you're going to be able to get her back?
I'm confident of it.
do you really think he likes me?
I didn't say "likes.
he's remarkable.
I honestly didn't think he was capable of admitting the existence of another human being, Let alone loving one.
I think you're the remarkable one.
I couldn't find a Dewey pin, but...
I do?
you forced me to come to Arizona.
I loathe Arizona.
we taking her back to the house?
I don't think she's left us with much alternative, Mr. Dominic.
yes?
of course, sir.
I wouldn't dream of keeping her from you.
someone upstairs wants to meet you.
who?
the head of the company you just tried to blow up.
you weren't invited?
no hard feelings, darling.
a trip to see our director Is generally one-way. Enjoy the ride.
topher, I need you to focus. Topher!
Saunders did this.
Rossum got to her.
probably months ago, right after she left this place.
a sleeper?
Yeah.
Boyd loves her.
he'll have to adjust.
I'm going after her.
or not.
we... We can bring her back.
we can bring Bennett back. We can bring... We can map...
there's nothing left to map.
the person who we need to bring back now is Caroline.
can you do it?
good.
okay. I can do this. I can do this.
I got it from here.
you get your chance, you slip out.
in the real world, you can write your ticket Anyplace you land.
I really do want to help you.
then live.
you have a remarkable brain.
I think it should stay In your head.
Ivy. Don't become me.
go. Go!
we're breached.
that's one word for it.
this won't do it.
I was loading the weapons reserve cache Up in the handlers' quarters.
go!
how long?
this is going to take Just as long as it's... Done.
where the hell is security?
assume they're dead. Let's do this.
damn. I just had that replaced.
you should go. Server room service tunnels.
don't be ridiculous.
you're our general. We can't lose you.
good luck, all of you.
stay back!
I've imprinted myself with many useful skills.
you don't even want to know.
hang in there.
someone upstairs.
mistakenly let a woman in.
Caroline's the only one Who's ever met that snake.
enjoy the ride.
hello.
Hey, thanks for coming up.
it's, uh, terrific.
can I get you something? Tea?
I hate tea.
okay. So, not tea, then.
I mean... Look at you.
so, you're Rossum?
um, Rossum is-is just a name, actually. From a play.
although, technically, you're not robots, it seemed to fit.
sorry. Clyde. Clyde Randolph.
the second.
well, like the fifth, actually.
I, uh, I use a lot of bodies.
I'll explain that later.
my partner and I have been quite eager to meet you.
why me?
because you're very special.
you're going to help us in ways you can't understand.
not likely.
you don't have a lot of options.
so I'm going to be one of your zombies?
open up my brain like the rest of them?
you'll never be like the rest of them.
you won't be harmed in any way.
you're... Far too valuable.
and I'm just gonna trust you?
with your life.
uh, I was just sitting because I'm tired.
life of a handler is pretty exhausting.
better you than me.
you just off shift?
for a few hours.
can't really seem to sleep, though.
it's hard to imagine echo being. - did you touch this?
I didn't.
it's not a toy, ballard.
leave the tech to the grown- ups, okay?
so, echo.
it's good, right? - It's different.
not the romance, the other protocol.
I'm not gonnalie to you.
I kind of blew my own mind this time.
one special client request, one minor changeto echo's bodily functions, and I just opened upa whole new world for us.
it's all still new to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but this.
I made code for the brain.
that changed the physical body.
and I'm not talking about muscle memory so somebody can play fancy piano.
I made change son a glandular level.
do you have any idea what this could mean?
explain it to me.
well, arguably, one could program the brain to fight cancer.
or be telekinetic.
or not have that gag reflex when you eat sea urchin. Or whatever.
the possibilities are pretty much endlessis what I'm saying.
I don't want to use the word "genius," but I'd be okay if you wanted to.
so you could do all that me with this chair?
not you. To an active.
I can't fiddle with a mind until it's wiped clean.
the human mind is like van halen.
if you just pull out one piece and keep replacing it, it just degenerates.
Yeah. I don't understand.
but it's so cute that you're trying.
okay.
good talk! Huh? Yeah!
say hi to echo for me.
tell her we're all very proud.
I thought I heard you.
shh, don't wake daddy.
hush, little baby, don't say a word mama's gonna buy youa mockingbird and if that mockingbirddon't sing mama's gonna buy youa diamond ring.
mommy needs to mainline some caffeine.
so you just chill there for one sec.
babe, you want coffee?
Nate, you in there?
Whoa!
good morning.
you're up early. Everything all right?
um, yeah, it's fine. I'm good. -Okay.
I said good morning.
Jack and I were gonna go to the park today and feed the duckies.
that sounds fun. You guys should do that.
you could play hooky and join us.
Yeah, um, I don't think so.
um, could you grab him while I finish the coffee?
uh, I don't, um.
Yeah.
here, you're not gonna break him.
he's not gonna bite you or spontaneously combust.
you've got a master's degree in finance, babe.
this should be a piece of cake.
okay, I'm sorry. I don't, uh.
you know.
I'm, I'm gonna be late for orK.
Te, wait.
will you be home for dinner?
Nah, I've got that, uh, that prentiss thing.
you shouldn't wait up. Bye.
then he was supposed to take jack for a play date with the neighbors, and at the last minute, he's got another meeting as usual.
Nate's a workaholic, em. He's always been that way.
it's more than that.
it's like I hand him the baby, and he acts like I've handed him a live grenade.
well, men are all wusses.
he's the one who pushed having kids right away.
I wanted to wait a couple of years.
well, tell him he has help out. You can't raise this baby alone.
Oh, he helps.
changes the diapers, shops, does the laundry.
he's even read all the books.
okay, now I just wanna swap.
I can't believe how much I love this little boy.
and I don't even know if nate likes him.
or me, for that matter.
Nate's crazy about you.
I think he's having an affair.
em, when was the last time you had a full night's sleep?
I- I don't even remember. -You're exhausted.
your hormones are all over the place.
this isn't hormones. He's never home.
he works all day, and almost every night he's got dinner or drinks.
and then when he is home, he's always taking phone calls outside so I don't hear what he's saying.
that doesn' t mean affair.
then maybe he's doing something illegal. - What?
why would you think that?
I've noticed this black van parked outside the house every day.
I think we're being watched.
no one is watching you, emily.
you're sleep- deprived, and it's making you little nuts.
look, some guys take a little longer to get used to the idea of being a dad.
but it gets better - you sure?
I'm positive.
besides, nate isn't the type to sleep around.
what you need is a night of uninterrupted sleep.
make nate take the baby tonight.
have a glass of wine, put some ear plugs in, and give yourself a break.
things will work out, I promise.
I'm so lucky to have you in my life, kelly.
I'd go completely crazy without you.
that's what I'm here for.
and you're right.
I'm not obsessing about this anymore.
I'm just gonna give nate his space, and let him figure it out himself.
we're just going to find out what daddy's up to, aren't we, baby boy?
Yes, we are!
and if he's got nothing to hide, he won't mind if I go through all his stuff, will he, baby boy?
Hello?
anybody home?
Emily? Are you here?
geez. you... - who is she?
Where's jack?
he's asleep in his room, and you still haven't answered my question.
who the hell is she, nate? - How did you, um?
you're not supposed to. - I knew it.
I knew you were having an affair. -You went into my office.
that's private.
that's my private stuff. -Private?
this is where you and i went on our honey moon.
tell me who she is!
I knew her before I knew you.
I was in love with her.
son of a bitch. - But then she died.
and it was very painful. for me
and it took a long time for me to get over it.
in some ways, I'll never be over it.
but I shouldn't have kept that from you.
that was wrong. i'm sprry
you should have told me.
I know.
you're right.
it was a mistake.
this is all a terrible mistake.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have gone completely mental on you.
I should have just talked to you like a normal person.
I've just been so tired.
why don't you go to bed. Right now.
I'll take jack tonight. That's the least I can do.
we'll talk tomorrow, okay?
okay. Thank you.
things will be better in the morning.
this is a disaster.
now you people promised me something that you cannot deliver.
this is not working. I am calling it off.
get rid of her.
I'll get rid of the baby.
residence of senator daniel perr in Alexandria, Virginia
I think I might have made a mistake.
you think I jumped the gun?
woman: Which gun?
the press conference.
I was hoping when we went public, witnesses would come forward.
what about the man with the tinfoil hat?
didn't he say rossum mailed his liverto saturn?
right now, he's our star.
we have anecdotal evidence that rossum and the other big medsare performing illegal medical procedures and unlicensed experiments.
but that's all it is: Anecdotal.
you have a source at the nsa?
had. Like everyone else, he's gone to ground.
well, you have their financials.
that's a lot of unaccounted cashr ans actions for medical research.
it wouldn't be hard to prove money laundering.
this is nice.
focus.
you're foil- hatman's only hope.
sit. I got it.
I'm not after money laundering.
Rossum crossed a line.
and they've got to be leaning on people to keep them quiet.
they'v got the resources.
there was nobody there.
good morning, madeline.
may I come in?
place looks lovely.
I stripped a lot of it back to the original.
work is good?
you know, I haven't worked a day since I've been home.
God bless you, my dear.
I should feel guilty about that.
I really, really don't.
absolutely not.
do you know how many people would kill to have this kind of freedom?
it's strange.
I never thought I'd be among the idle rich.
you should travel. You're allowed to leave the country, you know.
I don't think so.
I've been away so long, part of me just wants to stay close to home.
is there a young man keeping you close to home?
maybe. I'm not sure.
I thought as much. Do tell.
don't misunderstand. It's nice to see you.
but I have this irrational fear that if I say one wrong thing, men in suits are going to throw me in a black vanand take me away.
not at all.
your obligation to the dollhouse is complete.
right.
so you're just here for a friendly chat?
you haven't come in for your diagnostic.
just because you leave our care, we don't cast you to the wolves, madeline.
I'm worried about you.
I appreciate that.
I suspect you're also worried that I'll flip out and expose you and the dollhouse?
the two worries aren't mutually exclusive.
you know what I'm wondering?
is if this is reallyabout the factthat you let me outof my contract early.
years early.
why is that?
did something happen?
circumstances changed.
I'm not at liberty to discuss them.
for your own well- being, come and have your diagnostic.
I won't take no for an answer. - no
I don't imagine you will.
Hey, where are two going?
Umum, just for a walk.
a walk outside. We'll be right back. -yeah
y-you're holding your car keys.
we're going to the park in the car, and then for a walk.
I thought that we could all eat breakfast together.
I just discovered that I can actually cook something called scrambled eggs, and I don't want to brag, but they're pretty amazing.
you know, that sounds so great, but I'm not hungry.
aren't you supposed to be at work?
I took the day off.
that's. great, baby. - Yeah, it's long over due.
Oh, um, I forgot.
you-you can't drive anywhere today.
why not?
well, I took your car into the shop to get the brake pads replaced, and I forgot the baby seat inside.
I'm sorry. It'll probably be ready tomorrow.
you didn't need to do that, nate.
I know. I'm just trying to help out.
why don't you go back to bed, and I'll take this little guy?
wait. no no
no, no, no. It's okay. Go on.
we're gonna have a little man time down here.
it's time for him to eat.
I forgot, but I should feed him.
all right
just why don't you take a nap when you're done?
promise.
Hello?
Kelly, you have to come get me and the baby.
what's wrong?
Nate won't let us leave. I think he's trying to kill me.
Emily, echo That's crazy.
he took away the car!
just please come and get us! I'll explain everything.
all right. All right, I'm on my way.
thank you.
it's okay.
thank god.
no.
Oh, god.
she's upstairs.
paul: Husband says she's been acting a little paranoid, and she has the kid with her, so let her see me first.
we don't want this to get out ohand.
Mr. jordan, would you like a treatment?
it's okay, baby boy. - What the hell?
don't cry you got to be kidding me.
it's okay, baby boy.
we're going to be okay.
sit down, Mr. Jordan.
I will not sit down.
your zombie took my jack, and you are sitting there drinking tea.
do something!
echo will not harm your child.
she loves him. She is his mother. - I'm sorry?
are you listening to yourself?
she is not his mother.
but she is, Mr. Jordan.
this isn't someone playing make- believe.
in echo's mind, she planned for this child.
carried him for nine months. Delivered him and nursed him.
for all intents and purposes, jack is her baby.
I gave you people money-- a lot of money
and you senda crazy kidnapping chick into my house.
what the hell did I pay you for?
a mother.
you could have hired a nanny, a baby-sitter, but you wanted someone to bond profoundly with your child because you could not bond with him yourself, which is understandable.
I shouldn't have done this. This- this was a terrible idea.
the formative months of an infant's life are crucial.
a child who feels loved is imprinted with the sense that the worldis a safe place.
a child that does not feel loved grows up to be. well.
most likely a sociopath.
what happens to a child kidnapped by a stranger?
I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan, but your was to put up the child for adoption, was it not?
just find him.
we know exactly where echo and the baby are.
and we are retrieving them as we speak.
we're just hitting the bank.
taking out as much of daddy's money as they will let us.
and then you and I areroad- tripping it, sweetheart.
won't that be fun?
officers! Officers!
please help me. Someone is chasing me.
they're trying to take away my baby. - Where?
damn it. They were right there, I swear.
you have to believe me.
my husband's trying to have me killed.
you're safe now.
come with us.
I know it sounds crazy.
I listen to myself and I sound crazy.
but I heard him.
my husband wants to take my babyand get me killed.
it doesn't make any sense. I don't know what I did.
the important thing is, you came to us.
too many women convince themselves they're over reacting or pretend things will get better.
then it's too late.
you have to understand. He's not an abuser.
he's never laid a hand on me.
he doesn't even raise his voice. I'm not a victim.
Yeah, not yet.
let's try to keep it that way.
you have a baby.
some guys can't handle the stress. They snap.
he didn't snap.
he just...went away, you know?
it's like the person I knew isn't there anymore.
it's like he's been replaced by a stranger and I don't even know what I'm saying.
Yes, you do.
and you're lucky you got out when you did.
what's going to happen now?
we'll formally record your statement, then we'll bring your husband in for questioning.
in the meantime, we'll get a judge to grant you are straining order.
that's him.
Oh, god. That's him.
and that's one of the men that came into my house.
detective: Talking to my captain.
don't worry. You're safe. Stay put.
I'll see what's going down.
you can't hurt me in here, nate.
whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work.
you sure about this, Mr. Jordan? - I am positive.
that is my baby, but that is not my wife.
no one's goingto hurt you, emily.
this man is from the fbi.
hejust wants to talk to you, okay? -Stay away from me.
stay away from me! - I promise, you will be safe.
don't come any closer!
No! No! No, don't take my baby!
no, don't take my baby! Don't! Don't! No!
come on! Jack! Jack! -It's okay.
I don't want to hurt you. -don't don't
don't take him! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
don't take him, jack! Don't take him!
72, 65, 58, 51. -thank you.
repeat these words.
boat. Cucumber. Wire.
boat. Cucumber. Wire.
very good.
any headaches, dizziness? -None.
nightmares, deja vu? -no
gag reflex while eating sea urchin?
what?
forget it.
so, uh, I'm not broken?
you're not glitching.
and I haven't found any phantom filesor random memory threads.
physiologically, you're intact.
so, I'm finished, then.
what were those three words I asked you to repeat?
boat. Cucumber. Wire.
clean bill of health.
factory new and no a scratch on you. As promised.
we should put you in the recruiting dvd.
thank you very much.
so, uh, how do i get out of here?
uh, I'll let them know that you're ready to be taken home.
while we're waiting, may I offeryou any additional enhancements?
on the house.
I've been working on some pretty sick apps.
how do you feel about ventriloquism?
so tempting, I'll have to pass.
well, it's a dying art.
No! Let go of me!
give me back my son!
little help? Get her in the chair.
they stole my baby. Help me!
did you offer her a treatment?
gee, that's a great idea, topher.
why won't anybody help me?
No!
no, no, no!
No! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
No! Let me go! No! No!
you knocked her out? no
I can't wipe her when she's knocked out. think
okay, just come on. Put her in the chair.
I'll wipe her when she wakes up.
whenever that is.
what are you doing here?
just came in for a diagnostic.
that was really intense.
you're bleeding.
I remember you.
you do?
my last day here, when i was signing the paper work.
right.
come on. Let's get that taken care of.
looks good.
don't even need a stitch.
Thanks.
you okay?
I don't know.
to be clear, nobody took anybody's baby.
she's an active, like you used to be. It was all pretend.
is it always like that?
like what?
she really believed someone took her child. Heart and soul.
like I said, it wasn't real.
but it was, for her.
all that emotion, all that pain.
was I ever like that?
we're not good for each other.
stop being so cruel! Can't you see this is killing me?
you'll get over it.
you know, I'm kind of new here.
I wouldn't really know.
she'll be okay.
who? - the girl
you seemed worried for her.
she'll forget about the baby. She'll forget everything.
no more pain. No more grief.
that's how it works.
they did it for me.
I had a daughter. She died.
I'm sorry.
she had a cold.
and then it wasn't a cold. It was cancer. Terminal.
and my world fell apart.
within six months, she was gone, and I was left all alone, completely unable to function.
I had no idea.
how could you?
but what I'm telling you is, it all worked out.
I met adelle.
she came to you?
she told meI didn't have to suffer anymore.
I go to sleep for five years, I wake up without pain.
so, what, you. you're happy now?
I'm not sad.
it was nice meeting you.
you seem like a nice man.
please help me.
they're going to do something terrible to my little boy.
I am a nice man.
you're going to be just fine. I promise.
I'm going to make all this go away.
so, you'll help me?
Absolutely.
Hello, echo.
how are you feeling?
did I fall asleep?
for a little while.
shall I go now?
God!
Cindy: What is it?
wiretap transcripts.
this is more than just medical malfeasanceor ethics violations.
this is prostitution.
human trafficking.
maybe murder.
they take people, and they change them into whatever they want them be.
that's not possible.
it's very possible. I read everything about this.
when mom was sick, rossum had the means to help her, and instead, they.
okay.
you know, when we first started looking into this,
I thought this was a game- changer for us, a trophy, the next step upin your career.
I'm scared, daniel.
the power that these people have.
do you want me to back off? -no
no, I want you to do what you promised.
this has to stop.
we're gonna verify all this. We're gonna find proof.
we've got better than proof.
we've got a name.
go, please?
what, precisely, was the last thing she said to you?
I'm telling you, I remember wiping her, and then my face exploded. That's it.
Where's she going?
GPS has her heading to. -nate jordan's house, she's going after the baby.
how can that be? You were supposed to have wiped her.
I did! I'm sure of it.
are we looking at another composite event, Mr. Brink?
I don't think so.
I think we're looking at a genius.
I'm not as comfy with you saying that as I thought I'd be.
think about it: You changed her ona glandular level.
maybe her body was stronger than her brain.
Yeah!
the maternal instinctis the purest.
it's too strong for a normal wipe.
I outplayed myself. like in ess.
not like chess-- like echo was in troubleand pain because you didn't think it through.
she probably can't even remember his name, but she has to have him back, no matter what.
perhaps triggering lactation was a bridge too far.
live and learn.
go. now
well, I guess that's gonna hold. What do you think?
you had a crazy day, huh, buddy?
but things are gonna be okay.
you and me--we're gonna figure it out.
come here, pal.
all right.
I'm going to see about getting a bottle together for you. okay?
now, don't you go anywhere. don't you go anywhere.
Daddy'll be right back.
smells like fish.
Aw, damn it!
hold on, buddy!
I'll be right there.
Hello? -Mr. Jordan, adelle dewitt.
it is imperative you and your son leave your house at once.
what? why?
there's little time for discussion.
our active is on her way to you.
I've dispatched a team to intercept.
get out of the house immediately, Mr. Jordan.
she's coming here? why?
Hello?
No! No!
where are you?
mommy's home.
please. Don't hurt him.
you took away my baby.
why did you do that? - i'm sorry can I please have him back?
I love him.
I don't want to give him to you.
I'm his daddy.
I know that you think that he is. - I want you to go away now.
I can't do that.
babies need their mothers. - i know- But you aren't his mother.- That's a lie!
I don't want to talk to you anymore!
I know that you love jack very much.
but he doesn't belong to you.
and I am afraid that you're going to hurt him.
that's not me.
that's not right.
do you remember?
they turned you into somebody else.
y-you're not real.
none of this is real.
I'm not real.
do you know who is real? -no
I don't.
and I'm sorry.
this is my fault.
I put you through hell.
they made you love jack because I asked them to.
why did you do that?
my wife, karen--she died while having jack.
and I couldn't handle it, and I fell apart, and I blamed him.
I-I blamed a baby. Do you believe that?
and after she died, I needed to find someone who would love jack because I couldn't do it myself.
so, can I be his mommy?
no.
I'm sorry. you can't
Karen is apart of jack.
you aren't.
and he's all that I have of her anymore.
so.
you. you-you can do whatever you want to do to me.
just P. just please don't hurt the baby.
my little boy.
it's okay.
are you okay?
I had a baby.
now I don't have him anymore.
I feel sad.
I'm sorry.
all of these things that happen to me-- I feel them.
I know, echo.
I know you remember everything.
not remember.
feel.
I was married.
I felt love.
and pain, fear.
it's not pretend for me.
they made me love my little boy.
and then they took him away.
they make it so real.
every time, they make it so real.
why do they do that?
I know you want to help me bring down the dollhouse, but maybe it's too much.
I can do this on my own.
I promise I'll get you out. I'll get all of you out.
if you want, I'll tell topher what's going on with you, and he can fix it.
he'll come up with a way to wipe you, and you won't remember a thing.
you won't have to feel sad anymore.
feeling nothing would be worse.
that would be like before.
asleep.
I'm awake now.
I don't want to back to sleep.
it seems pretty clear to me.
because you're only seeing part of it.
I'm talking about a clean slate.
you ever try and clean an actual slate?
you always see what was on it before.
are you volunteering...
I don't have a choice, do I?
how did it get this far?
Caroline, actions have consequences.
Oh, god, you're loving this, aren't you?
I'm sorry you don't understand what I'm offering here.
but what we do helps people.
if you become a part of that, it can help you.
right.
you're just looking out for me.
perhaps better than you have.
we can take care of this mess.
after your five-year term, you will be free to...
I don't deserve this.
I was just trying to make a difference, trying to take my place in the world, you know, like she always said, and now I'm...
I know.
I know.
actions have consequences.
what if they didn't?
happy birthday, man.
no way. No way. You cheated.
how did l cheat?
you did something that will prove to have been cheating. This isn't over.
Oh, my god, you are a sore loser.
Oh, I wouldn't know-- I've never lost.
lost that's okay, the first time, you're always just a little bit sore.
Oh, wow, that's funny, coming from a cheater who is also a little bitch.
you sure you didn't let me win?
two out of three. - No.
let's just dance.
you having a good time?
the best.
listen, uh, I know at the beginning of the weekend, we said no strings.
we also said no ropes, and look how long that lasted.
Yeah, I-I remember. I remember it all.
I always will.
what, like I'd forget?
you think this is a normal weekend for me?
maybe?
I had no idea you were a moron.
look, It's... it's little, it's stupid, but...
I want you to have it.
you're an amazing guy, Matt.
when you say it, I almost believe.
thank you. For everything.
it's getting late.
you're not getting out of another dance.
of course not.
I'm just gonna go grab a drink.
okay.
you ready for your treatment?
I think it's time.
did you have a nice time?
I met a guy.
dude, where's your friend?
it's time for her to go.
had to get to her carriage before it turned into a pumpkin.
what?
stroke of midnight. - Midnight?
the end of the ball.
dude, it... it's like 5: 00.
Hey, you think you could take me back to the party after my treatment?
I'll wait right here.
you're good people.
right.
maybe I shouldn't go back.
the last thing I want to be is clingy, but you know when you just...
you meet someone and... you know?
if I'm wrong, I'll know.
I mean, Matt can't lie to save his life.
if he gives me that look, I'll walk away.
but I don't know, I think he feels it, too.
I think I found something real.
I'm glad.
this is gonna pinch a bit.
you have a nice time?
I met a guy.
I want you to have it.
you ready to be a sad second place, man?
no obligations - really?
no pressure. It's just an experiment.
how much fun can we have in three days?
Hello, Echo. How are you feeling?
did I fall asleep?
for a little while.
shall I go now?
if you like.
everything go all right with the wipe?
why don't you just ask Echo?
Oh, that's right. Because she can't remember.
of course, it went all right.
imprint has gone.
the new moon has made her a virgin again.
is there some reason it shouldn't have?
something happen during the engagement?
I think she finally met the right guy.
you're so jaded, and at such a middle age.
she had fun, right?
she thought so.
there's nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so, man friend.
we gave two people a perfect weekend together.
we're great humanitarians.
who would spend their lives in jail if anyone ever found this place.
we're also misunderstood, which great humanitarians often are.
look at Echo.
not a care in the world.
she's living the dream.
whose dream?
who's next?
I don't understand.
you don't have to understand. You just have to do as I tell you.
they'll find out, you know.
and why should i care about that?
they'll laugh at me. Everybody watches it. It's all they talk about.
that's because their brains are melting, and that reality crap is the reason why.
I finished my homework.
well, if you finished your homework, you should get a present.
how about... Knowledge.
I hate you.
you have that right.
why are we stopping?
you know I could watch it, and you'd never know.
Yeah, well, I'd see it all over your face even when you were sleeping.
some kind of roadblock.
I got to go. And I'll know.
tyrant.
she's completely helpless.
I mean, she's 12 years old, just a kid.
how much are they demanding?
five million.
and you'll pay it.
Thanks.
in Mexico, kidnapping is a thriving business, which is part of why we live here when my factories are there.
but if you pay, there's a better chance...
have you contacted the police?
I was instructed not to.
they're useless, anyway.
I need this to go smoothly. I need davina to be okay.
Mr. Crestejo, you're a valued client.
we will of course provide what you need.
but there is a risk factor involved.
I don't want rambo. I want a negotiator.
this goes clockwork, you understand? That's who I need.
clockwork.
well, our actives are not robots, but I think we can make this work for you.
Mr. Dominic will discuss the security details with you, and you can enter the rest into the confessional.
please remember, the active won't know they came from here.
any discussion of this place will only confuse them, and possibly send them right back.
I know how important it is that not happen.
Yes. Thank you.
I'm terribly sorry for all this.
we will help.
Yeah, this feels very tight.
I think you fell on it with something heavy.
I don't remember.
well, it's gonna be fine.
and your blood work and internals are all shipshape.
I'll just ask one of the staff to work on that knee.
would you like a massage?
they're relaxing.
Yes.
I'll set that up.
I don't remember what fell on me.
does that bother you?
should it?
we'll look after you.
does someone look after you?
why don't you wait in the massage area, and I'll call for someone to work on that knee.
she's not asleep oh. - What...
just keep mapping the tissue.
Hey, Echo. What are you doing here?
she hurts.
she does.
that's because it's her first time, and, uh, we have to do more extensive work on her.
work?
we're making her better.
in a little while, she'll be strong and happy,
and she'll forget all about this and you will have a new friend living with you.
her name is Sierra.
aren't you supposed to be getting your physical with Dr. Saunders far from here right now?
we're ready for your massage, Echo.
something fell on me.
I bet it was something great.
agent ballard, you were assigned to case designate dollhouse over 14 months ago.
how would you describe your progress to date?
slow.
I'm actually very impressed by what I see here.
you've physically threatened a senator, disrupted a seven-year human trafficking investigation, been arrested for trespassing on prince amoudi's yacht.
the only legal action you've successfully followed through on is your divorce.
Paul, let me ask you.
after all this, do you think the dollhouse really exists?
I know it does.
you've seen it then? Take us on a tour?
look, we all know this assignment is a joke.
if it's a joke, then pull me off it.
except you aren't, because someone bigger than you thinks it isn't a joke.
I'm a billionaire. I can hire anybody for anything.
and I'm gonna go to an illegal organization and have them build me, program me, what, the perfect date?
confessor, assassin, dominatrix, omelet chef?
I'm pang a million dollars for that? I can get that.
I have everything I want.
nobody has everything they want.
it's a survival pattern.
you get what you want, you want something else.
if you have everything, you want something else.
something more extreme, something more specific.
something perfect.
put it like that, it doesn't sound so bad.
the only way to imprint a human being with a new personality...
which we've yet to prove possible.
is to remove their own. Completely.
we're talking about people walking around who may as well have been murdered.
which to me sounds pretty bad.
is that why you interfered with the Russians? The borodin case?
they're the top of the heap in human trafficking.
if people are disappearing...
that is an ongoing investigation!
all right? We have a chance to dry up a major pipeline of girls being smuggled into this country, and you do not jeopardize that for a fairy tale!
you will stay out of everyone's way, and you will stop pissing off powerful public figures without any evidence!
you've been out of line, Paul. You have to back off.
you need to keep away from the borodin case. Do you understand?
are you able to back off?
that won't be a problem... Sir.
Hello, Echo.
would you sit down, please?
the situation is a kidnap and ransom, 12 year-old girl named Davina Cresto.
the girl's supposed to be exchanged for $5 million, which her father is willing to pay.
and we are going to help him do that.
kidnapper's Latino, probably Mexican, refers to himself as "Mr. Sunshine."
this is a high risk engagement so you'll have both eyes and ears this time.
audio off a wire, and we'll tap you into his security video on the house and grounds.
anything goes wrong, or feels wrong, you extract Echo immediately.
her purpose is to facilitate the exchange, nothing more.
no one is to be brought to justice.
we'll skip any ex-cop heroics, if you don't mind.
not a problem.
my only priority... - is Echo.
good.
so, who does she think she is?
I'm sorry, who are you?
you asked for me.
I'm Eleanor Penn.
our mutual friend referred me.
I'm sure he did.
I'm a little surprised, though, that he sent you.
I'm good with people. I put them at their ease.
in my experience, a beautiful woman never puts anyone at their ease.
fatherly types do that. They're warm and comforting, make people feel safe.
a beautiful woman distracts people, makes them nervous, or jealous.
I can't afford that. Not with what's at stake here.
I think our friend sent the wrong person.
fatherly types. - Like Edward James almost.
I hope there's no offense.
none taken, and I'm not leaving.
you can hire someone else, give them my fee, but I'm the one best qualified to save your daughter.
I've been doing this my whole life. Just this.
you want people to feel comforted?
we're past that.
these men are stealer professionals.
they took her from your house.
not on the way home from school, or in the park
they came inside your house, your seriously fortified house, in order to tell you that told.
I've dealt with the others-- amateurs, men with a grudge, or an urge.
you want a professional, a man who knows the business.
knows how high the stakes should or shouldn't go.
the percentage of successful negotiations goes way up.
and what's the percentage?
not a hundred. Is her room in here?
I'll show you.
we haven't touched anything.
Glasse topher?
she's nearsighted.
is that supposed to make people take her seriously?
like the librarian thing is gonna hide the fact that she's...
am I speaking urdu?
she's nearsighted, Boyd.
you can mess up her eyesight?
I can mess up the neural connections to her eyesight.
make her brain process the information get any way I want.
as, for example, blurry.
but why would you? Why handicap her in a job like this?
you see someone running incredibly fast, the first thing you gotta ask is, are they running to something, or are they running from something?
and the answer is always both.
so these personality imprints-- they come from scans of real people.
now, I can create amalgams of those personalities, pieces from here or there, but it's not a greatest hits; it's a whole person.
achievement is balanced by fault, by... a lack.
can't have one without the other.
everyone who excels is overcompensating.
running from something. Hiding from something.
the past?
sometimes.
so what's in the past that you gave Echo?
that's her business, Boyd.
she's right for the job.
she's spent her life profiling and negotiating with kidnappers.
that's the person they needed, so that's who Echo is.
the expert.
who's nearsighted.
she also has asthma.
what took you so long?
is this Mr. Sunshine?
where is Gabriel?
he's right here.
my name is Eleanor Penn.
and I'll be handling the transaction.
I told him no cops!
put Gabriel on, I'm gonna cut his little girl so he can hear.
he can hear.
I am not a cop. I'm not FBI.
and I have no interest in justice.
I'm here only to facilitate a private transaction and make sure no one is hurt during it.
no, you're a federale-- you think I'm stupid?
I think you knew Gabriel wouldn't call the authorities if you took Davina.
which was not stupid.
but Gabriel can't do this alone.
he's afraid, and angry, and he knows those emotions are of no use right now.
so you'll deal with me.
and everybody will get what they want.
you may call me Miss Penn.
I may?
I call you miss?
I think I call you Ellie, since we're becoming such good friends.
I will not answer to Ellie. You may call me Miss Penn.
Oh, so you're the schoolteacher now, huh?
what, you gonna rap my knuckles if I'm bad?
it's unlikely.
you are telling me how it's gonna be?
you die.
I have the girl, okay? I make all the rules.
you want $5 million? - That's right.
let's make it eight. - What?
8 million. That's two million apiece.
call back in 40 minutes and let Davina talk to her father.
there's no way you're just gonna give me an extra three mil...
you have the money.
it would have been polite to ask.
they have to get used to doing it my way.
right now, they're getting very used to it.
or they think she's messing with them.
I am. But you'll give them the money.
you have to get used to doing things my way, too.
the last time a family's head of security let their daughter get kidnapped, she was recovered in three days.
his body never was.
speak out of turn again and I will scold you.
how'd you know there was four of them? You said, "2 million apiece."
guy didn't blink.
you heard him not blink?
four's the median number in these cases.
three guys with ambition, one with information.
what more can you tell me about them?
I'll tell you when it's useful for you to know it.
they better put her on.
they will.
in 38 minutes.
you're boss, Ellie.
miss Penn.
what, you don't believe me?
this immigration guy, he's patting me down, he's feeling me up, he's starting to get very personal, right?
I tell him should buy me a drink, tell me I'm pretty, he wants to grope me like that.
Oh, you're a talker, new guy.
it's Lubov. Uh, Velnik asked me to come, give mr. Borodin my respects.
I like a talker.
immigration, he doesn't even crack a smile.
then out comes the rubber glove.
I'm serious.
loomis, I got a name for you.
hello.
you got $8 million for us?
that's right.
if it's that easy, I think we gonna make it an even ten.
what-what are you doing?
you hang up on me again, I chop her up right now!
and I'll use her for bait!
is Davina ready to talk to her father?
you got one minute.
Papa? I'm scared. - Mija...
mija, I'm right here.
Papa, I'm sorry.
no, no, no, Mija, it's not like that.
you just do as the men say, I'm gonna bring you home.
it's okay, it's gonna be okay.
I'm scared.
all they want is money.
they yell at me.
except the one with the mask, he doesn't talk.
it's dark in the room, but I can hear the...
Davina, I'm a friend of your father's. I need to know if they're hurtting you.
not much. But they push me around.
did they feed you?
a little.
and they wouldn't let me use the bathroom at first, but then they did.
it's the small kind...
your father wants to tell you something.
I, uh...
I, uh, I want you to be strong, Davina.
remember that I love you and I will never let anything happen to you.
I love you, papa.
please put the man back on.
the money tomorrow.
I call you at noon to tell you where.
and she'll be there. - Maybe.
there are only two ways for this to go-- either everybody gets what they want, or nobody does.
we will not pay if she's not there.
you told me you're good with people.
I misspoke. I'm good at people.
she was trying to tell me something!
and I needed her not to.
suppose they figured out what she was telling you before you did?
do you think this would endear her to them?
but if we could find her before they do something...
and what, rush in with tear gas?
these people don't handle surprises well.
they get their money or they dig a hole.
you have to trust that I have done this many, many times.
I have to trust that-- right.
yesterday, you weren't a nurse or a clown in the circus.
what?
you're the best, the best one they could send.
why is that? What makes you so good at this?
I don't have any hobbies. - No, no, no. You have to do better than that.
you have to make me believe, believe like you believe. Who are you?
I studied psychology, forensic science, profiling from former instructors at quantico.
been licensed seven years. Handled over 12 negotiations.
why, why, why?
what made you do all those amazing things?
did something terrible happen in your childhood?
did horrible men come and snatch you away?
Yes.
you were kidnapped.
when I was nine.
how long did that... - three months.
and they did things to you.
unprofessional things.
is this helping you in some way? - You don't remember?
maybe it's all made up.
there was one.
he got rid of the others after they were paid and...
all the terrible memories these men put in your head.
why would they do that?
sometimes the bad things just happen and no one can protect you from them.
I'm okay.
I'm fine, I'm okay.
I'm sorry.
forget it. I'd like to get some sleep. We've got a long day tomorrow.
I'll have Maria make you up a bed.
don't move.
Hey, make sure the ladies at my table have what they need, huh?
the champagne never stops flowing.
the good stuff.
for the first few bottles, the good stuff. After that, the house is fine.
you're about to make a very bad mistake.
dollhouse. - What?
dollhouse. Say it.
dollhouse. - Say it again.
your brains are... okay, dollhouse. Doll freaking house.
I'll keep saying it-- it's fun to say.
dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse.
you see the borodins, you say it some more.
you think you want to mess with the borodins?
no, but they supply girls, some of them are very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.
there's one client I'm interested in.
find out who's connected to the dollhouse, the borodins won't be touched, and you'll never see me again.
I haven't seen you yet.
you will.
wash your hands.
and your shoes.
you look better than on the phone, chick.
it's still Miss Penn.
the money.
please. This is not your first time.
let's go. Come on, let's go, let's go.
Davina! Davina, it's okay. Papa's here.
okay... now you show.
we take that on the boat.
your daughter steps off.
you don't move towards her until we are away.
Hey, Boyd, what's going on?
we're good so far. - No, no, Echo's not good.
something's not good, and Echo knows it.
this is maybe your first time.
it's just a condition-- we're not making trouble.
are you trying to bis?
we don't let them on the boat you said that's the way it is.
they're not gonna give her back.
he's not gonna give her back.
no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. She gets off first.
get the hell back. - You give me my daughter!
we need an ambulance. The client is shot.
extract the active. Do it now.
is it bigger than your thumb?
echo. - Is it... is it bigger than your thumb?
miss Penn, look at me.
you can't fight a Ghost.
you ready for your treatment?
you can't fight a Ghost.
it's so dark.
of course it's dark. It's better.
you don't see, you don't make a sound. You forget his face.
whose face?
he's all thumbs.
what happened on the dock? What went wrong?
he doesn't give them back.
who, the man in the mask?
he's old now. He's the same age.
I am proportionately similar to a girl, a small girl.
the older man. You know him.
he's the one that took you. They never found him.
he said he was a Ghost.
you can't fight a Ghost...
but he was heavy, the weight of him.
ghosts aren't heavy.
ghosts are sheets with holes cut out.
he took you away.
and now...
it's unprofessional.
he's taken Davina.
she's proportionately similar to a girl.
he won't touch her until he's taken care of the others.
the other two men?
they'll be dividing the money and make sure there's no tracers, no dye pack.
they'll get excited. They won't see him coming.
six hours. - Before he kills them?
and takes her away.
on the boat?
it's been seen. They were planning to beach it anyway.
it's a houlberd, 30-footer.
it's got a decent range. - And it was riding high.
they haven't bothered to fuel it-- good.
let's place them anywhere from here... to here.
still a lot of choices.
I'm missing something. The man an the phone... what did he say?
the mask.
only one man wore a mask.
because she knows him. He doesn't just have information. He's in her life.
we find him, we find the Ghost.
how does she know him?
something the other one said.
we need to do my treatment now, and we need to do it fast.
miss Penn... - come on, Langton.
a client's in critical, weapon's discharged.
you think I'm gonna let you hold her hand while Topher scrubs her?
two minutes.
you have any idea of the crap that's raining down on us?
handler intervention triggers an immediate debriefing to make sure that we weren't exposed.
we're close.
as soon as I finish my treatment, we'll find her.
he won't do this again.
I need to talk to Dewitt.
you need to tell me everything that went down today.
it wasn't a glitch. The imprint was rock solid.
there was a weird spike last night, but what happened at the dock happened to Eleanor Penn.
or the people we made her out of.
I need you to do this quickly.
I live to serve.
barging in here isn't going to help your situation, Mr. Langton.
echo can find the Crestejo girl.
I'm sorry. He's faster than you'd think.
you cannot wipe her right now.
I can do any damn thing I see fit.
echo botched the engagement.
she jeopardized this entire operation.
you botched it,Ms. Dewitt.
you've her the memory of an abused girl, and you put her face to face with her abuser.
she recognized one of her kidnappers.
and she can find him again.
she's the only one who can.
madam, we need to distance ourselves from this. We don't know if the client's going to live.
this is becoming news.
I'm sorry, Mr. Langton, but this is complicated.
no, it isn't.
echo's in pain, but she's the right girl for the job, and she knows the territory.
she can find Davina before that man lays a finger on her.
you wipe her, you've lost all of that.
we do not have a client!
we have a mission!
we prefer to call them engagements.
you have not been here as long as some of the others, so I will overlook the error.
I've been here long enough to know that you like to tell yourself what we do helps people.
let Echo help this girl.
where are my glasses?
I know how to find her.
it was the first call.
the kidnapper said, "you're the schoolteacher now."
he stressed you're, like there's already a teacher in the mix.
the one in the mask.
check her school. See who's missing.
he's been close to her. He's probably not latino.
ms. Penn, I'm Lawrence Dominic.
security contractor. - Yes, madam.
I have a chopper standing by.
I'll need a radio contact while we're in route.
that'll be Mr. Langton. He's staying here.
she needs backup. - Not from you.
I'm her handler.
miss Dewitt will decide what you are.
James Shepherd, caucasian male, 33. Out sick 12 consecutive days.
has a sister with an isolated house six miles from the dock.
I'm going to need a clean and quiet touchdown with zero chance they'll see or hear our approach.
with respect, the last time you went head to head with these people, you folded.
my man's fully...
your man gives me ten minutes, or Davina will die.
how is she?
see the blue areas? That's fear.
it all looks blue.
that's where I'm going with this.
uh, the persona we developed?
bunch of different people. - Yeah.
and one of them was abused by the guy she ran into.
I know.
Yeah, I looked her up.
she killed herself. Last year.
she never got away from him.
what are we playing at?
it's the woman. - From the drop?
damn it!
who else? You see anyone else?
I'm alone.
please open the door.
don't do it, man.
listen to me.
who knows where we are?
everyone's going to know very soon, Mr. Shepherd.
you left a wide trail, but that's not your problem.
he is.
hell you on about?
soon as that money's counted, he's going to kill both you.
you think we fall for that crap?
turn us on each other?
you tell us how long till they come, you talk.
or I find something to stuff that mouth up.
I think I'm a little old for you.
the man that shot Mr. Crestejo is dead.
you will be identified as the ringleader.
you two haven't killed anyone.
you can let me leave with Davina, and get out of the country very rich men.
the girl's not here.
she's in the fridge.
you unplugged it and pulled out the shelves.
you had to rope it shut, of course, because these days, they don't lock.
we were gonna tell people where she was.
you were gonna die.
beause there's something this man wants even more than eight million dollars.
shut your mouth!
lady seems to know a lot.
I know everything.
all the girls he kept, till he was through with them.
till he got bored, or just broke them down.
I even know about the one he dumped in the river before he was sure she was dead.
it's over.
you can't hurt me anymore.
you can't fight a Ghost.
we're going now. We'll be okay. Here.
go now.
you to wait.
there were shots. We made a call.
we were coming out.
is she injured?
are you hurt?
then get over it.
the money's here. I want it bagged, and our presence swept in three minutes.
you're okay.
you're okay, okay?
you're free.
you're free.
it's a solid win, Madam. The client's stabilized.
we have the payment, plus the eight million.
and both actives performed admirably.
it nearly came crashing down on us.
it was contained. - Yeah.
Yes. Now tell me how we're going to contain this.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, get that thing out of my face.
it's for the video yearbook. Say hi to your mom.
okay. Hi, mom! Are we done?
is there someone you'd like to say good-bye to?
Ditra and Meg, life without you will be meaningless and bleak, my dormies.
Oh, and the girls of sigma omicron tau, sisters forever.
let's hope those venereal diseases make you all sterile, you snobby-ass pack of hos.
Oh, that's definitely going in.
so, what are you planning on doing after graduation?
Yeah, I probably should have thought about that.
I'd like to take my place in the world, like Mrs. Dundee taught us.
global recovery, doctors without borders.
the world is in need of some serious saving.
and I want to travel. Travel around the world as I save it.
in a private jet that I pilot and design.
okay, go ahead and laugh, yearbook monkey.
I know: I'm such a cliche.
what can I say?
I want to do everything.
is that too much to ask?
it seems pretty clear to me.
because you're only seeing part of it.
I'm talking about a clean slate.
you ever try and clean an actual slate?
you always see what was on it before.
are you volunteering...-I don't have a choice, do I?
how did it get this far?
actions have consequences.
Oh, God, you're loving this, aren't you?
I'm sorry you don't understand what I'm offering here.
but what we do helps people.
if you become a part of that, it can help you.
right.
you're just looking out for me.
perhaps better than you have.
we can take care of this mess.
after your five-year term, you will be free to...
I don't deserve this.
I was just trying to make a difference, trying to...
take my place in the world, you know, like she always said, and now I'm...
I know.
I know.
actions have consequences.
what if they didn't?
happy birthday, man.
no way.
no way.
you cheated.
how did l cheat?
you did something that will prove to have been cheating.
this isn't over.
Oh, my God, you are a sore loser.
Oh, I wouldn't know...I've never lost.
that's okay, the first time, you're always just a little bit sore.
Oh, wow, that's funny, coming from a cheater who is also a little bitch.
you sure you didn't let me win?
two out of three.
Nah. Huh?
let's just dance.
you having a good time?
the best.
listen, uh, I know at the beginning of the weekend, we said no strings.
we also said no ropes, and look how long that lasted.
Yeah, I remember.
I remember it all.
I always will.
what, like I'd forget?
you think this is a normal weekend for me?
maybe?
I had no idea you were a moron.
look, it's... it's little, it's stupid, but...
I want you to have it.
you're an amazing guy, Matt.
when you say it, I almost believe.
thank you.
for everything.
it's getting late.
you're not getting out of another dance.
of course not.
I'm just gonna go grab a drink.
okay.
you ready for your treatment?
I think it's time.
did you have a nice time?
I met a guy.
dude, where's your friend?
it's time for her to go.
had to get to her carriage before it turned into a pumpkin.
what?
stroke of midnight.
midnight?
the end of the ball.
dude, it...it's like 5: 00.
Hey, you think you could take me back to the party after my treatment?
I'll wait right here.
you're good people.
right.
maybe I shouldn't go back.
the last thing I want to be is clingy, but you know when you just...
you meet someone and... you know?
if I'm wrong, I'll know.
I mean, Matt can't lie to save his life.
if he gives me that look, I'll walk away.
but I don't know, I think...
he feels it, too.
I think I found something real.
I'm glad.
this is gonna pinch a bit.
you have a nice time?
I met a guy.
I want you to have it.
you ready to be a sad second place, man?
no obligations.
Really?
no pressure.
it's just an experiment.
how much fun can we have in three days?
Hello, Echo.
how are you feeling?
did I fall asleep?
for a little while.
shall I go now?
if you like.
everything go all right with the wipe?
why don't you just ask Echo?
Oh, that's right.
because she can't remember.
of course, it went all right.
imprint's gone.
the new moon has made her a virgin again.
is there some reason it shouldn't have?
something happen during the engagement?
I think she finally met the right guy.
you're so jaded, and at such a middle age.
she had fun, right?
she thought so.
there's nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so, man friend.
we gave two people a perfect weekend together.
we're great humanitarians.
who would spend their lives in jail if anyone ever found this place.
we're also misunderstood...
which great humanitarians often are.
look at Echo.
not a care in the world.
she's living the dream.
whose dream?
who's next?
I don't understand.
you don't have to understand.
you just have to do as I tell you.
they'll find out, you know.
and why should I care about that?
they'll laugh at me.
everybody watches it.
it's all they talk about.
that's cause their brains are melting, and that reality crap is the reason why.
I finished my homework.
well, if you finished your homework, you should get a present.
how about...
knowledge.
I hate you.
you have that right.
why are we stopping?
you know I could watch it, and you'd never know.
Yeah, well, I'd see it all over your face even when you were sleeping.
some kind of roadblock.
I got to go.
and I'll know.
tyrant.
she's completely helpless.
I mean, she's 12 years old, just a kid.
how much are they demanding?
five million.
and you'll pay it.
Thanks.
in Mexico, kidnapping is a thriving business, which is part of why we live here when my factories are there.
but if you pay, there's a better chance...
have you contacted the police?
I was instructed not to.
they're useless, anyway.
I need this to go smoothly.
I need Davina to be okay.
Mr. Crestejo, you're a valued client.
we will of course provide what you need.
but there is a risk factor involved.
I don't want Rambo.
I want a negotiator.
this goes like clockwork, you understand?
that's who I need.
clockwork.
well, our Actives are not robots, but I think we can make this work for you.
Mr. Dominic will discuss the security details with you, and you can enter the rest into the confessional.
please remember, the Active won't know they came from here.
any discussion of this place will only confuse them, and possibly send them right back.
I know how important it is that not happen.
Yes.
thank you.
I'm terribly sorry for all this.
we will help.
Ow!
Yeah, this feels very tight.
I think you fell on it with something heavy.
I don't remember.
well, it's gonna be fine.
and your blood work and internals are all shipshape.
I'll just ask one of the staff to work on that knee.
would you like a massage?
they're relaxing.
Yes.
I'll set that up.
I don't remember what fell on me.
does that bother you?
should it?
we'll look after you.
does someone look after you?
why don't you wait in the massage area, and
I'll call for someone to work on that knee.
she's not asleep.
Oh. What...? Just keep mapping the tissue.
what are you doing here?
she hurts.
she does.
that's because it's her first time, and, uh, we have to do more extensive work on her.
work?
we're making her better.
in a little while, she'll be strong and happy, and she'll forget all about this and you...
will have a new friend living with you.
her name is Sierra.
Mm-hmm.
aren't you supposed to be getting your physical with Dr. Saunders far from here right now?
we're ready for your massage, Echo.
something fell on me.
I bet it was something great.
agent Ballard, you were assigned to case designate
dollhouse over 14 months ago.
how would you describe your progress to date?
slow.
I'm actually very impressed by what I see here.
you've physically threatened a senator, disrupted a seven-year human trafficking investigation, been arrested for trespassing on Prince Amoudi's yacht.
the only legal action you've successfully followed through on is your divorce.
Paul, let me ask you.
after all this, do you think the Dollhouse really exists?
I know it does.
you've seen it then?
you could, like, take us on a tour?
look, we all know this assignment is a joke.
if it's a joke, then pull me off it.
except you can't, because someone bigger than you thinks it isn't a joke.
I'm a billionaire.
I can hire anybody for anything.
and I'm gonna go to an illegal organization and have them build me, program me, what, the perfect date?
confessor, assassin, dominatrix, omelet chef?
I'm paying a million dollars for that?
I can get that.
I have everything I want.
nobody has everything they want.
it's a survival pattern.
you get what you want, you want something else.
if you have everything, you want something else.
something more extreme, something more specific.
something perfect.
put it like that, it doesn't sound so bad.
the only way to imprint a human being with a new personality...
which we've yet to prove possible.
...is to remove their own.
completely.
we're talking about people walking around who may as well have been murdered.
which to me sounds pretty bad.
is that why you interfered with the Russians?
the Borodin case?
they're the top of the heap in human trafficking.
if people are disappearing...
that is an ongoing investigation!
all right?
we have a chance to dry up a major pipeline of girls being smuggled into this country, and you do not jeopardize that for a fairy tale!
you will stay out of everyone's way and you will stop pissing off powerful public figures without any evidence!
you've been out of line, Paul.
you have to back off.
you need to keep away from the Borodin case.
do you understand?
are you able to back off?
that won't be a problem... sir.
Hello, Echo.
would you sit down, please?
the situation is a kidnap and ransom 12 year-old girl named Davina Crestejo.
the girl's supposed to be exchanged for $5 million, which her father is willing to pay.
and we are going to help him do that.
kidnapper's Latino, probably Mexican, refers to himself as "Mr. Sunshine.
this is a high risk engagement so you'll have both eyes and ears this time.
audio off a wire, and we'll tap you into his security vid on the house and grounds.
anything goes wrong or feels wrong you extract Echo immediately.
her purpose is to facilitate the exchange nothing more.
no one is to be brought to justice.
we'll skip any ex-cop heroics if you don't mind.
not a problem.
my only priority... Is Echo.
good.
so who does she think she is?
I'm sorry, who are you?
you asked for me.
I'm here to help.
our mutual friend referred me.
I'm sure he did.
I'm a little surprised though that he sent you.
I'm good with people.
I put them at their ease.
in my experience a beautiful woman never puts anyone at their ease.
fatherly types do that.
they're warm and comforting, make people feel safe.
a beautiful woman distracts people makes them nervous, or jealous.
I can't afford that.
not with what's at stake here.
I think our friend sent the wrong person.
fatherly types.
like Edward James Almos.
I hope there's no offense.
none taken, and I'm not leaving.
you can hire someone else, give them my fee but I'm the one best qualified to save your daughter.
I've been doing this my whole life.
just this.
you want people to feel comforted?
we're past that.
these men are stone professionals.
they took her from your house.
not on the way home from school or in the park...
they came inside your house your seriously fortified house in order to tell you that they could.
I've dealt with the others...
amateurs, men with a grudge or an urge.
you want a professional, a man who knows the business.
knows how high the stakes should or shouldn't go.
the percentage of successful negotiations goes way up.
and what's the percentage?
not a hundred.
is her room in here?
I'll show you.
we haven't touched anything.
glasses, Topher?
she's nearsighted.
is that supposed to make people take her seriously?
like the librarian thing is gonna hide the fact that she's...
am I speaking Urdu?
she's nearsighted, Boyd.
you can mess up her eyesight?
I can mess up the neural connections to her eyesight.
make her brain process the information it gets any way I want.
as, for example，blurry.
but why would you?
why handicap her in a job like this?
you see someone running incredibly fast the first thing you gotta ask is are they running to something or are they running from something?
and the answer is always both.
so these personality imprints...
they come from scans of real people.
now I can create amalgams of those personalities pieces from here or there, but it's not a greatest hits it's a whole person.
achievement is balanced by fault by... a lack.
can't have one without the other.
everyone who excels is overcompensating.
running from something.
hiding from something.
the past?
sometimes.
so what's in the past that you gave Echo?
that's her business, Boyd.
she's right for the job.
she's spent her life profiling and negotiating with kidnappers.
that's the person they needed so that's who Echo is.
the expert.
who's nearsighted.
she also has asthma.
what took you so long?
is this Mr. Sunshine?
where is Gabriel?
he's right here.
my name is Eleanor Penn.
and I'll be handling the transaction.
I told him no cops!
put Gabriel on
I'm gonna cut his little girl so he can hear.
he can hear.
I am not a cop.
I'm not FBI.
and I have no interest in justice.
I'm here only to facilitate a private transaction and make sure no one is hurt during it.
no, you're a federal...you think I'm stupid?
I think you knew Gabriel wouldn't call the authorities if you took Davina. Which was not stupid.
but Gabriel can't do this alone.
he's afraid, and angry, and he knows those emotions are of no use right now.
so you'll deal with me.
and everybody will get what they want.
you may call me Miss Penn.
I may?
I call you Miss?
I think I call you Ellie, since we're becoming such good friends.
I will not answer to Ellie.
you may call me Miss Penn.
Oh, so you're the schoolteacher now, huh?
what, you gonna rap my knuckles if I'm bad?
it's unlikely.
you telling me how it's gonna be?!
I have the girl, okay?
I make all the rules.
you want $5 million?
that's right.
let's make it eight.
what?
8 million.
that's two million apiece.
call back in 40 minutes and let Davina talk to her father.
there's no way you're just gonna give me an extra three million...
you have the money.
it would have been polite to ask.
they have to get used to doing it my way.
right now, they're getting very used to it.
or they think she's messing with them.
I am.
but you'll give them the money.
you have to get used to doing things my way, too.
the last time a family's head of security let their daughter get kidnapped, she was recovered in three days.
his body never was.
speak out of turn again and I will scold you.
how'd you know there was four of them?
you said, "2 million apiece."
guy didn't blink.
you heard him not blink?
four's the median number in these cases.
three guys with ambition, one with information.
what more can you tell me about them?
I'll tell you when it's useful for you to know it.
they better put her on.
they will.
in 38 minutes.
you're the boss, Ellie.
what, you don't believe me?
this immigration guy, he's patting me down, he's feeling me up, he's starting to get very personal, right?
I tell him he should buy me a drink, tell me I'm pretty, he wants to grope me like that.
Oh, you're a talker, new guy.
it's Lubov. Uh, Velnik asked me to come, give Mr. Borodin my respects.
I like a talker.
immigration, he doesn't even crack a smile.
then out comes the rubber glove.
I'm serious.
I got a name for you.
hello.
you got $8 million for us?
that's right.
if it's that easy,
I think we gonna make it an even ten.
what-what are you doing?
you hang up on me again, I chop her up right now!
and I'll use her for bait!
is Davina ready to talk to her father?
you got one minute.
papi?
I'm scared. Mija...
mija, I'm right here.
papi, I'm sorry.
no, no, no, mija, it's not like that.
you just do as the men say, I'm gonna bring you home.
it's okay, it's gonna be okay.
I'm scared.
all they want is money.
they yell at me.
except the one with the mask, he doesn't talk.
it's dark in the room, but I can hear the...Davina,
I'm a friend of your father's.
I need to know if they're hutting you.
not much.
did they feed you? -But they push me around.
a little.
and they wouldn't let me use the bathroom at first, but then they did.
it's the small kind...
your father wants to tell you something.
I, uh...
I, uh, I want you to be strong, Davina.
remember that I love you and I will never let anything happen to you.
I love you, Papi.
please put the man back on.
the money tomorrow.
I call you at noon to tell you where.
maybe. And she'll be there.
there are only two ways for this to go...
either everybody gets what they want, or nobody does.
we will not pay if she's not there.
you told me you're good with people.
I misspoke. I'm good at people.
she was trying to tell me something!
and I needed her not to.
suppose they figured out what she was telling you before you did?
do you think this would endear her to them?
but if we could find her before they do something...
and what, rush in with tear gas?
these people don't handle surprises well.
they get their money or they dig a hole.
you have to trust that I have done this many, many times.
I have to trust that... right.
yesterday, you weren't a nurse or a clown in the circus.
what?
you're the best the best one they could send
why is that?
what makes you so good at this?
I don't have any hobbies
no no no
you have to do better than that
you have to make me believe, believe like you believe.
who are you?
you want my resume?
I studied psychology, forensic science, profiling from former instructors at Quantico.
been licensed seven years.
handled over 12 negotiations.
why, why, why?
what made you do all those amazing things?
did something terrible happen in your childhood?
did horrible men come and snatch you away?
Yes.
you were kidnapped.
when I was nine.
how long did that...-Three months.
and they did things to you.
unprofessional things.
is this helping you in some way?
you don't remember?
maybe it's all made up.
there was one.
he got rid of the others after they were paid and...
all the terrible memories these men put in your head.
why would they do that?
sometimes the bad things just happen and no one can protect you from them.
I'm okay.
I'm fine, I'm okay.
I'm sorry.
forget it.
I'd like to get some sleep.
we've got a long day tomorrow.
I'll have Maria make you up a bed.
don't move.
Hey, make sure the ladies at my table have what they need, huh?
the champagne never stops flowing.
the good stuff.
for the first few bottles, the good stuff.
after that, the house is fine.
you're about to make a very bad mistake.
dollhouse.
what?
dollhouse.
say it.
dollhouse.
say it again.
your brains are...
okay, dollhouse.
doll freaking house.
I'll keep saying it...it's fun to say.
dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse.
you see the Borodins, you say it some more.
you think you want to mess with the Borodins?
no, but they supply girls, some of them very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.
there's one client I'm interested in.
find out who's connected to the Dollhouse, the Borodins won't be touched, and you'll never see me again.
I haven't seen you yet.
you will.
wash your hands.
and your shoes.
you look better than on the phone, Chica.
it's still Miss Penn.
me Disculpo.
the money.
please.
this is not your first time.
let's go.
come on, let's go, let's go.
Davina, mi hija, it's okay.
papi's here.
okay... now you show.
we take that on the boat.
your daughter steps off.
you don't move towards her until we are away.
whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Hey, Boyd, what's going on?
we're good so far.
no, no, Echo's not good.
something's not good, and Echo knows it.
this is maybe your first time.
it's just a condition...we're not making trouble.
are you trying to blow this?
don't let them on the boat.
you said that's the way it is.
they're not gonna give her back.
he's not gonna give her back.
no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
she gets off first. Get the hell back.
you give me my daughter!
we need an ambulance.
the client is shot.
extract the Active.
do it now.
is it bigger than your thumb?
echo. Is it... is it bigger than your thumb?
miss Penn, look at me.
you can't fight a ghost.
you ready for your treatment?
you can't fight a ghost.
it's so dark.
of course it's dark.
it's better.
you don't see, you don't make a sound.
you forget his face.
whose face?
he's all thumbs.
what happened on the dock?
what went wrong?
he doesn't give them back.
who, the man in the mask?
he's old now.
he's the same age.
I am proportionately similar to a girl, a small girl.
the older man.
you know him.
he's the one that took you.
they never found him.
he said he was a ghost.
you can't fight a ghost...
but he was heavy, the weight of him.
ghosts aren't heavy.
ghosts are sheets with holes cut out.
he took you away.
and now...
it's unprofessional.
he's taken Davina.
she's proportionately similar to a girl.
he won't touch her until he's taken care of the others.
the other two men?
they'll be dividing the money and make sure there's no tracers, no dye pack.
they'll get excited.
they won't see him coming.
six hours.
before he kills them?
and takes her away.
on the boat?
it's been seen.
they were planning to beach it anyway.
it's a Houlberd, 30-footer.
it's got a decent range.
and it was riding high. They haven't bothered to fuel it... good.
let's place them anywhere from here...
to here.
still a lot of choices.
I'm missing something.
the man an the phone...what did he say?
the mask.
only one man wore a mask.
because she knows him.
he doesn't just have information.
he's in her life.
we find him, we find the ghost.
how does she know him?
something the other one said.
we need to do my treatment now, and we need to do it fast.
miss Penn...
come on, Langton.
a client's in critical, weapon's discharged.
you think I'm gonna let you hold her hand while Topher scrubs her? Two minutes.
you have any idea of the crap that's raining down on us?
handler intervention triggers an immediate debriefing - to make sure that we weren't exposed. - We're close.
as soon as I finish my treatment, we'll find her.
he won't do this again.
I need to talk to DeWitt.
you need to tell me everything that went down today.
it wasn't a glitch.
the imprint was rock solid.
there was a weird spike last night, but what happened at the dock happened to Eleanor Penn.
or the people we made her out of.
I need you to do this quickly.
I live to serve.
barging in here isn't going to help your situation, Mr. Langton.
echo can find the Crestejo girl.
I'm sorry.
he's faster than you'd think.
you cannot wipe her right now.
I can do any damn thing I see fit.
echo botched the engagement.
she jeopardized this entire operation.
of an abused girl, and you put her face to face with her abuser.
she recognized one of her kidnappers.
and she can find him again. She's the only one who can.
ma'am, we need to distance ourselves from this.
we don't know if the client's going to live.
this is becoming news.
I'm sorry, Mr. Langton, but this is complicated.
no, it isn't.
echo's in pain, but she's the right girl for the job, and she knows the territory.
she can find Davina before that man lays a finger on her.
you wipe her, you've lost all of that.
we do not have a client!
we have a mission!
we prefer to call them engagements.
you have not been here as long as some of the others, so I will overlook the error.
I've been here long enough to know that you like to tell yourself what we do helps people.
let Echo help this girl.
where are my glasses?
I know how to find her.
it was the first call.
the kidnapper said, "You're the schoolteacher now.
he stressed you're, like there's already a teacher in the mix.
the one in the mask.
check her school.
see who's missing.
he's been close to her.
he's probably not Latino.
ms. Penn, I'm Lawrence Dominic.
security contractor.
Yes, ma'am. I have a chopper standing by.
I'll need a radio contact while we're en route.
that'll be Mr. Langton. He's staying here.
she needs backup. Not from you.
I'm her handler.
miss Dewitt will decide what you are.
James Shepherd, Caucasian male, 33.
out sick 12 consecutive days.
has a sister with an isolated house six miles from the dock.
I'm going to need a clean and quiet touchdown with zero chance they'll see or hear our approach.
with respect, the last time you went head to head with these people, you folded.
my man's fully...
your man gives me ten minutes, or Davina will die.
how is she?
see the blue areas?
that's fear.
it all looks blue.
that's where I'm going with this.
uh, the persona we developed?
bunch of different people. Yeah.
and one of them was abused by the guy she ran into.
I know. Yeah, I looked her up.
she killed herself.
last year.
she never got away from him.
what are we playing at?
it's the woman. What?
from the drop?
damn it!
who else? You see anyone else?
I'm alone.
please open the door.
don't do it, man.
listen to me.
who knows where we are?
everyone's going to know very soon, Mr. Shepherd.
you left a wide trail, but that's not your problem.
he is.
hell you on about?
soon as that money's counted, he's going to kill both of you.
you think we fall for that crap?
turn us on each other?
you tell us how long till they come, you talk.
or I find something to stuff that mouth up.
I think I'm a little old for you.
the man that shot Mr. Crestejo is dead.
you will be identified as the ringleader.
you two haven't killed anyone.
you can let me leave with Davina, and get out of the country very rich men.
the girl's not here.
she's in the fridge.
you unplugged it and pulled out the shelves.
you had to rope it shut, of course, cause these days, they don't lock.
we were gonna tell people where she was.
you were gonna die.
cause there's something this man wants even more than eight million dollars.
shut your mouth!
Hey!
lady seems to know a lot.
I know everything.
all the girls he kept, till he was through with them.
till he got bored, or just broke them down.
I even know about the one he dumped in the river before he was sure she was dead.
it's over.
you can't hurt me anymore.
you can't fight a ghost.
we're going now.
we'll be okay. Here.
go now.
I told you to wait.
there were shots.
we made a call.
we were coming out.
is she injured?
are you hurt?
then get over it.
the money's here.
I want it bagged, and our presence swept in three minutes.
you're okay.
you're okay, okay?
you're free.
you're free.
it's a solid win, ma'am.
the client's stabilized.
we have the payment, plus the eight million.
and both Actives performed admirably.
it nearly came crashing down on us.
it was contained.
Yeah.
Yes.
now tell me how we're going to contain this.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, get that thing out of my face.
it's for the video yearbook. Say hi to your mom.
okay. Hi, Mom! Are we done?
is there someone you'd like to say good-bye to?
Ditra and Meg, life without you will be meaningless and bleak, my dormies.
Oh, and the girls of Sigma Tau, sisters forever.
let's hope those venereal diseases make you all sterile, you snobby-ass pack of hos.
Oh, that's definitely going in.
so, what are you planning on doing after graduation?
Yeah, I probably should have thought about that.
I'd like to take my place in the world, like Mrs. Dundee taught us.
global Recovery, Doctors Without Borders.
the world is in need of some serious saving.
and I want to travel.
travel around the world as I save it.
in a private jet that I pilot and design.
okay, go ahead and laugh, yearbook monkey.
I know: I'm such a cliché.
what can I say?
I want to do everything.
is that too much to ask?
in their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children.
we call it the tabula rasa-- the blank slate.
now imagine the imprint process filling it, creating a new personality.
a friend, lover.
and when the engagement has been completed all memory will be wiped clean.
I try to be my best.
why not default them with, uh, ninja skills.
we tried that once. - And?
blood. Screaming. Dying.
alpha could have killed echo when he escaped, but he left her alive.
so why didn't he kill echo?
find out who's connected to the dollhouse and you'll never see me again.
you don't know me, but I checked you out plenty, agent Ballard.
you don't close.
Hello, victor.
did I fall asleep?
what am I looking for?
the basement.
what do you know about the dollhouse?
I don't know what you're talking about!
no one ever does.
Oh, god.
what is that? Why is it beeping?
so, who kissed who first?
I don't know, but... she did. She kissed me.
he lunged at me in the middle of a frat party.
well, yeah, it was because you, you know, you did the little "kiss me" face.
he had one of those sad, little peach-fuzz goatee...
now, I'm about to say something that might scare you a little, okay?
okay.
little Lucy has linebacker shoulders.
so, she's going to be a lesbian?
big baby, narrow birth canal.
that's causing her some distress.
so, you and I have some work to do, okay?
and you have to get ready to hold your baby girl cause your wife's going to be a little wiped out.
ready? - Okay.
okay. Now... push.
here's a promise: All this scary, painful stuff-- you won't even remember.
I want to forget. I want to forget!
here comes your daughter.
I want to forget!
Hello, echo. How are you feeling?
did I fall asleep?
for a little while.
shall I go now?
if you like.
good day.
I wasn't certain where to sit.
I swam 30 laps today.
good for you.
I'm tied now.
it's important to exercise.
I try to be my best.
are you?
excuse me?
are you your best?
I'm... not sure how to know that.
I think if you always try, that's best. Right?
every day is a chance to be better.
they're eating lunch.
they're eating lunch together, man friend.
same three.
even the same table.
they're grouping.
are you saying they remember each other?
no, no, no, no. The wipes are clean.
this goes deeper than memory into instinctual survival patterns.
flocking. Wholmess of sparrows turning on a dime.
salmon trucking upstream.
this isn't a book club, man friend.
this is the herd.
they're not bison, topher.
they're a little bit bison.
well, they didn't used to be.
they volunteered for this.
so we're told.
the problem is not insurmountable.
what problem?
upon review, your engagement was flagged as having certain special requirements.
before, you tell me no one gets to know what I'm asking for.
that's correct. However, our computers do calculate possible risks to our actives.
but you... you don't know.
no one knows the details of your engagements but you.
excuse me. I'm very sorry.
Yes, sir, of course I understand your concern.
our main goal now is to complete this matter as quickly as possible.
Yes, the less time we give him to spin his own theories, the better, I think.
well, he needs closure.
and we are the experts at giving people what they need, aren't we?
Yes, sir, I'll keep you in... formed. Good-bye.
I didn't offer you a drink.
tea or something stronger?
these computers, they say I have to pay more, I pay more.
you're very understanding, Mr. Diakos. This way, please.
Judith will handle the details.
it is not for me, you know.
this night... it is a gift.
you're a very generous man.
blue skies.
if I had an uncle who'd get me her for my bachelor party, I'd get married, too.
she's very... comfortable with herself, isn't she? - Yeah.
taffy, baby, I'm going to have fun with you tonight.
anything you want.
it's all blue skies.
Yeah!
gentlemen. Ma'am.
sir.
perhaps you'd like to take the party up to your suite?
I'd be happy to send up a complementary bottle of champagne.
make it two bottles and you got a deal.
two bottles it is, sir.
let's go!
wait, wait for me.
help! Someone help me! Please! I need help!
taffy, come on! We're just having a good time!
grab her, man!
please! Help me! They... they hurt me. Please!
Ah, crap.
it's okay. It's okay. You're safe now.
where are we going?
I shouldn't be here. - Don't worry.
those idiots didn't follow us.
even if they did... nobody's getting through here.
see? Everything's fine.
why don't you sit down?
that was not okay.
I mean, I know who I am, and, and what I do, but I didn't sign up for that.
and I really have to go.
is there a backdoor? I have somewhere to be.
what are you doing?
I understand you've had a difficult evening, ma'am.
yeah?
but we deeply regret any...
indignities you may have suffered.
but it's hotel policy, in these instances, to offer a one-time payment to, uh, compensate you for...
you want me to let those freaks off the hook.
fine, they're off the hook. I just want go.
you feel that way now.
but tomorrow, the next day, you may change your mind.
we feel it's in your best interest...
I'm leaving. - Ma'am, that's $10, 000.
now, all you have to do is sign this piece of paper stating you will not pursue legal action against the hotel or the guests in question...
with... that.
10000
I just take your $10, 000 and disappear?
Yeah. You could be free.
you can go anywhere. - No, thanks.
I just want you to think about it.
I'm in.
we're in position.
door code's 489-374-83.
blue skies.
they're called breasts. And yes, they are exceptional.
you can mention that when you blog about this later.
wants me to blog about it?
so, boss, what do we really call you?
you really call me taffy.
and the client's the boss.
he put together this merry band of thieves.
in his infinite wisdom he decided that...
well, guess I am the boss of you.
not taking him out's your first mistake.
I figured out on my first job when a little "creative thinking" on my part almost got me not paid
never second-guess a client.
and wear comfy shoes.
our client's paying premium for no-kill. He gets no-kill. Okeydoke?
I-I think you're hurting him.
you're very astute, professor.
it's a good thing this is a no kill-job.
you could have been in trouble there.
uh, yeah, right. Shouldn't we go far away now?
here's how this is going to go.
in 64 seconds, the high-security building on the other side of that wall is going to be shutting down their motion sensors, infraredensors, security cameras.
we will be in a gray hour.
in the one hour it takes them to revolutionize their security system and make it impenetrable, we penetrate.
uh, excuse me. If their system is down, they must know someone is going to try and break in.
that's six seconds we can't get back.
inside security: Five guards, each with gps tracking devices implanted in their badges.
the guards will be focused on perimeter threats.
they're not allowed on the vault floor during gray hour.
for security reasons.
you have them yet?
not till we're inside.
the sensors don't pick up any... - 15 seconds.
you ready to go boom? - Ready.
we gotta sync our watches... - uh, sweetie.
you're on taffy standard time now.
and three, two, one. Go.
a hundred people must have heard this.
upstairs, they're just thinking a truck rumbled by.
I am the best, my man!
Bladdy, blah. We're all the best, braggy.
so pretty.
Hey, if she's the best, funny I've never heard of her.
you've heard of bonnie and Clyde, right?
are you bonnie?
no. I'm not that stupid.
Bonnie and her gun-crazy beau-- you know what they wanted?
it wasn't to be the best.
Best-ness means a quiet, head-down kind of life.
no, bonnie and clydie-- they wanted fame.
notoriety.
and boy, did they get it. They also got dead. I'll pass on that.
when this is over, feel free to forget I exist.
now just keep it down while this little darling and I get to know each other better.
uh, coming online. Two secs. I'll see the guards.
what?
she's in.
Damn!
Damn!
tick-tock, boys.
Hey, this is... Oh, my god.
there are rumors of secret vaults used by top museums to store the world's most controversial works, but...
Yeah. Piccolo boy here is shocking.
Yeah, piccolo boy, as you call him, was recently stolen from a private collector in Paris.
valued at $17 million.
whatevs.
so, we're stealing stolen art?
well, some of these works are merely of questionable provenance.
Yeah, high-quality counterfeits.
antiquities, which are my particular forte...
Hey, old stuff expert?
old stuff's in here.
thank you, gods... and goddesses.
gray hour's now gray 45 minutes.
this is what we're here for.
find it, tell me if it's the real thing, so we can pack it up and get the hell out of here.
I thought it might be this.
why else would I have been chosen?
chosen for what?
what are we taking out of here?
the Parthenon.
isn't that kind of big?
don't do... don't shoot me.
how'd you get in here?
your-your locks are for crap.
get out.
you got to help me. Put me in witness protection.
uh, get me out of town! just listen to me.
the last time I listened to you, I got a hole through the gut.
I-I didn't set you up!
you sent me to an ambush.
they were going to kill me!
who is she?
a pretty girl.
she is a pretty girl. Pretty and lost.
you know lots of girls like that.
not her.
is she the reason they want me dead?
her name's Caroline. Bells ringing?
No! I-I gave you a tip!
somebody gives it to me, I give it to you. That's how it works!
who gave you the tip?
boom, you get shot, my old, nice life, over.
I can't call my friends. I can't go home. I don't have any money.
who gave you the tip? Was it her?
a voice on the phone. A-a man. Not old, not young.
uh, accent. Sounded Georgian maybe.
russian Georgia, not sweet home Georgia.
Alabama.
wh-what do I know?
it's confusing, this country.
the borodins used me to get to you.
that means they know I talk to you, the FBI!
I am a dead man already if you don't help me.
if I help you...
I never hear from you again.
never. As in ever.
never ever.
stay here.
I'll see what I can do.
and this is one of the missing Elgin marbles.
yeah?
okay, but we're looking for a frieze fragment, not a metope panel.
over their heads, professor.
the Elgin marbles are, uh, large sections of the Parthenon's marble friezes and statuary, stolen in the late 19th century.
so we are stealing stolen art, basically. - Not technically.
you see, the Turks, who controlled Athens at the time-- they granted Thomas Bruce, the seventh earl of Elgin, permission to remove the marbles, so, uh...
so, Greece hired us to take this one back.
client info is confidential.
explains why we got hired through middlemen.
and the no-kill order.
things go bad, they don't want some kind of international incident.
when a client doesn't say upfront who they are, finding out's usually not healthy.
how about we stop speculating?
all right. The guards are rotating down to the lower floors.
they're not coming down here.
at least not for the next 34 minutes.
better be right. - I am.
it's nothing personal-- his thing with you.
if I were in charge, he'd be an ass with me, too, so...
want to grab a drink after this?
ask me when we get out of here.
will do.
where are you going with that?
no, don't! Don't let that close!
stop the door!
bastard!
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, peachy. - Over here.
you're gonna be fine. I can get us out of here.
the alarm come back up in...
in-in what?
31 minutes. not gonna be a problem.
just got to make a quick call.
what's up? - It's me.
how in the hell are you getting reception down here?
I got a double-crosser coming your way.
probably the southwest corner of the building.
he has what we came for. Black bag.
you're gonna have to complete this job for me.
I need a happy client.
I'm on it. Everything all right in there?
we're locked in.
my tech guy's gonna need medical, but I'm fine, and I can get us out, which is irrelevant if the job's a wash.
I'll finish the job. Just get out of there.
Thanks. See you in a F.
did I... fall asleep?
neuromodulator is your friend.
and I don't mean friend from kindergarten you see twice a year.
Neuromod is your bff.
brain mapping requires...
pizza squares, ice cream bites, beef jerky?
okay, you may be the boy-god of all things neuro, and I do worship at the altar of your genius, but I am not getting you all this stuff.
Ivy, babe, add juice boxes.
you're privilege-abusing.
do you want to know how to avoid spandrels when aligning rigid designators?
grape or apple?
humility is part of the learning process.
I break you down. Then I build you back.
shall I go now? - What's wrong with her?
hysterical woman syrome?
five minutes ago, you were kissing her ass.
five minutes ago, we were on taffy standard time.
it's a private number. It's not letting me dial out.
shall I go now? - Yeah. Let's go!
