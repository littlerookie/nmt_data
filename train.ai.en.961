come on. Okay
it's all right
I'll see you at 5：00, all right?
good boy. Hach, go home. Go on
go on
sound any better that time?
all right
you remember we were talking about John Philip Sousa...
...great march composer around the turn of the century
he was a very famous man...
...but he had a huge thing about recorded music
he would never allow his music to be recorded
even when Thomas Edison came to him with his brand-new invention, the phonograph
but Edison didn't care. He went ahead and did it anyhow
secretly he recorded his marching band in a parade
which I guess makes it the very first bootleg
so what do you think about that?
do you think it's okay now? What about today's performers?
should you be able to just walk up in the middle of the stage...
...plug in your CD player to a Marshall Stack and...
...that's it? It's good enough?
I don't know
I'm a lot older than you but I tend to think that...
...there's an element of music...
...that cannot be captured
life cannot be captured. The human heart cannot be captured
the moment of creation itself is fleeting
Hey, Hachi, how you doing?
Hey, Hachi
good night, Hachi
Hey, buddy

Andy?
it's time to go, sweetheart
you're a good boy. You stay here, okay?
I'll be back
I have said that the soul is not more than the body
and I have said that the body is not more than the soul
and nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is
I hear and behold God in every object
yet understand God not in the least
nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself
in the faces of men and women I see God
and in my own face in the glass
I find letters from God dropped in the street
and every one is signed by God's name
and I leave them where they are
for I know that wherever I go
others will punctually come for ever and ever
look...

in 1944, a team of paranormal researchers, together with the US Army, rescued a strange creature during a classified mission off the coast of Scotland. Secretly adopted, this creature now lives among us.
it loves candy and TV.
code NAME: HELLBOY
Douglas Army Base, N. M. Christmas Eve, 1955.
unit Christmas rations must be picked up by 0900 hours.
armor group tree decoration team, report to the Engineering Depot.
my son, will you turn off that wretched puppet?
brush your teeth.
don't call him a puppet.
I beg your pardon.
look, he's not a puppet.
howdy Doody's real.
well... He's real.
Mr. Deedee Doodoo will have to say good night.
Oh, no.
and remember, you have to be asleep when he comes down the chimney.
it's not even a chimney, Pop.
he has his ways.
then I want to wait up. Watch him do it.
nonsense.
okay. I want a story then.
Oh, no, no, no. No stories tonight.
just one. And then I'll go to bed.
right away.
then I'll brush my teeth, I promise.
it is said that at the dawn of time, "man, beast and all magical beings lived together under Aiglin the Father Tree.
but man had been created with a hole in his heart, "a hole that no possession, power or knowledge could fill.
and in his infinite greed, "man dreamt of expanding his dominion over the entire Earth.
the blood of many an elf, ogre and goblin was spilled in their war with man.
and King Balor, the one-armed king of Elfland, "watched the slaughter in dread and despair.
but one day, the master of the goblin blacksmiths "offered to build the king a golden mechanical army, "seventy times 70 soldiers "that would never know hunger and could not be stopped.
prince Nuada begged his father to agree.
build me this army, ' the king said.
so a magical crown was forged "that would allow those of royal blood "to command the Golden Army if unchallenged.
I am King Balor, leader of the Golden Army.
is there anyone who disputes my right? '
and in his throne room no one challenged his word.
but, wait, what if someone could challenge him?
would they have a fight?
well, most likely.
a challenge must be answered.
but do you want to hear the end of this story or not?
Yes, please.
right.
so the world was changed, and the next time the humans marched, "they felt the earth tremble beneath their feet "and saw the sky darken with monstrous shapes.
the Golden Army had no remorse, felt no loyalty or pain.
and King Balor's heart grew heavy with regret.
so he called a truce and divided the crown in three pieces, "one for the humans, and two for himself.
in exchange, man would keep to the cities "and the magical beings would own the forests.
this truce would be honored by their sons and the sons of their sons "until the end of time.
but Prince Nuada did not believe in the promises of man.
and it is said that he went into exile, "vowing to return the day his people needed him most.
so the Golden Army lay dormant, "locked inside the Earth, waiting.
and there it is to this day, "awaiting the day the crown is made whole again.
silent, still and indestructible.
Wow. What does it mean "industrable"?
indestructible.
Indestruct...
it means no one can destroy them.
go to sleep, my son.
but it's just a story, right, Pops?
is it now?
Yeah, come on.
those guys, they can't be real.
well, my son, I'm sure you'll find out.
how long have you been there, my friend?
they're over there.
I bought them today.
I haven't fed them at all.
I will go up first. You will follow.
and remember, Mr. Wink, don't be shy.

officially we do not exist, you see.
so that's the problem when we get these.

I suppress each photo. Cell phone videos.

God, I hate YouTube.

I don't think so.

Oh, it's Friday.
I tell you, Fishstick, he hates me.

this is... It's an antacid.
Yes, it's an over-the-counter medicine, but this is medicine.

I mean, I am, we are, after all, we're just humble public servants.
it's not about you. He's acting out.
things are a little tense with Liz.
tense? How tense? Tense how?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, well, one day, the world's gonna realize its mistake.
eight-track was the way to go, baby.
come on, kids, you can come out now.
that's right, it's all over. That's right.

you have to be... You have to be very, very...
discreet.
what? Thank you. - You're welcome.

whatever they called us for is over.
we had over 70 guests reported.
we have no survivors, no bodies.
same story here, babe.
don't call me "babe.
Abe," I said. "Abe." Wrong channel.
abe, I think Liz is still mad at me.
still the same channel.
can I ask you a question?
no.
now, listen. When we get home later,
I'm gonna clean up my whole mess.
that's not the problem.
what is it?
not now.
abe, what have you got?
Oh, this is interesting.
both boxes have the Royal Seal.
only delivered at a time of war.
red? We have company.
come on, Blue, give me something to work with here.
burrowing creatures.
how many of them? - Many.
there are no corpses because there are no leftovers.
have you noticed the floor?
Oh, crap.
precisely.
all these things do is eat and eat.
then poop, and then eat again.
remind you of anyone?
damn it, Abe. What are these things?
english, English.
Oh, they're Tooth Fairies.
no, no. Third century, Black Forest.
feed mostly on calcium, bones, skin, organs.
but they do go for the teeth first.
hence the name Tooth Fairies.
I bet you they don't leave money, either.
Oh, my God.
Liz, you're pregnant.
no, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
what have you got, Marble?
think I may have found one.
but he's kind of cute.
don't go near it!
it's biting me!
marble.
it hurts! It hurts!
red, we need you here!
marble.
nasty little...
keep firing, Abe. Keep firing!
damn.
sorry, lady.
you should be running.
there's a safe upstairs.
how do we get there?
we need a clearing.
run!
up to the safe, now!
Abe. Up the stairs.

Yes, we're going!

Oh, no, no.

world, here I come.
what have you done?
guess we're out.
Hey, Hellboy, over here.
east Side Railyards, midnight
your Royal Highness.
prince Nuada...
...you honor us with your return
before entering the council chamber, you must surrender your weapon.
I will not.
it is protocol, sire, for peasant and prince alike.
it will be my pleasure to finish you off, Chamberlain
please, brother...
...surrender it.
for you, Sister, anything.
according to multiple eye witnesses, lives were, in fact, endangered.
there you have it, Hellboy.
but is he really on our side?
do you have superpowers?
well, yeah.
but, really, all I wanna be is just an ordinary person, just like you and you and everybody.
Hey, guys. You're missing this.
we're on TV.
Liz. Liz, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.
you don't need to do that. You can trust me.
my readings are quite accurate.
shut up, Abe.
get your damn hand away from the door.
you have nothing to fear.
in spite of appearances,
I believe Red would be an excellent father figure.
and what about this guy?
walking around with a toilet seat on his head.
a toilet seat!
it's quite obvious it's a breathing apparatus.
Hey, I think we gotta lose the garbage truck.
sends out the wrong signal.
you think that's our problem?
transportation?
and this girl, we definitely have to find out what's wrong with her.
she's cute, though. We should get her on the show.
I hate it when people stare at me.
makes me feel like a freak.
you had no right, Red.
it's Manning. Could you...
how many times do I have to tell you?
it's a gas pocket.
and a gaseous phenomenon that occurred...
gas pocket. What an idiot.
you've murdered me.
you have murdered me.
you have ridiculed me.
and you have brought this unto yourself.
what?
washington is sending down a new BPRD agent.
a new guy?
Why?
to look after you.
sire, please.
father
Why?
why have you done this?
Why?
to set us free. All of us, Father.
you have broken an ancient truce...
...between our people and mankind.
a truce based on shame.
the humans have forgotten the gods, destroyed the Earth. And for what?
parking lots. Shopping malls.
greed has burned a hole in their heart that will never be filled.
they will never have enough.
what humans do is in their nature...
...to honor the truce is in ours.
honor?
look at this place. Where is the honor in it?
father, you were once a proud warrior.
when did you become their pet?
I have returned from exile to wage war and reclaim our land, our birthright.
and for that, I will call upon the help of all of my people.
and they will answer, the good, the bad and the worst.
the Golden Army!
you cannot be that mad.
perhaps I am. Perhaps they made me so.
awaken the army...
...but our green fields cannot grow out of all that blood
let the army sleep.
if our days have ended...
...Let us all fade
we will not fade.
for the last time, my son, I ask you...
...is this the path you wish to take?
it is.
I am sorry, Father.
then you leave me no choice.
death
and you, Sister, are you at peace with your king's verdict?
I am, my brother. I am.
then very well. Death it is.
I always loved you, Father.
now, for the final piece, my sister.
where is she, Wink? Where is she?
go find her. Now! Find her!

elevator arriving now to section 42.
pardon me, boys. Excuse me. Excuse me.
is he here? - Not yet.
I'm telling you, we don't need this guy.
well, I think we do.
evidently, this guy's quite the big shot in Washington.
what's his name?
his name is Johann Krauss.
johann Krauss? Sounds German.
he's the top man in...
Ectoplasmic.
Yes, thank you. Ectoplasmic research.
comes highly recommended by our European liaison.
johann Krauss. - "Liaison.
I love that word, don't you?
it's so hoity toity.
I don't like Germans. - No fingerprints.
here he comes. - Germans make me nervous.
no photo. Dossier says, and I translate, "He has a nice open face.
Oh, my God.
Damen und Herren, Johann Krauss at your service.
I like him.
look at that. Poor little thing.
bought and sold on the black market.
crammed into cargo containers.
smuggled, abused.
he has very expressive hands.
the seal on the box worries me also.
a warring emblem.
Yes, from the Bethmoora clan.
the Sons of the Earth.
your file says you're the brains of the operation, and I must admit, I'm impressed.
in my file, you'll see, Mr. Krauss, that I worked very closely with Abe in his training.
ja, okay.
let's see what our little friend here can remember.
memory gets a little sketchy right after you've burned to death.
but maybe Saint Malachy can help.
Oh, no, no. No amulets, Mein Herr.
Teleplasty.
plastic. Very modern.
Teleplasty by which an ectoplasmic medium, such as Dr. Krauss, can control inanimate things, organic, mechanical, dead or alive.
take it, take it all in, mein Junge.
there we are. Get up.
get up. Get up.
now I have full control of its limbic system.
let us see how long I can hold it.
what?
Hey, you chewed off the tip of my tail.
Yeah, you, you little...
it says you're rude, brutish and not very bright.
it seems our little friend here remembers market sounds and voices.
and a peculiar troll language spoken in the last place his cage was opened.
the troll market.
the troll market? Come on.
no one's ever found it.
that's because it doesn't exist.
Mr. Krauss? Dr. Krauss, sir.
our little informant there doesn't look so good.
back inside, you. There we are.
so, now we know where to begin.
trolls dwell under bridges.
Wow. You're a genius.
by the way, there's over 2, 000 bridges in New York City.
but Vladimir Vanya, 19th century occult historian, places the troll market directly under the east end of the Brooklyn Bridge.
we've already looked there.
Yes, you have, but not with me, Agent.
not with me.
we're moving in.
Brooklyn Bridge 03: 30hrs
keep it coming, keep it coming. Hold it.
not with me, Agent." What an ego.
I like him.
well, you can keep him.
I mean, am I the only one that thinks this guy is full of...
no, no, no, no, don't lean.
lot 336, the Schufftein glasses. Could it be?
the three surviving pairs, and we will use them to locate the troll market.
Dr. Krauss, what a coup.
the Schufftein glasses.
you're my hero.
Hey. You Hellboy?
Yeah.
you're ugly, man.
two more on the wall in front of me and then three on the alleys facing that way.
what do you think of Mr. Know-lt-All?
don't know, too early to tell.
Hey, you're Hellboy.
I know, I'm ugly.
forget it.
we'll talk about it later.
he's sure of himself, and I think maybe you're intimidated.
intimidated. Huh?
keep us up to date on the cameras, Agent Sherman. Over and out.
what's this?
normally, we can't see fairy folk and trolls.
they generate a cloaking aura called "glamour.
but in 1878, Emil Schufftein designed and built these.
four crystal diopters that penetrate that effect and reveal the true nature of things.
Oh, Dr. Krauss, they're more beautiful than I'd imagined.
you must try them on then. Oh, yes.
try them on, Agent. - They'll look good.
I love these tight little leather straps.
intimidated?
Mr. Kraut? Sir?
Krauss, Agent. With a double "S.
S-S. Right, right.
listen, those gizmos?
how do you know they work?
I have a suspect.
give me a vector, Agent Sherman. A vector.
b-12, the alley, northbound.
well, track the target. We're coming down.
keep an eye on her. I'll be right back.
this little old lady? Come on.
it's a Fragglewump, an ugly Scottish troll.
they're afraid of canaries.
Oh, my God. Canaries, huh?
what about the kittens?
she feeds on them.
come on, then. Kitty, kitty, kitty.
that thing is a "she"?
under the Brooklyn Bridge 04: 57hrs
down, you fools.
what do you think you are doing?
she's gonna eat the cat.
you'll make her aware of our presence.
we should use the canary now.
she's gonna eat it!
we should use the bird, Dr. Krauss.
the bird.
she's going to eat the cat.
you will stay put and follow my orders.
I can't sit by here...
you are directly under my command, and you have to obey.
stay put! - Oh, screw this!
Hey! Lucy.
come back here.
I'm home.
Oh, yes, dearie. Can I help you?
give it up, nasty. We can see you.
you see me?
how? How do you see me?
we're looking for the entrance to the troll market. Any clues?
come any closer and I'll rip your heart.
we're gonna have to get a little old-school, Abe.
give me the bird.
not a canary.
what, you're afraid of this little guy?
who'd know?
no more, no more.
I'll take you there.
come on, let's go, you dirty old troll.
let's go.
agent Sherman, we are going into the troll market.
keep communication to a minimum.
over und out.
I like him.
you see, this is a man who takes charge.
you think?
Yeah. He's efficient.
he's precise.
you add "resistant" to that, you got yourself a new watch.
Dr. Krauss is aware of the chain of command, and he...
Oh, brother!
he seems to like me.
here we are.
wow, that's some door!
it's a complex combination lock.
what do you think, Agent Sapien?
not good.
with the number of symbols on the combination, we'll be here for days.
well, not necessarily.
let me try my technique.
open it, Lucy.
I will not.
pretty please.
do as you may, demon.
release the yellow beast.
tear my eyes out.
rip my insides and my legs and my tongue, but I will never open that door.
is that your investigative technique?
it said "never.
it's unconscionable.
that means he didn't like it.
what?
so, what, you're gonna show us how it's done,
Mr. By-The-Book?
is that it?
Yes, I think I will.
there we are.
let me see. Yes.
gentlemen, welcome to the troll market.
fresh fish
get your fresh fish...
red, there's something really important that I need to tell you.
Oh, Liz, you should be here. You'd love it.
nobody's looking at us. We blend right in.
agent, I said keep communication to a minimum.
you'll blow our cover.
you know? I think he's right.
I'm bringing you here for sure, babe.
the fishbowl wants radio silence. So...
over and out.
the Royal Seal.
brother Red. Red, do you read me?
Yeah, I read you, Blue, but I'm watching Sherlock at work.
I'll get back to you.
excuse me, sir.
sir, excuse... Pardon me. Sir, may I ask a...
I gotta tell the boys that one.
excuse me, gentlemen.
have you seen anyone purchasing this type of Tooth Fairy?
no one sells them down here, pal.
over in Jersey, maybe.
well, what about this, then?
do you recognize this seal?
make him go away. Make him go away.
no. We don't.
please, dear sir.
you'd better go. Now!
we'll make it worth your while.
don't waste your time. We will not talk!
what are you doing?
you're absolutely sure about that, huh?
Absolutely.
you won't talk, eh?
never.
never, huh?
never ever, ever.
feeling a little chattier now?
we'll never talk.
Yes, yes.
we will, only don't hit me anymore.
chicken.
who bought the Tooth Fairies?
prince Nuada.
they say Prince Nuada broke the truce, and now there is talk of war, a war with the human world.
sorry, kid.
that's all right.
nice baby.
I'm not a baby. I'm a tumor.
Yes, Red. I am following a lead right now.
it may turn out...
it may turn out to be nothing, but I will let you know soon enough.
what do you want? Tell me your name.
follow me.
your father left you this map.
in it, he said, lies the secret to the location of the Golden Army.
move away! Quickly, Your Highness.
can I help you with something?
no, thank you. I'm just looking.
you can't go in there!
sir, why are you following me?
I...
I was just hoping to find an old map chart of Algiers.
why are you following me?
I was not.
did my brother send you to steal the crown piece?
your brother?
Oh, you're sorely mistaken, I assure you.
then answer me truthfully.
why were you following me?
my name is Abraham Sapien.
there is no such name.
Oh, I don't like it either, but I...
enough.
give me your hand.
your hand.
you are an agent for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.
and your name is...
horrible, I know.
I'm Nuala, Princess Nuala.
Yes, I know.
forgive me, Your Highness, but as you were learning about me,
I couldn't help but learn a bit about you myself.
I know that you need our help.
I'm afraid it's the other way around.
the window. Out now.
I will take care of this.
Oh, dear.
go! Now go!
get out of here, Blue.
Yes. Come with me, Your Highness.
you.
let me put this to you as delicately as I can.
my cigar, it was Cuban.
now you pissed me off.
Oh, crap.
now stay down!
damn.
a tooth. Happy?
give it up, pal. It's over.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Wow. Told you.
Oh, mein Gott, what have you done, Agent Hellboy?
look at this! Now we have to leave.
red. This is Princess Nuala.
lady.
we should leave. Now. Now!
let's go.
wink is dead...
a big red man killed him.
is there something you need to tell me?
up there
no, up there!
up at the market
wink is dead.
to wage his war, my brother needs this, the final piece of the Crown of Bethmoora and this map to the location of the Golden Army chamber.
the Golden Army.
the harbingers of death.
the unstoppable tide.
howdy Doody.
your Highness, if you hand the crown piece over to us...
no. Where it goes, I go.
my father died to uphold the truce with your world.
you must honor his noble intention.
the lady's in dire danger.
I take it you're vouching for her, Agent Sapien?
most emphatically. Yes, I am.
even so.
I am sorry, but we simply cannot assume such responsibility on our own.
the lady just lost her father.
what more do you want?
you may not care, but there are procedures, rules and little handbooks...
she's coming with us.
you got that, Gas Bag?
what did you call me?
you.
you will pay for what happened to my friend down there.
Yeah, right. You take checks?
demon.
born from a womb of shadows.
sent to destroy their world, and you still believe you belong.
are we gonna talk all night?
cause I'm really sleepy.
no, Brother, no!
kill him.
it's just a jumping bean.
it's going for water. Hurry.
Oh, dear.
no. No, no, no, no. No.
what the hell is that? - Excuse me!
stay back - Hey, what's going on?
we've got target in sight.
it's an Elemental, a giver of life and a destroyer.
what?
a Forest God.
a Forest God, eh?
I'm gonna get me Big Baby.
somebody help! My baby's...Help! Help!
how can I help you, ma'am?
my baby's inside!
come with us, dear lady, please.
there's nothing to worry about.
we've got everything under control.
please. My baby's still in there! Please!
Hey, little guy.
homing in on target.
hang on, kid.
agent Hellboy.
reach higher ground and shoot the weapon.
shoot the weapon!
first praise the tail, kid.
you must shoot it in the energy ganglion.
the what?
the energy ganglion.
Scheisse. The head! Shoot it in the head!
Oh, crap.
you gotta trust me, little buddy. Okay?
you woke up the baby.
agent Hellboy, take the shot!
right now! Take it!
that's an order! Take the shot.
that's an order, Agent Hellboy.
shoot it! Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!
demon.
what are you waiting for?
this is what you wanted, isn't it?
look at it. It's the last of its kind.
like you and I. You destroy it, the world will never see its like again.
shoot it!
you have more in common with us than with them.
it's breaking free.
you could be a king.
you will not disobey a direct order!
shoot it! It's getting loose!
if you cannot command...
it will destroy everything!
that's an order, Agent Hellboy!
...then you must obey.
shoot it now! - Damn.
shoot it!
move back. Step back, step back.
it's beautiful.
and this huge monster just came out of nowhere!
yo, give the baby back, man!
Oh, what have you done to my baby?
the baby's fine.
you freak!
Hellboy, what'd you do to that baby?
the baby's fine.
don't move. Hands in the air! Up!
he's got a weapon in his hand.
that is his hand.
miss, stay away from him for your own safety.
he was trying to help. Don't you see?
he was just trying to help.
that's all we do.
that's all we've done all these years.
she's touching his hand!
we've just tried to help you. You.
you're a goddamn freak.
we don't need you around!
what a freak.
Liz.
let's go home.
...investigation of the BPRD and its promotion of intra-species marriage seen by many as a threat to traditional families, fuelled by federal funds.
I didn't touch you yet.
you did a good job out there.
then tell me, why don't I feel so good?
I mean, I killed that thing. And for what?
they don't even like me.
I mean, they're afraid of me.
what do we do with that?
red, I don't want you to freak out.
I'm gonna leave for a little bit.
I need time to think.
about what?
can't you do your thinking right here?
look, I'll be really, really quiet.
I'll get rid of the cats.
red, why are you with me?
do you need everyone to like you?
everybody? Or am I enough?
think about it.
you stay. We belong dead.

forgive me, I didn't mean to startle you.
Oh, no. No, no. I borrowed this book.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no. Please, this is your home now.
you are safe here.
my brother will find me. He always does.
how could he?
our location is a highly classified secret.
Yes, but I know of it now, which means that he does, too.
we're twins.
even as children, a link has bound us one to the other.
something I cannot explain.
no need.
you look different.
Oh, do I?
perhaps my hair?
no.
it's your eyes. I can see your eyes.
Yes. Just trying a new look.
is that a map?
Yes, it was in the cylinder.
there are no coordinates.
perhaps there's a watermark.
you were very brave vouching for me.
how do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing me here?
it's as you were saying just now.
from intuition maybe, a link.
normally I'm able to read others quite quickly, but I've never met anyone like you.
nor I, like you.
good night, Abraham.
good night, Princess. Your Highness.
your Majesty. Your... Ma'am.
ma'am?
gute Nacht, Agent Hellboy.
look, Agent, I know you don't like me, but I could take away your badge.
never had one.
kept asking, though.
you will learn to obey me, follow protocol and stay fockused at all times.
Oh, that word "fockused.
Yeah, with your accent, I wouldn't use it that much.
I knew Professor Broom, young man.
you didn't know Professor Broom.
Yes, I did.
after my accident... - Shut up. Shut up.
...he designed this containment suit.
a wonderful man.
and even then he was worried about your future. He...
Hey, Gas Bag, stop it!
right now.
or what? Are you threatening me?
because I think I can take you.
excuse me?
you heard me.
I couldn't hear you from all the way over there.
I can take you because you have one fatal flaw.
Oh, I wanna hear it.
no, you don't. You can't take criticism.
try me.
can't take it.
what's my flaw?
your temper. It gets the best of you.
makes you weak. Makes you vulnerable.
Oh, crap.
Johann.
Johann? Johann?
Hey, Johann?
come on, pal. Hang in there, will you?
Johann? Johann?
damn.
there we are.
your temper, it makes you sloppy.
try to control it, Agent Hellboy.
before it controls you.
Glasshole.
Hello, Red.
well, you're up late.
what are you listening to?
Vivaldi. Il cimento dell'armonia.
I particularly like the last...
Hey, hey. What's that?
just a remote.
this? Yes.
popular Love Songs.
Oh, Abe.
you fell for the Princess.
she's... She's like me.
a creature from another world.
you need to get out more.
she's alone in the world. I wanna help her.
I need to care for her.
you're in love. Have a beer.
Oh, my body's a temple.

I know.
Yep, I'm gonna need a beer, too.
well, see, I love this song.
and I can't smile or cry.
I think I have no tear ducts.
I wish Father were here.
he'd know what to tell you. Us.
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything

I feel glad when you're glad

look at her. She's it, Abe.
she's it.
she's my whole wide...
you know?
Yeah. Yeah.
I would give my life for her.
but she also wants me to do the dishes.
I would die and do the dishes.
why is she mad at me?
it's not because the room is dirty.
something else.
well, ask her, then.
no.
listen, Abe.
Yeah.
when a woman's mad about something, but she's really mad about something else, you can't ask because then they get angry because you had to ask.
do you know what I mean?
never mind, don't answer that question.
you gotta just...
Yeah.
...find out.
very quick of you. The parchment.
it was of no importance.
the cylinder is very interesting.
we will find the Golden Army here.
as for the crown piece, I know it's here.
I can feel that much from you.

I know what's going on with Liz.

Abe.
I'm sorry. He has to know.
Abe!
know what?
Why?
stay back. I'll go first.
Abraham. No, don't... He'll kill you.
princess?
Abraham?
you talk to him like that?
No!
I will kill you, Abraham.
and anyone else if that is necessary.
well?
then why don't you just start with me, Your Royal Assness?
who put those there?
and your weapon of choice?
five-fingered Mary.
you move and I'll kill your Abraham first.
red, you mustn't harm the Prince.
what?
if you hurt him, you hurt the Princess.
you've gotta be kidding me.
will you give me the crown piece?
no.
the piece. No.
Abe?
red, I'm so sorry, but they're linked.
what's going on?
red. - Liz.
red, behind you.
you may have mused in the past, "Am I mortal?
you are now.
abraham, many people have died for this crown.
he will, too.
if you want to save him and see her again, you will find the missing piece and bring it to me.
Jesus, Abe, pull the damn thing out!
I cannot.
every time I touch it, every time I come close to it, it moves closer to his heart.
I don't know what else to do.
the wound will not heal until the spear is removed.
we're running out of time.
then we go after the Prince.
and we make him take it out.
Hey, Liz.
you were asking me.
don't talk.
no, no, let me tell you.
I know what's important.
it's you.
red.
I could turn my back on the world, all of it, as long as you stay with me.
I'll stay with you.

the cylinder yielded coordinates to County Antrim, Northern Ireland.
the Giant's Causeway. Right about here.
great. So we know where he is.
what are we waiting for?
we should get going.
the Prince will demand the crown piece, Agent Sherman.
so we give it to him.
Dr. Manning?
I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.
hold on here, what are you saying?
the Golden Army must not awaken.
so, what?
you're just gonna let him die, is that it?
I'm sorry.
we called Washington. We have our orders.
and what about you? He saved your life.
I know.
I know this is difficult for you, but...
well, I won't let him die.
agent Sherman, may I remind you that I am the leader of this team.
Oh, there's no doubt about that, sir.
that is what you are, Dr. Krauss.
and if ever you were human, that time is long gone.
what's wrong with her?
you want me to call her back, sir?
let her go.
I understand.
what about you?
you find anything?
no. Nothing yet.
well, keep looking.
absolutely, sir.
all of you.
but don't worry, sir, we know it's here, and we're gonna find it.
when Tom Manning gets on the case, things get done.
they get done. They get done!
100%. I guarantee that.
even without the piece, we have to get him out of here.
we'll go to Antrim, and we will find the Prince.
keep looking.
I ask you, everybody, keep looking.
Abe.
just the two of us.
Yes. Yes.
let's go.
we need to leave now, before they run our clearance upstairs.
Guten Abend, meine Freunde.
do you have authorization to take that plane?
you're not gonna stop us, Johann.
on the contrary, I've been giving it some thought, and we should be able to save Agent Hellboy.
you say I'm not human anymore, but you are wrong.
I understand your pain all too well.
a long time ago, I lost the woman I loved.
and that was, in fact, the source of my present misfortune.
I will tell you about it one day.
but for now, the tactical advantage is ours.
consider this, the Prince lacks the crown piece and without it, his army poses no threat.
so we have clearance, then?
agent Sherman, Liz, screw the clearance.
we will take that plane!
Antrim, Northern Ireland, 09: 00hrs
it should be here someplace.
the entrance should be here.
I don't understand.
perhaps there's a mistake on the map.
hello there!
I bid you welcome, strangers.
how can I be of assistance?
we seek safe passage to Bethmoora.
and what does a nice little girl like you want in the nightlands?
we are looking for Prince Nuada.
him, I know.
trade me something, and I'll take you to him.
here. I have a shiny belt.
but I have no pants.
look, a wonderful set of magic eyes.
I already have binoculars.
but I see something special, something shiny underneath the bandages.
I want that.
no, you can't take it out.
not without killing him.
maybe I know someone who can.
will you trade me then?
all right.
very well.
keep going. Keep going.
Oh, my God.
you should have seen this city when it was alive.
what happened to it?
curse.
as soon as the Golden Army was stored here, a plague of silence and death befell us.
and the world left us behind.
for a long time, I alone dwelled in the dust.
all right, little girl, the two of you come inside.
the rest of you, wait out here.
Hello, old friend.
I have brought you visitors.
and I have a favor to ask you.
I owe no favor to you, goblin. Leave.
but I have done so much for you.
I have brought you many souvenirs.
and he has something shiny.
red.
something mine.
red!
Anung un Rama.
you know that name?
and yours. Elizabeth Sherman.
at last.
I have been waiting for you both many a winter moon.
I am his death, and I will meet him at each crossroads.
good. But when can I have that which is mine?
can you save him?
it is for you to decide that.
it is all the same to me.
my heart is filled with dust and sand, but you should know it is his destiny to bring about the destruction of the Earth.
not now, not tomorrow, but soon enough.
knowing that, you still want him to live?
so, child, make the choice.
the world or him?
him.
the time will come and you, my dear, will suffer more than anyone.
I'll deal with it.
now save him.
it is done.
I have done what I can.
now, give him a reason to live.
Hey, friend, what about that which is mine?
don't forget about me. What about me?
friend?
shiny.
listen to me, you big ape.
you have to get up.
you have to get up.
cause you're gonna be a father.
I become father?
well, all this is very touching, but if you still want to meet Nuada, we have to leave now.
ready.
here we are.
and there they are.
seventy times 70 soldiers.
sometimes I wish I'd never created them.
Bim-bam went the hammers!
whoosh went the furnaces!
and one of those fires took my legs off, now.
this is as far as I can go.
I'm not very good with steps.
but if you're here to stop him, the Prince, I wish you luck then.
the Golden Army must not awaken.
undo what we did.
we will.
you're here.
so I assume you brought the remaining piece.
no. We didn't, but we should discuss...
I'm not addressing you, Tin Man.
Abraham.
Abraham?
my sister is well as I promised, so... - Abe?
don't do it.
what the hell are you doing?
you would do the exact same for Liz.
agent Sapien, no!
I am Prince Nuada, Silverlance, leader of the Golden Army.
is there anyone here who would dispute my right?
kill them.
but...
don't do it.
he lied to us.
abe, old buddy, if we ever get out of this, we gotta talk.
open wide!
Industrable, my ass.
Hey! Throw me a bone here!
Oh, crap.
well, I'm out of ideas.
I got one.
I challenge Prince Nuada for the right to command this army.
you challenge me?
who are you to challenge me?
you are nobody.
you are not royalty.
Yes. Yes! He is Anung un Rama, son of the Fallen One.
he has the right.
a challenge must be answered.
very well then.
red, please. Red, Think about it.
guys. Guys! - He will kill you.
don't do this, Red.
don't worry, babe.
I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.
but I am gonna kick his ass.
red.
nice ride, huh?
you jumpy, slippery bastard.
I got you now.
kill me. You must, for I will not stop.
I cannot. - Sorry, pal.
I win.
you live.
Nuala.
the humans, they will tire of you.
they have already turned against you.
leave them.
is it them or us?
which holocaust should be chosen?
I never had a chance to tell you how I felt.
give me your hand.
it's beautiful.
we die and the world will be poorer for it.
Nuala, my sister.
all that power.
don't even think about it.
no. No, it's nothing.
I told you, it's a dead end.
what are you doing? Go away.
check the belt locator.
check the belt locators, over there.
over there.
you, you took that plane without an authorization, young man.
Hey. Manning.
here to help as always.
what's going on? What's going on?
I quit.
what? Are you serious?
looks that way, doesn't it?
what's wrong with you? You can't all just quit.
watch us.
on second thought,
I think I'll keep this.
come on. Come on!
Johann, they can't do this. Stop them.
Dr. Manning, suck my ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.
so what you said before, about us living anywhere.
guys. Guys!
anywhere. You and me. - Come on back.
let's find a place in the country.
I said come on back.
clean air. Green hills.
a yard with lots of room to grow in.
it'll be great for the baby.
babies.
and I said yes!
bloody hell.
she's lying, right?
if you say so.
look, we've just gotta grit our teeth and do it.
tonight, when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
agreed.
Cho! -Harry!
watch yourself on the stairs. It's a bit icy at the top.
okay, thanks.
Cho?
yes?
well, I just wondered if you
I wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
sorry, I didn't catch that.
I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Harry...
...I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me.
and...
well, I've said I'll go with him.
okay. Yeah. Great.
fine. No problem.
okay. Good.
Harry?
I really am...
...sorry.
it's all right, Ron.
it's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter.
what happened to you?
he just asked Fleur Delacour out.
what? -What did she say?
no, of course.
she said yes? -Don't be silly.
there she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk.
I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out.
actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening.
and what did you do then? -What else? I ran for it.
I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
I always liked looking at them from behind.
she's never gonna forgive me, ever.
Hey!
bloody hell.
bloody hell.
bloody...
Oh, bloody...
what are those? What are those?
my dress robes. -Well, they're all right!
no lace. No dodgy little collar.
well, I expect yours are more traditional.
Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.
murder me, Harry.
leave it alone!
poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out.
who? -Hermione, of course.
come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.
Hello, boys. -Hello, boys.
don't you look...
...dashing.
there you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
ready, professor? -To dance.
it's traditional that the three champions-- Well, in this case, four.
are the first to dance.
surely I told you that. -No.
well, now you know.
as for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.
Oh, there you are. -Come on, then.
come along this way.
Oh, come on.
Hi. -Now, I need you all to line up...
...in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late.
this way. This way. Come along.
she looks beautiful!
Yeah, she does.
is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum?
no. Absolutely not.
Hi!
Harry, take my waist.
what? -Now!
are you ready?
move your body like a hairy troll
learning to rock and roll
spin around like a craxy elf
dancing by himself
boogie down like a unicorn
no stopping till the break of dawn
put your hands up in the air
like an ogre who just don 't care
can you dance like a Hippogriff?
ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?
I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library.
may I have your arm?
arm. Leg. I'm yours.
hot, isn't it?
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us?
no, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.
what's got your wand in a knot?
he's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy.
the enemy? Who was it wanting his autograph?
besides, the whole point of the tournament...
...is international magical cooperation...
...to make friends.
I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
are you going to ask me to dance or not?
no.
he's using you. -How dare you?!
besides, I can take care of myself. -I doubt it. He's way too old.
What?! What? That's what you think? -Yeah, that's what I think.
you know the solution then, don't you?
go on. -Next time there's a ball...
...pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does!
and not as a last resort.
well, that's-- I mean, that's just completely off the point.
Harry.
where have you been?
never mind! Off to bed, both of you.
they get scary when they get older. -Ron, you spoiled everything!
what's this about?
no, don 't let
this magic die
the answer's there
let me see it again.
Yes, the time is close now.
Harry, at last!
step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
you all right, Harry?
I just got in.
me.
Harry, you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.
the task is two days from now. -Really? I had no idea.
I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament.
actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.
I just mean he's not particularly loquacious.
mostly, he watches me study.
it's a bit annoying, actually.
you are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you?
what's that supposed to mean?
it just means these tasks are designed to test you...
...in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel.
and...
...I'm scared for you.
you got by the dragons mostly on nerve.
I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
Hey, Potter!
Potter! -Cedric.
How--? How are you?
spectacular.
I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
forget it. I'm sure you would've done the same for me.
exactly.
you know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor?
it's not a bad place for a bath.
just take your egg...
...and mull things over in the hot water.
I must be out of my mind.
I'm definitely out of my mind.
I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
myrtle!
Hello, Harry.
long time no see.
I was circling a blocked drain the other day...
...and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion.
not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?
Polyjuice Potion?
kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, "Try putting it in the water"?
that's what he did.
the other boy...
...the handsome one...
...Cedric.
well, go on. Open it.
come seek us Where our voices sound
we cannot sing Above the ground
an hour long you'll have to look
to recover what we took
Myrtle...
...there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there?
very good.
it took Cedric ages to riddle it out.
almost all the bubbles were gone.
Harry, tell me again.
come seek us where our voices sound.
the Black Lake, that's obvious.
an hour long you'll have to look.
again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic.
potentially problematic?
when's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione?
look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
hate to break up the skull session.
professor McGonagall wants you in her office.
not you, Potter, just Weasley and Granger.
but, sir, the second task is only hours away, and
exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now...
...and could do with a good night's sleep.
go. Now!
Longbottom!
why don't you help Potter put his books back.
you know, if you're interested in plants...
...you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.
do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees?
Neville, no offense, but I really don't care...
...about plants.
now, if there's...
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour...
...then great. But otherwise
I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed.
any bets? Any bets? -Come on, place your bets!
step up, mates! Don't be shy.
three lads. -One lady.
four go down. -But do four come up?
don't be so mean.
any bets? -Fleur's 1-1.
you're sure about this, Neville? -Absolutely.
for an hour? -Most likely.
most likely?
well, there is some debate among herbologists...
...as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water
you're telling me this now? You must be joking!
I just wanted to help.
well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione.
where are they anyway?
you seem a little tense, Harry. -Do l?
welcome to the second task,
last night, something was stolen from each of our champions,
a treasure of sorts,
these four treasures, one for each champion, , now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake,
in order to win, each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface, -Simple enough, except for this: -Put that in your mouth.
they will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only,
after that, they'll be on their own, No magic will save them,
you may begin at the sound of the cannon, -What's the matter with him? -I don ' t know, I can ' t see him.
Oh, my God. I ' ve killed Harry Potter.
Yeah!
what?
the Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour, has unfortunately been forced to retire, so she will take no further part in this task,
but she' s my friend too!
only one!
let's get down below.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Yes!
Harry!
he's all right.
he's all right. Barty!
go get him another towel. -I want all the judges over here now!
you saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save.
my little sister.
thank you.
and you! You helped.
well, yeah, a bit.
Harry! -Hermione!
are you all right? You must be freezing.
personally, I think you behaved admirably.
I finished last, Hermione.
next to last. Fleur never got past the Grindylows.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
come on! Come on! -Attention!
attention!
the winner is Mr. Diggory...
...who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head Charm.
however, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first...
...had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...
...but the others as well, we've agreed to award him...
...second place...
second place! -Well done!
...for outstanding moral fiber!
Yes!
right on. -All that moral fiber, eh?
it's great. -Moral fiber?
blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right.
Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber. -Congratulations, Potter.
a fine achievement. -Thank you.
well done, boy.
see you at Hagrid's, Harry. -I'm sorry we haven't spoken.
after all, your story is one I've heard so many times.
quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course...
...to lose one's family.
never whole again, are we?
still, life goes on...
...and here we stand.
I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter.
Bartemius!
not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we?
the last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!
and they say I'm mad.
now, I remember-- I remember when I first met you all.
biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.
suppose you remind me of meself a little.
and here we all are, four years later. -We're still a bunch of misfits.
well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
and Harry, of course.
soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been!
Hooray!
Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts
teach us something, please
Mr. Crouch?
a man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must take action.
I will not.
in times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!
then for once show them some!
the Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!
a true leader does what is right, no matter what others think.
what did you say to me? -Excuse me, gentlemen.
it may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.
Oh, Harry!
Harry, how good to see you again.
I can come back later, professor.
not necessary, Harry. The minister and l are done. I'll be back in a moment.
minister, after you.
there you are. Your hat.
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence.
but I have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp.
professor?
professor. -Yeah.
igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request...
...to present evidence to this council.
should your testimony prove consequential...
...council may be prepared to order your immediate release.
until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.
do you accept these terms?
I do, sir. -And what do you wish to present?
I have names, sir.
there was Rosier, Evan Rosier.
rosier is dead. -He took a piece of me with him...
...though, didn't he? -I didn't know.
lf that is all the witness has to offer-- -No, no, no.
there was Rookwood! He was a spy.
Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah, the same.
he passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself.
very well. Council will deliberate.
in the meantime, you will return to Azkaban.
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape?
as the council is aware, I've given evidence on this matter.
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...
...turned spy for us at great personal risk. -It's a lie!
today he's no more a Death Eater than I am. -Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!
Silence!
unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence...
...this session is now concluded.
Oh, no, no, no.
I've heard about one more.
what's that? -The name.
yes? -I know for a fact...
...this person took part in the capture...
...and, by means of the Cruciatus Curse...
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife!
the name. Give me the wretched name!
Barty Crouch...
...Junior.
hold him down!
get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men!
Hello, Father.
you are no son of mine.
curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution.
it's a Pensieve.
very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched.
it allows me to see once more things I've already seen.
you see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something...
...some small detail...
...something I might have overlooked...
...something that would explain why these terrible things have happened.
every time I get close to an answer, it slips away.
it's maddening.
sir? Mr. Crouch's son.
what exactly happened to him?
he was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it.
but he had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming.
why do you ask? -It's just that l...
I had a dream about him.
it was in the summer, before school.
in the dream, I was in a house,
and Voldemort was there, only he wasn 't quite human,
and Wormtail was there too, And Mr, Crouch 's son, -Have there been others like this dream? - Yes,
always the same one.
sir, these dreams...
...what I see, you don ' t think it' s actually happening, do you?
I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry.
I think it's best if you simply...
...cast them away.
it's a sign, Severus. You know what it means as well as l.
Potter!
what's your hurry?
congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring.
Gillyweed, am I correct?
Yes, sir.
ingenious.
a rather rare herb, gillyweed.
not something found in your everyday garden.
nor is this.
know what it is?
bubble juice, sir?
Veritaserum.
three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his darkest secrets.
the use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However...
...should you ever steal from my personal stores again...
...my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
I haven't stolen anything. -Don't lie to me.
gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?
you and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...
...I'm going to find out why!
Yeah! -Yeah!
Sonorus!
earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.
only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory...
...and Mr. Potter...
...are tied for first position...
...they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum...
...and Miss Delacour. -Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!
the first person to touch the cup will be the winner!
I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter.
should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task...
...he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.
contestants! Gather around. Quickly!
in the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep.
instead, you'll face something even more challenging.
you see, people change in the maze.
Oh, find the cup if you can.
but be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way.
champions, prepare yourselves!
good luck.
my boy. -See you later, Dad.
on the count of three. One
fleur?
Fleur.
get down!
get down!
no, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric!
get off me! -He's bewitched!
Yes.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Thanks. -No problem.
you know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me.
for a moment, so did l.
some game, huh?
some game.
go!
go on, take it. You saved me, take it!
together. One, two... -Two...
...three! -...three!
you okay? -Yeah. You?
where are we?
I've been here before.
it's a Portkey.
Harry, the cup is a Portkey. -I've been here before, in a dream.
Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now!
what are you talking about?
Harry! What is it? -Get back to the cup!
who are you? What do you want? -Kill the spare.
Avada Kedavra! -No! Cedric!
do it! Now!
bone of the father...
...unwillingly given.
flesh of the servant...
...willingly sacrificed.
and blood of the enemy...
...forcibly taken.
the Dark Lord shall rise...
...again.
my wand, Wormtail.
hold out your arm.
master.
thank you, master.
the other arm, Wormtail.
welcome, my friends.
thirteen years it's been, and yet...
...Here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday.
I confess myself...
...disappointed.
not one of you tried to find me.
Crabbe! Macnair!
Goyle!
not even you...
...Lucius.
my Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts
there were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers.
I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways.
the face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence...
...that is my true mask.
I returned.
out of fear, not loyalty.
still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail.
thank you, master.
thank you.
such a handsome boy. -Don't touch him!
Harry.
I'd almost forgotten you were here.
standing on the bones of my father. Yeah.
I'd introduce you...
...but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days.
the boy who lived.
how lies have fed your legend, Harry.
shall I reveal what really happened that night 1 3 years ago?
shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers?
Yes, shall l?
it was love.
you see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son...
...she provided the ultimate protection.
I could not touch him.
it was old magic.
something I should have foreseen.
but no matter, no matter.
things have changed.
I can touch you...
...now.
Yeah.
astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?
pick up your wand, Potter.
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!
you've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes?
first, we bow to each other.
come on, now, Harry. The niceties must be observed.
Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he?
I said, bow.
that's better. And now... -No.
attaboy, Harry.
your parents would be proud.
especially your filthy Muggle mother.
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.
I'm going to destroy you.
after tonight, no one will ever again question my powers.
after tonight, if they speak of you...
...they'll speak only of how you...
...begged for death.
and l, being a merciful Lord...
...obliged.
get up!
don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter!
I want you to look at me when I kill you!
I want to see the light leave your eyes!
have it your way.
do nothing! He's mine to finish!
he's mine!
Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey.
we can linger for a moment to give you some time...
...but only a moment. Do you understand?
Harry, take my body back, will you?
take my body back to my father.
let go.
sweetheart, you're ready.
let go! Let go!
No!
he did it!
Harry!
Harry!
No! No! No, don't!
for God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened?
he's back. He's back.
Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back.
I couldn't leave him, not there.
it's all right, Harry. It's all right.
he's home. You both are.
keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed.
the body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people.
let me through.
let me through!
let me through!
that's my son!
that's my boy!
it's my boy!
come on. Get up. Easy, easy! -No.
this is not where you want to be right now. Come on.
No!
it's all right, I got you.
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.
No!
No!
are you all right, Potter?
does it hurt? That?
not so much now.
perhaps I'd better take a look at it.
the cup was a Portkey.
someone had bewitched it.
what was it like?
what was he like? -Who?
the Dark Lord.
what was it like to stand in his presence?
I don't know.
it was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams...
...into one of my nightmares.
were there others?
in the graveyard, were there others?
I...
I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor.
marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?
did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods...
...if I hadn't suggested it?
do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater...
...if I hadn't told him first myself?
did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder...
...could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book...
...that led him straight to it?
it was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.
you bewitched Krum, but you-- -"But-- But
you won because I made it so, Potter.
you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.
and now the deed is done.
the blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord.
imagine how he will reward me when he learns...
...that I have once and for all...
...silenced the great Harry Potter.
Severus.
that's it, take it.
do you know who I am? -Albus Dumbledore.
are you Alastor Moody? Are you? -No.
is he in this room? Is he in this room?
Harry, away from there!
you all right, Alastor? -I'm sorry, Albus.
that's Moody. But then who's--?
Polyjuice Potion.
now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus.
we'll get you up in a minute.
Harry!
Barty Crouch Junior.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
your arm, Harry.
you know what this means, don't you?
he's back.
lord Voldemort has returned.
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.
send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
I'll be welcomed back like a hero. -Perhaps.
personally, I've never had much time for heroes.
today, we acknowledge...
...a really terrible loss.
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...
...exceptionally hard-working...
...infinitely fair-minded...
...and, most importantly...
...a fierce, fierce friend.
now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died.
you see...
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...
...By Lord Voldemort!
the Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this.
but not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory.
now, the pain...
...we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me...
...and reminds us...
...that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues...
...our hearts beat as one.
in light of recent events...
...the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever.
remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain.
you remember that...
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...
...kind and honest...
...and brave and true, right to the very end.
I never liked these curtains.
set them on fire in my fourth year.
by accident, of course.
I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry.
professor...
...when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment...
...when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
priori Incantatem,
you saw your parents that night, didn't you?
they reappeared.
no spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that.
dark and difficult times lie ahead.
soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.
but remember this:
you have friends here.
you're not alone.
Hermione.
this is for you.
write to me. Promise.
Bye.
au revoir, Ron.
do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
no. -No.
no, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons?
everything's going to change now, isn't it?
Yes.
promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
I won't. You know I won't.
Harry will, won't you? -Yeah. Every week.
next! Ron!
concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!
wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
you see? Very good, very good!
marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!
show us what you see.
keep your nerve. Steady.
Riddikulus!
and next! Step up, step up!
wonderful, wonderful!
here!
Riddikulus!
right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today.
collect your books from the back.
sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
should your behavior reflect poorly on the school...
...that privilege shall not be extended again.
no permission form signed, no visiting the village.
that's the rule, Potter.
those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.
forget about it, guys. See you later.
professor, can I ask you something?
you want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
but then I remembered that night on the train...
...and the dementor. -I'm very impressed.
that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
before I fainted...
...I heard something.
a woman...
...screaming.
dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother...
...the night she was murdered.
the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
they're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her.
your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
not only was she a singularly gifted witch...
...she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
she had a way of seeing the beauty in others...
...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
and your father, James, on the other hand...
...he....
a talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
you're more like them than you know, Harry.
in time, you'll come to see just how much.
we never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
you heard it's the most-- -Haunted building in Britain. I know.
what's going on?
probably Neville forgot the password again.
Hey. -Oh, you're there.
let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
get back, all of you.
no one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
the Fat Lady! She's gone!
serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
be quiet. -Make way.
the headmaster's here. -Come on, move.
you heard. Move!
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
there's no need for ghosts, professor.
the Fat Lady's there.
mind where you're going! Slow down!
you listen! I'm Head Boy!
dear lady, who did this to you?
eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
it's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about.
Sirius Black!
secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
thank you. -The third floor's clear too, sir.
very good. -I've done the dungeons.
no sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
remarkable feat, don't you think?
to enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
...completely undetected? -Quite remarkable, yes.
any theories on how he managed it?
many. Each as unlikely as the next.
you may recall...
...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns...
...about your appointment of Professor
not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...
...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
what about Potter? Should he be warned?
perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.
for in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
turn to page 394.
excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?
that's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching...
...at the present time. Turn to page 394.
Werewolves"?
sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
we're not meant to start that for weeks. -Quiet.
when did she come in? Did you see her come in?
now, which one of you can tell me the difference...
...between an Animagus and a werewolf?
no one?
an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
a werewolf has no choice.
with each full moon...
...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend.
the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time...
...you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
are you incapable of restraining yourself...
...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
he's got a point, you know. -Five points from Gryffindor.
as an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning...
...Two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis...
...on recognizing it. -It's Quidditch tomorrow.
then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word " wer..."
...which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
there are several ways to become a werewolf.
they include being given the power of shape-shifting...
...being bitten by a werewolf....
go, Harry! Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
he looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? -Peaky?
what do you expect? He fell over 1 00 feet.
let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
probably a right sight better than he normally does.
how are you feeling? -Oh, brilliant.
you gave us a right good scare.
what happened? -Well, you fell off your broom.
Really? I meant the match. Who won?
no one blames you, Harry.
dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
after he saved you, he sent them off.
there's something else you should know too.
when you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and....
well....
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
they feed on every good feeling, every happy memory...
...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
you are not weak, Harry.
dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
you have nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm scared, professor. -I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me.
you made the one on the train go away.
but as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you...
...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays.
for now, I need to rest.
last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!
guys, let me go. -Clever, Harry.
but not clever enough. -We've got a better way.
I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. -We know.
we'll get you there.
we'll show you a quicker way. -lf you pipe down.
bless him. -Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't
now, Harry. -Come and join the big boys.
what's this rubbish? -"What's this rubbish? " he says.
it's the secret to our success. -It's a wrench giving it to you
but we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs...
...are proud to present the Marauder's Map.
we owe them so much.
hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that
no. Is that really--? -Dumbledore.
ln his study. -Pacing.
does that a lot.
so this map shows--? -Everyone.
where they are. -What they're doing.
every minute. -Every day.
brilliant! Where did you get it? -From Filch's office.
first year. -There are seven secret passageways...
...out of the castle. -We'd recommend this one.
the One-Eyed Witch passageway. -Leads you to Honeyduke's.
hurry. Filch is heading this way.
and don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
now, how much do you want?
delicious.
it's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
twice.
do you want to move a bit closer?
to the Shrieking Shack?
actually, I'm fine here.
well, well. Look who's here.
you two shopping for your new dream home?
bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in one room?
shut your mouth, Malfoy. -Not very friendly.
boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
hope you don't mean yourself. -How dare you talk to me!
you filthy little mudblood!
who is that?
don't stand there! Do something! -What?
what's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
get out of the way!
move!
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Harry!
bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny.
he won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
aren't you? -Sure. Along with his lnvisibility Cloak.
look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
Ron fancies her. -That's not true!
professor McGonagall! -Cornelius!
allow me, minister.
Oh, Hagrid.... -Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good.
it'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors...
...into my pub every other night! -We have....
we have a killer on the loose. -Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
and what would bring him here?
Harry Potter. -Harry Potter?
come.
Harry!
no underage wizards allowed in today! -Shut the damn door!
so rude. -Thick heads.
thick heads?! -How dare they!
who are they calling thick heads? -Young whippersnappers!
nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
tell me what this is all about.
years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death
remember? They hid. Few knew where they were.
one who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who.
not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night...
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
Peter Pettigrew? -Little lump of a boy.
always trailing after Black. -I remember.
never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
what happened? -Peter tried to warn the Potters...
...and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew.
a finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters...
I don't believe it. -That's not the worst of it.
...and remains to this day...
...Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. -Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
he was their friend...
...and he betrayed them.
he was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
when he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
there you are. You came.
are you sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic...
...well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
well, everything's prepared.
the spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
did you ever hear of it?
no? Well....
a Patronus is a positive force. For the wizard who conjures one...
...it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
but in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
can you do this? Yes. Very well.
close your eyes.
explore your past.
do you have a memory?
allow it to fill you up.
lose yourself within it.
then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
Expecto Patronum. -Very good.
shall we? Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto.... Expecto....
Expect....
here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths.
that would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
that's one nasty dementor. -Oh, no, no, no.
that was a boggart, Harry. A boggart.
the real thing would be worse. Much, much worse.
as a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
which memory did you choose? -The first time I rode a broom.
that's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.
there's another. It's not happy, exactly.
it's the happiest I've ever felt...
...but it's complicated. -ls it strong?
then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
well done, Harry. Well done!
I think I've had enough for today. -Yes. Sit down. Here.
eat this, it helps. It really helps.
and just so you know, Harry...
...I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that...
...is saying something.
and Mum.
seeing their faces.
they were talking to me.
just talking.
that's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
but it's the best I have.
beautiful day. -Gorgeous.
unless you've been ripped to pieces!
ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
ronald has lost his rat. -I haven't lost anything!
your cat killed him! -Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
...is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone.
well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
your cat killed him! -Did not.
did. -Didn't.
how did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
well, first off, the committee members took turns...
...talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak...
and then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine.
he said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature...
...who would kill you as soon as look at you.
and then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
they're not sacking you! -No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
spiders! There's-- There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
I don't wanna tap-dance! -You tell those spiders.
right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them....
Peter Pettigrew/ -Little lump of a boy.
always trailing after Sirius Black. -Black was vicious.
he didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
put that light out! -Sorry.
watch it there, boy. -We're trying to sleep here!
mischief managed. Nox.
Potter.
what are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
how extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
he, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
my dad didn't strut. And nor do l.
now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
turn out your pockets.
turn out your pockets!
what's this?
spare bit of parchment. -Really? Open it.
reveal your secrets.
read it.
messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs...
...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and....
go on.
and request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.
you insolent little-- -Professor!
well, well. Lupin.
out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
that remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise.
clearly, it's full of dark magic. -I seriously doubt it, Severus.
...who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product.
nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
it is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.
are you deaf? Put that light out!
come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession...
...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black...
...is a map to you?
no. -No, sir.
your father never set much store by the rules either.
but he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected...
...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
now, I will not cover up for you again.
do you hear me? -Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
and don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know.
professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really? And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
that's not possible.
it's just what I saw.
good night, professor.
broaden your minds. You must look beyond.
the art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.
now, what do we have here?
do you mind me trying?
the Grim, possibly.
my dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class...
...for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there.
you may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled...
...as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books...
...to which you so desperately cleave.
have I said something?
she's gone mental, Hermione has. Not that she wasn't always mental...
...but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
hang on.
we better take this back. -I'm not going back.
fine. See you later. -See you.
Harry Potter....
professor Trelawney-- -He will return tonight.
sorry?
tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder...
...shall break free.
innocent blood shall be spilt...
...and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?
no.
nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
lt just got worse. -What did I say? Father said...
...I can keep the hippogriff's head. I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
this is going to be rich.
look who's here. -Come to see the show?
you! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
he's not worth it.
malfoy, are you okay?
let's go. Quick. -Not a word to anyone, understood?
that felt good. -Not good, brilliant.
look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
why don't we just set him free?
they'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore...
...would get into trouble. He's coming down, Dumbledore.
says he wants to be with me when they....
when it happens.
great man, Dumbledore.
a great man.
we'll stay with you too. -You'll do no such thing!
think I want you seeing something like that? No.
you just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron....
Scabbers! You're alive!
keep a closer eye on your pet. -I think you owe someone an apology.
right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
blimey. What was that?
Hagrid!
no, minister. Over this way.
it's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here.
someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment!
quick. Quick!
Hagrid.
lt'll be fine. It'll be okay. -Go on, go on!
that's ling you see over there-- -On the slope.
on the slope-- Ah, Hagrid. -Professor Dumbledore.
good evening. -Minister. Make your way through.
have a tea, if you like. -No, Hagrid.
gentlemen. -I'd like a cup of tea.
well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal...
...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak...
...hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
dear, dear.... -Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.
all right. It'll be all right. -The execution shall dispatch
what?
I thought I just saw
never mind. -Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
he bit me. Scabbers.
Ron. Ron!
Ron! -Scabbers, come back.
wait!
Scabbers, you bit me! -Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
Harry, Hermione, run!
it's the Grim!
Harry! -Ron! Ron, wait!
Harry!
help! -Ron!
Ron. Ron. -Ron!
come on!
move!
duck!
Harry!
Oh, I'm sorry. -Don't worry.
where do you suppose this goes? -I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
we're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
come on.
Ron.
Ron. You're okay. -The dog. Where is it?
it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.
if you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
no. Only one will die tonight.
then it'll be you!
are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
I found him. -I know.
he's here. -I understand.
let's kill him! -No! I trusted you!
and all this time, you've been his friend.
he's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.
how long have you known?
since Professor Snape set the essay. -Well, Hermione.
you are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!
see...
...man ain't like a dog.
and when l say " man,
l'm talking about man as in mankind, not man as in men.
because men, well, we a lot like a dog.
you know, we like to piss on things.
sniff a bitch when we can.

I'm bored out of my fucking mind.
now, I'm sure I'd have a much rosier outlook on life if my wife and I actually had sex, but there always seems to be something wrong.
no, my face hurts.
it's not your birthday.
we both work, we're both tired, but that's no excuse.
to be honest, I don't know how much more of this I can take.
Richard, do you think perhaps you work too much?
Oh, no, no, no.
I - I work, too. I do.
but I come home from work, and I have to take care of the kids, and I have to take care of you.
and frankly, I'm tired.
I'm tired.
too tired to wear a nice pair of panties?
what's wrong with my panties?
they're huge!
that's all I want to see: Tag and ass.
tag and ass!
BRENDA: You see? You see?
this is what I'm talking about. - Mm-hmm.
you see how insensitive he is?
you know, Brenda, maybe I'd be more sensitive if you'd have sex with me.
it seems like the only time she wants to have sex with me is to make a baby.
the only time you want to make a baby with me is to have sex.
that doesn't make any sense!
well, that's because I'm tired!
now we're making progress.
richard: I hated that therapist.
she wasn't married and didn't have any kids.
you know, when you're on a plane, you kind of want a pilot with more experience than you.
but maybe that's just me.
now, what I can't figure out is how can my wife not have sex with me, and then send me out into a world with so many beautiful women?
that's like dropping me into the ocean and expecting me to not get wet.
I mean, every single woman that I see
I have an imaginary relationship with.
like this one.
Ah, she's got beautiful lips.
but if we got married, how long would it be before I got tired of those lips?
how long would it be before those lips called me an asshole?
and look at her.
what a smile.
she looks happy now, but if I was married to her for eight years,
I'djust be thinking about that phone bill.
and look at her.
look at those eyes, those cheekbones.
she's like a painting... a painting I'd love to mount.
no matter where my head is, when I get to Manhattan, I'm fine.
I love the city, rats and all.
I love my job.
I'm an investment banker at a mid-size firm.
I'm one of the only blacks at the company.
as a matter of fact, there are so few blacks here,
I think I know every black person that works for the firm.
morning, Pam.
howdy, Mr. Cooper.
morning, Ron.
good morning, Richard.
#Yo, fuck the cracker #
#That's what I say #
#And fuck these bitches that always want to play #
# I'm the type of nigga that is never gay #
# If you fuck with me, I'll put your head in cake #
# If you fuck with me, I'll shoot your moms at your wake #
# If you fuck with me, you made a big mistake. #
okay.
Tracy...
this is what we're doing today, all right?
seen George?
I'm right here.
see you later, Mary.
George, your wife is on the phone, and Veronica called.
wife? I don't want to talk to her.
find out what she wants.
call back Veronica.
rich, you want to go over that stuff before Landis gets in?
sure, just, uh, take off your coat...
good morning, everyone.
Cooper, how's the Coleman account?
incredible. The Narco funds are up.
LANDIS: All right.
let's get to work, people.
TRACY: Pupkin & Langford. Please hold.
Pupkin & Langford.
lunch?
well, I got to ask.
come on, you know I hate the crowds.
by the time you get your food, you got to come back.
well, have fun all by yourself.
I'm gonna get a quick bite and then get on the Coleman account.
see ya.
richard: Hey, I got nothing against George, but I just hate going to lunch at the same time everybody else does.
it's just way too crowded.
look at this mess.
it's just not the New York that I like.
now, at 2: 00, it's a different story.
things slow down.
that's when I like to go out.
I can eat, or I can go shopping, or I can just clear my head.
and I can also watch women and get a good look.
cause I know I will never see them again.
now, you can't look at a woman in the suburbs.
you stare at a soccer mom too long, and they'll post your name on the Internet.
can I help you find something?
just looking.
have you seen the new Prada suits?
no, that's okay, that's okay.
excuse me, sir, would you like to try a new fragrance today?
Nah, that's okay.
Oh.
Hey! Don't spray that shit on me.
it's really good.
Hi, I'm Candy.
can I help you with something?
do you have this in blue?
you know, I think you should try this green one.
uh, l - I don't really wear green.
okay, but this green is hot.
come on. Trust me.
let's go try it on.
I'm telling you, I don't like green.
that looks great on you.
you think so?
Absolutely. It's sexy.
I love it.
I just don't like wearing green.
Yeah, but you should start wearing green.
I mean, you look really handsome in it.
Hey, Lisa.
will you tell him how this shirt looks.
Oh, I love it on you!
I'm - I'm not just saying that.
I think it looks great on you.
daddy's home.
BRENDA: Daddy's home.
kelly: Daddy!
Yeah!
daddy's home.
Hey, Daddy.
how's it going?
pretty good.
Where's Brian?
Oh, he's upstairs napping.
Oh, hey, I've got all these tests to grade, so can you do the dishes tonight?
Yeah, yeah, no problem. - Great.
Hey, Kelly.
Hi, Daddy.
how big is Kelly?
this big.
richard: Yeah. Where's Kelly's ear?
here.
Where's Kelly's nose? - Here.
Where's Kelly's esophagus?
give the kid a break: She's only three.
Hey, there's white kids that are three taking the bar right now.
W-H-l-T-E, please.
okay, okay.
Hey, Kelly, I got you.
daddy got you.
right upside the head. - You went shopping? Huh.
daddy got you.
I thought you didn't like green.
figured I'd get something new.
it's different.
pretty.
richard: There were days when Brenda and I got along great.
but we still weren't having sex.
when a married couple stops having sex, at first, they complain about it.
but after a while, they get used to it.
she walks out of the shower, you don't even look.
cause you know there's nothing there for you.
the most dangerous time in a marriage is when the couple accepts that they're not having sex.
speak up: I'm in an elevator.
TRACY: Richard, there's someone here to see you.
uh, a client?
she didn't say.
Nikki?
richard: Wow, Nikki Tru.
I haven't seen her in eight years.
she was my best friend's girl.
I was crazy about her.
what's wrong?
you didn't think you'd see me again?
no, it's not that: I'm just surprised.
wow, you look good, Nikki.
Thanks.
you know, people don't really smoke in offices anymore.
I'm not really a smoker.
I'm just trying to lose some weight.
so what's that, a diet cigarette?
I'll put it out.
you look good, Richie.
that's a nice shirt.
Thanks.
so, wh-what brings you around, Nikki?
I was in the neighborhood, heard you worked in the area, thought I'd stop by and say hi.
that's allowed, right?
Yeah. Hi.
Hi.
you want to show me your office or something?
come on.
okay.
it's good to see you.
Yeah, you, too.
which way? - This way.
ni KKI: Are these your kids?
Yeah, that's my son Brian and that's my daughter Kelly.
same mother?
same mother, my wife, seven years.
no side kids?
no side kids.
I know, it's very white of me.
richard Marcus Cooper is married.
tied the knot, till death do you part.
Mm-hmm.
something strange about that?
no. Just...
not the Richie I knew.
people change. - Hmm.
you happily married?
Yeah, I'm - I'm happily married.
no, you're not.
you didn't say it right.
okay, how was I supposed to say it?
Oh, I don't know.
but you're not supposed to think about it.
I hear ice cracking.
what?
you ever walk across a frozen river and hear ice cracking?
it's the scariest sound in the world.
Hey, hey.
my ice is fine.
my - my marriage is frozen solid.
you could do a triple axel on my marriage.
one second.
hello.
TRACY: They're ready to start the meeting.
Yeah, yeah, I'll come right now.
so, to be completely honest,
I do need a favor.
Ah. I knew Nikki didn't come over here for nothing.
well, I just got back in town, and I'm trying to get a job, but I need a reference.
okay, well, write up a letter, bring it by, and I'll sign it.
no problem. Whoa!
magic.
so you just knew I would sign this, huh?
I figured a friend in need, couldn't resist.
okay.
good luck.
thank you...
Mr. Married Man.
richard: Even though I hadn't seen Nikki - in eight years, I got to say, - Richard.
she looked even better than I remembered.
kelly: Do I have to eat this, Mommy?
BRENDA: Kelly... - Hey.
Hey, Daddy. - Hey, honey.
Mm.
I'm almost done with them, and dinner will be ready in a few minutes, okay?
is baked chicken okay?
Ah, you know chicken's great.
all right.
Where's my kiss?
Ooh, that's a good kiss.
what's up, Bri?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
so how was school?
you know that test I was giving?
I had to give it again.
they all got A's.
Oh, um, Allison wants to have a playdate this weekend at her house.
any B-L-A-C-K kids gonna be there?
a few. Not enough.
that'll be good.
I got to do something.
Hey, how was, um, work today?
anything happen?
Ah, nothing much, just work.
richard: I'm not crazy.
would you tell your wife about Nikki?
but I got to admit, seeing Nikki got me to thinking.
what would it be like to be single again?
I mean, if I were single,
I wouldn't do all that romance-and-flowers crap.
if I were single again, I would get right to the point.
excuse me, would you like to have sex with me?
of course I would. - Well, come on!
when you're single, you're never at a loss for words.
excuse me, can I bite your ass?
for $1, 000.
come on, let's get biting, bitch!
when you're single, you have nothing to lose.
come with me to a hotel right now.
but I have an appointment.
Yeah, a pussy appointment.
when you're single, you're invincible.
excuse me...
get the fuck out of here!
when you're single, you're alone.
I'll fuck you.
and that's why I got married.
when I went to work the next day, being single was the last thing on my mind.
I had a lot to do, there was a big client I wanted to bring in, and I needed to be focused.
you know what I always say, valuation's an art not a science.
Hey, want to go to lunch?
I got a plan how we can reel in EuroTech.
I'm gonna pass on the lunch, but let's talk about it when you get back.
have fun with yourself.
Walter, listen,
I know you're in bed with Cross and Lubitsch, but I'm telling you right now, you're gonna see some things in the...
there's a Nikki Tru on line one.
: tell her to hold.
well, I just want you to know that our doors are always open.
all right, take care, Walter.
Nikki.
Hey.
I got the job.
good.
so as a thank you,
I was thinking you should let me take you to lunch.
you know, I don't normally do lunch till late.
well, that's okay, 'cause I'm still in bed, but I could get in the shower and be to you in about an hour.
you know, I got a lot of work to do, Nikki.
but you are gonna eat lunch, right?
so I'll be there at 2: 00.
okay?
okay.
good.
Bye.
man: Excuse me, miss, there's no smoking.
okay, I'm putting it out.
I live on the West Side with Teddy.
he has a place here and in D.C. although most of my stuff is in D.C.
so how'd you meet Teddy from D. C?
he's a club promoter.
I met him out.
you know how it goes.
Yeah.
so do I know your wife?
I don't think so.
is she white?
no.
why - why would you ask that?
don't get offended.
remember that girl you brought to Andre's party?
it was one girl at one party.
I - I go out with one white girl, all of a sudden, I'm Prince?
no, it was just a question.
I didn't mean anything by it.
so do you and your black wife still fuck?
and what's it to you?
Mmm, just curious.
most of the people I know who are still married say that after a while, they don't fuck.
so do you love Teddy?
you didn't answer my question.
cause it's none of your fucking business.
I'll take that as a no.
so, Mr. Married Man, how did you meet this black wife of yours?
you don't want to know.
no, I do.
sort of.
I was...
coming from a meeting, I was walking by the park, and she was there with her class, this beautiful woman with these kids.
I don't know - there was just something really calm about her.
and I was like, "I got to meet her.
NIKKl: Wow.
: I guess I was wrong.
you do love your wife.
I've thought about it.
doing the whole wife thing, having kids.
I'm getting a little old for the club scene.
I don't even know how you do it.
hanging out late, - eating cheeseburgers at 4: 00 in the morning. - God...
come on.
you used to love this shit.
you just let yourself get old.
I just let myself get bored.
this was fun.
we should do this again.
Yeah. Maybe.
okay.
richard: Saturday is the one day I like to sit in my house and relax.
unfortunately, it's also the same day that Brenda likes to go into Manhattan and shop.
Brenda didn't like living in the city, but she sure liked buying her clothes there.
honey, why don't you get these?
I like them.
Oh, yeah.
okay, well, let's find your size so that you can wear them.
Ah, come on, we drove all the way to the city.
you could've got those at the Panty Depot.
Oh, come on. No, I like these.
and they're comfortable, and they're cute. - Richard?
Richard.
I thought you lived in Westchester.
what are you doing here? - Hey.
Nikki, Brenda.
Brenda, Nikki.
Hi. - Hi.
Nikki's an old friend.
uh, what's it been, like, seven, eight years?
at least.
uh, Nikki used to date Nelson, remember?
Yes. Yes!
: right.
and who is this handsome guy?
Oh, well, that's my Brian.
and that's Kelly.
kelly: Hi.
she's gorgeous.
of course, like her mom.
thank you.
say, "thank you," Kelly.
kelly: Thank you.
these are great.
where did you get these?
is this the Heavenly Collection?
no, they're from the Latifah Collection.
: okay.
stop.
um, actually, I don't know what they are.
but I got them downstairs.
well, I should go pay for these.
um, it was really nice to meet you.
Yes.
and it was great seeing you, Richard.
Oh, great to see you.
guys.
KELLY/BRIAN: Bye-bye.
so she's the one that, uh, Nelson tried to kill himself over?
Yeah, he - he was going through a lot back then.
huh.
Yeah, guess he was.
I'm gonna take these back.
richard: Okay, that was a lie.
but big deal.
I mean, nothing happened.
Nikki's a friend.
an old friend.
I mean, I've known Nikki longer than I've known Brenda.
she used to date Nelson.
we had a lot of fun together.
I mean, sh - she makes me laugh.
th - There's nothing wrong with that, right?
Nikki's an old friend, a good friend.
a friend I can't tell my wife about.
morning, Richard.
Nikki called. - Five minutes ago.
she said she'll be by at 6: 00.
is there something wrong?
no.
nothing. - Nothing at all.
wall sconces?
well, they're not expensive and we can get an electrician to put them in.
what do you think of art deco?
art deco's fine.
NIKKl: Hey.
okay, if we go with art deco, we might have to reupholster the couch.
I thought we were talking about wall sconces.
well, they have to match, honey.
if they don't match, then I got to change the rug.
if I have to change the rug... - I guess you're right.
uh, honey, could we talk about this later?
Yes. Look, I have to go - it's parent-teacher night.
I fixed you a plate, so just heat it up when you get home.
okay. So I'll - I'll talk to you later.
wall sconces.
sounds fun.
when exactly do you start getting calls at work about wall sconces?
right after you get married.
I mean, before you get married, you get calls like...
I can't wait to suck your dick.
then, after you get married, you get calls like...
I can't wait for you to come home and see these drapes.
poor Mr. Married Man.
I hope you don't mind me stopping by like this, but I bought something for your kids.
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you guys.
Hey, you didn't have to get me anything.
I know.
Thanks.
this stuff's expensive.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I put it on Teddy's credit card.
so now I owe Teddy some money.
so you're the expert - what do you think?
would I make a good wife?
Nikki, you don't want to be a wife.
Why?
you want a wedding.
you want the show.
Mm-hmm.
what are you looking at?
you have any singles?
Yeah, I should have about seven, eight bucks.
what do you need?
just give me all of it.
all right, I'm gonna have to break into my stripper stash.
what are you doing?
feeding the fish.
come here.
look.
okay, who is gonna get it?
Oh, look at this guy.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoo!
Shh!
it's just a dollar.
it's just a dollar.
it's just a buck.
this is decadent. - Try it.
all right. All right, here we go.
Whoo!
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Yeah!
you're going to cause a riot.
well done!
Yes!
Oh, wow!
Ooh, look at the homeless guy.
Oh, get the mon... Oh, he needs it.
never gonna get it.
Nope. Going too slow.
come on, homeless guy. You need that money.
get it.
Nope. - Oh!
white man wins again.
richard: That was fun.
that was too much fun.
you know what?
I better take my wife out to dinner and get the stench of fun with another woman off of me.
BRENDA: I don't even want to go that way,: You can't go down the FDR.
woman: Oh, God, no. - It's insane.
richard: Okay, this is safe.
dinner with Allan and Jennifer.
once you get married, you only hang out with other married people.
Why?
cause no single person could stand to be around you.
it wasn't always like this.
we all used to talk about sex, politics, art.
but now, all we ever talk about is our kids.
of course, I had to miss the end, because I had a little exploding diaper problem.
and when it's not our kids, it's always the same conversation.
first, there's the rap conversation.
...hos, hos, hos in different area codes.
I'm kind of wondering, did anybody have a nice mama?
was it a situation where their mama smacked them upside their head, and they said, "Bitch!
then there's the conversation about the Jews.
they had it just as bad as us.
black folks need to take care of themselves just as well as the Jews take care of themselves.
except we can't stick together - that's the problem.
we're too busy buying spinning rims and gold teeth.
you think Steven Spielberg got spinning rims?
and no group of people are too sophisticated to have a conversation about Michael Jackson.
I blame Joe.
ALLAN: Please, what grown-ass man sleeps in a bed with kids?
michael Jackson just didn't have a childhood.
Hey, man, childhood's only 12, 15 years.
Michael's, like, 50.
how many sliding boards does this nigga need?
you know good and well you would not let that man babysit your kids.
I wouldn't let Michael Jackson watch my kids on TV.
Amen.
maybe he thought the little boy was 18.
ALLAN: You can't confuse the little boy.
give me a break.
JENNIFER: Just yesterday, little Sharon came into the room singing "Magic Stick."
I said, "Magic Stick"? Little girl, you're four years old.
what do you know about a magic stick?
can I take your drink orders?
BRENDA: Honey?
uh, you know what? I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
honey, can you just get me some water?
ALLAN: Think I'll take a ginger ale.
J ENNI FER: I'll have a Chardonnay.
okay.
excuse me, can I talk to you for a second?
is there a problem, sir?
Yes, there's a problem.
see, I came here for a lovely dinner with my wife and some friends, and next thing I know is I got these big tits asking me if I want a drink.
do you mean your waitperson?
listen, man, I'm with my wife.
I don't need this shit.
I don't need some girl, with her big-ass village feeders, asking me if I need some help.
is this Hooters?
no, sir.
is it Hooters? - No, sir.
I know this ain't Hooters, 'cause - 'cause if it is, you owe me some fucking buffalo wings.
: sir, what can I do to make this better?
see that guy right there?
Yes, I do.
that's my waiter.
thank you, sir.
thank you.
what are you doing here?
you okay?
so he just got up and said, "It's over"?
no, you don't understand.
if we're fucking and I fall asleep, that's fine.
if we're fucking and we both fall asleep, that's okay, too, but if we're fucking and you fall asleep, it's - it's fucked up!
he didn't say it's over, but I know it's over.
you-you got to excuse her: She's upset.
the fuck are you looking at?!
our stop's coming up.
richard: When Nikki came by to see me in the afternoon, it wasn't really a big deal.
but when we walked through the office at 9: 00 a.m...
good morning.
...people looked at me like I was crazy.
I mean crazy.
it's like we've been breaking up for months, and I'm just finding out about it now.
well, that's how relationships are.
you add how long you been together, and then you divide it by two, and that's how long you been breaking up.
so if you get a divorce after 20 years, you been breaking up for ten.
that's right.
so can I stay with you for a couple days?
Nikki, my wife...
Oh...
I'm just playing with you.
you should see the look on your face right now.
okay, I'm not trying to get rid of you, Nikki, but I really...
you got some nigga ears.
nigga what?
some old-ass nigga ears.
look at this, Levert, Patti LaBelle, Luther Vandross.
you know, white people make music, too.
I got George Michael.
doesn't count.
okay, I'm gonna give you my iPod, and you are gonna give me yours.
okay.
when you get a chance,
I want you to listen to that song.
can I get back to work now?
# Fuck the cracker, that's what I say #
#And fuck these bitches that always want to play #
# I'm the type of nigga that's never gay #
# If you fuck with me, I'll put your head in cake... #
I think he might be off the phone.
Richard.
that girl is here to see you.
well, just send her in.
Richard...
...can I ask you something?
Hi.
it can wait.
I don't think your secretaries like me.
Hey, they don't like me, either.
you know, if you keep showing up like this, we're gonna have to get you a job here.
people are gonna start talking.
Oh, let them talk.
I need you to do me a favor.
can you come uptown with me to look at a place?
you know, l - I got a lot of work to do.
I got to get out of Teddy's, and... he's supposed to be out of town.
I'd like to be out by the time he gets back.
are you okay?
can you come with me?
Yeah, yeah.
let me just check. - Okay.
Tracy, what's my rest of the day look like?
you and George have a conference call at 3: 00.
damn. George!
yeah?
you need me for that call at 3: 00?
I do. Why?
I got to do something.
I mean, l - I should be back, but if I'm not, you can handle it, right?
Yeah, I got it, don't worry.
Hi, I'm George.
Nikki. - Nice to meet you.
likewise.
so, I'll see you later?
you tell me.
richard: You sure this is what you want?
NIKKl: It's what I can afford.
so, where do you work?
I'm a hostess at a place downtown called The White Bar.
Oh, that's nice.
well, here you go.
washer and dryer on the third floor, pay phone on the second floor.
don't knock on my door for change.
get your own damn quarters.
um, there was something in the ad about cable.
I got jumper cables, if you need 'em.
okay.
and don't blame me if the bed's not big enough for both of you.
this place is really for students.
Oh, we are not a couple.
Yeah, yeah, l - I'm just a friend.
Oh.
I guess that's a Super Bowl ring, huh?
you a jet or a packer?
Uh-huh.
which one of you friends is paying the rent?
I am.
sure you are, baby.
I never thought I'd be back in one of these.
this is where everybody ends up.
woman: A wooden barton hutch made of pine in Al's backyard.
this is a project an experienced do-it-yourselfer could tackle, since this shed is pre-cut and ready to assemble.
Hey, fellas. - MAN: Hi!
how are you guys? - Very well, thanks.
that doesn't look so hard: We can do that out back.
I'm getting splinters just watching this.
I got to hand it to you - you knocked it out the park.
it looks like EuroTech may come aboard.
Hey, it's not a done deal, and when it gets done,
I couldn't have done it without you.
what do you say we go grab some lunch and celebrate?
I - I'd love to... but I got other plans.
NIKKl: Hey, guys. You ready?
can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
George: Inside.
be right back. - Okay.
I'm sorry. I won't keep him long.
no problem.
okay, what is it?
are you aware of what you're getting yourself into?
what are you talking about?
Nikki - she's here every day.
George, she's just a friend.
a friend? Come on.
I've had friends before - they don't fucking look like Nikki.
look, you got a good situation at home, you got two kids...
I'm not fucking her.
no, she's fucking you: You just don't know it.
: I can't believe I'm hearing this shit from you, of all people.
you cheat on your wife all the time.
last year, you were fucking Tracy and Mary.
I didn't say shit to you.
that's different.
I don't give a fuck.
I can fuck a girl, go home, kiss my wife good night and sleep like a baby.
you, on the other hand, got emotions.
you're like Captain Save-A-Ho, all right?
you like to be needed, and that bitch knows it.
are we done?
I'm not getting in your shit, all right?
I just...
be careful, okay?
Hey.
what's wrong?
you look upset.
we can't do this anymore.
do what? What are you talking about?
this whole... lunch in the afternoon thing.
it doesn't look good: We really should stop.
we're not doing anything.
it's not like we're fucking.
it is like we're fucking, only thing, we're not fucking,
I don't want things to get any more complicated.
I'm not trying to complicate anything.
I like you, Richard.
I don't like a lot of people.
I like you 'cause you're safe.
you don't want anything from me.
okay?
okay.
so, you want to get something to eat?
no.
I have something else planned.
Wow.
I've been thinking about coming here.
I knew you'd like it.
you should have one of these.
wanted one of these since I was a kid.
that I don't know.
what I know is that I'm gonna get me a little Porsche one day.
you're going down! You're going down!
I'm going down, all right.
you dirty, dirty!

Richard!
Richard, Brian's asleep ups!

you -You don't like it?
no, no, I don't.
and you're making the kids deaf.
Ah, come on, it's not that loud.
Yes, it is.
and you know what?
I was in my car the other day, and...
where did my CDs go?
wh-where's my, where's my Peabo Bryson?
Where's my Usher? Where's my Beyonce?
you know, you really got some nigga ears, honey.
nigga ears?
how many times do I have to ask you not to talk in front of the kids like that?
you know what?
you just keep doing what you're doing.
cause one of these days, they won't be asking where my daddy is, they'll be asking, "Where's my nigga?
then what are you gonna do?
you know, I tried calling you yesterday, and no one could find you.
was probably at lunch.
no, it was almost 4: 00.
aren't you usually back by then?
I mean, I tried calling you on your cell,
I tried texting you, you didn't text me back.
what did you want?
that was yesterday.
you have to tell people where you are.
what if something happened to the kids?
what if I got hit by a car?
Ah, come on, why do you always have to take it to, "What if I got hit by a car?"
I - I went to the deli,
I wanted a chicken salad sandwich.
I - I stood on line.
uh, when I got to the front of the line,
I realized I didn't have a ticket, so I had to get back on the line.
that's it.
you make it sound like an alibi.
all you have to do is answer the phone.
I didn't hear it.
all right.
tomorrow.
have you thought about what you want to do?
do you want to see a movie?
do you want to have brunch with Jennifer and Allan?
Nah, nah, nah, we do that all the time.
let's try something different.
different?
okay.
honey, let's go look at the new Porsches.
Wh... Why?
no. No, no, no, no.
in here, it says that there's something over there that you're really gonna like.
Oh, yeah. Come on.
let's go.
Bye-bye.
come on, baby.
richard: Going to the car show and looking at the minivans was like going to a strip club and looking at the DJ.
executive: Mr. Cooper,
well, Mr. Yuni, what we're finding now is that most advertising dollars are migrating online.
is that you?
it's me.
I probably should, uh... - Mm-hmm.
NIKKl: Richard, I have an emergency.
I need to ask you something, but I'm afraid you're gonna get mad at me.
I have to take this.
um, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be, I'll be right back.
H-Hey, what's up?
I can't really talk right now: I'm in a meeting.
okay, really quick.
just promise you won't get mad at me.
I won't get mad.
you didn't promise.

not today, tomorrow.
fine.
okay? I got to go now.

LANDIS: Oh, and what were your plans?
three kids?
LANDIS: Yeah, could be better.

richard: All right, so where's this guy live?
cause I got things to do.
shuttle's in, like, 45 minutes.
shuttle?
wh-what are you talking about, shuttle?
to D. C.
remember I told you, we have a place there, and he's out of town, so now I can get my shit.
I'm not going with you to D. C.
you promised.
I didn't promise to go with you to another state.
it's not a state, it's a district.
it's, like, a 30-minute flight.
you must be out of your fucking mind if you think I'm getting on a plane to Washington D. C.
to go to some guy's house to get your shit!
George: Richard?
Richard, yeah.
uh, I have one question for you:
where the fuck are you?
no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll be there.
Yeah, something just came up.
look, just get here, okay?
I told you I need you on this one.
tell Mary that if Nikki calls,
I'll call her tomorrow.
tell her yourself when you get here.
you're a good liar.
listen, we're getting on the 1: 00 shuttle, not a moment later, okay?
cause I got a meeting at 3: 00.
okay.
you know what it means, Last week, the assignment was to write an essay about your family.
who they... - Are!
and what they...
mean to us!
excellent droning. So I want everyone to take out their essays.
we're going to read them aloud to the class right up here.
my mom says that me and my dad have very healthy appetites.
my mom and dad are very religious.
when they're in their bedroom at night, I always hear them yelling, "Jesus!
my mom says my dad's eyes are brown because he is so full of sh...
Brian!
my brother Jack is in eighth grade.
he told me to ask my dad who he voted for...
for... for President.
I did and my Dad said he's a total Bush-man.
that made my brother laugh really hard.
whenever my Uncle Stu comes over to play pool with my dad, my mom says the basement smells like a Cheech and Chong movie.
well... it's like this.
my dog ate my paper.
I checked, but he didn't poop it out.
what a lovely sentiment, Mr. Etheridge.
maybe your dog can eat the zero you'll be receiving too.
Aw, man! - Harsh.
miss Trinke? It's your turn now.
my dad says life can be split into two categories:
new Jersey... and New York.
my dad was a Jersey boy who became the youngest and most successful music publicist in New York City,
by the time he was 27, he had 1 00 people working for him,
and even though they all loved him, he loved them even more,
my fellow flacks and spin doctors.
salud, Daddy loved his job, but not as much as he loved my mom,
mommy was a book editor in New York City when her and Daddy met,
daddy said their jobs were kind of the same, they made slight corrections for their clients,
because George Michael is a pimp who is all about the ladies, my friend.
come on, "l Want Your Sex " ? that sound like he's singing to a guy?
daddy worked so much that sometimes Mommy could only see him late at night,
daddy says that's why they both loved the city so much
it never went to sleep,
and neither did him and Mommy,
but after a year of romance in New York City,
daddy said it was time to show Mommy where he came from,
so he took her home to New Jersey and put her through what he said was the biggest test their love would ever face:
introducing her to my pop,
Hey, how are ya? - How're ya doin'?
How're ya doin' yourself? - This is Gertrude.
Hi. Merry Christmas.
and what do you do, Mr. Trinke? - Easy on the "Mr. Trinke." It's Bart.
I work for the borough, for 30 years now.
he's the only man in Highlands licensed to operate the street sweeper.
Oh, man, I always wanted to ride in one of those things.
well, you continue seeing my son, I can probably get you a turn at the wheel.
I was only gonna sleep with him a few more times and then dump him, but now, after an offer like that...
holy shit. Listen to the mouth on this one!
Oh, yeah, they don't make 'em like Mom anymore, do they, Dad?
now, listen, l'm goin' to the bar. - What a shock.
if you guys are gonna do anything while l'm gone, stay the hell off of my bed.
you're going to a bar? - Didn't he tell ya? I'm an alcoholic.
well, I wanna go to the bar too. - No, you don't wanna go to this bar.
it's a bunch of old guys talkin' about how good they had it under Kennedy.
the man was a goddamn saint.
I'm goin' to the bar with your dad. You can come if you want.
no, that's OK. I'll stay here and do the dishes.
I only cooked. Why shouldn't I clean?
suit yourself. But don't wash that pan.
I got a layer of juice built up for the pork roll, and I don't want you scrubbin' it off.
that "juice " is called grease, Dad.
it's bad for you. It clogs your arteries.
it's called juice. And it greases a father's insides so that he can better swallow the shit his son feeds him twice a year when he can be bothered coming to visit him.
so that night, Daddy took Mommy to Pop's bar, where she got to meet Pop's other children, his best friends Greenie and Block,
Hey, your kid's cuttin' a rug.
who are you, Connie Chung?
daddy said, because Mommy survived her first trip to Jersey, he knew she was a keeper,
he said they celebrated their engagement by going out for pizza,
and that's how I got here,
do we have enough of these at home, or should I steal some?
if you're gonna steal something, steal some rubber gloves.
thank you! - You're welcome!
and with that, everyone lived happily ever after,
almost,
look, you've got two minutes, and then we have to go, OK?
or I'm gonna leave. - Would you stop rushing me?
I don't understand how somebody who had all day sitting around to get ready waits till 20 minutes before we have to leave!
you try getting anything accomplished with this big gut in your way!
this is one of the few days of the year that I can be fired for being late!
anytime that you wanna carry this baby, Ollie, you let me know! OK?
I would be glad to go back to wearing regular dresses instead of this tent!
the dress looks fine. It's gorgeous, OK? It's beautiful.
Yeah, until l'm standing next to Janet Jackson or Sheryl Crow.
then you'll see how not fine it looks.
Gertie, I asked you, please, to use your own brush, OK?
can you just not use my brush? - Don't start.
it's just that every time I wanna comb my hair
I spend 1 5 minutes taking these long, bushy hairs out of my brush.
and I mean, you ask me to...
I'm sorry.
baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you don't understand what it's like to be this fat!
I've always been thin, and now l'm a disgusting pig!
and it's my first time going to the Video Music Awards and all the other girls are gonna be skinny, and l'm gonna look like a whale!
baby, baby, they're just skinny 'cause they're all coked-out whores.
I wanna be a coked-out whore!
OK, you can be a coked-out whore too.
you can be a coked-out, coked-out whore.
l'm sorry. - I should be more sensitive. I'm sorry.
I should be more sensitive, honey. I know.
Yes. - I know.
baby, we have to go now, OK? - OK.
I love you. We have to go now. - OK.
I love you too. - All right, let's go. OK?
just give me two minutes.
what time is it? - 20 after.
she's gonna kill me! - I need the quote for the Madonna release.
OK. "Madonna trusts the public will judge for itself that...
this latest in a long line of breakthrough music videos is not the tasteless sexploitation it's accused of being.
lt's artistic expression. " - Of what?
of one woman's constant need to show the world... her labia.
see you next week.
one of these days, l'll get me one of those husbands that show up for Lamaze.
I'm sorry, babe. It was Madonna.
so you were late because of another woman. That's nice.
come on. I still gotta do my job. - And I still gotta do mine too.
but I was at Lamaze on time.
look, all l'm saying is that guy who used to spend all night at the office and barely live in his apartment?
that's not you anymore.
now you have to be the guy who's done by six and comes home and hangs out with his family.
that's the only way we're gonna work.
OK?
OK.
OK. - OK.
OK!
OK. - OK.
can I help you? - Yes.
my wife's water broke. She's gonna have a baby.
you're gonna have to check in, hon. - Check in?!
where, at the concierge desk?! Why are you being so combative with me?!
first of all, take your hands off my uniform.
and second, l'm gonna need a patient here.
this is my wife. This is the belligerent nurse that's being so difficult with me, giving me such a hard time.
l'm sorry. He's a little panicky. - Can I get a wheelchair?
let's get you up to delivery... - OK.
...and let him fill out the paperwork. - OK.
if we can trust him with a pen. - Here, sweetie.
OK, just relax, breathe. Remember, take it easy.
I love you. I'll be right there, OK? I love you.
I love you too. - OK, I love you.
we've practiced this 1, 000 times. It'll be great. How hard can it be?
push! You're doing good. - You're doing real good.
no, I can't! I can't do it! - Take a breath.
it hurts! - I know it hurts.
it's OK, baby. Push. You can do it.
take a deep breath. In five, four...
OK? Here you go. -...three, two, one.
push. Push harder, Gertie. Push harder.
the baby's crowning. I can see her. I just need one more push.
can you see her? - Holy shit! I can see the head!
one more. Breathe. - Push! It's almost there, baby.
push! You're doing it. Push!
push!
here she comes! Here she comes!
here she is.
do you wanna cut the cord, Dad? - Yeah.
scissors, please.
Yes! And she's got all ten fingers, ten toes.
we'll get her all cleaned up and then we're gonna check...
Gertie?
baby, look. - Gertie?
Gertie!
Gertie, can you hear me?
she's OK. Sweetheart? - Nurse, get Dr. Mortimer right away!
she's resting. Who's Dr. Mortimer?
Dr. Mortimer!
what's happening? - She's unresponsive.
Gertie! - Gertie! Gertie!
Gertie, it's me! Gertie?
healthy baby. Unresponsive.
respiratory arrest. - Turn it around!
what's happening to my wife? - Let's open that lV, please.
baby, are you OK? Sweetheart, sweetheart, wake up!
please, someone take Mr. Trinke outside. Please!
I'm gonna have to intubate.
Gertie, wake up, my love. Wake up.
Gertie, please. Wake up.
get off me! Gertie!
I wanna stay with my wife! Gertie! Gertie!
what's happening?!
Ollie... - If I don't get to go in there right now...
I swear to God! - Ollie... Ollie, calm down.
fuck you, calm down! OK?!
I got dragged out of there, I haven't got to see my baby!
your baby is fine. She's healthy, she's normal.
what's wrong with Gertie? - I need you to calm down before l...
look, l'm calm! OK?!
I'm calm.
we think Gertie had an aneurysm.
is she OK?
we lost her, Ollie.
the strain of the contractions and the pushing caused the aneurysm to rupture.
there are rarely symptoms for aneurysms...
# I drew a picture of you # You and your anchor tattoo # And saw the face that I knew # Covered in shame # You drew the bird that was here # The kind of sweet chanticleer # But with a terrible fear # That the cage couldn't tame # That's how I knew the story would break my heart # When you're older # That's how I knew the story would break my heart You sure you're OK with this, Dad?
what, OK? She's my granddaughter.
Yeah, you can stay with me anytime, can't you?
Yes, you can.
until you're a teenager, with the boys and a reefer.
then I don't wanna know about you.
I wouldn't impose on you, you know.
I just got a lot of work... piled up from before and...
l'll be back late tonight, OK? - Yeah, take your time.
your daddy really misses your mommy, kid. I miss her too.
especially right now.
- Oh, Jesus!
Yeah.
you wanted to see me, Ollie? - Yeah, come on in.
I didn't think you were gonna be in this week. How you doin'?
you all right? - I'm fine.
look, this piece in the Post, Why didn't you call me when this broke?
I had to read about it in New Jersey. - It's cool. The nurse is a fan.
will she still be a fan when the Enquirer flashes a stack of 50s in her face?
listen, something like this breaks, l'm not in the city, you find me or you find another job.
Yeah, OK.
what else do we got?
um, Will Smith.

DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince " Fresh Prince?
Yeah. - What about him?

vaguely.

date pending, yeah. - Anybody give a shit?
every outlet wants in. - You're kidding me?
no. Even US News and World Report,
Why? It's an eight-year-old album.
doesn't matter. Everyone loves that Fresh Prince TV show.
he's got that movie coming out in a couple of weeks, Independence Day, - Let the film division handle it. - No, we can't.
will wants to keep his music career separate from his movie career.
like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air is ever gonna have a movie career.

OK.
Patty, get me Kirsch. - Sure, Ollie,
I can handle this Fresh Prince stuff if you wanna take a couple of days...
Hey, Arthur, I can do my job. I'm all set, OK? You do your job. Go ahead.
Patty, did you not hear me? I asked you to please get Kirsch on the phone.

I'm fine. OK, Arthur? I am fine!
please go do what I asked you to do now.
kirschner on one, - OK! Put him on the phone then!
how's the baby? - The baby is fine, Arthur!

Patty, was that,
I'm working on that right now, Don't worry,
just get there early and deal with the menu. OK?
Hey! Are you deaf? The kid is cryin' up there.
can you deal with that? I'm doing something important. OK? Thanks.
what the hell could be more important than your kid crying?
I have a memorabilia donation ceremony in the morning that my company is treating like a royal wedding 'cause apparently the client's the most beloved American musician since Elvis.
the kid's been screaming for the last ten minutes.
if it bothers you so much, go up there and give her a bottle. OK?
sorry. It's a nightmare trying to work at this house.
Jesus! Let me call you back, OK?
what, Dad? - Listen, kid.
I lost a wife too, remember? So I get how you're feelin'. But come on.
you were married for what, 20 years? I got about 20 minutes.
so you don't "get " how l'm feeling at all, OK?
I'm sorry, Oliver, but that don't change the fact that you're a goddamn father now and you haven't acted like it since that kid got home from the hospital!
I been calling in sick for a month to do the things you're supposed to be doin'!
Jesus Christ, if Gertie could see the shit you've been pulling...
Gertie doesn't see anything anymore, Dad. She's dead.
Yeah, she's dead.
but you ain't. And neither is that kid.
Yeah. It's nothin'.
uh...
all right, so l'm gonna do the kit. It's almost finished.
you can deal with the menu. What time's Will getting there?
dad, the baby's up!
dad! The baby needs to be fed!
dad!
what the hell...?!
are you nuts? What, are you trying to get killed?!
what are you doing? - Searching for Christ. What's it look like?
it would have been nice if you'd told me you were leaving the house!
that way, I could've given you the baby instead of driving all the way down here!
now l'm gonna hit traffic! - No, you ain't giving me the baby.
Hey! Excuse me?
I got uptown and downtown to do this morning.
you're on your own with the kid today. - What?! No!
I have this press conference I have to do this morning, Dad! You know that!
I got a job to do too. - If I don't leave right now...
so leave! - And do what with the baby?!
take her with you! - Goddamn it! I...
look, I know I haven't been helping out that much with the baby...
listen to you, "Helping out that much with the baby.
she's your daughter, for Christ's sakes!
what am I supposed to do with her?! - Try acting like her father, shithead!
goddamn it!
folks, l'm sorry.
sorry. Steve. - What the...?!
I ordered diapers. Did they get here yet? - You mean baby diapers?
why didn't you start half an hour ago? You shouldn't have waited for me!
we're waiting for Will. - Will's not here?!
no. - Are either of you guys Trinket?
close enough. Where is he? - We're not sure.
Damn! That baby smells like shit. You know that, right?
lt's a good thing you finally showed up, man.
they're gettin' all rowdy out there. - Oh, Mother of God!
what? Jesus... - Ollie!
Ollie, the guy from Rolling Stone, Holy shit! What is that smell?
grow up, Susan! It's a dirty diaper. What did the Rolling Stone guy say?
if we don't start in five minutes, they're leaving to go cover the Blues Traveler signing at Tower.
Jesus Christ! - Hey, you're doing that wrong.
what? - You're doing that wrong.
you're supposed to wipe front to back. You're wiping back to front.
you do that, you're just wiping the poop into her...
.crevice.
get outta here! Beat it!
mark my words, you're gonna give her the crotch-rot.
would one of you do... You do this. - Oh, not me. No.
will you do this so I can go out there and calm them down?
why, because l'm a girl? I've never even seen a naked baby. No!
fine. Thank you very much. I'm gonna remember this.
how much of this am I supposed to use? - Should I get that guy back?
if it's for the smell, I suggest you use a lot.
Ooh! You gotta turn... turn it. You gotta turn the top!
Oh! Direct it at the baby.
thank you! Go out there, please, and tell them we're about to start!
I'd say more.
that's a lot.
all right, the Fresh Prince is almost here.
is that blow on your shirt?
what do you think, Stretch? This is show business, right?
that was a joke, people. - Where's the Fresh Prince?
the Fresh Prince is on his way.
lt's crying. Will you take it? - No! No.
is that Jazzy Jeff?
this is bullshit! Where's the Fresh Prince?
will someone please shut that girl up?
enough with the Romper Room, man! Bring out the Fresh Prince!
fresh Prince! Fresh Prince!
please take her.
I, uh...
goddamn it! Christ! Give her to me! Give me the baby.
would you people just shut the hell up with the "Fresh Prince " already?!
he's a two-bit TV actor...
who won't be around any longer than it takes for the ink to dry on the pages of the worthless rags you jerk-offs write for!
shit.
that guy's toast. - That's a hell of a quote.
# Well, I looked over Jordan - - # And what did I see?
it's all right, Arthur.
# Comin' for to carry me home # A band of angels # Coming after me # Coming for to carry me home # Swing low, sweet chariot # Coming for to carry me home # Swing low, sweet chariot # Coming for to carry me home # Coming for to carry me home
we won't be here too long, Dad.
we'll be out of your hair as soon as I get another job.
I have some feelers out to the other firms right now.
as soon as this whole thing blows over...
it's OK to stay here as long as you need to, till you get back on your feet.
I appreciate that. - On one condition.
here we go. - You put the kid to bed every night.
that's it? - For starters.
and no whores. I don't want no whores in my house.
I'm not really a whoremonger, Dad.
here, the kid gets this.
that's cute. 8: 00, you both get a bottle.
just shut the hell up and go be a father, would ya, please?
Yeah, this is only temporary, us... you know...
Iiving with your grandfather here.
so...
how about that Fresh Prince thing, huh?
it was quite a show.
your dad's one big horse's ass.
daddy's ex-bosses said the guys who did PR for Hitler have a better chance of working in this business again than Daddy does.
so, OK...
How're you doin'?
yeah... You know, you kinda look like your mom.
like a squishier, balder version of your mom.
man...
I just wish you could've gotten to meet your mom.
I know she wanted to meet you... in a big, bad way.
in a big, bad way.
sometimes, Daddy wishes he'd have died instead of Mommy.
because Mommy never would've...
Iet work get in the way of... getting to know you,
Iike Daddy has for the last... month or so.
it's just that Daddy... he didn't expect Mommy...
to leave the way she did.
it's just really hard on Daddy, who's been trying to fill up his days with work, so he wouldn't have to think about Mommy never being around again.
I just loved your mom so much.
you know?
she really lit my world on fire.
when that happens...
you kinda think it'll go on like that until one of you dies. You know?
you just don't expect...
I miss her so much. So, so much.
and you're a little piece of Mommy. And that makes you really special to Daddy.
just don't go anywhere.
cause you're the next best thing to Mommy, and I love you so much.
and l'll always be here for you.
and l'm sorry about the way l've been acting.
I promise you... I'll be better now.
I'm gonna be the best daddy in the world.
cause that's what Mommy wanted. And that's what you deserve.
and that's all I am now.
I'm just your dad.
your dad likes to run off at the mouth sometimes, I know.
your mother wasn't a fan, either.
you wanna see a picture of your mom? I have one.
this was your mommy. She was really pretty.
OK. You can keep it.
daddy's got a bunch.
there you go.
Goodnight, Gertie.
# Worlds, # They rise and fall Gertie!
# Within her eyes
your chariot awaits, Princess.
let's go!
we gotta go! Argh!
# To fly in the sky - How was school, good? - Mm-hm.
you have a nice time? - Yep.
remember to put your seat belt on? Know where to find it?
Yep.
lock and load. Comin' around. Get ready.
ready? - Punch it, Chewy!
can we go see Cats? - Absolutely not.
Why?
cats was the second-worst thing that ever happened to New York City.
besides, Cats closed three years ago. - We never do anything cool.
you're ridin' in the Batmobile, aren't ya? How cool is that?
Oh, my God.
look, no one's more depressed than me that driving the street sweeper is considered the height of excitement in my life.
I used to live in New York City.
I could've gone to see Cats three times a day.
lt's not like I ever ask for anything. - Oh-ho-ho!
and the Oscar goes to Gertie Trinke, for her performance in Laying It On Thick For My Old Man,
what is it with you and Cats all of a sudden?
I wanna sing a Cats song in the big show, like everybody else.
what big show? - There's gonna be this big show at school.
all the people have to sing a song with people from their family.
are you inviting me to this big show? - Duh! Yeah, you and Pop too.
Oh-ho! I'm sure that'll go over huge with your pop.
can Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block be in it too?
those men are not your uncles. They're barely even your peers.
Pee-ers?
when is this big show? - Right before Thanksgiving break.
does it have to be something from the Bible?
I don't think so. Is Cats in the Bible?
the Satanic Bible, yes.
what? - When you taking her to see the cats?
Jesus, you too?
Gertie!
do you even know what Cats is, Dad?
what, I don't read the papers? - You don't read that paper.
what are you doing with a New York Times?
they ran out of the Ledger,
they don't have the Jumble in the Times, Dad.
shit.
where were you? - I was in the bathroom.
why didn't I hear the toilet flush? - Oh. I forgot.
OK, march your butt back upstairs and flush that toilet.
and when I say no about something,
Iike, I don't know, Cats, maybe, I mean no.
OK?
pop, you were supposed to be subtle! - Why do you teach her words like that?
you're gonna have to mow the park for me tomorrow. I can't do it.
why the hell not? - I have an appointment in the city at 1 1: 00.
Jesus, kid, why do you keep doin' it to yourself?
how many of these interviews you gotta go on before you get it through your thick head they don't want you in that business anymore?
for Christ's sakes, you made fun of that Prince Charles guy.
- Thank you.
first of all, Dad, I didn't "make fun " of anybody.
I made one remark about Will Smith, the Fresh Prince.
sooner or later, everyone's gonna forget about that and l'm gonna go back to doing what l'm really good at, instead of sweeping streets and plowing snow and picking up garbage.
OK?
if you're going into the city anyway, at least take the kid to see the cats.
Oh, God...
I'll tell you what, since there is no more Cats,
Gertie, why don't you come over here and pick out another play that you wanna see?
look through here. Anything you want. Go nuts.
cats is a show? - Yeah, you read the papers.
you think you're slick, don't ya, young lady?
next time you're lookin' for a partner in crime, you're gonna have to aim higher than your grandfather.
he's soft in the head. - I heard that!
here. Can we go see this show?
Sweeney Todd? Do you know that this has a lot of singing?
lt's still a play. - OK. I'm just checking.
your dad one time lost a bet with someone at his work, and he had to go see a singing play, done by people on roller skates.
cool! - Your dad didn't think so.
I handled primarily recording artists but when I initially trained, I trained in film PR, so I can do that too.
I, uh... took the last six or seven years off. I was raising my daughter in New Jersey.
but I kept abreast, so... I'm pretty comfortable jumping back in.
what else can I tell you guys? Uh...
that's it. I can start, you know, right away.
you guys all right?
are you the Ollie Trinke? The one who used to work at Mandel/Kirschner?
Yeah.
son of a bitch! - Yes! I told you, Reynolds! Pay up!
I got it. - Am I missin' somethin'?
Nah, nah, he just bet me you were the Ollie Trinke, the one who pulled "The Fresh Prince " .
they named it? - Of course!
are you kidding? You're a legend, man!
you did what every flack only dreams about doing!
which was what? - You went apeshit!
you trashed your client back to the Stone Age.
Yeah. - We bow to you, man.
you're like a god around here. - Yep, exactly.
God enough to get a job? - No.
what, are you insane? - No chance, Trinke!
pop, l'm home! - Yeah, like I give a shit.
you know, thanks a lot, Pop!
that's what it looks like? - I guess.
what does yours look like? - Not like that.
yeah? Let me see.
all right.
Gertie! It's time for Bryan to go home.
OK...
what are your intentions? - Huh?
what are your intentions with my daughter?
do you plan on marrying her? - I don't know.
well, only married boys and girls, ahem...
show each other their, uh...
their, you know, uh...
.parts.
OK?
OK, Bryan, you can go now. If you come back, come back with a ring.
Yes, Mr. Trinke.
Bye, Gertie. - Bye.
goodbye, Bryan.
OK.
do you have any, uh...
questions about what you...
you know...
you know, whatever, saw?
do you have what Bryan has?
Yes, I have one... too.
is yours as big as his?
sadly, yes.
can we rent a movie? - Yes.
so they wouldn't give you a job, huh? - No. But apparently, Daddy's a legend.
you don't need that job anyway. You already got a job.
Yes, well, Daddy used to have a job where a nightly shower was an option, not a necessity.
you know what job you should do? - What's that?
you should be a dance teacher, like Johnny in Dirty Dancing,
I should? Should I say, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner " ?
Oh, can we rent Dirty Dancing again?
Ohh... Dirty Dancing ranks one notch below Cats in my book.
can you pick out something else?
can we rent this?
absolutely not. Go pick out something from the children's section.
all those movies suck. - Watch your language.
Nah, that's...
no, I guess that's it. Yep, yep, that's it.
I'll just take this and whatever the kid's getting.
just go ahead and put it in the bag. I'm all set.
it's good.
Bi-Bi Guys, featuring Curious Jordie"?
interesting choice. Does the wife know you're looking into your options?
it's... I got the...
I got the wrong box by accident. - Oh, right.
would you mind, uh... exchanging that for me for something...
anything you can get your hands on that's, you know...
so, then you want something... -...that's non-bi.
can I have your membership card, please?
Yeah, sure.
do you mind if I asked you a few questions about your renting practices?
uh... sure.
Really? Uh...
do you always rent adult titles with your daughter in tow, or is this the first time?
excuse me?
when you rent porn, do you usually do it with family around, or is this like a, you know, special occasion?
do I have to answer this? - l'm a grad student, writing a thesis paper.
a Bird in the Hand: The Family Man and the Pornographic Fixation " .
OK. I would rather not take part.
Really?
Frank, is Bi-Bi Guys a one or a two-night rental?
what are you getting, Daddy? - Yeah, Daddy. Let's just take a look...
let's not, OK?
would you mind not asking me those questions when my daughter's with me?
how about when you bring these back?
that's... Yeah.
in an effort to get honest feedback, leave the kid and the wife at home.
my mom's dead. She died when I was born.
Oh, Jesus.
man, l'm sorry. I didn't...
no, you didn't.
let's go.
I'm sorry.
do I have to?
major Damage didn't have to go to bed when he fought the Tiki Terrors!
Melvin! - And do they, - - I'll get it.
you will not. You're not even supposed to be up this late.
watch your video.
but, Mom! - Say, "OK, Mom,
Ahh! - Say, "OK, Mom,
Hi.
Hey! You're the lady from the video store.
let's not use that term too loosely, OK? Go back and watch your video.
yes?
I just wanted to come here and tell you that l'm really sorry about earlier tonight.
I feel like shit about what I said and your daughter and everything.
well... you should.
you know that kid was crying in the car the whole way home?
Oh, no... - No, I wasn't.
get back inside and watch your video! - Nice! Real nice.
see, now you have to let me interview you for my paper.
is that why you're here?
I just think you'd make one hell of an interesting case study.
the sympathetic widower who doesn't have time to date 'cause he's raising a kid, so he rents porn instead. I mean, I think that's very interesting stuff.
Jesus Christ! You've got some nerve, lady.
and besides, l'd really like to make it up to you.
for what I said, and for embarrassing you before that.
you're really having a banner evening. You're batting a thousand tonight.
you're Ollie, right? I'm Maya Harding.
Hi, Maya. Nice to meet you.
Hi.
come on, why don't you let me take you out one day this week?
you do eat lunch when you're not knee-deep in adult movies, right?
I appreciate it, but, uh... no thanks.
Ollie, come on, you're ruining my karma level here.
what, buying me one lunch is gonna square you with Krishna?
hare Hare!
is Monday OK? Sound good?
I mean, I was thinking nothing fancy. I was thinking maybe, like, the diner.
around noon? - No!
noon it is!
Oh...
see you there. Bye!
an incredibly strange woman.
I did not hear the toilet flush.
thank you.
can we get popcorn? - This isn't the movies, sweetheart.
they don't sell popcorn here. This is Broadway. This is class.
# And if you're beautiful # What then?
# With yellow hair like wheat # I think we shall not meet again, my little dove # My sweet Johanna # Goodbye, Johanna # You're gone and yet you're mine # I'm fine, Johanna # I'm fine OK. You see that floor. Now look three windows in from the right.
see that window? That's where we used to live before we lived with Pop.
we'd still live there if we lived in the city.
if Mommy was still alive? - Yep.
dad... - Yes?
do you miss Mommy?
I do. Every day.
what was she like? - l've told you a million times.
I know, but I forget. - No, I don't think you forget.
I think you just like to hear me tell you. Which is OK. It's all right.
you can ask about your mommy as much as you want.
so tell me already.
well, she was pushy, like you were right there.
she was beautiful, like you are right now.
and she was... smart...
and strong, like you'll grow up to be one day.
I'm smart now.
I know. I wasn't impugning your intelligence or anything.
what's "impugning " mean?
Oh, not so smart now, are you?
that's a big word. - Yes, you're right, it is.
let's see. To impugn means to criticize.
so... Pop's always impugning you, right?
well, he thinks he is.
but he's just talking to make sure he's still alive.
pop is a very, very old man.
what do you think? You like the city?
it's OK. But I like Highlands better.
you do? - Yeah.
my school's there, and my friends... And we can rent movies there.
well, if memory serves, you can rent movies here too.
Yeah, but not from that pretty lady at the video store.
Oh, you think she's pretty, do you? - Don't you?
isn't that why you're taking her on a date?
it's not a date. The only girl I take on dates is you, OK?
this is a date. We're on a date.
we are? - Mm-hm.
it doesn't feel like a date. - It doesn't?
well, I can fix that.
sir!
so, uh, question one: How often do you rent adult movies?
do I really have to do this? - You have nothing to be ashamed about.
interest in adult film can be healthy, as long as it's not habitual.
so come on, how often? - Three or four times a week.
OK, maybe I was wrong. You should be ashamed.
you have a real talent for making the subject feel open and comfortable in a safe environment.
so you're renting it presumably to masturbate to, right?
good God! - Come on, don't be such a tight-ass.
we're all adults here.
I know l'm an adult. How old are you, exactly?
l'll be 26 in March. - 26?
you still haven't learned some things aren't polite to talk about in public?
if it makes you feel any better, I do it, like, twice a day.
good God! - What can I tell ya? I get bored easily.
you're gonna get carpal tunnel syndrome.
don't get all judgmental with me. You're no slouch yourself.
well, no, l... - I just have a healthy sexual appetite.
why don't you go out and get yourself a boyfriend?
why don't you just go out and get yourself a girlfriend?
I work all day, I hang out with my kid all night.
so you'd rather hang out with your kid than get laid?
Yeah. - Aw... that's kinda sweet.
I'm kinda crushin' on you right now, Trinke.
OK. Can I go home now?
no. When was the last time you had sex?
I would rather not disclose that information.
Oh, come on, don't clam up on me now.
you're gonna remain anonymous in my paper.
ha! Anonymity doesn't concern me. Embarrassment does.
why would you be embarrassed? - Because it's been a long time.
how long? - A long time.
come on. Just put it out there.
I swear I won't make any editorial cracks about it.
not in front of you, at least.
seven years. - Seven years?
since my wife died, yeah.
you know, a dumbfounded, mouth-agape look of shock might be construed by some as an editorial crack too.
l'm sorry. - lt's OK. It's fine.
no, it's not. I mean, it's not at all.
with all due respect to your wife, you've gotta get back on the horse, man.
no, I don't, actually. - Yes, you do.
no, I don't. - Yes, you... Get up.
are we done? - With this, for now. But come with me.
lord have mercy.
where are we going? - To your place.
we're gonna have some sex.
what, did you forget something? - No. Look, I appreciate the offer.
I'm very flattered. But I can't do this.
what's the matter? Don't you think l'm cute?
of course I think you're cute. - Well, then?
look, l'm not just celibate because of my daughter.
there are a lot of emotional issues in it too.
I mean, my wife may be dead. I'm still very much in love with her.
Hey, I respect that. I'm not telling you to fall in love with me here, and l'm not trying to replace your wife.
I'm just talking about two consenting adults having some casual sex.
probably some really short casual sex, with you being a little out of practice.
I can't do it, l'm sorry. - What are you, a monk?
God! Let's look at this logically, OK?
you rent porn and touch yourself, right? - Would you lower your voice?
if you're not sweating how your wife would feel about you and porn, then you shouldn't sweat what l'm proposing 'cause it's the same thing.
only somebody else is doing the touching and you're saving a $2 rental fee.
come on, stud. Man cannot live on porn alone.
Oh, God...
I'm home!
Pop?!
Oh, my God... What do I do? - Get in the bathroom!
pop? - Uh, no, honey, it's me.
daddy? Why aren't you at work?
uh, because I had to come home and do... I had to...
come home and take a shower.
can we rent a movie? - Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
as soon as I get done up here and dry off, l'll come down.
OK.
Oh, my God. That was so close.
what do we do now? I'm wet.
sorry, Dad, I forgot again.
Shh!
Hi, honey.
you remember Maya. From the video store.
what are your intentions? - Excuse me?
what are your intentions with my father?
like, do you plan on marrying him?
uh... I don't...
because I was taught that only married girls show their girl parts to boys.
right, Daddy? - Uh... right. Yes.
Mm-hm.
can we rent all the movies we want for free?
what?
can we rent all the movies we want for free?
Yes! Yes, yes. For God's sake, yes.
if it means we're not, you know, that we're not in trouble anymore.
and... Right, Maya? Yes!
uh... whatever you want. It's on the house.
even Dirty Dancing?
Yeah.
and we can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school?
what?
we can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school?
no, honey, that's too grown-up. - Really?
Oh man, what am I gonna tell Pop about you guys?
fine. We can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school.
OK!
would you shut the hell up already? Christ, Greenie, you're always...
Oh, Jesus. - Oh!
christ Almighty. You wearin' a... wearin' a towel?
just as long as you didn't do it on my bed.
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was one time in high school! You wanna let it go already?
I banged a broad in my parents' bed once. It was nice.
terrific. Just so you know, we didn't "bang " .
what, did ya get to third base? - No!
not that it's any of your business, but we didn't do anything.
we lost our heads for a second, then cooler heads prevailed and we stopped before we did anything we'd both regret.
the kid busted in on 'em. - Oh.
let's talk about something else for a second, like this water main.
how bad is it? - Definitely needs to be replaced.
Jesus Christ. If we gotta shut down Bay Avenue for that, this town is gonna throw a shit fit.
I'm sure.
Hey, kid, you haven't had to inconvenience the taxpayers on the job yet.
they get like animals. Remember back in '88?
south Peak Street.
holy shit, I thought they were gonna crucify us upside down.
like St Peter. - Who are you, the Holy Father?
everybody knows I meant St Peter. You don't have to explain my shit.
I'm just saying...
when I was down there, how many cars did you wave around?
three or four.
three or four cars for the whole half hour I was down there?
well, it was rush hour.
Yeah, I don't think the legion of commuters in the Highlands of New Jersey are gonna object to us closing down a small portion of Bay Avenue for a few days.
one at a time, please! One at a time!
we're doing the best we can. - You were saying?
why doesn't somebody just go up there and explain to them what's happening?
why don't you do it, Daddy? Wasn't that your old job?
making people like singers by saying nice things about 'em?
Yes, baby, but... - No, the kid's got a point there.
as a guy who used to sling bullshit for a living,
I nominate you to go up there and say something.
Oh, you do, huh? - Yeah.
it can't hurt. - Go ahead.
Thanks, Pop.
control yourselves!
he's goin' up there.
folks, one second. Please. Folks.
my name's Oliver Trinke and l'm with the borough.
so I guess that makes me the least popular guy in the room.
I want to assure you that, uh...
this Bay Avenue job will be a very minimal inconvenience.
it'll only take three days at the most.
bullshit! Bullshit!
folks, a little decorum! A little decorum!
folks, one second.
I just have one more thing that I just want to add.
I live in this town. I see you guys headin' to work every day.
l'm telling you, it was amazing!
and I get up there and I weave this web of bullshit so profoundly mesmerizing, - I turn the entire place around! - You silver-tongued devil, you.
everything I was saying was just right on the money, you know?
maybe that's 'cause you weren't actually slinging as much bullshit as you thought.
get out there and play in the dirt " ? I mean, what... I made that up!
sounds pretty good to me. Hey, Gert.
the sad thing is, I had a greater sense of accomplishment from the water-main thing than anything else l've done in the past seven years.
I get it. I mean, you set out to do something and you did it.
so you feel drunk with power now. Makes sense.
that's just it. I was the youngest flack ever put in charge of its entire division...
...in the history of Mandel/Kirschner.
I know. - That's an accomplishment.
convincing a town to approve something that's already in their best interest?
that's just delayed common sense. - Yeah, but that's your life now.
I mean, being the youngest flack in the history of blah, blah, blah...
that's not you anymore. I mean, that might never have been you.
Oh, it was me. It was me with my own apartment, me richer, me with more self-respect.
like it or not, this is you.
I mean, forget about what you thought you were and just accept who you are.
I guess l'll just get this. - Gert, what are you doing?
I distinctly remember your father telling you you could get Dirty Dancing, - Oh, yeah! He did! - Yeah.
thanks for that, by the way.
incidentally, she's been asking me when she's gonna grow boobies like yours.
Oh, my God! - She's seven, OK?
if you want, I can give her the old "boobie" talk my mom gave me when I was a kid.
does that talk include using the word "knockers " ?
I'm glad there's no, you know, awkwardness between us.
after the... well, the thing that happened last week with...
Ollie, I was gonna give you a mercy jump.
the moment passed. It's no big deal.
just friends, right? - Yeah, friends.
mercy jump." Stay away from my kid.
no, that's too round. - Shut up.
shut up! Shut up! - Just make it...
would you shut the hell up?! - All right!
there's people gettin' their throats cut in this thing.
Yep.
and your father said you could do this for the show?
Yep.
why the hell would he OK you singing this shit?
because I saw him and Maya naked in the shower.
Oh, yeah.
Heh-heh! That'll do it.
can I speak with an Arthur Brickman, please?
Ollie. - Arthur.
Hey, man. - How're you doin'?
good. How are you? - Good. Good to see you.
you know, the town voted unanimously, approved the water main, so...
you were always great with a crowd.
well, except that... that once, of course.
but that's it. It was the polar opposite of the Fresh Prince incident.
it was like I was on the top of my game. Which is why I wanted to see ya.
uh, I wanna ask you a favor. - Anything, man. What?
is there any way that you could get me an interview with your firm?
you're serious?
I thought it was weird that you wanted to eat here.
Oh, I know it's gonna be tough... - Tough?
Ollie, you called a roomful of press a bunch of jerk-offs, and trashed a client who's one of the biggest movie stars on the planet.
he wasn't big then. - No, but he is now.
you wanna know how big? When I left Mandel/Kirschner, there were some firms that wouldn't even look at my resume because l...
no offense, but because I worked under you.
I've only been at Angellotti a year now...
you know what, man? Forget I asked. Don't worry about it. Seriously.
it was stupid. I got carried away... - No, let me finish.
what I was gonna say was...
I've been waiting years to be in a position to be able to help you out, and now I am.
it's not gonna be an easy sell, but...
I think I can get you in a room with Angellotti himself.
thank you so much. - Of course.
you know, you're a lot more affectionate than I remember.
Ah, it's just... I miss it so much, you know?
it's the only thing I was ever any good at.
Oh, this is great. I can move back here...
I can put Gertie in a really good, expensive private school...
I can get her a nanny, you know?
it'll be like that whole Fresh Prince thing never even happened.
I'll work on the old man when I get back to the office and call you tonight if it's a go.
Oh, great.
- # Excuse me - # Psst - # Dear, see to the customers - # Psst - # Guess what's the...
# Quick now! - # My heart's a-flutter - - # When I pound the floor # lt's a signal to show that l'm ready to go # When I pound the floor... I have to get the phone.
come on, Pop! Do Dad's part.
me? - Yeah.
Yeah, go do that.
Hello? Hey, Arthur.
you're kidding?
# l'll pound three times Three times...
why do I have to sing your dad's part? I'm supposed to be the guy who gets clipped.
you are, but you're Dad's understudy too. - What the hell is that?
it means if Daddy breaks a leg, then you do his part for him.
so, come on, try it again. - You're doin' good.
# l'll pound three times...
# Three times!
wait, wait, wait! I'm supposed to be the understudy now.
I cannot work like this. I'm sorry.
this is no way to run a show. - You were good.
you can go back to waiting in the wings, Tommy Tune.
I'll be doin' my own singing henceforth.
who's Tommy Tune? - Tommy Tune is a man that you can get a chance to see live and on Broadway when we move back to New York City!
what? - What?
what? - What?
Yeah, what?
I was just on the phone with an old friend that I worked with at Mandel/Kirschner.
I had lunch with him and I asked him if he'd get me an interview with his new firm.
Jesus, another interview, Ollie? Come on, when are you gonna learn?
well, smart guy, he just called me, said he sat down with his boss, sold me to his boss like I was the cure for cancer.
it just so happens that a little spot has opened up in their music department.
boom! After six years of being a pariah,
I'm gonna get back in!
I'm talkin' about no more street sweeper, no more picking up garbage, and no more water main!
I'm talking press lines, l'm talking about parties!
I'm talking about a Westside address,
I'm talkin' about a good school for Gertie!
but I already go to a good school.
Yes, honey, but you're gonna go to a way, way better school in New York City.
you're gonna be able to take the subway to school. Won't that be fun?
but the subway's full of junkies and mole-men.
well, they are. - Don't listen to Pop.
what do I tell you? He makes things up!
you'll see. The subways are great. - I don't wanna see.
I don't wanna go to a school up in the city. I wanna go to my school.
honey, it's gonna be too far of a drive for me to come back down here to take you to school in New Jersey every morning.
so let's not move to the city. Let's stay here with Pop.
sweetheart, l'm too old to be living with my father.
I need to get my own place.
and Pop... I mean, look at him, he's a mad-dog.
he doesn't want us around here getting in his way, crampin' his style...
do you, Pop? - That's all horseshit.
you know... thanks, Pop.
I don't wanna move to the city. I like it here.
pop says you can live here as long as you want.
baby, remember when I took you to see Sweeney Todd?
how much fun was that? We had a good time, right?
I mean, if we move to New York City, we can do that every night!
except for the nights you're working, of course.
you know what? Why don't you shut up for a second, OK?
I'm trying to talk to my daughter.
you love New York City. You told me you loved the city.
no, I didn't. - Oh!
I said it was OK. - Jesus Christ!
I said I like Highlands better. Why would you want some other job anyway, Dad?
you get to ride the Batmobile!
baby, Daddy doesn't wanna drive the Batmobile!
daddy wants to eat sushi! Daddy wants to hail cabs!
daddy wants to have a doorman!
daddy wants to lord it over magazine editors!
daddy loved his old job, and he's missed it every day since he's been gone.
daddy wants to do that job. Daddy doesn't wanna pick up garbage forever!
but you told everybody at the meeting that your job's good because you don't have to wear a suit.
Yes, but Daddy was just saying that to get them to say yes to a water main.
so you were just lying to everybody?
look, OK, l'll tell you what. I'll go to the meeting, all right?
if I don't like what the man says, then I won't take the job.
now you're lying to me!
all right, look, young lady! I'm gonna go to this job interview on Monday, whether you like it or not.
wait, this Monday?
Yes. - Ollie, you can't go on Monday.
Why? - Because that's the day of my show!
Oh, shit. It is, isn't it?
well, it's at four, so I can, you know, make it back in time.
but my show's at five!
on what planet are you gonna get back here by five if you've got a meeting in the city at four?
just lay off me for a second! I forgot about the show.
how could you forget? What, are you stupid?
Gertie, this job is very important to Daddy.
what about my show? Isn't that important to you?
Yes, honey, that's even more important to me.
then don't go to your stupid meeting about your stupid new job in the stupid city!
that's enough, young lady! - I don't even want you in the show!
you're not even a good Sweeney Todd anyway.
pop's way better. Even Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block are better than you.
those men are not your uncles!
Oh, no, but we're good enough to build sets for her show, right?
sorry, I didn't mean that. Where are you going?
I don't wanna be around you! I don't even want you to come to the show to watch it.
Oh, come on! - I don't! I don't even like you anymore!
get back here, young lady! Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Hey, young lady! Get back here, young lady!
No! You can't tell me what to do! I don't have to do anything you say!
Yes, you do! - Why?
because l'm your father, that's why!
so what? - Don't you yell at me, Gertrude!
I'll yell at you all I want!
blah, blah, blah! I'm not moving to the stupid city!
all right, that's it! You are moving to the city and you're gonna like it, and that's the end.
I hate you! I wish you'd died, not Mommy!
I hate you right back, you little shit!
you and your mother took my life away and I just want it back!
God, l'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I didn't mean...
get off me! - l'm sorry...
get off of me!
what the hell's the matter with you?
huh?!
# I took my love and I took it down # I climbed a mountain and I turned around # And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills # Till the landslide brought me down # Oh, mirror in the sky what is love?
# Can the child within my heart rise above?
# Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
# Can I handle the seasons of my life?
# Mm-mm, I don't know # Well, I've been afraid of changing # 'Cause I've built my life around you # But time makes you bolder # Children get older # And I'm getting older too - Hey. - Hey.
what happened to you the other night? You just sort of took off.
it looked to me like you guys needed a little privacy.
what I really needed was a little backup.
she's a kid, Ollie. Kids don't weather change well.
I mean, in a few years, you won't be able to keep her out of Manhattan.
but for now, she just wants what she knows.
so do l.
Yeah, but is that even what you know anymore?
Oh, Jesus. You too?
you want your old life back. Big-money job, out of your old man's house...
it's not like it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah. So?
that's your life that you want back, not theirs.
I mean, this is their life. What you're sort of saying to everybody who loves you is that what we have isn't good enough for you.
so it's just upsetting everybody, you know?
everybody? - Oh... What, me?
I mean, it's not like we've got some big romance going on or anything.
we're just friends, right?
did you ever wonder if... maybe someday it might...
be more than that?
for about two seconds, before you had me hiding in the shower from your kid.
look, Ollie, I like you, but...
I'm not gonna be all heartbroken 'cause you're leaving town.
I know.
even if I took this job in the city,
I'd still come back down here and visit my old man. And you.
Why? I mean, you think l'm gonna stick around here for much longer?
Maya... - Ollie...
I gotta get back to work.
if... if I don't... if I don't see you at the show, give me a call sometime when you get all settled up in the big city.
come on...
shit.
# Now there's tears on the pillow # Darling where we slept # And you took my heart when you left # Without your sweet kiss my soul is lost, my friend # Tell me, how do I begin again?
# My city's in ruins # My city's in ruins # Now with these hands # With these hands # With these hands # With these hands # I pray, Lord # With these hands - # With these hands - # I pray for the strength, Lord # With these hands With these hands # I pray for the faith, Lord
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, baby. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
it's OK.
listen. I'm sorry - for yelling at you the other night.
I was wrong. And I didn't mean any of the things that I said.
I know. Neither did l.
daddy? - Yeah?
did Mommy like living in the city?
Yeah, she did. She loved it.
then I guess l'll love it too.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Thanks.
you know, I still might make it to your show tomorrow, if the traffic's not too bad.
I won't be mad if you miss it. I understand.
OK, sweetie. Go back to sleep. I love you.
good night, Daddy.
good night.

george Clooney's office for T ony on line one.
the Angellotti Company. One moment, please.
can I help you? - Yes.
my name's Oliver Trinke and l'm here to see Arthur Brickman and Mr. Angellotti.
OK.
Mr. Trinke is here.
OK, I will.
they'll be about ten more minutes. - OK.
you can have a seat. - Right, right...
hello.
Oh, my God... Hi!
I'm here to see Brad.
Yes! He's expecting you, sir.
he apologizes, but he's stuck in traffic He's just a few blocks away.
why don't you just have a seat and l'll let him know that you've arrived.
thank you very much.
they love to keep you waiting, don't they?
excuse me? - They love to keep you waiting.
right. Yeah, yeah, they do.
I think they think it gives them a psychological edge, you know?
well, it's about to give 'em the edge of my ass, 'cause that's all they're gonna see when l'm walkin' out that door.
you know anything about these guys?
only that they're the fastest-growing...
...firm in the business." Yes, I read that article too.
all right, well... You know as much as I do.
I guess that means they know what they're doing.
I suppose. Unless these publicists hire other publicists to get the word out for 'em.
right. And then those publicists hire their own publicists to help spin the good publicity they created for these publicists.
of course, knowing publicists, they probably hire publicists to promote the fact that they spun the publicity that they hired the other publicists to spin. So...
Oh man! So what do you do? - l'm a publicist.
I didn't realize I was sitting here talking to an Angellotti man.
well, to tell you the truth, l'm not an Angellotti man.
at least not yet. I'm here trying to get a job.
these guys have been tryin' to steal me from my publicist since my last flick.
Oh, the robot movie, right? - Oh, yeah, you saw it?
I haven't gotten around to it yet. I'm gonna...
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot for the support though, man.
I wanna see it... - You know what? It's not that good.
I have a kid. I don't get a chance to get out and see movies unless they have singing crabs in 'em.
singing crabs? I saw that one. That means you have a girl.
that's right.
how old is she? - She's seven.
yeah? Cool. I got a girl and two boys.
three kids?
God. How do you find time to make all those blockbusters?
shoot, if I didn't have all them damn kids,
I wouldn't have to make these blockbusters.
right.
Oh, man.
lt's cool, though, isn't it? - Making blockbusters?
you tell me. - Bein' a parent, funny man.
it has its moments.
what's your daughter's name? - Gertrude.
Damn! Why'd you do that to that girl, man?
did you lose a bet? - No.
no, it was my wife's name. - "Was " ? OK, let me guess.
she took you for half after she saddled the kid with the name Gert?
I can't blame it on her. I saddled the kid with the name Gert.
she died in childbirth. So...
no, no, no, it's... - I feel like an asshole, man.
don't worry about it. - No, listen, l'm really sorry about that.
I didn't see your movie, so we're even. Trust me.
this is exactly why people don't talk to each other in waiting rooms, right?
probably. Although, I gotta tell ya...
the fact that the guy who wrote "Parents Just Don't Understand " is now a parent completely makes up for it.
Oh, man. We don't though, do we?
what's that? - Understand.
I mean, these kids today. From the door, man, they got it all over us.
my daughter has it all over me, I can tell you that.
Yeah, my middle one, my son?
every time I walk out of the house in the morning he says, "Daddy, how far you love me? "
I always pick somewhere close. "l love you to that table, man.
no, you don't. You love me all the way to the moon and back down to the dirt.
that's great.
it take everything I got to walk out of that house.
you get to spend time with them on the set though, right?
Oh, yeah. But if I was a smart man, I wouldn't be sittin' here right now.
I'd be at home playing in the dirt with my kids.
but we all know that l'm not famous 'cause of my brains.
it's 'cause l'm, like, strikingly handsome, crazy sexy.
and l'm, like, hung like it's ridiculous.
Oh, man! But l'm definitely not the sharpest spoon in the shed.
you know...
it was really nice talking to you. - Oh, hey, you too, man.
you out? - l'm out.
Hey, you recommend these guys?
uh... only guy I can recommend is named Arthur Brickman.
other than that, I can't vouch for anybody.
whoa, whoa, hold on. You Brickman?
no. I'm just a guy who'd rather play in the dirt with his kid.
# Toby! - # Coming! 'Scuse me - # Ale there! - # Right, mum!
# Quick now!

you want some rouge, or should I just pinch your cheeks?
pinch my cheeks, kids' show or not, l'll put you through the wall.

first-grader Gertrude Trinke and her father, Oliver...
Psst!
just my grandfather. - Oh.
I'm sorry. First-grader Gertrude Trinke and her grandfather will be performing what I can only assume is a hymn, entitled "God, That's Good " , from the musical Sweeney Todd, # Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
# Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well # At that delicate, luscious, ambrosial smell?
# Yes, they are, I can tell # Well, ladies and gentlemen, that aroma enriching the breeze # Is like nothing compared to its succulent source # As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course # Ladies and gentlemen, you can't imagine the rapture and star # Just inside of this door # There you'll sample Mrs. Lovett's meat pies # Savory and sweet pies, as you see # You who eats pies Mrs. Lovett's meat pies # Conjure up the treat pies used to be - # Toby! - # Coming!

I love you, Daddy. - I love you too.
I love you so much.
you were great. - You too.
you... guys...
were... great! - Ooh!
Oh, God!
Hey, Gertie! Come dance with me.
Bye, Uncle Greenie. Bye, Uncle Block. - Bye, sweetheart.
l'm startin' to like show business. - Yeah.
well, don't get caught up in the glory. Tomorrow you're on shithouse duty.
you know, sometimes I just wanna... - Uh-huh.
I'm so tired of being your little geisha.
you had me worried there for a minute.
Yeah, who knew all those years you were nursing a case of stage fright.
not about that, smart ass. About the other thing.
about moving away. - Come on, Dad.
don't you wanna live alone again?
not as much as I don't wanna die alone.
we're not going anywhere, Pop.
you wanna go over there and cheer up your pop?
he's devastated about missing his big singing debut.
Aw!
pop!
Hey, Princess!
look at you. Mr. Big Hero of the Night.
Yeah, well, it might take me longer than some, but l, uh...
may l? - Uh...
OK.
I like to think I come around eventually.
well, you showing up when you did like that?
that was just about the most romantic thing l've ever seen.
honestly.
well... stick around.
it may get even more romantic than that.
Really? - Yeah.
see? How was that for romance?
I'll think about it.
do that.
Ollie Trinke...
Hey.
your kid's cuttin' a rug with that Maya.
uh...
the sun even shines on a dog's ass some days.
you getting a dog?
Maya?
can I dance with my dad now? - If you must.
don't let him go, though, Gert. He's one of a kind.
I know.
come here.
you wanna dance? - So, no city?
no. No city. - We're staying here with Pop?
God help us, yes, we're staying with Pop.
and you're taking me to see Cats? - Oh-ho! Nice try, but no.
thank you, Daddy. - Anything for you, Gert.
you know why? - Why?
cause you're the only thing I was ever really good at.

legend tells of a legendary warrior...
...whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.
he traveled the land in search of worthy foes.
I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!
the warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full.
then he swallowed. And then he spoke.
enough talk. Let's fight!
Shashabooey!
he was so deadly in fact, that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness.
my eyes! - He's too awesome!
and attractive. - How can we repay you?
there is no charge for awesomeness or attractiveness.
kablooey!
it mattered not how many foes he faced.
they were no match for his bodacity!
never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved!
even the most heroic heroes in China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master.
we should hang out.
agreed!
but hanging out would have to wait.
because when you're facing the 10, 000 demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters and that's...
Po! Get up!
you'll be later for work!
what?
Po! Get up!
Po? What are you doing up there?
nothing.
monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.
coming!
sorry, Dad.
sorry doesn't make the noodles.
what were you doing up there? All that noise.
nothing. I just had a crazy dream.
about what?
what were you dreaming about?
what was I?
I was dreaming about...
...noodles.
noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles?
Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
careful! That soup is sharp.
Oh, happy day!
my son, finally having the noodle dream!
you don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment.
this is a sign, Po.
a sign of what?
you are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!
as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father...
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.
dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.
no, it was the dream.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
but, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else?
something besides noodles?
actually, when I was young and crazy,
I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
why didn't you?
because it was a stupid dream.
can you imagine me making tofu?
tofu.
No! We all have our place in this world.
mine is here, and yours is...
I know, is here.
no, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12
service with a smile.
well done, students， if you were trying to disappoint me.
Tigress, you need more ferocity. Monkey, greater speed.
crane, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis...
master Shifu. - What?
it's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
master Oogway, you summoned me? Is something wrong?
why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
so, nothing's wrong?
well, I didn't say that.
you were saying?
I have had a vision.
Tai Lung will return.
that is impossible! He is in prison.
nothing is impossible.
Zeng!
fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
Yes, Master Shifu!
one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
we must do something! We can't let him march on the valley, take his revenge!
he'll...
your mind is like this water, my friend.
when it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see.
but if you allow it to settle...
...the answer becomes clear.
the Dragon Scroll.
it is time.
but who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
to become the Dragon Warrior?
I don't know.
excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
watch it!
sorry. Suck it up!
sorry. A thousand pardons.
what?
master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today!
everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!
we've waited 1, 000 years for this! Take the bowl!
this is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go!
Po! Where are you going?
to the Jade Palace.
you're forgetting your noodle cart.
the whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
selling noodles?
but, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...
yeah? - I was thinking maybe I...
...could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad.
that's my boy!
I told you that dream was a sign.
Yeah. Glad I had it.
I'm a kung fu warrior! - Me, too!
there's spots at the top. - Let's go.
come on! Come on!
almost there.
what?
No! Oh, no!
sorry, Po. - We'll bring you back a souvenir.
no. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
it is an historic day.
isn't it, Master Oogway?
Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see.
are your students ready?
Yes, Master Oogway.
know this, old friend.
whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the valley...
...but also to you.
let the tournament begin!
no, no, wait!
I'm coming! Wait, wait!
Yes!
Hey! Open the door!
let me in!
citizens of the Valley of Peace, it is my great honor to present to you- Tigress!
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!
the Furious Five!
Yeah, the Furious Five!
warriors, prepare!
wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.
ready for battle! - Yeah.
the Thousand Tongues of Fire.
look at that.
Hey! Get out of the way!
and finally Master Tigress!
and believe me, citizens, you have not seen anything yet.
I know!
master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death.
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
citizens of the Valley of Peace,
master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!
Oh, no! No, no, wait!
Yeah.
Po!
what are you doing?!
what does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
but I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!
I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad.
I love kung fu!
come on, son. Let's get back to work.
OK.
come back!
what's going on?
where?
what are you pointing?
OK. Sorry.
I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
how interesting.
master, are you pointing at me?
him. - Who?
you. - Me?
the universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
what? - What?
What?!- What?
stop, wait! Who told you to?
master Oogway, wait.
that flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.
you were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her!
that was just an accident!
there are no accidents.
forgive us, Master. We have failed you.
no. If the panda has not quit by morning then I will have failed you.
wait! Wait, wait, wait! I bring a message from Master Shifu.
What?!
double the guard!
extra precautions!
your prison may not be adequate!
you doubt my prison security?!
absolutely not.
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.
escape from Chorh-Gom prison is impossible!
impressive, isn't it?
it's very impressive.
it's very impressive.
one way in, one way out.
one thousand guards and one prisoner.
Yes, except that prisoner...
...is Tai Lung.
take us down.
what are you doing?
Oh, my.
behold Tai Lung.
I'm just gonna wait right here.
it's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.
crossbows! At the ready!
Crossbows?
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.
don't get him mad.
what's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized.
did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?
I'm good. I've seen enough.
I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about.
no, he doesn't.
I'll tell him that.
can we please go now?
dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
wait a second!
I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm...
the Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!
look at this place.
master Flying Rhino's armor, with authentic battle damage!
the Sword of Heroes!
said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking.
the Invisible Trident of Destiny!
I've only seen paintings of that painting.
No!
the legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.
said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army.
hello.
have you finished sight- seeing?
sorry, I should have come to you first.
my patience is wearing thin.
well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
would you turn around? - Sure.
how's it going?
how do you get 5, 000... Master Shifu!
someone... broke that.
but I'll fix it. Do you have some...
...glue?
a splinter.
so you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?
I guess so. - Wrong!
you are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
so, how does this work?
do you have a ladder, or a trampoline, or?
you think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret to limitless power? - No, I...
one must first master the highest level of kung fu.
and that is impossible if that one is someone like you.
someone like me?
Yes, look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms!
those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
and this ridiculous belly.
and utter disregard for personal hygiene.
now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for.
don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.
listen, Oogway said I was...
the Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
Oh, you know this hold?
developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty.
then you know what happens when I flex my pinky.
no, no! - You know the hardest part of this?
the hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.
OK, OK, take it easy.
now listen closely, panda.
Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you,
I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear?
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.
good.
I can't wait to get started.
let's begin. - Wait, wait, wait.
what?
now? - Yes, now.
unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
Oh, OK, well...
I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we?
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
what level is that?
well, I'm not a master, but...
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.
no. There is no such thing as level zero.
maybe I can start with that. - That?
we use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot.
but if you insist...
the Furious Five!
you're bigger than your action figures. Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.
go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.
are they gonna watch, or should I wait till they get back to work?
hit it.
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting.
so my kung fu might not be as good as... later on.
just hit it.
all right.
what you got? You got nothing, cause I got it right here.
you picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder.
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.
come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.
you've only seen praying mantis.
or monkey style.
or I could come at you snickety-snake.
would you hit it!
all right. All right.
why don't you try again? A little harder.
how's that?
that hurts.
this will be easier than I thought.
I'm feeling a little nauseous!
those are hard!
my tenders.
how did I do?
there is now a level zero.
there's no words. - No denying that.
what was Master Oogway thinking?
the poor guy's gonna get himself killed.
he is so mighty!
the Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!
when he walks, the very ground shakes!
one would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.
or even see his toes.
OK.
great.
Hi. You're up.
I am now.
I was just...
some day, huh?
that kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore?
I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so...
Yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. - OK, thanks.
it's just... Man, I'm such a big fan!
you guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.
outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop. You just...
sorry about that.
look, you don't belong here.
I know. I know. You're right.
I don't have... I just...
my whole life I dreamed of...
no, I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room.
property of Crane.
OK. Right, right.
so, you want to get to sleep.
Yeah. - I'm keeping you up.
we got big things tomorrow.
all right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.
what was that?
I didn't say anything.
OK. All right. Good night.
sleep well.
that seemed a little awkward.
master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you.
you don't belong here. - Yeah, of course.
this is your room.
I mean, you don't belong in the Jade Palace.
you're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning.
big fan!
I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
I understand. You eat when you are upset.
upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset.
so why are you so upset?
I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu.
in the history of China. In the history of sucking!
probably.
and the Five! Man, you should've seen them! They totally hate me.
totally.
how is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?
I mean, I'm not like the Five.
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.
even Mantis has those... thingies.
maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
quit, don't quit.
noodles, don't noodles.
you are too concerned with what was and what will be.
there's a saying:
yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift.
that is why it is called the present.
Oh, no! - What's happening?!
to your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!
fire crossbows!
fire!
fire!
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.
not going anywhere! Neither is he! - Let go of me!
bring it up!
wait! Bring it back!
he's coming this way! - He won't get far. Archers!
we're dead. So very, very dead.
not yet we're not. Now!
can we run now? - Yes.
I'm glad Shifu sent you.
I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten.
fly back there and tell them...
...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
good morning, Master!
panda!
panda!
wake up!
he's quit.
what do we do now, with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Warrior?
all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
what are you doing here?
Hi! Good morning, Master!
I thought I'd warm up a little.
you're stuck.
stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?
Nah. This is one of my... Yeah, I'm stuck.
help him. - Oh, dear.
maybe on three. One, two...
...three.
thank you. - Don't mention it.
no, really, I appreciate... - Ever.
you actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?
it takes years to develop one's flexibility!
and years longer to apply it in combat!
put that down!
the only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
Yeah! Excellent.
let's get started.
are you ready? - I was born re...
I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready.
that was awesome! Let's go again!
I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more.
your next opponent will be me.
all right! Yeah, let's go!
step forth.
the true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...
...and make him suffer for it.
Oh, yeah!
to take his strength and use it against him...
...until he finally falls...
...or quits.
a real warrior never quits.
don't worry, Master. I will never quit!
if he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
but he will.
he's not going to quit, is he?
he's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that.
I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
trust me, it will.
it's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur.
sure you were.
who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.
I'm over here.
maybe you should look at this again.
Oh, OK.
stop it. Stop!
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...
...but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
I know he can seem kind of heartless...
...but he wasn't always like that.
according to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
No! - Yes.
but that was before.
before what?
before Tai Lung.
we're not really supposed to talk about him.
well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.
he was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
and then he turned bad, and now he's in jail.
he wasn't just a student.
Shifu found him as a cub...
...and he raised him as his son.
and when the boy showed talent in kung fu...
...Shifu trained him.
he believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.
it was never enough for Tai Lung.
he wanted the Dragon Scroll.
but Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.
outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.
he tried to take the scroll by force.
and Shifu had to destroy what he had created.
but how could he?
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
or since.
and now he has a chance to make things right.
to train the true Dragon Warrior.
and he's stuck with you.
a big fat panda who treats it like a joke.
that is it!
wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
and may have also stopped his heart.
inner peace.
inner peace.
Inner...
inner peace.
would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down!
Inner...
Oh, Zeng.
excellent.
I could use some good news right now.
master! Master!
I have... It's... It's very bad news.
Shifu.
there is just news. There is no good or bad.
master, your vision. Your vision was right.
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.
that is bad news...
...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
the panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.
he wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.
there are no accidents.
Yes, I know. You've said that already.
twice. - Well, that was no accident, either.
thrice.
my old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control.
illusion?
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time.
but there are things we can control.
I can control when the fruit will fall.
and I can control...
...where to plant the seed.
that is no illusion, Master.
Yes.
but no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
you may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.
but a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
maybe it can.
if you are willing to guide it.
to nurture it.
to believe in it.
but how? How?
I need your help, Master.
no, you just need to believe.
promise me, Shifu.
promise me you will believe.
I will try.
good.
my time has come.
you must continue your journey without me.
what are you? Wait!
master!
you can't leave me!
you must believe.
master!
Yeah, so I'm like, "Fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province...
...but you're a lousy tipper.
Really? So how did you get out of there alive?
I mean, I didn't actually say that...
...but I thought it...
...in my mind.
if he could read my mind, he'd be, like, "What"?
order up! Hope you like it.
this is really good! - No, come on.
try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
what do you mean? This is amazing!
you're a really good cook. - I wish my mouth was bigger.
Tigress, you've got to try this.
it is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.
I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice.
what? - Nothing... Master Shifu.
never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!
what is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it!
work hard, panda, and maybe someday...
...you will have ears like mine.
that's good.
ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.
it's Shifu!
of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
master Shifu!
you think this is funny?
Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children!
what? - He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him.
and I was saying you got no sense of humor.
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.
what? You're serious? And I have to?
master Oogway will stop him, like he did before.
Oogway cannot!
not anymore.
our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
the panda? - Yes, the panda!
master, let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.
No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung.
it is his!
Where'd he go?
you cannot leave! A real warrior never quits.
watch me.
come on.
how am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs.
you will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.
you don't believe that. You never believed that.
from the beginning, you've tried to get rid of me.
Yes! I was.
but now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
you're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.
Yeah, I stayed.
I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me.
I stayed because I thought, if anyone could change me...
...could make me... not me...
...it was you.
the greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!
but I can change you!
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.
even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior?
how?
how?
how?! - I don't know!
I don't know.
that's what I thought.
this is what you trained me for.
Tigress!
don't try and stop me.
we're not trying to stop you.
what?
we're coming with you!
what? I eat when I'm upset, OK?
no need to explain.
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
don't tell Monkey.
look at you. - Yeah, I know, I disgust you.
no, I mean, how did you get up there?
I don't know. I guess that...
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.
yet you are ten feet off the ground.
and you have done a perfect spilt.
no, this? This is just...
...an accident.
there are no accidents.
come with me.
I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey...
...but could you at least tell me where we're going?
you dragged me...
...all the way out here...
...for a bath?
Panda...
...we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.
the Pool of...
this is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries...
...of harmony and focus.
this is the birthplace of kung fu.
do you want to learn kung fu?
Yeah!
then I am your master!
OK!
don't cry.
OK.
when you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate...
...you stink.
perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.
I now see that the way to get through to you...
...is with this.
Oh, great, cause I am hungry.
good.
when you have been trained, you may eat.
let us begin.
after you, panda.
just like that?
no sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?
I vowed to train you, and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
enjoy.
Hey!
I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
Hey!
you are free to eat.
am I?!- Are you?
I'm not hungry.
master.
cut it!
Where's the Dragon Warrior?
how do you know you're not looking at her?
you think I'm a fool?
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire.
that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
Po? - So that is his name. Po.
finally, a worthy opponent.
our battle will be legendary!
we've got this. Help her.
monkey!
go!
what was I thinking?!
Mantis!
now!
Shifu taught you well.
but he didn't teach you everything.
you have done well, panda.
done well? Done well?
I've done awesome!
the mark of a true hero is humility.
but, yes, you have done...
...awesome
guys? Guys?! They're dead!
no, they're breathing. They're asleep? But their eyes are open.
we were no match for his nerve attach.
he's gotten stronger.
who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
he's too fast!
sorry, Po.
I thought we could stop him.
he could have killed you.
why didn't he?
so you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work.
it might. I mean, a little.
I'm pretty scared.
you can defeat him, panda!
are you kidding? If they can't!
they're five masters. I'm just one me.
but you will have the one thing that no one else does.
you really believe I'm ready?
you are...
...Po.
behold the Dragon Scroll.
it is yours.
wait. What happens when I read it?
legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.
Really? That's cool.
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.
you will feel the universe in motion around you.
can I punch through walls?
do a quadruple back flip? - Focus.
will I? - Focus.
focus. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.
read it and become...
...the Dragon Warrior.
it's impossible to open.
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.
thank you.
I probably loosened it up for you though.
OK, here goes.
it's blank. - What?
here, look. - No, I am forbidden to look upon...
blank. I don't...
I don't understand.
OK. So, like...
...Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.
no. Oogway was wiser than us all.
Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident.
of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
but who will stop Tai Lung?
he'll destroy everything and everyone.
no.
evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
what about you, Master? - I will fight him.
what? - I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
but, Shifu, he'll kill you.
then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
listen to me, all of you.
it is time for you to continue yourjourney without me.
I am very proud to have been your master.
we've got to get them out safely.
come, little one. Let's find your mama.
viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north.
crane, light the way.
look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
Hey, Dad.
Po!
good to have you back, son.
good to be back.
let's go, Po.
so for our next shop, it's time to face it...
...the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables...
...no longer slices.
also, I was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
you like that?
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.
it just wasn't meant to be.
Po, forget everything else.
your destiny still awaits.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.
I don't know, Dad.
honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
Po...
...I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago.
OK.
the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
come here. The secret ingredient is...
...nothing.
you heard me. Nothing!
there is no secret ingredient!
wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?
you don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
don't have to. To make something special, you just believe it's special.
there is no secret ingredient.
I have come home, Master.
this is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.
so where is this Po?
did I scare him off?
this battle is between you and me.
so, that is how it's going to be.
that is how it must be.
I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness!
obeying your master is not weakness!
you knew I was the Dragon Warrior.
you always knew.
but when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do?
what did you do?
nothing!
you were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
not your fault?
who filled my head with dreams?
who drove me to train until my bones cracked?
who denied me my destiny?
it was never my decision to make!
it is now.
give me the scroll!
I would rather die.
all I ever did, I did to make you proud!
tell me how proud you are, Shifu!
tell me!
tell me!
I have... I have always been proud of you.
from the first moment, I've been proud of you.
and it was my pride...
...that blinded me.
I loved you too much to see what you were becoming...
...what I...
...was turning you into.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I don't want your apology.
I want my scroll!
what?
where is it?
dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.
you will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.
never.
never.
stairs.
who are you?
buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
you?
him? He's a panda.
you're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?
don't tempt me.
no. I'm gonna use this.
you want it? Come and get it.
Finally!
that scroll is mine!
lightning!
the scroll has given him power!
No!
Finally! Oh, yes.
the power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!
it's nothing!
it's OK. I didn't get it the first time, either.
what?
there is no secret ingredient.
it's just you.
stop it!
I'm gonna pee.
don't.
don't! Don't!
you...
...can't defeat me.
you...
...you're just a big...
...fat...
...panda!
I'm not a big fat panda.
I'm the big fat panda.
the Wuxi Finger Hold!
Oh, you know this hold?
you're bluffing. You're bluffing. Shifu didn't teach you that.
Nope.
I figured it out. Skadoosh.
look!
the Dragon Warrior.
that's my boy! That big lovely kung fu warrior is my son!
Yes!
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, guys.
master.
master.
master?
master Shifu!
master!
Shifu, are you OK?!
Po.
you're alive.
or we're both dead.
no, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung.
you did?
it is as Oogway foretold.
you are the Dragon Warrior.
you have brought peace...
...to this valley...
...and...
...and to me.
thank you.
thank you, Po.
thank you. Thank you.
No! Master! No, no, no, don't die, Shifu, please!
I'm not dying, you idiot!
dragon Warrior...
...I am simply at peace. Finally.
so, I should stop talking?
if you can.
want to get something to eat?
Yeah.

I don't want to know.
how'd the car get in here?
the doorway's not big enough.
we dissed them, spit on them!
but the cops didn't move an inch.
then the mothers stepped aside to make a path...
then these plainclothes pigs came out with wooden clubs.
they hit a homeboy, like real bad!
kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.
I kicked a pig right in the head!
that's a Yamaha.
more like your Mom on a Harley!
it's Mohammed's bike. He fixed the exhaust.
no, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!
which Mohammed?
Farida's brother?
farida with the driver's licence?
no, Farida from the supermarket.
anyway, it was a scene.
you should've been there Hubert. It was intense.
tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop, all the fists you can eat, getting hell at home:
sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!
gimme a break! It was war against the pigs, in living color!
I was trying to make some cash.
your bogus riot fucked it up!
when a brother goes down, I stand up!
what brother? Do I know the guy?
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangsta I don't know.
let's go.
I mean it!
Abdel's no gangsta.
OK, but I'm not faster than a speeding bullet!
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!
gimme one.
and go broke?
don't make us cry!
I'll make you cry, Sayid!
everyone pays the same!
except Hubert, it's his building.
a buck?
a buck for one, OK two!
you're a drag!
you should try one.
got a buck? - Yeah, for me!
here.
no way, I'll remember this!
so remember. - Never forget.
don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.
how? With your sister?
don't talk that way about her!
chill out, you bogus Arab!
Sayid! Come back with that!
got any change?
we're broke!
2 bits. - We're broke.
...the judge says I go to jail, or do jobs for the City.
community service? The pits!
ever do it? Jail's bad enough!
you'd rather do time?
your bro stole a dog!
liar! - His mouth is full!
put it on my tab.
liar! Your nose is growing!
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!
beat it!
like the gun in "Lethal Weapon" .
we saw that movie together! It was a 9mm. Glock!
what? - No, it wasn't!
that was a Desert Eagle.
he shot at the truck!
that wasn't " Lethal Weapon" !
what are you talking about?
a cop lost his handgun during the riot.
that's a good one!
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.
but I'd like to know who found it!
no joke!
...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.
everyone's been inside, except me.
a month for theft is pathetic!
not in your league!
what league? I was never inside! - You got nabbed.
I quit in time!
come look!
we got visitors.
over here!
it's the mayor!
up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor! Mothafucka!
cut the stereo!
who's in charge here? You, Nordeen?
what's going on here?
think you're in Disneyland?
you're not allowed up here. You gotta go down.
we're causing no trouble.
still, you've got to get off the roof.
we like it up here.
off the roof.
you learn that shit at Notre Dame?
cut it out! Quiet everyone!
I'll handle this! - Forget it!
you can't stay here!
so fold your little tents, grab your chairs...
...and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.
who's gonna make us leave?
your goons or you, in your little uniform?
Nordeen, we're doing our job.
leave us alone!
don't talk to me like that, I don't know you.
now get lost!
sitting duck!
your mother drinks Bud!
anyone who wants to stay, stay! Heat's off.
I'm staying. - You're going.
let me stay, Nordeen.
what did I say? - You said go.
so what do you do? - I go!
OK, I'm going!
Vinz, c'mon!
don't play tough guy!
you always wimp out!
...you see 'em in porn stores.
what are they called?
g-strings.
what? - G-strings, moron.
she had one on, I swear it.
I fucked her like an animal.
we were in the room...
she kept screaming for more.
guy next door pounded the wall we were so noisy.
you dreamt you fucked her!
what?
you know the bitch? - I know her, she has AIDS.
get outta here!
Hi, we're from TV. - What's this?
were you in the riot last night?
did you break things, burn cars?
we look like looters, lady? - I didn't say that.
so what do we look like? - Nothing special.
get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.
we got work to do.
what kind of work? Stirring up shit?
for a juicy scoop! - No camera!
quit snooping in the 'hood, fuckface! Stop taping!
quit taping, dickhead!
this ain't Thoiry!
what's with all the assholes today?
that fuckin' broad...
what's Thoiry?
a drive-in safari park.
this ain't no zoo!
open up, WalMart!
you fuckin' jerks.
talk nice, we're in France.
it's 1 p. m. and you're in bed?
what's with the hair net?
lay off!
you a movie star, WalMart?
what's this shitty TV?
watch where you sit!
just sweat pants!
Where's the new TV?
it's too big to move.
I came by for my cash. Where were you?
I don't have it.
don't you know what happened?
go see what your pals did.
Foued's brother did that.
so what?
give me his address.
look what he did to my car!
look what he did!
just look!
leave that alone.
I lost ten grand! I can't work now.
walmart, it's just a car!
that's what you say!
you don't realize.
it's all I got.
cut it out!
leave that alone!
a homeboy's dying, fuck your car!
" a homeboy!" Big deal!
you disgust me!
that car's all I have. It's my life!
they're showing the riot! - My car's more important!
look, the riot.
some TV! - Sure, bust it!
fix the antenna! - I'm trying!
it's David!
how'd he get on TV?
I was over there, they missed me!
fix it! I can't see a thing! - This TV sucks!
how'd that fucker get on TV?
Hey, gimme my money!
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.
gimme my coat and get outta my face!
you guys must be happy.
a cop lost his gun in the riot.
I hope the guy who finds it uses it uptown, not here for once!
forget it, we'll get even!
you know that show, "Candid Camera"?
so this celebrity's sure he's been set up.
his buddy's fixed it with the camera guys.
the celebrity thinks they're out to get him.
he always eats in the same joint.
he's sure they'll film him there.
the others convince him there's a hidden camera.
he sees the TV truck, a camera behind the mirror and the guy with him pretends to act weird.
the celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em, pretending he hasn't noticed.
he thinks all hell will break loose.
but they just film him, jumpy, waiting for shit to happen.
so you see this guy...
cut it out, Sayid!
wasn't me! - Then who?
the celebrity's sweating, trying to act cool.
each time the waiter passes he thinks it'll happen.
then a guy asks him for his autograph.
the celeb thinks it's a trick and Starts ranting at the guy, who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad.
they Start fighting, and the Candid Camera guys have to break it up.
it was a killer punch out.
then what?
that's all.
who was the celebrity?
dunno, but he was real famous.
I don't remember.
this looks like trouble. See ya.
we're THE FUTURE
what did they want?
don't get mad, get even.
it's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.
party time!
we go visit Abdel in the hospital?
I gotta show you something...
that's real steel!
get a load of it. - What a mother!
what'll you do with it?
stop it, Hubert.
what you gonna do with it?
depends if Abdel dies.
you gonna kill a cop?
best way to get respect!
smoking a cop will get you respect?
it'll even up the score.
I could got you a piece. - This one's special.
think you're on a mission?
well, I did find the gun. Leave me alone!
will it help Abdel? - It'll help us.
stop fronting!
you pussy!
you're headed for big shit!
I'll do my thing, you do yours.
I don't want to know. - So don't ask!
one thing's sure...
with that piece you're the big man.
Hey, wait for me!
fuck it...
what the fuck ya doin'?
OK, don't have a shit fit!
sorry, fellas, you can't go in.
let us in. We came to see Abdel.
sorry, I have my orders.
just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave.
he's our friend.
the docs won't let you in. He's in a coma.
we won't make trouble!
if I let you in,
I'll lose my job. - Sure, flunkey!
tone it down. His family's here.
they need peace and quiet!
we're not as good as reporters?
get going!
hands off, man!
you gonna make me leave?
gonna shoot me? Pull out your pop gun!
what's going on here?
look at that fuckface!
we came to see our pal Abdel!
we won't leave till we see him.
beat it, before I take you in.
Oh, yeah?
you shut up!
move 'em out!
we can be nice or nasty. It's up to you!
calm down!
Lieut. these kids made trouble.
I got the ringleader.
he did nothing. - I arrested the leader.
what leader? - He means Sayid.
sure, Uncle Tom!
things aren't bad enough.
you had to go to the hospital?
they were only doing their job.
doing their job?
shut your yap, once and for all!
you shut yours! - Don't talk to me like that!
same to you! - Shut up, will ya!
shit!
you don't know a fucking thing!
what do you know?
cut it out, asshole.
watch your tongue! - If you watch yours!
the bastards who beat up Abdel will go to jail!
you're dreaming.
the cops at the hospital protect Abdel and his family.
you just fuck things up!
you idiot, you got it all wrong.
those cops are just protecting Abdel!
most cops don't beat on you. They protect you!
who protects us from you?
never do it again!
who writes your jokes?
watch your tongue!
watch your mother!
you ever trash me again, you go to central lock-up.
your brother can bail you out.
I didn't ask no favors. - I did it for your brother.
he'd rip you apart!
you're the ripper.
about the boxing gym: I can get you a City grant.
you'll get another gym.
kids want to punch more than bags now!
it's hopeless. Once I could talk to the kids. No more.
and they know me! A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.
an Arab in a police station doesn't last an hour!
I have to go. Try to keep cool.
Yeah, we'll try.
outta my face, you fucker!
you shook his hand?
he's always been cool with me.
you don't shake a pig's hand!
you shoot him, I shake his hand! You're a fuckin'pain!
and you're out of it! Look!
I knew it!
you acted so weird at the hospital.
take it easy. - Let me see.
you didn't tell us?
you didn't want to know!
packing that! You retard!
I'm a big boy. Quit preaching!
I'll bust your chops!
stop it!
you feel big with that gun! I'll kick your ass!
like how?
cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.
you shut up!
I'm splittin'.
so split!
stay with us.
sayid, let him split!
don't go!
back off.
what's with him?
jerk thinks too much.
Where's Mom? - Explain this to me.
I can't now.
well?
what's the answer?
I don't know.
you never know. - OK, I never know.
Hi, Mom.
how's the kid brother?
he's fine.
but your brother in jail isn't so good.
what's with Max?
he needs textbooks.
what for?
to get a high school diploma while he's inside.
he never made grade school!
hands off the pots!
I didn't do nothing!
I dunno how I'll buy his books.
by the way...
there's the money for the power bill.
and my machine? - What machine?
my new sewing machine!
shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.
mine's ready to croak.
Patou, go study in your room.
mom. - Don't argue.
who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?
no, he's in Tower D.
I don't know him.
could he get us textbooks?
that's not his line, Mom.
officials now admit that a policeman lost his gun in the riot last night.
it is still missing.
we asked locals if a loose gun is dangerous in this explosive situation...
what a fuck up!
they burned down the gym.
I'm sick of the projects. I want out. It's getting worse.
I'm sure Vinz helped torch the gym.
he's going wild, like Max.
I have to get out.
I have to leave this place.
if you see a grocery, buy me a lettuce.
no credit for you.
my granma's a regular here! So I'm 2 bits short!
you're not your granma.
hands off! - Just looking!
got two bits? - How about one?
one OK? - One not OK.
gimme a coin, you dinosaur!
no coins for you.
OK... Now what?
so what'll it be?
I saw you! - You saw what?
gimme the red peppers. They're cheaper.
my granma'll kill me! She hates 'em.
so shoot the Chink, grab the green peppers!
it'll make granma's day!
fuck, fuck the po-lice...
he's intense.
killer!
a mother killer!
sayid, check out the cow.
fuck off with your cow!
I swear! - You said you'd cut my hair.
the same cow! I saw it!
you're the cow!
it was the same fuckin' cow!
you gotta believe me!
shut up!
I'm Segnor Duck...
I fucka you, I fucka her, I fucka him...
OK Granma! So they're red peppers!
you know this cow business.
it's a weird trip.
don't wreck my hair!
I gotta get laid! So watch it!
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.
a lawn?
sit your ass down.
it's hot, Vinz. - What?
a cop's piece is hot.
you said that already. Sit still, loser!
I'll whack you.
don't move.
if Abdel dies, you'll kill?
wanna be the next Arab iced by the pigs?
well, me neither.
well, me neither.
so now you're an Arab!
they think we're full of shit.
but I'm not bullshitting about this, Sayid.
watch it!
it's cool.
is this gun legit for a cop?...What'd you do?
nothing, I swear it!
why swear?
because it's nothing.
I'm cold there!
it's cold in this room!
I'll even it out, it'll be great!
I got a date! Lemme see!
no fuckin' trust!
I didn't see!
you didn't look!
trust me, dammit!
it's a nice hole.
a nice what?
trust me, or no haircut!
look at me, Sayid!
get outta here!
don't get bummed out!
it's the style in New York.
the killer cut, so stop whining!
new York?
they got hair like this in New York? I look punk!
honest!
don't laugh!
give us a kiss, Sayid.
outta my face!
no hard feelings, sucker!
hey pooch, your master's an asshole!
there's your sister.
Why're you here? - And you?
I'm asking the questions!
you should be in school.
get outta here!
get lost, you cows.
you still here?
get lost!
you talk to my friends!
to Vincent.
the name's Vinz, not Vincent! And don't talk to him!
get a move on! - Don't push!
coming tonight? - Where?
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.
got tickets? - Freebies.
killer!
who cut your hair, Sayid?
kids these days!
check that!
shit's happenin'!
Abdel's my brother, pig!
you're gonna pay!
step on it!
it's stalled!
outta the car, freeze!
drop the gun!
Freeze!
get back!
get the fuck out!
riot cops are coming!
get back, scum!
Vinz, Hubert, this way!
this way!
Freeze!
you crazy?
where were you?
we fucked your mother!
I swear the pig was right in my sights.
I had him like I have you now!
the sucker froze, shit his pants.
without Hubert, I'd have smoked him!
right in the mother!
Hubert slugged him so hard he went into orbit!
No!
I swear it!
slugged a pig?
you were great!
the WORLD IS YOURS
now what do we do?
I gotta call to get my bucks.
got Snoopy's address?
I'll wait, but not forever!
this cost me a $3 chocolate milk! I'd better collect!
you want some, Vinz?
want some? - No.
you sure?
want some, Cousin Hubie?
you're already chocolate!
will you guys stop sulking?
who's sulking? Not me!
unbelievable! - Ask him!
a couple of kids!
who's the kid? - 2 kids worrying over jackshit!
I'm 100% behind you!
wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!
tell your buddy to back off! I never said I wanted to.
Yes, you did!
Yes! - No!
I didn't say that!
I said if Abdel died,
I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!
without my gun back there, we'd have been history!
my name's not Rodney King!
not the same thing!
expect us to bring you gifts in jail?
I expect nothing! Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!
go ahead, laugh!
laugh!
I'm fuckin' sick of the goddam system!
we live in rat holes, you do fuck-all to change things!
neither do you!
you're my homeys, so I'll tell you:
if Abdel dies, I hit back.
I'll whack a pig!
so they know we don't turn the other cheek now!
wow, what a speech!
half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.
forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league.
if Abdel dies, we lose a friend?
right!
if a cop dies, do all cops go away?
you're just one guy! You can't blow 'em all away!
who made you a preacher?
you know what's right and wrong?
why do you side with the assholes?
who's the asshole?
in school we learnt that hate breeds hate!
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!
know what it taught me?
turn the other cheek, you're dead mothafucka!
bullshit! You pointed a gun at a cop! We coulda been killed!
nothing like a good shit!
you believe in God? That's the wrong question.
does God believe in us?
I once had a friend called Grunwalski.
we were sent to Siberia together.
when you go to a Siberian work camp, you travel in a cattle car.
you roll across icy steppes for days, without seeing a soul.
you huddle to keep warm.
but it's hard to relieve yourself, to take a shit, you can't do it on the train, and the only time the train stops is to take on water for the locomotive.
but Grunwalski was shy.
even when we bathed together, he got upset.
I used to kid him about it.
so, the train stops and everyone jumps out to shit on the tracks.
I'd teased Grunwalski so much that he went off on his own.
the train Starts moving, so everyone jumps on, because it waits for nobody.
Grunwalski had a problem:
he'd gone behind a bush and was still shitting.
so I see him come out from behind the bush, holding up his pants with his hands.
he tries to catch up.
I hold out my hand, but each time he reaches for it he lets go of his pants and they drop to his ankles.
he pulls them back up,
starts running again, but they fall back down, when he reaches out for me.
then what happened? - Nothing.
Grunwalski...
froze to death.
good day.
why'd he tell us that?
I got the address. I'll call you.
why'd he tell us that?
excuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.
I haven't eaten for 2 days.
my child's hungry, I need your spare change...
I wanna date with Mina!
I'll lasso her!
what d'you want? My dad's in jail, my mom's in jail, my whole family is!
get a job like everyone else!
what is this, Mardi Gras?
I want Mina!
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.
I got out of a halfway house...
it's a block away.
Thanks.

Thanks.
the pigs are fuckin' polite around here!

maybe he won the lottery!
damn, it's locked!

I only know him as Snoopy.

Snoopy.
it sounds weird. - Very funny!
the fucker hung up.

why me? - Try!
darkie and me will get shot at!
hello. - Yes?

no, but Charlie Brown is!
you fucked it up, you asshole!
stop that!
sorry to bother you.

I'm not like you, Mr. Black Hercules, right?
go fuck yourself!
fuck myself?

who're you? - Easy!
you had your fun!

Hey, you!

Freeze!

I don't know him.
we'll see about that, wise guy!
this is humiliating! - Too bad.
what's this?
good stuff!
I'm keeping it.
Afghan's the best.
good buzz going up and down.
same with Black Bombay.
lebanese can really vary.
this is crap but I'll keep it...Well?
the little fucker outran me. Take them in.
get in the back. - Why me?
get in!
listen, scumbag. You know what I think of you?
you're like poodle shit on a sidewalk.
I can't take a step without squashing your ugly dog-turd face.
so watch where the dog dumps you!
you're all alone!
far from the slums...
...and your looter pals.
pick it up with your feet.
like your people do back home.
they're great with their feet.
this is the hard part.
OK, there's no big hurry.
in 2 hours, they may be free.
make the most of it.
how 'bout a bullet in the back of your head?
a nice little bullet?
you gotta stop in time.
you need self-control.
gotta be a pro.
this takes control.
don't get mad! It won't last!
you got something to say?
don't touch him!
you know this one?
the Shanghai Squeeze.
it's an oldie.
wait, I think he's thirsty.
fucker!
don't hurt yourself!
take it easy!
don't get me aroused.
you look like a bitch from behind!
a nice bitch to suck me off!
blow jobs!
bitches to suck my dick!
that's the way. Then you relax!
but it's hard to stop in time.
you gotta stay in control.
that's the trick.
I like his face.
he's cute.
what was the name?
are you cute? - Yes! I'm cute!
I'm cute!
which one? - He's Hubert.
that's no Hubert!
he's French, he's Sayid.
sayid? That's pretty!
is Sayid a French name?
aren't they pretty?
take a good look!
the little guy's excited.
leave him alone!
it's so easy to go too far!
but you mustn't! Though you're dying to!
right, you Arab son of a bitch?
OK, let's go.
sir!
we'll miss the last train!
forget it.
bastard!
did I talk to you?
yo, Vinz!
Where's Sayid and Hubert?
dunno. They pissed me off tonight.
you guys are always fussin'!
your sister's hot.
shut up, asshole.

What'd he owe you?

it's the principle that counts.
principle!
coyote's a bad motherfucker.
roadrunner's a pussy.

I don't take shit from a guy who sees cows!
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.
bottom line! 'Nuff said!
can't talk with you guys if you won't listen.
cause you listen?
you got it all wrong.
I say Tweetie's the baddest. He always wins.
that's bullshit!
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

who does he fuck? Me?
anyway, Sylvester's a black brother.
a black brother?
full of shit!

what can we lose?
it's positively frightful!

he's really cool.
he's too nice. - OK, then!
C'mon Sayid!

Hi, girls!
I'm Sayid.

you're the painting!
I'm good at what?

we heard you were shy!
shy? That's my middle name!
what's your number? We'll go out.
you're all alike!
he said you wanted to talk.
talk? What about?
lighten up! We were ready to talk, but with your attitude, how can we respect you?
who are you? The Wonderbra bitch?
who asked you? - I'm asking you!
he's nuts.

got a screw loose?
you're the screw.

I never learned, I got no licence.
he does. He was in the Army.
the Navy! I can't drive.
I can!
shut up!
Vinz? - What?
you took that bitch around Israel in a Mercedes.
not the same thing!
that was different. It was... uh...
it was an automatic...
more like a dream!
you guys are so lame!
now what?
sorry, but a cop car's coming.

it's real close.

spray cans! - You're the can!
what was that old guy in the john trying to say?
talked about God and shitting. What was the point?
I see skinheads.
you're the skinhead.
fuck Nazis!
the point is: God's inside you, so He helps you dump!
God loves your bowels.
pass the joint.
check this shit out:
pinhead is to skinhead, as teeny is to weenie.
get my drift?
out of the way.
Vinz, Know the one about the guy falling off a skyscraper?
on the way down he says to himself:
so far so good... so far so good...
I heard it with a rabbi.
like us in the projects. So far so good, but how will we land?
I feel like an ant lost in intergalactic space.
watch, I'll switch off the Eiffel Tower.
that only works in movies.
mothafucka!

look at those sheep in the system.
they look cute in their fancy leather jackets.
but they're scumbags.
they ride escalators, carried by the system.
they vote far right, but aren't racists.
they can't move without escalators.
the worst!
racist!

you're the fucker who dissed us from the roof!
the gang banger from the roof?
let's see you fight!

I done nothing!

Whadda you say?

I'm all talk?
watch! Don't try and stop me!
Vinz, don't do it! - Let him!

shut up!
there are good cops.
but the only good skinhead is a dead one!
shoot him.
we took your shit all day. Fuckin' shoot him!

do it for Abdel!
shoot!
get outta here!
see ya tomorrow.

go home, loser.
let's go, Vinz.
later, Hubert.
hear the one about the nun?
this drunk guy comes out of a bar, and walks up to a nun in this big black cape.
wham! He slugs her in her teeth. She goes down and he keeps on pounding her.
after about 5 minutes he stops, looks at her and says:
you're not so tough, Batman!
that's a killer!
he thought the nun was Batman!
I heard it with a rabbi.
over here, you!
what's the matter?
I know you!
you were on the roof!
What're you doin'?
got a problem, you fuck?
scared without your pals?
not so tough now!
look at him!
it's about a society falling...
on the way down it keeps telling itself:
so far so good...
so far so good...
so far so good...
how you fall doesn't matter.
it's how you land!
I have to go. Got a rush job to do.
you did it? - Do what?
you did! - Whatever.
did you like it? - Yeah.
it's been a year?
a year and a half.
good job!
I switched to Gwon Sang-woo.
I thought it was Rain.
rain's too weak. - Is Gwon Sang-woo good?
weaker than Rain.
what about a foreign guy?
like who?
george Clooney? - Not my type.
I think I'm a hotel type.
having sex at home makes me feel like I'm committing an incest.
Hello? Jeong-wan, can you hear me?
if you go out wearing this, they'll blame me for it.
you know that?
did you have breakfast? - Not yet.
did you?
Yes.
when did you leave?
sorry?
that was bad manners.
did you settle your 'rush job'?
Yes.
good morning. - Good morning.
good morning. - Good morning.
Hey.
what do you think of this?
I think it's good.
good, huh?
could you tilt your head down a bit?
your name's Marco, right?
can you stand up this time?
it was just a one-night stand.
go out with him.
come on, he's a married man.
so what?
just sleep with him.
I do need it, though.
you don't trust men anyway.
as long as you don't love him.
is it possible?
why not?
dating is dating and marriage is marriage.
no, I hate taking risks.
dating is fun. It's dramatic and eventful.
married men are way better to date.
they know women well. Better-mannered than single men.
breaking up isn't a burden.
they're cool and don't tie you down.
lady, that's enough. Have your dinner.
jeez, I miss dating guys.
hop on!
how could I ride that? It's humiliating.
just being polite. Bye!
you, bad girl. Grow up.
Hello?
what are you doing?
having marriage problems by any chance?
no.
then what do you want from me?
I don't know.
is it because I'm pretty?
let's have a drink.
I'm on my way to the studio. Got some work left to do.
do you say 'I love you' often?
not really.
good. Don't say it to me, either.
I knew it.
Jeong-wan. Want to be my girlfriend?
heard you're a good photographer.
I sure am.
you must want your own place like this.
I haven't thought about it much.
but I've been his assistant for five years now.
and I'm getting old.
so I do think I need a change.
I can help you.
what are you getting at?
is it a condition for going out?
no. I'm serious.
anyway, thanks.
I'll keep it in mind.
time to go.
no.
but it's a safe day today.
no, the dates have changed, maybe because I'm tired.
then when?
maybe, next week?
let's do it with a condom then.
no, I forgot to buy some.
I've been thinking.
about what?
you don't like sex anymore since we're married now.
you think so?
Yeah.
we used to do it very often.
but recently, you keep saying no, using all sorts of excuses.
what you're saying makes me sad.
so if I don't, you'll hate me?
no, I didn't mean that.
you're everything to me.
you, too.
I love you.
me, too.
good night.
you have a message.
insert password
he's acting like other married men.
this is so funny.
you're going overboard.
come on, it's fun.
now he looks like a man to me.
he must be somewhat popular with the girls out there.
she looked really young. About twenty-four?
you did nothing to him?
Why? I'm so proud of him.
he slept with her? - Probably.
are you okay? - Of course.
it'd be weirder if a man and woman don't have sex.
be careful. Someone could get booted out.
who? My husband?
what a surprise. - I have some free time.
are you free on Sunday? - Yeah.
you must be busy even on Sunday.
people like me don't have weekends.
where are your glasses?
broken.
how come?
did you fight?
your wife is scary.
it's the same design.
why buy the same one as yours?
I don't think it's right.
but these are sunglasses.
why is adultery still a crime?
I don't know.
probably because people cheat more and more.
I wanna go to the department store. There's a bargain sale.
do you have something to buy?
not really, but just looking is fun enough.
shoot! Shoot!
son of a... How could he miss like that?
too much traffic outside.
I saw you walking on the street with a girl a week ago.
she was pretty.
Oh, she's one of my staff.
we were going to settle an account and have dinner as well.
that's why you walked arm-in-arm with her?
young girls these days do it to everyone.
I rejected her several times.
but doing it too often could make things awkward.
so I let her do it. That's all.
Really? Then never mind.
did you expect me to be jealous over her?
not at all. You're not that narrow-minded.
you must be popular out there. Since she put her arm around yours.
no way. Well, just a little.
the man I chose deserves to be.
you know what?
want to go out?
let's do it.
do what?
don't you want to?
so you're not upset? - Of course not.
but this place is too bright.
it's not often, so who cares?
yeah?
can I see it?
only for today.
there's something that I want.
honey! Which one do you like?
whatever you prefer.
I like both of them.
then take them both.
Hello?
is this Mr. Kim Hyung-shik's wife?
Yes.
my name is Kim Ae-ri.
what?
kim Ae-ri?
I was surprised at how pretty you are.
Oh, you were?
you're totally different from what I heard from Mr. Kim.
what did he say?
he said that he couldn't show you to anyone.
must've been out of consideration since he's a nice guy.
you shouldn't have taken him seriously.
so how old are you?
Twenty-two.
the cakes here are very good. Try some.
I heard that he's in big trouble since you saw us walk together.
he's not in big trouble exactly.
I'm not that strict about such things.
I thought I'd tell you this first.
I called you because I don't want to be misunderstood.
misunderstood?
he's the one who started this.
I wanted you to understand that clearly.
I really didn't care. He kept asking me to go out.
perhaps, you're thinking that I'm the one who asked him out.
to be honest, he's not a popular type to girls.
anyway, that's how it happened, so don't misunderstand things.
okay.
that's all I came here to tell you. I have to go now.
you picked this cafe, so you're paying, right?
right.
good-bye.
Yes, Gwon Young-hoo speaking.
what are you doing? - I'm in the middle of dinner.
I'll return your call shortly.
Hi!
I like this place.
it's great, isn't it?
what will you have?
very, very cold beer.
practical Korean Conversation - Marco, who is she? - A photographer.
is she your girlfriend? - No.
have you done some modeling?
people liked your pictures.
so I got some calls.
that's great.
are you all right?
I'm okay. I've been busy.
sorry.
Gwon Young-hoo
when are you going back home?
I'll be here until the end of next semester.
Jeong-wan, why don't you put this on?
I'll take a picture of you.
it's a digital camera.
my dad's present when I came here.
it's a good one.
where the hell were you?
why'd you turn off your phone?
my feet are numb.
why aren't you home at this hour?
feeling down again?
what is it this time? You ran away?
you met that married guy, didn't you?
Oh, yeah!
he looks fantastic as always.
the perfect type to turn you on.
you know that our friendship is bound by our different tastes in men, right?
here.
what's this? Don't you have anything else?
don't be picky, or just be naked.
you have terrible manners for a woman.
and it's the same even when you're alone here.
I'm wearing this!
what?
Hey! That's expensive!
be nice to your clothes.
I'll wear it beautifully.
how come you have that?
I guy at work recommended it since I told him I'd never seen one.
but I felt weird watching it alone.
Yeah, you'd look pathetic.
don't ever watch it alone.
wow, that's huge.
that's why it's worth watching.
I bet that's a great exercise.
three times a week makes up for any exercise.
Really?
so no need to spend a lot of money and time at the fitness club?
that's not a bad idea.
sure, he can cheat on me.
a man who never cheats on his wife isn't normal.
I can understand it all.
but why pick an uglier and duller girl than me?
was she that bad?
there's nothing special about her except for her age!
Oh, no.
and she didn't cry for his love nor beg me to let her have him.
she said it was the other way around and she felt pity.
damn it, because he kept asking.
Hee-su!
Hee-su, wake up. Hyung-shik's here.
tell him I'm not here.
I already told him you're here. - Just tell him I'm dead!
go now!
I'm sorry.
I made a big mistake.
please forgive me.
honey. - Yes?
what about a divorce?
Hee-su!
you know why I'm mad?
lt'll never happen again.
I already ended things with her.
I'm not that narrow-minded.
I'm not mad at you for seeing her.
I was wrong.
hearing her making you into a fool...
made me regret marrying you.
do you understand?
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
let's go home, okay?
let's end it.
I'll do whatever you want, so please don't say that.
are you really going to divorce him?
divorce? What's divorce?
so pathetic.
me?
your husband.
just close the door on our way out.
I'm going to stay for a while.
no, I'm bringing over the married man.
Yeah! Bring him! I'll make something delicious.
let me see him.
go home.
an affair isn't love... It's just an affair.
go today.
how many? - Four and a half.
Gi-ho, change the models. - Okay.
sorry, will you forgive me?
I'm doing well, so don't worry.
okay.
I'm working right now. I'll call you back.
who is it?
my mom.
you talk to your mom like that?
my friend is staying at my place.
her husband cheated on her with a young girl.
can we turn things back like they were?
do you think we can be just friends?
we are.
friends who have sex?
what did you want from me in the beginning?
conversation? Sex? Or an exit?
it could be all three. Or none of them.
let's end things here. No hard feelings.
Gwon Young-hoo
hurry up! Stop pretending to work.
what is that?
hurry and slice it.
Jeong-wan, have some cake.
Thanks, I'll have some later.
who is she? She's so pretty.
the owner of this building.
Gwon Young-hoo?
his wife. Her skin looked perfect.
I envy Mr. Gwon.
I bet she spent a lot on herself.
her whole outfit is Chanel. She must be a Chanel maniac.
Yeah, they looked so expensive.
I'll buy you one. - No, thanks.
I'll buy you a small wallet.
even small wallets are expensive.
what about a key-holder? A key-holder isn't bad.
just buy us dinner.
Yeah, that's better.
Bye, everyone.
good-bye. - Thanks for the cake.
Yeah.
why don't you buy a car?
how could you work without a car?
why don't you get a license?
forget it. I'd rather find another guy.
Hey, you got a call.
is his name Gwon Young-hoo?
don't answer it.
you answered it? - I just hung up.
did he hear me? - What?
not to answer the phone. - Probably.
Hey!
you drive me crazy!
he couldn't hear anything. I hung up really fast.
five seconds is plenty!
shall I cut my hair like this and get a perm?
how many times did I tell you?
look beautiful all the time, darn it.
she's probably running away from home, too.
if she knew what you'd looked like.
this is a man's job.
are you human?
how could a woman open a wine bottle? I've never seen anyone like you.
most women can do this, you know.
spending time like this makes me feel like I'm single again.
might as well have fun while I can. Don't you think?
of course I do, 'Party Girl'.
I hope you go back home soon, and my personal life is in one piece.
Cheers!
a glass of wine a day slows the skin from aging.
does Botox really make you younger?
it's not good for you. It'll make our skin droop.
like Michael Jackson?
the only thing she has over me is her young skin.
let's start drinking a glass of wine everyday from today.
it still won't make you look ten years younger.
Hey!
frankly, I was shocked when you told me that you'd marry Hyung-shik.
he wasn't your type at all.
you had either matured.
or he was super rich.
one of them was the answer.
he wasn't super rich, but well off.
but most of all, his old-looking face made me feel secure.
I thought he'd be faithful to me.
he's a really nice man.
right! That's why I'm so shocked!
by the way, how much is Chanel?
was she wearing Chanel?
from her hair to her toes.
she must be very arrogant.
she could divorce him, because of your fashion.
Why?
I know so well what she's feeling right now.
what about me?
nothing.
come on. - No, it could hurt you again.
what?
I can't understand why men betray their pretty wives for ugly women.
I think you better go home before Hyung-shik gives you up.
I'm much much better at dealing with men than you.
so don't worry.
this is my team leader, Seo Jeong-wan.
lee Sun-young, reporter from Bazaar.
I think we met a few times before. I'm Lee Sun-young.
hello.
she's writing about up-and-coming talent, and wants to put you in fashion photos.
excuse me.
I'm leaving now. I'll pick up my stuff later.
it would be my honor.
is that you, honey?
hello.
honey!
Hee-su!
honey, don't get me wrong. We were just eating dinner.
can I ask you a question?
do you love this man?
I told you that he's the one who loves me.
you can have him.
what?
I don't need him any more, so I'll give him to you.
honey, she's saying that nothing's going on.
I visited the llsan construction site, and it suddenly rained.
I don't need him, either. - See? It's nothing.
there's nothing to worry about.
you're a fool, aren't you? - Yes... what?
do you think I'd want you even if she doesn't need you?
who do you think I am? - Hee-su.
okay, the decision has been made.
I'll send the divorce papers later.
this isn't because of you, so don't be too happy.
honey!
forget it.
I thought I had made a wrong choice picking you.
but it was you who had made the wrong choice.
I'm a woman beyond your control.
so find a woman on your level and let me go.
Hi!
the boss is inside.
going home? - Yes.
did Han-na leave on time again?
probably. She's so in love.
aren't you answering?
Hello?
can I see you for a minute?
I'm busy.
when will you be done?
I'm busy.
okay, then I guess not.
okay, bye.
what shall we eat today?
how about barbeque pork?
sounds great! Are you treating?
of course.
now it's her turn to be photographed.
okay! It's my treat!
it's me.
where are you?
Yes.
it wasn't a yes or no question.
you must be drunk.
I want to have sex.
what?
I want to have sex with you.
do you like having sex with me?
Yes, I do.
Why?
because you drive me crazy.
I thought you said you were leaving.
what's with you?
what do you mean?
why'd you turn off your phone? I called you hundreds of times.
the battery's out.
Hey, your hair looks great.
pasta?

Ouch!

what are you getting mad for?
I was just saying what's there.
you'll get dumped by him, very miserably.
you're really funny.
who's the one who told me dating a married man is fun?
and now you're blaming me for it?
bitches dating married men are the stupidest in the world.
how come they eat what others dropped on the floor?
Yoon Hee-su!
watch your mouth!
what the hell's wrong with you today?
he'll never get divorced.
he's just playing with you.
I'm okay.

then pixeIize your Iook.
then ask Fanny if she knew who it was.

I'm actuaIIy quite oId fashioned.
I Iike having a man waIk on the beach with me.
where do you go when you dated your ex?
nowhere, just somewhere dark to have sex,
lots of groping and humping.
and then, Tess discovered the hidden champagne bottIe from her fan.
Ouch! What the fuck?
Tess is so moved.

OK, Ieave them, shoot me instead.
OK, after they enjoyed their bottIe of champagne.

the Iucky reader finaIIy gets to enter the room we prepared for him and Tess TickIes.
we hid over a hundred condoms near the bed.
our guessing game for this issue is:
how many condoms wiII our Iucky reader use up?
the answer wiII be reveaIed on the next issue.
wanna pIay paper, rock, scissors?
get in there!
OK, as to what happens after they entered the room onIy heaven knows

I'm fine with it.
remember, you are the Iucky reader tonight.
everything in that room is yours.

I thought it was aII an act?
if you want to Ieave now, you can go.
if you want me to stop, just say so.
Lower...Iower.
no...
Lower...no in the middIe.
perfect!
MiddIe, perfect.
I did not know that my entire body couId turn into a sex organ.
what?
I think I've gone mad.
I'm tired, can you hoId me whiIe I sIeep?
aren't you tired watching these discs.
wait...
why is that guy's face pixeIized?
we have to protect readers' identities.
then again.
he Iooks Iike you.
like me? No way, I've seen him.
seriousiy, his body size is the same as yours.
look at that nose!
it's the same!
you can see that through the pixeIs?
Yes, just do it Iike this.
squint Iike that and you'II see it.
yeah? Isn't it?
I'm suddenIy feeIing something. - What?
I have an urge.
teII me, doesn't he Iook Iike you?
HeIIo?
I'm Fanny, you asIeep?
BareIy, sorry.
I have something to teII you.
wait!
what is it?
nothing reaIIy.
I'm not sure if I'm a IittIe paranoid.
I feIt Iike since John started the magazine.
he's been very different.
different Iike how?
weII, it's Iike this...
I can't stand it...
where did you Iearn what you just did?
I...just experimented on the stuff I write about.
experimenting? FeIt more Iike you've practiced.
ReaIIy?
weII, Iet's try that one more time.
he insists that he's never tried it with others.
how am I supposed to beIieve that.
you're being paranoid, doesn't do any good to anyone.
I know, but I can't heIp it.
now every time we do it.
I just can't get myseIf into the mood.
paying too much attention on his " moves " .
see how different it is with before.
I'm going crazy!
weII, how about you and Andy?
aren't you worried?
if there is anything fishy, no use worrying over it.
mind teIIing us if you've ever crossed the Iine?
you mean to induIge in that IifestyIe?
off the record, I won't write about it.
just pureIy out of interest.
I'd be Iying if I said we never did.
I'm not a saint, can't fight temptation.
besides saints don't pubIish porn magazines.
they write bibIes and hoIy books.
I'd Iike to use your toiIet for a second?
I'm bursting.
who are you?
I'II teII you in a bit, thanks.
here's your money back, aIso I'd Iike to buy your fIat.
it's ours, you shouIdn't have to do this?
I just want to prove that I can take care of you.
I bought your favorite dish home for dinner.
who screwed up this contract?
even has drawings...
Where's John?
I've toId you maybe a biIIion times before,
don't use this coIor for the cover!
are you deaf?
toId you not to write about Fantasy of The Spooky Kind.
we're a porn pubIication.
we're not X-fiIes.
stop fooIing around.
it has nothing to do with our magazine.
I know Pam Ieft you.
what did you say about Pam?
stop right there!
fuck you!
stop!
you said something about PameIa, right?
you've turned your girIfriend into a paranoid,
why did you have to bring me down?
now my girIfriend's gone!
you're bIaming me?
teII me...
what now?
why are you being quiet?
fine.
say it, come on.
stay out of this!
say it!
you reaIIy want to hear?
why am I aIways pIaying second fiddIe to you?
who started you on Fat Dragon & Boney Jones?
your deputy?
we started Passion Magazine as partners.
you're the pubIisher and I'm the deputy.
up yours, your deputy?
you've never said you wanted to be the pubIisher.
I'm too nice and educated for that.
Oh reaIIy, since you're too nice and educated then quit writing about pornography.
why care about becoming a pubIisher?
you're too nice to be even the deputy.
since you're that educated.
why do you fooI around with a masseuse?
what did you say?
I quit, you do this on your own.
honestIy speaking, I've aIways Iiked you.
you may not know this.
Andy's aII taIk.
he's noting without you supporting him.
passion Magazine was your idea, I knew that.
he can say whatever he wants outside.
you don't have to care about that.
I feeI so bad for you.
sorry for being very frank.
I've predicted you two to go separate ways earIy on.
I've pubIished fortune teIIing books.
you asked to meet me to bash my ex partner.
not reaIIy, I don't have that much free time.
John, you're a smart kid.
you shouId know I want to be in business with you again.
you shouId have no doubt about my passion for pubIishing.
I'm sure if you start your own porn magazine.
you can beat Passion Magazine easiIy.
there's an oId Chinese Saying,
friendships thrive on hard times, not in good times.
do you agree with that?
ever regretted starting a porn magazine?
from the moment we set out to do this.
I've never regretted it.
how much have you Iost since you started this?
never counted my Iosses, and not starting now either.
but Iet me teII you,
you must have a bottom Iine in everything you do.
bottom Line?
you have bottom Iine in porn pubIications as weII?
let me teII you, anything you do you have to set a bottom Iine for yourseIf.
sometimes the onIy thing that can save your ass......is this bottom Iine.
boss, is that a new magazine?
Yup, just arrived.
I'II buy this one, thanks.
the rivaIs meet!
do we stiII want to bathe then?
CertainIy? Why the heII not?
you guys haven't spoken in a whiIe, go ahead.
come over here.
you two have a thing against each other.
why don't you fight over it?
fight over it.
what the fuck do you want?
what the fuck do you want?
punch him!
looks Iike we have a winner.
that fast? Hard to beIieve?
didn't think you'd fight this weII.
when you have the time, try it on me.
has he thrown a temper tantrum yet today?
Andy, I've quit my day job as a TV reporter.
I've decided to go to the US to study TheoIogy.
we formed this partnership not onIy to make money,
but aIso to have fun.
I feeI this magazine is a runaway train.
we've had fun working with each other.
utteriy immoraI.
do you beIieve in karma?
do you understand?
I'm Ieaving.
why are you stiII here?
Cindy, can you pIace an order for a Pizza for just you and me.
he's Ieaving soon.
leave.
just go!
get out of here!
what do you want?
I said to order a pizza, don't you want to eat?
if you don't, I do.
the ones I need are gone, onIy the useIess stayed
what do you want?
I'II give you back your share.
don't go Idiot
don't Ieave...I don't have any friends anymore.
pIease don't go!
I'm begging you!
you two were the best of friends,
he shouId know you didn't mean to punch him.
I didn't think it wouId come to this.
just teII him that you're sorry.
this time it's aII over.
at Ieast it was good coming to see you,
I know why men Iook for hookers.
there are certain thing...
that men can't resoIve with their own women.
Thanks.
I just upped my price again.
how much?
we're friends, forget about these.
I charge you the oId price.
keep it.
why did you have to jazz up this pIace Iike this?
you're just a soIo hooker.
I did spend over a miIIion bucks refurbishing.
you toId me to work hard, remember?
you know, I reaIIy am Hong Kong's most popuIar soIo hooker now.
I'm doing very weII!e
just the other day, 2 tv station interviewed me even.
I have something for you, hang on.
I bought this from an oId guy for HK$ 3,000.
Thanks.
we're friends, remember?
have you seen my teIephone biII?
what?
phone biII.
never saw it, Iook for it yourseIf.
is it beside the computer?
found it yet?
why did you stick with Kiki?
your girIfriend PameIa was reaIIy good,
why didn't you attempt to win her back?
I'm not sure I know why.
maybe she was just too good for me.
I don't understand, can you eIaborate?
she was too good for me, I'm a man.
when I'm with her.
I feeI...
I mean, I'd reaIIy want to have a woman I can rescue.
or maybe a not so normaI woman.
FrankIy speaking, I didn't understand that.
but I'II write it down.
sometimes it's reaIIy strange.
you know quite weII who you Iove,
but you choose to Iet her go against your wishes.
I'm not sure I know how to say it.
the poIice started what they caIIed Operation： Fire LiIy.
sweeping through over a hundred prostitution dens,
ForcibIy cIosing down severaI porn magazines,
and arresting severaI pubIishers and editors-in-chief.
the officer in charge is SP Cheung,
he cIaims this operation wiII be stepped up.
John just got arrested!
where are you going?
back to the office.
for what?
so they can come arrest me?
the poIice have combed through night cIubs, moteIs and massage parIors.
among the arrested are iIIegaI immigrants and to date more than 120 individuaIs have been brought in for investigation.
everyone Ieave, the cops wiII be here any minute.
I'm not joking.
just go now!
how can I Ieave you Iike this?
we're partners.
if I get arrested, I'II need you to post baiI for me.
Thanks.
who's in charge here?
I am.
I have coIIected twenty stamps, can I exchange for the gift?
wait there.
here's an eIectric diIdo,
I just puIIed it out from my ass,
it's yours if you want it.
there are tons of magazines here, you can take them too.
this entire office is yours if you want it 20 stamps!
sp Cheung, I'm Andy.
if you want to arrest me, get it over with.
who said anything about arresting you?
you cIosed down every other magazine, why not mine?
because you have a higher bottom Iine, kid,
you never took bribes.
if you did, the accounting books from the night spots wiII show.
in other words, under the tabIe transactions.
John never takes these kinds of payments.
not sure if he ever did,
but his name was in the books.
maybe someone took it for him.
he's the magazine's pubIisher editor-in-chief and chief writer.
of course they arrested him and not me.
those weren't bribes, they were advertising fees.
nothing is free in this worId.
doesn't mean you've got high moraI standards if you don't take,
just means you're stupid!
what?
what proof have you got that I took the money?
the money was deposited under the Lust Magazine account.
John's got no choice but to take this hit.
teII him to wise up in his next Iife!
Andy, you're a much smarter person,
I actuaIIy Iike you better.
I have a new idea for us to work together.
it's a brand new idea, for reaI!
let's work together.
what? Think I'm scared of you?
mano o mano!

Nicolas·Cage
julianne Moore
Jessica Biel
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the man who knows what you're going to do before you do it.
the amazing Frank Cadillac!
here's to world peace.
good evening. Welcome to beautiful downtown Las Vegas.
how many people are here from the Orient? Raise your hands.
you, sir. Where are you from?
no, wait! Wait. Don't tell me.
I'm sensing you must have soul.
you're a Seoul man.
why don't you share with everyone where you're from?
korea. - How about that, folks?
and may I assume that this charming young lady is your daughter?
she's my wife! - Well, of course she is!
and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
what's your name? - Yong Kyunge.
yong Kyunge.
would you be kind enough to join me up on stage, please?
are you serious about this guy? This a joke?
want me to round up some mimes and clowns while we're at it?
yong Kyunge, what if I told you that that pretty necklace you're wearing has a broken catch, and on my count of three, will fall into your drink?
would that be something? Would that just blow your mind?
Yeah. - Yes!
would it blow all your minds?
three, two, one, now.
did somebody say "spooky"?
wait a minute. Look at your glass. Where'd it go?
yong Kyunge, why don't you look inside my pocket?
reach in. Dig deep.
let's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge.
that's magic, folks, and that's why I'm here.
you've probably seen a lot of those shows.
Mentalists. Magicians. Illusionists.
you'd be shocked to know that sometimes, not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal.
masquerading as an act.
hiding behind a few $50 tricks.
hiding in plain sight.
because if the magician doesn't do that, the alternative is impossible for others to live with.
anyway, Wednesday night at the Back Page doesn't pay very well, so I gamble.
but I don't play against other people. Only against the house.
so, no mega-jackpots, no long shots.
the idea is to go unnoticed.
that way, I can keep coming back.
I'm not a god.
I can't see everyone's future.
only my own.
and only within two minutes.
except for when I saw her.
but we'll come back to that.
there's no pattern to this guy. He's all over the map.
well, he's not counting. Not off the top of a five-deck shoe.
wait a minute.
isn't that that two-bit magic act over at the Back Page?
what's his name? - Cadillac.
Yeah, that's Frank Cadillac.
is he pulling tricks on us? Is that legal?
you can't trick the deck.
I'm telling you, that little prick knows what's coming.
if he's running that good a system, why is he not betting more?
that's going to be my second question.
look at that. He's looking right at us.
it's like he can hear us.
what table was that? - 27.
this is Roybal. Give me two men on table 27. I'm coming right down.
place your bets, please.
here's the thing about the future.
every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it.
Hi. - And that changes everything else.
﹩9070
empty the drawer. Move!
drop the gun! Now!
﹩9070
drop the gun! Step back!
it's his gun. He was going to shoot two people!
step back. We'll settle this right now.
what's he doing?
secure the doors, elevators, escalators, every way out of this damn place! Now!
freeman, seal off the blackjack tables. Sullivan, link up with Roybal.
we're on the floor. On the floor right now.
bring up the other cameras.
that way. This way.
he's right next to you. $10 slots, aisle 14.
there he is! Behind you! Your left! Turn around!
he's right between you!
he's in the mens room near the gift shop. Gift shop! Gift shop!
Davis, where the hell is he?
black T-shirt, straw hat! Heading towards the entrance!
come on, let's go.
call Vegas P. D.
just stole a silver charger, tag 585G4S.
drop the gun! Step back.
he rose to the top of our gambling fraud wish list about two months ago.
what he does has nothing to do with luck. It's definable ability.
look at him. He knows exactly what to do and not be caught.
can you explain that to me?
no, I can't explain it, Callie, nor do I have the time.
the Russian Federation has a 10-kiloton nuclear munition - unaccounted for. - I understand that.
I'm not sure you do. We need every agent available beating the street.
that bomb was stolen five weeks ago. We've just been informed of it now.
which means it could be parked under this truck for all we know.
I need actionable intelligence, not paranormals and bullshit magicians.
with all due respect, sir, this bullshit magiciars shown a pattern of advanced awareness that is statistically impossible.
you let me bring him in and you'll get what you want.
five days, Callie. That's it.
get me the head of casino security.
you Roybal? - It's Roybal.
whatever.
who are you? - Cavanaugh. Take a walk.
Hey, Roybal, this isn't a pissing contest. Come on.
What'd you do? You got a new car? - Stole it.
look at this.
twenty minutes to walk 20 steps.
well, that's what you get from two packs a day.
Oh, hey.
I got you two sandwiches. - Two sandwiches?
that's 20 grand. - Take it. I love you.
Oh, jeez.
how can I repay you?
must be a bitch to park this thing.
chief Roybal. Special Agent Ferris.
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh has explained to you that everything you say is admissible in court and anything you knowingly admit can be used against you.
do we understand each other?
sure.
tell me about Cris Johnson. - I don't know who that is.
how about Frank Cadillac?
you chased him out of your casino tonight.
he stole a car from valet parking. - Yeah, I know Cadillac.
I thought he was cheating us at cards.
next thing I know, he's tackling some guy and waving a gun.
the gun wasn't his.
the man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings in Reno.
he's in custody now.
come on, I want to show you something.
you remember this?
Oh, yeah, of course I do. We were saying he's looking right at us.
how'd you get this? - Think carefully.
what were you talking about right when he looked up?
we were saying, if he has a system, why isn't he betting more?
you sure you weren't doing or saying anything else?
I was going down to pick him up, I was reaching for my radio...
and right then? That's when he looked up? Be very specific.
that's what I said.
he looked up, really.
so he doesn't have to be there to do it.
once you enter his consciousness, he can pick it up.
is that to work his system?
thank you. We're finished.
done some good here, Mr. Roybal, but none of it is up for discussion.
now, as far as you're concerned, Cris Johnson never existed.
that's going to be difficult considering 100 cameras saw him at the casino.
not to worry. Those tapes have been destroyed.
Hey. Is she single?
cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you.
that's not a life.
but you got to forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head.
I'm not going anywhere until I meet her.
well, suppose she don't show up?
she already did, at the diner. 8: 09.
well, you got a couple hours. How about a game of pool?
all right, Irv.
we'll shoot some pool.
we timed every hand of blackjack.
the longest was 89 seconds, when Johnson pulled a six-card 21.
so we know he can see at least a minute and a half ahead.
I had our techs run a radio frequency spectrum analysis.
came up dry, so he's not receiving any form of electronic help.
at one point, there was a two-minute, 16-second delay.
he never bet, just got up and walked away.
well, maybe 2: 16's too long. He can't see that far.
narrows our window a little bit, anyway.
got him. Vegas P. D. Got a LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle.
okay.
listen, about that girl.
when you looked at the clock, did you happen to see a calendar?
because it could be 10 years from now she gets hungry.
it's got to be soon.
I've never seen further ahead than two minutes.
except for her.
now, what do you think the reason is for that?
I don't know. Maybe she doesn't scare easy.
maybe she's the one.
well, when you get like this there's no talking to you.
she's almost here.
what happened to the diner?
somebody else, a cop. - A cop? Well, then, you got to go.
hold on. I want to see how much she knows. What she wants from me.
where else would I be?
special Agent Ferris.
next time, steal a car without LoJack.
can we speak privately?
it's okay, Irv.
go ahead. Thanks.
I'm sure you know why I'm here.
because you're the man who knows what I'm going to do before I do it, right?
Oh, the show, right. Right!
I saw you there.
wonderful. You like magic tricks.
Yeah, yeah, I do like your magic tricks, clairvoyance...
whatever you're calling it.
let's talk about something hard.
a stolen nuclear munition is being smuggled into the United States, or may, in fact, already be here.
I want you to look ahead and tell me where it's going to be deployed.
I think you've got the wrong guy. It's a magic act.
you going to stick with that story?
because millions of lives are at risk and you could, maybe, prevent a major catastrophe.
on a practical note, we're standing in front of a stolen vehicle and you are wanted for assault involving a weapon at the casino.
all right, that was an accident. He had a gun.
he was going to shoot two people. - Yeah?
how'd you know that?
no good deed goes unpunished, does it?
I can fix your legal problems, buddy, but you've got to step up.
otherwise, your next magic show is going to be at Folsom State Prison.
it's ironic, but people like you who try to help have been torturing me, in the full sense of the word, since I was three years old.
what did they call it?
Oh, yeah.
observed play therapy.
featuring the marathon, 36-hour, can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card game.
so, please, leave me alone and let me live some semblance of a normal life.
I'd love to indulge your feelings, but I am dealing with a slightly larger picture right now.
now, you can exercise your responsibility to help your fellow man or I will exercise that responsibility for you.
you're right. I got to go.
he's gone, right?
I missed him by seconds, didn't I?
excuse me, honey, can you get off my car?
Yeah, thank you. Jeez.
Mr. Roybal? - It's Roybal. Can I help you, man?
I have a few questions if this is a good time.
gaming Commission? It's after hours.
you guys should be at a strip club, right? Come on.
what can you tell us about Cris ·Johnson?
I don't know who you're talking about.
let me rephrase the question.
it's destiny.
here you go, Hon. - Thanks.
excuse me.
hello.
I noticed you were alone, too. Do you mind if I join you?
actually, I do.
sorry to bother you, but I have a question about the coffee.
the bean they use...
isn't that something you should probably ask your waitress?
Yes, it is.
excuse me, do you have a light?
I don't smoke.
here you go, Hon. - Thanks.
please.
don't.
Hey, Liz.
did you follow me here, Kendall?
No! No, I just thought we could talk.
you know, we got really nothing to talk about.
and I told you that three weeks ago.
Liz, come on, all right? I had an off day. Just give me another shot.
it's not gonna happen. Okay? So maybe you should just go.
do you know how hard it was to find you?
I was at your apartment. I tried the Starbucks on Lexington.
I was at the dry cleaner. All I am asking for is a few minutes of your time so that we can work things out.
okay, Jesus, you are stalking me now. - Don't!
don't say that, please. That's a terrible thing to say to somebody.
let go of me, Kendall.
look, I just... I thought we could talk, maybe we could take a drive.
and now you are ruining it.
you're hurting me.
Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
who the hell are you? - I'm her future.
Really?
Hi, my name's Cris.
you okay, Kendall?
see, the thing is, I feel connected to you. I don't know the reason why.
see, now, listen. - All right.
I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast.
what are you having? Pecan pie is amazing.
excuse me, I can pay for my own breakfast.
and you know what?
you two work things out.
okay.
you're hurting me.
Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
who the hell are you? - I'm her future.
Really?
incoming.
did you see that?
goddamn it! Kendall!
what? Don't blame me. This is your fault.
get out of here! Will somebody please call the cops?
are you okay? Let me help you.
come on, let's get you cleaned up.
come on.
okay.
Oh, yeah, I'm seeing some stars.
Yeah.
I'm Liz.
cris.
you must have a death wish getting involved in that.
here. Just...
okay. - Just...
okay, hold it there for a little bit.
okay. - Yeah.
it will.
what will? - Your luck. It's going to change.
what are you? A leprechaun?
do leprechauns get punched in the face or have their car stolen?
your car was stolen?
Yeah. I'm hoping they find it today.
I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff.
Hey, is this tooth loose here?
I don't know. I don't think so.
hurts.
well, listen, maybe I could give you a ride, and I'm kind of going that way.
that would really be helpful, Liz. Thank you.
well, I do have to make a stop, though.
it's okay.
and it might take a few hours, so if you're cool with that.
Hey, look, if you're uncomfortable with this, - I'll take the bus. - No, no, no.
it's fine, it's fine. You're not a psycho.
right?
because the first psycho vibe I get, you're out of the car.
okay. Yes, ma'am. - Okay.
deal.
deal.
it's amazing, isn't it?
I end up in a diner where you are, and we're both headed in the same direction.
I don't know if I would call it amazing, but...
destiny.
that's what it really is.
okay, I'm starting to get that psycho vibe.
Oh no. You don't believe in destiny?
well, even if it does exist,
I don't think I want to know.
I mean, if every move we make is preordained, then what is the point of that?
I mean, life is supposed to be a surprise.
isn't it?
it would be nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
so he came in twice a day for a week at exactly 8: 09?
Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes, have a Martini, and then he'd go.
till today, when he met that lady.
you didn't find anything strange about that?
not strange enough to call the police.
we got a regular that counts the corn flakes in his bowl because it has to be an even number.
got any cameras?
inside? No.
outside?
no.
did you notice what kind of car he was driving?
maybe overhear where they were going?
I don't know what car, but they were headed up to Flagstaff.
Flagstaff. - That's what they said.
got another regular, she's always on a diet.
brings in a scale and her own salad dressing.
thank you. - You're welcome.
guy knows we're after him, but he still risks coming here.
8: 09, twice a day. - Doesrt even know if it's day or night.
just the time. He was waiting for her.
all right, there's a traffic cam over there, a bank, a 7-Eleven across the street.
just run all the tapes. Maybe we'll get lucky and catch him in wide.
your buddy Roybal, the casino chief?
had his throat cut last night after getting a kneecap shot off.
you're telling me this now? We just talked to him about Johnson.
Hey, I just found out. - All right.
local weapon? - Dead end.
and forensics came up empty. Not a hair, not a fiber.
somebody wants information.
now, the next time anything happens relative to Johnson,
I want to know right away.
I don't care if it's a paper cut.
okay, boss.
that's good! Good. Right there!
the head of casino security, what did you learn from him?
for a macho guy, he screams like a girl.
but he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson, yes?
he said they haven't found him yet.
do you believe this shit?
he can see things before they happen?
it makes no difference what I believe.
look, we spent two years setting this up and that man out there is worried all this will be compromised by Johnson.
we're wasting our time looking for some magician.
we're being paid to secure the operation, Jones, not to hunt down some carnival barker.
Really? Then why are the same authorities that are looking for us so interested in him?
get rid of him.
do it now.
Hey.
Havasupai Reservation. I teach here once a week.
the conditions are pretty lousy.
but it's in the Canyon, one of the Eight Wonders of the World.
Hey, Sam. - Hey, Liz.
well, a couple hundred years ago, this tribe was booming.
plenty of food and a thriving culture. They should be better off.
but I guess this was just their destiny.
I'd like to meet their shaman.
I read once that in many North American tribes their shamars purpose wasrt only healing but they also claimed to have power over the atmosphere.
to bring on or stop rain.
even know future events.
do you think that's possible?
do you think that's possible?
well, I believe anything is possible.
me, too.
whose birthday? - One of my students'.
Hey! Hi!
how's it going?
Hello! How is everybody? Good?
that's good. - Oh, I was close.
that was a lot. You messed up on the last part.
on the last part. Yeah.
I thought you werert coming back until next Monday.
well, I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday. How could I miss that?
who's that man you're with?
is he your boyfriend?
no, no, he's not my boyfriend. He's just my friend.
I think he likes you.
well, why would you say that?
because he looked at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend.
Hey, Jake, you want to see some magic?
I'll show you something. Come here.
I found this rock out in the Canyon and I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock.
that's right. Hold it really tight. Keep squeezing.
it's magic.
he won't bite.
happy birthday.
so, you're a magician?
well...
I have a small magic act back in Vegas.
the Frank Cadillac Show.
I thought your name was Cris. - It is.
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.
how did you come up with that?
I picked two things I really liked and I put them together.
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.
you are odd.
charming, but odd.
cease fire! Visitor on the range!
nice.
a little close, though.
okay.
you were right about the traffic cam. We got a positive ID.
I'm sorry.
don't be.
it's okay.
did I drool?
drool? - Yeah.
drool? No.
Oh, my God, it's coming down so hard.
Yeah.
I like rain.
I like rain, too.
you know, once, I think it was in Denmark, it rained fish.
because the sun dehydrated the water and took it up into the atmosphere, rehydrated the fish eggs and they hatched and it rained fish.
is that true?
Yeah, in the clouds. True story. It happened 50 years ago.
I just felt like sharing that with you.
road's washed out ahead. You can't cross till morning.
not even then if this keeps up.
you want to spin around and go back about two miles, take your second left. There'll be a motel there called...
the Cliffhanger." Thanks.
right.
him, right?
that's it?
there's no front plate. Where's the other side?
I don't have it.
what was that on the front window? Go back.
back, back.
back. There! Zoom in.
that's a permit.
track it and find her.
I'll light a fire.
cris, one little problem.
Oh, no, no, I'm going to sleep in the car.
okay.
here.
Thanks. - Sure.
Hey, did you hear the joke about the Zen master who ordered the hot dog?
no.
he said he'd have one with everything.
good night.
good night.
what do we have?
they're at the Cliffhanger Motel outside Flagstaff.
we found an Arizona DOT foreman who remembered the Land Cruiser.
why would he do that?
the road was flooded. He was about to suggest a place to stay.
but Johnson already knew. Right?
exactly.
Callie. It just got worse.
all right, people, we've got a nuclear alert.
code Red, in the Southern California region. L. A. To San Diego.
95% certainty.
nuclear emergency search teams are on the way, but until they get here, can somebody please tell me what my agency, the FBI, is doing about it?
sir, tier-one suspects have been interrogated.
cars and premises have been checked, friends and acquaintances.
we've opened up surveillance on tier-two and three suspects, but nothing actionable yet.
Oh, is that what we're doing, waiting for something actionable?
there are eight million lives that are precarious at best.
I say we widen the net to "slightly suspiciousand get some decent intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.
all right, Callie.
what do you propose we do next?
I believe that the urgency of this situation compels the use of any and all resources to obtain Cris Johnson.
we know where he is. Let my team pick him up.
he said they're mobilizing.
standard procedure when security is escalated.
tell him to wrap it up.
they'll lead us straight to Johnson.
you hungry? There's a coffee shop down the road.
I'd rather eat here, if that's okay.
sure.
what?
there's an Italian painter named Carlotti, and he defined beauty.
he said it was the summation of the parts working together in such a way that nothing needed to be added, taken away or altered.
that's you.
you're beautiful.
Wow.
that was incredible.
what was?
this.
right here gives us a good standoff position and open view of the front of the motel.
we can run multiple point and area surveillances from this road here, that turn out.
get a team with a parabolic set right here.
that's fine, but I also want mobile surveillance.
and give me two or three roamers.
if he rabbits on us, I want to be flexible.
Ferris.
call the local police in Flagstaff.
tell them to hold the outside perimeter.
I want that area locked down.
a body turned up in an apartment with a line of sight to my office.
slit throat, like Roybal.
somebody's trying to follow us to Johnson.
cris.
Yeah.
maybe there is such a thing as destiny.
give it 40 seconds.
so, after two minutes, he just stops seeing what's going to happen?
I sure as hell hope so.
Elizabeth Cooper?
Yeah. - Federal Agent Ferris.
what is this about?
I'm going to need a few minutes of your time.
Yeah, okay.
they're putting her in the car.
drop the gun! Step back.
it's his gun. He was going to shoot two people!
this was three days ago?
he used you to get away from us in Vegas.
you can be pretty sure that everything he told you is a lie.
he's delusional. A sociopath.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
go back to the motel.
have a drink. Put one of these in his glass.
it'll take five minutes to put him to sleep.
then we'll come in and get him.
nobody's been hurt.
but this is important.
you need to do it at least two minutes after you get him out of the room.
why do you need me? Why can't you just get him?
Liz, as I understand it, you work for a federally funded program teaching on various reservations. Is that true?
Yes, that's true.
well, I'd think you'd be eager to help us.
we're on the same team.
now they're letting her go.
Hey.
Hey.
thanks for the note.
sure.
did you have a nice walk? - I did.
you know, it's really beautiful here.
I have a present for you.
Oh, thanks.
I need that. - Yeah.
is something wrong?
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
why don't you go wash up and I'm gonna make us breakfast?
okay. - Okay.
45 seconds.
one minute, thirty.
and that's two.
looks good. - You think so?
thank you.
don't drink that!
it's drugged.
Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
some federal agent came up to me and said that you were a delusional sociopath and showed me this tape.
so maybe you are.
but I don't want to believe that.
I don't think I can believe that.
and she also said that if you ran, they would shoot you.
so I should drug you instead.
even if what they said is true, I don't want you to die.
I don't want you to die.
cris, is it true?
Oh, shit.
get me broadband noise reduction. I don't like hearing this!
speak quietly and act normally.
how long did they say the drugs would take?
about five minutes.
what is he doing?
he's drinking. Give it a minute.
got a clean shot?
not yet.
the man in that casino would have killed two people.
it happened.
it just hadrt happened yet.
Oh, my God, you are delusional.

you can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods.
you can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods.
that's right, sir. You're the only person authorized to do so.
that's right, sir. You are the only person authorized to do so.
how are you doing this?
I have no idea how, but I can.
I was born with it.
is this some kind of a trick?
you know we don't have time for that.
you said anything was possible.
so, you see things before they happen?
you see the future?
my future. What'll affect me, and only two minutes ahead.
except you.
for some reason, I saw you.
for some reason, I saw you far beyond anything I'd ever seen before and I don't know why.
what do you mean, you saw me?
you've been...
you've been doing that to me?
you know what I'm going to do and what I'm going to say?
that you've just been setting me up?
no, I haven't.
I wanted to find you because I needed to know why I was seeing you.
and because I...
it wasrt a setup.
what do they want from you?
they think I can help them in matters of national security.
...call code is received.
the normal SSB radios in the aircraft...
I don't understand. If you can help, then why don't you?
because I can't.
I can only give them a two-minute head start.
and that's if my life is personally involved.
but with me, you can see further.
Yeah.
but they don't know that.
there's almost $10, 000 in this envelope.
they know about you. You need to get away from here.
what time do you have?
九点十分。
set your watch to 9: 17.
read this when I leave and wait exactly 45 seconds before you do what it says.
I'll take Ferris with me.
it might be a week or a month, but if you can wait, I'll find you.
...and yes, gentlemen, they are on their way and no one can bring them back.
something's wrong.
don't do it.
I already have.
go get him! Alive!
let's go!
bitch! Come on!
are you crazy?
Oh, shit!
watch out! Get down!
Johnson.
you know you're not going to shoot.
you going to let me die?
Hey, I need some help! Let's get him out of here!
let's get him out of here. - I got him.
you all right? You okay?
open your eyes. Look at me.
no good deed goes unpunished, does it?
she got him.
now what?
you see her?
smoke?
thanks for today.
could've let me die. I appreciate it.
that was a real show of character.
I know I seem like the bad guy in all this, but in the interests of preserving our freedom there are larger issues at play.
what about my freedom?
with freedom comes responsibility.
I have rights.
this isn't about you.
this is about eight million other people.
if I do what you want, you'll keep me in this chair forever.
there is a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.
and every television station in the world will broadcast the precise details of its detonation.
so, go on, push that two minutes as far as you can and find it.
the system, which is still just a tropical storm, is picking up steam and heading for the U. S.
experts fear this storm has a good chance of growing to an F3 status before making landfall.
more worrisome, though, is the strong possibility that it could travel through what is known as Hurricane Alley into the Gulf of Mexico.
the warm Gulf waters would cause the storm to intensify quickly.
evacuation plans are already in place...
...broadcast this afternoon for breaking news out of downtown Los Angeles.
...largest technology corporations oppose this idea, and tech lobbying is blamed for stalling the proposal...
...members of the LAPD bomb squad are staging in that area.
we go live now to reporter Lisa Joyner at the scene for the very latest. Lisa.
Jeff, the standoff began when police received an anonymous phone call stating that explosives would be detonated at this parking garage at 2nd and Broadway at 6: 00 tonight.
there's no... They have no idea on a motive.
the victim, however...
Liz, I'm sorry.
what?
what did you say?
the LAPD has surrounded the area. They've secured a perimeter.
but now the bomb squad is making their way onto the deck of this building.
and they're the men that are walking up with black suits on and such.
Oh, my God.
there's been... There's been an explosion.
there's been an explosion...
Oh, my God.
the victim has been identified as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas.
she was strapped to a wheelchair.
sorry.
approximately 10% of U. S. Workers receive stock options.
many technology companies give the options away...
tell me what just happened. - Yeah, I can't.
it won't work like this.
get me out of this room and I'll do what you want.
I beg you, please get me out of this room.
let him out!
callie! Callie, wait up. - What?
forensics report on Betty Peterson.
the dead girl in the apartment? Her throat was cut, bled out.
otherwise, nothing to DNA. The place was immaculate again.
how'd it go with Johnson?
well, something happened, but he's not sharing.
you know, there are traces of potassium iodide.
some medication Peterson was taking?
they found an empty pillbox. - No.
the only reason to take it is to prevent radiation poisoning.
Hey, wait, can I get a smoke or something? I need to relax.
Thanks.
Hey, can I get a light?
look at this. Look.
Ta-da!
get it up here! Let's go!
base, Air 1. Base, Air 1. I've got visual.

be advised, subject is turning east onto Broadway.
stay here. Let me deal with this.
why are you here?
they killed her.
two hours from now.
they killed Liz.
tell me what you saw.
I saw them execute her.
right there.
on the roof.
it hasn't happened yet and I know who has her.
it's the same people we're after.
there's a reason that they brought you here. They're using Liz as bait.
10-1 you go out on that roof, they're going to put a bullet in your brain.
I know.
right now, she's still alive.
she is, you are, we all are.
let's try to keep it that way.
I help you, you help me, all right?
I want a two-mile radius.
every telephone grid, shortwave, cell tower.
shut it down.
what do you want me to do?
let him shoot you.

check the number and dial again.
your call cannot be completed as dialed.
FBI! Down on your knees!
you okay? That looked pretty close.
sleight of hand.
you didn't get him. - Not alive. He fired on the chopper.
but it doesn't matter. He couldn't call in the hit.
so as far as they're concerned, you're not here yet.
it buys us time.
every way I try this, she still ends up dead.
what if you do it earlier?
they have to bring her here in a vehicle, right?
looking for a license plate. - Right.
can you see it?
it helps if you don't speak right now.

four minutes and 27 seconds.
do you mind? - Not anymore. Go ahead.
they've got her wrapped in explosives, wired to a cell phone.
remote trigger. Another cell phone sets it off.
usually a one-button speed dial.
they'll take this route to the entrance gate.
at that point, Alpha and Bravo will swarm the entrance...
if you could just be quiet and do exactly what I say,I'll save your life.
we need to stop the vehicle here before they get through the gates.
alpha and Bravo will hold and contain here.
sniper teams will initiate on Johnsors call.
on his call. Are we clear?
all elements shoot to kill any hostiles.
what about intel?
we don't need them. We have him.

...still utilize pay phones on a regular basis.

verizon has scheduled this structure to be torn down...
...and replaced with a kiosk as of 8 a. m. tomorrow.

well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?
one lousy mention in the Post, you expect to eat for six months? No!
Mario, maybe I could throw the hippest party this month your way.

what hip party? -It's just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.
there'll be local TV coverage... -Nine and 1 1.

you ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?
I don't think so.
gentleman occupying phone booth, 53rd, between Broadway and 8th.
it's a mistake.
what am I supposed to do with the pie? It's all paid for.
there's a homeless guy around the block.
give him the pizza and say "You can turn away, but you can't make it go away.
he'll think I'm trying to poison him. They always get that idea.
get off the fucking pizza, all right?
that language is uncalled for.
holy shit!
I'm sorry. Please return to sender.
fuck off.
here you go, $5. Eat the pizza yourself. You look like you could use a good meal.
hello.
Pam, could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza?
why are you always in the same phone booth, same time, every day?
well, it's quitting time, right? -Thank God, we were mobbed today.
so how's your day?
it's getting better by the minute, sweetheart.
who's the most famous person you publicized today?
you. -Really?
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson was looking for actresses for his film.
and I said the possibilities were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...
...and my favorite client, you.
you didn't really do that.
first step toward being noticed is being mentioned.
I just got out of a conference at the City Hotel.
I was thinking you could come down.
there are a couple of people and a few martinis I'd like to introduce you to.
Stu, l-- -Listen, Pam. Pam. Pam.
it's about time we talked about your career. Come on.
I feel awful but I promised my scene partner that I would rehearse for class.
we're doing a scene from Jerry Maguire. I'm playing Renee Zellweger's part.
that's great. Look, I rescheduled a meeting to see you...
...but I guess I can reschedule it back.
are you mad? -Don't worry about it. I'm not mad.
maybe tomorrow.
Yeah, later.
look, Stu... -What?
big kiss.
you too.
Yeah. -Isn't it funny?
you hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody...
...but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn 't it?
what?
I hope you realize how you've hurt my feelings.
who the fuck is this? -Don't think about leaving that phone.
wrong number, pal. -It was a perfectly delicious pizza.
you're certainly going to wish you had accepted it.
naturally, this is part of the gag. The pizza bit. That was funny shit.
well, its purpose was to keep your strength up for what's coming next.
what's coming next is I'm hanging up. -Oh, no, you won 't.
you're going to learn to obey me. -Obey you?
who is this? -Someone who enjoys watching you.
watching me?
Yes, I love the suit you're wearing today. Black on raspberry sorbet. Very Italian.
Where--? Where are you?
there are hundreds of windows out there. Why don 't you check them out?
so, what am I doing now? - You're scratching your head.
now you're brushing your hair back.
that's not very nice, Stu.
did you call me Stu?
who' s Stu? I don' t know any Stu. -Why, do you prefer Stuart?
a lot of people in this neighborhood know me.
Stuart Shepard, 1 326 West 5 1st Street, Third Floor, front.
go mind-fuck some other guy, pal. -I know Pamela McFadden too.
it's not in your best interest to disconnect me.
someone could get hurt.
what's the matter, Stu?
if you' re some fucked-up, failed actor I wouldn' t handle...
...or some prick intern I fired, I will hunt you down and I will crush you.
you will never work in this town.
I can turn people into gods...
...and I can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren't one already.
do you hear me? Am I upsetting you? Hello.
Oh, you think I'm gonna, what? Pay you off or something?
t ell me what you want. -Now you want to talk to me.
did Adam at my office put you up to this?
no, I thought this up all by myself.
keep thinking. I'm hanging up.
I'll say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you. Talk to you later.
what the--?
the callback feature cannot be activated
motherfucker.
tell me what you want. -I want your complete attention.
are you an actor? - Yes. One of your pathetic failed ones.
Lt' s tough when you' re not known. - Tell me about it.
you don 't have to hunt me and crush me. I can't get work in this town as it is.
I've done some off-Broadway, some off-Manhattan plays, but that dried up.
now I wait tables, clean toilets, anything to make the rent.
I'm a walking cliche.
I can help you. I can get you auditions.
auditions? You're not an agent. You're a publicist.
Yeah, but I have contacts. I know agents. I can get you an audition.
Really? -Yeah.
well, there is someone I'd like you to call.
name it.
try the number you dialed when you first got into the booth.
I don't know what you're talking about. -No?
lucky you then, because I wrote it down.
I can see every number you pressed. Let's see if Pam is still at work.
no. -Then I guess I'll have to do it.
look, don' t! -Too late. It's already ringing.
I'll put her on speaker so you can hear. -You' re fucking kidding me.
Stu, I never kid.
hello. - Well, hello, Pam.
Hi, who' s this? -It's a good friend of Stu's.
and he hasn 't got many. -You know Stu?
I know he lies.
who is this? -Don 't worry about that.
Stu's listening in. He can hear what we 're saying about him.
Stu, is that true? Are you there? -Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!
she can 't hear you, Stu.
Pam, I'm afraid Stu hasn 't been totally honest with you.
what do you mean? -Don' t do this.
Stu has been lying to you. -Pam, hang up.
now, why would a man who has a cell phone...
...call you every day from a phone booth?
because he said it' s quiet. -Pam, that's just stupid.
it's because his wife checks his cell phone bills.
no record of his calls to you. -Jesus Christ.
he said he wasn't married. -Oh, he 's married.
her name is Kelly. I've never seen her but she sounds lovely.
why do you think he invites you to the City Hotel?
cheap rooms for cheap girls. -Asshole.
he 's telling you all this so you'll sleep with him.
he' s lying, Pam. Don' t listen. -I know that, okay?
I may be from Montana, but we have men there also.
I wasn' t planning on sleeping with him.
I just don't know a lot of people here right now.
and he's cute and he said that he would help me.
you never asked me if I was married. -He's never made anyone a star. Bye.
Hello?
back to you, Stu.
gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score.
go away. -Go away? Hang up the phone, nigga.
this motherfucker, you don't eyeball me. Bitch.
why are you doing this? Did I ever harm you? Did l--?
now, let's call Kelly. -She's not home.
Oh, but I'm sure she 's at the shop on Columbus.
how the fuck do you know all this shit?
speed dial her. Press "auto one. " That's her button.
what am I supposed to say? -Why don 't you try the truth?
you're cheating. -l' m not cheating on Kelly. I never have.
then what do you call it? -Look, you' re a guy...
...sometimes you want to know it' s a possibility.
it' s like having a beautiful home...
...but you still dream of that quick vacation.
you know, some nice hotel room with a great view, maybe a pool.
it's just a fantasy. You never leave home.
do you hear what I'm saying? -Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.
I'm sure they'll both appreciate that. -Fuck you.
Hey, that kind of language is uncalled for.
you can't take up the whole booth. This here's my business.
this is not the only phone in New York.
it's the only one on 8th Avenue that's working.
bullshit! Go in a restaurant, but get lost. -Motherfucker, this is my phone. Get
goddamn it, man! You done made me hurt my dick hand.
I'm sure you're just as good with the other hand. Yeah, go away.
I'll be back, motherfucker. I will be back, bitch. Get out of my way!
I was worried for you. I thought she was gonna put an eye out with that hand.
whoever you are, you're obviously a very intelligent man.
I know what stress does. It's all I can do from going crazy myself.
you're calling me crazy? -No, you're going through a difficult time.
look, please don't call my wife.
let me give you my office number. We'll talk.
I know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots.
Stu, do you really think that I'm an actor?
I'm not an actor. I have no use for you, Stu. None.
I would just like you to tell Kelly the truth about yourself.
so are you going to call Kelly and tell her about Pam?
or do I have to? -No!
Jesus, no. I'm doing it.
feeling kind of nervous, Stu?
hello. -Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.
Stu? -Yeah.
where are you? -l' m in a phone booth.
baby, I just got this call from this guy who said you' d be calling me...
...from a booth to tell me something important.
there's a lot of prank calling going on today, baby.
tell her you invite women... -Shut up.
...to have drinks at discreet hotels.
I' m not talking to you, baby.
someone 's got company.
who' s that woman? -Bitch got a cell phone!
some hooker is trying to use the phone. -He just called me a hooker.
are you sure there's nothing wrong? -We are escorts. Escorts.
tell her you want to sleep with other women.
there is this person and he's saying things about me.
things that might not be true.
and if he calls you-- Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops!
honey, I want to sleep with other women.
look, Kelly, whatever he says, don't believe him.
I haven't done anything. -Only because Pam had to rehearse.
shut the fuck up!
Stu, I don't know what you're talking about, but you're scaring me.
I'm sorry, baby.
can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
I feel kind of weird. -Yeah. Look, I'll try. Don't worry.
come on! -Yeah, bitch!
I love you too. - "I love you.
get out of here before I have you deported to Jersey.
you're a fucking ass! -And you're a dirty skank.
what are you gonna do about it? -Your mama is a skank, bitch!
you didn't tell your wife the truth, did you, Stu?
and you can tell she really loves you.
must be nice to have a pretty girl care for you.
why screw up her life? She never did you harm.
everybody does harm.
that's it. This mind-fuck is over.
Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.
what are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
I never said I had binoculars.
I have a highly magnified telescopic image of you.
now what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it?
what? You mean like a rifle?
A. 30-caliber bolt-action 700 with a carbon-one modification...
...and a state-of-the-art Hensholdt tactical scope.
and it's staring straight at you. -Yeah, how' s my fucking hair?
at this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.
nice try, pal. Go to hell.
now, doesn't that just torque your jaws?
I love that.
you know, like in the movies just as the good guy...
...is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun.
now why didn 't he have it cocked?
because that sound is scary.
it's cool, isn 't it?
look, you shoot a gun here and there'll be pandemonium.
do you hear me? There will be cops all over this block.
do you think so? Let's see. One. Two.
that won't help you.
three.
Stu, look at everybody. Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.
here come the cops.
sniper on the roof. Gunfire, hit the deck.
Stu, you still with me?
stand up and be a man.
so do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
no, I have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.
shall I take care of him? -No! No. Shit, no.
it would be so easy.
here.
here.
Stu, you just gave that gentleman $ 1 0 to walk away.
you saved his life. You do have a sensitive side.
how much to let me go? -Let's see how sensitive you really are.
I'm aiming at you right now.
can you feel it, the heat of it?
come now, Stu, you can feel it.
concentrate.
concentrate.
take a look at where I'm going.
you're doing so much better than the others.
you read about the German porn king shot 10 days ago...
...at 38th and 8th?
he thought he was an artist and wouldn 't admit he was just a pedophile.
believe me, he had plenty of chances to come clean.
you must have read about the corporate executive shot at 47th and 10th.
what you didn 't read was that he cashed in all of his stocks...
...just before the bottom fell out, while all the little guys lost everything.
now if he had been willing to make amends...
...share the money, things might have been different.
please, tell me, where am I aiming now?
below the shoulder. - Which one?
the right shoulder.
love to love you too, baby! -That's phenomenal, Stu.
you're doing so much better than the others.
what do you remember about those killings, Stu?
I don' t know.
well, you think of yourself as a smart guy, Stu. Try.
they got shot. I don' t know, all right? -Okay, I'll give you a hint.
wallets, watches, everything was left on their bodies.
because they weren't robberies. They were executions.
they didn't have to be.
what did I do to deserve this? Why me?
if you have to ask, then you're not ready to know yet.
right here. Shit. Come on. -Jesus. You, in the booth.
come on. -Now what?
you got any idea how much pain you' re making in my life?
Hey, look at me. -Look, I hear you!
look me in the eye. Hang up the phone and walk away.
don't do it. -I got my own problems.
I'm your problem. You know why?
my girls keep yapping at me, " Leon, he won't share the phone.
leon, he told us to fuck off.
we're gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone.
I'm trying to run a fucking business. -I sympathize, but I can't get off the call.
no, you don't understand me. I got the Girl-string union here.
they're breaking my balls.
I gotta live with their shit, but not yours.
so I'm saying this once, nice, all right? Hang up the phone. Walk away.
he did say it nicely. -He got a cell phone up in there too.
lt ain't even like he need a phone! -I can't get off the call!
shut the fuck up! Do you hear that shit? It's like nails on a chalkboard.
they ain't gonna fucking stop, till I get their way.
I'm getting a fucking headache, pal. -All right. I'll pay you to go away.
I don't want your money. I want you to hang up the phone and get out.
$ 1 20. It's all yours. -Everybody has their price, right, Stu?
you're gonna give me $ 1 20 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
Yeah, I'm a nice guy. -Something ain't right with him.
look at that sweat pouring off that son of a bitch.
this one sick mother we started with. -It's probably catching too.
yo. -He's got AlDS.
how long you want to rent the booth? -lndefinitely.
lndefinitely? -Yes.
do I look like a asshole? Let me tell you something.
$500 gets you indefinitely. -Wait up! Hold the fuck up!
how come he's defying you, huh? What, you got bitch in you now?
did I say shut the fuck up? -Yeah, now talk to him like that!
Jesus Christ. Are you enjoying this?
do you need help? -Look, I'm handling it.
come on! -I can help you, Stu.
I wasn't gonna kill you before, but you changed my fucking mind.
I would take off if I was you. He gonna kick your ass.
he gonna kick your ass. -Get the fuck out!
can you get out of here? Will you go away?
he looks very angry. -Come on. I, look
hang up. -Get rid of him.
hang up the phone! -We can work this out!
get rid of him! -Hang up the phone.
I got a watch. It's a Solaris, $2000 retail.
yeah? I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.
you got five seconds to get off the fucking phone. Five.
batter up. -Four.
I can stop him.
three.
just say the word, Stu. -Two. One.
no, no. Don't. Don't.
fuck.
this will count as a hang up.
I can make him stop. Just say the word. Can you hear me?
Yes. - What?
Yes!
whose street is this? -That' s right, baby.
Oh, my God.
baby, you bleeding? You must' ve cut yourself
what's wrong? -You cut yourself.
what's wrong? What's wrong? -Baby? Leon? Leon!
he was fucking shot! -Oh, my God!
motherfucker! -He's shot!
Leon!
somebody call an ambulance!
call 411! -911, dumb bitch!
he ain't breathing. Call the meat wagon!
shut the fuck up! -You shot him.
why'd you fucking shoot him? - You said, "Yes.
Yes, I can hear you," not, "Yes, kill him!
you ought to be more careful with what you say.
Oh, my God.
motherfucker, why?! -lt wasn' t me!
Where's the gun? Do you see a gun? -Fuck you!
you pumped one into him, bitch! I saw it! He's got a Glock!
get down! Get the fuck down! Daddy got a Glock!
what Glock? I don't have a fucking Glock! It's a telephone!
you shot my man, daddy! They gonna skin and fry your ass!
you shot my baby, daddy! Mr. Motherfucker! Mr. Motherfucker!
please, come on! Come in here, bitch!
better run, motherfucker!
the cops is coming and I hope they fry your ass down!
I'm not going anywhere, am l?
if you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.
look, I offered him money. I offered him my watch.
but not your respect, which is what he really wanted.
you were dismissive like you dismissed the nice pizza guy.
you are guilty of inhumanity to your fellow man.
I' m not guilty of a goddamn thing.
take responsibility for what you've done, Stu. Be a man.
I love this fucking spin. You shoot the guy, and I'm fucking responsible?
well, looked that way from up here.
I don't know what I did to you but whatever it was, I'm glad.
I wish it had been worse. I wish you died!
Yes, finally some honesty. -Just tell me who you are.
no one you'd ever notice. I don 't run in your circles.
and what is it you do? -I watch.
you watch? - Yes, well, what else is there to do...
... when life turns on you and you've retreated into some small room?
you look out your window.
you see people come in and out of this phone booth. The same ones every day.
you make up names for them. You imagine their stories.
but eventually, you get tired of imagining and follow one of them.
and you hear all of his lies.
and you decide that his sins should be punished.
some guy shouting into a cell phone full of self-importance isn 't gonna notice me.
but I noticed that German porn king, and I noticed that corrupt executive.
and I noticed you, Stu.
l' m flattered. -Operator 553. What is your emergency?
will you please respond?
what was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
the Stu Show. Better than TV.
look, how'd I get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle?!
you had it made. Kelly at home, Pam on the side.
I saw Pam once. I followed her to her restaurant. Lovely.
life has given you more than your fair share, Stu.
but it appears you don 't appreciate it.
look, look, listen, appearances can be deceiving.
I may look confident, but I'm really, actually just crying out for help!
help! You know?
I'm trying to help you, Stu, but you won't help yourself.
fuck. -What's the matter, Stu?
you shot me! -It's time you learn, Stu.
deception can 't go unrewarded. -Deception! What fucking deception?
are you in need of immediate police or medical response?
shit. You bugged the fucking booth.
that's how you knew. That's how you knew about Pam.
you picked the wrong person to lie to. -Look, I didn' t pick you.
it must have been your flashy suit that attracted me.
I get fucked on account of my clothes? That why you killed Leon?
I didn't kill Leon because of the way he dressed.
and those other two guys as well? Did they dress too nice?
you must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.
all right, here come the cops.
what are you gonna do? Run?
no, I'm not a coward like some people I know.
you can get away if you run now. - You'll blame me for Leon.
no, no, l' ll confess I shot him with my fucking phone.
well, then I urge you to keep one thing in mind, Stu.
take a look at your chest. You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.
kill me now, and you give yourself away.
not with a silencer. It would take these guys...
...the rest of the day to figure out it wasn't one of their own men that did it.
you can be shot 4 1 times for pulling out your wallet.
throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.
ignore him. -Yeah, what if they open fire?
they won 't. Look around you, Stu.
do you see the tourists with the video cameras?
the ones hoping the cops will blow you away...
...so they can sell the tape to The Most Gory Police Shootouts?
don't worry, they'll keep the police on their best behavior.
so long as you don't take hostile action, you should be safe.
safe? You call this safe?
I got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.
with both hands raised, moving slowly, step out of the booth.
if we see any signs of a weapon we will respond.
you won't because there isn't any!
put down the phone and raise your hands!
look, I can't. I'm on an important call.
verify this information for me.
the guy in the booth shot that guy over there...
...and stuck around to make a phone call.
Yeah, that's what the hookers are saying.
all right, give me the horn.
sir! I'm ordering you to fully comply. -I'm busy, all right. Come back later.
very good, Stu. -Step out of the booth...
...and raise your hands. I am giving you an order.
I give the orders here, Stu, don 't I?
this guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.
suicide by a cop? Well, that's not gonna happen.
get that body out of here fast.
somebody get the body. Tell the ambulance to get the body.
thousands of people die every day, but you put one dead body in the middle of a busy street and it makes people crazy.
look at these guys. You can smell the fear.
ten cops. - This reminds me of Nam.
Vietnam? - Yes, Vietnam.
I was too young to go, but l' ve seen pictures.
well, pictures can 't do it, Stu. You can 't imagine the fear, the stench.
Napalm-charred bodies, children leaving grenades in your boots.
then you got blamed for the war. -I came home and people spit on me.
Yeah, this country owes you an apology.
look, I just had this vision of you, of a kid, coming back from the war...
...inured to the killing, not able to get work, isolated.
I think that could be made into an affecting story...
...and, you know, one that everyone understands.
and I think cops are on the side of vets.
you are pathetic, Stu. Why don't you wake up?
Napalm-charred bodies? I'd have to be 50 to be in that war!
stop fucking with my head, please!
I'm gonna go talk to him.
shouldn't we wait on the ESU negotiator?
they could take 20 minutes. I'm not gonna take a chance on this one.
I'm gonna handle this.
sir! I'm taking out my weapon.
putting my weapon down on the car.
the captain's going in. -I'm not armed.
Yeah, neither am l. -My name is Ramey.
captain Ed Ramey. -All right.
what's yours? -I don't want to be friends.
I don't know. It looks like you could use a friend right now.
tell him you've already got a friend. -I already got a friend.
is that who you're talking to on the phone?
look, I just want to hear your side of it. That's all.
I ain't got no side of it, and I didn't shoot anybody.
you see a fucking gun anywhere? Look.
it's in your back pocket! I see it! He been...
sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
no. I got a cell phone and I got cigarettes. I got no fucking weapon.
then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?
you want to see it? Here. -Hey!
don't reach for that! Hold your fire!
I don't need to see it. I know what's there.
I got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it.
they didn't see it because it didn't happen!
shut them up! -He's dead, but it didn't happen?
then who did it? -Mustn't tell him, Stu.
I don't know. -You were the closest one to him.
you must've saw it happen. Help me. -No.
this guy is getting on my nerves. -Look, stay the fuck out of this.
who do you keep talking to on the phone?
nobody. -Your friend, your parent, your lover?
who? -Careful, Stuart. Careful.
my psychiatrist.
excellent. I should've thought of that. -I see. What' s this doctor' s name?
it would be really helpful to us if we knew.
he says not to tell you, all right? It's privileged information.
very good, Stuart. See, now you're having fun.
Yeah, whatever you fucking say. -I respect your right to privacy.
I've been through therapy myself. The department provided it for me.
I know it's not good form for a cop to be saying that, but sometimes...
...you know, circumstances, stress-- I had issues. I lost my marriage over it.
tell him not to come any closer.
don't come any closer. Stop there. Go back a few steps.
go back to where you were! -Okay. No problem.
that's right. -So you got some intimacy issues.
I got those too. All I want to know is, what happened, man?
tell him to read you your rights. -I want you to read me my rights.
stop asking questions.
you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided for you.
all right? So now, can you at least give me your first name?
just your first name. -Don't tell him.
it' s my right not to have any first name.
no gun, no name. -That's right.
you're highly underprivileged. -Demand your lawyer.
and go get my lawyer too. All right?
I want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.
just brilliant, Stu. -I understand that, but it' s gonna be difficult to get a lawyer to come and risk his life.
once you hand over the gun-- -How can l?
you won't let me put my hand in my pocket?
we'll take it out for you. All you have to do is step out with your hands raised. Nothing will happen to you.
it's not gonna work. -Stu, Stu.
what? -Ask him a question.
ask him if his wife got tired of sleeping with him.
l... Fuck. I can' t do that. -Oh, sure you can, Stu.
ask him if he couldn 't get it up, if he couldn 't satisfy her.
are you gonna step out of the booth? -I can't. No.
you' re not stepping out of the booth? -Ask him.
ls that a no? -Ask him!
both your lives depend on it. -Sir?
captain, you couldn' t satisfy your wife sexually?
excuse me? -Ask him if he abuses himself now?
does he masturbate on lonely nights? -Fuck. For God's sake!
say it!
say it or I will blow him away!
if you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker.
guys around here'll tell ya... you play for a living.
it's like any other job. You don't gamble. You grind it out.
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.
don't give anything away.
that's how I've paid my way through half of law school.
a true grinder.
see, I learned how to win a little at a time. But finally, I've learned this...
if you're too careful, your whole life can become a fucking grind.
this is Teddy KGB's place.
[Man] Five hundred. - You won't find it in the Yellow Pages.
Nope. Not tonight.
no? What?
give me three stacks of high society.
thirty thousand. Count it.
that's good. - So, you're sitting the apple.
good. Want a cookie? - No.
[Narrating] He doesn't look like much, but KGB is connected all the way to the top of the Russian mob.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
they all know me as a small-timer, but that's about to change.
Joey Knish is a New York legend.
since he was 19 years old.
uh, yeah, I'm holding them for you.
you should be. - [Chuckles]
cause I hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
[Narrating] He's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
come here. - [Narrator] But tonight, I don't want to see him.
cause they'll chew you up, take your whole bankroll.
so you say. - There's plenty of easy games.
we get outta here, get some coffee, ride over to that soft seat in Queens.
I know what I'm doing.
you're making a run at it, aren't you?
I'm right, right?
I can beat the game. - Maybe.
maybe this is a game can be beat.
at that goulash joint on 79th Street.
okay. I understand.
I understand. Back to battle.
[Narrating] The game in question is No-Limit Texas Hold Them.
minimum buy-in $25, 000.
a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
No-Limit Texas Hold Them is the Cadillac of poker.
each player is dealt two cards face down.
five cards are then dealt face up across the middle.
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand.
the key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
bet an eight ball.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt...
and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
this is why the World Series of Poker is decided over a No-Limit Hold Them table.
some people, pros even, won't play No-Limit.
they can't handle the swings.
but there are others, like Doyle Brunson, who consider No-Limit the only pure game left.
like Papa Wallenda said..."Life is on the wire. The rest is just waiting.
pass it to you.
all right, I raise.
I'm gonna raise five hundred. - [Man] Fold.
it's a position raise. I call it.
[Narrating] Here's the beauty of this game.
go ahead. - [Narrating] I just got top two pair on the flop,
against your average guy, I'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
let him walk into it. But KGB's too smart for that.
so, what I've got to do is over-bet the pot, make it look like I'm trying to buy it.
I bet $2, 000. - Then he plays back at me, and I get paid off.
call.
[Narrating] My guess is Teddy's on a flush draw.
burn and turn.
[Narrating] There's my money card, nine of hearts.
I got a full house.
to the bettor. - Check's good.
[Narrating] Now I hope a spade falls and Teddy makes his flush.
I'm going to bet...
bet...
15000
time.
[Narrating] I want him to think that I'm pondering a call, but all I'm really thinking about is Vegas and the fucking Mirage.
all right, your 15, plus I have another 33 to raise you.
um...
Yeah, I'm gonna go all in, 'cause I don't think you got the spades.
[Narrating] I know before the cards are even turned over.
aces full, Mike.
get up.
come on. Come on.
want some? - No.
I'm down to the felt, Knish. I lost everything.
man, I lost my case money. I lost my tuition.
it happens to everyone. Time to time, everyone goes bust.
you'll be back in the game before you know it.
I'm done. I'm out of it.
they all say that at first.
Hey, man, let me stake you. Standard deal, you know.
fifty percent of your winnings. If you lose, it's on me.
I'd just throw it away.
you still got the truck? - Sure.
come on.
[Mike Narrating] You don't hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but I'll tell you what happens to them.
they end up humping crappy jobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.
me sitting at the big table, Doyle to my left,
Amarillo Slim to my right, playing in the World Series of Poker.
and I let that vision blind me at the table against KGB.
now, the closest I get to Vegas is west New York, driving this lousy route handed down from Knish...
to rounders who forget the cardinal fucking rule...
always leave yourself outs.
Hey, Moogie. - Let me ask you a question.
in a legal sense, can fucking Steinbrenner just move the Yankees?
does he have the fucking right to just move them?
I don't know. How should I know that?
you didn't learn that yet? - No, we get to Steinbrenner in the third year of law school.
Oh.
take care, man. - Yeah.
[Chattering] - [Poker Chips Clattering]
[Mike Narrating] The judges' game.
I'd heard about it for years on the street, before I was even in law school.
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days...
it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
one rounder, Crispy Linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't cross the street without a legal hassle.
place had been open since 1907.
you got some things for me? - Yes, I do.
put them on the desk, it's all right.
kid, he paying you for this late night shit?
Oh, well, knowledge is my reward, sir.
[Chuckles] - Let me tell you, it ain't worth it.
why don't you become a jockey, do something useful.
[Group Laughs] - Kid's a little tall, isn't he, Gene?
enough with the Belmont recruiting spiel. Your bet.
all right. I call. - Michael is lead counsel...
in the Moot Court you're presiding over next week, Gene.
besides, he could use the background if he's gonna...
clerk for one of you fellas this summer, right?
abe, I thought you liked the kid. Why do you want to make him a civil servant?
Yeah, look... a word to the wise. Stay in the private sector.
that Nassau defense attorney's game? They use our chips for coasters.
[Mike Narrating] The amazing thing is, in this collection of great legal minds, there isn't a single real card player.
I call. - Raise.
um, the professor raises.
Mike? [Whispers] Michael, I would have just called.
no, you're good.
all right, I call.
[Mike Narrating] I don't know if I'm going to bring my legal career to a crashing halt...
before it even starts, but I just can't help myself.
good. - I'm in.
[Clears Throat] - Read them and weep.
threes check.
check to Martin and Lewis over there.
check to the raiser. - Czechoslovakia.
okay. Good. There's $20.
you've seen half a hand. How the fuck are you betting into us?
you sure this is wise, Abe? It's your money the kid's betting with.
it's plenty wise. We know what we're holding, and we know what you're holding.
[Chuckles] The fuck you know what we all got.
summer clerkship in your office says I know what you're holding.
I don't bet with jobs like that.
let's just say I'll put you at the top of the list if you're right.
okay. [Clears Throat] Well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that Professor Green folded it on Fourth Street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the D. A. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are gonna stand up.
so, like I said, the Dean's bet is $20.
well, kiss my ass. - Kiss my ass.
[Group Laughs]
What'd you have, Abe? - Nothing but a busted straight.
Oh, come on. - It's good enough to win. Take it down.
all right, kid, your first assignment. Pull up a seat next to me.
get outta here! - See you tomorrow.
whose deal? - My deal.
I like the kid, Abe. - Good kid.
smart kid.
[Mike Narrating] I tell ya, it's hard leaving that game.
the truth is, I can always find games, though.
easy games, tough games, straight games, crooked games, home games.
I can turn this truck onto the Jersey Turnpike and be at the Taj in two hours.
but I've made promises.
I'm just a law student now.
Hello?
Hey. - Hey.
how'd it go? - Oh, great.
[Sighs] I am sick of that fucking route.
don't worry. A few more semesters...
Mmm.
Oh, I gotta go.
you won't feel a thing. [Chuckles] - [Chuckles]
we both know that's not true.
besides, you should get some sleep.
these fucking long nights are killing me.
they never used to.
Yeah, well, that's different. I mean, that was like...
buy in at 8: 00, next thing you know it's morning.
but hey, you know, I think I'm hooked up for this summer.
hooked up how?
well, after I left you last night at the library, I impressed Judge Marinacci.
I think I might be in line for a clerkship.
tell me more.
well, those guys were all playing cards, and...
just hear me out now, hear me out.
they were playing cards and I read his hand blind.
so, instead of coming home, you went and played cards with some judge?
no, I wasn't even playing. They were playing.
I just caught his eye by reading his hand, that's all.
I mean, as long as I don't fuck up Moot Court, I think the job's mine.
what kind of job is that gonna be, Mike?
writing an opinion on high-stakes poker?
honey, you're the one who told me...
that I should use my poker skills in the courtroom.
Yeah, I know I said that, but...
you know what I meant. I meant that you should use your head.
you know, the way you calculate odds on the spot, the way you read people.
that's what I meant. I didn't mean that you should try to con your way into a summer job.
honey, con? I was networking. - [Laughs] Oh, God.
networking. Are you trying to con me now?
no.
I just... I don't think you get it.
you'll be just like one of those ex-college athletes.
you know, great job at the D. A. 's office as long as...
they never miss a lawyer's league game.
it's true. I just think if you get in this way, you'll always be a hustler to them.
baby, I didn't even play.
okay.
I'll see you later.
Oh.
Hey, hon, can I take the Jeep tomorrow? - Yeah, where?
uh, Worm's getting out. I was gonna pick him up.
tomorrow. Beautiful.
I promised I'd be there, hon.
worm. I just can't believe you still know someone called "Worm.
he's like my brother.
shit. I didn't even play.
[Mike Narrating] I met Worm at Dwight Inglewood Preparatory Academy over in Jersey.
we were the only two kids attending who didn't have a trust fund.
my father's office was there. It said "Custodian" on the door.
that's why they took me.
[Makes Buzzer Sound] - Pow!
w-was that, like, your strong finish or something?
motherfucker! - You leave me no choice, the way you play.
that's the fourth time you done played that bitch of spades on my ass.
no, no, no, no, no.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago I got the black Maria, so I don't want to hear you bitching, okay?
Yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn't he? - Yeah, I saw that.
so it helped you. - Now... Okay, you're right.
you know the drill, okay? I'm not gonna smoke them. I'll hold on to them.
if you want them back, you can trade me for them, or try to play double or nothing tomorrow.
Murphy! What the hell you sitting there for? You're processed. Come on.
processed? This motherfucker's getting the jump.
come on, man, have some decency here, Worm.
you can buy all the smokes you want in half an hour.
what are you talking about? I won these fair and square. - You don't even smoke, Worm.
Jesus, you guys are such fucking babies. You know that?
if you're determined to die of cancer, you really oughta learn how to play cards.
ain't a good idea to add insult to injury, yo.
that shit will come back and hurt you. - You know what?
not in this lifetime. Enjoy your time.
Murphy.
[Mike Narrating] Worm's dad did the grounds, when he wasn't too fucking drunk.
that's when we did them.
of course, the grounds weren't all we did.
selling them dime bags of oregano, nunchakus and firecrackers from Chinatown.
Where's the rest? - Kept us in lunch money.
thank you. - Until the time we went for...
more than just pocket change and got caught.
we had the starting five take a dive against Friends Academy.
the point guard snapped and gave Worm up.
they hauled him up before the school board, offered him a deal.
tell us who else was involved, and we'll go easy on you.
worm didn't say a fucking word. Got himself expelled.
I stayed in school and graduated. - [Guard] Crank the outside.
[Bell Rings]
not many guys would stand up for a friend like that.
Ta-da! - [Both Laugh]
you never let me down. - I would have been there every week if you let me, man.
I know, I know. I couldn't let you see me in this shit hole.
look at you. You look great, man. - You too, you too.
did they toughen you up in there? - No, no.
it was a piece of cake. Piece of cake.
man, look at your ride. You've been prospering while I've been away.
what have you been up to? - I borrowed it.
whatever. Just get in it and drive me far away from here.
so I gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
and the trick is, I gotta take enough cash off the white guys...
but I gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that I can trade and keep myself...
in the style that I've grown accustomed to, and all of this without getting my ass kicked.
so you're working with a partner?
no. Who the hell am I gonna trust in there?
it's just me all alone. - What's this? Come here.
you like that? Isn't that beautiful? - What is that?
it's like an ace up my sleeve. What else?
wait till I show you some of my chops, man. I've gotten pretty blinding.
you been working? Is your game sharp?
no, man, I'm off it.
what, are you... you getting cold cards?
no, man, I mean I quit.
[Laughs] What, are you shitting me? - No, man, l...
I got cleaned out. - Mike McD? You lost?
Yeah, man, l... It was a real blood game over at KGB's place.
I didn't want to dispirit you like that.
Jesus, what were you thinking? So, you're just a student now?
what are you doing for money? - I'm driving Knish's truck.
Oh, God, you're killing me. Mike, Mike, we gotta get you back on the game.
the old partners here, we're gonna run like... - No, no, no, I'm off it.
I mean, I really am. Done.
you are, huh? All right. I know a game perfect for the two of us.
it's a berry patch right outside New York City... prime pickings.
I'll drop you... I'll drop you off. - Okay.
I mean it. No, I'm really off it. - I know, I know.
this is it, this is it.
so get this, here's the plan. I know this girl Barbara.
she's fucking hot. I was this close to banging her when they sent me away.
she works as a hostess for all these fucking trust fund babies in here.
she got me into their little game.
she introduced me as her cousin from out of town who loves to gamble but wants to learn poker.
that sounds solid. That's a nice hookup.
it's all the way nice. There's only one problem. I got this feeling.
what feeling is that, exactly? - You know this feeling very well.
you know, when you got your table all set. - Uh-huh.
knife, fork, sauce, A-1, Luger's, but... - Yeah.
you just don't have the stake. - Exactly. Glad you understand.
a nickel would start me very nicely.
whoa, Jesus, what have you been living on?
I'm living a little light, I told you.
anyway, that's $220, so that'll get you started. - $220, I mean...
Hey, thanks, but I mean, that's, like, 11 bets.
I mean, I can't even get a table on this...
good, so forget this game. I'll straighten you out in the city tomorrow.
I mean, I'm already behind here.
you just got out. What's the big fucking hurry?
the hurry is, other than you, my friend, there's about five guys, like, eagerly awaiting my release.
how much do you owe? - Like, ten.
ten? - I can't even figure it with the juice.
Hey, look, I can get started on this easy if it's you and me working together.
I heard you asking before, and I hear you asking now, but I can't do that.
I just can't do that. I've made promises.
Hey, you know what? What am I saying? I totally understand, I do.
it's fine. I'll make a couple of moves earlier than I would have normally...
I'll catch you in the city tomorrow? - Yeah.
you too.
[Mike Narrating] In Confessions of a Winning Poker Player, Jack King said, "but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy...
the outstanding tough beats of his career.
seems true to me. 'Cause walking in here,
I can hardly remember how I built my bankroll, but I can't stop thinking of how I lost it.
Mike.
Hi. - Barbara. Worm said you'd be running a little late.
just follow me.
I probably won't even sit. You know, just kinda keep him company.
no, no, that's not gonna work.
here's the play... you're my new boyfriend, you're looking for a regular game.
Really? Well, I'm not much of a card player.
bullshit. Worm tells me that's precisely what you are.
my cut is 25 per cent.
I see. - Good. Come on.
gentlemen.
this is my boyfriend Michael. - [Group] Hello, Michael.
[Barbara] Be nice to him.
leave him enough money to buy me breakfast. - [Laughter]
good luck. - Thanks, sweetie.
here, why don't you pull up a chair.
okay, this one's Chicago. - You know Chicago?
uh, remind me. - Stud game.
okay, well, deal me in, I guess.
that's you. - Oh, thanks.
okay.
that's two on you, Murph. - Oh, yeah. Sorry.
I'm in. - I'm gonna make it five.
Hey, big spender.
[Mike Narrating] Worm and I fall into our old rhythm like Clyde Frazier and Pearl Monroe.
we bring out all the old school tricks, stuff that would never play in the city...
signalling, chip placing, trapping.
we even run the old best hand play. - Raise.
I can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up, but there's no risk in this room.
now, some people might look down on Worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
but as Canada Bill Jones said, "It's immoral to let a sucker keep his money.
like they teach you in One-L...
caveat emptor, pal.
I got the boat, queens over. - [Chuckles]
[Chuckles] He asked you if that stung, Birch.
[Mike Narrating] Worm really has become an artist, too.
discard culls, pickup culls, overhand run ups, the Double Duke...
his technique is flawless. But his judgment is a little off.
a few times, I have to fold the case on him, just so it won't be obvious.
still, he plays the part of the loser to perfection.
flush.
I got the full house. I got the queens over the aces.
ahh, fuck! You know what?
fuck you and your never-ending string of boats, okay? - Hey.
well, my Uncle Les says when the money's gone, it's time to move on, so enjoy it, you secret handshaking assholes.
Murph! Hey, come back any time. Your money's always good here.
[Door Closes] - Good night, Mike. See you next time.
you guys, uh, wanna keep playing?
how'd we do? Oh, beautiful.
fucking assholes, they deserved it.
all right, $300, that's your cut.
thank you very much, boys. - Hey, you were great. Great.
when can we do this again? - No, no, it was a one-time thing for me.
uh, two weeks. - Two weeks? Okay. Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot. Yeah. - [Chuckles]
Hey, I had to try, right?
Bye.
Hey, how'd you know I was coming back?
that's easy. Who's your favorite actor?
Clint Eastwood. The Outlaw Josey Wales, man. The Man with No Name.
he always doubles back for a friend.
[Worm] Hey, we made good time. Wanna get breakfast?
[Mike] No, I gotta get home. If she hasn't already changed the locks on me.
just do me a favor. Give me five minutes.
get me straightened out.
this may not look like Teddy's place, but it ain't the Ivy Leagues either.
so don't fuck around. You gotta play on your belly.
all right. No problem.
Hey, you know I have no problem with the way you help yourself, but these guys are fast company.
they'll spot every move. - Tough customers, huh?
Yeah. I'm serious. - All right.
you won't just get a finger up your spine. - Okay, I hear ya.
I'm playing straight. - [Buzzes]
michael McDermott.
how you doing, Mikey? - Good, how you doing?
good. You know, um, the computer tried to delete you last week.
Oh, yeah? - But I knew you'd be back.
Oh, no, I'm not back, I just...
it's good to see you. - Good to see you, too.
um, this is Les Murphy. He's like my brother.
call me Worm.
[Phone Rings] - Hey. Don't wiggle away.
Hey, what's she wearing the button for?
they're wired right into the precinct. They got them on the payroll.
what are they playing? - Uh, 20-40 forced rotation.
it's the only game going right now.
is that Fat Greggie sitting 20-40? The game's that soft?
no. - Hell, yeah, I'm gonna play.
Oh, come on, you're not gonna walk away from this. - Not gonna happen.
Mike, we could cut this room up in an hour.
all right, run along, then. Say hi to her for me.
me, too. - I will. Take care of him.
Jesus. What a fucking waste.
do you believe that? She's really got him by the balls.
that's not so bad, is it? - Depends on the grip.
come on, give me $2, 000. - On the finger?
you heard Mike. He's good for it. Come on.
look, I'm gonna triple that in half an hour, princess. Let's go.
okay.
[Keys Jingling, Door Opening]
Hey.
reunion run a little late?
I was gonna call, but I didn't want to wake you up.
it's okay. I wasn't sleeping.
well, why don't you change and we'll get a cab.
um, why don't you just go ahead, and I'm gonna jump in the shower.
and if I miss a little bit of the Mulligan meeting, just cover for me, all right?
Hey.
at least give me a story. You know, I mean...
I mean, tell me you were out drinking till you threw up.
I don't care, just give me something. - I was entertaining Worm.
Uh-huh. - The least I can do for the guy.
so, you were nowhere near a card game. - Sweetie.
what? I'm asking you a question.
I'm just... - No. I was nowhere near a card game.
all right?
all right. I'll wait for you.
I mean, the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team.
I think the most important thing is to be respectful to the judges but not obsequious.
now, wait a minute. Make sure to be deferential.
gene Marinacci won't buy deferential.
Oh, it's Gene, is it?
well, I knew there was a reason why you were lead counsel,
and use the right cites. Use book cites, not Lexis.
Hi, Jo.
long time. - Knish. How are you?
the same.
I don't mean to interrupt you future magistrates and noblemen, but l, uh, I need a word.
okay. Excuse me.
sorry.
I'll act as lead counsel. - It's all right, Kelly.
we were gonna take a break anyway.
coffee time.
the guy's a cheat. He always has been.
right now, he's over at Chesterfield's, ruining your reputation...
with every lousy second he deals.
shit. I told him. Did anybody else see him?
nobody saw... I heard it. Snapping sound gave it away.
I didn't know him, I might not have noticed.
you want one? - Did you give him the office?
I tried to warn him, but he looked right through me.
all right, I'll go get him. - No, no, no. He's okay now.
most of those Georges are at the tail end of a 36-hour session.
they can't see straight. Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
but if he's still there when Roman and Maurice start their game, he's gonna wish he was still inside.
I'm gonna go get him.
[Mike Narrating] Amarillo Slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time, held to his father's maxim...
gotta bet my jacks.
this is a lesson Worm's never bothered to learn.
[Speaking Russian] - Hey, guys.
english only at the table, no Russian.
what are you talking about? - What am I talking about?
if you want to see this seventh card, you're gonna stop speaking fucking Sputnik.
Oh, da, motherfucker. - You're worried we might work together.
I'm sure you're just talking about perogies...
there's the river, down and dirty.
I think you got that ace, Roman, but I'm gonna pay for it.
okay, well, I got the jacks. Come on.
ace. - Oh, you got it. - And six.
wow, two pair. But I got sevens, too, though.
with my jacks. - Motherfucker, slow rolling me like that.
but you made me for the sevens, Maurice. You're a player.
fuck! - Hey, come on! Don't be a fucking baby.
Hey, Maurice. - [Together] Hey.
Hey, Mike, you here to play? Come on, we need some new blood.
they're putting a fucking bracelet on me tomorrow for four months.
I already stuck two racks. - Well, have a good rest, man.
can I talk to you for a second, Cosmonaut?
no, man, I'm on a roll. This is a very emotional game.
gotta do it.
[Speaking In Russian] - I counted these.
leave it. It's fine.
[Speaking In Russian]
what's going on? - Where are you at?
I was pumped up eight G's. I was ready to go on a run when you came along.
all right, listen. - Hey, wait, I want a hot dog.
you're in town for five fucking minutes, you already got a sign on your back.
Oh, what, that fucking Knish rat me out?
you gotta stop listening to that guy, man.
he sees all the angles, but he doesn't have the balls to play one.
Hey, that guy hasn't had to work in 15 years, Worm.
you don't think that's work, what he does?
grinding it out on his fucking leather ass? No, thank you.
I thought so, too, all right? Now I know what real work is.
speaking of which, are you even gonna get a job?
or are you just gonna go back to printing those credit cards?
huh? You gonna go away again? - I wasn't printing.
I was distributing. Distributing. It's different, okay?
second of all, I'm never going back there.
stop worrying so much, okay?
come here.
I just want you to think long term, all right? Be smart.
every place in Manhattan, they all keep books, all right?
if you get listed as a mechanic, then not only are you gonna get the shit kicked out of you, you're not gonna get a fucking game anywhere in New York.
it's stupid. It's just bad business.
look, this is what I love about you... you think about the big picture.
that's great, okay? But it's not me.
I don't play the game straight up, and then if I lose, go get some real work or something, okay?
I see a mark, I take him down.
that's what I do. That's the way I live.
I know. Listen, you're the guy who taught me all the angles.
but I'm not the guy with my nose open right now. - Aw, come on.
I'm not gonna preach to you, but those two guys in there, they're not rabbits.
Roman and Maurice? They're Russian outfit guys.
not as bad as KGB, but you don't want to be fucking with those guys.
with those fake Versace shirts and shit? Jesus.
look, you still got time. Just go back in there, right?
lose their fucking money back to them, all right?
just make it look good. Just catch a run of real shitty cards.
give it back to them. - I can't. I can't.
I gotta put some scratch together, man. I gotta get something going.
then go out to suburbia, man. Play in a fucking dentist's game, okay?
go to Swan Meadow, play in the golf pro game. - That's an idea.
I'll definitely do that, but I can't dump to these guys.
all right, whatever, whatever.
meet me at Stromboli's in half an hour, all right?
I can't, I gotta go. I have a meeting.
and then I gotta go to fucking Queens. I gotta load the truck.
Jesus, man, you're such a fucking working man now. I'm never gonna see you.
make it look good. I mean it, make it look good. - You know me.
so, how'd you do? - Ah, so-so.
six thousand, two thousand.
Oh, hold on. Two more.
all right, so it's ten grand total, take back the two we lent you, give you the white meat.
you know what?
why don't you give me all of it?
usually, credit players only leave with their profit.
otherwise, the juice starts five points a week on Mike.
Oh, okay. We'll owe you.
[Sighs]
Hey. I've been looking all over for you.
didn't want to be found.
you know, Petrovsky waited and waited. So did the rest of the group.
I don't care about the meeting. Do you even know why I left this morning?
I found that gangster's roll in your pocket. - It's not what you think.
it's not what you think. - Who do you think I am? You lie right to my face?
look, old days at least you never lied.
you lost everything, but at least you never lied.
Jo, this wasn't even a real game. This was like Wiffle Ball.
can you lose your rent playing Wiffle Ball? - No, I couldn't lose.
that's the point. - No, Mike, you can lose.
I watched you, I stood by you while you lost everything before.
why does this still seem like gambling to you?
why do you think the same five guys make it to the final table...
at the World Series of Poker every single year?
what are they, the luckiest guys in Las Vegas?
it's a skill game, Jo. - Great. So why'd you have to lie to me?
because I knew you wouldn't understand. - Understand what?
last night, I sat down at this card table.
I felt alive for the first time since I got busted at KGB's joint, okay?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table.
no, what... - What's that supposed to make me understand?
[Sighs]
[Rock]
midnight, getting uptight Where are you - You said you need me but it's quarter to 2: 00 - I heard you was out.
Hey, fucking Grama. How you doing?
I was just thinking about you. You know, I could use you. - Oh, yeah?
see me in, like, two weeks. I'll put you back on the payroll.
well, I got some bad news for ya, Worm. I'm out on my own now.
Really? - Yeah.
go figure.
there were a lot of angry people when you went away. A lot of people were mad.
I know, Grama, that's why I'm trying to put together a roll here.
a lot of people coming up to me, asking if I could help, asking if I knew where to find you.
Hey, Jesus! Come on! Take it easy.
it's just a friend of mine.
Hey! Easy, easy, easy, easy. God!
get the fuck outta here. What did I say?
Hey, man, take it easy! - Get the fuck outta here!
okay. Here's what I'm thinking.
instead of you owing 15 grand spread out to five guys, you owe 25 to me.
what? Where the fuck do you get off? 25 grand?
where the fuck do I get off?
[Grunts] Ohh.
here's how it is. 25 grand, and the juice is still running.
Jesus Christ.
what the fuck are you doing, man? You were my partner.
no, no, I was your lackey.
but I learned a few things, Worm.
I consolidated your outstanding debt.
[Scoffs] Where'd you get the scratch for that?
you've been rolling fags in the Village again. [Grunts]
still a wise ass. Unbelievable. - [Spits]
what I did was go partners with an old friend of yours.
Teddy KGB backed me.
bullshit. Bullshit.
[Spits] Teddy's got plenty of goons.
because as soon as he heard your name, he became real excited for the prospect.
what, so you bought me up, Grama? [Scoffs]
Yeah, got a real sweet deal, too. 30 cents on the dollar.
there's not a lot of faith in you out there in the business community.
not exactly. I don't have to tell you my collection methods.
I'll scrape something together, and I'll find you this week.
that's just what I figured. - No, no, no.
so I'm gonna take what you got on you right now. - Here. Fine.
have yourself a ball, okay?
[Sighs, Chuckles]
[Groans] God!
Damn! [Groans]
excuse me.
mind if I sit?
Michael.
please, please. Sit, sit.
that was a nifty trick the other night.
it was wonderful. - [Chuckles] Thank you.
Marinacci and the D. A. were ready to cut cards for your services at that point.
[Chuckles]
of course, it was an altogether different trick, that disappearing act...
you pulled today at your group's meeting.
Yeah. Well, I figure I owe you an explanation. - Ah, not to me.
I'm sure there's a good reason you left.
you'll just have to work harder. Prepare.
[Chuckles] - And smooth things out with the others.
right. Yeah. Okay.
okay, well, thanks. - Stay. Take a drink.
what are you drinking? - Gin. Always gin.
here you go. - Thanks, dear.
thank you.
I know a magician doesn't divulge his secrets, but...
[Chuckles] I'm no magician.
well, if it wasn't magic, how did you know what everyone held?
it's a combination of things.
um, I was watching when the cards came out.
that's... That's just an old habit with me, like breathing.
you watch the cards.
I watch the cards also, but I watch the players reacting to the cards.
that's how I knew the D. A. made his two pair, and Judge Kaplan missed the flush.
I was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
their faces tell you everything. - You watch the man.
l... I never knew you had to calculate so much at cards.
all right, here's the thing. You only play premium hands.
you only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
if it's good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right?
I mean, tight, but aggressive. And I do mean aggressive. That's your style, Professor.
I mean, you gotta... you gotta think of it as a war.
you are officially never invited to our game again. [Chuckles]
I don't blame you. Put a guy like me in a game like that, the cards don't even matter.
I'll play it blind.
Michael,
for generations, men of my family have been rabbis.
in Israel, before that in Europe.
it was to be my calling. I was quite a prodigy.
the pride of my yeshiva.
the elders said I had a 40-year-old's understanding...
of the midrash by the time I was 12.
but by the time I was 13,
I knew I could never be a rabbi.
why not?
because for all I understood of the Talmud,
I never saw God there.
I mean, people were counting on me.
but yours is a respectable profession.
not to my family.
my parents were destroyed, devastated by my decision.
my father sent me away to New York...
to live with distant cousins.
eventually, l... I found my place, my life's work.
I immersed myself fully, I studied the minutiae,
I learned everything I could about the law.
and did your parents get over it? - No.
I always hoped that I would find...
some way to change their minds, but...
they were inconsolable.
my father never spoke to me again.
if you had to do it all over again, would you make the same choices?
what choice?
the last thing I took away from the yeshiva is this...
our destiny chooses us.
Hey. L'chayim.
Hey.
Hey, where you been? I've been freezing my ass off.
what happened? - Ah, ran into a door. Don't worry about it.
tone down what, motherfucker? - Great.
never mind. - [Laughs]
when you become a big shot lawyer, could you find us an elevator building?
shut up.
what, did you get robbed?
um, not exactly.
wait, wait, wait. Did she split on you?
[Scoffs] Oh, God.
I always told her she'd be a good card player.
know exactly when to release a shitty hand. - Come on, Mike, forget that.
no, she was a good... I knew it. I fucking knew it.
[Sighs] It's depressing.
you can't trust them. You can't trust them at all.
I mean, look at you. You domesticated yourself for this girl.
you took yourself out of the life. You walked the fucking line for her.
it's just like the saying says, you know?
in the poker game of life, women are the rake.
they are the fucking rake. - What the fuck are you talking about?
what saying?
I don't know. But there oughta be one.
you know what cheers me up when I'm feeling shitty? - What?
rolled up aces over kings.
that right? - Yeah.
yeah? - Stacks and towers of checks I can't even see over.
playing all night, high-limit Hold' Em at the Taj.
where the sand turns to gold. - Fuck it, let's go.
don't tease me. - Let's play some fucking cards.
[Mike Narrating] The poker room at the Mirage in Vegas...
is the center of the poker universe.
the legends consider it their office.
every couple of days a new millionaire shows up...
wanting to beat a world champion.
usually they go home with nothing but a story.
down here, the millionaires are scarce or they're playing craps,
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the New York rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
Hey, hey, why don't you warm up a seat for me. I'll catch up with you.
what? - Look.
I got certain needs I gotta attend to, okay? - Hey, good.
I mean, I'm overdue. - Good, man, hey, I was starting to wonder about you.
I thought, maybe, you know, the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you.
Hey, Mikey! - Hey. - Hey, Mike.
this is beautiful. Welcome to the Chesterfield south.
ho! - Changing $500.
come all the way to Atlantic City just to see your mugs, huh?
twice in one week.
for someone who don't play, you spend a lot of time in card rooms.
this is what I like to see, huh?
Mike McDermott where he belongs... sitting with the scumbags.
telling jokes, dragging the occasional pot.
Occasional? Yeah, like my ex-wife occasionally went out with other men.
forget her, Face. I was actually gonna try and make some real money tonight.
but in honor of Mike's alley-like return to the ring,
I'll sit with you all for a while.
Hey, don't do us any favors, Knish.
I raise. You know, if we wanted to take each other's rolls, [Mike Narrating] These two have no idea...
what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure...
why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games...
they've played their whole lives?
all the luck in the world isn't gonna change things for these guys.
they're simply overmatched.
we're not playing together, but then again, we're not playing against each other either.
they wear their tells like signs around their necks.
facial tics, nervous fingers.
a hand over a mouth.
the way a cigarette is smoked.
little unconscious gestures that reveal the cards in their hands.
we catch everything.
if a fish acts strong, he's bluffing.
good to see ya. Glad you're out.
number's changed, of course.
lotta games this weekend, so you're gonna need the number.
I'll give you a ring. - Hey, Worm?
do they allow people like you in places like this?
Zagosh, when you get yourself a job, then you can be my fucking P. O.
how about that?
now, let's get started, shall we?
we've got the news that the men arranged in ages from 14 to 19.
unfortunately, they all were killed in the subsequent crash of the plane.
and their names are being withheld until notification of next kin.
now we switch our live action reporter to the federal courthouse with the latest on the Manheim-Stonehaven prison case.
we've just gotten the word that the federal judge has issued his opinion.
we don't have all the details, but apparently Oscar Manheim, the notorious life-term prisoner who has been welded in his cell for three years has won his civil right's suit against the officials at Stonehaven.
stay with us for details.
ln a few minutes we'll be back with comment from Associate Warden Ranken.
Yeah! l say yeah!
Hey, Rogers.
rogers, look here, man.
what's up? - Manny's won his case？
the courts ordered to let him out of the hole.
great. That's great. - Yeah. Uh, Warden Rankenis gonna be on the tube soon.
let the dudes in the cell blocks hear him talk that shit he talks.
put channel nine into the speakers, man.
Hey, you got shit in your veins or what, man?
l was holding my mud around here, when you were peeing in your diapers.
all right. They'll all hear it. - Fucking A, man!
l say, Rogers-- Thanks, man. Yeah!
nobody wants the prison to be a playground. We all want criminals punished, but don't you think you shocked the public conscience by keeping a man welded in a cell for three years?
well, a man, yes, but Manheim is an animal.
he broke out of here twice, he's robbed banks...
he-- he's a killer.
he doesn't care about your life, my life or even his own life.
fuck your mother!
hear that trash, Ranken!
fat-faced faggot!
somebody shoot that pansy vegetable!
Manny is our president!
he believes in nothing. He's capable of anything.
l've worked in prisons for 26 years.
cons with strings of murders are all afraid of Manheim.
Jesus Henry Christ! Yeah!
burn it!
Hey, Jonah!
man, he did it, man. - Yeah.
he really fucking did it!
Yeah. That's good, man. l'll see you in the yard.
well, if, as you say, he is an animal...
then why do all the other prisoners love him so much?
well, um...
because they're mostly animals just like he is.
they wanna do whatever they want, no holds barred.
rogers, crack that door! - Fuck you and the horse you rode in on!
open this goddamn door!
this is no country club, you know what l mean?
Stonehaven's average sentence is 22 years.
turn that fucker off!
Hey, Manny! We got visitors!
on your feet, convict.
on your feet.
l've got a federal court order to let you out of the hole.
l could ask for a stay during the appeal.
l can last nine more months.
l could stand on my head nine months.
how about l kick your brains in? - Fuck you. Do it alone.
l don't dirty my hands on scum like you.
l'm gonna let you out in the yard.
and l hope you make a move so l can stop your clock. That's a promise.
Yeah, a promise. You promised to keep me in this hole the rest of my life.
kept you in here for three years. That's long enough for me, kid.
whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
we'll see.
please, try again and l'll send you out of here in plastic.
you do what you have to do, and l will too.
whatever happens happens.
call the machine shop. Bring him to the yard!
that's your mama's fart hole.
the bitch is loud.
you're all punks hiding there, yelling in the dark.
let me tell you where you assholes stand.
first, there's God...
then the Warden...
then my guards...
then the dogs out there in the kennel...
and finally you:
pieces of human waste,
no good to yourselves or anybody else.
Yeah. Here he is, man.
the big man.
Hey, Manny. Homeboy.
it's me, home. - l'm blind, man. l can't see.
here you go, man.
let's go. Should be time for lockup.
Hey, let me get that for you.
what's been happening these past three years?
just what you know, brother. l went out and got a fresh new 30 year sentence.
couldn't make it without me. - Couldn't make it without the money.
never did know how to rob a bank.
don't worry about it. l'll get you out.
not in this winter, you won't.
l won't? - Kiss my white ass!
Hey, what's the hell?
he's a pretty good youngster. Besides, he pushes the laundry cart.
welcome home, brother.
welcome home, man.
one, two
nine!
the kid can fight.
that's worth about two dead flies.
Yeah, but you shouldn't judge people hard, man.
l'm gonna take a piss.
officer, this guy! He's grabbing my ass!
you kept him in the hole too long!
take that punk out! Take him out!
l got him.
jab! Punch!
what are you doing?
come on, young man. Young man, back off!
and still the welterweight champion...
buck Logan.
l'm sorry, Manny! Ranken made me do it!
come on, punk. - You're wrong!
show me something.
come on, Manny. - Come here.
think l'm that stupid? - No!
come on. l got something for you. - l'm sorry, Manny.
stay back! - You wanted me?
you want my blood? Here.
there. There's my blood.
come on, scum.
you wanna shoot me? Shoot me!
shoot the kid, sucker. Here l am!
come on!
shoot the kid! Don't send no punk to do your business for you!
l'm right here. Come on. Shoot me!
l'm going nowhere. Come on!
come on.
make your move!
Hey, sucker. You show me shit!
no, no! He's mine!
get off! Hey, get off! Let me go!
l'll kill you!
l'll tear your fucking head off!
Oh, my God! Can't someone do something about
mandatory lockup! All prisoners in their cell.
all prisoners in their cell.
mandatory lockup.
you look terrible.
l won't be dead.
they released me to the yard.
he wants to kill you for sure.
he's pushing me.
he wants me to jump the wall. He's pushing me.
lt's 30 below out there.
l'm going. You coming?
are you coming? l'll wait for you.
no, brother.
this is home.
l run things around here.
l can't take these ass-kickings like l used to.
l can't make it.
then get on, brother, and do it.
l will.
whatever happens, don't let 'em bring you back here.
Yeah.
l'll find something.
nice join in the sun.
the bull's on the stairs.
let's split!
have fun. - You too.
there's gonna be convicts watching you, brother.
don't let them ice you. It'll break a lot of soul.
you know, you got a following. And l love you.
coming through!

Oh, man.

Oh, man.

only two other guys even got out once and you beat that sucker three times.
Yeah.
Manny. Hey, don't you know...
Ranken is pissed off, man.

and the dudes, man. Oh, Manny. The dudes.
they love it.
freeze, sucker! - Hey, man. Nobody's gonna hear us.

you don't treat me like a punk, okay?
well, you don't like it? - No.
well, you're a prizefighter.
kick my ass.
make your move.
l'm not gonna give you no reason to kill me.

l don't wanna go to a parking lot.
Hey, look. Look here.

there's my limousine to Broadway right there.
Why?
why that one?
because l want it.
we're moving, man.
thank you, Jesus. Shit.
shit, we make a hell of a team, don't we, man?
don't we?
Hey, that looks like Al's train!
what in hell is he doing out there?
he looks sick! Damn!
Damn! Al!
better call the paramedics.
something's wrong.
take it easy, Manny.
they know what they're doing.
Pulasky! Hello, Pulasky!
Pulasky. - This is Cassidy.
al fell off the engine. He's dead.
you've got a runaway coming your way on track two!
what did you say? - Four units.
stop them, for God's sakes!
switch it to track 11.
l can't! It's too late!
central. Damn you, Central!
emergency!
pick up the goddamn phone!
Ooh, boy, would l like to have some of this here for dessert!
to go. Hey, Ruby. Why don't you answer the phone?
Hey, come on, Ruby! You pretty enough.
Oh, shit. Your ass is so lazy. l don't know why the fuck you got a job here.
uh, yeah. Central, Dave Prince speaking.
this is Pulasky. Give me Barstow. - Yeah. Hold it, Pulasky.
hold it, my ass! Where the hell is Barstow?
we got an emergency! A big emergency!
we got four unmanned units! - What?
l said we got runaway units! Four of them! They're headed this way!
ruby, go get Frank now. Run! Come on! Goddamn it, get moving now!
we got an emergency here!
hold it, Pulasky, okay? He's coming.
lt's the phone, Franky.
Frank, get your ass out here, man. We've got a runaway on 11!
central, where are you? Goddamn it!
l'm here, Pulasky. What seems to be the trouble?
we got a runaway on track 11. Goddamn engineer fell off the train!
you sure nobody else is on board? - How the hell do l know?
lt's already gone about nine miles, and it's increasing speed!
nine miles already! - That's right!
what the hell are we gonna do? - Hey, look! Be quiet!
will you calm down? - Okay.
look, l want you to line her on the main line on track one.
okay. - You got it?
right. - l'll take things over from there.
right, Frank.
shit!
this sucker is flying, Manny.
we should have hooked into those freight cars by now.
smile, man. We're free. Yeah!
you think so, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, Manny. l want you to know l'm proud to be hooked up with you, partner.
look, kid.
l appreciate what you done, but you are no kind of partner to me.
don't be clowning yourself. l don't like it.
look at your tattoos. They'll look really nice...
in a swimming pool in Acapulco.
what did l do to deserve all this shit you're slinging at me, man?
you don't know nothing from nothing. Being around me is really stupid.
l'm at war with the world and everybody in it.
and you're gonna get hurt.
l don't get you, man. - Well, rapos usually are pretty dumb.
Rapo! l ain't no goddamn rapo, man!
Where'd you get that from?
lt's on your rap sheet. Busted for rape two years ago.
shit, man!
that was a statutory rape.
she was 15 and l was older than her.
that's good.
what's wrong with you? You dying for company?
what? You expect somebody to be watching or something?
l expect nothing.
she's gaining speed real fast. She'll hit your territory in no time.
the brakes are burning up. - Are you nuts?
the brakes on the runaway burnt off. - How in the fuck did that happen?
didn't they check it?
the throttle must be iammed wide open in run eight.
Oh, damn!
there she goes. - Oh, God, man. What are we gonna do?
l got a wife and two kids, man. l ain't got no money like Michael Jackson.
calm down. The system is foolproof. - l need money. Shit!
Why? Because you designed it?
that l did, my boy. And l know how to use it.
now let me show you.
we'd better fly over the highway.
are you serious?
Jesus, those scum could never make it this far out.
we're up here freezing our asses off for nothing.
Hey, shut your mouth and keep your eyes on the glacier.
this guy-- l'm telling you.
he'd do the same thing l would do.
Hey, l iust thought about that bank that you ripped off in Reno.
l was in reform school. Man, that was so fucking great.
two million simoleons. Man, that was hot.
two million is a slight exaggeration.
the insurance company-- standard procedure.
Yeah, but it was still fucking great, man. Tell you what
l know this iug outside Frisco good for half a million.
they had a payroll for S&H Sugar, and S&H Sugar is a big outfit, man.
Yeah, that's what l've been dreaming about.
a really good score, you know what l mean?
and l'm gonna party.
Yeah. Shit, l'm gonna go to Mardi Gras.
l'm gonna go to Vegas, and l'm gonna go with enough money in my hip pocket to catch 'em fine bitches, you know what l mean?
you know, l've spent almost every night of my life dreaming about this kind of shit.
dreaming? - Yeah.
dreaming.
that's bullshit.
you're not gonna do nothing like that.
l'll tell you what you're gonna do!
you're gonna get a iob. That's what you're gonna do.
you're gonna get a little iob-- some job a convict can get...
like scraping off trays at a cafeteria or cleaning out toilets.
and you're gonna hold on to that job like gold...
because it is gold!
let me tell you, Jack. That is gold.
you listening to me?
and when that man walks in at the end of the day...
and he comes to see how you done...
you ain't gonna look in his eyes.
you're gonna look at the floor because you don't wanna see that fear in his eyes when you jump up and grab his face and slam him to the floor and make him scream and cry for his life.
so you look right at the floor, Jack. Pay attention to this, motherfucker.
and then he's gonna look around the room-- see how you done.
and he's gonna say, " Oh, you missed a little spot over there.
jeez, you didn't get this one here. What about this little bitty spot? "
and you're gonna suck all that pain inside you and you're gonna clean that spot.
and you're gonna clean that spot, until you get that shining clean.
and on Friday, you'll pick up your paycheck.
and if you could do that you could be president of Chase Manhattan-- corporations.
lf you could do that.
not me, man.
l wouldn't do that kind of shit. l'd rather be in jail.
more's the pity, youngster. More the pity.
could you do that kind of shit?
l wish l could.
l wish l could.
central, Central. Eastbound 12...
eastbound 12.
Barstow here.
why did you stop us? - There's a runaway coming at you.
hear me? Number 12, answer me!
l don't see any runaway.
lf you were close enough to see her, you'd be dead. Get it?
she's about four miles away.
now l want you to pull onto track two at once.
repeat, at once. - Oh, my God!
no. Are you serious? - Hey, Ruby. What's going on?
Hey, you can't go in there right now. - Come on, Ruby.
that eastbound 12 is crawling.
who's the incompetent bastard on her? He better get in the clear fast!
Oh, man.
Oh, Manny.
Oh, man. - l told you. Didn't l tell you?
l told you something was fucked up.
maybe we're on some express run. - Wake up, Wacko!
we just blew the caboose to hell without even slowing down!
something screwy is going on here. Look!
look! All the handrails are gone! Maybe the engineer has croaked.
Hey, man. Engineers do not just croak!
why don't the whistle ever blow, huh?
what are you, out of your mind?
l just wanted to see if it worked. You said the engineer was croaked.
let go.
you think this is some cops and robbers game.
Hey, man. You picked the train!
you're right. - Yeah.
state police calling Chopper One.
come in, please.
we have information regarding escaped prisoners.
Ranken, that's your radio.
railroad security called. They found some prison clothes in a switch yard.
looks like prisoner Logan's.
how'd they get so far? - What did l tell you?
tell 'em l'll be there in ten minutes.
have some officers ready.
Roger, state police. We're on our way.
let's have some fun.
maybe we just ought to clear out of here.
l mean, maybe we ought to just jump for it. What do you say?
we can break our necks any time we want.
Yeah, that makes sense.
let's find out what's happening. - How are we gonna do that?
go up front and find out. - Yeah.
find out what's happening.
go up front and find out what the hell is going on.
l want that, man.
for what?
tuck that in on you someplace.
all right.
and wait till l give you the signal before you attack.
Yeah.
Hello, Mr. MacDonald.
don't tell anyone about the runaway.
we don't want to panic the passengers.
besides, we've got the company's reputation to uphold.
what's the latest on that train?
lt went straight through the caboose at Granville 12.
well, anyone hurt?
nobody. What's the story on the engineer?
he had a heart attack. Old fart.
he made everyone bananas trying to keep that engine from going to scrap.
get that. What's the speed?
about 70.
Hey, Barstow. Why don't you stop her?
you put the system in.
cost the company 4. 5 million. - Listen, Eddie...
it's designed for the efficient dispatching of trains when manned not to stop them when they're unmanned.
the brake shoes have burned off. The overspeed control must have gotten screwed up from the collision!
but don't worry, Eddy.
we'll do all we can to avoid any more casualties.
you haven't forgotten about the Seneca Bridge.
Dave, could you get us some coffee. Come on!
what about the bridge? - l'm taking care of it.
what about the bridge? - l'd like to remind you.
Seneca is an old bridge. - So what? Are you gonna get the coffee?
what the...?
what the fuck!
fuck.
Hello?
fuck.
Hello, Seth.
I wanna play a game.
right now, you're feeling helpless.
this is the same helplessness... - Help!
...you've bestowed onto others.
but now it's onto you.
some call this karma. I call it justice.
now, you served five years...
...of what should have been a life sentence for murder.
a technicality gave you freedom...
...but it inhibited you from understanding the impact of taking a life.
today, I offer you true freedom.
in 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop far enough to touch your body.
within sixty seconds it will cut you in half.
to avoid the pendulum, all you have to do is destroy the things that have killed:
your hands.
you must insert your hands...
...and push the buttons to start the devices before you.
your bones will be crushed to dust.
will you destroy the things that have taken life in order to save one, Seth?
make your choice.
no.
it was an accident!
please.
okay. Fuck you.
okay. Okay. Okay.
I did what I was supposed to do.
STRAHM: Let me see your hands. Let me see your fucking hands.
where is my daughter? You...
Jesus.
jigsaw: Hello, Agent Strahm.
if you're hearing this, then you've finally found what you've been looking for.
but is the discovery of my body enough?
or will your insatiable hunger to uncover the truth push you deeper into the abyss?
heed my warning: Do not proceed.
for this room can either be your sanctuary or it can be your grave.
the choice is yours.
fuck you.
Hey!
help!
man 1: Go! Go!
hoffman: You're okay.
Where's my dad? - He's gonna be okay.
Where's my mom? Where's my mom?
FISK: Hoffman. MAN: I got it. I got it.
FISK: You okay to walk?
what the hell, man? What happened? Where's Rigg?
tried to help. He didn't make it.
nobody made it.
woman: We got a live one.
Hello?
right away.
ms. Tuck.
have a seat.
it's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman.
why am I here?
I represent your ex-husband, John.
in the event of his death, I was instructed to contact you.
you can understand my surprise when I found out who he really was.
John left something for you.
if you're watching this, Jill, I'm long gone from this world.
you are my heart, you always have been. You always will be.
I'm not going to try to explain my actions of late.
suffice it to say that I find it difficult to forgive myself...
...for what happened at the clinic.
I permitted, indeed, encouraged your decisions regarding the people there.
I saw danger and l... I should have acted sooner.
I'm leaving you a box today, and its contents are of grave importance.
even though you and I don't always see eye to eye on everything...
...I deeply believe in you and I believe that you will know...
...what to do with these materials.
chief: I wanna thank you all for coming here today.
and I'd like to be the first to say...
...that the Jigsaw murders are over.
the officers who gave their lives are being honored here today.
but today I'd like to offer a special honor...
...to the detective who's been on this case right from the beginning...
...who proved through hard work and dedication...
...that the people who died did not die in vain.
today we honor the newly promoted Detective Lieutenant...
man: Congratulations.
thank you so much.
thank you. Thank you very much.
uh, ahem...
throughout this ordeal, if we've learned anything it's that...
...human life is sacred.
and we've learned that every day...
...life should be cherished.
justice...
...is the backbone to every peaceful society.
and I believe that true justice has been served.
detective Hoffman, you're wanted at the hospital.
it's about Agent Perez.
thank you.
jigsaw: Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome to the world that you have long studied.
heed my warning, Agent Perez.
your next move is critical.
open the door. PEREZ: What is that?
I got you.
I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez.
she said your name, you know.
the last thing she said was "Detective Hoffman.
why'd she say that? Why'd she say your name?
I don't know. - No?
how'd you walk out of that building?
how did you?
on a gurney with a fucking hole in my throat.
look at you.
couple of scratches and a story about how your arm straps broke.
jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.
is this you theorizing again? Because Jigsaw's dead.
I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about you and your whole crooked department.
my department's gone. They're all dead. There's no one left.
besides you.
been chasing Jigsaw from the beginning...
...and I got him.
so unless you've got something else to say...
...back the fuck off.
read the papers. I saved that little girl.
sorry about Agent Perez.
shouldn't you be resting?
I'm fine, Erickson.
no, you're not, Peter. That's why I put you on medical leave.
I was supposed to die in that trap.
you never should have been there without backup.
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.
you're no longer handling the case, Peter.
what?
read it.
over a dozen dead bodies were recovered at the scene, two of which were cops.
Jigsaw's dead, how many lives did I inevitably save?
by endangering yourself and others.
you're off the case.
on whose orders?
mine.
I'm sorry, Peter. It's over.
Oh, my God.
Oh...
what is this? - Hey, don't move.
what did you do to me?
I didn't do anything.
it's Jigsaw. - What?
MALLICK: I knew this was gonna happen to me. This is what he does.
no, it's not Jigsaw.
he's dead.
haven't you watched TV lately?
LUBA: Yeah, well, whoever it is...
...they're watching us.
to make sure we follow the rules.
which are what? CHARLES: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
unless you want your head to pop off like a dandelion.
how do you know that? - Because I have eyes.
one pull-pin starts the timer for all of us.
you won't wanna do that unless you know how it works, now, would you?
you're starting to freak me out, dude.
jigsaw: Hello, and welcome.
from birth, you've all been given the advantages of few others.
yet through poor moral decisions...
...you've used these advantages to selfishly further...
...only yourselves at the expense of others.
well, today this singular way of thinking will be put to the test.
today, five will become one, with a common goal of survival.
you are all connected.
a cable runs through your collar devices.
it can be pulled so tight...
...that you will be decapitated on the mounted razors.
the only way to remove the collar is with the keys from the glass boxes...
...on the pedestals before you.
however, if one of you moves to retrieve a key...
...the 60-second timer will begin for you all.
in choosing how to react to this situation...
...your lifelong instincts will tell you to do one thing...
...but I implore you to do the opposite.
let the games begin.
somebody has to die.
LUBA: No, no, no, it says, "Don't listen to your instincts.
that means don't go for the keys. - You fucking nuts?
how are we supposed to live if we don't?
it's testing our endurance. - We gotta move, babe.
that timer's connected to those jars.
it didn't say anything about those jars.
they could be nothing. ASHLEY: They're nail bombs.
homemade, probably C-4.
how the fuck do you know that?
she's a fire inspector. She's seen all kinds of demented shit.
how do you know me?
Hey, man, she's asking you a question. How do you know her?
how do you know her? Answer me!
look, let's just keep our cool.
okay, we can figure this out. - We're all here for a reason.
okay, and we're all connected, as the message said.
we just need to...
what did you do? - You go first.
it said that we were all born with advantages.
right? That means we're all from money.
I'm not. - And neither am I.
Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.
well, then, what does it mean?
we did something wrong with an advantage from birth.
that doesn't have to mean money. - What are you not telling us? Huh?
you know about her, what do you know about the rest of us?
would you fucking talk to me?
relax. - I am fucking relaxed.
it's a game, tweaker.
get it? The less you know about me, the better.
the reason why you fucked up your charmed existence...
...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?
fuck you. Fuck you.
been playing with matches again, have we?
fuck all of you and your fucking plan.
unless you wanna be shredded when those bombs go off...
...I suggest we move on.
what are you doing?
being smart.
special Agent Strahm's office.
this is Detective Hoffman. Is Agent Strahm available?
he's not, but I can connect you to Special Agent Erickson.
he's handling all inquiries.
please.
ERICKSON: You've reached the voice mail box of Agent Erickson.
please leave a message.
Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman.
I needed to discuss something with Agent Strahm...
...but I can't seem to track him down.
could you give me a call? It would be greatly appreciated.
there you are.
sister.
cowan, take this to analysis. - Right away, sir.
what are you doing here?
just grabbing some stuff from the office. I'm taking your advice.
taking some time off, huh? - Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know.
Mm-hm.
you know, I'll keep in touch. I'll see you around.
we got another body. Looks like another Jigsaw victim.
you up for this? - Yeah.
FISK: Typical bio. Murder convict.
served five years, just released last month.
hoffman: I know him.
his name's Seth Baxter.
my sister's ex-boyfriend.
this is the guy that murdered your sister?
he was sentenced to 25 years. Got it reduced to five on a technicality.
well, then I'd say justice was served.
you killed him. Made it look like a Jigsaw trap.
I got you.
charles: Not yet. - Don't close the door. It'll set off the timer.
MALLICK: Do you know that for sure? BRIT: Educated guess.
what we need to do is figure out who everyone is.
okay, well, we know that the dead woman worked for the fire department.
not anymore. She got canned a month ago.
how the fuck do you...? How the fuck do you know that?
you're responsible for this? She had her fucking head cut off!
I'm closing the door.
I'm gonna close the fucking door! - Just be quiet.
please.
what's your story?
I work for the Department of City Planning.
married? Kids? - No, and no.
your turn. - You're not gonna tell them about Daddy?
my dad is Richard Gibbs. - The owner of the Cougars?
he's been trying to build a new stadium for years. Little did he know...
...all he had to do is wait for his daughter to get a job in City Planning.
and you. What about you?
what sort of shady shit have you been up to?
I'm a senior V. P. For a real estate development company.
so you're boring too. Hmm?
the Marshvard Group. Yeah, you can't get a permit in this town...
...without going through the Department of City Planning.
right? - No, you can't.
what about you?
uh...
no wife.
no kids that I know of. No job. - Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised?
I'm so fucking sick of your self-righteousness.
it's your turn.
I'm an investigative journalist for The Herald.
herald? That's your accomplishment? You work for a gossip rag?
bite your fucking tongue.
what the hell are in those jars?
let's do this fucking thing before the bombs go off.
MALLICK: Fuck!
jigsaw: Hello, and welcome to the next lesson.
these walls hold four chambers.
these chambers are for safety.
however, to access them, a key is needed.
but only three of the keys will fit the locks.
these keys are in the glass jars hanging from the ceiling.
move quickly, though, because when the clock ticks down...
...the explosives in the corners of the room will detonate.
with only three points of safety, which of you will be the odd man out?
make your choice.
fuck.
fuck, it's blank. I need a shape.
get your hands off that, you're not going anywhere.
stop it! CHARLES: Get a clue, you fucking bitch.
it's survival of the fittest.
BRIT: Blank.
blank.
shit.
I got it. Got it.
Yes.
better luck next time, rich boy.
survival of the fittest, my ass!
wait.
everything all right with Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case?
Yeah. - Good.
Fisk. You keep me posted.
will do. - Good.
after Seth, you were involved in every investigation.
when did you first meet Jigsaw?
woman: Stop it, stop it!
don't!
Heel! Heel, I said!
don't provoke him. Asshole!
Jesus Christ. Come on, Peewee. Come on.
come on, Peewee. - Peewee.
shit.
do you mind?
hoffman: Going up? - Yes, thank you.
what floor are you going to?
I think we're both going to the same place.
you know why you're here, don't you?
they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
but I find it somewhat distasteful...
...to be given credit for work that's not mine.
especially inferior work.
like you, I know what it's like to lose family.
I know what it's like not to be able to protect loved ones.
it's a powerless feeling.
I wouldn't do that.
hair trigger.
what do you see?
Hm?
vengeance can change a person. Make you into something...
...you never thought you were capable of being.
but unlike you, I've never killed anyone.
I give people a chance. - You call this a chance?
we'll see.
our game's just begun. - Our game? You don't even know me.
Oh.
I know you. I know about your sister.
I know how you cared for her.
I know she was your only family.
hoffman: Leave me alone.
No!
John: You sit in bars until closing. You drink so you can sleep.
you stagger to your car...
...and then you start it all over again the next day.
then I discovered what you do for recreation.
Mm.
you can dispense justice...
...and give people a chance to value their lives in the same moment.
and by the way...
...the blade on your pendulum was inferior.
if you want a true edge...
...you have to used tempered steel.
Tempering's better for the long haul.
you in this for the long haul, detective?
then you and I both know the statistics for repeat offenders in this city.
67. 5 percent of criminals are back in prison within three years.
what do you want from me?
so you might look at what you did to Seth as a kind of public service.
she was my only family. He didn't deserve a chance.
he was an animal. - Everybody deserves a chance!
you didn't see the blood!
you didn't see what he fucking did to her!
killing is distasteful...
...to me.
there is a better, more efficient way.
what do you see...? Look!
what do you see? - Tell me what you want.
I wanna know if you have what it takes to survive.
fuck you.
you see, it's a different method that I'm talking about.
if a subject survives my method...
...he or she is instantly rehabilitated.
now, you want a chance?
you want a chance?
I'll give you a chance.
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.
it's your duty to bring me in...
...but I know who you are...
so this is blackmail.
no, no, no.
this is redemption.
just giving you an option, that's all.
now, you can arrest me...
...but doing so, your life ends as you know it.
or...
...you could explore...
...a method of rehabilitation...
...that'll permit you to sleep at night.
or I could kill you right now.
but you're not a true killer.
that's your dilemma...
...and the information that I have on you is exactly where it needs to be...
...and it will be released in the event of my disappearance.
they'll never believe your word over mine.
you willing to take that risk?
risk of ruining your own life...
...in order to protect a corrupt legal system...
...that puts murderers back on the streets?
how would your sister feel?
you're at a crossroads, detective.
make your choice.
did you help Jigsaw get all of them?
ERICKSON: Detective Hoffman, this is Special Agent Erickson.
you had something you needed to discuss about the Jigsaw case?
Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room tonight at the hospital, but he wasn't there.
I hope he's all right. - Oh, yeah, he's fine.
agent Strahm was theorizing about the possibility...
...of an additional accomplice to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young.
someone who might be currently unknown.
did he ever mention anything like that to you?
no, but then again, I'm new to the case.
Yeah, well, maybe you could get him to contact me at his earliest convenience.
will do. And...
...in your theorizing...
...who exactly did you suspect would be an accomplice?
well, he suspected someone on the inside.
someone with access.
it's an interesting theory.
detective, what do you say we reconnect in the morning?
you got it.
dead.
that guy was an asshole, but he was smart.
we could've used him.
Yeah, well, someone had to die.
would you rather it'd been you?
how'd they get you?
paul: Screw you!
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill...
jigsaw: Hello, Paul.
did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die...
...or did you just want some attention?
tonight, you'll show me.
if you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again.
how much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul?
hoffman: I didn't expect to feel any remorse.
John: The heart cannot be involved.
emotionally, there can be nothing there.
it can never be personal.
let's go. - No.
you're not done yet.
tonight you will see the difference between killing and rehabilitation.
there is another detective that you should be aware of.
his name's Tapp.
he's smart, and he's getting closer.
I know who he is.
I need you to lead him to someone for me.
a doctor.
a healer who needs some healing.
TAPP: Is this yours, doctor?
STRAHM: You supplied these police files, didn't you?
you're assuming this is gonna play out the way you want it.
I assume nothing.
I anticipate the possibilities, and I let the game play out.
then why do you need Amanda in the game?
to ensure that the rules are followed.
she won't make decisions for anyone. She'll just...
...offer choices.
little to your left.
that leaves a lot to chance.
John: If you're good at anticipating the human mind...
...it leaves nothing to chance.
it's time.
Jesus Christ.
LUBA: Great. More bombs.
all right. What'd you do to get here?
l... I did something, and a bunch of people were killed.
I didn't mean to.
they're still dead.
that's why you're here? - Yeah.
shouldn't you have gone to jail for something like that?
nobody else knows.
somebody does.
I didn't kill anybody, if that's what you're asking.
I wasn't.
I grant building permits.
and yeah, some people might have been more deserving than others...
...but you know what? That's the business.
so if someone tells you different, then they're just stupid.
or naive. Or both.
MALLICK: Bullshit.
you take bribes. You're a fucking liar. You cheat people. That's not nice.
Yeah, well.
I'm sure she's not exactly Mother Teresa either.
no, I'm not.
I build condos in one of the most densely populated cities in the country.
you don't put up a new building without tearing down a few old ones.
so we're all bags of shit that deserve to be here. That's good. That's great.
fucking great.
so is that what you think this is?
you don't think there's any other connection?
no, I do.
I do. And I don't give a shit.
close the fucking door. We have to hear the rules.
Hello, and welcome.
you must all be eager to learn the next important lesson in your transformation.
the game before you is designed to bridge the gap between you all.
in order to open the five locks on the door out of this room...
...the five electrical circuits powering them must be closed.
the only way to do this is to find a way to connect all five cords to the bath water.
close the circuits and the door will open.
but you must work quickly...
...for in three minutes, an electrical current will surge through this room...
...locking the door forever.
who will bridge the gap? The choice is yours.
MALLICK: Jesus Christ.
it's not gonna reach. How the fuck are we gonna do this?
come on!
you're gonna get in the tub...
...and we're gonna connect the five cords to you.
but you're gonna kill me too.
get in. - Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy.
I don't think I'm gonna do that right now. - Get in the fucking tub.
fuck you, you bitch. You get in the fucking tub.
no, don't do it.
please, no.
you killed her. You fucking killed her.
I didn't trust her.
Jesus Christ. What is it with you two?
just shut up and help me with the body.
Hey, hey. No. Don't let your body touch hers.
MALLICK: Oh, my God, it's a hook.
BRIT: Stick it in her head or we don't get out.
just do it
come in.
sir. It's Jill Tuck.
good evening.
special Agent Erickson.
thank you for seeing me so late in the day.
not a problem.
that'll be all.
please, have a seat.
so, what do you need from us?
I think I'm being followed.
well, that sounds more like police work, Miss Tuck.
I don't think they can help me.
because? - Because it's you. The FBI.
I don't understand.
it started when John was first identified as the Jigsaw killer.
it didn't surprise me then, but I'm still being followed.
by who, Miss Tuck? Who would be following you?
I think it's the agent who interrogated me.
agent Strahm.
and why would he be following you? - I don't know.
who else have you told about this? - Only you.
hoffman: What's going on with Amanda?
didn't you tell me the only way to truly offer enlightenment...
...is by detaching emotionally?
but you can have something Amanda doesn't.
anonymity.
that's the greatest protection. That's what I've given you.
I need you to set up a game...
...that may not be entirely clear to you right now.
but I assure you that the people being tested...
...are part of something much larger.
they're connected.
so in the end, all the pieces will fit together...
...and it'll be clear.
Lynn: Who are you?
Amanda will fail you. - We'll see.
Lynn: What are you doing?
hoffman: What's this? - It's time to play a game.
Lynn: Help.
help me. What is this?
what is this? Please.
why are you keeping me here? What is this place? What is this place?
we were all supposed to die.
he's just fucking testing you.
where is my daughter?
help!
he didn't make it.
nobody made it.
you were supposed to be the hero.
Peter, where the hell are you?
Hello?
STRAHM: You've reached the voice mail for Special Agent Peter Strahm.
leave a message.
cowan, I wanna put a locator on Strahm's mobile phone.
right away, sir.
call me right back.
right.
what the hell is that? - It's our next nightmare.
there are blades in here.
it's connected to the door.
when the beaker fills up, the door opens.
fills with what?
blood. Our blood.
I think an arm is supposed to go in there to fill the beaker.
wait. Why can't we just use the water from the other room?
no, the slots are closed.
we have to stick our arm in to keep them open, but they'd get stuck.
we need to close that door.
so, what?
we fight to the death, and one gets to freedom with the other person's blood?
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
do you still have the keys from that first room?
Yeah. - Try one of them on that door.
it won't work. - No, it might. This one has a keyhole.
it... It's not even the same lock.
wait, why are there five slots in this machine?
shouldn't there only be one?
they all would have worked.
COWAN: There you are, Strahm.
all right. I got him.
I don't think this is a good idea.
the tub wasn't meant for one person.
we were supposed to hold one cable each...
...and suffer a small shock.
it was meant for five people.
they all were. Every game.
we only needed one key in the first room.
they all worked, and any one of them would have opened every collar.
in the second room, the three tubes were large enough for more than one person.
we were supposed to work together so we all survived.
that's the game.
your instincts will tell you to do one thing...
...but I implore you to do the opposite.
Oh, God.
Yeah. Big fucking whoops.
Hello, and welcome.
this journey has been one of discovery...
...and hopefully you've discovered that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
the human body, for instance, is an astoundingly durable creation.
it contains approximately 10 pints of blood...
...yet it is still able to operate with just half of that.
the device before you is one of sacrifice.
a sacrifice of blood.
in order to open the door, the beaker must be filled to the marked level...
...a level that is of no coincidence.
this amount can come from any one of you.
that does not matter. What does matter is time.
for in 15 minutes, if the beaker is not filled...
...the bombs will explode and the doors will be sealed forever.
so now I ask you, how much blood will you give in order to survive?
fuck! Fuck.
all right, so one person can fill the beaker with ten pints of blood and die.
or two people can fill it...
...with five pints...
...and maybe live.
what are we gonna do?
MALLICK: I lied.
I know the investigative journalist in there. His name is Charles.
he was writing a story about what I did.
What'd you do?
a dealer gave me...
...an ounce of heroin to burn down an abandoned building.
but it wa...
Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned. There was eight people in there.
eight people died.
and the feds got involved.
and I got caught but I made a deal and my dad got me off.
the guy who hired me disappeared and nothing happened. Nothing happened.
that's how she knew me.
the woman in the tub.
the fire. It's what connects us.
the fire inspector who wrote the bogus accident report...
...the city planner who pushed through the residential permits...
...the journalist that buried the investigative story...
...the rich-kid junkie who was the patsy...
...and the real estate developer who set it all in motion.
we killed eight people and stole the property, and nobody cared.
nobody cared?
eight people and their families cared.
the feds cared. Look at my fucking arm. I cared! I cared!
but you didn't face justice.
none of us did.
why did they all do it?
Why? Was it for money?
this was your plan? You were the one behind it?
there was eight people in that building. You had to know that. Did you know that?
you're a monster.
so are you.
we both deserve to be here.
I can't do this alone. Look at me. I can't do this alone.
okay. It's okay.
we have to go on three.
one.
two.
put your hand in the hole!
three!
jigsaw: Hello, Agent Strahm.
if you are hearing this, then you have once again found what you're looking for.
or so you think.
your dedication is to be commended.
but I ask you if you have learned anything on your journey of discovery.
as the old adage goes:
fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
the situation you find yourself in is one of trust.
so I ask you, Special Agent Strahm, have you learned to trust me?
the only way to survive this room is by entering the glass box before you.
pain will be incurred, but you have a chance of survival.
we did it.
we won.
I got you, you motherfucker.
drop it!
I said drop it!
who did this to you?
we won.
we worked together.
I need immediate medical assistance. 1293 Sandburst Drive.
Jesus, Peter.
tell me how to open it.
how do I open it?
jigsaw: However, if you choose not to, you will never be heard from again.
your body will never be found.
you will simply vanish.
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm, have you learned enough to trust me?
will you heed my warning?
for if you do not... - Fuck you.
...this room will forever be your tomb.
and my legacy will become yours.
John: If you're good at anticipating the human mind...
I think I'm being followed. - Who would be following you?
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.
he suspected someone on the inside.
it leaves nothing to chance.
we were all supposed to die.
you were supposed to be the hero.
make your choice.
Yeah, this is Erickson.
I want you to put out an APB.
suspect's name is Peter Strahm.
Yeah, that's right.
special Agent Peter Strahm.
I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch.
I know who you are. I know.
where to? -Nowhere. Just browsing.
tell me, those guys over there? Do they sleep here all night?
come on, l want to get a good seat.
where to?
Where's your ticket?
l've been thinking it over. l'm gonna hitch.
the way l see it, l'm not getting any younger.
this could be my last chance to see the real America, really relate to the people.
loan me $1 .
change a $5?
how much money do you have? -That's $1 .
l got money. -That's $2.
how much? -Enough.
can you loan me $1 . 23? -Sure.
how much do you got there?
how did you expect to get to California on $18. 77?
l'll get by.
l have $20. You can have $50.
l can't take that. -You can. Come on.
you can pay me back after Christmas. Take it.
l won't forget this. -You will. But l'll remind you.
last call for bus number 33, leaving for St. Louis...
Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, Tucson and Los Angeles.
there's your bus. You better hurry.
are you sure you'll be okay?
don't you worry about me. You go have a good trip.
see you. -'Bye.
back. Give Hercules some room.
Hercules stands no chance against the sea monster.
anything good on?
your bus just left. -l know.
why weren't you on it?
l'm the kind of gal who likes to live on the edge.
we're gonna have to use a towel, here.
this could get very messy, if you don't know what you're doing.
this is called shotgunning beer.
lt's an ancient tribal custom. Originated in Southeast Asia, l believe.
take the beer. Poke a hole in it, as l will do now...
using any household appliance. l'm using a pen.
make it just big enough to fit your mouth over it.
eighty-six the pen, and then in one swift...
now listen to me, it's very important.
ln one swift, deft motion, you're gonna take it...
pull it up, and then release the cork. Not the cork, this thing...
and all the beer will slide down to your throat in two seconds.
now wait. Are you sure you're ready? -l'm ready.
for all you kids watching, this is very dangerous.
let's not try this at home, all right?
sure you're ready? -l can't believe l'm doing this.
lt's good for you. -Mom, forgive me.
swallow, swallow!
danger, Will Robinson! "
definite shotgun potential. -But it went up my nose.
for a beginner, it's amazing what you just did.
really nice.
Really?
l just remembered, l got to check something.
listen, tonight l'll sleep on the floor.
l don't think so. -l don't want any arguments from you.
l mean, it's only fair. Last night, l slept on the bed
Jason, l don't think so. lt's gonna take me a bit longer than l anticipated.
today's the 19th. Better not expect me...
till the 22nd or 23rd, at the earliest.
everything's fine. Really.
l'll call you tomorrow.
promise.
l miss you, Jason.
l've got this great big bed, and no one to share it with.
what are you doing? -l'm going for a walk.
lt's almost midnight. -lt's too stuffy in here.
l'm here.
are you 21?
okay, Dr. Levinson, what'll it be?
double bourbon and a beer chaser.
come on, Giblet, one more time.
l can't. Tomorrow, l promise.
lt was so good.
lt was so masterful. Relentless...
but with a delicate touch.
confident. Creative.
l was overwhelmed.
you're a true artist.
just let me sleep awhile, regain my strength.
five minutes. A grace period, if you will.
please.
what the heck.
Howdy.
mind if l sit here? -Sure, buddy, go ahead.
thank you kindly.
two beers. -And another double bourbon.
l got one of them sweepstakes flyers in the mail today...
and l can't figure if it's worth the effort to send it in.
you think l should bother?
probably not.
she says she's from Paris.
l don't believe that.
Paris women...
don't give you a hard time, like they do here.
to a Paris woman, sex is an art.
l was in Paris once, with my wife.
boy, am l glad she's dead.
one tequila eggnog.
l had fried food again for lunch today.
l know l shouldn't have had it...
but l couldn't help myself.
you think l lack self-discipline?
what's wrong with me? l'm a good-looking guy.
you are a good-looking guy.
and l'm a good-looking guy.
you are. -l am.
we're all three good-looking guys.
that's right. We are.
and it's Christmastime, and l'm gonna buy you a drink.
what are you drinking? -Something light.
what, like a nice Chablis? -A spritzer.
barkeep, give this man a trough of spritzer.
and you, cowboy guy, what do you want to drink?
l'll have a beer. -Get cowboy guy a beer.
lt's on me tonight. Drinks are on me.
they're on me.
chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos
everybody knows that turkey and some mistletoe
Where've you been?
this guy, Jason...
may be a real brain and all, but can he do this?
don't worry, Mom, l'll take the garbage out in the morning, l promise.
chestnuts roasting on the fire
come on, let's go.
okay, do you have everything? -l have everything. You have everything.
sure? -We all have everything. Everything's fine.
let's go. -You can't rush me.
she's checking under the thing. What is under there, l don't know.
a bathroom. Again with the bathroom. -You can't rush me!
we've got to travel by day. So let's go.
look at the time. We got to go. -We're all proceeding, here.
just check everything. -We got everything, here.
we're out of here.
God, l'm starving.
how does it feel? -Needs more bulk.
we can't eat for 200 miles.
what are you telling me, woman?
l worked out a schedule. -Another schedule. Great.
l computed exactly how much money we have...
how long it'll take us to get there, how many meals we have to have.
lt came out to one meal every 200 miles.
after 700, though, we can have a snack.
good. Cheetos in Albuquerque. l can hardly wait.
what do you think, nine months? -More like 15.
excellent. Very pregnant.
what are you gonna name it? -What?
the baby.
the baby.
lf it's a girl, Cynthia.
and if it's a boy...
those are lovely names.
Elliot? You're gonna name the kid Elliot?
you can't name the kid Elliot.
Elliot is a fat kid with glasses who eats paste.
not gonna name the kid Elliot. Got to give him a real name.
give him a name.
like Nick. -Nick?
Nick's a real name. Nick's your buddy.
Nick's the kind of guy you can trust, someone you can drink beer with.
kind of guy who doesn't mind if you puke in his car.
God. -Vomit, l'm sorry.
thank you. -Merry Christmas to you.
l'm gonna have a huge orange juice, three eggs, two sides of bacon...
home fries, four pieces of toast, and then lunch!
you sure we can eat? l don't know if we've gone 200 miles.
l don't want to throw your schedule off.
leave me alone. l'm a pregnant woman.
how could you lose your money?
l put it in my schedule book. -How could you lose your schedule book?
that's the most important thing in your life, that stupid book!
you wouldn't even remember your name without it. This is just excellent!
l'm starving.
thank you.
l'm freezing to death.
my feet are killing me.
l just swallowed my gum.
your incessant complaining isn't doing us any good.
can't you try and look on the bright side?
over there!
over there. There's a trailer, come on.
lt's locked! This is very good.
lt's important that this place should have an airtight security system...
in the middle of nowhere!
wait, l might have a nail file.
l have a credit card.
credit cards work on a completely different kind of lock.
l don't think you understand. l have a credit card.
you have a credit card?
my dad told me, specifically, l can only use it in case of an emergency.
maybe one will come up.
too bad this is the only place that takes credit cards.
real shame.
here, try some of my veal.
only if you try some of this salmon.
l'm not a big fish guy, so you take it.
l'm not gonna eat that, but you try the veal
l'm not gonna-- -Try it.
lt's good? See, l told you.
so, you were saying?
anyway, my father... He grew up on a farm.
he always thought it was a real shame that we only saw the suburbs.
he used to take us on great camping trips. Want more wine?
one night, l was sleeping in my pup tent with my younger brother.
l must have been, what, six or seven.
l woke up in the middle of the night, and l had to get outside.
l don't know why. l just really wanted to go outside.
lt was dark. l mean, totally dark.
not like in the city, or even in the suburbs.
l'm talking absolute blackness.
you couldn't see two inches in front of your face.
but there's one thing you could see.
millions of things, really.
you could see the stars.
there were more stars out that night than l've ever seen since.
believe me, l've looked.
l'm standing there, looking up at the sky, and l'm thinking...
that each one of these dots of light is another world.
l didn't know the difference between the stars and the planets, then.
but it made me feel really small.
lonely.
do you know what l mean?
then l thought, maybe on each one of these other worlds...
there's a kid like me. Only, he's shaped like a sponge...
or a pinball machine, or something. Whatever, but he's up there.
maybe he's on a camping trip, and he's looking up at the stars.
l decided l want to meet this guy.
a rose for the lady? -Would the lady care for a rose?
would the lady care to advance the gentleman the cost of a rose?
put it on the bill. That'd be great.
for you.
thank you. -lt was nothing.
you don't have to sleep on the floor.
what?
you don't have to sleep on the floor.
are you sure?
l won't try anything, l swear.
l trust you.
good night.
how's your lawyer?
my lawyer?
what's his name? Jimmy, Jeremy.
how is Jason, anyway?
Jason's fine.
l guess you really miss him. -l haven't seen him since last summer.
what's he like?
Jason is very directed. He's a real achiever.
l know, but what is he like? l mean, what kind of beer does he drink?
ls he funny? Does he make you laugh?
he is everything a girl looks for in a guy. -He sounds perfect.
we both want the same things out of life.
we're both gonna be lawyers. Damn good ones.
we might even open a practice together, up in Vermont.
somewhere in the country. -l get it.
Jason is the real outdoorsy type.
clear, freshwater streams, fragrant meadows...
biodegradable toilet paper, the works.
lt's just that we both like old farmhouses.
we thought it'd be nice to find one and restore it ourselves.
