well, all right.
yo, congrats. Excuse me?
Hey, she's no me, but the new chick can really fry a fish.
and, man, she's hot.
Yeah, I know.
I have no idea what was going on with Zoe, but I kissed her, and I kissed her for you.
and you can see that there is nothing going on there, and you can believe me because I'm not that good of an actor.
okay.
let me go get you a tea, okay?
tansy, I have to talk to you. It's urgent.
you were great. Yeah, I know, right?
who knew Lavon Hayes could act?
Oh. Yeah, I see a whole new future career for my myself.
well, I mean, you were great, but BlueBell needs you a heck of a lot more than Broadway. Mm-hmm.
look, I was so proud of you, putting yourself out there.
what happened? AnnaBeth happened.
Yeah, I - I told her my fears, and they just went away.
y - You know, I don't know what's going on with you and Shelby, but... but just talk to her.
thank you.
Congratulations.
the food is still disgusting, so I guess that means that you knocked it out of the park.
nice job. Heard you gave quite a performance tonight.
don't reckon you'll be running off to make it on Broadway any time soon.
that's for sure. You kissed George Tucker?
I did. How was that?
none of your business.
sorry.
just so you know, not in small part due to you,
I am very, very messed up.
I know.
and, uh... I'm sorry.
there you are.
you didn't come to the party.
Oh, I wasn't in a party mood.
magnolia and I watched America's Next Top Model.
turns out we both hated the girl that got kicked off, so... seeing some progress.
I'm surprised to see you before I fell asleep.
look...
you're right, I was avoiding you.
the thing is, there's something...
I was afraid to tell you.
what?
Why?
brick, I love you.
I love you so much that I am putting up with living with your teenage daughter.
there is nothing that I can't take now.
okay.
well...
see, the thing is, it started the other week...
I am sorry for how I behaved onstage.
Yeah, you did go a little bit... Nuts.
I was gonna say "off book"
I don't know, I guess I thought that it would be weird, us kissing. Huh.
and the alternative you concocted was completely normal?
well, you know what was weird was that it wasn't weird.
I kissed you, and I felt absolutely nothing.
so, good news, sir.
I am completely over you.
that is great, great news, Zoe Hart.
good.
Wanda's bees made a hive in my trailer.
I'm homeless. " How did that happen?
me?
well, I don't know how. I closed the top.
I think. Oh, God.
Hey, Tans?
why don't you just come live with me on my houseboat for a little while until they fix your trailer up, hmm? I would love that.
you guys are living together.
Yay! See? Happy endings, everyone.
well, I'm gonna leave you guys to it.
but big congrats!
Bye.
Dr. Hart? - Harley Wilkes was your father.
what? - He left you his practice.
mom, what about Harley? Why not tell me about him? - Can we just go home and discuss this in therapy like normal people?
you go.
I'm staying here. - If I do recall, we are at your engagement party.
you know how difficult this is for me. - Difficult never stopped me.
this needs to stop. I can't handle it.
what do you want from me here? I'm trying to move on, and you won't let me.
lemon, I love you, and I love Bluebell.
what's this? - I think it's time we start looking for a house, don't you?
Hey, doc, meant to thank you for blowing out the electricity at my place last night.
it's good to practice living off the grid in case of a war with the zombies or whatnot.
look, you can eat here and drink here, but if you sleep here I'm going to have to charge you hotel tax.
I'm sorry. I haven't been sleeping lately.
I've been lying in bed at night just listening to my mosquitoes die in my new bug zapper.
well, listen, maybe you're just not tired enough at night.
if you want to work out a little, or whatever.
no need to blow the power out. I'll just come by.
great. The mosquitoes will show you where to go.
okay, now we are all set for my trip just as soon as I deliver this baby.
women - I never understand, why do they insist on having babies during the football season?
daddy. Hey, Magnolia honey.
have you come to see me before I take off on the football trip?
Yes. Plus I wanted to show you the new dress I bought.
isn't it cute?
well, yes, that is, uh... Cute, yeah.
did your sister see that? - I knew it.
always running off to daddy when you don't get your way.
he said my dress was cute.
daddy, this dress shows places that only God should see.
it's like something that Zoe Hart would wear.
magnolia said that she would march right back to the store and go return it, but now she's just traipsing around in it so they won't take it back.
just because I want to dress like I live in 2011, and not 1950...
stop, stop. Stop, now, stop.
look, I have to get on the road. So just...
whatever your sister says is fine.
Oh, my God, you're ruining my life.
hey... - Daddy!
what? - Thank you.
what? I... I backed her up.
don't look at me, I got boys.
by the time they've thought up a lie, they've forgotten what they were lying about.
you need to stop ignoring your mom.
I'm not. I just saw your phone - it said "mom."
you were reading it upside down.
I was ignoring my Chinese friend Wow.
you haven't talked to her since she left Bluebell.
and she's not giving up, you know.
she is calling you twice a day now.
Yeah, well, I'm not talking to her twice a day.
I'm keeping up. - You said you're not sleeping.
so?
troubled sleep means a troubled mind.
and you won't quiet yours until you can forgive her.
forgive her, Addy?
she lied to me about who my father was.
she just wants to feel better.
I don't feel better, why should she?
because you won't get any peace until you face what's bothering you.
I know what's bothering me
a crazy nurse who won't leave me alone.
well, I just talked to the Colyer woman again.
her contractions are still seven minutes apart.
now, where's the oxytocin? Whoa, why are you inducing labor?
well, because when I said I'd cover the pregnancy for Dr. Troy over in Bristol, he promised me I would not miss the Alabama-Florida football game.
you're going to induce labor just so you can make a football game?
no. - She's past due.
I'm practically doing the woman a favor.
all right, fine, I'll take the birth when it's time.
I'm not sleeping much anyway. I might as well.
I don't want to put you out.
don't pretend like this wasn't your plan.
Where's the address? - I have it right here.
you know, this does not go on your patient count, 'cause we're covering for Dr. Troy. You're welcome.
Lavon. Hi. Two things. One, please replace the fuse box.
Wade thinks my blowing the power is some sort of mating call.
two, I need a ride.
fuse box - yes, ride - no.
I have a prior commitment. - Lavon, no, a woman's having a baby.
so drive yourself. Go on, take the hybrid. But you always give me rides.
I can't just keep you company every time you need to make a house call, now.
this ain't "Driving Miss Zoe."
I have important mayoral business to conduct.
hey oh, big man, you got the tv warmed up?
Hey, doc. Want to join us for the ladies' beach volleyball championships?
fine. Take the navigator.
just don't change the radio stations.
you even know how to drive?
I've had my license since I was 16. Have you driven since then?
the principles haven't changed. It's not a flying car.
she knows she's supposed to call me and tell me where she is.
it just frazzles me to my last stitch, it really does.
magnolia has daddy wrapped around her little finger, and just makes me the bad guy all the time.
no. You're her big sister, she worships you. - Not anymore.
all I do is yell at her now, and we used to have such fun.
you know, we used to play house, and I'd be the mama...
I'd dress her up in all the clothes I outgrew.
she was like my little walk-around doll.
Yeah, you might be getting some payback for that right now.
okay, enough about me. How was your day?
well... - Oh!
did you hear that Marvella Pinckney died? Isn't that so exciting?
did you have today in a pool, or something?
no. I mean, of course, I'm not happy that she died
poor thing, bless her heart
but it does mean that her house is available, and I have wanted to live in that house since I was a tiny girl.
and seeing as you and I are looking for a house, now we can get it, thanks to Marvella Pinckney.
and her filterless cigarettes.
poor thing.
bless her heart.
you've reached Dr. Breeland. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.
good morning, Brick.
I just wanted to leave a message to say that Mrs. Colyer has a healthy baby boy.
took most of the night.
and towards the end she said, "thank you for not inducing my labor before I was ready, just so you could watch a football game." Okay, she didn't say that, but she was thinking it.
have fun.
prepare to turn right.
into a tree? Go away.
Hello?
Hello? Anybody there?
are you hurt?
if you're hurt, make a noise.
I'm a doctor. Dr. Zoe Hart.
I'm from Bluebell.
no, I'm not from Bluebell, I'm from New York.
I'm only in Bluebell... Oh, my God, it's not important. Hello?
Hello?
Shelley! Oh, my God! You're up early.
I've been up all night. - Doing what?
looking for a man. - Might want to try a little extra makeup next time.
morning, Shelley. Hey, Zoe. You're up early.
George, I'm totally freaking out. I ran over a man with my car.
wait, what? - When'd you get a car?
it's Lavon's car. Oh, my God.
how is that important? - Okay, you know what, just calm down. When and where?
a couple hours ago. In Settler's Woods.
okay, Zoe, Zoe... - Huh?
you probably just hit a deer.
okay, there are a lot of deer in those woods. - Yep.
are they the kind with man heads? Because then that would explain it.
okay, what'd he look like? I only saw him for a second.
but his face is burned into my brain.
he kind of looked like - like...
he, he... - Like what?
him.
it looked like him?
it is him. That's the guy.
that - that's Leon Mercy. Okay, and?
and he's been dead for over a year.
in MEMORY OF BLUEBELL'S HEROES
so, anyway, it turns out
leon Mercy's some kind of local town hero or something.
was, yes. Saved the whole Rivenbark family, including an out-of-town cousin from their burning house one night.
and then three months later, he was dead himself.
except that he's not, because I saw him last night.
except he is, 'cause I was at the funeral.
his poor wife standing there with their baby boy.
what are you saying, I ran down a ghost? No, you're saying you ran down a ghost, and you need to stop saying it if you want to get some patients in this town.
morning. Hey, hon. Hey.
sheriff Bill, did you find anyone? Wait, hold up.
that's the call you got that took you out the house this morning before you even had your pancakes?
I searched Settler's woods where you said it happened.
but didn't see a thing. Because you imagined the man.
most likely it was a deer.
or a raccoon. - Black bear.
coyote. - Bobcat, maybe even a cougar.
good God, where do I live? - I don't think the mayor's going to be happy about the damage you did to his headlight.
I don't think Leon Mercy's going to be too wild about it either.
it's not even 10: 00 A. M. I already got two people mad at me.
two is a better start than most days.
you got me out of bed to hunt around the woods for a dead guy?
on pancake day?
goodness gracious. I could have had breakfast.
that's three. You're catching up.
Hey, Lavon.
Hey, did I catch you at a bad time?
no, no. Come on in.
great. - Go on, sit down.
so, uh, what's been going on?
not much.
did you hear Marvella Pinckney died?
yeah I did, I did.
very sad.
well, it... it is. But as it turns out,
I have been asking Babs Foster if she would help Lemon and me find a house - for after we're married. - Mm-hmm.
it seems that Lemon has always had this dream of living in the Pinckney house.
Yeah.
you knew?
no.
no, I was just listening.
okay, well, now Babs tells me that the Pinckney house is registered as a Bluebell historic property.
the only way it can be sold is with approval from the town.
it's not that easy.
you know, there are procedures and-and committees, a whole process to it.
but it's not an act of congress, right?
it's Bluebell.
Yeah, it is.
and I'm gonna say no.
no?
I get, like, 50 requests a day - "do me this, do me that." Other people in this town want things, too.
I just thought you might help me out.
move you to the front of the line.
I guess so. And why would I do that?
as a favor? 'Cause I'm asking?
but you didn't ask. You just said what you wanted.
okay, well, now I'm asking. And I remain disinclined.
look, I know you're used to getting what you want, now...
okay, I don't know where all this is coming from, Lavon, but you do know that there are plenty other ways
I can go about doing this, right? I think you should get to them.
I'll challenge the statute in court. Oh, I love a challenge.
then I'll see you there. I'll circle it on my calendar.
how did this happen? I thought I had his attention.
boys are impossible to decipher.
so, can I borrow an outfit?
what? Outfit?
for the party. At the lake.
I knew you weren't listening.
no, I'm sorry. I was listening.
I'm just a little tired. Got a little lost.
there's a party at the lake, and Frederick Dean is gonna be there...
and even though he's always talking to me now about comic books, he still hasn't officially asked me out.
Magnolia's still after him.
you want to know something? She is just toying with him, like a cat with a ball of yarn.
Dr. Hart, patient is asking for you. Are you serious?
right.
rose, my closet is your closet.
good luck tonight, my friend.
Hi. I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.
nice to meet you. Laurette Nevis.
how do you do? - Fine.
did someone refer you to me? - No.
I heard people talking about what you saw in Settler's woods.
I see.
so I came here to tell you that there is a rational explanation for what you saw.
Yes. I knew there was.
what is it?
the restless ghost of Leon Mercy is asking you for help.
okay.
well, thank you for com... - Look.
most people are too closed off to admit the presence of spirits, but they are all around us here.
the woods that drew you into them are filled with the wandering dead.
they did not draw me in. No?
it was Lavon's GPS.
and how are you sleeping? Good. Very well, actually.
the spirit of Leon Mercy came to you for help, - Can I... just... - Because you...
also have something restless in you.
you, Zoe Hart, are a receiver.
no. Okay, I am not a receiver.
I'm from New York.
new yorkers are not receivers.
most of them don't even get satellite. Let him in, face him, or you both will remain trapped between worlds.
who?
an educated doctor who isn't scared of ghosts.
that's who. I'm really not.
damn it, Zoe!
what the hell?
I am so, so sorry.
it must be the new bug zapper. I totally forgot.
what are you even doing up at this hour?
I'm not sleepy. Yeah, well, I don't care.
go to bed. No, wait, wait!
since we're both up, you want to hang out?
have some tea or something?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll... I'll have some "tea."
Oh, no! Whoa, no. No, no. Never mind.
bad idea.
I'm sleepy. Exhausted. Go away.
you are a certified crazy person, you know that?
now, historically I've found that hot, but in your case, I think I'm cured.
unbelievable!
he's right.
this is nuts. Ghosts?
Oh, my God. What?! What is it?!
What?! - Leon Mercy!
leon Mercy? - Yeah, look.
leon Mercy, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, there's, like, ten Leon Mercys out here.
okay, no ghosts, no Leon Mercy, nothing.
thank you. Good night.
wait. I'm sorry.
maybe I am nuts.
will you just stay till morning?
all right. Wait.
not there. Couch. Geez.
good night. - Wait.
blanket?
I couldn't sleep. Because there are no ghosts.
I know that. I'm a woman of science, for God's sake.
so I did some research, and I found Leon Mercy's obituary.
look.
leon drowned in the Gulf while he was fishing.
they found his boat and they searched forever until they declared him dead, but no body was ever found.
Why? I'll tell you why.
because he never died.
maybe he bumped his head and he's walking around, he doesn't know who he is or where he is. I have to go find him.
so you didn't wake me up for sex?
jerk!
no, the point is, I didn't imagine anything.
Zoe, I'm sorry it's late, but Magnolia's passed out drunk in the car and we can't wake her up. Who drove you here?
jacob Coburn - he's a junior and president of the sobriety club.
wait, there were juniors at this party?
I would have left, but I can't leave Frederick with Magnolia.
the kissing games turned into drinking games.
what were you thinking? - Hey, what's going on?
you need my help? What was I thinking?
we'll talk later. Come on, let's get her out of the car.
okay, all right, move over, stick man, take this.
what happened? She was drinking a lot,
I guess, like, a lot.
fruit punch and vodka.
Hey, where's he going?! Oh, come on!
airway is clear, but her breathing is very shallow.
Wade, go get your car. We have to bring her to - my office immediately. - Hey, give me the flashlight.
let's go!
what do you think's wrong? Could be alcohol poisoning.
is that bad? Is poisoning bad?
Yeah, it's bad. - She'll be okay, right?
rose, she could've choked on her own vomit, gone into cardiac arrest, she could've died.
now get your phone, I need to notify her father.
you said she wouldn't tell anyone. You promised. Zoe, you can't call her dad.
I told everyone you were the cool doctor.
please. Rose, she's a minor.
brick is out of town.
that's good, that's good. You don't have to call.
believe it or not, there's someone that Magnolia and I both would like to call even less than Brick.
how is she? She's going to be fine.
she's resting.
she's responsive, so you can take her home.
well... thank you.
no problem. You know, teenagers - they're hard.
my mom had to raise me on her own when I was that age, and, oh, boy...
I said... thank you.
your medical help is appreciated, but your family counseling is not.
what are you doing?
look, thanks for staying last night, but even if I was afraid, it's morning, and I'm not.
you know, I'm no Dr. Phil or whatever, but in my experience, when I'm having trouble sleeping, it... Wait, let me guess.
it's because you have something unresolved in your life that you're not dealing with. No, it's 'cause I need to get laid.
well, thank you for the expert psychological insight.
no problem. - You may go.
your services are no longer needed.
my services haven't even been used, doc.
your loss.
mom? - Hello, dear.
What?! What is it this time?
you see her, too, right?
mom, what are you doing?
I hope I'm not interrupting something.
what? No. - Oh, well, howdy, ma'am.
I'm Wade.
must say I didn't expect to meet Zoe's mother so soon into our relationship.
Oh, my God. Gross. Shut up. Go fix the fuse box.
it's a roller coaster ride, but I don't want it to stop.
Hey, anyway, good to meet you. Bye.
he seems... nice. Very homegrown.
I brought you a present. It's a sound machine.
very soothing. Your nurse, uh,
Addy, said that you weren't sleeping.
why would you show up like this? What choice did I have?
you won't return my calls.
because I don't want to talk to you.
I just took two planes, sat in a bus station in a town I think was called Hickory Butt, but that could have been the driver's accent, then I got a ride to your place with a trucker who knows an amazing amount about packing and shipping crawfish, so you will talk to me.
actually, I won't.
I have a patient who needs my help. There's a man running around out there who may be hurt and confused. Your own mother is hurt and confused.
Oh, stop it.
this man has a wife and a child who, unlike me, still has a father, so I am going to go help him. Look, I get it - you're mad.
you've been mad at me before, and I've always just hung in until you came around.
so... come around.
what do you need, mother?
what do you need?
because that's what it's always about.
you need me to forgive you? Yes.
fine. I forgive you. But you don't really mean it.
no, it's a lie.
because that's what we do for each other - lie.
that's the lesson I learned from the one person I'm supposed to trust.
so you want me to forgive you for the big lie that has defined my life?
sure.
I forgive you.
got to go.
I take it that you're not feeling well enough for church today.
do you have anything to say for yourself?
we're out of cereal.
give me that.
you could have died last night.
you scared me half to death.
you exposed our family business to that Dr. Hart.
what has gotten into you lately?
nothing.
what do you think that daddy is going to say when he hears about your latest escapade?
he'll say, "Lemon, take care of it.
well... okay.
then why?
why would you put me through this? Because... so what?
you're not going to be able to tell me what to do anyway.
what do you mean?
when you get married to George Tucker and move out, you're not even going to live here.
you won't even know what I do, so stop pretending you care about me, because you don't!
I need to borrow your car. Oh, you mean my remaining car.
see, because the last one you used is still off getting a new headlight.
Yes. I need to save a man's life. What man?
well, if you have the power to raise the dead, I'm sure you can solve a mundane problem like transportation.
that wasn't really a no.
Hey, baby. You, uh... you ready for church?
Oh, and before you hear it from Babs, there... there is a tiny hitch in getting the Pinckney place, but I promise you, I will get it for you.
what?
George, how can you even think about buying a house right now?
that is the single most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard.
I take it things have changed.
Yes.
everything.
I know why Magnolia's being such a holy terror, and it's because I'm leaving.
all the wedding planning and the house hunting, and I never even gave a thought that to Magnolia, it must seem like I'm just abandoning her like mama did to us.
and now she's just drinking and doing God knows what else right under my nose, and I never even saw it, and I'm just so horrible. No, no, come on.
you are not. You are not horrible.
and she knows...
look, she knows you're not abandoning her.
okay, she's just a full-blown teenager now, and that... that's not a big sister job.
look, Brick's got to step up to the plate here.
you got to talk to him. No, George.
daddy wouldn't have a single clue what to do.
he depends on me to...
to not be a problem.
it's Dr. Hart.
Hello?
no.
Oh, my God.
what are you doing here?
well, Lavon said you stole his car, asked me to come out here and find you, knowing full well you'd get lost out here and die.
well, you both can laugh later.
can you just... - Shh!
did you just shush me? Don't shush me!
leon, are you hurt? You look hurt.
still pretty good for a guy who's been dead for a year.
your wound is bleeding. It could be infected. We need to get you to a hospital.
no. - Yes.
Zoe, traditionally, in a yes-no situation, argument goes to the guy with the hatchet.
he made it all the way to my place on that leg.
he needs my help. He could be confused.
there's people looking for you. Do you know that you have a wife and child?
why the hell do you think I'm out here?
Hey, George. Hey, Brick.
sorry to hear about the 'Bama loss. Oh, wasn't even close.
you know Florida whips our butts every time we go down there?
is Lemon inside? Yeah, she's upstairs, but if you don't mind, give me a minute. What?
we, uh... well, we had an incident with Magnolia last night.
what? - She went to a party, and she passed out from alcohol poisoning.
good lord.
Magnolia? - Yeah.
well, where... where is she now? - She's upstairs, but she is fine, Brick. Zoe fixed her up.
Zoe Hart said it was alcohol poisoning?
and Lemon took her word for it?
what the hell kind of party did Lemon let her go to?
you know what? Just settle down for a second, Brick.
cause Zoe might have saved Magnolia's life last night, and Lemon, this is not her fault, because she is not Magnolia's mom.
and she might have stepped up and parented her all these years because someone had to do it, but in my honest opinion, she shouldn't have to do it at all, and she definitely shouldn't have to do it alone.
you know, I don't think I appreciate you coming into my house and lecturing me on things that aren't your concern.
they became my concern the minute I got engaged to Lemon.
and I am sorry, Brick, that your wife left you, but that happened 12 years ago, and you are still sitting here acting like she went to the corner store and she's going to be back any minute.
well...
you know, when Alice left,
I was in this... kind of a daze.
I mean, she had done most of the real child raising, and then here I was
I was left with this two-year-old all on my own.
she was such a help. She was just so good.
I did. I did. I...
I just let it be.
well, Brick, those girls need their dad.
both of them.
so you did come to my place last night.
well, seems that you don't have amnesia.
so I take it you faked your own death.
what did you mean when you said you did it for your wife and kid?
all done.
no, you're not.
well, I am if you're not going to talk.
you have to fix me. You're a doctor. And you're dead.
who you going to tell?
What'd they say about me in town?
that you're a hero. They also say I was a screwup?
how? - Name it.
was a gambler. Was a drinker.
was a loser.
I was unreliable. Wade remembers, huh?
you could be a little wild, I recall.
I think the word is dangerous. Yeah. Yeah.
that, too, as I recall.
you know the night I saved those people from burning up?
I was headed home from a poker game, so drunk I don't remember doing it.
for all I know, I went into that house to rob it.
I woke up, and overnight, I had gone from town screwup to local hero just like that.
but I knew that I was the exact same person
I was before that fire, even if they chose to ignore it.
so he went out on top.
what do you mean, out on top? - He peaked.
went as high as he was gonna go.
he knew it.
why sit around and watch it all go to hell?
so you just walked away?
my baby would look at me like I was the greatest thing on earth.
but I knew those same eyes were gonna see me coming home drunk and crazy or maybe even worse.
so I took my boat out and I jumped overboard.
and now and forever, his daddy is a hero.
he doesn't even know he has a daddy.
believe me, he is not better off. You don't have kids, do you?
no.
then you cannot possibly imagine the choices!
now, you might not understand why I did what I did, but I did what I thought was right for my child.
okay, you want to talk?
talk.
did you really think lying was doing the best thing for me?
sometimes it is.
I told you your cat died peacefully in his sleep.
did you want to hear the he fell from the windowsill and dropped ten floors?
Mr. Mittens?
you make a judgment call.
is it always right?
no. It's not science. And a father isn't a cat.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
when your father found out - my ex-husband, I mean
the one who raised you... - I know who you mean.
I planned to tell you, and then you would look up at me, those little eyes so trusting.
you didn't think I could handle it?
I didn't think I could.
you were the most important thing in the world to me, honey.
you were all I had.
if I could go back and undo it all, I would.
it's too late for that.
but not for us.
you need your mother, sweetheart.
you can't lie anymore.
I won't.
even if it hurts, I'm tough. I can take it.
I'll always land on my feet.
so did Mr. Mittens.
fat lot of good it did him.
you are not leaving this house tonight.
I want to see my friends.
am I not supposed to have any friends?
no, not if they're the same friends that got you poison-drunk less than 24 hours ago!
and that is something we have yet to discuss, you and I.
but we're gonna have plenty of time to talk about it because, Magnolia Breeland, you are grounded for one month.
are you kidding?
you can't ground me. Forget it.
you leave this house tonight, or any night in the next month, and I will have Sheriff Bill bring you home in his patrol car, running the siren, flashing the lights and saying your name on the speaker horn the whole way.
Oh, my God, you are ruining my life!
Oh, my lord, you did that to me when I was 15.
and I only had to do it once.
Oh, sweetheart...
thank you.
you have done more than your share around here, and I'm gonna do more, too.
more of what I should've been doing all along.
well, then I will be happy to have someone else ruin her life for a while.
well, I hope I don't have to relocate my trailer.
if I get carolers this year, I'll know who to blame.
how's the leg?
better.
it's good.
you could have disappeared anywhere, but you stayed in Bluebell.
it's where I grew up.
it's where your son's growing up.
my dad, Harley, he kept tabs on me, too.
he showed up at my graduation, he stood right in front of me, he talked to me. And he never told me he was my father.
Yeah, well, I told you why I can't do that.
Yeah.
I brought you some antibiotics.
I was gonna tell you that you can't take them with alcohol, but then I noticed that you don't have any alcohol.
I take it you're not gambling either.
you've changed, Leon. People can change.
apparently, they can be forgiven, too.
go back, look them in the eye and tell them the truth.
be a dad.
thank you.
about the other day...
just to let you know, I... - No, go ahead.
lemon and I, we're not gonna be needing the Pinckney house just yet, so, no suing.
OK
is everything on track for the wedding? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, good. That's good.
so, anyway, when the, uh, when the time comes,
I'll just go through the proper channels, and, uh...
and I'm sorry about putting you in that position.
Oh, no, no, I was... uh...
Over-emphatic in protection of the past.
it's a really important house, so...
Yeah.
but the past is the past, right?
ain't no reason for it to sit there empty full of ghosts.
good point.
to the future?
the future. Yeah.
shot of bourbon, please.
you sure, doc?
I could mix you up a apple-tini or something.
I've spent the past several hours with my mom.
a shot of bourbon now. Yeah.
why is Leon's picture off the wall of dead people?
Oh, well, he's not dead anymore.
that's right.
came, uh... walking back into town just today.
nearly scared the pee out of his wife. I can imagine.
I guess he, uh... told her some crazy story about, uh... faking his own death.
I don't know.
they seem to be talking, though.
from what I hear, he hasn't put that boy of his down yet.
Oh, big girl.
well, thanks for the drink.
and for helping me with Leon.
and staying over. And rescuing me.
it's no wonder I'm so tired. No wonder.
did you just smack my butt?
no. No, must've been a ghost.
Harley Wilkes was your father. He left you his practice.
Zoe knows about us. Why you stopped our little frolic the other night?
you got googly-eyes for golden boy George?
I'm nearly 30 years old, and I have never been in a real relationship.
you did a pretty good job of letting me in just now.
I found out that my dad moved back to New York and kind of didn't tell me.
the only thing Ethan Hart cares about is the fact that we don't share the same DNA.
you are the most selfish person I have ever met!
I'm done. Don't say that. We're done, Dad.
dad? Dad!
I heard about your dad. We got a good surgeon.
now you have a great one. I called my father.
he'll be here tomorrow.
um, what are we looking at?
my father. In the form of a blinking red dot.
see?
he keeps getting... closer. Closer.
closer, oh, God, he's closer.
uh, how long have we been starin at the blinking red dot?
since Delaware. His flight lands in under an hour, and when it does, I'm going to be waiting for him at the hospital, and I'm going to be doing this.
and what's happening right now?
I'm giving you my cold face.
hard core, right? Uh, I don't know.
you just kind of look bored. No!
I look like I don't care.
you know, that's what I want him to think, "Hey, Dad, "you don't care about me, I don't care about you just as much, whatevs.
and then he'll do the surgery, save George's father, and then it's on.
what's on? I'm gonna unleash the whoop-ass.
Oh, but I thought you just said you didn't care?
no, of course I care, but I can't let him know that right away or he might kill Mr. Tucker.
it's a very stressful situation, Addy.
okay, maybe I should drive you. Yeah, I think that would be best.
closer.
thought you'd be in Mobile.
I'm headed back to the hospital.
I just came here to pick up Mrs. Tucker some butter cookies.
did you get a chance to talk to George about, uh...
the man's father just had a heart attack.
for God's sake, Lavon.
hardly thinkk is an aooropriate time. We... hey,'m, I'I'm rry. y.
I just want to be prepared that's'slll.
Zoe's father is flying in for the surgery, so George is already beyond grateful.
I'm not sure I'm following.
the minute that I tell George the truth, who do you think he's gonna go running to?
Zoe Hart, that's who.
but if I don't tell him soon, then she will, okay?
so, I'm trapped.
no, I still don't think Zoe will say anything. She promised me.
can you just... give me some credit?
this girl has been trying to ruin my life since the minute that she got here, and now she finally has the chance, thanks to you, so...
I hope you're happy.
cup of coffee. Make it strong.
I need to stay mean for the next few hours, and caffeine keeps me edgy. Somehow,
I don't think it's in my best interests to make you any meaner.
Oh, don't worry.
all of my anger today will be focused on dear old dad. Huh.
and I thought it was only your mom that you hated.
well, I did, but then I realized it wasn't fair of me to pour all of my bitterness and resentment into one parent, okay? So, my mom may have lied to me, but my dad abandoned me.
Yeah, but wasn't that like a million years ago? Yes.
but then he moved two weeks ago, and he didn't even tell me.
so, that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
come on. Finally, I got in touch with my anger.
so, today, I'm gonna get all up in his grill with it.
what? You think I won't?
that's real hot.
see that? Made of steel, baby.
made of...
Hey, you gonna... you gonna pay for that or...?
Hey, Twig, how you doing? Mr. Maynard!
what an unexpected honor, sir.
welcome to your Jammer. What can I get you?
well, it's good to see somebody remembers where the paychecks are coming from.
good morning, patrons.
does anybody here know what today is?
Monday! No.
Tuesday!
never mind.
today is the 30th anniversary of the Rammer Jammer.
and so, to honor her birthday,
I'm gonna spruce the old gal up a bit.
now, for starters, My lovely niece Wanda is going to be joining our staff as the new bar back.
Wanda!
I'll also be bringing in a pool table for the back.
and I'm adding a new signature cocktail to our menu.
we don't have any signature cocktails on the menu.
which might be why we never make Esquire's list of top 100 bars in America.
and to turn up the heat, we gonna make it a contest.
Shelley vs. Wade.
whoever comes up with the best signature cocktail gets to name it.
Yay. And... gets 500 bucks.
Oh, my God. May the best person win.
I can help you if you want. I'm real good at drinking.
come on, Wanda. Oh.
dad, you okay? Can I get you a pillow?
another pillow? Do you want me to call the nurse for you?
stop fussing, George, I'm fine. How about this? Is that better?
you're a good son.
Yeah, I'm...
what's all that?
Oh, um, it's just a few things I brought to make it a little homier.
I found some saltwater taffy for you to enjoy after surgery.
it's banana flavored.
I feel tired all of the sudden.
maybe I ought to just close my eyes, huh?
of course.
God, he looks pale, doesn't he?
baby, he's sick, but after the surgery, he's gonna be just fine.
I still can't believe that Zoe made that phone call.
I mean, I don't know how we're ever gonna be able to repay her.
well, I mean, you know, she called her father.
it's not like she called the president.
lemon, you don't know what you're talking about.
Zoe calling her father is... is just about the same as you calling your mother.
so, it is a huge deal.
I'm sorry, I... I had no idea, George. I know you didn't.
you know what, Lemon?
just, from now on, just keep all that nonsense to yourself 'cause I don't want to hear it anymore.
George, I'm... The truth of the matter is, if you wouldn't have made me get in that stupid fight with my dad, he probably wouldn't be laying in that bed right now.
so, if you want to be mad at somebody, Lemon, you go ahead and be mad at yourself.
all right, just remember, keep it short and simple, and then after the surgery, That's when you hit him with the big punches.
that's him.
Zoe. It's good to see you.
wasn't sure you'd be here. Well, I am.
I'm glad you are.
Dr. Hart?
good afternoon, I'm Dr. Brady, chief of staff.
it's an honor to meet you. What's the cardiac output?
31%. Patient was incubated last night. Prep for mitro valve replacement.
coronary artery bypass and Teflon graft.
this is Dr. Hart; she's going to be assisting me in surgery this afternoon. I am?
Yes, I am.
uh, we hadn't anticipated...
that is Dr. Hart doesn't currently have privileges at this hospital.
so get her some.
uh, what happened to your cold face?
don't worry, the plan is still on track.
after the surgery, big fight. Okay.
Zoe, you coming? Yes, sir.
Kocher clamp.
must be difficult for you. Seeing him this way.
seeing who this way? Oh, you mean Mr. Tucker?
is that what you call him? I don't call him anything; I barely know the man.
you don't? But I thought...
cautery.
I was assuming that the relationship between you and his son was serious.
george and me? We don't have a relationship.
I mean, we're friends, but that's all.
Oh. Yeah.
but... Take over suction.
I need a drink.
how about an artisanal cocktail to celebrate spring in Alabama?
but I don't want to celebrate spring. Try that.
No! No! No!
no, it's nasty! What? Thought it was good.
go ahead and try that.
Oh, hell, no. No, I did not make that.
it's Shelley. She's putting stuff in your drinks. I saw her do it.
can't talk. Very busy.
Oh, you are going down like China town.
not 'cause you're Asian. 'Cause it rhymes. What is going on?
doing a contest. Best new cocktail wins 500 bucks.
daddy needs a new amp.
you can be my daddy.
thank you, Wanda.
did that girl just... grrr at you?
it happens. Point is, she's right, okay?
I should be doing this in my own home, but the amount of booze it would take... Let's do it. I'll buy.
Seriously? Why not?
this is exactly the kind of mindless fun
Lavon Hayes needs right now. Let's make some cocktails, baby!
my man! Yeah.
Dr. Hart, what is your recommendation if our pathology was a pseudo aneurysm?
um, surgical repair similar to ventricular rupture.
your recommendation?
coronary artery bypass and, uh, Teflon graft repair of the ruptured zone.
very good. Dr. Hart will now perform a resection of the damaged ventricle and closure defect.
you know, it's been a while since I've done one of those. Think you can handle it?
Absolutely. I agree.
retractor. Suction.
all good. Okay. Oh.
surgery was a success. He's gonna need to be on blood thinners from now on, but all...
but he's going to be okay? He's going to be okay.
Oh, Dr. Hart, thank you so much.
thank you. No worries. Dr. Hart, I don't know what to say. All I can say is...
all I can say is... You are an angel sent from heaven.
one little package. Oh, I didn't do anything.
Yes, you did. Yes, you did. You did everything. Thank you so much.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
thank you. And you're welcome.
you're welcome. Sure...
um, now, there are going to be some restrictions on Mr. Tucker for the next few weeks.
yeah? He should avoid climbing stairs. Okay, no stairs.
no lifting objects more than ten pounds. All right. Okay.
we probably hide the Scotch. I don't know if we can do that.
discourage the Scotch. Okay. Okay. Ah, but he did very well...
Crickett, meet me at my house in an hour. It's an emergency.
that was impressive work you did in there, Zoe.
thank you. Thanks.
no. Actually, I wanted to talk to you... I'm glad you called. It's...
uh... You go first.
okay. Um...
I've been meaning to call you for some time now, um, but my-my schedule has just been so hectic and...
Yeah, sure.
frankly, um...
it felt like a conversation that had to be in person.
the secret that your mother asked me to keep has been a strain on our relationship for far too long.
I know. I completely agree. Just because I'm not your father doesn't mean that we can't have another kind of relationship.
um, how do you mean?
well, for instance, we're both surgeons.
technically, that makes us colleagues.
that's an excellent foundation.
wouldn't you agree? I guess. You know, I just...
I've never really thought of it that way.
of course you haven't, 'cause we've been so mired down in what we can't be that we haven't fully explored the alternatives.
you mean, like, friends?
why not?
in fact, there's no pressing reason that I have to return to New York right away.
how would you like to have dinner tomorrow night?
in Blue Bell?
sure.
we can talk about the surgery, discuss your career, whatever you like.
Yeah, that sounds great.
call me Ethan.
sounds great.
is it Mr. Tucker? Is he dead?
do we have to postpone the wedding?
no.
Mr. Tucker is just fine, thank goodness. The surgery was a success.
thank goodness!
unfortunately, we do not have time to celebrate this wonderful news as, once again,
Zoe Hart is hell-bent on destroying me. What's she done now?
it's not about what she's done. It's what she's about to do.
what is she about to do?
never mind.
now that she and George are getting so close, she will have the opportunity to do it, which is why we have to bring down Zoe Hart once and for all.
so? Tell me everything.
uh, Mr. Tucker's surgery was a success. Well, I know that. I'm talking about the big blowout.
I mean, did you cry? Did he cry? What did you say?
what did he say? You know, actually, it wasn't that big a deal.
Really? 'Cause it seemed like an awfully big deal yesterday.
you know, it's possible that I may have overreacted.
Ethan and I are going to be friends.
Oh, that's lovely. Who's Ethan? My father.
I see.
well, actually, it-it kind of makes sense, you know, because technically, he's not my real father.
so it was unfair of me to yell at him as if he were my father since he's not.
cause he's Ethan.
right. My friend and colleague.
see, it's all very civilized.
uh, this may be none of my business, but that's a load of crap.
no judgment, obviously. Zoe, I got two kids.
one of 'em, I gave birth to, and the other I adopted.
and guess what? They're both my kids.
being a parent is about a hell of a lot more than biology.
that man is your father. Doesn't matter about what some blood test says.
look, he's offering me something here, Addy.
a chance for us to have something instead of nothing. I'm gonna take it.
and it would be great if you could be happy for me.
well, if you're happy, I'm happy.
I just hope you don't wake up one day and find you've still got all this anger inside you.
I keep a lot inside.
how else would I live in Blue Bell?
number 37: Water boarding.
many politicians are still debating the ethics of this particular form of torture, but...
uh, next.
right. Number 38: The Jenna.
Ooh, I used this one on Jenna Richman in our last pageant together.
it does require pepper spray and a sanitary napkin...
okay, enough. Enough, enough, enough, enough.
while I appreciate the quantity of ideas that you have come up with, dear, if we attempted half of them, Zoe Hart would laugh in our faces.
and the other half - though they would be fun - would get us arrested.
but A for effort, dear.
Oh, my God.
the answer's so obvious I can't believe I didn't think about it earlier.
well, what is it?
I... am gonna make...
Zoe Hart... my best friend.
but that is the opposite of what you asked me to do.
I would have made a totally different list.
Oh, Crickett, you know that saying - keep your friends close, and your enemies closer?
well, that's what I'm going to do.
George, I came here to tell you that you were right.
I've been acting like a petulant little girl when it comes to Zoe Hart.
I know that nothing is going on between you two, and it is just silly of me to act so terrible to her when she has been so good to our family.
do you really mean that?
I do.
and... I want to make things right, so I was thinking that maybe I could host a dinner, um, for Zoe and for her father.
but I mean, if I asked Zoe, there's no way that she would come.
but you know, if-if maybe you did, then...
I mean, I could do that, but Lemon, if this is just another one of your games, then I don't... It's not.
okay.
okay. I'll, uh...
I'll go over there later and ask her, and I'll tell you what she says.
Really? Oh. Okay, great.
well, um, I'll start working on the menu, then.
am I early?
no. Come in. Sit down.
make yourself comfortable.
I figured that we could have a quick tour of Bluebell, and then, you know, maybe find somewhere and have dinner. Although I should warn you.
there are only two places to eat, and one restaurant is a bar, so really only one restaurant.
I'll let you decide.
um, Fancie's it is. I, uh, like your place, by the way.
it's very homey. Oh, thank... Oh!
sorry. It's a little messy.
I was just trying to clean it up. What's this?
what?
PETTTION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
I'm sorry. I didn't know that was out here.
you're changing your name?
what's wrong with Zoe? Not my first name.
Hey, as long as you keep "doctor" in there somewhere.
guarantees you a table anywhere in New York.
right. I'll remember that.
so, uh, what's up first on the BlueBell tour?
are we heading over to your practice? Actually, you know what?
all of a sudden, I'm not feeling all that well.
Oh, no. Really? Yeah.
um, I catch y'all at a bad time? No, no. What's up?
um, well, I know it is extremely short notice, but I was hoping to convince you and Dr. Hart to join us at the Breeland estate this evening for a dinner in your honor.
what? Well, just to thank you for everything y'all did for my dad.
that's very generous of you, but unfortunately, Zoe is not feeling all that well.
Oh, it's not that big of a deal. Just a little headache.
Oh, okay, well, dinner's not gonna be for a little while, so maybe if you're feeling better by then...
I mean, I don't want to push you.
um, why don't I let you rest and we can skip the tour and then we can all have dinner together?
in a big group, right?
sounds good. The more the merrier.
fantastic. All right, I'll let Lemon know, and then, uh, does 7: 30 work for y'all?
Yeah, it works for me. Me, too. Great.
well, then I'll see you later. 'Kay.
okay.
are you sure this is food?
because I have never seen these words in any cook books I know.
？？？？It's the food of Zoe's people.
the idea is to make her feel comfortable as fast as possible.
and you're sure all this starch is gonna make Zoe like you?
well, I mean, obviously, we're not gonna become best friends right away, but the idea tonight is just lay the foundation, compliment her clothing, feign interest in her career, and then stick up for her when Daddy says something horrible.
and then hopefully, in a week or two I should be able to invite her to our wedding.
you want her at your wedding?!
well, of course I don't want her at my wedding.
it's just the only thing I could think of to keep her away from George.
I mean, a girl can't break up a wedding that she's invited to attend.
can she? You're a genius.
I - I want to bathe in this.
Ah, she's a beauty, ain't she? Can you taste the lavender in there?
it's real subtle, but I think it balances out the flavor nicely.
Wade, my friend, you have a gift.
no, man, you know, it's just booze.
don't take much to make it taste good. No, I disagree; this takes talent.
and you have clearly got it. Just stupid fun, man, that's all.
look, here's the thing.
when I was a kid, I used to love throwing the football around in the backyard with my brothers.
and at the time, you know, I thought I was just goofing off and having fun.
I had no idea all that fun was gonna turn into a career in the NFL.
point is, you never know where all this could lead, man.
uh, y-you know, uh... I'm just bartending while I figure out what I'm doing with the rest of my life.
Yeah. But, uh, hey...
try this on for size.
all right, what we got here is something extra special, fresh off the presses.
well, I am upset. Why would she do that?
I've been her doctor for, what, 20, 25 years...
okay, just follow my lead, and we'll be fine.
Oh! They're here!
that is such a beautiful purse.
let me take that for you; I'll put it away.
Thanks. Mm-hmm.
uh, we're having latkes for dinner?
Oh, yes. This is just the amuse-bouche.
I thought that your father would appreciate a kosher meal.
Oh, he's not Jewish; my mother is. Really?
well, that is fascinating.
there is just so much I don't know about you, Zoe Hart.
how about we sit next to each other at dinner, and you can tell me more about your ethnic origins.
why don't we all get started on the first course.
Oh, um, Daddy, before I forget.
I saw your patient Maggie Thornhill this morning... Oh, no.
what is it? Well, uh, y'all are gonna have to excuse me.
Anna Carver's water just broke; she's having twins.
look at that! But, Daddy? Daddy?
do you need help? I've been delivering babies my whole life - haven't needed help yet.
Ethan, uh, thank you, pleasure. And, everybody, just enjoy your dinner.
excuse me. You bet. Good luck, Brick. Good night.
anyway, um, I just... just wanted to say thank you.
it was so great of you to come all the way down here just for my family. I...
you know, I hear from people all the time that surgeons are cold and selfish people, and I have to tell you, from my experience, it couldn't be further from the truth.
how many surgeons do you know?
well, uh... two, I guess.
you and Zoe. And how well do you know Zoe?
I'm not so sure what you mean.
I mean, your relationship must be fairly significant for her to have called me here.
Zoe doesn't ask for favors very often.
Oh, I mean, you know, it was very generous of... of her as well. It's...
would've made sense if you two were an item.
uh, yeah, you know, I could see how you might think that, but no, I'm...
I'm with Lemon, so... The blond one. Yeah, I got that.
my point is, Zoe must care for you a great deal.
no, we are... we're, we're just good friends.
that's all.
good.
sorry. Uh...
I freshen you up there, or...? Excuse me, I have to take this.
Oh, yeah. Of course.
Oh, there you are.
it's a pretty painting, isn't it?
used to be in Daddy's study, but I thought that it deserved to be on more of a prominent display.
Yeah, it's nice. My goodness, Zoe Hart, there is just...
so much that I don't know about you.
you are just a connoisseur of art.
Oh, my goodness, where are my manners?
I still have not yet offered you a tour of our estate.
is everything all right? A patient of mine in New York; I had to take it.
Oh, you doctors - never a moment of peace.
okay, now that you're back, we can officially start dinner.
actually, I need to speak to Zoe for a moment in private.
of course.
I think we should go, don't you? We can't leave yet.
dinner hasn't even started. Is there a problem?
Yes. Actually, being here feels very... inappropriate.
what's inappropriate? Please, it's obvious that you have feelings for a man that is about to be married to another woman.
so?
so I'm worried that you might be getting into a situation where you could get hurt, Zoe. Wait, why should you be worried?
I mean, we're only colleagues, remember?
Zoe, look... What?
the way you're talking to me right now, it's almost like you're my dad!
but that is crazy. Right, Ethan?
okay. I-I... I can see that you're upset.
Oh, yeah? Well, why should I be upset?
because the one man that I have looked up to my entire life, the man who I thought was my father up until eight months ago, abandoned me?
stopped returning my phone calls without any explanation as to why!
turned me into the kind of girl who was so desperate for affection, she doesn't know how to be in relationships with men!
look, I didn't know that you were angry. Of course I'm angry!
I have every right to be, okay? I don't want to be your frickin' friend.
in fact, I would rather go back to having no relationship with you at all than having some crappy fake one.
so if you have nothing else to say to me, why don't you go back to New York.
lemon! You know what?
I - I think I will take that tour, after all.
all right, all right, all right, now, our final signature cocktail of the evening is brought to you by Shelley Ng.
I call it... The Vanilla Viper!
Ooh! It tastes like a cupcake.
that was the idea. All right, all right, now all the drinks are in - it's time to cast your votes.
all those in favor of Wade Kinsella, raise your hand!
come on, come on!
all right, all right, those in favor of Shelley Ng, raise your hands!
congratulations, Shelley Ng.
you are our winner.
there something wrong with this girl?
sorry about that, man.
I thought you had it in the bag. It's all right.
it's, uh, it's only a contest.
I can be your consolation prize.
well, appreciate it, Wanda. Maybe some other time.
and the staircase is original.
it was hand carved by my granddaddy many, many, many years ago.
you know what, uh, thanks for the tour, but I think I'm gonna get going.
no, but we haven't had dinner yet, and I made all this food for our party.
I don't think there's much of a party anymore.
it's just me, you, and George. So what?
you know what?
I've been thinking the three of us need to spend more time together anyway.
and...
...I have made a huge...
error in judgment, and you simply must come to our wedding.
sorry.
what's so funny? Come on.
you want me at your wedding about as much as I want to go to your wedding.
Oh, so you don't want to come to my wedding now?
well, frankly, that just really hurts my feelings. Cut the crap, Lemon.
OK, I don't know what crazy plan you had for tonight, but I'm sure there was something devious going on.
how dare you, after everything that I've done tonight to make everything... Look,
I know that you know that I know.
and you're probably thinking that I'm going to tell George.
but there's something that you need to understand.
I'm never telling George or anyone else, for that matter.
well, forgive me if I don't believe you.
why would you do that for me? I'm not doing it for you.
but Lavon is my best friend, and I would never betray his trust.
Plus, why would I want to be the person to tell George?
why wouldn't you?
because I have no interest in being the person to break George's heart.
but, for what it's worth,
I do think that you should tell him.
glass of wine? Shot of tequila?
Oh, rough night? Weird night. Huh.
turns out that Lemon isn't the complete psychopath I thought she was.
but unfortunately, my father is.
you were with Lemon?
and how is she?
are you drunk?
we're, uh, we're calling it tipsy.
he is the mayor, after all. Keep it down.
I've never seen drunk Lavon. He's so cute.
thank you.
I like myself. Oh, boy.
so, I take it, uh... I take it things didn't go too well with your dad?
turns out that you were wrong. I was able to tell him off.
but, in doing so, I completely ruined any chance of having a relationship with the man.
I'm sorry. No, that's okay, it's better this way.
you know, I would rather be honest than angry. That's beautiful.
honest and angry.
Mmm, damn that's good.
I am going to go home, though, and erase the last 48 hours from my mind.
see you guys later. Bye-e-e-e.
guess you won't be needing this, so I'll just take it.
that's all.
you-you didn't serve this tonight.
you tanked the contest. Can't prove that.
wait, well, I don't understand why would you do something like that?
look, I'm not gonna give Mayner my best stuff.
I got to save some of my own ideas for my own menu.
for when I open my own bar.
love it. Love it. Come on, now.
people really do leave their doors open in small towns, huh?
I'm not good with confrontations.
I think that one of the reasons that I, uh, chose cardiothoracics was because I knew that by the time my patients got to me, they wouldn't have time to argue.
I don't understand.
I knew what I was offering you was crap.
I was just hoping you would take it so that we wouldn't have to do this part.
this part is hard.
which part?
the part where I tell you how wrong I was.
that I screwed everything up, and I didn't know how to make it any better, so I just didn't
but...
you're right to hate me, Zoe.
I don't hate you.
I just don't understand why you did what you did.
I was mad at your mom.
and then at you, even though it wasn't your fault.
I couldn't even look at you after I found out the truth.
and then it just became easier to take surgeries out of town.
to do lectures.
anything to keep me away from dealing with you, because...
I literally didn't know...
how to be your father anymore.
so, I just quit.
and then you called me the other day, and I thought maybe I could find another way to be with you.
you seemed open to the idea.
but when I saw you with George, I just felt so protective, and my paternal instincts just kicked in, and I didn't want to see you get hurt.
and I know that's not fair.
because I know that I have...
I've hurt you more than anyone.
I'm so sorry, Zoe.
do you think you could ever be my daughter again?
even when I was mad, I never stopped being your daughter.
then maybe you can wait a little while before you officially change your last name?
because I can't imagine you being anyone other than Zoe Hart.
Dr. Zoe Hart.
mister.
I know these past few days haven't been easy, and I have not been easy on you.
baby, you have been under so much stress.
I understand. I know you do.
I can't...
you're not the reason my dad had a heart attack, and it was wrong of me to say those things.
I was just... I was upset and... I know, baby, I know.
I just was looking for someone to blame.
and this Zoe thing, I just... I feel like... Hey.
let's not talk about Zoe Hart anymore.
okay. Okay?
in fact, why don't you and I head over to the Rammer Jammer, because I think that you and I need to have a good time.
I think it sounds amazing.
I do, unfortunately, I promised my mom that I'd go back to the hospital tonight, so... I'll go with you.
no.
no, you know what, I want you to go on ahead to the Rammer Jammer; I think you should have a good time, because, baby, hey, you deserve it.
all right.
just one drink.
just one. One drink.
drive safe. I will. I'll call you so as I get there.
I love you. Love you, too.
have fun. Not too much fun, though.
Hello, Mr. Mayor.
you were right.
I mean... I think you might have been right.
have you been drinking?
well, I've been thinking maybe...
I told you about Zoe because I wanted you to tell George.
what the hell?
one drink. One drink.
I keep thinking about it; would it be so bad if he found out? Oh, Lavon, don't.
cause if he broke up with you I would be here, Lemon.
I would be here for you.
I'm sorry.
watch out!
you seriously can't feel pain?
it's called idiopathic neuropathy.
chief Wournos, this is...
special Agent Audrey Parker.
this could be why I thought I recognized you.
we found that in our newspaper archives from 27 years ago.
all right, I have a theory. - Surprise.
there are two different Havens.
there's the one that's right beneath the surface, and then there's one right underneath that.
this is a whole new world.
did you see anything? - Yeah.
a big metal bowl crushed my place.
you like it. The weirdness.
I've seen this movie.
you know, you have a very rare talent.
you see things the way they are.
crap.
all right, can we at least agree...
that whatever's going on here, this is not normal?
Yeah.
damn it.
Hey!
Hey, what
Eleanor, what are you doing?
teaching the summer people where not to park.
what? It's a perfectly good parking spot.
back in '87, the Gibson girl got hit by a car.
she couldn't see it, because the car parked here...
blocked the sight line, so no one parks here now.
and how exactly am I supposed to know that?
what about posting a sign?
gah, why does everything in this town have to be such a huge secret?
no one'll talk to you about your mother, eh?
apparently, I don't have the secret password yet.
well, you stick out, Audrey.
you gotta learn to be a local.
for instance, Larissa's baked goods are too dry.
ROSEMARY'S are better.
Ah, give it 10 or 15 years, kiddo, you'll be fine.
Hey, where's the Haven hunt club?
so what is this exactly?
I'm picturing a lot of deer heads...
staring down at everyone.
Yep, except most of the hunting is guys using shots of whiskey to bring down business deals.
exclusive.
well, not that exclusive.
they let my father join.
you mean the chief?
I mean my father.
this is his personal life.
and, uh, it's not yours, apparently.
Nope. Not a big fan of killing for fun.
all right, so who's the victim?
divorced, old money.
consensus says it was a wolf attack, but we'll have to analyze the fur to make sure.
probably rabid.
they think it broke the window to get in.
but you don't?
rabid wolves bite and run.
they don't feed like this.
but they break into cars, apparently.
all right, so what, he used his head to bash in the window?
I mean, unless he's as numb as you are, or he just really, really wanted to get in.
something about this just feels creepy.
full moon last night.
Oh, look at you, trying to make a werewolf joke.
you know, you should smile more often.
people will know when you were joking.
probably.
we got a problem.
manager says that Holt was arguing with a guy named Brad Donnelly when he left last night.
all right, and the problem is?
my father. They're both friends of his.
you want to blame this on Brad Donnelly?
how does that even begin to make sense?
chief, wolves don't just
look, don't be telling me what they do, what they don't do.
I'm looking at what one of 'em did.
that animal's got to be killed, that's it.
before it teaches other wolves to break into cars?
we're gonna organize a hunt.
put out the call for volunteers. You're helping on this.
putting dozens of men in the forest...
blasting at everything that moves is not a good idea.
you see? That's exactly where you're wrong.
if we don't investigate and something comes out later, it'll look like you were covering for your buddies.
look, it's gonna take some time to organize your hunt.
all right? So just give us the day.
okay, take the day.
nothing else better happen.
what were T. R. and Donnelly fighting over?
a woman. I don't know who.
was it the kind of fight worth killing someone over?
how would I know?
these guys live to piss on each other.
go find Landon, talk to him.
I think he's around here somewhere.
owns the dry cleaners over on prince?
Yeah.
he hangs around here a lot ever since his wife died in that fire.
I heard T. R. and Donnelly damn near blew his head off a couple of days ago, fighting about something.
whenever you're ready, Landon.
pull!
didn't lead it enough.
Oh, no, you led it fine. Your aim was just low.
I think I can tell, thanks.
okay, if you think so.
I'm sure you think you could do better?
Oh, by better, do you mean hit the target?
here.
school me.
all right.
keep 'em coming.
pull.
pull.
all right, how many of these do I need to do?
my shoulder's starting to get sore.
I have been to school, and I have learned.
can we go talk for a minute, Landon?
you all know why we're here.
T. R.'s dead.
I want parties to start up by the Derry road, come back across state land.
we'll drive the sucker to the sea.
who's game?
excuse me. Gentlemen, Mr. Donnelly.
detective, you joining in?
no, sir.
neither are you.
I need you all to stand down.
I know you all want to get the animal that did this.
that's understandable.
but the chief has asked that we hold off till tomorrow.
you saw the car, Wuornos.
what's to investigate?
go on, everybody.
go on.
gillespie said that you had been shot at?
yeah? Well...
it's no big deal.
getting shot at is always a big deal.
you were with T. R. and Donnelly, right?
Yeah, but, uh...but...
you don't think you were the target?
no.
all right, so who was shooting at who?
all right, listen, I don't mean to cause any trouble here.
I just--I need to know what happened.
Donnelly fired, a bullet hit a tree right next to me, okay?
scared me half to death.
Donnelly shot at T. R.?
I hate to think so.
accidents do happen out there.
Mr. Donnelly, we want to talk to you.
wait, I've seen you around.
you're that FBI girl, Parker.
Oh, keen eyes.
makes me wonder how you missed that shot that you took at T. R. the other day.
coincidences make me curious.
T. R. wasn't shot, and I didn't shoot him.
there's a coincidence for you.
but you were fighting with him.
T. R. And I were like brothers.
fought, drank, raised hell...
like brothers.
nobody's gonna miss that poor bastard more than me.
Donnelly's hiding something.
besides his charms? Yeah, I don't doubt it.
but I'm not buying murder by animal.
Oh, there they are.
Landon confirmed that T. R. shot at Donnelly?
Landon didn't really know one way or another.
just the people we were looking for.
don't have anything, for you, fellas.
unless you want a pastry.
are those Larissa's?
you bet they are.
pass. - You should try Rosemary's.
Oh, so I've heard.
Hey, uh, can we talk off the record?
that sounds exciting.
he says that when the waiter offers to pepper his salad.
what do you guys know about T. R. and Donnelly?
apparently, they were quarrelling over a woman.
Oh, there's that Jess Minion woman.
she's some kind of animal rights and wrongs person.
the word's "activist," Vince.
she's a witch.
got that right.
they were fighting over her?
with maybe, not over.
I mean, everyone at the club agrees she's a pain in the ass.
only if you like shooting animals.
okay, wait, wait. You're a member of the club, Dave?
35 years.
more likely, uh, they were fighting over Brad Donnelly's wife, Susanna.
the dead guy had something with Donnelly's wife?
that's what people were saying, anyway.
it was mostly Dave saying it.
well, even a rumor of adultery can be enough.
Oh, yeah.
these are awful.
that's what you've got?
Yeah.
if you take the gossip down at that club serious, half the town would be locked up.
half the town isn't dead.
not yet.
they expedited your lab work.
they just confirmed an "unusual event," like we didn't already know that.
there's gotta be a connection with Donnelly here, I know it.
officer Parker, you can know it later, after we get that wolf.
this wasn't an ordinary wolf attack.
this town's scared.
mayor wants a curfew, and I am this close to ordering it, so unless there's some real evidence...
that you haven't seen fit to mention...
let's get it rolling. The hunt's on.
Donnelly and T. R. both within 24 hours?
that doesn't just happen.
don't get a lot of wolf attacks inside people's garages, either.
how are you stocked for silver bullets?
funny.
I'm not sure that was a joke.
full moon was last night.
how many nights do werewolves get?
there are rules? Who says?
same guy who says silver bullets actually work.
come on, let's go talk to his wife.
we have reports the men were fighting over a woman.
you assumed it was me.
but I bet it was that Jess Minion woman.
she's been hexing us.
you didn't know?
right there.
she told Brad it was some kind of Micmac witch mark.
supposed to say something to the animals about us.
Thanks, Susanna. If we need you, we'll be in touch.
sure, but...
soon as probate clears, moving back to Tallahassee.
okay, I've seen that mark before...
at the hunt club.
you really think this Jess Minion is a witch?
what? We were just talking about werewolves a second ago, and now witches are out of bounds?
she's an animal rights activist, and I saw this mark at the site of the two other attacks.
witch or not, she's a person of interest.
okay. So let's be interested.
took you long enough.
I was expecting you last night.
you've been waiting for us?
T. R. Is dead, he hated me.
seemed inevitable you'd show up here.
you're Audrey Parker, federal Agent in exile, and you are Nathan Wuornos, detective, son of chief, and I'm Jess Minion, suspect du jour.
you seem to know a lot for someone who's only been here for a year.
you're a quebecer, aren't you?
Quebecoise, yeah.
you checked up on me, too.
this was my grandmother's farm.
I summered here as a child.
now it's mine.
all right, back to why T. R. hated you...
I have 90 acres here.
I'm letting it go back to what it wants to be.
I don't let the club hunt on it.
I've heard reports you've taken a few potshots at them out there.
5: 00 in the morning, how can you tell a banker from a thief?
hard enough in full daylight, right?
can you explain this?
it's a Micmac hieroglyph.
it means offering forgiveness.
are you aware that Brad Donnelly died last night...
the same way T. R. did?
by a wolf.
I guess they didn't forgive him.
come with me.
each of those stones marks an animal that's died on this land.
wounded by guns, maimed by traps, poisoned.
one step from being stuffed and put on display.
your people kill animals, too.
we use them, we don't mock them.
if the spirits of these animals come knocking at the doors of these guys, looking for revenge, it's not a crime.
that is justice.
ms. Minion, why do people think that you're a witch?
maybe because they don't like the way I think.
so you're not a witch.
what's a witch?
someone who does magic?
what do you think the troubles are?
magic is everywhere here.
it's in the soil, the water, in us.
you suffer so much because you can't understand what's happened to you.
you know it's not a medical condition, but you don't want to face the real truth.
you've been transformed by magic.
you're not less, Nathan. You're more.
the only thing wrong with you is your perspective.
so where were you last night around 8: 00 P. M?
relax.
I didn't kill anyone.
if you want to check, call the triple-a.
had my car towed in Derry.
easy enough. Thanks for you time.
anytime.
I don't believe she's a witch.
whatever she is, she's interesting.
Brad Donnelly death is still under investigation.
guys, we don't have time for this.
what do you think about the reward?
reward?
club members pitched in to put a bounty on this wolf.
they're shooting for $10, 000.
terrible, isn't it?
Yeah, about time. People are scared.
we'll keep you posted.
all right. Okay, so what do we have?
we have a wolf inside Donnelly garage, but do you buy a wild animal stalking its prey indoors?
no, and we have another broken window.
it's back to human help.
an animal trainer? Drugged animals?
but getting in and out unnoticed?
tough sell.
what if it's not an animal trainer, but more like, uh, you know, an animal whisperer?
somebody who's, I don't know, but can make animals do things.
like an evil Dr. Dolittle?
or, you know, like a witch.
come on. Jess gave the easiest alibi to check.
here.
Oh, wait, what difference does it make about the alibi?
I mean, if you can compel animals to do something, you don't have to be there when it happens.
okay, this is ridiculous.
just because you like her, that doesn't give her a free pass.
okay, tell me you got something.
we have a theory. - We have nothing.
animals are going crazy, and, somehow, someone is causing the attacks.
Nathan's right. You got nothing.
in the club, one hour.
Oh, bring shotguns.
these really are better.
ROSEMARY'S are the best.
what are you doing here, Bud?
he woke up lonely for his daddy.
mom.
he was so worried about you, though, honey, going out hunting again after what happened the other day.
mom, he's four.
he's not worried about me.
fine.
I don't want you to go. That better?
well, at least you're being honest.
so come on home with us, please.
it's us three with the chief.
this is gonna be fun.
Oh, yeah.
all kinds of fun.
they're gonna be blasting at their shadows all day.
Where's Vince?
he doesn't hunt.
he loves all creatures great and small, he says, usually with fries.
hold up.
this is the back end of the Minion farm.
it's posted, we can't go in.
ever hear of hot pursuit?
Hey, this direction isn't any more likely than another.
or any less.
look this is all part of our area to sweep.
we're going in. Let's go.
this is a bad idea.
starting to look like my definition of a good day's hunting.
starting to look like my definition of a good day's hunting.
what?
we're gonna eat lunch before anything lunches on us.
No!
what are you doing?
it was a dog!
I don't think you hit it.
of course not, you hit my gun!
Yeah, I hit your gun! It was Jess Minion's pet!
Oh, my God. It's stuffed with rags and sand.
so much for the werewolf theory.
Yeah, we have real evidence now, but I have no idea what to do with this.
teagues gotta get checked out. We gotta get him out of here, okay?
okay. What do you want us to do with this?
let me worry about this.
what I want you two is get the hell out of here and just stop this nonsense.
nonsense? Like this hunt?
you think this plays out better in the middle of main street, Nathan?
is that what you think? Would you just go get teagues for me like I asked you. Thanks.
like now.
Oh, nice. You know he saved your life, right?
who do you think's been dealing with all this...
before you graced us with your presence?
who do you think's gonna be dealing with it after I'm gone?
I wanted you in this job because you had a knack with dealing with all this crap.
I'm just praying to God some of it rubs off on him.
you know what, he's a lot better at this than you think.
well, I tell you what, Agent Parker. This is a lot worse than what you think.
how you doin', Dave?
that's a weird-lookin' moose. - Oh, man.
I'm perfect.
Yeah, perfect. Let's get you home.
all right, we need to go talk to Jess.
I know.
Jess being sympathetic to your problem, it makes a lot more sense if she's troubled, too.
well, if she is, how do we stop it?
if she is, does she want it to be stopped?
you hear that?
are you guys happy now?
believe it or not, it's not my favorite sound, either, all right?
but we don't have time for this.
we've had three animal attacks.
at least one of them was stuffed.
stuffed? You're joking, right?
both of us were almost killed by one of these things.
I'm sorry that happened, Nathan, but I cannot help you.
Jess, if you're troubled, you might not even be aware you're doing it.
you might just think it's part of...
whatever rituals you're doing.
I'm not doing any rituals.
I'm not a witch or a shaman or anything like that.
the only Micmac was my mother's mother, and she was a half-blood.
most of what I know is just...Stories, third-hand legends.
the hieroglyph?
wikipedia.
I'm not troubled, Nathan.
I'm just... I'm just me.
if I had any kind of power, officer Parker, those animals never would have died in the first place.
all right, thanks. I think we're done here.
everything I said about you is still true.
no werewolf... and no witch.
how about some old-fashioned physical evidence?
taste.
the final frontier.
look.
Oh, man.
we're gonna need some help.
well, at least clean-up will be easy.
the rags will wipe up the sand.
something smells off.
might be this.
wolfie had a bedtime snack.
could be a match for T. R.'s...
well, you want to fill me in on everything?
or are my services no longer required?
no, I think we have it from here, thank you.
Yeah, you keep telling yourselves that.
doesn't have to be true to make you feel better.
good luck.
what don't you want her to know?
you know the moose that attacked your dad?
this plaque says that he shot one up in arrow
Aroostook.
two years ago? - Uh-huh.
you think that was the same one?
do you see a moose?
wolfie over there, shot by Donnelly.
this one by T. R. Holt.
the animals are coming alive and killing the people who killed them.
and then they just go back to being stuffed?
see this? I found this on wolfie over there.
all of them have them.
"C. L. - 6," what does that mean?
I don't know what it means, but between the plaques and the tags, we have a timeline.
and the most recently killed is coming alive first.
there's some animals missing.
all right, so the first question is, what's bringing them back?
no.
first one is, where's the bear?
who killed it?
would you just take your damn allergy medicine already?
no one cares if it makes you feel slow.
no one would notice anyway.
what? Do you need something?
help!
help! We're trapped!
somebody call the police!
help! - He's breaking the door!
somebody!
kill it! - Go.
it took both of our shotguns to blow the head off that moose.
these things are useless. - Ideas?
Yeah, let's turn up the heat.
I see claws! And hot claws, too!
help! No!
I see claws, too!
all right, fire in the hole!
those are better than silver bullets.
that was damndest thing I've seen in ages!
you can be a little less thrilled, Vince.
it almost killed me. - I know!
all right, I know that you guys are excited, but we really need to discuss how you're gonna write about this.
you're worried how it'll look in the Herald?
does it have to look like anything?
what do you think it's gonna look like, Dave?
rabies? - Right time of year.
Oh, don't worry. We'll think of something, dear.
we always do.
Hey, do you guys, uh...
do you recognize this?
it came off of the animal that attacked T. R.
maker's mark.
my bear had one just like it.
C. L.- 6. - Initials?
"Canis lupus number six" is my bet.
probably means it's the sixth wolf that Landon Taylor stuffed.
I recognize his mark.
Hey, Landon?
I'm back here, cleaning up this mess.
looks like another attack.
what happened?
I just came in and found this.
do you think this was one of those rabid animals?
the animals aren't rabid.
you've heard about the troubles, haven't you?
the troubles.
we found this inside an animal that was killed while attacking someone.
recognize this stuffing?
all the attacking animals are stuffed by you.
this is, uh...
this is ours.
it came from the moose the chief killed two years ago.
the animals are killing the people who killed them, and yours must be coming after you, too.
if that's true, they'd all have to be destroyed. I mean, all of them...
I have to end this.
what are you doing here?
we just came for Landon's help.
stay away from my son.
you're making a mistake. He has nothing to do with this.
mom, stop.
Landon, get in the car. Go!
go!
piper, don't! - Mom!
Landon, your arm.
How...?
let me go! He needs me!
No! No, Landon, wait!
Landon, no!
he didn't stuff himself. He's not the cause of this.
it's my fault. It's all my fault.
he said he wanted to destroy all the animals.
he can't do that. - Why?
I can feel them.
they're all waking up.
but I thought Landon was the taxidermist.
he was. I never sewed them.
I just gave him some of my sewing rags.
I--I had no idea that would be enough to...
to bring them back?
when I found him in the fire, his wife was burned.
I--I couldn't save her.
but Lanny wasn't...
he must have just suffocated.
he looked like he was still alive.
I couldn't help myself. I just
I just couldn't help myself.
so you said that you could feel them waking up?
when Landon came back, I felt it.
but then everything was fine until...
he almost got shot the other day.
and this feeling, it just kept getting stronger and stronger.
well, from what I've seen, the stress, it makes these things worse.
my father warned me to be careful.
I thought I was.
all I ever wanted to do was to keep him safe.
Landon, stop!
piper, stay here. - He's my son.
easy, guys, we're on your side.
speak for yourself.
damn it. We gotta hurry.
I'm sorry, but I made you, and I have to stop you.
Landon, we have to get you out of here!
the animals you killed are waking up!
they're coming for you!
Landon! Wait!
mom! Open up!
we have to kill them!
this is my fault. - Mom!
I started this! - Piper.
Piper! - Mom!
if they kill me, they stop and won't come after you!
now go!
mom, get out of there!
it ends with me.
mom!
mom.
they killed three wolves today.
God knows what else.
is the rabies story sticking?
not sure I care.
one way or another, we'll make everyone think it's all right.
it is, Nathan.
it's better, anyway.
I think it was the fire that caused...
Piper's condition to flare up, and then she, uh, revived Landon.
so when Landon was almost shot...
her condition went into overdrive.
so what are we gonna tell him?
the truth.
I'm sorry about what happened to your mother.
we're destroying all the animals that your mom brought back just to be safe.
except for me.
or did you change your minds about that?
Landon, this doesn't have to be so bad.
you still have Zach to live for.
is that what I'm doing?
living?
I'm not even real, officer Parker.
I can't feel that.
you and I have a lot in common.
we're different, but you know what?
doesn't make us any less than anyone else.
in some ways, maybe it makes us even more.
you've been this way for how long?
six months?
Yeah.
were you any less a father to him?
did he even notice?
no.
that's right.
cause you're more than this.
maybe even a little magic.
maybe that's true.
do you really believe that, that you're magic?
not quite.
well, you just saved that man's life.
it may not be magic, but it's sure is close.
what now?
did someone else die?
actually, yes.
that's not why I'm here.
I came to say I'm sorry.
you're sorry?
what you said was true.
I don't know...
I don't know about magic, but I'm definitely something...
different.
or I could be.
I kind of like you the way you are.
do you want to get some pancakes?
I don't like pancakes.
but I'd love to have eakfast with you.
you wanted to see me, kiddo?
Hey, thanks for coming.
listen, there's aot going on around here...
but nobody is telling me, and for some reason...
I trust you, Eleanor.
that's your first mistake.
you did the M. E. Report, right?
you saw what I saw.
you saw what was left of Piper.
I saw a lot of rags thrown around the room.
exactly.
and that's what's going into your report, too, isn't it?
sure.
cause that's what goes in a report, right?
piper was stuffed, and then she stuffed her son.
it must have been going on for generations, and I just
I just-- I couldn't write that down.
I'm guessing you didn't tell Landon the truth, either.
no.
I thought if something awful happened to his boy that...
well, if he knew, then he would be tempted... to stuff him, to...
but I--I just don't feel right about this.
this is just another secret that's gonna play itself out all over again.
you do what you can...
and the world goes on.
here.
this'll make you feel better.
is that Rosemary's? - Yeah.
I'm gonna do what I can...
to help you find out about your mum.
wait, you would do that?
well we gotta stick together up here.
you're not a summer person anymore, kid.
it's the troubles, isn't it?
maybe it's some kind of cosmic test of our character.
you seriously can't feel pain? - No.
there are two different Havens.
there's the one that's right beneath the surface, then there's one right underneath that.
you, Nathan, live in both Havens.
you remember that woman that I look like?
in the Colorado kid pic? - Yeah.
do you think there's a chance that her name could be Lucy?
I gotta get out of here. - Could we pick this up later?
Hey, Duke.
on the menu this evening is a grilled tiger shrimp.
dinner, Friday night. Right.
don't even think about canceling on me, woman.
when I couldn't make our dinner, you met up with somebody else, didn't you?
I don't think I had friends. But I do now.
and so do you.
seriously... You dragged me out of bed at 8: 00 A. M. on a Saturday
Audrey, it's gonna take us a little while to get where we're going.
just relax.
can you just tell me where we're going?
I know, I know.
you can't explain it. You have to show it to me.
okay, then just tell me what this is about.
is... is this about the troubles?
buddha says all good things come to those who wait.
Yeah, and does Buddha also say, "drink, smuggle, and always look out for number one"?
I'm a reformed buddhist.
can't you just tell me where we're going?
I don't understand.
it's called carpenter's knot.
it's been in the carpenter family since forever.
the last of the carpenters is kind of a hermit.
you know, he closed down the hotel and pulled up the red carpet when I was a kid.
now, I hear...
that the grounds and resort are very special.
you hear?
you said you saw something that you had to show me.
well, I may have embellished about that.
practically smell the history, can't you?
Yeah, I can smell something.
this place gives me the creeps.
all right, now are you gonna tell me why...
surprise!
happy Birthday!
got ya.
did you see your face? It was so...
it was very effective.
that was priceless!
are you crying? - No.
crying will not be tolerated today.
shut up! I am so armed.
nobody's ever thrown me a birthday party before.
so it's... It's pretty awesome.
well, after all you've already done for Haven, it's the least we could do.
I never even expected it.
I didn't even know you guys were plan...
I didn't even expect it from the girl I don't even know.
hello. Julia Carr.
I'm Eleanor's daughter. I just got back in town.
she was in Ethiopia... With the peace corps.
well, Darfur, actually, with doctors without borders.
well, thank you. Thank you for coming.
well, I brought Margarita mix.
will you marry me, please?
Julia here had the biggest crush on me when she was just a wee lass.
please, I put up with your hipster chin fuzz so you'd tell me cool
she loved me.
I'm gonna...
bell hops here.
Oh, are these all for me?
which one did you get me?
this box.
it's, uh, shiny. Thanks for coming.
I know you're not really in a party mood.
I wouldn't miss it.
I was worried about you after Jess, I...
Oh, I'm fine. I'm good.
drink Jack out of the bottle, listen to Patsy Cline, you know.
it's a man thing.
am I, uh, the last one here?
well, I always enjoy making an entrance.
I'm Vaughn Carpenter.
welcome to the knot.
hotel for the weekend.
Vaughn, thank you for having us.
Where's your better half?
why, she's, uh...
no longer with us.
we had a good life.
look at all of you!
the children are all grown up, and the old are as ugly as ever.
except, but of course, not you, Eleanor.
Oh, Vaughn.
here, I want to introduce you to the birthday girl.
Vaughn carpenter. Hi.
Hello, you...
well, you're the spitting image...
um, I'm sorry?
you look exactly like her.
Lucy Ripley? Did you know her? She's an old friend.
Oh, damn.
Oh, the power is temperamental with the weather.
uh, excuse me while I check on the generator.
I thought it'd be best for them to think you had passed, Olivia.
you sure you have to do this?
I'm getting weaker.
please be careful.
make sure they don't see you leave.
have a safe trip.
okay, everybody, let's take the presents to the table.
do you mind if we get settled in first, mom?
pick out rooms, that kind of thing, before you start, you know, cracking the whip.
I'm not cracking the whip.
I'm trying to get everybody organized.
I'm just saying maybe ask first.
anybody have a preference?
move... Do whatever you want.
all right!
Hey, if they still have bunk beds, I get dibs on the bottom.
no fair. You always call dibs.
that's 'cause I'm older, but I'm faster.
and you are short.
so you want me to, uh... You want me to go with you?
I'll help you... Help you pick out a room.
uh...I actually thought I'd walk the grounds before the rains hit.
well, you want me to just place your bag in one of the rooms up there?
uh, okay. Sure, yeah. Thanks.
well, that was interesting.
Yeah, that was a big bucketful of awkward.
Yeah, speaking of which, um...
I don't really do public displays of gift giving.
but I got you a gift.
actually, I was gonna go look for Mr. carpenter.
you know, he said that he knows Lucy, so I wanted to ask him some questions.
we just got here.
don't worry... You will have all weekend to catch up with the old
I'm sorry, did you say that you got me a gift?
what is it? Is it a pony? Forget it.
Nathan, are you in here?
anybody seen Audrey?
uh, just long enough to know she was looking for Mr. carpenter.
I left my birthday presents in her room.
figured she needed an outfit for the party.
she's gonna look fantastic.
Oh, sweetheart, would you get Vaughn and get him to find some matches?
I forgot to bring anything to light the cake with.
aye, aye, Captain.
and nath... Nathan. Where's... Nathan?
Oh, Nathan. Go find Audrey.
sorry I'm the last one here.
took me a little bit to figure out this whole glam thing.
my birthday's in march.
you like the decorations?
Dr. Carr, it's amazing.
this is a dragony, uh... Underwater.
underwater wonderland.
what is that? Is that a seahorse?
guys! Get in here!
what the hell is that?
Oh, get back, get back!
Parker. Thank you.
don't even touch it.
Oh, boy.
looks like...Moult.
Yeah, you're right.
was a chameleon. What?
chief. - Sorry, Nathan.
a shape shifter.
a monster.
for want of a better term, a chameleon.
and it's now shed Vaughn carpenter's form...
and found itself a new one.
one of ours.
somebody right here in this room...
is a chameleon.
which means one of us is a killer.
one of us is dead
I was a rookie the one time I saw one of these...
chameleon things.
I was just back from 'nam, where...Must have thought
I'd pretty much seen and done everything.
until I was forced to shoot my own partner right in the head.
to stop him from killing me.
you killed your partner? Chameleon killed my partner.
he was taking his shape, he was taking his personality, taking everything. I killed the chameleon.
but not before it had copied and killed six people.
now, 27 years on the job, and the only thing I've ever hoped for:
that I'd never have to see one of them again.
how do we stop it from... Taking someone else?
everyone just has to stay within earshot of everyone else.
cause this chameleon thing, it seems to need time with its victim in order to mimic its soul.
get jumped, you just scream as loud as you can.
what does it want?
it wants to kill, basically. It wants to change.
it wants to renew itself.
I think everyone in this room's pretty much well aware that the troubles are now back.
well, this thing's lived as Vaughn carpenter all these years.
well, when the troubles were gone.
now all of a sudden it wants to get active again.
it's killed one of us already.
and I guarantee it's not gonna stop at one.
hang on a second.
I'm trying to be zen about all this.
just so I'm clear...
you're saying that you haven't seen one of these chameleon deals since the Reagan administration.
and now...Of all the times and all the places, we just happen to get stuck in a storm inside it's damn lair?
I'm just curious how that happens.
we didn't happen to get stuck.
we were invited.
he called me. Vaughn.
said it had been too long.
said he'd heard about all the troubles in town, about the new F. B.I. Agent, and he wondered if we...
we'd like to come over for a visit.
and then Eleanor called. You did.
you called and you said you were looking for a place to throw Audrey a party.
I just thought it was fate!
you're trying to blame me? I was looking for...
well, what was I supposed to do?
okay, everybody quiet.
please, can we use our inside voices?
we should probably call the mainland.
let 'em know what's happening. Yeah, good luck with that.
I haven't gotten a signal since we got on the boat.
the land line's down too. I checked.
probably the storm knocked it out.
or the chameleon thing. Yep.
but Vaughn was gonna call a boat for us when we were... well,
well, now, there's a boathouse down by the water.
maybe there's a dinghy we can take back to the mainland.
no, no, no, no, no.
no one's taking any boat back to any mainland.
not until we're absolutely sure this chameleon is dead.
so, what, are you gonna stop me, old man river?
maybe you just want to keep me here so that you can eat me and take over my body.
I'm not taking any chances letting this killer loose on the mainland.
now, if you want to throw down there, yoga mat, you just feel free.
I've coughed up tougher than you.
Hey, if I may interrupt the Chuck Norris revival with some logic...
why don't we just go down to the boathouse and then decide what to do.
chief?
are you armed?
cause she is.
I mean, she's all "be cool" and whatnot.
she's got a gun.
how do we know she's not the thingamabob?
I am not the thingamabob.
ask me anything, all right?
What...The first boy that I kissed was when I was 18.
my favorite singer is Ray Charles.
ray Charles? Okay, fine. I lied.
it's Justin Timberlake.
and my middle name is Prudence, self-inflicted on my confirmation.
so we good now?
well, that may all be true, but...
we don't know you well enough to know.
one.
two.
that's one more than you knew that I had, and one I could have kept if I was a bad guy.
how's about...
a little gun for you.
and a little gun clip for you.
and big gun, you know, for you.
and big clip for...
not really enough to go around.
anybody else?
I'd certainly feel better if the other two badges weren't packing.
I got nothin'.
service weapon is up in my bag.
feel free to take it.
what about you, chief?
a gun... I was coming to a party.
look, there's nothing.
all right, then. Anybody else?
going once.
going twice.
okay, boat house, A. S.A. P.
okay.
you get that side?
Yep.
I'm not sure I...
just give it some slack, then pull.
thank you.
thanks for help at the hotel too.
what?
well, I was trying to calm everybody down, and you backed me up... Thank you.
what partners do.
it sucks.
you know, you were asking about Jess before.
it sucks.
but I appreciate you asking.
Yeah, that's what friends do.
found this, uh...
in the old storage trunk out there.
you know, once that dries out, it should work pretty fine.
looks like somebody hit pay dirt in here.
Yeah, well, let's find out.
all right.
looks like we found a boat. Now what?
it's the chief.
think about it.
if you're the chameleon, you take the one with power.
the one that everybody listens to.
the one with no social skills.
no, I... I take Nathan.
people listen to him. People like him.
Yeah. Nathan's a good choice.
but the point is, I wouldn't take me.
of course not.
why take an old man when there's so many other choices?
I wouldn't. Me, neither.
Decaf!
look like you could use some.
What'd you do?
nothing. - You took the cheese knife.
if I did, why wouldn't I tell you?
who knows why you do half the things you do?
Really?
now, you want to have this conversation now?
I'm sorry. Oh, I love you.
Please...Let's not fight.
I love you too, mom.
we should tell the others. And do what?
have them draw straws for a seat?
no, I mean, everybody's going crazy back there.
Yeah! So I lied about having a gun.
so sue me.
I made a call for the greater good. A tough call.
one day, you're gonna grow up, you're gonna have to do the same thing.
you left us stranded on this rock.
better than letting a killer loose on the mainland.
look, leaving this place is not really an option anymore.
basically, we either kill this son of a bitch, right here, right now, or it kills us.
got it?
well? No.
really, there's... No boat, no raft.
no nothing, really. Just a, uh...
some old lanterns. Couple thousand cockroaches.
little bitter luck on my trip to the attic.
you went to the attic by yourself? I thought we said to stay together.
I found a radio.
maybe I can fix it.
and, no... I don't need any help.
what can the rest of us do? We should find the victim.
we'll know who the chameleon is if we find the body.
Yeah, but a million places to hide a body in a house this size.
we better break up into teams.
what do you think?
so let's put the Hardy boys here with the bickersons.
why don't you go with them, Nathan? Parker, you're with me.
all right. Duke? - Party of one. Thanks.
I have work to do.
and I can't exactly do it if I'm carrying the radio around with me.
all right, thanks, everybody.
urban legend at my orphanage used to say that bad kids would get shut up in the walls.
so we used to do this to try to find 'em.
look how far I've come.
Hey, why didn't you pick Nathan for your team?
well, I thought the ladies needed a little protection.
that, and you couldn't stand to talk to your son for more than five minutes?
Well...Okay. That too.
he's in a dark place right now, you know.
he could really use a friend.
all the more reason for him not to have to talk to me, then.
there's something here.
Yeah, this is... This is boarded up.
I think this lifts right out. - Got it?
Oh, you know what that is? That's an old dumbwaiter.
Yeah, I guess they really don't need those things anymore.
doesn't matter. Good find.
nice job there, Parker.
wow, is that a compliment?
you think it would, you know, kill you to lay one of those on Nathan every once in a while?
the troubles are back.
getting all warm and fuzzy with Nathan is not exactly gonna do him any favors.
he's pretty tough.
he's gonna have to be tough as nails in order to deal with that on his own.
otherwise, it'll eat him alive.
still, that doesn't mean you can't be friendly.
now, friendship, that's a burden. I don't want to be a burden.
especially I'm leaving a whole world of troubles he's gonna have to fix.
let's go.
you okay? - I don't wanna die.
not here. Not like this.
you're not gonna die. Stop talking like that.
we're with you.
no offense, mom, but that's not real comforting.
for all I know, right now you could be a hell beast from the seventh circle, waiting for me to turn my back so you can rip off my face and wear it around town like a Halloween mask.
take it easy.
we're looking for a dead body, and one of us is a monster.
I mean, why do the most awful, horrible things keep happening in this god-forsaken town?
I should never have let you convince me to come back.
Hey, is everything okay?
I think we should switch teams.
don't fight me, okay?
still she tells me what to do.
sorry about before.
I kind of lost it.
it's an intense situation.
here I thought I was the queen of extreme.
you know, I left town wanting to walk the earth, have adventures, come back all knowing and wise.
figured dealing with my mom was a no-brainer at that point.
guess I should have stayed away longer.
not that it's any of my business or anything, but staying away, even though it's easier, you miss out on a lot of stuff too.
this is weird.
here's all the newspaper clippings.
including one of you.
what?
here's one of carpenter as a young man.
noted family's last heir receives final rites.
he had bacterial meningitis.
see how his body was wasting away?
and yet here he is, three days later, scion makes miraculous recovery.
doctors at a loss for explanation.
you don't recover from bacterial meningitis in three days.
he didn't.
the chameleon took his shape.
he's been living as carpenter for 27 years.
you think his wife knew ? - I think so.
look at the picture.
she's just got the best news ever...
her husband is going to live...
and she's... A million miles away, thinking of God knows what.
Yeah, but think... If she knew the choice that she had to make...
I mean, the love of your life is dying, and you could either, you know, live happily ever after with a perfect copy of him, somebody that looks like him, speaks like him, acts like him, essentially is him...
or you could be a widow at 30.
the idea of having a wife, a home, an actual life...
it must have been like a dream come true for him.
27 years, and the troubles come back, and it all goes to hell.
you know what I want to know, though, is what does this all have to do with me?
I know exactly who I can ask.
you knew him back then, Vince.
you wrote the article. Did you know what he was?
no, I swear. I had no idea.
do you think what we're saying really is possible?
that this real woman could live a life with a thing?
with a... A chameleon.
the chameleon isn't a thing.
it's a person.
he's afflicted, just like the people you've seen in Haven.
they're no more monsters than a hungry bear.
they don't deserve to be feared.
unless they're killing people.
true enough.
but Lucy always helped those in need.
she must have helped the carpenters back in the day.
that must have been why he thought you could help him now.
wait, you knew my mother? - Oh, yes.
why didn't you say anything?
you stay the hell away from me!
what is wrong with you, you freak?
I went down to the boathouse, and guess what I found.
a boat.
a perfectly good boat, until you shot it!
I didn't shoot the boat.
Where's your gun, Nathan? 'Cause I looked in your duffel bag.
it's not there.
put the axe down.
you're the chameleon.
Where's your gun, Nathan?
I left it in my bag. I didn't do it!
inside voices, please!
all right, listen.
we need to figure out who the chameleon is...
listen, I just... - No! Who the chameleon is, and what we're gonna do with him.
Or...Her.
all right? - Yeah.
I have an idea.
we can't really know what the chameleon knew about the person that it took.
but we have to start somewhere.
so each of you brought a present to the knot.
I'm assuming you didn't take the time to tell Mr. carpenter what that was.
so if you can say what's in your box, then we'll chalk one in your favor.
and if not...
we have a problem.
I'm going last.
why does he get to go last?
because he... Has the axe.
what about, uh, cue ball over here? - Well, I-I brought her the dress.
and the killer shoes.
and the purse.
well, exactly.
we're gonna start with Dr. Carr.
earrings.
emperor penguins.
all right. Those are beautiful.
thank you.
okay.
it's a book.
it's a first edition, signed by the author, just before that lady chopped off his foot.
okay.
can I see that? - Sure.
okay.
it's a sweater.
blue.
cashmere.
it's a scarf.
Oh...My God.
it is him. I knew it!
easy!
somebody save... Somebody do something!
okay, everybody just calm down for...
tie him up.
you have a gun.
you lied.
maybe I did.
Chief...Hand it over.
we all play by the same rules.
says who?
says the whole room that's about to go lord of the flies on your ass.
well...
even the playing field.
happy?
that was manly.
what are we gonna do with him?
I am not the damn chameleon.
okay, now, why did you not know what was in the box, then, Nathan?
I told Jess to pick up the sweater we saw in mcguinness' last week.
she must have seen the scarf and changed her mind.
she didn't tell me before she left.
what about the boat?
and the gun?
I'm not armed. You searched me.
the chief is the one who shot the boat!
he... - All right.
before y'all yell at me, okay.
that proves I'm not the chameleon.
the chameleon would want to go to the mainland.
any chance I could get untied before everyone goes crazy again?
how do we know you're not the chameleon?
and how do we know that you're not?
now, we're just as likely to kill an innocent person as we are a chameleon.
so I don't know any of you very well, but I would like to.
and I would like to think that we're better than that.
I probably should have given you a chance to...
Yeah, you should have. - Say something before I hit you.
well, what now? Do we keep...
stay down.
Hey, don't you go for that axe head!
I wasn't even thinking about it.
but, unfortunately, the gun is gone.
and for once, it wasn't me.
I swear.
what the hell just happened?
exactly what a predator would want.
every man for himself.
Gah! Garland... Ellen.
what are you doing?
I'm tired of this. I'm gonna kill this thing.
I'm gonna force it out so I can face it.
don't be an idiot. Come on and hide.
look, I tied my son to a chair.
I accused him of being a murderer.
I'm tired of letting this thing play with my head.
if we crucified ourselves every time we screwed up as parents, well, there's be no more parents in the world.
I could have actually killed him.
garland, I dropped Julia on her head when she was six months old.
twice.
well, thanks.
well, it isn't the breakers.
this place has got to have a backup generator.
we need to split up and find it.
hang on.
you said that we should stick together.
there are four people who are sitting ducks in the dark.
we need to get to them before the chameleon does, and that'll be a lot easier with the lights on.
man up.
that would be a lot easier to do if I still had my axe!
mom?
I'm sorry.
she's gone.
okay.
all right, uh...
looks like a broken neck.
I thought you said the chameleon killed by taking over its victims.
well, yeah, but maybe it didn't have enough time, panicked, and took off.
all right, the backup generator is...
Oh, no.
I can't remember what the last thing I said to her was.
all of you should come here and see this!
jeez.
that is a big crack.
Yeah, well, the weather can play havoc with these old houses.
that's probably what happened to the electricity too.
an earthquake in Maine?
I'll be damned.
well, yeah.
can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, listen, this is gonna get worse before it gets better, so we need to find some way to call for help.
do you trust me?
Yeah, of course I do.
are you okay?
no, I'm not. - What are...
what the hell are you doing?
No...Oh, please!
you killed my friend.
how... How did you know it was me?
I can feel her touch.
I can't feel yours.
what did you do?
she's the chameleon.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
the doctor...
doctor, she saw who I was.
and...
I was weakening.
and I thought she could help me.
like Lucy.
if you thought she could help, then...Why did you kill her?
she's different.
she... she... Should have died.
she's alive?
where is she? Where is she?
Audrey, can you hear us?
it's in here.
find the light!
she's alive. Get her out.
get out of there.
Julia, some help.
Parker, come on.
okay.

come on. Come on.
I don't think she needs to be disinfected.
the ammonia will act as a smelling salt.
Audrey, can you hear me?
the pulse is getting stronger.
she's gonna be okay.
Parker, you're gonna be okay.
you're gonna be okay.
are you crying?
cause crying will not be tolerated.
I don't think that he was a monster at all.
he came to me and he asked me for help, and I told him I didn't know how to help him.
you know, he looked... He looked really sad.
that's the last thing that I remember before...
you know, he became me.
just how "me" was he?
pretty you. I mean, pretty much...
pretty much exactly you.
yeah? And when did you realize he wasn't me?
I just...I knew.
Yeah, you think you know me that well? - No.
not that well.
what's your middle name?
my middle name? Really?
it's Prudence.
self-inflicted at my confirmation.
and yours? - Thaddeus.
inflicted by the chief.
he is a bad man.
how's Julia?
not good.
I think she's still in shock.
Yeah, I think we all are.
can't believe that Dr. Carr is gone.
I'll see you at work.
you did really good in there.
what? - I'm proud of you.
when it all hit the fan, you didn't flinch.
you had to shoot your own partner.
you know, part of me thinks you kind of grew up a little bit today.
you don't know me at all, do you?
just trying to give you a compliment, son.
take a compliment when...
think I can grow up... Be like you?
I'm not like you.
okay? I don't want to be like you.
I got a whole pack.
if you need anything, anything at all, please don't hesitate to call.
we'll see you real soon, huh? - Thank you.
happy Birthday.
you're kidding me.
Ah, just 'cause you got body snatched doesn't mean you don't get a present on your birthday.

thank you. - Look closer.

chennai University
I wasn't sure you'd speak to me at the funeral.
I didn't wantto take that chance, so I left.
I won't lie to you.
I was surprisedto see you there.
or anywhere, for that matter.
I said some terrible thingsto you.
about your father, about his theories.
but now that he's dead, I feel
what's done is done. - Is it?
your mother tells me you're not returningto new york.
new semester startsnext week. My life is here.
I've been promotedat the company.
head of all genetic research. Can you imagine?
good for you. - No, good for you.
it's the sortof cutting-edge science we used to talkabout late into the night.
the world's worst pillow talk, I'd say.
I was hopingi could convince you to come in for an interviewwith the partners.
only I'd have to knowthat your father's work, all of his theories, would stay rightwhere they are. Packed away in that box.
I don't expect an answerright now.
but you will thinkabout it, won't you?
Yes.
we didn't say hello.
Hello, mira. - Hello, mohinder.
I need you to handle this.
I'll give you one hour.
you're an idiot, parkman, do you know that?
wow, good morningto you, too.
you think I wouldn'tfind out about you assaultinga fellow officer?
I didn't assault him. I--I just hit him.
this is whyi don't like needing people.
nine times out of ten, they let you down.
wow, that's an optimistic viewof the world.
just an observation. - And how'd this get to beabout you?
because it wasa stupid rookie move, and you could've jeopardizedmy investigation.
how serious is this? Are you getting suspended?
I'll work it out.
did he deserve it?
Yeah. Yeah, he deserved it.
is he talking? - Nope.
and he's got one hourbefore homeland securitysends him down the rabbit holeas a suspected terrorist.
terrorist? We both knowhe's not a terrorist.
his wife was dying. He lost control.
of what?
this guy puts out1, 800 curies of radiation without ever coming in contactwith nuclear material.
we still don't knowhow that's possible.
you know, three months ago, my job made perfect senseto me.
and then I pulledthe sylar case.
crime sceneswith no fingerprints. Bodies frozen, brains removed.
and now this guy.
that's two people wh
make that three people who can do things i just can't explain.
What're you saying, you think I'm like them?
I don't knowwhat I think.
but if we're gonna find sylar, I need answers.
I have no ideahow this happened.
well, then, I guess that just leaves ted here.
what's this? - Detects radiation levels.
as long as that's dark green, we're good. Dosimetry - Oh--okay, what'sthe bad color? - Not green.
the dance floor...
lights are cool.

well, don't let meoff easy, now.
I don't like this song...
let's get a drink.

Yeah, lately, I sorta remember everything I read.
it's kind ofa skill, I guess.
my skillmuch more complicate.
Oh, yeah? What can you do?
I can teach japaneseto anyone.
you're sweet.
sweet means nice. Cute.
that's not in book.
no.
it is just true.
I like the wayyour cheeks wobble when you concentrate.
Yeah. Oh, oh, sorry.
someone's denver omelet's up.
I'll be right back.
I'm sweet!
they won't even let me goto my wife's funeral.
all I wantedwas to be left alone.
we need you to answer a few more questions.
you can't getyour partner here to look inside my head?
we need to have iton the record.
you burnt that doctorto the bone. Probably gave your wife cancer.
how'd you do it?
Ted, if you don'tlet us help you, they're gonna take you away, and nobody'll listen to you.
it doesn't matter.
nothing matters.
I killed my wife!
you know, just lock me up. Execute me.
leave me the hell alone! - I wish we could, ted.
look, I don't know anything about any nuclear material!
Ted, ted! You know what? Just relax.
do you want meto be the terrorist, huh?
do you want me to bethe bad guy? Fine, i'll blowthis place apart.
stop! - Ted!
just stop!
do it. - Ted.
do it! Do it!
Ted, I know what you're going through.
Yeah, sure, you do. Yeah, like hell you do.
come on, ted! You've seenwhat I can do. Okay?
something is happeningto me, too.
Ted, I was able to read your wife's dying thoughts.
we're just tryingto understand what it is. Ted.
come on, ted. Relax.
come on. Just take me back.
take me back to--to when this all started, okay?
just... Start from the beginning. Good.
blacked out. And when I woke up, everything started dying.
you blacked out.
how long were you out for? Were you drinking?
when you came to, did you have bruiseson your arms?
I'll do you one better.
what's the matter, parkman?
I'm going. - Don't walk away.
it doesn't matterwhat you think. I'm not asking your opinion.
Yes. How could I have forgotten-- you never have before.
why should nowbe any different? - It is my life!
I'm going, and that's final.
has it never occurred to you that your actionscould affect anyone else?
I don't have time for anyone else's feelings.
clearly!
the world needs to knowabout my findings. That's all that's important.
the world doesn't care. No one at the university cares.
you're becominga laughing stock. I can't cover for youany longer.
I'm not asking you to.
how will yousupport yourself? What will you do for money?
Oh, i'll get by. - How?
do you know what doctors doin the united states? They drive taxi cabs.
it is one thingto publish a book in the comfortof the university.
it is another to leave everything behind
your wife, your family, your job
chasing a theory that is pure fantasy.
it's a fool's errand.
we'll see who will be the fool, won't we?
Yes, I guess we will.
Mohinder is right.
I am abandoning my family, my job.
you are.
but I know you, chandra, better than you know yourself.
you will not stop thinking of this if you don't go.
it will consume youand, eventually, all of us with it.
he'll hate me for it.
I'm not sure thathe doesn't already.
I should try to stayfor his sake. - Why?
he will never take her place in your eyes. That has always beenthe case.
who are you?
what do you want?
I was in, uh, kans as a couple months back.
I'd just madea big sale to the university hospital.
dialysis machines.
commission was gonna givekaren and meenough money to...
I-I went to the, uh, the hotel bar.
buy everybodya few rounds.
there weren't many people there.
a couple from wyoming. Some professors.
the next thing I-I know, I'm waking upin my car.
it's two days later, and I'm in tempe, arizona.
these weird cuts and bruises all over me.
a couple of days later, I start to notice things.
I'd buy my wife flowers, and they'd wilt.
okay, what about your health?
I mean, were you sick? Do you have headaches?
Yeah. Headaches. But, uh...
the doctor said she had radiation poisoning.
from you? - I was killing her.
are there any other bodies out there we don't know about?
I'm just saying. - This is not his fault.
he's just tryingto figure this out.
look, the same thinghappened to me.
okay, I blacked out. I lost two days.
you should've told meabout this. - I should've donea lot of things.
up until now, I haven't told anyone. Not even my wife.
and now I can't stophearing people's thoughts. It's painful.
I'm hearing thingsthat I should not be hearing.
like what?
things that could ruin lives. Things that...
could end marriages.
the guy that you described, the student.
he was, uh, haitian. Big guy? Bald?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm telling you, I think I sawthis guy right before right beforei blacked out, too.
what are you guystalking about? A haitian guy?
these things that we can do, th--they're not normal.
we were cut. W-we were injected.
blacked out, who knowswhat they did to us?
or how they changed us.
time's up. - What?
just a couple more minutes.
and you, you shouldn't even be here. Your badgehas been suspended.
did he tell you wherethe nuclear material is?
move it. - He's coming with me.
what? No, you can't take himright now.
Yeah, they can.
find the haitian.
find him!
you gotta get himback in here. - I can't.
what do you mean you can't? You heard what he said.
he's gonna help me figure out what happened to me.
why did you lie to me about being suspended?
okay, so I leftthat part out.
but you have come to me and asked for my help.
and I come running to you every single time.
so now I'm askingfor your help.
all right, get him back in here, so I can talk to him!
I'm sorry. It's out of my hands.
primatech PAPER CO. ODESSA, TEXAS
that's good.
Mr. Bennet. - Rufus.
Ooh, I-I got next month'sparking sticker.
just need youto sign for it.
I'll take careof that later, rufus.
Ooh, sorry, sorry.
how's he doing? - Heroin's out of his system.
his body doesn't want itanymore, but his mind still does.
coherent? - Very.
you ready to meet him?
Yeah.
this is mr. Bennet, the man I told you about.
Hello, isaac.
drawing anything interesting?
it's nothing. - Oh, you knowthat's not true.
you have the ability to paint the future. That's something.
something very important.
feels like a curse.
no, it's a blessing. Don't let anybodytell you differently.
we're gonna help you understand that.
I'm gratefulyou're helping me. I'm just not sure whyyou're doing it.
to be 100% honestwith you...
I need your help.
how we doin'? - Good.
okay.
Oh, my god!
she's dead.
I know you miss him.
and I know you feelguilty, too.
don't. - I had a dream last night.
you and father were talkingbefore he left.
in it, you persuaded himto go.
it was justa dream, mohinder. - No, I need to knowif it was true.
your father and I were marriedfor 33 years.
that is not an answer. - Yes, it is.
a marriage doesn't lastthat longwithout allowingthe other personto be who he has to be.
but how could you allow him to abandon everything?
just like that.
I'm afraid that answer is not as easy.
in the dream, you said that i could never takethe place of her.
who did you mean?
I suppose it's timethat you knew, now that your father's gone.
you had a sister.
a sister?
her name was shanti.
and sh--she was five years oldwhen she died, two years after youwere born.
well, why didn't I know this?
because it was too painfulto talk about, especially for your father.
he loved her so much, he was afraid that youwould compare his love.
from the momentshe was born, he was convinced that she was special.
and she was special.
these dates. Suicide bomber, 15 people dead.
train derailment, 9 dead. Earthquake, 81.
this girl, the one you've painted here, and here, and there...
she's my daughter. My claire.
this man here... Goes by the name of sylar.
he's gonna kill hertomorrow night at her homecoming game.
Why?
because she's special. Like you.
and that makes hera target. - Like me.
you're not the only onewith special abilities, isaac. There are others.
Sylar is killing them.
one at a time.
if you know who he is, then why can't you stop him?
because nobody knowswhere he is. I need your help.
I need you to paintthis painting.
I'm sorry. I've been trying. I can't.
not without the drugs.
fine.
I promise we will help youuse your abilities without this, but right now, there just isn't time.
I'm fighting to getmy life back, and you want meto just throw it away.
you know...
for many years now, a number of ushave been tracking, locating, monitoringpeople like you.
sometimes the processgoes smoothly, as in your case, and other times
well, let's just say some people misinterpret our motives, and then it can go...
very wrong.
14 years ago, there was just such a case, which, sadly, endedin a death.
the woman left behinda baby girl who had no oneto take care of her.
my wife and I had been havinga hard time...
conceiving a childof our own at the time.
and--and it was like...
God had reached downand given us a miracle.
this is my daughterwe're talking about.
I'm begging you.
let me try one more time. Without it.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
Hey, wait! Stop!
I have a pickupat 59th and broadwayto jfk.
No!
father!
father!
Fath--father!
stop!
stop. Stop, stop, stop.
dad. - Claire?
honey, is everythingall right?
Yeah, everything's fine. Can't a girl just visither dad at work?
you never visit meat work.
okay. I'm busted.
a paper emergency. - A paper emergency.
a paper emergency. Ms. Roberts says we needa banner over the trophy case, and jackie was all, "we don't have paperthat big. They don't make paperthat big.
so I thought I'd stop by and try to be a hero.
well, if it'll makeyou a hero and maybe knock jackiedown a few notches, we might be able to find something that'll work.
best dad ever.
I'm sorry, mr. Bennet. We just havea little situation.
you know what? The sample room is rightdown there, claire-bear.
you take anything you need.
okay? - Thanks, dad.
first door on your left.
I'm sorry. I didn't know she'd be here.
so what's the problem?
it's not working. He can't do it.
he tried. He's just not there yet.
we tried his way. Now we do it mine.
he has worked so hardto get clean. You can't ask himto do this.
I'm not going to ask him.
you are.
No! No, you can't make me do that.
you knew thiswas a possibility.
you said when we started that I would never haveto do it again.
you promised me. - I know what you think.
who do you think taught you?
do you even remember what you werewhen I found you?
you're the easy way.
I think we both knowthe hard way.
she say anything? Sounded like she was scared?
no. She seemed very nice.
she was. Too nice...
to die like that. Head ripped open.
I ain't never seenanything like it.
we're very sorry.
y'all stick around.
need to takeyour statements.
the painter, Isaac, when I saw him in the future.
that can't be a coincidence.
then we should be extra careful.
there has to be something I can do.
she's already dead.
I can bend time.
I can go back.
no
why else did I get these powers...
if I'm not supposed to help?
we're already on one stupid mission...
you don't need another.
I don't do anything when those poker men died.
I can't just sit back and do nothing again
sure you can!
it's easy.
I'll just go back...
to yesterday.
I'll stop her from coming to work.
if she's not here...
she can't be killed.
but you can be!
you don't have control over your power yet.
the last time you tele-ported...
you ended up in the future.
in another country!
if I'm too scared to use my powers...
then I don't deserve them.
I have to try.
what about the cheerleader?
I won't be late.
just count to five...
and I'll be back.
we'll celebrate...
my victory.
Hiro?
please...
Hiro?
Ensenada?
Pam auden called...
to ask me why you punched tom mchenry.
I told her you didn't.
did you? - Yeah.
Yeah, I punched him.
he knows. Damn it, I knew it.
you punched a superior officer? That has to have some kindof repercussions.
he may outrank me, but "superior's" taking ita little too far.
I got one month's suspension. No pay.
Jesus, matt.
something happened... Between me and tom.
you slept with him. - Yes.
is it over? - Yes.
are we?
I don't know.
Yeah, it's matt. - He's gone.
what? - Ted. He escaped.
watch out!

Yeah, I heard you.
scientists say learning continues in sleep

I was here.
I was.
somehow I was here.

I mean, anything? Anything at all?
cause I got to believe you have nothing left.
whatever it is, you'll handle it.
I'm sorry. Do I know you?
whatever you're dealing with,
you'll figure it out.
I've been in some rough places,
had a few conversations with myself.
eventually I got where I needed to be.
and where was that?
where I'm standing.
it's always where I'm standing.
does this place mean something to you?
you know, sometimes, uh...
you leave a mark where you've been.
sometimes the tide just washes it away.
but you don't know until you come back, do you?
so you from around here?
yeah...
once upon a time.
good luck.
how can I help
Hello, Dave.
it's been a while. You miss me?
I missed you.

I haven't eaten a meal off a plate, taken a hot shower, or run a mile since '85.
and you? - Oh, you know,
still running the paper
posting ads for, uh, old dogs, and, uh,
lost furniture.

after your testimony.
you go ahead and eat your dinner, and drink your drink,
and then I want you out of here.
I want you gone from Haven.
I want you gone from the entire state of Maine. Do you understand me?
can't do that. I have a few things I need to take care of right here.
either you're gone by tonight,
or I'll have your parole violated,
and you'll be back in Shawshank tomorrow.
it's your choice.

it was a crack, like the cracks that have been plaguing Haven since the day I arrived.
okay, so we have a crack here in the road,
crack on duke's boat, Crack at the hotel on carpenter's knot.
what do you think, Audrey?
Hello?
anybody home?
I'm sorry. What?
what's going on with you?
no, nothing, I'm fine.
no, you're not. What's going on?
I haven't been sleeping.
Oh. That's too bad.
you should go home.
excuse me? - You don't want to talk about it. I get that-- Go.
I can handle stuff here for a while.
no, that-- That doesn't work for me, okay?
work works for me, so I'm gonna
you're no good to me like this.
go. Sleep.
think.
put on some tunes.
fine.
I don't know who you are, friend,
but you need to get the hell out of my chair.
this your boat?
damn sure not yours.
then you're the man I came to see
well, now, you must've missed the part where I told you
to get your ass out of my mother-lovin' chair.
John draft up in shawshank said you might be the man to get me a job.
well, I'm very sorry, but I can't help you.
he also said you owed him some money.
and that if I wanted to collect it,
that was fine with him.
well, you tell john
if he wants his money, he's gonna have to come get it himself.
I know you?
Yeah, I know you.
you got sent up for killing that family 20 years ago.
25 .
you don't want to give me my money,
then I'm gonna have to take it from you.
huh.
well, you do what you need to do.
Oh, that doesn't seem fair to me.
well, I'm not interested in fair.
I'm interested in getting your ass off of my boat.
you didn't come here to fight.
that's a gamble.
you just got paroled.
you're gonna risk getting sent back inside for John draft's money?
he said you were smart.
you're ballsy too.
thank you.
now, why don't you tell me why you really came here.
I'll find you at the Gull.
great shrimp, by the way.
chief, I need a signature-- - Don't you knock anymore?
the door was open.
he didn't make parole, did he?
you don't have to concern yourself with that.
just get down there and check out those cracks opening up, will you?
easy now.
I'm not one of the thousand people you've pissed off in your life.
well, actually, I am, but I'm not one of the dangerous ones.
great. Where's Audrey? - She doesn't want to talk to anybody.
except you. - Not yet. She'll talk when she's ready to talk.
cupcakes will help. - Cupcakes.
what do you want to talk to her about?
just tell her a man with a tattoo came to see me.
in your world, what are the odds?
tell her I said, "it's the tattoo"
the one that's supposed to be on the man who kills me.
it's on a man named Max Hansen,
the man who killed that family 20 years ago. Remember?
did your mother ever mention anything about this?
does she know anything about this? Do you?
I don't know what you're talking about,
and I don't like who you've become, duke.
I thought I made that clear.
now go away.
I'll tell Audrey you were here.
super helpful.
Hey.
did you get the cupcakes?
a dozen...
half with sprinkles.
they're rosemary's.
Duke was here.
what did he want?
little warm-up for the road there, hon?
I know you, Max Hansen.
Oh, of course.
it's nice to see you again.
heard you visited a friend of mine.
I've visited a number of old friends recently.
Duke Crocker, he owns the place.
Yeah, yeah. I heard he was impressive.
was he? - That remains to be seen.
I came here hoping to run into him, actually.
he said that you had a tattoo.
Mm-hmm, several.
this one was on the inside of your forearm in the shape of a maze.
would you like something? I feel a little impolite eating in front of you like this.
you either tell me or don't, but don't play games.
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. Let me get a towel.
Ah, clumsy me.
good thing they serve cold coffee here.
well, you'll have to excuse me.
I got to get to church.
you killed the Colorado kid.
garland Wuornos thought so.
he never proved it, though, did he?
what the hell does this tattoo mean?
why is this guy trying to kill me?
do you remember anything from the Colorado kid?
I mean, anything about that day that could help me?
I wish I did, but I don't.
I'm sorry, but...
Duke, that guy who was sitting there,
I spilled coffee all over him.
great. I'm gonna get killed over spilled coffee.
the pot was scalding hot.
if he sues us, am I fired?
don't you have customers?
what?
what is it? - The pot-- It was scalding hot, and he
he didn't feel it. - I'm sure that it's me. I'm sure I'm the one not getting it.
he didn't feel.
can I help you?
who are you? - Direct, no flinching
I knew I'd like you.
I'm flattered. Who are you?
I'm an old friend of the chief's.
you're Max Hansen.
you're smart too.
now, I just came by to say hello.
that's-- That's all.
I- I don't want no trouble at all, Nathan. You tell your father that.
I just want a- a little house with a little yard and
you don't take your hand off my shoulder,
you're gonna get a ride back to shawshank...
or a bullet.
damn.
you can't feel that at all, can you?
you really don't want to stay in Haven.
Oh, but I do.
Oh, I- I- I have friends here, Nathan.
one thing I learned in prison
if a man has the right kind of friends,
life gets a whole lot easier.
you remember that.
so tell me, Leo, - You know him? - Spent ten years in the same cellblock.
Why? - Do you know anything about where he got his tattoos?
no.
but I didn't see him get any while I was in with him.
okay, what else?
what was he like? What did he do?
Max did the fights
best in his class while I was there.
nothing could throw at him. Anybody would slow him down.
it was like he couldn't feel the hits, you know?
Hey, do you know why he may have come back to Haven?
he always wanted to track down some long-lost family when he got out.
why are you here?
you know why I'm here.
your brother owes me.
well, so do I.
easy, Vince.
you didn't come back to Haven to collect from Dave.
why are you here?
I'm here to claim the life that was taken from me,
the family that was stolen from me,
and to watch the man that took it all from me die.
Garland's not alone, you know.
neither am I.
I have friends in Haven.
I'm sure they won't mind if you die first.
leave now, Max...
before I do something I really enjoy.
you know, it's good to see that somebody in this town remembers who he is.
tell your brother I'll be back for what's mine.
Oh, and, Vince...
next time I see you,
I'm gonna kill you.
are you sure?
couldn't get it done the last time.
are you sure you want to tell Nathan alone?
no, but he's my partner.
did you already tell him about the other thing?
what?
the thing that's got you holed up living on frosting.
I didn't think so.
Hey.
come on.
what is it? You're a mess.
I can't.
cause you have to tell Nathan first.
Yeah.
Yeah, pretty much.
do I have to like that?
today,
Yeah.
Nathan, we need to talk.
I found out something about Max Hansen.
what's up? - He can't feel anything.
how do you know that?
well, it-- It doesn't matter, all right? What matters is-- - How do you know?
it doesn't matter.
you have the same affliction, - Which probably means that you're-- - Related.
did you forget to tell me something about Max Hansen?
what? - You put him away. You know everything about him,
and you tell me, "don't concern yourself"?
can we get a minute alone here?
you can say it in front of her.
what, you found out...
that he can't feel anything?
so you know that
that you're...
related.
I wanted to tell you.
that I have relatives in Haven that I didn't even know about?
I'm not
I'm not your father.
Max Hansen's your father.
are you gonna say something?
can't say I'm surprised.
you mean you knew? - This? No.
but you-- There are so many things you don't tell me,
secrets you don't trust me with. Why
why should one more surprise me?
I wanted to tell him for so long.
I just thought, well, I'll wait a little while,
and hopefully things will get better between us.
it'll be easier to tell him,
and I won't lose him.
but, no, things never actually did get better between us, and
I've lost him anyways.
Max Hansen let you adopt his son?
well, he was-- He was already inside, anyway.
the way he treated Johnathan's mother,
the way he treated that little boy,
I should've killed him then.
he does not deserve a place
in Nathan's life.
I guess Hansen thought otherwise.
maybe that's why he came back.
I don't know what's in that man's head. Look, do you mind?
well, I confirmed he's dead, in case you were wondering.
ought to make duke happy.
let's find him.
Max threatened him, right?
whoa, no, no, no, no, no. Max-- Max threatened you too.
Oh, so you think I killed him? - No, I'm not-- I'm not saying that, Nathan,
okay? I'm just saying that duke went out of his way to help me look into max.
to protect himself. - No, to protect you.
he wanted me to be the one to tell you about your father,
okay?
I don't think that he would do something like this.
there were cracks on Duke's boat.
there were cracks at the hotel on carpenter's knot, and Duke was there.
I mean, maybe-- Maybe he's playing nice,
but he's still a suspect.
Hey, hey.
sorry about that.
I hear you're afraid of max Hansen.
Ah, screw it.
normally I'd try to act all manly, but,
Yeah, I'm terrified.
why do you ask?
make it a lot easier on you if he was dead,
wouldn't it?
are you offering?
where were you earlier, Duke?
Oh, did somebody take care of my little problem?
just answer the question.
they did?
they-- Thank you!
thank you!
that is outstanding. All right, hmm?
Oh, no, don't worry about it. I'm not offended that you asked. It's fine.
so...
how did he die?
he was swallowed by a crack in the ground.
he was swallowed by a crack in the ground, yes.
Yes.
Nathan, come on. I mean, if I could do that,
why am I out here playing Jed Clampett with a shotgun in my lap?
where were you?
I was right here.
and with all due respect, Nathan,
you know I'm not a troubled person.
Max Hansen didn't know you.
so why did he come to see you?
I have no idea.
I don't believe you.
I don't think that you killed him.
good.
care to celebrate my continued existence?
I'm buying.
you know, just because this guy's dead doesn't mean that
another guy with a tattoo isn't gonna kill you.
you really are a buzzkill.
why would you say that? I liked you so much better
when you were locked up in your cupcake room.
I'm just saying that if I were you, I would be looking into the tattoo
and not just worrying about one guy,
especially a dead one.
uh, chief, y- You know you can't smoke in here.
it's okay, Vince.
you all right? - He found out today.
I knew this day was coming.
and there was really nothing I could do about it...
well, nothing right anyway.
who found out what?
Nathan. He knows about Max.
had to happen.
I know you two had your troubles, but the fact is you took him in.
you raised him as best you could,
even after his mom died.
not really sure any of that matters now.
Oh, it does.
it does. - Does it?
I talked to Max today too.
made a point of saying he had friends here.
that troubles me.
he got friends, does he?
well, I'd like to see who shows up for that funeral.
you know what it's gonna be. It's gonna be Nathan sitting there all alone.
Nathan won't abandon you, Garland.
just give him time.
I gave him nothing but.
never? You've never seen it before?
great. Well, I'm glad I didn't spend four years at your crap university.
Hi.
come to dislike me up close?
you play the bad-boy smuggler, but I think maybe you got a heart in there.
and someone is very interested in removing it,
which has me a little busy.
Duke, there's something you should see.
the guy on the right's my grandfather.
so?
look closely.
how long have you known about this?
come on.
he was here at least once.
no, Dave, not now.
how are you, Nathan?
fine. Also working.
listen, I, uh
I spoke to your father.
which one?
so you do know.
of course, of course the chief talks to you.
you both are suffering right now.
it's understandable.
look, give it time.
excuse me.
you recognize this guy?
you can't just walk away.
you're gonna have to deal with this.
Dave, Dave, listen, now's not the time. - Look, you're not the only one hurt here.
Dave, let's finish lunch. Come on. - I've known your father a long time. - Leave me the hell alone
so I can do my damn job.
go. Come on.
sorry.
have you seen him?
twice...
once with you. The other time he was alone.
and what time was this?
not sure, maybe 2: 00 or 3: 00.
that's when the lighthouse fell.
was he with anyone?
sat at the table next to the chief.
thank you.
Yeah.
of course.
the chief runs into Max. He gets upset,
and the lighthouse goes down.
he got upset when you were on the boat, and it cracked.
he was upset at the hotel when that cracked, at the carpenter's knot.
I found a chasm in the ground near where he goes hunting.
and he was afraid when he ran into Hansen that he would
that he would tell you that
he was your father.
and when you found out, Hansen was swallowed up by a crack,
and then he died.
it's the chief.
check his calendar.
Hey, Nathan, we need to talk about what's gonna happen when we find him.
no, we need to find him first. - Yeah, we need to find him, yes, but he is your father.
that's debatable.
no, listen, I know you're angry. I know that you hate him,
and maybe you don't even share the same DNA, but, Nathan, listen to me,
he is your father.
he is a troubled person, and I don't think that he killed anyone.
you can't be sure about that. He's been lying to me since I was a kid.
you're right, but you didn't leave Haven.
you could have.
you could have been a cop anywhere else,
but you-- You chose to stay.
so what? - So you could work it out with your father.
but you guys are both so stubborn,
you haven't sorted it out yet, but when we find your father
the chief, you mean? - No, your father. When we find him,
we're gonna ask him what the hell has been going on, all right?
do you understand me?
you know what? Actually, I don't
I don't even care.
you guys are just so-- You're so messed up.
where-- Where would he go?
all right, you know him better than anyone else.
where is he?
this isn't right.
do you want to just tell me where we're going?
we're almost there. Be patient.
patient?
why would I be patient?
somebody out there with a tattoo that's in your family wants to kill me.
so, no. No, thank you.
I will absolutely not be patient.
tell me where we're going.
here.
is this your grandfather?
no, he's over there.
I don't know who this is...
or who that is...
or that...
or that.
or that.
chief.
I knew you guys would find me eventually.
and why was that?
cause you're good cops.
it's just a matter of time before you put it all together and figured out my little problem.
the cracks?
not been easy holding it all together.
I've tried everything. I tried drinking.
I tried smoking.
hell, I even...
tried going to church.
but they just got worse.
did you kill max?
Yeah, I guess I did.
it was accidental, not that that matters a whole lot now.
I don't want to say I regret it, 'cause I don't.
hated that man. He was pure evil.
but i figured it out now.
there's only one way that we're gonna make this stop.
chief.
I'm sorry about this, Nathan. There's just no simple answers here.
I mean, obviously you just can't stick me in some lighthouse, 'Cause before long, I'm just gonna destroy everything
this town, I'm gonna destroy you,
and that's everything I got and everything I ever had.
what are you trying to hold together?
well, Haven, of course...
this town.
this town is standing on the edge.
and I'm just not sure I can really stop it anymore.
come on in, chief.
we'll figure this out.
please, just put the gun down.
it's your town now.
I'm sorry I've been so hard on you,
I had to make you strong.
well, you are stronger now,
stronger than I am.
I'm done.
I can't be fixed.
Yes. Yes, you can.
you're still not seeing what's right in front of you.
Audrey sees what's in front of her.
she's not telling me it's all gonna be fine, are you?
tell him, Audrey.
go ahead, tell him.
tell him!
I've just been holding it together
for such a long, long time.
I was waiting for you, Audrey.
be careful.
not everyone's thrilled you're back.
please let us help.
I love you, son.
dad.
thank you, guys, for coming.
I didn't know how else to make this - Private. - Of course.
we still can't believe it.
poor Garland.
thanks for calling us.
we knew Garland was suffering, but
not like
he's lost two fathers in one day.
more than someone should have to bear.
let's go talk with him. - No, he doesn't want to talk to us.
he needs her.
you're right.
how can we help?
you can gather the evidence so that we can hide it.
evidence? - She means Garland.
Oh, god.
Yeah, if you could, um,
pick up the pieces so
we can just put them in this box, - Help us hide it. - Of course.
we've known Garland for over 60 years.
it's the last thing we can do for him.
w- We'll start. You go see to Nathan.
Thanks.
Hey, um,
before the chief died, he said something about
there being people that may not want me here.
do you have any idea what he was talking about?
no.
sorry, I...
I guess we'll never know.
Yeah, okay.
you should tell her what she needs to know
before she finds out on her own.
no.
we should stay out of this as long as we can.
let it sort itself out. - You're a fool.
Yeah, well, I might be a fool,
but we're still alive, aren't we?
I can't imagine what you're going through right now.
I'm so sorry, Nathan.
you know what I don't understand?
why'd you let him die?
what are you talking about?
he needed to hear
that you could help him,
the same words that you have given to every other troubled person
that we have dealt with!
but you couldn't give him that?
he knew that there was no good answer.
he knew more about the troubles than anyone.
you need to leave me alone.
please.
that thing that I've been trying to tell you...
your father knew. - Enough.
just go.
Duke, I'm not drinking with you.
come on, one drink.
I insist.
you really helped me today.
I just want to say thank you.
you're welcome.
but that's as far as I go.
you'll have to figure out the rest on your own.
somebody out there with this tattoo is gonna kill me unless I kill them first.
this is my mother's world,
not mine.
I'm not even sure I'm gonna be here that long.
and besides...
I still don't like you very much.
hmm.
Hello, Nathan.
what the hell are you doing in his chair?
I'm sorry for your loss.
don't know what you mean.
Oh, yes, you do.
your father was a good man, Nathan.
you need to replace him with an even better one.
won't be you. - No,
but with good friends,
the right kind of friends,
new chief of police could do wonders for this town.
friends?
you mean thugs like Max Hansen?
don't call your daddy names, Nathan.
I called my father "the chief."
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you fill his seat.
you already are...
damned.
things are gonna change in Haven, Nathan.
I'm going to change them.
so either you leave
and find someplace else to live your life,
or you will suffer...
like the rest of your kind.
I knew I'd find you here.
I'm surprised you wanted to find me anywhere.
I just-- - No, it's
it's okay, Nathan. - I just found the Rev
in my father's office measuring for drapes.
he wants to be chief?
he wants to control whoever is.
the last thing Haven needs
is the Rev and his self-righteous poison running things.
I don't know what is happening.
my dad was holding it all together.
that's your job now.
I'm sorry I shut you out.
Nathan, I'm sorry too. I
you're the one person that I can absolutely trust.
and if you're gonna wear this,
then we need to be honest with each other.
what's wrong?
you felt that.
Yeah.
I can feel you.
how long have you known?
a while.
I...
I wasn't sure what to think about it for a long time.
Hey.
that thing-- That thing that I-- That I
was trying to tell you...
I think it might have
this might have something to do with all that.
I might be part of it.
part of what?
I found out something about Lucy,
and it's really
it's really hard to believe.
she's not your mother? - It's way weirder than that.
I am Lucy.
that's-- - Don't.
don't say that that's impossible,
because whatever this is, it's possible.
excuse me.
Audrey Parker?
I'm sorry. Can I help you?
are you Audrey Parker?
and who are you? - I'm with the FBI.
answer the question.
Oh, right, you're here about Max Hansen.
he's dead.
haven P. D. Who are you?
I said I'm FBI. - Hey, hey, keep your hands where I can see them.
what am I gonna do, pull out another gun?
my name is special agent Audrey Parker.
who the hell are you?
get back.
bullets, they, uh, tend to find me.
EVI tipped off the rev about your file on the troubled people.
why are you working with the Rev?
they said that you were important.
who's "they"? The Rev?
he's one of them. Son of a bitch, it's them.
you're gonna tell him what he wants to know, or I will!
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Crocker.
I don't understand any of this.
I can provide the answers.
but you're gonna have to prove to me that you're worthy.
the Rev.
he's in the middle of all this.
WDLH news time is 7: 59.
the mild weather has finally made it to the central coast.
we'll tell you how long it's gonna stick around.
plus everything you need to know about the return of lobstrosity, but first, these WDLH headlines.
a family on a camping trip discovered what State Police have confirmed as the remains of 20-year-old Malia McClintock, the dental hygienist from Garvey reported missing last week.
the family of four, who asked not to be identified, found Mrs. McClintock's dismembered body buried under a bed of leaves near the Scotts Lake camping area.
Yeah, baby.
miss McClintock disappeared two weeks ago after leaving a friend's backyard fish fry.
a statewide search and investigation had produced few clues until yesterday's grisly discovery.
deep drag. State Police believe the murder of Miss McClintock to be related to a half dozen other killings up and down the Central Coast that have
no, no, no, break time's not over.
while the police have not yet named a suspect in the case, they are interested in questioning a sandy-haired...
sorry, sorry. I gotta go.
and approximately 160 pounds with a rose tattoo on his forearm.
witnesses have placed a man fitting that description near the scenes of four of the six murders.
damn, that's him. - More as it comes in.
now back to playing coastal Maine's rockin' hits.
who's there?
third cup of coffee. - Yeah, I know.
you sleeping at all? - Mm, a couple hours a night.
I'm good though. I'm getting a lot of stuff done.
you? - I didn't just go through a breakup.
you did just get demoted, there was anarchy at the police station, and the new police chief died right in front of you.
Yeah.
but I didn't go through a breakup.
this is definitely the guy that I saw coming out of that store.
he did not seem like he had that kind of strength.
did you see anything else? This guy's a serial killer.
Nope.
and tell me how that's possible.
there's no sign of him back here.
I go back to the shed, the whole world turns upside down.
did you recognize the boy? - No.
look, I've seen a lot of things.
this was not normal, believe me.
I've seen black bears do worse.
you're a lucky man.
don't think this was a bear. - Pretty much guarantee it was.
it's feeding season, and they're cranky.
trust me.
Dwight's cleaning the guy.
I guess when you look like a viking, people just believe what you tell them.
the boy's name is Rory Campbell.
waitress' kid goes to school with him.
there's blood over by the shed, and there's blood here. It's probably his.
we need to call his parents.
she already did. Dad's on the way down.
well, looks like there's a trail.
guy chases Rory into the storage shed, gets interrupted by our truck driver, spikes him like a football, then drags Rory into the woods to finish what he started?
forever.
we're gonna have to search these woods.
probably want to get a couple more people down here.
Why?
after last week, who can we really trust?
a case like this, it's procedure.
Yeah, well, being locked in our own police station and getting shot at, that was procedure.
no.
we got to things our way.
from now on, Nathan, it's just you and me.
this is Rory's.
is there any significance to the stamp on the inside?
forever? No, not to me.
look, a serial killer has got my son.
now where are the staties with the hounds? Did they stop for coffee?
it's actually better for everyone involved if we keep this investigation local.
the man that was last seen with Rory, there's a chance that he could be...
troubled?
you know about the troubles, Mr. Campbell?
I've lived in haven my whole life.
I've got my thirty-aught-six in the trunk.
Mr. Campbell, this is a police matter.
I was in the Marines.
you can't run a shadow operation with two people.
my son is alive in those woods. I feel it in my gut.
now there's no way I'm sitting on my hands while some twisted freak chases him down.
I'm coming too.
no, you're not. - I can manage the situation.
you are a bullet magnet, Dwight.
your vest barely saved you last week. I'm not gonna risk it.
a kid is missing.
barely is enough.
just you and me just became you, me, and them.
actually, it might help having a couple more people, assuming they don't die.
I'm gonna make a call.
and I was thinking you could meet us over here.
we could definitely use you.
you know, I wish that I could help, but I actually have plans.
listen, I know you're trying to deal with what happened to Evi, but I just thought, you know, chasing a serial killer might take your mind off things.
while I appreciate the generous offer,
I don't think that's gonna work.
good luck.
we don't need Duke.
Vince and Dave know these woods better than anybody.
come on, let's go.
Hey, guys, everything all right?
well, actually... - We're fine. Ready to go.
Oh, come on. I'll do this myself.
Hey, no one's going anywhere alone.
we'll split into pairs.
you two. Dave, you're with me.
this guy is on the run, extremely dangerous.
we watch each ether's backs.
be careful.
heard you had a close call at the police station last week.
matter of opinion.
you've been to visit Lizzie recently?
no, Vince, I haven't.
maybe you're just planning on joining her.
is that why you're out here? - Helping a man find his kid.
no, you're not.
you're tempting fate.
Why?
yesterday, Lizzie would have been nine.
creepy and invisible.
not my favorite combination.
have you ever tracked someone in the woods?
excuse me?
Hey, I'm putting my son's life in your hands.
I'd like to know what you bring to the table.
you need to step back. - You need to answer my question.
you're standing on the evidence.
come on, there's more.
poor guy.
he probably thought he was gonna have a good day.
let's get going. Maybe now you can find us something we're actually looking for.
I think I just did.
so that's our serial killer.
you think Rory killed him? - I'm saying it's possible.
he was the last person seen with him.
this guy was supposed to be a monster. Rory's not capable of that.
he was damn near valedictorian of his class.
aren't there bears in these woods?
worse than that.
how about a wendigo?
let it be. - A what?
Wendigo.
according to the Mi'kmaq tribe, it's a human spirit that's stronger, faster, tracks prey like a lion, survives on human flesh.
it eats people. - Yeah.
long before these woods were a state park, they were the wendigo's hunting grounds.
good Lord, this is amateur hour.
teeth marks on the body, they're human.
are you sure?
nothing else looks quite like people being eaten by people.
you still want me to let it be, Vince?
okay, Mr. Campbell, are you sure there's not history of the troubles in your family?
what? Now, my son is some sort of cannibal?
no, there's no history. Not in my family. Not in my wife's.
look, someone else did this.
they're still out there chasing down my son, and you are wasting time.
found some sneaker prints by the body, but the spacing was weird.
long strides?
had to be about eight feet between each print.
Yeah.
Wendigos run twice as fast as ordinary people.
you ever seen one of these things?
no.
but you believe in them?
I believe in the troubles, Nate.
lower your weapon, Nathan.
easy, son.
I don't know what the hell you're doing here, reverend, but you and your men better stand down.
you first.
actually, we're gonna do this all at the same time.
one.
two.
three.
play nice, boys.
I could take out two of you before anybody gets off a shot.
you all just committed a felony.
protecting one of our own, Nathan.
you should understand that.
what are you doing here?
and what the hell are you doing with the Rev?
just some concerned citizens trying to protect our town.
we're trying to find that boy and the killer who took him.
killer's dead.
you have no idea what we're dealing with.
and you've got no authority to be here.
we know how to hunt down evil and we know what to do when we find it.
unlike you.
you ask the boy's father if he wants us to leave.
we need the numbers.
what, are you insane?
insane is doing the same thing over and over again when it gets you nowhere.
so you make a date with the Rev?
is this just about Evi?
Evi's dead.
and for the first time, I am seeing things clearly.
now stay out of my way.
I think he's finally lost it.
it's one way to deal with loss
pretend it doesn't matter.
how do you explain him pointing a gun at your face?
bluffing maybe. Hopefully.
Yeah.
well, I don't think that his friends were.
I think we're gonna need to watch our backs, Nathan.
the Rev's been talking a long time.
I think he's finally making his move.
somehow Duke's a part of it.
Hey, sasquatch.
laces.
that's a nice crossbow.
you going to a renaissance faire?
I can never figure out where that damn thing is coming from.
I hear a squirrel.
we are in the woods, Nathan.
two squirrels chattering means they're having a conversation.
this is just one.
it means he's scared of something large.
boy scouts?
moose Hunter Magazine.
I was a kid.
that thing sounds terrified.
some girl's.
probably a teenager.
how many people does this thing need to eat?
things.
plural.
I think we're surrounded.
no, no, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot.
dad, dad. Let me go.
don't resist. Stop it. Stop it.
what the hell are you doing?
answer me!
I killed him, all right? The sick bastard chased me out of the diner.
he tried to kill me.
I killed him. I had to.
how exactly did you kill him, Rory?
God. - Bart?
something bit my leg.
it came from behind me. I didn't see it.
I didn't hear it until it was too late.
it moves real fast, but the damn thing is human.
Rory, come back here!
Rory doesn't seem too worried about whatever's out there.
I don't think it's after him. I think it's after us.
it's getting dark.
those things are coming for us, so we need to stick together.
I, uh...
I guess we're out of matches.
who the hell do you think you are?
you lie to me, you threaten Nathan, and then you come over here and you ask for fire tips?
no.
get out of my face, Duke.
fine. Damn it, Audrey,
I came over here to tell you that you can trust me.
what? - I know exactly what I'm doing.
getting in bed with the Rev?
you do realize one of those guys killed Evi.
don't act like you don't care about that.
the Rev killed Evi.
one way or the other, it goes back to him.
and, yeah, I'd have my revenge right now if he didn't know about every other mystery in my life
Evi, the tattoo, my father.
it's me.
okay?
I feel like I am on to something big.
but I don't have any idea what it is.
welcome to the club.
you know I want answers too.
dried grass packed with animal dung.
burns forever.
Thanks.
did the FBI teach you that?
I don't know where I learned it.
I don't know who I was when I learned it.
can you believe that?
you know, with you, Audrey, there's nothing I don't believe.
okay, listen, you know that I'm the last person to tell anyone how to lead their life, but just know that some doors you kick open, you can never close again.
you hear that? - Hear what?
that.
can you see it? - No, what?
it's there. - Cover the perimeter.
what are you doing? - I'm taking the fight to the enemy.
we're with you.
Amen, reverend.
Duke's gonna get himself killed.
Oh, God.
you're Nathan Wuornos, aren't you? - Who are you?
please, you have to help us.
Sophie, no.
no what?
she's hungry.
come on, Nathan.
you couldn't have just disappeared.
officer Parker.
what happened?
I don't know. Must have scared it away.
everybody went back to camp.
okay, we don't know what we're up against out here, all right?
so when your men splinter off to play action hero, it puts the whole group at risk.
Oh, we know what we're up against.
we're chasing down the troubled.
only this time, we're gonna do it my way.
your way is gonna get people killed.
maybe.
but it'll be the right people.
you know, the way you've been coddling the troubled, that's cost a lot of people their lives.
so now we're gonna do what we should have done a long time ago.
wipe 'em out.
Reverend.
Where's Nathan?
Parker, it's me.
come on.
meet Frankie and Sophie Benton.
sisters...
and wendigos.
whose blood is that? - Don't worry. It's from a deer.
you have some on your face.
wait.
I thought you ate people. - We can survive on most live flesh.
people is the only thing we hunger for.
that--that doesn't mean that we would actually
I would-- I would never let us.
they're troubled.
their parents were killed in a plane that went down over Newfoundland about three months ago. It seems to have been the trigger.
I'm sorry.
we dragged our stuff in here about a week later.
it's the only way we can live sort of normally.
in town with all the smells, it's unbearable.
so if you don't eat people, then what happened to the killer?
explain the body we found.
it's not fair. She gets to do whatever she wants.
life isn't fair. - Wait, who's she?
Amelia, our middle sister.
she ran off about a week ago.
she went into town.
Frankie, do you recognize this?
I helped pick it out.
okay, well, we think Amelia's got a boyfriend, Rory Campbell?
is it possible Rory could have lured the serial killer into the woods for Amelia to eat?
that relationship has always been way too intense.
that would explain why he ran away when we found him.
here, chew the gum.
it's what happens when we don't eat. - Sorry.
this way!
I think I hear something!
I'm doing the best that I can, but I need help.
can you get Sophie somewhere safe?
there's a place near the northeast corner of the park.
but what about Amelia? - Well, do you know where Amelia and Rory would hide?
they used to meet up by the old Ranger Station.
they weren't there when I checked, but you never know.
okay, we'll look.
go. Go.
the Rev is making his move.
if we don't find Amelia first, he'll kill her.
we can't find anything in the dark.
first thing in the morning, we'll go to that Ranger Station.
has it gotten better?
it's gotten worse. Frankie was right.
we never should have done this.
I'm so hungry now. I can't take it.
this is just the withdrawal part.
it's gonna be bad, and then you're gonna turn a corner.
I promise. - How do you know that?
you don't know.
fine.
I believe, okay? I wish you did.
I'm a freak.
I'm not giving up on you.
so don't give up on yourself.
you can't be this close.
okay.
we've got to get you some food.
the cabin is just a little further.
the Rev's group should get there shortly after we do.
you made a fine choice joining us.
it took a long time.
I think you're right on both counts.
as men we're defined by our moral boundaries.
and if we allow them to be compromised in even the smallest way, you live a false life.
some men never learn that.
well, I guess I've just got an old soul.
you've been through a great deal.
you and I gotta sit down and have a long conversation after all this is over.
you have the opportunity to succeed in Haven where your father so tragically failed.
failed at what exactly?
saving our town.
I believe it's your destiny, son.
that's a conversation I look forward to.
so do I.
probably here at some point but impossible to know when.
and where they are now.
rev's gone.
he was behind me, and then all of a sudden he, uh, - he wasn't. - And you didn't hear anything?
no. - It's that thing.
Bart went to the hospital, so it snatched the reverend instead.
some footprints over here. They head into the woods.
let's go.
wait.
wait, no.
those guys are wandering blind right now.
how far is it to the ??? park
quarter mile, give or take.
we're gonna need Frankie's help.
we're gonna have to run for it.
someone needs to stay here in case they double back.
Yeah, you got it.
okay.
thank God.
there's something wrong with Sophie.
she's burning up. I think it's the hunger.
it's stronger than she is.
she needs a doctor.
can't take her to a hospital.
too many people and too much blood. I have a medical kit in the truck.
her body needs food.
I'm not talking about another deer.
let me worry about that.
you help Nathan and Audrey.
we're looking for Amelia.
we need your help, Frankie.
you need to eat, Amelia.
it's the only way we're getting out of here alive.
he was going to kill you.
they're coming.
Sophie, what's your favorite ballet? - The nutcracker.
you gonna be Marie someday?
I'm gonna be the prince.
I like the prince too.
and the Sugarplum Fairy.
how do you know so much?
my daughter loved ballet.
what's her name?
help! Over here.
help! Help!
Hey, I'm over here!
it's Rory.
Hey, over here!
I hear you, son. Where are you?
help! Where is it coming from?
over here! Help!
I'm over here! - This way.
over here!
Hey, help!
over here!
help!
help!
over here! - It's coming from over here.
help!
wait! Wait! Rory is that way, but the blood's in the opposite direction.
are you sure?
I can't believe you can't smell it.
over here! Help!
Sophie, come here.
I can't get this off my leg.
I can't get you out of here. - Yes, you can.
it's a bear trap.
I can't get out of it.
there's only one way you're gonna get better.
no.
Sophie, you're not gonna die out here.
you have to do this.
I can't eat you.
you're gonna save me.
run.
I'm not gonna be able to hold out much longer.
you did the right thing.
please, don't. I'm sorry for everything.
this isn't about vengeance. My life doesn't matter.
this is about the lives you'd take if I let you go.
I can control it, I promise.
no, you can't.
evil always rises to the surface.
that's why you gotta
you gotta cut it off where it lives.
Amelia! Don't touch her!
rev, stop, don't do it.
you were aiming for his shoulder, right?
no, no, no. Stay right where you are, son. Don't move.
who did this?
I did. He was gonna kill her.
so what?
she's a monster. He's a man of God.
officer Parker followed procedure and prevented a murder.
it was a proper kill, end of story.
I gave her a couple of drops of morphine to stabilize her.
it's only temporary. - What about you?
you should get that leg looked at.
I'll drop them off first.
I didn't think I was strong enough to make it through this.
now I know that I am.
I'll be here when you come back, Amelia.
I promise.
let's go. - I love you.
there was fire Where is he taking them?
you probably don't wanna know.
Yeah, I do.
slaughterhouse. Out by route 14.
livestock.
kind of a livework setup till the troubles are over.
there comes a time What the hell happened out there?
there's going to be an inquiry into the shooting.
I'm going to have to explain why I didn't aim for his leg.
that's a good question.
why didn't you? - Are you serious?
look, you're-- you're not gonna see me crying at the Rev's funeral, but your timing, Audrey
an hour before you killed him, he was dangling the keys to Haven in front of my nose and I was this close.
because of you,
I got nothing.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I screwed up your plans.
no.
if you were with the Rev and he was about to kill that little girl, would you have stopped him?
honestly, I don't know.
well, you need to figure that out, Duke, because while you're looking for answers, the rest of us, we're fighting a war.
I did what I had to do.
somebody out there with a tattoo wants to kill me.
you have the opportunity to succeed where your father so tragically failed.
we're chasing down the troubled.
we're gonna do what we should have done a long time ago.
wipe 'em out.
maybe by shooting the rev, I just made things worse.
I found this for you. Whose address is this?
Lucy Ripley's.
thank you.
excuse me, are you Lucy Ripley? A man came here.
do you remember his name? Simon Crocker.
whatever is going on in this town, they think that you're in the middle of it.
what? Tell me.
you're gonna tell him what he wants to know, or I will.
damn it!
you're not gonna believe what my father had hidden below decks.
your father is exactly why I'm here. I think he was looking for me.
it's up to you to finish my work. You must kill her.
why did he want you to kill me?
bill, wake up!
Sheila's in danger.
you have to go over there.
this has to be a dream. There's someone in my house.
you can't be here. You're dead.
please, Bill, he has a gun.
Hurry!
I'm coming, Sheila.
how can you be here?
no, Sheila.
no lights. He'll see you. Oh. Okay, honey.
where is he?
follow me.
I'll keep you safe until Bill gets here.
nice shooting, Bill.
what happened? Payback.
for screwing my wife.
Audrey. Hey, Duke.
can I talk to you?
actually, I'm busy. Can we just do this later?
no.
I don't think we can.
I need you to know that
I'm not on some kind of mission for my dad.
I didn't like him when he was alive, and I'm certainly not gonna kill anyone for him now that he is dead.
especially not you. It's good.
I can check that off my list. I don't wanna joke about this.
listen.
we'll figure it out, right?
right.
well...
you're a welcome sight.
what's knittin', kitten?
that you?
that was the biggest fish I ever caught, but that was a long time ago.
in fact, that salmon held a -- And that's you too, right?
well, I don't recall exactly, but
no more lies!
all this time, I've been searching for my identity, and you knew who I was?
why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry. Vince.
she knows.
what's the point now?
why are you lying to me?
we were waiting until you...
what? Ready?
I'm ready now.
so talk.
who am I?
you were Lucy.
before that, Sarah.
before that, we're not sure.
there's a lot we don't understand.
like where you go in between the troubles.
how you always look the same.
but...
you have a new person's memory each time you return.
the only thing that's the same is that you always help the troubled when you do.
who is agent Howard?
great.
that's great.
Yeah, go ahead.
it was Sarah's.
the woman in the photo.
why do you have it?
she was a...
friend.
it belongs to you now.
damn it.
from Nathan: caught a case call me asap
all right, this conversation is not over.
you told her too much.
she needs my help.
and you're not getting in my way this time.
very impressive, Duke.
like what you've done with my place.
dad?
you're dead.
we start at 9: 00 A. M. in the Haven P. D.
where were you? Who's the vic?
a neighbor woke her up with three shots to the chest.
he admits to the shooting. He's in some kind of shock.
he keeps repeating, "Arlo made me do it."
so? That's where it gets interesting.
Arlo was Sheila's husband.
so an angry ex? Try dead husband.
that's a lame stab at an insanity defense.
so what's the interesting part? Neighbors.
they heard the shots and saw Arlo leaving the house.
okay, so if he faked his death, then there's got to be some kind of digital trail. Email, phone calls, bank accounts
they all leave a record.
we should have dinner.
together.
dinner.
sure.
tomorrow night?
we can talk about Lucy and...
everything.
uh, how about I
how about I make pancakes?
are we talking dinner or--or...
breakfast?
damn.
I really hoped I'd walked back in here to see that you'd disappeared.
you're taking this well.
Yes, I am.
you see, I'm pretty sure that you're the result of the brownies that this girl gave me last night.
God, what was her name?
tall, Dutch girl?
you're not imagining this.
says the dead guy I last saw 27 years ago.
but sure.
okay, let's go with it.
let's say you're real.
how are you? How you been?
why are you back? I don't know.
let me take a guess.
you're gonna disappear for a few days, and I won't have any idea why.
and then you'll show back up bloody and beaten up, and expect me to nurse you back to health.
look.
I know I was a crap father and worse husband.
check and check.
you know,
I gotta tell you.
you are much smarter dead and imaginary.
you found my weapons.
the troubles must be back. Yes, they are. You know?
I'm -- this must be a dream.
that's got to be -- are there mermaids out there?
you cure anybody yet?
Ah, no. Not that I'm aware of.
you know, this has been fun, but I'm gonna go back to bed and hope that I wake up.
you are awake.
you know that's real, right?
right.
I know I wasn't around.
but there was a reason. Okay?
I was out saving people. Oh, really?
and how were you out saving people?
when someone from our family kills a cursed person, we don't just kill their body.
we kill the curse, too.
that's our trouble.
so you save them from being alive.
got it.
the curse dies in the whole family. No one will ever get it again.
not the children. Not the grandchildren. No one.
the curse never comes back.
you just have to murder somebody to do it.
you really are a piece of work.
now I know why I'm here.
to make you understand.
Arlo's estate's been settled.
his credit cards are canceled.
smart people who fake their own deaths put away the plastic.
only one way to find out for sure if he's dead
talk to the gravedigger.
excuse me.
Yeah. Haven P. D.
I know who you are.
because of you, I had to bury reverend Driscoll, the finest man in Haven.
and I know what you are. You need to watch your mouth.
it's a free country.
his kind wants to have meetings, and my kind needs to call it like it is.
I need you to dig up Arlo McMartin.
you got a court order? You're on probation, right?
so? So that joint you just tossed?
it could cost you some time.
or you could dig up a grave.
it's your call.
definitely not faking it.
so what do you think?
clones, ghosts
zombies are trendy.
where?
okay, we'll meet you there.
homicide. Another dead guy do it?
no.
dead girl told her brother to do it.
it says here that your sister, Annie
she committed suicide over a year ago.
after Kurt raped her.
Annie sat down right next to me and told me the truth.
and Kurt confirmed this?
eventually.
does it seem to you like Bruce's sister came back for revenge?
or to tell the truth. To her big brother?
same thing. Nathan.
heard there was a murder on Woodland Drive.
at the McMartin house, right?
Sheila was shot three times.
and the killer claims to have seen Arlo McMartin.
could Bill and Sheila have been a couple?
everyone knew that. Were they sleeping together before Arlo died?
that's what killed Arlo.
someone told him and bam, massive coronary.
so maybe the dead are coming back to settle old scores?
and they're using the living to do it for them.
you'll be all right, Kyle.
more than all right.
Reverend Driscoll.
how?
God has sent me to finish my work in Haven.
will you help me?
what do you see?
a field.
and 26 years ago, last May, there was a third-grade camp out here.
Mrs. Holloway's class.
Yeah, all those kids died.
I knew some of them.
remember how they died?
food poisoning.
or not.
the tents were pitched in a big circle, here around a fire.
Mrs. Holloway told a campfire story.
it scared Jenny Mears so bad that her curse kicked in.
fear poured out of her in toxic ways.
12 kids and 2 chaperons died.
what does that have to do with you?
I could have saved them.
I had a chance to kill Jenny's grandfather a week before their trip.
but you didn't.
no.
I couldn't.
the day after it happened, he begged me to kill him.
and then you did.
his pain was over in a minute.
Uh-huh. - Mine lasted.
every time I saw the parents of those kids.
you have a responsibility, Duke.
a destiny.
you can go back to hell.
hasn't anyone you know ever died because of the troubles?
anyone you cared about?
you could have saved them.
our dead people had different families and had different jobs.
one died of natural causes.
the other one committed suicide.
one was catholic, and the other was agnostic.
and, uh, they both had funeral services at different-- different churches.
but both were buried at
Eastside cemetery.
you know, I'll just
our brothers will need to find 'em.
I know you think you know Duke.
I do. No, you don't.
a couple years ago,
Duke rolled back into town.
invited me to go fishing.
wanted to be friends again.
it felt good. I...
let myself believed he'd changed.
then I found out the real reason he wanted me to go fishing
to cover for him smuggling.
he figured if the Coast Guard pulled up,
I could flash my badge.
I--I was so pissed...
I went after him.
and we
we beat on each other for an hour.
and then I realized that
I couldn't feel it.
my trouble came back because of that fight with Duke, and I don't think he even gave a damn.
maybe Duke's changed.
you can never trust him.
okay. Come on.
here, found it.
okay.
so Bruce's sister's grave looks untouched.
just like Arlo's.
everything looks normal.
cemetery normal, at least.
I don't get it.
what?
you don't see them?
see who?
dead people, all around us.
you don't see them? They're all around us.
must be 20 of them, more.
no, I don't -- I don't see anybody.
but you do? Why?
maybe it's because you're immune to the troubles?
so ghosts are wandering the streets of Haven, and I'm the only one that can't see them. That's perfect.
they're leaving.
okay, where are they going? Worst case?
off to kill 20 more people.
wonderful.
looks like the dead are making their presence known.
there's no way we can track them all.
we gotta find who's causing this.
so I ended up burying the weapons box.
let me get this straight. You can end a trouble?
just have to kill someone to do it.
try not to forget that part.
wait, wasn't your father buried at Seaside?
seaside is eroding.
they moved him here about a year ago.
wait, who moved him?
somebody from this cemetery, I guess.
we need to get a hold of the caretaker, find out who buried who.
Mm-hmm. - Maybe that's our link.
do you ever wonder why you're here?
no. I mean, that's the one thing I don't wonder about anymore.
I'm here to help the troubled.
Yeah. But doesn't it
doesn't it bother you that you never really solve anything?
I mean, a week goes by, a month, 20 years, whatever.
the troubles keep coming back, and people keep dying.
I have no alternative.
but what if you did?
the caretaker said that the person who moved Simon is the same guy that buried Arlo McMartin and Annie.
Mm-hmm. - It's Kyle Hopkins.
we need to find him.
that's, uh -- Wait, what do -- what do you see?
the chief?
but he wasn't buried at Eastside.
what is he doing here?
take it from me.
you may not wanna know.
go.
go, go talk to him. What do I say?
Nathan, it doesn't matter what you say, all right?
you get a chance to be with your dad again. That's a gift.
you don't pass that up. Just go.
I'll -- I'll find Kyle.
you two gonna be all right? Yeah.
go.
reunions are overrated.
in memory of Rufus P. Barker,
no matter how well prepared you are for something, dying has got a way of sneaking up on you.
Hello, Nathan.
chief.
you all right?
Oh, you get blown to a thousand pieces and tell me how you feel.
I guess I'm mostly one piece here.
so what was the story?
how did you explain my death and everything?
I told people you were lost at sea.
well, I - I picked up your pieces.
put them in a cooler. Buried you on Goose Hill.
you buried me in a cooler?
Yeah.
what cooler? Blue one.
what a waste of a good cooler.
dad, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
I missed the rain. That's not why you're here.
there's plenty of what you miss. That's not why you're here.
I'm not back from the dead ten minutes, and you're already jumping all over me?
I'm not
Yeah, you are.
ghosts are coming back to settle scores.
is that what you're doing? No.
no, I don't think so.
I suspect
I'm here to see you, son.
how are things? How are you doing?
I'm talking to my dead dad in a graveyard.
a serious question needs a serious answer.
it's getting more and more dangerous.
the troubles are everywhere.
the Rev's death has people stirred up.
Reverend Driscoll is dead?
Yeah.
Parker shot him.
good for her.
good.
you knew her when she was Lucy.
why didn't you tell her?
well, think about that question for a second, and tell me what I should have said to her?
I don't think you appreciate just how precarious our position is here.
this town is, like, sitting on top of a volcano, and you're worried about how she feels?
come on.
you two have gotten kind of close. Is that so?
I don't know what you mean.
are you in love? I don't know what it is.
well, stop. What?
you two can't be in love.
she's just too important to this town. What does one have to do with the other?
because, Nathan, if she's in love with you, she'll wanna take risks for you, and we can't have that.
you have got to keep her alive. Understand me?
you came back to tell me that?
that I can't
that I can't be in love with Audrey?
Yeah, I guess I did.
well then, you wasted your time.
okay, I can't see the dead, so I need you to be my eyes. Perfect.
Oh, here. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Audrey, what are we doing?
thought you wanted to go look for this Kyle guy.
these have been popping up around town. I've seen a few of them.
so?
huh. What happened here?
was somebody attacked?
are you okay?
you know what? Um
if you wanna go check the house,
I can keep watch out there.
Thanks.
Hello?
you better not be here to hurt her.
I got more important things to do.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
I've come back for you.
all right, my father told me about his job.
not interested.
your father is here? Good.
come with me. Well, you know what?
think I'm gonna let the two of you catch up.
maybe you could hit the senior center together.
Duke, people followed me when I was alive.
think what they'll do for me now.
come with me.
or I'll take my revenge on Audrey Parker.
Kyle's house is coming up.
I can't believe Duke just left you there.
and I can't believe that you're not gonna tell me what your dad said.
I told you. He said you're important to the town.
okay. And that's it?
he said he missed the rain on his face. Yeah, I know that.
that's Wuornos for "I'm not telling you.
but don't worry. I'm not worried.
I'll get it out of you later.
can I help you? Hi. We're looking
we're actually--we're looking for 134 Draper Place, the Gundersons? Don't know them.
and this is Park Street.
Oh, wow, I am so sorry.
I told you to ask for directions.
he does this all the time.
did you see the red on her hands?
it's the same color as the x's I was telling you about.
what do the x's have to do with Kyle? I don't know.
but it's too much of a coincidence that they showed up now.
let's follow and see if she leads us to her husband.
chloroform?
get the door.
they're gonna burn that building.
people in the shed must be troubled.
I guess we know what the xs marked.
Oh, my God.
the Rev is here.
what is Duke doing here?
you tell me what's happening or I'm out of here.
take a look.
Oh, my God. What have you done?
they're not dead, just unconscious.
couldn't risk their curses causing us problems.
you are insane.
all of you. You are all insane.
I am not gonna stand here and let you burn these people. No, they're not gonna burn.
you're gonna save them.
what are you doing?
you're working with the Rev?
what?
no.
no, of course, not. I
I remember when you preached forgiveness.
I'm fresh out of forgiveness.
should I put them in the shed, reverend?
no, you should let them go. You don't need to take orders from a dead man.
especially since you're the one who brought him back, Kyle.
what are you talking about? We talked to the caretaker.
everyone that's come back -- they have one thing in common.
you dug their graves.
call him.
check for yourself.
so what? I dug a lot of graves.
they always fight the truth at first.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
Reverend, tell them it's not true.
then they have their moment, where they realize why all their lives they felt different.
honey, they're wrong. I swear.
and then they start to beg.
Reverend Driscoll, please.
sorry, can't help you, Kyle.
but he can.
he can save your unborn child from that terrible curse.
no.
no, wait, wait. Hold on.
save him.
save his family.
it's time, son.
what are you doing? Please.
you have to do it.
you have to save my child from getting the curse.
from me.
no, we can stop this.
don't listen to her.
she's a liar.
no.
she's my friend.
your friend killed your grandfather.
her name was Sarah then.
she was Lucy when she killed me.
Duke, put the knife down.
now she's called Audrey.
and she will kill you.
no.
the tattooed man is supposed to kill me.
she doesn't have to do it with her own hands.
no, don't.
I love you.
thank you.
my son will be safe now.
I know you helped her kill me, Garland.
no.
she just beat me to it.
I hear she killed you too.
at least he's got a taste of what he's capable of.
that's all that matters. Well, she'll kill him, too.
not this time.
she can't stop my son.
I have a son too, you know.
damn good one.
just take care of our girl.
okay?
put your guns down, now.
now!
you're all under arrest.
heard the chief was back.
made me wonder how that happened, so I started looking for an explanation...
and I found one. Dave.
when did you have the Hopkins kid dig him up?
I had no idea any of this would happen.
Yeah.
I picked Kyle to dig him up three weeks ago.
you did this without even talking to me.
well, you wouldn't have agreed. Damn right.
we need Garland back.
no, we don't.
we'll be fine. You're fooling yourself, Dave.
it's different this time.
she's different this time.
Nathan, you're early.
where is she? Where is who?
what did you do with her?
she's missing?
Nathan, I swear I didn't do anything to her.
you were in her apartment.
no, I wasn't.
now, think.
think.
why would I hurt Audrey?
you got five seconds.
Nathan, if I was gonna hurt her...
three... I would have been waiting for you.
I'm done counting.
the first time I felt your touch was the day you kissed me.
I hadn't felt anything for a long time.
I will find Audrey. She will kill me.
the Troubles will end.
what is this barn that I'm supposedly entering?
it's... it's a space between two worlds, and it's been badly damaged.
if you don't leave soon, you will die.
if I make it to the other side, who will I be?
whoever you most want to be.
the Troubles haven't ended. Killing me is the only way now.
I'm not killing anyone, certainly not someone I've never met before.
and who is Audrey? My name is Lexie.
your name is Lexie?
I guess you guys were expecting somebody else?
shoot him! - I'm not shooting anyone.
who are you people?
jordan, if she's not Audrey anymore, then her killing Nathan isn't gonna end The Troubles.
it only works if she loves him. -Then I might as well shoot him myself!
Vince, get your people under control!
run!
he's getting away!
forget Crocker! Get Wuornos!
Hey! Come on, come on, come on!
where am I? - Maine.
don't worry... after a while, you kind of get used to it.
almost got him! - Down the other side.
don't move.
you're just gonna kill him, right here?
we had a deal, Vince. We agreed he had to die.
but things have changed. That door never should have been opened.
not now, Dave! - Don't do this, Vince.
I'm sorry, Nathan.
okay, listen up, you lunatics. Move a muscle, lose your head.
I know it doesn't seem like I know how to use this thing, but I do.
what do you want, Lexie? - Ideally?
a stiff drink and a reason why y'all are trying to blow away "cheekbones" here.
I'll take care of her.
listen, I know you're angry, honey, but I'm hoping you're not stupid too.
excuse me, Lexie! Hi.
my name is Duke.
and I would actually prefer that they didn't shoot "cheekbones" here either.
now, I think I can clear this whole thing up if I could just talk to this gentleman right over here...
the, uh... the big one.
okay.
there's nothing more to say, Duke.
really, Vince?
because everybody here still wants The Troubles to end...
and I think I know how.
this is insane!
can't we just turn Lexie back into Audrey?
can't be changed back.
we tried once a long time ago.
so we find the barn again, shove her back in, - see what that does. - You won't find it.
it's gone, for good this time.
what? - Vince, Jennifer's trouble gives her some kind of connection to the barn, okay?
she can hear it. - I could hear it, not anymore, not since Lexie walked out and I heard someone say the barn was dying.
on the upside, I might be normal again, so... - Oh, how nice for you.
but the rest of us don't get off that easy.
which is why my plan makes sense. - We can't go on like this.
we have to end it, and Lexie killing Nathan right now is our best shot.
or it ruins our chance of ending The Troubles forever.
you're just doing whatever you can to keep your friend alive!
and you just want to kill him, sweetheart.
look, clearly you... - Enough!
jordan's right. The Troubles are destroying this town.
we must end them.
get Dwight on the phone.
how's your head?
I can't feel it. - Oh, tough guy.
why don't you just let me take a look at it.
I've stitched up a couple cuts in my day.
Oh, sorry. - Sure.
it's okay.
that's not even worth a stitch.
good news... you're gonna live.
you got any idea what they're talking about or saying in there?
no, I can't hear. It's probably for the best.
I'd actually like, you know, a heads-up if we're gonna get tortured or killed or made to work in a newspaper.
I think I'm the prisoner here, Aud...
you're safe. - See, here's the thing, okay?
I went to work today.
I showed up, and I pretty much found out that my entire existence is like some kind of a dream or something.
then I went through a supernatural door.
I landed here, and people just put guns in my hands, and now I'm locked up.
so I'm not really feeling that, um, safe.
tell me who you thought you were.
Oh, I'm a bartender.
I used to complain about crappy tips, but I swear to God,
I'm never gonna complain about anything again.
did a man named agent Howard... black, bald...
did he help you get here? - No.
actually, the guy's name was William.
did he tell you what you're doing here?
all he said was that I belonged in this crazy town and that somehow I was important.
you two, come with me.
Vince told me, but wow.
Yeah.
you brought us to a crime scene? - You, stay here, please.
Hey, listen, are we gonna get some lunch or something?
cause I could eat. - We think it's a trouble.
a kid named Josh was having breakfast with Katie over there, and then he went nuts, like a switch flipped.
attacked her. Employees locked him in the kitchen, and he's still in there.
are you sure you don't need me? - I need you for that other thing.
it's critical for this to work.
after everything that just happened, you want me to solve a trouble? - Yes.
someone tell me what the hell is going on?
Duke has a plan.
well, it's really pretty simple.
if Audrey loves you when she kills you,
troubles end, right?
the same rule should apply if Lexie falls for you.
you want Lexie to fall in love with me?
spend some time with her. Get to know her.
she can help you with this trouble.
she's not even a cop anymore. She's a bartender.
whatever personality she has, she's always helped with The Troubles. It's who she is.
you make sure this happens.
if it doesn't, the guard won't just be here for Nathan.
good pep talk.
this is your plan? - No.
this is your plan, remember? - No...
just a different girl this time. - I'm in love with Audrey.
I just wanted to go to the bathroom.
what the hell kind of town is this?
Hey, we just want to help.
stop calling me Josh!
Josh, you're surrounded.
put the knife down. This is over.
you're damn right it's over.
I trusted her.
and look where that got me!
Oh, my...
God.
so you and Josh knew each other pretty well.
he was my boyfriend Tyler's best friend.
mine too.
but, uh, Tyler wasn't with you then. - No, he's still in the hospital.
we were in a car accident a few days ago.
it was, uh, pretty bad. - So what caused the accident?
Tyler lost control.
for some reason, he just drove right into a wall.
it's a miracle Josh and I walked away.
interesting.
you can jump in here anytime you want, detective.
right.
Katie, all right, thanks.
officer Rafferty!
officer Rafferty will take your formal statement.
welcome back, detective.
Oh, actually, I'm not... - You know what?
it's great, isn't it?
mazel tov. We're all very happy, thank you.
look, you want to try to explain this to everyone?
you know, we still need them to think she's a cop.
Yeah, but I'm not a cop, and I'm not Audrey, okay?
this is insane.
Oh, I know this is all very confusing...
but... - You know...
we are gonna need your help to figure it out.
you know what? It seems like everybody needs something from me, but you know what I need?
I need to eat.
so is that candy machine... Is that gonna kill me?
no.
baby ruths stick, so don't push, um, p-3.
p3. Got it.
I mean, you are just charming the pants off of her.
she fell in love with you when you were a cop.
so, come on, you know... be a cop, man.
you know, figure this out. What is happening here?
they both had suicidal thoughts.
it sounds like whatever trouble hit Josh might have hit Katie's boyfriend, Tyler, too.
great. Hope it's contagious.
okay, so, uh...
where do you and your new partner want to go next?
the hospital.
talk to Tyler. - A hospital.
that's perfect.
I need to get my head scanned.
no, I'm serious.
I can't move my legs. I probably never will.
but I guess I'm lucky to be alive, right?
Tyler, Katie said you crashed when you lost control of your car.
did anything odd happen just before the accident?
you're gonna think I'm crazy, but right before we crashed,
Katie looked at me funny, and something happened.
I couldn't control myself. My body did its own thing.
that's why I crashed. I'm sorry.
you didn't say anything about Katie to the cops at the scene?
why would I?
it doesn't make any sense. - It does if your girlfriend is Troubled.
I've heard of those.
but Katie? No.
I can't believe it.
Tyler, if you think of anything else, give me a call.
Hey, kid.
I'm gonna write you a prescription.
when you get out, that'll get you a free round at the gull.
Thanks.
what did the doctor say? - Right as rain.
healthy. But I don't really trust doctors.
well, you know, you should have seen detective Wuornos questioning Tyler in there.
it was... it was good.
Really? - Sounds like he was affected by the same thing Josh was, and in both cases, Katie was right there, so she could have some sort of "black widow" trouble...
uh, brainwashing guys to try and kill themselves.
and Troubled people in this town... They can do that stuff?
why the hell does anybody still live here?
thanks for bringing me home.
after what you've been through, I-I get it.
Katie, are you okay?
it worked again. - What?
I had this coming. - No!
apparently Katie stepped out in front of the car like she was brainwashed too.
so it's somebody else's grim reaper trouble making the rounds, then.
what do you think the chances are that we made his hit list, huh, cheekbones?
do you have any idea how hard this is for me?
look, even though I knew it meant I was gonna die, - I still wanted to find Audrey. - I did too.
now, I am trying to fix all of this, and you should start trying too.
come be awesome. - Poor girl.
did she do that to herself with her trouble thing?
we think she's another victim like Josh.
Where'd you get that?
Oh, the cop gave it to me.
Hey, does everybody here think that I'm Audrey?
well, we told everyone that you had amnesia, that you thought you were somebody else and that, you know, working would hopefully help you remember who you were.
here. - No.
before I jumped out of the barn, William told me that I belonged in Haven, that I had a purpose. So maybe stopping those people from shooting you and helping you figure out what happened to Josh and Katie...
maybe that's...
maybe that's what William was talking about.
what are you doing here? - Hey.
I brought you some of your clothes.
I mean, Audrey's clothes... sorry.
Ah, 50 shades of beige?
at least they should fit, right?
okay, well, I will make sure to avoid mirrors.
let's go.
you're really doing this? - No, of course not.
back there in the woods, I was just trying to buy time, keep him alive.
I never thought that the guard would buy it, but they did, and now I just have to keep this ball in the air.
okay. Let's go.
no.
look...
this trouble is bad.
I want you to stay away from it.
the three of us got it covered. - The three of you, of course.
I wasn't trying to tag along or anything.
it was force of habit, I guess.
and I've got to go get my stuff out of her apartment, so...
good luck.
excuse me. Uh, we're closed.
right. Well...
we're open now.
for a broken heart, may I recommend Tequila? Rebound in a bottle.
money problems... scotch.
or if you're just after some afternoon fun...
beer.
on the house. - Thanks.
you want to tell your bartender your Troubles?
it's an American tradition. - You got all day?
Yep.
I'm surprised you came here, Jordan.
I think you found the wrong Crocker.
you're Duke's brother? - Yeah.
perfect.
give us a minute?
come on, I got something to show you.
someone targeted Tyler, Josh, and Katie.
Why?
revenge, jealousy, betrayal...
you know, Greek tragedy stuff. - I think it's all of the above.
uh, we got this, Lexie.
no, I don't think you do, detective woo-or-nose.
Wuornos. - Listen, I'm just saying that when you were talking to Katie,
I picked up a little bit of a guilt vibe.
I think she and Josh were hooking up.
bartender.
so could Tyler be our murderer?
Tyler's paralyzed.
he finds out his best friend and girlfriend are cheating on him.
that's motive. - Maybe Tyler lied.
what if the accident really was just an accident?
but then he tries to throw the blame on Katie, and he kills her and Josh.
let's pay him a visit.
you up for this?
it's Haven police again. We need to talk.
Tyler. Hey.
Tyler is dead. - It's not him.
you said that he was a paraplegic.
where could he have gone? - I'll try to find his nurse.
hospital just sent down the security footage.
let's see what we got.
it's like Tyler is controlling him.
where did they go?
it's just like Josh and Katie. They weren't just brainwashed.
Tyler took them over somehow, possessed them.
like what, some kind of supernatural puppet master?
but why kill his poor orderly?
maybe he was tying up a loose end?
maybe Tyler needs to kill him so he can jump back into his own body.
seizures...
looks like Tyler had one every time he possessed somebody.
he lost more of his motor function every time too.
the more he uses his trouble, the worse his own body gets.
does the rest of the world know about this town?
just us lucky ones.
Duke, where are you? - Upstairs.
there's some psychopath in scrubs following me.
he's acting all twitchy like that kid Josh was.
what the hell's going on here? - Tyler must know we're onto him.
he's possessed someone else.
Duke, that person's an innocent victim, so don't engage.
Duke? - In here!
okay, I engaged a little.
he's fine. I got him in here. - Stay back.
move! Move!
this was a trap.
you're Tyler.
surprise.
give me your phones... now!
give it to me. - Oh.
I just got that.
your trouble kicked in after the car crash, didn't it, Tyler?
then you figured out how you could use it to kill Josh.
Josh was an accident.
I was lying there in that bed, paralyzed, and then suddenly I was in Josh when he was out with my girlfriend, and I found out what they were doing.
so you killed them both on purpose? - My life was ruined!
and they... they were supposed to be my friends.
but then I realized what I could do.
it was my chance.
they got what they had coming.
you need things, don't you... objects?
the real you holds on to something, and that lets you control whoever gave it to you.
when you possessed the orderly, you were holding a remote... he gave it to you.
and Josh and Katie... They gave you get-well cards.
Duke gave you that drink ticket.
right after you gave me your business card, so don't try anything.
Tyler, you can't keep this up.
it was on your charts.
your real body is falling apart the more you possess people.
you're gonna die. - Which is why I'm trading my body in for this one...
permanently.
now, get in there...
or I'll shoot your girlfriend.
now.
move. - Okay.
this is what Vince, Dave, and I have been working on for the last six months...
another way to end The Troubles.
so what did you find? - Nothing.
everything Nathan is saying is true. Lexie needs to kill the man she loves.
so we just sit around and wait for them to fall in love?
I mean, it's preposterous.
whoever she is, she always comes with The Troubles.
does anyone ever stop to ask if maybe the Troubles are her Trouble?
no. No, she solves Troubles.
if Duke Crocker kills someone, their trouble ends.
so what if he killed Lexie? Would all The Troubles end?
nothing we have found says that would work, not... not a single thing.
anything say it wouldn't?
Duke would never kill her, not in a million years.
back so soon, little brother?
what's the, uh, trouble du jour?
you gonna fill me in, huh?
figures.
why would you let me help?
actually, maybe you can help.
see, t-there's this, um...
this Troubled guy who can possess people.
Really? Wow. That can happen?
weird, right? - Yeah.
Yeah, he... he can jump into another person's body and... and control them for a while, but then... whoosh, - he ends up back in his old body. - He's trying to figure out how to keep that from...
happening, how to stay in the other person's body.
well, maybe if he, uh... I don't know... kills the old body, he can stay in the new one.
that'd be a really good idea.
thank you.
you've actually been very helpful.
it's not you, is it?
no, it's not.
now, tell me...
do you have a safe here?
door, three. War-noss, zip.
Wuornos. It...
Oh, right.
Oh, you're funny.
I've been told.
it's good to have a sense of humor to put up with all this crazy stuff.
well, if you're not laughing, you're crying, right?
you know what would be so good right now? Some hard drugs.
some mescaline, peyote, some scotch.
you've done peyote? - Sure.
this morning I flew through a multidimensional door, okay?
I think peyote makes sense. Don't go all cop on me.
no...
I'm just glad you're feeling better.
you know, when we get... We get out of here, maybe we could get some food...
maybe some pancakes.
pancakes?
you son of a bitch.
what happened to Duke? - He's still in here.
he's just...
riding in the backseat.
thanks to you, I think we know how to fix that now.
first, the safe.
now, do you want to tell me where it is, or do I have to beat it out of you?
and now we're out of time.
Duke, I have made up my mind and... and don't try to talk me out of it.
okay.
I'm going back to Boston.
have fun.
okay, well, you could try to talk me out of it just a little.
I'm sorry.
I must have misunderstood.
actually, um...
I'm leaving town too.
what do you think about coming with me?
okay, I think, um...
but where are we...
uh, great. Just...
a little fast.
are you sure about this? - Absolutely.
okay, um, I just need to get my things.
we can get new things.
okay. Yeah, I can be spontaneous.
I just need to make a quick stop.
I need to pay an old friend a final visit.
okay, this clearly is not working.
Wuornos, let me try.
what are you doing?
I've picked a few handcuffs in my day.
you get arrested a lot? - No.
no, I just had a boyfriend who was really into bondage.
you getting a good look?
you know I'm not her, right? - Yeah, I do.
you're a completely different person, and I don't want you.
I want you to be Audrey again.
I'm sorry. I know that's a terrible thing to say. That's just how I feel.
uh, what are we doing at the hospital?
am I gonna have to flash my boobs again?
okay.
what's wrong, babe?
"babe"?
I thought you were acting kind of funny.
maybe a little drunk, but...
I swear you've been infected by a trouble.
I don't know who you really are, but I will shoot you, and I'll probably accidentally hit you in the face, so don't come near me.
thank God!
Duke just went inside, but it wasn't Duke.
Yeah, he's been possessed.
I'm getting used to it. - Wade just called me.
he said Tyler wants to stay in Duke's body permanently, and he thinks he's got to kill his actual body to do it.
and this guy's body is still in the hospital.
Yes, gone through every bit of security footage.
the orderly that moved Tyler never left the building.
and someone accessed the basement at the same time.
what? I was... I was eavesdropping.
so what are you waiting for? Go save Duke.
you didn't give Duke anything, did you?
something he could take in to Tyler's body?
I left my pen in his leg.
so he could take control of you too... any of us.
but isn't she immune to The Troubles?
I mean, they don't affect her, like Audrey. - Okay.
I get it.
is that why I'm so important to all of you people...
cause I'm immune to these trouble things?
what else can I do? - That's a lot.
all right, then maybe I should go in there by myself.
no, you're not going in there on your own.
Tyler can't control me, all right?
I go in there, I take Duke's drink ticket out of Tyler's hand, we get Duke back, and I get a free drink.
no.
okay, I have a question for you.
is all of this real... All this trouble insanity?
Yes, it's real. - Then maybe I need to be here.
this is what I'm supposed to be doing. - That makes sense to me.
I'm the only shot you have at saving your friend.
Tyler can control you, and then you would turn on me.
do you want to take that chance, or do you want to take a chance on me?
here.
three minutes, then I'm coming in.
all right. Got it, Dudley do - right.
you'll be dead before you ever get that thing out of my hand.
you think by killing yourself, you'll be left in control of Duke's body?
well, what if it doesn't work?
what choice do I have?
my body is ruined!
there is no going back for me now.
maybe for you too.
how well do you really know this guy?
I mean, is he really worth dying for?
I'm sorry, Duke.
what's happening to me?
what is this? I can't stop it!
relax, sweetheart.
it's me.
Oh, God.
do you remember anything?
all of it.
it was like I was a fly on my own wall the whole time.
what just happened? And what was going on with your eyes?
my family curse.
when I kill a Troubled person, I kill their trouble too.
when he died, Tyler couldn't control me anymore.
he accidentally ended his own curse.
all right, well, that's good to know.
I've got a... got a lot to learn here.
Yeah.
that was a close one.
all this is Audrey's, huh?
she was really good at this trouble stuff.
very good.
it seems you're good too. - No, I just got lucky.
Duke could have died, and he should've for all I did.
you went in there. You tried.
that means a lot.
so I've heard the whispers.
you had something... you and her.
we had something.
did you and Audrey knock boots?
did you make sweet love?
it's, uh...
complicated.
"Complicated" is what all the married guys tell me when they want to sleep with me.
but I'm guessing with you, though, it really is complicated.
you'd be right.
okay.
you know that wasn't me.
I should've known it wasn't you when you actually seemed interested in what I had to say.
I did call the cops. I saved your ass.
so you could show me some gratitude and tell me what the big secret is about you.
and I am doing you a favor by not sharing it.
he just wants to help.
I'm protecting him.
nothing good is gonna come from him finding out about our family curse.
I just hope that he eventually does what's best for himself and he leaves this place.
I heard what you said to Tyler.
you're going back to Boston?
I am.
well, Lexie's gonna take Audrey's old room upstairs, so...
I suppose you'd have to move out anyways, but if you wanted, I have an extra room in my boat.
stay.
I don't care if the barn is gone.
besides, you can make up for what you did to my leg.
you remember everything that "puppet Duke" did?
you kissed me.
you kissed me back.
let me guess.
you're waiting for my brother.
Nope.
I'm waiting for you.
so I used to live here?
what was I... broke? I mean, it's nice and everything.
it's a little nautical.
well, I'm glad you like it.
you owe me six months' rent.
I just tried to save your life.
shouldn't I get the first month free?
you know, I've been thinking about what happened down in that basement.
you just stepped aside and let Tyler try to take me.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry. I just... I...
I didn't want to get stabbed. I was scared.
see, that's where I get stuck.
the way you jumped out of that barn, went down in that basement...
I guess I'm just having a hard time believing that you were scared.
I think you knew that my curse would kick in and save me.
I really... I don't know the first thing about it.
but Audrey Parker would.
isn't that right, Audrey?
damn it, Duke.
Yeah.
it's me.
I know, Wade. I saw the bodies.
I saw your dumping ground. You're not gonna turn me in, are you?
we're brothers. - No, stay here.
I need you. I need a taste.
my God.
don't make me do it. I will kill you if I have to.
Wade! - My God!
I had no choice. He wanted it to end this way.
you saved my life. Your Trouble, it's gone.
no one can know about any of this. Is that a mark that only I can see?
maybe that's why her Trouble spread to other people.
that is not how The Troubles work.
Yeah, but what if it's all changing?
you said yourself that agent Howard. Was a hard man to track down.
he controlled the barn and Audrey. And my adoption.
how did you find... - I was up all night.
I narrowed the list down to six families.
you, Jennifer, were born to one of them.
these families are all in Haven?
turns out you're a local.
my birth parents are here? Well, what if I've already met them by accident?
no, the question is, are you ready to meet them on purpose?
a word, brother.
I brought cabot's journal.
I need you to read it. Not now. I have to find Nathan.
he's not answering his phone. Listen, Carrie Benson's dream Trouble.
became contagious. That's never happened before.
it's a Trouble, chicken little.
I can't feel the bowl.
I can't feel the whisk, but I can feel that.
well, can you feel that?
okay, yeah.
why did we wait so long?
haven.
it's not an easy place.
at least Haven has both of us again.
and if helping The Troubles.
is what I'm supposed to do karmically...
that was a little bit of a Lexie word.
sorry, those creep in every once in a while.
it's okay.
I've grown more fond of her.
have you?
it's a little early, isn't it?
Where's Nathan?
Nathan. Where have you been?
I was just looking for Duke.
you're here for Duke, while she's up there all alone?
you agreed to execute a plan.
you're supposed to make her fall in love with you.
well, it's like the old Phil Collins song. You can't hurry love.
it's the supremes.
I'm sorry to have to rush you. Toward your own death, Nathan.
I really am, but The Troubles.
are destroying this town, and The Guard's patience is growing thin.
get Lexie to fall in love with you.
you've reached Driscoll scuba and salvage.
leave a message. - Hey, Jack, it's Duke.
listen, I-I need my bilge pump back today.
call me back.
how'd it go?
fine.
I need you to get your stuff off the Rouge.
I'm... I'm leaving town as soon as my buddy.
returns my bilge pump, so...
when are you coming back?
I'm not coming back.
well, are you really in the best emotional state to make...
look, Jennifer, I'm a businessman.
now, some of my business is above board, most of it not, but the point is.
it's all designed to benefit me.
and somehow, I've become the schmuck.
who helps everyone else, and it just needs to stop.
Yeah, but don't you think... - Please.
just get your stuff.
come on. Can't I just leave?
come on!
you okay?
911. What's your emergency? There was some kind of accident.
at the intersection of mills and lumley. At least one person injured.
make that dead.
I don't have your pump, but you don't have to destroy the place.
Jack, you all right? I'm breathing, which is more.
than I can say for this guy.
gotta be a Trouble, someone that caush tcrngs from a distance.
no, it's some kind of pressure. My ears popped.
look at this. His eardrums burst.
watch face cracked.
it's pressure-proofed to 300 feet. What... It takes a lot more pressure than that.
to shatter car glass.
this was like... Like a couple of thousand feet underwater.
Yeah, without the water.
gotta love Haven. Yeah.
say you love Haven, Duke.
Dave? You all right?
get the f-fire ants off my neck. My elbow's gonna explode.
what the hell is wrong with these two?
wait, confusion, itchy neck, joint pains.
they... they're acting funny because of the pressure. They got the bends.
I'm standing straight as an arrow. No, you're really sick.
if we don't get you treatment, you're both dead.
someone subjected the area.
to a crushing force, like being deep underwater.
it's Lexie "Do-it.
Dewitt. - Yeah.
anyway, from what I can tell, the pressure grew like a bubble, spreading outward.
now there's less pressure on the edge. And several thousand psis right around here.
cars exploded, streetlights...
no, imploded, the glass flew inward. Because of the pressure.
any closed system... a ball, or a bottle, or a car with the windows up... implodes.
so does that mean that the people, that their lungs imploded too?
well, technically speaking, it's called a lung collapse, which makes the brothers teague very lucky.
what, they survived the pressure? Remarkably, yes. They're tough old codgers.
but what got them was the decompression after the attack.
it's like when scuba divers come up too fast. The bends.
how do you treat the bends? A decompression chamber.
all right.
brought 'em down deep again.
now we just bring 'em up slowly, and give their bodies time to expel the nitrogen.
until thn, eey're drunk as skunks.
we ripped it wide open.
the micmac prophesized doom, Vincent.
what the hell are they talking about?
I never know what they're talking about.
shut up, Dave. You look like a turtle.
drag me to Haven. Convince me to stay.
offer me room on your boat.
how does this thing even float?
did you just see that horseshoe crab. With human-looking eyes?
I mean, the barnacles on them...
no, it had human eyes.
but what do you care? You just want me off your boat.
because you're bound for timbuktu. Timbuktu is landlocked, and I'm not bound anywhere until Vince and Dave are okay.
what? There was a Trouble.
we got 'em to safety, but look,
I just... I wanted to come and say that I'm...
I'm sorry about how I handled... - You're so full of crap.
do you know that? Wow, who taught you how to accept an apology?
you saved my life, Duke.
you've saved Lexie's life, Nathan's life twice, and now Vince and Dave.
am I missing anyone?
I mean, there was the little girl with the basketball, but...
you are a hero, Duke.
you're the guy who sacrifices himself for other people.
that is why I have to leave. Where have any of these sacrifices.
gotten me or this town? The chances are that little girl.
is gonna activate her Trouble next week.
and turn ten people into purple slime.
the point is...
I'm done here.
let Nathan and Lexie be heroes, and just let me be me.
is this about Lexie?
no. It isn't.
then just stay for a few days.
Why?
never mind.
okay.
well, it looks like our Troubled person.
was near old Jill Nunis here.
the pressure damage on her body.
is considerably more extensive.
actually, I'm thinking The Troubled person. Was in the car with her.
other cars imploded, like you said. The glass rained inward.
but this car's glass is all out on the road.
right, so the pressure started inside.
fresh mud on the floor.
our Troubled person was Jill Nunis's passenger.
any of the witnesses see who that was?
no, but apparently, Mrs. nunis here.
nearly ran over Vince and Dave. Moments before the pressure began.
so they probably saw our Troubled person.
go sit down. Take it easy.
watch your step.
I know I'm new to this whole Trouble thing, but this is a deep-sea pressure curse.
Jack is a deep-sea diver. Why is no one thinking of him.
as The Troubled person? Jack's a Driscoll.
no Driscoll has ever had a Trouble, going all the way back to the founding of Haven.
it's like saying that a man is pregnant.
don't you have a bilge to get?
Yeah. Jack?
and you can't, I don't know, pick up a new Trouble along the way?
no one ever has.
Driscolls and Crockers have defended Haven. For hundreds of years.
Leaving's a big decision. It's easier than you think.
at least we still have Wade.
to carry on The Crocker family tradition.
my brother has your pump.
great. I'll see you.
let him know I'm heading over there now. I don't think Aiden's up yet.
I took him out celebrating. You heard his wife's pregnant?
Yeah, I heard. Don't worry, I'll give your spot.
at the christening to Wade.
Yeah.
Hey, Duke.
God, thank you so much for helping - Vince and Dave back there. - Yeah.
Hey, Duke, hold up. Hey, you're a scuba diver, right?
we could really use your help on this case.
you know, I liked it.
so much better when you hated me.
how the hell did we get here? Get where?
I'm supposed to be the selfish one.
now all I do is put my ass on the line for the two of you.
you're supposed to be the cops who protect this town.
but lately, the only people you seem.
to be protecting are yourselves.
what just happened?
do you think he knows about us?
I don't know. He might.
and what he said...
he's not entirely wrong.
Yeah. He is.
Jill Nunis almost ran us over with her car.
we're pretty sure The Troubled person. Was in her passenger seat.
not possible. She was with Jack. The Driscolls aren't Troubled.
mud on his boots.
you were at the center of the pressure attack, but you weren't affected.
guess I got lucky.
maybe it wasn't luck.
all signs point to this being your Trouble.
what is it, April fools'?
I'm afraid not.
we think that you caused this pressure.
no, I...
no way. That's impossible.
it's happening again!
Jack, you're doing this.
we've got to get out of here.
make it stop!
Nathan! Seal me in.
everyone all right?
Yeah. - Yeah.
look at this.
2, 000 feet of pressure.
ten times deeper than most scuba dives.
no wonder people are dying.
I know we said you were immune to The Troubles.
you usually are, but physical phenomena can still hurt you.
this can't be happening.
I'm not Troubled.
my Uncle was reverend Driscoll. My family's pride is.
all about not being Troubled.
listen, we'll figure it out. I promise.
her Trouble changed. Before, it only affected the women in her family.
then she was kidnapped, and her Trouble spread all over the county.
this is what I was talking about.
shush. Jack, there was a woman recently.
whose Trouble changed.
when she was attacked by two men. Were you attacked?
I wish I could say no, but it's possible.
I- I-I passed out last night.
I was drinking with my brother Aiden, and then I woke up in a ditch.
by the side of route 4.
I- I hitched a ride into town with Mrs. Nunis.
you didn't wonder how you got there?
I've woken up in stranger places.
take off your shirt. They left a mark on their last victim.
turn around.
there it is.
it's there. Someone gave him this Trouble.
go talk to Carrie Benson.
make a sketch of her abductors.
who are these guys that can just change the rules?
and Trouble a Driscoll? I'm ready to read that journal now.
Mrs. nunis nearly ran over Vince and Dave.
it... it freaked me out. Okay, so an emotional pressure.
caused a physical pressure, but then it stopped.
what... what did you do? I used a scuba breathing technique I know.
it helps you stay calm at depth.
all right, try that again.
it's working. Hey, good, it's working. Keep going.
so as he calms down, the pressure lessens.
and the worse he feels, the more it grows.
don't think I'm gonna move too far away from this door. It's all right, you've figured out.
how to control it now.
it?
you mean my Trouble.
you'll be okay.
never in a million years.
at least they got me and not my brother.
I'm not gonna have any kids, so the curse dies with me.
Aiden's gonna be a father.
Aiden's gonna carry on the family name.
we'd better find him, make sure he's okay.
get up.
there's no sleeping here.
what am I doing here?
my God. I was abducted last night.
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, no.
my brother and I... There was these two guys.
let me guess, their names were Jim Beam and Johnnie Walker.
get moving now, or I'll have you cited.
you're not listening to me. - No.
you're not listening to me. Hey.
now I'm arresting you. - Why?
no, look, I was abducted.
come on, why?
you all right?
what's happening?
all units, officer down at founders' square. Something's happening in the park.
stop!
back up. - Why?
just do it! Gotta move back.
Hey, hey, Jack, what's going on?
I'll explain, but I need you to stand still, okay?
okay.
did two guys attack us last night?
you were there! - Listen.
these guys, they... They gave us both a Trouble.
what's happening here, you're doing it.
what?
my phone broke. - Don't move!
we'll save you!
we can't leave him like that.
it'll make him feel worse, and the worse he feels, the more the pressure bubble grows.
Yeah, but we can't get near him, either.
is there some way we could dive down to him?
you'd need a very special suit, one that I don't have.
until we figure something out, he's as alone as he would be.
at the bottom of the ocean.
Laverne, I need all available units down to founders' square.
we've got a full-scale evacuation to execute.
you got it, Nathan.
come on, Duke. Pick up.
you've reached Duke. Leave a message.
come on.
blind spot my ass.
Laverne, we need to evacuate the 300 block of elm.
I think this thing's almost at the church. We're gonna need more manpower.
as this pressure bubble grows, the area.
we need to evacuate expands exponentially.
that's the firehouse. The generator must have exploded from the pressure.
the hospital, that has a generator, too.
Yeah, a big one. If that thing goes, we're gonna lose half the town.
there's only one solution. We need Duke.
what for? - You know.
Duke has to kill me.
no, you can't start thinking like that. We already have four dead.
if that hospital goes, we're talking a lot more than that.
but what if Duke killing you. Doesn't cure Aiden's Trouble?
of course it will. That's how the Crocker curse works.
Yeah, but you and Aiden got a new Trouble. From guys who can change the rules.
I'm not just thinking about Haven. I'm thinking about Aiden's baby.
I'll take the risk.
I'll die to make sure he's not Troubled.
you come to Haven, maybe not happy, but normal at least.
and given the circumstances,
I'm moderately pleased to see you.
you're the one living Crocker
I can halfway stand to be with...
but I know.
I have to get you out of Haven so you can live.
I sacrifice, like Jennifer said.
and yet here you are, dead and still in Haven.
you see, that's the thing about this town.
in Haven, you always lose.
so why even bother trying?
damn it. Nathan, stop calling me.
Duke, it's Jack. We found Aiden.
come talk to me.
no. Look what's happening out there, Duke.
we can stop this.
I said, "No.
Hey, Duke, I don't love the idea, but we...
who are you to talk?
that man is willing to die to end one Trouble, while you... You decided that your life.
is worth more than all of The Troubles.
so don't. - Hey.
your Trouble's gone.
how?
we cleared the ambulatory patients, but moving the bed-bound is going to take.
more time than we have. Well, do whatever it takes.
I don't want anyone near the hospital.
when that generator blows.
this pressure bubble is over 14 mile across now.
I thought it would have some kind of natural ending point, but it just keeps growing.
bodies are gonna start piling up.
or you could kill me.
no. - Hey, guys.
I've looked everywhere for Duke. I can't believe he abandoned Haven.
whatever cruel God gave us The Troubles, they designed the Crocker curse exactly for this situation.
Duke's not an option.
we need another solution.
we need a deep-sea pressure suit, but I don't know where to find one.
I do.
okay.
ready? - Yeah.
don't worry, I'll be operating your suit from here.
Where'd you get these? - I know a guy.
you sure they'll work? - Hope so.
I've never worn one. I went snorkeling once.
it's hard to move.
they're made for the bottom of the ocean.
you should be getting in the pressure zone now.
Yup.
should we check on that guy?
at this pressure, he's already dead.
we're in deep now.
not funny.
Wuornos, this is topside.
I'm... I'm seeing turbulence in your air.
check your line.
no.
Wuornos, I lost your reading. My line is leaking.
I can't breathe.
get him out of there.
I'm pullin' him out.
come on, Nathan.
I can't breathe. I can't take your helmet off, either.
so let's get out of here.
Audrey, go on.
but Nathan... - I can help Nathan.
you have to get Aiden to stop this.
go.
go! We don't have a lot of time.
I can't breathe. I need air.
come on, you can make it.
come on, Nathan, a little bit further.
and we'll be outside the pressure bubble.
I know you're chokin', buddy, but you take that helmet off here and you're dead.
Aiden, I'm here to help. How can you help?
I'm doing this. - It's true.
you have a Trouble, but you know what else you have?
you have a brother and a wife, and they need you to stop this Trouble.
my friend is running out of air right now.
so listen to me, and I can help you.
ten more feet. Come on.
I heard you and your wife, you got some good news recently.
come on, Nathan. We're almost there.
we're gonna have a baby. But what does that have to do with this?
well, that baby?
that baby needs you to learn to control this.
I don't get it. A Driscoll can't have a Trouble.
okay, Nathan, we're outside the pressure.
Nathan! Just hold on a few more seconds!
some truths are hard to accept, but we have to accept them, or we hurt the people we love, the ones who need us to do it for them.
I can't breathe. Nathan, hang in there.
what do I have to do?
you have to focus and just breathe slowly.
to calm yourself, the same technique.
you learned as a diver.
you can do it.
good.
it's working.
you did it.
Yeah.
your Trouble's gone.
did you kill Wade?
I didn't have a choice.
what you said before...
do you really think Audrey should kill me?
how I feel about Audrey...
it's complicated.
but no.
I was angry.
I mean, I'm selfish, but I'm not that selfish.
that's funny.
in so many ways, you're the least selfish person I know.
funny, that's the second time I've heard that today.
who else said it? Someone a lot cuter than you.
first, you tell me to pack up and move out. When you get your precious bilge pump.
and then you call me, "Bring your things back.
God, make up your mind, businessman.
I can't stop thinking about it.
it's like you said to Aiden...
some truths are hard to accept, but people need us to do it for them.
haven needs us to do this.
I can't believe we're actually talking about this.
Jack Driscoll wanted to sacrifice himself.
to end one Trouble.
my death ends 'em all.
how can we walk away from something like that?
especially now that someone's altering the rules, putting Troubles in families that never had them.
you know what that means, right?
it means it's getting worse.
then how lucky are we.
that we can make everything better...
with one bullet?
you're supposed to help people with their Troubles.
you're meant to do it karmically, remember?
what better way than to cure them all forever?
mind if I bring your stuff back?
thank you.
I'm an idiot.
what's all this?
it belonged to my biological parents.
I went to their old house, but it turns out.
they moved away a long time ago.
the new owner gave me the stuff they left in the attic.
old family treasures?
no. Just old junk.
Jennifer. - My God.
no, no, no, no, no.
come on in, you're not interrupting anything.
sorry, Duke. Did you find your parents?
don't start with that, Dave.
start with, "Sorry we abandoned you.
you've just had a big day. Sorry we got sidetracked.
Dave got you to read whatever that is.
this is the handwritten journal of the explorer
Sebastian cabot, who spent the winter here in 1497.
with the local Micmac Indians. Yeahoh, it's a fascinating account.
I'm sure it is. Get out.
much of what he writes is accurate.
to The Troubles as we know them today.
Cabot records an ancient micmac legend, a time they considered the blackest.
in their long history.
a time of great evil and suffering.
that started when someone opened an otherworldly door.
that shouldn't have been opened. The door that Lexie came through.
you tried to stop us. - Yeah.
and you thought that when The Driscolls got Troubled, that this evil had come back.
I did, but for once, I can say I'm thrilled to be wrong.
well, mark your calendar. - How do you know you're wrong?
according to the legend, the great evil.
has specific harbingers we haven't seen...
horseshoe crabs with human eyes.
I've seen them.
what?
think of how many people died today.
Jill Nunis was married to Roger for 20 years.
they loved each other, just like us.
how can I go on living when that's the cost?
Nathan's not picking up. Yeah, I can't reach Lexie either.
those crabs confirm the soft spot. Has been ripped open.
the great evil is at hand.
an agony unlike we've ever known.
is about to arrive here in Haven.
okay, look, let's just calm down and think.
we need to tell Lexie and Nathan.
maybe Lexie learned something in the barn. About this great evil.
before she stepped through that door. Could be she knows something she doesn't even know.
she knows, you know?
does that make sense?
believe it or not, yes.
then there's Duke.
he had to kill Wade, his brother, because...
because The Troubles haven't ended, because you haven't killed me.
and his pain, the pain of everyone in this town, it's on us.
maybe you can see it the way I do?
this is the most loving thing we could possibly do.
I love you.
well, that's all it says.
great suffering, agony, evil.
Yeah, but what kind? It doesn't specify.
well, does it specify something we can do about it?
a solution to suffering beyond imagining. Would be, you know, useful.
well, the micmacs only gave cabot a riddle.
now hang on, let's... Let's see if I can find it.
what was once your salvation is now your doom.
that's it? Salvation is our doom?
what do we think's our salvation?
we think Nathan dying will end The Troubles.
that's our salvation.
but if this riddle is right, then Audrey can't kill him now.
I agree. She'd better not.
wait a minute.
why did you call her Audrey?
look out! Hey, behind you!
get out of the water! Hey, behind you!
Ron, that wasn't funny.
you're the only one who isn't laughing.
the lifeguards are going to kick you off the beach if they see you.
Yeah, whatever, Liz. - We're in Hawaii.
they have real sharks here, you idiot.
I'm off to claim my next victim.
okay, fellas, grand opening is next week.
you get to taste test my menu items.
today we got shrimp jambalaya, shrimp and grits, shrimp pupu, shrimp kabobs, shrimp fried rice.
and for the keiki's, my classic corn-battered shrimp on a stick.
okay, you know why shrimp trucks are so popular?
is because people know what they're going to get when they go to one...
they're going to get garlic scampi, hot and spicy, lemon and butter.
three flavors, not 31. But this island is crawling with competition, man.
a diverse menu can only make my product stand out in an oversaturated market.
now dig in to the grinds, and tell me what you think, please.
Jambalaya has got some kick.
try it.
you know what?
you got a cast-iron stomach, but that should be weaponized.
you got any water in there?
sparkling or flat? - Seriously, I can't breathe right now. Anything.
coming right up.
man.
I know you didn't call me here just for lunch.
so, what's on your mind, son?
I need to know why my father was meeting with Wo Fat and Governor Jameson. Okay?
I need to know what was being discussed on that video.
I told you I got the DOD working on extracting the sound.
but it's not an easy job, the audio was scrubbed.
it's been four weeks. - Yeah, well, it's the DOD, son.
nothing happens overnight.
who's your guy in digital forensics? I'll give him a call.
that won't be necessary.
just give me some more time on this. We'll have some answers soon enough.
what's cooking, Max?
one right hand of a John Doe murder vic.
approximately 30 to 40 years old.
Where's the rest of him?
the Coast Guard is dragging the shorelines of Waikiki Beach where the hand was found.
why are we tagging this guy a homicide?
this guy... it's a hand. He could be shark food.
blood had elevated levels of lead, indicating the victim was indeed shot.
the hand was then severed postmortem by something sharp enoh to cut through a bone.
most likely a boat rotor cut through a body dump.
all right, what are you doing?
we're dealing with a wet body, so after 24 hours of submersion, the skin separates from the dermis.
try to roll a print and you only get a black smudge.
but the outer layer of the skin actually maintains its ridging.
all you need is an extra set of hands and you're in business.
you're putting the guy's hand like it's a glove.
Max, that's disgusting. - Yes, but very effective.
sweet. We got a hit.
the victim's name is Blake Spencer.
okay, got a local address?
sir, we're told Blake Spencer lives here?
sure, it's the apartment above the bar. Why?
Blake Spencer was found murdered this morning.
murdered?
I don't get it. He was such a good kid.
how well did you know Blake?
Blake was a lot more than just a renter.
I considered him a friend.
you see that cutlass?
that's Royal Navy.
Blake got it off an 18th century British schooner that sank off the Antilles.
he gave it to me as a thanks for not going after him for back rent.
so Blake was a diver? - Damn good one.
best salvage diver who ever walked though my door.
salvage diving.
that's, uh, that's dangerous work.
lucrative, too. Blake found wreck sites all over the world.
had collectors lining up to buy from him.
so why's he living in an apartment above a bar?
he moved back to Hawaii after his mom got sick.
had to put her in a rest home near Waipahu.
you know, that didn't keep him out of the water though.
from what I could tell he was going after a new wreck.
he tell you what it was? - Nah.
but if Blake was interested in it, it had to be something big.
here you go. - Thank you.
Thanks.
I'll be downstairs if you need me.
lovely place.
I'll get Lori to track down the mother.
all right, what's missing here?
Oh, besides a box spring, a television, anywhere to sit, I have no idea.
Blake traveled the world diving shipwrecks, looking for hidden treasure.
don't you think he would have kept something?
he's got a sick mother to support.
maybe he had to sell everything.
or he was sinking everything into his next treasure hunt.
guy maxed out his credit card on boat and equipment rentals.
12 grand alone last month.
you know, this is generally not the kind of reading material you find under a mattress.
looks like codes and stuff.
I bet they're navigational coordinates.
Blake probably encoded them to protect his dive sites.
a lot of trouble to go through. Must be something pretty valuable.
you hear that? Listen.
you know, the treasure Blake was looking for... looks like he already found it.
Yeah, and it might have got him killed.
excuse me, Mrs. Spencer, I'm Officer Lori Weston.
is it okay if I come in and talk to you?
please, come in.
can I get you something to drink? Or eat?
no, thank you.
I have a sandwich here. My son likes one when he comes home.
your son? You mean Blake? - Yes.
he should be home any minute.
he's always so hungry after school.
Blake's still in school? - Sixth grade now.
his teachers say he's one of the smartest in his class.
do you have children? - No, ma'am. I don't.
well, you have plenty of time for that.
did you say you wanted to talk to me about something?
is something wrong, dear?
it's amazing. I mean, one day you are the king of the ocean, right?
the next thing you know, you're hanging from the ceiling in a museum and children are looking at your private parts.
Yep, kind of puts things in perspective.
excuse me.
Five-O, right? You called about the coins?
Yeah, I'm Steve McGarrett, this is Detective Williams.
Danny, please. - Hi. Dr. Gabrielle Asano.
I'm the museum's curator of historic and cultural affairs.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
very nice to meet you.
Danny. The coins?
Oh, sorry. Have...
you ever seen anything like this?
what's the matter?
as a matter of fact...
I have.
the Princesa Del Mar was a Spanish trade galleon lost at sea in 1682, after it came under cannon fire from English pirates.
these coins are from that wreck.
spanish galleon?
is it possible that something like that could have sunk in local waters?
Absolutely. The galleon's believed to have diverted here for repairs after the pirate attack.
salvage divers have been looking for the wreck for years.
right, so what you're saying is, whoever recovered these coins may actually have found the Princesa?
pirate ships and cannonballs and treasure.
I thought this stuff only happened in movies.
I can assure you the treasure is very real.
and very valuable.
valuable? How, uh, how much are we talking about?
on the collectible market, the coins would fetch maybe a couple thousand... each.
and the Princesa was believed to be carrying several tons of them.
that's a lot of money. - That's a lot of motive.
gentlemen, would you mind if I held on to these for a while?
on behalf of the museum, I'd like to authenticate them.
I'm sorry, but these coins are actually evidence in a murder investigation.
Yeah, but... I'm thinking it won't hurt to just give her one little coin.
go ahead. It's fine.
it's just one coin. Why are you losing your mind?
I'm not losing my mind.
if you want to ask her out, ask her out. I'm just saying.
who said anything about asking her out?
come on. You left Dr. Asano a coin so you have a reason to go back and see her. It's fine.
uh, that's not true.
I left her a coin because she might be able to help with our investigation.
Really? You know what you should do?
you should ask her out for coffee.
I don't want... I'm not... I'm not looking for a relationship.
coffee's not a relationship. It's a beverage.
that's not true. Every single relationship starts with a cup of coffee.
then it's dinner and a movie. Okay?
next thing you know, you're divorced, you're moving to Hawaii so you can see your daughter every other weekend.
you need to talk to somebody professionally.
okay? I do.
you. And now the session's over.
no, the session's not over, Danny.
you need to get back on the horse, and a cup of coffee's a good place to start.
what are we doing? - Need to make a stop. Just wait here.
Hi, Cat.
thank you for meeting me. - Yeah.
got that for you. - Oh, look at that.
thank you.
what do you need this time?
what do you make of this?
our victim was a wreck diver, and we think that he may have been killed at one of his dive sites.
okay, well, if you're right about these being coordinates, then the cipher should be easy to crack.
I'll run cryptography and let you know what I find. - Mahalo.
see, this is usually the part where, you know, you ask me out to dinner as a thank you.
Oh, no... absolutely. Anywhere you want, okay?
but before you decide, I,uh...
I need to ask you one more favor.
Sasabune, omakase menu.
Yeah. Now, what's the favor? - Fine.
you remember Joe White? - Your old commander?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh, I heard he's overseeing SEAL Team training at Pearl now.
Yeah, he is.
look, he submitted a piece of intel for analysis, okay?
it's a video I'm trying to pull sound from.
DOD has been sitting on it for weeks now.
I just... I was hoping you could check the status for me.
look, if the request came from Joe, I'm sure it's being handled.
could you just check for me, please?
do you think someone at DOD is giving you the runaround?
I don't know. I don't know what's going on.
Yeah. Okay.
good timing.
the Coast Guard just recovered the rest of Blake Spencer's body at sea.
Max found traces of helium in the lung tissue.
so we know Blake was killed right after a mixed gas dive, which means deep water.
exactly. And check this out.
he still had his dive bag on him.
what is that? There's something in there.
I had everything sent to the crime lab for analysis.
I'm heading over there now.
hopefully, whatever's inside that bag could lead us to our killer.
good.
Hey. Did you get anything from the mother?
not exactly.
how'd she take it? - I didn't tell her.
what? What are you talking about? Why not?
the woman's suffering from Alzheimer's. She thinks Blake's 11 years old.
there's no way she'd be able to process it.
uh, how'd the museum work out?
how'd it go, Danny? How was the museum?
enough, okay? Turns out that our victim uncovered a major shipwreck.
so we're thinking that somebody got hip to what he was doing, followed him out to the site and killed him.
we need to find out who else knew about that treasure.
an old wallet?
it's the only thing I found in the dive bag.
and last I checked, 17th century pirates didn't carry leather wallets made in New York City.
right. So it belonged to Blake?
I don't think so. But based on the oxidation,
I'd say this thing was submerged for at least 50 years.
I may be able to date it more accurately once I'm done processing these.
wow, there was money inside it.
the wallet prevented the bills from deteriorating completely, but the ink is mostly gone.
either way, he didn't get this off the Princesa.
all right, so he could have been diving another wreck when he was killed.
I'll let you know when I'm done processing.
Yeah, thanks, Charlie.
Hey. Um, I need a favor.
this is my activity log for the HPD database.
the login that's circled here was made from an IP address that I don't recognize.
now, I managed to back-trace it through a couple of proxies, but I can't get past a VPN.
can you help?
chin, if someone hacked into your account, you need to notify the department.
I will...if the threat's legit.
okay. I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
thanks for the beer.
thanks for nothing.
can I buy you a drink?
seen you making the rounds.
you a cop? - Lori Weston, Five-O.
Jimmy Koller. - Nice to meet you, Jimmy Koller.
well, that's an interesting ring. What is that, white gold or something?
oxidized silver. Got it off the HMS Pegasus.
right. Thought you might be a diver.
you... by any chance, you know a Blake Spencer?
as well as the next guy.
Blake mostly kept to himself, but I heard he was a real pro.
you hear anything about him diving the Princesa Del Mar?
no.
but I know a guy who's been hunting the Princesa for years.
sunk a lot of money into finding her, too.
and who might that be?
I'm Jesse Billings, president of Voyager Marine, the world leader in deep water shipwreck exploration.
today, I'm going to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in what just may be the greatest treasure hunt of all time.
for the past two years, Billings has been pitching investors on the hunt for the Princesa.
he's already sold millions in shares.
which means he had a lot to lose if someone found the wreck before he did.
at Voyager Marine, - This is Detective Williams.
our world-class team of researchers, technicians and divers search the oceans for treasures once thought lost forever.
here's what I don't get...
with all the resources that Jesse had, how was Blake able to beat him to the Princesa?
that's how. That's our dead diver.
Blake worked for Jesse Billings.
so he didn't diover the Princesa; he stole the coins from his boss.
Yeah, and you know what? I bet Jesse was pretty upset when he found out about it.
thank you.
um, only one problem with that theory.
just got off the phone with Dr. Asano from the Bishop Museum.
the coins we found in Blake's apartment are fake.
you think I killed Blake Spencer.
he's a mind reader. - Yes, that's what we think.
why would I kill my best diver?
I'll tell you why...
because Blake found out that the treasure hunt you hired him for was a scam.
why don't you take a look at this photo?
where did you get these?
we found those in Blake's apartment.
those coins are about as real as your tan.
you know what? I bet you haven't even dipped a toe in the water in years.
but I have to commend you on a somewhat elaborate scam.
it's pretty good... you dump a bunch of fake coins in the ocean to convince your investors that you have found the Princesa Del Mar.
but you didn't find the Princesa, did you?
and Blake realized the coins were fakes, and that's why he took them.
and you knew he was going to open his mouth about it, so you had to kill him.
I've, uh...
I've salted a few shipwrecks... I admit that...
but I had no idea Blake knew it.
I swear.
got some news on those bills. - Great.
what is it?
I traced that IP address you gave me.
that login was made from a home computer.
okay. Do we know the owner?
Yeah. It was Kono.
Kono was dismissed from the force.
what's she doing using your password to access HPD files?
you know what? That was me.
I was at Kono's house that day.
I used her computer to check up on some case work.
Thanks. - Right.
so what do we know about those bills?
took some work, but I was able to piece together one of them.
what is that, a five? - Good eye.
it's pretty faded, but there's still some ink there.
and wait till you see this.
the Hawaiian overprint note, issued in 1942.
after Pearl Harbor, the decision was made to pull all the paper money on the Islands and destroy it, replacing it with this.
Why? - Because, had the Japanese invaded Hawaii, they would have been able to seize huge sums of U. S. currency.
but this way, the Federal Reserve just declares the Hawaii-stamped bills worthless.
problem solved.
of course, the invasion never happened.
when the war ended, the overprint notes were recalled.
okay. How did Blake get this?
not from the Princesa.
he must have been diving another wreck.
if that wallet was underwater for 50 years, he may have been salvaging a ship that sunk during World War II.
okay, hang on a second.
Catherine decrypted the coordinates from Blake's notebook.
look where they fall.
it's a straight line from Oahu to Maui.
his wreck must have sunk along a ferry or shipping route.
that's a lot of ground to cover.
and Blake could have been killed at any one of these sites.
I may know how to find which one.
according to Blake's credit card company, he rented one of your salvage boats.
Yeah. Most of my business is wreck divers.
Blake wasn't due back until tomorrow.
did he say where he planned on diving?
I didn't ask, and he wouldn't have told me if I had.
Blake didn't talk to anybody about his work.
okay, Mr. Julian, that boat is now a crime scene, so you think you can help us find where it is?
all my renls are equipped with trackinsystems.
St aecond. I'll pull it up.
OK, perfect. - Great.
is he a pblem?
Thtranspder on his boat isn't working. Must be busted.
or Bke disled it because he didn't want anyone followingim his de site.
okay, listen to me. Give me the tags and a description the boat.
okay, if Blake's killers haven't sunk the boat, it's got to still be out there somewhere, right?
so let me ask you a question.
if a woman leaves the relationship status on her profile page empty, does that generally mean Mm-hmm. that she is single or that she is taken?
is this about the hot doctor from the museum?
I mean, you should ask her out.
what, he... he talked to you about this?
what, are we in high school?
no, we're not, but... - Hey, guys.
coast Guard just called. They found Blake's boat 40 miles east of Oahu.
pilot says it is not moving with the currents.
even I know what that means. Means the boat is anchored.
that's right.
so the site Blake was diving must be right below it.
Yeah, there's only one way to find out.
those are deep waters.
you'd be crazy to dive that by yourself.
Yeah, I would. That's why I'm taking a partner.
partner?
Steve, glad you called.
chin, it's not a good time.
I want to know why you were using my password to access HPD records.
I wanted to see my case file.
Why?
cause I want to know what they have on me.
see if there's any chance of me ever getting my badge back.
you could have just asked me.
you just g reinstated a month ago.
last thing I want to do is cause you any trouble.
you shouldn't even be here.
what the hell is he doing here?
lieutenant Kelly.
it's nice to see you got your badge back.
Yeah, some of us, we weren't so lucky.
you got ten seconds to turn around and go back to your car, Ray.
you want me to leave, Kono? - No.
Bye-bye.
good ol' cousin Chin.
he's back with Five-O, that right? - Yeah.
and, uh, you used his password to get me those HPD files?
I can't decide whether that was really resourceful... or incredibly stupid.
look, Frank, you came to me for access, I got you access.
chin won't be a problem. I'll make sure of it.
you better.
your cousin starts poking his nose where it doesn't belong, that's gonna be a problem for all of us.
I might not handle it as delicately as you.
we got blood.
gunshot spatter and a pool here where Blake must have dropped.
why right here?
could have set up while Blake was diving, and popped him right when he got out of the water.
got a slug here.
nine mil.
all right, check out this trajectory.
shooter had to be on the boat for this to line up.
which means he either forced his way on or...
or Blake trusted him enough to have him on board.
so, uh, you hear anything back from the DOD about that surveillance video yet?
still no word.
what?
I just can't shake this feeling there's something you're n telling me, Joe.
well, try harder 'cause when we break 150 feet and the narcosis sets in, you're gonna have enough trouble keeping your head straight without those thoughts bouncing around in it. Understand?
Yeah. Okay.
I splash first. We're gonna follow the anchor line down.
stay close, stay focused.
now let's go see what Blake found.
Yes. sir.
Max, you need a hand?
Oh, thank you, but it is against protocol for anyone but the ME to handle the remains.
no, no, I don't want to help. There's actually a hand right there if you want, if you need a hand.
Ah, that was very humorous.
Hey, guys, so the car is a late 1930's Packard model ambulance, military issue.
so, this guy could have been a soldier?
I don't know. Max?
well, I can't answer that.
but I can tell you that we have a full skeleton here.
it's male, roughly six feet tall.
as for the COD, well, it wasn't anything nefarious.
just a few broken bones.
any chance we can get an ID on him?
teeth are intact, however, if he is as old as the car that we found him in, then most likely we don't have dental records that go that far back.
so ID'ing him would be a long shot.
we could always take him to JPAC.
they got X-rays and records going all the way back to the '30s.
so if this guy served, he's probably in the system.
let's hope so. Blake died salvaging this car.
we need to find out why it was worth killing for.
okay. Bag him up, kid.
you're going with. - Yes!
did you know that JPAC is the largest forensic lab in the world, and that it specializes exclusively in postmortem identification?
which, incidentally, is my favorite type of identification.
you need a paper bag or something?
Oh, sorry. It's just this place is like my Graceland.
okay.
but no souvenirs.
gentlemen. Hi, I'm Dr. Tallridge, Scientific Director.
Max, welcome to JPAC.
um, why don't we find a lab table and see what you got here.
all right, I researched archives for the Advertiser and The Maui News.
went all the way back to 1938.
no articles mentioning anything about a car lost at sea.
I found something with Naval History and Heritage Command.
these guys, they keep records of every incident report ever filed.
this was dated July 19, 1942.
a Navy transport vessel was delivering supplies to Maui when a big storm hit, sending some of the cargo overboard.
including a 1939 Army ambulance. You found it.
I did find it, but it doesn't explain why Blake was salvaging that car. I don't get it.
maybe there's something valuable inside.
no, I mean, according to this report, the ambulance was transporting a body for burial.
the deceased was a Captain Robert S. Murphy.
you think those were his remains inside? - I don't know.
I mean, there were bones in the front seat. There was no casket in the back.
wait a minute.
I've seen this guy before.
I was just a little girl when my father died.
we were living in Maui, he was stationed at Pearl.
after the attack, it took a few days until we heard that he'd been killed.
dad was supposed to have been buried in the family plot, but...
but he never made it home.
not knowing where he was, it always haunted my mother.
haunted the rest of us, too.
Mrs. Spencer, I'm... I'm so very sorry.
no family should ever have to suffer through something like that.
you've served, haven't you? - Yes, ma'am, Navy.
I can tell. You have that look about you.
my son Blake wants to be a sailor when he grows up.
I can't keep that boy out of the water.
Mrs. Spencer...
about Blake... - Mrs. Spencer, thank you.
we'll, uh, we'll be on our way.
but she still doesn't know about Blake.
better to tell her when we have answers.
he was looking for his grandfather.
that's why finding that ambulance was so important to him.
he wanted to give his mother some closure by finally bringing home the body.
Yeah, I understand why it was important to Blake, but why would somebody kill him for it?
Joe, go ahead. -Steve, we got a match on those remains.
all right, did it come back to a Captain Robert Murphy? - No.
docs ID'd our man as Private Miles Brodic.
he served with the 27th Infantry out of Schofield.
beyond that, I can't tell you much about him because his file has been classified for nearly 70 years.
well, let's get it declassified.
a few months into his enlistment,
private Miles Brodic faced a court-martial on multiple charges of petty theft.
he was dishonorably discharged in May of '41.
after his discharge, Brodic took a job at Kealani Cemetery.
he was there when the bombs dropped on Pearl.
he was also there when the government issued the order to recall all the paper money on the islands and replace it with the Hawaiian overprint note.
sorry, I don't understand.
Lori, Kealani Cemetery is where all the recalled money was sent to be destroyed.
they burned over a hundred million dollars of it at the crematorium there.
actually, not all the money was destroyed.
according to the military, $2 million was siphoned off by someone with inside access.
by the time the MPs got wind of it, Brodic was long gone.
anybody want to guess how he snuck the loot off the island?
robert Murphy's casket.
Brodic knew it was going to Maui, so he stashed his money inside of it.
explains why somebody would shoot Blake over it.
that money is still valid currency.
so we find that casket, we find our killer.
anybody want some shrimp mochi for dessert?
that's, uh, shrimp-flavored ice cream?
huh, that's, that's interesting.
I'm full. - Yeah, I'm good, too, but thank you.
shoots. I'll just leave the bill.
I'll settle up with the big man.
Thanks, Joe. You guys are gonna want to see this.
you remember Remo Julian? - Yeah.
isn't that the charter operator that Blake rented his boat from?
he's also a very accomplished liar.
crime lab just finished processing the boat.
they found the transponder intact and fully functional.
okay, so Remo was playing with us when he said it was malfunctioning.
it gets better. I hacked into his system, pulled the navigational logs for his entire fleet.
turns out there were two boats at Blake's dive sites the night that he was killed.
Remo tracked Blake out there.
Remo Julian! Five-O!
clear. - Clear.
I checked the rest of the floor. Remo's gone.
I think I found Captain Murphy, our vic's grandfather.
Remo took the money and tossed the bones aside like trash.
looks like he left in a hurry, too.
all right, so that's how he dried the cash, right?
guys, I got fresh blood on this bill.
this could mean we have another victim.
take a look at this coffin.
looks like it could have been in our sunken ambulance.
doesn't look like Remo Julian will be giving us any answers.
looks like COD was blunt-force trauma to the head.
victim also shows signs of defensive wounds on his arms and his neck.
that's peculiar.
What'd you got? - Subdermal bruising.
looks like the fatal blow left an indentation on the victim's skull.
and it looks like our killer wears a very unique ring.
take a look at this.
that's the crest of the HMS Pegasus.
how did you know that?
because I met Remo's killer.
Jimmy Koller.
that's an interesting ring. What is that?
move in.
okay, listen, there's a tiny, tiny chance that you're going to get out before your 90th birthday.
but that window of opportunity is closing rapidly, you understand?
okay, window's closed. Thanks.
wait.
Blake radioed Remo from the wreck site.
said he needed a winch and a couple guys to help dredge something up.
right,'cause not often you find a casket at the bottom of the ocean.
especially one with $2 million in it.
all right, so how long before you and Remo turned on Blake?
Hey, Remo and I were willing to split the money three ways, but Blake gave us some line that the bones belonged to his grandfather.
he was just trying to cut us out.
so you killed him.
then you killed Remo so you could take the whole $2 million to yourself, right?
no honor among thieves.
Blake wasn't lying.
he didn't care about the money. And that really was his grandfather.
he just wanted to bury the man, put the past behind him.
family plot's still in Maui. VA's making arrangements to send the remains there for burial.
all right. Did you notify the family?
not yet. I wanted Sylvia to hear it from me.
you going to tell her about Blake, too?
she needs to understand her son didn't die for nothing.
because of what he did, her father can finally be laid to rest.
small consolation, I know.
it's times like these, all the little things help, don't they? - Yeah.
listen, Lori, I can make the notification if you want.
Hey, thanks. No. I need to do this on my own.
it's not the first time I've had to tell a parent they lost a child.
I just... hoped I'd never have to do it again.
who's that?
that is an old friend.
excuse me a second. - Okay.
uh, dinner's not until 8: 00, and you... I think you may be a little overdressed.
actually, I'm going to need to ask for a rain check. - Okay.
orders came in today, and I'm being sent T. A.D. to NAVCENT.
my flight for the Gulf leaves tonight.
tonight? - Yeah.
Yeah. So...
anyway, um, before I left, I just wanted to get back to you - about that thing that you asked me about. - Yeah.
I checked with the DOD, and they said that they haven't received any intel requests from Commander White.
you sure about that? - Yeah.
I'm so sorry.
I should probably go pack.
Yeah, listen, um, Catherine, uh, about this rain check, uh...
you're...you're probably gonna get some leave in the next few months.
why don't we meet somewhere halfway? I don't know.
mumbai or something?
I like Indian food.
I know, but if your mom catches you up this late, she's gonna kill us both, okay?
go to bed, all right?
and I'm gonna see you really soon, and I can't wait, 'cause I'm gonna kiss you all over your little monkey face, okay?
all right.
Yeah, Danno loves you, too, baby.
all right.
okay.
detective Williams.
what are you doing here?
uh, well, it's a nice night, and I was wondering if you'd like to get a cup of coffee with me.
I would like that.
chin, I'm really not up for a lecture right now.
good, because I'm not here to give you one.
I'm here to apologize.
everything you're going through right now I've been through myself.
getting kicked off the force, dealing with disappointment, the frustration, the anger.
I remember what that felt like.
and I also remember that the only person who stood by me through all of it was you.
you're not alone in this, Kono.
when you want to talk, I'll be here.
you never gave that video to the DOD, did you, Joe?
no.
you know what?
I know he was your friend, but he was my father.
whatever it is you're trying to protect me from, I can handle it, you understand me?
did you ever think that maybe you're not the only one I'm trying to protect?
what are you talking about?
risk versus reward, Steve.
how much damage are you willing to do to your family, to your family's name?
cause whatever's on that video is not going to bring your father back.
I need to know.
the limu lipoa is actually a type of seaweed.
in fact, the waters of Waikiki feature over 200 species of marine plants.
the black stuff on the ocean floor is coral, and the white stuff...well, that's sand.
coming up on the port side, you'll see...
just make sure you CC Legal on that memo.
no, I said CC Legal.
mom, look!
the rocks are so fuzzy!
I'm going to have to call you back. I'm on a submarine.
mom, it's Nemo.
that fish looks like Nemo.
one sec.
mom... A mermaid!
a mermaid!
Oh, my God.
coast Guard, Coast Guard, this is the submarine Atlantis.
we've got the body of...
good morning, Lieutenant.
good morning, Commander.
you know, uh...
I think I owe you dinner. - Yeah.
somehow we just never... quite... make it to dinner.
we had dinner in Coronado.
no. We had reservations...
you know we, uh, both have the day off today.
we could have breakfast on the beach.
or...
I think I'm vibrating.
no, I...I think I'm actually vibrating.
there goes your day off.
there's something different about you today.
you, uh, you get a new haircut? - No.
new cargo pants?
what was that? - What?
I believe you just smiled!
you-you almost appear to be happy.
you don't think I'm a happy person?
you know...ha...you know, I'm sure you have your moments, you know, like when Guns & Ammo puts out their holiday gift guide, or a Rambo retrospective comes on TV.
but when the governor calls us down to the ME's office on a Saturday,
I ask you: what is it that you could be so happy about?
Oh, you had Grace this weekend.
Yeah. I just dropped her back off at Rachel's.
so just to recap: I got a broken knee, I got a daughter I barely get to see, now I work on Saturdays, okay?
so, life's grand, know what I mean?
it's good.
gentlemen, thank you for coming. - Governor.
an 18-year-old girl's body was found off Waikiki this morning.
that's HPD's jurisdiction.
not this time.
Oh, that's right. You haven't met Dr. Bergman yet.
Max is a tactile thinker.
playing music is part of his process.
some people say he's a savant.
I think he's a genius.
trust me.
edematous airways.
nice to meet you, too.
the victim exhibited pulmonary edema, petechial hemorrhaging, and froth in the airways.
cause of death is definitely drowning.
does that mean we're not dealing with a homicide?
no. It doesn't mean we're not dealing with a homicide.
Oh, sorry. That was a double negative.
it means, it still could be a homicide.
see these linear contusions on her wrists? They're antemortem.
ligature marks. Mean she was restrained.
that's right. She has defensive wounds as well.
so she put up a fight.
Yes.
also, hello.
I'm Max Bergman.
Hello, Max.
Yeah, hi, Max.
uh, Governor, do we have an ID on the victim?
her name is Amanda Reeves.
her father's Michael Reeves, the U. S. Ambassador to the Philippines, and a very old friend.
which is why I promised I'd put my two best people on it.
okay, uh... What are they doing in Hawaii?
they vacation here every year.
- Thanks, Al.
um... The, uh... girls went to a movie last night, but they never made it home.
I'm sorry, you said girls?
uh, as in more than one?
sorry. A...Amanda's sister, Robin, is still missing.
the Coast Guard sent out divers this morning, but, uh... there's no sign of her.
so Robin Reeves may still be alive.
always wanted Amanda and Robin to have a normal upbringing, but it hasn't been easy.
so they were stationed with you at the Embassy in Manila?
Yeah. For the last two years.
before that, it was, uh, Budapest.
keeping the family together has always been... important to us.
Yeah. Of course, growing up in foreign countries with a security detail shadowing your every move is not exactly an ideal childhood.
did they, by chance, have a detail with them when they went out last night?
well, in the Philippines it's one thing, but we've been coming to Hawaii since the girls were little.
I guess we just didn't think it was necessary.
they were just going to the movies.
don't blame yourself. We're going to find Robin.
we are. We are. I promise.
that's quite a bit of firepower.
it's a Kimber 1911.
I prefer something with a little more kick.
not exactly diplomatic security standard issue.
which would make you... - Russell Ellison, security consultant.
I specialize in VIP and corporate protection.
in light of what happened to Ambassador Reeves, he called me in to bolster his detail.
so when did you get into town?
this morning.
and if you don't mind, I have a lot of work to do.
Aloha.
you know, it's possible that your daughters were targeted because of your ambassadorship.
did you make any enemies during your time abroad?
I'm a representative of the United States in an unstable region of the world.
it comes with the territory.
how about in the Philippines itself?
the U. S. gives a lot of aid to that country.
most of the population is grateful for our assistance.
Yeah, but not everybody appreciates the help.
I mean, there's always radical elements who resent our presence.
Michael, did any of them ever threaten you?
office receives dozens of threats.
the security bureau keeps all of that on file.
Mrs. Reeves, you were a founding partner in Sowersby Financial.
is it true that you recently sold your stake in that company?
Yes, but how is that relevant?
well, because, ma'am, you just cashed out of Sowersby for over $12 million.
if we have that information, it's safe to assume that other people do, too.
What...? Are you saying Amanda's dead 'cause I have money?
I'm sorry, uh, ma'am, these high-profile cases are usually about money.
then how come there hasn't been a ransom demand?
I don't know.
um... Steve had to leave for work, and he told me I should just let myself out, so...
um... You must be... - The sister.
Yeah. I'm Mary. I'm just visiting from L. A.
big night last night. - Hmm?
old house. Thin walls.
Oh, God!
Yeah. You said that a lot.
it's embarrassing. - Don't sweat it.
I just broke up with my boyfriend, so I plan on having a lot of guys over soon.
so it'll be a fair fight.
checked with State.
no credible threats against the ambassador in the last three months.
okay, so this doesn't add up...why kill one girl and keep the other one alive?
well, if it's a ransom attempt, it could be to show that they mean business.
HPD has a unit at the house. Still no ransom call.
so we got no motive.
okay, so we focus on how the girls were abducted.
75% of kidnappings are usually carried out by people the victims already knew.
we ran a background check on the ambassador's staff, and everyone seems clean.
what about the new guy?
that security consultant, Russell Ellison.
his story checks out.
ambassador just flew him in from the mainland, and, uh, his plane touched down after the girls were abducted.
McGarrett.
on our way.
let's go, big guy.
just got back the toxicology report.
the victim had benzodiazepine in her blood.
you may be more familiar with its street name - "roofies."
Yeah, it's a date rape drug.
Yeah, it's not that often a girl gets roofied at the movies.
you could have told us this on the phone.
I don't trust phones.
okay.
uh, Kono said that the daughters had a reputation for being, uh, party girls.
do you have a black light?
it's called an ALS wand.
and I don't like people touching my equipment.
can I just have the wand, please?
fine.
Zephyr Lounge.
it's a nightclub.
just sent us a link to remotely access their closed-circuit feeds.
that's really good. It's impressive. Did you learn that in SEAL school?
Yeah, it's called using the Internet.
people have been doing it since the early '90s. You may have heard of it.
I wouldn't know. I was still playing Ms. Pac-Man.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
ever make it to the double pretzel level?
triple banana, bitch.
you're a liar. - No, I'm not.
all right, give me last night's front door and start at midnight and roll backwards.
right there. Right there. Okay, roll forward.
there you go. Zoom right here.
what's that look like to you?
like two blonde victims and a creepy guy.
got him.
you boys on the list?
Yeah. Uh, VIP.
you know this guy?
Yeah. He's inside.
two Longboards.
what are you doing? Breaking for beers?
this guy's just abducted two girls.
his radar is going to be up. He sees us before we see him, he's going to bolt.
so let's just have a couple of beers, get eyes on the place and relax.
this place has got eyes on you.
would you focus, please?
just... just once. Just focus. - Okay, wait a minute.
let me ask you a question. - Go ahead.
two very attractive ladies are eye humping you...uh, respectably...and...and what, nothing?
nothing? I mean, what, should I check for a pulse?
you alive? Hello.
what is that? What is that smile? What smile?
that stupid smile.
what is it with you today? Huh?
you're imagining things. - Oh, I'm imagining things.
that's right.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
some detective I am.
you got into some Barry White last night, didn't you? Huh?
am I right or am I right?
you're very perceptive. Thank you.
take a look at Casanova over there - 6: 00.
that's our boy.
let me tell you what I'd like to do.
if that was my daughter, I would bust every single one of his fingers one at a time.
Oh, God. Thank you for the excuse.
excuse me. Excuse me.
put the drink down.
it's time for you to go to the bathroom.
dude. Who do you think you are? Huh?
what's that? Who do I think I am?
I think I might be a guy who just saw another guy put something in a lady's drink.
I don't know what you're talking about. - You don't?
I didn't put anything in her drink.
you didn't put anything... Then, drink it.
what?
drink it. Come here.
drink... listen to me.
drink that drink, or I'm going to bust your teeth and pour it down your throat, okay?
I would drink it.
let me help you. Come on. Down the hatch.
big swallow. Big swallow.
good job. Okay, let's go.
Robin Reeves. What'd you do with her?
what?
great. Now he's deaf.
where is she? Where is Robin Reeves?
murder? - Yeah.
what are you talking about?
well, they found Amanda Reeves' body this morning.
I didn't kill that girl.
no? Well, you better know who did, then.
okay. Okay.
I did slip those girls a roof last night.
why those girls? Why'd you pick them?
I just did what I was told.
but they were alive when I handed them off to Kang.
who's Kang?
the one who set me up with the job.
said he'd give me five grand for every girl I brought him.
what does he do with the girls?
I get paid to supply the girls, not to ask questions.
okay, so how do we find Kang?
I don't know, honestly. I... He never even told me his last name.
I don't even know his phone number.
how do you deliver the girls to Kang?
how does that happen?
he leaves a van parked in one of the lots.
okay, go on.
I put the girls in the back, take the van to Ala Wai, and I park it by the canal.
the next day, it's back in the parking lot with five grand in the glove box and instructions for the next drop-off.
so that girl you were going to drug tonight is she your next delivery?
Yeah. Yeah.
I was... supposed to get her there by 1: 00.
that's less than an hour.
hang tight, Kono.
we'll be right behind you.
Bravo team, target's turning southeast on Kuhio.
copy that.
Kuhio Avenue...it's a red-light district at night.
Yeah, sex trade, kidnapped girls.
it's got to be forced prostitution.
Yeah.
teenagers like Amanda and Robin are prime targets.
you know, Tamara, the Hawaii Chair wasn't designed just for home.
I mean, after all, for some of us, at least 40 hours of our week is spent sitting behind a desk at the office.
so, to see what office workers think of the Hawaii Chair, we sent Erin Lee to work.
I'm Erin Lee with... - Seriously?
sitting?
that's a workout?
let's get some first-time reactions.
Oh, my gosh. This is amazing.
that feels great on my abs.
I can really feel this working.
Oh, my God! Make it stop!
...using the computer, balancing books or filing paperwork.
you can hardly call this work.
with the Hawaii Chair, it takes the work out of your workday.
come on. You don't have batteries?
how do you power your night vision goggles?
it's not the best time, Mare.
why are there pictures of burned corpses in the study?
what are you talking about?
I found this tool kit, and it has all this weird stuff in it, like a tape recorder, crime scene photos and some... postcards from Japan.
put the box back, okay? It's evidence.
evidence of what?
something Dad was investigating. A case he was working on. He wanted me to find it.
Why?
Mary, please... do me a favor and just put the box back for now, okay?
okay, okay, I will.
tell me you're putting the box back.
relax.
I will.
thank you. - Bye.
everything okay? - Probably not.
what happened to the music?
party's inside.
let's go.
Kono, try and get a 20 on Robin.
okay.
close quarters with an unknown number of hostiles.
Robin Reeves is not the only girl in there, so watch your crossfire, okay?
we also have a UC in there.
five-nine, local girl, black top, black hot pants.
she's one of ours, so look sharp.
excellent skin.
bone structure very good.
strong, too. You'll be a good earner.
all right, I've heard enough.
hold tight, we're coming in.
go.
Five-0! show me your hands.
on the ground before I put you there.
on the ground!
Freeze! Right there!
building's secure.
Where's Robin? - She's not here.
Robin Reeves,where is she?
I never see that girl.
well, seeing as you're not even bothering to look, maybe you'll remember that she was with her sister Amanda, and maybe you'll want to know that she's dead now.
I want you read my Miranda right now.
preferably in Chinese.
my English not so good.
what you do... What you doing? What you doing?
No! Give me!
sit down! - Give me!
shut up.
give us a minute.
Yeah, sure.
she ordered the kidnapping of the Reeves sisters, but it wasn't for the prostitution ring.
she tell you where Robin is? - Doesn't know.
according to her, the Reeves girls never even passed through here.
a private buyer paid her 50, 000 to abduct them and hand them over.
said the kidnapping was a freelance job.
so it had nothing to do with sex trade.
someone was targeting them specifically.
you get a name on a buyer?
all she had was the phone number she used to communicate with the guy.
said she was paid by wire.
this will help. - How'd you get her to talk?
told her the dog would be put down once she went to lockup.
promised I'd find it a home. If she cooperated.
what?
it's not like it's the dog's fault.
so I ran the phone number on our private buyer.
turns out, the calls were made from a disposable cell phone.
which is untraceable. - That's right.
but I was able to pull the call logs.
and get this: since the Reeves sisters went missing, three calls were placed from that cell phone to the ambassador's private number.
so you think that he's somehow involved in his own daughter's disappearance?
no. No, this is a kidnap and ransom.
Yeah, they're calling the ambassador to make demands.
that's why he brought Ellison in after the girls went missing.
ellison, the security consultant.
I will bet you he's not a security consultant.
that guy is a K&R specialist.
what's K&R? - Kidnap and ransom.
it's a type of insurance.
look, if the policyholder gets abducted, the company comes in, they pay the ransom and they supervise the exchange with the kidnappers.
and these guys got a tendency to obstruct police investigations.
so, if Ellison is handling the drop, that explains why the ambassador lied to us.
is your husband home?
we, uh, we need to have a word.
no, I... he had to step out for a meeting.
with Mr. Ellison?
I don't know.
what's going on?
Mrs. Reeves, we know that the kidnappers have been in communication with your husband.
he hired Russell Ellison to broker the deal, isn't that right?
Sarah. Sarah, if you know something, you have to tell them.
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
last call came in an hour ago, and the man on the end said that if we paid the money, we'd get Robin back.
okay, so your husband and Ellison have gone to pay the ransom?
please, I just want my daughter back.
as soon as the kidnappers made contact, Michael called Mr. Ellison.
he flew in with the money.
he monitored all the calls.
he told Michael exactly what to do and say.
did your husband say where the transaction was taking place?
no, no. Mr. Ellison wouldn't let him give me any details.
did Ellison ask you to lie?
he said involving the police would only put Robin in more danger.
excuse me.
yeah?
I just traced the money trail for that private buyer who paid for the abduction of the Reeves sisters.
the payment was wired from a bank in the Philippines.
the account belongs to a Carlos Bagoyo.
known member of the National Liberation Front, operational in rural Luzon.
they bombed a military base there in '08.
lately they've taken to targeting U. S. troops within the country.
of course they have.
because we support the democratically-elected government that keeps them out of power.
doesn't sound like they'd be interested in a ransom.
they're not. They didn't kidnap his daughters for money, this is political.
if they're targeting the ambassador, he must have something they want.
Yeah. And he just dropped his security detail to go meet with them.
listen, all the cars in the DSB motor pool have vehicle transponders, okay?
I need a location on the car the ambassador left in.
government plates. It's him.
tires are still warm. They can't have gone too far.
ellison probably sent the ambassador in solo to make the swap, but he'll be nearby monitoring with a tac team to make sure it doesn't bad.
and you know what?
I may have a way to figure out where he's running surveillance from.
Yeah, I figured you would.
you're gonna like this.
was wondering when you were gonna call.
you get in late last night?
I actually haven't been home yet.
interesting.
no, no, it's not what it sounds like. I caught a high-priority case.
okay, why am I getting the feeling that you're about to ask me for another favor?
listen, I'll make it up to you, all right?
we'll finally get that dinner, and you'll get to taste the best steak on the island.
who you talking to?
all right, you got yourself a deal.
what do you need?
pacom has a satellite dedicated to Honolulu harbor.
can you use it to run a scan on radio traffic?
Yeah, what am I looking for?
uh, spread spectrum signal in the 400 MHz range.
type used by high-end surveillance gear.
all right, one sec.
Thanks, Cath.
Oh, Catherine.
I should've known. That's who you were getting right with last night.
that's stunning detective work. Well done.
you know, it's amazing. Now, she...she catches bad guys for you and she sleeps with you.
does she cook, too? - Yeah, she does. She's a great cook.
Roger that. We've got eyes on the northern avenue of approach.
what's your status?
all right, I think I got a hit on your frequency. I'm tying you in right now.
overwatch on Reeves is good.
we're standing by. - All right, that's our boy.
can you get a vector on the signal source?
all right, the west end of the dock.
it's coming from a shipping container.
what are you doing?
lower your weapons! Right now!
lower your gun!
you can't come in here. You're gonna get this girl killed.
we're gonna get this girl killed?
you obstructed our investigation!
now unless your men are ready to shoot a couple of cops, tell them to holster their weapons now.
right now, buddy.
Where's the ambassador?
he's in position for the drop.
pull him out now.
with all due respect, my team specializes in these situations.
we want to get Robin home to her family.
of course you do, because if you don't, your firm is on the hook for six million, right?
the man who kidnapped the ambassador's daughters is a part of a Filipino terrorist group.
sir, they just arrived.
this is not about cash, gentlemen.
they lured him in.
look at that, Robin is not with them.
patch me into the ambassador.
all right, listen, they're here.
I want you to be calm and do exactly as we already discussed.
you know who I am?
you're an operative of the NLF, responsible for the Zamboanga bombings that killed 78 people.
I see you read your security briefs. Where is she?
Where's my daughter?
she's nearby.
when we get what we want, we will release her.
you didn't come all this way for my money, did you?
I'm afraid not, Ambassador.
we came for you.
what do you want?
your country sends military aid to the Philippine regime.
you put guns in the hands of soldiers that kill our sons and brothers.
I don't understand.
there's a U. S. shipment of M-4 machine guns en route to Manila.
you're gonna tell me where they are right now and we're gonna use those weapons to take our country back.
I don't have that kind of information.
as ambassador, you coordinate military aid with the State Department, which means you have access to the classified server.
now if you ever want to see your daughter alive again, log in.
all right, he finds out where that shipment is, he can send a team in to hijack it.
we cannot let him get to those weapons.
tell the perimeter team to gear up.
wait a minute. What are you doing?
we're running out of options. We gotta move in.
we don't need to do anything.
you need to pull your men out so my partner and I can clean up your mess.
move out now. I'm not gonna tell you again!
come on.
your wife already lost one daughter.
are you prepared to tell her your other child died because you wouldn't do what was asked?
ambassador, this is Commander McGarrett.
stay calm, listen.
tell them that you're willing to cooperate, but first you need to see your daughter.
we cannot move in until we know where she is, you understand?
fingerprint and password, Ambassador, now! - Please trust me.
do as I ask you. Tell Carlos you're willing to cooperate, but first you need to see Robin.
ambassador, do it, please.
you're asking me to commit treason against my country.
and I will do as you ask, but not until I know she's safe.
I want to see Robin.
she's on her way.
they're bringing Robin in. We need to get a visual.
you're kidding me. - No, I'm not kidding. Come here.
look, this one controls the camera feed, the joystick is for pans and zoom, okay?
it's just like Ms. Pac-Man. It's very easy.
they're holding the ambassador on dry dock number seven.
and the daughter?
she's not on-site, but Bagoyo has just agreed to provide proof of life.
we think he's holding her in a nearby location.
as soon as we get eyes on Robin, we can move in.
okay, we got a boat coming in.
got her. - All right, that's us.
we're going, Danny.
okay, I'll just be here in the penalty box.
we still clear?
Roger that.
daddy!
sweetie.
go.
okay, hold up, hold up.
you got two at the south entrance.
one of them's making the rounds, coming your way right now.
he's coming up right behind you.
he'll be on you in about ten seconds.
wait for it.
now, now.
that's enough.
no, no, no, no, please, please?!
ambassador, you've seen your daughter.
now log in.
my patience is wearing thin, Ambassador.
do it or she dies.
it's okay. You guys okay?
Yeah.
all right.
listen, I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong. Thank you.
you both have great instincts, and if you ever consider coming down to the private sector, you should give me a call.
men with your skill sets deserve to be compensated.
I know. Well, thank you very much. - I totally agree.
Oh, what are you doing?
I'm getting compensation.
you obstructed a criminal investigation.
that is an arrestable offense.
well, you and I both know that the charges will never stick.
Yeah, maybe not, but it's going to take your firm at least 24 hours to get a lawyer here from Los Angeles.
I'm gonna make sure that you spend that time in jail.
book him, Danno.
you know, I got to be honest. I actually didn't mind that one.
Really? - Yeah.
move.
you saved a girl's life today.
just doing the job you hired me for.
maybe so, but I made a promise to a friend and you let me keep it. Thank you.
Hey, you okay? - Yeah.
okay, to, uh, let me see...well, how about this?
to finally getting around to dinner.
Yes.
Cheers. - Cheers.
all right, well, I don't know about the food, but the view here is amazing.
how do you like your steak?
bloody.
that's my kind of girl.
think it'll be ready in a minute.
you know what? - What?
make it medium.
Oh, oh, hold on a second. - Yeah, yeah.
Hawaii
no bro pound?
Aonani, give me some love, huh?
you be good out there, Mr. Zack.
I will.
well... Auf Wiedersehen, happy trails and all that.
Hey, Mom. - Honey.
you're so thin.
what's up, little man? I missed you. You know that?
dad, I'm sorry.
get in the car, son.
honey, we're lost. Why can't you just admit it?
we are not lost.
looks like you crushed your old high score.
this is not the way we came. Honey, you took a wrong turn back there.
it's impossible. I'm following the GPS.
well, then the GPS is wrong. We haven't seen a house for miles.
maybe we should turn around and go back.
honey, please, okay, just relax.
dad, speed up. - What?
dad, speed up. Don't stop. - What's going on?
get away from us! - Leave him alone!
what are you doing to him?
Zack! - Let him go! Let him go!
let go of my son!
Mary, hey.
Aloha.
how are you? - I'm good.
I didn't realize you were bringing your friend with you. Who is this?
Oh, I'm sorry. My manners. Morty, this is Steve.
pleasure to meet you, sir. - Isn't it?
so, this is the big brother, huh?
doesn't look so big to me.
Mary, please tell me you did not marry him.
EW, no. Of course not. - Okay.
but I mean, not for lack of trying. He's been proposing to me ever since we met.
why is he here? - Because I can't leave him.
what are you talking about? - Oh, I'm his caregiver.
you're his caregiver?
Yeah, the flight attendant thing didn't work out so well.
Steve, listen please.
I really think that this could be my true calling.
I love taking care of people.
well, that's funny, Mary, because you can barely take care of yourself.
we take care of each other. Don't we, doll?
Morty, do you remember our conversation about professional boundaries?
no. Memory's not so good.
how about this, Morty, you touch my sister again like that,
I'm gonna break your hand. Think you can remember that?
he's as surly as you described. At ease, sailor.
why is he here?
because I have responsibilities now, Steve.
and besides, visiting Hawaii was on Morty's bucket list.
okay, you know what, I need to talk to you in private right now.
Morty, my brother needs to talk to me in private.
thank you.
so, what this big secret you can't tell me over the phone?
it's about Mom.
mc
she's not coming, is she?
I mean, you can't blame her, Mom.
she thought you were dead. - Where's she staying?
okay. I'll just track her down myself.
acquiring target locations is actually a specialty of mine, so...
mom.
mom, Mary's your daughter; she's not a target.
I'm sorry. Look...
give her some space, okay? Give her some time.
when she's ready, she's gonna come to you.
and what if that never happens?
is that her? - No, no, no, stand down, Mom. It's work.
did you just tell me to stand down? - Affirmative. Now, if you don't mind...
okay, okay. - McGarrett.
Yeah, I'll be there in 20.
none of this makes any sense. Zack's a good kid.
uh, you did just pick him up after a six-month stay at juvenile hall though, right?
it was just a prank. - Not exactly.
Zack took things too far and he paid the price.
what exactly did he do?
hacked into the White House database and got tickets to the Correspondents' Dinner.
they wanted to make an example out of Zack, and they gave him a six month sentence.
what about when he was locked up?
any trouble, fights that he got into, anything you know of?
no. - None that he mentioned.
what are you guys doing way out here in the middle of nowhere, anyway?
I was just following the GPS.
Hey, Charlie, is it possible to hack a GPS and send somebody off course?
Yeah, but it's a fairly sophisticated process.
I'll have to get it back to the lab to be sure.
you think someone lured them out here?
well, it's a remote location.
it's the perfect spot to grab somebody without any witnesses.
this was a highly planned and perfectly executed abduction.
your name is James, right?
well, my name is Kono, James.
and we're here to find your brother, Zack.
maybe you saw something that can help us?
can I see?
you get something from the brother?
Yeah, license plate. He was typing it over and over again on his tablet.
I'm running it now.
okay, so the van was reported stolen yesterday.
looks like it was logged back in the system 15 minutes ago.
wait a minute, it's already been recovered?
Yeah, and it's headed on its way back to the HPD Impound lot.
you guys move fast. I haven't even done inventory on it yet.
it's a kidnapping case. Time's a luxury we don't have.
what the hell?
looks like our kidnapping case just turned to murder.
med
Max, no cane. Looking good.
Mahalo. Another couple of weeks, and I can resume my spinning classes.
that's nice; I just got a visual of you wearing biker shorts. Thank you.
my pleasure. Now if you'll allow me to demonstrate my newfound mobility,
I have some information on your murder victim.
the cause of death was cardiac arrest.
Seriously? - Unquestionably.
wait a minute, how does a 17-year-old die of a heart attack?
well, according to your victim's medical records, he suffered from a history of arrhythmia.
I believe that his condition was exacerbated by physical trauma.
he was tortured.
Yes, and from the looks of it, they broke his fingers one by one, a crude, but effective torture method.
what could a 17-year-old possibly know that warrants being tortured to death?
that would be your jurisdiction, Detective.
that's why I asked him.
however, I did find something else quite interesting.
these bruises are consistent with CPR.
with CPR? What, they tried to revive him? - Yes.
which means whatever they wanted out of the kid... they didn't get.
five
the warden said that Zack was a model prisoner.
he kept to himself, and stayed out of trouble.
except for one incident, where he got into a shouting match with someone who was visiting him.
now, Kono checked all the visitor's logs, and other than his mother, the only person who came to see him was Kong Liang.
who is he?
kong Liang. Chinese national and notorious cyber-criminal.
FBI has him involved in banking Trojans, scareware, identity theft.
I mean, you name the cyber crime and he's into it.
he's also very into making money.
HPD Cyber Crime task force estimates that he pulls down between $25 million and $50 million a year.
okay, why is Kong Liang not in prison?
the FBI's been trying to make a case for years, but he has the best hackers covering his trail.
word is, he runs his operation like a sweatshop, recruiting computer experts from around the world.
that would explain the prison visit.
Yeah, maybe Zack turned him down, or Kong Liang wanted information that Zack had.
all right, so Kong Liang hires a couple of goons to kidnap this kid the day he gets out of the can.
that's a hell of a recruiting pitch.
right. Where do we find him?
well, HPD has zero leads on his location. The guy's a ghost.
no problem.
how is that no problem?
it's no problem because you forget that I have a CI deeply embedded in the hacker game.
these computer geeks, they all know each other.
there you go, brah. Completely reconditioned.
little tip: there's nothing free about free porn.
think before you link.
Hey. What's up, Toast?
Jersey. Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
you got a minute?
Hey, look, guys.
before I talk, I just want to make sure I-I have total impunity.
you mean immunity. - Yes.
that-that is what I meant. Look, I'm just worried about blowback.
I have mouths to feed, responsibilities.
roommates to think of-- Rocky and Bullwinkle.
a moose and a flying squirrel.
no. Those are their hacker handles.
my job at Digi-Dome is the only thing that's keeping us in Cap'n Crunch.
what is that? Is that another hacker handle? Will you speak English, please?
it's a cereal. People eat it in the mornings.
toast, listen.
whatever you tell us is going to be kept in strict confidence. All right?
look, if that means that no one's gonna find out where this came from, then great.
cause I'm not a snitch, okay?
okay. Now that we got that out of the way, maybe we can start with an easy one.
can you help us find Kong Liang?
Yeah, of course.
but that guy's beaucoup bad news, guys. He runs a hacker crew.
and he invited me to come and be a part of it, but I politely declined because of the illegal nature of it.
this kid-- he ever work for Kong?
that's Omega Man. - Zack Slater.
I only know him by his hacker handle. He's crazy good.
now he's crazy dead. - Tortured and killed this morning.
and we have reason to believe that Kong and this is connected.
that's heavy.
I mean, if Kong Liang deleted Zack, you guys are not gonna be able to connect him to it.
well, that's fine. We're gonna get him for hacking, we push for the maximum.
you're not gonna get him for that, either.
I mean, the moment he sees you two guys coming, uh, he will wipe his trail clean with one keystroke. Game over.
no, he won't. - Why is that?
Well,'cause it won't be us that he sees coming.
this is crazy, I can't... I... I can't wear a wire. This is crazy.
I-I'm... this is against my philosophy.
stay alive" - Would you shut up,please? Okay?
if you want to live, you'll do exactly what I say.
is your name Jonah Adkins?
Yes.
is your father the executive vice president of the Certified National Bank?
please, if it's money you want, just call my parents.
I'll tell you what I want.
I want to hear you beg for you life.
but I want you to do it in Spanish.
what?
beg for your life, Jonah,
that was pathetic.
I should kill you for that.
no, no, please don't. I don't want to die.
then sing me a song. What?
something from the '90s.
if it moves me, I'll consider letting you live.
I was born in the '90s, I don't know any of those songs.
then you're dead.
I want it that way.
not cool, dudes.
congratulations, you are now officially a pledge of the Beta Phi Tau.
now, onto the first test in your initiation.
we call it the century. To complete it, you'll need to consume 100 shots of beer, in under 100 minutes.
what say ye?
bottoms up.
where you going, lightweight?
36 shots to go... you got this.
what the hell?
sweet home Waimanalo
where the skies are so blue
sweet home Waimanalo
sang Min's coming home to you.
what, no flowers?
where do I sign for him? - Right here.
come on, girl. I came all the way from a haole prison on the mainland to snitch for you.
no in-flight movie, no meal service.
least you can do is, uh, show me some love.
let's get a couple of things straight.
one, don't call me girl.
you can address me as Officer Kalakaua or don't address me at all.
two, this is not a vacation.
you're here to testify at a federal trial in exchange for a sentence reduction.
so, please, don't pretend you're doing me any favors.
cause, trust me, there are plenty of things I'd rather be doing than babysitting your ass for the next 24 hours.
I get it. So you want to hit the shrimp truck before we check into the hotel?
get in the car.
still spicy.
Max got an I.D. yet?
no, he's still fishing out body parts.
I think he's enjoying it, too.
I can't believe that was a person.
crispy.
um, I told you my nephew was maybe gonna come visit from Jersey.
well, that happened. Here he is.
what's up, bro? - Call me E-Train.
put your hand down, okay?
that's not your bro, your name's Eric.
please go wait in the car like I asked you to, okay?
can I at least have the keys? You didn't even crack a window.
then wait outside. Anywhere but my crime scene.
okay? Please? Come on.
don't look at me like that, just go.
yo, how you doin', sweetheart?
okay, so your nephew visits from Jersey, and you, uh, bring him on a homicide call?
that's... yep.
okay. Just a hunch, but do you think maybe he would've enjoyed the beach a little more?
Yeah, he's lucky he's not locked up.
okay, couple months ago he gets popped in a stolen car.
make a couple phone calls, get the charges dropped.
my sister's worried sick, does not know what to do with him.
so she send him to me, maybe I can, I don't know, scare some sense into him.
how's that working out?
he just saw his first dead body and he's still acting like a complete idiot so, I guess I have my work cut out for me.
right. What do we know?
okay, according to Max, guy was dead before he hit the tub.
well, if the acid bath didn't kill him, what did?
blunt force trauma to the head.
we also got signs of forced entry, and... a bunch of stolen lab gear.
we got, uh, bioreactor, particle protector, couple of laser microscopes.
you know, bunch of other stuff I've never heard of.
all right, so the vic was in here when the robbery went down.
Yeah. Wrong place, wrong time.
guy gets bonked in the head and then turned into human soup. - That's smart.
get rid of any evidence on the body they could trace back, right?
guy's stealing fancy microscopes, probably know a thing or two about DNA.
okay, things just got interesting.
HPD found the stolen lab gear in a Dumpster three blocks from here.
I'm thinking this was a murder staged to look like a robbery.
CSU just finished processing the point of entry and determined the door was broken from the inside.
okay, so the killer had access to this place but did not want us to know that.
Mm-hmm, and according to campus security, there are over 300 students and faculty members with keycard access to this lab.
then every one of them is a suspect.
this is a huge blow to the university.
professor Cutler wasn't just a brilliant educator and researcher
he was ohana, a member of the O'ahu State family.
okay, well someone in his ohana wanted him dead.
we've determined that the robbery was staged.
what? - Professor Cutler was killed by somebody who had access to the lab.
who would've wanted to do something like that?
well, Mr. Roth, you're chairman of the department. We were hoping you could tell us.
there you go.
list of every student and faculty member with lab access.
Thanks. So did Professor Cutler use the lab often?
I'd say so. Once these guys get published, half their time is spent writing and researching.
then it falls on teaching assistants like me to pick up the slack in the classroom.
bram, do you know what he was working on in the lab last night?
no. Been spending a lot of late nights there.
keeping weird hours.
but then there's a lot about the professor's behavior that seemed odd lately.
Really? How so?
well, he started missing lectures.
when he did show up, he seemed distracted.
I asked him if everything was okay, and he told me to mind my own business.
there was one incident a couple of days ago, but I'm quite certain it was nothing.
why don't you let us make that call?
I heard yelling.
when I looked outside, I saw a student storming out of Joel's office.
she was crying and she seemed very upset.
does this student have a name?
I'm sure she does, but I don't know what it is.
all I can tell you is she was about five-two with brown hair and dark colored eyes.
did the professor say what the argument was about?
joel was a very private person.
I never asked him about his personal life.
whoa, whoa, a female student comes out of his office with tears in her eyes - how's that a personal matter?
wait a minute, I never meant to insinuate... - You just did.
look, your friend is dead, so why don't you stop trying to protect him.
if you know something, you need to tell us. Right now.
joel had a way of connecting with his students;
making complex ideas understandable.
intellect like that can be very alluring to a young woman.
you should've seen the way they looked at him.
he ever cross the line?
I have my suspicions.
but if I had found out that he was sleeping with a student,
I would have had to fire him.
that's why I just never asked.
you got to be kidding.
Aloha, Mrs. Min.
your husband wanted to surprise you with a late lunch.
consider me surprised.
what kind of two-star dump you putting me up in here?
bathroom doesn't even have a flat iron.
about time. I'm starving.
all right, first of all, cross your legs.
okay, second of all, I don't know how you managed this, - Excuse me, brotha.
but I am not signing for this food.
you tell 'em, sister.
Bruddah, you call these jumbo shrimp?
they're small, they're rubbery, and they got no flavor.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't take the food back now.
okay, if it's that bad, why are you still eating it?
and a better question is, what the hell are you doing here?
sang called me from the joint.
said he needed some fresh threads for his court date. Check it out.
check those lapels, huh?
Tony Montana style.
made to measure, brah.
my tailor is the best on the Island.
I don't buy nothing off the rack no more.
I'm sure you don't.
Oh, you think this is funny?
yesterday, you were sitting in a supermax in Virginia 'cause half the bad guys on this island wanted you dead.
and now, you're back.
and there are some very dangerous people who do not want you testifying tomorrow.
so, I'd quit treating this place like a hospitality suite.
okay, I'm just curious.
how many people did you invite?
I'm not expecting no one else.
Oh, thank God.
Jason Parker from the office of the prosecuting attorney.
I'm here to prep the witness for his testimony tomorrow.
officer Decker here will relieve you of duty while we prepare.
he's all yours.
this is where you work?
Yeah. - Not bad.
Oh, bitchin' computer.
no, hey... - You got Minesweeper on this thing?
ho, ho, hey. Stop. Stop.
stop. Please, go wait in my office, - okay? - What am I supposed to do in there?
I don't know.
why don't you go meditate on the poor life decisions you've made, maybe think about how you can turn it all around.
please.
it's like, uh, house-training a puppy.
I mean, the kid has zero impulse control.
guys, I got a voice mail you need to hear.
this came through on Professor Cutler's cell phone two days ago.
you can't do this to me.
if you keep ignoring me, there will be consequences.
as far as threats go, that's not subtle.
we identify the caller?
Yeah, number came back to a Rebecca Fine.
she's a senior in Cutler's advanced chem class.
five foot two, brown hair, brown eyes.
matches the description of the student that was seen leaving Cutler's office in tears.
Mm-hmm, and she had access to the lab.
according to Cutler's teaching assistant, he had been spending a lot of late hours there.
okay, okay, let me take a stab at this.
so, Cutler is getting cute with, uh, young Rebecca here.
uh, they're using the lab for, um, late-night hookups.
relationship goes south, he tries to end it and Rebecca kills him.
I like it.
let's see what Rebecca's got to say about it.
Now-now, this...
now, this is the best thing I've ever seen.
what?
thank you.
what? What is it?
Oh, it's our own Danny Williams.
Oh. As Mr. November in the 1998 Newark Police Academy calendar.
look at you, buddy.
I was young, this was for charity. Where did you get this?
uh, I believe you just e-mailed it to me.
no, I didn't. - Yeah, you just e-mailed it to me, too.
and, it looks like you e-mailed it to everybody in your address book.
get up.
stand up. Stand up, stand up.
do you think that is funny?
you know Grace is on that e-mail?
Oh... my bad, man.
I know how scarring it could be for a kid to see that photo.
your calendar hung in our kitchen for years.
mom thought it was the biggest deal when you became a cop.
Oh, that's good. Well, at least somebody in the family is making her proud, right?
that's low, dude.
Oh, it's low? Suck it up, okay?
while you are - look at me when I'm talking to you - while you are here, you are going to be living in what is called the real world.
that means, you act like an idiot, and I am gonna call you out.
now, you can go back to New Jersey, and you can continue to waste away your life.
or, you can say here and you can maybe learn something.
it's your choice.
but please know, please know that unlike your mother, I am not a pushover, okay?
you pull another stunt like that again, and I am not going to be as courteous as I am being right now, you dig?
Yeah.
ready?
let's go, I got a case to work.
let's go. You're gonna like this, I promise.
I need to rethink my decision to skip college.
easy, there, tiger.
Kelly, your dads are here to pick you up.
those aren't my dads.
I'm sorry.
you think I look old enough to be her father?
that's the... that's the part you bumped on?
you were right. This is definitely worth coming for.
okay, excuse me.
we're looking for Rebecca Fine. Is she here?
Yeah. Becky's room's upstairs.
second door on the right.
all right, thank you.
you guys go ahead, I don't want to...
get in your way.
okay. Behave yourself, please.
how you doing, baby doll? What's going on?
go away!
Rebecca, this is Commander McGarrett of Five-O.
open the door.
one second.
I'm just getting changed.
you buying that?
no.
window.
Rebecca, stop!
well, this is definitely a first.
how do you want to play it?
shoot her tires out.
you don't get a vote.
Rebecca, pull over.
no.
please?
No!
okay, that didn't work.
you guys are making a huge mistake.
my dad's a big-time lawyer.
he's gonna own this entire building by the time he's through with you.
hmm. How do you... how do you figure that?
this is textbook police harassment.
you can't just arrest someone and then keep them in a dungeon for no reason.
you can't do this to me.
if you keep ignoring me, there will be consequences.
so, we got a witness who saw you storming out of
Joe Cutler's office in tears.
the next day, you leave this message.
day after that, he's dead.
this is crazy, because I didn't kill him. - Really?
then why'd you run when we came to look for you?
I'm not saying anything else without my lawyer.
you mean, uh, your daddy, right?
excuse me, guys.
I believe this is yours.
see, after your arrest, HPD showed up to search your room and it was flooded.
it seems that the toiled got clogged when you tried to flush your stash.
so, that's why you ran.
you have no idea the pressure I'm under.
midterms are this week, and I have been up for days studying.
I just... I needed a little boost, so I bought some prescription uppers off of a friend.
it was the only way I could keep up with all the cheaters.
Cheaters?
what are you talking about?
kids in my advanced chem class are cheating.
someone's been selling them the exams.
that's why I went to go see Professor Cutler.
and why I left him that message.
I was just trying to get him to do something about it.
but he ignored you, is that right?
he said he'd look into it, but he couldn't do anything unless there was proof.
then he told me to focus on acing the midterm, totally disregarding that the class is graded on a curve and the cheaters were dragging my grade down.
I mean, this is my future we're talking about.
do you know how much of an impact even a few tenths of a GPA point can have on your ability to get into med school?
I have no idea. Tell me.
it's the difference between Johns Hopkins and...
a state school.
Oh, horrible.
got it.
that was Max.
he just finished autopsying Cutler's body.
based on the skull fractures, to inflict that kind of damage, he's saying the killer had to have been at least 190 pounds.
okay, Rebecca is definitely not our killer.
and this cheating business changes everything.
if Cutler was looking into it, maybe one of his students killed him to avoid being expelled.
wow, I mean, college is a lot more cutthroat than I remember.
I just talked to Fong.
he found spyware on Cutler's work computer.
it was used to pull a bunch of files off the hard drive.
okay, well, that would explain how the seller got his hands on the exams.
Fong know who hacked the computer?
no. That's a dead end, the spyware was untraceable.
okay, we need to find a kid that's cheating and roll him to get the name of the guy who sold the exam.
want to know who's cheating?
What'd you do?
did you get some scoop from the sorority girls?
no.
I was just gonna say, you could check the transcripts.
see whose grades spiked the most. Chances are, they're cheating.
kid's got a point.
I'll wait out here.
this is, uh, college.
it's not a virus, you cannot catch it.
go. - Okay.
Tyler Brown, come on down.
let's go.
all right, stop.
I'm in the middle of writing a midterm, what's this about?
what's this about? I'll tell you what it's about, it's about your grades.
all right, one day, you're about to drop out of this place, the next day you're gunning for the dean's list.
what's your secret?
just started applying myself, I guess.
Oh, yeah? - Well. whoa, what are you doing?
you need a nickel that bad, I'll lend you one, okay?
your boy here chucked this can on the way out. Look at this.
drinks. One of the few things you can take into a test.
see, you mock up a fake label with an answer key on it, no one looks twice.
that's good.
nice catch, E-Train.
Thanks.
please, Steve. - Look at that.
okay, dopey, who'd you buy the exam from?
I think my ribs are broken.
yeah?
well, next time a cop calls your name, don't run.
seriously... it hurts when I breathe.
then breathe less.
come on, get up. Turn around.
a little excessive, don't you think, guys?
I mean, all I did was sell some exams.
Oh, you forgot about the part where you brained your boss and dumped him into an acid bath.
what? You guys think I killed Professor Cutler?
Yes, we do.
no. Look, I'll admit, Cutler was not my favorite person.
I mean, he was so wrapped up in his research, I was basically teaching the class for him.
I gave his lectures, graded the papers and exams, I figured for all that extra work
I was due some compensation.
right. So, you hacked his computer for the exams.
he finds out you're selling them, then you kill him.
no, I didn't kill him.
and I certainly didn't hack his computer, because I wrote all those exams myself.
Cutler was so checked out, he never even asked to see them.
all right, thank you.
T.A.'s story checks out.
got three other faculty members vouching for the fact that he did write the exams for the class.
well, that means Cutler's computer was hacked for something else.
Yeah, but for what?
I mean, he's skipping class, he's spending late nights in the lab, and we got no evidence of this so-called research project that he's been working on.
maybe he was hiding it.
what do you mean?
I mean, if he knew there was spyware on his computer, he probably started being careful.
maybe he didn't keep his work at the office.
Nah, HPD already checked the house, and they came up with nothing.
I don't mean to besmirch the good people of the Honolulu Police Department, - but it is possible they missed something. - "Besmirch"?
Yeah. I'm just saying, hypothetically speaking, if I was hiding something in my mother's house...
...which I am not...
...I'd make sure the cops had to tear the place apart to find it.
and I'm no chemistry genius.
kid's been on a roll, lately.
might be worth a second look.
fine. Fine, but you're still waiting in the car.
what else is new?
you hear that?
Yeah, Danny, I hear it. I have ears.
it's a reasonable question.
it's coming from behind this bookcase.
lock's busted.
hydroponic grow room.
lights are on timers.
they must have been off when HPD did their sweep. That's why they didn't hear it.
okay, um, been my experience here, but I think the grow room usually means one thing, no?
Yeah, but this isn't marijuana. - I can see that. What is it?
I don't know.
whatever it is, is was worth killing for.
and of course, this is Charlie. He's a crime scene technician.
he uses science to provide our investigations with new and helpful leads.
just like he's about to do now. Right, Charlie?
that's the idea.
Oh, sweet thermal cycler, dude.
how do you know what that is?
Duh. Discovery Channel.
that's weird.
DNA analysis matched the sample to a species called Kawaihae hibiscadelphus.
what's so weird about it?
well, what's weird is, it's been thought to be extinct for about 200 years.
which means your victim either found a very rare specimen, or he brought it back to life.
it's pretty cool, right?
I don't understand it.
how did our vic get his hands on an extinct plant?
we don't know yet, but the real question is, why did it get him killed?
anyway, how are things going on your end?
I'm back at the room now.
I just have to get Sang Min to court in the morning.
then I ship his greasy mullet back to the mainland.
all right, hang in there, cuz.
Yeah.
what happened?
sneaky bastard blindsided us. He's gone.
I think I found out how our victim got a hold of that plant.
I combed through Cutler's financials, and over the past six months, he's been booking regular hunting trips.
now, the thing about that is, he doesn't own a hunting license or even own a gun.
guy must have sucked at hunting, huh?
I don't think it was about the hunting.
I think it was about where he was going.
where was that?
right. Niihau.
I obviously know what you're talking about, but for the kid's sake, why don't you explain what that place is?
right.
Niihau is the northernmost island of Hawaii.
it's also the largest private island in the world.
wait. Some dude owns his own private island in Hawaii?
that's pretty pimp.
Yeah, well, it's been owned by the same family since 1864.
and they allow a small population of about a hundred native Hawaiians to live there.
Yup, no longer as interesting.
they live entirely off the land.
they have no telephones, no running water.
and the only way outsiders can visit is through one of these exclusive hunting trips.
it's also home to thousands of plant species that exist nowhere else in the world.
so what are we thinking?
Cutler - he goes over there looking for this extinct plant, uh, he finds it, and somehow, it gets him killed?
locals call it the Forbidden Island for a reason.
if anybody saw Cutler taking plants from there illegally,
I'm sure they wouldn't take too kindly to it.
all right, we need to retrace Cutler's steps, see who might have caught on to his secret.
first place we need to start is Niihau.
okay, owners have a foreman who oversees operations.
I'll call ahead and get us cleared for helicopter transport.
all right - I get to ride in a helicopter?
no. - Finally, something cool happens.
no, no, no, you're not...
you're not riding in a helicopter. I apologize.
we will stay here. Uh, I'll do some work on Cutler's computer.
we find out who hacked it, maybe we'll get our killer.
wait a minute. Crime lab said that's a dead end.
I know. I got a guy.
why don't you just admit, you don't like flying with me?
okay, I don't like flying with you. Have a safe flight.
we get two or three hunting parties coming through here every day.
once they touch down, the hunters are on their own.
well, the guy we're looking for has been here nine times in the past three months.
you recognize him?
honestly, when they're all geared up in camo and guns, it's hard to tell them apart.
Oh, this guy wasn't here to hunt.
we think he was splitting off on his own to explore the island.
well, if that's the case, it's hard to imagine he'd have gone unnoticed.
you should try asking the locals.
but I got to warn you.
they're a little wary of outsiders.
we'll give it a shot.
he would go into the jungle on his own.
we've also seen smoke coming from the same area, about three miles north.
when was the last time you saw him?
not for a few days.
but the smoke was there this morning.
thank you for your help.
she recognized Cutler.
a number of the locals saw him heading out into the jungle just on his own.
they also saw smoke coming from a spot about three miles due north of here.
must be where Cutler's laying up, right?
Mm-hmm. Exactly, and apparently, they saw smoke there this morning, which means somebody else is out there.
and that somebody else could be our killer.
I need you to call back all the hunting parties that are currently on the island.
we're going after a suspect.
we don't want anybody getting in the way.
hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait in the car. I get it.
no, no. I, uh...
I, uh... I was thinking about what I said to you this morning, and, um, I want to tell you that I-I think it was wrong.
I want to apologize.
you mean when you were ragging on my nickname?
cause I've gotten over that.
can you just shut up for two seconds, please?
I am trying to be serious, okay?
okay, uh... now, this, um...
this may be hard to believe, um, but, um, there was a time in my life
albeit a very brief one
when I was not so different from you.
okay? I thought I was a tough guy.
I got myself into some trouble.
uh, difference is, I had a-a father around to, kick my ass, set me straight when I got out of line.
now, your mother, she is an amazing person, and she loves you very much, but she's completely and utterly incapable of getting tough with you and telling you the things that you need to hear.
which at this point in your life is, you've, um... accomplished nothing of note. And have zero value to society.
is this normally how you apologize?
cause you may want to rethink the approach.
right.
your mother, uh, she expects more of you.
Eric, expect more of you.
but more important than all of that, you should expect more from yourself.
you're right.
hmm. You want to repeat that, please?
no.
you, uh... you did good today.
why don't you come, uh, get my back? How about that?
Really? - Yeah.
all right!
Hello, hombres.
who are you?
I'm the guy who lives here in the house, whose door you just knocked on. Who are you?
Hey. We ask the questions.
Hey, chill, bro.
my name's Bullwinkle.
Oh, okay, right.
you're, um, Toast's roommate.
uh, is he home?
Yeah.
okay, good. Can I speak to him, please?
no, I meant, like, home home, in Baltimore.
he went back for his sister's Bat Mitzvah.
I don't believe this.
I know. It's crazy, right?
12 years old, and already a woman, according to the laws of Moses.
little young, no?
anyway,
where are my manners?
would you like the first hit?
uh, I,uh... I would, except I'm on duty, you see, so I can't do that.
Oy. What, are you gonna, like, arrest me now?
that all depends on how good are you with computers.
based on all these broken branches, somebody came through here recently.
I'd say we're in the right place.
Hey! Hey!
hands in the air! - Five-O!
put it down right now. Drop it.
put it down.
who are you? What are you doing here?
my name's Dr. Brian Stephens.
I'm a botanist. I'm-I'm just doing a little research here.
can you at least lower your weapons?
we'll lower the weapons when you tell us how you know Joel Cutler.
Oh, look, I - I... Guys, I know I'm not supposed to be here, but can you leave Joel out of it? He's just trying to help me out.
joel Cutler is dead.
joel and I were roommates at Stanford. Uh...
I went on to work as a botanist for an agricultural engineering firm, and...
well, then, three years ago, everything changed, when my son, Avery
he was diagnosed with a degenerative disease.
Adrenoleukodystrophy.
Yeah. I'd never heard of it, either.
it's very rare. It...
it affects about one in every 100, 000.
and ever since my son's diagnosis, well,
I've dedicated my life to beating the disease.
okay, so that's... that's why you're out here-- searching for a cure?
it's taken me some time, but I...
I think I found it.
its alkaloidal compounds might have the key to beating the disease.
but I couldn't have done this alone.
so Cutler was helping you.
that's why he was coming out here and why he had samples of this plant on O'ahu.
Yeah. Joel was a... an amazing chemist.
he could see things in the data that I could never have found.
and now he's dead because of me.
who else knew what you guys were onto?
no one.
we didn't want anyone to know where we discovered it.
well, somebody found out.
dude?
why do you have so much ranch dressing?
uh, because it's delicious?
would you please stop? Please let him concentrate. Come here.
come over here. - All right. Yeah.
pretty sneaky, but...
you cannot hide from me.
gotcha.
Gotcha? What do you got?
if I tell you, can I keep my pineapple bong?
what bong?
what we got here is a Trojan horse virus. It was embedded in an e-mail attachment.
once it was opened, it gave the sender remote access to the computer.
okay, good. I need to know who sent the e-mail.
you got it.
Hey, Danny, any luck with the computer?
I'd say so.
we just figured out who killed Cutler.
who?
you are not gonna believe this.
okay, the virus on Cutler's computer was embedded in an e-mail attachment sent from... Patrick Roth.
his boss at the university.
he sent it as a memo to the entire chemistry department, so he could keep tabs on everybody.
roth must have gotten sick and tired of watching his employees publish papers and cash in.
he sees that Cutler is onto something big, he kills him so he can claim it as his own.
all right, I'll pick him up.
all right. Chin and I are heading back now.
all right. Got it.
that was Danny.
HPD's still looking for Roth.
nobody at his office knows where he is.
commander, I rounded up all of the hunting parties , but one person is still unaccounted for.
we've tried radioing him, but he's not responding.
you got a name?
according to the tour operator, his name is Patrick Roth.
roth must have found out Cutler wasn't working alone.
Yeah, and now he's come out here to take Stephens out, too.
okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
you even knock on the door?
when I found out she changed her name
I figured it was just for safety.
you know, with guys out gunning for me, she don't want that blowing back on her and the boy.
but now that I seen this...
... I realize it's me she's protecting herself from.
you know what I don't get?
is that you agreed to testify just so you could track down your ex-wife, but... even if she took you back,
I mean, you knew it wasn't gonna be happily ever after.
you had to know that we were gonna catch you eventually.
I didn't even think about that.
I just...
I just wanted to see her again.
you can take me back to jail now.
I'll make you a deal.
you follow through with the testimony tomorrow, and I'll pull some strings and get you transferred back to Halawa.
that way at least you can be close.
I busted the prosecuting attorney's head pretty good, and I don't see him cutting me no breaks.
that was the deputy prosecuting attorney.
I can sell the transfer by getting you placed in maximum security.
it's harder to escape, and also...
it'll protect you from all the guys who want you dead.
it won't do any good.
she's never gonna forgive me.
you never know.
people have a way of surprising sometimes.
how can a girl who's so spicy also be so sweet, huh?
don't make me change my mind. Let's go.
that was an excellent move.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, guys.
just thought I'd come and see how you two are doing.
Avery, this is Commander McGarrett with Five-O.
it's nice to meet you, sir.
well, the honor's all mine, Avery.
your dad's told me what a brave kid you are.
you mind if I steal your dad away for a second?
no.
you got a sec?
Yeah. - Good to meet you.
it's good to meet you, sir.
what's this?
it's a letter, signed by the governor, giving you permission to carry on your research on Niihau for as long as it takes.
thank you, thank you.
you're welcome.
you okay?
Yeah. I think I know what I want to do in my life.
want to be a cop? - No!
the job is way too stressful.
I want to work in a crime lab.
that's a very good career, Eric. It'd be nice.
you need some sort of degree to do that?
I don't think so.
you watch the Discovery Channel, right?
should be okay. You know?
that's good.
come on. I'll buy you a loco moco.
a what?!
ocean LOLINGE WAIKIKI
how'd I let you talk me into another round, huh?
come on.
we need to decompress.
Yeah, decompression is for the day after the special election, especially when your guy only has a two-point lead.
when are you gonna take it out of fifth gear?
people are still getting used to the idea that Senator Chang died in office.
they'll warm up to our guy, once the shock wears off.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe you're right.
what's the plan for tomorrow?
debate prep, campaign rally downtown, fund-raiser, and then in the evening there's a cocktail party for some big-money supporters.
whoa, this thing is really moving at warp speed.
Yeah, you know it.
well, the saving grace is that it will all be over...in two weeks.
Yeah, and then we'll either be looking for apartments in DC or job hunting.
Cheers.
okay, okay, okay, you convinced me.
I'm gonna go back to the office, crunch some more numbers.
being around all these beautiful people having a good time, that's just...
not the greatest motivator.
and I'm saying good night.
Oh, sorry. Good night.
what, are you sticking around?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna, uh, decompress a little more.
decompress. Sweet. I will, uh, see you bright and early.
bright and early. - Bright.
and early.
Belvedere dirty martini.
from the gentleman at the end of the bar.
Hey, handsome.
please... please don't do this.
don't do this.
I swear to you I told you everything I knew.
please...
I believe you.
you, uh, you look, uh, very nice-- suit and tie; that's good.
it's for you. Wore it for you.
thank you.
all right.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
is that a clip-on?
it's not a clip-on.
are you...What'd I just say to you?
your tie's all jacked up-- can I fix it, please?
come here. Come here. Come here.
thought nobody wore a tie in Hawaii.
no, they don't, but, you know, it's a special day, so I thought I'd wear one.
course, I'm wearing my dress blues.
they'd make me walk the plank if I don't wear a tie with the dress blues.
how come the blues are black?
I know they're black; I don't know why...
thank you very much for being here-- it means a lot. Okay?
you're welcome.
you'd do the same for me.
all right, you ready?
Yeah, I'm good. I got, uh...
the speech all prepared, everything's...
good. - Good.
tell you something, they take her away from me, I'm jumping off a cliff today.
Hey, hey, hey. That's not gonna happen, - Okay. - Okay?
Danny. - Okay.
all right? That's not gonna happen.
that's not gonna happen all right?
in the matter of Williams v. Edwards, where are we?
your Honor, my client has prepared a statement he'd like to read into the record.
go ahead.
excuse me.
sorry.
your Honor, uh...
I, uh, I come before you today.
okay, I'm sorry. Can I start over?
thank you.
uh, Your Honor.
I come..." That sucks.
detective Williams, why are you littering my courtroom?
I apologize. I really apologize, Your Honor. But...
um, I was prepared to give my speech to Rachel, my ex, but she's...
she's not here.
weren't you told that your statement should be addressed to this court?
Yes, I was, I was, but...
I know how busy a family court judge can be, right, presiding over cases much bigger, more serious than mine.
so I thought that I would appeal directly to Rachel.
go on.
okay. Okay, look, I,um...
I had a pretty good life in New Jersey, uh, and then...
I came here.
and it wasn't exactly a fit.
uh, the sun...
sand-- I mean, I can't even get a decent slice of pizza.
get to your point, Detective Williams.
okay, I hate this place.
I apologize, but I do.
but I was willing to put up with it, because this is where my daughter is.
and now her mother wants to move again, and I-I can't go through with that.
not to Vegas, not anywhere, because this... is my home.
this is our...home.
your Honor, that little girl is-is my everything.
she is my life, she is my breath.
and it may just be the two of us, but we...are a family.
and separating us by two thousand seven hundred and fifty-four miles of water is not...
something this court should allow.
detective, weren't you recently shot in the presence of your daughter?
I can...I can explain that, Your Honor.
commander McGarrett, this is not your forum.
Yes, I know that, Your Honor, and I'm sorry, but...
detective Williams doesn't just work for me
he's my friend, he's my close friend-- and, uh...
I've seen him with his daughter.
he's a great father.
he's actually the kind of father we all wish we had.
I'm so sorry. I have to take this call.
Yes, Governor?
she was found like that in a mansion in Kahala.
we got an I. D?
HPD is still working on it.
but here are the preliminaries.
all right.
we'll do everything we can to help, sir.
I don't want you to help, Commander
I want you and your Five-O task force to take over the case.
and I need it cleared quickly.
well, uh, HPD Homicide is very good...
and I need it done quietly.
Yes, sir.
if I may ask, what brought this case to your attention?
the people who own the house are friends of mine, close friends.
very dear friends.
I'd like the matter to remain private.
okay, well, I'll need to talk to them.
you can't. - Why not?
they're trekking in Nepal; completely unreachable.
I'll need to confirm that, sir.
I'm confirming it for you right now.
keep me in the loop, Commander.
I want constant updates.
and don't go through the office.
call my cell directly.
understood, sir.
all right, send him in.
hold on, let me get this straight.
is this official business, or is this a favor?
what difference does it make?
well, it makes a very big difference, you see, because official business is, uh, official.
a favor is like a quid pro quo kind of deal, right?
you...
solve this murder case for me, and I will give you, uh, oh, five days' paid vacation. Right?
or tickets to Monster Truck Jam, or whatever.
monster Truck Jam's not in town.
okay, so then it is, indeed, official business.
exactly.
Exac...? Wh-What...None of this seems strange to you? Hold on.
none of this seems, uh, in the slightest bit off?
I mean, what are these homeowners?
they, uh, big contributors to the governor's campaign, or what?
I have no idea.
and we can't talk to them?
Danny, is there a point coming anytime soon? - Absolutely.
it seems to me like we're taking a case just to protect the governor's friends.
with the governor's task force.
then why does it feel like we are performing janitorial services, blindfolded, I might add.
we've been given a directive, Danny.
Oh, right, I understand.
when McGarrett gets an order, he takes the order.
you know what you're like?
you're like one of those windup toy soldiers.
let me get you a drum for Christmas to beat.
the last time we butted heads with Denning, he sent Lori home.
I don't want to see what he's got planned for an encore, do you?
okay, here are some basics.
the homeowners' names are Wendy and Patrick Duggan.
I checked into their passport records.
they landed in Katmandu last week.
according to their itinerary, they're halfway into their hike.
well, confirms what Governor Denning told us.
how do you think the cell service is on Everest?
I can't imagine it's too good.
we got any signs of forced entry?
no. Other than the Duggans, the caretaker's the only one who claims to have a set of keys.
HPD checked his alibi.
it's airtight.
Max give us a COD?
he hasn't posted the vic yet, but based on the bruising around her neck, he's thinking she was strangled.
maybe it was a crime of passion, right?
killer's having sex with the vic, then he gets a little rough, things spin out of control.
you got anything else?
Yeah. Max found traces of a powdery substance around her left clavicle.
he sent it over to Fong for processing.
I got an I. D.on our vic.
her name is Serena Andrews.
HPD had her in their database.
what was she cited for?
solicitation.
Houston, we've got a problem.
so we have a working girl killed in a Kahala mansion belonging to good friends of the governor.
two questions: did the governor know her, and did he know that she was a prostitute?
and if he did, is he involved?
you like the way this is going?
no, I don't.
Serena didn't make it home last night.
not exactly a big deal.
so she often stays out all night?
look, I'm her roommate, not her mother.
but she is a friend of yours?
Yeah.
how long you guys been here?
six months.
mollie, do you know that Serena was cited for solicitation?
that was over a year ago.
what about you-- you ever been busted?
I'm a student.
pretty pricey place. Student loans cover this?
I don't like what you're insinuating.
I'm not insinuating; I'm asking.
what's an all-night trick go for these days-- two, three grand?
what I do with my body is my business.
and when a body shows up dead, it's ours.
Oh, my God.
she was found dead at 3500 Hunukai Street in Kahala.
do you know that address?
no.
truth.
look, Serena didn't usually work with locals, okay?
just high-end tourists or conventioneers.
how did she hook up with the johns?
there's this thing called the Internet.
maybe you've heard of it.
Where's your laptop?
so, if we can find the last john Serena booked, it could lead back to our killer.
her clientele wouldn't use their real names, though, would they?
probably not.
then again, the guys we're dealing with usually aren't thinking with their heads.
not the big one anyway.
okay, okay, copy that.
let's just get Serena's laptop over to Fong and see if he can trace the last IP address.
that could be a while.
Why?
what's wrong?
black SUV two cars back-- you see it?
Oh, hello.
Yeah, it's been tailing us for the last two miles.
Yeah, okay, thanks, Max.
Hey.
Tod on Serena Andrews was between 11: 00 and 12: 00 last night.
Max just confirmed that she had sexual intercourse just prior to the murder.
so there's DNA.
Max just put a rush order on it.
lab should have some answers any time soon.
I just got off the phone with the lab.
did we get a hit?
I don't know.
you just said you got off the phone with the lab.
I did, yeah, and they told me they are on strict orders not to rush the testing.
orders from whom?
governor Denning's office.
SUV's still on us.
that's three straight lefts.
doubt they're looking for a parking spot.
how do you want to play it?
hold on.
Five-O! Get out of the car now!
Hey, hey!
what the hell was all that about?
I don't know, but did you catch the plates?
G" ride, yeah, government issue.
commander, Commander, you cannot go in there.
am I running this investigation or not?
give us a minute, please.
don't ever do that again.
why'd you ask me to take over this case if you're going to interfere?
there is a chain of command here, and you're not anywhere near the top.
there is a state vehicle surveilling my team.
sir, the lab can't process the DNA on your orders.
why are you blocking every move I make?
my orders are not subject to your scrutiny, Commander.
what the hell are you hiding, Governor?
just what the hell are you implying?
the dead girl-- you knew she was a prostitute.
the DNA we found on the body-- is it yours?- No.
is it yours, Governor? - No!
no, I did not know the victim was a prostitute, and no, it is not my DNA.
I don't know what to believe here, sir.
when I run that DNA...
who is it going to trace back to?
congressman Christopher Freed?
Yes, our soon- to-be senator.
I don't understand.
politics, Commander, plain and simple.
protect your flank at all costs.
protect your ass is what you mean.
Chris Freed and I go a long way back.
I told him I'd help out any way I can.
he needed a place in town to stay, I knew these party donors who were away, so I arranged it for him to stay at their house
the same house Serena Andrews' body was found in.
okay, why didn't you tell me the truth when you handed me the case?
because a scandal like this could ruin a good man's life and his chances of being elected.
you didn't think I was gonna find out?
I was hoping to contain your findings as they came in, determine if they were credible.
if they were, act accordingly.
you have to understand, Chris Freed is a Medal of Honor recipient, chairman of the Veteran Affairs Committee.
and now he's a suspect in a homicide investigation.
he is also my friend, Commander.
we served together.
of all people, you know what that means.
and, may I add, he is also a devoted single father, so I wanted to be damn sure that the facts were straight before we rip his life apart.
with all due respect...we just found a dead prostitute in his bed.
so I have to ask you-- as his friend, I have got to ask you...
do you think it's possible Congressman Freed could have killed this woman?
I don't know.
okay, you know what we call this in police work? - What?
congressman CHRIS FREED'S OFFICE WAIKIKI
a complete and total waste of time.
just listen to me.
anybody knows where the congressman is, it's going to be his press secretary.
he's not gonna tell us anything.
these people lie for a living-- you know that, right?
this guy. - All right, we got anything over there?
excuse me, Josh Lowry?
I'll have to call you back.
uh, yeah, who are you?
steve McGarrett. This is Detective Danny Williams.
we're with Five-O. - Hi.
Hey, we're looking for Congressman Freed.
Yeah, Five-O, thank you guys for coming down, and you know the congressman is a huge supporter of the law enforcement community.
uh, can we get you guys anything-- coffee or water?
no, we're good, we just want a minute with the congressman.
Yeah, you know what?
I-I wish you guys had called.
I could have saved you the trouble.
due to the accelerated campaign schedule, the congressman-- he's, he's wall-to-wall today, guys, he's very busy.
very busy.
Yeah, slammed actually, but I'm sure I can answer any questions you guys might have on the issues.
I-I have a question, actually.
Yeah, maybe you could tell us, what's the congressman's position on dead hookers found in his bed?
strangled dead hookers.
um, you know, why don't we, uh, why don't we speak in private?
sure.
no, there's no way.
there's got to be some kind of mistake.
the congressman would never get involved with a prostitute.
his stand on the exploitation of sex workers is very clear, and as far as murder goes...
let me guess, he's completely against it.
do you even know the congressman?
uh, about as much as you can know somebody in a 15-second sound bite.
okay.
all I'm saying is, spend ten minutes with the man.
you'd be absolutely convinced at how outrageous your accusations are.
now, if this country had more men like Congressman Freed...
there'd be a chicken in every pot and a dead ho in every bed, right?
look, uh, I've been with him since his days in the State House. Okay?
I'm not saying he's perfect but pretty damn close, and the mere suggestion that he could be possibly involved in something like this is incredibly insulting to him, to his family, and to his legacy.
okay, that is a, a beautiful speech.
okay, where is he?
Mr. Lowry, if the congressman is as big on law enforcement as you say, then you understand, we have to do our job.
now, where is he?
we're not going to ask you again.
geez. Ah, boy.
we've been spinning all morning to cover for him.
Oh, you don't even know where he is?
no, we don't.
you didn't think to tell anybody?
look, the political reality is this: the special election is a nail-biter.
we haven't had any time to campaign.
now, any little thing could tip the scales.
now, if news got out that Freed was off the grid, yeah, let's just say that'd be bad.
no, no, I'll tell you what'd be bad.
bad would be "Breaking News Story: Congressman Freed, Suspect in a Homicide.
Josh, level with us.
all right, where do you think he is?
all I can think is that he and Amy are somewhere, holed up, preparing for the debate.
who's Amy?
Amy Davidson-- she's Freed's chief of staff, one of his closest confidants. She runs the campaign.
well, where is she, Josh?
I don't know, I don't, I really don't.
I'm assuming with him.
so, if I'm Congressman Freed in the middle of a special election, and something goes wrong...
who's the first person you call?
my chief of staff Amy Davidson.
right, so you can get together and plan an alibi.
any luck pinging the congressman's phone?
no, no signal.
okay, well, try Amy's.
chances are, we find one, we find the other.
Hey, Steve, hold on, Kono's got something.
you guys aren't gonna believe this.
the lab finally processed the DNA from the dead girl.
they got a hit.
congressman Freed?
no.
then who is it?
the match came back from the National Database to a Ryan Webb.
he's an associate professor of English from Ohio.
he's in town for a mystery writers convention.
what's a teacher doing in the system?
he's employed at a state school. They require DNA for background checks.
uh, the IP address from the hotel matched Serena's last appointment.
according to the hotel, he's scheduled to check out this morning.
I got it.
here, here, let me help you with those bags.
what is this? Who are you?
Five-O. We're extending your stay.
hope you had a nice visit.
please, this is all a colossal mistake.
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
a mistake? Well, why don't you help me understand?
Where's the congressman?
congressman who?
congressman Freed of the great state of Hawaii.
is that supposed to mean something to me? I...
party last night, remember?
mansion in Kahala?
last night?
last night, I-I was on an Elmore Leonard panel, and a bunch of us went to the room to watch Get Shorty.
Yeah, you left the part out about the dead prostitute.
what?
no. No, no, no.
obviously, fiction isn't your strong suit, Professor, 'cause we have your DNA, and it puts you in bed with the hooker at the congressman's house.
look, look, come on.
I'm just an English teacher, okay?
I don't know anything about a congressman, and I didn't kill anybody!
nice wedding ring, by the way.
how long you been married?
wait a minute.
maybe your wife in Ohio knows where you were last night.
let's give her a call, see what she got to say then.
wait, wait, wait.
Serena was alive when I left her.
well, how did you wind up with the congressman?
I didn't. Okay, the girl and I-- we never left the bar.
bar? What bar?
have you ever been to Lima, Ohio?
I mean, come on.
this is Hawaii. I-I just wanted to have fun.
so, I-I found this Website, and Serena-- she agreed to meet me at the Liki Tiki Lounge.
wait a minute. You're telling me you had sex with her at the bar, is that what you're saying?
when-when she showed up, well...
we-we did it in the bathroom.
I've always wanted to do that. Back in Lima...
then what?
then-then she left.
what time was that?
about-about 10: 00.
what did you do after that?
I stayed and had a few more drinks.
same bar? - Yeah. No.
if you don't believe me, you can check my credit card, okay?
I ran a tab, and I cashed out at last call.
bartender confirms seeing Serena Andrews leaving the Liki Tiki Lounge around 10: 00.
well, what about Webb?
credit card checks out. He closed the place.
okay, so, 10: 00 was the last time anybody saw Serena alive.
and with TOD set between 11: 00 and 12: 00...
there's no way Webb could have killed her.
we're back to square one.
not exactly. Just got a call from our friend Josh Lowry.
looks like Freed's Chief of Staff, Amy Davidson, just walked into campaign headquarters.
Josh, where's Amy Davidson?
she's inside with Powers.
Brad Powers. That's, uh, Freed's opponent. What's he doing here?
well, he came by to discuss the ground rules of the debate with the congressman,
I was handling the situation.
then all of a sudden, Amy shows up.
picks up right where she left off, like nothing even happened.
did she say where she was?
no, she didn't.
she went behind closed doors with Powers, they've been in there ever since.
Josh, you disappoint me.
I don't know what kind of campaign you're running here, but I don't buy Amy's spin for a minute.
we're not spinning anything, Mr. Powers.
Really?
then what's Five-O doing here?
that's between us and the congressman, sir.
Yeah, well, when you see him, please ask him why he blew me off last night without so much as a phone call.
what time were you supposed to meet him?
0.458333333333
I've know Chris Freed for 15 years.
he's never pulled a stunt like that.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding, sir.
he said he wanted to run a civil campaign, one with mutual respect and all of that.
this is a hell of a way to show it.
I don't know what you people are hiding, but I'm gonna find out, and when I do, so will the press.
okay. We need to speak to Amy now.
I got Five-O here. They need to talk to you.
miss Davis, where's Congressman Freed?
I don't know, but I think he might have done something terrible.
don't you think I'd help you guys if I could?
I just don't know where he is right now.
okay, so, you-- where have you been?
I was out...looking for him.
look, you don't get it. This is complicated.
then speak slowly, all right?
because I need to understand why a man like Congressman Freed would risk everything to get serviced by a prostitute.
to tell you the truth, I brought her to meet the congressman.
that's a smart move. Why'd you do that?
doesn't happen all the time, but he's under a lot of stress, and he's a single father, so he's on his own.
I mean, besides his daughter, there's...
there's really no one else in his life.
so sometimes he just needs a little companionship for the evening.
so you're chief of staff and part-time madam for him?
come on, the guy's human.
all right, Amy, I have to ask you.
to the best of your knowledge, has the congressman ever hurt any of the women he's been with?
rough stuff doesn't seem to be his thing, but you know, who knows what goes on behind closed doors?
okay, well, something happened last night.
where did you find Serena Andrews?
picked her up at a place called the Liki Tiki Lounge, and I dropped her off at the mansion in Kahala.
no, you delivered her to the congressman, like a pizza.
Yes.
what about the congressman's 11: 00 with Powers?
why did he blow that off?
I don't know.
that's why I went back to the mansion.
but when I got there, he was gone, and I found the girl in the bed.
and being the pragmatic political operative that you are, you decided to go to the governor instead of the police?
because I knew they were friends, and I needed time to think.
to plan a cover-up.
No!
no. Look, something like this has national repercussions.
okay, you need to have a viable strategy.
what time did you pick up Serena Andrews?
9: 00, 9:15?
she was right on time.
am I under arrest?
Amy might be a good chief of staff, but she's a terrible liar.
all right, the professor was shot and now Serena in a bathroom stall at 9: 15.
she didn't leave the bar till 10: 00.
you're right.
if I'm right, then why isn't she under arrest?
cause we still have to find the congressman, and if he's on the run, chances are he's gonna reach out to her.
so let's sit on her phone, post a surveillance team at her door.
exactly, and let Freed come to us.
the thing I want to know is, why is Amy lying?
what do you got?
that powdery substance Max found on the body?
ir Spectroscopy identified it as cornstarch.
cornstarch?
specifically, the type used in surgical gloves.
it makes them easier to pull on and off.
that explains... - Why we didn't find any prints belonging to our killer.
that does not sound like a crime of passion.
that definitely sounds like the killing was premeditated.
so, why would the congressman plan on killing a prostitute he just met?
unless he knew her previously.
or there's something we're not seeing here.
or unless he didn't do it.
so, I traced Amy Davidson's timeline.
guess what? Doesn't add up.
Ah, she was lying.
very shocking.
she said she picked up Serena Andrews from the Liki Tiki Lounge at 9: 15.
but when I ran her credit cards, it turned out, she was having drinks at another place called the Ocean Lounge.
by herself? - She bought two rounds.
two drinks each time.
who she was with?
Josh Lowry, congressman's press secretary.
he confirmed it.
said they were having a strategy session.
he also confirmed that they didn't leave the place together.
according to a bartender I spoke to, she left with an unknown male companion.
we need a positive ID on that companion.
it's gonna be tough.
no security footage from the bar.
I found an ATM camera across the street.
nice.
only thing is, I don't think there's a clear shot of the exit.
not so nice.
okay, easy.
what it did give us was a shot of a police cruiser pulling someone over near the club entrance
we got a dashboard cam?
Yeah, we have a dashboard cam, and I have footage coming through right now.
that's Amy. Freeze, Kono. Freeze that. Can you push in?
looks like she's with someone.
it's Wo Fat.
he's still on the island.
what the hell is he doing with Amy?
he's using Amy Davidson to set up Congressman Freed.
set up for what?
think about it.
who stands to gain if Congressman Freed takes a hard fall?
his opponent, Brad Powers.
wo Fat sees this special election as an opening.
he's on the run, he's got no resources.
what better way to rebuilt your empire than to buy a politician?
right, by discrediting Freed, Powers definitely gets the Senate seat.
and Wo Fat gets a friend in Washington.
quid pro quo.
not on our watch.
you need to start writing.
go to hell.
I expected a more dignified response from a congressman.
cut me loose, and I'll show you how dignified I can can be when I pound the crap out of you.
you're not thinking this through.
why should I sign the equivalent of a suicide note?
that'd be the end of my career, my life.
even if I sign it, you're going to kill me anyway.
a homegrown treasure like you?
a bona fide war hero?
no.
I have too much respect for your accomplishments.
however...
my affections don't extend to your daughter.
where is he?
excuse me?
wo Fat. Where is he?
we know you left the bar with him.
okay, you need to leave.
I don't think you understand who you're dealing with.
no, I said, you need to leave.
everything you've said up to this point is a lie.
all right, the congressman with prostitutes, you bringing 'em to him, all of it.
okay, I can't talk to you guys about this right now.
get this through your head, okay?
if Freed's not dead already, Wo Fat will kill him.
you understand what I'm saying?
you can stop this.
you can stop all of this, but you have to start talking to us.
where is Congressman Freed?
where is he, Amy?
what are you doing?
don't shush me. What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I did it because he said he was gonna kill me.
listen to me, where is he keeping the congressman hostage?
I don't know! - Amy...
I really don't know.
get down. Amy, get down!
I don't see him, Steve.
everybody, get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!
there goes our lead to the congressman.
what is that?
wo Fat?
Hey, Chin, we need a trace right away.
I'm sorry, Congressman.
looks like there's been a change in plans.
geez, brah. You scared me.
I thought you was a pig.
think of how much easier this could've been if you had just signed that letter.
get lower to the ground!
come on, come on. Go closer!
grab his leg!
come on!
come on!
he's hit! Let's go! Come on!
how bad is it?
bad! We need a hospital right now! Go!
wo Fat, Danny!
forget it, let's go! Forget it!
let's go! Come on! Come on!
so, how's the congressman?
no major organs were hit, just soft tissue damage.
he's gonna be all right.
all right.
what about Wo Fat?
the entire department is searching the jungle.
got a perimeter set up, helicopter in the air, everything.
you find anything in the abandoned house?
Yeah, a cell phone.
wo Fat left it-- must've been in a rush to chase down the congressman.
and judging by the call log, looks like we were right.
he was trying to buy himself a powerful ally.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you so mu...
nice to see you again, Mr. Powers.
relax.
what the hell are you doing?
bad taste in friends, buddy.
Bradley Powers, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.
would you please stop? Please? We didn't have a choice.
we had to let Wo Fat go.
and we are going to find him. I promise. Okay?
you mind if I join you guys?
Hey. Of course, Governor.
sit, sit. We're not on the clock.
Oh, uh, I got to take this. Sit down, please.
your brand?
Yes, sir.
thank you.
what's the occasion?
powers cracked under questioning.
he admitted he was in bed with Wo Fat.
Really?
Yeah. He almost pulled that one off, huh?
I owe you.
no, sir. Just doing the job.
no. You went above and beyond, Commander. And...
I'm sorry.
sir?
I should've been straight with you from the start.
trust - it, um...
well, it's a mighty big word.
Yeah, it is.
and if I may...
of course. I'm sitting in shorts, drinking beer with you.
all right, fire away and don't hold back.
I got a lot of respect for you, sir.
got a lot of respect for the office.
but if this thing between us is gonna work out then...
honesty is the best policy.
your predecessor, she didn't believe in that and, uh...
well, it got her killed.
that was her. This is me.
to Five-O.
all right.
Hey. Hey.
you all good?
she's not moving.
grace?
the judge ruled in my favor-- shared custody.
she cannot leave the island.
she cannot leave the island.
Congratulations. - Thank you, buddy.
Congratulations.
thank you.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
uh, the judge said that your courtroom behavior was completely unacceptable - Oh, come on.
and despicable, but she also said that you were a fantastic character witness, so thank you very much.
you're welcome.
I'll remind you of that later.
I'm sure you will.
well done, gentlemen.
I can't believe I'm actually happy to be staying here.
neither can I.
to Hawaii.
to Hawaii.
to, uh...
to Hawaii. Okay. Okay.
to Hawaii.
ladies, I give you our very own Honolulu Hercules
come on, let's flash those bills and get some thrills!
Hey, Brad, baby! Over here! - Tina!
over here! - You guys! This is crazy!
relax! You are not gonna be "Mrs. Bob Johnson" till Sunday.
okay, stop it. Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
I am, like, God, that guy was, like, so hot. - Get the numbers.
all of you have to swear you cannot tell Bob about any of this.
uh, pictures don't lie, girlfriend.
you're so nasty! - Tina! You didn't...!
oops! I just tweeted it.
Oh, my God!
I'm kidding.
relax!
Bob the Snob is never gonna find out.
there. Gone.
all right, girls, where do you want to go? - Another strip club.
what do you say-- Danzibar?
Yes!
let's get this party started!
is everyone okay? - I think so.
Oh, my God, that guy has a gun. - What?
Hello?
I see you met Brittany.
I see you haven't changed.
shoot me if I ever do.
God, it's good to see you, Steve.
been too long, man.
come on, sit down.
put your dogs up.
I'll buy you a drink.
so, uh, I hear you're running some kind of a task force now.
glad to see your talents haven't gone to waste.
same goes for you, pal.
looks like the private sector's paying well.
Yeah, well, after 25 years in Navy Intel, it was either hang a shingle or buy a rocking chair, so... I hung a shingle.
that's why I came to see you, Mick.
I want to hire you for your services.
I need a full surveillance package on this target.
who is she?
it's my mother.
kid, you don't need a P. I. You need a therapist.
trust me, she's not your average mom.
she's a former government agent.
she disappeared from my life 20 years ago because of an assignment, now she's back...
says she's changed.
I don't believe her.
she goes dark a few hours every day.
she racks up too many miles on the odometer.
I want to know what she's up to.
well, why come to me? You've got the resources to handle this.
no, I don't want my people involved.
besides, there's no one better than you at recon and surveillance.
full surveillance package means I'm on her 24/7.
that's audio, stills, video...
good chance I'll see your mother naked.
okay, you know, I didn't need to know that. - Just saying. Just saying.
on the way.
name is Thomas Hoapili, 46 years old, ran a local wholesale fish market, widowed, one daughter
Maggie Hoapili, 21 years old, lives in Miliani.
all right, what about the witnesses in the other car
they see anything?
all they saw were two people in hoodies put three slugs in our vic before dumping the weapon and fleeing the scene.
Max confirms that was the cause of death.
okay, so Thomas was alive before the accident.
question is, what was he doing in the trunk?
maybe a kidnapping gone bad?
no, why kill your bargaining chip?
no, he's right.
if this was a K&R, shooters would've fled the scene, picked up Thomas another day.
what else do we know?
uh, we ran the car they were driving;it was reported stolen two days ago from a rental car company at Honolulu International.
HPD's processing.
okay, what about the murder weapon?
it is a Smith & Wesson . 45.
Fong's working his magic right now.
all right.
this accident happened two blocks away from the H1 on-ramp.
I'm thinking these guys were trying to get out of town, drive him to a remote location, kill him there-- this was an execution.
so Fong ran ballistics on the murder weapon and pulled a partial print.
says he's got something we need to see.
Hey, Charlie, what do you got?
that partial I pulled got a hit in AFIS.
who is it?
I'll show you.
you're not gonna like it.
look, I got nothing to do with this.
I loved Thomas. He was my cousin.
I gotta go see Maggie...
Hey, hey, sit down.
chin and Kono are going over there.
right now you need to tell us what's going on.
I don't know. I swear.
look, Thomas and I, we was tight.
he the only was waiting for me when I got out of Halawa.
only one believed in me when nobody in the family would.
gave me money to start my first shave ice stand.
I owe him everything.
you guys are sweating the wrong guy.
okay. That's fine.
but you got to explain to me why your prints are all over our murder weapon.
killers must've took it from Thomas
a gun that I gave him.
you... you gave him a gun?
for protection.
protection from what?
he didn't say.
Ah, see, I don't believe that.
it's the truth.
my cousin needed help, I help him.
that's the way it works.
you understand that, Steve.
you do know that trafficking in illegal firearms... - All right.
you think of anything else, you give us a call, all right? - Absolutely.
you gonna get in the car?
no, I'm not gonna get in the car until you tell me what is going on in that goofy head of yours.
excuse me?
the, uh, shrimp king knew something and you just let him go.
that's right.
Why?
trust me.
goofy head, huh?
stop gloating and drive. Let's go.
go, go, go!
you're following me.
no, I wasn't. - Oh, really?
well, I suggest you try something with a little more fiber, because, clearly, you're full of crap.
okay, all right, all right, all right, guilty as charged.
I was just looking for an opportunity to say hello.
what, were you gonna ask my help deciding what cantaloupes are ripe?
close, close.
actually, it's grape related.
I was... I was going to ask for a wine recommendation.
Ah, wine recommendation.
you look like the kind of woman who appreciates the finer things in life, and so I ask you,"Which of these do you think goes better with a grilled... branzino?"
all right, branzino is a fish, so you're gonna want to go with a white, not a red, and I got to say, that is probably the worst pickup line I have ever heard.
Oh, well.
can't blame a guy for trying.
all right. Let's make a deal.
you take me out to lunch, and I will tell you everything I know about wine pairings.
gun?
what...
why did my father need a gun?
we were hoping you could tell us.
can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt him?
no.
everybody loved him.
my father didn't have any enemies.
was he doing anything unusual?
anything out of the ordinary?
nothing was out of the ordinary when it came to my dad.
what do you mean?
he had a routine.
you could set your clock by it.
monday through Saturday, he opened this place at 4: 30 in the morning, closed at 9: 00at night.
then it was dinner, whatever novel he was reading, then off to bed.
Sunday we went to church, and Tuesday nights, we'd go hit golf balls at the Ala Wai driving range.
and what about last night?
when I left work, he was still in his office.
tell me about this commendation from HPD.
Oh, last year someone tried to rob us.
my dad took his gun away and held him until the police showed up.
was he ever worried about payback?
do you think that's why my father was murdered?
hands on the hood.
get them on the hood.
what's up, buddy? ' - Sup?
I don't know; you tell me.
wow, now, this is insult to injury.
this guy's got The Guns of Navarone.
let me see your hands.
this is obviously not gonna work.
you got a bike chain in the trunk or what?
Thanks, brother. That hurt my feelings. - Turn around.
Hey, you want to explain this?
why'd you lie to us?
I didn't lie, technically.
what do you mean,"technically"?
I just wasn't completely forthcoming.
okay, well, now's your chance to, uh, be completely forthcoming.
this lolo, Quentin Thorne, tried to rob my cousin last year.
thomas got him put away.
he was thinking his brother, Eddie, was looking for revenge.
well, why would Thomas think that?
he seen Eddie hanging around the fish market the last few weeks.
why didn't he just call the cops?
he did. Cops told him if Eddie doesn't threaten him, there's nothing they can do.
okay, so what, Thomas came to you for a gun?
I was taking care of Ohana.
his daughter, Maggie...
thomas was the only one she had.
now the kid got nobody.
all because Eddie Thorne got his payback.
all right, so you thought you'd come down here and get a little payback yourself, is that right?
no, no, no, I just was gonna scare him, make him confess, make a citizen's arrest.
a citizen's arrest.
that's good. You know how stupid that sounds?
in retrospect, yes.
I had to do something.
Yeah, but this ain't it, buddy.
okay? You do this, you're gonna end up in prison, and we do not want that.
I'm touched.
Oh, don't-don't give me a puppy-dog sad eyes, please.
okay? You're not off the hook.
you're on house arrest till this I over.
I've got an island to feed.
okay, then you are on shrimp truck lockdown till otherwise advised. Is that clear?
like the sweet waters of Hanauma Bay.
so which one's Eddie's house?
second one on the left with all the tacky lawn trolls.
clear.
what do you got? - I have photography.
I got a logbook.
pier 38.
dates and times last couple weeks.
Oh, look at this.
looks like Eddie was keeping an eye on Thomas, working out a good time to grab him.
Hey, you Eddie Thorne?
Seriously?
Oh, dude, you broke Chucky.
Yeah.
you killed Thomas Hoapili.
you're under arrest.
just 'cause I had pictures of the guy doesn't mean I killed him.
no, I guess not, but Thomas did put your brother, Quentin, in prison and revenge is a pretty strong motive.
Yeah, you'd be right if I gave a damn about my brother.
dumb punk deserves to be in jail.
that market job was a bad play.
he's a good liar, too. That's a survival skill.
you're gonna need it when you get to prison.
I'm not going down for this murder.
you don't get a vote.
look, man, I was just trying to rob the guy.
cause it went so well for your brother?
Quentin liked to stick up convenience stores for pocket change.
that market did big money.
some of those tuna go for six figures.
Quentin was out of his league.
he didn't have a plan for that job, I did.
so you did your homework.
Yeah, you're damn right I did.
I cased that place for weeks.
I clocked every move Hoapili made.
if he hadn't got himself killed, I'd be set for life.
I got something you need to see.
okay, so Maggie said her father was still at work when she left last night, right?
so I pulled the footage from a security camera on pier 38.
now, that is Thomas Hoapili.
notice the time stamp.
he closed up shop at 9: 15.
but that's not Eddie Thorne, is it?
no, I ran matrix; he's too tall.
the other perp is a female.
brown hair;five foot, seven. I got a better look at her.
their vehicle matches the stolen rental from the crash site, and both perps match our witness description.
chin, run that back.
thomas is empty-handed.
the other two never go back into the store to grab anything after they take him down.
this wasn't a robbery.
all right, the crash happened at 2: 43 a. m.right?
that's right. Well, this is time-stamped 9: 15 p. m.
so what happened in the five and a half hours before Thomas turned up dead?
this was a great choice.
from now on, I only drink Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley.
well, the best Pinots are from Burgundy, if you can afford it, but give me a smooth, inexpensive Oregon Pinot any day of the week.
you really do know your wines.
I do.
lucky I bumped into you.
well, likewise.
here's to, um, what, uh, your Hawaiian vacation.
thank you.
what's so funny?
uh, no, I just, um, I can't believe I'm actually dining with royalty.
do they really call you the fabric king of Ohio?
fabric is my life.
for fabrics, drapes, upholstery. There's only one real place to be. The one and only fabric king of Ohio, give us a ring.
Oh, God, that's just awful.
I know, isn't it?
but that little jingle has kept my family in business for over 75 years.
so, enough about me.
I want to know about you.
what, you mean when I'm not making wine recommendations?
Yeah, yeah, what do you do?
how do you spend your days?
well, I was a schoolteacher.
retired now, and after 25 years of chalk dust, uh,
I prefer to spend my days outdoors.
that explains your extraordinary figure.
okay, I think you've really had a little too much to drink.
no, no, no, it's just my Midwestern honesty.
Oh, that's-that's got to be it.
sorry.
Oh, it's just...
Oh, I'm sorry.
it's the factory; I got to take this.
one of the looms is on the fritz.
Oh, the looms, yes. - Sorry, excuse me.
Absolutely.
yeah?
Hey, what'd you find?
nothing.
subject left the house at approximately 10: 30.
took a walk on the beach.
got her nails done; French tips, by the way.
as far as I can see, she's got nothing to hide.
I told you she's good, okay?
you want to find something, you got to dig deeper.
well, it's your dime, kid.
if my shovel hits something, I'll call you.
Yeah, okay, good.
problem?
no.
then why are you staring at me?
you hired somebody to run surveillance on your mother?
okay, I know what you're gonna say.
well, what am I gonna say? - That hiring somebody to spy on their mother is the act of a crazy person.
uh, yeah, I would've used different words like, uh,"whack job" or "psychopath."
"crazy" works, though. It works.
Yeah, I had no choice, Danny, okay?
have you ever tried speaking to your mother like a... like a human being, like normal people do?
what am I going to say?"Mom, I know you're running a covert op. What is it?"
Yeah, that would work. - Oh, okay.
look, if she's in the game, why don't you confront her?
right?
I mean, don't bring in an outside source.
she finds out that her son put a tail on her,
I promise you... I promise it will end badly.
it's not going to end badly.
this guy wrote the book on surveillance.
my mother is never going to see it coming.
how are the looms?
Oh, just weaving away.
good. Good to hear.
Oh, I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty of ordering another bottle of wine.
well, if I drink any more wine, I might do something I regret.
I hope so.
I confirmed the C. O.D. was multiple gunshot wounds.
however, it's what happened to Mr. Hoapili prior to being shot that's quite interesting.
take a look.
a shattered jaw, six broken ribs, signs of internal bleeding and a fractured sacroiliac.
that would be a joint in the pelvis.
I knew that. - No, you didn't.
you didn't know it, either.
okay, uh, if you two are finished, I'd like to continue.
Max, could all of this have been a result of the accident?
no. The trunk never sustained any damage due to the crash, so Mr. Hoapili suffered his extensive trauma elsewhere.
okay, so he was picked up, he was beaten, dumped in the trunk like this.
that would be correct.
and the extent of his injuries, left unattended, would have killed Mr. Hoapili, whether or not he had been shot.
and then there's this.
these cuts and contusions on his knuckles are defensive wounds.
quite severe.
which can only mean one thing.
thomas was in a fight.
not just a fight, but the fight of his life.
Hey.
glad to see you're following Steve's orders and staying put.
I took it to heart.
working is therapeutic.
otherwise, I let my emotions get the better of me.
I'm so sorry.
you hungry? I can whip some of these up for you.
no. I'm good. I'm good.
I could use your eyes on something, though.
you recognize them?
I might if you had a better picture.
I wish I did.
these the two that killed my cousin?
right now they're suspects.
mind if I keep that?
show your suspects to my people? - Sure.
but you got to promise to call us first if you get a name.
I learned my lesson.
I promise.
okay.
take care.
Yeah, Chin.
you remember when Maggie told us she and her father went to the driving range?
Yeah, Tuesday nights?
Yeah.
I had HPD canvass all of Thomas's known associates.
the owners of Ala Wai Golf say they haven't seen Thomas and Maggie there in years.
Kono, if Maggie lied to us about hitting golf balls with her father,
I wonder what else she told us that wasn't true.
Yeah.
Maggie, can we talk to you for a moment?
do you have any news?
what was your father really doing Tuesday nights?
what are you talking about?
he wasn't hitting golf balls.
what was he really doing?
uh, would you guys give us a minute?
thank you.
it would save us a lot of time if you told us the truth.
I can't tell you.
look, Maggie, I know all about wanting to protect the reputation of your family, but if your father was mixed up in something that got him killed, you need to tell us now.
you know nothing about my father.
you covering for someone else?
if you don't tell us, we're going to need to bring you in for impeding a homicide investigation.
all right, if that's the way you want to play it, that's fine by me. - You can't do this.
watch me.
Maggie, what is so important you'd risk going to jail?
I told you I have nothing to say.
all right.
well, if you're not going to talk to us, maybe you'll talk to someone else.
uncle.
Maggie, I know what you're feeling, cause I'm feeling it, too.
but you have to cooperate with these people.
you need to trust them.
they're only here to help us.
Maggie, your father was beaten within an inch of his life.
if you want to protect the people who did this, go right ahead.
you told me my father was shot.
he was, but that was after somebody used him as a punching bag.
no. It's impossible.
the picture doesn't lie.
no one could beat my father that way.
he was the best.
best?
best at what?
whatever you know, please tell these guys.
have you ever heard of Kapu Kuialua?
Lua.
it's the ancient Hawaiian martial art, primarily hand-to-hand combat.
what's that got to do with your father's murder?
my father was an Olohe, a Lua master, and I'm his student.
why didn't Thomas ever tell me?
we kept it secret.
the practice was outlawed by the Colonial powers because they felt threatened by it.
some traditionalists still believe that training should only be done in secret, and only by native Hawaiian men.
well, if only by men, then how did you get involved?
my father wanted to pass on his legacy, and I'm an only child.
he made me swear never to tell outsiders what we were doing.
for eight years, he trained me secretly.
let me guess
on Tuesday nights.
you said "outsiders."
so, who were the insiders?
my father didn't just train me. There were others.
how many?
he trained about two dozen men on his compound out in Waimea.
Maggie, what are you doing bringing these people here?
Shane, just hear them out.
Mr. Kawano, I'm Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly.
this is Officer Kalakaua, Five-O.
we're here to investigate the murder of Thomas Hoapili.
thomas Hoapili wouldn't want you here.
this is private property. You're trespassing.
this is my family's property. These officers are welcome here. They need our help.
for my father, please.
before Thomas was shot, he was in a fight.
in fact, he was almost beaten to death.
do you recognize either of them?
no. I'm sorry.
can you think of anyone who might have wanted him dead?
I've run this pa Lua for Thomas for nine years.
in all that time, I've never known him to have any enemies, especially among.
it's what I told you.
thomas wasn't just a Lua master;
he was our patron.
he allowed us to use his land. His money paid for our classes.
we looked up to him.
doesn't mean that someone here didn't have a motive to hurt him.
no one could match my father's abilities.
no one here would lay a hand on him, because no one could.
well, someone did.
and if anyone here was in a fight, there'd be signs of injuries, so we're going to have to check everyone.
starting with you.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Chin.
he just finished a visual examination of all the students, looking for trauma. He also ran alibis.
doesn't look like any of them had anything to do with the murder.
guys. - Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
thought I told you to stay put. - I got something.
showed the fuzzy picture around and got the girl's name: Kat Carrigan.
who is she?
Ex-MMA fighter with mad skills in Muay Thai.
got herself banned from legal competition for all sorts of rule violations.
got her.
Kat Carrigan. According to TSA, she arrived on the island two days ago from Bangkok.
clear.
check this out.
his name is Ramsey Pollock.
flew into Oahu two days ago.
same flight as Kat Carrigan.
what do we know about him?
he's American, 33 years old.
he was the former MMA heavyweight contender.
he's proficient in six different martial arts, and he lives most of the year in Brussels.
well, looks like Pollock's been racking up some serious frequent flyer miles.
the past four months, he's been in six different countries, including Russia, Colombia and, most recently, Thailand.
according to authorities, he is suspected in all of those countries of running illegal fights.
now, these are high-stakes underground bouts where wealthy fans pay big bucks to sit ringside.
there's no rules, there's no refs.
people die.
this guy's also got a reputation for defeating every style of fighter that he's ever gone up against.
unfortunately, every time law enforcement gets close to bringing him down, Pollock disappears.
of course, no witnesses? - Right.
well, what's the first rule of fight club?
you do not talk about fight club.
no, nobody's talking about it, but people are paying top dollar to sit ringside at these fights.
26 wire transfers in the last 48 hours, each for 100 grand.
that's almost $2. 5 million.
so, looks like Pollock brought his fight club to Oahu.
okay, so he comes here, he kidnaps Thomas Hoapili, forces him onto the fight card.
now, if Pollock fought every other type of fighter and won, he needed to up the ante.
offer the fight fans something worth paying for.
and fighting an elusive Lua master, now that makes it a hot ticket.
but then why stick around?
I mean, after that car crash, Pollock would be an idiot not to flee the island.
Ah, but maybe Pollock and Thomas was just the undercard.
what are you talking about?
Pollock just wired half a million dollars into Kat Carrigan's account, just this morning.
so, what, payment for helping him grab Thomas?
either that or a purse for another fight.
well, two underground fight nights are certainly more profitable than one.
so if our vic was the undercard, maybe Carrigan is the main event.
I think we might know who her opponent is.
Hello?
Maggie, it's Lieutenant Kelly.
where are you?
it was Pollack and Carrigan.
security cam confirms it.
I already called in the vehicle.
Kono pulled Pollack and Carrigan's phone records.
20 international calls made in the last three hours.
she cross-referenced the numbers with TSA, got names and passports.
bunch of rich guys flew in on private jets. According to TSA, they're still here.
you were right. There's a second fight.
Hey, guys?
did you find them? - I'm still working on that.
but I just found four calls to a local number on Pollock's call log.
they all go to Shane Kawano.
why the hell's he talking to our killer?
every fight needs a promoter, right?
Shane, what's going on?
your father gave me no choice.
after all he did for you?
you son of a bitch.
he treated you like a brother!
I gave my soul to that school, but I was always still in his shadow.
that's the way he liked it.
what are you talking about?
I went to him.
I showed him what we could do.
the money we both could make.
how we could open the school to outsiders, teach them.
so you had him murdered because he wouldn't exploit Lua?
because he wouldn't sell out?
is that it? - Hey!
your father was an extreme traditionalist.
he was living in the Stone Age.
and when you inherited his mantle, you would have been as stubborn as he was.
but with us out of the way, you could just cash in.
you're the one who killed my father.
save your strength.
gonna need it.
it looks like they're consolidated in Diamond Head.
446 Alapali Place.
it's listed as a private residence-- beach rental.
this is what you made my father do?
I won't fight!
get up!
get up!
get up! Fight!
fight!
get up! Fight!
get her! Get her!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
you want to hit someone, come hit me.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
going somewhere?
hope you had a fantastic evening.
these nice gentlemen with the hats and the guns, they're gonna take you to jail.
thank you very much for your patronage. Come on.
Kawano had my father killed.
and he's going to jail for the rest of his life for that.
come on, I got you.
Yeah. Are you okay？
Yes.
uncle, what are you still doing here?
you should go home.
I'll be fine.
through thick and thin, your pops... always there for me.
I'm always gonna be there for you.
Hey, we missed you surfing yesterday morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had something else to do, you know.
yeah? What's going on?
Oh, nothing. No, it's just some, uh, work-related stuff.
so...
well, I can't believe that you passed up my grandmother's ragu for a beef stew MRE.
I had a craving.
for military rations?
can you do me a favor and pass me that canteen behind you there, please?
you know what, I got my camo in the car.
if you want, I can throw them on and we can play out this whole "trapped in a foxhole"
fantasy thing you got going on right now.
I'll put this beef stew down right now. - You love the foxhole fantasy, don't you?
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Catherine, could you quick just help me with this?
Yeah. Oh.
Doris, you look amazing.
thank you. - What's the occasion?
I've got a date.
sorry, what?
that's probably him.
Yes, I think it's just stuck in kind of a thing there, see?
what are you doing here?
you told me to keep an eye on your mother.
an eye, not hand. Not any other part of your body. She's my mother.
Steve, at my age, they're all mothers or grandmothers.
what can I tell you? We got chemistry.
Anthuriums.
Oh, they're so beautiful. Thank you.
um, Mick, this is Catherine.
Catherine, this is Mick. - Hi. How are you?
Hi. Very nice to meet you, Mick. - How you doing?
and I think you already know Steve.
um, I'll just put these in water.
you want to wait in the car or...
Yeah, but, uh, don't be too long,'cause we got reservations.
got it.
Oh, Doris, let me take the flowers.
Oh, thank you.
chemistry.
you know, if you wanted to know what I was up to, you could have just asked.
don't wait up.
eyes on the target.
take him out.
all clear. Target acquired.
damn, guys! That hurts. For real.
let's go again.
very funny, Scott. Game's over. Come on.
time to get up.
Oh, my God.
Aloha, Honolulu.
looks like a bright and beautiful day as we kick off another Pro Bowl weekend.
the NFL's biggest stars are in town, and if you want to see them, live at Hawaiian Airlines Field at Aloha Stadium tomorrow,
I'll be giving away tickets to the tenth caller.
what's up, babe?
Aloha, fellas. Can I interest you in today's Pro Bowl lunch special?
the only thing special about that is that you jacked the prices up by 300%.
you know how it is, McGarrett. Supply and demand.
big cuz here knows how to supersize da profits.
okay, thanks, Flippa, but we're not here for lunch anyways.
no. Where are my Pro Bowl tickets, babe? Come on.
one row up from the AFC sideline.
just like you asked. - Nice.
my man. What are we doing? We got three here.
no, we only want two. Just two, me and Danny.
third one's for me.
consider it a convenience charge.
convenience? Convenience to who?
me. - Yeah, I got that.
you gonna fork up some cash or what?
what are you talking about? It was your idea to get the big sideline seats.
now you want me to pay for 'em?
Yeah, what gives?
why did you have to sit so close to the field?
Yeah.
it's none of your... - Tell him why.
okay, okay, because Peyton Manning is playing, okay, and I'd like a chance to meet him.
I thought the Jets was your team.
the Jets are my team, okay, but this is the one game of the year where I just get to be a fan, a fan of the sport.
no specific teams. I'm just a fan enjoying the game, and I am not gonna miss my opportunity to meet the greatest quarterback of our generation.
okay, wait a minute. Stop. - Stop what?
the greatest quarterback of our generation?
that's what I said.
first of all, greatness is measured in championships. Am I wrong?
and if we go by that measure, Tom Brady,
Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of our generation.
he has three rings to Manning's one. - I knew you would say something stupid like that.
three to one. - Listen, Tom Brady is fantastic. He's great.
he's got good hair, he's got a supermodel wife, he's got the chin, the Cary Grant chin, yeah.
but Peyton is without question a better passer.
you're out of your mind.
gentlemen. - What?
debating on which one of those guys are better is pointless.
it's like arguing about who's the greatest rock and roll band of all time, the Beatles or the Stones?
Oh, it's easy. - The Beatles.
of course the Brady fan says the Beatles. See this?
look, I think the takeaway is we're living in the new golden age of quarterbacks.
we got Brady, Manning, Rodgers, Brees.
it's almost an embarrassment of riches.
that's a deeply insightful analysis.
I just hate to see you two guys fight. Fighting?
- This isn't fighting. McGarrett.
so let me get this straight. You're telling me people, they pay good money to get chased around and shot at with a pellet gun?
everything about these guns is real except for the ammunition they fire.
trust me, those training rounds, they pack more of a punch than you'd think.
I'll take your word for it. - You know what?
we should come and do one of these tactical simulations sometime.
it's fantastic for team building.
no, no, no. Listen, working with you is harrowing enough, okay?
I do not need you hunting me for sport.
Oh, you're right. It wouldn't be much of a challenge.
vic's name is Scott Davis.
worked for Ardus Microsystems, a technology firm based out of California.
a bunch of executives flew in for a corporate retreat, and they booked out the entire facility for themselves.
looks like a nine-mil through and through.
and the powder burns indicate it was fired from close range.
okay, these guys are running around shooting each other with pellet guns, this guy gets hit with a real bullet. How does that happen?
that's a good question to which I don't have an answer.
and to make things a little more challenging for us, there are no surveillance cameras on the property.
that's great.
but the good news is that all the players were wearing action cameras.
that is good news. Maybe one of them caught our killer in the act.
I've broken down the rifles used in the simulation.
barrels measure out at seven millimeters.
even if you modify the firing mechanism, there's no way one these could have discharged a nine-mil round.
okay, so that means somebody had to have a real gun.
wouldn't be hard to pull off.
participants don't get searched coming in, and the simulation guns look so authentic, it's hard to tell them apart from the real thing.
Steve. - Duke, what do you got?
handgun, nine-millimeter.
my guys found it ditched in some scrub less than 50 yards from the murder scene.
pocket pistol. Ideal for concealed carry.
right. So one of Davis's coworkers could have snuck this on, killed him, then dumped the weapon before you guys arrived.
so much for team building.
I take it GSR testing is out.
I mean, all of these guys are gonna have gunpowder on them from the simulation weapons.
but only the murder weapon fired real bullets.
which is why we're testing for lead.
if it's present on one of these guys, they're our shooter.
guys, give me a second.
I shouldn't even be here.
this retreat is for executives only, and I'm just an assistant.
but Scott knew it was my dream to visit Hawaii, so he paid for me to come.
the flight, the hotel, all out of his own pocket.
Melinda, I have to ask you a question.
to the best of your knowledge, did any of Scott's associates have a, have a problem with him?
Scott Davis was the smartest person I've ever met in my life.
people can be intimidated by that, but everyone at work loved him.
okay. Give me a second, please?
sure. - Thanks.
the results came in.
none of these guys tested positive for lead trace.
so who fired the murder weapon?
okay, so the time codes are all synced up and all 11 action cameras are playing back in real time.
try not to shoot me in the back, dude! We're on the same team! Aw, crap.
uh, which way does this thing go in?
come on, man, it's not that hard.
wait a minute. Pause. Pause it.
Where's this guy's camera angle?
uh, doesn't look like we have it.
but all 11 camera feeds are up and running.
well, punch in on him.
well, that's why we don't have it. He's not wearing an action cam.
Yeah. Check out his mask.
it's a pretty different than the others.
okay, so we got 12 men on the field.
Yeah, 11 players, one killer.
we have road blocks set up, birds in the air.
no sign of our suspect so far.
it's been over an hour.
even in this terrain, he's long gone.
what about the murder weapon?
lab's processing it now. Looks like a dead end.
no prints, serial number's been filed off.
all right, thanks, Duke. - Thanks.
Hey, I showed around a photo of our shooter, but no one remembers seeing him during the training simulation.
turns out one of their colleagues was supposed to join them this morning.
never showed up. His name's Brent Mercer.
Yeah, I ran his credit card. He just booked a flight out of town.
leaves Honolulu in an hour.
an hour? Guys skips town that quickly after his colleague's murder, it's the guy I want to talk to.
I don't know who you people are, but you're damn sure gonna explain to me why you pulled me off my flight and strapped me to this chair.
I should be halfway to San Francisco by now.
if you're done, maybe we could focus on where you were this morning, specifically at 9: 27 a. m.
which is the exact time that your coworker Scott Davis was shot and killed.
what?
Scott's dead?
Wow. The award for best performance by a murder suspect goes to...
wait, wait, wait. You guys think I killed him?
that-that's insane.
well, it's not really insane.
you were conspicuously absent from the field trip this morning, and you still haven't told us where you were.
I was at the hotel.
I was sleeping in.
Oh, yeah?
can anyone corroborate that?
no.
all right, let's-let's recap.
you hated the victim, you have no alibi, and you tried to duck out of town just a little while after he was killed.
whoa, who said... who said I hated Scott?
you said you hated Scott quite articulately, actually.
Scott, it's Brent.
you know, I always knew you were an arrogant son of a bitch, but you proved yourself tonight, pal.
those guys can keep kissing your ass.
I'm done with you.
is that your voice?
is that your voice?
Yeah, it's my voice.
okay, so you leave this message on Scott's voice mail late last night.
then less than 12 hours later, he's dead.
it's not what it sounds like.
look, guys, a bunch of us, we went out for drinks last night.
and we ran into Scott, okay? I went over to him, and I said hi, and he completely blew me off.
I mean, this is coming from the kid who used to grab me my coffee when I started at Ardus, and now I have to report to him.
so forgive me, but when he treated me that way, it was humiliating.
all right, good.
the only thing missing was motive, and you've kindly provided that now.
guys, guys, I was drunk, I admit, and I was pissed.
it was wrong, but the minute I woke up this morning,
I regretted leaving that message, okay?
I did.
that's the whole reason I bailed on the outing.
I was embarrassed to face Scott.
that's the truth, but I didn't kill him.
chin?
the CEO of Ardus is a guy named Neil Redding.
he's the boss of both the victim and our suspect.
he also likes to wear very fancy suits.
I know that because I happen to be looking at him through the window of my office.
he's here?
Yeah, he just walked in, and he insisted on talking to you.
I was on my way to Beijing to lock up a contract when I got the call about Scott's death.
I redirect the flight, only to be told when I land that Brent Mercer's being held as a suspect.
so not only is one of my top-tier employees dead, but now another is under arrest.
I need somebody to tell me what the hell is going on.
okay, with all due respect, Mr. Redding, we're gonna ask the questions, all right?
of course.
okay, you are Brent Mercer's boss.
do you think he's capable of doing something like this?
this is a cutthroat business.
my people are very competitive with each other.
in Brent's case, Scott came in as an intern, and he absolutely lapped him, but I hired Brent.
I trained him myself.
if he's capable of killing Scott? No.
why do you say that?
Brent's a great employee, but what he doesn't have is the fire in his belly.
I'm no psychologist, but I can tell you that he doesn't have the balls to kill someone.
looked into Brent's airline ticket.
it was purchased online at 9: 45 this morning.
ip address traces back to the hotel's Wi-Fi.
okay, so unless somebody else used Brent's computer, that puts him at the hotel less than 20 minutes after the murder.
Yeah, which means that there's no way he could have been back across the island at the time of death.
okay, well, if this all checks out, we'll be releasing Brent shortly.
good,'cause my board is panicked enough as it is.
now I've got to get to an emergency meeting to assure them that these events won't take down this company.
wow, that's, uh...
I was gonna offer my condolences, but please.
I know this sounds cold, Detective.
Scott Davis was a personal friend of mine, but to those people, he was just an asset, and a valuable one at that.
your field assessment was correct.
C.O.D. was a nine-millimeter gunshot wound through the back of the head.
however, here's what's interesting.
routine tox screen revealed that the victim had detectable levels of Flutoprazepam in his blood.
sorry, fluto what now?
it's a hypnotic sedative used as a muscle relaxant for insomnia treatment.
it works by depressing the central nervous system. - Okay, wait.
what would Davis take a sedative before going on an intense tactical training exercise?
well, the real question is why would he take it at all.
according to his medical records, it wasn't prescribed to him, and recreational use seems highly unlikely as a dose that large would have just knocked him out.
can you tell how long it's been in his system?
based on the metabolites, it would appear that he ingested them roughly around 12 hours ago.
okay, I don't think our victim took a sedative willingly.
I think someone drugged him with it.
Hey, Steve, it's Kono.
okay, so Mercer puts Davis at the bar around the same time he was drugged, right?
right, maybe somebody dosed him at the bar, slipped something in his drink.
that's what I'm thinking; someone drugs this guy at night.
next day he gets shot in the head. I'm guessing these events are related.
all right. You know which bar we're going to?
la Mariana Tiki Bar, yeah.
I'll drive.
you don't say.
Hi. - Hey.
what the, uh, what the hell is this?
what, I can't surprise Steve at work?
no, you can do that. I'm talking about the, uh, the jersey.
Oh, oh, well, we moved around a lot when I was a kid, so you know, I never stayed in one place long enough to get tied to a team.
Oh, so you willingly root for the Dallas Cowboys, huh?
Yeah.
come on. Who doesn't like America's team?
I-I don't. - We don't.
and, uh, if I recall correctly, my Redskins humiliated your Cowboys the last time they played.
that's very cute.
you got a Cowboys fan dating a Redskins fan.
that's like the Capulets and the Montagues.
that's good.
I'm gonna give you an A plus for that literary reference.
Oh, you got that? Thanks. - Yeah.
but actually, um, I came here with a peace offering for Steve. See, the NFL hooked up my unit with some tickets for the game tomorrow.
so, you and I are going to the Pro Bowl.
what?
I'm already going with Danny.
you're...
we got 50 yard line seats.
best seats in the house.
we got them this morning. I'm sorry.
that's... that's cool. Okay.
um, you know what, my seats are-are pretty good.
so I'm sure I can find someone else to take it. It's good.
Yeah.
I'm gonna just let that awkward moment fade out a little bit.
we got a bar to go to.
for a case. We're going to a bar for a case. - It's a case. A bar case.
okay.
Hey, why don't we do some tailgating before the game together?
you and me? - Yeah, I would love that.
but I don't want to get in the way of your man date with Danny.
it's not a man date. - No.
anyway, Kamekona already invited himself, so it's fine; you're not getting in the way.
Mmm, that's a three-way bromance.
cute. It's very, very cute. I like it.
all right, don't quote me, but I think I like this place.
Yeah, my dad liked it here, too, a lot.
he was a regular.
ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the Kane of cool,
hawaii's very own Nicky "The Kid" Demarco.
the Kid? Doesn't look like a kid.
whatever you do, don't ask him about his name, don't answer any questions, let me do the talking, all right?
Hey. Little Stevie McGarrett, what's cooking?
what's cooking? You're cooking.
you sound great up there. - Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, Nicky, I want you to meet my partner.
this is Detective Danny Williams.
Hey, Danny, how are you? - Good, how are you?
you're not from around here, are you?
no, I'm from New Jersey.
new Jersey? - Yeah.
sit down, my boy. I got to talk to you.
sit down right here. New Jersey. - Okay.
I used to work with a singer from New Jersey way back in the day. - Oh, yeah?
a fella by the name of Francis Albert Sinatra.
you-you worked with Frank Sinatra. - Yeah.
you know he worked with Frank Sinatra?
I-I've heard this story once or twice.
Yeah, but-but he didn't.
july 18, 1965, Frank's playing the Arie Crown Theater in Chicago, and his opening act calls in sick.
I'm just a 17-year-old stagehand, but Frank turns to me and he says,"You're in, kid.
I opened the show, and I killed them, and I've been singing as "The Kid" ever since.
that's a great story.
Yeah.
so listen, Nicky, - uh, we actually, we need your help in a case. - Yeah, sure.
okay.
you see this guy drinking here last night? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
sure, yeah. He came in solo.
he sat at the bar, but he wasn't drinking alone for long.
Holly got to him.
who's Holly?
close the door.
blond bombs hell. She's got legs up to here.
you know, the word on the street is she's got a knack for separating rich guys from their hard-earned dough.
what do you mean, she's a hooker?
no. She's got an angle, but I don't know what the angle is.
okay, what about her last name?
you know her name, Nicky?
sorry, but maybe you should talk to Isaiah there.
him and Holly were pretty chummy.
who's Isaiah? Is he the bouncer? - That's right.
you know, she used to lay some pretty big tips on him, and I could never figure out why she was so generous.
well, maybe if she's running scams, tipping him, he's got something to do with it. He's in, you know?
where do you think you're going?
Frank taught me that.
I thought we were friends, Nicky.
actually, I never cared for you.
Oh, so you rat me out to the cops?
all I did was skim cash at the door.
Hey, the cover charge is for the talent.
that's me, you imbecile.
all right, let's settle down here.
why don't you tell us, Isaiah, about this con you've been running with Holly?
Wh... It's not like that.
okay, well, we're here; tell us what it's like.
look, I don't even know the girl's real name.
she's a grifter.
got a nice scam going ripping off rich businessmen.
all I do is tip her off when one of them's throwing cash around at the bar.
what she does to the poor saps after that is up to her.
okay, well, the last poor sap she ran a scam on ended up dead.
his name was Scott Davis. You know him?
wait, you talking about the dude she hit up last night?
because I had nothing to do with that.
Hey, you lie to my friends one more time, I'll knock your teeth out.
you understand me?
Nick, come on, take a seat.
honestly, this Davis guy was all plastic.
no cash.
I figured him for a lousy mark.
so you're telling us you did not sic Holly onto him?
no way.
I was shocked when she showed up out of the blue and locked onto that poor mope.
couple drinks later, he's wasted, and she's helping him out of the bar.
those umbrella drinks are pretty potent.
especially if you add a couple sedatives to them.
you let that broad drug our customers?
what, are you nuts?
I've never known Holly to drug anybody.
girl that fine?
she's got no problems getting dudes to leave with her willingly.
but she was clearly working off a different script last night.
all right, you might not know her name, but you must have a way of getting in contact with her.
text message.
her number's programmed into my phone.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
all right.
surprise, surprise.
Holly's been using a prepaid cell.
chin and Kono are running a trace now.
all right. So what do we think?
it seems pretty obvious to me Holly's after one thing, right?
it's the cash.
now, all of a sudden, she switches up her MO, and goes after Scott Davis.
it doesn't make sense. I think somebody used her to get close to him.
okay, I'm thinking that same someone is behind Davis's murder.
so if we find Holly, we find our killer.
okay. I'm here.
looks like a lot of people are checking in for the game tomorrow.
so where am I going?
head toward the front desk.
there should be a corridor to the right.
okay.
I'm heading for it now.
GPS on Holly's phone puts her up ahead on the left.
there's no Holly, but there's a door marked "security.
maybe she got pinched pulling one of her scams.
okay, let me call you back.
took you long enough to get here.
HPD told me they were sending a unit an hour ago.
look, that's not me.
I'm with Five-O.
nice.
I'm running down a suspect.
looks like you have her phone.
let me guess...
tall, blond, a looker?
Yeah, that's her. - Yeah.
girl forgot her phone by the pool.
she was in a real hurry to get out of here after the incident.
what incident?
Yeah, that's Holly.
who's the guy she's with?
you mean the unsub?
I wasn't able to ID him.
watched a few cop shows, have you?
actually, I put an application into HPD.
we might get a chance to work together soon.
look forward to it.
it's getting pretty heated.
looks like she wants to get out of there.
wait, it gets better.
recognize the good Samaritan?
that's Arian Foster.
what, the running back for the Texans?
Yeah.
he's even hotter without the pads and the helmet.
you see Peyton?
okay. We're supposed to be working.
would you stop stalking Peyton Manning?
just if you see him, let me know, please.
please?
there's Arian Foster.
I said I'm...
not really comfortable with that, man.
but we all want to see you do it.
Namaste.
Thanks!
I really appreciate the love, man, but a touchdown ritual, and what I do in the end zone is kind of, like, sacred.
so I like to keep it on the field, you understand?
arian - You're welcome.
steve McGarrett, Five-O. We'd like you to answer some questions.
all right.
originally, I was just trying to help the girl out.
but... he took a swing at me, so, you know, I had to defend myself.
but, you know, after that, they both left. - Okay.
um, by any chance did you catch either of their names?
or maybe hear what they were arguing about?
no, not really. The guy was kind of trying to avoid a scene.
and, um, she was pretty hot about something.
but I do remember her saying something, like, along the lines of, "What are you trying to get me caught up in?"Or, you know, something like that.
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't be any more of...
no, no, no. It's cool, man. Y-You've been very helpful.- Appreciate it.
actually, um, I-I have one question, if that's okay.
Yeah, man.
okay, uh, week 11, you guys are playing the Jaguars, you took a handoff and ran out the outside about three yards, three, four yards, and then...
you kind of got hit but you kind of didn't get hit and y-you let the ball go. You fumbled the ball.
and I was just curious if you remember how that happened or why that happened or...
you serious?
are you serious?
I... Oh, I... I'm serious, yeah.
well, officer, um,
I carried the ball over 350 times this year, um...
and you're asking me about one of the two fumbles I lost all year?
no. I-It's just that that, um... that possession, it really burned in my memory, you see, because I had you in my fantasy football league, and if y-you didn't drop that ball,
I would've won the championship, so it was very...
with all due respect, officer, you should let that one go.
he should. - You're probably right.
thank you again, man. - Appreciate it.
that's-that's a nice ring. Tell me about that. - Thanks, man.
not a Super Bowl ring, right? - Okay.
it's all day. - I'm sorry.
uh, well, officer, this is a class ring. I got it when I was, um...
when I was playing college.
by any chance, were you wearing that when you got into it with these suspects?
Yeah, why?
Hey, Charlie, McGarrett.
listen, we got a piece of evidence we need you to run for DNA.
we're bringing it down now.
you know, I can't believe you embarrassed yourself like that back there.
uh, Foster's the one who should be embarrassed, okay?
I'm not the one who fumbled that ball.
he holds onto that ball, and I am a fantasy champion.
instead you're a real-life imbecile.
are you kidding me?
okay, it's easy to criticize these guys from the comfort of your couch.
it's a little harder when you're on the field and there's a linebacker coming at you like a freight train.
okay, you don't understand. You don't play fantasy football.
no, you're right. I was too busy playing real football.
okay, what I do takes skill.
okay? You got to know who to draft, you got to know who to trade, you got to work the waiver wire.
there's a lot of things that go into it, see.
okay, Does it involve throwing, catching or making a tackle?
no. - Well, that's because it's Dungeons & Dragons for sports geeks, okay? So, in the words of Arian Foster, you need to let this go.
our friend Holly, she's been pretty active lately.
her picture turned up in a bunch of open HPD investigations.
okay.
we get a name? - Yeah.
ten of 'em.
all aliases.
but the good news is we got an I. D.on the guy she was meeting with this morning.
the DNA from the ring came back to a Timothy Cross.
he's in the system for B and E and extortion.
back in '08, Cross got popped trying to blackmail a federal judge in California, and, uh, he was released from San Quentin six months ago.
that makes sense. A guy with a background like this shows up in Hawaii, hooks up with a local grifter-type chick.
Yeah, and speaking of Cross' background, uh, before he turned to a life of crime, he was an officer in the Army.
he had quite a career before he was dishonorably discharged.
10th Special Forces Group.
okay, well, this guy's definitely got the skill set to pull off the shooting.
and that's not all.
according to Cross' file, he's six feet, 185 pounds.
that's the same height and build as our shooter.
all right, so Cross goes after Holly to run this con on Davis.
obviously she doesn't know that it's gonna end up in a murder beef.
makes sense why she flipped out on him by the pool today.
looks like Cross just graduated from extortion to murder.
why would I want to run around playing soldier with a bunch of wannabe action heroes?
cause it was a perfect opportunity to take out the target.
Yeah, you just walk right up to him with a mask on, shoot him point-blank in the head.
by the time anybody realizes he's dead, you're long gone.
so you're saying that's me?
cause all I see is a grainy picture of someone in a mask.
nice try. - No, really.
I didn't kill anybody.
I don't even know who this Davis guy is.
who said his name was Davis?
let me guess.
you're gonna say that's not you either.
listen, we know you were running a con on Scott Davis, okay?
and that you used Holly to drug him.
given your history, I'm thinking it was a blackmail attempt.
is that right? - So what happened?
Davis threatened to go to the cops and you had to kill him?
it's not like that. - Well, why don't you tell us what it's like.
look, I'll admit to targeting the guy, but it wasn't over blackmail.
I've been out of that game for years. - So what's your game now?
intelligence gathering.
I got a knack for obtaining information that isn't available through legal means.
in this case, a client hired me to steal Ardus's intellectual property.
all right, so you figured Scott Davis was the guy to go to for that, and you used Holly to get close to him.
girl's got a nice scam going
getting guys back to their rooms so she can rob them.
all she had to do this time was copy the data from Davis's laptop onto a flash drive.
I gave her a sedative to slip him at the bar and 20 grand for her trouble.
so that's why you were meeting yesterday
she was supposed to hand you over the flash drive.
but...
we all know how that went, huh?
Holly had seen on TV that Davis was dead.
she got spooked, thought I was involved.
and before I could talk her down and get the drive from her, some hero stepped in and clocked me.
now I'm out $20K, I have no flash drive.
my clients aren't gonna be too happy about that.
why don't you give us their names? We'll call and apologize for you.
I wish I could. But I don't even know who they are.
it's all arranged through double-blind contacts.
these Wall Street-types, they're good at avoiding jail time.
they might be.
you're not.
Yeah.
look, I've, uh...
I suppose I have violated one or two conditions of my parole, but there is no way I'm eating a murder charge.
Koali Day Spa.
that's where I was yesterday morning when Davis was shot.
the masseuse mostly focused on my glutes, but I'm guessing she'll remember my face.
okay, so, Cross' alibi checks out
spa confirmed he was there yesterday from 8: 00 to 10: 00.
Yeah, I was listening in on the interrogation.
so, Cross hired Holly to get the data off of Davis's computer.
but when HPD searched the hotel room, there was no laptop in there.
wait a minute.
we know that Holly dumped the data onto a flash drive.
the only reason she would do that is if she was leaving the laptop behind.
right. - Which means someone else must've stolen it from Davis's room after the murder.
I think I might know what they were looking for.
I dug into Ardus's financials.
turns out they were heavily invested in a next-gen mobile chipset that was developed by Davis.
rumor is this could be a billion-dollar product.
well, that would explain why Cross' client was willing to engage in corporate espionage to get the data off Scott Davis's computer.
and why someone else might be willing to kill for it.
Hey. All right, so I just got off the phone with the clerk's office.
one of Holly's aliases traces back to an address on Waipahu.
deed goes back seven years, well before her grifting days.
check this out. Check this out.
check this out. Make it happen, please.
thank you.
that's her.
Holly's real name is Lana Sullivan.
Cath, what's up?
Hey, you tell me.
Kickoff's in an hour. You gonna make it?
Yes, we are going to make it.
we're... Listen, I know I said we were gonna hang out, but we're kinda tied up with this case.
well, you're missing quite a scene.
for the record, I can eat grilled Spam any day of the week here, okay?
I am not missing my opportunity to meet a living legend, okay?
all right. Well, if you guys make it here, I'll try to find you during halftime, okay?
sounds good. See you soon.
all right, we found Holly.
whatever.
Hey! Hey, Five-O.
Hey, hey, don't move! Hey!
Hey. Back up.
who the hell are you?
you look a lot like your sister Lana.
I presume that's how you're related?
okay, where's Lana?
what are you looking at?
she seems a lot more interested in something on this desk than talking to us.
please, I'm just trying to protect my sister.
protect your sister from what?
Hey. This is a copy of Scott Davis's hard drive.
why were you about to send this to the Honolulu Times?
I told her not to do it, that it was dangerous, but...
do what? What was she gonna do?
she said she found a buyer, somebody willing to pay for what was on that guy's hard drive.
she's on her way to meet him now.
okay, so this e-mail is her insurance policy.
if I don't hear from her by 2: 00,
I'm supposed to send the file to the press.
okay, where's the meeting supposed to be?
you'll just arrest her.
that's better than what the buyer might do to her. Okay, somebody's already been killed over the data on that computer.
you want to put your sister in that kind of danger?
so tell us, where is she?
so, I dug through the copy of Davis's hard drive you sent over, and found an e-mail thread between him and his boss, Neil Redding.
turns out that for months he has been warning Redding that the chipset that Ardus was developing wasn't viable.
wait a minute, this guy stakes his entire company on this new technology, millions of dollars in R&D and the thing doesn't even work?
exactly. And when Wall Street gets wind of this, that'll be the end of Ardus.
okay, but there's nothing Redding can do to stop that.
I mean, even if he silences Davis, he's only gonna buy some time, right? So why kill him?
here's why. I finally heard back from Ardus's insurance carrier.
they held a $30 million "Key Person" life policy on Davis.
these policies cover high-level employees who are considered essential to a company's success.
okay, so Davis is worth more to Redding dead than alive.
right.
Hey, guys.
okay, so, Redding's office said that he was en route to California, so I dispatched SFPD to pick him up at the airport, but when his plane arrived, he wasn't on it.
that's great. So where the hell is he?
here, the pilot copped to forging the flight manifest to and from Honolulu.
Redding's actually been on the island for the past 48 hours.
that means he was here when Davis was killed. - Yeah.
okay, so Redding kills Davis, for the insurance payout, and uses the forged flight manifest as his alibi.
Yeah, but there's no way he could've predicted that one of Ardus's rivals would hire Cross to clone Davis's laptop.
okay, and now with these incriminating e-mails out there in the world,
Redding has one last loose end to tie up.
I believe you have something for me.
I do if you brought the cash.
it's close by, but I want to see what I'm buying first.
a little advice: next time you steal something, don't try selling it back to the people you took it from.
not that there's gonna be a next time.
start walking.
you think I'm stupid, don't you?
the thought crossed my mind.
I took a look at what was on that drive
I know what you're trying to hide.
Yeah, I figured as much, and that's why you'll be going off the pier, too.
well, here's what you don't know.
if I don't make a call in the next 15 minutes, everything that's on that flash drive goes public.
front page news by morning.
who's stupid now?
Five-O! Hey.
you all right?
buddy, I,uh...
I don't think your shoulder's supposed to look like that.
these guys have got to take me to King's to set my arm.
just go already. You're gonna miss the kickoff.
what are you doing? - What I'm doing, I'm...
making sure these prime, once-in-a-lifetime seats don't go to waste.
Hey, it's a good thing your friends couldn't make it, huh?
Mm. You realize this is not that kind of football, right?
I'm being ironic.
ironic.
glad you could make it, Chin.
I thought Kono was gonna join us.
she was.
but she got a better offer.
Oh! Go!
go! Go! Go! Go!
okay.
on three, right? - That's right.
one, two, three.
I got it, I got it, I got it, ai!
fourth and goal. There's the snap.
manning drops back in the pocket.
throws over the middle-- and it's caught by A. J. Green for a touchdown!
yay, a touchdown. That's so great.
so great to be there. It would've been fun.
you got to be kidding me.
you got to... you got to be kidding me.
I know those two girls.
I-I could have been...
you believe where we are, Danny?
pretty incredible, right?
huh? What do you think?
it's-it's amazing.
it's amazing, right? I mean, I think it'd be a little more impressive, uh, with 50, 000 people in the stands, the greatest athletes of all time on the field, but it's...
it's nice like this, I like this.
this is... this is nice.
I'm sorry that you had to miss the game because of me, I am.
okay? - Okay.
but look at it this way-- next year Peyton Manning's, like, he's virtually a lock for the Pro Bowl team again, right?
all right, we've got the field for ten minutes, and then they got to cover it up.
okay, thanks for making it happen.
no problem.
uh, listen, Peyton said he was sorry.
he really wanted to meet you, but he had a plane to catch.
you guys are on a first-name basis now?
kind of.
Uh-huh. Uh, we had a talk after the game, and I told him that you were a huge fan and that you had to miss the game because of a case, and, uh, he wanted me to give you this.
okay, that's awesome.
that's awesome.
that's really great. Thank you.
welcome.
um, what's he like?
Oh, okay, he's so nice.
and really tall.
like... tall.
well, he's got to get over the line. - Should I be jealous?
should you be jealous?
he's a, um, four-time MVP, Super Bowl champion, future Hall-of-Famer.
should you be jealous?
okay, besides that, what's he done?
what's he done? - Yeah, what's he done?
he hosted Saturday Night Live, does a lot of charity work, works with kids.
he, uh, gave me this football.
we should throw that. Let's throw the ball.
that-that right there is an autographed ball.
when's he gonna get a chance to catch a pass on an actual NFL field? Look at this.
let's go.
it's my ball. - Okay.
so I make the decision, right? All right.
okay, okay. All right, you want me to run a post?
easy out. I can run a fly. Square in, square out.
why don't you run, I'll throw you the ball.
you like the "go route," then. Okay.
that's awesome.
all right, you ready? - You're gonna do it, do it right.
call it out and do the whole thing.
I'll call it out.
all right.
all right. - All right.
blue 22, hut, hut, hut!
Danny's actually got pretty good hands.
Five-O! - Coming up next on The Savannah Walker Show:
Savannah takes a thrilling ride-along with Hawaii's elite crime-fighting task force, Five-O.
wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?
this is as far as you go, okay?
zoom in there. I want to see what they're looking at.
Oh, my God.
live from Hilton Hawaiian Village in beautiful Waikiki, it's The Savannah Walker Show!
starring your host, Savannah Walker!
and here she is, the queen of talk, Savannah!
give it up for my boys.
everyone!
welcome to the show!
now, as you know, we have got it going on from Hawaii all week long.
it has been incredible.
we've been shooting everywhere in our country's 50th state, and it has been fantastic.
from the beaches of the North Shore to the skyscrapers of Waikiki, we have done it all, and it has been amazing. Am I right?
Yes.
but we have saved the very best for last.
my producers thought it would be exciting to do something different, something truly out of the box.
and so they arranged for me to hang out with Five-O,
hawaii's elite crime-fighting task force.
Yes.
and with the governor's blessing,
I was able to take my camera crew behind the scenes for the ultimate ride-along.
now, I want to warn you, this is not gonna be one of our typical Savannah shows.
it is going to be scary, it's going to be graphic, and it might be a good idea to put those little ones down for an early nap.
because I am talking unscripted, unedited and unbelievable.
are you ready?
all right! This is gonna be off the hook!
Tommy, roll the tape.
welcome to the home of Five-O.
this beautiful building opened in 1871, designed by Australian Thomas Rowe in an Italian Renaissance revival.
it doesn't look like your average police station, does it?
that's because Five-O aren't your typical cops.
they're a task force that handles high-priority cases.
cases that often put them in life and death situations.
in this show, we're gonna get to know Five-O's key personnel.
to start, let's meet the big, Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett, the boss man and Honolulu native.
born and raised on the island of Oahu,
steve was a celebrated quarterback for the Fightin' Nuts of Kukui High, a standout at the Naval Academy and a highly decorated Navy SEAL who saw action around the globe.
Hi, Commander McGarrett. - Hi.
Hi. I understand you were handpicked by the late Governor Jameson, uh, to lead Five-O, and tasked with cleaning up crime on the islands.
that's, um, a pretty awesome task.
uh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to say something back to you?
well, that's how an on-camera interview works.
I, um, ask the questions, and then you answer.
okay, um, I'm not really comfortable with that, and, uh, I don't...
I thought you guys were just gonna follow us around.
you know?
okay, this is gonna be a little tougher than I thought.
um, well, okay. Working alongside Steve McGarrett is Detective Danny Williams, a New Jersey transplant who seems to have brought his feisty Jersey attitude with him.
um, Detective Williams, can I...
please, okay? I know the governor thinks that this is good PR, but I disagree strongly, so please keep the camera out of my face and we'll be fine.
please? I said please. Thank you.
peace.
Oh, Lieutenant Kelly.
can I ask you a few questions?
I'm a little bit busy right now.
well, I understand that Commander McGarrett's father trained you.
what drew you to a life in law enforcement?
uh, family.
I come from a long line of cops. I guess it's in my DNA.
well, if you weren't a cop, what would you be?
jazz trumpet.
Really? Like Miles Davis?
well, there's only one Miles Davis, but...
maybe that's why I became a cop.
now, if you'll excuse me.
no, it's good, we're on the way. Hey, Chin, let's go.
yo, let's go! Oh, oh.
this is it, we caught a case. Come on, let's go.
uh, Commander McGarrett, uh, can you tell us where we're going?
did you sign the personal safety waiver?
you guys all need to do that, all right, before you come.
make sure they get one. - A safety waiver? Why?
wait. Wait, what's so funny?
better call your insurance agent from the car.
tell him you want full coverage.
wait, you guys... you're kidding, right?
they're kidding, right?
come on, come on! We got to keep up.
I'm trying. - Try harder; we're losing them!
you want me to run all the red lights? Fine. But you're paying the tickets.
it's a deal. Just don't lose them.
don't tell anyone.
okay, we're at the crime scene with Five-O.
let's take a look.
Duke, what do you got?
it's a real mess down there.
let's increase the radius to include this rooftop here.
it's got a clear line of sight.
there might be a surveillance camera that picked something up.
wait, wait, wait, what are you doing?
this is as far as you go, okay?
we won't get in the way.
I'm sorry, it's my crime scene, my rules.
okay? - Okay.
zoom in there. I want to see what they're looking at.
Oh, my God.
is all of that blood?
Billy, boost the levels up. I want to hear what they're saying.
that's some serious mutilation.
killer must have used an axe or a cleaver.
did he say "mutilated"?
let's get Max over here right away.
okay, come on, come on, come on.
officer Kalakaua, can you tell us who the victim is?
can you at least tell us if it was a man or a woman? - We don't know.
you won't say 'cause it'll compromise the case?
no. I'm telling you, we don't know.
central to M. E. Two.
Five-O is at your crime scene, requesting you expedite due to special circumstances.
Steve, you ever seen anything like this?
never.
welcome back.
now, when my producers suggested I conduct a ride-along with Hawaii's elite task force, Five-O,
I thought we'd be breaking up bar fights or maybe busting shoplifters.
I had no idea we'd be standing over a dead body in an alley.
and to top it all off, they can't tell if the victim is a man or a woman.
I have to tell you, if this is a typical day at the office for these guys,
I am so glad I'm not a cop.
let's take a look.
no blood trail indicates this was most likely a body dump.
Savannah, M.E.'s office.
okay, let's go.
that is Dr. Max Bergman.
he's a medical examiner with the City of Honolulu.
his job is to examine the body for cause of death and search for physical clues left behind by the killer. Let's talk to him.
Dr. Bergman. I'm...
Oh, Savannah Walker!
I know who you are. - You do?
I find your show to be quite inspiring. - Really?
Yes, I mean, your compelling interviews, your self-improvement segments, your unusual foray into pop culture.
it's quite inspirational.
wow, you really are a fan.
Yes, I mean, I wake up at 5: 00 a. m. each morning so I can catch the live feed from the mainland.
I got hooked on to your show during my undergrad years at Arizona State.
uh, uh, and the Christmas segment where you did the reenactment of, uh, the birth of Jesusand the camel kept on licking the baby... oh, my God.
it had me in stitches!
not literally, but metaphorically.
well, uh, A.S. U.I understand, has an incredible life sciences program.
Oh, it's exceptional.
but, uh, it's the party scene that's the reason why I went there.
it's off the hook.
not many people know this, but, uh, in my frat house,
I was referred to as "Beerman" instead of Bergman.
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm talking to you right now!
I'm thrilled to meet you, too.
um, listen, Dr. Bergman, I'm wondering, you know, since you're such a... a faithful viewer, if I might not ask you for a little favor.
of course.
on close examination, victim is male, Caucasian.
face desecrated beyond recognition.
lower arms exhibit significant trauma, with both hands appearing to be severed above the wrist.
liver temp indicates our victim was murdered eight to ten hours ago.
killer must have hacked up the body to prevent I. D.
it's a pro move.
Max, what is that?
what?
there's a camera on your shirt, Max.
Oh, this camera.
nice try.
is this yours?
Yeah.
sorry. - This was not part of the agreement.
well, it's called "investigative reporting," Commander.
Oh, that's what it's called when you interview chefs and celebrities, huh?
this is not 60 Minutes. - Hold on.
for your information, I have a degree in journalism from Northwestern.
your professors must be very proud.
let's erase that.
Savannah, behind you.
officer, can I ask you a few questions, please?
the victim has yet to be identified.
do you have any suspects?
not at this time.
now, if you'll excuse me...
wait, if I could just get a name.
Hey, guys! It's Wo Fat!
did you get that?
please tell me you got that. - Duke, call it in. Get a bird in the air now.
wo Fat is not leaving this island.
who is Wo Fat?
wo Fat is a ruthless son of a bitch.
wait, can I say that on TV?
you already did.
wo Fat is a global terrorist.
he tortured and murdered innocent people.
he supplies arms to our country's enemies.
he's a true sociopath.
he's devoid of any morals or scruples.
seems like there's... more to this guy.
what aren't you telling us?
wo Fat was the man behind the murder of John McGarrett.
Steve's father.
he would've killed Steve's mother, too, if given the opportunity.
so what you're saying is that capturing Wo Fat is personal for Steve?
that's the way this job is.
sometimes it crosses over into the personal.
has it ever gotten personal for you?
Yes.
sadly, after this interview, I learned that Lieutenant Kelly lost someone very dear to him, his wife, Malia, as a direct result of a Five-O investigation.
now, out of respect, I won't go into further detail, but what I will tell you is that despite their personal losses,
Five-O has forged an incredible bond, one akin to family, or what the locals refer to as "ohana."
now, what if I was to tell you that we...and by "we" I mean this show...
had a direct hand in helping this investigation?
to explain how, let's meet Officer Kono Kalakaua.
Kono grew up on the North Shore of O'ahu and spent the early part of her life as a professional surfer.
now, when a knee injury sidelined her career, she followed in the footsteps of her cousin, Chin Ho Kelly, and joined the ranks of law enforcement.
a skilled sniper and martial artist,
Kono explains here how Five-O uses technology to help solve crimes.
in a lot of cases, we use public surveillance cameras because they allow us to capture evidence of criminal activity.
however, this case was a little different because we had your crew tagging along with us the whole time, so what we did was we took the video you shot and enhanced it in order to get a better look at our suspect, Wo Fat.
when you say "enhanced," what do you mean exactly?
uh, well, Five-O is, um, equipped with the latest in digital forensic hardware, which allows us to improve image quality by manipulating zoom, frame rate, um, angle, uh, at the same time increasing resolution.
Wow. Who on the Five-O team is well-versed in all this high-tech wizardry?
uh, that would be me.
how on earth did you get so tech-savvy?
Xbox.
here he is over the body when we arrived on-scene.
what is Wo Fat looking for?
and why show up posing as a cop?
my guess is he heard about the murder after the fact;
shows up wearing the uniform so he can get access to the crime scene.
which would mean that Wo Fat's not the killer.
okay, fine. Why's he so interested in our John Doe?
Oh, welcome. Please, come in, come in.
ms. Walker, so good to see you again.
Billy, Todd, always a pleasure.
where are your glasses, Max?
Oh, I'm wearing contacts.
uh, they don't respond to indoor precipitation like my spectacles do.
Uh-huh. Is that gel in your hair?
thank you for noticing, Detective.
lost him to Hollywood.
at your service.
okay. Were you any closer on an I. D. for the victim?
not yet.
AFIS was out of the question because the victim's hands were removed.
I did submit a DNA sample to CODIS, but the results came back negative.
there were no matches in the missing persons database.
however, I was able to confirm that the C. O.D...
that's cause of death... was indeed a shotgun wound.
and upon closer examination, I noticed that the victim's skin was removed from the upper right arm in near-surgical precision.
you mind stepping to your right a little bit?
Yes, I mind. Beat it. Go away.
What'd I tell you? Keep that camera out of my face.
get the hell out of here.
in here.
I told the investigators that the mutilation of the body was caused by a high-energy and blunt force trauma with an implement like a hammer.
but also a portion of the skin was excised on the right upper limb between the elbow joint and the shoulder.
what do you mean by "excised"?
well, the killer cut the skin off with a razor or a scalpel.
most likely, the missing part had an identifying mark, like a tattoo or a scar.
so now what? How do you identify the victim?
well, shotgun pellets recovered from the victim may help.
I sent them over to Fong.
Fong? What's a Fong?
I'm here with Charlie Fong, criminalist for the Honolulu Police Department.
now, Charlie, tell me, what does a criminalist do?
well, that can vary a lot from day to day.
one day, I might get called to court, the next day, I could be running QC samples all day.
then there are other days when I'm...
if you could sum it up in one sentence, what would it be?
I analyze evidence to solve crimes.
one sentence exactly; that was impressive.
precision. That's what my job is all about.
kind of like a quarterback throwing a perfect, chest-high spiral.
if you're off even a little, well, it could cost you the ball game.
now, do you ever get out in the field?
on occasion.
but solving crimes isn't all about getting shot at.
actually, most of the heavy lifting is done here behind a microscope.
this is where the real action is.
wow, so you're like the brains behind Five-O.
well... there's no "I" in team, but someone has to show them the way.
well, I understand that Dr. Max Bergman sent over some shotgun pellets to analyze.
what have you come up with?
nothing yet.
Hey, guys.
so, Danny was right about our M. O.
this was the work of a pro.
it's a Russian mob out of Kansas City.
so I contacted the KCPD Organized Crime Bureau, and apparently hacking up enemies is a local specialty.
all right, look, we need to get a list of possible associates, - uh, anybody traveling from over there with an alias. - Right.
it's already done. Dimitri Markov.
flew in two days ago.
checked into the Grand Kuali'i in Waikiki.
come on. Let's check it out.
ladies and gentlemen, lunch is served.
uh, looks amazing, but listen, big guy.
we got to rain-check this, all right?
don't worry. Flippa can doggy-bag that for you.
all of Kamekona shrimp truck meals travel exceptionally well, and at only $9. 99 per plate, easy on the wallet, too.
super tasty grinz anyone?
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
product placement, brah.
and for today only, anyone mentioning The Savannah Walker Show gets 50% off.
that's half price. - You know, this doesn't actually go on the TV today.
it airs another day. You gonna honor this thing, you know, on that day as well?
looks like a yes.
thank you.
whatever our vic was involved in, it was important enough to get the attention of a couple of heavyweights like the Russian mob and Wo Fat, all right?
if the KC mob sent Markov down here to whack our guy, he would've left, he wouldn't have stuck around.
I agree, but the motel says he hasn't checked out yet.
doesn't make sense. Guy comes down here, kills somebody and sticks around for a tan? No sense.
doesn't sound very "pro" to me.
okay, let me get this straight... this is Detective Williams' car, but Commander McGarrett does all the driving?
it's 'cause I'm the better driver.
he's a control freak. - That's why he drives.
and he's got issues with, uh, the truth.
okay. Why don't you tell her about the remote control thing you got?
what remote control thing?
the thing where you come to my house and you grab the clicker and you got to be in charge and you got to pick which TV station we watch.
okay, the way I was brought up...
it's polite to let the guest choose what you're gonna watch on TV, all right?
okay. Fair enough. What about having to be first through every single door?
or having the last word every conversation?
or picking where I eat lunch every single day? You. Why?
what does Emily Post have to say about that?
I'm not gonna... I mean, you're indecisive.
I can't help it if you're indecisive. - I'm not indecisive. You're a control freak.
these two fight, but really... they love each other.
where do you want to go for lunch today?
I'll go wherever you want to go.
Oh, my God. See?
we're here at the Grand Kuali'i, where we believe our suspect, the Russian mobster Dimitri Markov, is staying.
you stay here, you understand?
you don't go any further than this.
Five-O!
go, go, go.
clear left.
clear here.
those look like surveillance photos.
Hey! what'd I just tell you?
I told you to wait back there, didn't I?
over there. He's the one they're looking for.
commander, he's over here. - What?
the suspect. That's the suspect. - What?
Hey, Dimitri Markov, let me see your hands. Now!
Hey! Freeze!
I said hold it right there!
did he really just do that?
welcome to my world.
what's he saying?
not much. He's, uh...
he's claiming he's never heard of Wo Fat.
he did admit to stalking the victim, but he won't I. D. him, and he certainly won't cop to the murder.
that doesn't surprise me,'cause he's not our guy.
now, you guys know what an alibi is, right?
I know you know.
it's when you tell your wife you've been working all weekend, but you're really out playing golf with your boys.
right? We've all done it.
but in this case, the Russian hit man had a great alibi, because two security cameras put him all the way on the North Shore at the time the murder took place.
but Five-O still thought he was a piece of the puzzle because of these. You remember these?
the photos they found at Markov's motel room?
well, it turns out that these photos were of the victim.
so, I ran facial recognition on those surveillance photos and got a hit to a Roger Carson.
there's not a lot on him in the system, but he rents an apartment here, so I sent a unit by.
they said they saw signs of forced entry, so they sat on the place until we got here.
Five-O!
clear!
clear!
it's an Easter egg hunt.
well, somebody was looking for something.
could have been Markov before we grabbed him.
could have been Wo Fat.
or our butcher.
Kono, what do you got?
ran our vic's credit cards.
Roger Carson checked into the Waikiki Sun Motel by the airport 36 hours ago.
that's only a couple miles from here.
why would he need a second place so close to home?
manager said he checked in with a woman.
Roger? Is that you?
ma'am, it's Five-O.
ma'am, if you'd open the door, please.
how you doing? I'm, uh, Commander Steve McGarrett.
this is Detective Danny Williams.
what's your name?
miss Leeds, how do you know Roger Carson?
he's my boyfriend.
Oh, my God, something bad's happened, hasn't it?
may we come in, please?
you guys stay here.
miss Leeds...
okay, get out of here. I mean it, get out of here.
Hey! Hey!
commander, can you share with us what the victim's girlfriend had to say?
couple days ago, they came home, and they found their apartment tossed.
Carson said it was a robbery.
he moved her in here, and then he disappeared.
does it get to you?
excuse me?
having to inform a loved one about a death.
it's difficult.
you're delivering the worst information anybody's ever gonna tell them, and you're about to change their life forever with that information.
how do you cope with that?
you don't cope with it.
you use it to keep going.
I wasn't comfortable pressing Commander McGarrett for more information at such a clearly sensitive time.
but later, I was told that the victim's girlfriend, when shown an autopsy photo, pointed out that the skin removed from Roger's arm was right where he had a tattoo.
for some reason, the killer wanted it.
Yeah, I remember that guy.
came in for a custom job.
what kind of custom job?
some sort of mythical thing.
like a goddess.
look at all these photos on the wall. You take a picture of the goddess?
Yeah, I wanted to; piece came out real tight.
but dude was all cagey about it. Wouldn't let me.
what about the stencil paper you use as a template in the beginning?
you, uh... you got that?
no, I already gave that to the other cop.
wait. What other cop?
he came in this morning asking about the same customer.
is this the cop?
Yeah, that's him.
all right, you got cameras in here, or what?
Yeah, right there.
does it work? - Yeah.
how far back's it go?
uh, we clear the disks every week.
want to take a look? - Yeah, we do.
there. That's the artwork for the tattoo.
Kono, uh, can you isolate that image?
uh, Chin, what do you think?
well, the way she's emerging from the stream almost like she's made of water...
makes me think of Kalawahine.
Ka... That's crazy. I was gonna say the same exact thing.
Yeah, she's an ancient goddess.
protector of all the water sources in the Ko'olau Valley, formed by a mountain range on the leeward coast.
hold on. Steve, look at this.
looks like there's a pattern or something in the bottom of the skirt. You see that?
and it looks the same as one of these trails.
he's right. Check it out.
Kono, can you, uh...
can you overlay this trail pattern, uh, and the image of the tattoo?
well, that is not just a tattoo.
then what is it?
it's a map.
now, most guys get a tattoo of a dragon or barbed wire or their girlfriend's name.
but not Roger Carson.
his tattoo was of a very specific area of O'ahu called the Ko'olau Valley.
and the question Five-O was asking: what did it mean?
the only reason I can think of why anybody would tattoo a map onto their body is to hide something valuable and not forget where it is, right?
well, whatever our vic stashed, it was valuable enough for a Russian mobster and Wo Fat to come out of the woodwork looking for it.
and don't forget about our killer.
he was the first one to get to Carson.
he knew about the map, he hacked up our vic, then cut the tattoo off his arm.
well, if our killer has the map, then maybe this is where he's headed next.
okay, there's only one problem, 'cause there's 45 trails stretched out over 50 miles of terrain.
so where do we start?
to help Five-O figure it out, they enlisted the help of Lieutenant Catherine Rollins of Naval Intelligence.
um, uh, sometimes...
well, actually, make that a lot of the times,
commander McGarrett will ask for my help.
and he usually repays me in breakfast or dinner.
it's kind of like a little game that we play.
using military resources to help a friend...
uh, isn't that risky?
uh, well, Steve and my C. O. go way back, so he cuts him some slack.
what about you and Steve?
tell us about your history.
uh, we served in the military together.
you're also his girlfriend, right?
uh, how is that relevant?
just, America wants to know.
well, that's none of America's business, so...
okay, um, well, what about this case?
how did you help Steve?
well, he had asked me for some advanced satellite imagery of the Ko'olau Valley's trail system to help determine where his victim, Roger Carson, uh, might have hidden something.
should I take this off now?
no? Sorry. Okay.
Hey, Steve? - Yeah.
there's a Secret Service agent on the phone.
he says he needs to talk to you right now.
commander McGarrett?
Yes.
I'm Special Agent Kershaw. We need to talk.
okay, well, Agent Kershaw, I'm in the middle of an active murder investigation.
your homicide is why I'm calling.
this is a matter of national security, Commander.
can I be assured of the confidentiality of this conversation?
agent Kershaw, hold that thought for a second.
I need you guys to shut this down right now, okay, and wait in my office. Right now, let's go.
later, Commander McGarrett was able to share with me what that call was about.
it turns out, our victim's name wasn't Roger Carson, but Gary Ray Percy.
and before Hawaii, he resided in Washington D. C. where he worked at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
that's right, where money is printed.
and he was a well-trusted employee right up until he started taking his work home with him.
who's ever seen one of these?
couple of people?
it's called a 3-D printer.
now, who's got a phone I can borrow?
you guys are very generous.
thank you.
I promise to return it.
now, I'm gonna show you just how easy this is.
you put the phone here...
turn the machine on, and the computer scans your item.
and then you have an exact 3-D replica of your phone.
right?
now, imagine if you could use this machine to replicate the master plates for the U. S. $100 bill.
that's what Mr. Percy did.
he smuggled the 3-D printer into his office and made an exact replica of the U. S. $100 currency plates.
whoever tossed Percy's apartment must have thought that's where he was hiding the plates.
well, Agent Kershaw said there was a leak in his department, so I'm thinking that's how Wo Fat and the Russian mob got on to it.
either one of them could have been looking for those plates.
well, it definitely wasn't our killer. He knew the plates weren't there.
he had inside information.
he found out about the tattoo, killed Percy and cut it off his arm.
okay, well, there's only one person who knew Percy well enough to know about the tattoo and whether or not he could've been hiding something.
I told you, I don't know.
Roger never said anything about Washington D. C.
or any currency plates.
you mean Percy. Gary Ray Percy.
Percy, Carson, Roger... whatever you want to call him.
he told me he used to sell big-ticket appliances in Denver.
washing machines, ranges, stoves.
Oh, you believed that?
I had no reason not to.
okay, well, here's our problem.
okay, we don't believe you, all right?
so you either give us some better answers, or we're gonna release you from protective custody.
which I think would be a bad thing, 'cause there's a psychopath out there hacking people up.
don't think you want that.
your choice.
after our place was ransacked,
Roger, my boyfriend, started acting all paranoid.
I said,"Okay, we got burglarized. Let's just go to the cops."
but he was all freaked out, and said he didn't want to involve the cops.
so you went to the motel.
what about this guy?
you know this man?
no. - His name is Wo Fat.
you've never met this guy? - No.
okay, who'd you tell about the break-in?
my brother, Tony.
Tony own a shotgun?
think so. Why?
Why? 'Cause it's the last thing your boyfriend saw.
all right, I'm thinking Kammie confides in Tony, all right?
tells him about the break-in, about having to go on the run.
and brother, being the criminal genius that he is, puts two and two together.
realizes Percy was in possession of something valuable.
exactly. Tony tracks down Percy, puts both barrels to his head,
Percy starts talking, he tells him everything.
tells him about the currency plates, about the map tattoo, about the Russian stalking him.
all right, and then Tony kills Percy, makes it look like a mob hit.
that was to throw us off.
well, then he cuts the tattoo off Percy's arm so no one else can find it, and goes on a treasure hunt.
exactly but what Tony does not know is that Wo Fat is looking for the same plates.
Hey. So, I got those hi-res sat photos from the Ko'olau Valley trail system.
great. - Take a look at this.
all right, see those two trees there in the clearing?
they look just like our vic's tattoo.
where was this photo taken?
a trail head at Waimona Ridge.
you think that's where the plates are buried?
if it is, that's where Tony's headed.
formed on Oahu's Leeward Coast, largely inaccessible by car, the Ko'olau Valley lies within the jagged remains of an ancient volcano.
home to a system of treacherous hiking trails that climb some 3, 100 feet above sea level, it's easy to see why Gary Ray Percy chose this location to hide his copies of the $100 engraving plates.
right here.
the GPS says this is the spot.
here are the two banyan trees, there's the mountain, just like the tattoo.
Hey, you see this?
looks like it was just dug up.
guys, over here!
I've got Tony.
whoa, whoa, you, stay back. You, hey, back it up.
plates are gone.
wo Fat must have tracked him here.
the body's still warm.
wo Fat's got to be close.
get out of my way! Go! Move it!
got fresh tracks.
it's Wo Fat!
don't let him get away!
come on, move, move, move!
over here.
he's gone.
we need to secure the perimeter.
I got blood.
well, he can't have got too far.
chin, you all right?
got my vest.
I'm okay.
are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
camera's toast.
what are you doing?
all units, be advised in pursuit of silver Camaro heading east on Pokukaina.
suspect now heading north on Coral Street.
requesting backup.
all available units requested for immediate assistance.
Kono, give me your phone.
this is a burner, all right? Keep it on you.
lay low. We're gonna straighten this out.
we're gonna find you as soon as we can. You got it?
everybody stand down!
Where's Kono?
no idea.
Steve, she was seen getting inside your car outside the Palace.
pop the trunk.
I know you want to protect her, but Kono's wanted for questioning in the murder of Victor Asanuma.
I got to bring her in. - Duke, come on.
you really think she had anything to do with that?
the Crime Lab matched the ballistics to her gun.
how do you explain that?
michael Noshimuri used her gun to pull off the murder.
he set her up.
Victor Asanuma was the star witness in Michael's manslaughter trial.
Duke, you and I both know he's the one who pulled the trigger.
that may be true, Steve, but Kono's in a relationship with Adam Noshimuri.
his father was a Yakuza boss for 30 years.
the prosecuting attorney thinks maybe she did her boyfriend's brother a solid by taking care of his problem.
Duke, you tell the prosecuting attorney we'll deliver him the real killer; we just need some time.
I hope you know what you're doing, Steve.
you know what you're doing, right?
HPD is all over me about Kono.
well, you tell them you don't know anything, all right?
like they'd believe me.
Oh, listen to me.
we just got to keep our stories consistent, okay? That's all.
just tell me about this plane.
hickam picked up an unidentified aircraft.
f-22s were scrambled, but before they could intercept it, the plane landed here.
no markings, no logos, just a tail number.
no. It's not registered with the FAA either.
so we don't know who flew the plane or where it was coming from.
all we got are bodies.
we have five dead.
three were killed by sharp-force trauma
either stabbed or their throats were slit.
the two others were shot.
whoever killed these guys also landed this plane.
know anything else about the victims?
no cell phones or wallets on them.
I'm thinking our suspect must have taken them off the bodies.
also three of our vics have empty holsters.
seem odd to anyone?
not if it was a rendition flight.
what makes you think that?
plane's unregistered, right?
there's no flight recorder in the cockpit.
I'm thinking these five guys were government agents, the killer is their rendition suspect
somebody resourceful enough to be able to kill five feds, then land a jet.
that's one serious national security threat.
Yeah, and now he's loose on the island.
Steve, so I ran your victims through the National Security database.
there ID's as GS8's through the Department of Agriculture.
that's got to be a CIA cover.
what about the plane's registration number?
the tail number's registered to a Webster-Cole Leasing out of Wilmington, Delaware.
it's an executive transpo company.
word is that it's a CIA front company and the feds are using it to transfer ghost detainees to black sites for interrogations.
apparently, it was from Brisbane to Cuba.
I've got nothing yet on the prisoner that they're renditioning.
you get anything off the bloody prints we found on the plane's steering wheel? - Yoke.
what? - It's called a yoke.
the yoke.
Yeah, I ran them, but there were no matches in any of our print databases.
well, of course there wasn't.
the CIA doesn't want him to exist.
good. All we got to do is find an anonymous maniac who butchered five people from getting off the island.
Hey, listen, I got to run, but, um, I-I'll be here if you need anything, okay? All right.
Hey, you! - Hey. I was just coming to find you.
what are you doing here in Hawaii?
I am done.
like, done done?
Yep. In a few weeks, this thing goes in the closet.
I'm through collecting a government check.
so what's the next chapter in the life of Billy Harrington?
how about I tell you over dinner?
I'm seeing someone.
in Amsterdam, you told me that was over.
it was.
and what happened between you and me was real.
and I'll never regret Amsterdam or working together in Kabul, but it's been five years, Billy.
things change.
well...
if things change again, I'll be staying at the Llikai.
it was good to see you. - You, too.
commander, my name is Luis Braga.
I run the Latin American counterterrorism desk here at Langley.
why is Lieutenant Rollins asking questions about a flight that doesn't exist?
your nonexistent flight just landed in Hawaii with five dead aboard.
What?!
you didn't know?
we were transferring a high-value target on that flight.
we keep communications to a minimum for security.
just a suggestion: maybe you ought to pay closer attention, 'cause your high-value target is now in the wind.
Mr. Braga, we can help you, but you have to come clean with us.
who is the prisoner?
what do we know about him?
ever heard of NLM?
national Liberation Movement Latin American terrorist organization.
Salgado's got ten years in.
he was picked up brokering an arms deal in Australia because we think he has knowledge about an upcoming attack.
an attack? Where?
our intel suggests it's domestic, on American soil, and it's going down soon.
okay, what do you want us to do?
I'm sending an action team to Hawaii as we speak, but for now, I need you to carry the ball.
but remember, we need Salgado alive.
it's the only way we'll stop that attack.
whose house?
my family owns it through a holding company.
who else knows that?
just family.
thanks for picking this up.
Kono, you should still be in the hospital.
it's not really an option.
HPD's looking for me.
they think I killed Victor Asanuma.
why do they think you're involved?
cause we found his remains in a barrel in a dockside warehouse.
single tap to the head.
crime Lab tested the bullet, and it was fired from my gun.
what?
how?
your brother.
after he got out of prison, we were under the same roof for a couple of nights.
he must have taken my gun and then returned it to my holster.
did you know he was gonna do that to me?
do you actually think I'd let him do that to you?
I don't know what to think.
you haven't exactly been transparent with me lately.
Hey, if anyone should be questioning loyalty here, it's me.
you used my phone to spy on me.
Adam, I want to believe you.
from the beginning, you said you want out of the family business,
but from everything I'm seeing, you've taken over from your father.
Kono, I told you...
everything I'm doing is to protect us.
Michael's putting together an army to fight me for control of our enterprises.
I need our partners to think I'm still in charge.
I thought you were trying to legitimize the business.
I am. Kono, I promise you, I am.
but it's not that simple.
my father's allies stand to lose a lot of money, so I need to make those moves very quietly.
if they see me as weak, I'm dead.
I'll call you back. What do you got?
pulled the cell phone records of our dead CIA operatives.
one of the phones was used right after the plane landed.
tried to ping it, but it looks like it was turned off right after the calls were made.
made to where?
Five-O!
Hey!
who are you?
Five-O.
rafael Salgado-- where is he?
who?
that's... that's Pedro.
Yeah, that's Pedro Silva.
how do you know him?
he's my son's father, but I haven't seen him in years.
we know he called you twice in the last hour.
no. I received some calls, but they were hang-ups.
he called to see if she was home.
Where's your boy?
excuse me? - Your son. Where is he?
Jack's upstairs. He's playing in his room.
Oh, my God. Where is he?
Where's Jack?
Where's my son?
how long were you two together?
just my sophomore year.
we were... both studying literature in Peru.
Pedro was very political.
I didn't realize how radical he was until he was implicated in a bombing on campus.
two people were killed, and I was pregnant with his baby.
so then you came here.
I got as far away as I could. I didn't...
I didn't want my child to be associated with a murderer.
Jack is all that I've got.
just get my son back, please.
something's not adding up here.
I mean, clearly, Salgado knew about his son the whole time.
so why show up now, when the feds are after him?
APB is out.
tsa's been alerted.
all right, so we got a terrorist who's on the run with a little kid.
he's got limited resources, and he's smart enough not to contact any of his known associates 'cause he knows that we'll be monitoring.
well, then who does Salgado reach out to for help?
no idea.
but I think I know someone who might.
you look tired, Steve.
something keeping you up at night?
a loss of nerve, perhaps?
I sleep fine.
you know this man?
should I?
he's an NLM terrorist.
his name is Rafael Salgado.
I'm familiar with the NLM.
they claim to be ideologically driven, but I think they're just a bunch of thugs and peasants.
this morning, Salgado killed five men and kidnapped his son.
I can't imagine what he has planned for the afternoon.
how do I find him?
what makes you think I can answer that?
a high-value target like this won't last long on his own.
he needs friends the kind of relationships you used to cultivate.
so if you were him, who would you go to for help?
you've come here to ask about a case?
is that all you want to talk about?
I'm giving you the chance to save a little boy's life.
and what's in it for me?
the exercise yard.
15 minutes a day.
you'll get to see the sun again.
I burn easily.
okay.
let's go at this another angle.
you help me...
or I discontinue your pain medication.
what's next?
no dessert?
there's a gentleman named Arturo Casey in Waikiki.
he controls an international investment company called Outrigger Securities.
makes most of his money off the books.
doing what?
he traffics in arms, explosives, chemical weapons, identity papers.
very resourceful, I'm told.
Hey, that's funny, you're the second McGarrett we've had here in 48 hours.
what do you mean, second McGarrett?
Doris McGarrett. You two related?
she came in yesterday morning.
people who worked for my father used this place as a supply depot.
if there's pro my brother killed Victor Asanuma, it's going to be in here somewhere.
you got something?
get out of sight.
Hey.
brother?
what are you doing here?
I need a gun. I got heat.
how much heat?
a lot.
cops are asking questions about those bodies they dug up.
even Kono doesn't trust me.
she cloned my damn phone.
I need to protect myself. You got something?
if you needed a piece, you should've come directly to me.
that's what I'm doing here.
s & W J-Frame.
reliable as a rooster in the morning.
clean, too.
what are you doing? Give me the gun.
it's only a five-shot, so make sure you're close enough to make each one count.
something wrong?
I told you. - No.
something else? - Why?
should there be?
I was just asking.
Thanks, brother. - Appreciate it.
Hey.
you okay? - Yeah.
what was Michael doing in there?
after you left, he searched the van.
I think he was looking for these.
michael must have left them there.
is that blood?
Yeah, and dirt.
if we can match the blood to Asanuma and the dirt to the body dump, that might be enough to take the heat off of me.
and help prove Michael pulled the trigger.
I'm sorry, Adam.
everyone's looking for you, Kono.
that's why I called you.
I need a favor.
what kind of favor?
I need you to run these for DNA.
I'm fighting for my life, Charlie.
evidence on these gloves could put me in the clear.
all right.
Thanks.
I don't know who the hell you think you are, but you just can't walk into my office and arrest me for no reason.
I'll have your badge, you hear me?
okay, Mr. Casey, here's the thing: usually I'd dance with you for a while in here, but I don't have any time today, okay?
so do me a favor, tell me, Rafael Salgado-- where is he?
never heard of him. How would I know?
because, despite the expensive suit and the nice watch, you're just the type of morally bankrupt low-life scumbag who would give him a car, some cash and a fake I. D.okay?
so you've got one minute exactly to tell me everything you know.
and what happens if I decide not to cooperate?
well, it's simple. I'm gonna let you go.
beautiful.
we're on the same page.
not quite.
right after I let you go, I'm gonna spread the word that you were in here, cooperating with Five-O.
and when I tell them that you were squealing like a pig to save your own skin, every animal you've ever helped is gonna start crawling out of the woodwork.
and they've gonna come back and put a bullet in you, your wife and your two kids.
did you just threaten my family?
30 seconds.
you'd have me killed?
this is ridiculous.
20 seconds.
I've got rights!
the Supreme Court says you do not have rights when you provide material support for a foreign terrorist network.
but I'm really glad you're paying attention,'cause you have seven seconds.
time's up.
wait.
listen, Casey said Salgado is driving a black 2010 Escalade, okay?
plate number is Alpha-Zulu-two-five-three-one. All right? - Okay.
alert HPD, and call Catherine after that, see if she can locate it via satellite.
okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
wo Fat just gives you this guy, Arturo Casey I mean, what if he's playing you?
he's not playing me.
listen, now that he's behind bars, he's scared that Casey's gonna poach his turf.
that's why he gave him up in the first place.
this is not about him helping us, it's about him helping himself.
just got your message.
what's so important?
my office. Now.
okay.
you went to see Wo Fat.
why would you do that?
answer my question!
don't yell at me, please, Steve.
no, no. Don't give me the hurt feelings thing, Mom, okay?
because "A," I don't buy it, and "B," I don't care.
tell me right now: what could you possibly have to say to that man?
okay.
I just wanted to look the man in the eye who orchestrated your dad's murder.
changed the course of your life, Steve.
it all started with me.
if I hadn't killed Wo Fat's father, then...
everything would be different.
I got to say, for a former spy, you're, uh...
you're not very good at this at all.
what?
lying, Mom.
I pulled the surveillance video from the prison.
the audio was scrambled purposefully, and your back was conveniently to the camera.
just tell me one thing.
how'd you get the scrambling device past the guards?
I can't work that one out.
you know, if we're gonna be in each other's lives, Steve, you're gonna have to learn to trust me.
you have literally never given me the whole truth.
ever in my life.
and you want me to trust you?
the night Wo Fat came after you, you told me that you two struggled over the gun and he got away.
that was another lie.
I know for a fact that you let him go that night, Doris.
now, why don't you tell me right now why you would do something like that.
why don't you tell me right now who he is to you!
okay, okay...
hey... hey, we got a fix on Salgado's car.
Catherine's gonna put a satellite on it.
okay, thanks. To be continued.
okay.
all right, I've got your black Suburban heading westbound on Harding.
left on Waialae, right on Palolo.
Where's he going, Cath?
somewhere up the Ridge.
there's only one road in and out.
get me a roadblock on Palolo and Kiwila.
Hey!
get out of the car!
out!
on your knees, hands behind your head.
interlock your fingers.
Where's the boy?
Where's Jack?
get up.
where is he?
they took him.
they took my boy.
we know about the phone calls to Lyla, to see if she was home so you could grab your son. - No.
you're lying. - I'm not lying.
I didn't take Jack.
okay, well, here's the part I don't get.
could've hijacked that plane to a non-extradition country.
why would you come here and risk getting caught just to go and kidnap a son you never met?
because I didn't come to kidnap him.
I came here to protect him.
protect him from who?
from the NLM.
they knew the CIA picked you up in Australia, and they went after your kid, didn't they?
I was too late.
they got to him first.
makes sense.
kidnapping is a tactic consistent with NLM security measures.
if an operative is captured, a hit squad is sent to secure his family as collateral.
so they're holding Salgado's son right now to make sure he does not divulge the target of their attack.
the priority is extracting information.
keep Salgado detained.
my team is on ground and will be there any minute to interrogate him.
okay, but he's not gonna give you anything if he knows it means his son is going to die.
my men can be very persuasive.
with all due respect, sir, I agree with Detective Williams.
the best way to get Salgado to talk and to talk quickly is to convince him we can get his son back.
commander, I don't know what it is you have in mind, but it's not happening.
I'm not taking any chances with thousands of lives at stake, even if it means Salgado's son has to die.
I'm sorry?
is that perfectly clear, gentlemen?
Yeah, it's perfectly clear-- connection's no good.
did you just hang up on the CIA?
no, no, I,uh, hung up on a schmuck. A gigantic schmuck.
all right, we're out of time.
so listen carefully.
you killed five CIA operatives.
you murdered hundreds of civilians.
the only choice you have left now is whether or not you want your son's blood on your hands, too.
all right, you want a chance at being a father, here's your shot.
you give us the target, we get your son back-- that is my offer.
why should I trust you?
you should trust us 'cause you don't have a choice, okay?
clearly this kid means something to you, so...
what time is it?
I was on the way to meet the men who took my son when you picked me up.
all right, what'd they want?
my life in exchange for his.
you believe them?
that is the way we operate.
okay, when's the meet?
4: 00. A farm in Kaneohe.
if I'm a minute late, they'll put a bullet in my boy.
we can get to Kaneohe in less than 30 minutes, but you have got to give us something.
what is the target?
what's the target?!
San Francisco.
San Francisco? What...
where in San Francisco?
trust goes both ways, yeah?
I'll tell you that once my son is free.
Catherine, get word out to the authorities in San Francisco.
tell them the NLM are planning an attack.
braga's people just pulled up outside.
okay, they're gonna make us hand him over.
no. If you hand me over now, hundreds of people will die, not just my son.
we have a deal; you made a promise.
let's go.
they got the parking lot covered!
out of the car.
out of the car, let's go!
Five-O. We need your car, buddy. Let's go.
it's Fong.
Hey, Charlie, tell me you got something.
I processed those gloves you gave me and found two sets of DNA.
on the outside, I got a donor match to our victim Victor Asanuma.
and the DNA on the inside came back to Michael Noshimuri.
looks like we found our killer.
okay, Charlie, I need you to get that evidence to McGarrett right away.
copy that.
Yeah, Kono?
you're a good friend.
how did you get in here?
I think those belong to me.
you need to leave. Now!
or I'm calling security.
hang up.
Where's my son?
you are two minutes late.
I'm not exactly familiar with this place.
or maybe you decided to make a stop and talk to the cops?
I did what you asked.
I'm here.
now let my son go.
not in front of my boy.
please.
the deal was my life for his.
we lied.
No!
no, no, no, no, no.
come on.
stay with me.
the target in San Francisco-- where is it?
what is the target?
what is the target?
listen to me.
this man cannot die.
you understand me?
he cannot die.
Max, what are you doing here?
someone broke into the Crime Lab; Charlie Fong was stabbed.
what?
it's bad, Steve; they don't know if he's gonna make it.
we're trying to stabilize your prisoner, but he's demanding to talk to Commander McGarrett.
excuse me, excuse me.
I got the target.
Hey, go, hide.
get away from her!
thank you for finding these.
where did you get those?
she asked you a question, Michael.
your girlfriend tried to burn me.
and you let her.
you started this, Michael, when you stole her gun to kill the man that put you in jail.
he had to go. And so does she.
I was only trying to save your life.
how does putting her away for murder save my life?
you've had a target on your back ever since you crawled in bed with her.
and all I've done is try to protect you.
not anymore.
it stops now.
tonight she dies...
I take over the business, and you're on your own.
No! No! No!
department of Homeland Security, acting on information obtained during an investigation, thwarted an attack at Fisherman's Wharf tonight.
the attack was planned for 8: 00 p. m. taking advantage of the peak dinner-hour crowd.
mommy!
thank you.
how's Fong?
he's in surgery. It's still too early to tell.
it's all my fault.
he's strong, Kono; he'll pull through.
Where's Adam?
you need to leave. Now.
the guys who work for your brother are gonna want payback.
ready? - Ready.
okay, guys, we're all good.
once we get to Shanghai, I'll take you inland.
and don't worry, nobody's ever gonna find you.
how long?
as long as it takes to put all your enemies behind bars.
I'm going with you.
Kono, you can't go with him, okay?
we just cleared your name.
guy's about to go on the lam. It's not good.
I'm not leaving Adam.
okay, Kono, you can't be serious.
you're not actually considering this, right?
Steve, don't stop her.
follow your heart.
I'll take good care of her.
I know you will.
it's not forever.
okay. - Okay?
I'll take that as a promise?
promise.
thank you.
I'm seriously gonna miss you.
take care of these boys for me.
be seeing you.
can I go with you guys, huh?
that, I support. I support that.
mom, I-- can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah.
I mean, he's just gonna end up getting himself shot, so I figure I got to stick around for that, eh?
you'd miss him in a week.
I don't think so.
why are you doing this?
I get to help people you care about.
it's the least I could do.
that's not what I'm talking about, okay? Listen to me.
you don't have to go with them, all right?
you make a phone call, get them squared away. You don't have to get on the boat.
Yeah, but a phone call isn't gonna make people disappear.
and besides, my sources will only deal with me.
soon as I get them situated, I'll be back.
okay? To be continued.
Yeah, to be continued.
okay? Yeah.
I'll miss you.
sometimes I wonder how different things would have been if you hadn't blown out your knee.
cousin, I don't even know what life would be like if I wasn't cop.
I love you.
time to go.
okay.
are you sure?
Yeah.
Hi. It's, uh, Chin Ho Kelly calling.
look, I know it's been a while.
Yes, well, in my defense, you did say to call when I was ready.
Yeah.
um, listen, I,uh, I can't promise anything as exciting as a prison riot, but, um, if you're still up for it, I'd love to take you on a second date.
um, great.
I don't know what I was thinking.
thank you for coming, Commander.
don't flatter yourself.
I was coming even if you hadn't asked.
Yes.
you want to know why your mother paid me a visit.
I can answer that.
but first, you're going to do something for me.
and what's that?
you're going to get me out of here.
is that so?
you set me up?
Yes, but not in the way you think.
they're not here to break me out.
they're here to kill me.
and you're the only one who can protect me from them.
from who?
who are "they"?
you need to leave. Now.
the guys who work for your brother are gonna want payback.
I'm going with you.
follow your heart.
I'll take good care of her.
I know you will.
it's packed with trout.
it's a good thing, too, because we're gonna be here a while.
I didn't know you fish.
Yeah, in the... "Man versus nature" category of activities,
I'd say fishing ranks as my top two or three.
you're lucky.
my father never let us fish.
he said it was for peasants.
huh. Well, then I'm just gonna have to teach you.
till then ...
I catch 'em, you clean 'em.
deal.
but you're doing the dishes.
nice try.
let me get cleaned up.
all right.
Hello?
Kono, it's Chin.
listen to me very carefully. There's been a security breach.
your location has been compromised.
by who? - The NLM.
we believe they sold your location to the Yakuza.
you and Adam need to get out of there right now.
just do it, Kono! Go!
who was that?
we need to leave. Now.
what?
don't pack, don't take anything, let's just go.
what's going on?
you all right?
Yeah. You?
Yeah. Let's go.
where are we going?
hell if I know.
michael Maki?
welcome to Oahu, Mr. Smith.
let me help you with that.
good flight?
not bad.
you here for business or pleasure?
little of both.
well, let's get you to your hotel, so you can kick off those boots and hit the beach.
car's right over here.
dispatch said you asked for me by name.
have I met you before?
I don't think I have...
cause I would remember a guy like you.
play ball!
strike!
Aw, come on.
batting ninth for the Honolulu Shrimps, number seven, Grace Williams.
okay, baby, come on. Only the good ones. Let's go.
okay, let's go, let's go!
what do you say, number seven?
what do you say, baby? Come on! - Come on, Grace! Batter up there, baby. Come on.
here we go, Sam.
straight down the middle. Here we go.
strike!
good cut, baby, good cut. Hey, Grace.
look at me. Hands up, elbow up, sit down on that back foot, okay?
sit down a little bit, all right? - No, no, no.
grace, Grace, listen to me.
bring your hands up a couple of inches, drop your elbow, okay?
all right, here we go, Grace!
strike two!
nice!
you, come here, please. Time-out, please.
okay, listen.
um, we, uh, we love Uncle Steve very much, right?
okay, good.
but he doesn't know anything about baseball.
so I want you to stop listening to him, and I want you to listen to me only.
you understand?
you gonna keep talking or we gonna play some ball?
all right, baby, come on. Let's go. Swing away.
come on. Let's go. Swing away.
throw the heat, Sam. She can't hit what she can't see.
strike three! There we go.
you're out! - Come on.
Yes! Sorry, sistah.
Hey, what are you talking about?!
in where... Hey.
how was that a strike?
in what world was that a strike?
sorry, I call 'em like I see 'em, brah.
Oh, yeah?
okay, good. How about this?
how about that?
you see that?
that's me kicking dirt on your shoe.
do you see that?
all right, guys, remember we were talking about sportsmanship?
this right here, that's not it.
huh? How about that?
you... out of here!
okay.
hold on, hold on, hold on.
excuse me, excuse me.
um, Kame... whoa, whoa, whoa. - Look.
I saw it, okay?
this is peewee ball; you can't eject somebody.
you... out of here, too!
two of you, out of here!
Hey, Coach, your phone's ringing.
Thanks, Johnny.
C. O. D. appears to be two close-contact gunshot wounds to the back of the head.
we get an I.D.?
uh, he doesn't appear to have any identification on him.
we know how long he was in the water?
well, based on the condition of his skin,
I say no more than a few hours.
okay, my guess: he was dumped from a boat, weighted down with something heavy until the rope slipped off.
look at these linear abrasions on his wrists.
they suggest that the victim was tied up and unable to defend himself while he sustained these facial injuries.
and beat him before they killed him.
Max, let's get the prints to the lab.
see if we can work out who this guy is and why it went down the way it did.
commander.
yeah?
okay, thanks.
you good?
ready?
let's go.
what are you looking at? What?
what do you mean "What?"
you don't think I saw that little handoff between you and Max?
what is it?
read it. - I'm gonna read it.
you, uh... you had Max run your DNA against Wo Fat?
that's right.
why on earth would you do something like that?
why... I would do something like that, because I suspected that we might be half-brothers.
you and Wo Fat?
it's the only explanation I could come up with, okay?
wo Fat-- he's a sociopath, he's a terrorist, he had my father killed, yet my mother is protecting him.
she's been protecting him the whole time.
why would she do that? I can't figure it out.
but, uh, just so I'm clear, you-you say he's a psychopath, he's-he's a sociopath, so you just automatically assume you two are brothers.
makes sense to me.
I got nothing else. I... Give me something else.
well, this clearly states that he is not your brother.
so maybe your mother's just trying to protect you.
from what?
well, uh, the way I see it, this thing between you and Wo Fat, it ends two... two ways.
one of which, you are dead.
uh, so maybe your mother, by visiting him in prison, she's trying to make peace.
maybe end the blood feud before someone else gets hurt.
no. - No.
not my mother. Come on, you know Doris.
she's up to something.
she's up to something. I just wish to hell I knew what it was.
okay, try it now.
come on.
Yeah!
all right.
okay.
is there anything you can't do?
cook and clean.
all right, we're in trouble then, 'cause that makes two of us.
Oh, no.
all right, let's get out of here.
you got a little, uh... something.
okay, so where to?
hangchow.
about a hundred miles.
you think we'll be safer in the city?
I don't know.
but it's got the closest airport.
so we're getting out of China?
we're not.
you are.
you saw what happened back there.
my brother's army will keep coming after us until we're dead.
so we fight them off like we did back...
no, Kono. There's no way to win this.
I'm not leaving you.
I didn't come this far to walk away...
you're not listening to me.
you stay with me, we're both dead.
it's just a matter of time.
they'll find us sooner than later.
so we find them first.
what are you saying?
we hit them before they hit us.
hard.
so they don't get up.
I never liked playing defense.
you're crazy, you know that?
look at this-- reunited.
how's it feel, baby? It feel good?
Yeah, I.T. just installed her.
64-bit core processor.
next gen ultra HD adjustable display.
Floatware, voice command.
that's great-- you two should get a room.
you guys don't want to give her a spin?
no. - Look, hey, if, uh, it doesn't heat up a pizza,
I got no use for it.
chin, did we get the I. D. on the vic from the lab?
Yeah, actually it just came in.
guy's name is Michael Maki.
as you can see, he's got a rap sheet.
mostly drug offenses.
parole puts him as a driver for Pacific Isles Limousine.
I reached out to the manager there, who told me that Maki confirmed an airport pick-up a few hours ago.
now, the client gave his name as John Smith.
and he requested Maki to be his driver by name.
why would he do that?
that's a very good question considering the limo company says that Smith is a first-time customer.
now, Maki never checked in, so the manager says that he tried to locate him using the limo's GPS, but it was disabled once they left the airport.
okay, well, uh, John Smith.
we know our suspect is very creative.
Yeah, but he gets the job done. I mean, two shots to the back of the head, close range, on a parolee with a history of drug trafficking.
body dump to cover up the crime. I mean, this looks like a hit to me.
Yeah, I'll pull the surveillance footage from the airport, both inside and out, along with the flight manifests for arrivals around the time of Maki's pick up.
let's see if we can't find this Mr. Smith.
excuse me, gentlemen.
Billy Harrington. What are you doing here, man?
how you doing?
it's been a long time.
Yeah, man, last time I saw you, you were reassigned to some classified op?
Yeah, it was a hot extraction out of North Korea.
right, that... I'm sorry about that.
no, no problem, don't worry about it.
look, I'm-I'm sorry that I, uh, dropped by like this, but I just needed to talk to you and thought it was better if I did it in person.
Yeah, of course. Come on in.
what can I do for you, man?
well, I don't know if you heard, but I cut away from the navy.
Congratulations.
what are you doing for work?
uh, actually that's why I'm here.
I'm starting a private security firm.
all right.
and I wanted you to hear it from me first that I offered Catherine a job running my intel department.
sounds like a great opportunity if she was ready to leave the navy.
she didn't tell you, did she?
uh, no, she didn't.
me and my big mouth.
did she take the job?
actually no, she turned it down.
she say why?
no, but if I had to read between the lines,
I think that she's worried that working with me might affect her relationship with you.
come on, man, look.
I know you guys had a thing...
then you know it's over.
and you know me, we served together,
I would never do anything to get between the two of you.
come on, Steve.
the only reason I'm here is because Catherine is hands down the best person for the job.
I know that, look. She'd be an incredible asset to any team.
let me talk to her.
all right.
come check this out.
are we good?
we're good. Thank you.
I'll walk you out.
so, this is footage from the arrivals terminal.
check out the cowboy.
now we lose him for a minute here.
then we pick him up outside.
here.
chin, freeze that. Run facial rec.
our killer's a cop.
this happened in '92.
ray Harper was a rookie cashing his first paycheck as a ranger.
hell of a way to start to a career.
Oh, it gets better.
harper ended up becoming one of the most decorated officers in the history of the Ranger Division.
okay, tell me this.
why would a hero travel all the way to Hawaii just to murder a limo driver?
maybe our victim is part of a case that Harper was working.
I thought that, too, but then I spoke to his commander.
harper was injured in a shoot-out a little while ago.
he was riding a desk for six months.
he's supposed to be on vacation.
nothing says R and R like whacking somebody out, right?
Yeah, flagged him with Homeland Security.
neither Harper nor his alias has shown up in any passenger manifests leaving the island.
okay, uh, Harper comes here to kill Maki.
he's already done that. What's he still doing here?
maybe he's not finished.
now is that any way to welcome a man into your home?
who are you?
what do you want?
I'm just, uh, looking for a guy and a girl.
I'm told you know where I can find them.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do.
michael Maki says you do.
who?
okay.
you want to play that game?
what the hell do you want, man?
I prefer chunky, but this'll do.
everything all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
I heard Billy stopped by.
Billy did stop by.
about that... - Yeah, listen.
the only reason I didn't say anything to you about leaving the navy was because I wasn't sure.
and-and that was a decision that I had to make on my own.
on your own or with Billy?
okay, no, listen. My C. O. told him that I was thinking about resigning my commission.
I haven't even submitted my letter yet.
so you're actually serious about this.
I've spent half my life in the navy, Steve.
it's like I need to start thinking about what's next.
all right, so why would you, uh, why would you turn down the job with Billy?
not right for me.
Catherine, it's tailor-made for you-- recon and surveillance, risk assessment, protection services?
please.
why would you say no?
because I'm really happy right now.
I mean, things are good between us.
and I don't want a job--even if it's the perfect job to get in the way of that.
HPD just found Maki's limo parked outside a house in Waipahu.
excuse me.
okay, tell HPD to secure the perimeter. No exits, No entries.
we're on the way. - All right.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna miss seeing you in those cammies.
I got to go.
Yeah.
look at this.
look what arrived. Beautiful, huh?
looks nice.
what are you doing? - Let's go.
that sounds good.
you're not gonna let me drive my new car?
you're a real jerk, you know that?
you're grinding the thing. - I'm not grinding the thing.
would you please...? - What are you talking about?
this thing is an animal. Let me tell you about...
zero to 60 in under five.
under five, okay?
corners like it's stuck to the road.
it's a dream. I love this car.
are you enjoying yourself? - I am. I am.
good.
are you enjoying yourself as much as you enjoyed having that conversation with your girlfriend's ex-boyfriend?
what are you talking about? Billy's...
Billy's opening a private security firm, okay?
he heard Catherine was leaving the navy.
he wants to offer her a job.
came to me out of respect to make sure it was okay.
okay, well, uh, I'm gonna just take a stab here.
did he tell you that, uh, offering her the job has nothing to do with their past relationship, all due respect to you, and that she-she's the only person for the position?
Yes, that's actually exactly what he said.
ha, that's funny.
did he also say that you should convince her to take the job?
which, by the way is a terrible idea.
Wait-wait, stop, stop.- Okay.
Billy's a solid guy.
"guy" being the operative word here.
the guy who is gonna be working long, hard hours with your beautiful, intelligent, sexy, attractive girlfriend.
Danny, Billy and I served together.
we saw action together.
he's all about integrity and character.
that is exactly why it is a terrible idea.
that doesn't make any sense.
you see, that is why you will never see it coming, pal.
you are complacent, okay?
you need to fortify your position.
at all times, at all times, you need to protect your queen like, uh, chess.
no, not like in chess, Danny.
in chess, the queen is a fighting piece, and you use her to protect the king.
what are you talking about? - Okay, okay.
it was a metaphor. It was a metaphor for you losing the best thing that ever happened to you.
there's nothing to worry about. Catherine, she turned the job down.
good. Her decision? - Yeah, I told her to take the job.
very good. Her decision. Makes you look like the confident, understanding, boyfriend. Everything is good.
all right.
she's gonna need a job, Danny.
we'll get her a job! You know, there's got to be a testosterone-free workplace somewhere on this island.
I mean, we'll get her a job at a convent, nice women's charity, sell donuts, I don't know. Something. The point is, it is good that she did not take that job, trust me.
trust me. As a friend, I know these things.
no one's been in or out since we got here.
that's Maki's limo.
we know who owns this place?
it's a rental. Name on the lease is Tom Akuna.
he has priors for drugs and assault with a firearm.
no known association with our suspect Harper.
okay, let's go.
clear.
I'm clear. - Clear.
I got fresh blood.
all right, well, if Harper killed Akuna, then where is the body?
I got at least 75K here.
Ah, so he was obviously after the money.
all right, Harper left the limo here, which means he's gotta be driving Akuna's car, right?
chin, find out what that is, get an APB out.
we find that car, we find our killer.
you're dead! You hear me?
you son of a bitch! You're a dead man!
you don't know who you're dealing with.
you were born here, right?
what's it to you?
I was making small talk.
it took me ten hours and two planes to get here.
not a whole hell of a lot to do sitting in a tin can at 30, 000 feet.
of course, there's movies, but for my money, they haven't made a good one since Godfather.
godfather?
arguably, Part II was a better movie, but that's just a matter of taste.
what the hell are you doing?!
you ever read those in-flight magazines, Tom?
you know, the ones they stick behind the seat with the vomit bags?
most people don't pay much mind.
they're too busy listening to music or watching the aforementioned crap that passes for entertainment.
me? Call me old-fashioned, but I'm a reader.
I'll read anything you put in front of me.
and those in-flight magazines, they're good reading.
for instance, there was this one story about the rat population on this island.
seems that those nasty little rodents just ruined the sugarcane crop.
then about a hundred years ago some genius decided to import Indian mongoose from Jamaica to exterminate those rats.
now, on the surface, that seemed like a hell of a good plan, 'cause the mongoose is a natural predator of the rat, but what our well-intentioned friend didn't understand was that this particular species of rat is nocturnal.
which means they're active at night.
whereas the mongoose is diurnal.
Yeah, yeah, I had to look that one up, too.
it means they're a daytime creature.
so, as you can imagine, those rats to this very day are running around these fields all night long.
and you know what they like even more than sugarcane?
I'll give you one guess.
Hey, you can't do this to me. You hear me?!
seems to me it's already done.
if you don't mind, I'm gonna hit the road.
when it comes to rats, I'm a little squeamish.
Hey, you can't do this to me! You hear me?!
okay, all right.
those two you're looking for, I know where they are.
where is she?!
start talking, or so help me God, I'll put a bullet in your face.
Hey! Five-O! Drop the gun.
drop the gun right now.
come back later.
it's over, Ray. Put down the gun. Come on.
I'm about to question this young man on a very pressing matter.
I'm not gonna let you stop me from doing that.
I'm about to shoot you in the back of the head if you don't put that gun down, Ray.
I'm guessing you gentlemen are packing nines, which means you have plenty of firepower.
the question is, how fast are you on the trigger?
me, I got a simple six-shot Colt, but I'm quick and I'm one hell of a shot.
chances are, we tangle, one of you is going down.
I wouldn't bet on that.
put the gun down.
you're making a big mistake.
you know, Michael Maki's body washing up on that beach like that?
that was shoddy work, Ray.
it was very disappointing for a man who is supposed to know how to cover his tracks.
I mean, you disabled the GPS in the limo, but you missed the tracking system on Akuna's car.
what's the matter with you, Ray?
you might as well have sent us an invite to the kid's hotel room.
tell me, were you gonna kill that kid like you killed Maki?
I didn't kill Maki.
and I suppose you didn't kill Akuna either.
that's right.
then why don't you tell me where he is then?
all right, Carl, maybe, uh, maybe you could help me out with something.
I got, uh, I got seven unsolved robberies the last 24 hours, all over town.
our suspect is a white male, black ski mask, uh, silver gun.
total take, about six grand in small bills.
what, uh, what can you tell me?
okay, explain something to me.
why is it that a kid with no record till today would travel 4, 000 miles to Oahu to, uh... commit a bunch of silly-ass stickups?
what, they don't have convenience stores in San Antonio?
it's-it's not what you think.
okay, well, then enlighten me, please.
and start by telling me how you know Ray Harper, and why would he put a gun in your face?
no?
who's that?
hmm? Nobody?
who is it?
see, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you-you care a lot about this girl, okay, 'cause the smile on your face right here is a lot different than the look you got on your face right now.
I know something is going on, and know that it's a lot bigger than these goofy little stickups, okay?
so tell me what it is, and I will help you, I promise.
okay, so my guy's not saying anything, but he's got a friend.
I'm thinking we can get to her, we could maybe get some answers.
who is she?
who is she, Ray?
it's the same girl, Ray. Who is she?
is this your daughter?
is she your daughter?
her name is Amanda, and she's not just my daughter.
she's my life.
okay, well, do Amanda a favor and trust us on this, okay?
you need to tell us. Where is she?
is she in trouble?
I don't know.
couldn't find her.
that kid you stopped me from questioning knows where she is.
Carl, you have five seconds, okay?
five seconds to tell me where Amanda is or I'm gonna let her father come in here and ask you himself, and I promise you, he's not gonna be as polite as me, okay?
look, I-I-I don't know where she is. I swear.
this whole thing just got way out of hand.
what whole thing?
I got involved with some guys that I went to school with back in San Antonio.
they offered me two grand, a limo and a couple plane tickets.
all I had to do was take a bag of cash out to some of their friends in North Shore.
and they told me to bring a girl because it would be less suspicious.
Amanda, she didn't know anything about any of this.
okay, how much cash?
75000$
did you make the delivery?
no, no. We got robbed on the way.
some guy in a ski mask jacked us at a stoplight.
okay, well, either they are the luckiest thieves on planet Earth or you were set up.
that kid wasn't even on my radar.
Amanda doesn't talk to me about boys.
what about Amanda's mother?
she took off when Amanda was three.
I've been raising her on my own ever since.
about two weeks ago, Amanda started begging me to let her go on a trip to Hawaii with a girlfriend's family.
she's a good kid, she's never been in trouble.
I had no reason not to trust her.
I told her to call me when she got settled.
she never did.
she wouldn't go 24 hours without calling me.
it's just not the way she was raised.
I tried her phone, but every time I called, it went straight to voice mail, so I did some digging.
found out she didn't go with her girlfriend, she went with this Jacobson kid.
and I followed his trail.
okay, so that's how you found Michael Maki.
with a little Texas charm, he told me he picked the kids up.
they were supposed to drop off a bag of money when they got robbed.
then he drove 'em to this middleman Akuna's house to figure out what to do.
well, so who killed Maki?
I don't know.
when I left him, he was hurting, but very much alive.
well, what about Akuna?
I cut him loose since he pointed me towards Jacobson.
this guy Akuna sent me to... to meet his boss.
he told me if I told his boss everything, he sh-should understand.
let me guess: he didn't understand.
no.
why would you not he sh-should understand.
no offense, but I don't know you.
which means I don't trust you.
when I looked into this, I realized Amanda could be in some trouble with some real players.
I wouldn't put her life in your hands or anyone else's.
ballistics came back on the bullets Max pulled from Maki's skull.
they're not a match to Ray's Colt.
all right, so Ray's telling the truth.
okay, uh, the kid messed up.
the guys that he was supposed to deliver the money to, they have Amanda.
if they don't get the money in 48 hours, they are going to kill her.
what are you doing?
let's go find your daughter.
don't move. Don't move!
turn the water off.
you set those kids up.
Maki told you about the money drop, you two figured it'd be an easy score.
who killed Maki?
the guys that we work for.
that's a smart move, ripping off your bosses.
right, they know it was an inside job.
they don't know we took their cash.
Maki's dead because they found out he talked to a cop.
which makes you their next victim.
you guys have to take me with you, yeah?
you want my protection?
why don't you tell me where Amanda is?
she's not with Carl. Where is she?
I'm not gonna ask you again.
so according to Akuna,
Amanda's probably being held in one of the upstairs bedrooms in this house.
okay, look.
it's really simple.
you're gonna go in there-- look at me.
give 'em the money, get Amanda back, get the hell out of there.
make sense?
I'm gonna need a "yes" or "no.
uh, I think so.
that'll do.
all right, Carl. It's go time, buddy. Saddle up.
"saddle up"? Really?
thought it was appropriate.
relax, Carl. You can do this.
okay? Everything's going to be fine.
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just here for Amanda.
I... I have the money. It's all right here.
whoa. Hey, wait!
wait... wait, hey, what are you doing? Hey, you-you said if I...
if I brought you the money...
I have all the money, it's right here.
now, where's... where's Amanda?
change of plans.
what... what do you mean, change of plans? Where's Amanda?
I got a better deal.
I sold her.
Hey! No, no, please! I did what you asked!
Where's my daughter?
Hey, stupid.
Amanda? - Daddy!
Amanda! Hold on, baby!
daddy!
daddy, Daddy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
it's okay, baby.
it's okay.
Danno, what do you want me to do?
I want you to go have fun.
do whatever feels right, all right? Okay. Keep your eye on the ball and have fun.
listen to your dad, all right?
okay.
all right, come on.
all right, Shrimps, let's go!
come on, number seven, what do you say? What do you say? What do you say?
go, number seven. Have fun, Grace.
have fun, Grace.
strike!
little outside, monkey.
good swing, a little outside.
let's go, keep your eye on the ball. Shrimp dogs!
it's all right, hang in there. - ere we go, Grace!
come on!
all right, wait for the pitch now, wait for the pitch, you got this.
take the job.
Steve, I'm not...
no, no, listen to me, Catherine.
we're good.
nothing's gonna change that.
strike two!
good job, monkey.
good swing.
just have fun up there, babe, okay?
it's all right, shake it off, have fun.
take the job.
time out!
there's no kissing in baseball, Steve.
Sorry!-- What do you mean, time out?
love.
let's play ball!
all right, all right, here we go, Grace.
come on, monkey, be a batter up there, be a batter up there.
wait for the pitch, now, wait for the pitch, you got this.
roll with the pitch. All right.
that's right, that's right.
let's go, go on, Gracie.
now, monkey, run! Go, go, go!
go, monkey, run! Go, go, go!
I tell you, James.
there's no virtue if there's no immorality.
I met a waitress last night.
big.
I mean big ol' butt on her.
a waitress with a big butt doesn't seem so uncommon.
perfectly uncommon.
like 20 pounds of sunshine in a 10-pound bag.
Mmm!
how's your wife? - Oh, she good.
the girls? - They great.
trip the alarm, will ya?
it's time to do this, baby girl.
it's all clear.
eight minutes. Not bad.
gung-ho bastards. Must be rookies.
ha ha.
let's go, let's go!
move that door a little. I got it.
Sid Vicious, Otis Redding.
tim Buckley, and Karen Carpenter.
overdose, plane crash, overdose, and underdose.
ten minutes forty.
the Battle of Chalons.
451 A. D.
Attila's defeat by Aetius.
duck!
it's another false alarm.
let's get out of here.
26 minutes.
we've officially cried wolf.
you know Mother Teresa didn't believe in God.
no?
no.
watch your feet.
you're kidding, right?
mother Teresa did not believe in God.
you can't say that.
she definitely questioned his existence in some of her letters.
are you guilt-reading again?
listen.
after she heard Jesus' voice on the train to Darjeeling.
allegedly. And if so, she never heard from him again.
well, I can see how she could doubt.
but not to believe? I don't buy it.
maybe she was faking it.
faking it?
because we all know how much fun it is to work with lepers.
can we work now?
Oh, I'm done.
Yeah, baby!
done a trick. Done a trick, baby.
that's it. That's it, baby.
that's how we roll.
strict signal, baby.
that's right, yeah. We did it, baby.
who's the man now, huh?
police! Freeze!
get down.
Hey, Mike.
uh! Come here!
come on, baby!
put the gun down!
put the gun down or I will kill him!
get back!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him right here.
put it down, Lutha.
put the gun down.
you bitch!
how we doing, Bill?
pretty good. I got some of those self-help tapes.
you know, Personal Power.
I'm hoping it'll help me with some of my weight issues.
you know, everybody says "do more cardio."
but my knees just can't-- -I meant how are we doing here?
Oh. Multiple alarms.
Hollywood division responded three times then logged it as an alarm malfunction.
good police work there, huh?
anyway, uh, last alarm went off at 3: 00.
guy opened up at 9: 00.
point of entry-- the sledgehammered door.
point of exit.
the sledgehammered door. -Bingo.
you got a list of the stolen items?
uh, item. Singular.
the owner gave us a picture.
it's an Incan talisman. That means good luck charm.
actually, a talisman is, uh, used to ward off evil spirits.
just saying it didn't work, is all.
anyway, it's valued at about eight grand.
what they didn't take was the bracelet that was sitting next to it.
which costs over 80.
good work on the safe too. Immaculate.
we're never going to solve this one.
a good cop would.
right.
keep your enemies close.
how's it going, baby?
never call me baby.
the name's Lola.
I'm Ricky. You hurt my upper lip. - I'm here for the job. Not dinner and a movie.
look at this guy.
I ain't working with no mothball. - Ooh.
how's it going, baby?
I'm Lola.
they call me Pops. Shall we?
he hurt my lower lip.
who are you?
who am I?
I'm Gatsby.
I'm freakin' Spartacus.
but my name, for your purposes, is James.
never Jimmy. Never Jim. And never, ever, Jimbo.
James.
Hi, James. Where's the pisser?
long bus ride.
you're all here because you are the very best at what you do.
that being said, this job is going to be dangerous.
possibly deadly.
but extremely lucrative.
how much we talking about, Mick?
half a billion.
billion. With a B?
Yeah.
welcome to Rodeo Drive.
quite possibly the most expensive three-block stretch in the world.
anything worth stealing can be found right here.
it is also home to three of the most exclusive jewelry stores in the world.
so which one we gonna hit?
all of them.
whoa, whoa. Hold on, Mick.
I'm as horny as the next guy for half a billion.
but how in the hell do you plan on pulling this off?
not how. When. - When?
tomorrow.
you're insane.
no. We go during Academy Awards week.
when the most expensive jewelry on the planet will be moving through these stores.
so where do we start?
we'll need some working capital.
Ooh, a bank?
no, dummy. We're going to take out a small business loan.
Yes.
a bank.
I'm just saying, your people don't make good quarterbacks.
what? Your people. They don't make good quarterbacks.
now you're an idiot and a racist.
Vick, McNabb, Culpepper, McNair.
how would you feel if I said all Irish people were drunks?
well, we have to be, to put up with the blacks.
what did you say?
Oh, I'm sorry. African Americans.
Billy, they want us in the briefing room.
good.
I think I made my point here.
last night's jewelry store robbery had no witnesses, no prints, no physical evidence.
I've asked Metro to surveil a couple of stores...
so did you call that girl? - Yeah.
she give you a wrong number? - Yeah.
is there something you want to share, Detective?
maybe. Can I take my pants off?
Hey!
wanna go two out of three?
then shut your mouth and listen.
as detectives, you all suck, okay?
got the job, got lazy, and figured you could what?
phone it in until your pensions kicked in?
well, that's done. Over.
because bottom line is, I'm not going anywhere.
so you better hurry up and get serious about your jobs.
otherwise I will kick your asses straight out of RHD.
all right. That's all.
evans and O'Brien. Stay for a second.
Yes, Detective?
I'm making a partner change.
I want you working with O'Brien.
no. With him? No.
Yes.
let's see if we can get some better chemistry going on in this division.
you know what? I want to go on record as being strongly opposed to this move, all right?
he's, he's lazy. He's obnoxious. He's fat. He's racist.
I'm standing right here.
request a transfer if you don't like it.
now come on. Let's get to work.
this is just like Lethal Weapon.
except I actually do hate you.
who you supposed to be, Mel Gibson? -Eh.
pizza.
how you doing, it's 17-- - Whoa, man!
why you rob banks, Mick?
because that's where the money is.
grander scale.
like instead of being a fireman or a shortstop?
why not be a fireman?
I don't like the hats.
point the camera that way.
four eyes in the sky.
two guards. One Social Security, one in diapers.
bulletproof glass. -Bullet resistant acrylic.
only an inch and a quarter thick.
everybody is cutting corners.
ultimately how I turned out is probably a product of my childhood and my inability to believe in systems.
so...
you've given this some thought. -Sure.
once I saw how things worked, or didn't work, the absurdity of it all--I guess I'm talking about consciousness here.
robbing faceless, hegemonic corporations seemed, in a strange way, the right thing to do.
I'm speaking just for me. Can you get the vault from here?
I'm on it.
have you ever tried a non-authoritarian collective like a Kibbutz?
I have.
it doesn't work for me.
Oh, no.
look over there.
I think it's time to leave.
what? Why?
well, it's a little warm for a giant parka. Don't you think?
you saying he's here-- - Well, it looks that way.
unbelievable. He going to rob this joint before us?
that ain't right. Look, I'm going to say something to him.
let's not get caught up in this drama. - That's just rude, is all that is.
you're not calling this in. - Oh, hell yeah.
there's a bank robbery happening right now.
california Financial at the corner of Ventura and Reed.
hurry.
you're very competitive.
all right, this is a robbery!
everybody down!
I said everybody down!
you know, you really made it more difficult on him by calling it in.
well, he should have been more well-mannered.
besides, we can get some nice tactical footage of our police friends in action.
Hey, hurry up, man!
hurry up, hurry up.
stop right there!
now! I said stop!
drop the bags!
I said, drop the bags.
drop the bags!
I said, keep them up.
well, that's that. Let's get out of here.
damn amateurs. Spoiling it for everybody.
you know, I'm sick of these fools.
maybe I shouldn't call it in.
this is awful.
looks like a miniature golf course.
Hey, I got something over here.
you got something?
write this down.
remaining eye, unresponsive.
Oh that's sick, man. I ain't writing that down.
why would this guy blow himself up?
what do you got, Doug?
radio detonator.
someone could have set it off by remote.
cell phone, even.
he definitely did not trigger it himself.
this kid was no bank robber.
he was a hostage.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
you guys.
we're changing the file log.
from suicide to homicide.
Oh. Somebody else triggered the bomb.
Yeah.
find out who.
so, you hungry? Grab a bite?
tacos, maybe.
man, you just finished picking an eyeball off the street.
how can you even think about food?
focus.
you--you-- not right in the head, man.
Hi, it's me.
sorry I'm late.
Hi.
she's in the other room.
she had a good day. - Great.
see you tomorrow. - Thanks.
you've gotten more beautiful again.
I know you?
you know me.
I'm your husband.
of course you are, George.
george was your first husband.
he died.
I'm Robert.
it was a lovely funeral.
blue violets are my favorite flower.
I know.
when did you get here?
just now.
you haven't been getting into trouble.
no. No trouble.
you know, for me, it's not about the money.
it's about-- the thrill.
for me it's the money.
that's what I meant.
like, the thrill of the money.
like seeing it lying out on the table in front of you.
spread out, spilling out.
that is thrilling.
you're in it or the thrill, right?
kind of a thrill-seeker?
I'm actually quite calculating.
that's what I meant. You calculate your thrills.
you're thrilled by the money.
like me.
so...
I'm right.
you're an idiot.
do you like music?
cause I have made a perfect mix for this heist.
great.
a moron with a soundtrack.
it's okay.
I have extras.
I work out.
three times a week.
you should try four.
okay.
set up the equipment in the trunk.
when?
now.
did you get it?
got it.
did you see her naked?
Yeah. We took a shower together.
Oh, that is so hot.
let's see what this lady cop is into.
visa.
master Card.
driver's license.
I gotta get this back.
start the car and keep it running.
I think I love you.
excuse me.
is that yours?
it looked like it fell out of your locker.
Thanks.
sure. Have a good one.
what do we have on the cop?
pretty dull. Mostly credit card debt.
health club, restaurants.
a bit of a shoe whore.
I did find something.
dancing lessons.
I'm going to check it out tonight.
Oh, I got it.
you think it's smart to show your face this early?
I said I got it.
fine.
chin up.
uh, ma'am?
ma'am.
I got to tell you, that was real slick.
I'm sorry. Do I know you?
store security. Please open your jacket.
I'm a cop.
and I'm flattered you go against your oath as a peace officer.
however, taking an 8-pack of Gillette Daisy razors is not a good way to meet someone.
now hand over the loot, lady.
you're not store security.
no.
but if I was, you'd have a real problem right now.
you look familiar.
have I ever arrested you?
dance class.
Ah, yes. That's right. Dance class.
just started. I, uh, I'm Mickey.
Amy.
so, uh, Amy the cop.
why take the razors?
ever tried waxing? - Once.
never again.
so, which is more fun?
the cops?
or the robbers?
I don't know yet.
Hey, Janey. How'd it go?
sorry I didn't make it. I really wanted to be here.
didn't go so well, huh?
it's not that.
she thought she saw her father tonight.
he's been dead seven years.
I know.
let's just give her a little space.
throw me the keys!
sorry, Mick.
this is Detective Sykes, Robbery Homicide.
I have seven reports from the Cal Financial bank robbery.
the manifest report said there were eight units on scene.
can you find that missing report?
excuse me, Detective?
Thanks.
um, I'm going to have to call you back.
another pizza delivery guy was reported missing about two hours ago.
that's what's taking so long.
delivery was to a motel room.
the room was cleared out by the time a black and white got there.
these guys are going again. What do we got on the first bank?
well, the bank received a large delivery of money that Thursday night before closing, so I figured-- -We figure.
they hit it early Friday before the factory workers had a chance to cash their payroll checks.
it's close to freeway exits, and it also gave them a location where they got maximum police on-scene time.
it's eight and a half minutes.
okay, I want you to find me every bank that fits that profile.
work your sources.
somebody's going to keep trying until they get this right.
what makes you so sure?
they didn't get the money.
I have a feeling we won't have to rob a bank after all.
all the news reports said witnesses saw him get out of the cab and into the bank.
the cab pulls away just before the first cop car gets there. Why?
how would he know the cops are coming, and why would he care?
he's just waiting on a fare.
unless that cab was my man's getaway car.
bingo.
okay.
but what if the cab was stolen?
already checked. Wasn't.
so if the cab is in on it, all we have to do is get an address on him and stake him.
Ricky and Lola are already on it.
so, why you tellin' me all this now?
cause you weren't here earlier.
I got a phone.
I mean, come on, Mick.
I'm your partner, I shouldn't be the last one to know.
you're right. And I'm sorry, James.
okay.
see? Now I feel better.
we're not gonna hug.
Aw, hell no.
so, do you ride horses?
I hate horses.
not talking about ponies.
talking about full-growns.
Full-growns?
what the hell is a full-grown?
we are two blocks from my ex-girlfriend.
Teresa. She broke my heart.
Hey, do you know what's got a lot of protein?
walnuts. Do you like walnuts?
can you shut up?
I'm just trying to get to know you, that's all.
wanna know about me?
I don't like people who talk too much.
Oh, me neither. What else?
I like craps, not blackjack.
white frosting, not chocolate.
dogs, not cats.
length, not girth.
I like men, not boys.
clapton, not Page.
Clapton? Not Page?
you out of your mind?
did you even listen to my mix?
I like football, not baseball.
tequila, not vodka.
and I always thought it'd be cool to be an astronaut.
are you satisfied?
now shut up.
transmitting now.
got it.
you were right-- delivery guy, explosives.
okay, let's go.
come on, let's go.
check.
check.
good, keep it coming, straight.
that's it, old man.
keep it coming, grandpa.
five feet.
stop!
nice, did you steal this?
no, I won it in Bingo.
just get to work, stupid.
I got it, I got it.
I don't got it, I don't got it.
this ain't gonna work, it needs to be quick.
I got an idea.
how that's gonna help?
titanium.
stronger than steel, light as a feather.
you just bought this.
these are the two banks that fit our profile.
I want extra units in both areas.
and I want SWAT no more than five minutes out.
even if we do find the right bank, how do we make sure that our pizza guy-- keeps his toppings?
we contain and follow.
evans, I want you to be liaison between the divisions on this.
you got it.
come on, big boy.
Hey.
Hey!
everybody, this is a robbery.
do what I say, or everybody dies.
Yeah, no, we're on it.
detective.
a guy wrapped in explosives just walked into Bank National downtown.
all units, robbery in progress. Bank National. Bomb squad dispatched.
yeah?
it's going down.
time to grab some cash.
Ricky, we're moving.
Umf--so, am I.
where have you been?
Oh, no. Oh, no.
you got a walkie? Thanks.
what did you do?
look what you've done.
cedars-sinai Hospital. Hurry please, my father's sick.
off duty, get out.
it's my heart.
get out!
he's on his last leg, move!
get out, now.
get out-- -Get to the back of the cab.
all the way to the back.
open it.
now get in there. - Ooy.
Lola is so hot.
good to go.
Hi-yun-ken.
flag your cab, Mickey.
keep banging, and I'm going to set you on fire.
drive around the block again.
Oh, God. Get out of the way!
get out of the way!
subject exiting opening one.
sharpshooters, hold your fire.
please don't shoot. I'm supposed to get in a cab.
do not approach, do not shoot.
go, Pops, go.
here comes our boy.
don't shoot.
I'm supposed to get in a cab, please.
let that cab in.
let the taxi through.
air support, keep a visual on the yellow taxicab in front of the bank.
Roger that.
come on, come on, let's roll.
Hi, I'm Ricky-- I mean, Eduardo. How are you?
Oh, I'm going to have that bomb off you in no time, okay?
pops, uh, I mean, Ricardo?
I don't--I don't know if it's the red or the blue.
it's the blue, it's always the blue.
well, last time it was the red.
blue damn it, blue.
I'm going red.
I said blue, damn it, blue.
you want to kill the kid?
Ooh!
the kid lost his load.
I'm sorry, man, I always wanted to do that.
you must be real excited to be riding in the front of the squad car for a change, huh?
you know, just-- just keep it.
you know I can actually hear you getting fatter.
suspect is stopped. Everyone stay behind.
all right, here we go.
10, 000 for you, old man.
now, give me your driver's license.
come on, come on.
it's a terrible picture.
now, I saved your life, so keep your mouth shut.
and, uh, we know where you live.
okay? Buh-bye.
don't worry, kid. This'll be over soon.
clear.
okay, here we go.
all cars stay in close behind us.
do not give them a reason to detonate.
get back behind.
back behind.
they won't blow up the money.
but they'd have to be able to see.
I have seven reports from the Cal Financial Bank robbery.
seven reports, eight units.
can you find that missing report?
they're in one of our cars.
22-5 on 3, 22-5 on 3.
Why's she want us to switch to secure channel three?
I don't know, power trip?
18 Denny 1 on 3.
we have suspects in one of our units.
repeat, we have suspects in one of our units.
air patrol, keep a visual on the cab.
everybody else, on my count, slam on your brakes. Ready?
three...
two...
one...
now.
taxi turning, proceeding southwest on Olympic.
let's go, get 'em up!
you, you, follow the cab.
Yes, ma'am.
get out of the car, show your hands, nice and easy.
get 'em up. Get 'em up.
O'brien, over here.
get out, get out of the car.
Where's the detonator?
let's go, let's go, let's go.
the detonator, find the detonator. -Here it is.
get 'em up, get 'em up.
got it. Secure.
good.
pull over in front of the big rig.
there you go, keep the change.
detonator has been found, stop taxi and apprehend suspects immediately
driver, stop the engine and step out of the vehicle.
get those hands on top of your head.
step back, step back.
on your knees.
clear.
check the trunk.
clear.
detective Sykes, it's not the right cab.
I repeat, it's not the right cab.
what do you mean it's not the right cab?
there's no money, no kid, no bomb.
well, then. Shall we begin?
you're unpredictable, Mal.
you run when you ought to fight.
fight when you ought to deal.
makes a business person a little twitchy.
Miranda.
Hey! A tussle!
Jayne.
do you know that girl?
I really don't.
Gorrammit, girl, it's me!
may I see her?
I believe you've got some storytelling to do.
what in the hell happened back there?
start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a 90-pound girl.
cause I don't think that's ever getting old.
do we know if anyone was killed? It's likely.
I know she meant to kill me before the Doc put her out.
which, how exactly does that work anyhow?
it's a safe word.
the people who helped me break River out...
had intel that River and the other subjects were being...
embedded with behavioral conditioning.
they taught me a safe word...
in case something happened. Not sure I get it.
it's a phrase that makes her fall asleep.
if I speak the words-- Don't say it!
it only works on her, Jayne.
well, now I know that.
ln case something happened.
you feel to elaborate on what that something might be?
they never said what-- And you never did ask.
get your hands off
eight months. Eight months, you had her on my boat...
knowing full well she could go monkeyshit...
at the wrong word. You never said a thing.
I brought her out here so they couldn't get to her.
I don't even know what they-- My ship!
my crew!
you had a Gorramn time bomb living with us!
who we gonna find in there when she wakes up?
the girl?
or the weapon?
I thought she was getting better.
and I thought they was getting off!
didn't we have an intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore?
we couldn't leave them now. No, now that...
she's a killer woman we ought be bringing her tea and dumplings.
in earnest, Mal, why'd you bring her back on?
may I see her?
she goes woolly again, we're gonna have to put a bullet to her.
it's crossed my mind.
can I make a suggestion that doesn't involve violence...
or is this the wrong crowd? Honey.
we're flying a lot blinder than usual here.
we need to get our bearings.
I think we need to talk to Mr. Universe.
Oh, this is good.
you guys always bring me the very best violence.
you think you're in a hot place?
that's what we're looking to learn. Is there any follow up, a newswave?
there is no news. There's the truth of the signal.
what I see. And, there's the puppet theater...
the Parliament jesters foist on the somnambulant public.
well, what about this? Did this make the puppet theater?
no, sir. And no lawforce flags, either.
I had to go into the security feed direct.
you can do that? Can't stop the signal, Mal.
everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.
security feeds are a traipse to access...
and I wasn't the first one in.
this has prints on it. So somebody else has been fed this.
Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling in love with me.
you're just gonna embarrass yourself.
I have a commitment to my Lovebot.
it was a very beautiful ceremony. Lenore wrote her own vows...
I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.
and she falls asleep. Which, she would be sleepy.
can you go back?
see if anybody spoke with her before she acted up.
made any kind of contact with her.
Miranda. "Miranda"?
go back further.
no.
please.
Mal, you're very smart.
someone is talking to her. The oaty bar?
subliminal.
it's a subliminal message, broadwaved to trigger her.
I've been seeing this code pop up all over, the last few weeks.
it's Alliance and it's high military.
they have gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend.
and found her, they have.
do you all know what it is you're carrying?
they're afraid of me.
I'm sorry. They should be.
but I'll show them. Oh, God.
it's okay. Hey, it's okay.
show me off like a dog.
old men covered in blood.
it never touched them, but they're drowning in it.
I don't know what I'm saying. I never know what I'm saying.
in the Maidenhead, you said something.
when you were triggered, do you remember?
the Captain saw you say something on the feed.
Miranda.
Miranda.
ask her.
who is Miranda?
am I talking to Miranda now?
no.
not right.
but I think when they triggered you...
it somehow brought this up.
this memory. It isn't mine.
the memory, it isn't mine.
and I shouldn't have to carry it. It isn't mine.
don't make me sleep again. I won't.
I won't.
put a bullet to me.
bullet in the brainpan, squish.
don't say that. Not ever.
we'll get through this.
things are going to get much, much worse.
thanks for taking us in again, Shepherd.
you got a plan?
hiding ain't a plan?
it'll do you for a spell.
and the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin.
but the Alliance will be coming.
they're after this girl with a powerful will.
I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment.
you won't.
this isn't a palms-up military run, Mal.
no reports broadwaved...
no warrants.
much as they want her, they want her hid.
that means closed file.
means an operative.
which is trouble you've not known.
I could have left her there.
I had an out.
hell, I had every reason in the 'verse...
to leave her lay and haul anchor.
it's not your way, Mal.
I have a way?
that better than a plan?
only one thing is gonna walk you through this, Mal.
belief.
you know I always look to you for counsel...
but sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd.
I ain't looking for help from on high.
that's a long wait for a train don't come.
when I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?
they'll come at you sideways.
it's how they think. It's how they move.
sidle up and smile. Hit you where you're weak.
sort of man they're like to send believes hard.
kills and never asks why.
it's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world.
I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal.
have to tell me about that sometime.
no, I don't.
river?
river, you look tired.
I think everybody's a little tired by now. Why don't we all lie down.
a little peace and quiet will make everything better.
river. Do as you're told. No.
it's going to be fine. Lie down. No.
cut them down.
what? Mal! You up?
I got a wave. I'm gonna bounce it down to you.
Inara.
I... Is this a bad time?
no, this...
good as any.
how's your world? Cold. It's autumn here.
still at the Training House?
so, what occasions the wave? Not that to see you ain't...
well, you look very fine. Oh. Thank you.
so, what was the...
I guess we're having something of a problem here with the locals.
and, I thought maybe-- You could use a gun hand?
I'm hoping not. But if you happen to be close at all, you...
the crew could take your ease here for a while. And there'd be payment.
well, it would be... I mean, I'd like to.
Kaylee's been missing you something fierce.
Oh, man. I miss her, too.
I even miss my shuttle, occasionally.
Yeah, you left, um...
got some of your stuff in a trunk.
