Sheldon adelson, a casino tycoon, is expected soon to choose between madrid and barcelona for a 16 billion ($ 21 billion) gambling resort.
Sheldon adelson, chairman of casino operator las vegas sands, was forced to halt his$ 12 billion plan to build an asian version of the las vegas strip on a stretch of reclaimed land called cotai due to financing woes.
Sheldon adelson, sands's chief executive, believes that asia can easily accommodate "five to ten las vegases."
Sheldon adelson, sands's longtime chairman, ceo and biggest shareholder, and other current top company executives don't appear to have been directly involved in those deals, people familiar with the matter said.
Sheldon adelson, the boss of las vegas sands, is also convinced that asia is still far from saturated with casinos, even after singapore's two openings-he thinks it could still have room for the equivalent of five las vegases.
Sheldon adelson, the las vegas casino mogul, yesterday warned stanley ho and other gaming operators in macao that competition in the world's second largest casino market has only just begun and would intensify.
