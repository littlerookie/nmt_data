to your left.
we know you have another job today.
we need to know the details.
let's go. There you go.
and I said I'd take you, - no, really, it's fine.
do you have any metal in your pockets?
Kitt, we need to stop the s. u.v. without wrecking it.
to protect you from gunfire,
the physicist's last known location
what is their function?
Kitt, where are Mike and Sarah?
I really hate these things.
to drop the item on time,
the helicopter's trajectory
you with the briefcase,
the assailants gave you.
there is no try.
Mike! oh!
why are you wearing your dress?
the lenses are a tracking system.
you have approximately three hours
attention, all units.
and approach with caution.
now stop!
we'll meet, and we'll give you the antidote.
to an epileptic seizure.
Thanks.
into the assassin's bank account.
you hear me?
on the task at hand, Michael.
Kitt.
I should've told Torres to shove this mission.
your display of affection is appreciated,
I wanted to feel like we still had normal lives.
but a combination of toxins
we're not dealing with one poison,
I was hungover.
to pinpoint its gps signal.
all owned by Walton Axe.
stay on him.
you're the best soldier I've ever known.
we can take care of that right here.
occupant restraint system active.
and almost certainly destroy any antidote on board.
Where's Dr. Draiman? - d. c.
I have something that may help.
what do you mean attempt at humor?
motivation.
is it just me, or does going to tech for tomorrow
with porcelain bullets.
and this purse is a part of my mission.
I'd say he's handling it pretty well.
can the poisoned guy get a break here?
I have been instructed to inform you
Kitt, please tell me that's you.
which means we need both "a" and "b" antigens
truth serum is fun.
not happening.
I vote bad idea.
probably never planned on showing up.
of you transforming on youtube.
Mike! - Yeah?
is pissing me off.
and so, everybody, thanks so much for coming.
we have a situation.
which way is southwest?
commencing reverse motion.
so Michael knight isn't identified as the shooter.
Kitt, I can handle it.
along with a laptop, which Kitt's examining.
it should buy you some time.
may I suggest you get moving, - And what's that? - Trust.
I have traced the funds deposited
well, if a dance is what you want,
he's a closer. That's what he does.
short selling is when an investor hopes to gain
pick up the item, identify its contents, drop it off.
Michael, are you awake?
find out who's shorting the shares.
Yeah, I know.
my sensors indicate other vehicles
or I'll remove all of your spark plugs.
could you speak into the microphone, please?
you will not be attending the wedding,
we have just received a confirmed report
I can extract the antigens.
it will be morning soon.
the assassination's not gonna be the hard part,
it is a modified 50 caliber machine gun
five bucks we're screwed.
me too.
we're dead in the water.
would've been nice to have that dance, though.
but believe me, rest assured,
hangar door open.
of their nuclear-weapons program
one minute, 38 seconds.
it's just my belt buckle.
Kitt, music, please.
I assume that you hired me
copy that. Peep me posted.
Oh, let's hope not.
get on the ground!
read this.
I'd have worn a less expensive shirt.
drop your weapons! Get on the ground!
initiate beer-run program.
his profile fits that of the man
I really didn't take advantage of that
you, me, this dress,
which has to be a little upsetting in itself.
stay with the item. I'm on the courier.
getting poisoned with a neurotoxin
don't talk to me, criminal.
didn't know you were so concerned with your tan.
we linked up with Kitt. It's being analyzed as we speak.
use the mask from the exchange
Yeah, and I got stuck cleaning it up.
they must be with another agency.
Kitt, fire the grappling hook!
he dies, you killed a government operative.
it's not a he, it's a she,
please be advised
may be identified as the shooter.
Richards' death would cause the stock to plummet,
you don't talk like that in front of girls, do you?
and informed them of our imminent return.
please hurry, Sarah
an offshore company that has been short selling
Mike?
these things are a one-way ticket
Ooh, I love this part.
Oh, no way!
so you can track the case.
to complete the mixture.
are you quoting movie lines now?
into the assassin's bank account.
he is married, with five children.
I have Axe's phone signal.
now, Sarah.
we will take down the bad guys and retrieve your antidote.
help is coming. Just hang in there.
Mike, I'll be with you in a few minutes.
looks like mama's about to get paid.
I hate contact lenses.
Kitt, how close are you?
in your current condition, it is not wise
I think the adrenaline's helping.
to reach you.
you won't talk, so I'm gonna extract the information
you throw realism out the window,
based on your initial blood sample,
it was fun while it lasted.
large chunks of innovative stock.
probably.
by the fbi and s. e.c.
it's Torres.
relax, man, I got this.
stop right there, on the ground now.
working for a highly classified organization,
may be the only way we're gonna get a day off.
Oh, my god, that's a rush!
just be careful. The last thing we need is camera-phone footage
right now, actually.
occupant restraint system activated.
plot to intercept.
to belief in a higher power.
get up.
the pickup is scheduled to take place in 34 minutes
looks like a coat-check ticket.
how's it going?
what are you doing?
Mike.
he is currently under investigation
the only component absent from your mixture
the door will open straight out.
leave it exactly as you found it.
we need to keep them on the ground. Use your e. m.p.
no, she meant you have to think positively.
what did you just do?
the quick brown fox
good luck, Mike.
I'm attempting to keep you focused
still, you did say a few interesting things.
the recipient may be unable to avoid a collision.
that they are completely indisposed
that you are well on the way to recovery.
so, you know, you won't actually have to kill anybody.
Mike!
you need to bring in the recipient for questioning.
if there is one. - I've hidden a homing beacon inside
you know, if I'd known you were gonna use so much fake blood,
you think maybe it's encoded or fixed with a gps?
because someone told you I was the best.
I can engineer paint pellets for the gun,
go help him.
but if you're nervous about my loyalties,
Yes, if you give me a blood sample,
guys, we got company.
I'm sorry. This thing is specially made.
get up.
Oh, that's right. He didn't tell me.
that I wanted to see Linds get married.
to engage in a physical confrontation.
I need the sun's rejuvenating rays.
putting it on-screen now.
when it is, you'll be hearing a lot about it.
has it landing on the parking structure's roof.
such as?
and with me, you get what you pay for.
Oh, god.
delivered weapons to african rebels.
no. no, I do not.
it's all over the news.
and, uh, I know you didn't want to go by yourself,
I am currently hacking multiple satellites
don't do that.
find out who they were.
I've contacted the ssc
or this time I won't tell Kitt to strap you in.
the countdown to my death...
an iranian physicist with intimate knowledge - I just saved your life. - I had that.
your reaction time has improved.
Yes, Michael, it is I.
with the mask, there won't be a shooting at all.
okay, turn back around.
I just-- I want you to know...
all right, let me out of here.
two officers will emerge from around the corner
Hello, Sarah. Michael's settings are active.
are rapidly approaching.
you need to find these men, Mike.
Kitt, do you have Mike?
it would be better to wait to assassinate richards
he'll have nowhere to go.
what else?
item is mobile.
you guys are worrying about the wrong thing.
you'll know as soon as I do, Kitt.
will Sarah not be upset?
you must obtain a photo i. d. of the recipient.
we'll be sure to charge her with that too.
and she took my picture before I could take hers.
we cannot sustain another hit. - Mike!
you have a lovely hat.
sounds good to me. You almost finished?
did you erase the security-camera footage?
in under three minutes.
I'm moving in. We can't lose them both.
it's Darian Richards.
from the expected decline in the price of a stock.
Why's that? - She's dead.
I can't wait any longer.
by stopping, you are allowing the authorities
suspect spotted two blocks west of the convention center.
if the wedding isn't for another five hours,
making the owner of the shorted shares
she was wearing her dress for motivation?
they are standing by to initiate duplication.
got it.
Oh, man, she is gonna be - oh, yeah.
slowly.
relax, man, I got this.
Kitt, auto restraints. Hit it.
how long till I die?
I have confirmed the item's location.
do not have much time to revive him
launch prep activated.
without the mask, Michael Knight
billionaire scientist and the genius
he almost got the drop on you.
Kitt will help you sync it up. - Cool.
not make more sense?
at the tech for tomorrow symposium.
but I wouldn't squirm if I were you...
what do we have?
Yes. Would you say one more sentence, please?
don't lose him. Detain him now if you have to.
I do not have spark plugs. - Kitt.
what the ssc doesn't know won't hurt them.
considering the circumstances,
will you have enough time to fully prepare?
Kitt, get me Carrie.
once Kitt gets a fix, I'll have him relay it to you.
using the laptop, I can trace that deposit,
well, I'm not dead or arrested, if that's what you mean.
as founder and ceo of innovative,
uh, mike pulled this gun out of the wreckage,
get this done so you can take her to that wedding.
could you look into the camera, please?
Kitt, get me Sarah.
emigrated to the U.S. late last night.
did you know that Billy calls you the Asian sensation
to that helicopter, I'm dead.
you're late. We're on a strict timeline.
until your central nervous system shuts down.
maybe, but it's still the truth.
document everything.
smuggled Ali Atwa out of Afghanistan,
we have a line on our guy.
that won't be necessary.
firing grappling hook.
good job, Kitt.
directly from your frontal and temporal lobes.
Uh-oh, he made me. He's trying to evade.
how are you feeling? - Like I ate bad sushi.
it's already done. Hands behind your back.
has been shot to death while giving a speech
you coming or not?
Kitt, I need a time and location for the pickup.
preparing grappling hook.
Mike, welcome back.
I mean, fine -- it's going fine.
Kitt, I need this analyzed.
forbes lists him as the 34th wealthiest man
the bullets contain an explosive charge.
42 minutes, 12 seconds.
let me out of here, and I won't come after you.
don't worry. He'll still finish your mission.
you're all set to go.
in that case, I have escape routes plotted.
continue through the kitchen.
are you gonna tell my parents?
I got to go.
an infinite number of variables which could result in
according to deleted e-mails I have recovered
the quick brown...
it's getting out afterward that might get me killed.
you're so on.
and have a terrific afternoon.
no, and you wouldn't if it weren't for the hyoscine.
michael and Sarah are dancing on the beach.
to have open alcoholic-beverage containers on the beach.
recipient is a very reckless driver.
I'm a poisoned government operative
if they grab the courier or the item,
estimated travel time, taking into account travel,
that you calm yourself and complete this task.
Michael, my database contains no such program,
moving in to acquire photo i. d.
hold on. I'm dying because of what?
well, as I said, we do have a working prototype,
it is essentia to your survival
Michael, the subject appears to be moments away
this man couriered stolen nsa intelligence to North Korea,
FBI, give us some room.
Mmm, it tastes like cherries.
I am patching through agent Rivai.
you ever fantasize about Sarah in a catholic schoolgirl outfit?
I approached too quickly, was seen, got distracted, or should I continue to have faith?
I'm guessing he already knows.
besides, it doesn't start for another five hours.
maybe someday I'll tell you.
wow, don't sugarcoat it or anything.
my bio-sensing matrix indicates you are still fatigued
come on, Mike, wake up!
and 18 seconds at an industrial warehouse.
Mike!
Mike! oh, g
new mission files are being uploaded.
and leave it there.
I lost him.
pretend I skipped business school.
you have a package for me.
the gun is synthetic -- uh, plastic and rubber
not happening.
just do your job.
if he makes it
okay. Come on, we got to get you back to the ssc.
I have a visual on axe's signal.
I can barely do this without the mask.
wherever that door leads, there are no cameras.
I have calculated the estimated time
you should get poisoned more often.
I got it.
connected to the same company shorting innovative stock,
should probably take precedence over Lindsay Rickel's wedding.
Mike and Kitt killed an assassin without identifying a target
do not use the exit doors. Continue along this hallway.
Mike, proceed as planned.
Mike, I'm heading towards you now.
you are so beautiful.
you know, you're blocking my sun.
I am running a trace now.
of the road ahead is picking up an obstruction.
from our previous assignment.
Mike, honestly, it's okay.
I am having trouble processing something.
coupled with the v. i.p. pass, I'm guessing...
initiating launch prep.
Yeah, i. d. recipient -- got it.
if you want to throw them a bone.
my research into Darian Richards has discovered
most predominantly hyoscine,
okay.
so we will hope for the best.
they are setting a perimeter around the building.
I guess you know who else has a. b. negative blood.
hmm, clearly not working yet.
speaking of, I owe you an apology.
you tell him there's no antidote?
let's not waste any more.
Kitt, do you still have Axe?
it's a pass to tech for tomorrow.
better to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?
that's him. That's the guy who poisoned me.
you find an antidote?
my e. m.p. has been damaged and is not operational.
Kitt, if you don't know, I can't tell you.
is a wonderful thing,
Foreign-substance analysis complete.
Sarah, I am so sorry.
it is highly likely our weapons will do lethal damage
guess the truth serum wore off.
and as of this morning, he's gone missing.
once the target's death is confirmed,
great, more contact lenses.
our simple faith that you'll do the job we're paying you to do.
holy crap, that hurts.
Yes, I have also just finished analyzing
I swear to god, I will kill you right now.
funny, I was considering poisoning myself
he's our only link to tracking down the antidote.
and from there you will track and recover the physicist.
as your vital signs are destabilizing.
relay the signal to Carrie,
Oh, that smells like victory.
our paths will intersect in approximately four seconds.
police officers are approaching you from all sides.
$10 million will be deposited into her bank account.
Mike, be advised the mission may be compromised.
stand up a girl in a dress like that.
what is it? - This whole thing was a misdirect.
I am so not cleaning it up again.
I heard they gave you another assignment.
have I told you that recently?
you need a bio-sensing matrix to figure that out?
this is our chance to grab him.
Yes, all evidence of you has been deleted.
retinal scan commencing.
we will intercept Walton Axe's cell phone signal
and his contact's code name is the lamb.
I am repositioning Zoe and agent Rivai.
his vitals are stable, but will not remain so for long.
Oh, I know he will, Sarah. That's why we chose him.
I'll start on an antidote.
uh, no, I think it's a coat-check ticket.
just that you hope for the best.
Yes, Michael's earlier blood samples showed him to have
what about the grappling hook?
may I discard my disguise as well?
come to think of it, try not to move at all.
we must leave in exactly four minutes and 32 seconds.
retinal scan approved.
the next logical step is to assassinate the target.
you're really going through with this?
which acts as a hallucinogen and truth serum.
does not get old.
Yes, he is continuing on the same general course. Mike,
he's on the move, right on schedule.
that is five milliliters of "a" and "b" antigens.
Darian Richards is the visionary founder
then I guess I am.
it is a perfect match.
careful. Last time you just about burned the guy's eyes out.
that's okay. I like it out here.
which means that we can't do much to help you, Mike.
Michael, do you have a target yet?
do I strike you as a man who leaves loose ends?
Mike, hang in there. I'll see you soon.
I can't handle much more of this.
I have located the frequency, patching it through now.
if you like, I could display the files inside the car.
there's a downside to your particular service.
stay down, Mr. Richards. You're gonna be just fine.
Michael, I have Alex Torres for you.
and ceo of innovative technologies.
take what you have and go help him.
Michael, what did Sarah mean when she said
the s. u.v. is ballistic plated has run-flat tires,
loose ball! Picked up by -...
the ssc has requested we review your cover identity together.
they got you babysitting now?
you know you don't have to do everything you're told.
the ssc has requested we review your cover - okay, okay.
cover's jack miller.
newbury, kansas. Marine corps, special forces.
I assaulted my C. O.Skipped my court martial, currently listed as awol.
happy? - I have a question, michael.
why would a soldier assault his own commanding officer?
war can make a man do all kinds of things he can't explain.
kind of like women. - Don't listen to him, kit.
he may know war, but what he thinks he knows about women is far more dangerous.
Kitt, run the algorithm on the new transform system. Let's make sure it's clear.
commencing algorithmic preview.
got to say, the whole brainiac, gear-head thing --very hot.
shouldn't you be getting your game face on or something?
who says I'm not?
what are you doing this weekend?
nothing. None of your business.
nothing.
for your birthday?
just stay home alone and watch tv.
the alone part sounds really nice.
when I get back, I'm taking you out and getting you drunk.
we're celebrating. That's a promise.
that sounds like a dream date. I will count the hours.
whoa there, speed racer.
what happened to your face?
Oh, I was playing basketball and caught an elbow.
caught an elbow. Looks more like three or four elbows and a knee.
it's not that bad, okay.
Really? You look like something that should have stayed in vegas.
I got into an argument with some idiot over cracks for war craft.
and I took a beat down, okay? There.
are we all in the loop now? Awesome.
his name is walt cooperton.
he runs a private military organization.
was into a lot of nasty business in iraq.
that kind of stuff doesn't make the evening news.
mercenaries. Six months ago, D.O. D.Terminated his contract at the request of the state department.
must've been pretty messy, since state's not releasing any of the details.
now he's operating a compound outside of phoenix.
training a private militia-- hard-core extremists, constitutionalists, a real fun crowd.
legally, we can't touch him.
the compound's privately owned.
claims he's just training for company missions overseas.
but you don't believe him.
take a look at this.
our own declaration of independence states that to secure our rights, governments are instituted amongst men.
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
when the government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to abolish it.
I say beyond that, it is their sacred duty.
it looks like someone found religion.
a little more than that.
two weeks ago, he purchased state-of-the-art remote triggering devices.
we're talking military grade, for multi-megaton ballistic weaponry.
guy's definitely got an attitude problem.
we need you to infiltrate cooperton's group and find out what he's planning on doing with all his new toys.
and disable all their operational capability.
there goes the weekend.
one more thing, michael. There must be no communication with me or the ssc.
if you are wearing the earwig, it will be detected.
anything else?
maybe I should do the whole mission blindfolded or one arm tied behind my back.
doing it with one arm was mentioned in the dossier.
wait, was that a joke?
did you just make a joke, kitt?
prepare for transformation.
transformation complete.
Mike's out there taking on the world, I can't even take on one gamer geek.
so do something about it.
grow a pair and learn how to fight.
who's going to teach me?
you?
rec room, tonight.
and don't make me come looking for you.
Zoe, go easy on him.
easy is not my speed.
his name is oren moss.
he was affiliated with a militia group in utah before he became cooperton's lieutenant.
that's the idiot I need to talk to.
Michael, my sensors indicate that these men are armed.
it would not be wise to approach them without a means of defending yourself.
one thing about soldiers, kitt, they are eyes forward predators.
you can lure them anywhere if they think you're prey.
Oh, man, these are good.
you weren't planning on eating thes were you?
you're going to get hurt, cowboy.
I'm not a cowboy.
I'm a marine.
name is jack miller. I'm looking for walt cooperton.
don't know him.
if I were at liberty to do so, me and my boys here would turn you into a puddle.
but I'm not at liberty.
if you've got a brain in your head, you'll get your dumb ass back in that truck and drive.
well, kitt, let's get us some hummer.
Michael, I heard moss threaten to turn you into a puddle.
while that is physically impossible, it was rather direct.
perhaps another approach would be prudent.
no, this is the fun part.
this is where the hunt begins.
take it easy, mike. These guys know this back country inside and out.
everyone relax. I know what I'm doing.
we are completely surrounded.
shall I initiate defensive protocols?
no.
they got me right where I want them.
Mike, what the hell's going on? - Shut down all communications.
Mike, wait!
I'm in.
you have pretty nice form.
except you keep dropping your lead hand.
someone's going to get you good if you're not careful.
let's try this again.
what are you doing here?
you know... I bet when you smile, you really light up a room.
get 'em!
Michael's endorphin and adrenaline levels are excessively elevated.
indicating the probability of internal injuries.
shall I intervene?
this is what mike is trained for.
we can't compromise the mission.
you're going to have to take a breath sooner or later.
and when you do, your lungs will fill with water and you're going to drown.
okay, okay, I'll talk.
please.
the reason I'm here is...
I forgot. Damn...I lost it.
I swear. It was right there on the tip of my tongue.
Hey, I'm kind of thirsty, do you think I could get some water?
all right, that's enough.
well.
I see you've met my girl.
Yeah, she's a real delicate flower.
let's talk.
you have a navy cross, bronze star, purple heart, three times.
never afraid to take one for the team.
you were with O. E.F. At mazari sharif?
Yeah, I was part of the drop team that took the compound.
what kind of support did you have?
Fa-18 hornets, daisy cutters, ac-130s.
they tore them up for us pretty good.
you must have joint opp'd with the 337th.
those are some hard-charging humps.
I read that.
I guess I'd know for sure if I was in south korea.
337th never rotated in theatre. Don't screw with me, sir.
I danced at your welcome party, and I'm not complaining, but if you don't want me here, just say the word.
this country was founded on a healthy distrust of authority.
live free or die, that is america.
now some 230 years later, we've traded a british despot for a new breed of tyranny.
the federal government, it will not stand, not as long as there is breath in my lungs.
you'll find I'm like-minded in that, sir.
good.
get yourself cleaned up. We chow in an hour.
Kitt, can you hear me?
good to hear your voice again, michael.
I'm going to scope things out tonight, see what I can find. You're going to have to be my eyes.
we will have a satellite overhead.
don't worry, I've got your six.
that is the correct usage of the expression, is it not?
I got your back, you got mine. That's how we roll.
talking to yourself in the can?
what are you? Some kind of P. T.S. D.Whack-job?
maybe I am.
or maybe you're just hearing the voices again.
you like hurting people, don't you, sweetheart?
Why? You want to get hurt?
you and i have unfinished business.
my hands aren't tied now. Might make it a little more interesting.
Oh, you do like it rough, don't you?
that's what I thought.
do you think she believes that? - We'll find out.
I said punch me, not feel me up.
all right, geez.
no wonder you got your butt kicked, billy. Are you even sure you've got a y-chromosome?
let's check under the hood. - Back off.
little aggression, nice.
that's what I'm talking about. So come on. Now hit me.
I'm not going to hit a girl.
Oh, really?
I'm not saying you're going to hit me.
I'm saying take your best shot...bitch.
rule one, if you're going to make the first move, make it count.
you see an opening, you take it...hard.
let's do it again.
okay, you ready? - I am ready, michael.
okay, kitt, talk to me. - michael, be careful.
there is a guard approaching from behind your cover.
you are clear to proceed.
okay, kitt, what's next?
cooperton's tent is to your 12 o'clock.
base to unit 3, what's your 20?
unit 3, copy.
area 4, it's all clear.
copy that. Deploy along the south fence to the perimeter.
Roger that.
Sarah, are you out there?
I've got you.
Kitt, I'm uploading an application that should penetrate cooperton's firewall.
let me know when you're in.
stupid.
I have access, sarah.
okay.
now it's a party.
Kitt, we're looking for any documents that might clue us in on what this guy's been up to.
also going to need schematics of the compound.
if he's hiding a weapon, we need to find it.
building up schematics, searching for weapons...
Chateau margaux '86.
something's not right here, sarah.
are you kidding? That is an epic bottle of wine.
the guy's got a diamond rolly, a closet full of $6, 000 suits, and come on.
maybe if the wine were californian, I'd believe it.
but no self-respecting far right freak is going to drink french wine.
Yeah, what a waste.
Kitt... search cooperton's computer for personnel files.
run backgrounds on everyone.
they'll have aliases and assumed identities, so you'll have to go deep.
go deepest on cooperton himself.
I want to know everything about him since the day he was born.
I will get right on it. But I think I have found something.
there is a large structure at the south east perimeter.
and I am picking up traces of explosives. - Let's check it out.
there's nothing here, kitt.
I am still picking up traces of explosives.
whatever they have must be large-scale to leave such a strong chemical fingerprint.
tap into the compound's video security files. If they moved it, we need to know where.
Michael, you need to leave at once.
someone is approaching... fast.
told you about dropping that lead hand.
who are you? Really?
Jack miller, 232nd, zulu.
give it a rest, jack.
who sent you, N.S. A?F. B.I?
my name's cassandra banks.
mi-6. We've been tracking cooperton for over a year.
what, like licensed to kill, double-o status?
in her majesty's secret service--that mi-6?
what am I supposed to call you, jane bond?
sure, if I can call you G. I.-Jackass.
if you're mi-6, how come my people don't know you're here?
am I supposed to ring them up and wait for someone like you to stumble in a few days before our target is about to attack?
he's going in the next few days? - Best guess.
cooperton has acquired a massive conventional weapon-- modified, smaller scaled moab.
it's quite the little prize.
what's he planning on doing with it? - It's a demolitions bomb.
I would venture he's planning to knock something down.
and brilliantly deduced. The target?
I don't know.
are you going to lower your weapon?
are you?
go.
take her alive if you can.
you've got a nice accent there, honeY. But still, how do I know you're not setting me up?
I haven't opened fire yet.
that only tells me that you want to live. It doesn't tell me whose side you're on.
look... about six months ago, I thought cooperton was on to me.
so I scuttled my communications.
I've been in the dark since.
so if you're who you say you are, I'm rather glad you're here.
Michael, there are several armed guards approaching.
I've located a side exit. It's directly to your left.
I will meet you there in ten seconds.
got it, make it a party for two.
you have someone else on the inside?
it's a little hard to explain, come on.
who's bloody driving? - Just get in.
- occupant restraint system active.
Kitt? You're talking to your truck?
it is a pleasure to meet you, cassandra.
and he's talking to me?
let's see bond's car do that.
let's go!
Michael, my sensors indicate the road ahead is heavily mined.
please secure yourselves, I am initiating evasive maneuvers.
transformation will improve my mobility.
Kitt, transform now!
you all right? - I think so.
Kitt, are you all right?
I've hit a mine in mid-transformation, compromising multiple systems.
can you get us out of this ditch? - my systems are not responding.
I am unable to access my diagnostic protocols to fully assess damage.
I take that as a "no.
Michael, you will be captured if you do not leave now.
Sarah...kitt's down.
we're on it, mike. Get yourself out of there.
no, I'm not leaving him.
Michael, go now.
find them.
shoot them on sight.
what's your status? Tell me what I'm working with.
the blast must have breached a vulnerability in my undercarriage, during transformation.
I'm going to attempt accessing diagnostics by shutting down and re-booting with my secondary mainframe.
okay, you got any intel for me before you go night-night?
your opponent has superior numbers and an advanced knowledge of the terrain.
okay, tell me something I don't know.
the amount of knowledge that you don't know would take multiple lifetimes to ... - kitt, I need options.
as I am unable to assist you directly, your best option is to move south, towards the river.
how far south? - How do you feel about rio?
- initiating shut down.
you, that way. Go, go, go, go.
okay, michael, we're flying blind here.
temporary, just until kitt is back online.
Okay...We made it to the river, and I'm telling you this isn't going to work, you need to find us another route.
let me see what I can find.
Mike...I'm looking at your coordinates, there's just no other way.
I'm telling you, we can't make it down to the river.
the descent is too steep.
there is one way.
Oh, hell no.
you got to be kidding me, right?
Sarah, kitt's back up. - Oh, thank god. Kitt, I thought you said the river was our best option.
it is.
you have approximately a 30% chance of survival if you make it across the river.
compared with the near certainty of being shot if you do not.
always looking on the bright side.
he's right, mike. If you can get to the other side, I've coordinates to a clearinG.
if you can get there, we might be able to evacuate.
okay, just rewind a second. You're saying you want us to jump...
into the river?
you know...phobias are really just symptoms of a repressed painful experience.
the jump is a 67-foot fall into mountain run-off, 33 degrees, low bottoms, sharp rocks.
probability of injury, extreme.
that would be the painful experience I'm trying to repress, okay?
we need to back track and hike out of here
I guess we're getting wet.
current's taking them downstream.
I want that river forded and I want them found.
we've got two hours before we lose our window.
they're going to be cold, they're going to be tired.
let's finish it.
Kitt, mike's not responding on earwig. What's happening?
the earwig was damaged in the fall.
if michael and cassandra do not get warm, hypothermia will set in within the next seven minutes.
I'm attempting to re-establish contact now.
find him, kitt.
wait.
what's wrong?
my ankle.
how bad is it?
you should be getting on just fine.
in about two months.
get me the extra clip.
I'll buy you some time.
stiff upper lip and all that english ya-ya.
the crew that I ran with, we had a little saying.
leave no man behind." I'm not a man.
even better.
look, if we don't find shelter and get warm, we're both going to die.
so forgive me for being so forward, but I'm going to have to ask you to take off your clothes.
my communications are not fully functioning, but I did get a fix on michael's position.
my sensors indicate they are approaching stage two hypothermia.
if they are unable to raise their body temperature, they will diE.
can you get me a visual, kitt?
we'll have to divert power from the repair in order to up-link.
I just need to check on him.
diverting power now.
you know what I wish?
that we were in a hotel room in rio?
besides that.
I wish I could forget the things I've done.
we're not going to die.
you don't need to confess.
you know, it's funny.
I'd give anything to remember just to know what I've done.
then I'd probably want to forget.
Mike...I'm sorry I was so hard on you during the interrogation.
because I had to make it look good.
don't worry about it.
I've had worse first dates.
is this a date then?
Sarah, I have acquired the visual you requested.
main screen, please.
Sarah, I must tell you that - main screen now, kitt.
what is that?
shut off the imaging, kitt. Mike's just fine.
and you need the energy to finish your repairs.
call me when he's on the move.
Sarah, is that you? Are we back up?
Mike, what's going on? Where are you?
something's wrong.
cooperton's men, they were right on us.
and now they're just gone. Are we walking into a trap?
how close are you to the evacuation point?
just about there now.
I thought we were going to be evacuated.
we are. - In what?
this beat-up matchbox car?
Oh, come on, he's a mustang-- an american icon.
an icon? Really?
as far as I know, no one ever wrote a song about a bentley.
I think I know why you're not having any trouble from cooperton.
he's making his move.
the weapon's mobile.
I repeat, the target's hot.
how's kitt? - Still not 100%
how close is he to being ready? - He's functional.
he's just limited with his weapons and communications.
fine, I'll take what I got and do it old school.
old school?
I'll drive.
the target and four humvee vehicles are moving south down highway 17.
if we head west on route 212, we should be able to intercept.
how much time? - That depends. How fast can this thing go?
this thing?
are you kidding me?
prepare to scream like a little girl. Kitt, show her what you got.
Michael, my systems are slow to respond, but they are functioning.
scream like a what?
Kitt, what the hell?
you might want to
right on schedule, gentlemen. Keep it tight.
over there. Cooperton's humvees.
Michael, my search protocols are operational again.
I can begin those background checks you requested on cooperton's men.
good. I'm telling you, something's not right with these guys, kitt.
how are we doing on the target list?
we're putting it together now.
Michael, I believe your instincts are correct.
cooperton is not who he appears to be.
what do you got, kitt? - Cooperton and his lieutenant oren moss are international mercenaries both implicated in a major bank robbery in dubai.
moss escaped capture, and cooperton was never officially charged.
however, the incident did end his association with the D. O.D.
what are a couple of mercenary bank robbers doing with right-wing extremists?
it doesn't make any sense.
what the hell is going on now?
stay with the truck.
Oh, my god.
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Sarah, i think we've got our target.
Mike, we're with you. - Alert local police and fire.
we need support at the dam now.
Michael, my sensors indicate the truck does not have a driver.
it appears to be operated by remote control.
you'll have to override it.
do it now.
sit tight. - What? Mike? Mike!
I have done an analysis of the dam's structural design and calculated the optimum blast point.
the truck will reach optimum target location in 47 seconds.
Yeah, that's about right.
Kitt, you need to stop this truck.
commencing override protocol on the remote control.
Billy, I got three wires going to the detonator.
white, yellow, and blue.
need a little help here. - You can't be serious.
Billy, now! - This is serious.
okay, this doesn't make any sense. Black is usually the ground. That's the one you gotta cut.
is there a black line?
No! there's no black, come on.
Michael, optimal blast site in 15 seconds.
you're gonna have to go with your gut, man.
my guts are about to be all over the damn road, billy.
take a breath and tell me what to do.
how much time do I have?
less than ten seconds. - Oh, god.
white. Red. White. White. - Red. White. Red. White.
it's white. Go with white. - White.
I will stop the vehicle.
please hang on tightly, michael.
are you all right, michael?
Yeah. I guess I can take riding a one megaton bomb off my bucket list.
looks like they scrambled the entire phoenix police department.
Mike, we found this.
a gold shipment downtown is being moved to the federal reserve this afternoon, a value of over $250 million.
you wanna know what cooperton's doing with a bunch of extremists?
he's using them. - The bomb was a decoy.
it's a gold heist.
all right, gentlemen, let's do it.
if cooperton and moss are successful, they will have committed the biggest gold heist in U. S. History.
Thanks, kitt. No pressure or anything.
looks like the revolution's over.
well, you're wrong about that.
the revolution's just begun.
you really should stand down, son.
you're outgunned here.
funny, I was about to say the same thing about you.
Kitt, show 'em your dance moves.
what the hell is that?
that's my ride.
on my command!
you really shouldn't have done that.
clear! Police!
put your weapons down!
get on the ground now!
all right, all right. don't move, don't move!
let me see your hands.
on your knees!
on the ground! Clear!
don't you move!
hands on your head.
on your head!
I'm gonna have to get one of those.
drop me a line from the joint.
I'll send you a brochure.
how's the ankle?
it's going to need some attention.
you're one hell of an operative. I couldn't have done it without you.
somehow I doubt that.
guess you can put your cooperton file to bed, get home, back to yo life.
Yeah, it's been a while.
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come along.
you've been practicing.
I'm gonna go back out there and kick that guy's butt.
Yeah, you could do that.
or you could take me out for a drink.
Really?
you are just so cute.
Yes, you can buy me a drink.
all right. - Someday.
Sarah, are you staying in the pod tonight?
Yeah, I'm a little tired.
it's been a long few days.
I'll drive home in the morning.
I thought it was customary to mark the day of one's birth with celebration among family and friends.
Yeah, it's customary.
I'm just not into it.
happy birthday, sarah.
thank you, kitt.
Sarah, I think there is something you should hear.
I'd love to take this further, but - is there someone else?
it's complicated.
wow, that guy is hard to track.
Hey, sarah, I need you in the ssc.
Yeah, be right there.
lights.
happy birthday, sarah.
Oh, my god, I don't believe it.
thanks for saving my life...
again.
this is really wonderful.
I told you I was taking you out.
wanna go for a ride in my car?
you know, kitt, we're not supposed to joyride.
five bucks she takes him out.
not if she sleeps with him first.
wow can she be rated ex
is this a sparring match or a mating ritual?
both.
I'm afraid I don't understand the dynamics of the male-female relationship.
and you probably never will, Kitt.
come on, he wants to learn.
we should teach him.
see, this so-called sparring session is how they say
let's play a little "how's your father?"
without actually having to say it.
why not simply ask for sex?
cause it reeks of desperation.
he should know.
I did detect a rise in hormone levels when Mike and Sarah started hitting one another.
now you're starting to get it.
not bad.
maybe if you put a little more oomph into it.
like that?
is this another example of an indirect request for intimacy?
she's straddling him.
I'd say that's pretty direct.
Mr. Torres is approaching.
Kitt, screen off!
yeah?
briefing in ten minutes.
you're going out.
I need a shower.
me too.
me too. - Me too.
Billy, your hormone levels elevated with Zoe's when you hit on top of each other.
does that mean that you also want to play "how's your father?"
no.
this is all very perplexing.
can I borrow your shampoo?
look at my sexy man.
here we go.
I see answers.
Oh, boy.
now that's shock and awe, people.
you have everything on screen?
everything as of three minutes ago.
this is their last live screen.
I smell foreplay.
freshly showered foreplay.
what are we looking at?
Bonnie and Clyde.
you'll like these two, Mike.
they hacked into the treasury and transferred all senatorial and congressional salaries to Iraqi war widows through untraceable wire transfers.
not bad.
Oh, they're good.
real good.
they're anarchists.
and they're getting more brazen by the day.
they started with soft targets
and they're working their way up.
their website states that their primary objective
is to take down the military industrial complex of the united states.
of which we are a part.
if their online following keeps growing at its present rate,
they might actually be able to do it.
these guys are becoming a pop phenomenon.
top hit on all search engines.
what do they call themselves?
Nikki and Max for a free america.
you aren't serious.
unfortunately, I am.
wow, they're hot.
I think Sarah should come with me on this one.
I bet you do.
Yeah, I should go with Mike.
I don't think that's a good idea.
dad, I think a female perspective will be a valuable asset on this one.
she's absolutely right.
Kitt, have you figured out where they'll hit next?
I have factored in all known variables,
including, but not limited to online chatter, - Websites, blogs. - And?
and I have deducted the probable location of their next target.
the town of Hastings.
you're guessing, Kitt?
deduction, logic, and probability are not guessing.
a guess is a prediction about the outcome made without factual evidence or support.
I do not guess, Mike.
why didn't you tell him who Nikki is?
cause they don't need to know.
and the fbi doesn't want it public.
mark my words.
this is gonna blow up in our faces.
so?
so.
so we're alone.
let's talk.
come on.
it's not like we're ever really...Alone.
what, Kitt?
he's cool.
actually, my core temperature
is running a bit high due to the incline and low altitude.
what about Billy... Zoe, Torres?
your dad?
cause nobody has anything better to do than spy on Michael Knight all day.
I have nothing better to do.
me neither.
got all the time in the world.
we're on a mission.
I like to keep personal stuff and work stuff separate, that's all.
so why did you want me to come?
what, you didn't wanna come?
no, you said, "Sarah should come with me on this one."
cause I thought you wanted to come.
what about the whole female perspective thing?
what about the whole rec room, shower thing?
I just thought...
what?
Oh, I get it.
you're gonna play it like that.
like what?
I don't know.
Hey, guys.
there's lots of chatter on the web About Nikki and Max's next target,
and the number 15 keeps coming up.
an address, a date, a...Highway?
Kitt, analyze the number 15 and Hastings with respect to the previous targets of nikki and max.
I can provide no meaningfully relevant results using hastings and the number 15.
I'll stay on it.
you guys okay?
we're fine. - Yeah, we're okay. Why?
just checking.
no big.
outtie.
how long do you think?
I say he goes first.
I say you're misreading the whole dynamic.
he's all coiled up and hinky.
hinky?
Mike is loose as a goose.
a man with a plan, a dude in a mellow mood.
you rhyme like a white boy and not a beastie boy.
ten bucks he breaks before she does.
make it a double sawbuck.
you're on.
that could be anything.
there's gotta be some kind of pattern to it.
what?
nothing.
he folded like a cheap lawn chair.
no way!
it's completely innocent conversation.
he's practically drooling.
him?
Sarah can barely keep her hands off my boy.
are we watching the same movie?
we're doing this all for you.
that's right.
you can count on us. - Take charge.
take charge!
we are your answers.
these crazy kids.
sure, just two misguided teens in a hot car
blowing things up.
well, the hazardous waste facility that they destroyed was named in a class-action suit.
so you think they're doing the public a service?
no, come on.
country was born in violence and dissent.
it's always been with us.
well, I appreciate the homage to the founding fathers,
but anarchy is not the answer, Charles.
Yeah, well, one man's anarchist,
another man's robin hood.
they're dangerous and reckless.
period.
depends on your point of view.
I don't see how you can look at it any other way.
well, maybe to the untrained eye
we're the ones riding around in a hot car blowing things up.
all right, this is Max...
and Nikki...
we shall see you guys next time.
we love you.
ow, peace!
they're entering hastings.
I synchro'd the traffic signals on approach with Kitt's speed.
it should save them a couple of minutes.
awesomeness.
how did you hack the grid?
I repurposed that software firewall you invented
and slipped it in as a trojan horse to the traffic control computer in hastings.
great minds, right?
I'm uploading a list of motels to Kitt.
look, this one has a vibrating bed.
hope they brought quarters.
they should just get it over with, right?
Absolutely.
clears the head.
when I was playing planetary war craft last night,
I imagined you were queen Zorda of gorn.
queen Zorda?
the naked chick with the tentacles?
I, uh...
did you just go all Clarence Thomas on me?
no, the traffic cam
and the software firewall,
I thought we were having a moment.
I could so call human resources right now.
I'm--I'm sorry.
it was a-- it was a misunderstanding.
I'm going to ask you a question.
think very carefully before you answer.
okay.
what was I doing with my tentacles?
if this is our future, I'm really worried.
15 kilometers, 15 miles, 15 what?
maybe it's their 15th mission.
no, it's their 10th mission.
if you call terrorism a mission.
look.
military time. 1500 hours.
1899/12/31 0: 03: 00
it's a quarter to three now.
we only have 15 minutes to find the location.
there is no empirical evidence to support your supposition, Michael.
it's a hunch, Kitt.
if I'm wrong, at 3: 01, I'll apologize.
Kitt, display all possible targets again.
there are three military installations within a 30-mile radius.
too obvious, and too highly fortified.
there are no munitions plants,
no manufacturers of guidance systems,
and no ordnance suppliers.
there's a cop checking us out.
he is eying you suspiciously.
roll with it.
pay up.
smells like victory.
Pff...Buy yourself something nice.
I will.
Sarah, Michael, you may unlock your lips now.
the officer is leaving.
okay. We're good.
Yeah, good.
when I was in Iraq, sometimes we'd lose a huge truck over a tiny little fuel pump relay.
so?
so maybe there's a company here
that produces something small,
that could affect something big.
Kitt, research.
light manufacturing only.
part suppliers for vital industries, military, energy.
anderson valve, manufacturers of check valves
used in every major oil refinery in the united states.
destruction of Anderson's valve making capacity
will destruct the supply chain
and increase the price of gasoline.
how much?
I estimate approximately $10 per gallon.
where is it?
3. 2 miles from our current location.
anderson valve, let's go.
that's their car...
1970 super bee, 426 hemi, four barrel, four speed.
what a beaut.
only 21 were produced with the hemispherical head engine, and four-speed transmission.
you boys done? - Mm. Mm-mm.
Kitt, weapons.
each carries a 15 round magazine,
and i. D. Badges, compliments of dr. Graiman.
the cameras on your identity badges
are linked real time with the nsa's facial recognition database.
so we should be able to help you find Nikki and Max.
be careful.
Thanks, dad.
Kitt, open sesame.
how the hell are we supposed to find these guys?
process of elimination.
we'll alert you when facial recog finds someone who doesn't belong.
how much time?
just under two minutes.
Kitt, scan for valve making equipment.
seven different valves are produced in the building.
one minute remaining.
copy.
Kitt, you said "check valve" earlier.
Yes, Sarah.
scan only for one-way valves.
the only equipment capable of producing a one-way valve
is 30 yards to your one o'clock.
should thin the herd a bit.
Billy, my sensors have detected the presence of c-4.
Kitt sniffers detected c-4!
all right.
Sarah, there are explosives in that room.
Hi, hold on right there
Oh, boy.
Mike, get out of there.
it's too late, I'm going to try to disarm it.
Michael, throw the bag into the alley.
there's enough c-4 to take out half the building.
Michael, you cannot disarm it in time.
I have a plan.
Kitt! - I am fine, Michael.
you may want to assist Sarah.
Nikki and Max are getting away.
Freeze!
drop it.
you drop yours.
move it another inch, and you won't have any fingers left.
it's her. - Sarah, can you hear me?
Yeah, Carrie, I got 'em.
do not shoot.
Sarah, fire if you have to.
negative,
do not fire.
Nikki's congressman Childress' daughter.
bet they told you not to shoot me, didn't they?
they're idiots.
you should've shot her.
sorry.
you were always bad at operation when we were kids.
just good at playing doctor.
incoming call.
put it up, exterior mode.
Mike, are you okay?
why weren't we told who she was?
the information was considered "need to know."
Mmm, when it results in Sarah pulling buckshot from my arm,
I'd call it "need to know."
the congressman asked us to keep this quiet.
we felt obliged to honor his request.
mm, I can't believe you sent me after some spoiled brat
running around with a dude and a shotgun.
what's her problem?
daddy didn't buy her a pony when she was a little girl?
actually, I bought her two.
Max has her brainwashed.
congressman.
Max teach her how to shoot, too?
Mike, please.
you must be Michael Knight.
nice to finally meet you.
I'm afraid I'm to blame for my daughter's aim.
she's bagged her fair share of deer over the years.
good thing I don't have antlers.
Nicole is a sweet girl.
I may have overindulged her,
and her mother leaving wasn't easy,
but this is not her.
Yeah, she seems like a real angel.
that's my daughter Sarah.
she's a sweet girl too.
most of the time.
the girl was always strong-willed,
but this is something else.
she went to Berkeley to get an education.
four years later, I barely recognized the girl
I moved into the dormitory.
and you think Max was responsible?
he's a cancer.
he took my only child from me.
the situation seems to be similar to that of Patty Hearst.
creating a condition - we know what stockholm syndrome is, Kitt.
Mike will find her.
and bring her back safely.
I don't want my daughter hurt, Mr. Knight.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
I'll take care of it.
thank you, Michael.
charmer, isn't he?
he's a politician, charming is his business.
he's also been very supportive of my father's experiments for years.
you mean he's Knight industries' congressional sugar daddy.
Yep.
you buy it, the Patty Hearst thing?
not one bit.
she shot me with a smile on her face.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
where would you go if you were them?
an island in the south pacific.
nice.
I have an alternate hypothesis.
of course you do.
surveillance footage captured from Anderson valve included this.
I'm not sure what I'm looking at,
but it's definitely
not an island in the south pacific.
I apologize.
allow me to zoom.
and focus on the paper in his pocket.
Kitt, search for words or phrases
containing those letters in that order.
I've done that.
there are more than three million possibilities.
but there is also an image in the corner of the document.
can you tell what it is?
it's too obscured for my recognition software.
but it's quite possible the shape is a corporate logo.
so now cross-check those letters with the names of corporations.
which narrows the list down to 78 worldwide.
now sort only for the U.S.
it leaves six possibilities,
and only one of those has a military connection.
teeter plastics.
for many years, they were a small family-run operation.
but their business expanded rapidly
due to military contracts.
what do they make?
turbofan engines used on tomahawk missiles.
Where's their main base of operations?
it is a factory complex 134 miles from here.
that's their next target.
maybe we were wrong.
no, they'll show up eventually.
could be a couple hours.
any suggestions on how we could kill some time?
I have access to any number of games,
puzzles, movies, trivia.
he wasn't talking to you, Kitt.
spin the bottle.
what are you, 12?
okay, seven minutes in heaven.
it's a stakeout, dorkus.
Sarah's completely focused.
it's a rule.
two people can't sit in a car at night
and not make out.
Aww, little Zoe. So naive.
a significant heat source is approaching
the front side of the complex.
let's go.
Kitt, do you still have them?
Yes, they are currently attempting
to breach the facility's main gate.
I'm going in.
continue on your present path.
if you come back during the day,
it might be a little easier to get in.
hi there. Remember me?
how's the arm?
get your hands up. Both of you.
shut up!
back off! Now.
come on, Max.
we both know you're not gonna hurt her.
you don't know anything about me.
what are you doing?
shut your mouth! I am sick of hearing you whine.
what?
you take another step, I'll kill her.
please, help me!
Max, for future reference
you may not want to grab the girl who shot me
and use her as a human shield.
drop your weapons,
or, once again, I'll kill her.
Mike, he's serious.
all right.
Michael, Max is getting away.
forget him.
we got what we came for.
daddy, Max made me do everything.
he told me that he was gonna kill you
if I didn't help him.
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm glad you're all right.
how'd she get away?
I don't think she got away.
I think she's buying time for her boyfriend.
she knew daddy would bail her out.
not this time.
there's a federal warrant out for her arrest.
how did you guys hack into
the treasury department's mainframe?
Max did everything.
what is this place?
come on, Nicole.
we're going home.
actually, congressman, she's going
to a federal detention facility.
they do the best tattoos.
that's absurd.
she was clearly being held against her will.
I'm sorry. There's a federal warrant.
don't say a word to anybody.
I'll call my lawyers and have them meet us.
not a word.
daddy?
is that really necessary?
not necessary, but it's the law.
wait.
I need to talk to my dad.
can I just talk to him for one minute, please?
I want to talk to mom too.
can you get her on the phone?
sure, sweetheart.
do they really have to listen to this?
take your time.
20 bucks says Nikki rolls over on Max.
no way. She loves him.
Plus, he's way hot.
hot?
are we watching the same movie?
double or nothing.
you're on.
my daughter's agreed to testify against Max,
provide the names of everyone in his organization.
thank you.
and I'm sure the fbi will appreciate her cooperation.
well, then take off her cuffs.
I'm sorry.
it's okay, daddy.
I'm ready.
take me in.
I'll go with her.
Hey.
did you see the look on nikki's face when Carrie put the cuffs on her?
it was like her eyes almost popped out of her head.
it doesn't matter.
what do you mean?
I mean limited intel
tying our hands.
come on,
we were set up for failure.
Max gets away and she gets off?
what's it all for?
we brought back the congressman's daughter.
mission accomplished.
Yeah, but Max is still out there.
and I don't like leaving loose ends.
I think we did the best we could given our parameters.
look, we're not the first
to get sidelined by politics.
and we're not gonna be the last.
Sarah, you're a scientist.
what do you know about politics?
how do you think I got the funding for my research all these years?
look, what's done is done.
game room. Eight ball.
I'm up five games to four.
your memory's as bad as your aim.
I'm up five-four.
please, I would beat you one-handed.
agent Rivai,
you thought about your future?
on a daily basis, congressman.
I can make sure that future becomes brighter than you ever imagined.
not gonna happen.
well, she's my daughter.
had to give it a shot.
Dr. Graiman, have you made any modifications to the computer system?
no. Why?
one of the firewalls is down.
that's impossible.
the system was accessed from the game room.
what's going on?
there's no way she could have logged on from here.
the system's locked.
it's still locked, but it's been breached.
has anything been downloaded?
she took it.
who? - Took what?
she took it all.
what exactly did she get?
four tiny little files, except it's who we are,
what we do, our secret location,
and our ties to the government.
if that gets on the internet...
she downloaded everything?
how?
I don't know, but she did.
alert Carrie. Mike, find her. Fast.
I've plotted an intercept course for agent Rivai.
we will need maximum speed to reach them
Kitt, attack mode.
initiating transformation
transformation complete
daddy?
Yeah.
what's gonna happen to me?
don't worry.
they'll take care of everything.
rivai
Nikki stole our files.
what?
she downloaded five classified files from the ssc computer.
she has everything on us.
she must've had some sort of wireless scanner.
you need to search her.
Kitt's tracking the van's gps. Tell Carrie I'm on my way.
we're getting a ton of chatter on the web.
Max is telling everyone that they have something big.
Mike, you have to stop them before our files end up on the internet.
we have reason to believe
that your daughter stole classified information.
what information?
Carrie says she doesn't have anything on her.
is there any other way she could've
transmitted the information out of the ssc?
even if she pulled the files using a wireless trawler,
she'd have to dump them to a drive.
the congressman's cell phone!
Carrie, she downloaded the files to the congressman's cell phone.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course.
may I see it?
sorry, dad.
Carrie, can you hear me?
something happened.
play back the last ten seconds of that phone call.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course.
may I see it?
sorry, dad.
that did not sound good.
I'll take that, daddy.
Hey, babby
are we ready to roll?
she's going with us.
we lost contact with Carrie.
there was some sort of crash.
there was. Kitt, normal mode.
initiating trasformation
transformation complete
Max tracked the congressman's cell phone.
everybody stay back!
Nikki's gone.
and I think they took Carrie hostage.
Kitt, call an ambulance.
the congressman's down.
they had another car waiting.
we can trace them via the congressman's phone.
no, we can't.
she pulled out the battery.
any sign of Carrie?
Kitt, you picking up anything?
there are no discernable traces of agent Rivai in the immediate vicinity.
what about these tracks?
I want infrared.
I have analyzed the vehicles on site.
the treads do not match any of their tires.
Kitt's right, they don't match the emergency vehicles or police cars on the scene.
it's possible the tracks are from the getaway car.
the tread is from a goodyear assurance comfort tread.
it's one of the most popular brands of tires sold and distributed in north America.
of course it is.
great. That narrows it down.
we got something here.
looks like an oil leak.
that's correct, Michael.
is that leak from the getaway car?
based on its viscosity, and level of oxidation,
there is a 93% chance it is.
Kitt, analyze the roads within 100-mile radius
and search for a car with a fluid leak at the same rate per distance.
there are exactly 47 vehicles within those parameters.
probability is high that one of them is the vehicle Max is driving.
Kitt, let's roll.
they should be within striking distance of Nikki and Max.
still narrowing.
there are 23 vehicles on that stretch of highway that could be a match for the car Nikki and Max are driving.
got anything, Kitt?
I do not detect our primary targets, nor agent Rivai.
how many of the cars have cell phones?
the signals are from 20 cars.
check the remaining three.
that's right, she dumped the battery.
Kitt, I need to see inside those cars.
accessing satellite imagery.
putting it on-screen now.
got it.
any sign of Rivai?
Kitt, give me heat signatures.
heat signatures on-screen.
she's not moving.
Kitt, is she alive?
scanning now.
come on, Carrie. Move.
agent Rivai is alive.
we got movement!
Mike, go!
with pleasure.
Ow! That's what I'm talking about!
we can download now.
Houston, we have a problem.
what is it?
she turned on her father's cell.
she must have another battery.
it's uploading our files to the internet.
Billy, run the sweeper program.
not working. Mike, I can't stop the transfer.
Kitt, deploy e. M.P.
it'll stop the car and fry the cell phone.
Michael, at their current speed,
there is a nearly 100% probability that the electromagnetic pulse will cause the vehicle to flip.
what if we take out a tire?
it will cause an uncontrollable spin
resulting in a cataclysmic crash.
okay, bad idea.
what if we take out both rears at the same time?
causing both rear tires to deflate simultaneously should result in the least dangerous outcome.
unfortunately, I cannot fire two spikes simultaneously.
Kitt, take the wheel.
you take the right, I'll take the left.
on my mark.
if we do not fire at exactly the same moment
I know, Kitt.
three.
two. One.
fire!
their upload's almost complete.
Carrie's safety is your first concern, Mike.
once they complete the transfer,
they won't need her anymore.
come on. Get up.
you have no idea what you're doing.
I could say the same thing about you.
who's your buyer? China?
north Korea?
I'm not selling them.
this isn't about some tech war.
it's about telling the truth.
to who?
the American people.
we just uploaded the files to the internet
to expose the lies and hypocrisy of the people you work for.
you don't even know who you work for, do you?
I jammed the transfer,
but ran a mimic program to make it look like it went through.
boy genius does it again.
I'm feeling tingly all over.
get that, Mike?
transfer is complete, baby.
we're good to go.
hate to chat and run.
but we'll be needing your car.
hand over agent Rivai first.
what, do you think we're stupid? She's our only bargaining chip.
toss the gun.
drop it!
Kitt, you know what to do.
Yes, Michael.
you're really gonna regret this.
shut up before we shoot you.
Where're the keys?
there are no keys.
agent Rivai, protocol alpha, Charlie, beta, seven.
copy that, Kitt.
Hey, the doors are locked.
you okay? - Uh huh.
so what have we learned about relationships today, Kitt?
men and women are erratic, unpredictable, and irrational.
I believe I have learned nothing.
no, Kitt, you've learned everything.
predictability takes all the fun out of a relationship.
in addition, I searched the municipal codes of every city in the United States.
there is no such thing as the make out rule.
what?
you told Zoe you can't park in a car at night without making out.
and that it's a rule.
well, it may not be in any database,
but it's a rule.
trust me.
well, it's night,
and you are both in a parked car.
rules are rules.
Really?
Mike and Sarah are approaching.
duck!
Hey. - Hey.
hear the news? - What?
congress quietly doubled our funding.
huh.
I wonder if that has anything to do with the charges being dropped against Nikki?
and poor Max is gonna serve 20 to life.
what a boy won't do for a girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
good-night.
good-night.
busted.
five bucks she takes him out.
not if she sleeps with him first.
is this a sparring match or a mating ritual?
both.
I'm afraid I don't understand the dynamics of the male-female relationship.
and you probably never will, Kitt.
come on, he wants to learn.
we should teach him.
see, this so-called sparring session is how they say let's play a little "how's your father"?
without actually having to say it.
why not simply ask for sex?
cause it reeks of desperation. - He should know.
I did detect a rise in hormone levels when Mike and Sarah started hitting one another.
now you're starting to get it.
not bad.
maybe if you put a little more oomph into it.
like that?
is this another example of an indirect request for intimacy?
she's straddling him.
I'd say that's pretty direct.
Mr. Torres is approaching.
duck! Kitt, screen off!
Mike! - Yeah?
briefing in ten minutes.
you're going out.
I need a shower.
me too.
me too. - Me too.
Billy, your hormone levels elevated with Zoe's when you hit on top of each other.
does that mean that you also want to play "how's your father"?
no.
this is all very perplexing.
can I borrow your shampoo?
look at my sexy man.
here we go.
I see answers.
Oh, boy.
now that's shock and awe, people.
you have everything on screen?
everything as of three minutes ago.
this is their last live screen.
I smell foreplay.
freshly showered foreplay.
what are we looking at?
Bonnie and Clyde.
you'll like these two, Mike.
they hacked into the treasury and transferred all senatorial and congressional salaries to Iraqi war widows through untraceable wire transfers.
not bad. - Oh, they're good.
real good. - They're anarchists.
and they're getting more brazen by the day.
they started with soft targets and they're working their way up.
their website states that their primary objective is to take down the military industrial complex of the United States.
of which we are a part.
if their online following keeps growing at its present rate, they might actually be able to do it.
these guys are becoming a pop phenomenon.
top hit on all search engines.
what do they call themselves?
Nikki and Max for a free America.
you aren't serious.
unfortunately, I am.
wow, they're hot.
I think Sarah should come with me on this one.
I bet you do.
Yeah, I should go with Mike.
I don't think that's a good idea.
dad, I think a female perspective will be a valuable asset on this one.
she's absolutely right.
Kitt, have you figured out where they'll hit next?
I have factored in all known variables, including, but not limited to online chatter, websites, blogs.
And?
and I have deducted the probable location of their next target.
the town of Hastings.
you're guessing, Kitt?
deduction, logic, and probability are not guessing.
a guess is a prediction about the outcome made without factual evidence or support.
I do not guess, Mike.
why didn't you tell him who Nikki is?
cause they don't need to know.
and the FBI doesn't want it public.
mark my words.
this is gonna blow up in our faces.
so? - So.
so we're alone.
let's talk. - Come on.
it's not like we're ever really...alone.
what, kitt?
he's cool.
actually, my core temperature is running a bit high due to the incline and low altitude.
what about Billy...Zoe, Torres?
your dad?
cause nobody has anything better to do than spy on Michael knight all day.
I have nothing better to do.
me neither. Got all the time in the world.
we're on a mission.
I like to keep personal stuff and work stuff separate, that's all.
so why did you want me to come?
what, you didn't wanna come?
no, you said,"Sarah should come with me on this one."
cause I thought you wanted to come.
what about the whole female perspective thing?
what about the whole rec room, shower thing?
I just thought...
what? - Oh, I get it.
you're gonna play it like that.
like what? - I don't know.
Hey, guys.
there's lots of chatter on the web about Nikki and Max's next target, and the number 15 keeps coming up.
15? An address, a date, a highway?
Kitt, analyze the number 15 and Hastings with respect to the previous targets of Nikki and Max.
I can provide no meaningfully relevant results using Hastings and the number 15.
I'll stay on it.
you guys okay? - We're fine.
Yeah, we're okay. Why?
just checking. No big.
outtie.
how long do you think?
I say he goes first.
I say you're misreading the whole dynamic.
he's all coiled up and hinky.
hinky?
Mike is loose as a goose.
a man with a plan. A dude in a mellow mood.
you rhyme like a white boy and not a beastie boy.
ten bucks he breaks before she does.
make it a double sawbuck.
you're on.
that could be anything.
there's gotta be some kind of pattern to it.
what? - Nothing.
he folded like a cheap lawn chair.
no way! It's completely innocent conversation.
he's practically drooling.
him?
Sarah can barely keep her hands off my boy.
are we watching the same movie?
we're doing this all for you.
that's right.
you can count on us.
we are your answers.
these crazy kids.
sure, just two misguided teens in a hot car blowing things up.
well, the hazardous waste facility that they destroyed was named in a class-action suit.
so you think they're doing the public a service?
no, come on.
country was born in violence and dissent.
it's always been with us.
well, I appreciate the homage to the founding fathers, but anarchy is not the answer, Charles.
Yeah, well, one man's anarchist, another man's Robin Hood.
they're dangerous and reckless.
period.
depends on your point of view.
I don't see how you can look at it any other way.
well, maybe to the untrained eye we're the ones riding around in a hot car blowing things up.
all right, this is Max...and Nikki...
we shall see you guys next time.
we love you. - Ow, peace!
they're entering Hastings.
I synchro'd the traffic signals on approach with Kitt's speed.
it should save them a couple of minutes.
awesomeness.
how did you hack the grid?
I repurposed that software firewall you invented and slipped it in as a trojan horse to the traffic control computer in hastings.
great minds, right?
I'm uploading a list of motels to Kitt.
look, this one has a vibrating bed.
hope they brought quarters.
they should just get it over with, right?
Absolutely. Clears the head.
when I was playing planetary war craft last night,
I imagined you were Queen Zorda of Gorn.
queen Zorda?
the naked chick with the tentacles?
Yeah. - Ew.
I, uh...
did you just go all clarence thomas on me?
no, the traffic cam and the software firewall,
I thought we were having a moment.
I could so call human resources right now.
I'm--I'm sorry. It was a-- it was a misunderstanding.
I'm going to ask you a question.
think very carefully before you answer.
okay.
what was I doing with my tentacles?
if this is our future, I'm really worried.
15 kilometers, 15 miles, 15 what?
maybe it's their 15th mission.
no, it's their 10th mission.
if you call terrorism a mission.
look.
military time.
1500 hours. 3:00.
it's a quarter to three now.
we only have 15 minutes to find the location.
there is no empirical evidence to support your supposition, Michael.
it's a hunch, Kitt.
if I'm wrong, at 3: 01, I'll apologize.
Kitt, display all possible targets again.
there are three military installations within a 30-mile radius.
there are no munitions plants, no manufacturers of guidance systems, and no ordnance suppliers.
there's a cop checking us out.
he is eying you suspiciously.
roll with it.
pay up.
smells like victory.
buy yourself something nice.
I will.
Sarah, Michael, you may unlock your lips now.
the officer is leaving.
okay.
we're good. - Yeah, good.
when I was in Iraq, sometimes we'd lose a huge truck over a tiny little fuel pump relay.
so?
so maybe there's a company here that produces something small, that could affect something big.
Kitt, research.
light manufacturing only.
part suppliers for vital industries, military, energy.
anderson valve, manufacturers of check valves used in every major oil refinery in the United States.
destruction of anderson's valve making capacity will destruct the supply chain and increase the price of gasoline.
how much? - I estimate approximately $10 per gallon.
where is it? - 3. 2 miles from our current location.
anderson valve, let's go.
that's their car...
1970 super bee, 426 hemi, four barrel, four speed.
what a beaut.
only 21 were produced with the hemispherical head engine, and four-speed transmission.
you boys done?
Kitt, weapons.
each carries a 15 round magazine, and I.D. badges, compliments of Dr. Graiman.
the cameras on your identity badges are linked real time with the NSA's facial recognition database.
so we should be able to help you find Nikki and Max.
be careful.
Thanks, dad.
Kitt, open sesame.
how the hell are we supposed to find these guys?
process of elimination.
we'll alert you when facial recog finds someone who doesn't belong.
how much time?
just under two minutes.
Kitt, scan for valve making equipment.
seven different valves are produced in the building.
one minute remaining. - Copy.
Kitt, you said "check valve" earlier. - Yes, Sarah.
scan only for one-way valves.
the only equipment capable of producing a one-way valve is 30 yards to your one o'clock.
should thin the herd a bit.
Billy, my sensors have detected the presence of c-4.
Kitt sniffers detected c-4! - All right.
Sarah, there are explosives in that room.
Hey!
Oh, boy.
Mike, get out of there.
it's too late, I'm going to try to disarm it.
Michael, throw the bag into the alley.
Thoue's enough c-4 to take out half the building.
Michael, you cannot disarm it in time.
I have a plan.
Kitt! I am fine, Michael.
you may want to assist Sarah.
Nikki and Max are getting away.
Freeze!
drop it.
you drop yours.
move it another inch, and you won't have any fingers left.
it's her.
Sarah, can you hear me?
Yeah, Carrie, I got 'em.
do not shoot.
Sarah, fire if you have to.
negative, do not fire.
Nikki's congressman Childress' daughter.
bet they told you not to shoot me, didn't they?
they're idiots.
you should've shot her.
Ow! - Sorry.
you were always bad at operation when we were kids.
just good at playing doctor.
incoming call.
put it up, exterior mode.
Mike, are you okay?
why weren't we told who she was?
the information was considered "need to know."
when it results in Sarah pulling buckshot from my arm
I'd call it "need to know.
the congressman asked us to keep this quiet.
we felt obliged to honor his request.
mm, I can't believe you sent me after some spoiled brat running around with a dude and a shotgun.
what's her problem?
daddy didn't buy her a pony when she was a little girl?
actually, I bought her two.
Max has her brainwashed.
congressman.
Max teach her how to shoot, too?
Mike, please.
you must be Michael knight.
nice to finally meet you.
I'm afraid I'm to blame for my daughter's aim.
she's bagged her fair share of deer over the years.
good thing I don't have antlers.
Nicole is a sweet girl.
I may have overindulged her, and her mother leaving wasn't easy, but this is not her.
Yeah, she seems like a real angel.
that's my daughter Sarah.
she's a sweet girl too.
most of the time.
the girl was always strong-willed, but this is something else.
she went to Berkeley to get an education.
four years later, I barely recognized the girl I moved into the dormitory.
and you think Max was responsible?
he's a cancer.
he took my only child from me.
the situation seems to be similar to that of Patty Hearst.
creating a condition - we know what Stockholm syndrome is, Kitt.
Mike will find her.
and bring her back safely.
I don't want my daughter hurt, Mr.Knight.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
I'll take care of it.
thank you, Michael.
charmer, isn't he?
he's a politician, charming is his business.
he's also been very supportive of my father's experiments for years.
you mean he's knight industries' congressional sugar daddy.
Yep.
you buy it, the Patty Hearst thing?
not one bit.
she shot me with a smile on her face.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
where would you go if you were them?
an island in the South Pacific.
nice.
I have an alternate hypothesis. - Of course you do.
surveillance footage captured from anderson valve included this.
I'm not sure what I'm looking at, but it's definitely not an island in the South Pacific.
I apologize. Allow me to zoom.
and focus on the paper in his pocket.
tee Ticks?
Kitt, search for words or phrases containing those letters in that order.
I've done that.
there are more than three million possibilities.
but there is also an image in the corner of the document.
can you tell what it is?
it's too obscured for my recognition software.
but it's quite possible the shape is a corporate logo.
so now cross-check those letters with the names of corporations.
which narrows the list down to 78 worldwide.
now sort only for the U.S.
it leaves six possibilities, and only one of those has a military connection.
for many years, they were a small family-run operation.
but their business expanded rapidly due to military contracts.
what do they make? - Turbofan engines used on tomahawk missiles.
Where's their main base of operations?
it is a factory complex 134 miles from here.
that's their next target.
maybe we were wrong.
no, they'll show up eventually.
could be a couple hours.
any suggestions on how we could kill some time?
I have access to any number of games, puzzles, movies, trivia.
he wasn't talking to you, Kitt.
spin the bottle.
what are you, 12?
okay, Seven Minutes in Heaven.
it's a stakeout, Dorkus.
Sarah's completely focused.
it's a rule.
two people can't sit in a car at night and not make out.
Aww, little zoe. So naive.
a significant heat source is approaching the front side of the complex.
let's go.
Kitt, do you still have them?
Yes, they are currently attempting to breach the facility's main gate.
I'm going in. - Continue on your present path.
if you come back during the day, it might be a little easier to get in.
hi there. Remember me?
how's the arm?
get your hands up.
both of you.
Max! - Shut up!
back off! Now.
come on, Max.
we both know you're not gonna hurt her.
you don't know anything about me.
what are you doing? - Shut your mouth!
I am sick of hearing you whine.
what?
you take another step, I'll kill her.
please, help me!
Max, for future reference you may not want to grab the girl who shot me and use her as a human shield.
drop your weapons, or, once again, I'll kill her.
Mike, he's serious.
Mike. - All right.
Michael, Max is getting away.
forget him. We got what we came for.
daddy, Max made me do everything.
he told me that he was gonna kill you if I didn't help him.
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm glad you're all right.
how'd she get away?
I don't think she got away.
I think she's buying time for her boyfriend.
she knew daddy would bail her out. - Not this time.
there's a federal warrant out for her arrest.
how did you guys hack into the treasury department's mainframe?
Max did everything.
what is this place?
come on, Nicole.
we're going home.
actually, congressman, she's going to a federal detention facility.
they do the best tattoos.
that's absurd.
she was clearly being held against her will.
Alex. - I'm sorry.
there's a federal warrant.
don't say a word to anybody.
I'll call my lawyers and have them meet us.
not a word.
daddy?
is that really necessary?
not necessary, but it's the law.
wait. I need to talk to my dad.
can I just talk to him for one minute, please?
I want to talk to mom too.
can you get her on the phone?
sure, sweetheart.
do they really have to listen to this?
take your time.
20 bucks says Nikki rolls over on Max.
no way. She loves him.
Plus, he's way hot.
hot?
are we watching the same movie?
double or nothing.
you're on.
my daughter's agreed to testify against max, provide the names of everyone in his organization.
thank you.
and I'm sure the fbi will appreciate her cooperation.
well, then take off her cuffs.
I'm sorry.
it's okay, daddy. I'm ready.
take me in. - I'll go with her.
Hey.
did you see the look on Nikki's face when Carrie put the cuffs on her?
it was like her eyes almost popped out of her head.
it doesn't matter.
what do you mean?
I mean limited intel tying our hands.
come on, we were set up for failure.
Max gets away and she gets off? What's it all for?
we brought back the congressman's daughter.
mission accomplished. - Yeah, but Max is still out there.
and I don't like leaving loose ends.
I think we did the best we could given our parameters.
look, we're not the first to get sidelined by politics.
and we're not gonna be the last.
Sarah, you're a scientist.
what do you know about politics?
how do you think I got the funding for my research all these years?
look, what's done is done.
game room. Eight ball.
I'm up five games to four.
your memory's as bad as your aim.
I'm up five-four.
please, I would beat you one-handed.
agent Rivai, you thought about your future?
on a daily basis, congressman.
I can make sure that future becomes brighter than you ever imagined.
not gonna happen.
well, she's my daughter. Had to give it a shot.
Dr. Graiman, have you made any modifications to the computer system?
no. Why?
one of the firewalls is down.
that's impossible.
the system was accessed from the game room.
what's going on?
there's no way she could have logged on from here.
the system's locked.
it's still locked, but it's been breached.
has anything been downloaded?
she took it. - Who?
took what? - Nikki.
she took it all.
what exactly did she get?
four tiny little files, except it's who we are, what we do, our secret location, and our ties to the government.
if that gets on the internet...
she downloaded everything?
how? - I don't know, but she did.
alert Carrie.
Mike, find her. Fast.
I've plotted an intercept course for agent Rivai.
Kitt, attack mode.
daddy? - Yeah.
what's gonna happen to me?
don't worry. They'll take care of everything.
rivai , Nikki stole our files. - What?
she downloaded five classified files from the ssc computer.
she has everything on us.
she must've had some sort of wireless scanner.
you need to search her.
Kitt's tracking the van's GPS.
tell Carrie I'm on my way.
we're getting a ton of chatter on the web.
Max is telling everyone that they have something big.
Mike, you have to stop them before our files end up on the internet.
we have reason to believe that your daughter stole classified information.
what information?
Carrie says she doesn't have anything on her.
is there any other way she could've transmitted the information out of the SSC?
even if she pulled the files using a wireless trawler, she'd have to dump them to a drive.
the congressman's cell phone!
Carrie, she downloaded the files to the congressman's cell phone.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course. - May I see it?
sorry, dad.
Carrie. Carrie, can you hear me?
something happened.
Billy, play back the last ten seconds of that phone call.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course. - May I see it?
that did not sound good.
I'll take that, daddy.
are we ready to roll?
she's going with us.
Mike, we lost contact with Carrie.
there was some sort of crash.
there was.
Kitt, normal mode.
Max tracked the congressman's cell phone.
everybody stay back!
Nikki's gone.
and I think they took Carrie hostage.
Kitt, call an ambulance. The congressman's down.
they had another car waiting.
we can trace them via the congressman's phone.
no, we can't.
she pulled out the battery.
any sign of Carrie?
Kitt, you picking up anything?
there are no discernable traces of agent rivai in the immediate vicinity.
what about these tracks? I want infrared.
I have analyzed the vehicles on site.
the treads do not match any of their tires.
Kitt's right, they don't match the emergency vehicles or police cars on the scene.
it's possible the tracks are from the getaway car.
the tread is from a Goodyear Assurance Comfort tread.
it's one of the most popular brands of tires sold and distributed in North America.
of course it is.
great. That narrows it down.
we got something here.
looks like an oil leak.
that's correct, Michael.
is that leak from the getaway car?
based on its viscosity, and level of oxidation, there is a 93% chance it is.
Kitt, analyze the roads within 100-mile radius and search for a car with a fluid leak at the same rate per distance.
there are exactly 47 vehicles within those parameters.
probability is high that one of them is the vehicle Max is driving.
they should be within striking distance of Nikki and Max.
still narrowing. There are 23 vehicles on that stretch of highway that could be a match for the car Nikki and Max are driving.
got anything, Kitt?
I do not detect our primary targets, nor agent Rivai.
how many of the cars have cell phones?
the signals are from 20 cars.
check the remaining three.
that's right, she dumped the battery.
Kitt, I need to see inside those cars.
accessing satellite imagery.
putting it on-screen now.
got it.
any sign of Rivai?
Kitt, give me heat signatures.
heat signatures on-screen.
she's not moving.
Kitt, is she alive?
come on, carrie. Move.
we got movement!
Mike, go!
with pleasure.
we can download now.
Houston, we have a problem.
what is it?
she turned on her father's cell.
she must have another battery.
it's uploading our files to the internet.
Billy, run the sweeper program. - Not working.
Mike, I can't stop the transfer.
Kitt, deploy E.M.P.
it'll stop the car and fry the cell phone.
Michael, at their current speed, there is a nearly 100% probability that the electromagnetic pulse will cause the vehicle to flip.
what if we take out a tire?
it will cause an uncontrollable spin resulting in a cataclysmic crash.
okay, bad idea.
what if we take out both rears at the same time?
causing both rear tires to deflate simultaneously should result in the least dangerous outcome.
unfortunately, I cannot fire two spikes simultaneously.
Kitt, take the wheel.
you take the right, I'll take the left. On my mark.
if we do not fire at exactly the same moment - I know, Kitt.
fire!
their upload almost complete.
Carrie's safety is your first concern, Mike.
once they complete the transfer, they won't need her anymore.
come on. Get up.
you have no idea what you're doing.
I could say the same thing about you.
urs yo buyer?
china? North korea?
I'm not selling them.
this isn't about some tech war.
it's about telling the truth.
to who? The American people.
we just uploaded the files to the internet to expose the lies and hypocrisy of the people you work for.
you don't even know who you work for, do you?
I jammed the transfer, but ran a mimic program to make it look like it went through.
boy genius as it gain.
I'm feeling tingly all over.
get that, Mike?
transfer is complete, baby.
we're good to go.
hate to chat and run.
but we'll be needing your car.
hand over agent Rivai first.
what, do you think we're stupid?
she's our only bargaining chip.
toss the gun.
drop it!
Kitt, you know what to do.
Yes, Michael.
you're really gonna regret this.
shut up before we shoot you.
Where're the keys? - there are no keys.
agent Rivai, protocol alpha, charlie, beta, seven.
copy that, Kitt.
you okay?
so what have we learned about relationships today, Kitt?
men and women are erratic, unpredictable, and irrational.
I believe I have learned nothing.
no, kitt, you've learned everything.
predictability takes all the fun out of a relationship.
in addition, I searched the municipal codes of every city in the United States.
there is no such thing as the make out rule.
what?
you told Zoe you can't park in a car at night without making out.
and that it's a rule.
well, it may not be in any database, but it's a rule.
trust me.
well, it's night, and you are both in a parked car.
rules are rules.
Really?
Mike and Sarah are approaching.
duck!
Hey. - Hey.
hear the news? - What?
congress quietly doubled our funding.
I wonder if that has anything to do with the charges being dropped against Nikki?
and poor Max is gonna rve20 to life.
what a boy won't do for a girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
good-night.
good-night.
busted.
five bucks she takes him out.
not if she sleeps with him first.
wow can she be rated ex
is this a sparring match or a mating ritual?
both.
I'm afraid I don't understand the dynamics
of the male-female relationship.
and you probably never will, Kitt.
come on, he wants to learn.
we should teach him.
see, this so-called sparring session is how they say
let's play a little "how's your father"?
without actually having to say it.
why not simply ask for sex?
cause it reeks of desperation.
he should know.
I did detect a rise in hormone levels when Mike and Sarah started hitting one another.
now you're starting to get .
not bad.
maybe if you put a little more oomph into it.
like that?
is this another example of an indirect request for intimacy?
she's straddling him.
I'd say that's pretty direct.
Mr. Torres is approaching.
Kitt, screen off!
Mike!
yeah?
briefing in ten minutes.
you're going out.
I need a shower.
me too
me too. Me too.
Billy, your hormone levels elevated with Zoe's when you hit on top of each other.
does that mean that you also want to play "how's your father"?
no.
this is all very perplexing
can I borrow your shampoo?
look at my sexy man.
here we go.
I see answers.
Oh, boy.
now that's shock and awe, people.
you have everything on screen?
everything as of three minutes ago.
this is their last live screen.
I smell foreplay.
freshly showered foreplay.
what are we looking at
Bonnie and Clyde.
you'll like these two, Mike.
they hacked into the treasury and transferred all senatorial and congressional salaries to Iraqi war widows through untraceable wire transfers.
not bad.
Oh, they're good.
real good.
they're anarchists.
and they're gettin more brazen by the day.
they started with soft targets
and they're working their way up.
their website states that their primary objective is to take down the military industrial complex of the United States.
of which we are a part.
if their online following keeps growing at its present rate, they might actually be able to do it.
these guys are becoming a pop phenomenon
top hit on all search engines.
what do they call themselves?
Nikki and Max for a free America.
you aren't serious.
unfortunately, I am.
well, they're hot.
I think Sarah should come with me on this one.
I bet you do.
Yeah, I should go with Mike
I don't think that's a good idea.
dad, I think a female perspective will be a valuable asset on this one.
she's absolutely right.
Kitt, have you figured out where they'll hit next?
I have factored in all known variables,
including, but not limited to online chatter, websites, blogs. And?
and I have deducted the probable location of their next target.
the town of Hastings.
you are guessing, Kitt?
deduction, logic, and probability are not guessing.
a guess is a prediction about the outcome
made without factual evidence or support.
why didn't you tell him who Nikki is?
cause they don't need to know.
and the FBI doesn' want it public.
mark my words.
this is gonna blow up in our faces.
so
so.
so we're alone.
let's talk.
come on.
it's not like we're ever really...alone.
what, Kitt?
he's cool.
actually, my core temperature is running a bit high due to the incline and low altitude.
what about Billy... Zoe, Torres?
your dad?
cause nobody has anything better to do than spy on Michael knight all day.
I have nothing better to do.
me neither.
got all the time in the world.
we're on a mission.
I like to keep personal stuff and work stuff separate, that's all.
so why did you want me to come?
what, you didn't wanna come?
no, you said, "Sarah should come with me on this one."
cause I thought you wanted to come.
what about the whole female perspective thing?
what about the whole rec room, shower thing?
I just thought.
what?
Oh, I get it.
you're gonna play it like that.
like what?
I don't know.
Hey, guys.
there's lots of chatter on the web about Nikki and Max's next target,
and the number 15 keeps coming up.
15?
an address, a date, a...highway?
Kitt, analyze the number 15 and Hastings with respect to the previous targets of Nikki and Max.
I can provide no meaningfully relevant results using Hastings and the number 15.
I'll stay on it.
you guys okay?
we're fine. Yeah, we're okay why?
just checking.
no big.
outtie.
how long do you think
I say he goes first.
I say you're misreading the whole dynamic.
he's all coiled up and hinky.
hinky?
Mike is loose as a goose.
a man with a plan.
a dude in a mellow mood.
you rhyme like a white boy and not a beastie boy.
ten bucks he breaks before she does.
make it a double sawbuck.
you're on.
that could be anything.
there's gotta be some kind of pattern to it.
what?
nothing.
he folded like a cheap lawn chair.
no way!
it's completely innocent conversation.
he's practically drooling.
him?
Sarah can barely keep her hands off my boy.
are we watching the same movie?
we're doing this all for you.
that's right.
you can count on us. Take charge.
take charge!
we are your answers.
these crazy kids
sure, just two misguided teens in a hot car
blowing things up
well, the hazardous waste facility that they destroyed was named in a class-action suit.
so you think they're doing the public a service?
no, come on.
country was born in violence and dissent
it's always been with us.
well, I appreciate the homage to the founding fathers,
but anarchy is not the answer, Charles.
Yeah, well, one man's anarchist,
another man's Robin Hood
they're dangerous and reckless.
period.
depend on your point of view
I don't see how you can look at it any other way.
well, maybe to the untrained eye
we're the ones riding around in a hot car blowing things up.
all right, this is Max...
and Nikki...
we shall see you guys next time.
we love you.
ow, peace!
they're entering Hastings.
I synchro'd the traffic signals on approach with Kitt's speed.
it should save the a couple of minutes.
awesomeness.
how did you hack the grid?
I repurposed that software firewall you invented
and slipped it in as a trojan horse to the traffic control computer in Hastings.
great minds, right?
I'm uploading a list of motels to Kitt.
look, this one has a vibrating bed.
hope they brought quarters.
they should just get it over with, right?
Absolutely.
clears the head.
when I was playing planetary war craft last night,
I imagined you were Queen Zorda of Gorn.
queen Zorda?
the naked chick with the tentacles?
ha. yeah.
I, uh...
did you just go all Clarence Thomas on me?
no, the traffic cam
and the software firewall,
I thought we were having a moment.
I could so call human resources right now.
I'm-- I'm sorry.
it was a-- it was a misunderstanding.
I'm going ask you a question.
think very carefully before you answer.
okay.
what was I doing with my tentacles?
if this is our future, I'm really worried.
15 kilometers, 15 miles, 15 what?
maybe it's their 15th mission.
no, it's their 10th mission.
if you call terrorism a mission.
look.
military time. 1500 hours.
it's a quarter to three now.
we only have 15 minutes to find the location.
there is no empirical evidence to support your supposition, Michael.
it's a hunch, Kitt.
if I'm wrong, at 3: 01, I'll apologize.
Kitt, display all possible targets again.
there are three military installations within a 30-mile radius.
too obvious, and too highly fortified.
there are no munitions plants,
no manufacturers of guidance systems,
and no ordnance suppliers.
there's a cop checking us out.
he is eying you suspiciously.
roll with it.
pay up.
smells like victory.
buy yourself something nice.
I will.
Sarah, Michael, you may unlock your lips now.
the officer is leaving.
okay. we're good
Yeah, good.
when I was in Iraq sometimes we'd lose a huge truck over a tiny little fuel pump relay.
so?
so maybe there's a company here that produces something small,
that could affect something big.
Kitt, research.
light manufacturg only.
part suppliers for vital industries, military, energy.
anderson valve, manufacturers of check valves
used in every major oil refine in the United States.
destruction of anderson's valve making capacity
will destruct the supply chain
and increase the price of gasoline.
how much?
I estimate approximately $10 per gallon.
where is it?
3. 2 miles from our current location.
anderson valve, let's go.
that's their car...
1970 super bee, 426 hemi, four barrel, four speed.
what a beaut.
only 21 were produced with the hemispherical head engine, and four-speed transmission.
you boys done? Mm. Mm-m
Kitt, weapons.
each carries a 15 round magazine and I.D. badges, compliments of Dr. Graiman.
the cameras on your identity badges are linked real time with the NSA's facial recognition database.
so we should be able to help you find Nikki and Max.
be careful.
Thanks, dad.
Kitt, open sesame.
how the hell are we supposed to find these guys?
process of elimination.
we'll alert you when facial recog finds someone who doesn't belong.
how much time?
just under two minutes.
Kitt, scan for valve making equipment.
seven different valves are produced in the building.
one minute remaining.
copy.
Kitt, you said "check valve" earlier.
Yes, Sarah.
scan only for one-way valves.
the only equipment capable of producing a one-way valve is 30 yards to your one o'clock.
should thin the herd a bit.
Billy, my sensors have detected the presence of c-4.
Kitt sniffers detected c-4!
all right.
Sarah, there are explosives in that room.
Oh, boy.
Mike, get out of there.
it's too late, I'm going to try to disarm it
Michael, throw the bag into the alley.
there's enough c-4 to take out half the building.
Michael, you cannot disarm it in time.
I have a plan.
Kitt.
Kitt! I am fine, Michael.
you may want to assist Sarah.
Nikki and Max are getting away.
Freeze!
drop it.
you drop yours.
move it another inch, and you won't have any fingers left.
it's her. Sarah, can you hear me?
Yeah, Carrie, I got 'em.
do not shoot
Sarah, fire if you have to.
negative,
do not fire.
Nikks congressman Childress' daughter.
bet they told you not to shoot me, didn't they?
they're idiots.
Sarah!
Mike!
you should've shot her.
sorry.
you were always bad at operation when we were kids.
Yeah.
just good at playing doctor.
incoming call.
put it up, exterior mode.
Mike, are you okay?
why weren't we told who she was?
the information was considered "need to know."
Mmm, when it results in Sarah pulling buckshot from my arm,
I'd call it "need to know."
the congressman asked us to keep this quiet
we felt obliged to honor his request.
mm, I can't believe you sent me after some spoiled brat running around with a dude and a shot gun
what's her problem?
daddy didn't buy her a pony when she was a little girl?
actually, I bought her two.
Max has her brainwashed.
congressman.
Max teach her how to shoot, too?
Mike, please.
you must be Michael knight
nice to finally meet you.
I'm afraid I'm to blame for my daughter's aim
she's bagged her fair share of deer over the years.
good thing I don't have antlers.
Nicole is a sweet girl.
I may have overindulged her,
and her mother leaving wasn't easy,
but this is not her
Yeah, she seems like a real angel.
that's my daughter Sarah
SHS a sweet girl too.
most of the time.
the girl was always strong-willed,
but this is something else.
she went to Berkeley to get an education.
four years later, I barely recognized the girl I moved into the dormitory.
and you think Max was responsible?
he's a cancer.
he took my only child from me.
the situation seems to be similar to that of Patty Hearst.
creating a condition-- we know what stockholm syndrome is, Kitt.
Mike will find her.
and bring her back safely.
I don't want my daughter hurt, mr. knight.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
I'll take care of it.
thank you, Michael.
charmer, isn't he?
he's a politician, charming is his business.
he's also been very supportive of my father's experiments for years.
you mean he's knight industries' congressional sugar daddy.
Yep.
you buy it, the Patty Hearst thing?
not one bit.
she shot me with a smile on her face.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
where would you go if you were them?
an island in the South Pacific.
nice.
I have an alternate hypothesis.
of course you do.
surveillance footage captured from anderson valve included this.
I'm not sure what I'm looking at,
but it's definitely not an island in the South Pacific.
I apologize.
allow me to zoom.
and focus on the paper in his pocket.
Kitt, search for words or phrases containing those letters in that order.
I've done that.
there are more than three million possibilities.
but there is also an image in the corner of the document.
can you tell what it is?
it's too obscured for my recognition software.
but it's quite possible the shape is a corporate logo.
so now cross-check those letters with the names of corporations.
which narrows the list
down to 78 worldwide.
now sort only for the U.S.
it leaves six possibilities
and only one of those has a military connection.
for many years, they were a small family-run operation.
but their business expanded rapidly
due to military contracts.
what do they make?
turbofan engines used on tomahawk missiles.
Where's their main base of operations?
it is a factory complex 134 miles from her
that's their next target.
maybe we were wrong.
no, they'll show up eventually.
could be a couple hours.
any suggestions on how we could kill some time?
I have access to any number of games,
puzzle movies, trivia.
he wasn't talking to you, Kitt.
spin the bottle.
what are you, 12?
okay, seven minutes in heaven.
it's a stakeout, Dorkus.
saras completely focused.
it's a rule.
two people can't sit in a car at night and not make out.
Aww, little zoe. so naive.
a significant heat source is approaching the front side of the complex.
let's go.
Kitt, do you still have them?
Yes, they ar currently attempting to breach the facility's main gate.
I'm going in.
continue on your present path.
if you come back during the day,
it might be a little easier to get in.
hi there. remember me?
how's the arm?
get your hands up. both of you.
Max!
shut up!
back off! now.
come on, Max.
we both know you're not gonna hurt her.
you dot know anything about me.
what are you doing?
shut your mouth! I am sick of hearing you whine.
what
you take another step, I'll kill her.
please, help me!
Max, for future reference
you may not want to grab the girl who shot me and use her as a human shield.
drop your weapons,
or, once again, I'll kill her
Mike, he's serious.
Mike.
all right.
Michael, Max is getting away.
forget him.
we got what we came for.
daddy, Max made me do everything.
he told me that he was gonna kill you if I didn't help him.
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm glad you're all right.
how'd she get away?
I don't think she got away.
I think she's buying time for her boyfriend.
she knew daddy would bail her out.
not this time.
there's a federal warrant out for her arrest.
how did you guys hack into the treasury department's mainframe?
Max did everything.
what is this place?
come on, Nicole.
we're going home.
actually, congressman, she's going to a federal detention facility.
they do the best tattoos.
that's absurd.
she was clearly being held against her will.
Alex.
I'm sorry. There's a federal warrant.
don't say a word to anybody.
I'll call my lawyers and have them meet us.
not a word.
daddy?
is that really necessary?
not necessary, but it's the law.
wait.
I need to talk to my dad.
can I just talk to him for one minute, please?
I want to talk to mom too.
can you get her on the phone?
sure, sweetheart.
do they really have to listen to this?
take your time.
20 bucks says Nikki rolls over on Max.
no way. She loves him.
Plus, he's way hot.
hot?
are we watching the same movie?
double or nothing.
you're on.
my daughter's agreed to testify against Max,
provide the names of everyone in his organization.
thank you.
and I'm sure the FBI will appreciate her cooperation.
well, then take off her cuffs.
I'm sorry.
it's okay, daddy.
I'm ready.
take me in.
I'll go with her.
did you see the look on Nikki's face when Carrie put the cuffs on her?
it was like her eyes almost popped out of her head.
it doesn't matter.
what do you mean?
I mean limited intel tying our hands.
come on,
we were set up for failure.
Max gets away and she gets off?
what's it all for?
we brought back the congressman's daughter.
mission accomplished.
Yeah, but Max is still out there.
and I don't like leaving loose ends.
I think we did the best we could given our parameters.
look, we're not the first to get sidelined by politics.
and we're not gonna be the last.
Sarah, you're a scientist.
what do you know about politics?
how do you think I got the funding for my research all these years?
look, what's done is done.
game room. Eight ball.
I'm up five games to four.
your memory's as bad as your aim.
I'm up five-four.
please, I would beat you one-handed.
agent Rivai,
you thought about your future?
on a daily basis, congressman.
I can make sure that future becomes brighter than you ever imagined.
not gonna happen.
well, she's my daughter.
had to give it a shot.
Dr. Graiman, have you made any modifications to the computer system?
no. Why?
one of the firewalls is down.
that's impossible.
the system was accessed from the game room.
what's going on?
there's no way she could have logged on from here.
the system's locked.
it's still locked, but it's been breached.
has anything been downloaded?
she took it.
who? Took what?
Nikki.
she took it all.
what exactly did she get?
four tiny little files, except it's who we are, what we do, our secret location,
and our ties to the government.
if that gets on the internet...
she downloaded everything?
how?
I don't know, but she did.
alert Carrie. Mike, find her. Fast.
I've plotted an intercept course for agent Rivai.
we will need maximum speed to reach them
Kitt, attack mode.
initiating transformation
transformation complete
daddy?
Yeah.
what's gonna happen to me?
don't worry.
they'll take care of everything.
rivai
Nikki stole our files.
what?
she downloaded five classified files
from the ssc computer.
she has everything on us.
she must've had some sort of wireless scanner.
you need to search her.
Kitt's tracking the van's GPS. Tell Carrie I'm on my way.
we're getting a ton of chatter on the web.
Max is telling everyone that they have something big.
Mike, you have to stop them
before our files end up on the internet.
we have reason to believe
that your daughter stole classified information.
what information?
Carrie says she doesn't have anything on her.
is there any other way she could've transmitted the information out of the ssc?
even if she pulled the files using a wireless trawler,
she'd have to dump them to a drive.
the congressman's cell phone!
Carrie, she downloaded the files to the congressman's cell phone.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course.
may I see it?
sorry, dad.
Carrie.
Carrie, can you hear me?
something happened.
Billy, Play back the last ten seconds of that phone call.
congressman, do you have your cell?
of course.
may I see it?
that did not sound good.
I'll take that, daddy.
Hey, babby
are we ready to roll?
she's going with us.
Mike,
we lost contact with Carrie.
there was some sort of crash.
there was. Kitt, normal mode.
initiating trasformation
transformation complete
Max tracked the congressman's cell phone.
everybody stay back!
Nikki's gone.
and I think they took Carrie hostage.
Kitt, call an ambulance.
the congressman's down.
they had another car waiting.
we can trace them via the congressman's phone.
no, we can't.
she pulled out the battery.
any sign of Carrie?
Kitt, you picking up anything?
there are no discernable traces
of agent Rivai in the immediate vicinity.
what about these tracks?
I want infrared.
I have analyzed the vehicles on site.
the treads do not match any of their tires.
Kitt's right, they don't match the emergency vehicles or police cars on the scene.
it's possible the tracks are from the getaway car.
the tread is from a goodyear assurance comfort tread.
it's one of the most popular brands of tires
sold and distributed in north america.
of course it is.
great. That narrows it down.
we got something here.
looks like an oil leak.
that's correct, Michael.
is that leak from the getaway car?
based on its viscosity, and level of oxidation,
there is a 93% chance it is.
Kitt, analyze the roads within 100-mile radius
and search for a car with a fluid leak
at the same rate per distance.
there are exactly 47 vehicles within those parameters.
probability is high
that one of them is the vehicle Max is driving.
they should be within striking distance of Nikki and Max.
still narrowing.
there are 23 vehicles
on that stretch of highway that could be a match
for the car Nikki and Max are driving.
got anything, Kitt?
I do not detect our primary targets, nor agent Rivai.
how many of the cars have cell phones?
the signals are from 20 cars.
check the remaining three.
that's right, she dumped the battery.
Kitt, I need to see inside those cars.
accessing satellite imagery.
putting it on-screen now.
got it.
any sign of Rivai?
Kitt, give me heat signatures.
heat signatures on-screen.
she's not moving.
Kitt, is she alive?
come on, Carrie. Move.
we got movement!
Mike, go!
with pleasure.
Ow! That's what I'm talking about!
we can download now.
Houston, we have a problem.
what is it?
she turned on her father's cell.
she must have another battery.
it's uploading our files to the internet.
Billy, run the sweeper program.
not working. Mike, I can't stop the transfer.
Kitt, deploy E.M.P.
it'll stop the car and fry the cell phone.
Michael, at their current speed,
there is a nearly 100% probability
that the electromagnetic pulse will cause the vehicle to flip.
what if we take out a tire?
it will cause an uncontrollable spin
resulting in a cataclysmic crash.
okay, bad idea.
what if we take out both rears at the same time?
causing both rear tires to deflate simultaneously should result in the least dangerous outcome.
unfortunately, I cannot fire two spikes simultaneously.
Kitt, take the wheel.
you take the right, I'll take the left.
on my mark.
if we do not fire at exactly the same moment
I know, Kitt.
two. One.
fire!
their upload's almost complete.
Carrie's safety is your first concern, Mike.
once they complete the transfer,
they won't need her anymore.
come on. Get up.
you have no idea what you're doing.
I could say the same thing about you.
who's your buyer? China?
north korea?
I'm not selling them.
this isn't about some tech war.
it's about telling the truth.
to who?
the American people.
we just uploaded the files to the internet
to expose the lies and hypocrisy of the people you work for.
you don't even know who you work for, do you?
I jammed the transfer,
but ran a mimic program to make it look like it went through.
boy genius does it again.
I'm feeling tingly all over.
get that, Mike?
transfer is complete, baby.
we're good to go.
hate to chat and run.
but we'll be needing your car.
hand over agent rivai first.
what, do you think we're stupid? She's our only bargaining chip.
toss the gun.
drop it!
Kitt, you know what to do.
Yes, Michael.
you're really gonna regret this.
shut up before we shoot you.
Where're the keys?
there are no keys.
agent Rivai, protocol alpha, charlie, beta, seven.
copy that, Kitt.
Hey, the doors are locked.
you okay? Uh huh.
so what have we learned about relationships today, Kitt?
men and women are erratic, unpredictable, and irrational.
I believe I have learned nothing.
no, Kitt, you've learned everything.
predictability takes all the fun out of a relationship.
in addition, I searched the municipal codes of every city in the United States.
there is no such thing as the make out rule.
what?
you told Zoe you can't park in a car at night without making out.
and that it's a rule.
well, it may not be in any database,
but it's a rule.
trust me.
well, it's night,
and you are both in a parked car.
rules are rules.
Really?
Mike and Sarah are approaching.
duck!
Hey. Hey.
hear the news? What?
congress quietly doubled our funding.
huh.
I wonder if that has anything to do with the charges being dropped against Nikki?
and poor max is gonna serve 20 to life.
what a boy won't do for a girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
good-night.
good-night.
busted.
initiating satellite surveillance co-op In three, two, one.
we have satellite surveillance.
who's in the truck?
just stop the bad guys. That's all we know.
he seems nervous.
I can hear you, Billy.
35 seconds to intercept.
ready?
hydraulic systems operating within tolerable limits.
fuel cells at 92%.
shields and defensive weapon systems...
there's times for long answers and times for a short one.
yes or no question, Kitt.
the short answer is I'm ready.
all right. Here we go.
attack mode.
initiating transformation.
transformation complete.
perv
not bad for a newbie.
ten seconds to intercept.
ballsy move.
whose side are you on, mike?
admiring the ballet.
your EMP's ready.
sorry, you tough
you're gonna wanna see this.
on my way.
on my way.
come on, girlie.
electromagnetic pulse fully charged.
hold your fire. I'm taking over.
Kitt's switched to manual. Mike's driving now.
I'm not deaf, Billy.
not your morning, is it?
your EMP will fry The big rig's electronics.
he'll stop in under ten seconds.
FBI's ten miles out. Just zap him and wait for back-up.
EMP will jackknife him. Gotta get his speed under 80.
Kitt, calculations?
michael is right, Dr. Graiman.
at this speed, the truck will jackknife.
damn it, Mike!
you're missing the whole thing, sweet cheeks.
Michael, i'm picking up some unusual readings from inside the truck, and the bikers are prepared to disembark.
deploy the EMP.
FBI, 60 seconds away.
hit infrared.
Michael, something strange is happening inside that truck.
do not approach the truck. wait for back-up.
I'm sorry, Carrie, i can't hear you. the EMP must have jammed my earwig.
can you hear me?
do you copy?
Michale, he's getting away.
that's a '79 shovelhead.
it's got no electronics, so the EMP has no effect.
decontamination complete.
Michale, i want to apologize.
I should have identified the '79 shovelhead sooner.
of course it would be immune to my emp.
it'd be easy to miss.
it's just that Sarah and i used to ride old Harleys back in the day.
I really like the sound of that.
no, not back in the day.
back in the day.
I will take note of the placement of the emphasis in this colloquialism.
look, Kitt, you and i are a team.
sometimes i'm gonna see something you might miss and vice versa.
today, i spotted the Harley.
no big deal.
I got your back. You got mine.
then you're going to omit my error from your report?
it's, uh...
it's what partners do.
they watch out for each other.
if i may attempt a colloquialism of my own...
Thanks, "brosef.
that's the last time you pull a stunt like that. do you understand?
we had a deal.
you run all of this.
I'm in charge of the car.
Sarah, make sure Kitt's okay.
running a complete diagnostic now.
so who was i chasing, motorcycle ninjas?
and what the hell happened in that truck?
the voltage on the emp was set too high. that's all.
then Kitt just killed three men.
why not just tell him the truth?
I'm busy, Charles.
I don't like you blaming Kitt for this. this was not the EMP.
this is the Arrow virus.
arrow has been out of the lab since the army bought him out.
Alex, listen to me.
now, a nano-virus infects technology just like an organic virus infects people.
anything that has a chip in it. a processor of any kind at all.
like televisions, or cell phones, or a computer?
right, and almost everything electronic has some sort of microprocessor in it.
and the virus hones in on that processor and feeds on it.
so instead of spreading through the air via a cough or a sneeze, it spreads through metal.
and if there's no metal, it stops.
right, and it appears to burn itself out if it doesn't have anything metallic to conduct it.
but the truck
now, the truck was surrounded by asphalt and other organic material, so the virus stopped there.
what about the Harley?
it could be a carrier.
but what if it's not even infected?
look, that bike could destroy everything electronic within a 500-mile radius in a matter of hours.
and if it uploads itself through the phones or the power lines, theoretically it could use the internet as a host to create an epidemic.
theoretically.
that damn thing gets online, we will have a worldwide disaster on our hands in a matter of days.
go find that harley, charles.
right.
why'd you pass me a note to meet in the hall?
you're not gonna get weird on me again
act normal.
you act normal.
I know what killed those men in the back of that truck.
it's a virus.
what kind of virus does that? - a nano-virus.
what if mike has it? - No, no.
the virus only infects technology, not people.
okay, that's not possible.
not only is it possible, i think it's spreading.
okay, if it doesn't infect people, why were the bikers in the truck all dead?
because they were wearing chain mail. the virus spreads through metal.
it has properties like acid when it moves. it burned right through their bodies.
how do you know this?
there's rumors that the Pentagon has been developing a tech virus for years.
it's ours?
I think so.
we've gotta tell Torres.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Torres already knows.
but he blamed it on kitt.
it's not cool to blame kitt.
haven't you noticed Torres getting more secretive lately?
I overheard him on the phone the other day.
you mean you eavesdropped?
you have to swear not to say anything to anybody.
who am i gonna tell? - Swear!
okay, i swear.
he was talking about Karr.
karr? - Shh!
come on.
karr doesn't even exist.
that's what they want us to believe.
karr lives.
I don't care what Torres says, it wasn't the EMP.
and i don't wanna just sit here with my thumb up my
so i'm having a threesome tonight with Zoe and Torres.
do you wanna make it four?
okay.
earth to Sarah.
Hello?
Hi.
what happened on that truck...
it's some sort of virus.
I've seen something similar before, but only in a lab.
show us a map of where the truck was hijacked.
???
show all possible escape routes.
now show a radius indicating the maximum distance a '79 shovelhead could travel on one tank of fuel.
one tank?
why couldn't he stop for gas?
assuming the bike's carrying the virus, when he stops, all hells gonna break loose.
Kitt, overlay all gas stations.
your hunch, Kitt. Where's the bike headed?
a hunch is defined as an intuitive reckoning.
I don't do hunches, Michael.
okay, then calculate a probability profile.
that is within my parameters.
there is a 75% chance the motorcycle is headed south on state route 85.
Billy, how did they know the virus was in the truck?
maybe they didn't.
I mean, it's unlikely, but it coulda been a random hijacking.
no, they must have been tipped off.
I have formulated an interactive evolutionary algorithm designed to determine the Harley's initial escape route and subsequent destition.
Billy, monitor all gas stations fanning out 300 miles south of the hijack area.
monitor for what?
you'll know it when you see it.
I believe Sarah's hunch to be right.
whomever is riding that Harley knew exactly where that truck would be and when.
Oh, i see. ?? so it's okay when Sarah has hunches?
Sarah is a genius, Michael.
who authorized Kitt's departure?
I did.
Mike, you know that thing you were talking about that seems impossible?
I think this is probably it.
didn't move that fast before.
whoa, did you see it jump there?
it's mutating.
Mike, are you seeing this?
still think it's an overcranked EMP?
it's a nano-virus.
it infects everything electronic, and it spreads through metal.
Yeah, we know.
the only good news here is that humans appear to be completely immune.
unless you're using a pacemaker, or a titanium hip, or steel plate in your head.
you have to find that Harley.
we're already on it. Intercept in three minutes.
how did you-- - Kitt had a hunch.
I appreciate the credit, Michael. but it wasn't a hunch.
Kitt, make certain your shields are up when you approach the convenience store.
you sure it'll keep him from getting infected?
Yeah, these shields are designed to hermetically seal the entire car, so they'll hold.
I pinged the convenience store's modem.
all it's got is an old dial-up connection.
Mike, you've gotta find the phone line before the virus gets to the Internet.
I suggest you remove your earwig, and your watch, and your cell phone.
Oh, my god! What's happening?
whoa, do you work here? - Uh, yeah.
you got a phone inside? - What?
phone. - No. just that one there.
might wanna hide behind the building.
dude, your car's glowing.
Michael, there is not much time.
dude, your car's talking!
dude, duck.
Kitt, take out the pay phone.
it appears we have overlooked something, Michael.
what's that?
it seems the Harley we are pursuing is spreading the virus but is not affected by it.
shoulda noticed it sooner.
see? now i've got your back, Michael.
okay, partner.
Thanks, brosef.
come on, dad, we both know where this virus came from.
Ryan Arrow's fallen off the planet since he sold out to the defense department.
he was a research assistant. They'll see you.
I think he'd rather see you.
Mike know about you and Ryan?
Mike and i are just friends.
friends? that what they're calling it these days?
dad, eww.
Yeah, Billy?
I think i found your Harley.
I'm on my way.
nice move.
thank you, Michael.
get shields up.
engaging shields.
Yes, Kitt?
there is an access road 200 yards ahead.
you could say i have a hunch he'll take it, diverting to access road.
the shields are interfering with my ability to give chase on this terrain.
drop your shields, Kitt.
but Michael, there is a danger of infection.
???
he's trying to spread it to the power grid.
the virus is spreading.
Kitt, stop. - there is a danger of infection.
now!
arm plasma pulse.
right where you said he'd be.
old habits die hard.
good to see you.
listen, a virus-- - doc.
I know why you're here.
you owe me a dance.
when we broke up
when you broke up with me.
we were supposed to go dancing.
that's why you owe me one.
something different about you.
a confidence.
you look the same.
is that a good thing...
or a bad thing?
it's good.
very good.
try Sarah again.
she is not responding, but Billy has updated me on her mission status.
where is she?
a drinking establishment called "the well.
a bar?
Sarah and Dr. Graiman are attempting to track down a former colleague.
Dr. Ryan Arrow.
gimme a bio on this poindexter.
what is a "poindexter"?
a geek, a nerd, a dweeb.
Ryan Arrow, magna cum laude, Stanford.
ph.d, particle physics, M.I.T. Ph.D, electrical engineering, Cal Tech.
he was Dr. Graiman's research assistant for two years.
concentrating on the theoretical molecular structures of silicon-based nano-organisms.
egghead.
olympic hopeful in the decathlon.
spent one year as a fashion model in Milan.
also, he and Sarah dated for a while two years ago.
I'm searching for exact dates. - never mind the exact dates.
just give me telemetry on Sarah right now.
coming up on screen.
I show unusually high levels of serotonin and adrenaline.
and she appears to be engaged in some sort of physical activity.
Charles Graiman always did love his alternative rock.
your father said something about a nano-virus.
your nano-virus.
it's loose.
first of all, it isn't my virus.
I sold it to the military so they could screw it up like they do everything else.
and second, it's harmless. - no, it's not harmless. It's mutating.
and we need your help.
who's "we"?
working for the man now, aren't you?
Yeah, i heard something about Alex Torres and some secret project.
it's Kitt, isn't it?
I'd tell you, but then i'd have to kill you.
you remember big Sur?
we didn't get out of bed for three days.
you were drunk.
we should never have broken up.
tell you what.
go out with me again.
I'll help you track down the nano-virus.
Ryan, it's not that sim
I'm sorry.
I'm serious.
we could start over.
Hey.
you spilled my drink.
I'sorry. I'll buy you another.
you gonna buy me another shirt too?
someone should.
just tell the bartender, whatever you want.
what i want is for you to keep your little girlie here...
in line.
what did you just say?
girlie. - maybe we should
Sarah's heart rate is extremely high.
she might be in trouble.
go, go, go, go.
I hate it when people call me "girlie.
girlie" was a little ill-conceived.
Oh, hey, mike.
uh, you want a beer?
is everythg okay?
everything's fine.
aimez-vous votre travail?
Oui, c'est tres gratifiant, autant pour les personnes que le travail.
come on. you really went out with "le douche" over here?
how come you never mentioned him?
because you disappeared off the face of the earth for three years, remember?
the whole "i thought you were dead" thing?
okay, good point.
and not that it's any of your business, but i didn't sleep with him last night.
I know.
I sat up all night watching him.
merveilleux.
Kitt, you are marvelous.
merci, Dr. Arrow.
are we just supposed to let anyone talk to the talking car?
it's okay.
Ryan's a friend.
and his responses not just simplistic "yes" or "no," but rich, thoughtful, complex answers.
Kitt's current capabilities go far beyond the original prototype you saw.
well, the detail evident in his chip matrix is spectacular.
the car part's not bad either.
you've done it, Doc.
you created functioning artificial intelligence.
payroll reports.
Ryan Arrow's been on the defense department payroll for the last five years. where did you get this?
from a very hot guy at the Pentagon.
shred 'em when you're done.
get Mike on the chatline.
designed the original virus to clean up toxic waste.
literally eats heavy metals and then craps out harmless organic matter.
not anymore.
that's because they turned it into something else.
something i never intended.
you act like someone stole your baby. you sold it to the military, remember?
you're not a scientist.
you wouldn't understand.
you're right. I have a life.
we need your help.
I have no idea how to stop that virus.
even if i did, why should i?
serves them right.
then we're wasting our time here.
Mike, are you alone?
I'm gonna get ready to go.
go ahead, Carrie.
is Arrow any help?
he says he knows nothing about the virus since he sold out five years ago.
??? then why is he still on the D.O.D. payroll?
must still be working for them.
Kitt, show me blueprints of the house.
Michael, may i ask you a personal question?
shoot.
I've never really seen you act this way before.
are you threated in some way by Dr. Arrow?
you think i'm jealous of Sah and Arrow?
your behavior is consistent with the human emotion called jealousy.
I'm just concerned Dr. Arrow's not telling us the whole truth.
and, yes, i'm jealous. what's this?
there is an additional room beneath the main house.
the entry door is on the deck.
you mean a basement?
it is lead-lined and is too deeply buried for my infrared sensors to penetrate.
sounds like a good place to hide something.
why don't you tell us what you're hiding?
whoa, whoa! - Mike, what is wrong with you?
I think your jarhead boyfriend wants to kick my ass.
first of all, genius, jarhead's a marine. i'm army all the way.
Yeah, well, they only paid me. looks like they branded you.
I don't work for any "they." - yeah, just keep telling yourself that.
I'm not the one still on the government's payroll.
you're still collecting a check.
is this true?
I might be giving up 100 IQ points here, but how come i'm the only one who knows you have a trap door hidden under your rug?
Ryan, what's going on?
why'd you let the virus go?
cause i'm a better scientist than i am a thief.
I screwed the whole thing up.
impressive.
D.I.A. came to me and asked me to mutate my harmless little nano-virus.
Yeah, they just came and took it from you.
they didn't come with guns. They came with a checkbook.
I said yes on the seventh zero.
you all think you're part of this fantastic little egalitarian experiment.
mark my words.
they'll find a way to take it all away from you.
that's why you tried to hijack the big rig.
it was you?
I knew they were transporting the virus.
I tried to take it back.
it's my one chance to put the genie back in the bottle.
but the bottle broke and three men died.
and now it's too late.
Mike, Sarah, Charles, do you copy?
they must be out of range.
Kitt, scan the house.
the house is empty, Mr. Torres.
are you certain?
I am certain.
I detect the presence of the nano-virus and a high-speed internet connection.
it's my recommendation that we take out the virus and the means to spread it now.
agreed.
we take out the compound and let it burn itself out.
I'm proceeding to optimum firing position.
Kitt, load your missiles.
warheads armed.
fire when ready.
there is a way we can synthesize a vaccine.
show me.
missiles fully operational.
Kitt, what are you doing?
all clear.
no, not all clear!
do not fire, Kitt! Do not fire!
Oh, my God! They're in the house!
Kitt, abort, abort! Do not fire!
no, i've gotta get the antivirus!
there's not enough time.
firing two missiles as directed.
how could this have happened?
maybe because they were underground, Kitt couldn't see them and mike couldn't hear Kitt because his ear wig was jammed.
it's still doesn't explain why Kitt fired the missiles after he gave the order to abort.
maybe he caught the virus. Maybe he's sick.
no, i've run a remote scan of all Kitt's systems.
everything comes back normal.
have Sarah and Dr. Graiman run a complete diagnostic.
what are they doing?
their helicopter lands in ten minutes.
Mike will be back with Kitt in under an hour.
you are being uncharacteristically silent, Michael.
I don't feel much like talking today.
would you like to hear some music, partner?
turn it off.
I am sorry, Michael.
what part of "abort, abort" did you not understand?
I've thoroughly examined my memory unit.
I have no record of a transmission from you or the SSC.
you sure you don't have the virus?
run another self-diagnostic.
I have repeated the test several times.
all of my systems are functioning normally.
your screens are out, your lights are flickering, what else could it be?
a short occurred when the missiles were fired.
I'm certain it's nothing serious.
I forget sometimes that you're not a person.
that you're just a machine.
I believe i am feeling what you would call regret for causing Dr. Arrow's death.
you're sorry about what you did.
but you don't have any feelings, Kitt.
only people have feelings.
of course, Michael.
it was just a theory.
decontamination complete.
secondary robot cleared him.
Kitt's okay.
we have to consider decommissioning Kitt.
at least for a while.
is that really necessary, Charles?
you didn't have two missiles fired at you.
doctor?
well, Kitt's primary guiding principle is that he do no harm to people.
and it's built in.
literally hardwired into his core memory.
now this sorta thing should never happen.
I'm afraid something's gone terribly wrong.
do you agree?
Ryan Arrow died for no reason today.
I'll call Washington.
it's the virus.
we're infected.
security bypass.
emergency procedures in effect.
we're infected! Initiate full quarantine!
we gotta contain the virus!
cut all connection to the internet!
it's not responding!
Oh, my god.
we've brought the virus in with us.
it's everywhere.
I can't get him to turn.
help me.
I can't cut our connection to the web.
What?!
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ah!
Oh, come on! I just got that. why
Kitt, how you feeling?
I'm sick, really sick.
is he drivable?
I think so, but it could damage him beyond repair. Why?
another hunch. Get in.
we could spread the virus. - if we don't go, he dies.
strap in.
why did it take so long to infect him?
ultra high-density carbon fiber.
his non-metallic parts protected his metal parts from catching the virus for a long time.
he's fighting me.
Billy, status!
virus has spread to levels three through six.
it's moving much faster now.
it's getting smarter.
it's using kitt's artificial intelligence to replicate itself.
can't be stopped.
Kitt, can you ar me?
Sarah, is that you?
I'm here, Kitt.
you've gotta let Mike drive.
I killed Ryan Arrow.
I am very sorry.
we gotta distract him.
Kitt, can you calculate the vae of pi to its last digit?
come on, you know that's impossible.
pi is an irrational number, which means that it cannot be expressed as a fraction.
I said distract him, not get us killed.
I estimate we lose total control in 15 minutes.
I recommend full evacuation and initiation of the self-destruct sequence.
destroy the SSC and let the virus burn itself.
it's the only way.
it takes two of us.
Billy, begin a complete evacuation.
total sci-fi moment.
three, two, one, mark.
self-destruct sequence commenced.
how did you
this is what Arrow was heading for when Kitt fired the missiles.
the bike's immune, but i don't think it's because it's old.
what the
it's running some sort of antivirus.
can't you use it to immunize Kitt?
you mean like synthesizing a vaccine from the antibody rich blood of a healthy human?
Yeah, that or whatever.
Mike, didn't you ever pay attention in science class?
first, i need root access to the source code, then a detailed schematic, and of course, a nign host in which to transport...
the antidote.
you know, i guess it is possible.
great. Download it.
it's a little ironic, don't you think?
that we end up the architects of our own undoing?
evacuation in progress.
I'm not much for irony, Charles.
I can't. It's encrypted.
all other levels have been evacuated.
we're all that's left.
get outta here, Billy.
it's an order.
three minutes.
ability to reach safe distance may be compromised.
dad, Ryan put an antivirus program into the Harley, but it's password protected.
how strong is the encryption?
512 bit.
even if we had a supercomputer, it would take days to unravel.
if only Kitt were able to-- - that's not an option right now.
what's that sound?
self-destruct.
two minutes to self-destruct.
I did not intend to kill Dr. Arrow.
it wasn't your fault, Kitt.
you were sick.
Michael, Sarah, i am afraid. - it's okay, Kitt.
we're right here with you.
I don't want to die.
we can't wait any longer, Charles.
it's no use!
Ryan could have made the password an infinite number of things.
he could have, but i don't think he did.
good-bye.
he's alive!
of course he's alive.
dad, it worked.
Sarah, we can barely hear you!
say again!
I uploaded the antivirus into the SSC's core operating system.
cancel the destruct sequence.
19 18 - Sarah reversed it.
can you get back in here?
7... - it's not working!
piece of cake.
you don't think Kitt was really feeling emotions, do you?
I'm sure it was just an anomaly brought on by the virus.
I'm sorry about Ryan.
you would have liked him if you'd gotten to know him.
I'm sure i would have.
you gonna be okay?
Yeah, i'll be all right.
what about you, Kitt?
you okay?
core systems fully operable.
tire pressure, comprsion, fuel system, normal.
exoskeleton 99. 72% healed. - he's fine.
let's go home.
Michael, we will be arriving at the exchange point in one minute.
do we have anything?
no heat signatures, nothing on the infrared or penetrating radar either.
you think they're blowing us off?
not if they want their money.
I guess if you're smart enough to kidnap a U. N. Ambassador from a heavily guarded compound, you're smart enough to stick around for your ransom.
all that matters is we get her back in time for the peace negotiations, with a minimum of public exposure.
I don't know why anyone would want to grab her in the first place.
olara kumali is the first diplomat in five years to get her government and the rebels to sit down and talk.
she's the best hope to end a civil war in central africa.
not everyone wants peace.
don't worry, guys.
Kitt and I aren't leaving there without her.
any sign now?
not according to my scanners, michael.
I'm gonna check it out.
Michael, what happens if the kidnappers show up without the ambassador?
then we go to the backup plan.
the backup plan, a plan created because of murphy's law:
whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
but isn't it true that there are an infinite number of ways a plan can go wrong?
that's why backup plans suck.
Kitt, you hear that?
Yes, michael. The sound is coming from under the truck via a third-generation umts handheld device.
Michael, there is an incoming ufo.
where? - Your 11: 00.
what is the backup plan, michael?
follow it.
the object in question is an advanced type of unmanned aerial vehicle, otherwise known as a U. A.V. Or drone.
well, that drone just took our ransom money.
activate missiles.
shooting the drone will incinerate the money and will most likely destroy any evidence that would lead us to ambassador kumali.
lasers, then.
at the drone's altitude, the results will be the same.
at least get a satellite on it.
I have tried, but the craft seems to be equipped with a stealth coating that prevents tracking.
we have to do something.
there is still the phone under the truck.
if you answer it, perhaps I can trace the call.
nice backup plan.
Hello?
man, I thought you were gonna chase that thing all day.
who is this? - Wrong question.
Where's ambassador kumali?
Ding--better.
and by ambassador, you must mean olara, right?
take a peek.
ambassador.
who are you?
ambassador, my name is mike, and I'm coming to get you out of
okay, that--that--that--please.
will you please stop that crap? That's enough, mike, all right?
now, here's the deal.
I'm going to give you an attractive, very influential ambassador, but first, you got to, you know, do a little something for me.
the money wasn't enough?
hell, no. No, the money was just part of the equ N.
now, because you made good on the delivery, olara is alive.
if you keep playing ball, she stays that way.
if you don't, then she's dead.
do we have a deal?
deal. - Great.
now, hang on to that phone and get away from the truck, because I got to, you know, do that little crazy, destroy-the-evidence kind of thing.
excuse me?
run.
Michael, are you all right?
please tell me you traced that call.
I could not.
the caller rerouted his cell signal through more junctions and hubs than I could trace in time.
accordingly, I must agree with your earlier assessment
backup plans suck.
his name is gunnar haas, inmate number 32587, at madras medium-security prison.
and I need him released in an hour.
I don't think that's possible.
Oh, mike, please, will you cut it out?
now, uncle sam trusted you to make the swap today, which means that you have more than enough juice to spring a short-timer like haas.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, good. That's great, because I was gonna have to do some really bad things to olara.
ambassador.
you again.
do you know where you are? - No.
do you know who kidnapped you?
no, I do not, but he is watching me.
he is watching us.
yadda yadda yadda yadda.
just know that I'm gonna do more than watch her if you do not stick with the plan.
now, I'm calling you in an hour, and I need you outside madras prison with gunnar by your side.
and if not...
boy, oh, boy bye-bye.
Billy, I want everything we can find on gunnar haas.
on it.
any luck with the trace?
the signal was triple-encrypted and rerouted twice around the globe through phone companies, server farms, bowling alleys, strip clubs.
whoever this guy is, he's a real joker.
what about the drone?
satellites can't help.
I'm checking kitt's footage to see if we can connect it to a manufacturer.
Where's sarah and charles?
working on a sick robot.
get them.
increase pressure by ten barries.
decrease by ten.
release.
well, I don't know what to say.
the, uh, actuators, and the gears, and the air muscles are all working fine.
Hank, when you dropped the compressor, was it a drop or more of a slip?
dad.
it was definitely intentional.
and when I asked him about it, he wouldn't admit what he'd done.
he's a robot, sarah. He can't lie.
he's acting weird.
it's the ssc. Yeah, well, uh, you go.
I'll finish up. - All right.
keep an eye on him.
okay, big guy, she's gone.
you got something on your mind?
just between us guys?
okay.
well, I'll keep an eye on you for the next few days, And we'll see if there's another incident.
you get back to work, now.
gunnar haas will be at the madras gate in 15 minutes.
sorry.
that was a message from my dad. It's nothing.
when mike gets gunnar, he'll make the swap for the ambassador.
now, if we're lucky, we can still get her to the negotiations by 6: 00.
has billy found out anything more about haas?
well, he's an arms dealer, so he may have something to do with this war the ambassador's dealing with.
still no definite connection.
so we have a political kidnapping that doesn't look political.
I got a bad feeling about this.
all missions have their complications.
Yeah, but if it's just a kidnapping, why this extra step?
Mike's arrived at madras prison.
what do you mean we can't get gunnar haas released?
I mean, we can'T.
Billy, I got kitt jacked into the prison surveillance cameras.
I can see gunnar right there.
according to prison records, gunnar haas is serving a five-year sentence for the sale of contraband weapons.
a charge such as this could easily be commuted, billy.
that's true, unless the cia says no.
CIA? - I guess gunnar ticked off a bunch of people before he got busted.
well, if we're gonna keep the ambassador alive, we need him out in less than 15 minutes.
Yeah, that's why torres said you should get creative.
does that mean what I think it means?
just don't get caught.
you hear something?
what the hell is that?
communication in the prison has been disabled, along with all associated response systems, leaving a population of 87 inmates and ten guards.
Kitt, turbo boost.
get in! - All right!
come in! Come in!
radio to command is dead!
holy - shut up and hold on! Kitt, do it!
well, he didn't get caught.
prison cameras, radio chatter, alarms, witnesses-- I want all of it contained.
doing the sweep now.
Sarah, do we have anything more on that drone?
based on what carrie showed me, the craft looks like some kind of prototype.
no markings anywhere.
get on the line with the department of justice.
and tell them what?
that we're in the middle of a cover operation, and we're handling all this.
- Amazing.
Yeah. - Spectacular.
excuse me.
no. First, you tell me about this car.
Kitt, protocol nancy bravo charlie four.
okay, I got him.
prove it.
happy?
Mike, that's a philosophical question that would take hours to discuss, but I'm glad you got the job done.
Oh, and so is olara.
great. So when do we do the swap?
sorry? What swap?
gunnar haas for the ambassador.
come on, mike.
what, did you really think that I was just using you to get some second-rate arms dealer out of prison?
actually, yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
um, but your day's just begun.
he wants you to get an x-ray machine?
a research-quality micro A. P.S. X-ray machine.
that's high-end.
and we've got, uh, 40 minutes.
Sarah's running a search for the machine with kitt now.
first, he kidnaps an african ambassador.
then he wants to get a hold of some international convict with ties to cia, then some weird piece of equipment.
Yeah.
what's the connection?
I'm working on it.
according to the G. A.O.The nearest A. P.S. X-ray machine is at state university.
think they'll let me borrow it?
no.
micro A. P.S. X-ray machines are incredibly hard to come by.
they're only used for specialized research-- studying the molecular structure of organisms, uh, dating artifacts, penetrating large objects.
how does that have anything to do with an arms dealer?
maybe he's smuggling something.
or trying to prevent something maybe he's planning on smuggling something inside something that's inside something else...
like an illegal turducken.
Mike, did haas say anything to suggest he may have something against the ambassador?
Nope, according to him, he doesn't even know her.
you believe him? - Not really.
it's him.
we'll be listening.
Yeah. - mike.
ambassador, you got the phone?
no.
he wants me to tell you he has cut off my air, and I have less than two hours to live.
don't worry. I'm coming for you, ambassador.
call me...
you're very brave, olara.
that was so nice.
I mean--I mean, maybe a little sappy, but it had some humanity.
still, you need to pick up the pace, or she dies...slowly.
you have some serious psychological problems.
mm, yes, and you work for the government.
I think I know which one's worse.
you know, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were mad at me, hank.
so you didn't intentionally throw that ball?
no?
okay, just gonna let this sweep run on your core A. I. And I'll get back to kitt.
Where's the machine?
the x-ray machine is located in room 312.
and I got 15 minutes to get it from up there to down here.
Sarah, please tell me I don't have to turbo-boost into this place.
don't worry.
we've got something a little more high-tech planned.
how's the disguise working out, michael?
your 3-d generator never ceases to impress.
let's try it on these guys.
as long as you don't tell them I targeted the room's alternating current dispenser, you should be fine.
you mean you unplugged it? - That's right.
I'm here for the x-ray machine.
we just called five minutes ago.
how'd you get here so fast?
dedicated service department.
Mike, the machine you're looking for is about the size of a small refrigerator.
Yep, we treat all our machines like family.
that's the microwave.
I know. I skipped lunch.
you want to find the thing that looks like a telescope.
there it is.
it just stopped working.
why would it do that?
tell him it has something to do with the computerized...
tomographic system and micro-focus.
from what I can tell, the tomographic system got disconnected from the micro-focus.
you can tell just by looking at it?
you can if the tube head is loose from the x-ray generator.
well, it makes sense...
since the x-ray generator came loose from the old tube head here.
isn't that the tube head?
jeez, mike, didn't you pay any attention in science class?
you shut your face.
are you talking to yourself?
say you were testing the machine's resonance.
I'm testing the machine's resonance.
why don't you just open it up and look at it?
what, does this guy want to try fixing this himself?
Hey, you want to try fixing this yourself?
no. - Good.
cause in my opinion, this whole thing needs to come back to our lab.
for how long?
depends.
the sooner I can take it, the sooner you can get back to your...
bone.
Thanks.
nice work, mike. You too, kitt.
you are both welcome.
we'll be on our way in just a few more steps.
open the door, kitt!
hurry, michael.
Kitt, open the door now!
Michael, with the taser barbs removed, you should be feeling better.
I'll feel better when we have olara.
yeah?
say you got it.
I did.
Oh, man.
I do not know which agency you work for, mike, but I gotta tell you, man.
they gote yo givu a raise.
just tell me how many more of these random jobs I'm gonna have to do.
nothing that you are doing for me is random.
do you understand?
see, now, look. See right there?
there's a navigator driving beside you.
friends of yours?
now all you have to do, wiseass, is just know that they are people that I do business with, okay?
and now you do too.
now up ahead is an amusement park. Do you see?
okay.
now pull over into the lot, and what I want you to do is,
I want you to give mr. Haas to the people in that vehicle.
and in return, they are going to give you a little box.
do you get it? - Sure.
a convict, an x-ray machine, and a box at an amusement park.
Yeah, it all makes perfect sense.
no, it doesn'T.
you checking the car's plates? - Working on it.
what about fallout from the university?
smoothing things over with the dean as we speak.
anything on the x-ray machine?
still nothing to suggest e why thkidnapper or gunnar haas would want it.
what about ivana alexandrov?
she's the registered owner of the navigator.
what do we know about her?
according to the state department, she's a businesswoman.
according to the nsa, she's S. V.R. According to me, she's hot.
russian secret service.
cross reference her with the ambassador and gunnar haas.
there has to be a match.
what the hell has he gotten us into?
look, now stop!
Hank, stop it!
okay, look, you've given me no choice.
Oh, hank.
what is this?
this is where you get out.
Oh, no. Not them.
it's three girls. What's the problem?
we had a slight misunderstanding during a business transaction.
Hello, gunnar.
dude.
come on.
nice job for one man.
Thanks.
now give him to us.
first give me the box.
be glad we are giving you your life.
a little help, kitt.
lethal or non-lethal?
non-lethal.
accessing micro-darts.
last chance.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
thank you, kitt.
have carrie get an fbi team over here to clean this up.
Yes, michael.
you should be aware that the aircraft has returned.
aircraft?
the drone. It is directly overhead.
I hate this guy.
this guy's name is christopher stevens.
I cross-referenced cia, fbi, and homeland security databases.
he's the one guy connected to ambassador kumali, gunnar haas, and ivana alexandrov.
how? - He was a weapons designer for the pentagon.
you know him? - I know of him.
well, according to this, he was suspected of selling secrets to russia.
he was put on trial, and it was stopped when three key U. N. Witnesses disappeared.
so he was just let go?
his research was confiscated. His project was scrapped.
it was a self-targeting, low-orbiting laser.
it didn't have anything to do with x-rays.
still, no one kept tabs on him.
I'm sure they've tried.
he's a smart guy.
if he has come back, it can't be good.
come on, call already.
Michael, please exit the vehicle.
exposure to an excess of 1, 000 rads can result in human fatality in
in english! - The package you are carrying?
it's radioactive.
Kitt, activate hazmat.
hazardous materials storage container opening.
exposure limited to below serious.
stand by for decontamination.
- Stand by for decontamination.
contamination removed.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
he's having me pick up uranium?
actually, the material in the box is not uranium.
it's hafnium.
what? - Atomic number 72.
hafnium is a ductile metal with a high neutron-capture cross-section.
given today's events, it is interesting that hafnium can be made to release a bomb-like charge when struck with a specific waveform.
X-rays?- Correct.
what's more, the size of the resulting blast would be approximately ten miles in diameter per hafnium gram.
your box contains three grams.
wow, you are good.
you're having me build a bomb?
no, I'm having you collect pieces so I can build a bomb.
not if I hang on to what I have.
way to drop your purse and get into the game, mikey.
Yeah, sure, you can keep everything.
but then I'd keep this.
I mean, look at her.
smart, kind.
and the only thing that's keeping her alive is you, mike.
and that's exactly why you're gonna bring everything in your car over to the hesperia sugar mill.
a sugar mill. - Yeah, a sugar mill which is exactly 20 minutes away from you.
which is exactly the amount of time that olara has left to breathe.
I'm sure you have gps in your car, am I right?
hmm, you have no idea.
great. Get going.
I noticed that this went missing from my files a little while back, but I never thought it would be because one of my robots took it.
Hank, I know I haven't been spending as much time with you as I used to, and it must be kinda frustrating to be in here all by yourself while katie and lisa are with kitt.
that doesn't mean you can throw things whenever you want.
well, I'll tell you what.
there's a work space in the ssc which needs filling.
are you interested?
okay, good.
you start tomorrow.
dad.
we have a situation.
you can't be serious.
I'm not letting olara die.
you can't deliver a hafnium bomb to a man like stevens.
he's right, mike. Going into this blind is too big a risk.
so is letting him get away, and that's exactly what's gonna happen if I don't show up.
don't be so sure.
this is the hesperia sugar mill.
it's been abandoned, and from all our data, it's where christopher stevens is and ambassador kumali as well.
Sarah and charles just ran an analysis on the drone.
they're pretty sure this is where the controlling transmission comes from.
also, ambient sound tests on the phone calls from stevens and the ambassador match, suggesting they're in the same place.
plus there's this.
what is that? - an electromagnetic shield.
every scan we've run on this place, heat, infrared, radar, sonar, gets blocked around this warehouse.
and why go through all that trouble unless you're hiding something important?
exactly.
now stevens is expecting you here in about ten minutes.
the thing is, people can get irrational as they're close to finally getting what they want.
if there were ever a time when stevens would let down his guard, this is it.
Carrie, I want you and a team out there asap.
on my way. - Zoe, keep tabs on that drone.
Billy, help sarah and charles figure out a way to penetrate that shield.
Mike's going in.
we need to give him all the cover we can.
Michael, we will be in range in less than a minute.
we'll most likely lose contact as soon as you enter the property.
got it. You ready? - Yes.
still, due to the nature of your plan, I am compelled to ask.
what happens if the elements do not come together as you've predicted?
then we go to the backup plan.
I thought we concluded that backup plans are ineffective.
that's why we better get this right. On my mark.
three, two, one...now!
he's not responding.
he must be under the shield. - Can we get an image into the warehouse?
not yet.
Kitt, we've lost contact with mike.
we're probably gonna lose contact with you.
you need to hold on until carrie gets there.
I understand, Dr. Graiman.
Dr. Graiman
we've lost them both.
my man.
so nice to see you.
sort of.
now I want you to follow us into this warehouse.
then you're gonna stop your car, and then you're gonna get out. You understand?
talkative guy. Follow me.
nice mood lighting.
deal or no deal?
no deal.
get stevens.
I wouldn't do that.
the sooner you do, the sooner he'll know I kicked your ass.
okay, time to get out.
Dr. Graiman?
time to get out.
Oh, come on, mike. Really?
I mean, if you don't wanna get out, then you don't get olara.
you get it?
okay, mike. This just stopped being funny.
open the door.
open the-- all right. What am I, talking to myself?
okay, that's it.
you don't wanna get out of the car? I'm bringing her out right now.
I'm gonna put a bullet in her - Hang on, pal.
say what? - Hang on, pal.
hang on, pal?
I said,"hang on, pal.
you said--nobody says,"hang on, pal" to me!
when was the last time you heard from the others?
talking car?
nice.
Oh, I gotta tell you, mike.
while I do not like your deception, I do respect your tenacity.
now open the door and give me my stuff.
don't. He is a terrorist. - Oh, yeah, I'm a terrorist.
good call.
all right, we're gonna do it a different way.
if you don't give me my stuff, I'm gonna pop her.
open the doors and trunk.
a voice-activated talking car.
right on. You guys know what to do.
Hafnium's in the trunk.
machine's in the back.
that's so rad.
who's it for? - You mean the bomb?
Oh, well, that's the great part about this whole thing, mike.
it's really funny.
um, the bomb... is...for... you.
okay, so here's how it's gonna go.
while I hang on to olara, you are going to get into this car now and gun it to 100 miles per hour.
now from that point on, you keep it at 100, 105, and then you just stay on that road heading north.
why 100?
Oh, this is really funny. Actually, I was gonna say 60.
but then I just saw this car, dude.
you know, and I was like,"you gotta take advantage of the peed, you know?
Oh, and by the way, if you deviate off-course, I'll know from the bomb's gps, and then olara dies, and hello, genocide.
you are insane.
Yes, I know, but it gets better. Just you wait.
um, so if you go below 100 miles per hour, then the bomb automatically explodes.
got it? Good. Go.
you'll never get away with this.
do they teach you guys to say that somewhere?
12 seconds.
Mike, go.
please.
I'll find you.
you too.
Yeah. Uh, buckle up safely.
nine seconds.
Carrie's about to get there, mike. What's going on?
Stevens has olara, kitt has a bomb in his trunk, and I have to stay above 100 or everything blows up.
there's no one in here.
I got something.
No!
to BE CONINUED
Michael, we will be arriving at the exchange point in one minute.
do we have anything?
no heat signatures, nothing on the infrared or penetrating radar either.

now, hang on to that phone and get away from the truck, because I got to, you know, do that little crazy, destroy-the-evidence kind of thing.
excuse me?
run.
Michael, are you all right?
please tell me you traced that call.
I could not.
the caller rerouted his cell signal through more junctions and hubs than I could trace in time.
accordingly, I must agree with your earlier assessment
backup plans suck.
his name is gunnar haas, inmate number 32587, at madras medium-security prison.
and I need him released in an hour.
I don't think that's possible.
Oh, mike, please, will you cut it out?
now, uncle sam trusted you to make the swap today, which means that you have more than enough juice to spring a short-timer like haas.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, good. That's great, because I was gonna have to do some really bad things to olara.
ambassador.
you again.
do you know where you are? - No.
do you know who kidnapped you?
no, I do not, but he is watching me.
he is watching us.
yadda yadda yadda yadda.
just know that I'm gonna do more than watch her if you do not stick with the plan.
now, I'm calling you in an hour, and I need you outside madras prison with gunnar by your side.
and if not...
boy, oh, boy bye-bye.
Billy, I want everything we can find on gunnar haas.
on it.
any luck with the trace?
the signal was triple-encrypted and rerouted twice around the globe through phone companies, server farms, bowling alleys, strip clubs.
whoever this guy is, he's a real joker.
what about the drone?
satellites can't help.
I'm checking kitt's footage to see if we can connect it to a manufacturer.
Where's sarah and charles?
working on a sick robot.
get them.
increase pressure by ten barries.
decrease by ten.
release.
well, I don't know what to say.
the, uh, actuators, and the gears, and the air muscles are all working fine.
Hank, when you dropped the compressor, was it a drop or more of a slip?
dad.
it was definitely intentional.
and when I asked him about it, he wouldn't admit what he'd done.
he's a robot, sarah. He can't lie.
he's acting weird.
it's the ssc. Yeah, well, uh, you go.
I'll finish up. - All right.
keep an eye on him.
okay, big guy, she's gone.
you got something on your mind?
just between us guys?
okay.
well, I'll keep an eye on you for the next few days, And we'll see if there's another incident.
you get back to work, now.
gunnar haas will be at the madras gate in 15 minutes.
sorry.
that was a message from my dad. It's nothing.
when mike gets gunnar, he'll make the swap for the ambassador.
now, if we're lucky, we can still get her to the negotiations by 6: 00.
has billy found out anything more about haas?
well, he's an arms dealer, so he may have something to do with this war the ambassador's dealing with.
still no definite connection.
so we have a political kidnapping that doesn't look political.
I got a bad feeling about this.
all missions have their complications.
Yeah, but if it's just a kidnapping, why this extra step?
Mike's arrived at madras prison.
what do you mean we can't get gunnar haas released?
I mean, we can'T.
Billy, I got kitt jacked into the prison surveillance cameras.
I can see gunnar right there.
according to prison records, gunnar haas is serving a five-year sentence for the sale of contraband weapons.
a charge such as this could easily be commuted, billy.
that's true, unless the cia says no.
CIA? - I guess gunnar ticked off a bunch of people before he got busted.
well, if we're gonna keep the ambassador alive, we need him out in less than 15 minutes.
Yeah, that's why torres said you should get creative.
does that mean what I think it means?
just don't get caught.
you hear something?
what the hell is that?
communication in the prison has been disabled, along with all associated response systems, leaving a population of 87 inmates and ten guards.
Kitt, turbo boost.
get in! - All right!
come in! Come in!
radio to command is dead!
holy - shut up and hold on! Kitt, do it!
well, he didn't get caught.
prison cameras, radio chatter, alarms, witnesses-- I want all of it contained.
doing the sweep now.
Sarah, do we have anything more on that drone?
based on what carrie showed me, the craft looks like some kind of prototype.
no markings anywhere.
get on the line with the department of justice.
and tell them what?
that we're in the middle of a cover operation, and we're handling all this.
- Amazing.
Yeah. - Spectacular.
excuse me.
no. First, you tell me about this car.
Kitt, protocol nancy bravo charlie four.
okay, I got him.
prove it.
happy?
Mike, that's a philosophical question that would take hours to discuss, but I'm glad you got the job done.
Oh, and so is olara.
great. So when do we do the swap?
sorry? What swap?
gunnar haas for the ambassador.
come on, mike.
what, did you really think that I was just using you to get some second-rate arms dealer out of prison?
actually, yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
um, but your day's just begun.
he wants you to get an x-ray machine?
a research-quality micro A. P.S. X-ray machine.
that's high-end.
and we've got, uh, 40 minutes.
Sarah's running a search for the machine with kitt now.
first, he kidnaps an african ambassador.
then he wants to get a hold of some international convict with ties to cia, then some weird piece of equipment.
Yeah.
what's the connection?
I'm working on it.
according to the G. A.O.The nearest A. P.S. X-ray machine is at state university.
think they'll let me borrow it?
no.
micro A. P.S. X-ray machines are incredibly hard to come by.
they're only used for specialized research-- studying the molecular structure of organisms, uh, dating artifacts, penetrating large objects.
how does that have anything to do with an arms dealer?
maybe he's smuggling something.
or trying to prevent something maybe he's planning on smuggling something inside something that's inside something else...
like an illegal turducken.
Mike, did haas say anything to suggest he may have something against the ambassador?
Nope, according to him, he doesn't even know her.
you believe him? - Not really.
it's him.
we'll be listening.
Yeah. - mike.
ambassador, you got the phone?
no.
he wants me to tell you he has cut off my air, and I have less than two hours to live.
don't worry. I'm coming for you, ambassador.
call me...
you're very brave, olara.
that was so nice.
I mean--I mean, maybe a little sappy, but it had some humanity.
still, you need to pick up the pace, or she dies...slowly.
you have some serious psychological problems.
mm, yes, and you work for the government.
I think I know which one's worse.
you know, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were mad at me, hank.
so you didn't intentionally throw that ball?
no?
okay, just gonna let this sweep run on your core A. I. And I'll get back to kitt.
Where's the machine?
the x-ray machine is located in room 312.
and I got 15 minutes to get it from up there to down here.
Sarah, please tell me I don't have to turbo-boost into this place.
don't worry.
we've got something a little more high-tech planned.
how's the disguise working out, michael?
your 3-d generator never ceases to impress.
let's try it on these guys.
as long as you don't tell them I targeted the room's alternating current dispenser, you should be fine.
you mean you unplugged it? - That's right.
I'm here for the x-ray machine.
we just called five minutes ago.
how'd you get here so fast?
dedicated service department.
Mike, the machine you're looking for is about the size of a small refrigerator.
Yep, we treat all our machines like family.
that's the microwave.
I know. I skipped lunch.
you want to find the thing that looks like a telescope.
there it is.
it just stopped working.
why would it do that?
tell him it has something to do with the computerized...
tomographic system and micro-focus.
from what I can tell, the tomographic system got disconnected from the micro-focus.
you can tell just by looking at it?
you can if the tube head is loose from the x-ray generator.
well, it makes sense...
since the x-ray generator came loose from the old tube head here.
isn't that the tube head?
jeez, mike, didn't you pay any attention in science class?
you shut your face.
are you talking to yourself?
say you were testing the machine's resonance.
I'm testing the machine's resonance.
why don't you just open it up and look at it?
what, does this guy want to try fixing this himself?
Hey, you want to try fixing this yourself?
no. - Good.
cause in my opinion, this whole thing needs to come back to our lab.
for how long?
depends.
the sooner I can take it, the sooner you can get back to your...
bone.
Thanks.
nice work, mike. You too, kitt.
you are both welcome.
we'll be on our way in just a few more steps.
open the door, kitt!
hurry, michael.
Kitt, open the door now!
Michael, with the taser barbs removed, you should be feeling better.
I'll feel better when we have olara.
yeah?
say you got it.
I did.
Oh, man.
I do not know which agency you work for, mike, but I gotta tell you, man.
they gote yo givu a raise.
just tell me how many more of these random jobs I'm gonna have to do.
nothing that you are doing for me is random.
do you understand?
see, now, look. See right there?
there's a navigator driving beside you.
friends of yours?
now all you have to do, wiseass, is just know that they are people that I do business with, okay?
and now you do too.
now up ahead is an amusement park. Do you see?
okay.
now pull over into the lot, and what I want you to do is,
I want you to give mr. Haas to the people in that vehicle.
and in return, they are going to give you a little box.
do you get it? - Sure.
a convict, an x-ray machine, and a box at an amusement park.
Yeah, it all makes perfect sense.
no, it doesn'T.
you checking the car's plates? - Working on it.
what about fallout from the university?
smoothing things over with the dean as we speak.
anything on the x-ray machine?
still nothing to suggest e why thkidnapper or gunnar haas would want it.
what about ivana alexandrov?
she's the registered owner of the navigator.
what do we know about her?
according to the state department, she's a businesswoman.
according to the nsa, she's S. V.R. According to me, she's hot.
russian secret service.
cross reference her with the ambassador and gunnar haas.
there has to be a match.
what the hell has he gotten us into?
look, now stop!
Hank, stop it!
okay, look, you've given me no choice.
Oh, hank.
what is this?
this is where you get out.
Oh, no. Not them.
it's three girls. What's the problem?
we had a slight misunderstanding during a business transaction.
Hello, gunnar.
dude.
come on.
nice job for one man.
Thanks.
now give him to us.
first give me the box.
be glad we are giving you your life.
a little help, kitt.
lethal or non-lethal?
non-lethal.
accessing micro-darts.
last chance.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
thank you, kitt.
have carrie get an fbi team over here to clean this up.
Yes, michael.
you should be aware that the aircraft has returned.
aircraft?
the drone. It is directly overhead.
I hate this guy.
this guy's name is christopher stevens.
I cross-referenced cia, fbi, and homeland security databases.
he's the one guy connected to ambassador kumali, gunnar haas, and ivana alexandrov.
how? - He was a weapons designer for the pentagon.
you know him? - I know of him.
well, according to this, he was suspected of selling secrets to russia.
he was put on trial, and it was stopped when three key U. N. Witnesses disappeared.
so he was just let go?
his research was confiscated. His project was scrapped.
it was a self-targeting, low-orbiting laser.
it didn't have anything to do with x-rays.
still, no one kept tabs on him.
I'm sure they've tried.
he's a smart guy.
if he has come back, it can't be good.
come on, call already.
Michael, please exit the vehicle.
exposure to an excess of 1, 000 rads can result in human fatality in
in english! - The package you are carrying?
it's radioactive.
Kitt, activate hazmat.
hazardous materials storage container opening.
exposure limited to below serious.
stand by for decontamination.
- Stand by for decontamination.
contamination removed.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
he's having me pick up uranium?
actually, the material in the box is not uranium.
it's hafnium.
what? - Atomic number 72.
hafnium is a ductile metal with a high neutron-capture cross-section.
given today's events, it is interesting that hafnium can be made to release a bomb-like charge when struck with a specific waveform.
X-rays?- Correct.
what's more, the size of the resulting blast would be approximately ten miles in diameter per hafnium gram.
your box contains three grams.
wow, you are good.
you're having me build a bomb?
no, I'm having you collect pieces so I can build a bomb.
not if I hang on to what I have.
way to drop your purse and get into the game, mikey.
Yeah, sure, you can keep everything.
but then I'd keep this.
I mean, look at her.
smart, kind.
and the only thing that's keeping her alive is you, mike.
and that's exactly why you're gonna bring everything in your car over to the hesperia sugar mill.
a sugar mill. - Yeah, a sugar mill which is exactly 20 minutes away from you.
which is exactly the amount of time that olara has left to breathe.
I'm sure you have gps in your car, am I right?
hmm, you have no idea.
great. Get going.
I noticed that this went missing from my files a little while back, but I never thought it would be because one of my robots took it.
Hank, I know I haven't been spending as much time with you as I used to, and it must be kinda frustrating to be in here all by yourself while katie and lisa are with kitt.
that doesn't mean you can throw things whenever you want.
well, I'll tell you what.
there's a work space in the ssc which needs filling.
are you interested?
okay, good.
you start tomorrow.
dad.
we have a situation.
you can't be serious.
I'm not letting olara die.
you can't deliver a hafnium bomb to a man like stevens.
he's right, mike. Going into this blind is too big a risk.
so is letting him get away, and that's exactly what's gonna happen if I don't show up.
don't be so sure.
this is the hesperia sugar mill.
it's been abandoned, and from all our data, it's where christopher stevens is and ambassador kumali as well.
Sarah and charles just ran an analysis on the drone.
they're pretty sure this is where the controlling transmission comes from.
also, ambient sound tests on the phone calls from stevens and the ambassador match, suggesting they're in the same place.
plus there's this.
what is that? - an electromagnetic shield.
every scan we've run on this place, heat, infrared, radar, sonar, gets blocked around this warehouse.
and why go through all that trouble unless you're hiding something important?
exactly.
now stevens is expecting you here in about ten minutes.
the thing is, people can get irrational as they're close to finally getting what they want.
if there were ever a time when stevens would let down his guard, this is it.
Carrie, I want you and a team out there asap.
on my way. - Zoe, keep tabs on that drone.
Billy, help sarah and charles figure out a way to penetrate that shield.
Mike's going in.
we need to give him all the cover we can.
Michael, we will be in range in less than a minute.
we'll most likely lose contact as soon as you enter the property.
got it. You ready? - Yes.
still, due to the nature of your plan, I am compelled to ask.
what happens if the elements do not come together as you've predicted?
then we go to the backup plan.
I thought we concluded that backup plans are ineffective.
that's why we better get this right. On my mark.
three, two, one...now!
he's not responding.
he must be under the shield. - Can we get an image into the warehouse?
not yet.
Kitt, we've lost contact with mike.
we're probably gonna lose contact with you.
you need to hold on until carrie gets there.
I understand, Dr. Graiman.
Dr. Graiman
we've lost them both.
my man.
so nice to see you.
sort of.
now I want you to follow us into this warehouse.
then you're gonna stop your car, and then you're gonna get out. You understand?
talkative guy. Follow me.
nice mood lighting.
deal or no deal?
no deal.
get stevens.
I wouldn't do that.
the sooner you do, the sooner he'll know I kicked your ass.
okay, time to get out.
Dr. Graiman?
time to get out.
Oh, come on, mike. Really?
I mean, if you don't wanna get out, then you don't get olara.
you get it?
okay, mike. This just stopped being funny.
open the door.
open the-- all right. What am I, talking to myself?
okay, that's it.
you don't wanna get out of the car? I'm bringing her out right now.
I'm gonna put a bullet in her - Hang on, pal.
say what? - Hang on, pal.
hang on, pal?
I said,"hang on, pal.
you said--nobody says,"hang on, pal" to me!
when was the last time you heard from the others?
talking car?
nice.
Oh, I gotta tell you, mike.
while I do not like your deception, I do respect your tenacity.
now open the door and give me my stuff.
don't. He is a terrorist. - Oh, yeah, I'm a terrorist.
good call.
all right, we're gonna do it a different way.
if you don't give me my stuff, I'm gonna pop her.
open the doors and trunk.
a voice-activated talking car.
right on. You guys know what to do.
Hafnium's in the trunk.
machine's in the back.
that's so rad.
who's it for? - You mean the bomb?
Oh, well, that's the great part about this whole thing, mike.
it's really funny.
um, the bomb... is...for... you.
okay, so here's how it's gonna go.
while I hang on to olara, you are going to get into this car now and gun it to 100 miles per hour.
now from that point on, you keep it at 100, 105, and then you just stay on that road heading north.
why 100?
Oh, this is really funny. Actually, I was gonna say 60.
but then I just saw this car, dude.
you know, and I was like,"you gotta take advantage of the peed, you know?
Oh, and by the way, if you deviate off-course, I'll know from the bomb's gps, and then olara dies, and hello, genocide.
you are insane.
Yes, I know, but it gets better. Just you wait.
um, so if you go below 100 miles per hour, then the bomb automatically explodes.
got it? Good. Go.
you'll never get away with this.
do they teach you guys to say that somewhere?
12 seconds.
Mike, go.
please.
I'll find you.
you too.
Yeah. Uh, buckle up safely.
nine seconds.
Carrie's about to get there, mike. What's going on?
Stevens has olara, kitt has a bomb in his trunk, and I have to stay above 100 or everything blows up.
there's no one in here.
I got something.
No!
to BE CONINUED
what the hell is wrong with you, private?!
princess, you'd better not be laughing at me!
are you laughing?!
you got your panties in a bunch?!
you got an answer for me, princess?
you think this is funny?
you think this is a game?
Michael, how much longer must we watch this?
I'm sorry, Kitt, it's the only footage Annie had of the guy.
army news video of Sgt.Jack Burber, "the meanest drill sergeant west of the Mississippi, in training."
Yep.
what, exactly, is he training people in?
the usual-- shooting, fighting...
breaking the human spirit.
I thought you said the human spirit couldn't be broken.
doesn't stop people from trying.
Mike, you're still not there?
I am 15 minutes away.
you guys find out any more about Sgt. Burber's death?
only what was in the local paper.
small town. Army vet. Overdose.
then the story goes away.
you think Annie is overreacting?
Annie Ortiz kept my company's blackhawks running
during two weeks of heavy fire
and did not lose her cool once.
if she says there's something off
about her d.i.'s death,
it's worth looking into.
even if it is this guy. - We're on it.
Oh, I like the sexy librarian look.
are you laughing?!
you think this is some kinda game?!
okay, we'll play a game then!
all of you on your face and give me 20,
you bunch of ignorant, miserable, worthless bags of should be fun.
just so you know, I tried to handle this solo before putting the call out.
the lawman here is an idiot.
for starters, death by overdose?
Sarge didn't do drugs.
you did say he was having a rough time, though.
Yeah, you would too
if you had just risked your butt for your country,
then got out and found no one gave a crap.
look, maybe it was harder on him than most,
but he was getting it together.
how do you know?
for the past six months
I've been loaning him cash
pretty regularly.
then last week he says not to worry,
he was "onto something" out here.
two days later I get a call
from this idiot sheriff
who says sarge od'd,
and I'm the only contact on record.
did you see the body?
hospital rules.
he's got no blood relatives,
so I gotta wait a week.
I'm really glad you can help.
I'll see what I can do.
great.
Mike...
despite Annie's feelings, the chance of a veteran
dying from an overdose is surprisingly high.
according to government data, one in eight soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan
suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
and over 12, 000 veterans attempted suicide last year alone.
maybe so.
still, Annie's asked, so we gotta check it out.
the database and the county hospital and clinic indicates
Sgt.Burber's body is in examination room three.
I have uncovered the name of another deceased individual who is also being held here,
and I'm providing appropriate i.d.
Kevin Lee?
son of Peter Lee, recently expired of natural causes.
let's go see dad.
death does change a man.
just the other day, he and I were laughing over a pu-pu platter, and now...
can I get a moment here?
all right, wise guy, I'm in.
hospital data has Sgt. Burber's body awaiting
an autopsy in a body bag that should be evident.
got it. Unh.
Hey, Sarge.
you look different in person.
nicer.
Michael?
jeez, Kitt!
it occurs to me you have limited experience in forensic science,
so you will need assistance in examining the body.
what do you mean "examining"?
Sgt. Burber's time of death is listed as 11: 00 p. m. Friday
with overdose as the cause.
Annie has said she feels this assessment is lacking.
therefore, another examination is needed.
uh, what would I have to do?
the reports suggest Sgt. Burber
may have died from secobarbital poisoning.
look at the sergeant's lips.
do they appear redder than normal?
Yeah.
he's got a pretty nasty bruise on his jaw.
the sheriff's report also suggests
that Sgt. Burber's body was bruised during transportation from the roadside where he was found.
this, however, is a problem.
Why?
bodies do not bruise after death.
looks like there's something on his shirt?
sawdust.
and down by his neck is a really big, nasty mark.
that suggests asphyxia.
we need to check for petechial hemorrhaging.
okay.
lift the sergeant's eyelids and closely examine
the conjunctiva of the eyes.
dude, I'm not doing that. - Michael...
it's dead eyeballs.
then you can be assured they won't bite.
look for red dots on the gelatinous outer rim of the eye, and within the sergeant's eyelid.
Hey, yeah, I see them.
he's got the dots.
that means Annie was right.
the sarge didn't o.d.
that is correct, Michael.
Sgt. Burber was murdered.
you discovered he was murdered,
and tampered with the body?
well, not in that order.
and anyway, I barely touched him.
after lying to a hospital employee
and impersonating a dead Samoan's son.
come on, Sarah,
next you're gonna say
I shouldn't have taken his personal effects.
you took his personal effects?
well, I wasn't gonna go through them there.
great, now going to the police is definitely out.
no problem--all we need is to find out
who had motive, means,
and opportunity.
we do that, we have our killer.
impressive, Sherlock.
please.
Matlock.
motive, means and opportunity, huh?
okay, that's what I'll ask the sheriff.
no, Mike, I said we can't go to the police.
Oh, I'm not. They're coming to me.
first some army girl tries to tell me
how to run my investigation.
and then you.
I didn't mess with it, sir.
just looking out for one of my own.
that isn't your job.
what about when the job calls murder or suicide?
that was a preliminary assessment.
I haven't had time to get into the details.
okay, I get it. You're overworked.
probably the one guy
who has to handle the whole county.
it must give you a lot of stress?! Yeah.
you got no idea. so maybe I can help.
or maybe I can just arrest you.
you could do that.
but like you said,
I'm not the first to look into this.
and if you put me away, I won't be the last.
attention all county units,
bank robbery in progress at rancher's national bank.
cutter responding.
you mess with any of this?
I haven't even broken the seal, sir.
if I find anything's missing...
I will be at the hotel in town.
I'll throw your ass in jail.
now get!
I think he likes me.
rancher's bank?
the bank is on the other side of the county,
which gives us an hour before the sheriff realizes my report was erroneous.
great. So what'd you find?
find? Come on, super car.
I put the bag of the sarge's stuff on your hood.
you have surface tech there.
and I wanted it to be a surprise.
the items in Sgt. Burber's personal effects include American coins and currency,
a watch, the sergeant's i.d.
and a matchbook from newcomb's ranch bar,
which seems to contain flecks of sawdust.
like the sawdust on sarge's shirt in the morgue.
exactly.
newcomb's ranch sounds like it might be nearby.
it is. That's why we're driving there now.
okay. beautiful.
the newcomb's ranch bar doesn't have anything unusual on its business records, Mike.
no report of criminal activity, either,
though the place did get a new owner last year.
anything on your end?
just that this bar's a frikkin' long way out of town.
Michael, the newcomb's ranch bar is just up ahead.
Thanks.
my scanners have identified nothing unusual on the main floor.
but the basement is radiating far more electricity than one would predict from a bar.
any way to get a picture of what's down there?
it will take some time to penetrate the substructure,
but I will try.
and so will I.
you lost?
looking for a beer.
we don't get a lot of that out here.
this...Is a bar, isn't it?
it's for locals,
and you and I have never met.
Uh...Mike.
Constance.
Oh, that's a nice tat. Army?
good eye.
Yeah, well, I got a thing for men in uniform.
you in or out?
out.
uh, left ordnance at Fort Carson two weeks ago,
and, you know, here I am.
ordnance, huh?
you miss the 75th?
it's the 76th, actually.
and no, I'm just happy to be here.
Michael, according to Billy's latest update,
Constance savage is the new owner of the bar.
after all, I heard this is where I'd find
the best-looking bartender in the state.
she not only runs the place, she owns it.
what else have you heard?
I should ask what's downstairs.
well, why don't you follow me and find out?
Hey. do it.
that's enough!
what the hell is this?!
call it a test.
don't worry, you passed.
still wanna see my downstairs?
how could I say no?
ty!
I got another one for you.
Hey, you think you can do this?
what is this?
it's Fight Night!
Yeah!
get up!
Michael, I have just accessed the lower level via their closed-circuit system.
it's about time.
actually, my processing speed was quite impressive.
do you think this place might be connected to Sgt. Burber's death?
I think it was where he was killed.
Yeah!
from what we can tell, Fight Night is controlled by a self-styled promoter and vet named Ty Mckelver.
it's also one of the fastest-growing internet sites on the web.
so it's like boxing?
it's more hardcore than boxing.
every night they live-stream at least three bouts.
no rules, no refs.
most of the fighters are vets.
winner gets three grand, cash. loser goes home.
that's a lot to put yourself through for three grand.
not for these guys.
most are hard cases,
desperate for anything they can get.
I'd be desperate too up against that.
that is "monster" Molina,
fight Night's reigning champ,
and the most horrifying thing I've seen on the web since Mini - Me uncut.
okay, can't you guys just call in the cavalry?
not yet.
busting these guys won't get us any closer
to finding out what happened to the sarge.
you're sure he was there?
from what I saw at the hospital and the club, yeah.
think you can find a witness?
good luck with this crowd.
what about the web? They post every match.
but they do it via a read-only live stream that's up during the fights.
once the fights are over, they're gone.
that's marketing. Keeps up demand.
then where are the highlight reels?
they gotta be hanging on to recordings of past fights.
and if sarge was in the crowd,
maybe one of the cameras caught something.
all right, we'll look into Ty and his web site.
you and Kitt go back to the club and see what you can find.
so what time you wanna head over to the bar?
Annie, I gotta do this alone.
no way.
if anyone should be taking care of this,
it's me.
I don't think so. I do.
Mike, the sarge saved my life.
what are you talking about?
the last week of basic... I was ready to quit.
but the sarge knew that, for me,
that would be going right back to everything
I had been trying to get away from.
when I gave him my d.o.r.he wouldn't take it.
he said,"you can do it. don't give up."
he made me who I am, Mike. I owe him.
and that is why you can't go.
you're too close.
well, you can't stop me.
no, but my car can.
right.
how'd you--hey!
Hey!
Michael, it would be easier for my sensors to access the club if we parked a little closer.
I'm supposed to be desperate for a cage fight, Kitt.
I can't be rolling up in a supercar.
sadly, I have no hooptie application at this time.
given the centralization of rf cables,
it appears all the camera feeds go into this room in the basement, adjacent to the fight cage.
anything in there you can see?
no, but the level of magnetic radiation
suggests the presence of digital tapes.
I guess it's time for round two.
I'm here to fight.
not with you.
and he's back.
he's early.
I wanted to make sure I got a shot tonight.
Yeah, well, I don't make my picks
till I see who's here.
of course, if you want to make yourself useful, soldier,
you can-- you can grab a broom.
whatever it takes.
you army boys don't quit, do you?
Nope.
me, I'm a navy seal.
seals are tough.
yeah...
it was cool.
got to kick a lot of ass.
is that how you got into this?
to keep kickin' ass? No.
this is all about the money, my man.
so the fights are fixed.
hell no.
if I did that, nobody'd watch.
this is as real as it gets.
must feel pretty weird
messing up other vets for cash.
you got a better offer, take it.
most of my guys are happy to be able to make some cash,
not to mention the opportunity to be famous.
famous?
Yeah.
take monster from last night.
two months, never been beat.
three million hits on google, and climbing.
that could be you.
all it takes is one good fight.
what about a great fight?
now we're talkin'.
there was this knob of a drill sergeant I had in basic.
I heard he came this way.
thought I'd get a little payback.
his name was Jack Burber.
Yeah, you know, I'm sorry,
but jack... he's no longer with us.
he, uh... it was in the paper.
overdose.
guess I'll have to settle for someone else then.
I guess you will, army. I guess you will.
fight Night! Fight Night! Fight tonight, right? You gonna be there?
I'll be there. yeah!
ty Mckelver is an exploitati on king.
before coming up with Fight Night,
he was the scum-meister behind bum battles, dog eat dog,
and ghetto girl smackdown.
the one with the rolling pin...yeah.
he's not even a vet.
he was never in the armed services.
he got kicked out of film school.
ha! Doesn't get any lower than that.
I don't understand.
if this is the guy behind all this,
why hasn't he been arrested yet?
he has expensive lawyers and keeps moving from state to state
to change up jurisdiction.
that explains his hook-up with Constance Savage.
sociopathic capitalists and the women who love them.
uh, she's no angel.
five years ago she was co-defendant in a pretty big sweat shop case in Denver.
poor workers... homeless vets?
it's like they find the most vulnerable people,
and then take advantage of them on a massive scale.
we've gotta bust these guys.
I can keep digging into their backgrounds
and see if anything useable shows up.
I'll keep trolling the web for more stuff on fight night.
if it turns out Ty doesn't keep archives,
maybe the fight night fans do.
ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to fight night!
for tonight's first spectacle,
we are gonna give you a big, bruising brawl
that's sure to be a classic.
army...
versus navy!
Kitt, I'm in.
about time, Michael.
I don't see you down here.
you should not be looking for me.
you should be looking for a tape that corresponds to the date of Sgt. Burber's death.
I don't see any tapes.
given the amount of magnetic radiation emanating from the room,
there should be tapes.
I don't see a group of tapes.
have you checked for secret panels in the wall
at the east end of the room?
I think I got it.
what the hell are you doing?
cleaning up.
is everything okay in here?
you tell me.
good news. You're up.
fight Night!
fight Night!
Michael, you should be headed for the exit.
and instead, you are headed for the fight cage.
I'm working on an out.
what's the matter?
nervous acid reflux.
you got a bathroom around here?
sure, but I don't think you want to leave your partner all alone.
partner?
it's the two of them versus you and her.
I told you you couldn't stop me.
Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen,
for our next event tonight,
we are bringing you not one on one...
not one on two...
but two on two!
fight Night presents the beauties and the beasts!
beauties?
what kind of name is-- Aah!
I think I got something.
it's a ripped file on a shared network
and it's titles "fight night choke-out.
it's dated the same night as Sgt.Burbers' death.
what just happened?
it looked like monster was about to kill Sgt.Burber.
well, play the rest of it. I can't. File ends there.
we gotta warn Mike.
too late for that.
Mike and Annie are in the cage now.
Mike, what are you doing?
you were supposed to get the tape and get out.
Yeah, I got sidetracked. Unh!
well, get un-sidetracked!
get over here!
Kitt, a little help here.
I'm analyzing your opponent's physiology and posture
to anticipate his next move.
knee to the groin.
good call.
movement analysis recommencing.
just tell me what to do!
sidestep to your left now.
just like old times, right? Yeah.
except for people weren't cheering for our blood.
Sarge used to say
if the enemy's in range, so are you.
not bad. Not bad yourself.
Mike, stop goofing around and get out of there.
don't worry, we got these guys.
Mike, you don't understand.
from what we can tell,
monster killed Sgt.Burber.
and the only evidence of it is on that tape.
what is it?
we gotta get away from this guy.
you just figure something out about sarge?
Annie, we gotta get away from this guy now.
it was him?
Annie. Annie! Aah!
Michael, look out.
you're tappin' out?! - We're out!
Kitt!
Can't...breathe...
commencing internal scan.
Michael, Annie has suffered a collapsed lung
and is in need of immediate medical attention.
let's get her to the hospital.
I knew you weren't here just to fight.
good thing monster has quick hands, huh?
Kitt, get Annie out of here.
who are you?
Michael?
I gotta get the tape back.
I said who are you?!
go!
get him!
I'll get the car.
Mike?
please relax, Ms.Ortiz.
I'll get you to the hospital shortly.
I'm one of Mike's associates.
my name is Kitt.
here coming an emergency
please assist.
the victim has a punched lung.
Mike, do you read us?
Mike?
still nothing.
both his earwig and gps crapped out right after he left that bar.
he might as wall be on the dark side of the moon.
stop.
you two stay here. You come with me.
hell, he will die. Check this
my god!
Kitt, do you have anything?
I've had no contact with Michael since delivering Annie to the hospital.
however, given his last position,
I have isolated a promising search area,
and I'm entering it now.
initiating tansformation
transformation complete.
Hello?
Zoe, it's Mike.
God, are you all right?
I need Kitt now.
I'll patch you through.
Michael, it is good to hear you.
what is your location?
I don't know. I got a, uh
a dirt road by an old white shack,
maybe ten miles west of the bar.
can you i.d. it?
accessing my global photo database.
dirt road, white shack. Nine miles from the bar.
I have it.
I'll meet you there.
Kitt at the evac point yet?
no. why?
look what I found.
bank records?
for Ty Mckelver.
every time monster wins a match,
Ty's account bumps up five, maybe six figures.
because of the popularity of the fights?
no. he's betting on them.
check this out.
I ran a reverse trace on the account
after the fight last night against Mike and Annie.
ty made quite a haul.
and after he does,
look who he transfers half the money to.
about time, Ki
I knew it was you.
Yep, it's me.
got a report of gunfire around this way.
that you too?
no, sir.
looked into that case of yours.
you were right.
your friend was killed.
now I'm trying to get to the bottom of it.
you got anything that might help me do that?
like maybe a tape?
you gotta stick your nose where it don't belong.
now give it!
you've been working for Ty the whole time.
he's got your girlfriend, so quit stalling.
we don't want no more people asking no more questions.
you want to give it to him in person?
I'll take you there myself.
no, thanks.
I've got my own ride.
Uhh! what
Kitt, open the back door window.
night night.
nice of you to finally show up, by the way.
if you hadn't lost your earwig,
you'd have been much easier to track.
tell me you got him.
I got most of 'em, Ty, and now I'm comin' to get you.
you mean you're coming to give me my tape.
and you're gonna give me Annie.
half an hour.
come alone. sure.
just me and my car.
Mike, state police are 20 minutes out
with the FBI on their tail.
no time. Gotta go now.
but after what was on the tape
we know exactly what to do, Sarah.
Annie, you okay?
that sheriff yanked me from the hospital.
I'll be okay when I get some payback.
nice little reunion.
now drop the gun and give me my tape!
first tell me why you were hanging on to it.
you never know what people are gonna want to watch next.
one day it's a cage fight, next it's murder?
what are you talking about?
Oh, I watched the tape.
Kitt, show him.
the sarge was gonna take out your star
and leave you with a huge betting loss.
so you did what you had to do.
Kitt, zoom in and freeze.
because you bloke him, no one can see.
but the camera did you killed him.
that's as real as it gets.
now let her go. It's over.
Heh heh heh. no, it's not.
don't do it, Michael.
no tap out this time.
you got that right. Unh!
what are you waiting for?!
go stop him!
what the hell is wrong with you, private?!
this is for the sarge.
did the footage finish uploading?
uploaded to the state police, the fbi, and the world wide web.
there's not a jury in this country
that'll let Ty and his buddies go now.
it still doesn't bring the man back.
no.
but maybe it will give his friend some peace.
Yeah. Thanks, Sarah.
you good?
Yeah. Just making arrangements
to have the sergeant shipped to Arlington.
you know how you said he made you who you are?
he did a great job.
Thanks.
Michael, are you all right?
Yeah.
just a little black and blue from Ty and his gang.
well, you know what Sgt.Burber says.
the pain is temporary, but the pride is forever.
you'd make a good drill sergeant, Kitt.
thank you. Now drop and give me 20,
private knight, you worthless bag of Kitt!
Oh, hold on.
I'm coming.
increased productivity through ergonomically beneficial surroundings.
well, in the spirit of ergonomy...
is that even a word?
ergonomy is the applied science of equipment design, Michael.
okay.
well, then in the spirit of... origami,
you ever thinking about making your backseat into a bed, Kitt?
I'm afraid you'd be tempted to invite strangers.
you mean "hoochies," Kitt.
undesirable females, yes.
this puppy has got a cooler built into the armrest
and a remote for the big screen.
first and 17.
Ahh.
that is sweet.
chair belongs on the other side.
I like it where it is.
move it, stretch.
the Chinese system of feng shui
would indicate that Zoe's placement
provides for better chi.
very zen of you, Kitt.
we could use a little more eastern philosophy around here.
see? Better chi.
chop chop.
who died and made you boss?
that would be Alex Torres.
hmm, I see you're already enjoying your downtime.
Oh, I have not yet begun to enjoy.
going anywhere special?
Oh, yeah.
a little sentimental journey.
wait, we get to go somewhere?
outlet mall. - SPA day.
you guys are kidding, right?
I'm going to get mellow and be zen.
you mean "we," Michael.
Yes, we. We are going, Kitt.
back to a special place.
a magical place.
our own little happy place.
michael is taking me to a bar.
who'd have thunk it?
I want to go to a bar.
Oh, no, not just any bar. Sonny's.
Oh, I get it.
your dad took me there for my first beer.
and his dad took him there for his.
it's a neighborhood institution.
a cold brew, beer nuts, live music.
run by Sonny Nelson.
amazing bartender, even better guy.
I haven't been there in years,
but I can tell you that there is no better place to de-stress.
sounds awesome.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of stress.
from what I remember,
Sonny had a daughter.
Yeah, Julie Nelson.
she went to med school I think
somewhere back east.
right. Have a great time.
you too, guys. - Initiating launch pad.
Hello!
Hi.
we better tell him.
or else he might have a breakdown.
somebody please say something.
look, we're going on rotation.
everyone's gonna get a chance to decompress.
first, Mike's gonna take a couple days.
and then you, and then Zoe, and then me.
when's this all gonna start?
ask your boss.
okay, not funny.
no, Billy, it was funny.
a little rougher than I remembered.
I must admit, I'm somewhat concerned for you, Michael.
I'll be okay, Kitt. Just stay close.
and be zen.
I will try.
if you're here about the bouncer job,
you're too pretty.
no, I'm actually here to see Sonny.
Yeah, right.
if you're a collection agent, you can get in line.
sorry?
Sonny's dead.
what?
Oh, my god. Michael, hi.
Hi.
I didn't know you were friends.
is it true about your dad?
Yeah, car accident three months ago.
I'm so sorry.
thank you.
Michael, a nefarious character directly behind you is attempting to steal $20 from the bar.
what the hell is going on around here?
wish I knew.
we've had three fires in the last six weeks.
fights every night. Cops have been closing us down.
what can I do to help?
can you fix the mess at the door?
sometimes Eddie's a little bit too nice for his own good.
big Wddie's at the door?
Eddie's a pacifist.
I know.
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
man.
Hey, the dude that left this unattended is gonna be taking public transportation for a while.
please step back from the vehicle.
Oh, hey.
homeboy's got one of those talking alarms.
Yeah, at least you'd think they'd give it some bad-ass voice like, "step back, clown, before you get smoked."
you get smoked.
ho, ho, ho, ho.
Michael, two felons are eyeing me suspiciously.
permission to administer non-lethal electric shock.
what did I say about Zen, Kitt?
"restraint" is the word of the day.
alright, Michael, oh, my God, dude.
you just got schooled.
Michael, I suggest you use restraint as well.
watch me.
it's $10 each, please.
I get comped at every club on the strip.
why would I pay to go into this place?
this constant pushing is not helping your cause.
nearly everyone at the door is armed.
all right, you're forcing my hand.
can I talk to you for a second?
would you hold on a moment, please?
Hey, Eddie.
what are you doing over here?
I've been wondering the same thing.
all right, any day now, dummy.
I didn't want to resort to violence,
but I feel as though I've reached my limit.
mind a little assist?
cause you're violating the cardinal rule at the door.
Really?
you never tell the bad guy what you're gonna do before you do it.
screw this. We're going in.
he's got a gun in his waistband, Michael.
back up.
that was not smart.
good night, gentlemen.
go.
anybody fighting inside walk them outside.
take them one at a time.
yell if you need any help.
Thanks, man.
Michael, I was harassed by two men.
me too. Get Sarah.
how many you knock back so far?
Kitt, don't let him drive.
Sonny's dead.
Oh, no.
car accident.
and the place isn't right... Mysterious fires, rough crowd.
a mess.
Sonny's never was in the best neighborhood.
maybe you romanticized it a little?
I'm telling you, something's going on here, Sarah.
I need your help.
sure, anything.
Kitt, tap into the local municipal database.
send the accident report, arson files,
and anything else you can dig up back to the SSC.
you guys getting this?
we're on it. Yeah.
so what are you doing there?
I'm the new bouncer.
bouncer?
kick ass.
be careful.
let's get to work on those fires.
no, we should start on the car accident.
begin a broad-spectrum search.
I'm sorry, what?
Sarah was only half joking.
she runs the place because Dr. Graiman left her nine figures,
Mike and Kitt do the outside stuff,
and I'm in charge of all this glory right here.
you? You're my boss?
haven't you noticed
I boss you around almost all day every day?
Yeah, but it's part of our whole fun little dynamic.
no, it's me being your boss.
I have multiple advanced degrees.
I speak nine languages
and I have a card that gets me discounts at participating Red Lobster restaurants.
okay, if this wasn't so ludicrous,
it would be ludicrous.
all right, I'm on the accident.
you look into the fires,
and we'll see who's right soon enough.
it's on.
Oh, it's all the way on.
all right, folks, you don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.
come on, let's go. Come back tomorrow.
let's go.
didn't think you'd last the night.
under-promise and over-deliver.
I'm Mike.
beer?
nothing like a cold beer right after last call.
michael helped my dad 86 some tough customers back in the day.
it was more him than me.
Sonny was a sweet guy, but he had one hot temper.
well, thank God. You showed up tonight.
I'm barely hanging on.
it was never like this before.
it's like somebody wants her outta here.
any idea who that might be?
maybe I'm not cut out for this like my dad.
I seriously doubt it's you.
did you two have a thing?
Robin, come on.
Julie was a college girl,
on to bigger and better things.
she thought I was a punk.
you know, the kind of guy that hangs out in bars.
you didn't answer my question.
she calls you "Michael."
but you introduce yourself as Mike.
are either of you gonna cop to prior nookie or what?
go on.
you think you might be able to stick around a little while longer?
I'm sure I can squeeze it into my schedule.
good.
uh, staff meeting tomorrow morning, 11: 00 a. m.
good night, Julie.
good night, Michael.
see you tomorrow, Mike. - Good night, Eddie.
what?
nothing.
you getting shut out?
three fires in the last two months
of unknown origin.
police did an arson investigation...
... and came up empty.
but you have a theory?
spontaneous combustion.
or maybe it's the tiny chubby gnomes whose thighs rub together and make sparks when they wear corduroy.
I suppose you're doing better with the car accident?
patience, grasshopper.
patience.
anybody else bother you?
I was unmolested the remainder of the evening,
why do you have to use words like "unmolested"?
can't you just say it was all okay?
I practiced the restraint you recommended, ... but it wasn't easy.
well, I'm proud of you, Kitt.
Michael, is it possible you are idealizing Sonny's a bit?
maybe you were remembering it the way you want it to be.
come on, you too?
thomas Wolfe wrote a novel about this phenomenon.
it was called "You Can't Go Home Again."
still think I'm idealizing?
Michael, someone appears to be trapped in the fire.
open up. It's Eddie, help!
open up. It's Eddie.
it's Eddie.
somebody open up!
where is he?
Michael, the pressurized CO2 tanks...
... have become dangerously overheated.
we must act now.
doing.
get in.
Kitt, CO2.
the fire's out, Michael.
are you okay?
all of his vital signs are normal, Michael.
I'm gonna have to ask you not to mention what you saw tonight to anyone.
thank you.
that is the fourth fire in six weeks.
doesn't sound much like an accident.
no, it sounds like arson.
look, Kitt can investigate while you go to your meeting.
she's hot, by the way.
who?
I believe she means Julie, Michael.
hadn't noticed.
you're a terrible liar.
three months ago today,
Julie's father takes his '68 Dodge out for a spin...
... and ends up wrapping it around a telephone pole.
anybody with him?
Nope. - Police report?
same basic story.
witnesses?
cops say no.
but I found two blog entries from the neighborhood from the next day.
both say they saw the car...
... and heard nothing but a crash.
okay, so it was an accident.
but you've got another theory.
actually, I don't.
I've hit a dead end, literally and figuratively.
all right, let's get started.
first up, seems like we had another fire around closing last night.
did anybody see anything?
no? Okay, um...
Hi, Phil.
Hey. How's the nose?
it's broken.
I guess you didn't know who the hell you were assaulting.
Hey.
my son's mouth tends to get...
... a step ahead of his brain.
Mike, isn't it? - Phil Driscoll.
Phil was an old friend of my dad's.
they were in a car club together.
my son comes home with a broken nose, ... I'd never expect to hear it happened at Sonny's.
before I call the police or my lawyer, ... I wanted to hear your side.
sir, I make it a general policy.
not to raise hands to anyone unless they plan on throwing shots at me.
I should've broken your nose myself.
are you kidding me, pop?
what is the old saying?
outside of your wife giving birth, ... nothing good ever happens at 2: 00 a. m.
nice to meet you, Mike. Sorry for the inconvenience.
not at all. Thanks for coming by.
creepy.
Ohh.
come to mama.
Billy, Zoe, I'm analyzing...
... the aftermath of the fire.
you certain it was arson?
Yes, and I have isolated the accelerant.
whoever set the blaze left a chemically significant trail.
can you follow it?
not with my current software configuration.
uploading new sniffer program now.
I'll do it.
duh, I'm already doing it.
Hello?
Hey.
which one do you like better?
what's it for?
first amendment night.
spoken word poetry and $2 jager shots.
congress shall make no law respecting an establishment...
... of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,
... or abridging the freedom of speech.
they teach you about the constitution in the army?
thought I'd be good to actually know...
... What I was defending.
hmm.
my dad called it the marinated microcosm.
everybody's equal with a drink in their hand.
he was a hell of a guy.
Yeah.
is that your grandfather?
Yeah.
built this building with his own two hands.
he still scares me.
he was one mean son of a bitch.
and then some.
this bar was a soup kitchen in the great depression.
a polling place every election.
a shelter in three earthquakes.
my dad was even born here.
how come we never...
for starters, your dad kept a really big bat behind the bar.
it's still there too.
great.
I tried calling and E-mailing.
I even wrote you a letter.
everything came back "undeliverable."
Yeah.
let's just say I got involved in some things...
that didn't turn out so well.
I was gonna be an ophthalmologist.
now I run a bar.
Mike, I've discovered a faint chemical signature from the fire.
we must follow its trail now before it dissipates completely.
I will see you tonight.
Sonny's used to be a friendly neighborhood bar,
right?
Mm-hmm.
all of a sudden, it starts to get rougher.
I thought you were working on the fires.
I was, but what if they're related?
what makes a crowd change?
new owner, neighborhood goes bad,
they water down the drinks.
here's the greatest hits from the front door camera at Sonny's for the last three weeks.
Oh, he's cute.
he's also been in four fights.
so?
he's angry and he's cute.
so he just started showing up at the bar recently along with those four other dudes who've also been getting into fights.
and they are also hot. It's called coincidence.
it would be except I followed them to the bar.
no 20s, no credit cards,
hundred dollar bills every time.
maybe they're drug dealers.
or maybe somebody's paying them to start trouble.
and how does this connect to the fires?
I don't know.
Hey, there's your stang, bro.
still in the hood.
it's like he's teasing us.
I'd take that as a dare, I was you.
Yeah.
it's in the same family as methane, but it's getting fainter as we go.
he must have gotten out of his car here.
you need to go handheld.
Kitt, you there?
right behind you, Michael.
it just stops.
whoever set the fire ended up here.
Phil Driscoll's office.
we traced him from the fire back to his father's office.
it's gotta be Terry.
he definitely had the opportunity.
and a broken nose is definitely motive.
I'd say the motive would be embarrassment.
you made him look weak in front of a beautiful woman.
Yeah, but Terry's a couple tacos short of a combination plate.
you don't think he's capable?
I think he's a moron.
hit me back if Billy and Zoe come up with anything.
Hey,
how's Julie Nelson?
hanging in there.
Terry's a jerk, but he's not an arsonist.
I heard you went out with him.
Wow.
a bar is like ninth grade summer school, isn't it?
uh, yes, it was once,
and it was years ago.
so maybe he was trying to get your attention.
nothing like a two-alarm blaze to get a girl all hot and bothered.
Robin's looking. - Of course she is.
so what about Terry's father?
why would Phil want to burn a place he offered to buy?
he offered to buy your bar?
after my dad was killed,
he figured I couldn't handle the bar by myself.
and maybe he was right.
you do sit on a valuable piece of dirt.
a place like this is a drop in the bucket to a developer like Phil.
believe me, he's doing it as a favor.
Sonny Nelson was driving a '68 Dodge the night of the accident.
nice graphics.
nice grill. - Thanks.
Where'd you get this?
I recreated his route from the blog descriptions, then reenacted the accident using Kitt's 3-d graphic software.
nice work.
wait, I thought we established
no foul play in the accident.
that's what the police said.
not what I say.
he comes around this turn,
hits the brakes,
gets a little squirrelly, continues till he crashes.
okay, so we see the accident.
but what don't we see?
remember, the blogger said that he heard nothing but a crash.
skid marks.
exactly.
he hit the brakes but the car didn't skid.
no screeching, no skidding.
because you think he lost his brakes?
or somebody cut the brake line.
it's not proof.
you said nice work.
it's a simulation.
it's not evidence. It won't hold up in court.
which is why we need to find the real car.
Hey, Mike.
you really made me think about things.
introspection is good, Eddie.
I've always thought of you as sort of a simple guy.
and by "simple" I mean straightforward, but not very complicated.
no offense intended.
none taken.
I set the fire last night.
I thought if I set it and put it out,
I'd be a hero.
but then the back door locked on me.
I know, stupid, right?
and nobody put you up to it?
you saved my life.
who are you really, Mike?
just a guy trying to make things better.
it's a 1968 Dodge Coronet.
I've uploaded tags and vin number to Kitt.
you've gotta find that car.
or what's left of it.
you know, I may have found a flaw in your logic, Kitt.
Really?
your assumption was whoever set the fire ended up at Phil Driscoll's office.
based on the spectrographic analysis, that was correct.
but Eddie admitted he set it.
he could have gone to Driscoll's office after he left us, or he could have been lying.
no, he was threatening to kick Terry Driscoll's ass.
so I'm guessing he wouldn't be heading over to their place for a nightcap.
my gut says he's telling the truth.
it is possible the methane trail could be related to another incident or person.
but outside of the fire, there seems to be no logical reason.
holograms.
Really?
that's right.
that was some seriously impressive shizz back there.
I know.
that's usually my department.
I know.
kinda made me look bad.
I know.
that's why I got you something.
what?
level 14 knows how to party.
these aren't even out yet.
I know.
the DMV search was unsuccessful.
what about junkyards?
insurance companies? Car collectors?
maybe somebody bought it for parts.
I broadened my search parameters,
and they have come up with a possibility.
great. Where's the car?
the last place you ever would have expected.
an art gallery?
you're kidding.
the remains of Julie's father's car were purchased by an artist
and installed as the centerpiece of an exhibit here.
a man died in that car.
apparently there is an artistic subculture
especially fascinated by automobile crashes.
outside their subculture,
they're known as idiots, Kitt.
go ahead, touch it.
it helps you connect.
I call it "beautiful agony."
Wow. Where'd you get it?
I scan the police blotter for fatal accidents,
and I buy the wrecks from the insurance company.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
I can tell that you're into it.
people come right up to the cars as if they...
it's as if they want to connect
with the moment of impact.
it's just so... visceral.
I'll let you remain in the moment then.
listen to it.
it'll sing to you.
enjoy.
ass clown.
Michael, the brake system on a '68 Dodge coronet
has a fluid line running down the left side of the chassis.
Yeah, I'm getting there now.
the brake line's been cut.
it may have been severed in the crash.
no, this cut's too uniform.
someone did this.
Zoe's right.
it was murder.
who the hell is shooting at me?
the shots are coming from the bridge above.
what are you waiting for, a written invitation?
come get me.
on my way, Michael.
cover me, scatter pattern.
rapid fire will exhaust my ammunition supply
in approximately seven seconds.
wow, seven seconds?
that's all you last?
that's 8, 000 rounds, Michael.
no, it's fine. I'm sure Sarah can fix it.
start shooting.
got the wheel? How many?
two in pursuit
and two attempting to block the roadway ahead,
and we are out of ammunition.
okay, bad and bad.
Michael, his is exhilarating.
won't be for long if we don't get outta here.
I'm gonna try something.
I'd advise against it.
Why? You don't even know what I'm gonna do.
I rely on past performance to indicate future action.
prepare for impact.
Kitt, turbo boost.
not on a turn, Michael.
Ooh!
whoo, no fun being predictable.
Hey, you screamed like a girl.
Where's Julie?
upstairs.
Michael, I have scanned the entering crowd.
so far I've detected six knives, a slingshot,
and two Chinese throwing stars.
this is worse than last night.
what the hell is going on?
I am wondering the same thing.
Michael, the felons have returned.
okay, you're good.
I'm gonna open it up like a tin can.
that's it.
Hey, hey, hey.
come on.
come on, let's get outta here.
go, go, go.
come on.
Billy, Zoe, you might want to see this.
Whoa!
I thought Mike told Kitt to be zen.
sometimes a man just reaches his limit.
it's not like Kitt to disobey an order.
Kitt, what happened?
I am wondering the same thing.
you mean that explosion wasn't you?
it wasn't me.
but I do detect high levels of methane gas
that could have been ignited by the welding torch.
going to county registrar's files,
pulling up the real estate records on Sonny's now.
geological surveys too.
they're not here.
already tapped into building and safety.
there was a confidential subterranean survey done six months ago.
by who?
it was paid for by Driscoll Development.
Why?
because it's not the bar.
it's what's under it.
the mineral rights.
Sonny's sits on top of a pool of methane.
based on current prices and the estimated cubic footage,
the rights are worth at least 50 million.
that would explain the explosion.
and the fires and the fights.
and why Driscoll wanted to buy the place.
Yeah, Billy?
it's Phil Driscoll.
he's after the mineral rights.
they're worth at least 50 million.
Phil Driscoll set the fires to force you out.
he hired thugs to start trouble at Sonny's.
he wants your bar because the mineral rights are worth a fortune.
what are you talking about? Phil was doing me a favor.
no, you don't understand.
he had a geological survey done without your father's knowledge.
Michael, stop.
Phil had a heart attack this morning.
found him less than an hour ago.
Phil Driscoll's dead.
Phil was an honest man.
he was my father's friend.
then why was he doing secret oil gas surveys of your property?
what are you talking about?
Kitt, on screen in here.
how'd you do that?
push in on the last page.
is there a signature?
Yes, Terrance Driscoll,
Phil Driscoll's son.
patch in Billy and Zoe.
we just got confirmation on Phil Driscoll's death.
heart attack.
it's not Phil, it's Terry.
always the crazy ones.
you gotta give me something solid enough to take him down.
I'm on it.
what the hell was that?
that is how I straighten out my karma.
programmed image recognition for a 1986 Dodge Coronet.
okay, we're hacked into every business with a camera system within a two-mile radius of Sonny's.
running footage the day of the accident now.
I need you to call Terry Driscoll
and tell him you're so upset by his dad's death
you need to see him.
tell him you can't handle the place by yourself
and you're willing to sell.
he'll never go for it.
trust me.
he'll go for it.
I don't even have his number.
it's ringing.
Terry. It's Julie Nelson.
listen, I need to see you.
this is a crazy long shot.
but we love long shots.
right on schedule.
I'm, uh, I'm really glad you called.
can I get you something to drink?
Yeah, like a methane and soda?
Oh.
you know, I actually think it's harder playing dumb than being dumb.
don't see yourself short, Terry.
you're really good at both.
hold him.
Robin, the bat!
catch.
Oh!
get him outta here.
we got a match.
it's from an ATM camera at a bank across the street.
while Julie's dad was inside the bank,
Terry Driscoll cut his brake line on his car.
that's right. No skid marks.
skid marks.
Ow.
so what happened after I blacked out?
well, I had you brought up here
and, um, then I had my way with you.
okay, it wasn't a dream.
no.
I'm so sorry.
Oh.
I was hoping you would stay a while.
you're keeping the bar open?
Mm-hmm.
come on, you're sitting on, like, 50 million worth of methane.
well, somebody's gotta keep Robin from sleeping with all the customers,
and look at Eddie.
he finally got his confidence back.
I made my dad a promise.
hmm.
sure you don't want to stick around?
could be fun.
you could maybe, um, tell me how you did all that, um...
stuff.
you know what they say.
you can't go home again.
or at least for the next, like, three to four hours.
that's it?
I'm hurt.
stay zen, dude.
you too, Eddie.
I was wrong, Michael.
what are you talking about?
I guess you can go home again.
Harry: Man, will you look at all the hot tail running around this place?
Harry: Man, will you look at all the hot tail running around this place?
look, look. Oh, God.
dad, listen, could you just... Please, please don't embarrass me today, okay?
embarrass you? - Not today.
son, you spent the entire summer depressed because your girlfriend ran off with that pretty boy, Trent.
now, you gotta get out there and crush some ass!
lt's the only way to get your mind off her.
Yes. Yes, that is what l'm talking about. - Yes, huh?
"Crush some ass " ? Oh, come on.
wait, wait, wait.
l'll show you how it's done. - Oh, no. No, no, no.
Harry: Watch this. Just watch and learn. - Just please drive.
Harry: Excuse me, ladies? Hi. Hi.
this is my son, Erik. - Hi.
and he's moving in today, and we were just wondering if maybe either of you were interested in showing him a good time?
no, thanks.
COOZE: Oh!
Harry: l'm sorry.
he's a stallion, just like his old man! - No, Dad, come on!
are you gonna start drinking? Because l desperately need a wing man.
no, l'm not drinking tonight, Bull. l had a rough night last week.
Oh, really? Really? That's fine.
because then l just might have to tell these fine, young ladies about a certain frat boy and a Mexican transvestite!
all right, all right, all right.
one drink.
Yeah, just one.
DWGHT: Hey.
what the hell's with you, man?
can you not see all this prime ass a foot from your face?
Yeah, man, l see. lt's... lt's pretty cool.
Yeah, it's cool. You should be tearing it up!
you guys, it's just...
remember last year? We came up here, l had the time of my life.
you know, l did stuff l never would have dreamed l would've ever done, and l kind of figured it would change me.
Yeah, okay. So you got drunk and you ran naked, right?
but you blew it with a really hot sorority chick to run home and have sex with your little girlfriend.
Yeah, Erik. That stunt might have won you points in high school, - but this isn't high school. - No.
l guess you guys are right.
listen, college is your one chance to start over. Okay?
you get to hit the reset button on life. You get to be anybody you wanna be.
never thought of it like that before. - Yeah. Here, slug that.
that a boy. Julie, this is my cousin, Erik. - JULlE: Hey.
l just wanted you to know Erik voted for you in the hottie contest, and since he's, like, the ladies' man of the family, l totally trust his taste.
you want to dance, gorgeous? - l'd love to.
anybody you wanna be. Yeah.
wow, you can really put that away.
you kidding me? This stuff is like water to me.
Hey, hey, everybody, settle down for a second!
we're just having a little, minor technical glitch.
no big deal. We'll get everything fixed up in a minute.
l don't think so, Stifler!
you see, you overloaded your prehistoric circuits.
l'm afraid your music won't be coming on for the rest of the night.
don't... Don't listen to him. We'll get everything fixed in a minute.
that won't matter because by Jake's calculations, based on the amount of kegs and liquor you bought, you should be running out, just about now.
bullshit. - The fucking kegs are dry!
we're out of fucking booze!
WESLEY: l know!
settle down! lt's fine. We'll make a beer run.
EDGAR: They could do that, or you can all come to the Geek House where we have enough liquor to last a week, along with all the champagne you can drink.
we also have a heated pool and enough swimsuits for everyone.
that is, if you even want to wear one.
Yeah!
are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, it's your choice, people.
stay here and get puked on... - Okay, l'm out of here.
or come party, VlP style.
all right! Let's go! Let's go!
fucking Edgar.
prick really knows how to throw that money around, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, but it doesn't help that numbnuts here barfed all over the chicks, either.
DWGHT: Yeah.
sorry about that. - You look disgusting.
Erik, for crying out loud, man! - l'll clean it up.
not again.
morning, sexy.
some party, huh?
Hey, baby. How you doing?
no. No, no, no.
DWGHT: How you feeling there, cuz?
a lot better. Thanks.
no need for thanks, we're family.
right now, l gotta run. l gotta go down to the basement, take care of some official Beta business.
have some of Peaches' eggs. - Okay.
all right. Thanks, Peaches.
DWGHT: Oh, buddy.
l need this place. - BULL: That a boy!
WESLEY: Yeah. - Off the hook! Work it!
so, guys, the hard- on champ is in?
Yeah! - ALL: All right.
BULL: Aye, aye.
DWlGHT: Yeah, l love this guy.
Beta? l love Beta!
BOBBY: You like Beta, baby? DWGHT: Best rack in the house, though.
l fucking love Beta, baby!
shut up! Shut up! Everyone calm down.
l told you l didn't want to drink.
look how the pig squeals! Look how the pig squeals!
all in favour of Bobby Coolidge?
everyone. - Aye, aye.
aye, aye. - Aye, aye.
DWGHT: All right, all right.
WESLEY: Oh, man! BULL: Jesus!
BULL: Holy crap! Wow!
WESLEY: Man, this guy really knows how to work a room.
give him a bid. He'll be a pussy magnet, buddy.
Yeah!
BULL: Oh, no!
DWGHT: Hey, hey, hey! All right, that's my cousin. Take it easy.
no offence, brother, okay? But l don't know if your cousin is up for the challenge, man.
l'm with Bull on this one. l mean, he's a nice kid, but he passed up sleeping with Brandy, man.
all right, all right, all right.
look, l know Erik missed his big chance to, like, sleep with the one girl that, l'm assuming, everybody in this room would lop off your left nut to bang.
am l right? - BULL: Two nuts.
all right, does that mean he's not Beta material?
Yes! - ALL: Yeah!
he was young and dumb and in love. He's a... He's a late bloomer.
l think he's gonna surprise you this semester.
and anyway, he's a legacy, so he's automatically getting a bid.
so you can all fuck off.
Aye. - Aye, aye!
DWGHT: Yeah, that's what l thought, bitches.
Hey, you. - Hi.
we have to stop meeting like this. - Yeah.
are you okay? - Yeah, l just had a really rough night.
you know, l think Denise has a crush on your friend, Cooze.
she thinks he's sweet.
Denise thinks Cooze is sweet? - Yeah.
wait, actually... - Erik, l...
l was thinking... - Look, l'm just thinking...
do you wanna go out with me once? - Yeah.
Really? - Yeah. That would be really nice.
okay, keep... You have really pretty teeth, by the way.
what's going on?
this sucks.
Hey, guys. Don't go that way. This way's quicker.
dude, l left the best sandwich in my dorm. - COOZE: This sucks.
wait a second. Where are we? - l don't see any sandwiches here.
Hey, guys. You wanna see something?
COOZE: Yes. - That is...
gentlemen, today is the first day of the rest of your lives.
you are the select few who have been chosen to pledge the Beta House.
beta, baby!
now, most fraternities do the pledging thing a little bit differently than we do.
most pledging consists of hate-filled mental and physical hazing designed to break you down.
but here at Beta, l, Dwight Stifler, your pledge master, have devised an elaborate scientific plan to build teamwork and brotherhood.
gentlemen, l give you your pledge board.
on this pledge board are 50 tasks that you and your pledge brothers must complete by semester's end if you want to become Betas.
to start things off, l say we begin with my personal favourite, number37.
okay, so here's the low- down.
one of you has got to get your ass signed by a stripper with photo proof. All right?
all right, we're gonna go get a drink.
Wesley... - Yeah.
don't bother us.
okay, who's gonna try and do this?
Oh, you guys, l got this. Who's got a pen? That'll do.
Hey, baby, how's about signing my ass while l'm up here?
she got Cooze! We gotta help him!
down goes fatty!
stripper brawl!
ERlK: Stifler, we need some help!
Oh, cousin got clothes-lined. That's a shame.
that's gonna leave a big bruise.
those girls are wild tonight.
l used to fuck girls like you in prison.
Oh, l love a good stripper brawl. - Who doesn't?
NlCK: You started it! - Way to go, Cooze.
NlCK: You started it! - Way to go, Cooze.
what? l didn't do anything.
you charged that stripper with a pen like you were going to shove it in her ass.
COOZE: Maybe if her panties smelled like waffles, then you would have done something...
shut up. Shut up!
BOBBY: ...some syrup. That idiot? - l bet she would have liked that.
hey there, gorgeous. You work here? - Yeah, sweetie.
you see, we're pledging the Beta House right now, and one of our tasks is to get our ass signed by a professional dancer like yourself.
so l was just, you know, wondering if maybe you'd do me the honour?
that's a different approach than the boys usually take in this place.
bend over. - Thanks.
my name's Erik Stifler, by the way.
let me get one for the year book.
BOBBY: Nice smile.
you have any relation to Dwight Stifler? - He's my cousin.
Hey, Stifler. - Candy. How are you, sweetheart?
good to see you.
l can see where he gets his charm from.
you come see me soon, okay? - You know l will.
DWGHT: All right, boys. Hey, congratulations. Task 37.
ln the bag! Done! - ALL: Yeah.
ERlK: Good job, boys. That's our first task completed.
l think that stripper's implant broke my face.
everyone, let's go.
sweet Caesar's ghost!
fifteen, check.
sixteen, check.
hmm.
who's that guy? - He's my Swahili instructor.
l have my proficiency exam next week.
nice! - Yeah.
Hey, what's... What's this golden hammer doing in here?
Hey, what's... What's this golden hammer doing in here?
lt's from the Greek Olympiad.
lt was, like, a series of competitions involving skill and deviant behaviour.
they got really out of hand, so the university banned them for life.
the Betas were legendary at them, though. We never lost.
cool. Yeah. - Yeah.
Oh, and remember, Erik...
Yeah.
swahili.
ERlK: This place is swell, isn't it? ASHLEY: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Look at how juicy.
sucking the crab? Wow.
this place is fun. - Yeah. Yeah, this place is awesome.
l thought you'd like it here, you know.
l like this mallet.
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Here. - ERlK: lt's all right.
lt doesn't really taste that bad.
dude, l'm telling you, this chick can't get enough of me.
l did her again last night!
Oh, l can't believe that. You're the man!
l think l know that girl.
you know, not all frat guys are like those guys.
l know. l guess l just have a jaded opinion.
Really? Why's that?
lt's just the typical story.
boy meets girl. Boy goes off to college, joins a frat, starts sleeping with every girl he can.
girl finds out and dumps his ass during winter break.
but that was high school. l'm much older and wiser now.
right, older and wiser. And you're on a date with a guy who's pledging a frat.
l know, and l'm watching you.
dine and ditch. - Yeah.
that's, like, one of my favourite plays of...
ERlK: Oh, my God! ASHLEY: Oh, my God! Are you okay?
ASHLEY: Little help here!
you are just the sweetest.
you just bring it out in me, babe.
perfect. - Yeah?
careful, my feet are real sensitive. - Really?
Oh, my.
l love foot massages.
Oh, my!
l can't!
l'm sorry. - No, that's cool.
lt's totally fine, really.
here, let me just take care of you.
okay.
Ooh!
you like that? - God, yeah.
you do that almost as good as l do.
How're you feeling?
Hey. Good, thanks.
here, let me see. - Oh, no.
no, no. Ashley, it's... You really don't need to do anything.
Oh, my God, Erik. You have to put something on that.
no, it's just a little red.
here, let me.
ERlK: Are you sure? ASHLEY: Yeah.
lt's not...
does it hurt? - No, it's just really cold.
ASHLEY: Does that feel better? - Yeah.
Mmm- hmm.
Wow!
Oh, man! - l didn't even touch it.
no, it's no big deal.
l guess l should just take it as a compliment, right?
l'm sorry. Yeah. l'm sorry. - lt's cool.
wow, that cream feels good.
ash, you might wanna...
just relax.
lt's still hot.
Oh, my God! Mr Biggles!
this is really, really embarrassing. - No, it's okay. lt's okay.
l just haven't seen anything like that.
well, l was a virgin until last year, and then my girlfriend dumped me about four months ago.
okay. Wait, wait, wait. Are you telling me that you haven't...
ln four months?
well, you see, there was this incident that made masturbation very taboo in my household.
well, you have more self- control than most people.
l'm really sorry about Mr Biggles.
Yeah.
just a little... Right. - No, it's...
Oh, baby, l love you. Whoa, baby, why won't you tell me you love me, too?
Hey, Bull. Have you seen Stifler? - He's in a meeting.
what meeting would he be at? - l don't know. Something important.
and it was after my parents...
well, they had to fire the fourth landscaping crew because they caught me with them.
and that's when l knew that l had a problem.
but l have been sex-free for two years now and, you know, never felt better.
you are so brave.
get it in there! Yeah! Faster! Faster!
l'm going as fast as l can. - Faster, bad boy!
faster, l said!
l think l'm gonna... - lt's gonna break!
Yes! Yes!
God, yes.
Oh, boy.
you call yourself a man?
get back here and fuck me!
okay, okay. All right, listen. l just did three times, okay?
l'm gonna go get an icepack and then l'll be right back.
you know the secret, icepacks are for pussies!
Oh, your friend. He wants to come play!
l'm going to see you again!
l'm a grizzly bear! - You're bad.
l'm gonna steal a picnic basket full of orgasms.
okay, lay your head back. Lay your head back.
ready? Are you ready forit? Let's go, all right?
hands and feet inside the tram. Next stop, penetration station, baby.
Hey, get back here!
Stifler, l forgot to tell you...
BULL: Whoa.
get your ass over here, punk. - Okay.
Oh, dude. On her teddy bear? Really?
dude, he hasn't busted a nut in, like, fourmonths.
what do you think l should do?
man, you gotta beat the bishop. - Yeah.
you need to punch that clown. A lot. - What are you talking about?
you need to masturbate, dude. A lot. - ALL: A lot.
so next time you won't blow your load when you're rounding first base.
Yeah.
just gotta clean the pipes.
who is it? - Hey, it's Ashley.
we were gonna hang out, remember?
Yeah! Yeah, l remember.
l... l lost track of time, Ashley. l'll be right there.
are you okay in there? - Yeah.
Yeah, l'm fine. l'm fine. Just give me one second, okay?
Erik, are you naked?
just putting on my t- shirt right now.
there it is.
Hi. - Hi.
can l come in? - No. No, the place is actually a mess.
Bobby's disgusting. - Oh, yeah?
but l know a cool place we can go. - Come on.
all right. Right hand, yellow.
Ooh.
l love this game.
don't you fall or you're losing those boxers.
Oh, really?
are you okay? - Yeah.
Ow.
Hi. - Hi.
l'm sorry.
what? Are you a virgin or something or... - No.
lt's just when l... When l get too excited...
Oh, it's embarrassing.
here.
let me just take care of you again. - Okay.
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Cheers, cheers.
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Cheers, cheers.
Mmm.
let me get that for you. A little spillage. No big deal.
lt's not gonna go off again, is it?
absolutely not. l've been practicing my self- control a lot.
a lot? Okay.
come on.
Oh, just how much have you been working on your self- control?
l'm really sorry. lt's not working.
my stupid friends, they said that if l would...
Erik, it's okay. lt happens.
wine?
all right, boys. We got a live one here.
two clicks north, three clicks east.
all right, three clicks east.
DWGHT: Let's blast our big giant ones.
fire in the hole!
DWlGHT: Direct hit!
DWlGHT: Yes! - Oh, my God.
l love the smell of boobies in the morning.
Hey, so how's it going with Denise?
well, okay, so we hooked up and she gave me a couple of hand jobs.
hand jobs?
they're actually the best hand jobs l've ever had in my life.
Oh, really? - Shut up!
the only problem is l try to stick my hand down her pants, she keeps... Pulls my hands away.
she says she's embarrassed.
uh- oh.
maybe she has an abnormally large bush. - Yeah, or maybe she's got a yeast infection.
come on. - Maybe she's got a dick.
huh?
what? Crying Game? Boys Don't Cry?
that's based on true stories, boys. - No.
Yeah. - No, there's no way.
Hey, man, maybe she's a hermaphrodite.
transvestite? A little Shanghai Surprise!
well, come on. You said yourself, she gives you the best hand jobs you've ever had in your whole life. Right?
Yeah, so?
so, how do you think she got so good at it?
probably from working her own gear.
so you guys think that l might have been hooking up with a dude this whole time?
maybe. There's only one way to find out.
you gotta get into those pants.
Oh, wait. This is too perfect. Load it up. Load it up, right now.
what the... - DWGHT: Sorry!
DWGHT: Yeah! ALL: Yeah!
l want you to go down on me, Cooze.
are you sure? Because l can wait.
no, l want you down there now.
that's it, Cooze.
that's it, Cooze.
suck my cock!
she's got a dick!
are you okay?
Oh, my God. l just had the worse nightmare.
what was it about? Who's got a dick?
l do.
Oh, my God.
l can't take this anymore.
Hello?
ASHLEY: l thought you were gonna call me.
Oh, hey.
Yeah. l fell asleep.
l'm sorry.
were you dreaming about me?
maybe.
Hey, can you hold on for one sec?
because this isn't a dream.
Oh, God. That's not mine. That's Bobby's.
that's not mine.
guys. What the hell are you doing?
BOBBY: Number 33, baby.
we got a chance to do number 33, but we gotta go now.
half- naked girl here. - Sorry, Ashley.
dude, the manager just called. He's got an opening.
we haven't even rehearsed for that bit yet. - lt's our only chance, man.
Really?
Ashley, it is Number 33.
maybe, we could just finish later or something?
lt's cool.
l'm coming with you.
we rocked that place. - Yeah!
COOZE: Awesome!
number 46, sex in the stacks. Chalk it up.
number 26, receive a golden shower.
number 27, perform a Clevel and steamer.
check. - COOZE: Oh, man.
get a panda in the grotto.
thirty, get a blumpkin. - COOZE: Oh, you didn't.
after corned beef. lt was disgusting.
all right. Yeah. That was pretty good. - BOBBY: Yeah!
by the power granted to me by the great country of Canada, l now pronounce you life partners.
would you like to seal it with a kiss?
no. - Yes.
number 41. Make it official.
because l'm a gentleman.
Wow. You boys are such an inspiration.
l think it's time we do a little mid- semester celebrating.
what do you think? - Yes. Definitely.
Stifler, l'm afraid l gotta see everyone's lDs.
come on, Manny. You're joking, right?
l'm afraid not.
you see, the new ownership of this establishment doesn't condone under age drinking.
officers, please escort these minors from the premises.
BOBBY: Can l touch your gun? ERlK: All right, okay. We're going.
EDGAR: Bye- bye. - You're fucking with traditions, Edgar.
l'm not just fucking with your traditions, l'm tearing them down.
take him away.
you know, you are way too classy, and have way too nice of a body to be hanging out with a douche bag like that.
don't listen to him, honey. Your body isn't that great.
l'll have a gimlet, please. Thank you.
DWGHT: What? - Your lawyer's here.
excellent. Thanks, Marty. Send him in.
excellent. Thanks, Marty. Send him in.
you have a lawyer?
thanks for coming. l'm glad you got here.
well, you know me. l'm always down for the cause.
Betas for life, baby. - Betas for life.
mr Levenstein?
Hey, Erik. How's your mom and dad?
they're good. They're really good, actually.
well, that's good. - DWGHT: Hey, guys, this is Noah.
he's a Beta alum. He's our House-counselling consigliere.
this guy has gotten us out of more shit than you can even imagine.
well you Beta boys do keep me busy, that's for sure.
now, l've just talked to the district attorney.
he's an old school chum of mine. He's willing to drop all the charges if you promise never to set foot in the Silver Dollar again.
this is ridiculous.
where am l gonna have Sunday brunch?
Oh, look, l know you're upset.
they do have a great omelet bar, that's for sure.
but you're just gonna have to give it up. - No, we can't.
these geeks... These geeks are messing with the Beta way of life.
MARTY: You want to step inside, Noah?
Oh, it's open? - MARTY: Yeah.
Oh, thanks Marty.
lf you wanna grab a sandwich, l'll just be a minute.
look, fellas, there is a bigger picture here than the Beta way of life.
ls that what you thought when you were in the Beta House?
no.
no. lt wasn't. - So...
so l think something has to be done here. Within the confines of the law, of course.
of course. OF course.
so what would you do?
what would l do?
l would crush those geeks with every Beta muscle in my body.
but that's just me.
see you boys at home coming. Say hi to your folks, Erik.
ERlK: l will. Thank you.
ERlK: Come on.
Oh, once again your pathetic little brain has let you down, Dwight.
Bandhu, up.
all right, Erik. We got this. Let's go.
we're fucked.
come on, Erik! Go, go, go!
we can beat those Betas.
how'd you feel about that...
come on! Come on!
maybe l should have carried you.
man, that is one scary chick.
that's a chick?
and now, the Peloponnesian War.
the first team to consume an entire keg wins.
throwing up does not disqualify.
gentlemen, inside this cylindrical casing of aluminium, lies 55 metric litres of malted alcohol.
remember, fellas, don't underestimate these Geeks.
most of them are lonely problem drinkers, all right?
beware, gentlemen, these men know how to drink, but we are more than men.
we are more than men!
we, sirs, are Geeks!
EDGAR: Yes! - All right, boys. Battle!
gentlemen, chug- a- lug! - l can out-drink you fucks!
EDGAR: Drink!
l only have one thing to say to you.
what's that, you philistine?
puking doesn't disqualify!
geeks, attack! - DWlGHT: Boot and rally, boys!
come on, Edgar. Let's see what you got, bitch.
that's all you got, huh? That's all you got?
go back to the keg!
we got a man down!
gentlemen, we need to attain maximum efficiency.
attach the device!
what the hell is that? - What is that thing?
open valves.
that's the Geeks taking the lead. lt's time for our secret weapon. Wesley!
man: Let's go! - Wesley, keg stand!
open the valves all the way. We need warp speed on this, motherfucker!
Betas win!
with the Greek Olympiad tied, we now go into sudden death.
the final event is called The Rise of Aphrodite.
quite simply, the first man who excretes his manly juices, in the ejaculatory sense, loses.
l cannot wait to see you come in your pants.
let's do this.
pi is equal to 3. 1415...
no big deal at all. - 5978...
l feel like Santa Claus at the local shopping mall.
that was nothing. l'm okay. - That was nothing for me, either.
no big deal.
l like your boobs. - BOBBY: Look at this.
pretend you're sucking my man breast!
give it up, Stifler. This is a game of mind over matter.
and my brain is way bigger than yours.
l've got experience on my side.
l'll take that over your Vulcan mind tricks any day.
we shall see. Bring her in!
we flew this young lady in from Las Vegas.
she's the number one stripper in the Emerald City.
enjoy, Dwight.
Oh, no!
good luck.
l'm in trouble here, boys.
this chick is ridiculous. Bring her in!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
what the fuck?
look at my tail, Edgar.
look how fluffy it is.
somebody make her stop.
Edgar, you got a little wool fetish, buddy?
No! Make her stop!
he's done.
Betas win.
all: Beta! Beta! Beta! Beta! Beta! Beta!
to the winners, l now present the Golden Hammer!
to Beta House!
beta, baby!
congratulations, Stifler. You've kept the Beta traditions alive.
Thanks, Noah. Betas for life. - Betas for life.
now this is a frat party.
no. This is a Beta party.
Hey, l got a little surprise for you. - Yeah?
a little present for you being so patient and understanding.
okay.
are you ready for your present? - l'm not sure.
l'm really confused right now, and l'm trying to keep an open mind but...
Oh, man this is fucked up even for me.
DENlSE: Here it comes.
Oh, my God. lf it's bigger than mine, l swear, l'm gonna pass out.
l'm not wearing any panties.
easy, Cooze. Everybody can see you.
well, l'm sure we can find some place around here with a little privacy.
okay. - Let's go.
come on.
where are you taking me? - lt's a surprise. You're gonna like it.
l'm nervous.
what are you talking about? Everything's gonna be fine.
are you sure? - Yeah.
why don't l take care of you.
okay.
okay.
Oh, my.
l can't! l can't!
look, just let yourself go, baby.
there's nothing you can do that's gonna surprise me. Okay?
are you sure? - Yeah.
okay!
why are you bringing me in here?
well, this being our new house, l thought l'd come up with my own task for the pledge board.
okay. What's that gonna be?
well, l think it's kind of better if l show you.
sex in a movie theatre.
l like the way you think, Erik Stifler.
l'm coming! l'm coming!
l'm coming!
Oh, my...
okay. l was a little surprised by that.
l'm sorry.
lt's okay.
lt was actually really sexy. - Really?
Yeah. Can you do that every time?
Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah?
Oh, my God.
Hey, buddy, take a little dip in the pool? - Nope.
Oh, wait a minute.
Yes. The elusive female ejaculation.
not a lot of girls can do that. Congrats.
beta House fucking rules!
Hey, big boy, ready to fill me up with some more protein?
no, no, no. No!
Yes, the Blackout Menace strikes again.
wear this for your next dance, honey.
Thanks.
Harry: Man, will you look at all the hot tail running around this place?
Harry: Man, will you look at all the hot tail running around this place?
look, look. Oh, God.
dad, listen, could you just... Please, please don't embarrass me today, okay?
embarrass you? - Not today.
son, you spent the entire summer depressed because your girlfriend ran off with that pretty boy, Trent.
now, you gotta get out there and crush some ass!
lt's the only way to get your mind off her.
Yes. Yes, that is what l'm talking about. - Yes, huh?
"Crush some ass " ? Oh, come on.
wait, wait, wait.
l'll show you how it's done. - Oh, no. No, no, no.
Harry: Watch this. Just watch and learn. - Just please drive.
Harry: Excuse me, ladies? Hi. Hi.
this is my son, Erik. - Hi.
and he's moving in today, and we were just wondering if maybe either of you were interested in showing him a good time?
no, thanks.
COOZE: Oh!
Harry: l'm sorry.
he's a stallion, just like his old man! - No, Dad, come on!
are you gonna start drinking? Because l desperately need a wing man.
no, l'm not drinking tonight, Bull. l had a rough night last week.
Oh, really? Really? That's fine.
because then l just might have to tell these fine, young ladies about a certain frat boy and a Mexican transvestite!
all right, all right, all right.
one drink.
Yeah, just one.
DWGHT: Hey.
what the hell's with you, man?
can you not see all this prime ass a foot from your face?
Yeah, man, l see. lt's... lt's pretty cool.
Yeah, it's cool. You should be tearing it up!
you guys, it's just...
remember last year? We came up here, l had the time of my life.
you know, l did stuff l never would have dreamed l would've ever done, and l kind of figured it would change me.
Yeah, okay. So you got drunk and you ran naked, right?
but you blew it with a really hot sorority chick to run home and have sex with your little girlfriend.
Yeah, Erik. That stunt might have won you points in high school, - but this isn't high school. - No.
l guess you guys are right.
listen, college is your one chance to start over. Okay?
you get to hit the reset button on life. You get to be anybody you wanna be.
never thought of it like that before. - Yeah. Here, slug that.
that a boy. Julie, this is my cousin, Erik. - JULlE: Hey.
l just wanted you to know Erik voted for you in the hottie contest, and since he's, like, the ladies' man of the family, l totally trust his taste.
you want to dance, gorgeous? - l'd love to.
anybody you wanna be. Yeah.
wow, you can really put that away.
you kidding me? This stuff is like water to me.
Hey, hey, everybody, settle down for a second!
we're just having a little, minor technical glitch.
no big deal. We'll get everything fixed up in a minute.
l don't think so, Stifler!
you see, you overloaded your prehistoric circuits.
l'm afraid your music won't be coming on for the rest of the night.
don't... Don't listen to him. We'll get everything fixed in a minute.
that won't matter because by Jake's calculations, based on the amount of kegs and liquor you bought, you should be running out, just about now.
bullshit. - The fucking kegs are dry!
we're out of fucking booze!
WESLEY: l know!
settle down! lt's fine. We'll make a beer run.
EDGAR: They could do that, or you can all come to the Geek House where we have enough liquor to last a week, along with all the champagne you can drink.
we also have a heated pool and enough swimsuits for everyone.
that is, if you even want to wear one.
Yeah!
are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, it's your choice, people.
stay here and get puked on... - Okay, l'm out of here.
or come party, VlP style.
all right! Let's go! Let's go!
fucking Edgar.
prick really knows how to throw that money around, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, but it doesn't help that numbnuts here barfed all over the chicks, either.
DWGHT: Yeah.
sorry about that. - You look disgusting.
Erik, for crying out loud, man! - l'll clean it up.
not again.
morning, sexy.
some party, huh?
Hey, baby. How you doing?
no. No, no, no.
DWGHT: How you feeling there, cuz?
a lot better. Thanks.
no need for thanks, we're family.
right now, l gotta run. l gotta go down to the basement, take care of some official Beta business.
have some of Peaches' eggs. - Okay.
all right. Thanks, Peaches.
DWGHT: Oh, buddy.
l need this place. - BULL: That a boy!
WESLEY: Yeah. - Off the hook! Work it!
so, guys, the hard-on champ is in?
Yeah! - ALL: All right.
BULL: Aye, aye.
DWlGHT: Yeah, l love this guy.
Beta? l love Beta!
BOBBY: You like Beta, baby? DWGHT: Best rack in the house, though.
l fucking love Beta, baby!
shut up! Shut up! Everyone calm down.
l told you l didn't want to drink.
look how the pig squeals! Look how the pig squeals!
all in favour of Bobby Coolidge?
everyone. - Aye, aye.
aye, aye. - Aye, aye.
DWGHT: All right, all right.
WESLEY: Oh, man! BULL: Jesus!
BULL: Holy crap! Wow!
WESLEY: Man, this guy really knows how to work a room.
give him a bid. He'll be a pussy magnet, buddy.
Yeah!
BULL: Oh, no!
DWGHT: Hey, hey, hey! All right, that's my cousin. Take it easy.
no offence, brother, okay? But l don't know if your cousin is up for the challenge, man.
l'm with Bull on this one. l mean, he's a nice kid, but he passed up sleeping with Brandy, man.
all right, all right, all right.
look, l know Erik missed his big chance to, like, sleep with the one girl that, l'm assuming, everybody in this room would lop off your left nut to bang.
am l right? - BULL: Two nuts.
all right, does that mean he's not Beta material?
Yes! - ALL: Yeah!
he was young and dumb and in love. He's a... He's a late bloomer.
l think he's gonna surprise you this semester.
and anyway, he's a legacy, so he's automatically getting a bid.
so you can all fuck off.
Aye. - Aye, aye!
DWGHT: Yeah, that's what l thought, bitches.
Hey, you. - Hi.
we have to stop meeting like this. - Yeah.
are you okay? - Yeah, l just had a really rough night.
you know, l think Denise has a crush on your friend, Cooze.
she thinks he's sweet.
Denise thinks Cooze is sweet? - Yeah.
wait, actually... - Erik, l...
l was thinking... - Look, l'm just thinking...
do you wanna go out with me once? - Yeah.
Really? - Yeah. That would be really nice.
okay, keep... You have really pretty teeth, by the way.
what's going on?
this sucks.
Hey, guys. Don't go that way. This way's quicker.
dude, l left the best sandwich in my dorm. - COOZE: This sucks.
wait a second. Where are we? - l don't see any sandwiches here.
Hey, guys. You wanna see something?
COOZE: Yes. - That is...
gentlemen, today is the first day of the rest of your lives.
you are the select few who have been chosen to pledge the Beta House.
beta, baby!
now, most fraternities do the pledging thing a little bit differently than we do.
most pledging consists of hate- filled mental and physical hazing designed to break you down.
but here at Beta, l, Dwight Stifler, your pledge master, have devised an elaborate scientific plan to build teamwork and brotherhood.
gentlemen, l give you your pledge board.
on this pledge board are 50 tasks that you and your pledge brothers must complete by semester's end if you want to become Betas.
to start things off, l say we begin with my personal favourite, number37.
okay, so here's the low- down.
one of you has got to get your ass signed by a stripper with photo proof. All right?
all right, we're gonna go get a drink.
Wesley... - Yeah.
don't bother us.
okay, who's gonna try and do this?
Oh, you guys, l got this. Who's got a pen? That'll do.
Hey, baby, how's about signing my ass while l'm up here?
she got Cooze! We gotta help him!
down goes fatty!
stripper brawl!
ERlK: Stifler, we need some help!
Oh, cousin got clothes-lined. That's a shame.
that's gonna leave a big bruise.
those girls are wild tonight.
l used to fuck girls like you in prison.
Oh, l love a good stripper brawl. - Who doesn't?
NlCK: You started it! - Way to go, Cooze.
NlCK: You started it! - Way to go, Cooze.
what? l didn't do anything.
you charged that stripper with a pen like you were going to shove it in her ass.
COOZE: Maybe if her panties smelled like waffles, then you would have done something...
shut up. Shut up!
BOBBY: ...some syrup. That idiot? - l bet she would have liked that.
hey there, gorgeous. You work here? - Yeah, sweetie.
you see, we're pledging the Beta House right now, and one of our tasks is to get our ass signed by a professional dancer like yourself.
so l was just, you know, wondering if maybe you'd do me the honour?
that's a different approach than the boys usually take in this place.
bend over. - Thanks.
my name's Erik Stifler, by the way.
let me get one for the year book.
BOBBY: Nice smile.
you have any relation to Dwight Stifler? - He's my cousin.
Hey, Stifler. - Candy. How are you, sweetheart?
good to see you.
l can see where he gets his charm from.
you come see me soon, okay? - You know l will.
DWGHT: All right, boys. Hey, congratulations. Task 37.
ln the bag! Done! - ALL: Yeah.
ERlK: Good job, boys. That's our first task completed.
l think that stripper's implant broke my face.
everyone, let's go.
sweet Caesar's ghost!
fifteen, check.
sixteen, check.
hmm.
who's that guy? - He's my Swahili instructor.
l have my proficiency exam next week.
nice! - Yeah.
Hey, what's... What's this golden hammer doing in here?
Hey, what's... What's this golden hammer doing in here?
lt's from the Greek Olympiad.
lt was, like, a series of competitions involving skill and deviant behaviour.
they got really out of hand, so the university banned them for life.
the Betas were legendary at them, though. We never lost.
cool. Yeah. - Yeah.
Oh, and remember, Erik...
Yeah.
swahili.
ERlK: This place is swell, isn't it? ASHLEY: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Look at how juicy.
sucking the crab? Wow.
this place is fun. - Yeah. Yeah, this place is awesome.
l thought you'd like it here, you know.
l like this mallet.
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Here. - ERlK: lt's all right.
lt doesn't really taste that bad.
dude, l'm telling you, this chick can't get enough of me.
l did her again last night!
Oh, l can't believe that. You're the man!
l think l know that girl.
you know, not all frat guys are like those guys.
l know. l guess l just have a jaded opinion.
Really? Why's that?
lt's just the typical story.
boy meets girl. Boy goes off to college, joins a frat, starts sleeping with every girl he can.
girl finds out and dumps his ass during winter break.
but that was high school. l'm much older and wiser now.
right, older and wiser. And you're on a date with a guy who's pledging a frat.
l know, and l'm watching you.
dine and ditch. - Yeah.
that's, like, one of my favourite plays of...
ERlK: Oh, my God! ASHLEY: Oh, my God! Are you okay?
ASHLEY: Little help here!
you are just the sweetest.
you just bring it out in me, babe.
perfect. - Yeah?
careful, my feet are real sensitive. - Really?
Oh, my.
l love foot massages.
Oh, my!
l can't!
l'm sorry. - No, that's cool.
lt's totally fine, really.
here, let me just take care of you.
okay.
Ooh!
you like that? - God, yeah.
you do that almost as good as l do.
How're you feeling?
Hey. Good, thanks.
here, let me see. - Oh, no.
no, no. Ashley, it's... You really don't need to do anything.
Oh, my God, Erik. You have to put something on that.
no, it's just a little red.
here, let me.
ERlK: Are you sure? ASHLEY: Yeah.
lt's not...
does it hurt? - No, it's just really cold.
ASHLEY: Does that feel better? - Yeah.
Mmm- hmm.
Wow!
Oh, man! - l didn't even touch it.
no, it's no big deal.
l guess l should just take it as a compliment, right?
l'm sorry. Yeah. l'm sorry. - lt's cool.
wow, that cream feels good.
ash, you might wanna...
just relax.
lt's still hot.
Oh, my God! Mr Biggles!
this is really, really embarrassing. - No, it's okay. lt's okay.
l just haven't seen anything like that.
well, l was a virgin until last year, and then my girlfriend dumped me about four months ago.
okay. Wait, wait, wait. Are you telling me that you haven't...
ln four months?
well, you see, there was this incident that made masturbation very taboo in my household.
well, you have more self- control than most people.
l'm really sorry about Mr Biggles.
Yeah.
just a little... Right. - No, it's...
Oh, baby, l love you. Whoa, baby, why won't you tell me you love me, too?
Hey, Bull. Have you seen Stifler? - He's in a meeting.
what meeting would he be at? - l don't know. Something important.
and it was after my parents...
well, they had to fire the fourth landscaping crew because they caught me with them.
and that's when l knew that l had a problem.
but l have been sex- free for two years now and, you know, never felt better.
you are so brave.
get it in there! Yeah! Faster! Faster!
l'm going as fast as l can. - Faster, bad boy!
faster, l said!
l think l'm gonna... - lt's gonna break!
Yes! Yes!
God, yes.
Oh, boy.
you call yourself a man?
get back here and fuck me!
okay, okay. All right, listen. l just did three times, okay?
l'm gonna go get an icepack and then l'll be right back.
you know the secret, icepacks are for pussies!
Oh, your friend. He wants to come play!
l'm going to see you again!
l'm a grizzly bear! - You're bad.
l'm gonna steal a picnic basket full of orgasms.
okay, lay your head back. Lay your head back.
ready? Are you ready forit? Let's go, all right?
hands and feet inside the tram. Next stop, penetration station, baby.
Hey, get back here!
Stifler, l forgot to tell you...
BULL: Whoa.
get your ass over here, punk. - Okay.
Oh, dude. On her teddy bear? Really?
dude, he hasn't busted a nut in, like, fourmonths.
what do you think l should do?
man, you gotta beat the bishop. - Yeah.
you need to punch that clown. A lot. - What are you talking about?
you need to masturbate, dude. A lot. - ALL: A lot.
so next time you won't blow your load when you're rounding first base.
Yeah.
just gotta clean the pipes.
who is it? - Hey, it's Ashley.
we were gonna hang out, remember?
Yeah! Yeah, l remember.
l... l lost track of time, Ashley. l'll be right there.
are you okay in there? - Yeah.
Yeah, l'm fine. l'm fine. Just give me one second, okay?
Erik, are you naked?
just putting on my t- shirt right now.
there it is.
Hi. - Hi.
can l come in? - No. No, the place is actually a mess.
Bobby's disgusting. - Oh, yeah?
but l know a cool place we can go. - Come on.
all right. Right hand, yellow.
Ooh.
l love this game.
don't you fall or you're losing those boxers.
Oh, really?
are you okay? - Yeah.
Ow.
Hi. - Hi.
l'm sorry.
what? Are you a virgin or something or... - No.
lt's just when l... When l get too excited...
Oh, it's embarrassing.
here.
let me just take care of you again. - Okay.
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Cheers, cheers.
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Cheers, cheers.
Mmm.
let me get that for you. A little spillage. No big deal.
lt's not gonna go off again, is it?
absolutely not. l've been practicing my self-control a lot.
a lot? Okay.
come on.
Oh, just how much have you been working on your self- control?
l'm really sorry. lt's not working.
my stupid friends, they said that if l would...
Erik, it's okay. lt happens.
wine?
all right, boys. We got a live one here.

this guy has gotten us out of more shit than you can even imagine.
well you Beta boys do keep me busy, that's for sure.

he's an old school chum of mine. He's willing to drop all the charges if you promise never to set foot in the Silver Dollar again.
this is ridiculous.
where am l gonna have Sunday brunch?
Oh, look, l know you're upset.
they do have a great omelet bar, that's for sure.
but you're just gonna have to give it up. - No, we can't.

MARTY: You want to step inside, Noah?
Oh, it's open? - MARTY: Yeah.
Oh, thanks Marty.

look, fellas, there is a bigger picture here than the Beta way of life.
ls that what you thought when you were in the Beta House?
no.
no. lt wasn't. - So...
so l think something has to be done here. Within the confines of the law, of course.
of course. OF course.
so what would you do?
what would l do?
l would crush those geeks with every Beta muscle in my body.
but that's just me.
see you boys at home coming. Say hi to your folks, Erik.
ERlK: l will. Thank you.
ERlK: Come on.
Oh, once again your pathetic little brain has let you down, Dwight.

and now, the Peloponnesian War.
the first team to consume an entire keg wins.
throwing up does not disqualify.
gentlemen, inside this cylindrical casing of aluminium, lies 55 metric litres of malted alcohol.
remember, fellas, don't underestimate these Geeks.
most of them are lonely problem drinkers, all right?
beware, gentlemen, these men know how to drink, but we are more than men.
we are more than men!
we, sirs, are Geeks!
EDGAR: Yes! - All right, boys. Battle!
gentlemen, chug- a- lug! - l can out-drink you fucks!
EDGAR: Drink!
l only have one thing to say to you.
what's that, you philistine?
puking doesn't disqualify!
geeks, attack! - DWlGHT: Boot and rally, boys!
come on, Edgar. Let's see what you got, bitch.
that's all you got, huh? That's all you got?
go back to the keg!
we got a man down!
gentlemen, we need to attain maximum efficiency.
attach the device!
what the hell is that? - What is that thing?
open valves.
that's the Geeks taking the lead. lt's time for our secret weapon. Wesley!
man: Let's go! - Wesley, keg stand!
open the valves all the way. We need warp speed on this, motherfucker!
Betas win!

pi is equal to 3. 1415...
no big deal at all. - 5978...
l feel like Santa Claus at the local shopping mall.
that was nothing. l'm okay. - That was nothing for me, either.
no big deal.
l like your boobs. - BOBBY: Look at this.
pretend you're sucking my man breast!
give it up, Stifler. This is a game of mind over matter.
and my brain is way bigger than yours.
l've got experience on my side.
l'll take that over your Vulcan mind tricks any day.
we shall see. Bring her in!
we flew this young lady in from Las Vegas.
she's the number one stripper in the Emerald City.

Oh, no!
good luck.

Hey, l got a little surprise for you. - Yeah?
a little present for you being so patient and understanding.
okay.
are you ready for your present? - l'm not sure.
l'm really confused right now, and l'm trying to keep an open mind but...
Oh, man this is fucked up even for me.
DENlSE: Here it comes.
Oh, my God. lf it's bigger than mine, l swear, l'm gonna pass out.
l'm not wearing any panties.
easy, Cooze. Everybody can see you.
well, l'm sure we can find some place around here with a little privacy.
okay. - Let's go.

where are you taking me? - lt's a surprise. You're gonna like it.
l'm nervous.
what are you talking about? Everything's gonna be fine.
are you sure? - Yeah.
why don't l take care of you.
okay.
okay.
Oh, my.
l can't! l can't!
look, just let yourself go, baby.
there's nothing you can do that's gonna surprise me. Okay?
are you sure? - Yeah.
okay!
why are you bringing me in here?
well, this being our new house, l thought l'd come up with my own task for the pledge board.
okay. What's that gonna be?
well, l think it's kind of better if l show you.
sex in a movie theatre.
l like the way you think, Erik Stifler.
l'm coming! l'm coming!
l'm coming!
Oh, my...
okay. l was a little surprised by that.
l'm sorry.
lt's okay.
lt was actually really sexy. - Really?
Yeah. Can you do that every time?
Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah?
Oh, my God.
Hey, buddy, take a little dip in the pool? - Nope.
Oh, wait a minute.
Yes. The elusive female ejaculation.
not a lot of girls can do that. Congrats.
beta House fucking rules!
Hey, big boy, ready to fill me up with some more protein?

Yes, the Blackout Menace strikes again.

Thanks.

I'm so tired of Rigmor!
Rigmor says you're tired of yourself.
but I'm wonderful! Why would I be tired of myself?
very funny!
you never Laugh at anything funny.
Rigmor says that Laughter is a sign of instability.
you're one twisted kid, Bud. And Rigmor is a crown idiot.
good morning, my Lovely architect! Sweet dreams?
I dreamt that I got to design a house by myself!
how can you dream about something that boring?
Rigmor says... -Shut up, Bud!
I agree! " Rigmor says bIah-bIah-bIah. "
it's time for a new kindergarten. -Excellent idea.
good morning, my conservative son. -Get thee hence, Laborer!

Rigmor!
what is important, children? -Your inner self. Your inner self.
morning, Gunnar.
Kurt!
is it really necessary with such rough Language, boys?
can't we all just get along?
what do you think about canceling the forklift race this year?

Almighty then! Let's get back to work, boys.
Yes!

this is forklift-driver food.
four out of five here are not forklift drivers.
and four out of five here will never become Young Conservatives.
have you had a nice architect day? What is this?
nothing. -It's a Lovely forklift garage!
it's a doghouse! No one sees my true talent. I want to draw bigger things.
size doesn't matter. Except when it comes to forklifts.
sorry!
careful, you Polish idiot! You could have ruined my statue!
hi there!
Dr. Petter. I'm your new neighbor.
you practically ruined our house!
not much of a house. At Least not for a doctor.
perhaps you aren't doctors? -Rigmor says all people are equal.
here's money for repairs. There's more where that came from.
you think you can ruin our house and buy your way out?
Yup. -We'll see about that!
what a charming doghouse! Are you an architect?
architect is such a big word. But yes, I suppose I am.
I Love architects. Simply Love them!
do you Love forklifts? -Nope. Talk to you Later.
wonderful Copenhagen!
what are you doing?!
what an exciting, delightful man. -Delightful?
he destroyed our house! -But he paid for the damages.
he has a new house. He probably needs an architect.
can we buy a car Like Dr. Petter's?
I don't want some stupid doctor's car!
we couldn't afford it anyway. Because Fat Helena eats too much!
a new car? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
what do you say, Bud? -Rigmor says to Love what you have.
what was that?
what is he doing over there?
he's blasting out his new pool. -How do you know?
because I'm drawing it! -Traitor! Quisling!

what's happening tomorrow? -He's inaugurating his new pool.
didn't I mention that?
doctors and architects are coming.
maybe even the prime minister!
I'm not going. -Why not?
I plan on arranging my own pool party.
I may have forgotten to invite you. I've been so busy.
but we don't have a pool. -That's what you think!
how unfortunate that our two parties happened to clash.
what a bummer! -Look at all those exciting guests!
doctors and architects...
fortunately we prefer being here, the whole family.
almost the whole family. -They're talking about my pool!
that guy's mouth Looks Like a butthole!
what? Are you going to talk to them?
maybe just a Little. But I'll come to your party Later.

Rigmor says having fun is overrated.
I understand if you want to go. -Maybe just a short visit?
go ahead, Bud.

I hear you're a forklift driver.
I Love driving my forklift. Always have.
but it isn't very important. -Huh?
it can't be as important as certain other jobs.
like what? -Like my job. I'm a doctor.
I make sure people stay healthy. Imagine if no one was healthy!
that would be bad. But forklifts are important too.
do you have a pager? -What's that?
Kurt doesn't know what a pager is!
a pager is something all doctors have.
when it beeps, we rush to the hospital and save someone.
I don't have a pager. -No, I bet you don't.
I am a doctor, and I am... Wonderful Copenhagen!
I just Love doctors! Dr. Petter knows so many exciting people.
I talked to the prime minister! Can you imagine?
Dr. Petter wants me to design his new garage.
isn't it wonderful?
I don't think you should talk so much about Dr. Petter.
you should talk about me. I'm the one you're most fond of.
you are most fond of me, right, Anne-Lies?
and you think driving forklifts is extremely important, don't you?
Cheers!

what will Dr. Petter say? -Seven years?!
Rigmor says time is relative. Seven years could only take a minute.

your diamond is worth 60 million kroner.
million?!

fc Rosenberg! Are you the one building illegal racetracks?
why is my racetrack illegal? -It isn't inside!
you can't build racetracks through doctors' houses.
not to mention, you're blocking the road for the prime minister.
fine, give me a ticket. -You still have to remove the track.
I'll pay, you remove the track. -No. That's illegal.
the prime minister has decided that.
you again? -Let me do whatever I want.
I can pay you. I have 60 million.
you have to do as I say. In the big picture, 60 million isn't very much.
if I were prime minister, I'd Let rich people do anything.
well I am the prime minister! And I am nice and popular.
get his track out of my house! -First I want the street cleared.
that's more important.
don't bother the prime minister! -It's OK. Good to see you again.
likewise. Imagine that she remembered me!
I want to be prime minister too. -It isn't that easy.
you have to be elected. -How?
get people to vote for you.
but you don't stand a chance. Because I am nice and popular.
I'm nice and popular too. -Good Luck, then!
let's see...
if I ran for prime minister, would you vote for me?
I don't know. -What do you mean?
I don't know where you stand. -Where I stand?
I'm for everything that's good. -We'll see.
here his family helps out. - " Kill all journalists... "
forget Helena. All she cares about is Satan.
may I take a picture? -Of course.
please move. I only want a picture of the candidate.
forget it, Bud. I'm the one who's going to be prime minister.
but I'm sure you'll be prime minister some day too.
I doubt it.
ladles and gentlemen, please welcome Kurt!
unemployment, improved roads, cheap food from Sweden, taxes!
everyone should be happy, save the environment. Thank you.
Kurt is the best! Kurt is the best!
what about elderly care? -Nothing concerns me more!
elderly care! Elderly care! Elderly care! Elderly care!
elderly care!
elderly care!
and now our second candidate, the prime minister!
you can't vote for her. She can't even stay on her feet!
you tripped her! -Of course. Everything is allowed.
that was a cheap trick. -That was politics.
you have a choice: Vote for me, a nice and popular person,
or vote for Kurt, who is mean.
I'm not mean! You're ugly and smell Like farts!
you smell Like farts!
Kurt is best. Kurt is best...
where are you going? Stay here and watch me win!
no discussion! The prime minister decides!
you'd think a prime minister could expect some support from his family.
what if you Lose? -Only chickens have a plan B.
you should probably be a Little more chicken.
of course I'm going to be prime minister! Right, Bud?
bud?
quiet, here it comes!
let's see how many votes Kurt received.
didn't you vote for me?
it appears as if our buxom friend will remain prime minister.
no, no, no!
not everyone can be prime minister. You're a forklift driver.
but apparently that isn't good enough for any of you!
you're the biggest Loser I've ever met, Kurt!
must be tough Living next to a wonderful man Like me.
I'll show you!
police? No, I'm not calling to praise FC Rosenberg!
Kurt has turned evil!
is there a carpenter here?
I am witnessing some strong scenes from the helicopter.
Kurt is evil!
maybe I should have voted for him.
I don't condone anarchistic behavior.
neither does Rigmor. -I can hear your voices!
I can hear you talk. This is Lovely! Say something else.
my back!
I am pleased, but not surprised, that I became prime minister.
I am much more important than Kurt will ever be.
fc Rosenberg forever!
gotcha! -How incredibIy annoying.
did you really do all this? -Yup, I'm afraid so.
you are neither nice nor popular. Shame on you!
right!
No!
help me!
now you can think about what you have done.
Hey, you.
what are you in for? -I did something bad.
Really? I sold spoiled shrimp.
I put thumbtacks on random chairs.
I tried to crush Parliament. -Did you succeed?
Nope. -Then you sleep on the floor.
kurtis EVIL
Kurt, you are accused of being evil.
what do you have to say?
I regret it bitterly and will never do it again.
I wasn't myself. -You weren't? Who were you?
I wanted to be Like Dr. Petter and the prime minister.
but no one thought I was important, so I snapped and Lost my head.
has that never happened to you?
Yes, actually. -See?
I'll give you a choice:
go back to jail, or pay a fine of 40 million kroner.
I'll pay the fine. -Do you have 40 million?
and 40, 000, 000. There you are.
now go home and think about what you have done.
you betcha!
I've been thinking. I don't think everything was your fault.
you aren't still evil, are you?
aren't you coming in?
no, a Loser Like me deserves to sit on top of a pole.
Hey, is Kurt up there?
what? -Are you coming back to work?
I'm never coming down again! -You can be head forklift driver.
Nope!
how about head chief forklift driver?
with a promotion! -All I need is a grain of rice a day.
goodbye!
but what about the forklift race? It's tomorrow.
how long does he intend to stay up there?
forever.
when he comes down, tell him to get my car out of the pool!
he has more important things to worry about.
don't be rude! I'm paying you to draw my garage.
maybe I don't want to draw your garage!
I hate architects!
Hi, Bud! You're just in time for meditation.
ready, set...
Anne-Lise!
what? -The kindergarten collapsed!
I need my forklift!
Oh, no you don't! Help me with my car first!
this is more important! -More important than my car?
code 449, kindergarten collapse. -I have to help them!
not so fast! I have the pager, I'll help them!
let me on! -No!
let go!
do as the doctor says!
everyone does as the doctor says!
turn!
stop!
you stop!
fc Rosenberg! Help is on its way.
thank God you're here! -No problem.
not you! Dr. Petter!
let the doctor through!
Yes, they are in here.
help us!
do something! - You do something!
this calls for a doctor. -No, a policeman!
doctor! Doctor! -Policeman! Policeman!
don't you...
watch the mustache!
we're all going to die!
focus on your inner self. Your inner self.
look!
your children are safe with the doctor now.
bud! Where's Bud?
Hello? Help!
No! Bud and Rigmor are still in there!
but what about Rigmor?
fine!
get your filthy paws off of me! Bud, run him over!
I hear Laughter is a sign of instability.
bud!
Kurt, you're the best!
Hooray for Kurt! Hooray for Kurt!
you've never been cheered Like that. Kurt is more important.
you haven't been cheered Like that. -FC Rosenberg sure has. Often.
huge breasts, by the way.
he's my dad. And I can hear everything. This is beautiful!
wonderful Copenhagen... I mean...
did you see dad on that forklift? And you are incredibly strong!
mind my hair!
I promise that we will build a new, solid kindergarten.
so that nothing Like this will ever happen again.
thank you, Kurt!
kurtis THE BEST
sorry.
never mind. We're just happy you're moving.
I understand. I didn't fit in here next to you.
isn't that the truth?
is this enough to... repair the damages?
I have a better idea.
kindergarten
nice throw.
please watch your Language, boys!
we're partners three years, you can't put in a good word for me, help me get my job back?
I spent six days in that water when you left me.
I'm going to have my reinstatement hearing this week.
we're allowed to bring character witnesses.
I want you to be mine.
you won't give him a second chance?
well, I'm leaning toward taking him back.
ms. Sweeney, I assume?
Sheldon Lear, TBD Insurance.
you say you were in...
Baton Rouge all day, Ms. Sweeney?
got the call a couple of hours ago.
came right down.
and there are people that can verify that story?
story?
fire marshal hasn't been here yet.
What'd the fire fighters on the scene say?
they don't know what caused it.
do you have any ideas? No one's lived in this house since the storm, you know that.
there's not even electricity.
I don't know what it could have been.
we'll see.
a lot of people in this city burn down their homes to collect on the insurance.
you've got a lot of nerve.
you and your thief company refuse to pay out after Katrina, and now you want to accuse me of being a criminal?
I grew up here.
my daughter took her first steps right over there.
I loved this house.
sorry for your loss.
I paid my premiums all those years and when I need my money, you want to find some loophole not to give it to me?
I asked you not to touch me, Ms. Sweeney.
I am simply doing my job.
your job... Ms. Sweeney...
is to ruin people's lives. Ms. Sweeney!
stay away, Ms. Sweeney. Stay back!
I will defend myself if I have to.
Oh, my God!
you'd think once, just once, they'd have hot water around here.
why don't you just shower at home?
is it really your business, Glue Boy?
all right, everybody,
I think most of y'all know Charlie Pratt.
well, he's one of us now.
Charlie's been away for a while, and despite some troubles we should all be glad that a good cop is back where he belongs.
welcome back.
wouldn't have happened without you.
welcome back.
thank you.
give that some time. Just give it some time.
Charlie, you'll be back on the desk for the first few weeks.
see how we do things at F.A.S. Help out when you can.
whatever you need, sir.
Boulet, grab Cobb.
1701 Warfield, you got yourself a hot one.
you know, over in Afghanistan, we used to have a saying when you ran across a burnt body.
he died smiling.
Yeah, that's heartwarming.
only thing that was left, Boulet, was teeth.
not this guy.
he could've been a toothless, homeless squatter 'cause nobody's lived in this place since Katrina.
you're standing on my evidence.
excuse me?
fire Marshal. I'm here to determine whether this fire was caused by arson or not.
until I do, this house is my evidence.
marlin Boulet, NOPD.
maybe you noticed the French-fried fella we have on the floor here. That's why this investigation got bumped to the top of my list.
I'm working my way through a backlog of burn sites.
this isn't the first accidental death we've seen.
accident? No, this is no accident.
who are you?
Trevor Cobb, F.A.S. We have priority here.
so you can either work with us, or you can wait until we're done.
well, apparently you already figured it out.
so what makes you say this wasn't an accident?
I don't know about the fire, but this guy's got no teeth.
could be homeless.
that's what I said, but even a toothless guy has a couple in their mouth.
come here for one second.
you see how his jaw is cracked?
Mm-hmm. This guy's teeth were bashed in.
I'm guessing before he was burned.
so somebody went through a lot of effort so this man wouldn't be identified by his dental records.
it may be arson, but it's definitely murder.
we got to find out who our vic was.
you know, see what connections pop up.
Charlie, welcome back to the squad.
listen, um...
you dove into that water, man.
you saved my life and I, I don't...
I can't thank you enough.
me and my family.
you got it, man.
hope you would've done the same for me.
anyway, on our vic...
I'm going through missing persons.
anything solid to help me out?
not right now, Charlie, all right?
we'll let you know when we need something, though.
I thought you two were good.
no, we are good, man, it's...
it's not Charlie at all.
it's just that I spent eight years as a unit before I got assigned this squad.
during the storm, he runs off, gets reinstated, back here at F.A.S?
9 o'clock.
heat-seeking missile coming in at 9 o'clock.
officers. - Fire Marshal.
1701 Warfield was definitely arson.
pretty crude job, actually. Splash and dash.
so you came all the way down here to tell us that, huh?
is it all right with you?
it is what it is.
I need to take a look at the victim's body in the morgue.
might reveal some clues that wouldn't show up at the house.
sure. We were just heading over there.
as a matter of fact, my partner, Cobb, was just about to call you and ask you to tag along.
so perfect timing.
Yeah.
a crushed trachea consistent with strangulation.
strangulation?
so our vic was dead before the fire started?
I'm afraid it's a little less pleasant than that, Bou.
uh, scarring on the esophagus suggests our John Doe was still breathing when the house went up in flames.
what about his teeth? - Bashed out.
guessing a metal instrument.
a pipe, like you said, maybe a wrench.
what?
what color are your eyes? I can't tell for sure.
blue.
just barely, though, like, salt-water blue.
did anything pop up in the toxicology screen?
uh, the usual smoky suspects. Uh...
carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, phosgene and one little surprise.
Dihydrazino-s...
...s-tetrazine?
what's that?
it's a chemical accelerant.
where you going?
burn site.
I'm gonna follow up on that.
Yeah.
where there's smoke, there's fire, right?
never mind.
he knew what I was talking about.
Damn!
I burned the steak.
what's this?
$19. 95 for a subscription to Aquarium World?
Yeah, your daughter sold it to us.
school fundraiser.
she likes fish.
you all right?
Yeah, baby.
it's just that we could use a Boulet family fund-raiser around here right about now.
we always manage, Marlin.
Hey, baby... love don't pay the bills.
come on, now, we'll find a way.
I've been driving without car insurance.
when I'm on duty, the department picks it up.
how often am I not on duty?
it's that bad?
I didn't want to tell you anything 'cause I didn't want you to worry, but for the last couple of months I've been juggling, baby.
I've been borrowing this to pay that.
we don't have that much left to juggle.
I'll get a job. - No!
no, we've already talked about this, okay?
tawni, she needs her mama.
besides, whatever money you're gonna make, most of it's gonna be going to some childcare anyway.
look, I'll get some details.
work private security. - No...
Ayana, look, we're not making it on my salary alone.
look, you work 'round the clock as it is.
you start doing details, when you gonna sleep?
4: 00 to 5: 00 a.m?
I don't know, baby.
all I do know is that we need a miracle from up above to come down real soon.
and if it don't...
we're going to have to make some hard decisions.
you sure you don't want to wait and do this in the morning?
I don't like to waste time.
here, hold this.
light that for me.
aren't you a little young to be a fire marshal?
Yeah.
and I got girly parts, too.
what gives, right?
just a question, don't take it the wrong way.
my father was a captain in the NOFD for 20 years.
I grew up around fire.
I know it inside and out.
I was too short to serve on an engine company, so I went after this job.
son of a bitch. Do you see that?
I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
are these from another fire?
six other fires, all arson cases from the past few months.
unlivable houses just like this.
you only had six of those?
no, we've logged close to 180 suspicious fires, citywide.
but these six...
there was something else.
the fires burned out fast, almost too fast. Mm-hmm.
the fires were out before we could even get there.
I had to chalk it up to a fluke because I could never find any evidence.
evidence of what?
a fast-burning accelerant.
a chemical that's used to spread, but not start the fire.
there's a bunch of them out there, but a couple of 'em are self-exterminating, meaning they leave no trace of themselves.
except in a body. - That's right.
right. Our John Doe breathed in dihydrazino-s-tetrazine, which totally fits the bill.
how old are you?
old enough.
Oh, hey, partner.
little spring in your stride this morning?
everything's good.
Boulet, take it easy, buddy.
you couldn't close that deal?
man, I thought she was gonna push Charcoal Man off the table and do you right there in the morgue.
Cobb, how'd you keep her off of you, huh? A Taser?
pepper spray? Or maybe it was just a look from those, uh, salt-water blue eyes.
where are we on that arson/homicide?
here you go.
the fire marshal thinks the same accelerant was used in six other arsons.
the homeowners might've hired the same arsonist to torch their places to get insurance settlements.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Edna Terrabone?
Uh-uh. She's got to be pushing 70 now.
well, it's never too late to cash in.
did it work? - No, that's the thing.
TBD Insurance handled all the claims, and every one was denied.
TBD Insurance? - Yeah.
one of our missing persons worked for them. Hold on.
reported missing Wednesday...
was an insurance adjuster for TBD Insurance.
an insurance adjuster in post-Katrina New Orleans?
Yeah, that oughta narrow down our suspect list, to what-- 20, 30, 000?
so these all the owners of the arson houses?
Yeah.
I say we bring 'em one at a time, Cap.
that'd be best.
we're thinking conspiracy, right? - Mm-hmm.
well, let's see if they look at each other like coconspirators.
okay.
let me get you a more comfortable place to sit.
why don't you just come sit at my desk, back here.
all right. - Okay.
how's retirement treating you?
I still volunteer down at the hospital.
keep busy.
never thought I'd find you sitting across the desk, looking at me the way you're looking at me, Marlin.
how am I looking at you?
like I did something wrong.
what did you think about Brian Studler?
turned down my claim for the flood, then again for the fire.
Edna, I'm not accusing you of anything.
but... I know how it is to be pushed to the edge.
I have spent almost 50 years of my life as a nurse, helping people.
now, why in the world would I undo the work that the good Lord put me on this earth for?
I did not have my house burned down.
and I can't say it no more clearer than that.
thought I was going to Vice, to tell the truth.
it was practically a done deal.
so what happened?
uh, two Vice detectives told me a story, that's what happened.
six months, they're zeroing in on this low-life dealer named C-Saw.
like in the playground?
nice.
they figured out that C-Saw would go to Union Passenger Terminal every other Monday, take a bag from the locker.
same locker every time, number 714.
babe Ruth's home run total, also nice.
glue Boy, let him tell the story.
anyway, they opened the locker, and they find ten grand, cash, so they arrest his ass.
the very next day, not only do they have to kick the guy loose, but they've got to give the money back to him.
what? Does this guy have pictures on the mayor or something?
wild guess.
he was on the Feds' payroll.
exactly. He was an informant, ratting out the cartels.
but still dealing his own drugs.
and that's when I thought to myself, no, thank you. I'd rather go to F. A.S. where when you make an arrest, it sticks.
some of the time.
only some of the time.
man, you're doing a hell of a job so far.
first week on the job, seven suspects in a murder/arson.
not really, 'cause they're all innocent.
you got the hard evidence to back that up?
Edna Terrabone is my hard evidence.
she's telling the truth, and so are the rest of them.
it still doesn't rule out the fire marshal's theory that the same arsonist torched all their homes.
maybe we're dealing with a pyromaniac or a serial arsonist.
but not somebody who was paid by the people we hauled in here today.
this, I know in my bones.
okay.
well, who killed the insurance man?
you guys sure it was Brian?
I mean, burned-up body, no teeth.
Yeah. We pulled some DNA out of his bones.
definitely Brian Studler.
Yeah, poor guy.
well, there's not much to tell you.
what about his personal life?
he have any problems there?
no idea. Show up to work, do your job, that's all I care about.
so, he was a good employee?
eh... Truth is, Brian didn't really have the stomach for this job.
Really?
what makes you say that?
for one, it's dangerous.
baby never leaves my side.
here we go.
danger part of it aside,
Brian also didn't like to deliver bad news, and, frankly, that's mostly what we do here.
who the hell doesn't want a job where you get to say yes, yes, yes all day long?
well, it seems that Brian was Dr. No.
seven fires, seven insurance claims, all denied.
Dr. No? That's my nickname.
compared to me, Brian was Santa Claus.
I'll show you.
Hey. What's this, right here?
Oh. Brian sent a donation or something, so they sent that.
Sunday morning Christian.
spend all day turning everybody down, and send in 20 bucks so he can feel good about himself.
what's this?
I said Brian was Santa Claus?
here's what he left under some people's trees.
four fires, all approved by Brian Studler.
full payouts? - The max.
don't think Brian didn't get his ass chewed about that.
uh, not the real Burt Reynolds.
Loni's great, toupee's great.
heard all the jokes.
my wife says you're with the P.D.
we just have a few questions we want to ask you.
fire away.
those names mean anything to you?
no. But I'll trade names if they want.
Hey, what's this about?
your insurance adjuster, Brian Studler.
you like him?
compared to some of the jerks we've had to deal with since the storm, yeah.
at least he was fair.
more than fair, looks like.
what are you insinuating?
you got a major upgrade here.
most people didn't even get a penny.
I've been through enough without having somebody come here and accuse me of burning down my own house.
it happens, Mr. Reynolds.
crooked insurance adjusters rubber stamp a claim, get a kickback, everybody's happy.
I may have to ask you two to get off my property.
and I may have to remind you that we are New Orleans police.
listen. Brian Studler was a fair and honest man who saved my family's future by doing the right thing.
the fire was an accident caused by a gas can on my lawnmower.
you don't believe it?
ask the fire marshal; she's the one who figured it out.
now, have a good day.
what were those names again?
Frank Coggins and Burt Reynolds.
Loni's doing great.
no. They don't ring a bell.
but, honestly, there are some legit fires in this town once in a while.
I have to pull up my files.
I'll wait.
I had some time to do a little research on DHT.
the accelerant found in the body?
Yeah. It's not something that you can just pick up at your local hardware store.
it's strictly controlled.
I mean, you need a special license to purchase the stuff.
well, that should narrow down our field of suspects.
smokin' Hot Firefighters of Louisiana.
charity thing, to raise money.
I'm February.
february, huh?
that's a nice hat.
look, Cobb...
I'm not big on sending out signals or picking up on signals being sent to me.
so...
or we can go to a hotel, but I'd rather not spend the cash if I don't have to.
unless you want to make it complicated...
the inspector said the mold is a health hazard, so we can't stay here.
all sheetrock, including the foundation.
hell, even the second floor electrical.
we gonna have to gut this place and start all over from scratch.
not from scratch.
Yes, from scratch, Ayana!
now is not the time for us to bury our heads in the sand.
look, I looked into some rentals.
we can't afford a two-bedroom in this neighborhood, so I found this one-bedroom place...
one bedroom, huh?
what's Tawni supposed to do, huh?
sleep on the kitchen floor?
two bedrooms, we can afford Mid-City.
Mid-City.
so now that means that Tawni's going to be going to Kelling Middle School, huh?
they have knife fights at the cafeteria...
I'm just trying to figure this out, Marlin.
I'm sorry, baby.
what we gonna do?
I don't know.
look, this isn't much.
I've been saving it from time to time, you know.
I can't take that.
take this and you get your car insurance.
no. No. - Please.
you can't be taking a chance on that.
I'm sorry, but you got to find another man.
I thought I could do it.
you can do it... and you will do it.
these people are my friends.
no.
they're my brothers and sisters, and they let me back in again.
you said you wanted to be back on the force at any cost, right?
well, this is the cost.
what's this?
it's coffee.
coffee? You bringing me coffee now, man?
you feeling all right?
it's just a cup of coffee.
Mm-mm! No, this is not just coffee.
this is a cafe au lait from CC's.
this is the best damn coffee in this whole parish.
Oh, I get it...
what?
your sunny, generous disposition.
could we have had a breakthrough last night in our "interagency cooperation" with the fire department?
can we just please get to work? - No, we may not.
because I'm going to savor in the moment that my partner, who I thought lived in a stone room and slept on...
all right, hold on a minute...gave up his vow of chastity to get down to business.
let's get down to this business.
Oh, okay. The floor is all yours.
I've said my peace, Friar Cobb.
Eileen said that...
go on.
she said the accelerant that was used to start the fires...was Dihydrazino-s-tetrazine.
it's pretty exotic stuff.
you need a license to buy it.
I cross-referenced the permits against our list of owners whose houses were torched.
I got one hit.
chemical engineer for Shore Petroleum.
one of four winners in our arson lottery.
the insurance company paid out.
the maximum benefit.
it's a good thing you got this to go, partner.
let's go pay him a visit.
Hey, hey, come on, come on, come on.
that's my kid's stuff.
Yeah, well, if you tell us where you're hiding the stuff at your kids won't come home to the traumatizing sight of their Care Bears assuming the position.
I don't even know what you want.
read the warrant.
the dihydro...
the didro... Boulet.
Dihydrazino-s-tetrazine.
and you have a license to buy it.
what the hell do I want DHT for?
it's a, it's a high-nitrogen compound.
it is used to make fireworks.
sounds like an expert.
Mr. Wizard. Yeah.
good thing you did using the DHT.
it burns clean.
doesn't even leave a trace.
so, the insurance company sees no sign of arson.
you get a big check.
and you rebuild your lovely little home.
come on, man.
money's tight. You got no place to live
and all you have to do is light a match.
you're crazy.
Hey, hey, what about the body? Studler?
you must have really hated the guy to do what you did to him.
something funny?
Yeah.
I find that hard to believe.
I was getting ready to pack up and move.
I had a job offer in Houston.
better pay, good schools, they're gonna transfer my 401k.
I mean, score, right?
but then the insurance company calls me,
it started in the hot water heater. You're covered!
my wife is thrilled.
we get to stay here and be close to her mother in Gretna.
I was close... I was so close.
nothing, man.
the most flammable thing in this place is a bottle of cheap aftershave.
let's go.
man.
smokin'.
word travels fast.
not from me.
I don't mind.
listen, I took a second look at those four fires you asked me about, the ones the insurance company paid out on...
right.
if they weren't an accident, somebody did a really good job covering them up.
not like our clumsy firebug that we're after.
but...
they do have something in common with the seven other torch jobs.
I can't prove it, but all four of those fires burned really fast.
which got me thinking...
we've been looking at DHT as a weapon that eliminates itself, leaves no trace, but there's another reason to use it.
What're you doing?
here.
an emotional reason.
Oh, oh, it's all right, it's all right.
burns out fast.
safe.
destroys the house, but doesn't destroy any of the houses around it.
very considerate of him.
Yeah, which doesn't exactly fit the profile, does it?
what is the profile?
the typical serial arsonist is white, male, has a troubled psychological history that sometimes extends back into childhood.
they have a need to control, to dominate.
sometimes revenge is a motive...
what, against a person?
could be a person, could be society, that they feel holds them back, holds them down.
another motive is excitement.
excitement, huh?
sexual excitement.
they need to watch.
that's why so many of them show up at the fire scene, to see the fruits of their labor.
but that's the typical arsonist,
I mean, he ain't that typical.
he's extra careful, extra safe.
he doesn't sound like the type of guy that would strangle somebody or bash their teeth out.
no.
that's why I'm thinking we're dealing with two different perpetrators
a killer, and an arsonist.
they open the locker, they find ten grand, cash.
can I help you?
it's cool, fella.
NOPD.
is there a problem, Officer? - No.
just doing a walk-through.
routine.
have a good night.
knock yourself out.
Hey, Officer.
yeah?
I just wanted to say thank you.
I mean you guys took a lot of heat after the storm, and a lot of it unfairly.
but I appreciate all you're doing to clean up our city.
you okay?
Yeah.
thank you.
meant a lot.
Charlie, what are you doing here?
all that big talk...
you telling me I was a coward 'cause I went to look after my family.
Charlie, what are you doin' here?
saying how I betrayed you.
answer me... And you took the bait!
bait?
what the hell are...
I'll be damned.
you're workin' for P.I.B.
that's how you got promoted so fast.
you're policing the cops. You ain't nothing but a rat.
you're gonna call me that? After what I saw you do?
look, I ain't did nothin'.
money in that locker was an integrity check, Marlin.
it was a set-up. Embry wanted me to spread the word, chum the water-- see who went for it.
I never thought it'd be you.
I knew you wanted to be back on the force, man, but to turn on your brothers, just so you could wear a badge? Hey.
don't get it twisted.
and dirty cops aren't my brothers.
and I ain't dirty. - Then what the hell are you doing?
I didn't take the money, Charlie, did I?
did I?
my house is rotted to the studs, Charlie.
me, my family, we're not doing too good right now.
and I thought, just for a second, all this money they're giving to these drug dealers...
why couldn't I take it and just bring it home to my family?
I'm not dirty, Charlie.
and you know that.
so what do we do now?
there's a surveillance camera in there watching the lockers.
a camera?
it's all over now, man.
it's all over now. It's automated.
no one's monitoring it except for me.
I'll take care of the camera.
thank you.
thank you.
Hey.
I was kind of hoping I might...see you. What's this?
it's your juvenile arrest record.
it took some doing, especially at this hour, but I managed to unseal it.
what the hell is this about?
why don't you tell me?
when you were running down your psych profile on arsonists, you left out one obvious warning sign.
a history of starting fires.
I was 15 years old.
I was acting out against my father, who was a controlling son of a bitch, if you must know, and who also happened to be a firefighter, so, what better way to piss him off than to light a little fire in the backyard and make his buddies from the fire station come down and put it out?
was that the only time? Hmm?
you have the technical knowledge to start those fires, and your reports cleared all four homeowners, and they got paid off.
are you actually accusing me of being an arsonist?
no, Eileen.
I'm trying to eliminate you as a suspect.
I know this character Ernie Weiss must have something to do with this. - Chemist?
Yeah. Chemical engineer.
he had access to the exact accelerant used in these fires.
married, two kids, and a Masters in chemical engineering from Tulane in 1995.
worked for Sopher Chemical until they went bankrupt in '99, then landed on his feet at Shore Petroleum the following year.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
you said the first company he worked for went bankrupt?
Yeah. Sopher Chemical.
we spoke to a guy who said his company went bust, too.
in '99. Uh...
but not the Burt Reynolds, but Burt Reynolds.
come on, find the file.
Yeah, here it is.
he worked corporate security, Sopher Chemical, 1992 to 1999.
he told me he didn't know the other guys whose houses got burned.
maybe he didn't. Sopher was a big company.
Yeah. Not that big. Look, look at this.
here we are.
Coggins and Zarubi, the other two homeowners whose fire claims were paid in full.
let me guess.
Sopher Chemical.
is this how you conduct all your investigations, Detective?
sleep with your suspect?
I want an explanation.
Yes.
I'm fascinated with fire.
I always have been.
I love everything about it.
the way it moves, the way it lives, how you control it.
that's why I got into this business.
that's why I worked my ass off to make it in a man's profession, so that I could do what I loved.
you want to arrest me, go ahead...
but I'm not going to apologize for who I am.
Yeah.
looks like Mr. Wizard's our guy after all.
the four guys whose claims got paid by Studler they worked for the same company.
they knew each other, man.
all of 'em know one another.
I'm heading to Weiss' house now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm en route right now.
what's going on?
around the back. Sounds like there's just two of them.
Yeah, I guess it's a little late for a barbecue, huh?
Yeah. Hey, go over there.
Charlie and I'll take this side.
look, Burt, I'm not going to say anything, all right?
keep your voice down.
now write.
to my dear family and friends.
I am so sorry...
do you hear me?
I-I... I can't do it, Burt, 'cause you're just going to kill me if I write it anyway.
think about what I'm going to do if you don't write it.
your kids and your wife-- they're in the house, right?
no. This was your idea, Burt.
you killed Studler.
I didn't even know his body was in the house!
you go to hell! - Freeze!
easy. Easy.
police officers. Put the gun down.
Burt and Ernie.
how could I not see that?
back off, or I'll kill him.
no, you won't, because if you shoot him,
I'm going to shoot you.
listen to him, Burt.
drop your weapon.
you don't understand this.
no. I think I do.
you were just trying to protect your family.
am I right?
just trying to put a roof over their head.
but what happens to your family when you force us to blow you away?
what happens then, Burt?
come on.
just put it down.
right here.
it was Burt's idea.
he told Brian it was a win-win.
we get our houses rebuilt, and Brian gets to feel like he's actually doing something good for a change.
so, you used the DHT to make sure the fires wouldn't spread?
Yeah, make sure there was no sign of arson.
that way, Brian could pay the claims and be totally in the clear.
he joked he-he felt like Robin Hood.
Yeah.
so, how did he end up dead?
Burt realized it would only draw attention to us if we only burned our own houses.
Mm-hmm. You needed the fires to look clumsy, like they'd been set.
so, Studler could deny the claims.
Yeah, Burt called them the sacrificial lambs.
Yeah. Like Edna Terrabone.
when Brian found out about it, he flipped, he threatened to go to the police, and I-I guess...
I didn't even know there was a body in the house.
okay? I was just supposed to burn it, make it look clumsy, like arson, and Brian could deny the claim.
I didn't even know he was dead. I...
one of your own people knew they were burning down folks' houses?
that's not going to look good in a lawsuit.
good thing you boys got deep pockets.
you got any antacid?
I was hoping to get one of those calendars.
sorry. Fresh out.
might be able to get you a copy
I hear they had a lot left over.
Nah, I think I'll pass.
look, maybe it's the job, but I tend to think the worst of people.
just forget about it, all right?
the point is, I'm sorry.
that's all I came here to say.
I should be the last person judging anybody by their past.
well, see you around.
I'll get you a copy of that calendar.
it broke?
Yeah, it did, Captain.
and if I can speak frankly, it pisses me off.
I mean, it's hard enough to do what I'm doing.
I go in there to check the camera, and there's chewed-up videotape all over the damn place.
that's typical.
everything in this department is second-hand and broken down.
but the money's still there, right?
nobody touched it.
all right, well, you stay on it.
then we'll get you a new camera.
you find out anything else?
no, sir.
you're doing the right thing, Charlie.
look, I can't clean up the whole department, but in my little corner of it-- I won't stand for a bad cop.
and I'm not talking about somebody accidentally busting a door open every now and then.
there's somebody rotten out there.
and when we find out who that guy is, he's going down hard.
it's coming along so nice.
Hey, baby!
what the hell is all this?
well, you wanted a miracle, baby.
Hello, Marlin.
Hey, Edna.
Edna, what-what is this?
they wanted to say thank you.
for what?
well, since you were the one that found out that insurance man was involved in those fires.
in fact, they were so scared that we was gonna sue their butts, they were more than generous.
Edna, that's good for you, but, you know, I-I still don't understand...
I thought you were a bright young man, Marlin Boulet.
now, we all heard you was moving. - Yes.
and since you helped us get our homes back, we wanted to help you keep yours, so we all chipped in with our settlement checks to help fix up this place.
Hey, Edna, you didn't have to...
I know we didn't, baby.
you okay?
I'm fine, baby.
good.

december 24th, 1989, 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
from here on in, I shoot without a script.
see if anything comes of it...
...instead of my old shit.
no, get out of here. Hey.
I said, get off the window.
how do you document real life
when real life's getting more like fiction each day?
headlines, bread lines blow my mind,
and now this deadline Eviction or pay rent.
how do you write a song when the chords sound wrong?
though they once sounded right and rare
when the notes are sour where is the power you once had to ignite the air?
we're hungry and frozen - Some life we've chosen - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay?
how we gonna pay - How we gonna pay - Last year's rent? - Last year's rent?
Hello? - Hey, guess who's back in town.
it's Collins, man. Throw down the key. Cool.
Hey.
you got a light, man? - Yeah.
give me that shit. - Come here, man.
get that son of a bitch.
pick his ass up. Come on.
how do you start a fire when there's nothing to burn
and it feels like something's stuck In your flue?
how can you generate heat when you can't feel your feet - And they're turning blue? - And they're turning blue?
you light up a mean blaze - With posters - And screenplays - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay?
how we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay?
how we gonna pay - How we gonna pay - Last year's rent? - Last year's rent?
how do you stay on your feet when on every street It's trick or treat

everything's brown and, uh-oh, I feel sick - Where is he? - Getting dizzy - How we gonna pay? - How we gonna pay?
how we gonna pay?
how we gonna pay
last year's rent?
the music ignites the night with passionate fire
the narration crackles and pops with incendiary wit
zoom in as they burn the past to the ground
and feel the heat of the future's glow
how do you leave the past behind
when it keeps finding ways to get to your heart?
it reaches way down deep And tears you inside out till you're torn apart rent
how can you connect in an age where strangers, landlords, lovers your own blood cells betray?
what binds the fabric together when the raging, shifting winds Of change keep ripping away?
draw a line in the sand and then make a stand - Use your camera to spar - Use your guitar
when they act tough you call their bluff
we're not gonna pay
we're not gonna pay
we're not gonna pay
last year's rent
this year's rent
next year's rent
rent, rent, rent, rent, rent
we're not gonna pay rent 'cause everything is rent
Hey.
bum.
get your ass off the Range Rover.
Benny, that attitude toward...
...the homeless is exactly what Maureen is protesting.
Maureen is protesting losing her performance space...
...not my attitude.
come down, I wanna talk to you.
close-up, Benjamin Coffin III. Our ex-roommate...
...who married Allison Grey of the Westport Greys.
his father-in-law bought several buildings on the block...
...and a nearby vacant lot, home to Tent City.
Benny hopes to evict all of the homeless from Tent City...
...and build a cyber studio.
Roger, you're looking good for a guy coming off of a year of withdrawal.
what do you want, Benny? - Well, my investor...
you mean, your father-in-law? - Right.
read about Maureen's performance in the Village Voice.
got pissed and sent me down here to collect the rent.
what rent? - This past year's rent, which I let slide.
you said we were golden.
when you bought the building. - We were roommates.
remember, you lived here? - How could I forget?
you, me, Collins and Maureen.
how is the drama queen?
she's getting ready for a performance. - I know.
still her production manager? - Not exactly.
still dating her? - I was dumped.
she got a new man? - Well...
no. - What's his name?
thanks for being so understanding.
you expect sympathy from the guy...
...who shut off our power on Christmas Eve?
got your attention, didn't it?
what happened to Benny?
what happened to his heart and the ideals he once pursued?
any owner of that lot next door has a right to do with it as he pleases
happy birthday, Jesus - The rent - You're wasting your time - We're broke - You broke your word, this is absurd
there is one way you won't have to pay - I knew it. - Next door, the home of CyberArts
and now that the block is rezoned our dream can become a reality
you'll see, boys
you'll see, boys
a state-of-the-art, digital, virtual interactive studio
I'll forgo your rent and on paper guarantee
that you can stay here for free - lf you do me one small favor. - What?
convince Maureen to cancel her protest.
why not just get an injunction or call the cops?
I did, and they're on standby.
but my investors would rather I handle this quietly
you can't quietly wipe out an entire tent city...
...then watch "It's A Wonderful Life" on TV.
you wanna produce films and write songs?
you need somewhere to do it
it's what we used to dream about Think twice before you pooh-pooh it
you'll see, boys
you'll see, boys
you'll see the beauty of a studio
that lets us do our work and get paid
with condos on the top whose rent keeps open our shop
just stop the protest and you'll have it made
you'll see
or you'll pack.
here you go.
merry Christmas.
Hello?
Oh, my God. You okay, honey?
I'm afraid so. - Did they get anything, or...?
I didn't have any money, but they took my stuff.
no, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm Angel.
friends call me Collins.
come on. Let's get you cleaned up.
I sort of have to hurry.
I have a Life Support meeting. - Life Support?
Yeah.
it's for people with AIDS.
people like me.
me too.
I was gonna go try to find Collins.
you wanna come?
I thought maybe we could all grab some dinner.
zoom in on my empty wallet.
Touche.
take your AZT.
I'm writing one great song Before I...
one song Glory
one song before I go
glory One song to leave behind
find one song
one last refrain
glory from the pretty-boy front man who wasted opportunity
one song he had the world at his feet
glory in the eyes of a young girl
a young girl
find glory
beyond the cheap colored lights
one song before the sun sets
glory
on another empty life
time flies
time dies
glory
one blaze of glory
one blaze of glory
glory
find glory
in a song that rings true truth like a blazing fire
an eternal flame
find one song
a song about love glory
from the soul of a young man
a young man
find the one song before the virus takes hold
glory like a sunset
one song to redeem this empty life
time flies
and then no need to endure anymore
time dies - What'd you forget? - Got a light?
I know you, you're...
you're shivering
it's nothing they turned off my heat
and I'm just a little weak on my feet Would you light my candle?
what are you staring at? - Nothing
your hair in the moonlight
you look familiar - Can you make it? - Just haven't eaten much today
at least the room stopped spinning anyway - What? - Nothing - Your smile reminded me of... - I always remind people of
who is she? - She died - Her name was April - It's out again
sorry 'bout your friend Would you light my candle?
well? - Yeah?
Oh, the wax - It's... - Dripping - I like it between my... - Fingers
I figured
Oh, well, good night - It blew out again? - No, I think that I dropped my stash
I know I've seen you out and about
when I used to go out
your candle's out
I'm illin' I had it when I walked in the door
it was pure Is it on the floor?
the floor?
they say that I have the best ass below 14th Street - Is it true? - What?
you're staring again - Oh, no
I mean, you do have a nice...
I mean, you look familiar - Like your dead girlfriend - Only when you smile
but I'm sure I've seen you somewhere else
do you go to the Cat Scratch Club? That's where I work
I dance
Yes, they used to tie you up
it's a living
I didn't recognize you without the handcuffs
we could light the candle
Oh, won't you light the candle?
why don't you forget that stuff - You look like you're 16 - I'm 19
but I'm old for my age I'm just born to be bad
I once was born to be bad I used to shiver like that - I have no heat, I told you - I used to sweat - I got a cold - Uh-huh, I used to be a junkie - But now and then I like to feel good - Uh-huh - Oh, here - What's that?
candy-bar wrapper.
we could light the candle
Oh, what'd you do with my candle?
that was my last match - Our eyes'll adjust - Thank God for the moon - Maybe it's not the moon at all
I hear Spike Lee's shootin' Down the street
bah humbug
bah humbug - Cold hands - Yours too
big Like my father's
do you wanna dance?
with you?
no, with my father - I'm Roger
they call me
they call me Mimi
we got power.
merry Christmas.
speak. - Speak.
mark, are you there?
are you screening your calls? It's Mom.
I just wanted to call and say we love you. We'll miss you today.
Cindy and the kids are here. They send their love.
hope you like the hot plate. Don't leave it on when you leave the house.
honey, give me the phone. - Oh, here's Dad.
listen, Mark, I'm sorry to hear that Maureen dumped you.
I say, c'est la vie. Let her be a lesbian.
she doesn't know what she's missing.
happy holidays.
you know...
...there are times when we're dirt broke...
...and hungry and freezing...
...and I ask myself, "Why the hell am I still living here?"
and then they call. And I remember.
what's that?
the girl downstairs.
Oh, the dancer from the Cat Scratch Club?
well, you are going, right? - No.
Oh, come on, Roger. - No.
merry Christmas, bitches. - Hey, Collins.
your keys. - Yeah, 14 hours later.
what the hell happened to you? Are you all right?
I've never been better. Here.
Oh, hi.
Oh, hi. After seven months? - I'm sorry.
you know what you need? This boy could use...
...some Stoli. - This is a complete Christmas feast.
thank you. - You struck gold at MIT.
no.
they expelled me for my theory of actual reality.
one for you. One for you.
Oh, wait.
for me.
so I came back home. Merry Christmas.
Cheers. - Welcome home.
I got a teaching gig at NYU.
Oh, so that's how you can afford to splurge on us.
no. Sit down.
gentlemen, our benefactor On this Christmas day
whose charity is only matched By talent, I must say
a new member of the Alphabet City Avant-garde
today for you Tomorrow for me
today for you Tomorrow for me - And you should hear her beat - You earned this on the street?
it was my lucky day today On Avenue A
when a lady in a limousine drove my way
she said, Darling, be a dear haven't slept in a year
I need your help to make my neighbor's yappy dog disappear
this Akita, Evita, just won't shut up I believe if you play nonstop
that pup will breathe its very last high-strung breath
I'm certain that cur will bark itself to death
today for you Tomorrow for me
today for you Tomorrow for me
we agreed on a fee $ 1000 guarantee, tax free
and a bonus if I trim her tree
now, who could foretell That it would go so well?
but sure as I am here that dog is now in doggy hell
after an hour, Evita, in all her glory
on the window ledge Of that 23rd story
like Thelma and Louise did when they got the blues
Swan-dove into the courtyard Of the Gracie Mews
today for you Tomorrow for me
today for you Tomorrow for me
back on the street where I met my sweet
where he was moaning and groaning on the cold concrete
the nurse took him home for some Mercurochrome
then I dressed his wounds and got him back on his feet
sing it Today for you
tomorrow for me
today for you Tomorrow for me
I say Today for you
tomorrow for me Today for you
tomorrow
for me
that was dope.
that was fresh.
speak. - Speak.
mark. Hi.
it's me. Maureen. Look, I have a bit of a problem.
I really need your help.
I hired Joanne as my production manager...
...and I don't think she knows what the hell she's doing.
if you could just... Please, baby, come to the performance space.
Hey, Maureen. Hi. - Hi, baby.
sure, I'll be there. - Thank you.
okay. - Thank you.
okay, see you soon.
can you believe her? I mean, first she just dumps me...
Maureen dumped you? - Yes. She dumped me.
for a lawyer named Joanne.
now she wants me to help her fix her sound equipment.
well, Mark, you could've said no. - I know, but...
that's cute. You still love her. - Yeah, right.
you do.
we have to go. - Wanna go to this gathering?
where? - Life Support.
on Christmas?
some people don't have anywhere else to go today.
you should come.
knock yourselves out.
everyone's welcome. It's not just for people with AIDS.
okay, yeah, I'll be there, but first I got a protest to save.
see? Told you.
I'm just playing with you, boy.
well, it's Christmas.
don't stay in the house all day.
Bye.
Hi.
Maureen called me to try to come help fix the equipment.
you're Mark?
Maureen said she'd be here. - Well, don't hold your breath.
this is so typical.
I told her not to call you.
Oh, well...
can I help anyway?
I've hired an engineer.
great.
well, nice to have met you, then.
he's three hours late.
the samples won't delay but the cable...
there's another way say something, anything
test, one, two, three
anything but that - This is weird - It's weird - Very weird - Fuckin' weird
I'm so mad that I don't know what to do
fighting with microphones freezing down to my bones
and to top it all off I'm with you
feel like going insane? Got a fire in your brain?
and you're thinking of drinking gasoline?
as a matter of fact - Honey, I know this act
it's called the Tango: Maureen
the Tango: Maureen
it's a dark, dizzy merry-go-round - As she keeps you dangling - You're wrong - Your heart she is mangling - It's different with me
and you toss and you turn 'cause her cold eyes can burn
yet you yearn, and you churn and rebound
I think I know what you mean - The Tango: Maureen - The Tango: Maureen
has she ever pouted her lips and called you "pookie"?
never.
have you ever doubted a kiss or two?
this is spooky
did you swoon when she walked through the door?
every time, so be cautious
did she moon over other boys?
more than moon - I'm getting nauseous
Where'd you learn to tango?
with the French ambassador's daughter in her room at Miss Porter's.
and you?
with Nanette Himmelfarb, the Rabbi's daughter...
...at the Scarsdale Jewish Community Center.
it's hard to do this backwards.
you should try it in heels.
she cheated - She cheated - Maureen cheated - Fuckin' cheated
I'm defeated I should give up right now
gotta look on the bright side with all of your might
I'd fall for her still, anyhow
when you're dancing her dance you don't stand a chance
her grip of romance makes you fall - So you think, "Might as well" - "Dance a tango to hell"
at least I'll have tangoed at all
the Tango: Maureen
gotta dance till your diva is through
you pretend to believe her 'cause in the end you can't leave her
but the end, it will come still you have to play dumb
till you're glum and you bum and turn blue
why do we love when she's mean?
and she can be so obscene
my Maureen
the Tango:
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
actually...
...I feel great now.
I feel lousy.
and we're patched.
Thanks.
Maureen? - Hi, baby.
Hi, honey, we're... - Pookie.
Pookie?
you never called me pook... - We're late.
forget it.
we're patched. - Thank you.
Pookie.
shut up.
okay, everyone, let's begin.
first, I just want to welcome you all.
why don't we start by going around and introducing ourselves.
Hi.
I'm Angel.
I'm Paul.
sorry.
excuse me.
and you are...?
Oh, I'm not... I don't have...
I'm here with...
I'm just here to...
mark. I'm Mark.
well, this is quite an operation.
does anyone have a problem...
...if I film a little of this for a documentary?
make yourself comfortable, Mark.
who wants to begin?
well, I'm...
yesterday...
...I found out my T cells were low.
what was your reaction?
scared.
how are you feeling today? Right now?
okay.
all right.
pretty good.
is that all?
it's the best I've felt in a long time.
months. - Then why choose fear?
I'm a New Yorker.
fear's my life.
look, I find some of what you teach suspect
because I'm used to relying on intellect
but I try to open up to what I don't know
because reason says I should have died three years ago
there's only us
there's only this
forget regret
or life is yours to miss
no other road
no other way
no day but today
what's the time?
well, it's gotta be close to midnight
my body's talking to me It says, time for danger
it says, I wanna commit a crime
wanna be the cause of a fight
I wanna put on a tight skirt
and flirt with a stranger
I've had a knack from way back
at breaking the rules once I learn the game
get up, life's too quick I know someplace sick
where this chick'll dance in the flames
we don't need any money
I always get in for free
you can get in too
if you get in with me
let's go
out tonight
I have to go
out tonight
you wanna play? Let's run away
we won't be back before it's New Year's Day
take me out tonight
when I get a wink from the doorman
do you know how lucky you'll be?
that you're on the line with the feline of Avenue B
let's go
out tonight
I have to go
out tonight
you wanna prowl? Be my night owl?
well, take my hand we're gonna
howl out tonight
in the evening I've got to roam
can't sleep in the city of neon and chrome
feels too damn much like home when the Spanish babies cry
so let's find a bar
so dark we forget who we are
where all the scars from the nevers and maybes die
let's go
out tonight
I have to go
out tonight
you're sweet wanna hit the street?
wanna wail at the moon like a cat in heat?
just take me
out tonight
please take me
out tonight
don't forsake me
out tonight
I'll let you make me
out tonight
tonight
tonight
tonight
who do you think you are?
barging in on me and my guitar
little girl, hey, the door is that way
you better go you know the fire's out anyway
take your powder Take your candle
your sweet whisper I just can't handle
well, take your hair In the moonlight
your brown eyes Goodbye, good night
I should tell you I should tell you
I should tell you, I should... No.
another time, another place
our temperature would climb there'd be a long embrace
we'd do another dance It'd be another play
looking for romance?
come back another day
another day
the heart may freeze
or it can burn
the pain will ease
if I can learn
there is no future
there is no past
I live this moment as my last
there's only us
there's only this
forget regret
or life is yours to miss
no other road
no other way
no day but today
excuse me if I'm off track
but if you're so wise then tell me
why do you need smack?
take your needle
take your fancy prayer
don't forget, get the moonlight out of your hair
long ago you might have lit up my heart
but the fire's dead ain't never ever gonna start
another time Another place
the words would only rhyme We'd be in outer space
it'd be another song We'd sing another way
you wanna prove me wrong? Come back another day
another day
there's only yes
only tonight
we must let go
to know what's right
no other course
no other way
no day but today
I can't control
control your temper
my destiny
she doesn't see
I trust my soul - Who says that there's a soul? - My only goal
is just to be
just let me be - Who do you think you are? - There's only now, there's only here - Barging in on me and my guitar - Give in to love, or live in fear - Little girl, hey - No other path - The door is that way - No other way
no day but today
the fire's out anyway
no day but today
take your powder Take your candle
no day but today
take your brown eyes, your pretty smile, your silhouette
no day but today
another time, another place, Another rhyme, a warm embrace
no day but today
another dance, another way, another chance
another day
no day but today - Speak. - Speak.
mark, Roger, it's Benny.

so you're a tough guy?
no. Not really.
that's pretty good.
over there. The guy with the glasses.
right there.
Oh, my God, you look so good.
last night I had a dream.
I found myself in a desert called Cyberland.
it was hot.
my canteen had sprung a leak, and I was...
...thirsty.
out of the abyss walked a cow.
Elsie.
I asked if she had anything to drink. She said:
I'm forbidden to produce milk
in Cyberland we only drink
diet Coke
she said:
only thing to do
is jump over the moon
I
gotta get out of here
it's like I'm being tied to the hood of a yellow rental truck
being packed in with fertilizer and fuel oil
pushed over a cliff by a suicidal Mickey Mouse
I've
gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
gotta, gotta find a way
to jump over the moon
only thing to do Is jump over the moon
then a little bulldog entered.
his name, we have learned, was Benny.
and although he once had principles...
...he abandoned them to live as a lapdog...
...to a wealthy daughter of the revolution.
a one, two, three "That's bull," he said "Ever since the cat took up the fiddle That cow's been jumpy"
the dish and the spoon were evicted from the table and eloped
she's had trouble with that milk and the moon ever since
maybe it's a female thing 'cause who'd wanna leave Cyberland anyway?
walls ain't so bad
the dish and the spoon, for instance, they're down on their luck
they come knockin' on my doghouse door
and I say, Not in my back yard, utensils.
go back to China
the only way out is up, Elsie whispered to me.
a leap - Yeah. - That's it.
still thirsty?
parched.
have some milk.
and I lowered myself beneath her swollen udder...
...and I sucked the sweetest milk I had ever tasted.
climb onboard, she said.
and as a harvest moon rose over Cyberland...
...we reared back, we sprang into a gallop...
...leaping out of orbit.
I awoke, singing...
leap of faith Leap of faith
leap of faith Leap of faith
only thing to do
only thing to do is jump
over the moon
over the...
moo with me.
Yes. Who is that? Come on. Moo with me.
Yes. Come on, sir.

Yes. Let it go, New York City.

guilty as charged. But we are a news show.
and your client has a fresh eye to bring real stories to an audience...
...and that's what we want.
we get the real programming...
...he gets the network exposure. Not a bad way to start a career, by the way.
so, what do you think?
Yes. What about salary?
on commission.
on an escalating scale. Start at $3000.
you're not gonna get a better deal than that.
we'II take it.
Congratulations.
I sold my soul. -For 3 grand a segment.

I'II do anything. You want me to be your slave?
you want me to just obey your every wish?

commitment.
that's all?
why didn't you say so in the first place?
what?
aII you have to do is ask...
...and I'm yours.
will you commit to me?
to be with only me for the rest of our Iives?
I will.
I do.
this can't be happening.
I'd Iike to welcome everyone...
...and congratulate my daughter Joanne.

Hi.

Where'd you get this necklace? -Oh, just downtown.
could you excuse me for a minute?
Hi. Could you excuse us a minute? -Hi, baby.

Maureen, please, do not do this today.
excuse me, sir, can you hold this, please?
certainly. -Thanks.
you know what, Miss Ivy League?
I can't take much more of this.
this obsessive-compulsive, control-freak paranoia.
what? -I didn't pierce my nipples...
...because it grossed you out.
I didn't stay at the Kink CIub Iast night because you wanted to go home.
you flirted with the woman in rubber.
there will always be women in rubber flirting with me.

who I was meant to be
and if you give a damn
take me, baby, or leave me
no way can I be what I'm not
but, hey, don't you want your girl hot?
don't fight .Don't lose your head 'Cause every night
who's in your bed? Who?
who's in your bed?
kiss, Pookie. -It won't work.
I look before I leap
I love margins and discipline
I make lists in my sleep, baby what's my sin?
never quit I follow through
I hate mess but I love you
what to do with my impromptu baby
so be wise 'Cause this girl satisfies
you've got a prize but don't compromise
you're one lucky baby - Take me for what I am -A control freak.
who I was meant to be -A snob, yet overattentive.
and if you give a damn -A Iovable, droll geek.
take me, baby, or leave me -An anal-retentive.
that's it -That's it
the straw that breaks my back -I quit -I quit
unless you take it back -Women -Women
what is it about them?
can't live with them or without them -Can't live with them or without them - Take me for what I am - Take me for what I am -Who I was meant to be -Who I was meant to be -And if you give a damn -And if you give a damn
you better take me, baby -Oh, take me, baby -Or leave me
take me or leave me -Take me, baby -Take me, baby -Or leave me -Or leave me -Guess I'm leaving -Guess I'm leaving -I'm gone -I'm gone
maybe now you two can get back together.
well, actually, I'm-- -Come on, Iet's go.
Hey, guys, all our shit's back.
Benny, what's going on?
I'm here to put an end to this war.
what changed your mind? -Mimi did, actually.
we hadn't seen each other in a while. So we had dinner, we talked...
...and she convinced me to rethink the situation.
look, I regret the unlucky circumstances
circumstance? Benny, you padlocked our door...
...and you took all of our stuff. -Right.
which is why I'm here offering a new Iease. AII right?

look, we don't need your charity.
should cover us for a Iittle while.
Where'd you get this?
it's my first advance.
okay. Congratulations.
excuse me.
Roger...
...nothing happened.
Benny and me, it's over. We had a thing once...
...but it was two years ago. -It doesn't matter.
it was before I met you. -I don't care.

it's right...
...that today's Halloween.
it was Angel's favorite holiday.
I knew we'd hit it off the moment we met.
there was this skinhead that was harassing her...
...and she just walked right up to him and said:
I'm more of a man than you'II ever be...
...and more of a woman than you'II ever get.
and then there was this time...
...he walked up to this group of tourists...
...and they were petrified...
...Because, A, they were obviously Iost...
...And, B, had probably never spoken to a drag queen before in their Iives.
and he...
she...
...just offered to escort them out of AIphabet City...
...and then Iet them take a picture with her...
...and then said she'd help them find the circle line.
so much more original than any of us.
you'd find an old tablecloth on the street and make a dress...
...and then the next year, sure enough...
...They'd be mass-producing them at the gap.
you always said how Iucky you were that we were all friends...
...but it was us, baby...
...who were the Iucky ones.
live in my house
I'll be your shelter
just pay me back
with 1000 kisses

you said you'd never speak to him again -Not now. -Who said that you have any say -In who she says things to at all? -Yeah.

we used to have this fight each night -Calm down -She'd never admit I existed -Everyone, please

but love's not a three-way street
you'll never share real love
until you love yourself I should know
you all said you'd be cool today
so please, for my sake
I can't believe he's gone
I can't believe you're going
I can't believe this family must die
angel helped us believe in love
I can't believe you disagree
I can't believe this is
goodbye

that drip of hurt
that pint of shame
goes away Just play the game

Hey, guys, it's Benny.
look, I was wondering if you've seen Mimi.
I haven't seen her in a couple of weeks.
she dropped out of rehab...
...and I'm afraid that she may have started using again.
if you find out anything, let me know. -Hi, Roger, Mark...
...It's Maureen. Still no sign of Mimi. -I just wanna know if she's all right.
Joanne and I printed up some fliers. -Hey, it's Collins. Just checking in.
I'll call back if we hear anything. - You heard from Mimi?
Roger, I spoke to the manager of the Cat Scratch Club.
she hasn't shown up for work. -Roger, are you there?
look, I just went to the police station and I filed a missing-persons report.
I spoke to a friend of Mimi's who said she saw her three weeks ago.
she hasn't picked up her AZT in a while.
she's been living on the street. -Couple of weeks.
it's Collins again. I should be heading home, like, right around Christmas.
I'm really starting to get worried. It's getting cold out there.
it's too cold out there. -How can she survive?
december 24th, 1990, 10 p. m. Eastern Standard Time.
I can't believe a year went by so fast.
speak. -Speak.
Hey, it's me, throw down the key. -Hey, Iook who's home.
Hey, Collins, don't get your ass kicked this time.
Hey. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.
welcome back.
come here.
take your key. Hey, man.
Hello, Thomas. Merry Christmas.
Hey, any word from Mimi? -No.
you got the projector-- You finished your movie.
I did. -Well, I wanna see it.
okay.
and I thought you guys could use this to get some heat up in here.
you shouldn't have done that. -Thank you.
tutoring again? -Nope.
you back at NYU? -Negative.
then how'd you get all this? -I rewired the ATM...
...At The Food Emporium. Now all you need is the code.
the code? What code? -A-N-G-E-L.
Cheers.
merry Christmas.
mark?
Roger?
anyone? Help.
we can't get her up the stairs.
hurry up, please.
Mimi.
she's been Iiving on the street.
we found her in the park. She wanted to come here.
no room on the couch.
just clear off the table, we'II put her there.
up here.
Roger.
you're back. -I'm back. I'm back, baby.
Rog.
we need some heat. -Okay, I'II buy some wood and food.
it's too Iate. I'm calling 911. -Roger?
I'm right here. I'm right here. It's okay.
I'm here. We got you.
we got you.
I should tell you I should tell you
I should tell you I should tell you
I should tell you Benny wasn't any
I know.
I should tell you why I left -It wasn't 'cause I didn't-- -I know.
I should tell you -I should tell you
I should tell you, I love you
who do you think you are?
leaving me alone with my guitar
hold on, there's something you should hear
it isn't much, but it took all year
your eyes
as we said our goodbyes
can't get them out of my mind
and I find
I can't hide
from your eyes
the ones that took me by surprise
the night you came into my life
where there's moonlight
I see your eyes
how'd I let you slip away
when I'm longing so to hold you?
now I'd die for one more day 'Cause there's something I should have told you
Yes, there's something I should have told you
when I looked into your eyes
why does distance make us wise?
you were the song all along
and before the song dies
I should tell you I should tell you
I have always loved you
you can see it in my eyes
Mimi
Mimi.
I was heading towards this warm...
...White Iight.
and I swear...
...Angel was there.
and she Iooked good.
she said:
turn around, girlfriend...
...and Iisten to that boy's song.
you're drenched.
her fever's breaking.
there is no future
there is no past
thank God this moment's not the last -There's only us -There's only us -There's only this -There's only this -Forget regret -Forget regret
or life is yours to miss
no other road
no other way
no day but today -I can't control -Will I lose my dignity?
my destiny -Will someone care?
I trust my soul -Will I wake tomorrow
my only goal - Is just to be - From this nightmare?
without you - There's only now - The hand gropes - There's only here - The ear hears -Give in to love - The pulse beats -Or live in fear -Life goes on -No other path -But I'm gone -No other way - 'Cause I die without you -No day but today -I die without you -No day but today -I die without you -No day but today -I die without you -No day but today -I die without you -No day but today -I die without you -No day but today
I think I'm sensing a thaw where my mom's concerned.
if she's letting us study together,
a date can't be too far behind.
Mrs. Bloom. yes.
could I take Amanda to the prom?
maybe.
Yes.
maybe I am lazy and I lack study skills,
but I've changed, and I'm going to do
something important with my life.
my test results are back. I'm officially in remission!
I'm finally comfortable with where we are.
which is? Friends.
friends.
without benefits.
brutal.
did you hear any of that song?
uh, not really. come in here.
W-w-w-what does his opinion matter?
he knows music.
Brian told me all about the girl in the picture of Sarah.
he said he created me
from Sarah's genetic material after she died.
the biochemistry department cancelled the final exam "after discovering honor student Sarah Emerson "stole the test and vandalized the lecture hall
in the science building.
she gave everyone the answers.
my mother was awesome.
the way you've crossed boundaries,
mixing your personal and your professional life,
shows an alarming lack of judgment and ethical integrity.
challenge yourself.
incredible.
need a break?
I'm just getting started.
I'm fine.
you can't keep doing this to yourself.
promise me you'll stop.
I promise.
where did you get this?
someone left it for jesse.
we don't know who.
Sarah and I used to bury messages for each other within the music.
we'd translate the sounds into images.
I gave Sarah a latnok ring with a red stone.
I thought Sarah was dead.
she is.
never misses.
every day,
we face questions of right and wrong
and decisions about whether to take action
or stay out of the game.
and it's when those choices are least clear
that we draw upon our conscience,
follow our instincts,
and reveal our true character.
this is, like, the one place in the world where I've almost got the edge on you.
what are you gonna do now?
what?
like I said, almost.
I do have an advantage.
tell me about it, pod boy.
I'm talking about your ankle.
you've been favoring your good one.
just hope the coaches at U-dub don't notice.
U-dub?
I'm working out there next week
to show them what I can do.
can't let this bum ankle slow me down.
so what's up with you?
I mean, how are things with you and Amanda?
it's good.
her mom's letting me take her to the prom.
cool.
I just gotta think of the right way to ask her.
dude, it's not a marriage proposal.
I just want it to be perfect.
for you, deckie.
Oh, I love that book. How do you like it?
I'm not reading. I'm listening.
listening?
you know, that's a really bad habit eavesdropping on people.
tell me you wouldn't do it if you could.
so what are they saying?
Kyle just asked Declan who he's taking to prom.
Really? And?
they're talking about Declan's ankle again.
Damn!
Mr. Trager, I've just received the results from the placement exams.
please sit down.
and your score went up
by an astonishing 27% over last year.
that's awesome.
Mr. Trager, I take great pride
in what the students at Beachwood can accomplish.
well, thank you.
which is why I find this situation so disturbing.
you're a former remedial student
with a c average.
C-plus.
Yes, well,
it's just not possible to make such a dramatic leap
Without...assistance.
Mr. Hooper, I busted my ass studying.
Mr. Trager.
I'll take that test again. right here, right now.
there are too many other average students
who scored well above the norm.
now, something is going on here.
and I promise you I'm going to find out what.
I will not tolerate cheaters at my school.
that makes you feel better?
the banana got Marie Antoinetted
because I can't do it to Hooper.
funny thing is
if you asked me who Marie Antoinette was
about three months ago,
I would've probably said
that french foreign exchange student with the acne.
but I've been applying myself.
I found a new leaf, and I turned that puppy over.
I know how much work you've been doing.
you wouldn't cheat after all that.
would you?
you're the human lie detector. you tell me.
you didn't cheat.
now convince Hooper.
make the world safe for bananas everywhere.
tropical splendor. your favorite.
I didn't order this.
you're here. I just assumed you'd ask.
thank you.
Amanda, speaking of asking,
can I have a straw?
Oh, yeah. sure.
sorry.
awesome. Yeah.
step into my office.
what?
it's about the prom.
Mrs. Bloom said I could ask Amanda.
but I don't know how.
I'll take this one.
Amanda, will you go to prom with me?
it's that easy? I mean, I thought that...
if it were that simple, you must be missing something?
well, yes.
Aw. and you came to your goddesses of all things estrogen for the real skinny.
you came to us for girl advice. just ask her.
I'll do it now.
No! you can't do that.
look at her. she's way too busy.
and she has a big chunk of kiwi stuck in her hair.
okay. I'll do it when she goes on her break.
she'll have low blood sugar, and her feet will hurt.
I thought you said this was simple.
the question is simple.
but the timing of the question...
needs to be perfect.
I heard your ankle hurts.
did it make the news?
I think I can help you.
I know how to work through pain.
maybe I could take yours away.
um, okay.
well, not-- not here.
it has to be a secret, and you can't tell Kyle.
Why?
because he doesn't like it when I do special things.
um, you know, thanks,
but, uh, i think I'll let it heal on its own.
it's good that you haven't told Jessi.
it would be wrong to give her hope that her mother's alive before we're sure.
and I'm concerned that she might tell Taylor.
what do you think he might do?
use that information to try to restore
his standing with latnok.
the same reason he keeps pushing Jessi.
to impress them.
there's no point. latnok is done with him.
whoever sent this is very concerned
about remaining unexposed.
but if it is Sarah,
why would she fake her own death?
why would she stay hidden all this time?
because people hide when they're afraid
or when they want to reinvent themselves.
or when they're secretly healing themself from a gunshot
wound.
true.
but if she really is alive, why is she contacting me now,
and not you?
because I failed her when she needed me.
I can't believe principal Hooper.
he was completely inappropriate.
to hurl an accusation like that at you
after the effort you've made.
I've been profiled based on past reputation.
we should sue.
you sure your case would hold up in court?
please. I may have cut a few corners back in the day,
but I'm an honest-to-god b student now.
well, I think principal Hooper needs a good talking-to.
I'll go with you. oh, no, no.
you don't need to miss your class. I can handle him.
go, Mrs. Trager.
now this one.
that's too heavy.
be positive.
that's right. you can do it.
you can do it.
why did you stop?
Oh, I'm bleeding.
just wipe it off and keep going.
you were doing so well.
don't quit.
okay.
look, we need to show them that you weren't a mistake.
we need to prove to Latnok that we matter.
well, all I do is train in here day after day.
the time will come when we'll prove to them what you can do.
meanwhile, why don't we change up your routine a little bit?
tomorrow we'll take it outside.
okay, yeah. That sounds good.
in the meantime, let's try it again.
Hooper said there were other students
whose grades didn't match their usual grades?
Yeah. and apparently, I was involved
in a crappy student cheating ring I didn't know about.
how would that work?
I mean, if you could've cheated?
I guess the old me may have considered a cheat sheet.
impractical in this case.
way too much material to cover.
any other methods?
Mmm, sneaking a peek at someone else's answers is an option.
but I sat between Darryl Tibb, who was wasted at the time,
and Kim Tresa
hot as hell but no mental giant.
if anything, they cheated off me.
my only crime was doing better than Hooper expected me to.
I should've bombed as usual and avoided this mess.
no, you earned that score.
Yeah, I did, and I really wanna keep it.
good night.
good night.
keep my secret anonymous are you Sarah?
Sarah?
you can't accuse josh of cheating because his score has improved.
if you look at his records
that was last year.
he's finally made a commitment to his education.
you should be applauding that,
not condemning him without any proof.
Mrs. Trager, in my experience,
numbers lie far less than people do.
and unfortunately, these numbers show
that you have two suspected cheaters living in your home.
now you're suggesting Lori's involved.
no. no, not your daughter.
Kyle?
come in.
Hi.
you've gotta be kidding me.
I mean, why would the smartest kid at your school
bother to cheat on a test he could take blindfolded?
Mr. Hooper, Josh didn't cheat. neither did I.
it has come to my attention that someone
hacked into the district's computer system,
downloaded the tests, and then posted them
on some sort of secret web site.
the results being
that students who were failing their courses
managed to ace their exams.
I want you to show me that web site
and tell me who logged onto it.
I don't know anything about a web site.
you can't target Kyle for posting those tests.
even I'd know how to do that.
Yes. but hacking into the district's mainframe
is only slightly harder than breaking into fort knox.
now, do you know any other student here
that could do that... besides him?
what were you thinking?
what do you mean? it's so Sarah.
except sarah got in trouble for what she did at U-dub.
Mmm, because she got caught.
and she gave away the answers to the test.
I just posted the questions.
Why? For attention?
no. Everyone was complaining about the exams.
I just wanted to help them.
except Hooper thinks I did it.
and now Josh and everyone who scored higher than expected
is under suspicion.
well, maybe they cheated.
or maybe they studied really hard like Josh did.
look, all I did was post the test
and help spread the word a little.
I'm not responsible for anyone who logged on to check it
what is it? nothing.
Jessi, you promised you'd stop pushing yourself.
I'm fine.
you just got me worked up a little.
are you gonna turn me in?
no.
Thanks.
Hey. Why is everyone smiling at me?
Oh, word's out you're the hacker who posted the exams.
I didn't.
I know that, but they don't.
they're impressed by someone who helped people cheat?
everyone looks for an edge. it's human nature.
did you look up the web site?
no. but I would have if I'd have known about it.
you've got a built-in advantage over everyone at this
so a sneak peek at that test
sort of leveled the playing field.
they still had to look up the answers, so it's not
is your ankle any better?
the same, which sucks.
I'll catch you later.
been there, done him.
and him.
we've been watching the same parade of neanderthals Since seventh grade.
I suppose I could tap into my inner lesbian
and go with a hot cheerleader.
you have an inner lesbian?
to not have to go stag to prom,
I would inner anything.
any news on the deejay? I need to finalize the budget.
I'm working on it.
on it or on him?
you seriously have to stop it with that.
you're interested in the deejay?
I am not interested in the deejay.
is there a smart-girl quote for what just happened there?
methinks a lady doth protest too much.
thank you, smart girl. You're welcome.
so has anything delicious happened to you today?
Hillary!
what are you talking about? nothing.
we're talking about smart girls and smart-but-clueless boys
who need their friends' help to pave the glorious way to
prom.
stop it. You're gonna spoil it for her.
spoil what?
both of you, spill.
I can't help it. it's too cute.
you're gonna be so excited.
you really think you can help me?
what changed your mind?
my ankle hurts. it's really tight,
and I've gotta be at the top of my game.
you want to be the best.
I wanna be my best.
I know what that's like.
so are you still into it?
well, the truth is I've never done anything like it before.
give it a shot.
okay. just promise that you won't tell Kyle.
I promise.
okay.
so he thinks you're the hacker?
does Hooper know who he's dealing with?
you're Mr. pure as snow, I cannot tell a lie.
I don't know about that,
but I guess he thinks I'm smart enough to do it.
Hooper thinks you're not smart enough to do well,
so you must've cheated.
and you're really smart, so you must be the hacker.
we're both victims of Hooper's twisted logic.
and I'm telling you, forget the bananas,
cause I'm going straight to Hooper, and I'm gon
Hey, hey, Mr. Hooper. How's it going?
well, I'm very disappointed.
I had hoped my students would show more conscience,
but so far, no one's come forward.
it's forced me to consider canceling the prom.
what does the prom have to do with this?
nothing. As soon as you show me the web site.
Mr. Hooper, I told you, it's the first I've heard of it.
well, then, maybe you can tell me who is responsible,
and I'll take your cooperation into account.
I am merely trying to protect
the legitimate scores of honest students.
Yeah, me included.
why do they look mad at you?
I think they blame me
cause principal Hooper might cancel the prom.
because of the web site?
he wants to know who posted the exams.
okay. You want me to tell? fine.
but a lot of other people
are going to get into trouble if I do,
and I don't think you'd like it.
what do you mean?
if I show Hooper my web site,
he could trace the I. P addresses
of every computer that logged onto it.
I started to already and kept a list.
why would you do that?
because I like to see the people I help.
no, I don't wanna see that.
you need to,
to understand why Hooper can't.
you still want me to tell him?
the Hooper patrol's got you down, huh?
Yeah.
let me whip you up today's special.
you'll love it. it's fantastic.
uh, maybe later.
Amanda, I need to ask you something.
Oh.
okay.
please, ask away.
there was a web site where someone posted the placement test in advance.
di
it's none of my business.
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
I already do.
I'd heard a rumor about the web site and logged on.
when I got to the cover page,
I just couldn't go through with it.
I clicked right off.
I never saw any of the questions.
but why did you even go there? you always get A's.
I fell so far behind when I came back from the conservatory.
when I heard about the web site,
I guess I just couldn't resist.
I'll tell Hooper what I did.
no, don't do that.
well, you and Josh didn't do anything,
and you're getting so much grief.
Amanda, how many people were tempted or looked just because they were curious?
don't say anything to Hooper.
I'll figure a way out.
Yes, Mr. Taylor.
Jessi's almost ready.
I know you don't approve of my creating her,
but I appreciate the opportunity to show you
that it wasn't a mistake.
and I think that you'll all be very impressed
with what she can do.
holy crap!
how did you do that?
everything with an atomic mass has a gravitational field
that can be manipulated.
huh. That simple, huh?
it was a joke.
Oh.
man, you and Kyle are so alike sometimes.
you-- you, uh, you haven't said anything to him, have you?
no. But why is it such a secret?
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
my father would be mad.
so you're out here every day?
uh, well, I used to train inside,
but now I start by running 13 miles.
wait. You warm up with a half a marathon?
I have to condition myself so I'm ready.
for what?
let's check out your ankle.
has your big brain figured out how to clear both our names
yet?
I'm working on it.
but I think it's only fair to tell you I have access to a list.
it's a log of all the I. P. addresses that looked at the web site.
how'd you get that?
it's not important. But...
your computer's not on there, so it should help your case.
but I couldn't show it to hooper without ratting everyone else out.
this is true.
then forget it. Nobody's taking the fall for me.
dude, I've got morals.
I know. It's just nice to see.
now, uh,
show me who's on that list.
Hey, I may have morals. I still wanna see who doesn't.
I need to keep it confidential.
figures.
you guys okay?
man, it sucks you may miss out
if Hooper follows through and cancels the prom.
Thanks.
have you asked her anyways?
bad timing.
Bye.
he's threatened to cancel prom?
okay, that is unacceptable-- to strong-arm you like that.
I'd like to take principal Hooper and just...
you and Josh like to take out your aggressions on food.
except he chops bananas.
Yeah, well, pasta is much more satisfying.
I have to call the superintendent
and tell him how Hooper's been handling all this.
I wish you wouldn't.
look, Kyle, with you and Josh both under the gun
I mean, I know you want to protect Jessi, but...
she is the one who's responsible, isn't she?
I don't wanna get anyone into trouble.
she made a mistake. she needs to own up to it.
she's willing to.
but that would mean exposing some other people.
how'd it go at school today?
awesome.
unless you count the big black cloud over my head.
what's the point of trying when no one believes your grades anyway?
well, I do.
Josh, I know it's been tough, but I am proud of you.
I have to tell you, the way you turned your grades around...
and more important, watching you
support Andy through her illness,
being such a loving friend.
I don't think I had that kind of maturity at your age.
in fact, I know I didn't.
so you just keep doing what you're doing.
don't let the Hoopers of this world get you down.
Taylor won't stop until he destroys her?
what does that mean, Taylor's trying to destroy her?
well, Jessi said she stopped pushing herself,
but I can tell she's lying.
I can sense she's not well. Maybe Taylor's behind it.
we still don't know who sent those messages
or whether to trust them.
I know I don't trust Taylor.
Oh, I hate to say this, Kyle, but I
I don't think I can get involved when it comes to Jessi.
my professional conduct is in question.
that social worker who came here,
she cited me for crossing ethical boundaries.
you're the most ethical person I know.
thank you, but the truth is
I've skirted the rules now and then.
when I've needed to, I've cheated.
if you did, I'm sure it was to help somebody.
well, I need to be careful now.
and since I'm not Jessi's therapist anymore
I understand.
you've already done so much to help Jessi.
and that social worker was wrong about you.
when you think about it,
if you hadn't skirted the rules,
I might not be here at all.
you look cranky.
I can't get this verse right.
can't help you there. I'm tone deaf.
hills, these are lyrics.
I can rhyme a little.
you have to be careful with rhymes.
too pedestrian.
that's what mark says.
why do you care so much what he says?
once and for all, this is a professional,
One-song-only relationship.
I hope so.
cause I really hate to see you blow off declan for a taste of college boy pie.
Declan?
can you honestly tell me that you still don't feel the sparkage?
Declan and I are in a really good place right now.
I don't want to mess with that.
it doesn't have to be a mess this time.
away with you now. I need to be brilliant.
fine. I've done my job.
good job, Declan.
Hey, what's up?
I was looking for Jessi.
haven't seen her.
it seems better.
Oh, it is.
like magic.
what?
your heart is racing.
Yeah, I was just kicking ass in that game.
faster than when you walked over here.
man, oh, man, the CIA should snatch you up.
I told Jessi I wouldn't tell you,
but the whole thing creeped me out a little.
she did something.
I'm not sure how,
but she made my ankle not hurt anymore.
what did she do, exactly?
she touched my ankle, and then she just concentrated.
I'm not into that whole faith healer mumbo jumbo stuff,
but...it does feel a lot looser.
maybe she manipulated the joint in some way.
or maybe it's just the power of sgestion.
I was desperate for a fix.
that tryout means everything to me.
I know it does.
you just need to make sure that your ankle's really healed
so you don't hurt it again.
Yeah, I get it.
I appreciate you seeing me.
well, it sounded urgent.
please, sit.
thank you. I think it is.
we both know it's dangerous for Jessi or Kyle to expand their abilities too quickly.
and it's come to my attention
you may be encouraging Jessi to do just that.
it's come to your attention?
you know, you seem to have this strange compulsion,
Nicole, to interfere in other people's business.
when a child's welfare is at stake, it is my business.
you are no longer Jessi's therapist.
she's doing just great.
I'd still like to talk to her.
well, that's not gonna happen.
well, I hoped we could deal with this privately,
but I'll go over your head if I need to.
what, by involving social services?
see, I don't think you're gonna do that.
you're already on notice with them.
and if you attempt to contact Jessi in any way,
I will lodge a complaint with them, I promise you.
you'll just have to do that, then.
you went to see Taylor?
and now I'm convinced he's up to something.
he threatened to make trouble if I don't stay out of it.
well, what do we do?
well, i'm not backing off.
Jessi could be in danger.
I'm not backing off, either.
we've been through a lot.
we'll figure out how to get through this, too.
Nicole...
what made you change your mind about getting involved?
you.
Jessi.
what are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Declan lied to me.
he promised.
I don't know why taylor's pushing you,
but you need to stop.
Brian wouldn't let anything bad happen to me.
he cares about me.
does he care that your nose starts to bleed
every time you strain too hard?
Jessi, please don't listen to him anymore.
what am I supposed to do?
he's my father.
a real father wouldn't push you this way.
Yeah, well, he's all I have.
Jessi.
go away.
please, go away.
I understand.
Mr. Hooper.
I think I have what you've been looking for.
well, Mr. Trager, it's taken you a while,
but I'm pleased you finally decided
to follow your conscience.
my conscience has always been clear.
I didn't post the exams.
but I can give you the internet addresses of all the computers that accessed the web site.
but you should know, in total, there were 774 hits.
well, that's impossible.
the entire student body is only 812.
clearly, not all of us cheated.
well, no, the scores don't reflect that, but
so I can give you the list,
but you can never be certain
who simply checked out the rumor
and logged off right away.
and you definitely can't prove
who actually stayed to copy the questions.
the entire school will take a new set of exams.
it is the only fair thing to do.
Mr. Trager, if you have those addresses,
then you must know where the web site is.
who created it, if not you?
by withholding, it makes you an accomplice.
doesn't that also make you a cheater?
I guess you could look at it that way.
but everybody needs to live with their own choices.
you think I should tell him?
I just wish you'd be more careful
about the things that you do.
Hey, have you seen Kyle?
Nope.
prom's back on, have you heard?
you're such a sports movie clich right now.
feels like the right place to mope.
are you gonna tell me why, or are you still stuck
in the flashback of the glory days?
my ankle hurts again.
it started to feel pretty good.
but that was just temporary.
all in my head, or whatever.
should've known.
nobody comes back from a surgery like mine
and rocks a college-level workout.
there will be other workouts, Declan,
and other colleges.
it doesn't matter if I'm not strong enough to play.
it happens all the time, you know.
people get injured, dream over.
well, look at the bright side, there aren't many point guards
who fight evildoers in their spare time.
Yeah, but with Kyle, I'm just a sidekick.
but out here, with five seconds on the clock, 3-point shot,
I'd sink 'em half the time with my eyes closed.
and cue sad, fallen hero music.
nice. Really helpful.
what, you were on the express train
I'm pulling the emergency brake.
besides, I don't think that you could make a 3-point shot with your eyes closed.
ha. Fluke.
and your eyes weren't closed.
fine, I'll do it again.
you're on.
you're amazing.
I mean, you know when to listen
and when to shut me up.
you totally get me.
why wouldn't I get you?
I mean, friends get friends, right?
right.
you.
Kyle...
you did it.
you found a way out.
I'm just not sure everyone's too happy
about having to retake the test.
it was the right thing to do.
which, I hope you know, I don't always manage.
Amanda, making the right choices
isn't easy for me, either.
but somehow, you always do.
Kyle, you're such a good person.
and I know you see me in a certain way.
I jut feel like I'm bound to disappoint you.
you could never do that.
you're you.
will you go to the prom with me?
I've been wanting to ask,
but the timing's never been right, and
the timing is perfect.
and yes, I would love to go with you.
is it happy hooper banana day?
you stopped the inquisition. I've been exonerated.
wow, now I know you've really been studying.
a few months ago,
you didn't know the words inquisition or exonerate.
a shot of wheat grass to celebrate?
I'll take one of those beauties instead.
what? cancer couldn't do it.
a pastry's not gonna kill me.
I could cheat now and then.
Hey, don't look at me. I'm no cheater.
Hey, Kyle.
another shout out from Baylin's dead girlfriend?
I'm still not sure.
but if she was smart enough to stay hidden all those years,
why would she send me IMS, knowing they can be traced?
I'm hoping that's a rhetorical question.
maybe she wants me to find her.
right, so call up and set up a date like a normal person.
too risky.
phone calls, IMS, emails, can all be intercepted.
then what are you waiting for?
start tracing.
why aren't you training?
I had a hard day, and I'm tired.
well, you've gotta push through the fatigue.
Jessi...
this isn't a game we're playing.
this is your future.
you told me I have to train so I can impress Latnok.
when? when am I gonna do that?
when I say you're ready.
now get up.
my mother wouldn't treat me this way.
your mother's dead.
in the past few weeks, I received four IMS,
each from a different computer,
and in four separate locations.
the four dots.
they make a perfect square.
that can't be a coincidence.
but even you can't meet up in four places t once.
can you?
if it's Sarah, she must be leading me somewhere.
someplace inside the square?
exactly.
eh, when you're hot, you're hot.
What'd I do?
x marks the spot.
I know that place.
I know where to go.
I realized the messages I'd received were my test.
whoever sent them to me needed me to solve a puzzle.
and only when I found the solution,
was I worthy of knowing the answer.
hello.
I'm Kyle.
I know.
my name's Sarah.
but that was long ago she could be you
then no good-byes. Just like "See ya.
see ya.
you've proven you can keep my secrets.
if there was anything to tell, don't you think I'd bring you in on it?
I'm Adam Baylin.
you're saying I was gestated inside one of those tanks at Zzyzx.
so you created me. Yes.
you have to condition yourself, or you're gonna die too young before you've even had a chance to live.
Kyle, this is Brian Taylor. Nice to meet you.
you as well. I've heard a lot about you.
[Kyle] He's been shot!
[Taylor] Zzyzx will kill him.
I'll go tonight and eliminate the threat.
you'll do nothing. You'll harm no one.
they're innocent! They're not innocent!
they killed Baylin and they'll kill you!
No!
Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers.
I lied so that I could leave, and now I'll lie so that I can return.
I'll do everything in my power to live by the truth.
why do you want to go back there and complicate your life?
it's not complicated. It's simple. I love them.
Oh, Kyle-- This is great.
it's so good to see you again.
how long can you stay? What are you doing here?
why didn't you tell me you were coming?
did your parents come with you?
let's give this guy a chance to catch his breath here.
are you okay?
[Kyle Narrating] I'll never forget that look on their faces, the joy and relief.
they seemed so happy to see me.
I wanted to tell them the truth about everything that had happened, but I wanted to be at home with them even more.
is that your folks?
and that meant playing my part in the charade.
Mr. Trager? Yes.
my name's Brian Taylor.
I'm the attorney for David and Julia Peterson.
attorney?
well, come on in.
thank you.
is everything all right?
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but David and Julia were killed in a car accident last week.
my God.
what are you doing?
thank you.
it's not even my birthday.
the hell?
no belly button?
no, no, no. Don't be scared, sweetheart.
we can be friends.
huh? You want some?
here. Warm you up.
go on. There. Yeah.
that wasn't very nice.
now, you gotta be nice.
huh?
you wanna play?
let's play.
give me the knife.
give it to me!
why you little
get me Hollander.
according to the police report,
david lost control of the car and it plunged into a canyon.
the, uh, gas tank was punctured and the...car caught fire.
Oh, that's horrible.
but for the grace of God, no one decided to sleep in that morning.
otherwise, we would be having a far more difficult conversation.
and you say this happened a week ago?
that's right.
well, I'm just surprised that Kyle...
sorry, we'll still not used to his real name.
Oh, I understand.
why didn't he contact us sooner?
well, he missed you terribly.
and to be honest, I, uh
well, I had to insist that he come here at all.
he was rather reluctant to involve you and your family again.
Why?
he felt that he'd already been enough of a burden.
Kyle's never been a burden.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
see, Julia and David named you as his permanent guardians.
His...guardians?
it's not that we don't want Kyle.
w-we went through so much when we lost him the first time.
if he stays here and another relative comes to take him away again
there are no other relatives, Mr. and Mrs. Trager.
it's a lot to take in.
I understand. You need time to think.
we're staying at a hotel near the airport.
would it be all right if he spent the night here?
I'm-- I'm sure he'd like that very much.
I'm planning on leaving town tomorrow evening.
really, the only question for me is whether I'm buying one plane ticket or two.
mom was having a symbolic moment.
a way of letting you go.
well, I always knew you'd be back.
you did?
[Laughs] Not like this...
but, yeah.
Kyle, are you okay?
I mean...
I'm sorry. I know that sounds lame.
no.
I don't know what else to say.
you don't have to say anything.
so, is it weird, being back here?
a little.
there. That's better.
glad to see it?
very.
[Automated Female Voice] Welcome, Emily Hollander.
ms. Hollander, you've handled some...
unusual assignments for us before.
I like unusual.
this case is no exception.
in fact, it's a highly sensitive matter that requires the utmost discretion.
well, now I'm intrigued.
Madacorp is like an iceberg.
most of its interests lie beneath the surface.
as did Zzyzx, one of our research facilities.
I say "did" because Zzyzx was fire bombed this week.
why whom?
that's unclear at the moment, but there is a...
much more pressing concern.
Zzyzx experimented with artificial reproduction and produced two primary assets.
the first was a male called "XY.
he was terminated sometime last year for reasons unknown.
the second is a female, XX.
she apparently survived the bombing and escaped.
escaped? [perusing file]
I take it the subject has outgrown her petri dish.
she's fully-developed.
human, yet not human.
she's had no contact with the outside world.
consider her dangerous, unpredictable, and disoriented.
she's likely still wandering around the woods near Victor Falls.
and I assume that you don't want her to go camping.
I want her here.
there's no telling what she might do, and we can't risk any exposure to the company.
shouldn't be too much of a challenge for you.
I know what you accomplished in Iraq.
I'll find her for you, sir.
I wish you'd let us know.
we would've flown out there to be with you.
everything happened so fast.
well, you're here with us now.
it's okay, you know?
it's normal if you feel some anger or a sense of injustice...
injustice?
you finally reunited with your parents and...
things don't always turn out like you expect them to.
well, you need anything else?
no.
thank you.
sure.
it's so good to see you again.
good night.
[Narrating] I couldn't help but think back to the last night I'd spent in this room.
it was the beginning of my secret life, before I left with the Petersons.
and now I was home, hiding even more secrets.
I could only hope that whatever fate had in store for me, it would kind and forgiving to the people I loved.
what a day.
I'm exhausted.
it's just so hard to believe.
I know.
you kept sensing something was wrong.
I never dreamed of anything like this.
you're not feeling guilty are you?
I can tell you're happy that Kyle's home...
miserable about the reason.
when did you become the psychologist in the family?
I learn by osmosis.
I missed Kyle so much...
and I'm thrilled that he's here, but I don't want to lose him again.
well, you heard the lawyer.
Yeah, there are no relatives that he knows about.
I mean, there's still so much that we don't know.
what about those years when Kyle was missing?
we still don't know what happened to him then.
Yeah, well...
I guess we're always going to have questions.
the only one we could answer right now is, do we want him to be part of our family?
okay, just remember, Kyle's been through a lot, so be extra sensitive.
[Scoffs] Why you all looking at me?
because you're such a model of tact and compassion.
[Sighs] Fine.
I won't speak.
hmm, can we have that in writing?
guys, stop.
the point is Kyle needs our support.
but don't press him.
let him deal with this in his own time in his own way.
good morning.
[All] Morning!
[Stephen] Sleep okay?
I haven't slept so well in days.
nothing beats a cold slab of porcelain.
sorry.
are you hungry?
I'll make pancakes.
I missed your pancakes.
Oh, I think we're out of syrup.
who finished the syrup?
I didn't know we were rationing.
it's okay. I'll go get some more.
no, wait.
you don't have to be so nice.
just be yourselves.
you know what I mean.
you're all trying to make me feel better, and I appreciate it, but the truth is... just being here is enough.
[beep] Excuse me.
Hello?
[Foss] How did it go?
fine.
are they there right now?
Yes.
we need to talk.
so meet me later like we agreed.
okay, I'll, good-bye.
was that Mr. Taylor?
[Josh] Cool phone.
you know, I could use a new one.
good. Go buy one.
Seriously? Sure.
just as soon as you get that after-school job to pay for it.
[Lori] Check the job board at The Rack.
I'm meeting Declan there for lunch.
how is Declan?
an eternal ray of sunshine.
he's in a gunk.
a what?
a guy funk. Totally gender-specific.
you should come with.
maybe you can shake him out of it.
if a guy funk is a gunk, then what's a girl funk?
redundant.
it's Hollander. I found our girl.
or at least what she left behind.
where are you?
in the woods, east of the Zzyzx complex.
how long ago since she was there?
by the looks of things, it couldn't have been more than four or five hours.
is there anything I should be concerned about?
not unless you count the dead guy covered in pink goo.
clean it off.
nothing can be traced back to the company.
what the
what is it?
hold on.
she must be exceptionally strong.
you forgot to mention that.
as I told you, I have no idea what she's capable of.
find her before she kills again.
is that clear?
crystal.
[Kyle, flashback] What's the trick.
once you teach your mind to alter the positive and negative polarity of the cells in your body...
the glass will move. Not the glass.
the water inside it.
what are you doing?
Oh, hey, Josh.
why were you zoning out like that?
was I?
you were staring at that glass.
I was thirsty.
[Laughs] Right.
come on, did you learn some new tricks while you were away?
I don't do tricks.
kyle...you forget I kept records, okay?
and I'd be more than happy to bust out that file if you've got something new you want to show me.
okay, I do have something.
but we have to concentrate really hard if we want it to work.
Absolutely.
face the glass.
close your eyes. Close my eyes?
do you want it to work?
open them.
I made the water disappear.
Hi. Hey.
welcome back.
it's good to see you.
you don't look any different.
you don't look like you're in a gunk.
a gunk?
ah
[Chuckles] Lori thinks I'm depressed.
are you?
no...
but you've had me freaked out and worried.
there's no reason to be.
right, because being the keeper of your secret code and good-bye message shouldn't have given me any anxiety.
you should forget about that box.
forget it?
it's been torturing me for months.
everything's fine now.
no, everything's not fine.
come on, Kyle, you can't come back out of nowhere and not tell me what happened.
sorry, I have to be somewhere right now.
where?
I just gotta go.
not cool, Kyle.
after everything?
what is she wearing?
Whoa!
come on, now.
we need to go.
[rustling] [Girl] Get the ball.
can I have my ball back?
I appreciate you seeing me.
it's my pleasure.
I understand you've got a very weighty decision to make.
no, we love Kyle.
I mean, that's not the issue.
it's just that he left here with so many questions unanswered.
well, I'll do my best to answer them for you.
that five-year period when Kyle was lost and the Petersons were looking for him, he couldn't remember any of it.
well, he did through therapy in Connecticut.
he was abducted by a man named Adam Baylin.
Adam Baylin, that was the name of the grad student who looked like Kyle.
apparently, Noah bore a striking resemblance to Baylin's dead son.
he kidnapped him.
clearly deluded, he raised him as his own for the next five years.
now, the good news, if there can be any in these circumstances, is that he treated him very well.
Noah said that they spent most of their time together with him teaching him.
teaching him? Teaching him what?
mathematics, physics.
Baylin was a scholar.
and as you know, Noah's very talented in those areas.
how did Kyle end up wandering in the woods that day?
Baylin was a very tortured soul.
he took his own life, leaving Noah alone, distraught.
eventually, he just wandered off.
I believe that's where you came in.
Mrs. Trager...
Noah has come to terms with this.
he wants to put the past to rest and move forward.
my hope is that he can do that with the love and support of your family.
[Man, police radio] Female Caucasian, hair black, blood-stained shirt only.
behavior erratic, considered dangerous.
sighted on MacGowan, north of Juniper Park.
you made it.
what's all this?
Baylin's belongings.
his journals and his books, his research.
you'll understand it better than I can.
how'd it go with the Tragers?
it's hard... not telling them the truth.
I'm going to tell Declan.
no, you're not.
I need to.
he already knows a lot of the story.
how?
before I left, he was helping me.
there was no one else who understood.
what, and now
and now you're back and he's asking questions?
I can explain it to him.
no, you can't.
for the same reason you can't explain it to the Tragers.
he already knows more than they do.
that's your mistake!
[Foss] What were you thinking?
he's my friend. I can trust him.
you're the one who said you wanted to come back!
you said you understood the way things were going to work.
and there are consequences for my decision.
I know that. But you obviously don't!
because the only logical move is to shut him out.
I need someone I can talk to.
then you know what? Go ahead.
tell him-- Tell him everything.
tell him all.
tell him about the experiments and the murders and the lies that you've been perpetrating.
and we'll wait and see how long it takes before somebody else catches wind of who you are and what you can do and drags you out of there!
is that what you want? [treble increases]
that's-- That's what we're here to explore.
and that's why you can't explain, because that-- that is unexplainable.
[rock] Thanks.
this smoothie has chunks.
chunks are good. They add texture.
Hey, is that your-- My Kyle file?
still on the alien trip?
not unless he does something notebook-worthy again, which, thus far, nada.
his parents just died.
I don't think his mission is to amaze you.
he could throw me a bone
start speaking in tongues, run a two-minute mile, predict a tsunami or something.
he's only been back a day. Give him time.
I just hope Kyle is still...Kyle.
how's the job search going?
I still haven't found my ideal work situation.
which is?
sitting around, eye-groping unattainable cheerleaders.
which he does here. Mm-hmm.
here.
Kyle, you're a genius. Oh, please.
I don't even think you could work a blender.
yo, you're hiring?
anything interesting?
Kyle. Yeah.
Oh, my God! Kyle, what are you doing here?
um, I'm meeting Josh and Lori.
no, I don't mean here. I mean here as in in town.
I got in last night.
I can't believe it. How long are you staying?
still trying to figure that out.
well, make it as long as possible.
we've got so much to catch up on.
well, let's catch up now.
I can't. I'm waiting for Charlie.
Yeah, you know, tall, dark, perpetually late boyfriend?
you're still together.
Yeah, why wouldn't we be?
anyhow, can we catch up later?
how about tonight?
believe me, I'd love to bail, but Charlie waited in line for, like, two days to get the tickets.
but promise me you'll find time.
I promise.
then I know it'll happen.
I'm so glad you're here.
me, too.
Hello?
I'm not here to hurt you. Do you understand?
[thumping resumes] I'm here to take you home.
okay, I'm coming in now.
don't do anything crazy.
anything crazier than this.
all right.
[Hollander] It's okay.
easy, now.
[Whispering] You're okay.
God, you're just a kid.
Hi.
my name's Emily.
that's it. Don't be afraid.
I'm here to help you.
I'm your friend.
you like the light?
Yeah. [shoots tranquilizer]
you're just going to go to sleep for a while.
it's Hollander. I've got her.
where are you?
we're in a dockyard about six miles west in a shipping container near the back fence.
well, bring her in.
Yeah, there's something you're going to want to see for yourself.
kidnapped?
I know.
it's tough to hear.
it's horrible.
his amnesia helped protect him until he was ready to deal with the experience.
fortunately, Kyle seems to have made peace with it.
Josh? You okay?
Yeah, but a kidnapping.
it's just so...
ordinary.
Yeah, it's great that Kyle's okay, but this completely blows my alien abduction theory
there is something seriously wrong with you.
look, we just wanted you both to know everything before we make our final decision.
when Kyle first came here, everything about him was a mystery and now it's all clear.
and what we're left with is a boy.
a remarkable boy who has no one else in the world but us.
and once we sign those custody papers, he'll be one of us.
here to stay.
of course you should sign.
Kyle's still the man.
even if he is ordinary.
tough day?
what are you doing here?
listen, man, I get that whatever you have to say is gonna be a little off the chart of normal, but I can take it.
I really can't talk about that.
Why?
because I don't want to lie to you.
well, then, tell me the truth.
that's not possible.
I don't understand any of this.
that guy Tom Foss hid cameras in this house.
someone came after you with a gun, Kyle.
it's all been taken care of.
what are you-- What are you talking about?
by who?
d-do you have any idea what I've had to deal with, keeping your secret?
I've been lying to Lori for months,
I can't focus, my grades are screwed, my dad is all over me...
the only thing that's kept me remotely sane was knowing that one day you would tell me what the hell you got me into and it would all be worth it.
look me in the eye and tell me all of it was for nothing.
it wasn't for nothing.
and I can't say any more.
our girl's been busy.
they offer art classes at Zzyzx?
must be all the people that she came into contact with in the last 48 hours.
can't be.
who is he?
the other asset.
thought you said he was terminated.
that's what I was led to believe.
but if she saw him out there...
your next assignment, Ms. Hollander...
has just begun.
[Stephen] Boy, I'm starving.
[Josh] That looks good.
I didn't hear you come in.
everything all right?
I know my coming back here hasn't been easy.
the last thing I want to do is make trouble for you.
you never brought anything but love into this house.
would you like to tell us something?
we know about Adam Baylin.
you do?
Mr. Taylor told me everything.
and we understand you want to move on, so we'll just take our cue from you, okay?
okay.
and we'd like to sign those custody papers and make it official.
thank you.
can we make one more thing official?
what's that?
my legal name is Noah...
but I'll never be anybody but Kyle.
my name is Kyle.
we'll take care of it.
they believed our story.
this is your home now.
they think Adam Baylin abducted me.
another lie.
my lie.
I had to put the puzzle together so that they could put the puzzle away.
I hope I did the right thing coming back here.
you have what Adam always wanted
a family.
Adam may no longer be here, but his dream still lives in you.
he believed that you could be a shining light in a world full of darkness.
so do I.
the question now is...
can you believe in yourself?
I can.
but the secrets that put me here are the last I'm willing to keep.
well, then, you're already a better man than most.
Adam wanted me to give you this.
what is it?
I don't know.
it's a ring.
it's beautiful.
what's the symbol?
never seen it before.
[Narrating] When Taylor left,
I hoped that the lies I had to tell left with him, and that from then on, I could live safely and honestly with my family.
Kyle, come on. I'm starving.
you'd better sit before things get ugly.
so, here we are.
here we are.
back to normal.
too normal.
[Stephen] Let's eat.
[Kyle] Phone's about to ring.
the phone... it's about to ring.
how did you do that?
I'll tell you how.
he's Kyle.
[Lori] Nobody phones Josh.
[Josh] It's probably for you anyway.
[Nicole] They'll call back later.
will you go to the prom with me?
Yes, I would love to go with you.
you don't wear a tuxedo to a funeral. you wear one to a prom.
didn't you once tell me that going to a prom
would be a fate worse than death?
I'm not asking you to go to prom 'cause there's no one else.
I'm asking 'cause you are the only one I want to go with.
are you telling me there are problems with the prom?
prom committee's become a nightmare of mix-ups with the decorators
and arguments with the caterers.
I want prom to be this perfect night with Kyle,
and all I can think about is table and chair rentals and non-refundable
deposits.
well, you should enter this in the contest.
I suppose.
although I'm sure three-chord trite piece of crap will win.
Brian told me all about the girl in the pictures, Sarah.
he said he created me from sarah's genetic material after she died.
my name is Sarah. - She's alive.
she wants to meet me, right?
Sarah said she'd be here. - she's not coming.
I'm alone! - you're not alone.
her heart has stopped.
it's okay now. I'm here.
the people in latnok aren't bad, they're simply scientists
with a very clinical point of view.
he's incredible.
more than we'd ever dreamed we'd see in our lifetimes.
what are you watching?
if you're not back by midnight,
you won't be coming home.
that's not good.
why on earth would you watch Prom Night? it's scary.
it's video research for the prom.
you're researching the prom?
and it led you to Prom Night?
it had the most straightforward title.
what else did you look at?
44 movies, 2.6 million websites, and 37 young-adult novels.
pm is the most romantic moment in a young person's life.
it's the culmination of adolescence
and marks the beginning of the journey into adulthood.
Pricilla's Perfect Prom. I love that book!
I wasn't always a cynic.
I know how important it is to Amanda.
I can't let her down.
I just need the perfect plan.
there's really no formula for perfection.
let me let you in on a little life secret.
the more you expect, the more you get let down.
Pricilla's prom was a disaster.
her date leaves her at the end of the night.
two chapters later, he's gay.
nice pep talk.
just focus on having fun, and you will.
don't let your expectations get the best of you.
expectations.
to them, the word implied inevitable failure.
was it wrong to have faith that things could turn out well?
I'm not sure which was more difficult to process,
the news that Sarah's alive
or that you brought Jessi back from the dead.
has Sarah tried to contact you?
no. And she won't.
she's put her past behind her, Kyle,
and I've accepted that I need to do the same.
your leg is better.
Yeah. it's good as new.
just in time for me to move on.
move on?
Kyle, I wasn't pleased that latnok
was willing to test Jessi like some kind of a laboratory rat.
it made me realize just how out of touch we all are with our own humanity.
so I need a break from the latnok community.
and I asked them to give you a break.
for me?
I haven't even met them.
well, they've been watching you for a while,
waiting for an opportunity to take a larger role in your development.
they've been watching me?
believe me, I wasn't happy about it either.
but I've made it very clear to them
that you have a whole lifetime to be extraordinary.
now is the time for you to be...ordinary.
so I'd ask you to come along with me,
but I think we both know what your answer would be.
it doesn't bother you that I wouldn't want to leave the Tragers?
I'll be back one day
when it's time for us to resume out training.
in the meantime,
I want you to stay here and enjoy what I never had.
what's that?
a life.
my sunset backdrop is a no-show,
so I don't think this gym is gonna be transformed
into the ocean paradise that I want.
we still have time. maybe there's something-- -Kyle, really, I know I made a huge deal
about the whole magic of prom,
but I'll be happy if it wasn't a huge disaster.
this would be so much more fun if we were allowed to inhale.
will you guys please get him out of here?
Amanda, I don't think I should leave you here
to deal with this by yourself.
Kyle, I have 27 perfectly capable people
to help me hang lame streamers.
I, for one, am happy to pass the helium torch.
good. save your energy for the end of tonight.
your sugar mama's got big plans for you.
is there anything else I can do?
no. - that was a lie.
you've just been busted by the human lie detector.
fess up, little lady.
okay, if you really want to help. - I really want to.
you can pick up my dress from the cleaners.
there was this whole-- well, it's a long story, but
I'd be happy to.
you don't have to bring everything.
we can start fresh. I can get you some new clothes.
Why?
because of the memories of Taylor not being exactly
a good father?
I'm glad he left.
but I like my clothes.
I even like this room.
it's the first place I've ever been able to call mine.
now this brings back memories.
good ones?
good at the time.
sometimes I wonder if it's worth having good memories.
when things go wrong, you almost resent the happy moments,
like they failed you.
that picture reminds me of Kyle
and everything we've been through together.
I hope I never have to resent that.
Yeah, I hope you never have to.
Jessi, I think we should leave seattle.
where would we go?
I don't know. somewhere, anywhere else.
because of latnok?
I don't know. maybe.
Seattle was a cage for me for 20 years,
and being back here, I feel trapped.
would that be okay with you?
Yeah. of course.
Andy says she has big plans for me.
you know what that means, don't you?
this dress is silver.
dude, you already said that. it's not important.
it's supposed to be yellow.
we're talking about me now, dude.
sorry. what does it mean?
it means I need to be ready to round the bases.
round the bases?
prom night often results in extra bases,
and considering I slid in to second with Andy a few weeks ago,
I'm looking at third base, if not an inside-the-park homer.
Josh, you should know by now, I have no idea what you're talking about.
sex. I'm talking about sex.
Yeah, and I've never... you know.
had it. - with another person.
never mind.
the importance of prom night sex was portrayed
in 82% of the movies I watched.
see?
but since 17% of them also ended with
young teens being fatally mutilated,
I assumed it was a cinematic convention.
afraid not, buddy.
for much of the adolescent universe,
the whole dance is basically just foreplay.
is sex part of the perfect prom equation?
don't you worry about it.
something tells me that sex isn't part of
yours and amanda's g-rated prom fantasy.
what is it?
nothing.
uh, no.
no line-dance songs. come on.
what? - ah!
you know it's inevitable. - not if I can help it.
come on!
it's a prom must-do.
Yeah, then I think I must puke.
are you sure you don't want to just DJ the prom yourself?
please. Have you seen those geeks that DJ the proms?
ha ha ha! hilarious.
besides, I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, remember?
Oh, you mean the lyric you actually neglected
to include in your theme song?
it's been done.
besides, you and I both know that there's zero chance of winning that contest tonight,
with my reedy voice and the 12th-rate acoustic recording.
Wow. You're really not expecting much, are you?
the thing about expectations
you know what? forget it.
I've already busted out that speech once today.
so jaded for so young.
enough with the young already.
what's all this?
Amanda changed her dress,
so the vest and the corsage I choose don't match unless I dye them.
well, can I help?
I know this may surprise you,
but I used to be kinda good at arts and crafts.
I stripped the silver nitrate off some old rolls of film
and combined it with aluminum potassium sulfate.
but I'm having trouble stabilizing the polyvalent metal ions
needed to act as a mortar to set the dye pigment.
I once made a house out of popsicle sticks.
the dye is too dark and won't stick properly to the fabric.
Oh. well, I'm sure Amanda will understand.
she will understand. That's the problem.
she's already given up hope of having a good prom,
but she shouldn't.
I just wanna make sure it's everything she wished for.
well, don't put too much pressure on yourself.
sometimes trying too hard to make things perfect can blow up in your face.
Hey. - How are you?
alive... thanks to you.
you've made a mess.
I don't know why the formula didn't work.
let me see what I can do.
what are you looking for?
Adam said latnok is watching me.
he told them to stop, but I still feel like someone's out there.
I think latnok is creepy. so does Sarah.
how have things been going with her?
new.
exciting.
a little scary.
she wants to leave town.
Why? - To start over.
no, it's okay.
Sarah really wants this.
well, what do you want?
I want what you have.
a family.
have you told her that you'd rather stay?
no, I can't do that. - why not?
because what if she leaves anyway?
not everyone who cares about you is going to disappoint you.
all I know is I'm being given a chance to have a real life.
I'm not gonna do anything to mess it up.
you're missing about ten milligrams of nickel iodine.
Oh, good. I need to talk to you.
now's not the best time, dad.
well, it's never an appropriate time for a man to warn his daughter not to get involved with his teaching assistant,
and yet, here we are.
I'm not getting involved with Mark.
in case you haven't noticed, I'm in a towel
getting ready for prom with Declan.
a much better age-appropriate, all-around good choice I'm thinking.
my year of strumming sad chords was sponsored by Mr. Declan Mcdonough.
not to mention his role in my disappearing reappearing virtue.
and about that
don't worry, dad. store's closed.
what store?
Tragerporium is locked tight.
no weekend sales, no limited time offers.
security system's armed.
guard dogs are roaming the aisle.
of course we're still encouraging window shopping,
cause you always wanna keep the public interested.
but I can assure you that tonight will not be about sex.
I thought prom was basically just foreplay
for much of the adolescent universe.
says who? - Josh.
Josh? - What's up?
not you, that's for sure.
what?
there'll be no sex had by you.
Not...any of you.
not tonight, tomorrow, or hopefully in my lifetime.
smile.
what did you do? - What? is it that obvious?
last time you had that look,
you realized Josh just found your old pot stash.
okay, so which parental sin did you commit?
the "don't blow the sex talk" one.
we already had that talk with Lori.
I'm not talking about Lori, or Kyle either.
Oh, Stephen, he's not ready.
I know.
well, you have to go back up and talk to him again.
I know. - So why aren't you moving?
I don't know.
you only have a small window of opportunity to correct this.
I can't do it.
Yes. Yes, you can.
you can. You are a smart, educated,
progressive, thoughtful man,
And--and... an excellent father.
don't psych yourself out.
just go.
Hey, it looks like all the stains came out.
thank you for coming over to help out.
how can I pass up my last opportunity
to prove that I'm smarter than you?
very funny.
I'm not, you know, smarter.
I just try harder to impress people.
but you already knew that.
you don't have to do that anymore.
you never have to prove yourself to anyone ever again.
if anything,
people should start proving themselves to you.
you really don't want to see me leave, do you?
you're my friend, Jessi.
I don't want to lose you.
I have your dress. it's not yellow.
I know, the dry cleaners accidentally shredded my original dress,
so I had to make a last-minute switch.
at least now I'll match the gym.
how are things going down there?
almost done.
but would you mind dropping the dress off at school?
at the school? won't you be home soon?
I'm just taking some precautions.
you know, in case the decorations committee hits a snag
and I have to get ready here.
I'm coming to help you.
Kyle, don't. I'm dirty and a mess.
and even though everything else is a bust right now,
I don't want you to see me until I'm ready.
just send the dress.
but I
promise me you won't come in.
I promise.
good.
it's still wet.
I'll take care of it.
I should at least take it to her and explain.
Kyle, you need to get ready.
I'll finish the dress, and I'll take it to Amanda.
it will all be okay.
you want to do something nice for Amanda?
no, but I'd like to do something nice for you.
come in.
what's with the shades?
all the makeup, like, ever, is on your face.
I wanna look "va va voomy" for Josh,
but I keep coming up with vampire clown whore.
can you help me?
you have two moms. Doesn't one of them wear a little lip-gloss?
my moms think that makeup is an ageist, sexist ploy
to devalue the feminine form in its natural state
perpetuating unrealistic myths and expectations.
Yeah. well... maybe it is.
come here.
nice job.
I downloaded an instructional diagram.
stephen will be disappointed he wasn't able to help you.
the ultimate father/son prom ritual. I forgot.
no, no, no, no. Don't worry about Stephen.
don't worry about anyone but yourself.
and Amanda.
and Amanda.
Oh. beautiful.
I got it from the rose garden where we had our first kiss.
you thought of everything.
I tried.
don't forget to stop and smell the roses every so often yourself tonight.
actually double-dyeing the corsage eliminated the scent of
you mean to focus less on making things perfect
and more on having a good time.
Yes.
look at you.
when you first came here,
everything in the world was new.
look at all you've learned.
look at all you've overcome.
tonight's a celebration of that.
just breathe and enjoy it.
I'm sorry you had to say good-bye to Adam.
he's doing what he thinks is best for me.
still, I know it's hard to say good-bye to family.
Adam created me.
he's my mentor and my friend.
but you are my family.
your decorations are ugly.
they'll look better once we turn the lights down.
all right. fine. It sucks.
it's like Charlie Brown's christmas tree.
I don't know what that means.
ugly. it means ugly.
and everyone else left, so I don't have time to go home.
I have to get ready here.
I just wanted to make it special for Kyle, but I blew it.
anyways, thanks for the dress.
did you deliver the dress?
your prom is going to be terrible.
Why?
well, the decorations are a disaster,
and Amanda has to get ready in the school locker room.
why didn't she ask me for help?
she wanted to make it special for you.
she did?
maybe if you two stopped working so hard
to make it special, you'd enjoy it more.
or maybe there's still something I can do to fix it.
which is why you called. Thank you.
this doesn't mean I like her, by the way.
I know.
thanks to Jessi, I had an idea Of how to make Amanda's night a little better.
her expectations may have disappeared,
but my desire to surpass them hadn't.
could this day get any worse?
not funny.
I thought, uh, you could use some help getting ready.
what?
did you poison my makeup or put fleas in my dress?
I think you like being mean to me.
well, that's just a little bit of The pot calling the kettle black, now, isn't it?
the pot and the kettle are black.
my point exactly.
well, after tonight, it doesn't matter anyway.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means I'm leaving town.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why? You hate me.
but I know how important you are to Kyle.
and when you care about somebody,
you wanna put their feelings first.
so how's it going?
all set.
you have to scuff the bottom of your shoes before you walk in them.
Yeah. I didn't know that.
actually, I didn't either. Kyle told me.
the prom know-it-all strikes again.
so, listen-- - please don't.
I have to.
then could you make it quick and painless, please?
are you want it quick and painless? don't use this.
you don't want me to have safe sex?
no.
I--I mean yes,
I do want you to have safe sex,
but, no, I don't want you to have sex at all.
I'd much rather you wait till you know you're ready,
till you and Andy know you're ready.
it'll mean a whole lot more if you do.
but if you decide to ignore everything I say
and make you own monumentally life-altering
no-going-back decision to have sex,
forever changing the relationship you have with Andy,
then I want you to be protected.
can I go now?
Yes.
whoa. Hold up.
a little screwy loop here.
okay.
good to go.
Thanks, dad. - You're welcome.
Hey, handsome.
so how was the talk, part two?
well, a little like that condom I just gave our son.
clumsy, awkward, but hopefully effective.
are you sure you're okay with missing your dinner to help with my plan?
do you think for one minute that
Lori Trager Would let us miss an opportunity to help you and Amanda?
we're skipping the pre-prom dinner? sweet!
you were paying for that part, weren't you?
I was indeed.
what's taking them so long?
I've been gorgeous for hours already.
let's go, people! we have a prom to save!
you are ruining our entrance.
Lori, you look-- - Yeah, yeah.
what you are about to experience
is a defining moment in your otherwise idiotic life.
do not mess it up.
looking good, Trager.
not bad yourself, Mcdonough.
Where's...
all my research had been right.
no matter what anyone said about expectations,
everyone secretly hoped this would be the best night of their lives.
Oh, my god!
I knew that more than just helping Amanda,
my night had just become about making sure everyone got their wish.
you did that on purpose.
maybe.
Really? - Yeah.
Jessi helped me.
you did?
well, I didn't want to, but she was really pathetic.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
okay. Good to know a little girl-bonding
didn't upset the balance of nature.
what time is it? - Relax. We're here early.
Kyle's waiting for you in the gym.
you've gone soft.
I had a near-death experience.
it's gonna take me a few days to return to normal.
Hi.
Hi.
it's perfect.
I had a little help.
heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.
I think the problem is I have two left feet.
I never noticed. How do you buy shoes?
it's an expression.
but you knew that, didn't you?
those jewels aren't real, you know!
whatever, Hillary!
don't drink that. Someone spiked the punch.
that's impossible.
according to my research, it happens at 68% of all proms.
I have to take care of this.
and something's leaking by the dj table. There's water everywhere.
I'm on it.
Where's Declan?
hopefully not looking for me.
Where's Andy?
I, uh, ditched her on the dance floor.
a man needs a break, you know?
why are you both hiding from your dates?
you want this one?
he's hiding because he's freaking out
about whether or not to have sex with Andy.
she wants this. I mean, I can't blame her.
but she's so much more experienced than I am.
so, yeah, I'm totally freaking out.
right.
your turn.
she's messed up because she doesn't know
whether or not to get back together with Declan.
Yep.
prom is stressful.
true that.
it doesn't have to be.
are you kidding? You've been flipping out all week.
I know. but Nicole taught me something.
you're busting out a mom moment right now?
she said that tonight is a celebration of how far we've come,
and we should just let it happen and enjoy it.
I have come a long way.
from dumb to dumber.
better than a slut to sluttier.
that's the old me. - oh.
which means I have come a long way.
that Nicole Trager, she's pretty good.
Yes, she is.
you're not so bad yourself.
shall we?
okay.
all right. Tell me the truth.
about what?
we lost the song contest, didn't we?
we lost the song contest.
well, that's just...
...fine, actually.
is it? - Yeah.
I didn't write that song for this.
I wrote it because I had something to say about myself and...
everyone here tonight.
well, no one's heard it except me.
the perils of the undiscovered songwriting duo.
destined for a lonely life on the road.
with only their college degrees to keep them warm at night.
phds, please. - You have a phd?
no, not yet. how old do you think I am?
how old are you?
you're only 19?
I was--i was sort of an early bloomer, academically speaking.
and you've been torturing me about being so young.
you are unbelievable.
but I'm half of a pretty great songwriting duo.
I don't know about great. You heard the song.
but have you?
Hello, everyone. Hello.
I hope you're all having a great night.
this song is not the winner of the prom theme contest.
but I though that everybody should get a chance to hear this song.
it's written by someone who, in my opinion,
knows a whole lot more about who she is
and really what life's all about than she will ever admit.
so, enjoy it.
this isn't...
how...
I'm computer genius, remember
what are you doing up here?
roof leak.
what about you? I thought you went home hours ago.
what do they call it? A last hurrah?
a last hurrah?
you're leaving with Sarah tonight.
Yeah.
you're not gonna ask her to stay?
Amanda said something to me earlier.
if you care about someone, you wanna put their feelings first.
I wanna do that for Sarah.
I understand.
I guess I just wish she'd done the same for you.
thank you for your help tonight.
it's amazing what we can accomplish when we work together, isn't it?
I'm gonna miss you, Jessi.
no, you're not.
because no matter where I am,
we're always connected.
that's true.
even if I am smarter.
stronger. - faster.
you, uh...
you better get back in there and make some more memories.
they're kinda hard to come by for people like you and me.
you should come down, too.
a last hurrah.
a last hurrah.
you've been following me.
nice tux.
why all the secrecy?
I didn't want to distract you.
you're worried about latnok, aren't you?
you don't trust them either.
well, they're scientists.
I don't know if they should be trusted.
do I have anything to worry about?
you should always worry.
not tonight.
tonight is about Amanda.
we'll be fine.
okay.
I'll go.
but, Foss.
thanks for looking out for me.
God, I love a man in a tux.
me, too.
I mean, I like being the man you love in a tux.
okay, so we've had our pictures taken.
we've danced. we've eaten weird french hors d'oeuvrey things.
we've covered every prom clich? in the book,
and now I think we should move onto our end of the night festivities.
okay.
let me begin by saying you're the hottest girl I know,
and I fantasize about having sex with you, like, all the time.
and I really wanted to have sex with you tonight.
but then my dad comes up to me
and didn't make any sense about whatever he was trying to say
and wanted to give me a condom,
and it all became real.
and anyway, I just... don't think we should.
you think I wanted to give it up to you tonight?
didn't you?
losing my virginity on prom night
is the most clich? of all things clich?
what kind of sentimental loser do you think I am?
wait. You're a virgin?
why wouldn't I be?
so what did you mean then, if not sex?
triple chocolate sundaes
and me kicking your ass yet again in g-force extreme.
Really?
really.
there you are.
I'm finally done putting out fires.
I'm assuming there were no actual fires.
no, no fires.
a flood or two.
I guess there was more than one leak.
the cleaning crew will get it.
I think it's time for a dance.
I think that sounds great.
have a great night, everyone.
the prom as we know it has ended.
it's over.
it doesn't have to be.
may I have this dance?
Bye! - Later!
gotta go, pumpkins.
I got a tiara to stalk.
good night. - Later, hills.
so what's next on our Hillary-approved itinerary?
how'd you know?
cause she had that glint of a job well done in her eyes.
I didn't want to mess anything up.
how could you think you could mess it up?
cause I feel like that's all I've ever done
since the first time we got together.
I couldn't even break up with you properly.
we're so passed that.
look, I know I said I'd be more open and all that,
so let me do this.
right. sorry. continue with your openness.
I really like you, Lori.
I always have.
I don't know where you stand with me
or with what we're supposed to be or not be,
but I want you to know that it's in your hands.
it's in my hands? why?
cause I heard your song tonight.
really heard it.
the girl who wrote it has got her whole future in front of her.
I don't wanna be the one that holds her back.
you know what's amazing?
is you really know me, and you get me.
I care about you so much.
but you're right.
I don't wanna move backwards.
or even stay in the same place.
so...
I think that means that we shouldn't be together.
I seem to remember it's part of the whole "it's in your hands" thing.
do you mean it?
Trager, you're one of my best friends.
all I want is for you to be happy.
I don't know if I deserve that.
trust me, you do.
you did that, didn't you?
maybe.
so how do you do it all?
do what?
everything I've seen you do.
my brain is more developed than other people's.
it allows me to do special things.
kinda like superman, only real?
can you fly?
I'm not gonna tell you that
until you tell me something I don't know about you.
not this again. - it's only fair.
you may not know that...
I love you.
you do?
I do.
I love you, too.
here, don't get your feet wet.
there's a reason why people say we shouldn't expect too much.
no one wants to see someone they care about end up disappointed.
we instinctively act to protect our own from being hurt
and do what we can to make the right choices for the people we love.
but the reason we have expectations in the first place
is because we wanna aim as high as we can.
because when you love someone,
there's no limit to what you can accomplish.
Oh! I left my other clothes inside.
I'll get them. - No, I will.
no, let me help you.
again. - Always.
got everything you need?
I do now.
will you go to the prom with me?
Yes, I would love to go with you.
you don't wear a tuxedo to a funeral.
you wear one to a prom.
didn't you once tell me that going to a prom would be a fate worse than death?
I'm not asking you to go to prom 'cause there's no one else.
I'm asking 'cause you are the only one I want to go with.
are you telling me there are problems with the prom?
prom committee's become a nightmare of mix-ups with the decorators and arguments with the caterers.
I want prom to be this perfect night with kyle, and all I can think about is table and chair rentals and non-refundable deposits.
well, you should enter this in the contest.
I suppose.
although I'm sure three-chord trite piece of crap will win.
Brian told me all about the girl in the pictures, sarah.
he said he created me from sarah's genetic material after she died.
my name is sarah.
she's alive.
she wants to meet me, right?
Sarah said she'd be here. - She's not coming.
I'm alone! - You're not alone.
her heart has stopped.
it's okay now. I'm here.
the people in latnok aren't bad, they're simply scientists with a very clinical point of view.
he's incredible.
more than we'd ever dreamed we'd see in our lifetimes.
what are you watching?
if you're not back by midnight, you won't be coming home.
Oh.
that's not good.
why on earth would you watch prom night? It's scary.
it's video research for the prom.
you're researching the prom?
and it led you to prom night?
it had the most straightforward title.
what else did you look at?
44 movies, 2.6 million websites, and 37 young-adult novels.
pm is the most romantic moment in a young person's life.
it's the culmination of adolescence and marks the beginning of the journey into adulthood.
Pricilla's perfect prom. I love that book!
I wasn't always a cynic.
I know how important it is to Amanda.
I can't let her down.
I just need the perfect plan.
there's really no formula for perfection.
let me let you in on a little life secret.
the more you expect, the more you get let down.
Pricilla's prom was a disaster.
her date leaves her at the end of the night.
two chapters later, he's gay.
nice pep talk.
just focus on having fun, and you will.
don't let your expectations get the best of you.
expectations.
to them, the word implied inevitable failure.
was it wrong to have faith that things could turn out well?
I'm not sure which was more difficult to process, the news that sarah's alive or that you brought jessi back from the dead.
has sarah tried to contact you? - No.
and she won't.
she's put her past behind her, kyle, and I've accepted that I need to do the same.
your leg is better.
Yeah. It's good as new.
just in time for me to move on.
move on?
Kyle, I wasn't pleased that latnok was willing to test jessi like some kind of a laboratory rat.
it made me realize just how out of touch we all are with our own humanity.
so I need a break from the latnok community.
and I asked them to give you a break.
for me?
I haven't even met them.
well, they've been watching you for a while, waiting for an opportunity to take a larger role in your development.
they've been watching me?
believe me, I wasn't happy about it either.
but I've made it very clear to them that you have a whole lifetime to be extraordinary.
now is the time for you to be ordinary.
so I'd ask you to come along with me, but I think we both know what your answer would be.
it doesn't bother you that I wouldn't want to leave the Tragers?
I'll be back one day when it's time for us to resume out training.
in the meantime, I want you to stay here and enjoy what I never had.
what's that?
a life.
my sunset backdrop is a no-show, so I don't think this gym is gonna be transformed into the ocean paradise that I want.
we still have time. Maybe there's something
Kyle, really, I know I made a huge deal about the whole magic of prom, but I'll be happy if it wasn't a huge disaster.
this would be so much more fun if we were allowed to inhale.
will you guys please get him out of here?
Amanda, I don't think I should leave you here to deal with this by yourself.
Kyle, I have 27 perfectly capable people to help me hang lame streamers.
I, for one, am happy to pass the helium torch.
good.
save your energy for the end of tonight.
your sugar mama's got big plans for you.
is there anything else I can do?
no.
that was a lie.
you've just been busted by the human lie detector.
fess up, little lady.
okay, if you really want to help. - I really want to.
you can pick up my dress from the cleaners.
there was this whole-- well, it's a long story, but
I'd be happy to.
you don't have to bring everything.
we can start fresh.
I can get you some new clothes.
Why?
because of the memories of taylor not being exactly a good father?
I'm glad he left.
but I like my clothes.
I even like this room.
it's the first place I've ever been able to call mine.
now this brings back memories.
good ones?
good at the time.
sometimes I wonder if it's worth having good memories.
when things go wrong, you almost resent the happy moments, like they failed you.
that picture reminds me of kyle and everything we've been through together.
I hope I never have to resent that.
Yeah, I hope you never have to.
Jessi, I think we should leave seattle.
where would we go?
I don't know. Somewhere, anywhere else.
because of latnok?
I don't know.
maybe.
Seattle was a cage for me for 20 years, and being back here, I feel trapped.
would that be okay with you?
Yeah. Of course.
Andy says she has big plans for me.
you know what that means, don't you?
this dress is silver.
dude, you already said that. It's not important.
it's supposed to be yellow.
we're talking about me now, dude.
sorry.
what does it mean?
it means I need to be ready to round the bases.
round the bases?
prom night often results in extra bases, and considering I slid in to second with Andy a few weeks ago,
I'm looking at third base, if not an inside-the-park homer.
Josh, you should know by now, I have no idea what you're talking about.
sex. I'm talking about sex.
Yeah, and I've never.
you know.
had it. - With another person.
never mind.
the importance of prom night sex was portrayed in 82% of the movies I watched.
see?
but since 17% of them also ended with young teens being fatally mutilated,
I assumed it was a cinematic convention.
afraid not, buddy.
for much of the adolescent universe, the whole dance is basically just foreplay.
is sex part of the perfect prom equation?
don't you worry about it.
something tells me that sex isn't part of yours and Amanda's G-rated prom fantasy.
what is it?
nothing.
uh, no.
no line-dance songs. Come on.
what? - Ah!
you know it's inevitable. - Not if I can help it.
come on!
it's a prom must-do.
Yeah, then I think I must puke.
are you sure you don't want to just DJ the prom yourself?
please. Have you seen those geeks that DJ the proms?
ha ha ha! Hilarious.
besides, I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, remember?
Oh, you mean the lyric you actually neglected to include in your theme song?
it's been done.
besides, you and I both know that there's zero chance of winning that contest tonight, with my reedy voice and the 12th-rate acoustic recording.
you're really not expecting much, are you?
the thing about expectations
you know what? Forget it.
I've already busted out that speech once today.
so jaded for so young.
enough with the young already.
what's all this?
Amanda changed her dress, so the vest and the corsage I choose don't match unless I dye them.
well, can I help?
I know this may surprise you, but I used to be kinda good at arts and crafts.
I stripped the silver nitrate off some old rolls of film and combined it with aluminum potassium sulfate.
but I'm having trouble stabilizing the polyvalent metal ions needed to act as a mortar to set the dye pigment.
I once made a house out of popsicle sticks.
the dye is too dark and won't stick properly to the fabric.
Oh. Well, I'm sure Amanda will understand.
she will understand.
that's the problem.
she's already given up hope of having a good prom, but she shouldn't.
I just wanna make sure it's everything she wished for.
well, don't put too much pressure on yourself.
sometimes trying too hard to make things perfect can blow up in your face.
Hey.
how are you?
alive.
thanks to you.
you've made a mess.
I don't know why the formula didn't work.
let me see what I can do.
what are you looking for?
Adam said Latnok is watching me.
he told them to stop, but I still feel like someone's out there.
I think Latnok is creepy.
so does sarah.
how have things been going with her?
new.
exciting.
a little scary.
she wants to leave town.
Why? - To start over.
no, it's okay.
Sarah really wants this.
well, what do you want?
I want what you have.
a family.
have you told her that you'd rather stay?
no, I can't do that. - Why not?
because what if she leaves anyway?
not everyone who cares about you is going to disappoint you.
all I know is I'm being given a chance to have a real life.
I'm not gonna do anything to mess it up.
you're missing about ten milligrams of nickel iodine.
Oh, good.
I need to talk to you.
now's not the best time, dad.
well, it's never an appropriate time for a man to warn his daughter not to get involved with his teaching assistant, and yet, here we are.
I'm not getting involved with mark.
in case you haven't noticed, I'm in a towel getting ready for prom with declan.
a much better age-appropriate, all-around good choice I'm thinking.
my year of strumming sad chords was sponsored by Mr. Declan mcdonough.
not to mention his role in my disappearing reappearing virtue.
and about that- - don't worry, dad.
store's closed.
what store?
Tragerporium is locked tight.
no weekend sales, no limited time offers.
security system's armed.
guard dogs are roaming the aisle.
of course we're still encouraging window shopping, 'cause you always wanna keep the public interested.
but I can assure you that tonight will not be about sex.
I thought prom was basically just foreplay for much of the adolescent universe.
says who?
what's up?
not you, that's for sure.
what?
there'll be no sex had by you.
not. any of you.
not tonight, tomorrow, or hopefully in my lifetime.
smile.
what did you do? - What? Is it that obvious?
last time you had that look, you realized josh just found your old pot stash.
okay, so which parental sin did you commit?
the "don't blow the sex talk" one.
we already had that talk with Lori.
I'm not talking about Lori, or Kyle either.
Josh? Oh, stephen, he's not ready.
I know.
well, you have to go back up and talk to him again.
I know.
so why aren't you moving? - I don't know.
you only have a small window of opportunity to correct this.
I can't do it.
Yes.
Yes, you can. You can.
you are a smart, educated, progressive, thoughtful man, and--and.
an excellent father.
don't psych yourself out.
just go.
Hey, it looks like all the stains came out.
thank you for coming over to help out.
how can I pass up my last opportunity to prove that I'm smarter than you?
very funny.
I'm not, you know, smarter.
I just try harder to impress people.
but you already knew that.
you don't have to do that anymore.
you never have to prove yourself to anyone ever again.
if anything, people should start proving themselves to you.
you really don't want to see me leave, do you?
you're my friend, Jessi.
I don't want to lose you.
Hi. - Hi.
I have your dress.
it's not yellow.
I know, the dry cleaners accidentally shredded my original dress, so I had to make a last-minute switch.
at least now I'll match the gym.
how are things going down there?
almost done.
but would you mind dropping the dress off at school?
at the school?
won't you be home soon?
I'm just taking some precautions.
you know, in case the decorations committee hits a snag and I have to get ready here.
I'm coming to help you.
Kyle, don't.
I'm dirty and a mess.
and even though everything else is a bust right now,
I don't want you to see me until I'm ready.
just send the dress.
but I - promise me you won't come in.
I promise.
good.
it's still wet.
I'll take care of it.
I should at least take it to her and explain.
Kyle, you need to get ready.
I'll finish the dress, and I'll take it to Amanda.
it will all be okay.
you want to do something nice for Amanda?
no, but I'd like to do something nice for you.
come in.
what's with the shades?
Whoa! - Yeah.
all the makeup, like, ever, is on your face.
I wanna look "va va voomy" for josh, but I keep coming up with vampire clown whore.
can you help me?
you have two moms. Doesn't one of them wear a little lip-gloss?
my moms think that makeup is an ageist, sexist ploy to devalue the feminine form in its natural state perpetuating unrealistic myths and expectations.
Yeah. Well.
maybe it is.
come here.
Oh.
nice job.
I downloaded an instructional diagram.
stephen will be disappointed he wasn't able to help you.
the ultimate father/son prom ritual.
I forgot. - No, no, no, no.
don't worry about stephen.
don't worry about anyone but yourself.
and Amanda.
and Amanda.
Oh. Beautiful.
I got it from the rose garden where we had our first kiss.
you thought of everything.
I tried.
don't forget to stop and smell the roses every so often yourself tonight.
actually double-dyeing the corsage eliminated the scent of
you mean to focus less on making things perfect and more on having a good time.
Yes.
look at you.
when you first came here, everything in the world was new.
look at all you've learned.
look at all you've overcome.
tonight's a celebration of that.
just breathe and enjoy it.
I'm sorry you had to say good-bye to adam.
he's doing what he thinks is best for me.
still, I know it's hard to say good-bye to family.
Adam created me.
he's my mentor and my friend.
but you are my family.
your decorations are ugly.
they'll look better once we turn the lights down.
all right. Fine. It sucks.
it's like Charlie Brown's christmas tree.
I don't know what that means. - Ugly. It means ugly.
and everyone else left, so I don't have time to go home.
I have to get ready here.
I just wanted to make it special for kyle, but I blew it.
anyways, thanks for the dress.
did you deliver the dress?
your prom is going to be terrible.
Why?
well, the decorations are a disaster, and Amanda has to get ready in the school locker room.
why didn't she ask me for help?
she wanted to make it special for you.
she did?
maybe if you two stopped working so hard to make it special, you'd enjoy it more.
or maybe there's still something I can do to fix it.
I figured you'd say something like that.
which is why you called.
thank you.
this doesn't mean I like her, by the way.
I know.
thanks to Jessi, I had an idea of how to make Amanda's night a little better.
her expectations may have disappeared, but my desire to surpass them hadn't.
could this day get any worse?
not funny.
I thought, uh, you could use some help getting ready.
what?
did you poison my makeup or put fleas in my dress?
I think you like being mean to me.
well, that's just a little bit of the pot calling the kettle black, now, isn't it?
the pot and the kettle are black.
my point exactly.
well, after tonight, it doesn't matter anyway.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means I'm leaving town.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why?
you hate me.
but I know how important you are to Kyle.
and when you care about somebody, you wanna put their feelings first.
so how's it going?
all set.
oops!
you have to scuff the bottom of your shoes before you walk in them.
helps give you traction. - Yeah.
I didn't know that.
actually, I didn't either. Kyle told me.
the prom know-it-all strikes again.
so, listen-- - please don't.
I have to.
then could you make it quick and painless, please?
all right. You want it quick and painless?
don't use this.
you don't want me to have safe sex? - No.
