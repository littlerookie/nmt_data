I... I was embarrassed 'cause of how I treated you
I... I was going to.
I... I was in a children's home since I was ten.
I... I was just thinking
I... I was just trying to keep the wind off my face.

I... I went to see the ocean.
I... I went to tell her to get ready for bed,
I... I will be on the road to recovery,
I... I will kill you guys
I... I wish I'd never been born.
I... I wish you woulda told me, I wouldn't have gone on a ten - hour run.

I... I wouldn't want to miss her first words.
I... I yelled out, and the bottle broke,
I... I'd be...
I... I'd be... I'm sorry, I just mean that I think I should fly under the radar.
I... I'd given him a random drug test that he failed.
I... I'd hate to see him fall off the wagon again.
I... I'd hate to think that I may have been that...
I... I'd like that very much.
I... I'd love to hear.
I... I'd love to help, but I need a sign of good faith.
I... I'd love to, but I don't have any gear, so...
I... I'd offer you my hand, but I might not get it back.

I... I've come to ask for a sword.
I... I've come to know you, I think.

I... I... Could help you find her, if you like.
I... I... I am listening to you. - you're not.
I... I... I am sick and tired of going to the funerals...
I... I... I can't! Not in this storm. I... I can't even see her.
I... I... I could've tried to have been more fun and sexy like I was in the old days.
I... I... I cried. I wept like...
I... I... I didn't know that you two were still together.
I... I... I don't know how this works.
I... I... I don't know. Just give me your location.
I... I... I found her like that.
I... I... I fucking roofied myself.
I... I... I love the... Air.
I... I... I must have called you a hundred times.
I... I... I need to find someone. He came in here a while ago.
I... I... I saw her purse and the keys...
I... I... I'd like to keep it that way.
I... I... I'm just...
I... I... I'm not gonna play games with you.
I... I... I'm not sending her away.
I... I... I'm saying you don't look so good.
I... I... I'm sorry, kiddo. I'm sorry.
I... I... I've just been informed by some of the lads

I... Is there something specific that you wanted?
I... Is there something wrong?
I... Is this a bad time?
I... Is this all?
I... Is this my fault?
I... It broke her heart when Aaron left,
I... It is behind me.
I... It just doesn't work.
I... It just seems like everything... You knew?
I... It looks like we got a slight malfunction in a rear nogginizer.
I... It must be a terrible burden... The gift you have.
I... It seems I am.
I... It seems to be going very well.
I... It should have reverted to human form
I... It sounds terrible, I know, but I really don't know.
I... It was a barbecue.
I... It was an armed man running at me in the subway firing at me.
I... It was basically a long, rambling, awkward apology.
I... It was because I... I believed that...
I... It was because I... I believed that...
I... It was not so easy as I thought.
I... It was really sweet of you to worry.
I... It was too fast, somehow.
I... It wasn't exactly warm and fuzzy.
I... It wasn't just me. It was Frannie and the standards board too.
I... It wasn't just me. It was Frannie and the standards board too.
I... It would never be my first choice to cause you pain.

I... It's just a suggestion.
I... It's just, it's been three days and... And three nights now.
I... It's just, you got me thinking.
I... It's just...
I... It's me.
I... It's my bedtime.
I... It's not about you.
I... It's not her. You know my wife.
I... It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I... It's not that I don't care.
I... It's not true. It's...
I... It's not you. it's...
I... It's okay.
I... It's okay. It's okay.
I... It's quite the opposite.
