vital statistics related to birth, death, marriage, etc.
odom is averaging 27 minutes per game this season.
odom is long and has a high release on his shot. There won't be many players who can close out on odom and then block his shot, especially since odom should spend most of this season matched up against shorter defenders at the small forward position.
odom is streaky, but he can dribble with the best of them and works great in the triangle offense with gasol and bryant backing him up.
odom probably will play the rest of the season at power forward, with luke walton or trevor ariza starting at small forward.
odom stayed and talked in the cramped locker room about what bryant and fisher have provided-"the poise and the killer instinct they gave us is incredible," odom said.
odom was 1-of-7 from the field in the first half and guard derek fisher was scoreless.
odom was coming back from shoulder surgery he had last spring.
odom's solution was to leave and start his own company, drawing his first clients from among the contacts he had made in previous management jobs.
odom, chris mihm and andrew bynum each had 10 rebounds.
