cough-variant asthma is a type of asthma in which the main symptom is a dry, non-productive cough.
cough-variant asthma is sometimes called chronic cough to describe a cough that has lasted longer than six to eight weeks.
cough-variant asthma is somewhat difficult to diagnose because the cough may be the only symptom, and cough itself may appear to be bronchitis or cough associated with postnasal drip.
cough-variant asthma is treated in the same way that typical asthma is treated.
