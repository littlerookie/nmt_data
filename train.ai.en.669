shooting with your heart sounds a little abstract, huh? Well really, it's pretty easy. The key is to shoot ALL the time. A great way to get over that hurdle is to pretend you've been given a crazy opportunity with a huge travel magazine (think Budget Travel or National Geographic). Of course, there will be a lot of bad shots and that's OK. What you're aiming for here is finding your voice through the camera. Just keep on shooting, and over time you'll find an underlying theme. Most people simply don't shoot enough to discover their hidden photographic voice. The key is not to overthink it. Just shoot it. The rest will happen naturally.
