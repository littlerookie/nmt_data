he'll kill you as well if that's what he wants.
you just can't accept the fact.
I can make you a better offer.
no killing.
I can get you out of here now-- today, if you want.
I can get you money, a new identity, uh, set you up with a new life far away from here.
you can do that?
Yes, I can.
I can do anything you want if you give me Red John.
I want...
your trust and friendship.
you have that.
I don't believe you.
how can I make you believe?
kiss me.
what does that prove?
first you say you'll do anything I want, then you refuse the first thing I ask for.
you're very complicated.
let me get you out of here.
I need time to think.
not for long.
I don't know how much longer we're gonna get to keep you here.
we'll talk again this evening.
what are you? Huh?
crazy? - Excuse me?
I told you to be careful.
I told you not to go over the edge.
and I told you not to listen.
don't be childish!
I am not your girlfriend.
I am an officer of the law.
how could I not listen?
you kissed her.
you offered to help her escape.
and I would ask her to marry me if I thought she'd buy it.
I was playing her.
she's playing you.
we should have given her to the feds.
um... M. E. sent his report on Callie and Rex.
confirmed it's not possible they killed each other.
and Callie had a small white feather lodged in the back of her mouth.
a feather, huh? Like from a pillow? - Right.
which suggests Callie was strangled by hand and suffocated with a pillow, probably in that order.
why two methods?
two different people?
or the killer wasn't strong enough to complete the strangulation.
right. - A woman?
women can strangle people.
Oh, believe me, I know I could.
Where's Cho and Rigsby?
I got a line on Rex Lango finally.
changed his name.
used to be Erzat Lonagul out of Bakersfield.
Cho and Rigsby drove down there to speak to his family.
nobody could say his name, so he changed it to Rex.
he was gonna be a big businessman, and he thought that sounded rich.
was there any particular business he was interested in?
you know, he was good at computers.
but he didn't know yet exactly.
the Internet, robots, or whatever.
any brushes with the law?
shady friends?
no. My cousin was a good man.
he was a good man, and he's gone now, so be nice.
he was a bum!
he was not.
he nearly always had a job, and he was never in trouble with the law.
is that a bum?
he was never in trouble because he was too sneaky!
the kid was stealing candy and quarters from before he could walk.
and then he would lie to your face like a rug seller!
he was a dog to the women always!
a bum!
dishonest, greedy, selfish womanizer.
Yeah, but not a criminal.
just a sleaze.
he left Bakersfield two years ago to avoid a paternity suit.
they had no idea he was in SAC.
last they heard, he was in L. A.
that's interesting.
so like I said, it's a love triangle.
but we've got no jealous boyfriend, and I can't see Callie dating a sleaze like him.
and she logged no calls or texts to him, right?
Nope.
I'm waiting for her e-mail records.
I couldn't get them direct from her P. C. The hard drive is fried.
well, that's why he was there.
he was in tech support, right? So he offers to fix her computer.
how could she refuse?
and then what happened?
I don't know. I gotta run.
Lorelei's on her way up from holding.
wait.
we still haven't resolved our issue.
I don't think you should be talking to Lorelei.
you're too close.
well, I disagree.
I could put a stop to this right now.
one word to Bertram about what you've been-- Please don't do that.
I know I can turn her.
I know I can.
and I promise you I will be careful.
thank you.
hello.
stand down, man.
I'm taking charge of this prisoner.
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?
this is a federal judge's warrant transferring custody of Lorelei to the FBI.
no, no, no. You can't do that. - Back off.
no, don't touch me.
stand down. - Don't let them take me.
wait, wait! You can't just touch me! - Patrick!
there isn't a choice.
we have to get her back.
Jane, the FBI outfoxed us.
th-they only pretended to give up Lorelei while they were preparing the warrant to take her.
we should have known they wouldn't fold.
just deal with it.
I-I'd have to strong-arm a judge and the FBI into an arbitration hearing, and even then...
well, do it.
the FBI know how to interrogate people.
they'll do a fine job.
they will either kill her, or she'll escape.
and we will lose our best chance-- the best chance we have had of getting to Red John.
kill her?
the--the FBI?
d-don't be ridiculous.
red John has a friend high up in the FBI.
Oh, please.
now how do you know that?
he told me.
well, there you go.
if we don't get her, I will blow this whole cover-up wide open.
the truth of Wainright's death, all over the news.
if you do that, this whole deal collapses, and you go to jail.
I don't care.
you call a hearing, or I will be very glad to sing like a bird.
well, I've studied all the documents in this matter and it is very clear to me that all of you people are lying through your teeth.
judge-- No, I don't want to know.
whatever sordid errors you're all conspiring to cover up, I don't want to know.
the sole purpose of this meeting is to decide who is best equipped to have custody of Lorelei Martins.
I will decide in favor of whichever side irritates me the least.
I will tolerate no misbehavior of any kind.
proceed with care.
your Honor, I would ask you to simply to look at the record of Patrick Jane.
red John killed his family.
Lorelei Martins is a close confederate of Red John.
how can this man possibly treat her with the clarity and the objectivity required?
he's not a trained professional.
he's a vigilante.
and that alone should disqualify the CBI from custody in this matter.
for many years, I have been pursuing Red John.
I know this case better than anybody else.
these people, they don't know how to make Lorelei Martins talk.
I do.
if I may interject, Miss Martins tells us that she has had sexual relations with Mr. Jane.
that may be the source of his confidence.
is that so?
Yes, it is.
we have a relationship.
uh, that's a good thing.
that's how you turn people.
I'd expected a denial, to be honest.
do we need to continue?
um, that does tend to disqualify you, Mr. Jane.
so, um, if you have nothing further-- she's already given me valuable information.
let's not stop me now.
valuable information like what?
with all due respect, this is not the time or the place to share the details.
if you want to see Lorelei Martins again, this is both the time and the place.
she told me that all Red John's friends have a secret sign they use to identify each other.
and what is it?
go on.
they carry a glass bead in their pocket-- blood red, the size of a pea.
Lorelei showed me hers.
that's it?
Un-provable trivia?
it proves she trusts me.
it proves nothing.
can we stop this farce now?
it is a bit thin, Mr. Jane. Is that all you have?
no. Not at all.
well?
red John has an accomplice inside the FBI.
come on.
judge, this man is just spinning fantasies now.
Yes, you would say that.
I saw you.
what do you mean by that?
when I mentioned the glass bead, you suddenly looked very guilty and you glanced at your right-hand jacket pocket.
what's in there, Mancini?
this--this is the same thing that you did to Norris.
son of a bitch-- Agent.
what's in your pocket, Mancini?
there's nothing--this is a childish trick, Your Honor.
th-this man has just planted a bead on me.
uh, let's be clear.
I have not touched you.
everybody in this room has seen that.
but you're saying that there is in fact a red glass bead in your pocket.
is that what you're saying?
No!
you're putting words in my mouth.
show us what's in your pockets, Agent.
you don't understand-- Show us!
he planted it.
he planted it!
but he didn't touch you, did he?
he-- you son of a bitch!
Ah, well done.
good job.
when do we get her back?
uh, judge says we can pick her up at county jail tomorrow.
did, uh, Mancini really throw a bottle at you?
Yes, he did, and then he proceeded to chase me through the state house, but failed to catch me.
Congratulations. Another mortal enemy made.
you should be very proud.
uh, meanwhile, we've got a case to solve.
well, let's get busy then, boss.
so let's just assume that Rex was at Callie's apartment to fix her computer.
what happened next?
how does that escalate to a double murder?
well, maybe the computer is key.
maybe there was something important on the hard drive.
she cleans hotel rooms. What could be important?
how does that connect to her lipstick on his cheek?
he couldn't fix her computer so they made out instead?
well, there are other reasons for kissing someone.
celebration, for instance, hence the champagne.
what would they be celebrating?
well, maybe the kiss was,"thanks for trying to fix my computer."
so who's the third person here?
what are we missing?
sorry I'm late.
they're setting up a stage for the state lottery prize presentation at the capital.
traffic on L Street was crazy.
they should do that at Raley Field or someplace where they have parking.
uh, when did computer forensics say they'd be done with Callie's hard drive?
end of the week, but-- Got it!
what?
Callie's sister--Nicola. You have a phone number?
ladies and gentlemen, friends, it is my very great pleasure to introduce to you at this time the lucky winner of this year's biggest lottery jackpot.
please welcome to the stage a young woman who is now worth $56 million, Valerie Whittaker.
come on out here, Valerie.
there you go, Valerie.
Congratulations.
thank you!
thank you so, so, so much.
I'm so blessed.
thank you.
Valerie, how you feeling?
I'm just in shock.
it's like a movie.
any plans for the money?
not yet.
I'm gonna take a flier.
do you happen to know a Tom Yannick of the Sacramento Police?
no. - Are you sure?
cause I'm pretty sure.
who else would have had the opportunity, a random intruder?
unlikely.
he's not your boyfriend then?
okay. Just a moment.
Valerie, this is Nicola Karlsen.
she's Callie Karlsen's sister, the woman that was brutally murdered for the lottery ticket that won that check you're holding there.
would you tell her you don't know Tom Yannick?
I-- You told me nothing would go wrong!
No! Stop, stop!
thomas Yannick...you're under arrest for murder.
Yes.
this doesn't belong to you.
we're gonna have to get the name changed.
do you have a marker pen?
Callie was checking the lottery numbers while Rex tried to fix her computer.
she won $56 million.
she kissed Rex, got the champagne out of the fridge, then she called her sister.
then greed got the better of Rex, and he tried to strangle Callie so he could steal the ticket.
but she killed him instead with a champagne bottle and called 9-1-1.
then half-strangled and in shock, she fainted.
and that's where you come in.
you found the two of them, and you saw the ticket.
you put 2 and 2 together-- quite the detective.
so you killed Callie.
you think about it for a while, or you just go for it?
I-I thought about it for a while.
I felt bad for her.
but $56 million, man.
Yeah. Well, you should have thought about it a while longer.
thank you.
thank you, thank you.
you are such a good man.
thank you.
sorry to interrupt, Nicola, but Jane and I have to pick up a prisoner.
thank you.
pleasure.
come on!
what is taking so long?
relax.
she'll be here.
look, I-I'm sorry, by the way.
for what?
there's a long list of possibilities.
Yeah, well, this is more of a...
general purpose apology.
use it for your top issue.
Thanks.
- Who's this?
5467B.
that's not her.
there's been a mistake.
there's no mistake.
her paperwork's all in order.
it's the only Lorelei Martins we got.
two drops in each ear twice a day.
we're gonna fix you right up, kid.
shouldn't Lisbon have called by now?
she said she would call when there was a break in the case.
I mean, maybe there wasn't one.
I'm gonna call her anyway.
can you take her? Yeah.
no, I'm not!
except for when there's things to worry about.
Hello?
Hey, it's Rigsby. Any news?
I was gonna call you from the car.
SFPD is sending the case over to us.
Hey, they got the case from SFPD.
Oh, that's great.
that's great. How'd you convince them?
when you're FBI, people tend to give you what you want.
had they developed any leads?
not really.
they agree that whoever murdered LaRoche and Ardiles bugged our phones.
it's probably somebody we arrested at the CBI, someone holding a grudge.
I'm putting together a list. I'll keep you posted.
okay. That's great. I'll talk to you soon.
coming.
can you give her her drops while I get her bath started?
Oh, sure. Yeah. Thanks.
go see daddy.
come on.
there we go.
okay.
all righty.
let's see what we got.
all righty, kiddo.
this won't hurt a bit.
at least I, uh, think it won't.
No!
are you all right?!
Wayne, is she hurt? Is she hurt?
she's okay. She's okay.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
she's okay.
we're okay.
and if she has trouble falling asleep, try taking her for a ride in the car.
that usually puts her right out.
Thanks. I'll call you later.
Maddy's gonna be fine with your aunt.
I know.
and Ben's gonna be fine with his mother.
they're both gonna be just fine.
Hey, come on.
lisbon: Hey.
welcome to Austin.
you okay? Yeah.
Yeah. We're okay, considering.
you settled into your motel?
well, we heard back from the crime techs in San Francisco.
it looks like the intruder got into your house through a basement window that wasn't on your alarm system.
did forensics find anything?
no, ballistics ran the casings that were recovered from the crime scene.
there weren't any matches.
any eyewitnesses?
people heard shots, but nobody saw anything.
come on. We're just about to start the briefing.
Hey. We're gonna get this guy.
come on.
we believe the assailant is the same person that killed attorney Osvaldo Ardiles and former California Bureau of Investigation agent
now, in your packets, you'll find a preliminary list of suspects.
some are still incarcerated, but it's possible he's orchestrating this from prison.
now, there are 12 names, so we have our work cut out for us.
acquaint yourselves with the case files.
I'll be assigning individual suspects for you to investigate later this morning.
thank you.
good to see you, guys.
Yeah, you, too.
how you doing? All right.
just got word that the FBI has officially hired you as consultants for the case.
you're the ones who first found out we were being tracked.
you know this case better than anybody.
don't worry. We'll figure out who it is.
not anytime soon, the way you're going about this.
12 suspects?
I had Wylie run the suspects through the VICAP database.
those are the ones that were flagged.
what's their connection to Ardiles?
well, he was involved in all their prosecutions.
PATRICK: Well, that's fine and dandy, but we're the ones that caught them and questioned them, and we certainly know them better than any database.
what do you think we should do?
I think we should trust our instincts.
you mean take a wild guess.
80% of the time, a detective's first guess is right.
you just made that up.
and you knew that because your instincts told you.
now, come on. Everyone, pick a photo.
whoever looks right.
John Hutten, the bank robber.
he's smart, determined.
I could see him trying something like this.
Yeah, you have a hunch.
grace, don't be shy. I'll go with Donny Culpepper.
he's a professional criminal implicated in several murders.
this wouldn't be a stretch.
Cho, you know you want to a sociopath if ever there was one.
I don't know. Richard Haibach?
linus Wagner, maybe.
the pedophile and the homicidal shrink.
excellent choices.
now we have a set of suspects.
okay, we'll go with those five.
I'll have my agents work the other seven.
to start, we need to know who's in prison, who's out, and who they've talked to recently.
Yes, well, that's not really my sort of thing, so if you need any more help, I'll be on my couch.
I need some help.
Hi. Agent Fischer.
Oh, hey.
I want you to know that everyone here is 100% behind this investigation.
we appreciate that. Thank you.
but since there's nothing for you to do here,
I'm stealing you.
we've got another case.
no rest for the wicked.
where did the wheel of death stop today?
Bradley, Texas, an hour west.
a body was found this morning on a fracking site.
a worker discovered the victim in a wastewater pit.
the victim's name is Dan Becker.
he's a local rancher
small-time, 50 acres or so.
couple of months ago, he brought a lawsuit against a regional energy company called Millman Oil.
they're the frackers?
Yeah, they've been developing frack sites for the past couple of years.
the one where the body was found is leased federal land.
that's why we caught the case.
Becker sued because he claimed the company polluted his ranch's groundwater.
an anti-fracker found dead on the site of the company he just sued.
that's murder gold.
well, we don't know the company's involved.
we shouldn't leap to any conclusions.
of course we should.
that way, it'll go a little quicker.
sheriff says the coroner took the body about an hour ago.
Oh, good. Seen enough of those.
excuse me, gentlemen. Hi, there.
I'm FBI agent Fischer. This is my colleague, Patrick Jane.
we'd like to ask you a few questions about Dan Becker's murder.
uh, just -- just you.
the rest of you can go home.
no, they can't. Yes, they can.
they just work here. He's in charge.
well, stay close. We'll get to you in a minute.
what makes you say I'm in charge?
your snakeskin boots, your nice, stiff black jeans, shiny belt buckle...
that air of command that you have about you.
well, I'm Jason Kern, chief operating officer.
well, you make the tough decisions around here
who to fire, who to hire, who to bribe.
well, I wish I could do that.
boy, that'd make my job easier, wouldn't it?
no need to be so coy.
you're big oil. You can do whatever you want, right?
well, you're a character, aren't you?
so, why do you think this was murder?
the coroner says the likely cause of death was a blow to the head.
so it's murder, or he, uh...
fell and hit his head.
be that as it may, we'll assist your investigation any way we can.
because we are not big oil, sir.
we're a regional company.
we're part of the communities we work in.
when we succeed, they thrive.
uh, something is not thriving.
Yeah, our equipment keeps shutting down started right after those yahoos protested at our offices yesterday.
what yahoos would that be?
group that calls itself The Cooperative.
they're anti-corporate "hacktivists"
who spread mischief over the Internet.
we think they're interfering with the computer that runs the hydraulic pumps.
maybe you should be talking to them about Becker.
you think an anti-corporate group was responsible for the murder of an anti-fracker?
ma'am, all I know is The Cooperative likes a grand gesture, and they don't care who they hurt to stop the corporate agenda.
now, would they kill a man and try to blame us for it?
I wouldn't put it past them.
look, I'm afraid I got my hands full just now, all right?
you have more questions, you all come by the office.
it'll be easier to chat there.
all right, guys. What's -- what's going on here?
folksy.
Whew.
Yeah, let's go talk to Becker's family, see what they have to say.
Okey okey, ma'am.
well, that's one suspect eliminated.
linus Wagner's been in solitary confinement for the past five months.
you can take Culpepper off the list.
he got married and moved to Venezuela.
he hasn't been back in the states in over a year.
so who do you like now?
I keep on coming back to Haibach.
he was on Jane's fake Red John list.
Kirkland tortured and nearly killed him. I'd hold a grudge.
does he have an alibi? I have a call into his office in Denver.
I got something.
John Hutten's out of prison.
apparently he's on work release.
his new address is in Houston.
that's two hours from here.
but Hutten's a bank robber. He's not a killer.
well, whoever attacked the house bypassed the security system, and that took planning. That sounds like Hutten.
I'll go talk to him.
mind if I come with? Sure.
can I drive? No.
why not?
consultants don't drive. It's policy.
Whose? Mine.
Oh, come on.
Mrs. Becker? Uh, no.
I'm -- I'm Susan -- Susan Fitzgerald.
I'm a family friend.
but Molly's here somewhere.
I'm agent Fischer with the FBI.
this is Patrick Jane.
may we come in?
of course, yes.
this is my husband, Emmett.
hello.
uh, I'm -- I'm sorry. Where is the kitchen?
it's right through there. Thank you.
they're with the FBI.
lisbon: How long did you two know Dan?
Oh, since he was a kid.
we've always been close.
that's what makes this so hard.
who are you?
I'm Patrick Jane.
I'm with the FBI.
you -- you must be Molly.
sorry for your loss.
thank you.
I wouldn't fill that in the tap.
use the bottled water.
groundwater's full of methane. Been that way almost a year.
fracking. Yeah.
wonderful, isn't it?
killed off a bunch of our cattle, too.
mm, well, I can see why Dan wanted to sue.
Dan was gonna win that lawsuit, come hell or high water.
you thought the suit was a bad idea?
I just didn't see the point.
nobody's gonna testify against Millman Oil.
they make everybody too much money.
and that lawsuit did not make Dan very popular in town,
I'll tell you that much.
there were other reasons, though.
weren't there?
we could've sold instead of suing.
we need the money.
and Dan could barely work with his hurt back.
and then Dan couldn't pass the ranch
he's on his way home from a camping trip.
it meant a lot to Dan that his son would get the land that he got from his father, and...
...he was stubborn.
now there's nothing stopping you.
you gonna sell?
just as soon as I can.
and what do you think about Millman Oil?
well...
I'll say it.
they saved this town.
it was dying. They brought it back to life.
so you don't think they had anything to do with Dan's death?
No! No. No way. You're a fool, Fitzgerald.
Oh, man.
and who are you?
me and Danny known each other since we was kids.
I knew him better than anybody.
and I wouldn't trust these two idiots.
Millman Oil...
they're behind this.
come on, Bryce.
that company is ruining this town.
police, politicians
they ain't lifting a finger, because they're bought off.
here we go again.
nobody dares cross them.
Dan tried. Hmm? Look what happened to him.
they didn't kill Dan. That's crazy.
only reason you're saying that, Emmett...
is 'cause you're in bed with them.
Yeah, by the way, they sold their fracking rights quick as they could.
money whores, the both of them.
you would've done the same thing if you had any land worth selling.
Yeah.
you smug son of a bitch.
fischer: It's all right, everyone.
Yeah. Uh-huh. It's under control.
I'm cool. I'm cool.
sorry.
now, why are you so convinced that Millman Oil killed Dan?
about a couple of weeks ago, they sent a bunch of thugs out here to rough him up,
hurt him bad. Busted up his back.
they wanted old Danny to drop his lawsuit.
said he wouldn't do it.
I didn't see a police report.
he didn't go to the police.
I told you...
everyone in this town is on their payroll.
did Dan know who ordered the attack?
he had his suspicions, yeah.
Yeah, there was someone behind the payoffs and the threats and...
some bigwig with Millman Oil.
which bigwig?
Danny didn't know.
but it was one of them.
Hi. Can I help you?
FBI, ma'am. We're looking for John Hutten.
Johnny, FBI's here.
it's okay, darling.
go ahead.
sorry I can't stay.
see you Wednesday afternoon, okay?
Yeah. Have a good flight.
I remember you guys from California.
FBI, huh? That's a step up.
what are you doing out of prison?
spending time with my wife.
she's a good woman. I enjoy domestic life.
how did you get out so soon?
behaved myself. They let me go.
prison overcrowding -- it's a problem.
you been to San Francisco recently?
Why? Answer the question.
I don't know that I remember.
maybe it'll come to you back at our office.
let's go.
that's an excellent idea.
I've been wanting to get out of the house.
Yeah. We've got Hutten.
we'll be back in a couple hours.
ready? One second.
all right. Let's go.
FBI!
hands where I can see them! Hey, take it easy!
I'm FBI, too!
Kimball Cho. This is Wayne Rigsby.
it's cool.
I'm Miller, Houston bank robbery division.
what the hell are you doing with Hutten?
we're taking him in for questioning.
no, you can't do that.
and why not? Why not?
because he works for me.
Hutten's been working for my team for the past year to take down bank-robbery rings.
that's why they let him out early.
did I not mention that?
he's also a suspect in two homicides.
homicides?
you're kidding. When?
within the last two weeks, both in San Francisco.
has Hutten been there recently?
San Jose.
we had an operation there. Just got back yesterday.
but [scoffs] you got the wrong guy.
San Jose's an hour from my house.
he could've done this. Yeah.
no, see, I-I think Miller would've known.
do you see that dot?
that's Hutten. He wears an ankle-monitoring device.
I know where he is at all times.
that's how I knew he left the house, for God's sake.
he's not your killer.
w-we're done here, aren't we?
Yeah. Yeah, we are.
best of luck, guys.
you from the FBI?
Yes.
samuel Millman.
I own this place.
welcome, welcome.
agent Kim Fischer.
Jason told me about you.
maybe you agree with what these people did to my company.
but come on. I'll show you something there.
stop fracking now!
stop fracking now!
they call themselves The Cooperative, whatever the hell that means.
the music is some kind of calling card.
you know, in my day, if you had a problem with someone, you would just tell them face-to-face, none of this computer-hacking nonsense
not that I pretend to understand any of it.
are you looking into the possibility that they killed that poor man, Becker?
your Mr. Kern asked exactly the same thing.
it's a valid theory.
fischer: Yeah, perhaps.
but The Cooperative is an online activist group.
murder is a different thing.
well, look at that.
you speak of the devil, and he shall appear.
Mr. Jane, Ms. Fischer.
to, uh, what do we owe the pleasure?
did either of you deal directly with Dan Becker?
not me.
in the last few years,
I've taken a step back from the day-to-day operations.
the, uh, company shifted its focus to our fracking activities.
that's, uh, my area of expertise.
Oh, so you would've been the one who ordered the assault on Becker.
that's funny. Yeah.
no, there have been no assaults ordered or, uh, anything like that.
you'd think a man in your position would be a better liar.
Mr. Jane, we're not an evil company.
uh, you truly believe that, don't you?
of course I do! Look, we're the victims here.
what the hell? What...
what's going on here?
this is The Cooperative.
Millman Oil has committed its latest crime
the murder of a man named Dan Becker.
this will not go unpunished.
the Cooperative will be listening.
the Cooperative will be watching.
and we will not rest until justice is served.
well, that was weird.
and it's obvious they think Millman Oil's behind this, but why?
you said that The Cooperative hacked into their office.
maybe they found something to connect them to the murder.
so why not come to us with it?
these kind of groups aren't what you'd call "FBI friendly."
we're investigating half of them for cyber crimes.
so how do we find out what The Cooperative knows?
you could start with whoever made that video.
can you track him down, Wylie?
Yeah, I can try.
let me know if you find anything.
well, I heard one of your suspects didn't pan out.
Hutten? Big bust.
we only have a few more names on the list.
we're running low.
I need to see you in my office.
agent Lisbon, Laura Dubin...
...Attorney for Richard Haibach.
Mr. Haibach is in Denver, but I'm going to conference him in.
Hello, Richard.
I'm here with agents Abbott and Lisbon.
you damn people are
one moment, Richard, please.
agent Abbott, did you know agent Lisbon contacted Mr. Haibach's employer to ask about his whereabouts during Osvaldo Ardiles' murder?
I was not aware of that.
for the record,
Mr. Haibach was at a dinner with two coworkers.
I want to know what justification you have for endangering my career!
uh, this is an active investigation.
I'm not at liberty to say more.
which means you have nothing to say.
agent Abbott, my client has suffered enough at the hands of agent Lisbon.
if you continue to do this, we will have no choice but to sue.
that won't be necessary.
good.
I may consider the investigation into Mr. Haibach closed?
you may.
I want an apology from her, from agent Lisbon's lips!
Mr. Haibach, I am very sorry if I've caused you any inconvenience.
it won't happen again.
it better not!
agents.
please, sir, you can't drop this.
we're not.
there's something off about that man.
I want you to put a surveillance team together, but just give it 24 hours before you do.
I want him to think that he's off the hook.
Yes, sir.
okay, buddy.
I'll see you soon.
I love you.
how's Ben? He's fine.
please tell me you have some good news.
wish I did.
volker's in federal lockup, so I had the prison check his communications for the last six months.
there's nothing there.
anything on the other seven suspects?
a few leads. No breakthroughs.
which leaves us with Haibach, who we have nothing on.
take a break. Get something to eat.
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
of course he used an anonymizing proxy server.
why would you want to make my life easy?
was I talking out loud?
no problem.
I'm Grace.
I'm Wylie. Um...
sorry if I disturbed you.
excuse me.
want some help?
ever try cracking a daisy-chained anonymizing proxy server?
sure. What's going on?
well, uh, a cooperative member posted a video earlier today.
I'm looking for the upload location.
problem is, he routed it through 70 different servers.
well, a lot of times, these guys use public computers to avoid detection.
I checked that -- 20 of the servers are public locations.
did you unlock the video's file attributes?
I know some good forensic-decryption software.
dorsey, maybe?
mcclaren. It's faster.
here we go
he uploaded the video today at about 5: 00 p. m.
interesting.
he posted dozens of videos, all of them uploaded between 5: 00 p. m. and midnight.
any of the public locations open late?
fischer: Wylie says our guy's been uploading videos from this lab almost every night between 5: 00 and midnight.
it's 9: 00 now, so he may be here.
Yeah.
but it could be anyone.
PATRICK: Hmm.
it's him.
are you sure?
Yeah, look at his eyes -- all squirrelly.
don't you think?
excuse me, sir?
FBI. I need to ask you a few questions, please.
I lied. It's him.
sir...
wa-- FBI. Stop!
Hey, hey! Woman: What are you doing?!
sorry. Man: Don't do that!
sorry. Shh. Leave him alone!
enrolled at U. T. at the age of 14, dropped out after one semester.
arrested a year later for hacking into NASA.
I assume you have a point.
I don't think that you are a run-of-the-mill cooperative type.
if I had to take a guess...
...I would say that you are the one in charge.
you believe that Millman Oil is responsible for Dan Becker's death.
Why?
well, call it a hunch.
I-I don't think you understand, Mr. Zorn.
the federal government doesn't treat cyber crimes lightly.
conspiracy to engage in hacking carries a 10-year sentence.
now, you may be tough behind a computer, but in a cellblock...
the -- The Cooperative has an e-mail account where whistle-blowers can get in touch.
Dan sent a note regarding his troubled lawsuit.
he wanted my help.
your help for what?
he heard a rumor that an executive at Millman Oil kept a black book of names -- all the people he'd paid off.
Dan wanted that book.
an executive -- Jason Kern.
exactly. Mm-hmm.
so, together, Dan and I hatched a plan.
I would organize a protest at the front of the building.
that would distract security, and Dan would be able to break into Kern's office in the back.
we staged it on a Sunday so nobody would be in the office.
okay, what about the alarms, the locks, the cameras?
a joke for someone with my skills.
I hacked the alarm systems, and I gave Dan a list of Jason Kern's possible pass-code combinations, if needed.
most people are very predictable in their choices.
well, something didn't go according to plan.
uh, either Dan was discovered in the act, or he was tracked down afterwards.
all I know for sure is that I never heard from him again.
the tanker would then cost a million bucks.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
excuse me?
your secretary's out to lunch.
hope you don't mind we let ourselves in.
what are you doing here?
why didn't you tell us that Dan Becker broke into your office?
because he didn't.
Oh, yes, he did.
and he searched the place until he found your safe.
safe.
Uh-huh, and he opened it, and he stole your little black book of names.
Jason, what are they talking about?
uh, Mr. Kern here has been bribing residents and city officials to keep them from testifying against your company.
this is ridiculous.
all right, I don't have a black book, and even if I did, how did Becker get into my safe without a combination?
PATRICK: Well, he did.
you obviously had a very simple code -- your birth date?
how d-- Yes.
was anything else taken, aside from the book?
no.
that was a yes.
the book and what else?
nothing was taken, all right?
no black book, no nothing!
all right, look, you know what?
I'm sorry, but you people need to leave.
we just have a few more questions.
then I'm gonna have to bring in our lawyers.
exactly.
Oh, this is interesting. What?
look at the indentation on the carpet.
someone has moved this file-cabinet thing when they were searching for the safe.
how many times do I have to tell you?
there was no break-in!
we're done here.
so, you think Dan took something else.
like what? I don't know.
money, maybe.
kern would need a slush fund.
I mean, he's not paying people off with checks.
I need to make a stop on the way back.
where are we going?
talk to Dan's friends.
fischer: Why?
patience.
Ah, everyone is here.
please, come on in. Take a seat.
thank you.
there's been a very interesting development in the case.
I'm gonna need you all to pay very careful attention.
agent Fischer, if you would.
now, does this song mean something to any of you?
"london Bridge is Falling Down"?
it's a nursery rhyme, isn't it?
anything else?
this is why you brought us here?
thank you for your time.
sorry for the inconvenience.
are you gonna tell me what this is about?
Nope.
I want to talk to Hutten again.
no. Just hear me out.
he's wearing a monitoring device.
I checked in with Miller's unit, and they say that Hutten hasn't left the house in 14 hours.
and...? - That doesn't seem strange at all?
not necessarily.
I also tried to call Hutten.
no answer.
look, maybe it's nothing, but we don't have any other leads.
what do we have to lose?
just so you know, this is a waste of time.
CHO: You sure Hutten's home?
he's here.
he's probably just sleeping.
John, open up!
you got a key? No, just wait.
excuse me.
what the hell are you doing?!
sorry.
he's not upstairs.
I'll call in a BOLO.
this doesn't make any sense.
his monitor says that he's right here.
Yeah.
cause he modified his cellphone to give out the same signal as the ankle monitor.
you leave it on, everybody thinks he's still home.
Yep.
I'm guessing he's gone.
van Pelt: Thanks, Cho. Got it.
I just got off the phone with Hutten's wife.
she's been in San Diego for two days and has no idea where her husband is.
any luck?
Cho just got a hit on the BOLO.
a convenience-store tenant saw Hutten 20 minutes ago.
he left traveling west in a blue Jeep.
okay. I've got the nearest traffic-light camera.
there it is.
he turned left on Hampton.
I'll start pulling more footage.
maybe I can track where he's headed.
all righty.
you got five minutes to help catch a killer?
uh, yes.
Absolutely. Good.
how much can you really learn about someone on the Internet
I mean, intimate details?
you'd be surprised. Mm-hmm.
of course, if you have a court order for phone records and credit-card transactions, you can find a lot more.
do we have a court order?
would I be asking if we didn't?
Abbott: Everything's going according to plan.
agent Collins is at his house, siphoning his gas.
okay, he's headed out now.
all right. It's working.
he pulled into the gas station.
are we all set on your end?
PATRICK: All set. Good to go.
all right.
Hey, man, what's wrong with these radios, huh?
don't know. Just came on.
Hello, Bryce.
Yeah, you. I'm talking to you, Bryce.
Hello?
this is The Cooperative.
did you really think you were gonna get away with it?
what?
what the hell's going on?
Oh, come on. We know you killed Dan Becker.
no, I did not.
I would never hurt Dan.
we know you did it, and now we know why.
you helped Dan break into Jason Kern's office, but you didn't just find the black book, did you?
no, you wouldn't murder Dan for that.
you found Kern's slush fund.
you killed Dan so you could have the money for yourself.
no, I didn't.
don't worry. We're not turning you in.
the Cooperative makes its own justice.
you're not gonna get away with this, Bryce.
what are you gonna do?
well, we know where you hid the money, and we took it.
you couldn't possibly know that.
we know everything, Bryce.
don't believe us?
today for lunch, you ordered a ham and cheese with chips and a drink.
last week, you saw a dermatologist for a reoccurring case of athlete's foot.
two months ago, you were fired after a coworker accused you of sexual harassment.
now do you believe me?
how could you possibly know that?
I told you -- we know everything, and we made sure you wouldn't profit from Dan Becker's death.
goodbye, Bryce.
Hello?
what do you got there, Bryce?
now, we know you helped Dan.
he had a bad back.
he couldn't have moved that file cabinet by himself.
anybody could've helped him.
why me?
Jane could tell you were the only one who knew what "London Bridge is Falling Down" really meant.
you heard The Cooperative playing it during the break-in, didn't you?
Yeah, I helped Dan.
he wanted backup in case something went wrong.
found the safe in Kern's office.
cash was in it, along with the black book.
$100, 000, man...
but Dan didn't want the money?
no.
thought it would make him a thief.
but I didn't. I needed that money.
I deserved that money.
everybody else is getting rich, huh?
why couldn't I have a little?
figured what Dan didn't know wouldn't hurt him.
let's get out of here.
[ people chanting in distance ] Stop fracking now!
stop fracking now!
so, what went wrong?
bad luck, I guess.
Thanks, man.
nice work.
what the hell is this?! Hey, hey, wait a minute, Dan!
let me explain! Let me explain!
we're not keeping the money.
that's not what we were supposed to do. We deserve it, Dan!
they are profiting off of our land!
doesn't make it right.
I'm giving it back.
the hell you are.
Ah, he just wasn't breathing.
and, uh...
I didn't know what to do.
so you dumped the body on Millman Oil property.
I figured if anybody deserved to get in trouble, it was them.
but I never meant to hurt Dan.
Mr. Kern.
it's a very detailed book. Thank you for this.
we have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Oh, this'll be tied up in court for years, and you know it.
we have some very good lawyers.
they won't be working for you.
you're fired.
samuel, we can beat this.
I'm done with your lies, Jason.
get him out of my sight.
samuel, wait.
hold on. Back up.
blue Jeep.
FBI, ma'am.
all right.
Aw, man.
any chance you guys can come back in a half an hour?
he's been hacking the ankle monitor so he can bang his girlfriend without his wife knowing.
the mistress says she visited Hutten last Thursday in San Jose, the same day Ardiles died.
they were in a hotel the whole time.
it checks out. Hutten's not our guy.
so, where are we on Haibach?
lisbon: His surveillance detail should be up.
let me call.
burns: Hello?
agent Burns, hi. This is agent Lisbon in Austin.
anything to report?
no. We got nothing.
haven't seen the guy all night.
all right, well, keep me updated.
we got nothing.
I could use a drink.
I'm in.
we should grab Jane.
count me out.
you sure? Yeah, I'm beat.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
all right, Lisbon. Good night. Okay.
Hey. I fell asleep.
Oh, I'm sorry. I just wanted to check in.
I'm out having a drink with the guys.
what happened with Hutten?
it's not him. I'll explain later.
you go back to bed.
you having fun?
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I'm glad. It's good for you.
thank you.
I love you, babe. You know that, right?
I love you, too.
okay, I'll see you soon.
will you come with me to D. C?
I want to say yes.
it's just...
take your time. There's no deadline.
are you going with him?
to be honest, sir, I don't know.
what does Jane have to say about this?
I'm sure he's fine with it.
I need emergency medical assistance at 812 Ashcroft.
bow and arrow.
what does that mean, "bow and arrow"?
how long were you held captive for?
I couldn't tell.
I never saw the sunlight.
two days, maybe.
and you never saw your captor? - No.
my sister's Amy Welker.
she's 16. You have to find her.
she was abducted with you? - Yes.
her sister was there. There are more girls.
forensics is at the safe house now.
they found DNA from 20 different people on those water bottles.
and thanks to you, we shut down a trafficking ring.
you didn't find my sister?
no, but we're still looking. There was another truck.
your sister may have been on that.
he was just waiting there all the time?
Yeah. He just makes a point to be there for me.
you really like this guy, huh?
he got a promotion in D. C.
and he asked me to go with him so we can be together.
Yeah.
thank you.
you shopping for real estate?
the Bureau is paying for Marcus to relocate to D. C.
I'm helping him find a place.
have you decided?
decided what?
whether or not you're gonna go with him.
no. Not yet.
well, I hope you stay.
you do?
Yeah, I think you'll be bored in D. C.
that's why I should stay, to avoid boredom?
what's worse than boredom?
you are Patrick Jane? Yeah, when it suits me.
I've got a warrant for your arrest. Cuff him.
hold on. What's going on?
the Attorney General has found your coworker in contempt of court for ignoring a federal subpoena.
Teresa Lisbon? - Yeah, that's me.
you've been subpoenaed to appear before - a federal grand jury in Dallas. - What's happening here?
well, hold on a minute. Are you Kim Fischer?
Yes. You've been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury, as well.
let's go.
uh, probably best not to ignore those.
two years ago, an arrest warrant was issued for Patrick Jane in connection to the murder of Thomas McAllister, the serial killer known as Red John.
is it true you were part of an international FBI manhunt to bring Patrick Jane to justice?
that's accurate.
and yet now you work for a unit of the FBI that employs him.
I am a part of that unit, yes.
the FBI conducts a two-year manhunt, finds its suspect, and brings him back, but instead of a trial by his peers, he is given a government job with benefits.
Why?
we made a deal with him.
what were the terms of that deal? I don't know.
he was already a part of the team when I was hired.
Mr. Jane is required to assist us in cases in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
you worked very closely with Mr. Jane in California.
does he confide in you? You close?
you could say that.
did he tell you he killed Thomas McAllister?
not specifically, no.
did he tell you he killed Thomas McAllister?
I plead the fifth.
did he tell you where he was on the day McAllister was murdered?
I plead the fifth.
agent Lisbon, are you besmirching your badge and refusing to answer to protect yourself or to protect Patrick Jane?
go to hell.
this is where we found Daniela, the second trafficking victim.
they separated her from the rest of the group. Any idea why yet?
no. The others were being held inside the house.
it isn't much better.
now, the girls were abducted from across the western United States and transported here by truck.
we believe the traffickers used this house as a way station of sorts.
it's hard to believe 30 women were crammed in here.
took two days to process
a lot of hair and fibers floating around.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Hey. Can we get some light in here?
we're still looking for the second truck full of victims, but I think it's south of the border by now.
what about the truckload that we did find?
those girls provide any useful information?
all they could tell us about was Jesse, the dead man who lured them with the modeling scam.
ringleaders remain a mystery. Okay.
well, what about the girl that died?
she was trying to tell Jane something about a bow and arrow.
we don't know what that means yet.
I'm hoping for more answers once we analyze all the evidence.
okay.
well, you finish up here, and I'll see you back at headquarters.
all right.
we need to talk.
in my office. What's going on?
lisbon and I just got back from the grand jury hearing in Dallas.
they're trying to indict Jane for murder.
they asked us point-blank whether or not Jane had ever confessed to killing him.
and what did you say to them?
what are you doing here?
uh, I'm out on "bail."
W-what does "bail" mean?
it was a con.
uh, technically the term is "sting."
operation Juryscam.
you're kidding, right?
I am very sorry for the deception, but to maintain authenticity, we couldn't inform you until after you sat with the jury.
our target for the sting is this man...
he's a young mob boss.
he owns the illegal sports-betting market in Dallas.
you guys didn't answer my question.
did anyone narc on me?
how does indicting Jane nail Acardo?
this... is Elijah Macy.
he created a sports-betting website that was cutting into Acardo's profits.
now, we think that Acardo had him killed five weeks ago.
what's the evidence?
well, it's circumstantial but more than enough to indict.
and then, surprise, surprise, the grand jury voted not to prosecute last week.
you think Acardo got to them.
all they'd have to do is sway two or three jurors.
and that's what the Attorney General thinks happened.
now he's asking for our help.
fortunately, the same jurors are impaneled for another month.
and, under the pretense of a murder investigation,
I will face them and determine which ones were bribed.
or intimidated.
I-I can't believe you got a prosecutor to take part in the con.
it's not a con. It's a sting.
sting.
the prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.
the Attorney General does.
this is the last of it.
Thanks.
is everyone out?
locking up now.
how'd you get in here?
the window.
they released you from the hospital?
I released myself.
this is an active crime scene.
I'm looking for my sister.
we're doing everything we can to find Amy.
but you haven't found her, have you?
Daniela, why'd you come back here?
you told us you didn't know if Amy was even at this house.
I didn't...
but I do now.
this is her tag.
she left it everywhere.
she was here.
Hey. Look at me.
we're gonna find her.
it is none of your business what I told the jury.
I did what I had to do.
what about you, Lisbon? You snitch on me, huh?
be honest.
you want to know what I said, read the transcripts.
Hey. What did I do?
you should have told me this whole courtroom charade was a charade.
since when am I a target of one of your cons?
it wasn't a con.
I don't care. You should have told me.
I thought that you...
you know what? Forget about it.
operation Juryscam, it was Abbott's idea.
he ordered me not to tell anyone.
Oh, you picked a great time to start following orders.
well, I-I have to do
am I interrupting? No, it's perfect timing.
I am more than ready for lunch.
I heard about your grand jury. I'm pulling for you.
I think you did what any good father and husband would do.
Yes, Jane has all of our sympathies.
let's go.
how long are you gonna let that go?
what?
well, you know he's gonna take her to Washington, right?
listen, she'll do what she wants to do.
you know, I've collared lots of con men over the years, best in the business.
you know what led to their downfall ultimately?
Yeah. They start believing their own con.
that's not gonna happen. There is no con here.
no?
no.
all right, then.
Mr. Jane, you understand you're under a waiver of immunity.
Yes, ma'am. What does that mean to you?
uh, it means that anything I say may be held against me.
very good.
in a moment, I'll open the floor up to you so you can provide a narrative of events to explain what you were doing and where you were on the date and time of Thomas McAllister's murder.
objection. You said "murder."
thomas McAllister may have shot and strangled himself.
there are no objections here, Mr. Jane, no judge, just a friendly inquiry.
but I take your point.
do you recall the day of McAllister's death?
I do -- big day.
I had been chasing the man for eight years.
any of you know what it's like to be driven by a moral imperative?
you do.
and you.
and you do.
you all have strong jaw muscles.
it's a sign of strength and character.
you -- I'm not so sure.
your eyes are a tad close to each other.
excuse me. What are you doing?
I'm establishing a narrative of events, as you asked.
so stick to the narrative.
narrative -- yes, I do love a story.
as do you.
you read a great deal of fiction, don't you?
romantic novels. That's right.
Yes, an illicit engagement wouldn't scare you, would it?
where are you going with this?
I'm trying to tell my story, if you'll just let me.
you haven't even started it.
well, they seem engaged.
all of them except this gentlemen here, who's preoccupied by his new jacket.
that's a little vain and childish, don't you think?
this is serious business. Pay attention.
I'm sorry. I was just trying to
sir, you will not indulge him.
well, he's happy to indulge himself.
t-that should definitely be on the record.
Mr. Jane, this is not a forum for you to chat with the jurors.
well, it should be.\ - Mr. Jane.
they just seem like good, honest, friendly people, all of them except that gentleman on the end there.
you know, you really should mend things with your son.
all this anger, this bitterness, this resentment that you're bottling, it's ruining both your lives.
stop now.
you do not dictate the agenda here.
who does?
I do.
this is my courtroom, and it runs the way I say.
is that clear?
it is now. Thank you.
socialized narcissist.
there is no one in that courtroom keeping her in check.
John Acardo didn't pay off jurors to avoid prosecution.
he just paid off the prosecutor.
well, theoretically, a prosecutor could throw an investigation, especially one with circumstantial evidence.
I'll obtain the transcript.
Mm...Faulk's too smart to exclude evidence.
it would be in the way she presented the case.
halfheartedly, lacking confidence.
jury would see defeat in her eyes and vote accordingly.
so, what do you propose?
a new strategy.
we need to prove that John Acardo is guilty of murder ourselves.
Jane believes that Acardo didn't get to the jury.
he got to Faulk, the prosecutor.
so now we have two targets.
that's right.
and to take them down, we're gonna have to find proof that Acardo was behind the Elijah Macy shooting.
what evidence do we have?
earlier this year, one of Acardo's men was arrested, turned state's evidence for immunity from a drug charge.
he also testified that his boss order the hit on Macy.
multiple witnesses heard Acardo threaten to have Macy killed if he didn't shut down his sports-betting website.
but we don't have any physical evidence.
not yet.
but that's what we're gonna have to find.
well, according to the transcript,
Acardo claims he was at a place called il Tavolo Bianco the night of the murder.
that's his favorite restaurant, obviously his alibi.
Yeah, but he drones on and on about it after it was already in the record.
he keeps talking about the restaurant because he's hiding evidence of his guilt.
you sound Jane.
well, you spend enough time with someone.
Lisbon, why don't you check out this il Tavolo Bianco?
and take Jane with you.
you two have a nice dinner on the FBI.
Yeah, sure.
Hey. How are you?
all they've got me doing is staring at photos of sex traffickers.
I need a shower.
here you go.
you're right-handed. - Uh, yes.
so, that heart on your hand, y-you didn't draw that?
uh, no. They did.
Yeah, we don't know what that means.
none of the other girls we rescued had that mark.
guess I'm special.
excuse me.
I was looking over your interview with agent Lisbon.
you mentioned blood tests.
when Amy and I went to our first modeling gig, the nurse took our blood.
they said we couldn't enter Europe without a blood test.
they lied.
I'm thinking that mark has something to do with your blood test.
like how? We'll find out.
you keep saying that, but nothing happens.
just keep looking over those photos, okay?
it's not your fault.
it's all my fault.
I talked Amy into this.
Hey, boss.
any breaks in the case?
maybe.
they took a sample of blood from all the trafficking victims, including Daniela.
well, that's hardly standard procedure for traffickers.
why do you think they needed the blood?
I don't know yet, but I just went through all the evidence from the house.
I found these inside a first aid kit
blood-test equipment.
according to the Q. R. codes, they were supplied by a Dallas company, Rutherford Medical Supply.
well, their purchase records can help find our traffickers.
good work.
Hey, Cho.
I know you're working with Daniela on this, but try not to get her hopes up.
the longer this stretches on, the less likely we'll be able to find her sister.
it's nice.
a little dark.
I am Aurelio.
may I hang your coat?
Yes. Thank you.
this way, please.
I have just the table for your...Special evening.
Oh, it's just dinner.
nonsense.
every night with this one is, uh, an occasion, yes?
can't deny that.
good. Settle in. I'll be right back.
I owe you an apology about the grand jury thing. I overreacted.
you're just doing what Abbott told you to.
did Marcus help you decide that?
as a matter of fact.
right. Well, Marcus is wrong.
I should have told you, and you were right to be cross with me.
I pled the fifth, by the way, in the grand jury room.
figured as much.
you always know what I'm gonna do, huh?
mostly.
one of these days, I might surprise you.
please don't. I love that you're predictable.
just what a girl wants to hear.
what does a girl want to hear?
I wish I knew.
your wine menu.
thank you.
if I may, we just imported a beautiful Brunello di Montalcino.
well, uh, what do the mobsters drink?
Yeah, the -- the guidebook said that real-life mobsters used to favor eating here.
Yes.
my father once served Joseph Civello, Joseph Campisi, all the old Dallas mob families.
they came here for a taste of the old country.
they used to say, "the veal is good, but the goodfellas -- phew -- they're bad."
what about now?
well, fortunately, there are no active crime families left in Dallas.
well, isn't there that guy? What's his name?
the up-and-coming guy, John, uh, Acardo.
he's, uh -- does he ever eat here?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I'll bring your server.
thank you.
it's Italian. You're good.
what do you think?
I think I'd like to take a look at the evidence from the original case.
and then I was thinking about The Brunello di Montalcino.
that did sound good.
130 bucks a bottle.
Abbott's paying.
bingo. - Let's get it.
this is all the physical evidence from the Elijah Macy murder scene.
I sorted it by order of relevance with this end of the table being most relevant.
what do you consider relevant?
any object that can yield trace evidence of the shooter.
if we I. D. the triggerman, we can cut a deal with him to finger Acardo.
Yeah, uh, trace evidence, that's the fibers and the hairs and the gooey stuff, yeah?
that's an oversimplification, but, yes.
in the last year alone, there are 17 new methods for extracting DNA evidence from
Yeah, we know that there's a lot of ways to find out what we need, right, Wylie?
hmm? Yeah.
so, uh, there's the federal way, with the trace evidence, and then there's a more interesting way.
let's go with the more interesting way.
tell me, hmm?
if I were to ask you what is the most random item on this table, what would you say?
this. An overcoat.
it was found 200 feet from the crime scene.
there were no trace elements found on it.
the detectives weren't even sure it was connected to the crime scene.
what was the weather like the day of the murder?
pretty warm, if I'm not mistaken.
holes.
interesting. You see that, Wylie?
okay, so, if this didn't belong to the victim, you have just solved the case.
I did?
well done.
find out if it belonged to the victim or not.
okay?
Mrs. Macy? Yes?
special agent Fischer, FBI.
I apologize for the intrusion.
I need your help.
it's about your son.
um... Come on in.
thank you.
when you raise a son alone, you don't stop and think about, well, anything, really.
you're just trying to keep up.
it wasn't until Elijah was, uh，taken away that I realized how woven he was into the fabric of my entire life.
tell me about him.
Elijah was such an inquisitive child, loved building things, taught himself to code when he was 12.
I understand he started his Internet company while he was still in college.
that's right -- junior year.
he was plan II up at U. T.and I thought,"oh, no. He's just never gonna have the time."
but he was so excited to launch that website.
in six months, paid off my house with the profits.
graduated with honors, too.
special kid.
Yeah.
if you'll allow me just one more question.
was this Elijah's coat?
huh.
according to his mother, Elijah was allergic to wool, and that coat is 100% wool, so it didn't belong to the victim.
I was hoping you would say that.
well, I know how John Acardo ordered the hit, and, more importantly, I know how to prove it.
how?
it's easy.
I just need to make Acardo put a hit out on me.
Acardo, 11: 00.
you really think you can get him to take out a hit on you in one night?
usually, only people who know you want to kill you.
it's just a matter of figuring out which buttons to push.
a man like Acardo, you know, he, uh, has a fierce need for control, fancies himself the lord of all he surveys.
Elijah Macy cuts into his profits, he responds by eliminating the competition.
a grand jury tries to indict him, he buys the outcome.
all I need to do is to take something that belongs to him.
like what?
what about her?
good luck with that. I'll be at the bar.
Oh! Oh, God.
I am so sorry.
please excuse me.
no problem.
no problem.
it's your arms. They're so sparkly.
Oh, my God. You noticed my glitter lotion? - Yeah.
Oh, look. It's on me, too.
at least somebody did.
wait, check it out in the light.
that is fantastic. Yeah, it's so shiny.
Oh, no. What is it? What's wrong?
what is it?
Um...M-m-my -- my bracelet.
what does it look like? Let me help you find it.
let me find it.
I-it's a diamond tennis bracelet.
Yes.
thank you! Thank you! No, that's fine.
thank you. Here, look.
I mean, no offense, but I can't say much for his taste.
I would put nothing more than Cartier on your wrist, around your neck...
or dangling from here.
you're so sweet.
I'm Patrick.
okay.
what kind of scotch you got?
Oh, look.
"Casablanca" is on. Here's looking at you, kid.
you know Bogart made that line up? It wasn't in the script.
I've never seen "Casablanca."
what? Are you serious?
I'm not really into old movies.
this is not an old movie. This is a classic. You've got to watch this.
you're gonna love it.
okay, let's watch it.
is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
well, Teresa...
I may not be able to read minds like Jane, but even I can tell when something's going on.
Jane can't read minds. It's hard to explain.
you know, it doesn't matter.
do you want to talk about it?
not really, no.
I just wanted to say that I know moving to D. C. is a big thing, and it might raise issues you don't feel totally comfortable talking to me about.
but I just want you to know it's okay.
I mean, you go through whatever process you need to.
just...let me know when you make a decision.
I'll be here.
thank you.
let's watch "Casablanca," huh?
what is it about, anyway?
well, various things, but basically it's a love story about a woman who has to choose between two men.
there's also a baseball game on.
that sounds better.
Yeah, let's do that.
Hey, boss, check this guy out.
dance card's full for the night, friend.
this can go one of two ways.
you can take your hands off her body, or I can cut them off.
let me tell you something, pal.
you are marrying a wonderful dancer.
I-it's okay, baby. Nothing to worry about.
look. He found my bracelet.
found the bracelet. - Oh, did he?
Uh-huh What did you say your name was?
uh, this is Patrick. - Jane. Patrick Jane.
well, Patrick, I think it's time for you to say good night.
on your way.
Oh, no, not yet.
this -- this may be my last night of freedom.
I'm being indicted for murder, and I was hoping to go out big, you know?
finest champagne, finest woman.
Brandy's spending the night with me. I hope you don't mind.
Oh, he's just joking, Johnny.
Oh, no, I'm not.
and I'm gonna take you places that you've never been.
and when you get back, you can tell Johnny all about it.
that'll be my wedding gift to the two of you.
I think our friend Patrick here has had a little too much to drink.
why don't you escort him out?
excuse me!
can I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen?
that man, John Acardo, is a drug dealer and killer.
I want you all to remember his face and the faces of his men here so that you can describe them later to the police.
they're gonna physically assault me -- or worse
the moment I walk out that door.
thank you and good night.
arrange a dinner tomorrow night. il Tavolo Bianco.
my usual table.
careful.
get over here.
the question isn't what medical equipment do we supply.
it's what don't we supply.
gelatin capsules, glass vials, hospital beds, and everything in between.
put that in the corner, Bob. - Okay.
what about blood-test strips?
did these come from Rutherford Medical?
uh, yeah, these are from our home-typing kits.
do you also handle the results?
no, the particular strip is from a home kit, so there's no need to send in for a lab report.
bow and arrow.
agent Cho. - Yeah.
it's a bow and arrow.
the first trafficking victim that Jane found, didn't she say something about a bow and arrow?
just before she died.
that's a blood-type kit from our Arquero line.
that's one of our best sellers.
we're gonna need a printout of everyone who ordered one of these kits. That's a long list.
we sell those to half of the hospitals and clinics in the state.
we'll wait.
whatever.
and how is my Bella Donna tonight?
aurelio, you always make be blush.
your, uh, usual table is waiting.
excellent.
may I hang your coat?
of course.
and, uh, take Nico's coat, too, would you?
of course.
Marie, show Mr. Acardo to his table, eh?
take good care of Mr. Acardo, eh?
Johnny, how do you think I'd look in a Cartier necklace?
uh, no need, Alfons.
um, I think I'll have a New York strip tonight
rare.
and, uh, salad? Is that good?
a salad for her.
Mm. Yeah.
thank you, Alfons.
it's me.
I've got it.
drop it on the ground.
now come here.
you know what to do.
drop the weapon.
drop it now.
don't shoot!
I am unarmed.
okay. Be calm.
God.
Fischer. Can you breathe?
I'm okay.
check the shooter.
I heard shooting. Everyone all right?
Oh, yeah.
he's dead.
Ah. This is how Acardo orders his hits.
he sends a message through Aurelio to distance himself from the gunman.
they made me.
t-they made me do this.
calm down! Put your hands on your head.
and then Acardo puts the target's name in the pocket of the jacket.
that's me.
excuse me.
I think this, uh, belongs to you.
sit down and put your hands on the table.
and this.
and this.
Oh, my God! He's choking!
he's choking!
Oh, my God! He's choking!
do something! Do something!
here we go. Ready?
one, two, three.
there we go, huh?
all better and off to prison.
let's go. Come on. Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank you.
choking?
no, I'm good.
Hey, Jane.
did you hear the news?
your grand jury investigation ended.
and they voted to indict you for murder.
well, is it any wonder?
well, the A. G. is making it go away, but, you know, it's a good thing that you're under our protection.
hm. That's a fact that you'll never let me forget.
how was your dinner with Lisbon?
Oh, my chicken was so-so, but Lisbon's fish was excellent.
why do you ask? Just wondering.
agent Fischer.
we didn't recall you to testify.
I'll let you know if we need you to come back in.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
the case against Jane was a setup.
what are you talking about?
a sting to net a corrupt prosecutor.
you're under arrest for grand jury tampering and bribery.
bailiff, take these people out.
arrest warrant.
back off.
we have Acardo's phone.
the two of you had a lot to say to each other the night he received his subpoena to appear before the grand jury.
and then there's the large deposit into your offshore account two days later.
cuff her.
okay, well... We have good news for you.
the Attorney General agreed not to prosecute if you testify against Acardo.
Acardo came to me and said he'd make my wife a widow if I didn't do what he ordered, eh?
you will be moved to protective custody, of course.
and what about il Tavolo Bianco, eh?
I testify for you.
but I won't leave my home or my restaurant.
if Acardo wants revenge, I'll stay out in the open, where they can find me.
otherwise, they hurt my family to find me.
okay.
well, you will have to remain in protective custody until the trial.
I understand.
I'll send an agent in to walk you through that.
good luck.
you made a tough choice, Mr. Aurelio.
brave man.
that's very admirable.
agent Cho.
what am I looking at?
Ooh, uh, I cross-referenced a list of facilities that purchased the Arquero kits with their location and last date of purchase.
what am I looking at?
Oh, well, I-if
if you'll notice the highlighted line, 20 kits were delivered to Wheatondale Medical Center last month.
okay?
Wheatondale isn't in operation. It was condemned two years ago.
let's try the other door.
let's break it.
you hear that?
that humming sound? Sounds like a generator.
it's coming from in there.
someone's been using this place.
Yeah, but for what?
the hum is coming from in there.
what? What is it?
the body's been cut open.
looks like they took the heart.
they're killing these girls for their organs.
lisbon in?
Yeah.
Teresa. It's, uh -- it's Jane.
w-what's up?
cannoli -- il Tavolo Bianco.
Mrs. Aurelio made them specially.
that's sweet. Yeah.
there's -- there's enough there for Marcus, too.
you didn't come here this late to drop off cannoli.
look, I-I've been thinking a-about you leaving.
and...
I want you to know that I-I really want you to be happy.
and that is the most important thing to me that you do what makes you happy.
okay?
Yeah.
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
northern Napa County CA
boy, am I glad to see you guys.
we are sorely ill-prepared for this kind of deal.
quail hunter's dog found her this morning at 5: 30.
wasn't meant to be huntin' quail, but he was.
do we know who she is?
Nope. Looks familiar, though, so I'm guessing local.
people sure look different when they're dead, though, don't they?
that wound doesn't look fatal.
there's no ligature marks on the neck, so she wasn't strangled or hung.
gums are livid.
eyes are hemorrhaged.
suffocation.
my bet is it's a meth head from the city comin' in off the interstate.
no, he's a local.
and it was an accident.
her killer didn't intend her to die this way.
how so?
she still has her clothes on.
her abductor was taking her to a location that was quiet and private，so he could undress her for a sexual assault.
she made too much noise at the wrong moment.
he tried to keep her quiet and smothered her by mistake.
no good to him now, so then he dumps her in a spot only a local would know.
she's all yours. Thanks for waiting.
why sexual motive? Could be gangs or drugs.
a drug trade smothering?
by who--"sesame street" crips?
there's nothing to say it isn't just boyfriend trouble.
could be boyfriend trouble.
doesn't feel like it, though.
who is this guy?
he's a consultant.
you want CBI assistance?
he comes as part of the package.
consultant, huh?
what, are you clairvoyant or some gizmo? You got psychic powers?
no, no powers. Had 'em once.
I mean, I pretended I had 'em, obviously.
no such thing as psychic powers.
so what is it you do, exactly?
you know rock paper scissors?
I do.
play me. On three.
one... Two... Three.
one, two, three.
one, two, three.
one, two, three.
one, two, three.
one, two, three!
go inside the house. Go do your homework.
get your homework started. Go. Go now.
Mr. And mrs. O'keefe?
I'm agent Teresa Lisbon, California Bureau of Investigation.
I'm sorry. We're bringing bad news.
we found your daughter Melanie. - No.
Oh, no!
who are you?
my name's Patrick Jane. I'm with the police.
is this your sister's room?
Yes.
did someone kill my sister?
Yes.
okay.
she didn't come home from work the night before last.
she waitresses at the shand creek winery restaurant.
she was on until 11: 00.
her car is still parked there in the parking lot.
we're always asleep when she comes home.
we didn't even know she was missing until the morning.
we called all her friends, and nobody knew where she was.
nobody'd seen her after she left work that night.
she was all set to go ppto college in the fall.
she won a softball scholarship at, um, U. C. L. A.
we were worried about her going down to Los Angeles, because you read about all the crime.
did they do anything to her?
doesn't appear so.
she was fully clothed.
why would anybody do something like that?
oftentimes, the first name that pops into the mother's head is the guilty party.
jealous boyfriends, anything like that?
no, nothing like that.
nothing?
she was always shy of boys.
she was a good girl.
she took the purity pledge in ninth grade, and she still wears that ring today.
when did she take the posters down?
after Christmas.
who was on the posters?
boys with long hair from the tv.
she didn't like 'em anymore?
said they were for little girls.
do you know who killed her?
no.
are you gonna find out who killed her?
me and my colleagues are gonna try.
how?
looking, listening, asking questions.
when you find him, will you tell me?
sure. Why?
no reason.
CBI HQ Sacramento
Hey, did you get the fax from the sheriff's department there?
Yes.
run the details through the crime database, see if we get any matches.
okay, Van Pelt? - Will do.
boss, I finished the budget reports here like you said.
why don't I drive down there, give you guys a hand?
no, you stay there.
look, I'll call you if I need you.
she has a lover--someone she met around christmas at a fair.
he's either too old, too closely related or too villainous to tell her folks about.
I'd bet on villainy, and his first name starts with an "h."
explains why she wasn't wearing a purity ring.
you know, it is the damnedest thing.
I was at the shand creek that night on a call 'round about the same time that girl was taken.
a drunk wouldn't pay his check.
that is the damnedest thing.
you notice anything that might be useful?
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Yeah, when I got there, I saw a black truck, full-size, taking off out of the other end of that lot goin' way too fast...
he's inside.
nearly went after him, too, you know?
what time was that?
uh, a quarter to 12: 00.
have these woods been checked?
not to speak of.
you might want to put a few man-hours into that.
that, uh, that's her car right there.
you want to take it?
she worked for us for three summers in a row.
lovely girl.
this is good.
Yes, it is.
it's unbelievable. And from the parking lot. I was practically right there.
I can't even think about it.
try this.
no, I won't. - This one's really good.
to your knowledge, did Melanie ever have any incidents with disgruntled coworkers, maybe boyfriend problems? - No.
Mmm, this one is really good. Cardamom?
Yes, and caraway.
Mmm, and a lot of butter.
no, there's no shame in it. A lot of butter.
that's the great thing about food.
it's indulgence and necessity all in one.
what time did Melanie leave work that night?
to build a time line, we need to know exactly.
well, I know she took off first, but I'd have to check her time card to be exact.
Hey, it wasn't me, by the way.
I have a staff of 20 that'll tell you the only time I ever leave the kitchen is to take a leak or yell at a customer.
sad but true.
so this is the, uh, the kitchen.
this is the main prep area, and this is where the magic happens.
attention, Randall! Pay it!
my office is this way.
this is a go.
she was by no means a gifted server.
Betty butterfingers, that's what we called her, but she had a good spirit.
she left at 11: 25.
good night.
she went out that door, and that's the last we saw of her.
it's all reservations, I assume?
credit cards? - Yes. I can get you a full list.
great.
Oh, Raquel, come in.
these people are here to help find out what happened to poor Melanie.
okay. Good.
you and she were good friends, weren't you?
not really. She was okay.
cause on her wall at home, she has a picture of you and her together.
that's weird, huh?
I don't know why she has a picture of me and her, ma'am.
maybe she has a secret crush on me.
I don't know.
what's her boyfriend's name?
she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's her thing, right?
purity. No boys.
so who was it that she cut out of the picture?
I don't know, sir.
you were there.
it was Christmas. I was high.
Raquel, this is a murder investigation.
if you protect someone who did this, you'll do time.
I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't help you.
I would if I could. Swear to god.
thank you.
car's clean.
have a chat with Raquel, why don't you?
I'm gonna go check the credit card receipts. - Okay.
give me a minute with her. She's got a super low threshold.
no. Nope.
just stand in the doorway, pretend you're making a phone call for a moment.
no. It's illegal and it's unprofessional.
that's why I need you to stand in the doorway.
one minute.
Raquel, look at me.
before you fall asleep tonight, while you're lying in your bed relaxing and slowly drifting off into sleep, I want you to think of me.
think of me and imagine that you can fly.
imagine that you're weightless.
you can float gently into the air if you want to, safe and calm and serene.
you can fly away and leave all your burdens and worries and fears behind you.
imagine that-- what a nice feeling it is.
next time you see me, when I say hello, you'll remember that good feeling, and you'll want to tell me the truth, because when you do tell the truth, you'll feel that a heavy weight has been lifted from your shoulders
I'll say hello, and you will feel as light as a feather, as if you were floating on air.
why don't you sit here a moment, think about that before you go back to work?
whatever.
your friend's crazy. Can I go now?
Yes.
worked on the chicken.
right.
maybe that's a clue.
sorry?
take it to the lab. - Whoa, whoa, wait. I-I got a better idea.
um, settle down now, everyone. Settle down.
these are agents of the California Bureau of Investigation.
they want to talk to you a moment.
there's nothing to worry about.
we need your help.
will you help us? - Yes.
we know the identity of Melanie's killer.
the murderer of that poor girl is in this room.
this note was found in Melanie's locker.
we have strong reason to believe that whoever wrote this note is the killer.
Yes, unluckily for that person, my colleague, agent Cho here, is the bureau's chief graphologist.
each one of you will be giving us a sample of your handwriting, left and right-handed.
Cho will examine these samples and determine which of you left this note.
which of you is the killer?
back it up. Don't crowd him.
voil .
let him breathe.
Napa County Sheriff's Dept. Randall, why did you want to say "sorry" to Melanie?
I didn't kill her.
I didn't say that you did.
I asked why you wanted to say "sorry" to her.
your time card and your boss say you left work ten minutes before Melanie.
you waited for her in the parking lot, right? Right?
there's no law against waiting for someone. You waited for her.
I just wanted to speak to her.
nothing wrong with that.
you wanted to speak to her. Then what happened?
I was like, "hey, melanie, what's up?
and we talked. She didn't leave.
she--she was smiling and laughing, so I figured I was doing pretty good.
so I made my move, and, um, she wasn't so into it, which was cool,only I know she has this whole virgin thing happening.
so I figured that I just have to be more goal-oriented.
she was pretty upset, - so I apologized for any misunderstanding, - Bitch!
and I left.
I got in my car, and I drove off, and that was it.
only I felt like maybe she would still be mad at me and, like, complain.
so when I got in to work this morning, before I knew that she was missing, I wrote "sorry," and I put it in her locker.
how long were you in the parking lot with her?
try and be precise.
five minutes. Six.
Randall tried to kiss Melanie because he thought it was on his account that she didn't leave.
but in fact, she didn't leave because of Randall. - She was meeting somebody else.
are we gonna see Raquel again?
she's on her way in now.
I did the database search. I'm e-mailing the results.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.
it's not much.
one pop for the brand of silver tape used two months ago in fairfield--an abduction case.
what happened?
Delores Sanchez, a female, 22, migrant farm laborer abducted at a bus stop.
she doesn't know how.
she wakes up on a bed in a motel room all tied up in duct tape, unharmed.
the cleaners found her. Never saw her abductors. No suspects.
Fairfield P. D. concluded it was a drunken prank.
the complainant Sanchez left town, so the case kind of drifted away.
this is very interesting.
let's knock off on tangents already.
any other correlations?
uh, yes, actually. Sanchez is a redhead like O'keefe.
cool down.
it's a common brand of tape, and there's a quarter million redheaded women in California.
Yeah, yeah, you're right. - Yeah.
just supposing, for fun, that it was the same guy did both crimes.
he kidnaps a redheaded girl, ties her up, takes her to a motel room,
has her at his mercy but does nothing.
months later, kidnaps another redheaded girl, but his planning is not good enough, and he kills her in a panic to keep her quiet.
what does that say?
he's an idiot?
he's new to this, and he's conflicted.
he's hungry to do terrible things, but his conscience and his fear tell him not to.
so he's not yet going into this with the proper focus and planning, and stuff goes wrong.
or you're making that up, and Melanie was murdered by her secret lover.
we can be fairly certain she was meeting at the exact time of her abduction.
excuse me. I'm still here. What would you like me to do?
call all the motels within 10 miles of shand creek.
find one that had a cash booking who didn't show on the night of the murder.
no, let's work the solid leads first.
cross-check all the full-size black trucks with known criminals in the napa area.
Yes, ma'am.
look, if the boyfriend angle doesn't work, we'll look at your trainee psychopath, - okay? - Okay.
I don't know anything, so I can't tell anything!
I told them that.
I told you I don't know anything.
has a seat, Miss garcia.
Thanks.
Hello, Raquel.
Melanie had a thing with Hector Romerez.
he's my second cousin.
I was with him at the fair one time, and we ran into Melanie, and then they were like bam.
Romeo and juliet.
she was meeting him that night.
the night she died.
Yes.
and I didn't tell you because I'm afraid of him.
the eight ball locos?
he runs all the drugs in Vacaville.
and he's had people killed for way less than just snitchin' on him like this, for real.
that was funny, the way she gave him up so easily like that.
Yeah, it was.
but you were right, huh? Secret lover.
guess I was wrong about the whole red hair and duct tape thing.
you hypnotized her, didn't you?
I certainly did not.
okay. No.
Yes, I did hypnotize her, but...
but nothing. It's unprofessional, and it's illegal.
it's totally out-of-bounds. - That's what I told him.
I was gonna say you had nothing to do with it, but hey...
you allow him to pull that stuff again, and you'll be showing visitors around the statehouse in a stupid hat.
Yes, ma'am. Understood.
Rigsby, I got a hot warrant in Vacaville.
you can get there in an hour, can't ya?
Yes, boss. I'll get rolling.
bring Van Pelt. - Yes, bo--for a hot warrant?
why are you still on the line?
Hey, come on. Let's go.
well, they do have six flavors, sweetie.
sheriff's department! We have a warrant! Open up!
don't move!
he's out! He's out!
put your right hand behind your back.
stop resisting. Give me your hand! - Don't move! Don't move!
boom. Out of nowhere. Guy didn't know what hit him.
so what were you planning to do if Lisbon hadn't stopped him?
Oh, I-I didn't bother to formulate a plan.
I-I knew she'd stop him.
Cho, Jane, let's move.
you two fill out the paperwork with the staties, then go back to sacramento, hold the fort.
Yes, boss.
Hector, we're investigating the murder of Melanie O'keefe.
do you know who she was?
she was suffocated and then stabbed to death and dumped on the side of the road three nights ago.
we know you and Melanie were lovers.
we know you were planning to meet her that night, and we can put your truck in the shand creek parking lot.
I've got enough to charge you with, Hector.
w-we just want to know your side of the story.
how'd you two meet?
oprah and dr. Phil here.
I told her this is how it was going to end, only it was going to be me that died and her sitting here with dumb cops asking dumb questions.
why was she?
you wouldn't understand.
sure she would.
all women understand the charm of a violent man.
what we had was special.
you made her feel like a captured princess instead of a small town choir nerd.
and she made you feel like a dashing pirate instead of what you are, sort of a bad-tempered pharmacist.
funny man.
ese, those pirates back then, they were just bangin' like anybody else today.
a pirate is exactly what I am, and she was a princess.
she was.
what happened that night?
we were supposed to meet at 11: 30 at the restaurant.
I got there ten minutes late, and she hadn't come out yet.
I waited for a few minutes, and I left.
I'm impatient. I was angry.
I will always hate myself for that.
I left her to be killed because I don't wait for nobody.
that's a noble admission, Hector.
how did you feel about the fact she was going to college in the fall?
I was proud...
and happy for her.
she was leaving you behind.
I wanted her to leave me behind.
I wanted her far away.
I told her, "go to l. A. and don't come back for nothing.
he's telling the truth.
and now you're just trying to be contrary. Have you read his sheet?
did you hear what he said?
he's a good actor.
it was you who thought it was him in the first place.
I said Melanie had a secret lover.
I didn't say he killed her.
if it wasn't him, then who was it?
and if you say a man who likes red hair and silver duct tape, I'll scream.
I don't want you to scream.
look, you have your reasons. I understand.
but you're seeing more than what's actually there.
you have a tendency to do that.
not every murder is a secret inside of a secret inside of a secret.
there's not always a hidden pattern.
not always, but sometimes there is.
sometimes the obvious guy did it.
most of the time, the obvious guy did it.
look at the time line.
Hector's admitted he was in the parking lot for ten minutes, give or take.
there wasn't enough time for anybody else to have entered the parking lot, abducted Melanie and driven away.
it was hector.
you're right. There's no time.
Hey, Frankie.
so, uh, show me.
show you what?
your gun.
I don't have a gun.
no?
Hello?
Hey, Van Pelt.
uh, Lisbon changed her mind.
she wants you to check out those motels like I said.
the motels?
looking for one with a no-show cash booking that night.
cover all the bases, she says.
she's right here if you want a word with her.
uh, that's okay, but listen, I...
call me first if you get anything.
no gun, huh?
what were you gonna kill Hector with, a knife?
that should work. Just, uh...
put it away.
what if it turns out that Hector isn't the man who killed your sister?
isn't he?
we don't know that yet.
but you don't have to worry about that. That's for us to work out.
you need to be here for your family and leave the vengeance part to us.
when you find who did it for sure, will you kill him?
no. I won't kill him, but I'll make him very sorry.
I have a daughter who'd be about your age if i hadn't caused her death, her and her mother.
how?
out of arrogance... Stupidity.
I made an evil man very angry, and he killed them to teach me a lesson, to make me sorry for what I'd done.
and I am sorry.
being sorry is a far worse punishment than being dead. Everybody dies.
very few people ever feel truly sorry for the bad things they've done.
it hurts.
van Pelt, what do you got?
microwave, spa tub and premium cable in every unit.
special rates for state and federal employees.
what did he look like-- this man?
big, with a hat and sunglasses...
and a thick beard, like a sikh.
an absurd disguise, in other words?
ridiculous.
I run a motel. I don't care who you are.
he bought a good beard for nothing.
then that night he doesn't show, so I remembered him when your nice young lady called.
uh, no disrespect, but, uh, your maid isn't very thorough.
no, she is most thorough.
she cleans here tomorrow.
for monthly rentals, she -- monthly?
Yes. She comes every third day.
so he's been here recently, in the last two days.
the chips would imply this, yes?
Yes, they--they would.
this?
Oh, th-those are not ours.
he's coming back.
okay. Thank you. Nice work.
listen, I don't want to make you mad, but I found something really interesting, and I want you to take a look at it.
you can't make me mad. Go ahead. What'd you find?
you first. Who made you so happy?
forensics. There's substantial traces of Melanie's blood on the seat of Hector's truck.
so... Happy day. - Yeah.
now I'm gonna go and see what Hector has to say about it.
What'd you find?
uh, it--it can wait.
blood? Yes.
last time I saw her, two weeks ago, she was disrespectful, so I had to tune her up.
she got a bloody nose.
was physical abuse a normal occurrence in your relationship, or is this more of a recent thing?
she chose me.
she wanted to know where the edges are.
I showed her.
go ahead. Say it.
I think he's telling the truth.
and I disagree. I'm charging him.
no. Yes. Good. That's good. Go ahead.
you got more than enough evidence.
Oops, nearly forgot.
okay, tell me. What'd you find?
telling you won't do. I have to show you.
uh, I made a booking for two for this afternoon.
could you put us on the terrace?
it's more romantic.
Thanks. Yeah. Patrick. Lovely. See you then.
don't fret. I wouldn't seduce you over a meal.
that would be very sophomoric.
I didn't think you were trying to seduce me.
come on. How could that thought not have entered your head?
your denial that it did intrigues me.
bite me.
what is this?
that's Van Pelt?
what is she doing?
this's a live feed from the shand creek restaurant, and this is how we're gonna catch Melanie's killer.
say again. - Nothing.
Oh, I see you.
how do I look? - Good. You look good.
I meant, can you see the wire?
Nope. Nope.
the killer plans to bring his victim back to this room.
and when he does, we're gonna be here to greet him.
how sweet is that?
this is all a big elaborate joke you're gonna apologize for now. Yes?
whoever killed melanie had to be there that night at shand creek.
your time line proves it.
there's no way anyone else could've done it.
one of the 20 people there that night killed Melanie.
all 20 of those people are there now today, including the killer.
and he's gonna try it again today? Come on.
no, no. Yes, yes, that's just the point.
Yes, he is gonna try again.
he's planning on it.
and he's gonna try again today because we're gonna make him try again.
because he's not in control of his desires.
he's been thinking of nothing else but this perverse craving of his.
he's gotten so close.
he's desperate to go all the way.
all we need to do is present him with something he can't resist, something that he will jump at, and damn the consequences.
give it a try.
if I'm wrong, there's no harm down.
it's fusion.
confusion.
up to me, make it a cheeseburger every time.
Oh, me, too. With onion rings.
let's do it. - Not yet.
why not?
this is actually quite good.
you're meant to shout at me and leave.
now you've gone too far!
I hate you!
smooth work. - Don't.
can I call you a cab?
no, thank you. I need a walk.
I have a number for a cab if I need one.
thank you for a delicious meal.
Oh, you're so welcome.
I just left the restaurant.
I'm heading towards the main road now.
sorry, miss. I didn't see you there. I was just, uh...
you okay?
Oh, sure. Absolutely. Just scared me a little.
he w--he wasn't su-- what the hell is he doing there?
he was there.
he was there that night.
going for a stroll?
fresh air.
only you need to be careful.
we've been looking for a murderer loose around here.
Yeah, went after a girl just like you--red hair and all.
no kidding.
Yeah. I'll, uh, drive you up to the main road.
Oh, thank you, but...
no, no trouble, really. My car's just over here on the side.
please advise.
keep it rolling. - Beg your pardon?
I'm not used to wearing these shoes.
Hey, you, uh, are you out here alone?
I had an argument with my date.
Oh, sorry to hear that. You know, if you were my date, I wouldn't, uh, I wouldn't argue, pretty lady like yourself.
my car's just right over here.
it--it's okay. I'll walk.
wait, no. I won't let you.
Re--really, ma'am.
really, I-I don't feel comfortable letting you go.
really, I'm fine.
I think you're intoxicated.
I am not. - Get your hands off her!
what the hell's the matter with you? You're under arrest!
no, you're under arrest, you piece of-- Rigsby, calm down.
Cho? Is this clown one of yours?
what the hell is going on here?
sheriff, everything okay?
well, yeah, now it is...
suppose so. Barely.
everything's funny.
well, if you try. I mean, come on. It's pretty funny.
strange, though.
I-I was sure the chef would bite.
I mean, there's still a chance he could show up.
the chef--Malcolm?
why do you think it's him?
he uses way too much butter. - Say?
he's a gluttonous baby. He's self-indulgent.
he wants what he wants and he takes it.
too much butter. - Yeah.
it's fascinating the way your mind works.
one thing, though--Malcolm was in the kitchen with 20 people when Melanie was taken.
he couldn't have done it. - Hang on. There--there's a way he could
forgive me if I can't stay for more of your theorizing, But I've gotta go and see if I can save your colleagues from getting formal complaints in their files.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
no, I know where it is.
okay. Right here.
that's good. You're good. You're good.
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Good? Good.
quiet! Quiet!
okay. Okay, help me put this on the bed.
okay.
stop. Think. Do not move.
whatever you do, do not move. - What?
do not move!
stop! Come back here! Stop!
what are you doing here?
think. Think.
what are you doing here?
does it matter? I'm here.
this place is surrounded by police and CBI agents.
Oh, no. - He's lying.
they would be up here arresting us by now if they were here.
s. W. A. T. They're waiting on s. w.a. t. There's no way out of this.
nobody.
let's just kill them and get out of here. - Yeah.
whoa, whoa, listen to me.
you can walk away from all of this.
no disrespect, but you're both clinically insane.
you're not gonna go to prison.
you'll go to a hospital for a couple of years, and you can walk away.
shut up! Just shut up!
I'm--I'm trying to think.
Oh, now he's trying to think!
don't pretend you didn't want this. You wanted it just as much as me!
Yeah, but I told you we didn't have enough time.
I told you that we didn't-- don't you point that at me! - I swear to god, woman, one more word out of you!
police - Put the gun down! - No!
okay. All right. It's okay.
you're gonna be fine, all right?
here, come on. Okay?
we're gonna get you out of here.
I don't get it.
she actually enjoyed helping him kill.
one crazy evil person, I understand. But two? Husband and wife?
marriage is supposed to be a sacred, loving thing.
they were soul mates in their own strange way.
let's go.
mentalist /'Men-t3-List/ Noun
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
victim is Christine Tanner, 15, drowned, washed up on the beach in Santa Marta.
who's got the ultraviolet? - Yep.
so she drowned. Why us?
coroner found a wound consistent with getting hit in the head with a surfboard and water in her lungs,
only it was ditchwater
no salt, a lot of bugs.
so the killer is clever, but not as clever as he thinks he is.
Santa marta sheriff's not taking this one?
state beach, state case.
all right, what are you doing?
grace is mentally telling me where she hid the van keys.
if I find them, I get to drive.
so now you're psychic?
Oh, no, no, no. This is all science.
concentrate, grace.
tell me with your mind only.
forward, backward, left, right.
how is that science?
he watched you hide the keys.
from the men's room? That would be a trick.
who's got shotgun?
can we go now?
Santa Maria, CA
Leah, go ahead.
you had the keys in your hand the whole time.
U've gotta let it go, man.
did you have the keys in your hand?
if I tell you how it's done, pp the magic circle will send a team of assassins to kill us all.
it's the law.
her body was discovered rr on this beach.
coast guard says that means she was put in the water anywhere within a mile north of here.
any further along the coast, the current would have taken her out to mexico.
how long was she in the water?
we're still waiting on the coroner's report.
Hey, excuse me.
are you guys cops?
C. b.I.
what's c. b.i?
california bureau of investigation.
cops.
cops.
so is it true what they're saying--somebody killed Chris?
Yes, it is true.
you were christine's friend?
Yeah. We hang at the same breaks.
I love chris.
what happened?
we don't know yet. What's your name?
I'm Hope. That's win.
when was the last time you saw christine?
uh, three days ago.
sunset patrol. Epic northeast swell.
Chris loved to go out at sunset.
she would stay out till it was dark as dark.
how did she seem lately-- just, you know, any enemies or...
stuff like that?
uh, not--not around here.
everybody loved chris.
was she dating anybody?
dating?
okay, was she hooking up with anybody in particular?
Danny kurtik, mostly.
jeez, Hope.
what? They were hookin' up.
Danny would never hurt chris.
duh, of course not.
that's not what they were asking.
they were asking who she was hooking up with, which would be danny.
it wasn't a big, dark secret.
I need you to write down your names and the numbers we can reach you at.
win? - Yeah?
if chris was a color, what color would she be?
uh, orange... Or pink.
no, o-orange is right.
if she were an animal, what kind of animal would she be?
uh, I don't know. A rabbit?
how is this relevant?
everything's relevant.
Chris was good people.
I hope you find who did this.
we'll do our best.
how is that relevant?
we're looking for someone who doesn't like orange rabbits.
exactly.
you know what, boys? I like it here.
Yeah. I think i'll stay for a while.
what?
okay.
let's just leave him here.
excuse the mess.
Chrissy was the house-proud one around here.
we understand. Mr. Tanner?
we may have to ask you some tough questions, so...
that's okay.
can't tell Lisa nothing she hasn't heard before, and Micah don't...
he don't give a damn. He's slow.
he's just... Sad 'cause he sees lisa is.
all the same...
come on, kids. - Come on, Micah. Let's go.
can you take him outside? - You got it, dad.
come on. Let's go outside.
so when did you notice Christine was missing?
yesterday morning.
she hadn't made nothing for the kids, and iI realized I hadn't seen her in a while.
I mean, she may be away one night and i wouldn't know, but you know...
when was the last time you saw her?
monday morning.
any idea where she was during that time period?
no. No. Chrissy's real independent. You never...
never had to worry about Chrissy.
so two days to notice your daughter's gone and another to report it.
I work. I mean, I work construction. I never miss a day.
I-I can't watch her all the time.
her mother's not around?
she died. She was killed in a car wreck.
I'm sorry.
almost five years ago now.
drunk driver t-boned her.
college kid. Walked away laughin'.
not a scratch, you know?
not a scratch.
so Christine kind of took over for her mom, huh?
cooked, cleaned, looked after the little ones?
Yeah. Don't know what we're gonna do now.
Christine was arrested last year?
that was... Stupid. It was a couple of joints. No big deal.
well, how is it she got into drugs?
she wasn't into drugs. She was straightedge, if anything.
it's her dumb-ass friend darlene.
Darlene--last name?
Pappas, but Chrissy wasn't hanging out much with darlene anymore,
not since she got big into surfing.
then she started hanging with a different crowd.
who were they?
they're surfers, you know-- not like bum surfers.
they seem like good kids, you know? They were upscale.
they'd pick her up in their-- their audis and what not.
you know, they were a good influence on Christine.
they helped her with her schoolwork, and she was thinking about college.
anybody in particular vv she was close to?
I don't really know 'em.
I mean, there's names I'd hear all the time.
there's, like, Andy and Danny and Hope, and then there's this new guy, - Flipper, she talked about lately. - Talks about how?
just that she was, you know, they were hangin' together, you know?
like, "I'll see you at Flipper's," stuff like that.
Hey, Lisa? Honey?
Yeah, dad?
Hey, honey, could you, uh, fix some lunch for your brother, please?
Yeah, okay. - Thanks.
no, I saw it. - they're further down the beach.
what, you didn't bring a bucket?
are you okay? - Damn it.
it's gotta be tough. - What?
I mean, a drunk driver-- Isn't that what happened to your mother?
sorry. It's not my business.
we don't discuss our personal lives in this unit.
it's not useful, and it's not professional.
Cho, names to check-- Darlene Pappas, Andy, Danny, Hope and Flipper.
flipper? Okay.
got it. Hold on.
there's a Darlene Pappas in youth authority lockup
possession and resisting arrest. I'll get her in here.
great. Where's Jane?
he's still pursuing inquiries at the beach.
Darlene, you're a friend of christine tanner?
what do you want?
Christine's dead.
what do you want?
I want you to help us find out who killed her.
killed? How?
drowned. - Drowned?
damn.
who does she know that might have reason to do this?
well, now that you mention it, there was a guy.
what was his name?
Yes, Darlene, if you help us, I'll talk to the prosecutor,
see if we can help you with these charges you've got pending.
okay.
last year she was banging an older guy, like old.
she called him "Pops." - No name? Just Pops?
pops, that's it.
one time, uh, she said he was getting weird, and she was talking about dumping him,
but I don't know if she ever did.
like I say, we haven't been tight for a while now.
that's interesting, but it's not enough for a call to the d. a.
did she say anything else about him?
anything at all?
he was good in bed, and he liked '50s music, like elvis and stuff. And that's it.
well, that's enough, right?
well, call the d. a.
got a hit with those deputy interviews.
philip Handler, goes by "Flipper.
badass surfer-- it's a long sheet, including time for assault on a woman a few years back.
how bad?
hundred stitches bad.
got an address. - Let's go.
philip Handler? Police! May we speak with you, please?
Mr. Handler? - Clear.
Mr. Handler?
these friends of yours?
Hey, guys, come in. Come in.
I'm just about to discredit Nimzovich's theory on the french advance once and for all.
dream on, trick.
what led you to Flipper anyway?
his hair. It's braided the exact same way as the victim.
she did his do.
I guess, uh, you must be bad cop.
I try.
tough. Go to it, sister.
you can be pretty tough yourself.
you did quite a number on her.
uh, we had...
different expectations that led to... Friction.
but, um, what can you do?
Friction? She nearly died.
do you know what she was doing that started the argument when I hit her?
she was pouring the sump oil from her car right into the storm drain, okay?
you might as well take an ax and go chop up a family of dolphins.
was christine tanner damaging marine life somehow?
what? No.
Chris understood.
Chris was a child of the ocean.
you like hanging out with children, don't you?
I do.
they're pure in flesh and spirit.
what's not to like?
Christine was a beautiful girl.
Yes, she was.
so why'd you kill her?
I didn't kill her.
why would I kill her?
did you have sex with her?
Oh, I thought about it. I thought about it a lot.
but no, I didn't. You know why? - Why?
because it would be wrong, and I'm all about doing what's right.
I wait until they hit legal age, then bam!
happy birthday, baby.
when was the last time you saw her?
Oh, so you can try and pin this on me?
no, thanks.
see, the thing is, Flip, Lisbon here is looking at you like you're a porkchop because you fit the profile.
your life is in chaos. You're lonely. You're depressed.
you're addicted to drugs and pornography and a little nuts, to be honest.
you're exactly the kind of man that does terrible things to women.
uh, but I don't think you did this.
cause I think deep down you're a good man.
you should learn to use your bishops a little more efficiently, but otherwise a good man.
I saw Chris three days ago-- sunset patrol at Devon point break.
was that monday with Hope and win and those guys?
right. We--we rode until dark, and then we partied a while on the beach.
and then I went home.
on my mother's life.
what do you mean, person of interest?
this guy kill my Chrissy or what?
Mr. Tanner, if we make an arrest, you'll be the first person I call, I promise.
I'm gonna have somebody take you home.
this him? Is this him?
calm down, okay? You need to go home and take care of your children.
you're dead, bastard! You're dead! You're dead, you bastard!
go home now!
look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
you need to go home.
let's go home, daddy.
come on.
Yeah.
coroner just told me that Christine's body was put in the water sometime early Tuesday morning.
so that monday night party is critical.
somebody there had to have known what happened later that night.
okay, boss, we're on it.
Hi, people.
Oh, thank you very much, ma'am, but, uh, we don't need a grief counselor.
we know how to grieve.
good, because i'm not a grief counselor.
the principal didn't want to say "homicide detective" in front of the other students.
agent Lisbon, california bureau of investigation.
Hey, guys. Hope and Win I know. You must be Danny and Andy.
quick test--if you could be any animal you want, what would you be? Quick.
dolphin. - You?
uh, same, or, uh, a killer whale.
a gull. No, a hawk.
uh, uh, a tiger.
interesting. - Why?
when we spoke before about monday night at Devon point,
you didn't mention that you had a party after you went surfing.
a party? No, it wasn't a party.
not what Flipper says.
flipper told? Dude.
come on, guys. I mean, we--we partied, threw a little frisbee.
what's the big deal?
no big deal. It's just that you were the last people, aside from her killer, to see Christine alive.
she was drowned later that night.
that night? - You serious?
Oh, my god.
um, sorry, we have to go. We have a. P. English.
we'll walk you.
so tell us about this party monday night.
you didn't say anything about it before. Why?
and don't lie or I'll know.
we were drinking beer, ma'am.
shut up. - What?
we're all gonna be applying for college soon, all right?
we can't get caught for drinking.
my mom would exterminate me.
plus we were trespassing.
the beach at devon point is totally, uh, private property.
Danny, what does devon point mean to you?
uh, it's...
it's my dad's land, and, uh, he's building these heinous condos.
we go there to spite him, I guess.
who else was there that night?
us and Flipper, that's all.
it wasn't exactly raging.
we all cut out about 10: 00, 10: 30 maybe.
Chris stayed to clean up.
she's all, uh, "save our oceans," you know?
did Flipper leave then, too?
he cut out early, after we ran out of brews.
do you think he came back, maybe? - Like, Flipper did it? No.
we shouldn't have left her there, guys.
she wanted to stay.
you ask me, she was meeting somebody.
shut up, Hope. You don't know that.
no, but I think it, and so do you.
Danny asked her to go home with him, and she said no.
you and chris were lovers?
lovers? Uh, no.
we hooked up on occasion. - You made love. You were lovers.
no. Uh, I mean, Andy was totally there, too, right, Andy?
Yeah.
it wasn't a big deal. We're all just friends.
Andy and I hook up with Hope, too, sometimes. Doesn't mean we're... Lovers.
Yeah. That would be weird.
Yeah, I guess.
you ever hear of anyone named pops?
pops? - Yeah.
uh, no.
okay. Well, that's all we need for now. Thank you.
Thanks. - Thank you.
don't leave town. - That's a cop joke.
how long you gonna be, you think?
Mr. Rayburn, Christine Tanner's murder may have occurred here.
it takes as long as it takes.
I already got the developer way up my tailpipe.
we're three weeks behind thanks to the crappy labor pool here.
economy like this, and people just don't show up for work?
boggles my mind.
anybody not show up lately?
night guard just this week walked off the job.
cement truck shows up in the morning, can't get on the freakin' site.
that alone put me back six hours.
when did he quit? - Monday.
what section were you working then?
southeast quad.
what's his name, the night guard?
I got his paperwork in the site office if you want it.
Jorge! What are you, nuts? That load goes over here.
the paperwork? - Right.
what, you think he might have, uh, done this murder?
Lisbon! Come take a look at this.
what?
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Rayburn?
see that?
what is it?
tip of Eddie Garcia's nose.
get out of here.
how is it you don't even notice a nose in your floor?
that's what I'm telling you. We're trying to finish this thing too fast.
what the hell's going on?
Oh, for heaven sakes. Is--is that a person, someone I employ?
we think so.
God help me. If it's not one thing, it's...
Mr. Kurtik? Dane kurtik?
Oh, sure. Right, just talk to my lawyers.
as you saw, I have no knowledge of this regrettable incident.
C. B. I. Serious crimes unit.
serious crimes? The man fell into wet cement.
if someone had been here with a camera, he'd be on "America's funniest videos.
serious crimes? Come on, guys.
I'm sorry, sir. This is now a crime scene.
you're gonna have to suspend work until we're done investigating.
suspend work?
hell, I'm calling Tommy Alvarez--the sheriff.
we believe this situation is related to the death of Christine Tanner.
you know her?
I've heard the name, obviously. It's been on the news.
your son Danny and Christine were close. You never met her?
maybe I have. My son has a lot of friends. Is this an interrogation?
is it? - No, sir, it isn't.
we appreciate your cooperation. We'll be in touch, maybe. Thank you.
Hey, Pops?
hear you're good in bed. What's the secret?
I don't know what you're talking about, but you mean to be offensive, I guess, and you've succeeded very well.
and I'm going to be taking this up with your superiors. What is your name?
my name is Patrick Jane... - Jane, stop.
and I have no superiors.
and I'll tell you what I'm talkin' about, you sweaty little pervert.
you were having sex with a 15-year-old girl.
Jane, stop. - I never touched christine tanner.
liar.
and believe me when I tell you that you just now made the worst mistake of your miserable little life.
believe me, no matter how this turns out, I've made worse mistakes,
and you're lying about Christine Tanner. You were laying her like carpet.
arrest him, Lisbon. Statutory rape.
with what evidence?
he's playing rockabilly. '50s music. What more do you want?
I can only apologize for my colleague's bizarre behavior. I'm sorry.
Lisbon, hush. Don't be so damn blinkered. Look at him.
he was raping her, all right.
I just don't know yet whether he killed her as well.
did you kill her?
look me in the eye and tell me the truth, you filthy old goat.
get him!
how--how dare you?
you brought him all the way back here why?
the local sheriff begged me not to put him in his jail.
Kurtik's a big cheese down there.
that is a signal.
is that not a signal that we should cut this man loose?
he hit Jane pretty good. People were watching.
I had to arrest him.
this guy is connected. This guy is...
he has the governor's home phone number.
and we both know that jane was asking for it.
you couldn't just give kurtik a stern talking-to instead?
what about Christine Tanner, sir?
if kurtik was having sex with her, that gives him motive to kill.
if, and that's a hunch based on rockabilly.
it's a Jane hunch. You keep him around for a reason.
look, just let us work Kurtik until his lawyer gets here.
maybe we can get something more. - All right. Work him gently.
do you have a thing for youngsters in general, Dane?
or was it Christine in particular that appealed to you?
that I can understand, because you know, you meet some 15-year-olds,
they're just as smart and mature and articulate as any adult, right?
they are adults, basically. Maybe Christine was one of them.
are you serious?
do you actually obtain confessions with that gambit?
all the time. - Amazing. People are stupid.
listen, I admire cops. I think you do a great job, and I'm happy to sit here and chat with you until my lawyer gets here.
but i'm not gonna say anything you want to hear.
so relax, huh? - He's not, is he?
he's not gonna confess.
What'd you think, he'd break under the bad lighting conditions?
let's go back to devon point.
what for?
so I can put the second half of my cunning plan into effect.
Jane, wait. What cunning plan?
uh, danny, hi. Patrick Jane.
listen, we need your help.
do you want to help us catch christine's killer?
okay, then. Good.
meet me at devon point with your friends in, uh, two hours.
great.
what cunning plan?
just so you know, I'm suing the C. B. I. And the attorney general's office for wrongful arrest and unlawful imprisonment,
and I will drop this suit when they fire you and agent Lisbon.
best of luck.
you're not scared of me, huh?
that's a mistake.
keep walking, Mr. Kurtik, or I'm gonna have to arrest you again.
if you were 15 years younger, I'd give you a shot.
Mr. Jane?
Mr. Jane?
thanks for coming.
the police need your help.
first Christine, then the security guard. They're at a loss.
did the guard stumble across chris being killed?
maybe it was some kind of love triangle.
tell me, do you sincerely want to help catch christine's murderer,
even if the killer is someone close to you?
Yes, of course. - Absolutely.
your friend Flipper served time for assaulting a woman. Did you know that?
it was flipper? He did it? - Could be.
then again, danny, christine and your father were having an affair.
wait. What? - Yeah.
no way. No, no. That's--that's ridiculous. No.
Danny, get real. We knew. We all knew.
well, what did you expect me to do, turn in my own dad?
I mean, it's-- it's not like he forced Chris to do it, you know?
she--she was-- she was into it.
was it your father you thought she was going to meet with that night?
Yes. - No.
well, I-I don't know.
well, just 'cause they're having an affair doesn't mean your father killed Christine.
it could have been Flipper. - Right.
or someone else.
Did--didn't you say you had a way of finding out?
actually... A way you can find out.
I want to hypnotize you all so that you can remember details of that night.
it's safe. I'm fully trained.
hell, I used to hypnotize people for a living.
um, no--no, thanks.
your subconscious minds may recall things that could help us find the killer.
hypnosis will let you come up with those things.
well, what-- what kind of things? Who knows?
maybe something chris said, maybe a glimpse of someone on the bluff there.
the smallest detail that you can recall could be a vital clue.
I don't want you messing around inside my head, man. No offense.
Ah, but that's the thing.
with hypnosis, I can't mesmerize you against your will.
it's not possible.
you are in control the whole time.
what do you say?
good.
I want you to close your eyes... And listen.
listen only to my voice.
think. Think back to that night.
the bonfire...
the sound of the ocean.
the sound of the ocean.
I don't know what you will recall of that night, but I know that you will recall something,
because it's all there in your memory.
all you have to do is go back, back to that night and be there.
and there you are.
what is it, hope? What do you see?
I see danny's father there above the rocks.
no, you don't. - What is he doing?
staring at us, at Chris.
that's it. He's staring.
what's wrong with him?
come back, Hope.
What--what happened?
you're okay. You did very well, thank you.
you really saw Mr. Kurtik?
no, you didn't. You didn't.
Danny, I'm sorry. I can't help what I saw.
my dad didn't kill christine!
how do you know he didn't?
Yeah, how do you know?
you know what? Screw all of you guys, okay?
you guys suck!
Oh, Danny, wait! Don't be mad! Danny, wait!
D-danny! Come on, stop.
Ah, Danny's mad. We should go.
screw danny.
his dad killed christine.
Yeah, well, it's late anyway.
thanks for your help, guys. - No problemo.
so what do you think? Did it work?
I think... Three, two, one...
now.
how cool would it have been if one had walked in right then, huh?
did you arrest him? Did he confess?
Mr. Kurtik? No.
thing is, Hope, Mr. Kurtik has a cast-iron alibi for that evening.
so you couldn't have seen him standing there on that bluff.
but that's so weird.
in my trance, I saw him clear as day.
maybe it's symbolic. - You want symbolic?
you're a hawk, and Christine was a rabbit.
what does that even mean?
bird of prey, rabbit... You tell me.
what it means is you never liked christine tanner.
not true!
what it means is I never really hypnotized you.
you pretended to be in a trance to give us a fake story and incriminate an innocent man.
No! no.
just tell us what happened that night. - From the beginning.
flipper had already left, wasted as usual.
the guard told us to get out, or he'd call the cops.
Danny told him to step off. His dad owns the place.
he's dead.
he didn't mean to. It was an accident.
we couldn't help the guard, see?
but danny we could.
so we all promised not to tell, all of us...
except chris. Not Chris.
you've gotta understand, everything Danny had worked for his whole life was just washing away
because Chris has to do the right thing.
he just hit her over the head, and then she was still moving,
so he dragged her to the trough there and...
drowned her in it, held her under until she stopped moving.
and you, Win and Andy didn't say a word-- two people murdered.
what if I was next?
I've never seen Danny like that.
he was like a different person or something.
okay. You're safe now.
excuse us.
I-I can't let my dad be punished for something he didn't do, no matter what a tool he is.
so you're confessing.
we know it was you that killed christine and the guard.
what? No, no, no, that's not right. Who told you that?
it's so completely not true that it's insane.
how can you do this?
I mean, I-I knew you had a cold streak, but this? - Danny, I'm sorry.
I had to tell the truth.
you're only making it worse by lying. You're only deceiving yourself.
it was her, okay?
it was her who killed Chris.
hope was jealous of her ever since she started hanging out with us.
used to be hope who was all that.
then Chris came along, and we only hooked up with Hope when Chris wasn't around.
that's so distorted and not true!
no, I am telling the truth now.
the security guard...
just take him!
it was an accident.
and then Chris said she was gonna call the police.
she--she said we couldn't cover it up because it'd be wrong.
then Hope-- I-I don't even know.
hope just went crazy...
hit her! She hit her!
I did it for you, jerk! I did it for you!
she was doing his dad!
she's acting as a judge over his life, telling him his life is over
and that he's going to jail because she's--she's gotta show integrity and morals.
she was a prissy, hypocritical bitch, and she was gonna ruin his life.
it was Flipper.
Oh, really?
Yeah, it was Flipper.
what if I said it was you, Andy? You killed Christine.
what? That's bull. That's ridiculous.
have a seat.
don't be shy.
I didn't kill her, man.
sure you did.
so did you... And you...
and you.
all four of you killed her.
hope was always smarter than any of you.
you never appreciated that.
she made all of you take part to make all of you equally guilty,
so that no one could tell on the others.
and now you're all equally under arrest.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot...
statutory rape, huh?
what'll he get?
he probably won't serve time, not without Christine's testimony.
but we'll have fun trying.
you have good kids.
Yeah. I do.
you're all they have.
Yeah, I know.
be good to them.
I am good to them.
my father was a good man, just like you are.
and after my mother died, he was a self-pitying drunk just like you are.
he killed himself--damn near killed me and my brothers, too.
get some help. Your kids deserve it. So do you.
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
the girls were last seen leaving Sullivan's tavern, 1:00 in the morning.
a truck driver spotted the car around 5: 30 and called it in.
look, I only have four deputies.
only a couple of 'em have ever seen a body killed in anger.
if what we have here is a homicide, I'm gonna need some help.
just to be clear, except in special circumstances, we don't help out.
we take over.
you need to be okay with that.
okay. I guess.
she's not really a morning person.
she'll improve.
names of the missing women?
Nicole Gilbert and Kara Palmer.
local girls, both 21.
work together at hunting store in town.
last night was Nicole's engagement party.
the car was found exactly like this?
Yep. Well, no.
uh, the door was open just like that. We popped the trunk.
Hey, there's a different set of tire tracks here that pulled off the road.
a truck or big S. U. V. looks like.
they're still fresh.
must be from the trucker who called in the car.
make sure forensics gets a mold. - Yep.
what's going on with your dog?
Oh, he's confused somehow.
this behavior?
he's saying, "Hey, look! Here they are!
give me my Slim Jim already."
Parker, do you have a better dog close by somewhere?
sir, this is the best dog in the county.
come on, Dexter. People are waitin' on us.
did you look under the car?
under the car? - Yeah.
of course we looked under the car.
Oh, crap.
one or two?
one.
it's Kara Palmer.
so... Where's Nicole Gilbert?
good boy, Dexter. He's got her on lock now.
is there any way to tell from the scent trail how fast Nicole was moving?
Oh, sure. Dexter's detecting skin cells.
they fall off your body all the time at a pretty consistent rate.
so the faster you move, the thinner the trail you leave.
so are we following Nicole on foot or Nicole tied up in the back of a truck?
I don't know.
you said you can tell how fast she was moving.
Oh, Dexter can tell. I'm just walking behind him.
Nicole, can you hear us?
tell us about Kara and Nicole.
I've known them practically their whole lives.
Kara was a real sweetheart.
you'll find no one around here will say a bad word about Kara Palmer.
good churchgoing family, no trouble at all.
meaning Nicole Gilbert was trouble.
Nicole -- well, she had her problems.
drugs and drug-related foolishness mostly.
fraud, petty theft.
any violent offenses?
no. No. No, she was more of a troubled soul than a bad person.
tough life. Her mom died when she was 7.
her father raised her on meth and hot dogs.
he's in prison now for drug dealing.
Kara and her family were all the stability Nicole ever had.
so she and Kara were good friends.
odd match.
Yeah, real close since they were little.
in a small town, you don't choose your friends.
they're the same age. They're female. That's enough.
Kyle, boys, thank you for coming.
sheriff. Where do you want us?
well, you know this valley as well as anyone. Just pick your spots.
do we know if she's armed?
what do you know about this case?
uh, same thing as everybody else, I guess.
some badass townie girl got mad drunk, stabbed her friend to death and ran off into the woods.
Kara Palmer died from loss of blood.
Nicole Gilbert is missing. Maybe she ran off. Maybe she was abducted. We don't know.
don't assume anything.
message received and understood, ma'am.
all right, fellas.
you knew Nicole. You think she did this?
who knows what others are capable of?
she sure had built up a lot of bad karma.
but I don't know.
she seemed to be turning her life around.
bad karma doesn't have an expiration date.
uh, actually, it does, according to traditional Buddhist teachings.
I'm counting on it.
let's go.
people in town are already saying Nicole did this.
but I don't believe it.
she will have to tell me herself that she did this before I believe it.
Nicole loved our daughter, and we loved Nicole almost like she was our own.
almost.
why -- why would she kill her?
she had her troubles, lord knows, but...
she wasn't crazy.
has there been any tension between them recently?
Oh, nothing. No. None at all.
well... - Yes?
that boy. That -- that fiance of Nicole's.
we never met him but once or twice, and he seemed nice enough.
he works lumber. You know how those fellas are. Like to play the buck.
all but sleep at Sullivan's tavern.
but, you know, these days, you have to look past the piercings
and the tattoos and all that, don't you?
but Kara didn't think much of him.
no?
didn't approve.
I think there might have been some tension there.
what was her problem with Jason?
Oh, I guess just a feeling that he wasn't trustworthy, you know?
but Nicole was in love, and she thought Kara was just jealous 'cause Kara didn't have a boyfriend.
did Jason ever get violent with Nicole? - No.
not that I heard, but I wouldn't be surprised.
Nicole had her fair share of that type.
Kara didn't have a boyfriend?
Kara could've had anyone she liked.
she had no shortage of suitors.
but have you seen the men around here?
it's all drunken lumberjacks and hippie pot farmers.
Kara had...
she had higher standards than that.
what's the problem now, Parker?
best dog in the county, huh?
come on.
she can't answer you.
or doesn't want to.
no, she's a captive or dead.
how do you know that?
how far have we come? What, 5 miles?
Nicole would've been barefoot, probably drunk.
it was a dark night.
there's no way she could cover that distance.
someone must have her in a vehicle, and Dexter lost the scent.
okay. So you're in charge now. What do we do?
it's close to evening. Call off the search.
gather everybody together and -- Give up?
there's a girl missing.
tell me, of the men on this search party,
which one would you guess is a violent sexual predator?
what kind of question is that? - Whose name just popped into your head?
someone's did. There's always someone.
this is your method?
asking people to guess who did it?
strange kind of detective work you guys do.
Jane's being dramatic, but if somebody did victimize Kara and Nicole,
statistics show that they'd be really likely to join the search party.
they enjoy the deceit. It's like being the invisible man.
is that right? - Yeah.
so gather up the search party. Let me have a crack at 'em.
he gets results.
I know all these guys.
I'll vouch for every one of them.
well, most of them.
I'll call 'em in.
get your truck outta my way.
we need to talk to you about Nicole Gilbert.
I don't have time for this, guys.
let's have a little chat.
where were you going in such a hurry, Jason?
back to the woods to find Nicole.
how do you know she was in the woods?
I don't. I hope she's in the woods.
cause if she's not in the woods, then she can be anywhere in the frickin' world, right?
why not search with the rest of the town?
Nah, I cover more ground alone.
why did Kara drive Nicole home after the party? Why didn't you?
because I was too drunk.
or maybe you two had a fight.
no. We were celebrating our engagement.
that's right about when the fights start.
we video'd the whole thing. Okay?
you can watch it and see. There's no fighting.
we'll do that. Where is that video?
it's in my truck.
there's this whole Kara issue we have to talk about.
maybe that blew up, huh? - What issue?
well, Kara didn't like you, didn't think you were good enough for Nicole,
thought you were untrustworthy.
that's funny. Is that what you do?
you try to get me all upset or somethin' so I look guilty?
does it upset you?
that Kara didn't like you?
she was trying to undermine you?
I couldn't care less, okay?
cause it's not true anyhow.
Kara liked me well enough.
least I never heard her say different.
where were you between 1: 00 and 7: 00 A. M. last night?
I was here, passed out on the floor.
we'll regroup in the morning, first light.
before you go, Patrick Jane from the CBI would like to have a word with all of you.
Thanks, sheriff Nelson.
I want you to look at me, all of you, and listen closely.
I'd like you to raise your hands above your heads like this.
both hands.
you, too, sheriff.
and you, agent Lisbon.
please.
good. Very good.
one of you -- one of you here killed Kara Palmer and abducted Nicole Gilbert.
I want that person to lower their right hand now.
uh, okay. Okay, uh, usually gets a hit.
forget I even spoke.
sheriff Nelson, we have a 10-28 reported on Nicole Gilbert
a gas station convenience store.
I repeat, 10-28 on Nicole Gilbert.
copy that.
she had a nasty blow to her head, moderate concussion.
her feet are badly abraded.
and she has a lot of minor scratches and bruises.
mild hypothermia.
physically, she'll be fine in a day or so.
mentally, it's another story.
when you brought her in, she was in some kind of a psychotic state.
we've medicated her to take the edge off that, but she's still in deep shock.
she has no memory at all of the events that brought her here.
that's convenient.
if I just stabbed my best friend to death, I'd want to forget, too.
as soon as she's well enough, I'm charging her and taking her to jail.
sheriff, you have custody of Nicole, but the CBI's leading this investigation.
I decide when to file charges. We don't have the full facts yet.
facts? She's covered in blood.
she's carrying what looks to be the murder weapon,
which the forensic guys say has Kara's blood on it.
what more do you want?
if she well enough to speak to?
as long as you're gentle with her.
have you told her Kara's dead?
no. We don't want to upset her.
she's very fragile. - Yeah.
my name is Teresa Lisbon.
I'm with the California Bureau of Investigation.
we want to ask you a few questions about what happened to you and Kara.
I told the doctor I can't remember.
that's okay.
what's the last thing you do remember?
my party.
I remember leaving Sullivan's and getting in the car with Kara.
you know where my fiance is?
do you remember anything else about the party?
we had a good time.
nothing bad or unusual happened?
no.
we drank a lot... Danced.
Where's Kara?
you and Kara left the Sullivan in her car.
then what happened?
I don't know. I don't know. That's what I'm telling you.
the next thing I remember, I was in this bed.
what's wrong with me? What happened?
Where's -- where's Kara? Why won't anyone tell me anything?
it's okay. - She's dead.
stabbed to death.
no.
why did you say that?
she was gonna find out at some point.
the doctor said to be gentle.
Ah, doctors.
open your eyes, Nicole.
look at me.
open your eyes.
I told you the truth because you can handle it.
you have to. You will.
tell me you will.
what you have to do now, you have to remember what happened.
close your eyes and remember.
close your eyes.
you were driving with Kara down Flagship Road.
pull over. - What?
pull over!
why did you stop?
I was feeling sick.
there's a man.
what does he look like?
I don't know. I can't see. It's dark.
I can hear...
a loud rushing sound, like water.
then what happened? - I... I don't know.
I can't remember.
you have to.
no, I can't. - You have to.
I can't remember.
you have to. - No, I can't. I...
what have you been doing to her? Out!
that's bull.
she's got amnesia, but not so badly she can't finger somebody else for killing Kara.
rushing water, my ass.
no, she's telling the truth.
something happened -- something too horrible for her mind to handle.
her memory's blocked.
well, even if that's true. Maybe it's blocked because she killed Kara.
well, it's possible. I don't think so.
I think she's a victim. - How can you tell?
it's in her eyes.
well, then... Why didn't you say so? It's in her eyes.
here's me looking for facts.
why would she kill her best friend? What's her, uh, motive?
why do women kill other women? - Over men.
could've been fighting over Jason, though he's no Brad Pitt.
she was covered in blood. - Yes?
but it rained. It rained hard for a good few hours last night.
only when they recovered Nicole, she was still covered in blood. So...
so she must've been under good cover when it rained. She must've been indoors.
she was hiding.
or she was a captive, probably near the river
hence the sound of rushing water.
Rigsby, get a couple park rangers and organize a search of all the empty summer cabins, storage units and sheds within earshot of the river -- Caves, too.
Oh, and, Rigsby, have Van Pelt set up the video Jason shot at the party at Sullivan's tavern.
you got it, boss. - Let's go.
uh, sheriff?
there's a man out there that needs to silence Nicole before she recovers her memory.
so you say. - So I say.
no one should enter her room.
make sure your men keep her safe.
I know my business.
you mind yours, whatever in the heck it is.
how's Jason's alibi look?
alibi's solid. Several people saw him passed out at the bar.
damn. Nelson was right.
about what?
look at Jason's camera work. He's torn between Nicole and Kara.
I love this girl. I love this girl.
and I love you, baby. - So he had a thing for Kara.
it's no proof of motive unless Nicole knew about it.
and it doesn't look like they're feuding over him, does it?
I'm gettin' married!
wait. Stop right there. Run it back. There.
the guy at the bar staring at Kara, in the baseball cap.
I can blow it up.
Yeah, let's get a better look at that hat.
earthly Pure. What is that?
that's the brand of cosmetics we found in Kara's vehicle.
can we match that image to the D. M. V. database?
I can try.
truck driver for Earthly Pure Cosmetics.
I can call the company, see if I can get a track on him.
mm, yeah.
anything?
we searched every cabin and shack along the river. Nothing.
have them drop you back at the station. - Okay, boss.
where you goin'? - For a walk.
how you doing?
people are saying that I killed Kara.
that's why there's a policeman outside, so that I don't escape.
did you... Kill Kara?
I don't know.
I don't think I did.
do you think I did?
no. Why would you kill Kara?
Yeah. Why would I kill her?
but the thing is, I don't know.
I don't think I did, but... I don't know.
Hey, where you going?
take your hands off of me!
don't make me tase you, son.
guys, come on.
everybody just take it down a notch.
uh, what's going on?
he was trying to sneak in to see her.
I was just -- I was trying to see my girl, all right?
I was just walking through!
nobody's allowed to see her right now.
come on.
are they gone? - Yes.
I'm not ready to see anyone yet.
are you okay? You need me to get the nurse?
no. No, no. Don't leave me alone.
I won't.
what was it in particular that scared you just now, Nicole?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. It's not your fault.
Rulon, we need to talk to you about Kara Palmer. Let's go.
Rigsby, get up! Come on, get up!
let's go.
nice job, guys.
daddy, listen.
uh, what?
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there.
so how is it you know Kara Palmer?
this town's on my regular route, and I stop here to eat.
huntin' store's next door to the diner.
one day I walk in there, and a tight little pair of buns caught my eye.
boy meets girl.
so I walk over, and I start up a conversation.
what did you talk about?
offered her $10 to sit in my lap.
she said no, but she said no in that kind of way like I was lowballing her,
not no, like, to the general principle.
so I guess you could say I've been courtin' her.
I'm through town, I stop by, I give her some free stuff.
what did you expect from Kara in return for the free stuff?
I gave her a lot of stuff, so I'm thinking eventually...
some form of sexual congress.
and what did you get?
I disgust you, don't I?
a little, yeah.
you're pretty.
how's your lipstick supply?
you beautiful people got no idea what unattractive guys go through.
don't I have a heart?
don't I long to be held, to be loved, to be cherished?
Yes, I do.
so I gotta pay for a little human contact every now and then. Shoot me.
it's not my fault I look like this.
it is, actually.
with a low carb diet and exercise, you could look very different.
I got a glandular problem.
uh, how heavy are you, exactly?
I - I've lost a lot of weight in the last year.
you expected sexual favors from Kara. What did you get?
she was a beautiful woman.
there's nothing more beautiful than a beautiful woman, is there?
what did you get from Kara?
nothing at all.
in France, they'd have called her a coquette.
I was-- always held out high hopes.
I mean, there's always hope.
there sure is.
suppose she never did put out for you.
how would you feel?
if I killed all the women that had rejected me...
I'd have killed a lot of women.
we can place you at the same bar where Kara was last seen the night of her murder.
so were a whole boatload of other people.
where were you between the hours of 1: 30 and 7: 00 A. M. that morning?
my motel.
were you alone?
Yeah, I was.
so you have no alibi. - Nope.
doesn't look good for me, does it?
you seem fine with that.
you know, I read that prosecutors are not real happy with juries nowadays, 'cause those folks watch a lot of crime shows on TV,
and they walk in there expecting every crime scene to have, like, D. N. A. hair, whatnot.
and if that prosecutor does not hand them the defendant's spit on a plate, not guilty.
you saying you're innocent or careful?
you'll never know.
he has no alibi, but we have no proof, and I can't find an angle to get at him.
he's shameless. He likes the attention.
maybe we should let Jane at him.
Hey, Jane. Want to have a crack at him?
Oh, him? Oh, let him go.
let him go? - What for?
we had to fight to catch him.
Oh, you're such policemen. Yes, let him, go.
set him free. He's telling the truth.
you know this how?
he liked Kara.
why would he kill her and kidnap Nicole?
doesn't make any sense.
besides, he blushed when he lied about his weight.
a man without guile -- innocent.
Kara--not quite as innocent as she's been painted.
by the word of a creep.
an honest creep whose stuff she took knowing what kind of a man he was.
free eyeliner doesn't make her a whore, and a man blushing,
embarrassed by his weight, hardly makes him innocent.
it makes him sensitive about his weight.
I think he's a good prospect. We should keep him close.
Hey, is that Kara's mp3 player? - Yeah.
what are you doing with it?
uh, listening to music. It's pretty good.
but that's evidence. You can't play with that.
evidence of what, that she likes music?
it's in the log as physical evidence. It's evidence.
okay. What's with her?
seriously, if it's in the log, it's in the log. You can't touch it.
Really? All right. Well, uh... I'm sorry.
I, uh, I didn't realize it was a sacred thing.
I'll put it right back.
you gonna release Rulon or what?
I don't want to, but I don't have enough to hold him on.
let him go. We'll keep him under surveillance.
put that back. - All right. It's going.
Rulon, you can go. Sorry about the inconvenience.
there it is.
you want to get out of here?
put these on as quick as you can. Quick as you can.
if I may? Thank you.
I'll be right back.
there's nothing left to eat.
you cleaned us out this morning.
listen.
cars?
the flow of them. It's like a hum.
what if Nicole didn't hear water that night?
what if it was the flow of traffic?
then we should have been searching cabins on this side of town, near the highway.
we'll split up. I'll get a ranger to come and get me, search the likely spots.
you stay with Rulon.
where are we going?
you trust me, Nicole?
Yes.
I'm gonna help you remember what happened to you that night.
I don't want to remember. - You have to.
wherever you go, until you know the truth of what happened, you will be haunted.
until you see Kara's death redeemed, you'll be haunted.
you have to know the truth.
makes me feel sad.
it's the same music that was playing in Kara's car that night.
Yes.
Yes. How did you know that?
are you psychic? - No.
these machines have clocks.
they log in their memory what was played when.
Kara told you the secret, didn't she?
terrible secret she'd been keeping from you.
but she had to tell you. She had to be honest.
I'm gonna be sick. - Okay.
she said that I shouldn't marry Jason...
because he's no good, and then I said she was wrong.
then she said that she knows he's no good because...
she and he were sneaking around behind my back...
hooking up.
I'm sorry.
Nicole, then what happened?
no.
I don't want to remember any more. - You must.
no. I'm scared.
I've been where you're going.
I know how you feel. I know.
but you have to be brave.
I'm here. I won't let anything bad happen. I promise.
sorry. I'm so sorry!
Nicole, get back in the car.
go screw yourself!
get in the car!
Hey, mister, are you looking for a good time?
cause my friend here is a cheap whore, and I'm sure she'd be happy
Kara died trying to save me!
I'm being carried now.
I can hear the engine.
it's vibrating.
gasoline or diesel?
sounded like a diesel.
where is he taking you? Is it a long journey?
no. No, not long. Short.
a bumpy road.
agent Lisbon, your man Jane just kidnapped Nicole Gilbert from the hospital.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
and I'm not happy.
in fact, I'm mad as hell.
you people are my guests.
you can't come in here and abduct my suspects!
sheriff, I will fix this. Let me get on it right away.
son of a bitch. - What's up?
personnel issues.
pick up your phone, damn it.
we're stopping now.
it's like an old shed.
it was small and dark...
and cold and dusty.
I'm scared.
help me! Somebody help me!
the door won't open. I can't get out.
you will get out. - I can't get out!
it's gonna be fine. The -- the door will open. It will open.
is it bolted?
somebody help!
no.
chained?
no, I don't think so.
I'm trapped. I'm gonna die. Oh, my god. I'm gonna die!
Nicole, you can open it. It's your choice.
the door is unlocked if you want it to be.
open the door, Nicole. Open it.
it's cold up here at night, huh?
Yeah, and broiling during the day.
worst of both worlds.
he -- he's got a knife on me.
he's trying to rape me, but I won't let him.
where the hell are you?
Nicole remembered everything.
she can describe the suspect.
we're looking for a tall, well-built man with brown hair and glasses, mid 30s.
that's it? That describes half the men in California.
Yeah, that's it, but at least we know it wasn'her that killed Kara.
and it wasn't Rulon Farnes.
nice work. For this you illegally abducted her from the sheriff's custody?
Yeah. I was -- I was gonna tell you about it, but I figured seeing that it's illegal,
best to keep you out of it so that you have deniability.
Oh, how considerate of you.
listen to me carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
take her back to the hospital right now and sincerely apologize to sheriff nelson.
what was all that about?
my bad karma.
how's she doing, anyway? - Who?
the girl -- Nicole. How's she holding up?
okay, considering.
she remember anything yet?
we're doing what we can. - Good.
is there anything else, anything specific that you can remember about him?
just what he looked like. That's all I remember.
doesn't matter how small it is.
little things like what his voice sounded like or what he smelled like or...
pineapple.
that's great.
is this the last place to check?
no, there's one more place.
all right, let's go.
pineapple. He smelled like pineapple.
pineapple? What the hell go...
okay, good.
listen, tell Rigsby Teresa needs his help.
me? I'm at the eagle pine lodge off route 6.
okay.
Kyle, let's stay calm and think this through.
think what through?
I really don't want to shoot you, but I do have to take you into custody for killing Kara Palmer.
what are we gonna do about that?
it's not like I set out to hurt anyone.
I just wanted to talk to Nicole.
before she ran off and got married?
I've noticed her around town for a long time.
I didn't want her marrying that guy Jason.
she's too good for him.
please, Kyle, I really and truly do not want to hurt you.
you like your chances, do you?
uh, Lisbon?
you all right?
Yeah. Did you call Rigsby?
Yeah, he's on his way. Listen, I have an idea.
Lisbon, be careful!
drop it!
really drop it.
on your knees.
hands, come on. Let's go. Come on.
nice work, Jane.
I was hoping I'd find you here.
Yeah, we're, uh, we're just about to hit the road.
thank you.
it's okay.
you know, uh, eventually you'll start to remember the good things.
Yeah.
it goes without saying... - You're welcome.
you ready to go?
good-bye. - Bye.
Hey, can you believe he fell for that old cell phone gag?
old cell phone gag?
I invented that right there and then
rather brilliantly, I thought.
Oh, please. I've seen that done a dozen times.
what do you mean? Where?
on TV.
Oh, on TV. Well, anything can happen on TV.
the question is, where have you seen that done in real life?
that damn G. P. S. is gonna put it in California, I know it.
eh, think positive. It's Nevada.
definitely Nevada.
you're dreaming. We'll catch it.
a stone cold mystery.
forensics are already running the prints.
maybe we'll get a quick match we are never get that lucky no, we're gonna be talking to the hand for a long while.
why so glum?
a case is a case.
we're in the middle of nowhere.
it's windy as all hell. I haven't eaten anything.
Dismemberments are a bitch.
you spend months assembling the victim. There's always a piece missing.
there's already plenty to work with right here.
it's a right hand with a number 43 on it.
it's a male hand, or not very femme female.
what else have we got to work with right here without forensic analysis?
let's see.
probably a white man, mid 50s.
he wrote on his right hand, so he's a lefty.
well, maybe the killer wrote it--some kind of message.
too faded.
and a killer would write it bigger.
consultant.
smells of almond oil moisturizer, musky cologne and tobacco.
palms are supple.
nails are professionally maintained, so a rich man.
there's a faint tan line on the little finger from a missing pinkie ring,
which suggests an extrovert in a job where extroverts thrive.
so...
he's upper management in the hotel or gaming business.
total guess.
what do you want to bet I'm right?
35 cents.
35 cents? - Yeah.
I find that hard to believe, considering that huge crayon bank you've probably got hidden behind your bedroom door
that you've been filling with all the spare change that you could accumulate since you were what, 15?
35 cents, take it or leave it.
I'll take it. You got a bet. - All right.
I don't think it's right to bet on such things.
that's a human being that died.
no, it's okay. We're in Nevada.
here in California, yeah, it'd be wrong.
but here in Nevada, it's okay to gamble on body parts.
the hand's 3 feet into the state of California, so he's our baby.
hooray.
Yeah, hooray.
get our friend bagged and tagged. Let's get out of here.
do we have an I. D. , at least?
the prints say that it's James Quincy Meier.
he runs the Calida resort and casino.
thank you.
Meier Residence Calida. NV
are you certain that he isn't still out there alive?
Yes, forensics evidence supports the hand being severed postmortem.
the rest of his body?
we're looking.
it doesn't seem real.
when was the last time you saw your husband?
Yesterday--Tuesday morning.
Jim would often stay overnight at the resort if he need to be there late to resolve an issue,
or, you know, but he would call and let me know that he was
he was gonna stay so I wouldn't worry.
we understand that Mr. Meier didn't have a cell phone.
he didn't believe in them.
so was it him that called this house from a casino phone at, um, 8:05 Tuesday night?
Yes. He was just checking in.
casinos run 24 hours a day, so Jim did the same.
I think I saw Jim more than they did.
you work at the casino as well?
Dan is a V. I. P. Guest services executive.
I'm a glorified house player.
it's more than just that, Daniel.
what's a house player?
Jim pays me to herd the whales-- the big money gamblers.
I play with casino money to break the ice, get the heavy action going.
it's a good, steady gig.
keeps me out of trouble.
when was the last time you saw Jim?
same as Ann-- yesterday on the casino floor.
you dad knew Sinatra?
sure.
uh, Sinatra kissed me right here on my first birthday party.
that's what dad always said, anyhow.
but you didn't believe him?
figured there'd be a photo.
he wasn't around much when you were growing up, was he?
what makes you say that?
figured there'd be a photo.
he wasn't around a lot.
but he loved me. I know he did. He just...
he didn't have a whole lot of time.
the number 43 was written on Mr. Meier's hand.
any idea what the significance of that might be?
no idea. - Damn!
stupid son of a bitch went for the 2-point conversion.
excuse me.
get me a scotch, would you, hon?
can you think of anybody who might want to harm your husband?
Jim was a well-liked man, but he stuck to his principles,
and that's a dangerous thing to do in his business.
is there a specific instance you're thinking of?
no, no. It's just a feeling.
mom, it's a hotel/casino and not a crack house.
the mafia's not running anything anymore.
so you say.
robbery might have been a motive.
did he carry a lot of cash on him?
did he wear expensive jewelry?
no. He didn't need cash. Jim's word was money.
he wore a ring on his pinkie finger...
and a lucky $100, 000 chip on a string around his neck.
that's all.
that's a lot of money.
was the chip legal tender?
in the casino, yes, but only in the casino.
can you give us an exact description of the chip?
we want to alert the casino cashiers.
Yes. We have a photo of it for the insurance company.
I was going through all of the papers.
here it is. - Thank you.
any more body parts show up?
nothing so far.
possibly the hand was the only piece cut off.
does that match up to any similar cases in the past?
well, this is where it gets interesting.
there are several cases like this where a hand was purposely left to be found.
they're all Reno and Las Vegas-based and involved organized crime.
none are more recent than...
who get their hands caught in the till.
Mafia, great. Thanks.
agent Lisbon? Matt Etienne. I'm head of security.
this is agent Van Pelt and Mr. Jane from our team.
well, as you can imagine, we're all still pretty shell-shocked around here.
I'm sorry for your loss.
well, if you'll all follow me?
the casino's on the Nevada side of the resort and offers full-service gaming.
we recently spent $10 million upgrading the facilities to improve the customers' experience.
they use the same techniques in state-of-the-art animal husbandry to make the cows and sheep feel comfortable.
Really?
dim lights, soft music, a maze of passages that lead you back to the pens, or, in this case, the slots.
Ooh, don't hold back. Speak your mind.
there's no clocks or windows anywhere, so there's no passage of time.
low-priced alcohol is poured down you by attractive young women.
oxygen is pumped into the place to make you stay awake,
and the constant symphony of bells and sirens that make it seem like someone's winning all the time.
Ah, but someoneis always winning.
you see, our machines and our games are carefully designed to let every gambler have a taste of victory
just enough sugar to keep 'em pumping their money into the machines and onto the tables.
so what's your point?
Oh, no point. I love it.
who's that?
Cal trask-- a very serious gambler and an honored guest.
a whale?
exactly, a whale.
you guys are going to be going over a bunch of boring files now, I expect.
so, uh, I think I'll work here, play a little, get the lay of the land.
give me 100 bucks, would ya?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
sure you do. Come on. I'll give it back to you double.
look, here's $100, but you'll give me back double, right?
triple.
I'm Patrick.
Hi, Patrick.
I accessed Meier's calendar. The day he disappeared he listed an 8: 30 P. M. meeting with the notation "43," last meeting of the day.
there we go with the number 43 again.
see if you can cross-reference it with anything else. - Okay.
Matt? - Yes?
from what we understand, a hand being discovered like this is an old-school mafia signature.
Yes, I've heard the same thing.
it means an individual got caught with his hand in the till.
you don't seriously believe that that's what happened to jim?
don corleone had him whacked?
who owns this casino?
our owners are a million or so good american men and women who are shareholders in our parent company.
wise guys lost control of gambling in Nevada a long time ago.
hit me.
hit me.
well done, Patrick.
thank you. Could we change this up for $1, 000 chips, please?
thousand...
my name is Patrick.
Hi, Patrick.
Mr. Etienne, we have a possible code 9 at table 43.
what's a code 9?
cheating.
I'll be right there.
table 43?
blackjack - Oh, yeah!
keep squeezin' 'em, baby. Make 'em squeal!
come on, ladies.
Mr. Jane, may I have a word with you?
just a minute. - Jane.
I'm on a streak.
Yes, you are, and we're really wondering what your secret is.
there's no secret. I'm memorizing the cards.
Yes, well, Mr. Jane, we don't like people doing that.
is having a good memory illegal?
no, it's not.
all right. We can only congratulate you on your good luck and bar you from the establishment in the future.
Oh, okay.
well, that was fun while it lasted.
by the way, I hate to be a telltale, but Alexandra is robbing you blind.
excuse me?
she's cheating.
she's flashing her hidden card to the big guy on the end of the table,
and when that didn't work, she's dealing the rest of the table cards from
just underneath the top of the deck and holding back the top cards for him.
I think this is mine. Just one sec. Here, do you want to help me? Sorry. Thank you.
good luck. Good luck. Good luck.
Ah, the hustler returns.
lisbon says you won a whole bunch of money.
Oh, I didn't do too badly.
how much you win?
about $250, 000.
you won $250, 000?
Yeah.
are they talking to the dealer lady?
Yes.
very impressive scheme you set up with your cousin Mose
60% on anything under 5 grand, 50/50 on anything above.
you must be living pretty large.
if by "large" you mean saving up to buy my mom a new liver before she dies, then sure, living real large.
that big twerp told you all of that?
started singing like menudo the minute he sat down.
Oh, good help is so hard to find.
Meier was on to you.
that's what the meeting was for.
he probably fired you on the spot, didn't he?
it's pretty ballsy to come back in to work after something like that.
only someone who knew he'd been killed would do that.
I didn't kill him.
then how did you know before everyone else here that he was dead, Alexandra?
I didn't.
I came back to beg for my job.
when I heard what happened, I realized that no one knew about our meeting, so I went back to work.
I need this job.
losing your job, going to jail-- who's gonna look after your mom?
and that's a prospect that would make anyone upset.
and if you had a moment of insanity, I can understand that.
anyone can understand that.
I didn't kill him.
I wonder why Meier didn't talk to Etienne about her.
as head of security, she's ultimately his responsibility.
maybe he figured Etienne was in on it with her.
where did you go after your talk with Meier?
I spent the rest of the night at the hospital with my mother.
uh, sorry to interrupt.
uh, quick question-- when Meier asked you if Matt Etienne was involved in your Scam, what did you tell him?
I told him that Mr. Etienne had nothing to do with it.
but he does, doesn't he?
no.
Thanks. You can go.
she can? - She can?
she can go, can she?
I'm sorry.
the Nevada gaming commission's gonna want to charge her with gaming violations.
why should we let her go?
why do we get so hung up on every little law someone breaks?
because we're officers of the law?
also because Matt Etienne is lying.
now you can call him and tell him that alexandra yee cooperated with us, and based on what she had to say,
we'd like to speak to him first thing in the morning.
okay, but if he is in cahoots with Alexandra, he's just gonna call her and ask her what she said.
and she will swear blind she said nothing, which will make out friend Matt even more suspicious.
why did we let her go if she gave us nothing?
she must have told us the truth.
which is...
eh, details, details.
what is it?
open it.
it's not a fake turd or anything.
van Pelt, catch.
what is this?
carbon placed under extreme pressure.
we can't keep this stuff.
we can't?
it's against regulations.
no, it's not. Why would it be?
I won the money fair and square, and I spent it fair and square.
where do the regulations come into it?
so where's our stuff?
your stuff?
well, you didn't just get stuff for the ladies. That'd be creepy.
who's your daddy?
Thanks, man. - Thanks.
now it must be worth a lot of money, because this is the ugliest watch I've ever seen.
it's horrible.
I asked for the most expensive watches they had.
Thanks, man.
all right, let's go.
I got us a table booked at the best restaurant in town.
apparently, they tell you the name of the cow your steak came from.
that's horrible.
forget the steaks. We're on a case.
we can't be seen living it up in fancy restaurants.
good point. Uh, okay.
little place on the way back to Calida. Let's go.
so you really won all of this by memorizing cards?
you didn't have cards up your sleeve or anything?
no. That would be cheating. Just memory.
how? That's impossible.
not at all. Anyone can do it. I'm gonna raise you three.
how?
in my mind, i've made every card in the deck into a vivid character.
Jack of hearts--a ballet dancer with devil's horns.
2 of diamonds-- a duck smoking a cigar. Like that.
why a duck?
doesn't matter.
every card is a living thing.
every position in the deck is a location in my memory palace.
okay, what's a memory palace?
it's a place that is so clear in your mind that you can walk all around it in your head.
everybody's palace is different.
has to be big and detailed and vivid.
my palace is a midwest carnival circuit I used to travel with my father.
your people are carny folk.
you're finally starting to make sense to me.
not exactly.
it's a long story.
my point--if the tenth card in the deck is a jack of hearts,
I see a devil-horned dancer at the Joplin, Missouri, fairgrounds.
I'll see you.
excuse me.
I can't see how that works.
here. Shuffle these.
Rigsby's holding 2 pair-- 6s and 9s.
Cho--my old friend cho here-- is hoping for his fifth spade to make up his flush.
deal the river card and watch him get it.
too hot for me.
another hand?
Nah. Kind of takes the fun out of it when you're playing with a swami.
all right, guys, it's been fun playing dress-up, but playtime's over.
sorry, boss, what do you mean?
this. It's kind of a waste, don't you think?
well, I would have bought world peace if I could.
they didn't have it at the casino gift store.
very limited range of items for sale.
you know what I mean.
I know those emeralds look lovely with your eyes.
thank you. It's beautiful, but I can't keep it.
I understand.
Yeah, you're right.
good night.
I'm not giving mine back. - No way.
that's my boys. Live it up.
clothes SHOES
Hey, Lisbon.
where are you?
Oh, just taking a walk.
Ann wants to come clean.
I knew it.
she had that air about her.
if you knew it, why didn't you tell us?
it's an exaggeration. I had a strong hunch.
if I told you about every hunch, you'd get very irritated.
Matt Etienne tells me that, uh, one of his employees may have shared rumors about him and me.
I wanted to be the first to clarify the matter for you,
and I wanted Jessica and Daniel to be here so that you understand there's no subterfuge here.
okay.
Yes, I was having an affair with matt Etienne.
but I didn't murder Jim.
you knew about the affair?
Yeah.
I knew about it, but I didn't like it.
but I understood, because dad was never there for mom...
or me.
so no subterfuge, except for Jim.
I'm not proud of it.
Matt was there for mom when dad wasn't.
how long had the affair been going on?
do you think that Matt did this to clear the field with you?
no. No.
maybe he had the idea that that's what you wanted him to do.
no. You have no right to say such things.
cause my mother is not some sort of-- - Hey. Hush.
I betrayed my husband.
I lied to him.
but I loved him, and I did not wish him dead.
ask Matt and he'll tell you the same thing.
we will.
Thanks.
uh, listen, uh...
I don't want agent Lisbon to hear about this.
she doesn't really approve of my gambling.
no? - No.
I was hoping that maybe you could set me up in a good, high-stakes game of poker.
you know, with someone like Cal Trask, you know, a whale.
I heard about your hot hands on the casino floor.
Yeah, I'm feelin' lucky.
I can set you up, sure.
appreciate it. All right.
mum's the word.
I'm guessing that you're not just in the neighborhood.
Mr. Etienne, I have a warrant to search your property.
that's a sweet boat.
you let that dealer, Alexandra Yee, run her scam because she knew about you and Mrs. Meier.
isn't that so?
and she threatened to tell Mr. Meier if you fired her.
that's about the size of it, yeah.
why didn't you tell us you were involved with Mrs. Meier from the start?
we were bound to find out.
because it's not pertinent.
Jim knew that Ann was out of their relationship a long time ago.
the two of them came to an understanding.
he was married to his job.
so what me and Ann have between us, it's nobody's business but our own.
been doing a little work on the place?
no.
look at this.
you see, the footprints going that way are deeper than the footprints coming this way.
yeah?
which means that someone carried something heavy into your garage, but they didn't bring it out.
look at you. You got some stuff.
that is nice.
let's start at 8: 00 p. m. the night Jim Meier was murdered and stuffed in your fridge.
I called Ann from the casino at around 8: 00 p. m.
when I saw that Jim's car was still parked at the resort.
now that normally meant that he was staying the night, so we agreed to meet at 12: 30 that night.
but you left work at 11: 00 p. m. What did you do with the 90 minutes?
I went home, changed clothes and just relaxed a while.
Calida's a small town.
there was plenty of time for you and Ann to bash his head in,
dump the hand and hide the body before going to your hideaway.
I never meet Ann at my house.
that's very delicate of you.
we always met at the piney branch motel.
it's on route 6.
that's where we were that night.
the M. E. Says Jim was killed sometime between the hours of 10: 00 p. m. And 1: 00 a. m.
that's right in the sweet spot of your free time.
I didn't kill him.
was she giving you half of his estate if you made him disappear?
I have my own money. I don't need any of Jim's.
but you need his wife.
it's not like that.
it's exactly like that.
you wanted Jim's life, so you took it out from under him.
look, the last time I saw Jim, he was watching his whale tapes.
he gets all of his surveillance footage on dvds, and he watches it night and day,
trying to figure out what makes them tick, keep 'em on the hook.
Jim was obsessed with the casino.
that's what he loved, not Ann.
he didn't care what she did.
Lisbon, we got the autopsy report back on Meier.
died of blunt force trauma to the head.
apparently, he was hit several times with a heavy cylindrical object like a pipe or a bat.
there were also abrasions around his neck like something was ripped off--his $100, 000 poker chip, I assume.
check the Piney Branch Motel.
see if Ann Meier and Matt Etienne were there when he said they were.
okay.
Rigsby, Jim Meier was spying on his guests, kept all the footage on DVD.
maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.
go to his office and see if you can locate the footage.
Yes, boss.
and check up on Jane.
thank you, darlin'.
gentlemen, this is my friend Patrick Jane,
come to play some cards with us tonight if everyone's agreeable.
good to see you. Want a sandwich?
Hey, Freddy, bring over some sandwiches.
kiss my ass.
sit down. Sit down.
you want to play, too, Danny boy?
thought I might.
how you feeling, goldilocks? Feeling lucky?
I'm sorry. Are we here to share our feelings or to play cards?
boom! Watch out, Freddy.
anything over there?
I got nada.
we're gonna have to go through these books.
who are you calling?
aces and 3s.
flush wins.
new girlfriend.
ask him how much he's winning.
not the best timing.
just deal me out of this next hand, please.
Oh, we'll wait.
what are you doing?
harpooning a whale. Talk fast.
Yeah, we're in Meier's work office.
he was watching a surveillance DVD the night he died.
we think it might be in a book, but there's about 500 books.
are they in any kind of order?
Yeah, there's a lot of military history, gaming theory, reference section.
try the bible or "robert's rules of order."
okay, thanks.
Hey, how much have you... He didn't say.
sorry about that. Nice win.
women. - Yeah, women.
$1, 000 to you, sir.
I don't care what he says. That man is psychic. - Right.
room 706. That's Cal Trask's suite.
I see her. Working girl.
she looks familiar, though.
why, that's Jessica Meier, isn't it?
the victim's daughter?
dressed for a party.
there's no cake or balloons.
here's you arriving at Trask's hotel suite at 1: 30 in the morning.
and here's you leaving 45 minutes later.
care to comment on that? - No.
where did you get this?
from the way you're dressed, it appears that some sort of sexual transaction took place.
okay, I was guessing. What did take place?
nothing.
we looked into your financial situation. It's bad.
you and your husband are swimming in credit card debt.
you've refinanced your house three times in the past two years.
you even had a car repossessed.
we hit a rough patch.
Why? Where'd the money go?
Daniel is a professional gambler.
he has his ups and downs, you know, as in any business.
Jessica, your father was watching this video the night he died.
Oh, my god.
what does that make you think?
I don't know.
makes me think this video had something to do with his death.
all in.
call.
call.
three 8s.
full house.
damn.
trip 9s. Full house wins.
sorry, Cal.
you got me, kid.
guess so.
one win each.
you and me are gonna have to play a decider.
sure thing.
good night, Freddy.
man, we took him for a lot of money.
Yes, we did.
I took most of it, but you didn't do too bad.
horse pucky, dude. It was me, skinned him.
whatever, kid.
let's go. Ads-up.
Oh, no, no. Rain check for me.
what's the matter, my friend? You scared?
open up a fresh pack, nancy, would you?
Cal Trask? We're C. B. I. Agents.
good for you.
we're investigating the murder of James Meier.
we'd like to ask you a few questions.
ask 'em quick. I've been up for 48 hours. I just lost $180, 000.
I need to brush my teeth and go to bed.
Jim was spying on me?
on all his V. I. P. Guests, 24/7.
this is what he was watching the night he died.
son of a bitch.
explain for us the nature of your relationship with Jessica Meier-Cardeira.
it's a large question. Hard to say.
okay. More specifically, why did she come to your room in the middle of the night dressed like a hooker?
think I'll hold my peace on that.
if she has something she wants to tell you, she will, I guess.
we're thinking maybe Jim was peeved, maybe came to have a word with you about screwing his only daughter.
maybe things escalated, and maybe you got in a fight.
accidents happen.
your thinking is wrong.
you can see how it looks, though.
okay. Stop the train. I'll get off here.
night before this happened, I was playing a table stakes game with Daniel, her husband.
man's a degenerate gambler. Degenerate.
anyway, I cleaned him out, but he wouldn't quit.
wants to keep playing, but he's got no collateral, and I don't trust him for an I. O. U.
so he says he'll put up his wife against 50 grand...
the sexual favors of his wife.
as collateral on a poker game? - Yep.
so I said sure.
I mean, action's action, and Jessica Meier is a nice piece of pie.
she's very attractive.
Yeah. Anyway, Daniel and I play again.
naturally, I beat him again. He backed his word. I'll give him that.
he said he was gonna send her over to my room the next night, and he did.
the man's a second-rate card player, but he knows how to control his womenfolk.
she came to your room, and then what?
I took what was owed me.
you had sexual intercourse with her?
Yeah. - How did she feel about that?
not super enthusiastic. Willing...
100%willing...
but not happy.
Hey, a bet's a bet, right?
so I have to win this hand to stay in, huh?
uh, I guess you do.
check.
call.
excuse me.
I'll take one.
two. Thank you.
that good, huh?
that good.
that good.
I can't lose.
well, it's a shame you got diddly-squat to bet with.
what's the bet, kid?
I forgot.
the bet, my friend, is $105, 000.
you should trust me when I tell you things.
I told you I couldn't lose.
four kings. Booyah!
that's pretty.
not as pretty as this.
straight flush. - No.
Yes.
that's impossible. - His pot.
that's my pot.
look at this.
I see you. Yes, I do.
whatever, man.
later.
not much later. - Let's go.
tell us, how did you end up with Jim Meier's lucky poker chip?
that night, as I was leavin', Jim followed me to the parking lot.
he'd seen this tape with Jessica and Cal, and he knew I must have something to do with it.
I said, sure I did.
screw him.
like he was such a great husband and father, you know?
he called me a degenerate low-life pimp, fired me then and there,
and he said he'd do everything in his power to get me out of Jessica's life.
I couldn't let that happen.
I remembered the stories they told in the room about the mafia hit men leaving a hand behind as a message, you know?
I did it to make 'em think it was mob-related.
I dumped the body at Matt's, 'cause I knew his affair with Ann would come to light.
did your wife have anything to do with this?
no. No. She had nothing to do with this.
and the idiot never suspected it was me.
how's that for Denial?
how did you know it was me?
well, when we first met, you were more concerned about the college football scores - than you were your father-in-law's murder. - So?
so when you're searching for a killer, the degenerate gambler in the room is a good person to look at.
I'm not a degenerate. I'm a professional.
just having a streak of bad luck.
Yes, you are.
let's go.
that last hand-- how did you do that?
stand up. Put your hands behind your head.
Oh, uh, I cheated.
but how?
next time we play, I'll show you.
it's okay, baby. It's gonna be okay.
I believe this is yours.
thank you.
your father died protecting you.
so in the end, he...
he was there for you.
thank you.
be good to yourself.
you, too.
this way, ladies.
we were wondering how much money you won in that game.
Oh, I don't know. $300, 000, something like that.
so where is it-- the money?
I spent it.
on what?
you know, stuff.
a really cute blonde guy left this for you at the front desk.
Oh, my god!
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental Acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of Thoughts and behavior.
go! Go!
get down on the floor! Get down on the floor now!
one Year Later
thank you for coming.
you said you had information about Red John.
Yes, I do.
he killed your wife and daughter, huh?
I've heard a lot about you.
they say you can tell when people are lying.
do you have information about Red John?
I have dynamite information about Red John.
enough to catch him.
how do you come by this information?
red John is a friend of a friend of mine.
is that friend of yours in prison, too?
I have friends from all walks of life.
tell me.
I am currently doing 25 years to life for a crime I didn't commit.
my last appeal just failed.
you get me out of here, and I will give you Red John.
you raped and murdered your family housekeeper's daughter.
if you do know a lot about me, you know that I'm not a real magician.
I didn't do it.
I read the case file...
the physical evidence, the testimonies of all the witnesses,
including your own family, says you did.
I didn't kill her.
what happened?
I don't know.
we were partying.
I did some blow, some meth. We had sex. I fell asleep.
then it's morning. Undine's dead.
the cops are busting in...
the door was locked from the inside.
there were bars on the windows. - Yes.
how is it physically possible that anyone else could've committed the murder?
I don't know, but I didn't.
ergo, someone else did.
someone you can find.
you see me. Am I lying?
you seem to be telling the truth,
but you're a very clever, unprincipled narcissist In a desperate corner.
even if you are innocent, it doesn't mean you have information on Red John.
Yeah, it's a tough call.
I'm gonna have to say no.
your wife... Red John painted her toenails. Yes.
painted them with her own blood...
the police didn't make that public, did they?
she's the only instance he did that, huh?
a touch of elegance for you alone.
how do you know that?
I told you, Red John is a friend of a friend of mine.
what is this friend's name?
his name is "get me out of here and I'll tell you.
that and much more."
okay.
no. I said no, and I mean no.
it's not that I don't want to help you. I want to help you.
it's just... It's not physically possible.
Jared Renfrew was tried and convicted. It's a closed case.
I have no authority to reopen it without cause.
there is cause. - For you, there's cause.
not for the state of California.
we can't touch it.
Ah, but we could touch it if... - Closed case. Nothing to be done.
the justice department doesn't go about...
undoing its own work.
I understand. No problem.
if we can't touch it, we can't touch it.
I'm sorry. - No.
the law's the law.
my desire for revenge doesn't outweigh the rules.
I have to accept that.
I'm glad you understand. - Thanks for your time.
he's lying through his teeth, isn't he?
Yes.
I know better than to try and stop you from doing what you think you have to do.
no, I - I'm fine about it.
I can see Minelli's point.
I can't be chasing every nutbag with a good story, can I?
Yeah. Sure, you're fine with it.
just do me the favor of listening to me for a minute, so I can say "I told you so" later.
sure.
Jared Renfrew was found hugging the corpse of Undine Kopecki In a room locked from the inside,
holding a bloody butcher knife in his hand.
his semen was inside of her.
he had been stalking her for weeks.
he's got a history of violence going back 15 years.
what's your point?
he's guilty. You're being conned.
possible, but I don't think so.
I gotta find out one way or the other.
even if he's telling the truth about the murder, he could still be lying about Red John.
also possible.
but I gotta take the chance. What else can I do?
Minelli wants me to keep a watch on you.
what are you gonna do? - I'm not gonna follow you around.
let's compromise.
when you get into trouble, call me first so I can try and minimize the damage.
deal.
and don't use your CBI card.
if the bureau finds out you used it without authorization, you're done.
I hear you.
Hello?
my name's Patrick Jane.
I'd like to speak to Gardner Renfrew about his brother Jared.
one moment, please.
Mr. Renfrew says, "No, thank you."
tell Mr. Renfrew I can prove his brother is innocent,
and I know who really committed the murder.
thank you very much.
is that your father?
Yes.
what's this all about, Mr. Jane?
who are you, and what do you mean by this?
do you think your brother is innocent?
you said you could prove he's innocent. You said you know who really did it.
no. Just... That was just to get inside the house.
I have no idea who might have done it.
it might've been Jared. Um, I hope not.
he seems to be telling the truth. What do you think?
I think you had better leave right now, Mr. Jane.
I don't have the... the time or the patience for tomfoolery.
so you think he's guilty? I'm wasting my time.
we're done talking.
suppose I could prove he was innocent. Wouldn't you want that?
wouldn't you want that blot on your name expunged?
of course he would.
nothing would make me happier, but my brother's guilty.
he violated that poor girl. He violated this house. He violated this family.
that's all I needed to know.
thank you for your time.
your, uh, mother lives here in the guesthouse, doesn't she?
you leave my mother alone.
well, that's not your call to make, is it?
Breck, call the police.
be sure and tell 'em I'm unarmed.
go inside, mother! Go inside!
my name's Patrick Jane. I want to speak to you about your son Jared.
I'll deal with him, mother. The police are on their way. Just go inside.
don't order me about, and don't be so hysterical.
what's your interest in Jared?
I'm a friend of his, trying to prove his innocence.
come and sit down. - Thank you.
mother, you're being childish.
go away, Gardner.
mother! - Go away!
tell me why you wish to prove my son's innocence.
Oh, I can promise you I'm not up to anything sinister, ma'am.
my motives are pure.
tell me about Jared.
he was a troubled child, charming and bright, but a bully and a liar.
something of a sadist.
qualities you rather liked in him, I expect.
Yes, I did.
I found him rather amusing... At first.
one doesn't want a wimp for a son.
but there must be a sense of proportion and moderation.
as he got older, he got worse.
got in with bad people.
it was one scandal after another. In and out of prison. A common criminal.
but he turned himself around, didn't he?
he gave up the drink and the drugs and the gallivanting,
made peace with his brother and came home to help run the family businesses.
the prodigal son. - Yes.
George, his father, was overjoyed.
I was skeptical.
pleased, of course, but skeptical.
as my mother always said, "You are what you are."
I guess she's right. - Yes.
poor George dropped dead a week after the murder.
broke his heart, people said.
george didn't really have a heart, in that sense.
he died of embarrassment.
a Renfrew in the pokey for murder.
can you show me where it happened?
who else was in the house?
I had a small dinner party, probably ten people all told.
after they left, it was just family...
Gardner and Breck, George and I And Jared, of course.
not Mariska the housekeeper?
no, she lived out.
Undine was only here to help the cook with the dinner party.
she was a lovely girl, full of life and promise.
her mother and Mariska had been with us 20 years...
part of the family.
Jared told me that he and Undine were having an affair,
that he loved her and he'd never hurt her.
she told her mother that he was stalking her, that she was scared of him.
she didn't go to the police out of respect for the family.
I'd like to speak to her.
she left our employ, I'm afraid.
it was too difficult, for both of us.
where is she now?
I have an address somewhere.
can you get it for me now?
as you wish. - Thank you.
sir, would you come with us? - Why?
you're trespassing here. - No, I'm not.
okay, sir, this man here says he's the homeowner
and says you're trespassing, so let's go, partner.
officer, it's the other way around. I'm the homeowner.
that man is the intruder. - Well, that's a lie! He...he's lying!
listen to the madness in his voice.
will you please take him somewhere he can get some help?
here you are. I don't know that she'll still be there, but...
thank you so much.
for heaven's sake, Gardner. Policemen?
how ridiculous. Send them away.
ma'am, this man here is... - Yes, yes, it's quite all right, officer.
you can go.
Thanks.
well, good-bye, Mrs. Renfrew.
I expect we'll speak again soon.
good day to you.
Gardner Renfrew is a player in this town.
you can't go to his house and screw around with him.
why not? It's a free country.
I didn't use my I. D. I didn't even mention the CBI.
you gave your real name. - It's my name.
Yeah, well, you should've lied as you so often do,
because now I have to give you an official reprimand
and order you in the strongest possible terms to leave the Renfrew family alone - And...and drop the matter. - Sorry, can't do that.
you have to. This is straight from the A. G. 's office.
Jared Renfrew didn't kill Undine Kopecki.
do you have evidence of that? - Not yet.
I have pieces... That I'm piecing together.
he's innocent.
wake up, Dorothy. You're not in Kansas anymore.
there are innocent men in jail. It happens.
is he one of them? I don't know. I doubt it.
in any case, we can't reopen his case.
if I'm Dorothy, then who are you?
it doesn't matter who I am.
we will find other ways of making Renfrew talk to you.
there is a lot that can be done to make a prisoner's life easier If he cooperates.
it's not gonna work. He's innocent.
okay, here it is.
if you pursue this any further, I'm gonna have to throw you out of the CBI.
we can't take the liability.
I very much do not want to have to do that.
I know you don't.
so, uh... Well, I'll spare you the trouble. I quit.
don't do that. - Oh, it's okay. It's best this way.
you are the good witch Glinda, obviously.
thank you.
I learned a lot.
CBI HQ Sacramento, CA
don't bother, I know. I feel the same way. Nothing to be done.
so now when he really needs our help, we're letting him down.
I wanna help him just as much as you do.
our orders state that we must stay away from this case.
I don't care what our orders say. It's not right.
we closed cases before he came.
we'll close cases after he's gone.
Yeah, just not so many.
the cases are not the point. It's not that we need him. He needs us.
Yeah, he needs us on a fool's errand. Renfrew's a con man.
he doesn't know anything about Red John.
suppose we found a connection between Renfrew and Red John.
it would... Wait.
what's in the file? Let me guess...
a connection between Renfrew and Red John?
seven years ago, Renfrew was serving time on a narcotics conviction.
he shared a cell in Lompoc with a man by the name of Orval Tanner.
Tanner claimed in his 1998 trial for murder that he had only been an accomplice,
that the real killer was a man by the name of Red John.
nobody believed him.
98. That's the beginning of Red John's career.
Where's tanner now?
he died of heart disease in a prison hospital.
of course, our luck. - It's a connection.
slim. Likely, nobody believed him for a reason.
but it's a connection.
okay.
check out Tanner's background, find the autopsy reports,
see if there's any credibility to his story.
I mean, obviously, we can't do that,
but that's what I would tell you to do If we weren't ordered to stay away from this case.
okay, then let me speak to the assistant to the deputy records officer.
why do people say "eureka" when they do something good?
it's, uh, Greek for "bingo."
well, so... Eureka.
I found the autopsy reports, and they back up Orval Tanner's story.
the body of the alleged victim... Cut up, Red John style.
which means Renfrew's telling some kind of truth about his Red John connection.
Yep.
van Pelt. What's that you're working on?
sir, I asked her to... - I'm talking to Van Pelt.
sir... I'm doing research for Jane. No excuses, sir.
you, too, I suppose.
Hey, boss.
I gave this unit a direct, written order, and they have flagrantly disobeyed that order.
did they do that with your knowledge?
I ordered them to do it.
I told them you countermanded your earlier order.
they had no knowledge whatsoever that they were doing anything irregular.
nice try, mother Teresa. They already gave themselves up.
we never said a word...
I stand by my story.
they didn't know they were out of line.
sir, the opposite is true. We forced agent Lisbon to let us do this.
very touching.
my ex-wife would love this scene in a movie.
I'm giving you all formal notice.
any further infractions will result in immediate suspension.
sir, you might as well suspend me now, because there will be further infractions.
Jane needs our help, and he's gonna get it.
I'm not gonna lay off because some fat cat's putting on the pressure.
me, too. - And me.
moving, eloquent, two thumbs up.
you shall have your wish. You're all suspended,
starting right now, for gross insubordination.
I'm sorry.
Lisbon. Still here?
uh, that was more of a rhetorical stand we were taking back there.
you take it back then.
well, no, but I wanted to talk to...
this... The, um, The suspension paperwork right here.
look...
I have to go and visit my sister in Hawaii for a week. She's sick.
meanwhile, this paperwork is gonna sit on my desk for a week, is that clear?
one week. - Yes, sir.
yes... - Thank you.
be very grateful. Do not contact me. I do not want to know anything.
and please do not dig the hole that you are standing in any deeper than you have already dug it.
no, sir.
that hole is the grave of your very promising career.
you should put a flashlight underneath your chin just to complete the effect.
I'm not kidding. - I know.
Hey, Lisbon.
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Uh, just, uh...
out investigating stuff.
sure. Yeah, uh...
pepperoni or plain?
okay.
uh, hey, Lisbon...
thank you.
Renfrew couldn't dispute the physical evidence.
the core of his defense was that he loved Undine deeply and he would never hurt her.
Undine's mother testified that was a lie.
I went to go speak with her, but she moved, left no forwarding address.
Mariska Kopecki, right? - Yeah.
how does the brother look?
he had motive. There's a moral turpitude clause in the family trust.
once convicted, all Jared's shares in the family business went to Gardner.
but he would've also got the shares if Jared had died.
so why not just kill Jared? Why kill Undine?
exactly. Why kill Undine?
he wanted to see Jared suffer maybe or had a thing for Undine himself.
Eureka.
I input Mariska Kopecki into the secure search engine.
I get an I. M. link to a health care database that documents Mariska Kopecki's notification
that she's changing her name to Vanna Clooney.
I input the new name and get a hit.
four months ago, someone named V. K. Clooney bought a condo in Marin.
nice work.
Yeah, weird thing, though -- the original I. M. came from a civilian.
a Dr. Joe in New Hampshire.
he couldn't have been logged on to the D. O. J. secure network.
so how did he know what I was asking about?
and how did he have access to the health care database? Nobody's allowed to do that.
when you say "Dr. Joe in New Hampshire," do you mean d-r-j-o-e-n-h...
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
ask, "Who are you?"
is Jane there?
Yes.
this is Jane.
keep up the good work.
Why?
I. M. source locator
he's gone.
what the hell was that about?
he somehow tapped into the D. O. J. secure network.
he's been spying on us.
can we find the source of the I. M?
there's a self-destruct code built into the uplink.
it dead-ends at the secondary server.
there's no way to trace it back.
he wants us to succeed.
he wants Renfrew out of jail.
out where he can get at him -- to silence him.
Yes. Which means Renfrew is telling the truth.
which means he has the goods on Red John.
slow down. We don't have anything yet.
Yes, we still have to get Renfrew out of jail first.
Oh, that's all.
and we will, and then Red John will go after him.
he has to break cover. He has to.
damn.
how are you gonna get us in there without your magic badge?
you do the talking. - No, you try.
don't be childish. I'm not
Oh, I thought it was Harry. Who are you?
Vanna Clooney? - Yes.
I'm Teresa, and this is Patrick. - Yes.
can -- can we come in for a moment?
what do you want?
it's to do with Harry. - What about him?
well, it's best not to speak out here in public.
okay, I lied just now.
we're here to talk about your daughter Undine.
get out. - Sit down.
who are you?
listen to me, or your guilt and pain and shame won't ever go away.
it won't go away until you tell the truth.
what truth? What, are you crazy?
you don't know me. You don't know what I feel.
I do know you.
when you first came to this country as a young woman, you dreamed of such great things,
what a life you'd have.
and what did fate bring you?
25 years of drudgery, a servant's life.
you hated every day of it.
who wants to be a servant? Nobody.
you did it for her, for Undine, so that she would have a better life.
Yes. - And then she was gone, taken from you.
in a flash, your whole life
all those days of drudgery and humiliation -- wasted.
what a joke, huh?
Yes. A joke.
what do you want from me?
I want to know who killed her.
what's it matter who killed her? She's gone.
well, you didn't say Jared. That would be the obvious answer.
okay. Jared killed her. I don't care.
it's true.
there's nothing you can do that will bring her back.
so if you get paid to lie about what happened, then, uh, where's the harm?
what paid? Nobody paid me anything.
don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.
you took your 20 pieces of silver and bought the life you always wanted, didn't you?
no. - It's what you always wanted. It means nothing.
look at me, Mariska. Look at me, and tell me I'm wrong.
you think you know everything! You know nothing!
I know that Jared and Undine were lovers, weren't they?
and you were paid to say that they weren't.
say it out loud.
Yes. They were lovers.
who paid you to say that they weren't?
I don't know.
a what you call a... a private investigator.
he came to me, and he offered me a lot of money.
a lot of money! But I said no.
he offered more.
I took it. - What was his name?
okay, Cho, thank you.
Samsa's dead. - What?
hit by a bus. - Damn.
we could get a court order for his records.
remember, you're on suspension.
if we don't get this closed up before Minelli gets back, we're done.
plan "b" then. - What's plan "b"?
well, you're not gonna like it.
we need to speak with your husband, ma'am.
who's the agent in charge here?
I'm agent Lisbon. This is agent Rigsby.
and I believe you've met my colleague Patrick Jane.
hello.
I expect you're wondering why I gathered you all here?
Breck, go call the police. - Uh, Mr. Renfrew, wait.
unless you want your family ruined In a deluge of sordid scandal,
you might want to listen to me.
what are you talking about?
someone, I don't know who, paid Mariska Kopecki a lot of money to lie about Jared and Undine.
they were lovers, as your brother said.
so what? The fact is, they were found in a locked room.
it's not physically possible for someone to have gotten into the room to commit the murder.
Yes, there's the rub. The key was in the door.
watch closely.
would you please go inside and lock the door?
suppose Jared and Undine are inside sleeping.
it's all very clever, but how do you get out again?
can I borrow your lighter, please?
thank you.
and that is how Jared was framed. Cool, huh?
it doesn't mean Jared's innocent.
and it certainly doesn't mean someone else is guilty.
it's a party trick.
a party trick a jury will love.
put that together with Mariska's testimony,
and I think we have a pretty good chance of winning a new trial.
then the truth will come out somehow. Unless...
unless what?
unless we can make some kind of financial deal here
that would make it worth our while dropping all this.
you want money? You're blackmailing us.
eh, we call it leverage. - But you're state agents.
ex-State agents. Thanks to your son here,
Jane was tossed out, and we're going with him.
we need to look after ourselves now.
we won't be unreasonable.
you people are a disgrace. Get out.
Oh, we're going.
we'll give you until 4: 00 to call us with an offer.
after that, we're gonna make some calls of our own.
I'll tell you who I'm calling. I'm calling the FBI!
am I wrong, or did that go down not quite as you'd hoped?
I've had better responses, but I think we made a sale.
you never can tell. - We're doomed.
patience.
patience.
patience.
if you say "patience" one more time...
Hello?
I'll be right there.
who was it?
I confess, I thought it'd be Gardner who called me.
Gardner? He hasn't the gumption.
I will not see our family name dragged through the mud again.
how much do you want to keep quiet?
how much did you give Mariska?
I don't say I paid her anything.
you needn't be evasive.
only a guilty person would respond this way to such naked extortion.
I know you're guilty.
I'm just not sure why.
your suspicions are neither here nor there.
I asked you your price.
your late husband was a handsome man.
Yes, he was. What's that got to do with it?
domineering, though. Had to have things his way.
he died how long after the murder?
a week. Aortic aneurysm.
and Mariska-- she left your employ when?
at the same time.
after he died, though.
Yes.
may I? Thank you.
so you got rid of her as soon as you could after he died,
because Undine was your husband's child, wasn't she?
Yes.
and you never confronted him or Mariska? - No.
I decided I liked my life as it was.
I didn't want a drama, and I didn't want to be lied to.
they never knew I suspected.
18 years of secret anger.
how did you stand it?
nobody's life is perfect.
and then when you found out about Undine and Jared's affair, you must've been enraged.
it's practically incest.
it is. It is incest.
when I found out, I - I told Jared that he was not to continue the affair.
he refused...
said he was in love with her.
he refused to stop seeing her.
didn't you tell him why you objected?
certainly not.
I couldn't tell him.
it was too sordid, too humiliating.
instead, you killed Undine, paid off her mother and sent your son to jail for life.
no. I wouldn't do that.
Undine's blood.
it's proof... I did it.
I took it so I could confess and get Jared freed when I chose.
just as soon as he learned his lesson. - What lesson?
everything in moderation. And...
listen to your mother. - Can't argue with that.
two Week Later - good? - Yep.
okay.
we're ready to go get Renfrew.
is the safe house all set up? - Yeah.
good. I guess I'll see you over there later.
Jane, please be careful.
remember, this is playing out just like Red John wants it to.
this is playing out just like it has to.
he has no choice but to try and silence Renfrew.
he has to show himself.
we're getting close. I can feel it.
you can feel it. Like a psychic thing? - No.
I am quietly confident that we will get a bite.
you think you're playing him, and he thinks he's playing you.
one of you is wrong.
thank you.
thank you.
I kept my side of the bargain. Now it's your turn.
tell what you know. - Absolutely.
all will be revealed. But here?
give me a chance to catch a breath of fresh air,
and then we will sit and talk as long as you like.
and I got a lot to tell. And I owe you... big-time.
I owe you my life.
in the meantime, uh, I would kill for a cheeseburger and fries.
drive-through. - Put this on.
can't you say "please"? I'm a free man now.
put this on... please. - Sure.
meat IS MURDER
fur IS EVIL
what is this?
damn it!
he vanished five hours ago, and we've heard nothing from him since.
the town was on pretty good lockdown,
so we're guessing he had friends get him out of the area fast.
planted in advance, probably.
would you stop that? It's not your fault.
well, whose fault is it then? It's mine. I have to accept that.
Ah, actually, it's -- it's my fault.
okay, everyone? My fault.
what's done is done. Focus on now.
we need to get to Renfrew before Red John does.
where is he now? Who are his friends? What are his options?
Hello? - Mr. Jane.
I just wanted to call and apologize for letting you down.
Hello, Jared.
it was dishonorable, I know, but crossing Red John just... seems too dangerous.
you've already crossed him. You need our protection.
I haven't given you a thing.
how is he to know that? - Oh, he'll know. He'll know.
like I said, I have friends, and they'll put in a good word for me.
friends? What friends? Who?
uh, wouldn't you like to know?
Jared, listen to me. You can't trust them. They're not your friends.
damn fool. Red john probably already has his location.
did you trace the line? - Yes, I'm tracking the call now.
he's in Tijuana, Mexi, in a motel room with a hooker.
because?
he wouldn't call if he didn't think he was out of our reach.
I could hear Latin music and sirens and horns and a whole neighborhood in the background,
which suggests thin walls and a city.
hence, Tijuana Motel room. - And the hooker?
he needs to use somebody's phone, and he has been in prison for a year. Hence, the hooker.
the phone belongs to Juana Porfiria Braga...
calle Rojas 65, Tijuana, Mexico.
five arrests on prostitution charges.
let me get a location on the call.
I'll go reach out to the federal police in Tijuana.
you boys come with me. - Yes, sir.
go ahead. Say it.
say what? - You told me. You warned me.
you get the privilege of saying, "I told you so."
that's all right. Not now. This isn't over yet.
we're gonna find Renfrew, and he's gonna tell us what he knows.
got it. Motel Carona Del Norte.
he is...
well, you can say it now.
well, I don't really feel like saying it.
let me take a rain check on that. - Sure.
what do you think it means?
it means Red John is far more powerful than I ever thought.
he's been way ahead of me this whole time.
I mean the writing on the wall.
I have no idea.
it's a good clue, though, isn't it?
Jared was trying to tell us something important.
maybe.
next time, We'll get him.
next time.
Hello?
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental Acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of Thoughts and behavior.
go! Go!
get down on the floor! Get down on the floor now!
one Year Later
thank you for coming.
you said you had information about Red John.
Yes, I do.
he killed your wife and daughter, huh?
I've heard a lot about you.
they say you can tell when people are lying.
do you have information about Red John?
I have dynamite information about Red John.
enough to catch him.
how do you come by this information?
red John is a friend of a friend of mine.
is that friend of yours in prison, too?
I have friends from all walks of life.
tell me.
I am currently doing 25 years to life for a crime I didn't commit.
my last appeal just failed.
you get me out of here, and I will give you Red John.
you raped and murdered your family housekeeper's daughter.
if you do know a lot about me, you know that I'm not a real magician.
I didn't do it.
I read the case file...
the physical evidence, the testimonies of all the witnesses,
including your own family, says you did.
I didn't kill her.
what happened?
I don't know.
we were partying.
I did some blow, some meth. We had sex. I fell asleep.
then it's morning. Undine's dead.
the cops are busting in...
the door was locked from the inside.
there were bars on the windows. - Yes.
how is it physically possible that anyone else could've committed the murder?
I don't know, but I didn't.
ergo, someone else did.
someone you can find.
you see me. Am I lying?
you seem to be telling the truth,
but you're a very clever, unprincipled narcissist In a desperate corner.
even if you are innocent, it doesn't mean you have information on Red John.
Yeah, it's a tough call.
I'm gonna have to say no.
your wife... Red John painted her toenails. Yes.
painted them with her own blood...
the police didn't make that public, did they?
she's the only instance he did that, huh?
a touch of elegance for you alone.
how do you know that?
I told you, Red John is a friend of a friend of mine.
what is this friend's name?
his name is "get me out of here and I'll tell you.
that and much more."
okay.
no. I said no, and I mean no.
it's not that I don't want to help you. I want to help you.
it's just... It's not physically possible.
Jared Renfrew was tried and convicted. It's a closed case.
I have no authority to reopen it without cause.
there is cause. - For you, there's cause.
not for the state of California.
we can't touch it.
Ah, but we could touch it if... - Closed case. Nothing to be done.
the justice department doesn't go about...
undoing its own work.
I understand. No problem.
if we can't touch it, we can't touch it.
I'm sorry. - No.
the law's the law.
my desire for revenge doesn't outweigh the rules.
I have to accept that.
I'm glad you understand. - Thanks for your time.
he's lying through his teeth, isn't he?
Yes.
I know better than to try and stop you from doing what you think you have to do.
no, I - I'm fine about it.
I can see Minelli's point.
I can't be chasing every nutbag with a good story, can I?
Yeah. Sure, you're fine with it.
just do me the favor of listening to me for a minute, so I can say "I told you so" later.
sure.
Jared Renfrew was found hugging the corpse of Undine Kopecki In a room locked from the inside,
holding a bloody butcher knife in his hand.
his semen was inside of her.
he had been stalking her for weeks.
he's got a history of violence going back 15 years.
what's your point?
he's guilty. You're being conned.
possible, but I don't think so.
I gotta find out one way or the other.
even if he's telling the truth about the murder, he could still be lying about Red John.
also possible.
but I gotta take the chance. What else can I do?
Minelli wants me to keep a watch on you.
what are you gonna do? - I'm not gonna follow you around.
let's compromise.
when you get into trouble, call me first so I can try and minimize the damage.
deal.
and don't use your CBI card.
if the bureau finds out you used it without authorization, you're done.
I hear you.
Hello?
my name's Patrick Jane.
I'd like to speak to Gardner Renfrew about his brother Jared.
one moment, please.
Mr. Renfrew says, "No, thank you."
tell Mr. Renfrew I can prove his brother is innocent,
and I know who really committed the murder.
thank you very much.
is that your father?
Yes.
what's this all about, Mr. Jane?
who are you, and what do you mean by this?
do you think your brother is innocent?
you said you could prove he's innocent. You said you know who really did it.
no. Just... That was just to get inside the house.
I have no idea who might have done it.
it might've been Jared. Um, I hope not.
he seems to be telling the truth. What do you think?
I think you had better leave right now, Mr. Jane.
I don't have the... the time or the patience for tomfoolery.
so you think he's guilty? I'm wasting my time.
we're done talking.
suppose I could prove he was innocent. Wouldn't you want that?
wouldn't you want that blot on your name expunged?
of course he would.
nothing would make me happier, but my brother's guilty.
he violated that poor girl. He violated this house. He violated this family.
that's all I needed to know.
thank you for your time.
your, uh, mother lives here in the guesthouse, doesn't she?
you leave my mother alone.
well, that's not your call to make, is it?
Breck, call the police.
be sure and tell 'em I'm unarmed.
go inside, mother! Go inside!
my name's Patrick Jane. I want to speak to you about your son Jared.
I'll deal with him, mother. The police are on their way. Just go inside.
don't order me about, and don't be so hysterical.
what's your interest in Jared?
I'm a friend of his, trying to prove his innocence.
come and sit down. - Thank you.
mother, you're being childish.
go away, Gardner.
mother! - Go away!
tell me why you wish to prove my son's innocence.
Oh, I can promise you I'm not up to anything sinister, ma'am.
my motives are pure.
tell me about Jared.
he was a troubled child, charming and bright, but a bully and a liar.
something of a sadist.
qualities you rather liked in him, I expect.
Yes, I did.
I found him rather amusing... At first.
one doesn't want a wimp for a son.
but there must be a sense of proportion and moderation.
as he got older, he got worse.
got in with bad people.
it was one scandal after another. In and out of prison. A common criminal.
but he turned himself around, didn't he?
he gave up the drink and the drugs and the gallivanting,
made peace with his brother and came home to help run the family businesses.
the prodigal son. - Yes.
George, his father, was overjoyed.
I was skeptical.
pleased, of course, but skeptical.
as my mother always said, "You are what you are."
I guess she's right. - Yes.
poor George dropped dead a week after the murder.
broke his heart, people said.
george didn't really have a heart, in that sense.
he died of embarrassment.
a Renfrew in the pokey for murder.
can you show me where it happened?
who else was in the house?
I had a small dinner party, probably ten people all told.
after they left, it was just family...
Gardner and Breck, George and I And Jared, of course.
not Mariska the housekeeper?
no, she lived out.
Undine was only here to help the cook with the dinner party.
she was a lovely girl, full of life and promise.
her mother and Mariska had been with us 20 years...
part of the family.
Jared told me that he and Undine were having an affair,
that he loved her and he'd never hurt her.
she told her mother that he was stalking her, that she was scared of him.
she didn't go to the police out of respect for the family.
I'd like to speak to her.
she left our employ, I'm afraid.
it was too difficult, for both of us.
where is she now?
I have an address somewhere.
can you get it for me now?
as you wish. - Thank you.
sir, would you come with us? - Why?
you're trespassing here. - No, I'm not.
okay, sir, this man here says he's the homeowner
and says you're trespassing, so let's go, partner.
officer, it's the other way around. I'm the homeowner.
that man is the intruder. - Well, that's a lie! He...he's lying!
listen to the madness in his voice.
will you please take him somewhere he can get some help?
here you are. I don't know that she'll still be there, but...
thank you so much.
for heaven's sake, Gardner. Policemen?
how ridiculous. Send them away.
ma'am, this man here is... - Yes, yes, it's quite all right, officer.
you can go.
Thanks.
well, good-bye, Mrs. Renfrew.
I expect we'll speak again soon.
good day to you.
Gardner Renfrew is a player in this town.
you can't go to his house and screw around with him.
why not? It's a free country.
I didn't use my I. D. I didn't even mention the CBI.
you gave your real name. - It's my name.
Yeah, well, you should've lied as you so often do,
because now I have to give you an official reprimand
and order you in the strongest possible terms to leave the Renfrew family alone - And...and drop the matter. - Sorry, can't do that.
you have to. This is straight from the A. G. 's office.
Jared Renfrew didn't kill Undine Kopecki.
do you have evidence of that? - Not yet.
I have pieces... That I'm piecing together.
he's innocent.
wake up, Dorothy. You're not in Kansas anymore.
there are innocent men in jail. It happens.
is he one of them? I don't know. I doubt it.
in any case, we can't reopen his case.
if I'm Dorothy, then who are you?
it doesn't matter who I am.
we will find other ways of making Renfrew talk to you.
there is a lot that can be done to make a prisoner's life easier If he cooperates.
it's not gonna work. He's innocent.
okay, here it is.
if you pursue this any further, I'm gonna have to throw you out of the CBI.
we can't take the liability.
I very much do not want to have to do that.
I know you don't.
so, uh... Well, I'll spare you the trouble. I quit.
don't do that. - Oh, it's okay. It's best this way.
you are the good witch Glinda, obviously.
thank you.
I learned a lot.
CBI HQ Sacramento, CA
don't bother, I know. I feel the same way. Nothing to be done.
so now when he really needs our help, we're letting him down.
I wanna help him just as much as you do.
our orders state that we must stay away from this case.
I don't care what our orders say. It's not right.
we closed cases before he came.
we'll close cases after he's gone.
Yeah, just not so many.
the cases are not the point. It's not that we need him. He needs us.
Yeah, he needs us on a fool's errand. Renfrew's a con man.
he doesn't know anything about Red John.
suppose we found a connection between Renfrew and Red John.
it would... Wait.
what's in the file? Let me guess...
a connection between Renfrew and Red John?
seven years ago, Renfrew was serving time on a narcotics conviction.
he shared a cell in Lompoc with a man by the name of Orval Tanner.
Tanner claimed in his 1998 trial for murder that he had only been an accomplice,
that the real killer was a man by the name of Red John.
nobody believed him.
98. That's the beginning of Red John's career.
Where's tanner now?
he died of heart disease in a prison hospital.
of course, our luck. - It's a connection.
slim. Likely, nobody believed him for a reason.
but it's a connection.
okay.
check out Tanner's background, find the autopsy reports,
see if there's any credibility to his story.
I mean, obviously, we can't do that,
but that's what I would tell you to do If we weren't ordered to stay away from this case.
okay, then let me speak to the assistant to the deputy records officer.
why do people say "eureka" when they do something good?
it's, uh, Greek for "bingo."
well, so... Eureka.
I found the autopsy reports, and they back up Orval Tanner's story.
the body of the alleged victim... Cut up, Red John style.
which means Renfrew's telling some kind of truth about his Red John connection.
Yep.
van Pelt. What's that you're working on?
sir, I asked her to... - I'm talking to Van Pelt.
sir... I'm doing research for Jane. No excuses, sir.
you, too, I suppose.
Hey, boss.
I gave this unit a direct, written order, and they have flagrantly disobeyed that order.
did they do that with your knowledge?
I ordered them to do it.
I told them you countermanded your earlier order.
they had no knowledge whatsoever that they were doing anything irregular.
nice try, mother Teresa. They already gave themselves up.
we never said a word...
I stand by my story.
they didn't know they were out of line.
sir, the opposite is true. We forced agent Lisbon to let us do this.
very touching.
my ex-wife would love this scene in a movie.
I'm giving you all formal notice.
any further infractions will result in immediate suspension.
sir, you might as well suspend me now, because there will be further infractions.
Jane needs our help, and he's gonna get it.
I'm not gonna lay off because some fat cat's putting on the pressure.
me, too. - And me.
moving, eloquent, two thumbs up.
you shall have your wish. You're all suspended,
starting right now, for gross insubordination.
I'm sorry.
Lisbon. Still here?
uh, that was more of a rhetorical stand we were taking back there.
you take it back then.
well, no, but I wanted to talk to...
this... The, um, The suspension paperwork right here.
look...
I have to go and visit my sister in Hawaii for a week. She's sick.
meanwhile, this paperwork is gonna sit on my desk for a week, is that clear?
one week. - Yes, sir.
yes... - Thank you.
be very grateful. Do not contact me. I do not want to know anything.
and please do not dig the hole that you are standing in any deeper than you have already dug it.
no, sir.
that hole is the grave of your very promising career.
you should put a flashlight underneath your chin just to complete the effect.
I'm not kidding. - I know.
Hey, Lisbon.
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Uh, just, uh...
out investigating stuff.
sure. Yeah, uh...
pepperoni or plain?
okay.
uh, hey, Lisbon...
thank you.
Renfrew couldn't dispute the physical evidence.
the core of his defense was that he loved Undine deeply and he would never hurt her.
Undine's mother testified that was a lie.
I went to go speak with her, but she moved, left no forwarding address.
Mariska Kopecki, right? - Yeah.
how does the brother look?
he had motive. There's a moral turpitude clause in the family trust.
once convicted, all Jared's shares in the family business went to Gardner.
but he would've also got the shares if Jared had died.
so why not just kill Jared? Why kill Undine?
exactly. Why kill Undine?
he wanted to see Jared suffer maybe or had a thing for Undine himself.
Eureka.
I input Mariska Kopecki into the secure search engine.
I get an I. M. link to a health care database that documents Mariska Kopecki's notification
that she's changing her name to Vanna Clooney.
I input the new name and get a hit.
four months ago, someone named V. K. Clooney bought a condo in Marin.
nice work.
Yeah, weird thing, though -- the original I. M. came from a civilian.
a Dr. Joe in New Hampshire.
he couldn't have been logged on to the D. O. J. secure network.
so how did he know what I was asking about?
and how did he have access to the health care database? Nobody's allowed to do that.
when you say "Dr. Joe in New Hampshire," do you mean d-r-j-o-e-n-h...
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
ask, "Who are you?"
is Jane there?
Yes.
this is Jane.
keep up the good work.
Why?
I. M. source locator
he's gone.
what the hell was that about?
he somehow tapped into the D. O. J. secure network.
he's been spying on us.
can we find the source of the I. M?
there's a self-destruct code built into the uplink.
it dead-ends at the secondary server.
there's no way to trace it back.
he wants us to succeed.
he wants Renfrew out of jail.
out where he can get at him -- to silence him.
Yes. Which means Renfrew is telling the truth.
which means he has the goods on Red John.
slow down. We don't have anything yet.
Yes, we still have to get Renfrew out of jail first.
Oh, that's all.
and we will, and then Red John will go after him.
he has to break cover. He has to.
damn.
how are you gonna get us in there without your magic badge?
you do the talking. - No, you try.
don't be childish. I'm not
Oh, I thought it was Harry. Who are you?
Vanna Clooney? - Yes.
I'm Teresa, and this is Patrick. - Yes.
can -- can we come in for a moment?
what do you want?
it's to do with Harry. - What about him?
well, it's best not to speak out here in public.
okay, I lied just now.
we're here to talk about your daughter Undine.
get out. - Sit down.
who are you?
listen to me, or your guilt and pain and shame won't ever go away.
it won't go away until you tell the truth.
what truth? What, are you crazy?
you don't know me. You don't know what I feel.
I do know you.
when you first came to this country as a young woman, you dreamed of such great things,
what a life you'd have.
and what did fate bring you?
25 years of drudgery, a servant's life.
you hated every day of it.
who wants to be a servant? Nobody.
you did it for her, for Undine, so that she would have a better life.
Yes. - And then she was gone, taken from you.
in a flash, your whole life
all those days of drudgery and humiliation -- wasted.
what a joke, huh?
Yes. A joke.
what do you want from me?
I want to know who killed her.
what's it matter who killed her? She's gone.
well, you didn't say Jared. That would be the obvious answer.
okay. Jared killed her. I don't care.
it's true.
there's nothing you can do that will bring her back.
so if you get paid to lie about what happened, then, uh, where's the harm?
what paid? Nobody paid me anything.
don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.
you took your 20 pieces of silver and bought the life you always wanted, didn't you?
no. - It's what you always wanted. It means nothing.
look at me, Mariska. Look at me, and tell me I'm wrong.
you think you know everything! You know nothing!
I know that Jared and Undine were lovers, weren't they?
and you were paid to say that they weren't.
say it out loud.
Yes. They were lovers.
who paid you to say that they weren't?
I don't know.
a what you call a... a private investigator.
he came to me, and he offered me a lot of money.
a lot of money! But I said no.
he offered more.
I took it. - What was his name?
okay, Cho, thank you.
Samsa's dead. - What?
hit by a bus. - Damn.
we could get a court order for his records.
remember, you're on suspension.
if we don't get this closed up before Minelli gets back, we're done.
plan "b" then. - What's plan "b"?
well, you're not gonna like it.
we need to speak with your husband, ma'am.
who's the agent in charge here?
I'm agent Lisbon. This is agent Rigsby.
and I believe you've met my colleague Patrick Jane.
hello.
I expect you're wondering why I gathered you all here?
Breck, go call the police. - Uh, Mr. Renfrew, wait.
unless you want your family ruined In a deluge of sordid scandal,
you might want to listen to me.
what are you talking about?
someone, I don't know who, paid Mariska Kopecki a lot of money to lie about Jared and Undine.
they were lovers, as your brother said.
so what? The fact is, they were found in a locked room.
it's not physically possible for someone to have gotten into the room to commit the murder.
Yes, there's the rub. The key was in the door.
watch closely.
would you please go inside and lock the door?
suppose Jared and Undine are inside sleeping.
it's all very clever, but how do you get out again?
can I borrow your lighter, please?
thank you.
and that is how Jared was framed. Cool, huh?
it doesn't mean Jared's innocent.
and it certainly doesn't mean someone else is guilty.
it's a party trick.
a party trick a jury will love.
put that together with Mariska's testimony,
and I think we have a pretty good chance of winning a new trial.
then the truth will come out somehow. Unless...
unless what?
unless we can make some kind of financial deal here
that would make it worth our while dropping all this.
you want money? You're blackmailing us.
eh, we call it leverage. - But you're state agents.
ex-State agents. Thanks to your son here,
Jane was tossed out, and we're going with him.
we need to look after ourselves now.
we won't be unreasonable.
you people are a disgrace. Get out.
Oh, we're going.
we'll give you until 4: 00 to call us with an offer.
after that, we're gonna make some calls of our own.
I'll tell you who I'm calling. I'm calling the FBI!
am I wrong, or did that go down not quite as you'd hoped?
I've had better responses, but I think we made a sale.
you never can tell. - We're doomed.
patience.
patience.
patience.
if you say "patience" one more time...
Hello?
I'll be right there.
who was it?
I confess, I thought it'd be Gardner who called me.
Gardner? He hasn't the gumption.
I will not see our family name dragged through the mud again.
how much do you want to keep quiet?
how much did you give Mariska?
I don't say I paid her anything.
you needn't be evasive.
only a guilty person would respond this way to such naked extortion.
I know you're guilty.
I'm just not sure why.
your suspicions are neither here nor there.
I asked you your price.
your late husband was a handsome man.
Yes, he was. What's that got to do with it?
domineering, though. Had to have things his way.
he died how long after the murder?
a week. Aortic aneurysm.
and Mariska-- she left your employ when?
at the same time.
after he died, though.
Yes.
may I? Thank you.
so you got rid of her as soon as you could after he died,
because Undine was your husband's child, wasn't she?
Yes.
and you never confronted him or Mariska? - No.
I decided I liked my life as it was.
I didn't want a drama, and I didn't want to be lied to.
they never knew I suspected.
18 years of secret anger.
how did you stand it?
nobody's life is perfect.
and then when you found out about Undine and Jared's affair, you must've been enraged.
it's practically incest.
it is. It is incest.
when I found out, I - I told Jared that he was not to continue the affair.
he refused...
said he was in love with her.
he refused to stop seeing her.
didn't you tell him why you objected?
certainly not.
I couldn't tell him.
it was too sordid, too humiliating.
instead, you killed Undine, paid off her mother and sent your son to jail for life.
no. I wouldn't do that.
Undine's blood.
it's proof... I did it.
I took it so I could confess and get Jared freed when I chose.
just as soon as he learned his lesson. - What lesson?
everything in moderation. And...
listen to your mother. - Can't argue with that.
two Week Later - good? - Yep.
okay.
we're ready to go get Renfrew.
is the safe house all set up? - Yeah.
good. I guess I'll see you over there later.
Jane, please be careful.
remember, this is playing out just like Red John wants it to.
this is playing out just like it has to.
he has no choice but to try and silence Renfrew.
he has to show himself.
we're getting close. I can feel it.
you can feel it. Like a psychic thing? - No.
I am quietly confident that we will get a bite.
you think you're playing him, and he thinks he's playing you.
one of you is wrong.
thank you.
thank you.
I kept my side of the bargain. Now it's your turn.
tell what you know. - Absolutely.
all will be revealed. But here?
give me a chance to catch a breath of fresh air,
and then we will sit and talk as long as you like.
and I got a lot to tell. And I owe you... big-time.
I owe you my life.
in the meantime, uh, I would kill for a cheeseburger and fries.
drive-through. - Put this on.
can't you say "please"? I'm a free man now.
put this on... please. - Sure.
meat IS MURDER
fur IS EVIL
what is this?
damn it!
he vanished five hours ago, and we've heard nothing from him since.
the town was on pretty good lockdown,
so we're guessing he had friends get him out of the area fast.
planted in advance, probably.
would you stop that? It's not your fault.
well, whose fault is it then? It's mine. I have to accept that.
Ah, actually, it's -- it's my fault.
okay, everyone? My fault.
what's done is done. Focus on now.
we need to get to Renfrew before Red John does.
where is he now? Who are his friends? What are his options?
Hello? - Mr. Jane.
I just wanted to call and apologize for letting you down.
Hello, Jared.
it was dishonorable, I know, but crossing Red John just... seems too dangerous.
you've already crossed him. You need our protection.
I haven't given you a thing.
how is he to know that? - Oh, he'll know. He'll know.
like I said, I have friends, and they'll put in a good word for me.
friends? What friends? Who?
uh, wouldn't you like to know?
Jared, listen to me. You can't trust them. They're not your friends.
damn fool. Red john probably already has his location.
did you trace the line? - Yes, I'm tracking the call now.
he's in Tijuana, Mexi, in a motel room with a hooker.
because?
he wouldn't call if he didn't think he was out of our reach.
I could hear Latin music and sirens and horns and a whole neighborhood in the background,
which suggests thin walls and a city.
hence, Tijuana Motel room. - And the hooker?
he needs to use somebody's phone, and he has been in prison for a year. Hence, the hooker.
the phone belongs to Juana Porfiria Braga...
calle Rojas 65, Tijuana, Mexico.
five arrests on prostitution charges.
let me get a location on the call.
I'll go reach out to the federal police in Tijuana.
you boys come with me. - Yes, sir.
go ahead. Say it.
say what? - You told me. You warned me.
you get the privilege of saying, "I told you so."
that's all right. Not now. This isn't over yet.
we're gonna find Renfrew, and he's gonna tell us what he knows.
got it. Motel Carona Del Norte.
he is...
well, you can say it now.
well, I don't really feel like saying it.
let me take a rain check on that. - Sure.
what do you think it means?
it means Red John is far more powerful than I ever thought.
he's been way ahead of me this whole time.
I mean the writing on the wall.
I have no idea.
it's a good clue, though, isn't it?
Jared was trying to tell us something important.
maybe.
next time, We'll get him.
next time.
Hello?
mentalist /men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental Acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of Thoughts and behavior.
I don't know, but she actually called and said that she'd done it.
anything else you guys hear, let us know, okay?
thank you.
kid's name's Cody Elkins, 16 years old.
reported missing a couple days ago.
turned serious enough to call us when the local policemen found the boy's shoe two streets away in a gutter.
waiting on the d. n.a. We figure it's an abduction, potential homicide, which makes it a cbi case.
the parents are Michael and Janice, both clean.
they have another son named Brad, 14.
they own a flower shop here. Cho's with 'em now.
let's go.
think I'll just wait out here.
sure, whatever.
Hey, dude. - Nice bike.
you boys gotta be pretty anxious to see something to ride this, huh?
you didn't ride a pink bike through town to come to the store, did you?
What'd you come to see? - Nothing.
Really? - Let's go, Clyde.
Where's Cody Elkins?
I don't know.
I know you guys know where he is.
you don't have to tell me out loud. Just look in the direction. That way?
why did you do that?
thank you. Here's your bike.
be safe.
Cho's gonna bring the Elkins home.
I have a pretty good idea where Cody Elkins is.
sharing is good.
what makes you think it's him?
because those kids gave it away. Plus they smelled like eucalyptus.
but there's eucalyptus trees all over around here.
crows. - So?
crows are carrion birds. They like dead things.
Oh, jeez.
poor kid.
what does it mean?
black magic. Sacrifice.
but there's no such thing as black magic.
well, somebody disagrees.
we're looking for a murder weapon.
anything you find, anything at all, tag it and bag it. Thanks, guys.
wait a second.
when did you last see Cody?
friday night, after the game.
Cody plays wide receiver for his high school team.
uh, they got blown out pretty good that night.
but, uh, it's a pretty good team this year.
it's nationally ranked.
when exactly did you see him last on Friday?
uh, when he went to bed.
we were, all three of us, out early the next morning.
when we came back that afternoon, Cody was gone.
he was, uh, supposed to meet his coach the next morning for, uh,
some extra practice, but he never showed up.
and that friday night, what was his state of mind?
he was fine. Fine.
he was a little upset with himself about the game.
he'd, uh, made some mental errors, you know?
coach d. Got on him pretty good.
Cody kind of pushed back a little bit, I guess.
they had a fight?
you could say.
it's nothing serious-- locker room stuff, a little shouting.
Cody just wanted to do better.
how did he die?
there were indications around the body of some kind of black magic ritual.
now did he have any friends or acquaintances who were involved in that kind of thing?
Oh, my god.
it was her.
of course.
who's this? - Tamzin Dove.
she's into all that black magic crap.
she's... Claims to be a witch.
says she has powers.
and did she have some sort of resentment toward Cody?
about a-a week ago, she, uh...
she claimed that Cody stole her cat.
did he? - No. Of course not.
but she put a spell on him in revenge.
a spell? What kind of spell?
I don't know, but she actually called and said that she'd done it.
that must have been worrisome.
at the time, Cody thought it was kind of funny.
I mean, she's a-a geek, you know?
I think that's why we didn't think about her right away.
where can we find Tamzin Dove?
things are getting weird already.
we're off to see a witch.
Oh, be careful.
Yeah, yeah. You find anything useful there?
Nothing--no murder weapon, not a lot of blood.
looks like he was killed elsewhere.
M. e. Estimates that he died on saturday morning,
the cause being several blows with a heavy, blunt object like a crowbar or a pipe, maybe.
okay, I want you two to go and talk to Cody's football coach.
he and the kid had a fight on Friday night.
they were supposed to meet up on Saturday morning.
got it. We got the football beat.
okay.
Look--a goat.
goats are signs of Satan.
so petting zoos are, like, gateways to hell?
very much.
Ooh, look, another bad sign.
you shouldn't joke around about this kind of stuff.
it doesn't look like anybody's home.
not much security for a servant of the devil.
I could pick that lock with this in about five seconds.
we'll wait.
don't look now, but we should grab one of those kids and talk to 'em.
damn.
are they the same kids from the Elkins shop?
Yes.
let's see some hustle out there now!
it's a tragedy. His whole life ahead of him. Great kid, too.
go, go, go, go, go, go!
vinson, you manatee!
move your lard butt downfield!
great kid. Good values, good habits.
you were supposed to meet with him Saturday morning?
that's right. Right here, 9:00 a. m. for some serious fumble prevention reps.
he never showed.
you and he had serious words Friday night, right?
Yeah, Cody had a shameful game-- zero t. d.s, two fumbles and five blown routes
a personal foul that cost us 15 yards.
he let himself down and let his team down.
that's been his m. o.lately.
that's why we were meeting on Saturday morning, to get him back on track.
"shameful"--that's kind of harsh, isn't it?
I run a reality-based program here.
if you want to hear malarkey, try the English department.
Tillis! I can see you, Tillis! I can see you.
what did Cody have to say in reply?
what I discussed with Cody is nobody's business.
people have no freakin' idea how it is between a coach and his team.
Oh, we have an idea.
I doubt it.
we looked into your history, mr. Dieter.
five years ago, you lost a high school coaching job in oregon for inappropriate physical contact with students.
wait a minute.
you make that sound like i'm a sex molester or somethin'.
I smacked a couple of kids because they needed an attitude adjustment.
their pantywaist parents made an issue of it.
that's okay then? - It's football.
actually, that's assault on a minor.
there were no charges filed.
but you had to resign. - No. No, I chose to resign.
with a promise to take anger management class.
36 hours' worth. I did my time.
bored the rage right out of me.
ask all the questions you want.
I'm not trying to hide something here. - Good.
we need to search the school gym and the locker rooms.
do whatever you gotta do. Frank!
Frank, you need to pull around him, and you need to get upfield.
no, your strong side tackle should do that.
he's got the better first set, and your tight end's jumping his route.
Hey, quick hands, think fast. Hit me. I'm open.
uh, no.
what kind of coach's kid are you?
your daddy would be ashamed.
fine. Go long.
Oh, nice!
Hey, check this out. - Interesting.
let's get this to forensics.
okay, boss.
Minelli says we can go in. The warrant's on its way. Let's do this.
bet you can't do it in five...
never mind.
what's wrong? - I'll wait out here.
Why?
all right, I'll go in, but you first.
hello. - Hello.
welcome.
you must be the cbi.
please sit down. - Thank you.
why didn't you just let us in?
if I had, I wouldn't have the upper hand, now would I?
so you were expecting us.
of course.
I heard what was done to Cody Elkins.
they used a pentacle and a flame, made it look like witchcraft--wicca.
naturally, you'd come to me.
I'm the only witch in town.
those details about that-- no, thank you--pentacles, and the candles weren't made public.
how did you know about them? - Yes, please.
friends.
so your friends were involved in Cody's death?
no.
are these friends small with long hair?
the big one's name is Clyde?
he has a sister with a pink bike?
Yes, that's them.
you're friends with a lot of kids then.
Yes, kids...
they like mystery and darkness, and I like kids.
what do their parents have to say about that?
the kids that come here come because their parents don't give a hoot.
but they had nothing to do with Cody's death, nor the pentacle and the candles.
what were they doing in the woods, then?
picking herbs for me. - Herbs?
fenugreek, wild roses, nettles.
please.
I make and sell wicca healing powders on the internet.
you should check out my web site.
why didn't you tell the police your friends found a body?
what for?
I knew the earth and the rain and the animals would take care of Cody.
you can't help him.
it's true. We can't, but what wecando is find and punish the people who murdered him.
there's no need. Cody deserved to die. He was a bad person.
he stole and tortured and killed my cat.
I saw him take it.
why would he do that?
fear, I guess.
that's just the way it is with the cowen.
they live in fear.
the cowen?
those who are not wicca.
those who unbelieve our powers.
what powers are you talking about, exactly?
a witch is simply a high priestess of the wicca.
we worship the horned god and the triple goddess.
we're healers mostly, but we have the magic also, when needed
spells and so forth.
did you put a spell on Cody Elkins?
I did.
I put a killing spell on him.
I'd done the spell several times before, but this is the first time it's worked.
what does the spelling involve?
what do you do, exactly?
why am I here?
so you can explain to us why forensics tells us that your blood was found l over a t-shirt we found in cody's locker.
I told you, we had an argument.
Oh, so now you're saying you had an actual fistfight?
you drew blood? - Yeah.
it was no big deal. I chewed him out. He got mad.
he took a couple of swings at me.
laid out by a kid, huh?
it was a lucky punch.
so your own student beats you up, and you don't tell anyone?
it was no big deal.
or maybe you figured you're gonna get even with him the next morning, so best keep it quiet, huh?
no. No.
I was too embarrassed.
people don't know the kid is a freaking nut bag.
makes me look bad either way, so I just pretended it didn't happen.
he hit you first-- his own coach?
I told you--a nut bag.
well, that's not what we've heard.
ask Daniel Brown.
he's a good friend of Cody's.
last month Cody got mad over a card game or something.
beat Danno unconscious. Had to be dragged off of him.
I don't know why Danno didn't press charges.
Daniel Brown? - Yeah.
killing spells are secret, but this is a public binding spell that icanshow you, and it's similar.
what is your name? - What's it to you?
Kimball Cho.
God and goddess, hear me.
by light of the one flame, let this mortal soul, Kimball Cho, be bound by my power.
so that he knows I speak truth, let him behold the king of beasts and kneel before him.
come on.
that's it? That's your spell?
you're not gonna make him drink a potion or anything like that?
doesn't look like much, does it?
but it's very powerful magic.
Yeah, okay.
unfortunately it seems that one of your friends helped your magic along with a blunt instrument.
in which case, you're as unmagically guilty as they are.
if a friend of mine had done this,
they wouldn't have pointed the police right to me with a pentacle and flame.
no, Cody's murder was staged to look like wicca.
any fool in this town would think of it. It's obvious misdirection.
there's a witch in town. Duh.
a witch that put a killing spell on the boy in question.
exactly. It's perfect.
thank you for your time.
thank you.
Cho? Kimball Cho, let's go.
didn't want to bring her in?
you don't think she did this, do you?
Oh, she's deep in it somehow-- hiding something or someone.
I agree. I'd bring her in, but on what charges?
she's a whack job. She enjoys the attention.
quicker and more effective to just ignore her and let her come to us.
that's very astute psychology, Lisbon. I'm impressed.
Hey, why'd you give her my name?
she said I was gonna kneel before the lord of beasts. What does that even mean?
what? Oh, come on.
you're not telling me you believe she's an actual witch.
no, of course not.
but I mean, if dark forces did exist,
it stands to reason there could be people who control them for their own ends.
they're called investment bankers.
they don't live around here, I assure you.
relax. No such thing as witches.
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
weird witch lady didn't burn you in effigy and bind you to her power.
"Kimball," she says, "you shall kneel before the lord of beasts."
that's scary. - Yeah.
Yeah, if you're a 12-year-old girl at her first sleepaway camp.
you had to be there.
don't sweat it, man. Met this girl in college. She said she was a witch.
it's not a satanic cult. They're just nerds in cloaks.
Hey, there he is.
Daniel Brown?
we've got some questions about Cody Elkins.
No! Let me go!
hello to beast. - Let me see your hands.
let me go! - Come on.
the spell was real.
let's go.
Danactive your fight with Cody Elkins.
what fight? There was no fight.
no? He beat you unconscious is what we heard.
put you in the hospital. We have witnesses.
who?
Nah, it wasn't that bad. - T you in the hospital?
Yeah, for a couple of hours.
it was observation.
so why didn't you press charges?
it was a misunderstanding between friends.
nobody's fault.
Oh, I want to get in there.
go in there.
just... I'm just...
or perhaps you figured you'd take revenge more... Directly?
Nah.
how did the fight start, Daniel?
over at roy t. 'S place playing cards, drinkin'.
his mom's in rehab.
so he's got the run of the place.
I did some trash-talkin'. Cody got mad.
we fought. He won. That's all.
I'm going in.
Rigsby, uh, you-- do you mind if I...
no, do your thing, man. - Thanks.
I'm Patrick. You must be... - Daniel.
all right, Daniel? - Yeah?
can I keep your hand? Thanks. Nothing strange.
I want you to breathe...
and look right here.
what did you say that angered Cody?
it was a card game.
a lot of trash-talking.
so I was tripping on his family like, "your mom's a ho. Dad's a punk bitch.
keep it over here.
just relax and keep it right up in here.
I'm lookin' at you, man. - Good.
anyway, Cody goes off. Bam.
smashes a beer bottle over my head.
no warning.
I mean, I'm out cold, but...
but the guys tell me he tried to seriously stomp me out.
and if they hadn't grabbed him, I could be dead.
how much did the Elkins pay you for your silence?
nothing. - Want to try that again?
1000
you have to admit it's uncanny. The lord of beasts?
coincidence.
please. What are the chances?
million to one.
there you go.
life is a million to one.
the universe is one big coincidence.
cosmically improbable coincidences-- they happen all the time.
we just don't notice 'em.
or she's a witch.
or she's a witch.
is she in custody-- the witch?
no, sir.
why not?
she did put a spell on your son, like you said. You're right.
but that doesn't constitute a criminal offense.
that's protected free speech.
so why are you here?
it seems Cody had some violence issues that we need to speak about.
no. He was a good boy.
Oh, we're not saying otherwise, ma'am.
but if he had problems with his temper,
that might help explain the context leading to his death.
context? In a pig's ear.
you're trying to blame Cody for his own death.
I have a question. It's always bothered me.
why do they call it football?
people don't really use their feet much, do they?
are you trying to be rude or disrespectful or what?
could I use your bathroom, please?
down the hall to your left.
Thanks.
what's his problem? - Sorry about that.
do you know a boy named Daniel Brown? - No.
fine.
I see where this is going.
Daniel and Cody had a fight.
there you are.
go away.
I can't. I wish I could.
it's my job to hound people until I get the truth.
Yeah, well, uh, good luck with that.
nice place.
must be tough being Cody Elkins' little brother.
no.
well... Sometimes.
me? I'd hate it.
he gets all the attention, the glory, the girls flocking around-- for what?
for running and jumping and catching a-a thing?
Yeah, monkeys could do that. - Yeah.
monkeys could do it better.
Yeah, you know, if monkeys played football, they would kick some serious jock butt.
all right, I admit it.
I gave Daniel Brown money to, uh, to keep him quiet.
Cody has a...
had... A real shot at a college career.
would have been the first Elkins to have that chance, and we were so proud.
but you gotta understand.
a coach hears about these kinds of run-ins,
and it would have ruined his chances at one of the top schools.
had these run-ins ever happened before? - No.
no, our son had no problem with violence.
it was an isolated incident.
Where's your friend?
I don't know.
how come Cody killed Tamzin Dove's cat?
I-I don't know that he did that.
she saw him take it.
well, look, she--she saw what she saw, right?
all right? I-I don't know.
um, if--if he did do it...
you know, k-kill the cat...
do you think he deserved to die? - Do you?
I'm asking you.
you don't speak to my son without my permission.
well, that's a little weird and controlling, but okay.
do you mind if I speak to your son, mr. Elkins?
Yes, I do mind.
I asked. See you around, Brad.
Oh, my god. Where's my food? What is this?
that is healthy and nutritious snacking.
I'm gonna die.
seriously, I'm allergic to carrots.
well, I'm tired of the car reeking like fast food.
it's like working with a caterpillar...
I can't even be in the same room as a carrot. I go into anaphylactic sho
funny.
that's enough. Rigsby, come on.
look, look, look, look. There he is. He's leaving.
why won't this damn thing log in?
Lisbon. - 8
Oh, good, Van Pelt. How do I get on to the
we just followed the kid to the witch's house.
is she with him?
he just went inside. They hugged.
Brad Elkins is at Tamzin dove's.
he hugged her and then went inside.
interesting.
they should wait ten minutes, then go in.
why wait?
let the plot develop. Let the fruit ripen. Let the yeast rise, etcetera.
what if he means to do her harm?
well, if he was gonna do that, he'd have done it by now.
wait ten minutes, then go in.
okay, boss. - Well?
we wait ten minutes, then we go in.
and personally, I don't care if we wait all night.
witchcraft creeps me out.
it doesn't bother me. Nerds in cloaks.
there's more to it than that.
Ah, it's just a silly alternative lifestyle, like "star trek" or yoga.
I do yoga.
by blood, has he been sullied.

hear that? - What is that?
by blood, let him be cleansed.
not yoga.
police, freeze! Everybody stay where you are!
stay where you are! - Everybody stay where you are!
drop the knife. - Drop the knife.
Brad, we're cbi. You all right?
come on. Let's go. Let's go back. Let's go. - What? No!
What--what's wrong with you people, huh?
why can't you just leave me alone? - Come on, Brad.
stay calm, Brad.
be patient with the ways of the cowen.
everybody just stay where you are.
Tamzin DOVE. I like it.
these files say your real name is Sarah Jones from New Jersey.
your mother committed suicide when you were 16.
you don't know who your father is.
you're a college dropout.
you have a history of mild psychiatric problems,
and you served six months for shoplifting a few years back.
Sarah Jones is dead.
I'm Tamzin Dove. I am a priestess of wicca. You can't hurt me.
Oh, I don't want to hurt you.
I imagine there's been enough of that.
I want to help you.
this is a murder investigation, so one way or another, you're looking at trouble.
the goddess will protect me.
Tamzin, the goddess may give you solace and hope and meaning in your life,
but she can't protect you from those police out there.
Brad's been an apprentice of my coven since last autumn equinox.
there's no crime in that.
kind of young to be a witch, isn't it?
we're all born witch.
we're all born into magic.
it's taken from us as we grow up.
interesting, if true.
how did Brad's parents feel about this new direction in his life?
Brad's parents just...
really hate witches for some reason.
I mean, like, more than most.
about a month ago his mom threatened to kill me if I ever spoke to him again.
but you did.
Brad came to me of his own free will.
he was drawn to wicca.
I couldn't turn him away.
how does he feel about the spell you put on his brother?
he's at peace with it.
that's why we were conducting the cleansing ritual.
Brad knows the difference between the world of magic and the real world.
he understands I didn't kill his brother.
maybe because in the real world, Brad did it.
what have you got?
Brad's been hospitalized twice in the last year.
both times the accident report lists the cause as "roughhousing with brother."
think maybe Brad had enough?
everybody has a limit.
I have to go.
me? No!
w-why would I kill my own brother?
so he would stop hurting you.
Yeah, but he never hurt me. Ever!
he put you in the hospital twice.
accidents. They--they were accidents. So?
so he did hurt you. It was just--it was accidentally.
Yeah. I-I mean no.
Yeah.
he hated that you were friends with Tamzin, didn't he?
Yes.
but you never gave her up.
Why?
I feel safe there.
sorry. Can I have a minute?
we'll be right back.
the parents are here. You want me to hold 'em off?
Yeah. Wait. No.
let Brad go with them until we get some hard evidence to bear down on them.
Yes, but let me talk to them first.
please have a seat.
I don't see why you had to drag him all the way down here.
we're sorry for any inconvenience.
strange that neither of you told us about the connection with Tamzin Dove.
we were...
confused, to be honest with you.
we don't understand Brad's obsession with witchcraft.
we want to understand, and we're trying, but it's...
it's disturbing and, uh, a little embarrassing, to tell you the truth.
we're in this together, right?
we're gonna get help.
nowadays there's, uh, therapy for these kinds of problems, right?
we'll get through this.
have you charged that, uh, woman? - No.
no?
I mean, isn't it obvious that she did it
her, one of her weirdo friends? I mean
she's helping us with our inquiries.
she swears she's innocent, so we're having her put a spell of revelation on the murder weapon.
a spell of revelation?
witches have the power of telekinesis.
she says that she has a spell which will raise the weapon from wherever it's being concealed and reveal itself to us.
and you believe this evil crap?
well, you never can tell. We're gonna give it a whirl.
that's insane.
her last spell seemed to work pretty well.
how could you be so cold?
practice.
I apologize. Brad is free to go.
let's go. - Come on, son.
see you, Brad.
well, look after yourself, and if I were you,
I'd stay very clear of Brad Elkins for a while.
I'll do as the goddess tells me.
whatever.
Oh, listen, next time you speak to her, could you, uh, put a good word in for me?
I will. - Thanks.
Hey, I thought you were gonna have her cast a spell to find the murder weapon.
Oh, the spell's already cast.
when did she cast it?
she didn't. I did.
you can cast spells?
Cho, there's no such thing as spells.
I know that.
he, uh, really is quite freaked out about this witchcraft malarkey, isn't he?
uh, yeah.
we're gonna need to work a double shift on the stakeout tonight.
are you at least gonna tell me what's going on?
Oh, come on. You're telling me you don't know what's going on?
you don't know who did th and why?
no, but you're gonna tell me.
how about I show you?
here we go. - Better call Cho.
you're not going anywhere.
put it down.
this is god speaking.
you made me angry, Michael.
very angry.
and you're under arr-- - that's enough.
arrest.
amazing, isn't it?
the murder weapon revealed.
Tamzin's spells seem to work.
I guess she really is a witch.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm sure forensics will confirm your son's blood
and tissue on one side of the wrench and your fingerprints on the other.
I have no knowledge of that.
then why were you trying to hide it?
talk to us, Michael.
maybe there were circumstances.
maybe you had to defend yourself.
I don't have to tell you anything.
what about your sons' trips to the emergency room-- their broken bones?
just clumsy, I guess.
maybe a little dense at times.
good that they had you to keep 'em in line, huh?
some people just don't understand how lucky they are.
that's right.
I realized it was you when Brad said he liked going to Tamzin's house
because he felt safe there.
Safe--he feels safer at a witch's house than they do at home.
you've been abusing and beating your wife and sons for years, haven't you?
no. - My guess?
you were smackin' Brad around a little too much.
Cody wanted to protect his brother. Was that it?
no.
"no," he says.
your wife and son are down the hallway, and they say no, too.
they know we caught him throwing away the murder weapon,
and they still don't believe he killed Cody.
imagine how much they love this man to be in such denial.
Cody confronted you, didn't he?
he wouldn't put up with your crap anymore...
come on!
but you wouldn't hear of it.
he hit me.
I was defending myself.
good-bye, Michael.
morning.
what are you doing?
Ah, just a little favor for Cho.
uh, Tamzin dove told me to give you this.
she said to keep it in a safe place.
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental Acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of Thoughts and behavior.
are you sure about this? What if somebody sees us?
relax, baby. I got it all under control.
what do we have here?
the name's Harry Lashley, a junior v.p. With the company.
he's the son-in-law of the boss, A.P.Caid.
the receptionist, miss Duane, over there, forget her phone.
came back to get it, found him like this.
she called security. Luckily I was working late.
I called 9-1-1 as soon as I got here.
I then opened up Mr. Caid's office to check, but nothing was amiss.
I have an all-access pass.
well, come on.
only one thing was missing, but it's the most valuable painting he owns.
A.P. Picked it up at an auction a couple of months ago.
paid a little over $50 million for it.
now you said that these doors were, uh, closed before you got here?
uh, the office is always locked up when A.P.'s not here.
it's a strict rule that A.P. Has when he's gone.
and Mr. Lashley... What would he have been doing here?
no idea. His office is two floors down.
he had no reason to be here.
maybe he was involved.
if we're lucky, we'll find the murder weapon.
this was obviously a well-planned robbery.
why is that obvious?
well, nobody finds themselves in a locked room full of old masters in the middle of the night by accident, do they?
so well-planned, but they weren't expecting to meet any opposition.
otherwise, Mr. Lashley here would have been shot or tasered or tied up and gagged.
but when they were surprised by him, they simply hit him on the head,
which suggests an improvised weapon, yeah?
I'm listening.
Yes, something like...
I predict forensics will find traces of Harry Lashley on this bust.
no offense, but I used to be police myself, and that's not police work. That's guessing.
Carl, bag this for me. - Yes. sir.
Frank. Is there a good diner around here?
uh, yeah. Garrity's, a couple of blocks over on... Madison.
do they do good eggs?
I guess. - That's the test of a good diner... Eggs.
you must have had a contentious relationship with your father.
excuse me? Uh, no.
tell me... I can't tell with the hair in her face and the sobbing,
but, uh, I imagine miss Duane is quite attractive, isn't she?
I mean, receptionists are often hired for their looks.
what are you talking about? - Where are you going with this?
this way. Look at the seams.
these shoulder seams here... Pulled apart...
and the way he's lying so straight like this, and that shoe that has come off.
no, we all noticed. Somebody must have dragged him here.
Yes, but dragged him from where? And why?
care to tell us, Frank?
I don't know what you're talking about.
all right, then let me explain.
you and miss Duane came up here to have sex in the boss' office.
that's absurd. Why would I do such a stupid thing?
well, because it's forbidden, and thus, very sexy, of course,
especially if you have father issues.
and who doesn't?
it's a furtive but powerful challenge to the paternal authority.
so you open up A.P.'s office and then, "crap. There's a dead body. What are we gonna do?
you gotta report it, but how do you explain your presence in his office?
a quick but dirty solution...
you drag the body out and lock the doors back up before calling the police.
who is this guy?
he's a pain in the ass, but he's making sense.
you sure you don't want to change your statement? - No.
Oh, please, Frank, it'd be silly to deny it.
five minutes in a room with the persuasive agent Cho,
and miss Duane will tell all.
back off, man.
I want to. Believe me. I have zero interest in your sex life.
but one thing that occurs to me...
a room like this would have security cameras in it, yeah?
Yes.
but surely, you wouldn't knowingly record yourself making love on the boss' carpet.
you'd have to know that the cameras in the room were off,
probably because you turned them off, being the head of security.
they are off, aren't they, Frank?
so the question now is, Frank, how long have they been off,
and who else might have known they were gonna be off last night?
you guys can take it from here. I am starving.
gotta get me some eggs. Garrity's, right? Thanks.
you ready to tell us the truth?
Hey, look at this.
it's known as "the Moro," from 14th century Italy.
it's a portrait of somebody named Carlotta Moro.
it's the only known works of an artist known as the "siennese master.
it's been owned by two popes, the king of France and John Jacob Astor, among others.
but A.P.Caid bought it for $50 million 3 months ago.
what do we know about Caid?
apart from he's an idiot with his money?
like the cover says, he got his start as a roughneck in the oil fields
then turned into a wildcatter and made a fortune by the time he was 30.
he's a tough guy.
his trick's pulling oil out of places nobody else has the balls to go.
where is he now?
he's somewhere on a sailboat. He's been told what's going on.
he's coming back as quick as he can.
I was thinking, it would have been easy for him to sail up or down the coast a few miles,
put into a small marina and come back and commit the crime without anybody else knowing.
and why would he want to do that?
I'm just saying he could.
maybe he wants the insurance money or he wants to get rid of Harry.
doesn't like that he's married to his daughter.
did you check with Caid's security team?
everybody at the company that didn't wear a suit knew all about Frank Schiappa
and his use of A.P.'s office.
any number of people might have known the cameras were off last night.
sounds like we're gonna have to check out any number of people.
Where's Jane? - I don't know.
well, find him.
I'm gonna go and talk to Lashley's wife.
you guys give Caid's personnel files a good hard look.
see if there's any criminal connections, especially Harry Lashley.
do you think he's dirty?
well, he's involved.
why else would he be there in the middle of the night?
it doesn't feel real.
if it wasn't for you people, I wouldn't believe it.
Harry's going to walk through the door, and this is all just a strange dream.
but here you are. Harry's dead.
when was the last time you spoke to him?
yesterday afternoon.
just chitchat, where to go for dinner.
then he left me a message canceling, didn't say why.
that wasn't unusual, canceling without giving any reason?
no. Harry was very hardworking, very keen.
stuff would come up all the time.
what was his job here exactly?
good question.
he was a sort of jack-of-all-trades for my father,
did whatever he needed from week to week.
my father liked having someone on hand with no ties or friendships within the company.
that's a tough assignment.
Yes.
but he only joined the company when we were married.
he was... Learning the ropes.
your father didn't want Harry to have a soft ride just 'cause he was your husband.
Yes, you could put it like that.
what was his previous employment?
he was a musician. Jazz guitarist.
Yes. How did you know that?
I looked at his fingers... Guitarist fingers.
jazz with a flamenco edge, judging by the ridge on his thumb.
Yes.
he was playing a gig at one of these ghastly, uh, events you have to go to,
and you struck up a conversation.
you love jazz, so you could talk with him easily, which, uh, normally,
is quite difficult for you out side of business.
I... W... Yes. That's... But...
I'm sorry, miss Caid. He's just showing off.
c-can you think of any reason why Harry would have been on this floor at that time of night?
no.
uh, he would have known that neither I nor my father were here.
so?
I understand from my understand from my assistant
that Frank Schiappa's misbehavior was an open secret amongst the junior staff.
he's no longer a Caid employee, by the way.
perhaps Harry had found out, and he was trying to catch him.
perhaps.
or is it possible that he had prior knowledge that the theft was gonna take place?
you're asking if he could have been complicit in the theft?
Yes, I am.
no. He was honest and gentle. No.
so he never talked to you about the painting?
no. I didn't approve of buying it.
$50 million is far too much money to spend on a single object.
when it comes to art, rational arguments don't apply for him.
that would be Kathryn Hawkes' area of expertise.
Kathryn Hawkes? She is...
she buys the art for my father's collection.
it's a terrible tragedy. Terrible.
did you know Mr. Lashley?
not well. I mean, I knew of him, obviously, but, uh, the poor man. It's very sad.
but you think the loss of the painting is the real tragedy here.
well, no. Every human life is a sacred thing.
but "the Moro" is a uniquely beautiful treasure, beyond precious.
you know the art market.
who would be willing and able to steal such a high-end piece?
worldwide, there's probably a good hundred collectors with the resources
and passion enough to do something like this,
but it's public knowledge that Mr. Caid outbid Shirali Arlov to get the "the Moro.
Mr. Arlov is not pleased.
Shirali Arlov... The Russian oil baron? - Him.
Arlov is a nasty piece of work.
he has a legit front as an oilman, but he's a super rich gangster, basically.
they say he likes his business rivals to be delivered to him hog-tied And naked so he can kill 'em personally.
vicious, reedy and the owner of the finest collection of renaissance paintings in Russia.
sounds likes our kinda guy.
talk to the organized crime boys upstairs.
find out who Arlov's connections are in California,
who he'd use for a job like this and where they were last night.
you got it, boss.
what do you have?
Harry Lashley has a past.
ten years ago in Canada, he stole cash from a video store he was working at.
busted and served six months.
damn. I was hoping he was clean.
Yeah, I know.
then I tried to find any connection he had to the art world, and this popped up.
a month ago, he paid a company called R.W.Arts $20, 000.
that's pretty much the only financial transaction he's made recently.
what's R.W.Arts?
I don't know yet. Shell, probably.
the address is just a mailbox in Lockesdale, a little farming town up north.
that's interesting. Uh, let's Van Pelt and I go up and take a look-see.
you and Van Pelt?
well, she's from a small farming town. Aren't you?
Yes, I am.
right. Well, that's what you guys call, uh, what is it? Cover.
what do you need cover for? You're a CBI operative.
uh, I thought I was a "consultant.
just follow procedure. Have fun.
Where's the fun in that? Shall we?
how cute is this?
it sure doesn't look like the lair of high-end art thieves.
not at all. Flowers and fruit...
rob Wallace Gallery and Framing.
bingo.
uh, let's not start with the badge.
let's get the lay of the land first, then we use the badge if we have to.
well, okay.
but don't embarrass me. - What do you mean?
you know what I mean. - No. What do you mean?
morning, folks.
look around, make yourself at home.
will do.
I know what you're thinking.
you do?
Oh, no. - Well, she is.
I'll let you in on a little secret.
I was her college professor, seduced her.
no kidding.
her parents hated it. A lot of drama.
totally worth it, though. Right, babe?
okay, that's what I mean. Come on. Stop it.
Oh, that's good. He's good.
yeah? - Yeah, you bet.
no. - Who's the boss in this relationship?
he's just playing the fool. Stop it now.
okay, turn just a little to your left. There. Good.
looks good.
uh, just... Just make sure you don't do her eyes too close together.
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm getting in your space.
uh, where's your facilities?
down the hall, door on the right.
okay. All right. - Okay.
just not too close, you know? You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
just, uh, passing through town, are you?
Yes, uh, just passing through.
you have an excellent nose.
thank you.
how long have you lived here?
all my life.
do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
that depends, I suppose.
uh, uh, go ahead.
how lo have you and Patrick been together?
um, not long.
okay, I'm just gonna say it.
are you sure about marrying this guy?
I mean, he kinda appears to be a jerk. I mean, no offense.
on, no. Yes. I-I'm not marrying him. That's... No.
don't worry about that. Not gonna happen.
hello.
turn your head just to the left a little bit.
just a little bit more. A little bit more to your left.
just, uh, that's great. Hold that, okay?
look down. Hold that.
this way, I'm gonna have a lot of light on your cheekbones.
you're gonna be so amazed with how good this looks...
the facial structure.
move. Move.
Mr. Wallace, if you'd just let me show you my badge, we from the California Bureau of Investigation.
our office knows we're here.
if you kill us, they'll know who did it.
kill you? Why would I want to kill you?
you're cops? - Well, she...
we're investigating the murder of Harry Lashley.
Lashley's dead?
what happened? I...
we were hoping you might be able to tell us that, considering you have the stolen painting.
uh, no, that's... That's a copy.
Mr. Wallace here is a-an art forger, a very...Very good one, by the way.
um, that's a copy. He's not a thief.
well, give me the shotgun.
Mr. Lashley came to me a couple of months ago and commissioned two copies of "the Moro.
how did he find you?
people who need my services tend to find me eventually.
it's not a crime, what I do.
if you have a valuable painting, it's only sensible to have a copy made for the display,
so that way, the real thing's safe.
he picked up the copies about a month ago.
so you gave him two copies already?
what's this one for?
this one I did for myself.
it's a beautiful picture. I'd come to love her.
why did he want two copies?
he didn't say. - And you didn't ask questions.
he paid me $10, 000 for each of them, so no, I didn't ask any questions.
how do we know this isn't the real thing?
I'm not a forger. I'm an artist.
I'm not trying to trick anyone. Okay?
I always added detail that ensures that nobody can sell my work as the genuine article.
that's very ethical of you.
it looks pretty much exactly the same to me.
no, he's telling the truth. Take a closer look.
what am I looking for? - Closer.
Oh, I still don't...
you're getting warmer.
a TV aerial.
Yes. - They didn't have TV.
no. Beautiful work.
may I borrow it for a while?
uh, I don't know about that. How... How do I know I'm gonna get it back?
uh, let me put it another way.
lend it to me or agent Van Pelt here will take you and the painting back to Sacramento
and keep you there and ask you mind-numbing questions for hours and hours on end.
thank you.
copies, huh? Clever.
Harry and his accomplices steal the painting once, but they get to sell it three times.
Hey, boss. A.P.Caid's back from his trip.
he's on his way back to his office.
no, no, no. You got it all wrong.
see, I told harry to get a copy made on the hush-hush.
I mean, what kind of idiot is gonna put $50 million on his wall so anybody can steal it? Huh?
so the painting that was stolen is a fake?
damn right, it was.
now the real one is in my... Private vault.
with all due respect, A.P. the art here is my responsibility.
Kathryn, the fewer people who knew, the better.
besides, it paid off, didn't it, huh?
I mean, right now there's some thieving son of a bitch out there
who spent a whole lot of money on junk.
daddy, Harry's dead.
Oh, baby, I know. I'm sorry. I know.
it's too sad, but, uh, you know, I did like that kid.
can we see the painting?
you want to see my baby? I'll open the vault.
ain't she a beauty?
you, uh, mind if I take a closer look? - No. Oh, yeah, yeah.
a masterpiece of quattrocento portraiture, one of a kind.
$50 million right there.
it's about $10, 000 right there. It's a fake.
the hell it is. - Fake as a $6 bill.
that's not funny, son.
take a look back here by the trees, the guys on horseback.
the third one in from the left, next to the footmen...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see the horses. What...
what do you think, is that an M16 or a kalashnikov?
son of a bitch.
Yeah, I think it's a kalashnikov.
son of a bitch. There's...
there's a machine gun in my painting. How in the hell could you not notice that?
if this bozo here can see it, why couldn't you?
A.P. I can assure you, the painting... - No, no, no, no.
you're the one who has the good eye.
no, you brought me a fake.
Mr. Caid, I can state with absolute certainty the painting
which I purchased for you and placed in your hands was genuine.
I have the documents to prove it.
if you chose to engage in some clever subterfuge without my knowledge,
I can hardly be blamed for the results.
excuse me. - Harry. That son of a bitch Harry...
he switched out the real painting for the fake one.
and then bludgeoned himself to death, I suppose? You have no basis for that.
that was probably one of his crackhead musician friends he brought along.
you don't know that. That's not fair.
were you aware he spent time in prison?
6 months for theft in Canada, 10 years ago.
Yes. I mean, no, I didn't.
um, I-I'm sure it doesn't...
uh, I'm sure it's not...
it was ten years ago. - I knew it.
I knew it. This guy was no good for you.
I could feel it, but I kept quiet, didn't I?
for your sake, I forced myself to trust this guy.
because you finally had yourself a man.
he stole $50 million from me.
damn it, Stevie.
please. I beg you. Find my husband's murderer.
that's what we're trying to do, ma'am.
they'll tell you the truth. I want the truth.
you can go now.
that's all we need at the moment. We'll be in touch.
right.
uh, I hate to be blunt, Mr. Caid, but you're just...
let's... Oh, no, you don't. - We'll... We'll talk later.
Harry has copies made, but he doesn't hang one on the wall to disguise the robbery. Why?
because it was part of the plan.
everyone has to know the painting was stolen for him to have anything to sell.
the painting has to be missing.
so he makes the switch, goes to steal the real painting off the wall,
knowing frisky Frank has turned the cameras off.
so who kills him then?
whoever ended up delivering the painting to a buyer.
Harry outlived his usefulness the minute he used his security pass to get into A.P.'s office.
well, we just heard from the organized crime boys about Shirali Arlov.
we did? - Yeah.
the good news is he's in California... L. A. He arrived a couple of days ago.
well, that can't be a coincidence.
all right, what's the bad news?
the bad news is he's traveling on a diplomatic passport.
we cannot touch him under any circumstances.
if we could just ask him a couple questions...
state department was crystal clear... Keep away.
Arlov controls an oil pipeline route this country needs.
it's a national security issue.
another argument for energy independence there.
Where's he staying?
I repeat, do not touch.
Oh, no, no. No touching. I promise.
Nope, not yet, no, and Minelli says no, too. That's four nos.
Minelli always says no. It's his job.
and it's my job to listen to him.
you'd walk away?
if Arlov is our man, you'd let him get away with murder?
he didn't do the murder.
he probably bought the painting from the murderer.
we'll never know unless we go talk to him.
we're gonna close this case, but not by causing an international scandal.
Arlov's the key.
I want to get Harry Lashley's killer as much as you do, but we cannot go after Arlov.
the state department... - A fig to the state department.
Yeah, I agree. Screw 'em.
that attitude is why I'm in charge and you guys aren't.
and would you please leave some of those for everybody else?
they're so small.
I just don't understand why a law officer can't go after a known criminal.
damn right.
if we left now, we could be in L.A.before dark. - What?
tell Cho to meet us in the parking lot in ten minutes.
Hello? - You ready?
Yeah.
are you ready? - I'm ready. What's the signal?
she is beautiful. - Good.
let's do this.
uh, could you tell Mr. Arlov Patrick Jane is here?
I have "the Moro" portrait that was stolen a couple days ago.
I'd like to sell it to him.
what?
let him come in.
thank you.
good evening.
please sit.
world's best collisions." You know this show?
no.
Oh, you should check it out. It's, uh, very amusing and, uh, educational.
it's a lesson for us all.
anytime, anyplace, boom...
your life can be over. That's very true.
would you like a drink, a snack?
uh, yes. Um, sparkling water. Please.
no ice, room temperature.
where is everyone?
weird. They all called in to sign out.
Jane wasn't feeling well, Rigsby's got a hot date, and Cho got kings tickets.
son of a... - What?
Jane doesn't get sick, Rigsby's not on a date because he's in love with you, - And the Kings aren't playing tonight. - You know about that?
Yeah, they're on an east coast road trip.
they're playing the Knicks tomorrow night.
no, I mean, about Rigsby... How do you know about that?
everybody knows that. The attorney general knows that.
I'm so embarrassed. - Please.
pick up the phone, damn it.
thank you.
so...
Mr. Patrick Jane.
you have a painting you want to sell me?
the Carlotta Moro"?
Yes.
I don't believe you.
would you like to take a look?
sure.
are you mad? - No, I'm just kidding. Kidding.
it's just a prop to get me into the room.
I am aware that you have the real painting.
Oh, really? You are aware?
and how are you aware of this?
a guess, confirmed by a predatory smile on your face
when you asked me about it just then.
you enjoy trapping people in nets of their own making, don't you?
that's... That's, um, that's very perceptive of you.
not really.
most successful criminal bosses share a similar profile...
sadistic, violent, but also highly methodical and psychologically astute.
why are you here, Mr. Jane?
I'm a detective of sorts.
explain. - I'm trying to find out who killed Harry Lashley.
who?
the man who died in the course of the painting's theft.
Oh, yes, yes, I recall. Poor fellow.
if you're looking for a bribe, I'm afraid, um, you're running out of luck.
you see, uh, you do understand that I have immunity from prosecution in this country?
I know, I know. No touching.
I show you my identification to discourage you from killing me or torturing me or something.
you might not get arrested for it, but you sure will make some kind of a fuss.
Oh, I don't mind fuss, you know?
anything to avoid boredom.
given your immunity, you could tell me who you bought the painting from and do no harm to yourself.
and inform to the police? Why?
why on earth would I do that?
Harry Lashley didn't deserve to die.
he has a wife who needs to know what happened. She deserves justice.
are you serious? "she deserves justice," huh?
perhaps you haven't paid the full price for the painting yet.
perhaps an arrest would save you some... Money.
Oh, well, that's... That's not a bad thought.
but you see, I-I love my art collection.
I-I love beauty.
it's why I do what I do, you know?
who would want to sell to me if I start sending my suppliers to jail, you know?
true. Well, I thought it was worth a try.
thank you, and I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. Not at all.
you are a very... Very strange kind of policeman.
it's been most diverting.
could I see it before I leave... The Moro?
I'm told it's very beautiful.
Oh, you... You appreciate art, huh?
why not? Of course.
what's happening?
soon. Get ready.
here you go. Look at that. It's a... an Italian silk merchant's wife.
it's 600 years old. It's... And it's alive.
it's... It's immortal.
may I?
please. Please.
now I understand why you went to such lengths to get her.
she is beautiful. - Now.
everybody out. Out. Out. Out.
please, out. Out. Out!
out!
well? Well? - Yes!
you better call Lisbon, give her an update.
you call her.
Oh, I can't. I'm driving. Cho? - No way.
Oh, come on, guys. I just robbed a Russian mobster. You can't call Lisbon?
you gonna be grumpy like this in the room? - Yes, I am.
I'm just asking. I don't think it's very professional.
seriously, don't push me. - I said I was sorry.
you had express orders to stay away from Arlov.
but that's why I didn't tell you. You have total deniability.
but that's beside the point.
the point is, my brilliant plan worked like clockwork.
what plan? This case is not closed. You haven't done anything yet.
not yet, but you watch.
no, I disagree.
morning!
I'll get back to you.
what the hell?
you got it back. Giving her to me.
Oh, baby!
this is fabulous. Was it Arlov? Did he have it?
Yes, it was.
how did you get it back?
I stole it. - Are you serious?
well, there was nothing we could do legally, as you said.
but Arlov was in possession of a stolen painting.
so there was nothing he could do either.
this gets better and better.
first of all, I get the painting back.
second, when Arlov finds out that I've got it, it'll kill him.
who cares about Arlov?
who cares about the damn painting?
you assured me you would find Harry's killer.
we're doing everything we can, Stevie, but there's not a lot left for us to do.
look, Stevie, I know you loved him.
and I liked him, too, but he was part of this theft.
he betrayed me.
in a way, this is a good thing that he's gone,
because you could be having children with this bum right now. All right?
you think of that. We dodged a bullet here.
come on, give me a hug.
look, we're gonna find you a good man.
the main thing is we sent out a message here that nobody messes with A.P. Caid.
thank you, thank you.
I had a daughter once.
she died. Killed. It was my fault.
that's how I know that a man who treats his only daughter the way you do is a fool.
Jane. - What did you say?
your child is hurting, and you're crowing over this petty victory like a cockerel on a dung heap.
you're a blind, vain, emotionally stunted fool.
you care more about this...
for this painting, for all this rubbish...
than you do the child that loves you.
you found my painting. I am grateful.
and now I'm going to be patient and tell you, you get this clown out of my office...
how am I gonna make you understand? - Right now.
how am I gonna make you understand? See this?
Jane... - See this?
this is nothing. It's nothing.
what are you doing? - Jane!
don't! - What are you, nuts?
Jane? Jane, have you gone crazy?
Oh, no, no. I'm just doing my job. Look.
you'd think that someone that has dedicated their lives to fine art would want to save a masterpiece from burning up. Wouldn't you?
unless she already knew it was just another fake.
no, not at all. I'm just... I'm just shocked, that's all.
is it a fake? - Yes, it is.
I only found out after I stole it, but Kathryn knew, because it was she who stole the original,
and it is she who still has it in her safe possession.
no. - Is that true, Kathryn?
no.
horrible job you found for yourself, Kathryn...
helping a greedy egotist snatch up beautiful things he has no ability to appreciate.
and you don't get paid much, do you?
all the money, beauty around you, and you can't have any of it.
very frustrating.
not at all.
Harry came to you for advice about the painting.
you asked him to make a second copy for your own personal use.
did you blackmail him? Huh?
must've known about the theft conviction in Canada, threatened to tell A.P.
and destroy the life he was building with Stevie.
care to comment on that?
it's all nonsense, A.P. It's nonsense.
Oh, is it? The reason you had two copies made...
so that you could sell one to Arlov, and you could keep the original picture for yourself because, Of course, you're the only one that really deserves it.
it was her? She did it?
Yes. Like I switched the paintings with Arlov,
she switched the original with Harry's right before it went into the vault.
all you had to do was come up in here after hours and take it off the wall.
but Harry suspected something, didn't he?
he tried to stop you...
and you killed him.
tell the truth, Kathryn. Our people are going through your apartment right now.
they will find that painting even if they have to tear the place to the ground.
there is no point in lying anymore.
I'm sorry.
I never meant to kill him.
why did he try to stop me?
No! - No, no, baby. No, baby, don't.
it was an accident.
Kathryn, you're under arrest for the murder of Harry Lashley.
put your hands behind your back. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
it was a mistake.
come on. Let's go.
uh, for what it's worth, I, uh, I just wanted to apologize for my pious rant earlier.
I needed a pretext to burn the picture, and...
your family dysfunction became it.
well, no, sir. No apology needed.
there was some good, hard truth in what you said.
Yes, there was, but you know, no one likes to be too judgmental.
hard to believe it's a fake.
crazy, isn't it?
one painting's worth $50 million, the other's only worth a few thousand.
they look identical. - Yep. Crazy.
not that you mention it, I'm not sure, uh...
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental Acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of Thoughts and behavior.
we've got Claire Wolcott-- female, caucasian, 32 years old.
she was found shot to death in her room.
her husband's got friends at the governor's office, So he called in some favors.
he wants the investigation to be e pt discreet and low-key.
his wife gets murdered and his priority is discretion?
okay.
Yep, mrs. Wolcott was cheating on mr. Wolcott...
which makes mr. Wolcott suspect number one.
number two.
number one would be mrs. Wolcott's mystery lover.
the room was registered In Claire Wolcott's name, so no help there.
at 2: 24 a. m.hotel staff and guests heard three gunshots,
but they didn't know where they were coming from.
15, 20 minutes later, they come here and call 9-1-1.
found a shell.
looks like a 9-millimeter.
and another.
mark 'em for forensics.
so the lover didn't do it.
because?
the, uh, shell casing things Indicate the shooter was across the room here.
he or she stepped in from outside And started blasting away.
if the lover had done it, he'd have been closer to the victim,
and he wouldn't have had to shoot as manyimes.
and look.
circular, Which means a vertical drip From someone standing right here, bleeding. Right?
not spatter from the victim.
you're a forensics expert now?
so Claire and mystery lover are asleep.
someone comes in through the open door, Shoots them, leaves.
poor lover is woken by a bullet, Claire dead next to him.
freaks out.
but nobody comes right away.
mystery lover, who is only slightly wounded, Gets to thinking maybe the best tng to do is just...
slip away, out here.
you two finish up here. - Yes, boss.
here.
there you go.
clean one.
anything else? - No.
doc lady.
the silver caddy arrived last night at 2: 31.
that's about seven and a half minutes After the shooting took place.
name and room number?
open it.
wake up. - Oh, my god. Who are you?
it's all right, ma'am. We're cbi.
we need to talto you, sir.
what's this about?
take a wild guess.
put your hands in the air. - Okay.
I'm, uh, I'm not under arrest, am i?
cause I've done nothing wrong.
pants on. We'll talk after.
this is Kevin Haightly, resort manager.
um, I know we can't expect to get the room back,
but when might the walkway be open for use, do you think?
that depends on when forensics is done.
we'll let you know. - Okay. Thanks.
it was a cold night, so we lit a fire and made love.
we went to sleep afterwards, and suddenly there was, Like, a sharp pain and bang!
I wake up, And there's blood everywhere and I'm shot in the arm And claire's dead.
you know, I freaked.
you didn't see who did it? - No.
why'd you leave? - Claire was dead.
I couldn't help her, And I couldn't help you guys.
I didn't see anything, so...
you know, what could I contribute?
she's a married woman.
Yeah, we know that.
and Jill Rubenstein-- What's your connection with her?
the doctor lady? And asked her for help.
a complete stranger takes you to her room,
treats your wound and then has sexual intercourse with you?
what can I say? The hippocratic oath is a beautiful thing.
how well did you know Claire Wolcott?
uh, I don't really know her that well.
I met her just a few weeks ago. She was at a bar, and I picked her up.
since then, I've seen her occasionally for sex.
is that what happened last night? - Yeah.
I called and asked her to meet me for a drink. We came here.
did anybody else know you were here? - Nobody. Just me and Claire.
and how long had you been in the room?
um, a few hours.
I'd agreed to, uh, you know, stay the night.
I was fond of Claire, And it's a long drive home, so I stayed.
I don't normally do that. - No? What--what's your normal procedure?
after lovemaking? Depends on the type of woman.
so you've got it down to a science.
I'm good at what I do.
okay, mr. Fricke, and what is it that you do?
I'm a pickup artist.
a, uh, woman whisperer, if you will.
a pickup artist-- that's your profession?
you sound like my mom.
um, it's more of a total lifestyle kind of thing. You know?
I-I practi my art, of course. That's my passion.
but I teach and I blog also, Um, conduct seminars, workshops, that sort of thing.
is that good money? - Not bad.
and do you take money from the women you pick up?
sometimes, when I need to.
did you take money from Claire Wolcott? - No. No.
like I say, I was fond of claire.
um, I planned to see her again.
you really only want to monetize as an exit strategy.
Paul, is your mother still alive?
I know where you're going with this, dr. Freud, And, uh, ou're wrong.
my mom's dead, as it goes, But, uh, I loved her dearly, and she loved me.
who said anything about your mother?
you just did. - No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. - Didn't.
what are you talking about? - I'm just kidding. Just playing with you, Paul.
just kidding, mucking around.
Yeah. Are we done here?
do you know who killed Claire?
no.
interesting.
he's either a habitual liar telling the truth Or he's an honest man lying.
do you keep a list of your pickups?
Yeah, of course. I, uh, I have 'em here.
names, numbers and a 1 to 10 grading system.
nice. Something to show your grandkids.
we're gonna need you to forward a copy of that list to us.
Yeah, sure.
what, you think maybe this was a jealous ex-lover?
could be.
I say we bring him in anyway, for creepiness.
which should be a criminal offense, but isn't.
he could have shot her, then shot himself to cover it up.
he simply could have shot her and left.
he didn't have the gun on him, Every inch of this place and found nothing.
he's clean.
maybe someone's
not likely.
the room was registered In Claire Wolcott's name.
no one else knew he was there.
what was she thinking?
she was so beautiful, and he's so... Creepy.
Yeah, that dr. Rubenstein was hot, too. How does he do it?
all you need is a basic understanding Of the evolutionary psychology of women,
rigorously and fearlessly applied.
you gotta know what buttons to press.
like we're toasters? - Like men don't have buttons, too?
men are li toaoasts. Women--a little more like, uh, accordions.
I thought that was a compliment.
Mr. Wolcott? Thank you for coming. I'm so sorry for your loss.
the effects you requested-- Photos, video of claire.
we'll return this to you as soon as possible.
I was just upstairs Speaking with my friend the attorney general,
and I told him that I will not rest Until the man who did this is brought to justice.
I will not rest.
I know I can expect the same from you and your people.
I assure you This unit does the best we can with every case we run.
Cho?
if it's convenient, Agent Cho would like to ask you a few questions.
when did you speak to your wife last?
I was in Can Francisco on a business dinner.
I called Claire around midy, Told her I'll probably be staying in town that night.
did you? Stay the night in town?
I did.
did she say where she was going or who she was meeting?
no, but I didn't ask.
so you didn't know she was at the spa?
I wouldn't expect to know. She often went up there on a whim.
can you think of anyone
no. No, she was, um... Harmless.
any friends or family that might be in any trouble?
she's from back east. She doesn't have any family or friends out here.
she shopped and she played tennis and she went to the spas.
no one would have any motives...
yes?
I recall she fired an assistant last month.
caught her stealing jewelry. I believe she was pressing charges.
name?
Natalie... Something. My people will have her details.
are you aware that on the night of her murder, Your wife was meeting a lover?
Yes.
the local authorities told me they suspected as much.
did you know she had a lover? Prior to her death, I mean?
no. Do you have a name? I mean, is he a suept?
we have a name.
who is he? - I'm not at liberty to say.
I want his name.
you can't have it.
are you sure, agent Cho?
because I can make one phone call, And your career is toast.
that's impressive. The best I can get with one call is a pizza.
now this business dinner you were at in San Francisco,
what's the timing on that, and who else was there?
my people can give you times, names and numbers. We're done here.
thanks for your cooperation.
Wolcott's wife was so pretty.
what do you see?
nice shoes, loneliness.
where we going?
Natalie Edreau? - Yes?
we're with the cbi. Can we come in?
look, I already told the cops I didn't steal anything from that bitch.
by "bitch," are you referring
Yeah. So?
she was murdered last night.
how long did you work for Claire Wolcott?
about a year... Till she turned psycho.
she claimed that you stole jewelry from her.
Yeah. She was wrong. I didn't steal anything.
Claire pressed charges against you. How'd that make you feel?
excuse me, are you trying to say that I killed her?
do you own a gun, Natalie?
Oh, my god. This is really stupid.
um, no, I don't own a gun.
and, no, I didn't kill Claire.
where were you last night?
I was hanging out with my roommate till about 9: 00 or so.
then, uh, then I went out for dinner.
What'd you have? For dinner?
what does that have to do with anything?
the chopped salad at pastucci's.
Yes. There's something on this side of the room You don't want us to find.
what is that?
nothing. There's nothing.
look me in the eye and say that.
whatever. Search all you want.
too much stuff. You're not very tidy.
good in bed I expect, yeah?
messy women make good lovers. Can I hold your hand?
I-- - Shush.
camera.
okay, those are personal, so
is it...
Claire Wolcott and her lover Paul Fricke...
time-stamped two hours before the murder.
these are the photos we pulled from your digital camera.
a couple hours after these were taken, Claire Wolcott was dead.
that doesn't prove anything.
opportunity and motive. You were close by when she died.
and the theft charge she laid on you dies with her.
that was a garbage charge. I wasn't worried about that.
no? - No.
you didn't steal jewelry from her?
please. She dressed like a mormon call girl.
I wouldn't want her jewelry if you paid me.
I didn't ask if I asked if you stole it.
no, I didn't.
why were you photographing her?
now think this through, Natalie. We're investigating murder.
if you have an explanation for these That doesn't involve killing her,
you should tell us, get yourself off the hook.
I thought If I threatened to tell her husband about the affair,
then she would drop the theft charges.
that's what the pictures are for.
how do you know
it was obvious.
she kept sending me out to buy men's gifts.
you know, like, watches and ties.
I knew it wasn't for her husband. I'm not an idiot.
what did Claire say when you confronted her about it?
I didn't confront her about it.
she left with that flugly guy before I got the chance.
probably wouldn't have worked anyway. - Why not?
because Keith Wolcott is, like, super controlling, Especially about money.
he probably knew all along his wife was sleeping around.
what's the verdict? - I'm not liking her for this.
but we should talk to the roommate, Make sure her alibi stands up.
the husband, on the other hand-- He is the type to know about his wife's affairs.
his business dinner Couldn't have made it back to Calistoga to kill her.
he's also the type That'll hire other people to do his dirty work.
Yes. He is. And they don't take credit cards.
I'll look
boring.
okay, mr. Entertainment. What do you want to do?
I wanna go back to the crime scene.
that hotel room--there is something that just isn't right.
you're up.
great.
something's not quite right.
don't take too long. I'm hungry.
let's go eat.
good to see you again. So... Is there any news?
the owner keeps asking me When we'll be able to reopen the villa.
no news. We're here for lunch.
Absolutely. One moment.
Oh, look who's here.
Ah, just the man. I have a question I need to ask him.
right this way.
thank you. - Thank you.
table four needs fresh drinks, okay? - Yes, sir.
my old friends from the cbi. Come, have a seat.
surprised to see you back here so soon.
it's my number one hunting ground, Loaded with my kind of women
beautiful, rich, married and unhappy.
so you specialize?
sure. Yeah.
some guys will tell ya hot, young singles are the real test.
but I'm not in this to win a points contest, you know?
Plus, I like the gratitude you get from the older ladies.
a woman died--a woman that you were close to.
doesn't that give you pause?
sure it does. Yeah, I have feelings.
but having this gunshot wound? Genius opener.
an opener?
you know, a prop or a line you use to start a conversation.
you can't just go up and say,"hey, what's your name?"
no? - Duh.
so how do you do it exactly? You know, pick up women.
need some help, huh? - No.
big handsome dude like you?
I got a few basic techniques That will turn you into a freakin' sex machine.
a machine.
well, I'm not looking to be a machine so much.
I'm more of a steady relationship kind of guy.
when you're scoring With a different super fox every night,
what do you want a relationship for?
do you ever fall in love With any of these different super foxes you score with?
never.
love is for guys who can't get laid.
so, uh, what's your basic technique?
Oh, there's a thousand ways to seduce a woman.
all kinds of workable systems.
but they all boil down to three words
"contempt," "control," "excitement."
"contempt," "control," "e-excitement"?
women want men that don't neeor want them.
they want to be told what to do, And they want edge, adventure, drama.
whatever you wanna call it.
present that package to them, and they will bite. Guaranteed.
Ouch.
seriously, when you have one under your spell, Then you get up and leave.
L-leave? But
no, no, no, no. You leave. Trust me.
next time she sees you, she'll tear your clothes off. Guaranteed.
what's going on with you two? - Excuse me?
you and Katie here. You got something going on?
no. - no.
just askin'.
I used to let her sleep with me once in a while. That's all.
no, you had feelings for her.
years ago, maybe a little. Sure.
you know, before I got my mojo working.
thanks for talking to us, Paul.
Oh, you had one more question You wanted to ask.
Ahyes, s,tt's right. Thank you. I forgot
uh, the night that you were sleeping with claire, Was the patio door open or closed?
closed, I think.
thank you.
now I'm really hungry.
drive-thru. - Yep.
you think Fricke's right?
was the door closed?
Yes. It was a cold night. They lit a fire.
why would they leave the door open?
no, I mean, is he right about how to deal with women.
100% wrong.
unless, of course, you wanna have a lot of casual sex With total strangers.
then he's right.
when did you first meet Paul Fricke?
at a wine tasting event a friend was throwing.
and how long were you and he romantically involved?
three, maybe four hours.
so you didn't know Paul Fricke Prior to agreeing to spend the night with him?
no.
and you haven't spoken to him since?
what attracted you to him in the first place?
four times?
what exactly attracted you to Paul Fricke in the first place?
I don't know.
I guess there was just something about him.
and were you at all hurt or angry When the relationship ended?
mm, no.
I was disappointed more than anything.
we had a wonderful time together.
thank you for your time.
Oh, you'll, um, you'll tell him "hello" for me, won't you?
Yes.
Hey, how's it going? Any potential suspects? - Nope.
I'm bringing in the rest tomorrow.
there's more?
this is just "a" through "m." how's it going with you?
no unusual transactions for mr. Wolcott, But three days before she was killed,
Claire wolcott made a $200, 000 withdrawal In the form of a cashier's check,
made out to none other than Paul Fricke.
here's the best part-- according to the bank, Keith Wolcott set up the account so he'd be notified Whenever a large transaction took place.
meaning that Wolcott had to have known about the 200 grand.
exactly.
nice work. - Thanks.
come on.
darn it, woman! - said the redneck.
ain't you never seen a goat before?
he's handling his grief well.
excuse me, mr. Wolcott?
now's not a good time.
I'm sorry to intrude. We need to ask you some follow-up questions Regarding your previous statement.
I'll be happy to speak with you
Oh, this won't take long.
I told you--tomorrow morning, my office.
very good.
Mr. Wolcott, it's about your wife's lover.
we, uh, know about the $200, 000 she gave him, And we know that you know about it.
how dare you.
how dare I? Did I do something daring?
am I supposed to be afraid of you?
you're supposed to be respectful.
respectful? You contemptible little buffoon.
your wife just died, And you're swanning around in a monkey suit Drinking punch and laughing with your idiot friends, And you want respect?
there's your respect.
what? - You know damn well what. - You assaulted a man.
Oh, I just tweaked him on the nose.
technically, that's assault.
technically, he's an ass. He deserved it.
Yes, he is, but this is not a school yard.
you simply cannot do stuff like that.
I did. I did it, And the seas didn't boil and the sky didn't fall.
they will shortly. Wolcott is on his way down here with a $1, 000-an-hour lawyer.
if you give him a formal apology, He says he's willing to drop the whole matter.
hmm, let me think... No.
would you please be reasonable for once?
I'm busy. - Right.
I am. I'm just thinking that, uh...
he's gonna drop the whole matter in any case.
Oh, really?
I guarantee it. He's a shallow narcissist. It's all about image.
and this whole business makes him seem small and silly.
contempt, control, excitement. - What?
nothing.
this place is so nice.
$800 a night, minimum. Can you believe that?
Hello? What, you're not talking to me now?
you barely said a word the whole time.
I'll talk to you when you have something interesting to say.
fine. Be a jerk.
I'd go in, but I'd have to keep my injury dry.
gunshot wound.
don't worry. Uh, you're not in any danger.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Oh, not you guys again.
the old magic not working so good today, huh?
just like baseball.
most of the time, even in e major leagues, You, uh, swing and you miss.
gotta keep on swinging.
I hit on ten women a day.
I'm going to have sexual intercourse With at least one of them.
that is gross.
e's intrigued by me, this one.
she's just too proud to admit it.
Yeah, get your shoes on, romeo.
focus on the shoes.
you know, I didn't notice before. You're not bad-lookin'.
shoulders are a bit too wide, T, uh, otherwise, pretty nice.
you're kidding, right?
you're trying to hit on me?
what man in his right mind wouldn't want to hit on you?
okay, leave her alone. Get in the car.
I'm sorry. My colleague, agent Jane, refuses to apologize.
he says he's happy to see you in court.
and you refuse to talk to us, So I can't rule you out as a suspect.
I'm afraid this is gonna make a bit of a mess.
Keith, I suggest
no, no. I have nothing to hide.
what do you waa knknow
what do you know about your wife's affair with Paul Fricke?
I knew Claire was having an affair With this Fricke person, and I knew about the money She was gonna give him.
then why did you deny it?
it's not the sort of thing one likes to admit, now, is it?
and I knew it would make me a suspect, And that would be tedious.
did you confront her about Fricke?
no. I stopped the check immediately, of course.
and that was the end of it?
you weren't angry?
not at all. I was happy. I wanted to divorce her for ages.
Why?
she'd become irritating.
the cost of divorce always deterred me,
but her infidelity with Fricke Cut the payout she'd receive in half.
now if Claire had lived, come monday, She'd be in for a nasty surprise.
I was all set to serve her with divorce papers.
even cuckolded, she stood to get a big sum.
rich man like yourself-- Her death saved you a lot of money, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
but money isn't everything, is it?
I'm sorry she's dead-- truly sorry.
but every cloud, as they say.
well, I believe we're done here.
seems so.
you'll be hearing from the attorney general shortly Regarding mr. Jane's conduct.
Oh, I doubt it.
Really?
when you've thought about it, You'll see that this business makes you seem small and silly,
and you'll drop the whole matter.
you misled us, Paul. You were going to take money from Claire.
but I didn't, did I?
a business associate of mine Is opening up a new club here in town.
he, uh, offered me a role as partial owner If I could come up with a share of the building costs.
Claire was generous enough to offer me a loan.
And?
I went to deposit it just a couple days ago And was told that the check had been stopped.
that must have been What did Claire say?
she said it must be a mistake, And she'd take care of it monday.
did you believe her?
doesn't really matter.
you know what the best part about being me is?
no, I don't.
there are literally dozens of rich, needy women out there That, uh, I could go to for financial help.
I didn't need Claire's money.
uh, what's the story with Katie the waitress?
I'm in the middle of something.
I'm sorry. I was just thinking. I had a thought. Bear with me?
so Katie--tell me. - Nothing to tell.
used to be if I, uh, didn't score for whatever reason, I'd, uh, call her off the bench.
can't sleep alone, huh?
some people use cocoa and a good book.
I use beautiful women.
she must have been crazy about you To put up with a deal like that, huh?
I guess so.
difficult for her now to watch you pick up A different beautiful woman every night.
that's not how it is with me and Katie.
well, sure, it is. She loves you. That much is clear.
maybe that's what this is all about.
your behavior got too much for her.
Katie has absolutely nothing to do with this.
how can you be so sure?
I know Katie. She's a good person.
she would never hurt anyone.
okay, great. Thanks. You can go.
no. - Ah, sorry. I'm sorry.
when agent Cho says you can go, you can go.
not a moment sooner.
just give me one second.
Hey, you can't dismiss my subjects like that.
Oh, I know, and I took it back.
besides, we need him back out there in the saddle.
you will agree with me 100% when I explain my theory, My little plan.
do you have any good clothes?
I'm wearing them.
uh, do you have anything with a little more, uh... Zing?
no.
okay. Well...
I'm gonna have to take you shopping, Just you and me.
I'll wait for you. Right here.
I'm in position.
okay, look around for a likely target.
will do. Bourbon on the rocks. Make it a double.
those two will do, I gus. - Good.
okay, now listen up. Relax.
I'm gonna talk you right through this. Keep it smooth.
you have to be calm and confident.
Yeah, you told me that already. I have the general idea.
Hello, ladies, I'll be right with you.
start a tab for me, would you? Room 206. That's for you.
my name's Kimball. What are your names? You first.
Sara-Beth. - Hey, Sara-Beth. Tell me about yourselves.
what do you wanna know?
well, it's not exactly textbook, but he's figuring it out.
that worked? "hello, ladies"?
he's kicking it old-school.
there's Fricke. - Where?
let me see.
Cho, look, with the two blondes.
I don't believe this guy. I give up.
I do not understand women. Never have, never will.
seems like the dumber you treat them, The better they like it.
they'r drk women.
you can't generalize all women in general.
this is your fault. - No, it's not. I'm just sitting here.
you've worked a double today. Why don't you clock out and have a drink on the house?
Thanks, mr. H. That'd be good.
sure.
here we go. This is where we bring it.
time for phase two.
Roger that. Phase two coming up.
what's phase two?
let's go, Sara-Beth.
what did he say?
what did he say? I didn't hear.
uh, he said, uh...
you don't wanna know.
Oh, well.
struck out, huh?
I blew it, as usual.
I'm just unlucky in love. Always have been.
I know how that goes.
same story, huh?
same story.
that guy?
him.
you know, no offense, but I've been watching him Operate this evening, and he seems like kind of a creep.
a player, no doubt, but a creep.
this isn't who he is.
when we were together, He was a sweet, caring, generous man.
it was me that screwed it up.
and we had this terrible fight, And I said some mean things.
mean things.
all this is an attempt to prove me wrong, I guess.
if I had a woman like you in love with me, You could say whatever you like.
I wouldn't be running around.
that's nice of you to say. Thank you.
you know what we need to do?
you need to make him jealous.
let him see you out and about, Enjoying yourself with another man.
are you hitting on me?
Yes, I am. It's a good plan, isn't it?
the kid's a natural. Look at him. Look at him go. The Cho.
no business like Cho business.
here's the plan.
let's walk right past him, Laughing and smiling like we're on our way somewhere cool.
get him thinking.
and then what?
ll think of something.
all right. Let's do it. - After you.
okay, we're in the room.
Hey, Cho, that's some nice work. Very nice work.
so just sit tight. I don't think it's gonna take long.
you hope.
who are you talking to?
my colleagues.
okay. Who are they?
I'm a state agent, ma'am.
we're conducting an undercover operation Regarding the wolcott murder case.
I-I don't understand.
I apologize for the deception.
you mean... You're not... You don't... - No, ma'am.
I'm so embarrassed.
that's understandable.
nothing is happening.
you have to have patience, woman.
she just doesn't have any patience.
I'm not touching that one.
there.
come on.
drop the weapon. - Drop it, Haightly.
hands behind your back. Let's go.
you set me up.
Yes, we did.
how did you know it was me?
it was a cold night.
Fricke told us that the patio door in his room Was closed when he went to sleep, And I checked.
you can't open them from the outside, Which means that the killer must have entered
by the main door, which requires a key.
who has the keys? Staff.
who on the staff would wanna hurt Claire Wolcott?
I don't know. Nobody.
who would wanna hurt Paul Fricke?
maybe you.
but what reason would you have for hating Paul Fricke?
let me guess. Uh, something to do with a woman?
you hated him 'cause he used and abused her-- The woman you loved.
I'm not sorry. He's dirt.
the way he carried on with those other women-- Rubbing Katie's nose in it.
I never would hurt her like he did.
I wish I had killed him.
but you killed Claire Wolcott instead.
I never meant to do that.
I wanted to kill Fricke, Not Claire.
but she shouldn't have been doing what she Was doing, should she?
I mean, it's not like anybody cares. Her husband was going
I care. I care about Claire Wolcott. She was a living person.
that's enough. - No.
you took her life. I-I just... I think he should be sorry.
you're right.
well, do you wanna say it?
I'm sorry. - Thank you.
Where's Cho?
I don't know. Called him a couple times. No answer.
the problem is, I really love Paul.
I know how he seems, and I know how he's been, But at the end of the day,
when I think of who I really wanna be with, It's him.
that's crazy, huh?
love is crazy, I guess.
no, it isn't. You should seek psychiatric help.
you mind? - Not at all.
rough night?
Ah, not bad. Couple good phone numbers.
Yep. Two very tasty numbers.
I wish you'd stop being so damn stupid.
you have a good woman over there that knows you And still loves you.
excuse me.
you looked kinda lonely.
my friend and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm married.
wow, Scarlett just throws the best parties.
I'm gonna go find Asra. - Then I'll see who I can find.
there's Victor.
Aah!
call an ambulance!
mom.
no, Oscar, stay up there!
look at it, George.
beautiful, isn't it?
now relax.
don't you feel happy and relaxed?
Yes.
say it. Tell me how you feel.
happy and relaxed.
that's good.
that's very good.
so tell me, George, what's your date of birth?
I was born on the 1st of March 1980
and what's your mother's name?
that's... that's a very nice name.
she was a good woman.
she liked you to tell the truth, didn't she, George?
Yes.
so tell me, how did you murder Donovan Hobar...
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we just caught a red ball.
you gonna be much longer with this one? - Uh...
damn it, Jane. He's in a trance, isn't he?
Wha... I-I'd describe it - more as a-a deep relaxation. - Hypnotized. You hypnotized him.
well, I was doing a favor for the Organized Crime Unit. - Those cowboys?
time to go, guys. - You know, I was just about to get the truth out of him.
uh, he killed two people. If you walk very quietly to the door, - I still might... - How many times have I told you... no hypnotism?
it's illegal, and it's unethical, - and you cannot keep on doing it. - Just calm yourself, woman. It's no big thing.
Oh, really? This man's lawyer is right this minute coming down the hallway, wearing a mean face.
something tells me he'll argue that point with you. Let's go.
well, let me get him out of his trance first, huh? - Well, be quick about it.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to speak to my client alone. - Of course.
now. - George, nice to talk to you.
good luck with all your future endeavors.
that's mine.
so, George...
are you all right?
it's not funny. - It is a little.
what do you got?
unincorporated country club development outside of town,
scarlett Marquesa, 33, female.
hostess of the party, married, one kid.
right about 10: 20 this evening, the party was in full swing.
scarlett comes running over the balcony, clutching her throat and screaming.
she falls down to her death. - Where's the husband and the kid?
they're with neighbors, badly shook up. - We'll wait to talk to them until tomorrow morning.
poison, huh? - Must be. Frothing at the lips, discoloration.
the medical examiner thinks so, too.
but we haven't found the source yet.
we don't know where she ingested the poison.
she came from up there, but the actual poisoning could've taken place anywhere. It's a big house.
uh, just a moment. Excuse me.
that's interesting.
look. Look at her eyes.
what?
Hello? Use your words.
she had more mascara on her right eye than she did on her left, which means that she was halfway through reapplying her makeup when she was poisoned, so...
she was in the...
bathroom.
hmm.
Ah.
Ah. The source of the poison,
I have no doubt.
what do we got here?
motive.
Mr. Marquesa, I'm Agent Lisbon, CBI.
Yes, thanks for coming.
these are dear friends, Asra Hadami and Mandy Riljek.
they've been looking after me and Oscar.
anything we can do. - Vic, I'll make sure Jim stops by - As soon as he gets back into town. - Thanks, Mandy.
okay. Take care, Victor.
please. Come in.
scarlett kept everything in here.
very organized.
we'll get it back to you just as soon as we can.
thank you.
the tox screen tells us your wife's drink was laced
with rat poison.
rat poison.
Oscar. Oscar. - Argh! Argh!
Argh! - Who would do such a thing?
somebody who wanted to get even? - Who's your guess?
whose name just popped into your head?
scarlett had no enemies. Everyone loved Scarlett.
even Asra?
Asra? Yes, they got along fine. Why ask about her?
you're having an affair with Asra, aren't you? - What? No.
no? Really? - No. Really.
and what the heck kind of police are you, anyhow,
asking me a question like that?
sorry, my mistake. You are business partners?
she's my accounts manager. - Ah, okay. Now I understand.
understand what? - Doesn't matter. Do you know where her keys are?
I can't find 'em. They're not in here. - I couldn't find them. I wanted to move her car.
not to worry. I'm sure they'll show up.
what is it you do for a living, exactly?
I develop real estate. - It's a tough market.
tell me about it.
but I'm confident that it'll turn around soon.
and did Scarlett work with you? - No, she was the artistic type.
she made jewelry. That was her thing.
made a pretty good business out of it, in fact...
selling to friends and neighbors.
well, what kind of jewelry was it? Was it expensive stuff?
no. Just trinkets, really...
earrings, bracelets...
can we see some?
sure.
having fun?
hmm.
that's very nice.
was there any particular reason for the party last night?
Scarlett's idea.
she, um, thought it was necessary
to let people know we're doing fine.
and we are... Doing fine.
did anybody at the party behave in an unusual manner?
any odd incidents? - No.
and you knew everybody at the party personally? - Yes, good friends.
Oh, we're gonna need a list. - Sure.
from the country club, mostly.
scarlett was elected chair of her women's committee there.
it's a big deal in this community,
very prestigious.
I was so proud of her,
but it meant she had to spend a lot more time at...
at the club. - Argh!
Argh! - Oscar.
stop. Please.
pardon me.
um, are we done here? - No, that's all for now.
we'll be in touch if we need anything else.
very nice.
what's your deal with Asra Hadami? - Well, you saw the dinner theater way
in which she hugged Victor. She's deceiving him.
I thought it was a love affair gone awry, but it isn't.
it's something else. She's probably stealing from him.
I'll have Van Pelt pull her financials At the same time she pulls the Marquesas'.
you know, we should go take a look at this country club.
Yeah, talk to the women's committee she chairs.
bring Rigsby with you.
someone here knows the truth.
Oh? And how so?
well, poison and a message in lipstick
says this murder was done by a woman.
and women have no secrets from other women.
well, unless it was a cunning man posing as a woman. - What, you think?
no.
semifinal pairs, players 23 and 45
to court one now, please. 23 and 45 to court one.
good morning, ma'am. California bureau of investigation.
I'm detective Rigsby. This is Jane. - Hi, Heather.
nice to meet you.
everyone's been expecting you. Poor Scarlett. It's terrible.
how can I help you? - We'd like to start by talking - To members of the women's committee. - Sure thing.
uh, perhaps we'd, uh, gather them more discreetly? - Oh, everyone will know in minutes, anyhow.
the police are here, and they want to talk to us about Scarlett's murder. Come to the rose courtyard.
and, everybody, the silent auction closes shortly, so get those bids in now, folks.
I'll show you the way. - I love a silent auction.
so, uh, let's start with some names.
uh, Patience Broadbent...
Mm-hmm.
Mandy Riljek you've met. - Hi.
Jackie shaper. - Thank God you're here.
you're gonna find this maniac, won't you?
we'll try. Uh, were you all at Scarlett's party?
Yes. - Yes, we all have to go to the chairwoman's parties.
it's a rule. - The chairwoman is a prestigious position, isn't it?
Oh, yes, it is. - She would make her fair share of enemies, I'd expect.
you could say that.
if you have something to say, say it.
speak your mind, bitch. - Oh, okay. You want it all out there?
he asked about enemies, and that's what you were.
she hated Scarlett because she wanted to be chair, and Scarlett whipped her butt in the election.
schooled her, right, Mandy? - Oh, I'm not getting into this one.
right. I missed out on scoring the private office with all that cool stationery with my name on it.
so I killed her. Have you any idea how idiotic you sound?
you're the idiot. - Tell you what. It's probably best if we conduct interviews with each of you separately.
you're always so jealous of everybody.
do you remember anything odd happening the night of the party?
I don't know.
it was just the usual mojitos and chitchat, but...
but what?
I don't know if I should tell you this, but I saw Scarlett arguing with Asra Hadami.
it looked kind of angry. Some say something more than business might be going on between Asra Hadami and Victor Marquesa.
I don't know if that's true, - and I don't really follow the gossip. - Hmm. Who does?
we're told you're the gossip queen around here.
people tell me things.
so...
who's having an affair with Victor Marquesa?
I don't know. Who? Tell.
that's a funny idea?
no, it's just...
no. Victor and Asra are good friends, nothing more.
Asra had nothing to do with this.
no? What's the general opinion?
who did this?
my guess? - Yeah.
what makes you think that?
nothing, really. I mean, Victor's a nice guy, but that's who kills women, isn't it?
their husbands, 90% of the time. - 70%, I think.
hmm.
he's right.
that was some great play.
you could maybe do a little more topspin on your returns, - but it was a very nice play. - The answers are yes, I disliked her, - No, I didn't kill her. - You hate to lose, don't you?
Yes, unlike all those many people that love it.
I'm in the semifinals, for God sake.
Yeah. Oh, of course. Good luck with that.
Yeah, I have to go. I have another match in half an hour, and that toxic dwarf, Mandy Riljek, is trying to outbid me in the silent auction.
what she needs two romantic nights for at the Cliff side?
I don't know.
so I'll save us all some time and tell you who did this, if you like.
I'd like that very much.
Really? Why?
she's having an affair with Victor.
how do you know that?
I just have an eye for that stuff.
Asra must have killed Scarlett so that she could have victor for herself.
don't know why. If you ask me, he's a loser.
well, thank you.
Oh, by the way, if you disliked Scarlett Marquesa so much, why are you wearing earrings that she made?
she makes good earrings. It's nice to meet you.
nice meeting you, too.
you two were close, weren't you?
we were very close.
being her deputy in the women's committee, - We spoke every day. - Uh, did you notice anything, uh, different, - About, uh, your conversations? - She talked a lot about moving away.
she was so tired of keeping up at all costs. - At all costs?
just working so hard. - Do you have a key for this?
Oh, no. Only Scarlett has a key.
this is the chairwoman's office, and that's the chairwoman's safe.
that makes sense.
I don't know anything about that.
Scarlett's keys are missing. That's interesting.
we need to get that safe open. - We're gonna need a search warrant for that.
I'm on it. - Did you get anything from Scarlett's friends?
well, everybody has a different theory.
they're all hiding something. I don't know what.
did you hear anything from forensics about the lipstick on the napkin?
not yet. They're jammed up, as usual. Budget cuts.
boss, I just now got access to Asra Hadami's financials.
she cleared out her bank accounts this morning.
checking, savings... took out about $125, 000 in cash. - Going on the run maybe?
she didn't happen to buy any rat poison recently, did she?
that would be nice, but no. No record of it.
that was the Marsante security patrol calling.
they just found Hadami's house empty. She's gone.
great. A fugitive. - Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I... I know where she is.
boss? - Hmm?
I've been here nearly six months now, half a year.
what do you want? Half a cake?
I want to take lead on this interview.
okay.
okay?
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks, boss.
why were you running, Miss Hadami?
no reason.
stress. I needed space.
nothing to do with the argument you had with Scarlett Marquesa - The night she died? - I didn't have an argument with her.
we hear differently. - No argument.
I swear, I didn't kill her. This is absurd.
no more absurd than you clearing out your accounts
and abandoning your home for no reason.
maybe I need a lawyer.
say the word.
what he'll tell you... if you're not involved in the murder...
best speak up.
I ran because I knew the murder would expose some issues
that I would like to keep private.
such as your relationship with Mandy Riljek?
exactly. News like that could be ruinous.
true, but not the kind of thing you abandon your house for.
you said "issues." what are the other issues?
I didn't wanna have to look Victor in the face
and tell him I'd helped run
everything he worked so hard for into the ground.
how did you help do that? - I borrowed money from the company's cash reserve.
how much?
a little over half a million.
and where did it go?
I made some poor investment choices - That I had to cover quickly. - So you stole...
I borrowed from the reserve.
I skimmed the money from each development deal
that should have gone
into the company's reserve account as backup.
we were making so many deals.
I knew I'd get it back before it would matter.
but then the deals and the funding dried up,
and suddenly, that reserve became very important.
I sold anything I could get my hands on to cover the money.
Mm. Take a seat.
why am I even here? I've done nothing wrong.
be with you in just one moment.
Ah.
please.
well, you were found in a compromising position With a murder suspect.
how did you know how to find us anyway?
you been spying on me? - Well, you outbid Patience for a romantic weekend,
and your husband Jim's away.
and you laughed at the idea of Victor and Asra as lovers.
nobody knows I'm here, right?
if this gets out, it'll be a huge scandal.
nobody knows you're here.
sign this, and you're good to go.
judge's clerk says we won't get a search warrant for Scarlett's safe until tomorrow morning.
then we'll go in and tear the place apart. - J...
Oh. Sorry. - You didn't hear that. It's confidential.
confidential? - Oh, of course.
no, seriously. Don't tell anyone, okay?
I understand. May I leave now? - Yeah, please.
not bad. Your delivery was a bit wooden.
Wooden? Me?
Yeah, and you're Marlon Brando.
I can't believe it.
Asra's been with me for over five years.
I mean, she was with me in the trenches.
I can't believe this.
after going over your accounts, we had a couple of questions.
sure. - You've talked about cash crises in your business, but regular cash deposits were made to your personal accounts, somewhere upwards of $5, 000.
Scarlett's deposits. - Oscar, come get your lunch.
those are some pretty hefty deposits for somebody not really working. Where'd the money come from?
uh, her jewelry business.
I thought you said it was a small side business.
well, it was, but recently her pieces were getting a lot of interest, and apparently, uh, - she made a deal with a couple of boutiques. - Do you know which ones?
I never asked. - Without her money, you would have fallen behind months ago.
I know all too well.
it was my wife who had to save our butts recently.
dad? - What's the matter?
you made it wrong.
mommy never puts all this stuff in it.
she knows I like it plain.
can we make a compromise, buddy?
I... I need to talk to these nice police ladies.
now I'll make it better next time. I promise.
now would you please just eat the sandwich?
sorry about that.
it's not a problem.
according to your wife's phone records, she traded a lot of calls with several disposable cell phones.
well, I don't know who she would have been talking to. - In her day planner,
she had a regular weekly date noted down with an address in Marysville She had one scheduled for later today.
do you know anything about that? - No, I don't know what that's about,
but I know she used to go to Marysville a lot for the antique jewelry markets and stuff.
excuse me.
results on the lipstick.
no traces of D. N.A. Were found, but the color, "tongue in cheek,"
is a limited edition, sold only in a few high-end stores.
tongue in cheek... that's cute.
look, secure access to each of the stores receipt records
so we can search through them.
then I want you to meet us at 65434 East Boulevard.
it's in Marysville. - On my way.
I'll, uh, I'll catch up to you.
Hi. - Hey.
who's winning? - Oh, I don't know.
I don't follow the play, to be honest. - Yeah, it's kind of silly, isn't it?
everybody's so serious over a game.
exactly. Like it matters who wins a stupid trophy.
I guess people feel they need a purpose.
Yeah, well, my purpose died this year at the age of 16.
Oh. I'm sorry. Boy or girl?
girl. High as a kite with one of her friends.
she wrapped her car around a tree.
friend got away without a scratch, thank God. - What was her name?
Rachel. Once you lose a child, all this striving seems kinda ridiculous, you know?
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.
why not leave it all behind? Just go away?
I can't afford to leave.
I have negative equity on my house.
Oh, nice play, Karen!
besides, these are my friends.
this is all I have.
according to Scarlett's planner, the meeting's here.
let's see if we can spot the contact.
I don't know. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Hi, guys. What are you doing?
Aah!
get up.
this way. - All right, all right, all right.
I should have brought some snacks.
I don't see this working in a hurry. - Ah, you shouldn't go hungry long.
Mandy's news will have spread quickly.
everyone knows that tomorrow, the safe will be opened.
it's now or never for whoever took Scarlett's keys.
Hey, easy there.
that is antique Mexican silver.
maybe next time you'll think before trying to outrun an officer of the law.
I'm assuming this isn't candy.
why were you meeting Scarlett Marquesa?
so we could exchange beauty secrets.
you mind if I smoke? - Yeah, I do.
Oh. - Van Pelt, what do you got?
wardell Suggs, A. K.A. "Digger."
he's been arrested for several counts of petty theft, - fraud and assault. - That's very impressive.
it could be better. - Why were you meeting Scarlett?
What'd she tell you about me?
nothing. She's dead.
I... I didn't have anything to do with that.
Hey, boss, come take a look.
would you look at that? The mother lode.
let's talk, huh?
the hell, I got a strike to give.
scarlett was one of my biggest customers.
painkillers, tranquilizers, diet pills...
by the hundreds.
scarlett was dealing prescription drugs?
Yep.
where did you two meet? - Swap meet.
she was trying to sell that God-awful jewelry.
she looked desperate, so I told her - there's easier ways to make money. - Were you doing a deal tonight?
supposed to. Lately, I've been having to listen to her yammer about quitting. Then she'd buy some bag, saying this is the last time she's doing it.
of course she'd always come back. - She was gonna quit?
Yep.
a matter of fact, last couple of weeks,
I've been getting calls from another girl, saying Scarlett gave her my info.
same prissy kind of voice.
chick said she'd be interested in setting up her own situation - when Scarlett quit. - Does this chick have a name?
you know, I'm not big on names at first, but I do have her number.
why don't you give her a call?
Oh.
digger, why are you calling me now?
in your own time Ma'am, if you would like to take a seat.
thank you so much.
how did you come to have Scarlett Marquesa's keys?
I took them when I went to offer my condolences to Victor.
naughty I know, but I couldn't wait.
it's not naughty. It's a felony.
you wanted to get your hands on her pill supply.
nonsense. I opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
I had no idea there were any pills in there.
I simply wanted to measure the windows for new drapes.
I'll be the next chair of the committee. - Oh. Then why not wait till it's official?
am I here because of keys?
explain the nature of your relationship with Wardell Suggs.
who?
digger?
I liked his jewelry.
okay. Were you aware that Scarlett Marquesa was selling illegal prescription drugs in the Villa Marsante Estates?
who didn't know?
well, except for you all.
if everyone knew, then why didn't anyone come forth?
and risked being ostracized or caught up in the vulgarity of it all?
not likely.
she was doing a booming business, and you wanted to be part of it, - maybe a little too much. - So I killed her? Please.
hello. She was a drug dealer.
the people she dealt with must have done her in...
other dealers.
or a highly capable rival straight in the middle of her own community?
you have found no drugs or poison on me or in my home.
the keys were taken after she was killed, and I only opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
you taped together your whole theory with a couple of random conversations I've had with a drug dealer. Does that about sum it up?
well, when she puts it like that, it does seem pretty thin.
Yeah. She's a piece of work, isn't she? - Yeah.
we're gonna have to cut her loose for now, but I think
some discreet surveillance might help our cause.
if you were thinking of trying that on, don't.
not your shade. - What do you think about older women?
where is this coming from? I don't think about older women.
my mother's an older woman. - Not old old, just older, you know?
older than you. - Why you asking?
you're not trying to set me up with somebody, are you?
it turns out... if you look
at the available scientific evidence on the internet...
and they've got less hang-ups,
they like themselves way more than younger women,
and they're at their sexual peak.
I mean, that's what the research says anyhow.
what the hell happened to you at that country club?
nothing. I'm just saying that... umm, she spotted us.
afternoon, boys.
I was making myself a panini.
and thought I'd bring you some, too. - Oh. Thanks, ma'am.
Oh, and just so you know,
I am headed to the club for a massage,
so you don't need to follow too close.
relax. Have a bite to eat first. I'll see you there. - Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am. what is wrong with you?
well, she surprised me.
what's in the sandwiches? - Well, it's a panini, if you don't mind.
it's, uh, ham and cheese.
Yeah, who knows what else?
my God. Drugs?
I can't believe it.
using jewelry sales as a cover,
your wife was dealing prescription drugs...
painkillers mostly. Speed, diet pills.
some of them were coming in from mexico,
other ones were stolen from pharmacies.
you seem genuinely surprised.
a lot of people around here knew about her.
I had no idea.
you don't think I had something to do with this?
she was moving an awful lot of inventory.
I had nothing to do with this.
how could you have not known
she was medicating half the women in the neighborhood?
she lied to me.
maybe she was just trying to protect me from the shame.
or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind eye,
as long as the money was coming in.
no.
if I had known she was doing this,
I would have tried to stop her.
Hi. I'm patrick.
you want to talk, oscar?
pretty heavy stuff going on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your mom.
me, too.
my dad is sad because you guys can't find who did it.
but I don't mind about that.
I just want her back.
she can't come back. You know that, don't you?
I know that.
I'm 9.
I will never see her again until I'm dead, too.
then I'll go stay with her in heaven.
well, that sounds good.
but you know what I noticed you're really good at
that could help you right now?
what?
make-believe.
Yeah.
I am.
you are very good at it.
a master like you, you wanted to talk to your mom,
you could make-believe she was here and do whatever you like.
I do it all the time. - You talk to my mom?
no, not your mom. -I talk to my wife.
she's dead? - Yeah. Yeah.
but I talk to her all the time. You should try it.
it's very good. - I guess.
well, whatever.
this is cool.
you any good with this sword?
I'm okay.
Oh, really?
en garde.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I got you!
Ahh!
please. Mercy.
mercy.
fair maiden.
D'artagnan, I have to go. Good-bye.
Ugh, SPA stuff takes forever.
how long can a massage be?
no, they do all sorts of things to you besides a massage...
facials, waxing, mud. - How do you know so much?
I bought a certificate for my mom.
you're back again. How nice.
Hi, Mrs. Shaper.
now you know, you must call me Jackie.
and it's "Ms.," not "Mrs." Divorced.
sorry... Jackie.
he was a good man, but weak, essentially.
he just couldn't see... - Wait. What are you wearing on your lips?
excuse me? - The color. What... what color is this?
tongue in cheek. You like it? - Where did you get it?
I bought it at the boutique in town. - How long have you been wearing this shade?
I just bought it today.
I saw it on Patience Broadbent at Scarlett's party.
I just had to have it. It's a crazy price, - But what the heck? - You're positive that it's tongue in cheek?
I have it right here. - And you definitely saw Patience wearing it first - at Scarlett Marquesa's party? - Is that a pickup line?
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
no detecectable prints on the knife.
surveillance tapes? - The Spa didn't believe in them.
something to do with disturbing the chi.
I don't get it. Why kill patience? Why now?
perhaps it was part of the plan all along.
no, this was hasty. Patience became the new target.
revenge for Scarlett's death? Victor was quick to anger.
Rigsby, find out - Victor Marquesa's recent whereabouts. - Yes, boss.
it could have been someone else.
the competition wiping out the dealer - and her heir apparent or... - Or what?
Victor does fit nicely, doesn't he?
Yeah.
can you believe that patience got stabbed? - Here we are.
it's like a mafia hit.
I'm never going in that Spa again, I will tell you that.
tragic set of events.
I didn't see it coming.
so what do you think? This is some kind of drug war?
could be, but stabbings are usually crimes of passion.
this is, uh, this is very personal.
Mm. Mm. So what's next?
CBI are already putting the pieces together.
in fact, uh...
W... never mind.
what?
no, I... I... I shouldn't talk about it.
cause it's still an ongoing case. - You know, you can't just leave something like that hanging.
well, I'm sorry, you know,
but I will get myself in a lot of trouble.
Oh, come on, girls.
all right, listen. Can you promise me
that this will just stay between us?
Yes. Yes, of course.
you promise? - I promise.
okay, we're going after Victor Marquesa. - Victor?
Oh, I don't believe it. He doesn't even look like the type.
on what grounds? - We think that he killed Patience - out of revenge for the murder of his wife. - But you said there was no proof Patience was guilty.
I guess victor didn't want to wait around for proof.
what's gonna happen to Oscar? - Mother murdered, now dad's a murderer.
once they arrest the father, he'll be placed in foster care.
Oh, how dreadful. - Mm.
that poor child. - It is.
Mm.
I guess they couldn't keep the secret.
guess they can't.
let's do it.
it's gonna be all right, son. - Dad!
I promise. - No!
it's gonna be okay. - Where are you going?
don't worry! - I'll be right back! No! Dad!
come back! No!
no, no, no. Wait. Wait. No.
stop, stop, stop. You have to stop this. - No. No, Heather. No, we can't.
dad! Dad! - This is justice being served.
how can you say that? Look what you're putting that boy through. - He'll forget eventually. It's fine.
no. No, he won't. - It's fine.
no. No, it's not. - Why?
because I did it! I killed them.
I killed them both.
Oh, God.
okay.
I first suspected it was you because it seemed...
... that everybody else at the club wore some of Scarlett's jewelry, ... but not you.
that's it?
jewelry?
the more we talked, ... the more I felt your pain and anger.
losing your daughter has unhinged you.
Unhinged?
Yeah, I suppose it has.
my daughter...
she loved to dance.
didn't matter what kind of music either, ... a toe would start tapping and...
... she was just so full of life.
she had taken several painkillers with alcohol before she got behind the wheel.
one of her neighborhood friends got them from her mother...
... who got them from Scarlett.
I understand your anger.
it was like they ripped my soul out clean.
but the rest of the world just kept moving right along.
it was like I was the only one who remembered what happened.
so when I...
... saw her flitting about town, ... selling her pills without a care in the world, ... still hosting parties at her house,
happily dancing around...
... without a stitch of the misery I was carrying, I snapped.
I killed her.
I didn't want any other person...
... to have to experience what I did.
and Patience?
she told everyone at the club not to worry.
she was gonna take over Scarlett's business...
... and keep the pills coming, ... like nothing had happened,
like no lessons had been learned.
I had to finish what I started.
I had to.
I'll get this transcribed for you to sign.
now that it's done, does it feel better?
it doesn't change a thing.
agent Lisbon.
Mr. Marquesa, hi.
I want to thank you and your team.
although, I must admit, that whole scene...
... in front of the house... - It was make-believe, dad.
sorry. The make-believe was a bit unorthodox...
... and unpleasant.
but I'm sure you all know what you're doing. - Most of the time.
I want to apologize if we were tough on you.
no, it's what I needed to hear.
we're moving out of villa Marsante...
... and headed back to my hometown.
my son and I have a lot of catching up to do.
take care.
Thanks.
Mr. Jane.
thank you.
Oh, it's nothing. Forget about it.
take care.
good luck. Bye.
another minute, and I would have missed them.
I do hate it when people say thank you. - Why?
he likes to play the lone ranger.
who was that masked man?
I never got a chance to thank him.
exactly.
uh, I don't want to alarm you, ... but your friend Jackie has just walked in behind you, ... and she is looking fierce.
Oh, I know. I asked her out to dinner.
Hey.
mentalist
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
wow, Scarlett just throws the best parties.
I'm gonna go find Asra.
then I'll see who I can find.
there's Victor.
call an ambulance!
mom.
no, Oscar, stay up there!
look at it, George.
beautiful, isn't it?
look at that.
don't you feel happy and relaxed?
Yes.
say it. Tell me how you feel.
happy and relaxed.
that's good. That's very good.
so tell me, George, what's your date of birth?
I was born on the 1st of March...
and what's your mother's name?
that's-- that's a very nice name.
she was a good woman.
she liked you to tell the truth, didn't she, George?
Yes.
so tell me, how did you murder Donovan Hobar.
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we just caught a red ball.
you gonna be much longer with this one?
damn it, jane. He's in a trance, isn't he?
Wha--I'd describe it more as a-a deep relaxation.
hypnotized. You hypnotized him.
well, I was doing a favor for the organized crime unit.
those cowboys?
time to go, guys.
you know, I was just about to get the truth out of him.
uh, he killed two people.
if you walk very quietly to the door, I still might
how many times have I told you--no hypnotism?
it's illegal, and it's unethical, and you cannot keep on doing it.
just calm yourself, woman. It's no big thing.
Oh, really?
this man's lawyer is right this minute coming down the hallway, wearing a mean face.
something tells me he'll argue that point with you. Let's go.
well, let me get him out of his trance first, huh?
well, be quick about it.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to speak to my client alone.
of course. - Now.
George, nice to talk to you.
good luck with all your future endeavors.
that's mine.
so, George... George? Are you all right?
it's not funny.
it is a little. What do you got?
unincorporated country club development outside of town, ,Scarlett Marquesa, 33, female.
hostess of the party, married, one kid.
right about 10: 20 this evening, the party was in full swing.
scarlett comes runng over the balcony, clutching her throat and screaming.
she falls down to her death.
Where's the husband and the kid?
they're with neighbors, badly shook up.
we'll wait to talk to them until tomorrow morning.
poison, huh? - Must be.
frothing at the lips, discoloration.
the medical examiner thinks so, too.
but we haven't found the source yet.
we don't know where she ingested the poison.
she came from up there, but the actual poisoning could've taken place anywhere.
it's a big uh, just a moment.
excuse me.
that's interesting.
look. Look at her eyes. - What?
Hello? Use your words.
she had more mascara on her right eye than she did on her left,
which means that she was halfway through reapplying her makeup when she was poisoned, so...
she was in the... Bathroom.
the source of the poison, I have no doubt.
what do we got here?
motive.
Mr. Marquesa, I'm agent Lisbon, CBI.
Yes, thanks for coming.
these are dear friends, Asra Hadami and Mandy Riljek.
they've been looking after me and Oscar.
anything we can do.
vic, I'll make sure Jim stops by as soon as he gets back into town.
Thanks, Mandy.
take care, Victor.
please. Come in.
scarlett kept everything in here.
very organized.
we'll get it back to you just as soon as we can.
thank you.
the tox screen tells us your wife's drink was laced with rat poison.
rat poison.
who would do such a thing?
somebody who wanted to get even?
who's your guess? Whose name just popped into your head?
scarlett had no enemies.
everyone loved Scarlett.
even Asra?
Asra? Yes, they got along fine. Why ask about her?
you're having an affair with Asra, aren't you?
what? No.
no? Really? - No. Really.
and what the heck kind of police are you, anyhow, asking me a question like that?
sorry, my mistake.
are you business partners?
she's my accounts manager.
Ah, okay. Now I understand.
understand what?
doesn't matter. Do you know where her keys are?
I can't find 'em. They're not in here.
I couldn't find them. I wanted to move her car.
not to worry. I'm sure they'll show up.
what is it you do for a living, exactly?
I develop real estate.
it's a tough market.
tell me about it. But I'm confident that it'll turn around soon.
and did Scarlett work with you?
no, she was the artistic type.
she made jewelry. That was her thing.
made a pretty good business out of it, in fact...
selling to friends and neighbors.
well, what kind of jewelry was it? Was it expensive stuff?
no. Just trinkets, really-- earrings, bracelets...
can we see some?
sure.
that's very nice.
was there any particular reason for the party last night?
Scarlett's idea.
she, um, thought it was necessary to let people know we're doing fine.
and we are... doing fine.
did anybody at the party behave in an unusual manner?
any odd incidents? - No.
and you knew everybody at the party personally?
Yes, good friends.
Oh, we're gonna need a list.
sure. From the country club, mostly.
scarlett was elected chair of her women's committee there.
it's a big deal in this community, very prestigious.
I was so proud of her, but it meant she had to spend a lot more time at-- at the club.
Oscar. Stop. Please.
pardon me. Um, are we done here?
no, that's all for now. we'll be in touch if we need anything else.
very nice.
what's your deal with Asra Hadami?
well, you saw the dinner theater way in which she hugged Victor.
she's deceiving him.
I thought it was a love affair gone awry, but it isn't.
it's something else.
she's probably stealing from him.
I'll have Van Pelt pull her financials at the same time she pulls the Marquesas'.
you know, we should go take a look at this country club.
Yeah, talk to the women's committee she chairs. Bring Rigsby with you.
someone here knows the truth.
and how so?
well, poison and a message in lipstick says this murder was done by a woman.
and women have no secrets from other women.
well, unless it was a cunning man posing as a woman.
what, you think? - No.
semifinal pairs, players 23 and 45 to court one now, please. 23 and 45 to court one.
good morning, ma'am. California Bureau of Investigation. I'm detective Rigsby. This is Jane.
Hi, Heather. Nice to meet you.
everyone's been expecting you. Poor Scarlett. It's terrible.
how can I help you?
we'd like to start by talking to members of the women's committee.
sure thing.
uh, perhaps we'd, uh, gather them more discreetly?
Oh, everyone will know in minutes, anyhow.
Jackie, Patience, Mandy, the police are here, and they want to talk to us about Scarlett's murder.
come to the rose courtyard.
and, everybody, the silent auction closes shortly, so get those bids in now, folks.
I'll show you the way.
I love a silent auction.
so, uh, let's start with some names.
uh, Patience Broadbent... Mandy Riljek you've met. Jackie Shaper.
thank god you're here.
you're gonna find this maniac, won't you?
we'll try. Uh, were you all at Scarlett's party?
Yes.
Yes, we all have to go to the chairwoman's parties. It's a rule.
the chairwoman is a prestigious position, isn't it?
Oh, yes, it is.
she would make her fair share of enemies, I'd expect.
you could say that.
if you have something to say, say it.
speak your mind, bitch.
Oh, okay. You want it all out there?
he asked about enemies, and that's what you were.
she hated Scarlett because she wanted to be chair, and Scarlett whipped her butt in the election.
schooled her, right, Mandy?
Oh, I'm not getting into this one.
right. I missed out on scoring the private office with all that cool stationery with my name on it.
so I killed her.
have you any idea how idiotic you sound?
you're the idiot.
tell you what. It's probably best if we conduct interviews with each of you separately.
you're always so jealous of everybody.
do you rember anything odd happening the night of the party?
I don't know. It was just the usual mojitos and chitchat, but...
but what?
I don't know if I should tell you this, but I-I saw Scarlett arguing with Asra Hadami.
it looked kind of angry.
some say something more than business might be going on between Asra Hadami and Victor Marquesa.
I don't know if that's true, and I don't really follow the gossip.
who does?
we're told you're the gossip queen around here.
people tell me things.
so... Who's having an affair with Victor Marquesa?
I don't know. Who? Tell.
that's a funny idea?
no, it's just... No.
Victor and Asra are good friends, nothing more.
Asra had nothing to do with this. - No?
what's the general opinion? Who did this?
my guess? - Yeah.
what makes you think that?
nothing, really. I mean, Victor's a nice guy, but that's who kills women, isn't it?
their husbands, 90% of the time.
70%, I think.
he's right.
that was some great play.
you could maybe do a little more topspin on your returns, but it was a very nice play.
the answers are yes, I disliked her, no, I didn't kill her.
you hate to lose, don't you?
Yes, unlike all those many people that love it.
I'm in the semifinals, for god sake. - Yeah. Oh, of course.
good luck with that.
Yeah, I have to go.
I have another match in half an hour, and that toxic dwarf, Mandy Riljek,
is trying to outbid me in the silent auction.
what she needs two romantic nights for at the Cliffside? I don't know.
so I'll save us all some time and tell you who did this, if you like.
I'd like that very much.
Really? Why?
she's having an affair with Victor.
how do you know that?
I just have an eye for that stuff.
Asra must have killed Scarlett so that she could have Victor for herself.
don't know why. If you ask me, he's a loser.
well, thank you.
Oh, by the way, if you disliked Scarlett marquesa so much, why are you wearing earrings that she made?
she makes good earrings. It's nice to meet you.
nice meeting you, too.
you two were close, weren't you?
we were very close.
being her deputy in the women's committee, we spoke every day.
uh, did you notice anything, uh, different, about, uh, your conversations?
she talked a lot about moving away.
she was so tired of keeping up at all costs.
at all costs?
just working so hard. - Do you have a key for this?
Oh, no. Only Scarlett has a key.
this is the chairwoman's office, and that's the chairwoman's safe.
that makes sense.
I don't know anything about that.
Scarlett's keys are missing. That's interesting.
we need to get that safe open.
we're gonna need a search warrant for that.
I'm on it.
did you get anything from Scarlett's friends?
well, everybody has a different theory.
they're all hiding something. I don't know what.
did you hear anything from forensics about the lipstick on the napkin?
not yet. They're jammed up, as usual. Budget cuts.
boss, I just now got access to Asra Hadami's financials.
she cleared out her bank accounts this morning.
checking, savings-- took out about $125, 000 in cash.
going on the run maybe?
she didn't happen to buy any rat poison recently, did she?
that would be nice, but no. No record of it.
that was the Marsante security patrol calling.
they just found Hadami's house empty. She's gone.
great. A fugitive.
I-I know where she is.
CBI.
boss? I've been here nearly six months now, half a year.
what do you want? Half a cake?
I want to take lead on this interview.
okay.
okay? - Yeah. Sure.
Thanks, boss.
why were you running, miss Hadami?
no reason. Stress. I need space.
nothing to do with the argument you had with Scarlett Marquesa the night she died?
I didn't have an argument with her.
we hear differently.
no argument.
I swear, I didn't kill her. This is absurd.
no more absurd than you clearing out your accounts and abandoning your home for no reason.
maybe I need a lawyer.
say the word.
what he'll tell you--if you're not involved in the murder
best speak up.
I ran because I knew the murder would expose some issues that I would like to keep private.
such as your relationship with Mandy Riljek?
exactly. News like that could be ruinous.
true, but not the kind of thing you abandon your house for.
you said "issues." What are the other issues?
I didn't wanna have to look Victor in the face
and tell him I'd helped run everything he worked so hard for into the ground.
how did you help do that?
I borrowed money from the company's cash reserve.
how much?
a little over half a million.
and where did it go?
I made some poor investment choices that I had to cover quickly.
so you stole--- - I borrowed from the reserve.
I skimmed the money from each development deal that should have gone into the company's reserve account as backup.
we were making so many deals.
I knew I'd get it back before it would matter.
but then the deals and the funding dried up, and suddenly, that reserve became very important.
I sold anything I could get my hands on to cover the money.
take a seat.
why am I even here? I've done nothing wrong.
be with you in just one moment.
please.
well, you were found in a compromising position with a murder suspect.
how did you know how to find us anyway?
you been spying on me?
well, you outbid patience for a romantic weekend, and your husband Jim's away.
and you laughed at the idea of Victor and Asra as lovers.
nobody knows I'm here, right?
if this gets out, it'll be a huge scandal.
nobody knows you're here.
sign this, and you're good to go.
judge's clerk says we won't get a search warrant for Scarlett's safe until tomorrow morning.
then we'll go in and tear the place apart.
sorry.
you didn't hear that. It's confidential.
confidential? Oh, of course.
no, seriously. Don't tell anyone, okay?
I understand. May I leave now?
Yeah, please.
not bad. Your delivery was a bit wooden.
Wooden? Me?
Yeah, and you're Marlon Brando.
I can't believe it.
Asra's been with me for over five years.
I mean, she was with me in the trenches.
I can't believe this.
after going over your accounts, we had a couple of questions.
sure.
you've talked about cash crises in your business,
but regular cash deposits were made to your personal accounts, somewhere upwards of $5, 000.
Scarlett's deposits.
Oscar, come get your lunch.
those are some pretty hefty deposits for somebody not really working.
Where'd the money come from?
uh, her jewelry business.
I thought you said it was a small side business.
well, it was, but recently her pieces were getting a lot of interest,
and apparently, uh, she made a deal with a couple of boutiques.
do you know which ones?
I never asked.
without her money, you would have fallen behind months ago.
I know all too well it was my wife who had to save our butts recently.
dad? - What's the matter?
you made it wrong.
mommy never puts all this stuff in it.
she knows I like it plain.
can we make a compromise, buddy?
I-I need to talk to these nice police ladies.
now I'll make it better next time. I promise.
now would you please just eat the sandwich?
sorry about that. - It's not a problem.
according to your wife's phone records, she traded a lot of calls with several disposable cell phones.
well, I don't know who she would have been talking to.
in her day planner, she had a regular weekly date noted down with an address in Marysville.
she had one scheduled for later today.
do you know anything about that?
no, I don't know what that's about,
but I know she used to go to Marysville a lot for the antique jewelry markets and stuff.
excuse me.
results on the lipstick.
no traces of DNA were found, but the color, "tongue in cheek,"
is a limited edition, sold only in a few high-end stores.
tongue in cheek-- that's cute.
look, secure access to each of the stores receipt records so we can search through them.
then I want you to meet us at 65434 east boulevard.
it's in Marysville. - On my way.
I'll, uh, I'll catch up to you.
who's winning?
Oh, I don't know. I don't follow the play, to be honest.
Yeah, it's kind of silly, isn't it?
everybody's so serious over a game.
exactly. Like it matters who wins a stupid trophy.
I guess people feel they need a purpose.
Yeah, well, my purpose died this year at the age of 16.
I'm sorry. Boy or girl? - Girl.
high as a kite with one of her friends. She wrapped her car around a tree.
friend got away without a scratch, thank God.
what was her name?
once you lose a child, all this striving seems kinda ridiculous, you know?
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.
why not leave it all behind? Just go away?
I can't afford to leave. I have negative equity on my house.
Oh, nice play, Karen!
besides, these are my friends. This is all I have.
according to Scarlett's planner, the meeting's here.
let's see if we can spot the contact.
I don't know. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Hi, guys. What are you doing?
get up. This way.
I should have brought some snacks.
I don't see this working in a hurry.
Ah, you shouldn't go hungry long.
Mandy's news will have spread quickly.
everyone knows that tomorrow, the safe will be opened.
it's now or never for whoever took Scarlett's keys.
Hey, easy there.
that is antique mexican silver.
maybe next time you'll think before trying to outrun an officer of the law.
I'm assuming this isn't candy.
why were you meeting Scarlett Marquesa?
so we could exchange beauty secrets.
you mind if I smoke?
Yeah, I do.
van Pelt, what do you got?
wardell Suggs, a.k.a. "Digger."
he's been arrested for several counts of petty theft, fraud and assault.
that's very impressive.
it could be better.
why were you meeting Scarlett?
What'd she tell you about me?
nothing. She's dead.
I-I didn't have anything to do with that.
Hey, boss, come take a look.
would you look at that? The mother lode. Let's talk, huh?
the hell, I got a strike to give.
scarlett was one of my biggest customers.
painkillers, tranquilizers, diet pills-- by the hundreds.
scarlett was dealing prescription drugs? - Yep.
where did you two meet?
swap meet.
she was trying to sell that god-awful jewelry.
she looked desperate, so I told her there's easier ways to make money.
were you doing a deal tonight?
supposed to.
lately, I've been having to listen to her yammer about quitting.
then she'd buy some bag, saying this is the last time she's doing it.
of course she'd always come back.
she was gonna quit? - Yep.
a matter of fact, last couple of weeks, I've been getting calls from another girl,
saying Scarlett gave her my info.
same prissy kind of voice.
chick said she'd be interested in setting up her own situation when Scarlett quit.
does this chick have a name?
you know, I'm not big on names at first, but I do have her number.
why don't you give her a call?
digger, why are you calling me now?
uh, in your own time, man, if you'd like to take a seat.
thank you so much, ma'am.
how did you come to have Scarlett Marquesa's keys?
I took them when I went to offer my condolences to Victor.
naughty I know, but I couldn't wait.
it's not naughty. It's a felony.
you wanted to get your hands on her pill supply.
nonsense.
I opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
I had no idea there were any pills in there.
I simply wanted to measure the windows for new drapes.
I'll be the next chair of the committee.
then why not wait till it's official?
am I here because of keys?
explain the nature of your relationship with Wardell Suggs.
who?
I liked his jewelry. - Okay.
were you aware that Scarlett Marquesa was selling illegal prescription drugs in the Villa Marsante estates?
who didn't know?
well, except for you all.
if everyone knew, then why didn't anyone come forth?
and risked being ostracized or caught up in the vulgarity of it all?
not likely.
she was doing a booming business, and you wanted to be part of it, maybe a little too much.
so I killed her? Please.
hello. She was a drug dealer.
the people she dealt with must have done her in-- other dealers.
or a highly capable rival straight in the middle of her own community?
you have found no drugs or poison on me or in my home.
the keys were taken aftershe was killed, and I only opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
you taped together your whole theory with a couple of random conversations I've had with a drug dealer.
does that about sum it up?
well, when she puts it like that, it does seem pretty thin.
Yeah. She's a piece of work, isn't she?
we're gonna have to cut her loose for now, but I think some discreet surveillance might help our cause.
if you were thinking of trying that on, don't. Not your shade.
what do you think about older women?
where is this coming from? I don't think about older women. My mother's an older woman.
not old old, just older, you know? Older than you.
why you asking?
you're not trying to set me up with somebody, are you?
it turns out--if you look at the available scientific evidence on the internet
and they've got less hang-ups, they like themselves way more than younger women,
and they're at their sexual peak.
I mean, that's what the research says anyhow.
what the hell happened to you at that country club?
nothing. I'm just saying that-- Oh, no. She spotted us.
afternoon, boys.
I was making myself a pani and thought I'd bring you some, too.
Thanks, ma'am.
Oh, and just so you know, I am headed to the club for a massage,
so you don't need to follow too close.
relax. Have a bite to eat first. I'll see you there.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am. What is wrong with you?
well, she surprised me.
what's in the sandwiches?
well, it's a pani, if you don't mind.
it's, uh, ham and cheese. - Yeah, who knows what else?
drugs? I can't believe it.
using jewelry sales as a cover, your wife was dealing prescription drugs-- painkillers mostly.
speed, diet pills.
some of them were coming in from Mexico, other ones were stolen from pharmacies.
you seem genuinely surprised.
a lot of people around here knew about her.
I had no idea.
you don't think I had something to do with this?
she was moving an awful lot of inventory.
I had nothing to do with this.
how could you have not known she was medicating half the women in the neighborhood?
she lied to me.
maybe she was just trying to protect me from the shame.
or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind eye, as long as the money was coming in.
no. If I had known she was doing this, I would have tried to stop her.
I'm Patrick.
you want to talk, Oscar?
pretty heavy stuff going on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your mom.
me, too.
my dad is sad because you guys can't find who did it.
but I don't mind about that.
I just want her back.
she can't come back. You know that, don't you?
I know that. I'm 9.
I will never see her again until I'm dead, too.
then I'll go stay with her in heaven.
well, that sounds good.
but you know what I noticed you're really good at that could help you right now?
what?
make-believe.
Yeah. I am.
you are very good at it.
a master like you, you wanted to talk to your mom,
you could make-believe she was here and do whatever you like. I do it all the time.
you talk to my mom? - No, not your mom. I talk to my wife.
she's dead? - Yeah. Yeah.
but I talk to her all the time. You should try it. It's very good.
I guess. - Well, whatever.
this is cool.
you any good with this sword?
I'm okay.
Oh, really?
I got you!
please. Mercy. Mercy.
fair maiden. D'artagnan, I have to go. Good-bye.
Ugh, spa stuff takes forever.
how long can a massage be?
no, they do all sorts of things to you besides a massage-- facials, waxing, mud.
how do you know so much?
I bought a certificate for my mom.
Wayne. You're back again. How nice.
Hi, Mrs. Shaper.
now you know, you must call me jackie.
and it's "Ms." Not "Mrs." divorced.
sorry... Jackie.
he was a good man, but weak, essentially. He just couldn't see.
wait. What are you wearing on your lips?
excuse me? - The color. What--what color is this?
tongue in cheek. You like it?
where did you get it?
I bought it at the boutique in town.
how long have you been wearing this shade?
I just bought it today.
I saw it on Patience Broadbent at Scarlett's party.
I just had to have it.
it's a crazy price, but what the heck?
you're positive that it's tongue in cheek?
I have it right here.
and you definitely saw Patience wearing it first at Scarlett Marquesa's party?
is that a pickup line?
no detectable prints on the knife.
surveillance tapes?
the spa didn't believe in them. Something to do with disturbing the chi.
I don't get it. Why kill Patience? Why now?
perhaps it was part of the plan all along.
no, this was hasty. Patience became the new target.
revenge for Scarlett's death?
Victor was quick to anger.
Rigsby, find out Victor Marquesa's recent whereabouts.
Yes, boss.
it could have been someone else.
the competition wiping out the dealer and her heir apparent or...
or what?
Victor does fit nicely, doesn't he?
Yeah.
can you believe that Patience got stabbed?
it's like a mafia hit.
I'm never going in that spa again, I will tell you that.
tragic set of events.
I didn't see it coming.
so what do you think? This is some kind of drug war?
could be, but stabbings are usually crimes of passion.
this is, uh, this is very personal.
so what's next?
CBI are already putting the pieces together.
in fact, uh... W--never mind.
what?
no, I-I shouldn't talk about it 'cause it's still an ongoing case.
you know, you can't just leave something like that hanging.
well, I'm sorry, you know, but I will get myself in a lot of trouble.
Oh, come on, girls.
all right, listen.
can you promise me that this will just stay between us?
Yes. Yes, of course.
you promise? - I promise.
okay, we're going after Victor Marquesa.
Victor? Oh, I don't believe it. He doesn't even look like the type.
on what grounds?
we think that he killed Patience out of revenge for the murder of his wife.
but you said there was no proof Patience was guilty.
I guess Victor didn't want to wait around for proof.
what's gonna happen to Oscar?
mother murdered, now dad's a murder.
once they arrest the father, he'll be placed in foster care.
Oh, how dreadful.
that poor child. - It is.
I guess they couldn't keep the secret.
guess they can't.
let's do it.
it's gonna be all right, son. -Dad!
I promise. - No!
it's gonna be okay. - Where are you going?
don't worry! I'll be right back!
No! Dad!
come back! No! No, no, no.
stop, stop, stop. You have to stop this.
no. No, we can't. This is justice being served.
how can you say that? Look what you're putting that boy through.
he'll forget eventually. It's fine.
no. No, he won't. No. No, it's not. - It's fine. Why?
because I did it! I killed them.
I killed them both. Oh, god.
I first suspected it was you because it seemed that everybody else at the club wore some of Scarlett's jewelry,
but not you.
that's it? Jewelry?
the more we talked, the more I felt your pain and anger.
losing your daughter has unhinged you.
Unhinged?
Yeah, I suppose it has.
my daughter...
she loved to dance.
didn't matter what kind of music either, a toe would start tapping and...
she was just so full of life.
she had taken several inkillers with alcohol before she got behind the wheel.
one of her neighborhood friends got them from her mother who got them from Scarlett.
I understand your anger.
it was like they ripped my soul out clean.
but the rest of the world just kept moving right along.
it was like I was the only one who remembered what happened.
so when I...Saw her flitting about town, selling her pills without a care in the world,
still hosting parties at her house, happily dancing around without a stitch of the misery I was carrying, I snapped.
I killed her.
I didn't want any other person to have to experience what I did.
and Patience?
she told everyone at the club not to worry.
she was gonna take over Scarlett's business and keep the pills coming,
like nothing had happened, like no lessons had been learned.
I had to finish what i started.
I had to.
I'll get this transcribed for you to sign.
now that it's done, does it feel better?
it doesn't change a thing.
agent Lisbon.
Mr. Marquesa, hi.
I want to thank you and your team.
although, I must admit, that whole scene in front of the house
it was make-believe, dad.
sorry. The make-believe was a bit unorthodox and unpleasant,
but I'm sure you all know what you're doing.
most of the time.
I want to apologize if we were tough on you.
no, it's what I needed to hear.
we're moving out of Villa Marsante and headed back to my hometown.
my son and I have a lot of catching up to do.
take care. - Thanks.
Mr. Jane.
thank you.
Oh, it's nothing. Forget about it.
take care. Good luck. Bye.
another minute, and I would have missed 'em.
I do hate it when people say thank you. - Why?
he likes to play the lone ranger.
who was that masked man? I never got a chance to thank him.
exactly.
uh, I don't want to alarm you, but your friend jackie has just walked in behind you,
and she is looking fierce.
Oh, I know. I asked her out to dinner.
mentalist
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
wow, Scarlett just throws the best parties.
I'm gonna go find Asra.
then I'll see who I can find.
there's Victor.
call an ambulance!
mom.
no, Oscar, stay up there!
look at it, George.
beautiful, isn't it?
look at that.
don't you feel happy and relaxed?
Yes.
say it. Tell me how you feel.
happy and relaxed.
that's good. That's very good.
so tell me, George, what's your date of birth?
I was born on the 1st of March...
and what's your mother's name?
that's-- that's a very nice name.
she was a good woman.
she liked you to tell the truth, didn't she, George?
Yes.
so tell me, how did you murder Donovan Hobar.
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we just caught a red ball.
you gonna be much longer with this one?
damn it, jane. He's in a trance, isn't he?
Wha--I'd describe it more as a-a deep relaxation.
hypnotized. You hypnotized him.
well, I was doing a favor for the organized crime unit.
those cowboys?
time to go, guys.
you know, I was just about to get the truth out of him.
uh, he killed two people.
if you walk very quietly to the door, I still might
how many times have I told you--no hypnotism?
it's illegal, and it's unethical, and you cannot keep on doing it.
just calm yourself, woman. It's no big thing.
Oh, really?
this man's lawyer is right this minute coming down the hallway, wearing a mean face.
something tells me he'll argue that point with you. Let's go.
well, let me get him out of his trance first, huh?
well, be quick about it.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to speak to my client alone.
of course. - Now.
George, nice to talk to you.
good luck with all your future endeavors.
that's mine.
so, George... George? Are you all right?
it's not funny.
it is a little. What do you got?
unincorporated country club development outside of town, ,Scarlett Marquesa, 33, female.
hostess of the party, married, one kid.
right about 10: 20 this evening, the party was in full swing.
scarlett comes runng over the balcony, clutching her throat and screaming.
she falls down to her death.
Where's the husband and the kid?
they're with neighbors, badly shook up.
we'll wait to talk to them until tomorrow morning.
poison, huh? - Must be.
frothing at the lips, discoloration.
the medical examiner thinks so, too.
but we haven't found the source yet.
we don't know where she ingested the poison.
she came from up there, but the actual poisoning could've taken place anywhere.
it's a big uh, just a moment.
excuse me.
that's interesting.
look. Look at her eyes. - What?
Hello? Use your words.
she had more mascara on her right eye than she did on her left,
which means that she was halfway through reapplying her makeup when she was poisoned, so...
she was in the... Bathroom.
the source of the poison, I have no doubt.
what do we got here?
motive.
Mr. Marquesa, I'm agent Lisbon, CBI.
Yes, thanks for coming.
these are dear friends, Asra Hadami and Mandy Riljek.
they've been looking after me and Oscar.
anything we can do.
vic, I'll make sure Jim stops by as soon as he gets back into town.
Thanks, Mandy.
take care, Victor.
please. Come in.
scarlett kept everything in here.
very organized.
we'll get it back to you just as soon as we can.
thank you.
the tox screen tells us your wife's drink was laced with rat poison.
rat poison.
who would do such a thing?
somebody who wanted to get even?
who's your guess? Whose name just popped into your head?
scarlett had no enemies.
everyone loved Scarlett.
even Asra?
Asra? Yes, they got along fine. Why ask about her?
you're having an affair with Asra, aren't you?
what? No.
no? Really? - No. Really.
and what the heck kind of police are you, anyhow, asking me a question like that?
sorry, my mistake.
are you business partners?
she's my accounts manager.
Ah, okay. Now I understand.
understand what?
doesn't matter. Do you know where her keys are?
I can't find 'em. They're not in here.
I couldn't find them. I wanted to move her car.
not to worry. I'm sure they'll show up.
what is it you do for a living, exactly?
I develop real estate.
it's a tough market.
tell me about it. But I'm confident that it'll turn around soon.
and did Scarlett work with you?
no, she was the artistic type.
she made jewelry. That was her thing.
made a pretty good business out of it, in fact...
selling to friends and neighbors.
well, what kind of jewelry was it? Was it expensive stuff?
no. Just trinkets, really-- earrings, bracelets...
can we see some?
sure.
that's very nice.
was there any particular reason for the party last night?
Scarlett's idea.
she, um, thought it was necessary to let people know we're doing fine.
and we are... doing fine.
did anybody at the party behave in an unusual manner?
any odd incidents? - No.
and you knew everybody at the party personally?
Yes, good friends.
Oh, we're gonna need a list.
sure. From the country club, mostly.
scarlett was elected chair of her women's committee there.
it's a big deal in this community, very prestigious.
I was so proud of her, but it meant she had to spend a lot more time at-- at the club.
Oscar. Stop. Please.
pardon me. Um, are we done here?
no, that's all for now. we'll be in touch if we need anything else.
very nice.
what's your deal with Asra Hadami?
well, you saw the dinner theater way in which she hugged Victor.
she's deceiving him.
I thought it was a love affair gone awry, but it isn't.
it's something else.
she's probably stealing from him.
I'll have Van Pelt pull her financials at the same time she pulls the Marquesas'.
you know, we should go take a look at this country club.
Yeah, talk to the women's committee she chairs. Bring Rigsby with you.
someone here knows the truth.
and how so?
well, poison and a message in lipstick says this murder was done by a woman.
and women have no secrets from other women.
well, unless it was a cunning man posing as a woman.
what, you think? - No.
semifinal pairs, players 23 and 45 to court one now, please. 23 and 45 to court one.
good morning, ma'am. California Bureau of Investigation. I'm detective Rigsby. This is Jane.
Hi, Heather. Nice to meet you.
everyone's been expecting you. Poor Scarlett. It's terrible.
how can I help you?
we'd like to start by talking to members of the women's committee.
sure thing.
uh, perhaps we'd, uh, gather them more discreetly?
Oh, everyone will know in minutes, anyhow.
Jackie, Patience, Mandy, the police are here, and they want to talk to us about Scarlett's murder.
come to the rose courtyard.
and, everybody, the silent auction closes shortly, so get those bids in now, folks.
I'll show you the way.
I love a silent auction.
so, uh, let's start with some names.
uh, Patience Broadbent... Mandy Riljek you've met. Jackie Shaper.
thank god you're here.
you're gonna find this maniac, won't you?
we'll try. Uh, were you all at Scarlett's party?
Yes.
Yes, we all have to go to the chairwoman's parties. It's a rule.
the chairwoman is a prestigious position, isn't it?
Oh, yes, it is.
she would make her fair share of enemies, I'd expect.
you could say that.
if you have something to say, say it.
speak your mind, bitch.
Oh, okay. You want it all out there?
he asked about enemies, and that's what you were.
she hated Scarlett because she wanted to be chair, and Scarlett whipped her butt in the election.
schooled her, right, Mandy?
Oh, I'm not getting into this one.
right. I missed out on scoring the private office with all that cool stationery with my name on it.
so I killed her.
have you any idea how idiotic you sound?
you're the idiot.
tell you what. It's probably best if we conduct interviews with each of you separately.
you're always so jealous of everybody.
do you rember anything odd happening the night of the party?
I don't know. It was just the usual mojitos and chitchat, but...
but what?
I don't know if I should tell you this, but I-I saw Scarlett arguing with Asra Hadami.
it looked kind of angry.
some say something more than business might be going on between Asra Hadami and Victor Marquesa.
I don't know if that's true, and I don't really follow the gossip.
who does?
we're told you're the gossip queen around here.
people tell me things.
so... Who's having an affair with Victor Marquesa?
I don't know. Who? Tell.
that's a funny idea?
no, it's just... No.
Victor and Asra are good friends, nothing more.
Asra had nothing to do with this. - No?
what's the general opinion? Who did this?
my guess? - Yeah.
what makes you think that?
nothing, really. I mean, Victor's a nice guy, but that's who kills women, isn't it?
their husbands, 90% of the time.
70%, I think.
he's right.
that was some great play.
you could maybe do a little more topspin on your returns, but it was a very nice play.
the answers are yes, I disliked her, no, I didn't kill her.
you hate to lose, don't you?
Yes, unlike all those many people that love it.
I'm in the semifinals, for god sake. - Yeah. Oh, of course.
good luck with that.
Yeah, I have to go.
I have another match in half an hour, and that toxic dwarf, Mandy Riljek,
is trying to outbid me in the silent auction.
what she needs two romantic nights for at the Cliffside? I don't know.
so I'll save us all some time and tell you who did this, if you like.
I'd like that very much.
Really? Why?
she's having an affair with Victor.
how do you know that?
I just have an eye for that stuff.
Asra must have killed Scarlett so that she could have Victor for herself.
don't know why. If you ask me, he's a loser.
well, thank you.
Oh, by the way, if you disliked Scarlett marquesa so much, why are you wearing earrings that she made?
she makes good earrings. It's nice to meet you.
nice meeting you, too.
you two were close, weren't you?
we were very close.
being her deputy in the women's committee, we spoke every day.
uh, did you notice anything, uh, different, about, uh, your conversations?
she talked a lot about moving away.
she was so tired of keeping up at all costs.
at all costs?
just working so hard. - Do you have a key for this?
Oh, no. Only Scarlett has a key.
this is the chairwoman's office, and that's the chairwoman's safe.
that makes sense.
I don't know anything about that.
Scarlett's keys are missing. That's interesting.
we need to get that safe open.
we're gonna need a search warrant for that.
I'm on it.
did you get anything from Scarlett's friends?
well, everybody has a different theory.
they're all hiding something. I don't know what.
did you hear anything from forensics about the lipstick on the napkin?
not yet. They're jammed up, as usual. Budget cuts.
boss, I just now got access to Asra Hadami's financials.
she cleared out her bank accounts this morning.
checking, savings-- took out about $125, 000 in cash.
going on the run maybe?
she didn't happen to buy any rat poison recently, did she?
that would be nice, but no. No record of it.
that was the Marsante security patrol calling.
they just found Hadami's house empty. She's gone.
great. A fugitive.
I-I know where she is.
CBI.
boss? I've been here nearly six months now, half a year.
what do you want? Half a cake?
I want to take lead on this interview.
okay.
okay? - Yeah. Sure.
Thanks, boss.
why were you running, miss Hadami?
no reason. Stress. I need space.
nothing to do with the argument you had with Scarlett Marquesa the night she died?
I didn't have an argument with her.
we hear differently.
no argument.
I swear, I didn't kill her. This is absurd.
no more absurd than you clearing out your accounts and abandoning your home for no reason.
maybe I need a lawyer.
say the word.
what he'll tell you--if you're not involved in the murder
best speak up.
I ran because I knew the murder would expose some issues that I would like to keep private.
such as your relationship with Mandy Riljek?
exactly. News like that could be ruinous.
true, but not the kind of thing you abandon your house for.
you said "issues." What are the other issues?
I didn't wanna have to look Victor in the face
and tell him I'd helped run everything he worked so hard for into the ground.
how did you help do that?
I borrowed money from the company's cash reserve.
how much?
a little over half a million.
and where did it go?
I made some poor investment choices that I had to cover quickly.
so you stole--- - I borrowed from the reserve.
I skimmed the money from each development deal that should have gone into the company's reserve account as backup.
we were making so many deals.
I knew I'd get it back before it would matter.
but then the deals and the funding dried up, and suddenly, that reserve became very important.
I sold anything I could get my hands on to cover the money.
take a seat.
why am I even here? I've done nothing wrong.
be with you in just one moment.
please.
well, you were found in a compromising position with a murder suspect.
how did you know how to find us anyway?
you been spying on me?
well, you outbid patience for a romantic weekend, and your husband Jim's away.
and you laughed at the idea of Victor and Asra as lovers.
nobody knows I'm here, right?
if this gets out, it'll be a huge scandal.
nobody knows you're here.
sign this, and you're good to go.
judge's clerk says we won't get a search warrant for Scarlett's safe until tomorrow morning.
then we'll go in and tear the place apart.
sorry.
you didn't hear that. It's confidential.
confidential? Oh, of course.
no, seriously. Don't tell anyone, okay?
I understand. May I leave now?
Yeah, please.
not bad. Your delivery was a bit wooden.
Wooden? Me?
Yeah, and you're Marlon Brando.
I can't believe it.
Asra's been with me for over five years.
I mean, she was with me in the trenches.
I can't believe this.
after going over your accounts, we had a couple of questions.
sure.
you've talked about cash crises in your business,
but regular cash deposits were made to your personal accounts, somewhere upwards of $5, 000.
Scarlett's deposits.
Oscar, come get your lunch.
those are some pretty hefty deposits for somebody not really working.
Where'd the money come from?
uh, her jewelry business.
I thought you said it was a small side business.
well, it was, but recently her pieces were getting a lot of interest,
and apparently, uh, she made a deal with a couple of boutiques.
do you know which ones?
I never asked.
without her money, you would have fallen behind months ago.
I know all too well it was my wife who had to save our butts recently.
dad? - What's the matter?
you made it wrong.
mommy never puts all this stuff in it.
she knows I like it plain.
can we make a compromise, buddy?
I-I need to talk to these nice police ladies.
now I'll make it better next time. I promise.
now would you please just eat the sandwich?
sorry about that. - It's not a problem.
according to your wife's phone records, she traded a lot of calls with several disposable cell phones.
well, I don't know who she would have been talking to.
in her day planner, she had a regular weekly date noted down with an address in Marysville.
she had one scheduled for later today.
do you know anything about that?
no, I don't know what that's about,
but I know she used to go to Marysville a lot for the antique jewelry markets and stuff.
excuse me.
results on the lipstick.
no traces of DNA were found, but the color, "tongue in cheek,"
is a limited edition, sold only in a few high-end stores.
tongue in cheek-- that's cute.
look, secure access to each of the stores receipt records so we can search through them.
then I want you to meet us at 65434 east boulevard.
it's in Marysville. - On my way.
I'll, uh, I'll catch up to you.
who's winning?
Oh, I don't know. I don't follow the play, to be honest.
Yeah, it's kind of silly, isn't it?
everybody's so serious over a game.
exactly. Like it matters who wins a stupid trophy.
I guess people feel they need a purpose.
Yeah, well, my purpose died this year at the age of 16.
I'm sorry. Boy or girl? - Girl.
high as a kite with one of her friends. She wrapped her car around a tree.
friend got away without a scratch, thank God.
what was her name?
once you lose a child, all this striving seems kinda ridiculous, you know?
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.
why not leave it all behind? Just go away?
I can't afford to leave. I have negative equity on my house.
Oh, nice play, Karen!
besides, these are my friends. This is all I have.
according to Scarlett's planner, the meeting's here.
let's see if we can spot the contact.
I don't know. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Hi, guys. What are you doing?
get up. This way.
I should have brought some snacks.
I don't see this working in a hurry.
Ah, you shouldn't go hungry long.
Mandy's news will have spread quickly.
everyone knows that tomorrow, the safe will be opened.
it's now or never for whoever took Scarlett's keys.
Hey, easy there.
that is antique mexican silver.
maybe next time you'll think before trying to outrun an officer of the law.
I'm assuming this isn't candy.
why were you meeting Scarlett Marquesa?
so we could exchange beauty secrets.
you mind if I smoke?
Yeah, I do.
van Pelt, what do you got?
wardell Suggs, a.k.a. "Digger."
he's been arrested for several counts of petty theft, fraud and assault.
that's very impressive.
it could be better.
why were you meeting Scarlett?
What'd she tell you about me?
nothing. She's dead.
I-I didn't have anything to do with that.
Hey, boss, come take a look.
would you look at that? The mother lode. Let's talk, huh?
the hell, I got a strike to give.
scarlett was one of my biggest customers.
painkillers, tranquilizers, diet pills-- by the hundreds.
scarlett was dealing prescription drugs? - Yep.
where did you two meet?
swap meet.
she was trying to sell that god-awful jewelry.
she looked desperate, so I told her there's easier ways to make money.
were you doing a deal tonight?
supposed to.
lately, I've been having to listen to her yammer about quitting.
then she'd buy some bag, saying this is the last time she's doing it.
of course she'd always come back.
she was gonna quit? - Yep.
a matter of fact, last couple of weeks, I've been getting calls from another girl,
saying Scarlett gave her my info.
same prissy kind of voice.
chick said she'd be interested in setting up her own situation when Scarlett quit.
does this chick have a name?
you know, I'm not big on names at first, but I do have her number.
why don't you give her a call?
digger, why are you calling me now?
uh, in your own time, man, if you'd like to take a seat.
thank you so much, ma'am.
how did you come to have Scarlett Marquesa's keys?
I took them when I went to offer my condolences to Victor.
naughty I know, but I couldn't wait.
it's not naughty. It's a felony.
you wanted to get your hands on her pill supply.
nonsense.
I opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
I had no idea there were any pills in there.
I simply wanted to measure the windows for new drapes.
I'll be the next chair of the committee.
then why not wait till it's official?
am I here because of keys?
explain the nature of your relationship with Wardell Suggs.
who?
I liked his jewelry. - Okay.
were you aware that Scarlett Marquesa was selling illegal prescription drugs in the Villa Marsante estates?
who didn't know?
well, except for you all.
if everyone knew, then why didn't anyone come forth?
and risked being ostracized or caught up in the vulgarity of it all?
not likely.
she was doing a booming business, and you wanted to be part of it, maybe a little too much.
so I killed her? Please.
hello. She was a drug dealer.
the people she dealt with must have done her in-- other dealers.
or a highly capable rival straight in the middle of her own community?
you have found no drugs or poison on me or in my home.
the keys were taken aftershe was killed, and I only opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
you taped together your whole theory with a couple of random conversations I've had with a drug dealer.
does that about sum it up?
well, when she puts it like that, it does seem pretty thin.
Yeah. She's a piece of work, isn't she?
we're gonna have to cut her loose for now, but I think some discreet surveillance might help our cause.
if you were thinking of trying that on, don't. Not your shade.
what do you think about older women?
where is this coming from? I don't think about older women. My mother's an older woman.
not old old, just older, you know? Older than you.
why you asking?
you're not trying to set me up with somebody, are you?
it turns out--if you look at the available scientific evidence on the internet
and they've got less hang-ups, they like themselves way more than younger women,
and they're at their sexual peak.
I mean, that's what the research says anyhow.
what the hell happened to you at that country club?
nothing. I'm just saying that-- Oh, no. She spotted us.
afternoon, boys.
I was making myself a pani and thought I'd bring you some, too.
Thanks, ma'am.
Oh, and just so you know, I am headed to the club for a massage,
so you don't need to follow too close.
relax. Have a bite to eat first. I'll see you there.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am. What is wrong with you?
well, she surprised me.
what's in the sandwiches?
well, it's a pani, if you don't mind.
it's, uh, ham and cheese. - Yeah, who knows what else?
drugs? I can't believe it.
using jewelry sales as a cover, your wife was dealing prescription drugs-- painkillers mostly.
speed, diet pills.
some of them were coming in from Mexico, other ones were stolen from pharmacies.
you seem genuinely surprised.
a lot of people around here knew about her.
I had no idea.
you don't think I had something to do with this?
she was moving an awful lot of inventory.
I had nothing to do with this.
how could you have not known she was medicating half the women in the neighborhood?
she lied to me.
maybe she was just trying to protect me from the shame.
or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind eye, as long as the money was coming in.
no. If I had known she was doing this, I would have tried to stop her.
I'm Patrick.
you want to talk, Oscar?
pretty heavy stuff going on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your mom.
me, too.
my dad is sad because you guys can't find who did it.
but I don't mind about that.
I just want her back.
she can't come back. You know that, don't you?
I know that. I'm 9.
I will never see her again until I'm dead, too.
then I'll go stay with her in heaven.
well, that sounds good.
but you know what I noticed you're really good at that could help you right now?
what?
make-believe.
Yeah. I am.
you are very good at it.
a master like you, you wanted to talk to your mom,
you could make-believe she was here and do whatever you like. I do it all the time.
you talk to my mom? - No, not your mom. I talk to my wife.
she's dead? - Yeah. Yeah.
but I talk to her all the time. You should try it. It's very good.
I guess. - Well, whatever.
this is cool.
you any good with this sword?
I'm okay.
Oh, really?
I got you!
please. Mercy. Mercy.
fair maiden. D'artagnan, I have to go. Good-bye.
Ugh, spa stuff takes forever.
how long can a massage be?
no, they do all sorts of things to you besides a massage-- facials, waxing, mud.
how do you know so much?
I bought a certificate for my mom.
Wayne. You're back again. How nice.
Hi, Mrs. Shaper.
now you know, you must call me jackie.
and it's "Ms." Not "Mrs." divorced.
sorry... Jackie.
he was a good man, but weak, essentially. He just couldn't see.
wait. What are you wearing on your lips?
excuse me? - The color. What--what color is this?
tongue in cheek. You like it?
where did you get it?
I bought it at the boutique in town.
how long have you been wearing this shade?
I just bought it today.
I saw it on Patience Broadbent at Scarlett's party.
I just had to have it.
it's a crazy price, but what the heck?
you're positive that it's tongue in cheek?
I have it right here.
and you definitely saw Patience wearing it first at Scarlett Marquesa's party?
is that a pickup line?
no detectable prints on the knife.
surveillance tapes?
the spa didn't believe in them. Something to do with disturbing the chi.
I don't get it. Why kill Patience? Why now?
perhaps it was part of the plan all along.
no, this was hasty. Patience became the new target.
revenge for Scarlett's death?
Victor was quick to anger.
Rigsby, find out Victor Marquesa's recent whereabouts.
Yes, boss.
it could have been someone else.
the competition wiping out the dealer and her heir apparent or...
or what?
Victor does fit nicely, doesn't he?
Yeah.
can you believe that Patience got stabbed?
it's like a mafia hit.
I'm never going in that spa again, I will tell you that.
tragic set of events.
I didn't see it coming.
so what do you think? This is some kind of drug war?
could be, but stabbings are usually crimes of passion.
this is, uh, this is very personal.
so what's next?
CBI are already putting the pieces together.
in fact, uh... W--never mind.
what?
no, I-I shouldn't talk about it 'cause it's still an ongoing case.
you know, you can't just leave something like that hanging.
well, I'm sorry, you know, but I will get myself in a lot of trouble.
Oh, come on, girls.
all right, listen.
can you promise me that this will just stay between us?
Yes. Yes, of course.
you promise? - I promise.
okay, we're going after Victor Marquesa.
Victor? Oh, I don't believe it. He doesn't even look like the type.
on what grounds?
we think that he killed Patience out of revenge for the murder of his wife.
but you said there was no proof Patience was guilty.
I guess Victor didn't want to wait around for proof.
what's gonna happen to Oscar?
mother murdered, now dad's a murder.
once they arrest the father, he'll be placed in foster care.
Oh, how dreadful.
that poor child. - It is.
I guess they couldn't keep the secret.
guess they can't.
let's do it.
it's gonna be all right, son. -Dad!
I promise. - No!
it's gonna be okay. - Where are you going?
don't worry! I'll be right back!
No! Dad!
come back! No! No, no, no.
stop, stop, stop. You have to stop this.
no. No, we can't. This is justice being served.
how can you say that? Look what you're putting that boy through.
he'll forget eventually. It's fine.
no. No, he won't. No. No, it's not. - It's fine. Why?
because I did it! I killed them.
I killed them both. Oh, god.
I first suspected it was you because it seemed that everybody else at the club wore some of Scarlett's jewelry,
but not you.
that's it? Jewelry?
the more we talked, the more I felt your pain and anger.
losing your daughter has unhinged you.
Unhinged?
Yeah, I suppose it has.
my daughter...
she loved to dance.
didn't matter what kind of music either, a toe would start tapping and...
she was just so full of life.
she had taken several inkillers with alcohol before she got behind the wheel.
one of her neighborhood friends got them from her mother who got them from Scarlett.
I understand your anger.
it was like they ripped my soul out clean.
but the rest of the world just kept moving right along.
it was like I was the only one who remembered what happened.
so when I...Saw her flitting about town, selling her pills without a care in the world,
still hosting parties at her house, happily dancing around without a stitch of the misery I was carrying, I snapped.
I killed her.
I didn't want any other person to have to experience what I did.
and Patience?
she told everyone at the club not to worry.
she was gonna take over Scarlett's business and keep the pills coming,
like nothing had happened, like no lessons had been learned.
I had to finish what i started.
I had to.
I'll get this transcribed for you to sign.
now that it's done, does it feel better?
it doesn't change a thing.
agent Lisbon.
Mr. Marquesa, hi.
I want to thank you and your team.
although, I must admit, that whole scene in front of the house
it was make-believe, dad.
sorry. The make-believe was a bit unorthodox and unpleasant,
but I'm sure you all know what you're doing.
most of the time.
I want to apologize if we were tough on you.
no, it's what I needed to hear.
we're moving out of Villa Marsante and headed back to my hometown.
my son and I have a lot of catching up to do.
take care. - Thanks.
Mr. Jane.
thank you.
Oh, it's nothing. Forget about it.
take care. Good luck. Bye.
another minute, and I would have missed 'em.
I do hate it when people say thank you. - Why?
he likes to play the lone ranger.
who was that masked man? I never got a chance to thank him.
exactly.
uh, I don't want to alarm you, but your friend jackie has just walked in behind you,
and she is looking fierce.
Oh, I know. I asked her out to dinner.
mentalist
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
Hey, tommy.
good morning, Mr. Jane.
you're all set.
have a good one. - You, too. Have a good one.
restricted
good morning, everybody.
what's so good about it?
here, have a file. The division's being audited again.
no problem. Let me just put milk in this, and I'll dig in.
no problem. What's with her?
you mean, why isn't she cynical and jaded like you?
notice her relaxed body language, the general sense of emotional satisfaction?
Yeah.
someone's engaged her romantic interest.
who?
well, I couldn't say.
Nah, she's focused on her work, that's all.
well, then I have to assume that the man that kissed her outside was making an embarrassing mistake.
what? Who kissed her?
uh, I didn't catch his name.
Ah, it's probably that knucklehead from payroll.
he's been stalking her like a chicken.
what did this man look like?
how do you stalk a chicken?
you know what I'm talking about.
there's a very large bomb nearby?
are you smart enough to find it?
another bomb threat. That's the third this year.
not on my phone, it isn't.
well, granted, they don't usually come through CBI, but that's what the drills are for.
the text read, "Are you smart enough to find it?"
I think this was directed at me.
of course you think this is about you.
just relax. It could be a hoax.
it could be.
where is the bomb squad? - They're on their way now.
PD did an initial sweep of the building.
so far, they haven't to find it?
are you smart enough to find it?
okay, listen, if this really is about Jane, I don't want him just--I
Jane, stop right there!
Minelli. Yes, sir.
let me explain what happened.
Jane got a text on his phone.
the text said, a very large bomb.
a large bomb can only be transported in a large car.
they didn't say inside CBI. They said nearby.
ergo, the parking lot. Simple.
exactly. They challenged you to an easy puzzle.
they want you to find the bomb.
if there is a bomb. It could be just a hoax, like you said.
yes sir. I'll have him back in a minute.
I'm trying, sir.
Lisbon! Found it!
Oh, no.
shoot it out! Shout it out with your gun!
I-I can't! There's no time! Come on!
Jane, come on, let's go! Come on, run, Jane! Jane, run!
I mean it, come on! Jane! Run, run!
I'm okay. - You all right?
I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm fine.
I'm gonna get you-- I need an ambulance now!
no, no ambulance. I just got something in my eyes.
I can't see. I can't see!
you're a lucky man, Mr. Jane.
this could have been much worse.
Yes, that's what peoplettkeep telling me.
but why is it I can't see, doc?
well, there's a moderate concussion with some short-term memory loss,
disorientation, headache, and of course, fleeting blindness.
it's most likely due to small floating blood clots in the vessels around the eyes, demonstrating a CVI.
or cortical visual impairment.
how long will his vision be affected?
well, it's hard to say, really.
the body's healing powers are unpredictable, but 48 to 72 hours is the norm.
we must wait and see, so to speak.
humor. Great.
everybody loves a witty doctor in times of trouble.
you know, I've heard enough.
do you think you can take this conversation outside, please?
Mr. Jane, this is temporary.
your sight will return and you'll be back to work, but it's gonna take time and patience.
well, time I have, but patience I lost a while ago.
you're alive. Appreciate it.
Oh, I do. Believe me, I do.
now if you'll excuse me, I'll check in again later.
thank you, doctor.
I'll do worse if you don't stop mouthing off to people who are trying to help you.
you pinched me. - How is he?
guess what. He's a bad patient.
who would've thought?
I'm not a bad patient. She's a bad visitor.
What'd you find out?
the victim is James Medina, 44, stockbroker, out of highlands.
the van wasn't his. It was reported stolen yesterday.
we're digging up everything we can on Medina.
the question--is it possible he was on some bizarre suicide mission?
no. I looked in his eyes.
that was very much a man who didn't want to be where he was.
whoever did this wanted me to watch James Medina die in terror.
they nearly killed you, too.
well, that wasn't the intention, though.
well, what then?
"you're next" was written on the man's forehead.
Why?
I don't know why.
you're gonna be fine. - Yeah, probably.
we're gonna find who did this. - Good.
Oh, please don't look at each other like that.
like what? You can't see.
I can feel. I can feel your pity.
Oh, please. Would you stop? We'll be back.
later, man.
thank you, Rose.
all righty, you two. I love you.
you be good with yoyo auntie Rose now, okay? You promise?
Bye.
sweet kids. - Thank you.
Jim loved them very much.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Medina, but we have to ask you a couple questions about your husband.
he didn't seem preoccupied, trouble by anything unusual?
preoccupied, yes, but there's nothing unusual about that.
my husband was a stockbroker, and nowadays, that's like being a professional gambler.
what about your personal finances?
I never let Jim put all our money into the stock market.
did he ever mention any particular client being unhappy?
do you know how much clients have lost their money in the last six months?
a lot of people are angry, and they blame their brokers.
Jim's received hate mail, phone calls, e-mails.
any specific threats? Did he ever mention names?
there was an ex-coworker, Terry Andrews.
he came by the house a few times. He was very threatening.
thank you.
Terence Carter Andrews, 46 years old, worked for two years at Lynch-Halstead in the junior trader program.
tax records indicate that he also worked as a guard for several security companies.
that cover the state capitol system.
he was a state house employee?
he worked here?
that's what it says.
he also has a rap sheet on him-- domestic violence and two DUIs.
this is him?
where is he working now?
guest relations manager at something called Hype.
you, little miss fierce, can come in.
lose the backup dancer. He's too, too butch.
get lost, fluffy.
are you Terence Andrews?
what do you guys want?
do people call you Terry or Terence?
they call me Mr. Andrews.
someone killed James Medina today. Thoughts?
Yeah.
I'd like to buy whoever did it a nice bottle of French brandy.
flat-out hated him, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, I did.
what, do you think I had something to do with it?
Yeah, it crossed our minds.
why don't you come downtown with us, answer a few questions?
no, I don't think so. You know why? Because I didn't do it.
come on, man. Let's go. - Get off me!
now you want some, too? - No, thank you.
okay, everybody step back. Give him some air. Fun's over.
are you okay, Mr. Andrews?
Hey, aren't you supposed to be in the hospital?
Nope. - Yes, you are.
no, they've had enough of me. Can't say I blame 'em.
officer Powell here was kind enough to give me a ride back.
thank you. I guess.
have a good one, Mr. Jane. - Yeah.
go ahead. Talk to your boyfriend. I don't mind.
shush.
why are you embarrassed? - I'm not.
what the hell-- - oh, doctor's orders.
she said it was the best thing for me to do--get back to work.
she did not. She said you insulted the entire ward and were a complete pain in the ass.
Nah. So?
so you can't do that.
well, what was I supposed to do, just sit there and listen to television?
besides, the food was terrible.
you need the rest. - I need to work.
you're blind. - No problem, honestly.
my other senses are heightened. They're super heightened. I'm like Daredevil.
now if you'll excuse me... - Okay .
okay.
heightened.
where were you yesterday morning?
my shift at the club ended at 3: 30.
I went back to my place, watched a little bit of TV, then I went to bed.
I slept till about 11: 00 or so.
anyone who can vouch for that time frame? - No.
I live alone, on account of my lady walked out on me when I lost my job.
sorry. Don't mind me. - Jane?
what is this? What is this?
he's blind. - Yeah.
uh, sorry.
cool, huh?
Yeah, so, uh, did you kill James Medina?
did I kill James Medina? Screw him.
I didn't kill him.
I could have and I wanted to, but I didn't.
what are you doing?
have we ever met before?
no.
so what happened?
why did you and Medina fighghin the first place?
I was a junior trader in the company's program.
and he had been picking on me for months. I took a job his nephew wanted.
anyway, a freakin' envelope falls off his desk.
"pick it up," he said. Like that, "pick it up."
I don't think so.
"pick it up your own damn self," I said.
big deal. But I guess he figures I'm just, you know,
I'm gonna snap my fingers and totally just ruin this dude's life.
can I hold your hand?
artistic fingers.
soft. - Don't do that.
nice to talk with you, Terry. Be well. You can let him go.
uh, that's, uh, not your call.
well, I didn't say you must let him go.
I said that you can, if you want.
being that he's innocent.
thank you. - Jane?
Oh, that was loud. That scared me.
how many times do I have to tell you to stop interrupting interviews like that?
Oh, I'm sorry.
just a minute. - What are you doing?
how will I know if I can see or not if I have bandages on?
here goes.
well?
black as night. - I'm sorry.
never mind. Andrews didn't do it.
did you sense that with your superpowers?
Yes, I did.
uh, he's filled with anger, but, uh, not fearful, guilty, murderous anger.
that has a tang of ammonia about it.
his is a more clean, righteous anger. Lemon-y.
Lemon-y?
this blind thing really works.
without my vision, I can tune into my other senses much more clearly.
that's great. Let me go make you a superhero costume.
what do you wanna be called? What are you doing?
I wanna know what your face feels like when you're smiling.
uh, so what's the deal, boss?
have forensics check him for any explosives residue.
if he comes up clean, let him go.
will do.
I'm still convinced there's a connection between medina and me,
so before you make me that superhero costume I'm looking forward to,
could you take me to visit with his widow?
maybe. - Thank you.
and incidentally, you're smelling particularly good today.
is that cinnamon in the mix there somewhere? Lisbon?
your tea is right in front of you, Mr. Jane.
Ah, thank you. - You're welcome.
Mrs. Medina, we don't mean to keep you from your family.
we just have a few more questions to ask you.
I understand. I'm... Happy to help.
I can feel what a warm, caring home this is.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I think whoever did this was targeting your husband and me also.
I don't know why, but something links us.
I have to ask, have we ever met before?
not that I know of.
would it be a terrible inconvenience to show me some of your husband's personal things?
jewelry, anything he used a lot?
sure. I guess. Why?
holding something of James' would help me pick up a feel for him, get a sense of his being.
okay. Excuse me.
thank you.
a sense of his being? What are you playing at?
just go with it.
I have to practice this touchy-feely stuff. It's been a while.
you're not gonna be blind forever.
no, right, 'cause bad stuff like this doesn't happen nearly as often as people think it does.
bifocals.
Jim couldn't read without them.
he was considering surgery, but I liked the way he looked in his glasses.
he held off because of me.
did he like horses?
we liked to ride together.
we were planning to take a trip up the coast this fall.
this feels expensive.
uh, yes. He only wore that to business functions.
there's a jewel with an engraving on the back. What is that engraving?
it's a bull.
it was a company gift from Lynch-Halstead.
a little too much bling for jim's everyday taste.
well, uh, thank you for your time, Mrs. Medina.
the watch I recalled was the exact same.
it had the same engraving on the back as James Medina's and his was from Lynch-Halstead.
thank you.
so, years ago, I must've done a psychic reading for someone else connected to the firm.
you don't know who?
I can't remember.
I tried to see the woman's face, recall her name.
I-I just can't do it.
but she paid you and was hurt so badly she's still holding a grudge.
well, probably.
the man's blind. Go easy, maybe.
sorry. - Oh, it's okay. You're fine.
did you keep a record of all your customers or clients or whatever you called them?
Yeah, I had to.
I had to keep track of all the lies i'd already told them.
Oh, where are they?
uh, probably on a disk in my boxes over there, I expect.
van Pelt, why don't you help jane find his records?
Oh, first, could someone please make me a cup of tea?
is that a yes?
thank you.
did you put the milk in-- milk in first? - Yep. Just like you asked.
you sure the water boiled-- - was truly boiling? Yep.
tastes weird. - Tastes weird?
Jane, I need to ask you a favor.
I need you to, uh... I need to you find out from Van Pelt about this guy she's dating.
you know, what's the score? - The score?
is it serious? Are they, uh, you know?
ask her yourself. - Yeah, right. No. Come on.
you know the situation. It's against the rules-- relationships between coworkers.
what are you, a man or a mouse? - Well, man, obviously.
could've fooled me.
if it's that guy from payroll, I will kill him.
well, that would be a strong, romantic statement.
women like a man that would kill for them.
Hey, Van Pelt! - Don't!
what? - No. No.
trust me. Honesty's better. - No.
what's up?
grace, personal question.
Rigsby and I were wondering, uh...
who is this man you were kissing by the coffee cart?
that's... That's none of your business. - Not from payroll?
payroll? No, he doesn't even work here. It's none of your business.
well, thank heavens for that, at least.
no killing needed.
don't be so sure. - You'll see. Honesty's best.
Yeah, well, honestly, I'd like to kick your butt right now.
I'll take you.
but could you take me to my couch first, please?
Yes. - Thank you.
you're in your office. Here's the table on the left. - Yep.
here's the couch. - All right.
you're very good at this. Thank you. Thanks for your lovely tea.
that was cruel. Why did you do that?
Oh, it's this blindness nuisance. It makese meme.
I'm--I'm sorry.
but you two do need to talk.
there's nothing to talk about.
is this it? Sorry.
uh, a white CD with RPB written on it in black?
could be. You have a lot to talk about.
like what?
is it serious-- you and coffee cart man?
it's too early to tell.
I'd like to meet him. What floor does he work on?
he doesn't. He's a lawyer. He was just visiting.
and no offense, but why does my personal life have any concern to you...or Rigsby, for that matter?
well, me--I'm just nosy.
but Rigsby--he loves you.
he's just scared of emotional commitment.
and you're attracted to him, but you're deeply repressed and emotionally shut down.
Oh, is that right?
because of a trauma in your past that you've never spoken of to anyone, ever--even yourself.
sorry. I was just thinking out loud.
what? I wasn't listening.
what's his name? - Dan.
Dan? Can I meet him?
if you like.
I would.
here's your client list.
I'll run it against the Lynch-Halstead records.
one match.
you both shared a client a long time ago--Carol Gentry?
she forgives you, Carol.
your mother truly forgives you.
I don't understand, Mr. Jane.
she forgives me?
Yes. That's what she says.
and I believe it to be sincere.
she was a vicious, evil, abusive woman, but I loved her and cared for her like a good daughter.
what did I ever do that she should forgive me for?
it's a hard truth, Carol, that people don't change when they pass on.
they simply become the essence of who they are.
your mother was a very complicated woman-- - she forgives me?
that lunatic bitch forgives me?
people are very complicated.
aren't they?
I'm afraid that's all we have time for this week, Carol.
okay. Yeah. I'm sorry. I just...
it's okay. Just breathe.
we'll talk more about this next time, shall we? - Yeah.
okay. - Okay.
thank you, Mr. Jane. - Thank you.
Jane? Are you all right?
Jane? Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
is he all right?
Oh, I'm 100% okay. No need to send me back.
sir, he needs to be in the hospital.
he has to go if you order him to.
I could, but someone did try to kill him, remember?
we can protect him better here... at less expense.
Thanks, Virgil.
okay, but this is a favor.
if you die in this department, I'm responsible.
I do all the paperwork.
in fact, if he does die for whatever reason, move him to a public area, would you?
I'd be very grateful.
I hope he's smiling. - Places to be!
don't we all.
a little help here?
just the stick. Just the stick.
thank you.
we started doing research on your old client, Carol Gentry.
she's not a suspect.
Lynch-Halstead were her brokerage firm for a while.
just a coincidence. She's not a suspect.
how can you be so sure?
Carol Gentry killed herself eight years ago.
she left no family.
you all still here? - We're all here.
good.
so back to square one, I guess?
not quite. Van Pelt's done some deeper research.
we cross-checked the spouse's names and came up with a second hit.
you used to have a client named Jill Lamont.
her husband was Paul Krager, and he used to work for Lynch-Halstead.
Yes.
tell me more about your husband--just anything.
he loves me, loves our son.
family is everything to him.
but I've noticed a change... Lately.
what sort of a change?
he seems, uh... Preoccupied.
and that's when you began to wonder if he was being unfaithful?
that's right. - All right.
something's coming through.
feel it with me.
here.
Yes, I'm feeling that paul hasn't been 100% honest with you.
he hasn't been happy.
you know that, don't you?
Yes.
do you sense someone else in his life?
your senses never lie.
Yes. Yes, I do.
okay.
there's someone else. Is he leaving me?
you have to talk to him, Jill.
you have to tell Paul not to ruin what you have together.
paul Krager's a name I haven't heard in a while.
it never even entered my mind.
what do you know about his personal life?
we've all made our mistakes over the years.
fat wallets and good wine can do that to a man.
you're referring to his divorce?
that was no divorce. That was a massacre.
his wife remarried, I think.
but Krager's whole world fell apart.
Work-wise, he never recovered. Went off the rails, to be frank. We had to let him go.
who actually did the firing?
now that you mention it, Jimmy Medina did.
Jim did a lot of the ax work here-- unfortunate part of the job.
any idea where we can find Krager now?
last I heard, someone saw him at a church soup kitchen during the holidays.
Therbubufor the grace of god, if you know what I mean.
well, Lynch was right. The legal fees alone nearly bankrupted Krager.
his wife took their son, moved east and remarried.
so where's Krager now?
well, based on we could find, he was so devastated losing his family, his whole world collapsed.
no permanent address. He hasn't filed a tax return in years.
his last known employer was Lynch-Halstead in 2001.
boy, you really did a number on him.
Yes, I did. Thank you.
no, you simply confirmed what she knew in her heart already.
has anyone tried contacting her? Jill Lamont?
Yeah, I left word. No answer yet.
I put an APB out on Paul Krager.
Cho and I are gonna follow up on some leads.
you stay right there.
nobody take him anywhere. No excitement whatsoever. Clear?
clear, boss. - Crystal.
did you see how many clients Jane had?
well, I guess he helped a lot of people.
I'm not so sure.
can I help you?
what are you doing here?
I was at another meeting upstairs. Thought i'd stop by and say hello.
is that cool?
Yeah, totally. You know, it's just a surprise, that's all.
so, um...
introduce me to your colleague, who keeps staring at me so strangely.
Yeah.
agent Rigsby?
this is my friend, Dan Hollenbeck.
good to meet you. - How you doing?
uh, I'm excellent. And you?
good. Yeah.
okay, so... - A lawyer, are you?
I am.
I'm sorry. Do we have a problem?
no. No problem. It takes all sorts, even lawyers.
okay, that's enough.
pleasure to get to know you, agent Rigsby.
can we... Can we be somewhere private for a moment?
I don't know if that's such a...good idea. - Please?
you know what? I'm sorry. You and me do have a problem.
not a big one, but we do need to talk.
no trouble, I swear.
all right, then.
no, it is not all right. - No trouble. I promise.
it's okay, Grace. It's fine. - Okay.
so here we are. Talk away.
I don't know you, Dan. Maybe you're a nice guy. I hope so. I don't know.
because if you ever hurt Grace Van Pelt, I will find you and I will cause you pain,
because she means a lot to-- to the unit.
so you treat her right, okay?
Yeah, I hear you. I appreciate your concern.
you care for Grace. Don't worry. I'm a...
I'm a nice guy.
okay. Hey, uh, I'm sorry to get heavy with you.
I had to say it, you know?
just so long as we understand each other.
Yeah, sure thing. I understand. I do.
I am so embarrassed.
what did Rigsby say to you?
no call for embarrassment. He's a good-hearted person. I like him.
he just wants you to be happy... or else.
and what did you say?
well, I'd say I did my best.
you did? - I did.
Hey, where is this psychic character you told me about?
I'm dying to meet him.
he wanted to meet you, too.
damn.
sorry. I didn't know whether to wake you or not.
I'm awake.
you said you wanted to meet the man I've been dating.
Yeah. Is he coming? - he's here.
here? Here now?
Yes. - Right here.
Dan Hollenbeck, sir.
it's a real pleasure to meet you.
grace has told me so much about you.
good to meet you, too, Dan.
excuse my asking, but are you...blind? - Yes, as a bat.
temporarily blind. Think positive.
Yes, positive. That's right.
so, Van Pelt, where is Rigsby exactly?
I don't know. Out getting pizza, if I know Rigsby.
you need him for something?
Lisbon? Cho?
still chasing down Paul Krager.
nobody here but us. - Of course.
so, Dan, quite the hard grip you have there.
working man's hands.
that, uh, faint scent of chemicals but an expensive Italian suit. It's interesting.
Dan's a lawyer.
a very junior lawyer. I lobby the State Senate.
but you're good with your hands. You're good at building things as a hobby, maybe.
I guess.
what sort of things do you build as a hobby?
you know, stuff.
and your parents? Where are they?
they're dead.
sorry to be a busybody. I just wanna be sure Grace finds the right young man.
hush.
well, I'm hungry. I-I guess I'll just, uh, get myself something to eat.
don't be silly. I'll get you something. - No, no, no, no, I-- it's okay. I can manage.
think I'm dumb?
make the wrong move, and I'll shoot her in the head.
I hear you.
what are you guys whispering about?
nothing. Some chips would be nice.
what kind?
I'm easy.
it's the boss.
looks like we've cracked it.
we found Paul Krager.
he was obsessed with Jane and Medina.
remember he has a son?
well, Krager told us he's living in the city now.
he goes by the name Dan Hollenbeck.
sorry about this. - Van Pelt?
that was weird.
I don't understand.
he's the bomber.
he killed James Medina, and now he's come to kill me.
don't even think about it.
I'm sorry I had to lie to you, Grace, truly.
but I needed you. - Why?
to access the state house lot.
he used your security pass.
you son of a bitch.
just be cool, Van Pelt. Please, be cool.
grace, relax.
I have no desire to hurt you.
give it up, Dan, please?
I'm in too deep. I can't stop now.
don't make me hurt you.
just do as he says.
Oh, you're a nice guy now, aren't you?
you destroyed my life for what?
because my dad cheated on my mom?
big deal. He wasn't perfect.
and for that, he's on the street.
he loses everything!
one day, I'm at the best-- the best private school in Los Angeles.
I'm playing soccer with movie stars' kids.
next minute, I'm in dogpatch, New Jersey, with my weeping mom,
getting my ass whipped by thugs that don't even speak freaking english.
Why?
because you--you had to be the man who knows.
you had to tell my mom the truth.
I'm sorry, Dan.
Yeah, sure you are, with a gun at your back.
take out your ndcuffs.
handcuff yourself.
behind the back. Drop the cane.
okay. Here we go.
let's go. - Where are we going?
somewhere quiet and private. You won't like it.
Where's your car, Grace?
in the side parking lot.
a jeep, Iowa plates.
I didn't know you were from Iowa. Famous potatoes, huh?
that's Idaho, you ignorant jerk.
Oh, yeah? What's Iowa famous for?
gullible women.
that's not fair. - Keep moving.
uh, Tommy, you still here?
Hey, Mr. Jane. Uh, just locking up.
you folks need anything?
run! Run, Grace!
Freeze!
Jane, go to the right. All right.
okay, you're gonna take this to your car.
but I can't drive. - We'll manage. Keys, keys.
uh, i-in the left front pants p-pocket. - Sorry.
got her. All right, come on.
the jeep's on the right. - Got it?
hang on.
on the dash or on the column - On the--on the column.
up. Up. Okay.
that's--that's reverse. Good?
all--all clear? - Back it up. Yeah, slow. Slow.
okay, yeah, slow, slow, slow, slow.
straight. - Okay, I got it.
okay, to the right.
no, no, not yet! Not yet!
punch it, punch it, punch it! Go to the right! Wait.
reverse, reverse, reverse.
you all right? - Go, go, go. Yeah, reverse, reverse.
come on. Come on. Come on, come on.
Jane, no!
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god.
what? What happened? Did something good happen?
didn't I say no excitement of any kind?
Oh, you're alive. Are you okay?
Yeah. It's no bother. I'm fine.
I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry.
it's all right. It's all right.
sorry about that.
I have an H746b form to fill out. Yeah.
Oh, you have no notion how good it is to see your face, Rigsby.
you're funny.

okay, the lady in red-- guess.
she's, um... Allergic to perfume.
it's... It's a good guess. She just sneezed.
she's having an affair. Next?
hold on. Having an affair? You made that up.
not at all. If you look closely, she has a very peculiar...

you got a job to do, you do it right.
stop. Put your hands in the air now.
make a federal case out of it, why don't you?
drop it. Drop the blanket.
your hands, sir. Both hands.
that's gratitude for you.
put your hands above your head!
I bring you a gift, and this is how I'm treated?
what gift?
I dragged, uh, three blocks.
pupils are dilated.
are you on drugs, mister, uh...
I don't do drugs. Crack is whack.
steady pulse.
steady as a rock for someone that dragged a body three blocks.
let me handle this, jane. I'll do it.
so this is a gift, huh? Is that why you brought her here to us?
her? Them.
there's more than one?
it's a whole bagful, fella. What do you need, glasses?
a bagful of what?
potatoes. - Potatoes.
I'm supposed to deliver them to the police.
you are the police, right? - Near enough.
he's a perfect subject.
subject? - For implanting a suggestion. He's hypnotized.
he's lying. Is he?
Oh, given that the girl he dragged in here dead is not actually a bag of spuds like he says, then yeah.
well, it's not lying if he believes it.
okay. Thank you.
so, carl, why would you bring a bag of potatoes to the police?
uh, I-I don't--I-I can't.
potatoes to cops? Potatoes.
not doughnuts, but potatoes.
did someone tell you to do it?
Yes! Yes. - Who?
I can't remember. - Try.
I'm trying.
what if I told you it wasn't potatoes?
that in fact, it was a dead girl you were dragging around?
you have a twisted sense of humor.
here's proof, Carl. What do you see there?
potatoes.
he is crazy. - Nope. Just hypnotized.
Oh, come on.
hypnosis is just a way to connect to the imagination rather than the conscious mind.
the mind will accept whatever the imagination creates, however bizarre.
hypnotism is what you use against my explicit orders to get witnesses to tell the truth.
it's a little different than convincing somebody that a dead girl is a sack of vegetables.
different in scale.
well, he doesn't look like he's in a trance or anything.
neither did Minelli when I hypnotized him to stop smoking.
the subject acts normally except inside the suggestion.
Carl's suggestion is to have this very powerful hallucination and to forget who did this.
whoever hypnotized him, I gotta say... Good.
good enough to hypnotize Carl into killing a girl?
well, that depends on whether deep down, Carl really wanted to kill a girl.
but he's hypnotized.
uh, no suggestion in the world can make you do something against your moral character,
against your true will.
a hypnotized saint is still a saint.
not that he's a saint.
uh, so if Carl's a killer, he cane hypnotized to kill. Otherwise...
otherwise the hypnotist killed the girl and framed Carl for it.
so is Carl a killer? What did we find out about him?
he sells cars, boats, stuff like that.
and you know this how?
well, he's very well-mannered, a little over-groomed, too badly dressed to be gay, so salesman.
he works a dealership over on Fulton.
does he have a record?
not even a parking ticket.
he's a good boy, obeys authority-- a perfect subject for a trance.
he's all soft and squishy and malleable.
well, can you fix him with a trance or whatever? Make him remember what happened?
well, I could try, but without knowing the trigger,
it'll be like you and I playing marco polo in the atlantic.
it'll take forever, and you get all pruny.
easier just to find the hypnotist and ask him.
got an i. d.on the victim.
her fingerprints were on file with the school board.
she's Mary Beth Hendrix, 27.
her sister's on the way from the airport now.
Yes. Mm, that's Mary Beth.
she, uh... Someone shot her?
gunshot wound to the head. I'm sorry.
the coroner says she died instantly.
I can't believe it.
she was fine when I left.
you live together?
um, yeah.
two country girls in the big city.
I didnt want to come here, but Mary Beth said she'd take care of me.
that's funny, huh?
Lindsay? Your trip to san francisco?
um, just overnight, for work.
I had just landed when you called.
Mary Beth's an elementary school teacher, right?
um, she was, yeah.
but last year I got her a job where I work, at the model life centre downtown.
Mary Beth was the boss' assistant.
and I'm an event planner.
I help the doctor plan n. l.p. seminars around the country.
what's N. L. P?
neuro-linguistic programming.
uh, well, "sneaky ways to influence people" doesn't sound quite as catchy.
well, dr. Daniel changes lives. - Royston Daniel?
Yes. He's the best.
who's Royston Daniel?
Dr. Royston Daniel is one of the country's preeminent hypnotherapists.
Mary Beth is dead?
Oh, my god.
you knew Mary Beth then?
sure. I-i met her at the model life centre.
I'm taking dr. Daniel's n. l.p. course, to help me be a better salesman.
did you spend a lot of time with Mary Beth?
at the monday class...
uh, I didn't understand the exercise.
Mary Beth spent her whole lunch explaining it to me.
she's a great teacher. Patient, you know?
even with a dope like me.
so now do you remember who hypnotized you?
I got nothing. I'm sorry.
Mary Beth-- what happened to her?
we should go take a look at Daniel and this model life centre.
let's bring Carl. - What for?
uh, it's where the hypnotists are.
Carl is still our prime suspect in this.
we can't use him as bait.
well, as long as we don't lose him or break him, then what's the problem?
get what you want from whoever you want--scam.
not to mention bad grammar.
neuro-linguistic programming is not a scam.
it's the science of willpower and persuasion and communicating more deeply.
a way to better your life. - Yeah, scam.
a scam that can better your life.
Ooh, deep. You two stay here.
good afternoon. My name is dr. Royston Daniel, and I'm gonna teach you the secrets of neuro-linguistic programming.
many of you may not fully believe in the power of trance, but I promise, you will.
excuse me, young man. This is not the moment.
wake.
what's going on?
Dr. Daniel, what happened?
ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause for Mike here for being such a good sport.
as you may know, I am dr. Royston Daniel.
you're all here because you want something.
you want power or you want money, you want love, you want
I-I want a quick word with you privately.
I'm in the middle of something right now.
Oh, it's very important. It's about your boat.
my boat? I don't have a boat.
no, it's on fire.
Rick, get security, would you? Look, sir, I don't know what
sir? - Your assistant Mary Beth has been murdered.
california bureau of investigation. We'd like to speak with you.
you're gonna have to excuse me, folks.
um, my associate, mr. Rick Tiegler, will conduct the seminar from here on in.
I hope to see you again soon.
okay.
good.
as dr. Daniel has shown, trance is incredibly powerful.
we're gonna teach you how to unleash that power for yourselves.
let's start by relaxing with a few simple breathing exercises.
then we're gonna show you how to supercharge your life. How does that sound?
how does that sound?
Hi, dr. Daniel.
Carl, is this the man who hypnotized you?
let's have a look at those eyes.
do you know this man?
well, his face is familiar. Is he one of my students?
no. - Rigsby, speak to dr. Daniel. Take jane with you.
Carl and I are gonna go back to the seminar.
that way, I know he won't get lost or broken.
can we use your office?
Yes, this way.
I'll catch up.
this is terrible. Poor girl.
I had a bad feeling when she didn't come in this morning.
it's nolike her to disappear.
did she have any, uh, pr-- problems lately? Bad breakup?
anybody who might wanna hurt her?
um, I-I wouldn't know. Mary Beth's personal life was her own.
she was brought in to us by Cal Resnick out there.
he was hypnotized to think she was a big bag of potatoes.
strong stuff.
that's an old shot.
who could have done that?
Oh, very few people have the talent to create a trance that powerful. Very few.
other than you, of course.
where were you last night between midnight and 6: 00?
wait now. You think I killed Mary Beth?
did you?
well, maybe I need a lawyer here.
maybe. I wouldn't have a clue.
Rigsby, is he gonna need a lawyer?
uh, dr. Daniel, tell us about your students.
what kind of people want to get whatever they want from whoever they want?
who--who wouldn't want to make their life better?
using trance as a tool, n. l.p. can help everyone from insomniacs, Soccer moms, to high-powered executives, smokers, the weight-challenged.
anyone who wants to improve his life.
and control the lives of others?
some of my students want to sell to their customers better or make people like and respect them.
there's nothing wrong with that. Right?
excuse me. Uh, Royston, I just have the files for the, uh, advance work for the seminar in San Francisco.
Lindsay, you came in. - Yeah.
I just had to keep busy, you know?
well, thanks. But you don't belong here. Not today.
whatever this is can wait. It's not important.
what?
I'm, uh, otherwise occupied, as you can see.
go home. Grieve. Don't worry about us. We'll survive.
take care of you.
right. Sorry. This was, uh... It was a bad idea.
sorry. I'm sorry.
take care of you-- that's the smoothest blowoff I've heard all day.
I have a question for you guys
are you feeling it? - Yes!
are you feeling it? - Yeah!
are you guys feeling it? - Yeah!
all right. Now I'm gonna talk to you guys individually, okay?
and I may ask one or two of you to come up on stage and help me. Would you do that?
would you come on stage and help me? - Yeah!
what are you doing here? - What do you want me to do here?
uh, I'm sorry. I actually thought you were someone else.
sir? - I'll be right back.
Mr. Tiegler! Stop! Mr. Tiegler!
didn't like the class? - Cuffs.
looks like I caught the mystery hypnotist.
got what you want from who you want.
N. l.p. stuff seems to work.
buddy, come on.
come on, man. Let's go.
I'm not talking about Carl. I don't know anything about him.
okay. Let's talk about your job.
agent Rigsby asked around at the center.
everyone says you're dr. Daniel's number one guy.
I'm proud to assist dr. Daniel.
I'm good at what I do.
that's what the model life is all about.
if anyone could put the hex on Carl Resnick, it'you.
II wouldn't say that. No.
did you ever try your stuff on Mary Beth Hendrix?
I'm not talking about her either. - Are you a drinker, Rick? Would you like one now?
are you offering? - No.
I'm not a drunk. I'm just under a lot of stress.
I understand. Were you drunk when you killed Mary Beth?
I didn't.
that's right. You didn't.
but if something happened when you were drunk, that means you had diminished capacity.
it means you're not responsible like you normally would be.
yeah? - Yeah.
Yeah, I know that.
well, is that how it was?
maybe, uh, I don't really know. - Tell me what happened.
yesterday I-I kind of asked Mary Beth out.
she said no.
actually, she said no way... In hell.
so last night you were mad, maybe went to a bar to forget.
Yeah, I-I kind of hoisted a few. Dozen.
but I mean, come on. Every--everybody needs to let off a little steam, right?
I-I lasted till about 1: 00, and then I...
I kind of blacked out.
and then when I woke up, it was 5: 00 a. m.and I was in Mary Beth's living room.
I was standing over her body...
and I was holding a gun.
I could smell the powder, but...
I was just standing there, as calm as could be.
so you killed her?
Yeah, I-I guess I did.
but like you said, I'm--I'm not responsible.
and after you killed her, that's when you decided to use your skls to frame Carl Resnick?
we'd been partners in a trance exercise, and I'd--I'd put him under a couple of times.
after that, it just gets easier, especially with someone like carl.
he's such a cream puff.
what did you think would happen when Carl dragged a murdered girl's body to the cops?
did you think Carl was getting out of there alive?
well... - Rick, we're charging you with the murder of Mary Beth Hendrix. Stay put.
Really? - Really.
be with you in just a sec.
Oh, hey, boss.
has cho searched Tiegler's place yet?
he's getting a warrant now.
I just finished up with the student interviews.
how's it going here?
Yeah, a couple more teachers to go, uh, so far nobody knows anything about Mary Bh or Tiegler.
I can't believe Rick killed Mary Beth.
do you think dr. Daniel will set up a place to make donations in her name?
a charity for a school would be good.
he's still here? - Yeah.
I've been helping agent Rigsby parse the sub modalities of the teachers' language patterns.
translating their double-talk-- reframing, "pacing," uh, "representational systems.
I don't get half of what these guys say.
what are you doing? - What? Uh, nothing.
are you mimicking me?
it's called modeling. You, uh, model yourself on your subject.
subject? You're not trying this n. l.p. crap on me.
no. Sort of. You said this would establish a rapport.
well, it needs work. I'm going back to the office. Come and see me when you're done.
I don't believe this n. l.p. stuff works at all. - You will.
no pineapple on this one.
Oh, no, thanks. - You have to.
it's tradition. The case is closed.
there's no mm on this one.
an hour ago, we found the gun that killed mary beth in tiegler's apartment with tiegler's prints on it.
Plus, you know, the confession.
didn't Rick Tiegler's blackout strike you as weird?
well, he got drunk. He blacked out. He killed someone. Who hasn't been there?
I'm kidding.
Tiegler came out of a drunken stupor standing upright over a body instead of facedown in a pool of vomit.
it sounds more like a trance than a blackout.
somebody hypnotized Tiegler into killing Mary Beth and hypnotizing Carl?
it's possible.
I didn't eat all this cheese and grease for nothing. This cased is closed.
you're just seeing suggestion everywhere, Jane.
you're too suggestible.
Oh, right, too much of a control freak for that?
pot meet kettle. Kettle, pot.
agent Lisbon, I'm, uh, here for my sister's effects from our apartment.
agent Rigsby'll help you. - Thank you.
miss Hendrix, quick question. Do you believe Rick Tiegler killed your sister?
actually, uh, I kinda don't.
how did you know? - Why don't you come to my office?
I-I'm so sorry. - It's okay. It's fine.
control freak.
I'm so sorry to be bothering you guys. I...
what exactly is your concern, Lindsay?
Yeah, it's just-- it's been nagging at me, but, um, did, um, did Rick say how he got into our apartment?
no. He said he was blacked out. Why?
Mary Beth-- she really disliked him.
I mean, really, really disliked him.
I can't imagine she would just open the door and t him into our place.
well, he couldn't have broken in.
the b. f.s. report says the front door was undamaged.
I don't get it. I mean, we had a dead bolt ana pehole.
Mary Beth was all security-conscious ever since she and Royston got mugged.
she and dr. Daniel?
Yeah, when he took her to Maui for the weekend.
some kids--they mugged them. It was--it was awful.
she and dr. Daniel were dating?
for six months now. I thought he told you.
and voil .
would you excuse us for a minute? - Yeah.
Daniel told us Mary Beth was just his assistant.
he didn't know anything about her private life.
so Daniel lied to us. Why?
well, embarrassment, fear, privacy...
guilt maybe.
it's probably nothing, but it is a loose end.
that Tiegler's defense attorney could hang us with.
we better go pick up Daniel.
if we walk, you could burn some case-closed pizza calories.
cute.
go inside and find out everything about her sister's relationship with Daniel.
okay.
Hey, Lindsay. I want you to tell me exactly when Mary Beth started dating dr. Daniel.
no, um, Royston would never hurt Mary Beth, not in a million years, if that's what you're thinking.
I really am quite busy, you know.
we'll have you back here very soon, doctor.
if you could just tell me what this is about...
just a few questions. That's all.
Yes, a few questions about what?
I'm not sure, sir. I won't be the one asking.
Oh, come on, agent. Just a hint.
you know, you're far too pretty to be so solemn.
Ah, the curse of the pretty girl.
you've been told you're gorgeous since you were 12 years old,
and now you can't bear to hear what most women long for.
I have a job to do. That's all.
are you really that tough? I didn't think so.
you don't know anything about me. - No?
no.
you're ambitious, more than you'll let anyone see.
a girl from nowheresville desperate to make it big,
but you worry that you'll always be small town, small-time, you haven't got what it takes,
and that's why you're so shut down to everything but this job.
Dr. Daniel? No offense, but I've been working with Patrick Jane for nine months now.
you want to get under my skin? You're gonna have to up you're game. Shall we?
I'll tell u again, agent Cho. I wasn't sleeping with my assistant.
the assistant's sister says different, doctor.
then she's lying or misled somehow.
in November, the two of you didn't go to Paris for a week?
on business, yes. I travel extensively, teaching.
the same story for 23 minutes now.
maybe he's telling the truth.
maybe it's Lindsay Hendrix who's lying.
no, this one's lying.
notice how he can't break eye contact?
I'll get the truth out of him.
look, agent Cho, I came here out of courtesy.
now if there's nothing new, I'd like to go.
Hey, Cho. May I? - Sure.
Dr. Daniel, tell the truth. You'll feel better. Trust me.
I'd like to go now.
Rigsby, hey!
all right, all right, we were together. We'd been dating since September, okay?
it feels better, doesn't it? - Agent rigsby, outside. Come on.
you broke my nose, you crazy bastard.
dude, I'm fine. This is ridiculous. - Gun and badge.
boss, come on. I-- - now!
damn it, Wayne. Do you understand what you just did?
Oh, dear. - I know.
no. No, this. - No. No way.
Yeah, afraid so. He's been hypnotized.
Oh, dear.
Oh, I've been hypnotized, have I?
you're gonna make me do embarrassing things, pretend like I'm Tina Turner or something?
you wanna be like Tina Turner?
N--ane, trust me. I'm not hypnotized. I feel fine, totally normal.
normally you don't break the noses of suspects.
What--what are you talking about? I just questioned the guy.
do you think this could be psychological?
some sort of psychotic break?
no, hypnosis. That's all.
I thought you couldn't hypnotize somebody against this moral character.
Rigsby has a brutal streak. If you didn't know, now you know.
it's not an uncommon trait in those that choose to go into police work.
I'm calling a shrink anyway. - No, wait.
deeply hypnotized subjects are very suggestible and have very little inhibion.
Rigsby, do me a favor.
close your eyes.
please. Now relax.
don't tell me, but think about it-- think about what you most want to be doing right now.
you can do anything you like in the whole world.
what are you gonna do?
I want you to open your eyes and do it. Do whatever you like.
Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
okay, he's hypnotized.
well, unhypnotize him. - You sure?
do it. - I can't.
the hypnotist uses a specific trigger to induce a trance.
unless I know that trigger, I can't get him out.
I have to go. - Where do you have to go to?
I can't tell you. I'll see you later.
Rigsby, no.
no, no. This is good. This is very good.
he's not a guinea pig. Rigsby, stay here. That's an order.
I'm sorry, boss. I have to go.
Hey, Rigsby, you can't leave. You can't. You're not well.
Cho, stop messing around. I'm fine.
talk to him, Grace. He'll listen to you.
please stay. Please?
okay. But not for long.
come on. Come sit with me. - Okay.
Rigsby didn't talk to Tiegler, did he? - Nope.
so Tiegler didn't do this.
maybe he didn't kill Mary Beth either. It looks like you're right.
Rick Tiegler was put in a trance by the real killer and thought he just blacked out.
and the same person put Rigsby under.
we need to question everybody Rigsby interviewed at the N. L. P. cent and anyone else he talked to.
it h to be dr. Daniel, right? He's the only one with the chops to do this.
and plus he lied about sleeping with the victim.
no, no, no. Why would he want Rigsby to smack his own face into a table?
though why would anyone else want Rigsby to smack Daniel's face into the table?
my guess? The smacking of the face into the table
unintended side effect of a deeper hypnotic command.
command to do what?
there's the rub. Let's find out.
I do not need this right now.
Jane's off doing his thing?
Yes, and I should be with him. What the hell happened?
Tiegler got off on bail just like that?
no record and he's not a flight risk. Plus, it's judge Milton.
he set the bail at $50, 000.
$50, 000 for an accessory to murder charge?
well, that's the thing. A. d.a. dropped it to obstruction.
a deal? I was not consulted.
me neither. Tiegler found some juice somewhere.
got a defense attorney from horton & fleer, whole nine.
find out about Tiegler's bail. - All right.
Hello, agents.
nice day, huh, to be walking free in the world?
you need supervision.
we think you might have been hypnotized by Mary Beth's killer.
Really? That's your play?
you could be in danger, sir.
you're the danger, lady. You threw me down a marble staircase.
look at this bruise. - No, thanks.
Mr. Tiegler, what if I'm right?
what if you were hypnotized to take the blame for mary beth's murder, and the killer is still out there? That would make you a loose end, right?
you cops will try anything, won't you, to make me doubt myself?
you and my mother. Well, it's not gonna work. I'm living the model life.
you have a very good day, agent Lisbon, and try not to bruise anyone.
Tiegler's bond? Tiegler didn't post it.
who did?
the model life centre, incorporated.
Really? - Yep.
look into it. - Okay.
I gotta get back.
why are we here?
I wanted to bring him somewhere where he felt safe, relaxed,
something that brought him back to his childhood, before he started getting hurt.
hurt by who? - Yeah, hurt by who?
well, whoever. Uh, none of my business.
here we are. Please, have a seat.
nobody hurt me, okay?
Jane, don't upset him.
I know what I'm doing.
are you still on this hypnosis kick?
I'm telling you, you're wrong.
Rigsby, I'm gonna have to ask you to trust me, okay?
try and trust me. I'm gonna help you break this trance.
no one's gonna hurt you, okay?
bring you back to your normal self.
you'd like that, wouldn't you?
you've got it wrong. -Maybe so.
I mean, everybody makes mistakes, don't they?
that's life, huh? Ups and downs.
look at those swings... Up... And down.
up... And down.
that's life. Relax into it.
nothing to worry about.
up... And down.
up... And down.
up... And down.
how are you feeling? Good?
tingling in your hands? Buzzing?
tingling, I guess, a little.
that's good.
now you're watching those swings.
up... And down.
up... And down.
let yourself drift away.
feel the tension release...
watching the swings.
you're doing it all on your own.
that's very good. All on your own.
now I have to find the hypnotic trigger.
it could be visual, auditory or physical.
watching the swings.
dude, don't feel me up, man.
deep breathing. Breathe in. Feel the breath.
feel the breath out.
in... And out. That's good.
Jane, stop. - What?
just... Just stop. Okay? I got a splitting headache. Just...
you're just breathing, rigsby. Just breathing.
no one is hurting you. - No, you--you are.
y-y-you're hurting me. Stop it! Stop doing your stuff on me!
your reaction is part of the suggestion.
it's a built-in defense mechanism to stop me trying to help you.
Rigsby, let Jane help you. - Stop.
I-I've gotta get to... I-I've gotta go! I've gotta get out of here.
Wayne! Wayne, stop!
he's in too deep. If you try to stop him, he'll probably hurt you.
Hello, dr. Daniel.
agent rigsby? Thank god you're here. Help me.
shut up, Royston.
Wayne, thank you for coming. Thank you for helping me.
well, I had to come. - I know.
Hey, Lindsay. I want you to tell me exactly when Mary Beth started dating dr. Daniel.
no, uh, uh, Royston would never hurt Mary Beth, if that's what you're thinking.
not in a million years.
this is just routine. Relax. We'll be done in no time.
I will. I'll relax.
I feel very relaxed with you, Wayne. Very safe.
very safe and relaxed sitting next to you.
I feel like I could tell you anything... Anything at all.
let me tell you about dr. Daniel.
I know. And don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine now.
agent Rigsby.
agent, I want you to relax and listen very carefully to the sound of my voice.
you've got to listen to me, for god sake! You've gotta
I was so in love with you, you arrogant bastard.
and all you wanted was Mary Beth. That stupid cow!
and I thought that if I could finally get rid ofer, that you would see me and love me for who I am!
but you were in San Francisco when Mary Beth was murdered.
Yeah, but they have these things called rental cars.
then I drove up there and I did the deed, and then I hypnotized that skeezebag Rick to take the blame for it.
got back just in time to catch my flight.
and then when I got off the plane, I thought that Royston and I would finally be together,
that he would see me for the gifts that I have.
but he didn't see you. - No, he didn't.
it's hard when they don't see you. - What a moron I was.
what a moron.
I came to you, and you said to me, "oh, it's not important. We'll do fine without you. Go home.
do you remember that? Look at me!
and I knew in that moment that you would never love me. Never.
so now you're gonna die.
Rigsby... He hurt me. He hurt me, rigsby.
you love to protect women, don't you?
I saw how you looked at that red-haired agent.
grace. Her name's Grace.
Wayne, I need your protection right now.
I need your help with a special job.
you'll help me, won't you? - Sure. What do you need me to do?
I need you to take-- - hello, rigsby.
Hey, is that... - Venus or mercury?
hansel and Gretel had bread crumbs. I had Rigsby.
I knew he'd lead me to the guilty one, so I put a tracking device in his pocket.
bingo.
smart... Except for the part where I have the gun.
Oh, I have a gun, too. Lisbon?
drop the weapon!
so predictable. Rick!
you should put the gun down now.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
drop the weapon, agent Lisbon.
Tiegler, this is your first day out on bail.
don't do this. - Shut up!
I said drop it!
best do as she says.
Oh, I'm impressed, Lindsay.
there's not three people in the world that could've done an induction on a cop.
but Rigsby's guard was up when he was with dr. Daniel and Carl.
and you?
you just crept through the cracks, you sneaky little mouse.
well, I was never the sparkling, vivacious one.
that was Mary Beth.
and all the boys loved her, never me...
until I went to work for dr. Daniel.
then I realized I have a talent for reaching pele's unconscious.
people let their defenses down with me.
they trust me.
finally, I was worth something.
finally, I'm in control.
look around yourself. Are you in control now?
all these people here have to die. That's not control. That's madness.
you're having a nervous breakdown, Lindsay.
you need help. We can help you.
it's beautiful nigh for a swim. Don't you think?
Yeah.
the ocean is so nice tonight.
hear the crash of the waves, Rigsby?
it's peaceful.
Yeah, it's nice. - It's not nice, Rigsby. It's not the ocean.
Hey, now why don't you take Royston for a little swim?
show himthat dark, beautiful ocean.
no.
that's right. Take him for a swim. I love night swims. Don't you?
stop. Rigsby, dot.
Rigsby, listen to me. Listen to my voice.
why don't you take jane for a swim?
I think he wants to go. - No, no, no, no. I-I-I-I-I don't want to.
I don't wanna go! - Rigsby!
come on, let's go swimming, Jane.
no, no! It's--it's not water down there! It's concrete!
the water's gorgeous. Mr. Jane loves to swim, just like you do, Rigsby.
stop, Rigsby. Stop!
Yeah, take him for a swim. Take him over. He wants to go. Push him over, rigsby.
no, Rigsby! Shark! Shark! There! See it? It's a great white.
sharks? Where?
the's no sharks, Rigsby. The water's fine. - She's lying.
just take him in! Throw him in! - She wants you to get eaten.
who is this woman? - Throw him over.
don't-- - Shoulder? Ah, it's the shoulder!
throw him in, Rigsby! - Shoulder! Wait! Wait!
gun! - damn it!
Yes. Gun. Thanks, Rigsby.
you, my friend, have been in a trance state.
get outta here. - Oh, I'd love to.
let's go.
Jane, would you untie him? Come on.
I don't know. I just suddenly came out of it and then, uh, boom.
just had to take her down, you know?
Yeah, you took down a 100-pound woman, but in that context, you did good.
what do you mean, "in that context"?
Oh, in the context of someone letting himself get hypnotized,
nearly throwing his colleague off a building and then finally being able
to overpower a small crazy woman to retrieve the situation
you did okay.
Oh, be fair--a small crazy woman with a gun. A gun is a gun.
and anyone can be hypnotized she was very good. Very good.
not as good as me, but close. Close-ish.
which is why the professional standards unit has cleared you for assaulting dr. Daniel.
you weren't yourself.
but he is now, right? Himself? Completely unprogrammed?
Yes, he is.
last two days are gone, but other than that, I'm good to go.
Oh, so you don't remember anything from when you were hypnotized?
fragments, but, no, not really. Thank goodness, right?
Yeah.
Oh, lord. Did I make a fool of myself?
cluck like a chicken? I didn't do Tina Turner, did I?
no. You were perfectly normal.
good. That's a relief, eh?
coward. - What?
you honestly don't remember it?
don't remember what?
he remembers. - He so remembers.
what?
it'll come to you.
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
the victim is felix hanson. 47.
took three bullets to the chest. No weapon found.
the coroner estimates the shooting occurred some time between midnight and 3: 00 a. m.
why is this one ours, boss?
looks like a mugging to me. Hollywood homicide can handle that.
it came from the big brass.
Hanson was super rich, and he was a California state representative for six years.
golfing buddy of the attorney general?
correct, but not quite fair. Hanson was a good guy.
he headed a campaign against the drug trade.
he kicked butt, named names and made a lot of enemies.
wait a second. I know this guy. He's semifamous.
he, uh, he was married to felicia scott.
she left the movies for him.
Oh, come on. You know, she's been in loads of movies.
sudden embrace. Love that movie.
okay, my point is, if this is drug-related,
the a. g.is gonna want to use all of his resources to close this case.
anybody hear shots, see what happened?
nobody's come forward so far, but, uh, Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin over there,
they were with hanson when the first officer arrived on the scene.
any kids?
daughter. 16.
how you doing? - Good.
you didn't happen to pick up a set of car keys off this guy, did you?
uh, no.
valet ticket?
no, nothing in the pockets.
nobody walks in l. a. - No. No, they don't.
and where were you going when you found the victim?
I don't speak, uh...
in the movies, no. But her in the real world, you speak. You just did.
I'm saying nothing more.
five hours we've been here.
for the umpteenth time, I was going home from work. Victor was walking me to my car.
and what is your work?
I'm Marilyn.
how is that your work?
I stand on the street. People take photos of me and give me tips.
Why? - I don't know. Where are you from?
what are you staring at?
you. What's your real name?
Norma Je Baker.
what's your real real name?
Yolanda, you don't actually look very much like Marilyn at all.
you do this kind of work 'cause you feel a deep connection with her, yeah?
I guess. - Yeah.
she was a lonesome soul, poor woman.
longed for affection, attention, acceptance.
she got it. She came out here, and she worked hard, and she struggled, and she got it
all the love and respect that she longed for. And you can, too. You will.
you will, Yolanda, if you do the right thing now.
what thing?
hand over the valet ticket, Yolanda, that you stole from the dead man.
I haven't got any valet ticket. - Then tell Charlie to hand it over.
give him the ticket. - Son of a bitch.
give it!
thank you.
can we go? - Sure.
I'll keep the cops at bay. You guys run.
run! Run! Go, go, go, go, go! Run!
nice. I could arrest you for that.
you'll never take me alive, copper.
seriously. - Seriously, it's Marilyn and Charlie.
what, do you want to make a comedy arrest, see your name written in the weird news section?
where did he valet?
at Musso & Frank's, down the block.
after you're done here, go back to the restaurant.
go through the credit card receipts.
find out who he was having dinner with last night. - Will do.
uh, boss?
so I guess it is drug trade-related-- but not in a good guy way.
then I want toick up a little piece of that, do at, up, okay?
and at the same time, they gonna come to the window
and we gonna catch them when they come to the window.
Gabriel Fanning? - Yeah, that me.
CBI. We not to talk to you about Felix Hanson.
Why? What did he do?
he died last night. - What?
is the somewhere we can talk?
Yeah, back over here.
last night at dinner with Felix, both of your credit cards we charged at 11: 30.
you stay the restaurant much longer?
no, we leave soon after tt.
we were talking a good time, but, um, I wanted to get up early this morning.
tomorrow is the first of production.
what is the new duction "a dozen roses." I'm the direct and Felix finaed the picture. That's why we were having dinner.
we were celebrating his first foray as film producer.
how did he get into film producing?
he's, uh, married to Elicia Scott.
she's starring in the vie.
Felicia Scott. Remind me?
come on. Felicia Scott?
"love times two." "Aby, you're mine."
"sudden embrac" - "sudden embrace." Good.
sounds famiar. The were all a while back, though, aren't they?
she is better now than she did before - or just good, anyhow.
so what's this movie about?
a mother's quest to find good men for her three daughters.
it's funny. It's moving. Is sexy-- - can I read it?
you can't read it.
it's about family and retion and-- - gotcha.
did you get along with Felix? You ever have any arguments?
I loved him. Loved him.
any people in this to are phonies.
but Felix Hanson--he real.
Felix--he didn't like something, he'd say so.
what in particular did he not like?
nothing. I'm just saying in general.
he was like that--real.
how much did he have invested in the film?
ten. - Million? Of his own money?
Yep. Sure a brave must doing it all for Felicia, of course, not just for the potential profits.
did you two leave the restaurant together?
we walked out together, ah.
was anybody waiting for him?
we shookhands and said good-bye.
do you own a gun, Gabriel?
no. I like guns, but I'm afraid of blowing my own head off.
Yeah.
what do you think?
he's lying. They had an argument last night.
you go out to celebrate with the man that financed your movie,
and you only pay half the dinner bill?
van Pelt? We need Gabriel Fannin's cell phone records for last night.
sure. while the last number dialed Hanson's cell was locked, I had the phone company trace it.
belonging to Rederick Ross. - Who?
Oh, just a convicted felon with multie possession and assault charges.
beautiful. Find out where he is, and have some boys pick him up.
okay. Wait a minute. I know this guy.
He--he's on that beer commercial.
Oh, the one with tma?
what ?
this Ross guy-- he must be actor, too.
you know that beer commercia with the guy wearing the toga?
Oh, yeah, yeah, and we're all supposed to be surprised when the toga man caught in the elevator.
Yeah, at him. Weird, huh?
you have the address?
Yeah, okay, wait.
go pick him up. - Mmyes, ma'am.
we're sorry for your loss.
how long would you together?
we've been married most eight years.
where are you last night?
palm springs. Felix insisted I have a spa weekend before film started.
and you? - Home.
was there anybody in your and he's life posed a threat to him?
somebody he didn't feel safe around?
no.
we found-- - what was it that first attracted you to your husband?
not his looks.
and what is my type?
sporty bad boys with a hidden asocstic streak...
not too bright.
not en close.
no, that was a bull'eye.
so what did you like about Felix?
his voice his self-assurance.
I don't understand how these questions are relevent.
Oh, no reason. Just, uh, curious, we found a large bag of mariju and a various other prescripti drugs in the trunk of husband's car.
well, that's absurd. - Why?
because Felix didn't do drugs, period.
he must been planted.
I'm straighted, have been years.
know anybody named Freddie Ross?
no. Whis that?
it's mine.
there your Galitabriel's assistant. He wants us to report to set for rehearls.
tell him we will be there on time.
I'm sure they would understand if you don't go into work today.
Oh, believe me, I would like to back out of the whole project.
when Felix leave, this no point.
but the insurance company is holding my contract.
they won't agree any delays, and I don't want end up in court.
you in the movie, too?
kind of.
we gave her a small speaking role, as one of my daughters.
is that cute? - Yeah.
do you wanna be an actress?
whatever. Not more.
hoy, I know it's hard but one day you might be glad that
you were a part of something that so important to your father.
he didn't think this film was important?
no, he thought Gabriel screwe up the script.
he wanted to back out of the film.
don't be a drama queen.
he was unhappy with the script, but that's why he met with Galibriel, to talk it through.
he wasn't gonna back out.
he may have threatened to back out to get what he need, that's how it works.
so who's the buddy?
Brandon. - Brandon who?
you , uh, dating?
dating? No. Maybe. Sort of. That's so nerdy, dating.
your stepmother didn't like him?
no. Thank you for not saying anything.
forget it. - We'll be seeing you Sydney.
Brandon Fult - I'm check out.

Yeah, search Ross' place. Rr the l. a.p. d.should be
Yeah, they've been helpful so far.

Hey, kid.
Hello? - It's a clod set. What does that mean?
Hello?
I'll call you back. - Okay.
warrant's on its way.

closed set.
I know what it means, but they're from the CBI.
I don't care if they're from a faraway galaxy.
this is a closed set, okay?
no gawkers, no fans.
we're not fans. - Well, I'm sort of a fan.
california bureau of investigation.
we need to speak with Gabriel Ganning.
Oh, he can't talk to you right now.
it's regarding a murder investigation.
I'm Mitch Cavanaugh, Gabriel's agent.
Hey, Mitch.
how you doing? - Good.
I heard about what happened to Hanson. Tragic.
I mean, such a cool guy.Truly.
we're trying to make a movie here, though.
Yeah, well, we're trying to solve a homicide.
he can't talk to you right now.
you keep this up, I'll have you arrested for obstruction.
that's unfortunate, but go ahead.
I derstand, Mitch. Gabriel's one of your top clients. You can't lose him.
right.
no choice, whever he says. He says "jump," you jump.
bullied at school, were you?
I was not, actually.
sure you were. Even after all these years, you awake sometimes,
king of all the ways that you could wreak rage on your tormentors.
and now out of fear and avarice, you let this man Fanning bully you the same way.
Mitch, it's the same way. It's same thing.
you goona get a life.
or get arrested.
go ahead.
that was strong.
great. Mitch, you little scum sucker.
class "a." You have a prescription for these?
what is this? Come on.Jesus.
sit down. We have a few follow-up questions for you.
didn't we do this earlier? I already answered your questions.
well, that was before we knew that you were a liar and a drug abuser.
I don't abuse drugs. I use them.
they're for creativity.
Ah, but you don't deny a liar.
I didn't lie. I spun the truth a little bit, maybe.
why don't you try giving it to us straight?
Felicia blabbed, didn't she? Stupid bitch.
fine.
Yes, Hanson told me last night that he was pulling his money out of the movie
the day before principal photography, the son of bitch.
without his money, production would have shut down?
Yes.
this is your first feature in what, seven years?
word on the street is you're a little-- little difficult to work with.
Oh, really? Is that what the word on the street is?
well, you know what? Screw the word on the street.
I took some time out to recharge.
I've been, uh, exploring other aspects of my life.
narcotics and despair?
it's been tough, okay?
I've come very close to having to take a tv gig.
so yes, I'm extremely anxious for this film to work.
I need it to work.
Hanson's death was awfully convenient then.
Yeah, it was. It was.
and when you told me he was dead, my heart leapt for joy.
and then I felt terrible.
and then you felt good again.
listen, I'm an artist, kay?
I'm arrogant and I'm dishonest and I'm childish. But you know what, I'm not stupid.
I donot think I'm above the law. - Gabe.
Fecia's on set, ready to go.
Thanks, Mitch, an incompetent weasel. - Wait a minute.
those aren't my drugs. Those are Mitch's drugs.
right, right. That's not Gabe's drugs. And it's my drugs.
sorry, Gabe. I shouldn't have left them around the trailer.
how dumb is that?
need I go, ma'am?
go winn Oscar, Gabe. - Yeah, yeah.
Mitchell Cavanaugh, you are under arrest.
Oh, Mitch. And I thought we worked through your doormat issues.
tell Cho to squeeze him a litt. He knows things.
no, I don't.
sure, do, Mitch.
you're not gonna like getting squeezed by Cho, action!
Daisy, where are you?
I'm home. I'm not feeling so good.
Oh, but puddin', you have to come - why? Why is it so important?
line. Rowan's on his way.
rowan is on his way.
I called him and pretended to be you!
Oh, mom. No, you didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.
I'm sorry, pudd'.
Rowan's not even interested in me, and I don't want him anymore anyway.
I'm sorry. Sydney, honey. Honey. - Cut!
you--you can't just read the lines, hon.
you have to be Daisy. You have to be her.
I-I need your passion here, Sydney. I'm working alone.
okay.
okay. Let's, uh, pick it up from where we left off-- Rowan doesn't need me.
two pickup.
rollin speed.

Rowan's not interested on me, and I don't want him anymore anyway.
Oh, honey, don't give up on your dream so easily
I know love can be tough, but 's all we have in
Hello? Hello? Hello
Hi, Rowan. - Good morning, Mrs. Atkins.
Daisy's not here. She's, uh, she's at home.
Oh, that's all right. It's--it's actually you that I wanted to speak with.
what you said just now, about love...
cut! Great. Lovely.
okay. Okay, everody. We're gonna go one more time.
Geoff, baby, don't flinch before she throws the slap.
you don't know that's coming but she's king a right wallop. I mean, it hurt.
Oh, I'm sorry for feeling a little motional today.
Gab-Gabriel, this scene is still running really flat.
t I-I have an idea. I think I know
we're in the master, babe.
we're really, really wide, and you're about hat big in the frame.
we're gonna fix it in coverage, okay?
no, i-i-i realize that, but I think that it's an important establishing
no, no, Gaiel, please. This is an estabshing moment for the character.
die screaming, you crazy woman.
I'm sorry. I missed that. What?
you know what? People let's rest ten minute, folk okay? - Okay.
come on, princess. Let's talk. - Yeah, please.
you ow... I-i know it's an inch wide, you know?
no, it's--I understand.
I realize that they're gonna cover...
good. You' a good actor.
thank you.
it must have been tough when your dad took up with Felicia, replacing your real mother.
my real mom is in an alcoholic stupor somewhere in New Jersey.
I was happy to see her go.
why is it that actors-- - bye.
well, I... Bye.
so what do you know, Mitch?
nothing?
Jane says you know stuff.
and he's always right, is he? - Pretty much.
so this is one for the books. It's a first.
I got nothing for you. - Mitchell, unlawful possession of prescription drugs puts you in line for actual prison time.
I doubt that, but, uh, if you're right, so be it.
Really? So be it?
I'm told the pills actually belong to your client, Gabe Fanning.
no comment.
you'll go to prison to protect Fanning?
Hey, how good of an agent is Mitch Cavanaugh?
well, he went to prison to protect a client.
Sounds--sounds pretty good to me.
to protect a client, he became the personal servant of a large and violent criminal-- How's that sound?
look, I'm willing to speak to you on any subject you care to mention,
but on my life, I don't know who killed Felix Hanson.
give me some guidance here. What--what--what do you want to know about?
Ross? Freddie Ross, the drug dealer?
what about him? - Do you know where we can find him?
maybe.
give us Ross, and you're free to go, charges expunged.
deal.
there he is.
I got the hoodie.
gotcha!
Dndn Hanann. Let's go.
well, it goes to see you again, in our custody.
how do you know Felix Hanson?
I never met the man in my life.
he called your cell phone minutes before he was shot.
I was in bed. - Can anyone attest to that?
Bruce. - Where can we find Bruce probably on my kitchen floor, chewing on a pig's ears that I left for him.
what did Hanson say when he called you?
he told me to stay away from his little girl.
you sleeping with her? - Come on. What is she, like 10?
16. - whatever.
I'm not a pervert. I know her boyfriend. He's the one who'd buy from me.
little bad boy.
Hanson had 'em bot followed.
shazam! Let him right to me.
I really do have to get a new system going, you know?
retail drugs is fosuckers.
so where's Brandon now?
I don't know. I mean, we never hung out except for business.
so Hanson found out that Brandon got Sydney hooked on drug and traced the drugs back on you.
see, you know, you should write that down, you know, get a pitch together.
you got a murder, intrigue, young love.
Yeah, all we need is an ending.
Hanson wanted to do you some dam if you killed him off protecting yourself,
that's seldefee, justifiable homicide.
and asks for the tip, can I call my lawyer now? Please?
how long have you been using drugs, Sydney?
you sound likes my father.
Yeah, well, you father wasn't gonna throw you in juvie, was he?
that was your weed and your pls we found in the car, wasn't it?
you're the man. You fire it out.
Yeah, well, it's not the first time it happened, and I can always get more.
from Freddie Ross? - From whoever.
where did you meet Freddie, don't know. Around.
freddie says Brandon Fulton hooked you up.
Brando is not like people say he is.
Brandon Fulton, actor, 19 years old, nine arrests
D. i. drug possession, disorderly conduct. Shall I go on?
why you women love bad boys so much?
I don't get it. Why do they love 'em?
what do you think, Sydney?
can I go now? - In a minute.
your parents forbid you from see Brandon.
that's why you didn't let your mom to see the picture.
Yes. - Why didn't she like him?
you know they said he was a bad guy.
he make you do something?
we needed some money, so I took some stuff from the house.
like what?
like some stuff, money, some old gun, pills.
gun? What kind of gun?
I don't know. Gun.
Brandon sold it for cash.
you parents stopd you seeing your prince. That you mad?
of course. - So you just kept on sending him?
no. No, I have not seen him.
phone records say he's been calling your house regularly.
well, that's not. That's--I don't-- I-I-I don't know. Whatever.
where is he now?
I don't know where he is.
you know, Brandon's not a bad kid.
she said she stole a gun, along with some other things from the else.
Yeah, it was some old army thing that Felix liked to keep around.
what caliber?
.45 I believe. Please, sit down.
you didn't report the theft?
no, it was a foolish girl's mis your husband was murdered with a . 45
no, that-- that's a coincidence.
sydney loved her father.
no. No. - What about Brandon?
he's a mixed-up kid. There's no malice in him.
you knew the drugs in Felix's car were Sydney's all along.
Yes.
you're good. She--wow.
Felix found the drug a few days ago.
he was heartbroken because she had promised to stop.
so he held on them while we debated what to do.
and now that Felix is not existed, what are you gonna do?
forgive her. Show her love.
we all make mistakes, but we have the we have to give ourselves a second chance.
do you know if Sydney and Brandon were still seeing each other?
did you ask her
I did. She said she hadn't seen him since you banned him.
then I believe her.
he has been calling this house regularly.
Oh, god sydney...
Brandon dropped out of sight after the death of your husband.
no. I... I refuseo beeve it. I... I refuse.
I need to see Sydney. When can she go home? She's on her way. There's no charges regain on her.
Oh, god. Thank you so much for your kindness and your undetanding. Thank you.
that's ok. Others a lot of leeway juvenile cases.
I'll always be very grateful.
she was some woman to make the mighty agent Lis blush like a schoolgirl.
Oh, please. I did not.
you know what I predict? - Nope.
guess. - Oh, just tell me.
no, I think you should guess. It's good for you
I predict that Brandon Fulton will pay a visit to the Hanson redence this evening.
you think? Wouldn't be too clever of him.
well, love is not blind. It's often pretty stupid.
I'll arrange a stakeout.
Oh, yeah. When I super rich, I'm gonna live here.
can't beat the sound of the waves, ah?
they've got gadgets that'll do that for you
the sound of waves on the beach, jungle sounds, roari fire.
Yeah, well, it's not quite the real live Pacific ocean, though, is it?
it's cheaper, in the event you don't become super rich.
Oh, I'll brich. I'll be-'ll be super rich. - I know.
the eagle has leaed.
crap. He's already in. He must have keys.
Oh, god. Help me. Help me! Help!
drop the gun, ma'am!
Geback.
have I killed him?
Oh, god. Is he dead? Ha I killed him?
this is agent o, c. We need ramedics at 43565 trancas beach road.
we got a juvie male th a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
I justanicked. I-I just saw--I saw the gun and I panicked.
I just panicked, is he gonna be okay?
0. 45
nice. Is he okay?
hope so. - What happened?
Oh, my god. Brandon! Please. - No, no, no, no, no - Come on. No, no. No. He all right. He's all right. - Please.
what? - Hey, boss.
Hey, we got a good news/ bad news situation here.
now there are guantees, but as for now, there won't be any charges pressed against you for shooting Brandon.
Oh, thank goodness for that.
is he gonna be all right?
Yeah, he'll be fine.
well, that's a relief.
I mean, I feel terrieble, but what was he thinking, sneaking around our house with a gun?
what does he say he was doing?
he's still recovering for surgery.
we gonna talk to him as soon as we can. - Okay.
then he was carrying what the gun that killed your husband.
it's the gun Sydney stole from your house.
Oh, my god. - Yes.
sydney may be an accesry to murder.
why were you there last night, Brandon?
what were you planning on doing?
before you nazis shot me?
I was visiting my girlfriend.
we didn't shoot you.
Yeah, tell that to the judge.
I'm suing your ass, big-time.
Yeah, okay, that's a plan.
here's your problem, Brandon
the gun that you were carrying last night was the same gun used to kill Felix Hann,
the gun that Sydney stole for you, which puts you both in a whole lot of trouble.
I have nothing say about that.
did Sydney know?
did she know what?
did she know you were gonna use the gun to kill her father?
I didn't.
did she ask you to do it?
I didn't kill him. - We know you killed him. That stop he sailed.
we're charging you with the murder of Felix Hanson.
we just want to know if Sydney's involved, you people leave no idea who he really was.
he was monster, total saddist.
a sadist? - Whatever, man. He liked to hurt people.
and that would be a good reason to kill a man if he wants hurt someone that you love.
Yeah, any man would do the same.
did he hurt Sydney? Is that what she told you?
did she persuade you that he ought to die? To protect her?
my saying nothing. I want my lawyer.
Hey, boss. He's lawyered up and admitting nothing.
tough to get a conviction with what we have so far.
but have the murder weapon. We don't need a confession.
Yeah, the gun's a double-edged sord, sort of.
belonged to Felix Hanson, was never sported stolen.
and we recovered it in Hanson's house. - From Brandon.
or from the floor. We never saw it in Brandon's possession.
and there's no recoverable prints.
a courtroom, we can't put Hanson and the gun and Brandon together in the same place.
so without an actual confession from Brandon, we stuck.
or a confession from Sydney.
there's no way that Brandon did this without her say so. Right?
that, my dear, is an excellent question.
is Randon gonna be okay? - He alive.
I want to see him I need to talk with him.
and, uh, what would you say to him?
that's not your business.
I think I know what happened here, Sydney, I'm wondering if you do, too.
uh, yeah.
my boyfriend shot my dad, and then my stepmom shot my boyfriend.
my life is like a sick joke.
so tell me, Sydney, why would Brandon kill your dad unless you wanted him to?
less you asked him to?
I didn't ask him to do anything.
can you look at me and say that?
I didn't ask him to do anything.
I loved my father. I did.
maybe someone else made him do it. - Who?
you tell me.
what are you thinking?
I'm thinking Felicia and Sydney should go back to work.
Oh, really? Why so?
a great man once said, "all the world's a stage, and all the men and won merely players.
Oh, really? - Really.
ladies, good morning.
how are you? - Mm, fine.
okay. Listen, I was thinking before we roll,
why don't we just run through thole thing from the top for fun, okay?
don't worry about being on type too much.
just your instincts, and let's see what happens, okay?
okay. - All right.
shoot it.
okay! Let's see how this goes.
and... Action.
Daisy, where are you?
I'm right here, mom.
look at you, you look... Good.
Thanks.
what were you calling me about?
I just wanted to make sure you were on your way.
why is it important I be here?
I did a naughty thing. I called Rowan.
he's on his way. I pretended to be you. - Oh, no. You didn't.
Oh, yes, I did. I'm sorry, bunny.
why would you do that?
why play games? You've already seduced him away from me.
I did not. Why would you say that?
acting! It's over.
I know what you did. I know who you are.
you've always hate me.
you seduced brandon, and you lied to him, and you made him kill my father!
all right. Gabe-- you're not going anywhere- Gabe, cut it. She's gone mad. - No!
till let you go as if you tell them it's not true.
tell them I'm wrong. Tell them!
I... It's not true. It's...
no, it's not. It's--it's not.
it's not true. - God, you're such a liar.
this is ridiculous.
I don't know what he said to you, but it's nonsenses, this is upsetting to me and fair.
sydney, terrific. Just terrific.
you, uh, I'm not buying it.
you're woon, high-pitche believe it, Felicia.
believe it, and then we will. Ok?
let's try one more from, uh, "It is ridiculous."
this is... I'm ... I'm sorry. I don't understand.
it's easy to understand.
you told Brandon that Felix was abusing you.
you persuaded Brandon to kill Felix.
when you feared he'd confess to the police, you lured him to the house, planning to kill him as well.
but now Sydney sees the truth.
she knows that you're a conniving, murderous bitch.
way too melodramatic.
Yourvhole world is falling apart.
you're done unless you can convince us that you are telling me truth now.
my w-- my work is always truthful.
there's a little afternoon soap in there.
that's a terrible thing to say tell us the truth, Felicia.
keep it real. You can do it.
Oh, god, I'm sorry.
what was that? Speak up.
I'm s-sorry. - For what?
I-I was angry he changed his mind over "script issues," he said.
he didnot want me out there, being successful, having other men look at me and want me.
it made him feel insecure.
I gave up my life to be with him.
this is my life, and he wouldn't let me have it back.
he was suffocating me.
it was a form of abuse.
is Sydney here?
no, she's out.
Brandon came along a weak moment.
why don't you come sit down with me?
he forced himself on me
I let him.
he told Felix that Sydney was in trouble, Felix went right along.
it's Sydney. She's back here, and she needs you.
you sick bastard.
he did love that daughter of his. I'll give him that.
if only he could have accepted me for who I am, respected my needs...
this would never have happened.
men are beasts.
Patrick, would you do me a favor?
Oh, I might.
tell Sydney that I'm sorry.
I see now, on reflection...
I was not the stepmother I might've been.
I'm sorry for that.
I did try.
and I hope and pray that she doesn't become bitter, hope that she has happiness.
cause happiness is... So hard to find.
once you find it, you beer hang on tight...
or you will lose it.
that's true.
that's true.
mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun
someone who uses mental Acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.
a master manipulator of Thoughts and behavior.
excuse me.
what kind of tree is this?
couldn't say.
smells good.
so you're not a local?
born 5 miles down the road.
just don't give a crap about trees.
name's Justin Prentiss.
student at a private school operation A couple miles from here.
they realized he was missing around 6: 00 this morning,
activated the electronic monitoring device On his ankle, found him and called us at 8: 00.
do they have an estimated time of death yet?
coroner puts time of death Somewhere between 10:00 and 1:00 last night.
I wanted to take him down the mountain Soon as forensics were done, but as per your request, We didn't touch him.
Oh, we won't be here long. You can have him as soon as we're done.
what's with the ankle bracelet?
good question. Mr. Maclean?
this is the principal of the school... Asher Maclean.
these people are from the CBI.
they want to know why your student has an electronic monitoring device on him.
Justin had some truancy issues recently, hence the device.
what kind of school is this, exactly?
bright Arch is a wilderness program for troubled youth.
like a summer camp? - No, we're an accredited high school.
students stay at Bright Arch for a year, on average.
we provide structure and discipline Through close interaction with nature
plus a regular high school curriculum, of course.
uh, she doesn't like you, and you don't like her. Why is that?
no comment.
chief Brody?
why don't you like him? - What has that got to do with anything?
I'm just curious.
think you might show a little more respect.
respect for... - There is a dead child here.
Yes. Yes, he's dead.
he doesn't care how I talk to you.
I've never worked with the CBI before. Do all your units come with a clown?
we get the job done.
well, how about getting it done now?
so we can take this kid out of here. How would that be?
Yeah. We'll do that.
Yep, you can take him. We've got the basic facts.
Oh, is that right? That quick, huh? - Uh, yeah.
you want to enlighten us?
Oh, forensics probably told you a lot of it already, I would guess.
uh, his knuckles and his knees suggest that he was overpowered in a hand-to-hand struggle.
the blow to the head was the coup de grace.
but the ground around him is relatively undisturbed,
which means that the struggle would have taken place elsewhere...
uphill, presumably.
injured animals tend to move downhill, of course.
do you have any actual facts?
well, it's an actual fact that you dislike Mr. Maclean here because he's a tree-hugging, liberal wacko.
he's probably running some kind of a cult, and he dislikes you because you're a small-minded, provincial hayseed...
not that you are, necessarily. That's just what he thinks.
facts pertaining to this poor boy.
there was no moon last night, so it was very dark.
Justin wouldn't have been able to move very far, injured as he was.
he had a lot of dirt in his hair, a lot of dirt in his ears and deep up under his nails.
so somewhere close by, somewhere very close by, there's a spot where someone, uh...
where someone buried him alive.
Oh, my god.
all right, all right, all right!
settle down, folks. Take your seats.
let's go.
I know the last couple of days have been rough.
losing Justin hurts.
but his death cannot become your crutch for a negative attitude.
you can learn and grow from this experience.
sir, do we still get to do the sacred fire ceremony On Friday?
I think there's all the more reason do it now.
we need healing. All right, listen, kids,
the strangers you see here are detectives that will be investigating the situation with Justin.
they are here to find out what happened to him, and I want all of you to answer any questions they have as best you can.
Yes, yes, yes, people?
Yes, yes, yes!
is it true that he was buried alive?
Orrin. - Oh, yeah, that is true.
who did it? - That's enough, Elliot.
let's all get back to our classes quickly.
we're wasting daylight!
you guys go and talk to the counselors.
we'll press the principal, see what he knows.
we'll talk to the kids last. - Okay.
Mr. Maclean, I wanted to... - Agent Lisbon, excuse me. Orrin.
we speak only when recognized as part of the discussion.
okay? Get out of here.
I'm sorry about that. Well, welcome to Bright Arch. Shall we, uh, convene in my office?
Yes, yes, yes.
honey, just try to calm down a little bit, okay?
we'll find everything out. Calm down. - You son of a bitch. What happened?
what happened? What did you do? - Mr. Prentiss... David, let's be calm now.
step back, sir. Now.
it's okay.
this man was supposed to look after my son.
it's his responsibility to keep his students safe, and he didn't!
he didn't! - David!
Mr. Prentiss, let's go and talk. This way.
this way now.
how did you learn about Bright Arch?
one of David's colleagues has a child who had gone way offtrack.
and they saw very positive results from the program.
Justin was misbehaving?
he changed a lot over the last year.
suddenly he was always locked in his room, dour, uncommunicative, violent on occasion.
therapy didn't work.
what kind of violence did he engage in?
he often shouted at me and would threaten his father.
just shouting? No physical abuse, no criminal behavior?
no.
please find out who did this.
please.
kids love to feed off the drama of things like this.
I hope it can be resolved quickly.
you know, you look like Burt Reynolds in this shot.
how long has Bright Arch been running?
almost ten years now.
and that was all of the students?
Yes, we like to keep a low counselor/student ratio so that everyone gets the focused, individual attention that they need.
right. What's the pitch?
I don't follow.
the pitch... the gimmick, the hook.
how do you sell this place to prospective parents?
Oh, we really don't have to sell it. They come by word of mouth.
this is a simple, natural healing community where your, uh, troubled and underachieving sons and daughters are encouraged to get in touch with their inner resources.
encouraged how?
by a code of honor and discipline, by learning wilderness skills and teamwork through an up-close experience with mother nature.
that's a good pitch. - It's a good program.
Yes, Cassie? - Um, I got your tea.
Oh. Thank you.
one of our, uh, our great success stories.
arrived here about nine months ago angry and withdrawn.
she's blossomed wonderfully. - Tell me about Justin.
why was he wearing an electronic monitoring device?
I looked around. I didn't see anyone else wearing one.
Justin had only been with us three months.
he was still in the rebellious phase.
day before yesterday, he left campus without permission for several hours.
he refused to tell us where he had been and with whom.
his punishment was eight hours in the reflection room and the electronic monitoring device for, uh, two weeks.
confinement and dog collars.
Yeah, that'll certainly, uh, encourage the discovery of inner resources, I guess.
but do the kids' parents know that's part of the deal?
it's in the brochure. Page three.
so you must get a lot of problem kids.
how do you handle the psychos... The ones that just won't knuckle under no matter what?
we don't take 'em in the first place. I went thoroughly every acceptance.
so no name jumped into your head when you heard about the murder?
no.
you ever heard of Z.Krew? - No. What's that?
I'd like to talk to Justin's friends.
of course. He was in missy Jenkins' teaching pod. - Great.
bear in mind that I or one of my staff members need to be present before you talk with any of our students.
is that right? - It's the law.
Really?
I hate the woods.
would you rather be playing desk jockey with Van Pelt right now?
who sends their kids to a place like this?
it's not cheap, either.
eh, a little deprivation and discipline Is good for the soul.
Yeah, but this is like a juvie prison camp.
no, this is like spring break in Cancun compared to juvie.
wait. You were in juvenile hall? Seriously?
Yeah. You didn't read my file?
no. Why, did you read mine? - Of course.
what have we got?
interesting, huh?
maybe there's treasure involved.
maybe not.
follow the trail. Find out.
so over and under...
over... And under...
and through. Simple. Again.
over and under
and over... And under.
Chris! Hit the reflection room.
one hour.
Marley, give me 25. - But he started it.
Yeah, I hear you, and I do not care. 25.
Hey, lady!
are you talking to me? - Yeah, I'm talking to you.
this is important. Look at me.
CBI. That's police. There'll be no backchat.
you do exactly as I tell you. - What?
hold this.
california Bureau of Investigation.
well, ma'am, we have reason to believe...
untie me this instant.
sorry, ma'am. Your boss Mr. Maclean told me to do that. - No, he didn't.
Yes, he did. He's in his office right now. Go and ask him.
okay, my people, we have precious little time Until our friend returns.
I need to know who knows the most about what around here.
Elliot's been here, like, two years, So he knows everything.
wow, that's a long time to be stuck out in the woods, huh?
I like it here. - Yeah? So what's the deal with Justin?
who disliked him? - Nobody, He was fine.
Oh, you say that like he was a prize jerk.
no, He wouldn't win any prizes.
I mean, he was basically a good kid.
but he just fought a lot with everybody.
what do you think he was doing out in the woods?
who knows?
the woods are a bad place. - Yeah? Why is that?
the axman Zachariah lives there.
who's Zachariah?
there is no Zachariah.
it's... it's just a story.
Yeah, I was just kidding. - No, you weren't.
come on, guys. Aren't you a little old to believe in stuff like that?
a year ago...
they found a townie kid dead in the woods.
he'd been chopped up with an ax.
his head was 20 feet up in a tree With a crazy look on his face.
okay. Now does Zachariah have anything to do with Z Krew?
was Justin in Z Krew? - Jane?
Jane! What the hell are you playing at?
you can't tie people up. - Uh, yeah. Sorry.
I should think you would be.
my apologies, Mr. Maclean.
we'll be back tomorrow morning if that's convenient.
see you in the morning.
I hope you got something useful for all the trouble you caused.
Yes, I did... the story of the mad axman Zachariah Who lives in these here woods.
Ah,"z.
Yes,"z." I would have gotten more out of 'em, But you came back too quickly.
reality check... I'm your supervising agent. I'm not your decoy.
so, uh, what did it say?
what? - You know, my file.
you haven't read your own file?
no. It's against the rules. - You're kidding.
what? I like rules. Why be a cop if you don't like rules?
come on. What did it say? - You know what it says. It's your life.
I didn't know you were adopted, But other than that, no surprises.
adopted? What? - Kidding.
ha ha, very funny.
so why were you in juvie?
you know. The usual reasons.
that has a mark on this map with a skull and crossbones.
so what are the usual reasons for being in juvie?
I'll tell you all about it sometime.
Hey, check this out.
looks like Justin's shoe. - Yep.
I'll call forensics, mark it up. - Yeah.
Hello? CBI!
anybody home?
Hello?
CBI!
try the other side? - Yeah.
you move, you die, You mameluke sons of bitches!
kneel down! - Hey, we're cops.
Kneel!
I'm... a blow your damn faces off you, you hear?
Winston! Winston, you fool. Put that gun down. Let go.
thank you. - No problem.
Yeah, thanks. What are you doing here?
winston called 911. Lucky I was close.
can you please tell me why I'm still here?
I had nothing to do with that kid who died. Nothing.
you're here because you assaulted us.
but if you want to talk about Justin Prentiss, that's fine.
how am I supposed to know who you are?
you're bangin' on my doors,"CBI! CBI!
like that's supposed to mean somethin'?
Yeah, we do need better brand awareness
but your response was disproportionate.
you brandished a firearm. So here we are.
my security alarm went off.
I was loaded. I reacted. That's all.
you're very security-conscious. Why is that?
why not? Are there people out there who dislike security?
what's been your history of contact With the students from Bright Arch?
zero. I have a zero history of contact.
you know the kid who was killed, Justin Prentiss,
who was buried close to your property line?
he had a sketch map that showed the way to your house Marked with a skull and crossbones.
I don't know what that means.
how about Zachariah? That name ring any bells? - No.
looks like it's gonna be a long night.
I just want to be left alone
and I want those kids to leave me alone!
they go up to my property, mess with my stuff.
they break windows. They spray paint my doors pull all kinds of stunts all night,
like a routine.
okay. So what did you do in response?
I did everything to try and stop them short of actual violence.
I built fences.
I planted poison oak.
I installed alarms.
they just took it all like it was a game.
were they at your house last night? - The night before...
three or four of 'em, throwing balloons of red paint.
would you be able to identify any of the kids involved If you saw them again?
they always wore masks.
I want to apologize for the misunderstanding yesterday.
Mr. Jane will comport himself properly today.
Yes, I will.
who's Zachariah?
who? - Zachariah.
never heard of him. Who is he? -Liar.
liar? - Pants on fire.
they're ablaze. - I want to cooperate with you people.
but this man is trying to... I don't know what he is trying To do, but I resent it.
you should know that you sound more than a little paranoid When you talk like that.
this is what I'm talking about. How is this police work?
Oh, I'm kidding with you. I get bored.
see, the thing is, you have heard of Zachariah.
you know who Zachariah is, and you're scared of Zachariah.
and we're gonna find out why. - Let's put a pin in that, shall we?
we have information putting Justin Prentiss, At Mr. Winston's house the night he went awol.
he went up there on a regular basis with a group of kids, To torment Mr. Winston.
so says Mr. Winston. Has he any proof?
why would he lie? - Because he's a crazy old man with a...
with a grudge against this school.
perhaps he's crazy enough to do something.
he's complained plenty of times. There's never any reality to it.
chief Brody disagrees.
she thinks that some of your students are vandals, And you're protecting them.
chief Brody is a small town cop. She gets ideas in her head.
look, the truth is that nobody around here likes us very much.
they think the kids are all drug addicts and delinquents. They're scared.
you don't mind if we sit down with some of your students
to ask them about Mr. Winston's allegations?
not at all...
as long as you follow proper legal protocol.
of course.
agent Lisbon of the CBI,
would like to talk to you for a moment.
let's all listen with respectful attention, all right?
Jane, they're all yours.
Hello, kids.
uh, that's the best you got?
Hello, kids. - Hello!
Ah, thank you. Thank you.
Ahh. Who wants to see some magic?
hands? Good.
watch me closely.
concentrate.
make sure I don't do anything sneaky.
all right, this is ridiculous. - Hush.
watching my hands...
I'm gonna need a volunteer.
you.
stand up. Come here.
name? - Orrin.
well, Orrin, today's your lucky day.
I'm going to look into your mind, And I'm gonna read your thoughts.
you're thinking,"gosh, I hope he can't read my thoughts, "because then he'd know that I was up in the woods "with Justin Prentiss the night before he died
throwing paint bombs at the old crazy man's door.
Orrin, that was kind of dumb.
you should have thought of something A little more innocent.
we're gonna have to have a little talk.
follow me. Sorry about that.
tell me more about Zachariah.
Orrin, you may ask for a lawyer at any time.
then my parents will know, right? - Yes.
that's okay.
Zachariah and the Z Krew.
why should I tell you? You know what I'm thinking.
Yeah. But it would be more polite If you said it aloud for their benefit.
you can't really read minds, can you?
shrewd insight. No, of course I can't.
then how'd you do that, then-- call me out like that?
you scratched your poison oak rash,
and my colleagues tell me that only grows in one place around here
up at Mr. Winston's. - Fudge.
Yeah. So tell me more about zachariah.
I can't. - Really?
Orrin... We can let this go, or we can take it to the next level.
and that's gonna involve your parents and lawyers.
Zachariah was a lumberjack...
hundreds of years ago.
a log fell on him in the river and pinned him by the arm.
his logging crew tried, but they couldn't get him out.
the river was rising, and a snowstorm was coming.
they figured that he was done for anyway.
so they left him there-- left him for dead.
Zachariah was so angry at them for leaving him that he chopped off his own arm to free himself, then went back to the lumber camp and hacked every one of his workmates to death, then chopped them up and put their heads in trees.
cool.
the lumber camp where they died...
this is it. Right here.
this school is the exact same spot.
and Z Krew? - It's like a secret club.
we go up in the woods and do stuff.
Zachariah is like our leader.
who's like the deputy leader?
I don't know. - No?
come on.
we wear masks. The only person you know is the person who asked you to join the gang.
who was that?
there he is. - I got this.
no, please. I got this.
after you.
nice.
who initiated you to Z Krew, Bryan.
the guy that jumped me in left last year.
who runs Z Krew? - I don't know.
I find it hard to believe you didn't recognize anybody's voice.
there's no talking on Z Krew ops.
we only communicate by note and sign language.
that's the whole fun of it.
look, Z Krew's about running around in the woods, playing warriors.
nobody gets killed.
Z Krew's got nothing to do with Justin's murder.
do you? - No!
you want my guess?
guesswork is inappropriate for this sort of situation, Bryan.
Guesswork's okay.
Cassie.
she's in it somehow. - How so?
Justin was...
he was big in love with her.
she wouldn't deal, and he didn't like it.
I saw them arguing,
both real mad, a couple days ago.
and now she's totally freaked out about his death. So, you know...
many of us are upset, Bryan.
does Cassie have a boyfriend? - No.
so what do you think happened? Cassie killed him?
that's ridiculous. - Let him answer.
hey... Ask her. All I'm saying... It wasn't me.
do you know where we can find Cassie right now?
I'm sure that she has nothing to do with this.
but I will have someone fetch her for you.
gave you a little trouble, huh? - Nah.
Hey, guys.
what happened to you? - Old age.
shut up, you.
what are you doing here? - Gee, thanks for the welcome.
no, I mean-- you know what I mean.
lisbon wanted an extra hand If we're gonna have to interview all the students and staff.
Seriously? This is the biggest they had?
Hey, Van Pelt. - Hey, boss.
we're short a girl by the name Cassie Miniver.
Bryan says that Justin was in love the Cassie,
recently saw them in a fierce argument.
Oh, Cassie. Yeah, she brought Maclean a cup of tea.
Yeah. We wanted to question her, but she's gone.
interesting.
anybody else missing? - No, there isn't.
so she's most likely running, not abducted. - Precisely.
so what do you think, boss?
chief Brody's setting up a full-scale search,
so we should probably start looking in the woods Around the school.
Oh, that sounds horribly tedious. Shout if you need me.
go ahead, relax. Enjoy yourself.
God forbid you should do anything tedious.
can I ask you something?
would you-- have you ever read Your coworker's personnel files?
uh... No. Why?
no, uh, good. Neither did I.
where are you headed?
into town.
excellent. That's exactly where I need to go.
all right.
Thanks. Grateful.
would you shut the gate for me, please?
uh, nope. - Why?
Well,'cause as soon as I get out of the car, then you'll drive away without me.
why on earth would I do that?
the three Furies...
fear, shame, guilt. - What?
the heart wants what the heart wants, and it won't be denied. It makes us do bad things.
what are you talking about?
Cassie, I have a gift for you.
Cassie? Needn't be shy.
here.
try it on.
beautiful.
what is this?
Mr. Maclean was helping Cassie run away.
Why? - He didn't want us to speak to her because...
I have nothing to say. - Nonsense. You have plenty to say.
he wanted her to go before we get a chance to talk to her and find out that she and he were having what you would call, uh... sexual relations.
is that true? - I'm saying nothing. I admit nothing.
I want to talk to my lawyer. Cassie!
don't say anything.
you miserable little pervert!
that's enough, chief. - She assaulted me!
I don't think so. We're going back to Sacramento.
now you can either come of your own accord or we can arrest you. Which is it?
fine.
good choice.
we didn't.
we... we weren't. No.
Cassie...Look at me.
it's very easy to see when you're lying.
you get a little pulse going in your neck just... there. Yeah.
always best to tell Agent Lisbon the truth.
did Mr. Maclean have sexual relations with you?
it's okay.
Yes, he did.
one time or more than that? - More.
maybe twice a week for a few months.
you know that by having sexual relations with you,
Mr. Maclean was committing a crime, right?
I guess. - Was it consensual?
I guess. - You guess.
uh, did you want Mr. Maclean to have sex with you?
no, ma'am.
so he coerced you.
no, ma'am.
I don't... understand. - I was scared.
scared of who? Mr. Maclean?
no, he's just... a sad creep.
who, then?
you can talk freely, Cassie. You're safe here.
nowhere is safe.
Zachariah made you do it?
zombie Lumber Jack made you sleep with Mr. Maclean.
he told me I had to.
Cassie, you know that Zachariah doesn't exist.
you know that kid that they found chopped up in the woods?
he thought the same thing.
okay, how... how does Zachariah tell you his wishes?
through somebody from Z Krew, maybe? - I've said too much already.
I don't... I don't want to say anymore.
please don't make me.
I'll be right back.
Cassie made a statement.
charge Mr. Maclean with statutory rape.
will do, boss.
sex with a minor. Tell you what...things look very bad for you right now.
I was kind and caring to a troubled girl. That... that's all.
Yeah, that's what they all say...
until the lab tests come back.
see, the way we have to figure this is that Justin Prentiss was in love with Cassie - and found out that you were abusing her. - Oh, please.
abusing her, and he threatened to tell the authorities.
so you clubbed him to death, you thought, and buried him. - No. No!
no? Well, that's what we're thinking.
how are we wrong? Did he attack you? Was it self-defense, maybe?
I want my lawyer. I'm saying nothing more to you people.
we got nothing to put him with Justin that night.
we need a confession.
you won't get one. - Why won't we get one?
prize for the first one to tell me the answer.
just tell us your damn theory.
I will do that on our way back to Bright Arch.
we need to get there in time for the sacred fire ritual.
Rigsby, let's you and I have a quick cup of tea, then we'll go, huh?
explain first. Then we'll go.
sacred fire?
Hello, kids. Good to see you all again.
pretty dramatic few days, huh?
you probably heard a lot of crazy stuff about what's been going on.
well... Don't worry about it.
life goes on.
your teachers thought I'd be good to carry on With the sacred fire ceremony as usual.
everyone okay with that?
excellent.
I thought we'd start with a ghost story.
you all know about Zachariah, yeah? - We do.
but we don't talk about him. - It's bad luck.
Zachariah doesn't scare me.
so everyone knows about that terrible evening
when Zachariah hacked his former friends to pieces, yeah?
what a lot of people don't know is what happened after that horrible incident.
as punishment,
the townspeople gathered together
and built a huge bonfire Right here...
on this very spot.
and they burned Zachariah alive.
and as the flames melted the flesh from his body,
Zachariah didn't scream.
he just smiled at those watching.
and he made a solemn vow
that whenever someone does evil in these woods,
if you call Zachariah's name three times
and mark the ground with a "z," Then he will rise from the grave and he will take them.
Yeah, right.
and if the sinner doesn't confess his sins, If he doesn't repent, then Zachariah will drag them down Into his ghastly lair,
to suffer with him in black darkness For all eternity.
that's it? - Yes, that's it.
that was weak, dude.
well, it's only weak if the curse isn't true.
and we all know that evil has been done in these woods.
but is there anyone here willing to call Zachariah's name?
anyone?
told you. Weak.
you forgot the most important part.
you have to mark the ground with a "z.
guess he's on vacation.
elliott, was it you? Did you kill Justin?
elliott, this is your last chance. Did you kill Justin?
Yes! Yes, it was me!
saved. That was close.
Oh, hey, Rigsby.
I... I... I knew it was a joke.
I... I was just kidding.
no, you're a liar and a murderer, Elliot.
everyone can see that.
whoa, whoa, whoa, a little help here. - Give it up, kid. Come on. It's over.
Justin was an insect.
he shouldn't have interfered.
Yes. You had a sweet little system going.
you kept the kids in line with messages from Zachariah,
and you kept Maclean in line with blackmail.
protect Elliot and let the Z Krew rule,
or be exposed as a habitual rapist. You're a very clever young man.
Yes, I am.
that's why my parents abandoned me in this dump.
I'm too clever for them. And for you.
you haven't really caught me.
I'm a minor. Nothing bad will happen to me.
then why don't you tell us why you killed Justin? For the record.
you know why.
Justin was always soft on Cassie.
but when he found out What she was doing with Maclean on my order...
he got angry, threatened to ruin everything.
and I tried to shut him up with a message from Zachariah.
he wouldn't back off. He laughed at me.
he shouldn't have done that.
I don't like being laughed at.
well, good-bye, Elliot.
how did you know it was me?
when Cassie brought Maclean tea in a cup with z's on it,
that was a warning from you to keep his mouth shut.
you were the first to bring forth the Zachariah story,
and you've been at this school longer than anyone else,
with no desire to leave.
the sacred fire ceremony confirmed my hunch.
everybody else was scared that I was invoking Zachariah,
but you... you were contemptuous and cynical.
a true artist watching a cheap imitator...
until fear made you a believer.
it can do that to you. Bye.
sit down.
I appreciate everything that you've done. - It's our job.
thank you. - yeah.
Oh, there he is.
uh, here I am.
I was just telling Mr. and Mrs. Prentiss
it was you that found their son's killer.
Yes, uh, I'm very sorry for your loss.
thank you. Thank you so much.
we're very grateful.
it gives us some kind of closure at least.
your son died bravely.
he saved a young girl in trouble. You should be very proud.
anyplace. THE SUSPECT CAN LEAVE THE BODY ANYPLACE,
and THEY DUMP IT ON THE ONLY STATE LAND WITHIN HUNDRED MILES OF HERE, - MAKING IT OURS. GREAT. - WHY IS THAT A BAD THING?
Oh, COME ON. YOU SAW THE BODY.
it's A COINCIDENCE.
Nah. JANE TAUGHT ME ONE THING...

no. NO SUCH THING AS A COINCIDENCE, NOT WITH HIM.
what ARE YOU ALL TALKING ABOUT? WHO'S "HIM"?
red JOHN. HE'S A SERIAL KILLER. THIS IS HIS STYLE OF CUTTING.
look AT THE TOENAILS. - YEAH, I SEE THEM.
painted IN HER OWN BLOOD, JUST LIKE MY WIFE.
this IS RED JOHN, AND HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE I WAS ON THIS CASE.
it's STRANGE, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT,
but YOU'RE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS. OKAY? THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN KNOW FOR SURE...
what the hell?
Oh god.
man, THIS NICOTINE GUM IS LIKE CHEWING ON A TIRE.
what DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE FAMILY?
old MONEY. MR. PLASKETT'S AN ARCHITECT, MOM'S A SCULPTOR.
there's BEEN PLASKETTS IN THIS COUNTY SINCE BEFORE THERE WAS A COUNTY,
which MEANS SOMETHING TO PEOPLE AROUND HERE.
been HERE TEN YEARS. I'M STILL THE NEW GUY.
have YOU FOUND MAYA? IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
where IS SHE?
we DON'T KNOW AS OF YET, BUT EVERY EFFORT IS BEING
where IS SHE? - THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
we HAVE TO LET THEM DO THEIR JOB.
can WE TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR GIRLS' BEDROOMS?
Yes, OF COURSE.
thank YOU.
come ON, MRS. PLASKETT.
here IT IS.
we, UH...
we TRIED HAVING THEM SLEEP IN SEPARATE BEDROOMS, BUT IT NEVER TOOK.
they PREFERRED BEING TOGETHER.
in YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, DO YOU THINK THAT MAYA IS DEAD ALSO?
Yes.
we KEEP AN OPEN MIND. WE'RE ASSUMING THAT SHE'S ALIVE.
there's ALWAYS HOPE.
not MUCH.
I SEE.
well, THANK YOU FOR YOUR CANDOR.
Mr. PLASKETT?
perhaps YOUR WIFE NEEDS YOU TO BE WITH HER RIGHT NOW.
Yes, OF COURSE.
why SO CRUEL?
statistically, IT'S DAD THAT DID IT.
well, SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE ABOUT STATISTICS?
I JUST WANTED TO RAISE HIS PULSE A LITTLE.
hold ON. THIS IS A RED JOHN CASE.
the CUTTING STYLE, THE PAINTED TOENAILS, THE SKYWRITING
you PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, IT'S HARD TO DISMISS.
Yeah, IT'S RED JOHN, ALL RIGHT,
but SOMEONE ELSE IS INVOLVED.
else, WHY WOULD HE CHANGE HIS M. O. SO RADICALLY?
Skywriting?
he WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CBI,
that YOU, WOWOD BE PUT ON THIS CASE.
he's OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO LURE YOU INTO SOME KINDA TRAP.
well, THAT'S PART OF IT, BUT WHY TAKE THEM FROM A CAR INSTEAD OF CATCHING THEM AT HOME ALONE,
like HE'S ALWAYS DONE BEFORE? AND WHY TWO VICTIMS AT ONCE? TWINS? WHY BREAK PATTERN?
well, HE'S BROKEN PATTERN ONCE BEFORE.
Yes, BECAUSE IT WAS PERSONAL.
he WANTED TO PUNISH ME.
I DON'T THINK THESE GIRLS ARE RANDOM TARGETS.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING PERSONAL BEHIND THIS.
red JOHN EITHER KNOWS THEM OR KNOWS SOMEONE CLOSE TO THEM.
Hey, CBI. - Hey.
you THE PILOT WHO DREW THAT FACE OVER SAN ANGELO TWO HOURS AGO?
that WAS ME. HOW'D IT LOOK? CLEAN? GOOD AND ROUND?
why'd YOU DO THAT, DRAW THE FACE?
I-I GOT AN INTERNET ORDER FROM SOME COMPANY UP IN SAN FRANCISCO
R-JASOSOTUTIS, INC. I THINK THEY WERE CALLED.
R-JAY? - YEAH.
they PAID THE FULL $1, 250 UP-FRONT BY CASH TRANSFER. SO WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
do YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS FOR R-JAY?
Yes, MA'AM, I DO, IN MY OFFICE. - GREAT.
there's A BROTHER?
Yes. HE'S ON HIS WAY DOWN. HE LIVES UP IN PARKERSVILLE.
boyfriends?
they HAD BOYFRIENDS, BUT NOBODY SERIOUS.
anyone AT THE MOMENT?
no, NOBODY RIGHT NOW.
no, IT CAN OFTEN BE HARD FOR BOYS TO HAVE A CHANCE. THEY'RE SUCH A STRONG COUPLE.
but STILL, VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.
yes... IF YOU KNOW THEM WELL.
darker, MOODIER, THE RISK-TAKER.
MAYA--SHE'S A HAPPIER SOUL, MORE CAUTIOUS,
more CONSERVATIVE.
Yes.
how DO YOU KNOW THAT ABOUT THEM?
well, I TELL YOU THAT,
only SO YOU'LL KNOW THAT THERE ISN'T ANY POINT IN LYING TO US.
lying? WHY WOULD WE LIE TO YOU?
Arden, DO YOU ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR HUSBAND'S LEAD?
do YOU NEVER STRUGGLE AGAINST HIS DESIRE TO CONTROL?
excuse ME?
just 'CAUSE YOU DRINK TOO MUCH DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE A SAY.
I MEAN, I SHOULD THINK HE'S AT LEAST HALF THE REASON YOU DRINK IN THE FIRST PLACE.
yeah? A GOOD MAN, BUT COLD, PIOUS.
you KNOW, POSSESSION OF THAT BADGE DOES NOT EXCUSE YOU FROM ACTING WITH NORMAL HUMAN DECENCY.
quiet, NOAH. JUST BE QUIET.
we've BEEN ASHAMED TO TALK ABOUT THIS,
but FOR A FEW MOHT, OUR GIRLS HAVE BEEN MIXED UP...
with DRUGS... AND THE LOW SORT OF PEOPLE THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT.
Drake, OUR SON, HEARD THAT EMMA
was ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH A DUBIOUS CHARACTER.
she DENIED IT, TOTALLY.
so WE DON'T REALLY KNOW FOR SURE
exactly. WE DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE.
do YOU KNOW HIS NAME?
I KNOW A GUTHRIE. SMALL-TIME THIEF.
here IT IS. IT'S GUTHRIE'S PLACE.
nice, ISN'T IT?
you CARRY A GUN?
no, NEVER.
you HANG BACK A TAD, HUH? - OH, YEAH, SURE.
all RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA DO THIS NICE AND EASY. - OKAY.
come ON, GUTHRIE. OPEN UP.
Guthrie, FREEZE!
you OKAY, DUKE?
I'm OKAY.
shake IT OFF, BIG GUY.
that's A VERY LOYAL DOG.
your STORE IS LISTED AS THE MAILING ADDRESS FOR R-JAY SOLUTIONS, INC.
Yes. OKAY.
suite 121?
sure. right here.
uh, NO, MA'AM, UH, A SUITE IS LIKE A ROOM OR AN OFFICE.
a SUITE IS A BOX.
you're A SMALL COMPANY, YOU LOOK BIG.
okay, WE NEED TO OPEN BOX 121,
and WE NEED ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE ON WHO RENTED IT.
no PROBLEM. YOU HAVE A WARRANT?
ma'am, THIS IS A MURDER INVESTIGATION.
we CAN GET A WARRANT, BUT THAT TAKES TIME, AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE HERE.
no PROBLEM. GO GET A WARRANT. I'LL BE HERE.
following THE LAW.
you HAVE A WIFE?
no. I HAVE A NIECE.
Thanks. THAT'S OKAY.
when YOU COME BACK, I SHOW YOU A PICTURE.
very PRETTY.
thank YOU.
okay, OPEN IT UP.
you GOT IT.
be careful now, Duke.
Hey, BUDDY.
easy, BOY. EASY, BOY. YOU GOT SOMETHING?
hands UP. - OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.
who's A GOOD BOY? THAT'S A GOOD DOG.
what?
Emma AND MAYA PLASKETT.
what ABOUT 'EM? - YOU DIDN'T HEAR?
what?
Emma WAS FOUND HORRIBLY MURDERED THIS MORNING, AND MAYA IS MISSING.
Oh, MY GOD.
were YOU HAVING A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH EITHER OF THEM?
no.
Really?
no.
never. MAYBE HUNG OUT WITH THEM A COUPLE TIMES. THAT'S IT.
I SEE YOU CARE FOR BOTH OF THEM, AND I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
that's A BAD IDEA.
I GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
please UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.
I HAVE A VERY DEEP PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS CASE.
I'll DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
I WILL HAVE YOU FRAMED FOR MURDER.
I WILL TORTURE YOU. I WILL KILL YOU MYSELF IF I HAVE TO-- WHATEVER IT TAKES.
Oh, JEEZ, LISBON.
come ON. THIS IS ON TAPE. CONTROL YOUR MAN THERE.
cut HIM SOME SLACK. LOOK, HE'S JUST PLAYING THE GUY.
he DOESN'T MEAN IT. - DOESN'T HE?
you KNOW WHAT RED JOHN DOES TO HIM. HE CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.
he WOULD DO ALL THAT HE SAID AND MORE, IF YOU LET HIM.
I WON'T LET HIM.
Emma AND ME HAD A THING.
she, UM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAW IN ME,
but SHE LIKED ME, YOU KNOW?
both OF THOSE GIRLS HAD A WAY ABOUT 'EM.
they LOOK AT YOU LIKE THEY REALLY SEE YOU.
Yeah.
so ME AND EMMA HAD BEEN HOOKIN' UP FOR ABOUT A MONTH, AND I GET A PHONE CALL,
from SOME GUY THAT I DON'T KNOW,
saying, "STAY AWAY FROM HER OR ELSE," AND HE HANGS UP BEFORE I CAN TELL HIM TO EAT IT.
can YOU DESCRIBE HIS VOICE?
uh, SOFT...
quiet.
did YOU DO WHAT HE SAID?
no, OF COURSE NOT.
I KEPT SEEING HER.
and THEN I WAKE UP ONE MORNING A COUPLE WEEKS LATER,
and THERE'S A PIG'S HEAD LYING NEXT TO ME.
I LOCK AND BOLT MY DOORS EVERY NIGHT.
there's NO WAY SOMEBODY GETS IN THERE,
but THEY DID.
it's MENTAL. RIGHT?
the THING IS, ME AND EMMA WERE ON THE DOWN LOW.
nobody KNEW.
she INSISTED ON THAT.
so HOW DID HE KNOW?
he MUST HAVE BEEN SPYING OHER REAL CLOSE.
how DID YOU PEOPLE KNOW?
good MORNING. - MORNING.
I'm DRAKE PLASKETT. I'M MAYA AND EMMA'S BROTHER.
agent LISBON. THIS IS JANE. - PATRICK JANE.
have YOU FOUND MAYA?
no, MA'AM. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU,
we're CONTINUING THE SEARCH WITH EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCE.
please COME IN.
where HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR HER?
I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT, MA'AM.
to CLARIFY, THE CBI CONDUCTS THE INVESTIGATIVE ASPECTS.
sheriff HARDY IS VERY ABLY INVESTIGATING THE PHYSICAL SEARCH.
and SHERIFF HARDY WILL CALL US IF HE HAS NEWS, MOM.
how CAN WE HELP YOU, AGENT LISBON?
you TOLD US IT WAS DRAKE WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT GUTHRIE.
Yes. - HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?
uh, ABOUT A MONTH AGO, I'D SAY,
I WAS STAYING THE WEEKEND, OVERHEARD THE GIRLS TALKING,
Emma TELLING MAYA THAT THIS GUTHRIE CHARACTER WAS DANGEROUS,
and SHE SHOULD BE CAREFUL.
naturally, I WAS VERY CONCERNED. I TOLD MY PARENTS.
and THEN WE DECIDED TO CONFRONT EMMA ABOUT IT.
I SEE. IF YOU COULD SIT DOWN WITH US, DRAKE,
and GIVE US A STATEMENT, IT'D BE REALLY HELPFUL.
of COURSE. ANYTHING YOU NEED.
I'm JUST GONNA GO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE GIRLS' ROOM, IF I MAY.
of COURSE. - SURE.
a CAMERA, MICROPHONE TRANSMITTER.
someone WAS SPYING ON OUR DAUGHTERS? - YEAH.
who HAD ACCESS TO THIS ROOM?
nobody. JUST US AND JANINE, THE HOUSEKEEPER.
nobody ELSE?
no. NOBODY.
Drake, HOW'S YOUR ELECTRONIC SKILLS?
you're ACCUSING ME OF THIS?
let's BE FAIR HERE. YOU'RE THE LIKELIEST SUSPECT. YOU CAN SEE THAT.
you DID SAY YOU OVERHEARD AN INTIMATE PRIVATE CONVERSATION BETWEEN E TWO OF THEM.
no, THEY'RE MY LITTLE SISTERS. I LOVE THEM.
no ONE'S DOUBTING THAT.
where WERE YOU NIGHT BEFORE LAST?
at HOME, ALONE-- - NO, WAIT.
wait. THERE WAS A BREAK-IN EIGHT MONTHS AGO.
that's RIGHT. THEY BROKE THE KITCHEN DOOR TO GET IN.
they TOOK SOME CASH, SOME LIQUOR, BROKE A FEW VASES.
we JUST ASSUMED IT WAS TEENAGERS ON A SPREE.
that'd BE A GOOD COVER. DID YOU REPORT IT TO THE POLICE?
Yes, WE DID, AND THE SHERIFF WILL CONFIRM IT.
excuse ME.
Hey. yeah.
we GOT THE WARRANT. WE'RE ABOUT TO OPEN THE MAILBOX.
Yeah, JANE SAID HE WANTED TO BE ON THE LINE WHEN WE OPENED IT.
okay. ONE MINUTE.
my NIECE.
beautiful, LIKE A MOVIE STAR, BUT WELL-BEHAVED.
Yeah, SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.
Oh, YEAH. GO FOR IT, MAN.
I'm NOT LOOKING TO GET MARRIED RIGHT NOW, MA'AM. THANK YOU, THOUGH.
Yeah, I'M STILL HERE. MM-HMM. YOU READY, MA'AM?
uh, YEAH, OPEN UP.
okay. UH, IT'S AN ENVELOPE.
it's TYPEWRITTEN, POSTMARKED HATTIESBURG, 20th OF DECEMBER,
addressed TO ROY TAGLIAFERRO.
dear ROY, "I FOUND THIS ADDRESS ON A BUSINESS CARD OF YOURS THAT I DISCOVERED DOWN THE BACK OF THE SOFA.
and SO I WRITE TO YOU TODAY IN THE FAINT HOPE "THAT THIS LETTER MAY FIND YOU. IF IT DOES...
and YOU ARE READING THIS, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I STILL LOVE YOU VERY MUCH, "DESPITE THE VERY CRUEL WAY YOU TREATED ME, AND I HOPE YOU WILL COME BACK TO ME ONE DAY.
with ALL MY HEART, ROSALIND.
it's HIM.
I KNOW IT.
I know it.
this ROY TAGLIAFERRO IS RED JOHN.
we DON'T KNOW THAT.
well, WE KNOW RED JOHN KILLED EMMA,
so WE CAN ASSUME THAT RED JOHN HIRED THE SKYWRITER.
the SKYWRITER WAS GIVEN THE ORDER BY R-JAY SOLUTIONS.
R-JAY SOLUTIONS IS RAY TAGLIAFERRO.
hence, ROY TAGLIAFERRO IS RED JOHN.
maybe.
this WOMAN, ROSALIND, HAS SEEN RED JOHN.
Lisbon, SHE-- SHE KNOWS RED JOHN.
this IS HIM.
are YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT ROSALIND?
there's ONLY TWO ROSALINDS IN THE HATTIESBURG PHONE BOOK.
the OTHER ONE'S 73 AND MARRIED.
rosalind HARKER? - YES?
we're WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.
may WE COME IN?
would YOU SHOW ME SOME I. D. PLEASE?
what ARE YOU INVESTIGATING?
we're WITH THE HOMICIDE AND SERIOUS CRIMES UNIT.
what CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT ROY?
not A THING UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHY YOU WANT TO KNOW.
we BELIEVE HE COULD BE A SERIAL MURDERER NAMED RED JOHN.
no.
that's ABSURD.
may WE COME IN? - NO.
no, MA'AM, WE'RE NOT LEAVING. - YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.
ma'am? MS. HARKER?
I'm NOT LISTENING. I DON'T HEAR YOU.
ma'am?
ms. HARKER?
rosalind? - GO AWAY.
I CAN'T DO THAT.
there IS A GIRL MISSING.
her NAME IS MAYA. SHE'S 19.
her SISTER HAS ALREADY BEEN KILLED BY RED JOHN.
we DON'T KNOW, BUT HE MIGHT HAVE HER CAPTIVE SOMEWHERE.
this... MAN, RED JOHN...
killed MY WIFE AND CHILD.
that's WHY I'M HERE, ROSALIND.
that's WHY I CAN'T LEAVE.
I'm SORRY.
that's TERRIBLE.
I'm BLIND, BUT I'M NOT BLIND.
I'm A GOOD JUDGE OF HUMAN NATURE.
I HAVE TO BE.
I KNOW ROY VERY WELL.
I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY.
and I'M SURE, AS SURE AS...
this GROUND BENEATH MY FEET...
I KNOW THAT ROY IS A GOOD MAN.
I BELIEVE YOU.
I'm SORRY.
that's OKAY.
we ALL MAKE MISTAKES. GOD KNOWS.
maybe THIS RED JOHN IS JUST USING ROY'S IDENTITY SOMEHOW.
if WE COULD FIND ROY, MAYBE HE COULD HELP US FIND RED JOHN.
Roy CAME TO MY DOOR ONE DAY
when HIS CAR HAD BROKEN DOWN OFF THE ROAD.
he NEEDED TO USE THE TELEPHONE.
so I MADE HIM SOME LEMONADE,
and WE GOT TALKING ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC,
and...
he DIDN'T LEAVE FOR TWO DAYS.
you TWO WERE LOVERS?
Yes.
that's VERY BRAVE OF YOU. - I HAVE TO BE.
how LONG WERE YOU TOGETHER?
Roy WAS IN MY LIFE FOR...
about FIVE MONTHS.
he WOULD COME AND GO AS HE PLEASED,
said HE WAS DOING BUSINESS IN THE AREA.
what KIND OF BUSINESS? - HE DIDN'T SAY.
you DIDN ASKSK YOU WEREN'T CURIOUS?
no.
I DIDN'T CARE. I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR WORLD. I LIVE HERE.
I WAS GLAD WHEN HE CAME,
sad WHEN HE LEFT.
you SAID IN YOUR LETTER THAT HE WAS CRUEL TO YOU.
very CRUEL.
he LEFT AND JUST NEVER CAME BACK.
never SAID GOOD-BYE,
why HE WAS LEAVING OR WHERE HE WAS GOING.
just VANISHED.
it's BEEN NEARLY SIX MONTHS NOW.
can YOU DESCRIBE HIM?
just UNDER 6 FEET TALL...
not MUSCULAR, BUT NOT SOFT EITHER...
short, STRAIGHT HAIR...
a GENTLE VOICE...
rough, STRONG HANDS.
he SMELLED OF...
pine AND...
nails AND EARTH. AND HE LIKED TO LISTEN TO ME PLAY THE PIANO.
what WAS HIS FAVORITE MUSIC?
Bach. HE ADMIRED HIS RIGOR.
did ANYBODY SEE HIM? A MAILMAN, A CLEANING LADY?
no.
I LEAD A FAIRLY SOLITARY LIFE.
did HE EVER MENTION ANY FRIENDS, PEOPLE FROM WORK?
no.
he DID BRING A FRIEND OF HIS OVER ONCE, THOUGH,
for THANKSGIVING.
DUMAR.
DUMAR. ANY OTHER NAME?
just DUMAR.
couldn't BELIEVE A BLIND WOMAN COULD COOK.
came OVER ESPECIALLY TO SEE.
can YOU RECALL ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM?
he SMOKED A LOT.
he SAID HE WAS TRYING TO QUIT, BUT HE SMOKED SO MUCH,
he HAD TO RUN OUT TO THE STORE TO BUY MORE CIGARETTES.
when HE CAME BACK,
he HAD BOUGHT A STUFFED TOY ELEPHANT
as A GIFT FOR ME.
that WAS A GOOD DAY.
Roy CAME A COUPLE MORE TIMES AFTER THAT,
and THEN THAT WAS IT.
gone.
do YOU STILL HAVE IT? THE STUFFED ELEPHANT.
Yes, I DO.
first THING IN THE MORNING, CHECK ON ALL THE CONVENIENCE STORES IN THAT AREA.
it WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE
someone WILL REMEMBER SELLING THE ELEPHANT AND CIGARETTES TOGETHER. IT WAS THANKSGIVING.
Yes, SIR. - YOU GOT IT, CHIEF.
