traffic lights are crucial tools for regulating traffic flow.
traffic lights are usually controlled by an "optimal" timed cycle maximized to suit an expected flow of traffic for the time of day, but the problem is the large variability of traffic volume and the direction vehicles travel on leaving an intersection even on a "typical" day.
traffic lights around the world from guangzhou to geneva are managed by computerised systems housed in a metal cabinet at the side of the road which regulate the cycle of changes from red to green to red either through fixed time periods or through sensors in the road that can detect when a car is stationary.
traffic lights could request green time only when there is a definite demand for them, the researchers write.
traffic management devices such as sto signs, yield signs, caution lights, and stop lights are used to control traffic in such a way as to prevent collisions and to optimize traffic flow and traffic patterns. This is also what traffic management means when used in the contrext of agvs.
traffic management measures will only provide local, limited short-term relief. They can complement but cannot replace cwb.
