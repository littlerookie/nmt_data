and she was fine at first.
then she started calling every ten minutes to remind me to give Paige her medicine or to make sure that parker wore his retainer.
she needs to be needed.
exactly. - And given what I've been going through, I kinda get that.
so if you could, Susan, cut her a break. She's lost a lot.
I don't want her losing you, too.
I think that's why she's going so overboard on this nursery thing.
she hopes it'll get Julie excited about the baby, maybe bring her back.
you know, you're taking all my anger away, and that's not gonna leave me anything.
Yeah, it will. It'll leave you your friend.
many holes in the metro area.
ladies and gentlemen...
what you won't do to get out of being married to me.
Aw, crap. I knew I couldn't trust the jumping bean to keep her mouth shut.
these are for you.
rushing things a bit, don't ya think? Not dead yet.
what the hell were you thinking?
I didn't want to put you through this again.
Karen, I married you for better or worse.
we had the better, and now...
well, what if I say I don't want you here? - You're an old lady. What are you gonna do about it?
I'm scared. - I know.
Hey, Renee. - Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know that Ben's test results just got back, and, uh, everything is normal.
he's getting out tomorrow.
Oh, that's great news. - Oh, and I got more.
we're back together, and I have you to thank for that.
well, you don't have to give me credit.
uh, yeah, I do, because if he breaks my heart again, I'm giving you the blame.
Hey, did you say you're at the hospital? - Yeah.
is anybody staying at your place? - No. Why?
I just thought I saw a light turn on. It's probably nothing, but I'll go check it out.
what the hell are you doin'? - Some people use voice mail.
I prefer to deliver my messages in person.
So...Why don't you just move along before you get involved?
too late. - I keep forgetting you're the tough guy around here.
well...I don't want any trouble.
I don't ever wanna see you again.
then you should have killed me.
hang on. Wait, wait, wait.
surprise! Welcome home! - Whoa! Who did this?
I did. - Really?
cause when I got home from prison, all you left me was a post-it note on the fridge, and it said, "take out the trash, ex-con.
well, I don't want to take you for granted anymore.
you sound like you actually mean that.
what's going on? - Karen's cancer is back...
and it's bad. That's why she threw Roy out. - Oh, god.
kind of makes you think. I mean, when we got married, I thought that was the finish line.
but it's not. Death is. No one told us that.
Yeah, they did. At our wedding, they said, "till death do us part."
Oh, Carlos, please. I had four glasses of champagne before the ceremony.
I almost married your uncle.
Oh, come on, Gaby.
I mean, the idea that we might die someday must have at least crossed your mind.
I just never thought about what it really means, that one of us is gonna die, and the other one's gonna live through it.
and if it's you who's first?
I don't think I can do it. - Yes, you can.
you're one of the bravest people I know.
look at what we've been through this year. You've been my rock.
I have? - Well...
you and Scotch. But from now on, just you. - Thank you.
and, hey, if it makes you feel any better, you can always take the easy way out-die first.
what's going on with the name? You didn't change it to "sop," did you?
cause that's even worse than "Lynette."
Lynette isn't so bad.
thanks for that. - Yeah, well...
thank you for all the rest of this. So you need anything?
the nail holes need to be spackled. - I'm on it.
Hello? - Bree, it's Orson.
listen to me. Don't you ever call my house again. - I can assure you this is the last you'll hear from me.
what do you want, Orson? - I've been thinking about what you said, and you're right.
the sins that have been committed are so reprehensible that a sacrifice must be made.
the ultimate sacrifice.
do not consider suicide.
that would only be adding more sins to your list.
you don't have to judge, Bree. Someone else will do that for you.
Good-bye...Forever.
Yes.
there are times when we all could use a little help.
when our generosity has been repaid with cruelty...
when our behavior has filled us with regret...
and when our future has become terribly uncertain.
but then there are those who are past the point of help, and in their wake, they leave nothing but destruction.
Carlos needed to make a change.
I am miserable at work. I can't do it anymore.
Orson sent the police an anonymous tip.
got a feeling about this.
enough of a feeling to go dig up a construction site?
Mike protected Renee...
he is a good man.
but he paid the price.
every day on Wisteria Lane, women face their share of problems...
like a paperboy who's off the mark...
an appliance that's out of whack...
or a report card that's below par.
these everyday problems can seem like matters of life and death.
I've told your paperboy ten times...
the flower bed sprinklers go on at 6: 00 A. M. sharp.
I don't know how you can call him a repairman if after he visits, the thing is not repaired.
and get this, Carlos. Her math teacher wrote, "the only thing worse than her arithmetic is her attitude."
but then something truly horrible comes along...
and we rush to hold on to what really matters before it's gone forever.
when a loved one dies, certain decisions have to be made.
a coffin must be selected.
a headstone must be picked.
clothes must be chosen.
preparing a body for burial is never an easy thing to do...
but unearthing one can be even harder.
Hey! I think we got something.
what do you think?
you look handsome.
what's that under your shirt?
my little tribute to Mike.
he would've loved that.
he was always trying to get me to go to Indianapolis for a game.
and I was too busy being a big executive, helping rich people get richer.
that'll be a great eulogy someday, huh?
is this about you wanting to quit your job again so you can be an underpaid counselor?
I'm never gonna be able to get you to understand this, am I?
what a difference it would make in my life if I felt like I was helping people.
you're right. I'm never gonna understand it, and I also don't understand why we have to talk about this today.
because my best friend is dead, and he died trying to help people, so if you ask me, it kind of seems like the perfect day to talk about it.
this one?
sure.
um, shoes?
you pick.
Hi, Reverend.
Hello, Julie.
Susan.
I, um, wanted to show you a... rough draft of Mike's funeral service.
it's what we discussed...
a standard Episcopalian ceremony.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
um, just wanted to see if you'd like to add anything to make it a little more personal.
readings, for example.
did he have any favorite poems?
any favorite writers?
Mike really wasn't much of a reader.
that's fine.
were you planning on saying something during the service?
like what, "I wish someone hadn't murdered my husband"?
mom...
he's just trying to help.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just, uh...
I don't know what I would say that would be enough.
I don't know how to tell people what kind of man Mike was...
what kind of father and husband and friend he was.
I just...
never thought I would have to sum up his life before he was... done living it.
it's going to be okay.
please, Reverend, if there's one thing that I know for sure at this moment, is that...
nothing is ever going to be okay again.
Hey.
Hey.
how's Susan holding up?
she'll be really glad you came.
I caught the first flight after you called me.
I'm just, uh...
I'm still in shock.
you know what I keep thinking about all morning?
do you remember that time you, me, Mike, and Susan rented those cabins by the lake?
Oh, no. The pontoon boat?
Yeah, the pontoon boat with the broken gas gauge.
and I kept telling everybody, "Don't worry."
"they'll come looking for us." - And then the sun started to go down.
who knew Mike was such a great swimmer?
I know. It was half a mile to shore, at least, in cold water.
he was an amazing guy.
I just can't believe I'm never gonna see him walk out of that house again.
I'm sorry.
I've been doing a really good job keeping it together until now.
I'm so sorry, Lynette.
he really seemed like a good guy.
Yeah. He was a great guy.
well, we should probably get going.
Hey.
you want to ride with us to the church?
no. I still have to get ready.
so you guys go ahead.
Hey, Bree.
Oh. Please tell me you're not wearing that to the funeral.
uh, actually that's why I was coming over.
I'm not going to the funeral, so could you please tell Susan how sorry I am?
you have to be there. The whole neighborhood is going.
uh, yeah, and they'll all be thinking, "There's the woman that Mike was protecting when he beat up that loan shark."
she's the reason he's dead.
Renee...
Mike stuck his neck out for me, and now Susan's a widow, and a 9-year-old kid has to grow up without a father.
look, I know you feel awful about what happened, but today is about honoring Mike.
you do not get to make this about your guilt.
why are you looking at me like that?
because you're right, and it's annoying.
come on.
go get changed, and I will save you a seat.
Ugh. I really hate today.
me, too.
Mrs. Van de Kamp?
can I help you?
I'm detective Heredia, Fairview P. D.
Oh. Uh, if this is about Mike Delfino's murder,
I'd be happy to help, but...
as you can see, I'm on my way to his funeral.
actually, we already made an arrest in that case.
thank God.
I'm here on an unrelated matter.
it's a missing persons investigation.
Oh?
Yeah, I'd like you to come down and answer some questions.
now?
please.
as she arrived at Mike Delfino's funeral,
Gaby considered what her friend Susan must be going through.
after all, Mike was the love of Susan's life, and that got Gaby thinking about the love of hers.
so... what do you think?
a lot of things.
most of them obscene.
I like it, too!
it's royal wedding with just a hint of slut.
so... how much?
who cares? You get what you pay for, and you are getting this.
$12, 000?
we didn't even pay this much for our first house.
Yeah, well, how much can mud and straw cost?
ladies.
we are having a nice time.
now be honest, mama. Don't you like the dress?
does it only come in white?
I'm just saying, she's not fooling anybody.
well, I think she looks beautiful.
we'll take it.
no.
I will not let you spend money like that.
uh, could you give us a moment?
what are you doing?
she loves the dress, and you keep insulting it.
you just don't get it, do you, Carlos?
this is only the beginning.
you give in to her with this dress, she'll bleed you dry.
trust me. That woman is a gold digger.
hit her, Carlos. Hit her.
mama, you know I love you, but if you say one more critical thing about Gaby, don't bother coming to our wedding.
understood?
well, I guess you've made your choice.
I just hope she realizes how lucky she is.
Mm. No.
I am the lucky one.
I've never met anyone like her, and when she smiles at me, you can't put a price on it.
so I don't care if I have to work 20 hours a day to keep her happy.
I'll do it.
Carlos, sweetie, you know what would really make this dress pop is...
Oh.
no, I shouldn't.
tell me. What?
well, it's probably too much, but a pair of diamond earrings?
then our next stop is a jewelry store.
Hey. What are those stains on the living room rug?
the green is Juanita's puke, the yellow is Celia's puke, and the red is my Merlot.
since when are you drinking wine in the middle of the afternoon?
since the girls started puking in the middle of the afternoon.
your soup is coming, Juanita!
Yes, Celia, yours, too!
here. My shift is over.
no. No. No. No. No. I can't, Gaby. Not tonight.
why not? I've been with them since they got the stupid stomach flu.
I haven't slept in four days. I need a break, Carlos.
tomorrow morning, ten clients from Japan are flying in, and in order for me to win their giant account,
I have to wow them with a PowerPoint presentation that I have not even started yet.
all I hear is "blahbety-blah." Japan. Blahbety blah.
I need a massage.
Oh, my God. Not again.
every time a bell rings, an angel does not get its wings.
a child almost gets hit!
it's just endless.
if something isn't coming out of their mouths, it's coming out of their butts.
every opening is on full service.
I can't do this anymore. I'm starting to lose my mind!
okay.
okay.
go get your massage. I will take care of them tonight.
what about Japan?
this is more important.
I told you I would always take care of you.
go. Go get your massage.
Hey, girls! Daddy's home! I got your soup!
surprise taco visit.
don't get too excited. That's not a euphemism.
Hey, babe, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
what are you in the middle of? Obviously not shaving or putting on deodorant. You look like a terrorist.
can you please just come back later?
okay. I mean,
I thought it'd be nice to have lunch together, but fine.
I'll just leave these for you.
Mike?
Hey, Gaby.
so Mike gets to come visit, but not me?
Mike is just being a friend. He gets what I'm going through.
Ah, I did my own little stint in rehab.
I know how hard this can be.
right. What do I know? I'm only his wife.
Gaby. Gaby, wait.
he's a little on edge right now. Cut him some slack.
you think I came here to give him a hard time?
I just want to be here for him.
Yeah, but you being here just reminds him how he's messing everything up. He feels like he's failing you.
Oh, that's ridiculous. - Why do you think he's pushing you away?
he can't stand you seeing him like this, and frankly, I think he's a little scared.
of what?
he's always provided for you, and if you think he can't do that anymore, he's afraid you might leave him.
Mike was a good man...
and so are you.
you should quit your job.
what? But you said that...
I was wrong.
if being a counselor's gonna make you happy, then that's what you should do.
as Lynette looked at a wedding photo of Susan and Mike, she thought about the tragic end of their marriage, and that started her thinking about the beginning of her own.
Oh, I got this.
no. No. No. No. No. I got it.
Why? Cause you're the guy?
no, because I asked you out. It's only fair.
let me get it.
no. Next time.
next time?
you're asking me out on a second date?
Abso-lutely.
okay, but you should know I have a 3-date rule before I even consider sleeping with someone.
for the record, I wasn't, uh, expecting anything.
that said, if you take me out for coffee now,
I would be willing to consider that a second date.
and what if after that, I offered you half the candy bar I have in my glove compartment?
would that count as a third date?
let's have the coffee first and see how it goes, shall we?
let's get out of here.
so do we need to tell H. R. about this?
why would we?
well, I think they want to know when employees get in a relationship.
Tom, we don't have to do the whole relationship thing.
I am not one of those girls looking for a ring and kids and a house in the suburbs.
although I am kind of partial to white picket fences.
you don't think there's anybody out there who can make you change your mind?
not for the next seven years.
I have this whole plan where I become Vice President.
of the United States?
I meant the company, but we'll see.
okay. Can I look now? My back is aching, my ankles are swollen, and your hands smell like cheese.
Ta-da!
what is this?
it's your dream house.
someone already bought it.
Yeah, I did, for you.
what the hell's wrong with you?
you don't just buy someone a house.
the exception to the rule being dream houses.
no, you still should've consulted me.
this is a decision we're supposed to make together.
Oh, cramp. Oh, my foot.
here. Sit down. - Okay.
sit down.
here.
where is it? Right there? - Right there. Right there.
come on.
admit it. This is kind of nice.
Yeah, it's nice, but...
I have certain things I want in a home.
I know. Like a-a tree house for the twins to play in.
there's the perfect tree for it.
and an herb garden...
there's a great spot on the other side of the house.
and of course, your white picket fence, just like you always dreamed about.
wait. I never said anything about a white picket fence.
sure, you did. On our first date.
you said you were a sucker for a white picket fence.
there's no way I said that on our first date.
you did. I remember, because as soon as you said it,
I got this image of us sitting on our porch, watching our kids play while we drink lemonade and look out over our white picket fence.
Yeah, this does seem like a nice place.
I'm sorry I did this without you, but I knew, when I saw this house, that you would love it.
because I know you better than anyone.
here. These are yours, too. - Ah.
Thanks. Um, do you mind if I take the portable CD player?
the one I use while I'm cooking?
how else am I gonna play my CDs?
Yeah. Sure. Take it.
okay. Thanks.
How're you doing?
great. It's all the fun of a garage sale without making any money and only getting rid of stuff you really like.
why aren't you fighting harder?
it's just a CD player.
I'm talking about your marriage.
Lynette, you know me.
I hate talking about this stuff, but everybody on the street knows you and Tom are supposed to be together.
I don't know.
at this point, there's so many bad feelings,
I think time apart will help us.
it won't.
I've been through this. All right, I know how it goes.
each of you waiting for the other one to admit they were wrong, beg to be taken back.
the problem is, the whole time you're waiting, you're just growing further apart.
but you and Susan got back together.
and I kick myself every day for letting it take so long.
what I'm trying to say is, somebody's gotta make the first move.
I can't right now.
I'm too angry.
and one day you won't be.
I hope it's not too late.
for either one of you.
don't let it bother you, honey.
what?
Tom, showing up with his girlfriend.
it's fine.
I actually don't think it's gonna last that much longer.
yeah? You heard something?
no, I decided something.
Bree Van de Kamp found herself helpless in the face of a powerful man.
and this got her thinking about the ways she'd handled powerful men before and how she'd learned to do it.
Bree.
what are you making?
honey pecan pie.
it's your father's favorite.
can I help?
Pie's done, but I can teach you how to make whipped cream.
of course there's so many things I should probably teach you first.
like what?
like... how to be a woman.
that is the most important lesson I can pass down.
as the cream thickens, you whip it a little faster, okay?
don't I become a woman just by getting older?
Oh, no, Bree.
there's some things you're too young to understand, but...
I think you're old enough to learn about the mask.
the mask?
it's what my mother called it. It's the face you wear when you don't want people to know what you're feeling.
all well-brought-up women conceal their emotions.
it's very useful, especially when dealing with men.
Why?
well, if a man knows what you're thinking, it gives him power over you.
for example, if a man knows how much you love him, he'll take you for granted. He'll hurt you...
carelessly, cruelly, carelessly, cruelly, constantly.
does daddy know that you love him?
Yes. I have told him repeatedly that I cannot live without him.
if you're so upset with him, why are you making his favorite pie?
because after all of these years,
I've forgotten how to wear my mask.
so now I must do things to distract daddy.
like this pie.
when I bring it out, he'll be so excited, he won't notice the devastation in my eyes.
devastation?
Mm-hmm. It's an emotion.
the kind you might feel when your friend calls to say your husband's LeSabre was seen in the parking lot of a certain motel, next to his secretary's Bonneville.
practice your mask.
Oh, no.
honey, that's too much.
all you need is the hint of a smile.
perfect.
when an expression like that, no one will ever know what you're really thinking.
and I'll have power over men?
God, I hope so.
why are you angry?
who says I'm angry?
after all these years, you don't think I can read you?
well, if I'm such an open book, what am I angry about?
so you admit you're angry.
I admit no such thing.
you know...
this thing you're doing...
and what thing would that be?
you put on this plastic face to keep me in the dark about what you're really feeling.
and I walk around on eggshells for days, not knowing which end is up.
well, maybe I don't feel safe sharing every single thought and emotion I have with you.
hmm.
well, that's a horrible thing to say.
of course you can feel safe with me.
I'm your husband.
I love you.
please.
okay.
after dessert, you paid a certain compliment to Gabrielle.
you gotta be kidding.
it was hurtful.
to who?
to me.
you told her she was the most gorgeous woman you'd ever met.
she was a model. - I don't care.
you don't say that with your wife standing right next to you.
I'm going to bed.
now?
you wanted to know what I was feeling.
I'm feeling...
hurt and humiliated.
and I think you're dumb to feel those things.
are you coming to bed?
or are you just gonna stay down here and pout?
actually, I was just thinking about my mother...
and how insightful she was.
insightful about what?
I'll be right along.
I just want to, uh...
tidy up first.
okay.
Oh, and, Rex?
I'll be serving Belgian waffles for breakfast.
Wow.
they're my favorite.
Mm.
sorry to keep you waiting.
it's quite all right.
although I'm still a little unclear as to why you brought me here.
have you ever met a man by the name of Ramon Sanchez?
no, I don't believe I have.
Why?
he disappeared from his home a few months ago.
and we just got a tip that he's dead.
Oh, my.
you say you never met him?
Ramon Sanchez. No, that name doesn't ring a bell.
well, you see, because of this tip, someone out there is accusing you of killing Mr. Sanchez.
Oh, good heavens. That's just silly.
and as it happens,
Mr. Sanchez was found exactly where the tipster said he would be.
and was he...
dead?
Yes, ma'am.
what a shame.
because you have been identified as Mr. Sanchez's killer...
you had no choice but to bring me in for questioning.
I understand.
so I have to ask you...
did you kill him?
absolutely not.
I must say, you are hard to read.
thank you. What a lovely compliment.
you think that's a compliment?
I was raised to be composed at all times.
this is obviously a very stressful situation finding myself accused of a horrific crime.
and the fact that you would think that I'm comporting myself with a measure of grace and dignity...
well, that's a thoughtful thing to say. You're very sweet.
now do you have any other questions?
I hate to rush you, but I'm late for the funeral of a very dear friend.
hmm.
I can't think of a thing.
well, it was lovely meeting you, and I do hope you find out what happened to Mr. Sanchez.
I'm sure we will.
see? What did I tell you?
she's something all right.
I'm just not sure what we got by bringing her down here.
we got her fingerprints.
I am the resurrection and the life...
as Susan listened to the kind words the minister had to say about Mike, she found herself at a loss.
she knew people wanted to hear from her, but she had no idea what she wanted to say.
I can't believe you're making me do this.
Oh, wait. I think what you mean to say is, "Susan, sweet, wonderful Susan, "thank you for marrying me and allowing me the honor of carrying your beautiful behind inside our house.
you are so drunk right now.
no, I am not. I'm just...
Oh, I've never been this happy in my life.
I feel like I could float.
I wish you could.
Aah!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm happy, too.
that's it?
"I'm happy"?
well, that covers it.
what do you want from me? I'm not a big... word guy.
okay. Come on, mister...
strong and silent.
what?
write me a poem.
Oh, leave me alone with this stuff.
it's my wedding night, and I want a poem.
come on. Let's go.
all I remember is this thing from when I was a kid.
I'll take it.
give me my poem, husband.
I love you once.
I love you twice.
I love you more than beans and rice.
Oh.
now that is a poem. Oh.
it's really smart you guys are doing this.
when people die without a will, it can be a nightmare.
you okay, honey?
of course I'm okay.
we're about to talk about us dying for the next two days.
if it makes you feel any better, nobody enjoys this.
I'm shocked to hear that.
you got any cancer pamphlets in there?
in case we finish early.
Susan, come on. This is important.
we got the baby coming. We got the house.
I'm not saying a will isn't important.
I'm saying it's a beautiful day.
we should take a walk or something and deal with this dying stuff...
on a nice, dreary, rainy day.
um, bathroom's right there, Bob.
I don't need to use the bathroom.
or maybe I do.
okay. What is it?
we're jinxing us.
by doing this, we're telling death, "come on in."
no, it's when you don't do this that it's a jinx.
look, I'm a plumber, and it's always the people that don't have homeowner's insurance whose toilets explode.
is it what they eat?
missing my point.
no, avoiding your point.
go wash your hands.
please?
we'll do it Saturday. I promise.
look, I know it's tough, but indulge me, okay?
because if something happens, there's nothing more important to me than knowing that you and you are taken care of.
Bob, come on!
we're not paying you to go to the bathroom.
Oh, this is what I'm talking about.
none of that Kobe beef, arugula, and goat cheese nonsense.
give me good old-fashioned ground beef,
american cheese, and iceberg lettuce any day.
well, I am glad you're happy, but I am not sure that any burger is worth a half-hour drive in the car.
that's just 'cause you haven't taken a bite yet.
Juanita said Mrs. Van de Kamp's boyfriend got killed by a car.
uh, yes.
Yes, he did.
um...
and it was an accident.
it was very sad.
but you don't have to worry.
as long as we remember to look both ways before we cross the street, that'll never happen to us.
where do we go when we die?
well, you know, we go to heaven.
I know, but does everyone go?
everyone you know will go to heaven.
what about animals?
animals go to heaven, too.
what about bugs?
bugs are annoying.
we don't want bugs in heaven.
what about the animals that eat the bugs?
won't they starve?
you're right.
there are bugs in heaven.
but if all the people and all the animals and all the bugs that ever lived go to heaven, isn't it super crowded?
no, sweetie.
heaven is perfect.
how is it perfect? I mean, what's it like?
you wanna jump in here?
buddy, this is heaven.
it is?
sure. Sitting with the people you love more than anything in the world, eating a double cheeseburger and fries... It's gotta be heaven.
you know what else is heaven? - What?
that place we fish.
near the waterfall?
Yep. Heaven.
and when we watch football together and mom brings us trays of snacks.
that's heaven, too?
if heaven is supposed to be the happiest place you can be, don't all those places sound like it to you?
what are hamburgers made out of?
cause I know they're not ham.
thank you for coming to help honor Mike Delfino's life.
the family invites you to join them at the cemetery.
uh...
I changed my mind.
Hi.
I... I wasn't, uh, planning to say anything because, uh...
I had absolutely no idea what to say.
Mike and I never talked about what he wanted for a funeral.
I think it's because, um...
well, you know Mike.
he... wasn't really much of a talker.
some of you, as you came by to hug me today, you said that he's in a better place.
and you know what? I...
I realize now...
he is.
he... is in a diner...
eating cheeseburgers with his family...
and he's fishing at a waterfall...
and he's watching football with his son, yelling like a maniac.
so...
since he has to be in...
all those wonderful places...
I'm going to have to say good-bye to him now.
good-bye, Mike.
I love you once.
I love you twice.
Oh.
I love you more than beans and rice.
you know what? Mike was right.
this was the best freaking burger I've ever had in my life.
you got that right.
Susan, you haven't eaten a thing. Aren't you starving?
I... I just remembered...
it's Mike's password for his voice mail.
I have to call the cell phone company, or they're gonna charge us for an extra month.
I can do that for you.
I will call them first thing tomorrow morning.
M. J. signed... up for pitching for little league this year.
Mike was supposed to teach him.
Oh, honey, I'll send Carlos over to coach him.
I gave him two girls who hate sports, so he'll be thrilled.
Mike was always checking the tires on our car with this thingy.
I don't know where the thingy is.
I just know it was important and it kept us safe.
Hey. Hey. Tom's still taking care of our cars.
I'll just tell him to add yours to his to-do list from now on.
Oh.
Susan, we are gonna do everything we can to hold you up, okay?
okay.
Yes, as much as death takes from us, it also gives.
it teaches us what's truly important...
like giving back after a lifetime of taking...
going after something we never should have let go of...
or looking back on what made us who we are.
but sometimes the lessons learned after a person's death aren't the ones we expected.
forensics says the prints on the mug match the prints we found on the dead guy.
whole time she was dating Chuck, I never trusted her.
you think we got enough to arrest her?
probably.
let's hold off.
I wanna make sure we get enough to put this bitch away for good.
five years ago,
Susan Delfino gave birth to a son in Delivery room "a" of fairview memorial hospital.
moments later, Lila Dash gave birth to a daughter in delivery room "b."
around 10: 00 the next morning,
as the two new mothers were leaving the hospital,
they nearly ran into each other.
of course, they never knew this.
in fact,
Susan and Lila would have been surprised to know How often their paths would cross over the years.
they almost met at the local coffee shop...
and another time at their veterinarian's office...
and again in the bleachers of the fairview flyers.
but despite these close calls, Susan and Lila never met Until one tuesday,
when Susan decided to take her husband to
a fancy restaurant for their anniversary...
at the same time, Lila decided to take her daughter to buy some ice cream.
that was the night that Susan Delfino
and Lila Dash finally ran into each other.
Mike!
it will happen to all of us eventually.
the moment will come when we ask ourselves...
where did the time go?
how did the children I once cradled...
grow up so very quickly?
how did the life I dreamt of...
turn into a career I never expected?
and how did that woman I saw each day in the mirror Become someone I don't even recognize?
Juanita, this dress is awfully tight.
I don't think you can get into it.
no, it's pretty. I can do it.
how's that one fit? oh, I think we're gonna need the next size up.
uh, there is no next size up.
they don't make princess dresses for girls over 7.
she's only 4 1/2.
look, my daughter was invited to a princess party,
so I can't let her be the only girl there without a princess dress.
did you try the costume section?
I bet they'd have a mrs. Shrek dress that would fit her.
Juanita, take off the dress! we're going.
No! I can do it.
look, I feel for you.
my niece also has a weight problem.
my daughter does not have a weight problem.
she has a little baby fat, that's all.
in fact,
the only problem she has is this store being
completely unprepared for a perfectly average 4-year-old girl.
just ring it up.
no, no, no!
Oh, for god sakes. what's wrong now?
once again, the concept is, sweetie,
you're taking the pie out of the oven, your face aglow with surprise.
why am I surprised? because it turned out so perfectly.
well, that's no surprise. my pies are always perfect.
all right. it's your best pie ever.
you've topped yourself. hmm?
Mm. and I know this before I've tasted it?
sweetie, just make whatever face you want.
I just think you'll sell more cookbooks if you
don't look like you just made love to an ice cube.
Andrew, dear, I'm going to take a little break.
would you please tell this gentleman that if he calls me "sweetie"
one more time, I'm gonna grab his camera and take a picture of his colon?
you got that, right?
Katherine, hi.
what are you doing here?
the waiters need to be paid, and you took the key to the cashbox... again.
Oh. sorry. paid for what? the armenian wedding? lunch for 300?
it was right after the breakfast for the garden club,
which you also missed. look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know a photo shoot would take this long.
I mean, who knew it'd be this hard to pose for a book cover?
Oh, you'll be fine.
if there's one thing you're really good at, it's posing as a chef.
okay, katherine.
I know this book has been monopolizing my time,
and you feel overworked and undervalued.
but I do appreciate you. in fact, I have a gift for you.
it's the galleys of my new book.
read page 2.
for Katherine Mayfair-- "a wonderful cook and an even better friend.
you dedicated it to me?
well, you make this all possible.
it's the least I could do.
Ahem! excuse me.
time is money. chop-chop, sweetie.
Andrew... do we have a backup pie?
Yes. yes, we do.
good.
and the big blind...
catches a jack on the river.
Preston?
mom!
what the hell's going on here? don't freak out.
we're just playing cards. oh, yeah? why didn't you play at home?
why did you have to sneak in here?
tequila shots! 5 bucks!
asked and answered.
okay, that's it! everybody out. game's over.
can I have your chair for a second?
Hey! look up here! mom's here. party's over.
door's open. out you go. go on. shoo!
you guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts.
but this?
this?
risking our liquor license, our livelihood?
who's going to find out?
I mean, we've been running this game for a month,
and nobody-- unbelievable. you guys are grounded for two weeks.
but we have homecoming.
Yeah, yeah! keep complaining. I'd love to make it a year.
now clean this place up. now!
Wow. that was fantastic.
amazing.
Whew. you were incredible.
so were you.
time to go.
Susan?
so it's been, what, four months?
are you ever gonna let me spend the night?
I don't know. come on, zippy, zippy.
okay. it's just, you know...
girls usually beg me to spend the night.
well, good, then you shouldn't have any problem finding a place to sleep.
fine. I know the drill.
I can't spend the night. I can't meet your friends.
I can't meet your son.
I'm just wondering-- is this ever gonna turn into something normal?
you know, you're a guy, and we just had hot sex, and I didn't force you to cuddle.
so run! go! brag to your friends.
look...
I like you, and I know you like me.
so why can't we be a couple?
cause I'm... not ready for that.
and what we've got-- that's all I can handle.
go.
okay, but that's only gonna work, like, 500 or 600 more times.
good evening. can I help you?
wrong question. the question is, can I help you?
look, if you're trying to sell me something, I don't have any money.
you do now.
I don't understand.
I'm here to buy you out of your lease.
what?
I know. it's sudden.
but there's something about this house that...
well, it just feels like home to me.
so I'd like to move in... tonight.
tonight? are you crazy?
a little bit.
okay, here.
I will more than cover your moving expenses.
look, uh...I-I'm all set up here.
besides, my landlady would never allow it.
why don't you let me worry about her?
mm, no. I-I don't have anywhere else to go.
I think you should leave.
look, raymond...
how do you know my name?
I made you a very generous offer,
and I just know you're going to make the right decision.
five.
five what? what are you talking about?
four.
are you-- I don't understand.
three. o-okay. hang on for a second.
two.
well, Raymond, thank you very much.
here you go. take care.
all taken care of... mrs. Williams.
thank you... mr. Williams.
the next morning,
Edie britt decided to announce her return to Wisteria lane in a way...
that was guaranteed...
to make a big splash.
okay, you're not gonna believe this, but...
she's back.
Edie? is that really you?
you know someone else my age with a body like this?
so you're back?
what happened to your tenant?
he, uh, came into some money and decided to move.
we thought, what the heck? let's move back!
"we"?
Oh, you don't know. I have a husband now.
Really? whose?
so I'm in Vegas talking to this real estate convention.
I do a little motivational speaking.
and there-- sixth row, center aisle,
is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
so after I finish, I walk into the audience and I ask this goddess out.
his seminar was called "getting what you want,"
and he did...
three times. hmm. before dinner.
well, it's certainly nice to meet you, Dave,
and let us be the first to welcome you to Wisteria lane.
Oh, you know what? we should have a dinner or something.
Oh, let's make it a party. we could do it at my restaurant.
we'd be honored.
thank you.
so, Gaby, I have to ask.
what the hell happened to you? I mean, look at you.
your--your clothes, your--your hair.
Carlos might be blind, but the rest of us aren't.
I had two children.
for what? breakfast?
Edie? on your first day back in the neighborhood?
you're right.
I'm sorry, Gaby.
it was rude and insensitive, and it won't happen again.
Really?
okay.
now shouldn't we offer your friends something to eat?
Ooh! I baked some muffins.
please don't take this the wrong way, but...
we love you.
Mijita! lunch is ready. go get your sister.
Carlos, what's with all the cheese?
you know how Juanita feels about brussels sprouts.
I'm just trying to make vegetables more fun.
well, next time, give her a carrot and put her on a roller coaster.
have you tried to lift her lately? I know she's gotten chubby.
she'll grow out of it.
ha! we can only hope with your d. n.a. running through her veins.
Hey, I do not have fat d. n.a.
Oh, don't make me pull out the solis family photo album.
it's like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock.
I'm sorry my relatives don't measure up to
the group of stick-thin drunks that you come from.
all I'm saying is that our daughter has a weight problem,
and the sooner we admit it, the better. she's only 4.
but, you know, you want her to develop a weight problem?
go ahead. nag, criticize, make her feel self-conscious.
see what happens.
and obviously I am not getting through to the twins,
because no matter what I say, they keep pulling this crap,
and I am sick of it. honey, could you...
sorry.
Yeah. so you-- you want me to talk to them?
you have to. I am tired of being the bad cop.
you walk the beat for a while. fine.
you know, boys this age,
they're more likely to listen to their dads anyway.
I-I can handle this.
I really appreciate it.
honey, you know what I'd appreciate? could you...
sorry.
so Kirby has aces in the hole... yeah.
which means that bobby will have to wear a dress to school on monday.
Oh! oh, my! okay.
you've got to get a picture of that!
Tom? can I talk to you a sec?
don't you think you were kind of sending the wrong message in there?
I know we don't approve of what they did, but you--you gotta admit.
come on. starting their own casino is kind of creative.
yeah? "creative" like selling fake i. d.s was creative.
and hot-wiring Mccluskey's car-- that was a work of art.
honey, honey, this is nothing like that.
I mean, look, the whole school is talking about their card game.
do you realize it was, like, the place to be on a monday night?
Oh, my god.
what?
you think they're cool.
well... yeah.
no, I mean you think they're cool in that you wanna be them.
Oh, please.
you do!
this is Tom, former high school nerd,
living vicariously through his awesome-ass kids.
Hey, I was plenty cool in high school.
are we redefining "cool"
to include playing trombone in the marching band?
you're overreacting.
they're a little high-spirited, but I trust them.
so I've decided to unground them for the homecoming dance.
but I told them they couldn't go.
and you told me to handle it, and I just did.
Oh, by the way, it wasn't a trombone.
it was a tuba.
know your brass.
Juanita!
you said I could have cake.
I know, but so much?
you could've gone back for a second piece.
this is my second piece.
and it's not Juanita's fault.
in this kind of situation, I blame the parents.
look, my kid would eat sugar all day long if I let her.
Gaby's obviously one of those moms who just can't say no.
it's a shame, too. Janita has such a pretty face.
I'm back.
you want something cold?
well, actually, I'm in the mood for something hot.
you know...
this is why it's taking four months to get my house painted.
haven't you ever heard that expression, "you can have it done fast,
or you can have it done right"?
I think I'll have it done right now.
Hey, Susan?
Mm. uh, Lynette, it's not really a good time.
I just need five seconds to bitch about Tom, and then I'll-- oh, my god.
your painter isn't done yet?
Yeah. he--he's hard to keep track of.
well, anyway,
Tom refuses to acknowledge that the
twins are turning into juvenile delinquents.
just the other day, I was-- oh, you poor thing! you need a hug.
have you been drinking?
sorry to have barged in, and thanks for letting me get that off my chest.
Hey, anytime that you need to talk, you just ring my bell...
and wait.
okay, new rule.
from now on, sex only happens in the bedroom, door closed,
between the hours of 7: 00 and 10: 00 p. m. you know what?
it'd be a hell of a lot easier for me to follow the rules if
I knew why they existed. I just don't want my friends to know.
Why? you--you ashamed of me?
no, of course not.
it's just... complicated.
I'm just a simple guy, so I can't be your dirty little secret.
I need more from you.
I'm sorry. I can't give that to you.
honey, I know you wanna go home and watch your cartoons,
but you had a lot of cake, so I was thinking I'd take you to the park.
that way, you could run around and get some nice, fun exercise.
no.
you sure?
running around in the sun and fresh air would make you feel good.
Mm... no.
okay.
why don't you go throw that in the trash?
and I'm gonna get the car started.
Hey, Juanita.
you wanna play a new game on the way home?
winner gets a new doll. okay.
well, come on, then!
mommy, what are you doing?
it's a new game I invented, and you're winning 1 to nothing!
Katherine! fantastic news.
what's cookin' fairview?
is sending out a camera crew tomorrow to do a piece on me and the book.
Oh, which I just finished this morning.
you read it already? yes. I couldn't put it down.
but I have to tell you,
at least a dozen recipes are missing a pretty crucial ingredient.
Really?
what?
my name.
excuse me?
Bree, your book is filled with recipes hat we developed together,
and--and some of them are flat-out mine. oh, don't be silly.
I may have based a few on your recipes, but I always changed something.
like what? the font?
name one difference between this meatloaf recipe and mine.
well, yours calls for minced curly leaf parsley.
mine calls for minced flat leaf.
it's minced! who can tell the difference?
Bree, you have recipes in here you can't even make.
never heard anything so absurd.
the croquembouche cake with the spun sugar netting?
I've never once seen you work with molten sugar.
I always make that cake. really, Katherine.
just because I let you execute a few eye-catching garnishes that gratify
your need to show off,
doesn't mean that I can't do them just as well myself.
you let me?
I thought we were partners.
we are.
that's why your name is on the dedication page.
you were right about the dedication, Bree.
it really was the least you could do.
18 to zero!
2 more points, and you'll break the record.
mommy, I'm tired!
Really?
I thought running through that guy's sprinkler would've refreshed you.
now come on!
no.
looks like mommy's gonna score her first 2 points.
come on, Juanita.
show mommy what a winner you are.
Juanita!
what are you doing?!
Juanita, stop!
and while I thought
grounding you was an appropriate punishment,
your dad convinced me I was being a little too hard on you guys.
Absolutely.
and so we have decided to let you go to the homecoming dance tonight...
that's right!
in your father's convertible.
um, um, h-h-hold on. what? wh-- come on, Tom.
I mean, we trust them, right?
Yes, yes.
I-I would trust them more if they were driving your car.
No!
you don't want two cool kids pulling up to homecoming in a mom car,
especially with that big dent they put in it last month.
here you go.
dude! thanks! thanks!
don't thank me. thank your father. thanks, dad!
you rock! uh, you--whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! here--some ground rules.
n-no muddy shoes on my floor mats. no-- Tom, relax!
you high-spirited kids do whatever it takes to have fun.
Whoo! I'm driving it, man.
and in three, two, one.
welcome back to "what's cookin' fairview"?
we're talking with bree Van De Kamp, fairview's premier caterer,
who's about to publish her very first cookbook.
Bree, could you show us inside?
this is my kitchen, and this is my staff-- the most gifted,
hardworking team a cook could ever have hoped for.
I cannot say enough good things about them.
so which one of you has worked with Bree the longest?
that would be me.
so tell me, what's it really like working with Bree?
it's inspiring.
there is absolutely nothing she can't do.
Katherine, I'm blushing.
working with her has been...
such an education that I--aah!
Ah! oh, god. are you all right?
I think I strained my wrist. god, it hurts.
Oh, you poor dear. could someone please get some ice? oh, no.
and I was just about to put the spun
sugar netting on our famous croquembouche.
would you mind doing it?
Katherine, I'm sure your wrist is just fine.
no, it's really throbbing.
okay, it looks like Bree to the rescue.
be sure you get this.
really something to see.
the secret to spinning sugar is this
special whisk that makes lovely gossamer threads.
careful, dear.
you're clumping. I can see that.
that stuff's hot!
sorry.
so that's your idea of exercise? having her run after a car?
Carlos, our daughter sucked down half a sheet cake, and afterwards,
no one could find the candles.
wake up! we have got a problem!
I just don't think the solution is to humiliate her.
now even if she's...
heavy, doesn't she have the right to feel good about herself?
Hey, I'm protecting her. she doesn't know the truth yet.
women only have five seconds to be young and beautiful,
and then it's gone.
and then before you know it,
we're old and fat and married wondering where our beauty went.
Gaby...
no, Carlos. I mean...
sometimes I'm glad you can't see me.
five years and two kids and no time for facials or the gym.
it just... takes a toll.
and when Edie saw me the other day,
it was like she didn't even recognize me.
listen to me.
nobody knows your face better than I do.
and I see it every time I kiss you.
in 5 years or 50, you will always be beautiful.
hear me?
and now to finish,
you simply transfer your spun sugar to the
croquembouche and gracefully drape it around in a delicate swirl.
did I mention that you...
probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry while working with spun sugar?
well, there's no law that says it has to be a delicate veil.
I mean, it could really just be a beautiful, um, little, uh, white...
ribbon.
turn off the damn camera.
Ah, actually, my wrist is feeling a little better.
why don't I give it a shot?
whatcha doing?
okay, where are they? it's 30 minutes past curfew.
actually, it's 32.
if there is a single scratch on that car-- I mean,
after all the time that I spent restoring that thing...
Yeah.
remember when you spent the entire day on The internet trying to find a new gearshift knob?
worst anniversary ever.
I cannot believe that you did this to me.
I know.
that car is your baby.
if only there was something I felt that intensely about.
Oh, wait! there is-- my actual babies.
you think I don't care about our boys?
I know you love them,
but sometimes you find them so cool and entertaining,
you forget to parent them.
Lynette-- no, listen.
this is important.
when they were little and they'd act out, and we'd always say, "relax"!
they're young.
when they're older, they'll get it.
well, Tom, they're 16 now.
not getting it.
we have a lot of work to do in a very short time,
and if you and I aren't in sync,
I'm afraid it's not gonna happen.
Hey, sorry we're late. yeah. but, dad, you have to hear this story.
we just pulled up at an intersection,
and there were these two hot girls-- I don't want to hear it.
you ever hear of a thing called a cell phone?
we're only, like, 35 minutes late.
Yeah, 35 minutes,
during which time your mother and I have been worried sick.
but, dad-- you broke the rules. there are consequences.
you're both grounded for a month.
this sucks!
you're only doing this 'cause you were worried about your precious car.
you think? get out of the way.
any other opinions you'd like to share?
thank you.
but you didn't have to...
that mirror was scratched.
I already ordered a new one.
Mrs. mccluskey! you're still alive!
Oh, it's nice to see you, too, Edie.
this is my husband, Dave Williams.
so how did you two meet?
you run a free clinic or something?
I'm sorry. who are you?
Karen Mccluskey, Edie's best friend on the street.
well, it's a real pleasure to meet you.
what are you doing here?
um, I just need to talk to you.
not here. go home. I'll call you.
when?
I don't know. later. just go.
I have to say, ladies, this is quite a shindig.
Oh, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
Yeah, I mean,
there's really not a lot of people who go to
this much trouble to say they're sorry.
excuse me?
well, the party. it's just a beautiful way to apologize.
Edie, this is not a "we're sorry" party.
this is a "we forgive you" party.
you forgive me?
well, I think what Gaby means is you were fairly awful to us right before you
left, and this is our way of welcoming you back to hopefully not do it again.
you gotta be kidding.
you froze me out.
you threatened to ruin my business and you ran me out of town.
now it's taken me five years to stop hating you.
great party, ladies.
thank you very much.
now... mind if I steal my wife?
sweetheart?
isn't that your painter?
is it? I can't tell.
Ooh! excuse me. it's okay.
didn't they pay the bill?
all right. calm down. I'll take care of it.
you, come with me.
why would you humiliate me in front of my friends?
are you a lunatic?
I-I'm just trying to get through to you.
and, yeah, it's making me kinda crazy.
Susan... why can't I meet your friends?
I mean, am I really that horrible?
no, of course not. my friends would love you.
then what is the problem?
the problem is, if you meet my friends then we're in a relationship,
and I can't be in a relationship right now.
but I-I promise, I'll make you very happy.
well, maybe I don't deserve to be happy.
a few years ago...
there was this car accident...
a bad one.
take the high road?
did you hear what those smug bitches said to me?
Edie, it's important these people like us.
it's our home now.
I never should've let you talk me into moving back here.
Why? why were you so gung ho on Wisteria lane?
listen to your husband.
we can be happy here but we need these people to like us.
Why?
it'll just make everything easier.
that was an accident.
Susan, you can't feel guilty about it.
you know what, Jackson?
you're not gonna say anything
I haven't already heard a million times.
I-I only told you because I...
I just want you to understand why I can't let you in my life.
do you mind if I hang out for the next Few months and see if you change your mind?
Yeah, I guess I could handle that.
well, why don't you...
go have fun with your friends?
and just call me when you're free.
please, Danielle. you have no right to take him.
I have every right. he's my kid.
Danielle, we agreed I would raise him.
we agreed it would be best!
you said it would be best! I've had no say in anything!
but I am married now, and Leo's a lawyer.
so do yourself a favor and don't try to fight this!
please, Danielle, we can have any arrangement you like.
please, just don't take him!
for god sakes, Orson's gone.
you kids are grown. Benjamin's all I have!
you're just gonna have to find something else.
honey, come to bed. it's after 2: 00.
the cooking show agreed to redo my segment.
I wanna make sure it's perfect this time.
well, I won't tell you how to run your business.
it's your baby.
Yes, it is.
Hey. um, m. j. ready?
Yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you.
I told you the brakes were squeaking.
I asked you to get them checked. - and I checked 'em!
I meant a mechanic...
not you. it was not the brakes, Susan.
if it had been, it wouldn't have mattered.
they crashed into us! - and we killed them, Mike!
we didn't kill them! they died.
they were a mother and a child.
she was a mother, just like me...
with a child just like ours.
and if it weren't for us, they would still be alive.
Yeah, we have been over and over this, Susan.
it's--it's like you want to suffer.
it's like you don't care at all, like you feel nothing for those people.
I can't do this again! I just can't!
did you pack your dinosaur book so you can read it with your daddy?
sure did.
Oh, good. mmm.
okay, you have fun, sweetie.
so, um, I'll probably bring him back sunday around 6: 00 or so.
fine.
well, have a good weekend. doing anything special?
well, I've sort of started seeing someone.
so I might do something with him.
good for you.
it goes by so quickly.
in a flash, the life we knew is gone forever.
and we're left to ask ourselves...
how could he have left me?
when did my beauty start to fade?
why has my friend changed?
was I the best mother I could have been?
of course, there are some people who understand how quickly time passes.
that's why they're so determined to
get what they want before it's too late.
Oh, dr. Heller. I've been meaning to call you.
Yeah, I was getting concerned.
you're required to check in once a month.
it was a condition of your release.
Oh, come on. that was a year ago.
but to be honest, the meds are working so well,
I kinda forgot about you.
no offense.
Dave, once a month. not optional.
message received, doc.
but seriously, you don't need to worry about me. I'm great.
I'll talk to you in a month.
just tell me.
what are the magic words that I've gotta say so you will - Let me out of here? - Dave, you've been here six weeks, and
you don't seem any closer to coming to terms with your rage.
I've come to terms with it, and I like it just the way it is.
the charges were dropped because you
agreed to put yourself in a doctor's care.
I'm not going to authorize your release until I see some real progress.
Wh-what's progress supposed to look like to you, doc?
I mean,
should I just plaster some fake smile on my face and
pretend this--this thing that's inside me isn't eatin' me alive?
cause I can do that if you want.
I need to make sure you're not a danger to yourself or to others.
listen, I've never been a danger to myself.
and as far as the others are concerned,
there's only one person who should be worried.
so if you or that skinny bitch try to screw with what's mine,
I swear to god, I don't carewho I have to hurt.
let's face it, Paul. You've got a problem.
it's time for you to go away.
it's Paul.
he violated Florida'sthree-strikes law.
the cops picked him uptotally strung out on heroin.
he's back in jail.
holy shit! They're fucking fingertips.
he started getting all roughwith me until he saw this.
then what?
then he changed his tune, got all turned on.
told meto take my fake hand off.
he takes all my nail polish and paints each naila different color.
menthol? Like cough drops.
I could hear them clickingagainst his teeth when he...
son of a bitch loved those fucking lozenges.
I was confused because I love you.
what did you say?
I love you.
I love you, too.
what? What happened to your lip?
Aah!
no, it's -- I had an incidentwith a tool at the workshop.
Ohh!
I need an ambulanceat 1228 calendar street. A guy's been stabbed.
truth BE TOLD
I've never had much use for the concept of hell, but if hell exists, I'm in it.
the same images running through my head over and over.
I was there.
I saw my mother's death.
a buried memory, forgotten all these years.
it climbed inside me that day.
and it's been with me ever since
my dark passenger.
you should be focusing on me, socio.
you should be focusing on me, socio.
seriously want to get the motherfucker that did this to batista.
Hey. You all right?
Yeah. I'm okay.
I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.
how's he doing? Do we know?
still in surgery.
LaGuerta's there.
God, I hate feeling so helpless.
what, no jokes about providinggross sexual comfort in a time of crisis?
our friend was stabbed...
and he might die.
officer Morgan.
what do you think, Dex?
he put up a fight. There was a struggle.
attaboy, Angel.
here, this trail --steady stream of drops.
he had a few seconds. Tried to move away until
till he fell.
so much blood.
what's happening to me?
no way.
you're the oneI'm supposed to meet.
in the flesh.
you know, I was just talkingto someone about you.
that tickles.
don't stop.
I wouldn't dream of stopping.
you're so different this time -- gentle.
I thought you were gonna try and get all pervy with my stump again.
actually, your...imperfection is what saved youthe first time.
saved me from what?
true artistry.
the message of my workis not in the product itself, but ratherthe presentation.
that wrinkled fleshon your radial carpal joint is far from perfect.
it's quite unsightly, actually.
Hey, you don't have to bean asshole about it.
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, sh
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend.
truthfully...
I'm thankful for you.
you're my escape plan.
escape from what?
the police.
because of you, I've hadto speed up my project.
I need somethingt o distract them by.
and I always found a freshly chopped-up body always does the trick.
wait, wait! No!
don't struggle. That never helps.
I'm compressingyour carotid artery, and that is cutting offoxygen to your brain.
in about 10 seconds, you'll be unconscious.
Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.
okay, I guess you went to bed.
or you fell asleep on the couch watching "xena" reruns, which I still thinkmakes you a dork.
either way, call me when you get this, okay?
miss you.
he's still in surgery, but I don't know when we'll hear anything.
so I guess you won't becoming over tonight.
no. I mean, I can'T.
I understand. You need to be there for your friend.
I haven't told the kids yet.
told them about Angel?
no, about Paul...being back in prison?
I hate breaking their hearts. They think so much of their dad now, and
right.
you know what?
focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.
Thanks.
they're actually coming outright now. I got to go.
angel sustainedsevere internal injuries.
he lost a lot of blood.
but...the surgerywas successful.
it looks like our boy'sout of the woods.
I know I should stay, be a part of the group hug.
but I can't focus.
I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.
I need to know what it means.
what the fuckis wrong with you?
I have some place I have to be.
well, we all gotsomeplace to be.
but you just found out that somebody who was supposedto be your friend is gonna live.
does that make you feel anything?
anything at all?
take your fucking hand off me.
just what I always thought.
right.
deck the hallswith parts of bodies la-da-da-da dum
shit. Just what I need.
Hey.
I know it's late.
I guess you didn't get my message.
I drove by and saw your car.
I can go.
get your ass in here.
it's about time you see where I live anyway.
Oh, you have no idea how much I needed this. You feel good.
and cold --you're freezing.
well, then stayand keep me warm.
this batista thinghas gotten to you, hasn't it?
angel's daughter was there.
that's got to be rough.
daughter of a cop --just like you.
Yeah.
I rememberwhat that's like -- kissing your father goodbye, always afraid it's for the last time.
hey...
let's get out of townfor the weekend
just the two of us.
we need to talk.
I'm sitting right here.
Nope.
the timehas got to be right.
okay.
it'll have to wait...
at least till we catch the asshole who did this to batista.
let me warn you --I can be very persistent.
I need to get out of town, and I need you to come with me.
what I need is sleep, which is not gonna be easy.
I'm totally wired from all this shit.
well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.
my loving arms.
and...I got a little thingto help you sleep.
that ain'tno little thing.
I meant valium.
it's one of the perksworking at the hospital.
wine and valium?
I'll be totally helpless.
you read my mind.
well, as I live and breathe.
you miss me?
you and the bear clawsyou're hiding behind your back.
this must be important.
haven't seen much of you lately.
no rest for the wicked.
how's Gene?
good days and bad.
he just finished his first round of radiation.
well, he's a good guy.
not much of a bridge player, though.
Harry and Gene used to get so mad every time Doris and Iwould take them to the cleaners.
I was hoping you could dig upan old case file for me.
well, sure thing. Got a date?
uh, not exactly.
it's the crime scenewhere Harry found me.
uh...I wish I could help, but...
everything from that long ago is boxed up in the basementat city hall.
And...as you can see,
I'm up to my you-know-what in year-end reports, so...
it's my lieutenant.
camilla, is there anything you remember?
what I remember, Dexter Morgan, is your father caring enough to bring you into his homeand give you a loving family.
I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.
who found the body parts?
I did. They were left under the tree.
I thought it was the crew from last night just messing around...till I found the head.
I told himnot to touch anything, but he never listens.
God, Patty, you're such a bitch.
did you guys see anything out of the ordinary fore you found the body?
there were some broken ornaments by the tree.
who could do something like this so close to christmas?
the Grinch.
Oh, you're a fucking riot, Max!
like anyone's gonna go shopping down here after this. There go our jobs.
thank you for your cooperation.
Oh, sucks to be an elf.
get some visual surveillance.
I got here as fast as I could. What are we looking at?
female victim cut up into pieces.
the ice-truck killer? So soon?
Yep, and after the blood bath at the hotel, can't wait to see how the captain's gonna handle the presson this one.
James, I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.
and will somebody turn offt his god damn snow machine?!
your sister can help you out.
that a whole sexual-tension thing or am I missing something?
it's the same number she left at Marina view hotel.
any leads as to what they mean?
we've talked to numerologists, mathematicians, code breakers -- nothing. They need more to go on.
first he turns my whole world inside out with a carnival of blood.
now he leaves me this
a calming oasis in the desert of my confusion.
it doesn't make sense.
crime scene's wiped clean.
another hooker?
ho, ho, ho --another dead ho.
somebody's been naughty.
Hey, Morgan, want to sit on my lap when we're done and tell me what you want for christmas?
and he's back. No, thanks.
last thing on my wish list is a burning sensation when I pee.
this doesn't seem right.
body parts scattered among the presents. Broken ornaments.
it's not his usual meticulous style.
it seems rushed...
haphazard.
that would explain why we can't find one of the hands.
what's wrong?
there's something underneath the torso.
merry christmas, Miami.
after all this time, why do you think the ice-truck killer has struck again?
any answer at this time would be pure speculation on my part.
do you think it has any connection with your department's handling of the Neil Perry fiasco?
sir?
you've arrested the wrong man.
may the world think I'm a rank amateur, and I'm very, very angry to answer for your mistakes.
stop the tape.
what are you doing?
look at her tears. They're rolling up.
Oh, my god.
bastard's got her up side down.
that's how he bleeds them out. He strings them up like meat. It was me.
no, please, no
all right, turn it off.
I'll have the tape sent to the station for analysis.
sergeant Doakes, you're on point.
with all due respect, sir, lieutenant Laguerta's in chargeof this investigation.
not anymore.
the fact is we haven't been ableto catch this guy, and now he's rubbing our noses in it.
we've got to come up with some fresh ideas.
this is some bull shit. I'll go talk to him.
no, no, no. Do as he says.
the commissioner has his assin a sling.
he's up for review. Word is he's getting the boot.
so you're just gonna sit backand take this?
well, if it means being seen as his worthy successor...
I'll be at the hospital.
all right, P.B. And J. Inside, cut diagonally, not straight across.
tastes better that way.
has dad said if he's coming overchristmas eve or christmas morning?
I miss him.
well, I'm -- I'm afraid your dad's not gonna make it this year for the holidays.
where is he?
well, uh...he's
he's back in jail, isn't he?
look, I know he wantedto say goodbye, but there wasn't any time.
he loves you guys so much.
I forgot my math book.
I'm -- I'm sure he'd love to hear from you. We could write him a letter.
it's all your fault.
you could at least pretend you want to be here.
you're the one who had the urgent need for tacos.
Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.
he's been acting weird lately.
last night he said we need to talk.
well, that's never good.
well, thanks. I feel a lot better. I've only been obsessing about this all day.
think you could talk to him for me?
Oh, look, it's Rudy.
I sort of called him.
Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.
apparently she's had a lot on her mind.
Oh, shit.
that's work. I have to go.
here, take mine. Sorry.
what's with your lip? Deb catch you with a right hook?
she can be pretty protective with the remote.
I had a little workshop accident this morning.
doesn't look like it happened this morning. The cut's already closing up.
Oh, did I sa--I meant yesterday morning. I think I'm working too hard.
anyway, I don't think my lip is why Deb arranged this little chitchat.
my sister is afraid there may be trouble in paradise.
your sister's wrong.
so this whole"need to talk" thing?
I'm starting to look at the big picture.
she's someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with, you know?
no, I don't know.
but I do know that Deb's falling for you...hard.
you hurt her... - and you'll hurt me.
something like that.
okay?
I'm tired of hearingyou two gallinas cluck.
Hey, you.
you had us so worried.
if I'd have known that this would get you back in the same room with me,
I would have got ten stabbed sooner.
I'm gonna get the doctor.
no, no, no. What are you doing? No, dejalo.
the doctor said you're lucky to be alive and still have a liver.
well, that's why I got two, right?
it's a good thing you decided to be a cop.
tell me that you caught the cock sucker that ruined one of my best shirts.
we don't have any leads. Did you see anything?
no.
he was behind me.
I just felt the blade go in.
it happened so fast.
how long has Nina been here?
she was the first oneat the hospital.
she's been with you the whole time. Yo no sé porque, pero...
my mother was murdered before my eyes.
makes sense I'd choose a life where I search for meaning in blood.
the sole memory I have of her is being covered in it.
I need to know more details.
I hope that look means you found something on Batista's shirt.
you should see this.
that's what I drove all the way back from the hospital for?
this drop of blood doesn't match the wound pattern or the spatter from the restof Batista's shirt, and look where it is -- on the inside of the back collar.
you think it's the attacker's blood?
we know Batista fought back.
well, run the dna.
if this guy's got priors, we'll get a hit on the database.
already sent a sampleto the lab.
sorry to hear, you know, about Matthews taking you off the case.
last gasp of a desperate man.
things are gonna change around here.
and I won't forget your help.
and I'm very, very angry.
Oh, god, no! No, please!
I can't watch this again.
I know it's tough, but just keep your eyes on the monitor.
wait -- what was that?
the camera tilts up right before he hits the off switch.
watch.
that, my friends, is a monster refrigeration unit.
he needs it cold to preserve the bodies.
but check this out.
look how much space there is between her feet and the ceiling.
this room is bigger than your standard commercial freezer.
most likely it was a custom build.
so we should focus our searchon commercial districts.
no. Residential.
you think he built this in his own place?
he picks up hookers, right? I worked vice.
the smart girls know not to gonear a factory or a warehouse unless you neverwant to be seen again.
how do we know he didn't knock out his victims or drug them, then take them back to a warehouse?
none of the other victims showed any signs of head injury or narcotics.
besides, what better way to trap a victim than to get her to walk into your own home?
the escort service said she was meeting her client at the corner of brickell avenueand coral way.
and her body was found at santa's cottage, which is on Biscayne mall.
we'll map out grids.
we'll focus onprivate residences drawing large amounts of power near those areas.
catch a break...
we'll catch this son of a bitch.
where the hell are you going?
I need to do some research on a case.
you were supposed to call meafter your lunch with Rudy. I've been freaking out.
he sent me this text message.
"Cum sail away with me?" He misspelled "come."
Dexter, this is no time to joke. This is good, right? A romantic weekend?
what did he say to you?
Oh, wait, no. Don'T. Don't tell me.
maybe he wants it to be a surprise.
unless I should know. Should I know?
okay, tell me. You know, no. Don'T.
we need to talk? Who says that unless you're getting dumped?
I don't think that's what this is about.
he probably wants me out on the water in case I make a scene.
you know, I always do this. I put myself out there. I set myself up to get hurt.
he wants to bepart of the family.
what?
wait. Like...propose?
I have to get to the librarybefore it closes, but we'll talkabout this later, okay?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
I was never one to dwell on my past, always content to leave it a mystery.
no details -- just a blur of images rushing by.
but my friend out there wants to bring those memories into focus.
so do I.
this is it for the metro newsfor 1972 through 1973.
the tribune's archives...
shipping YARD MASSACH 10/3?
1-0-3 -- same as the hotel, same as santa's cottage.
this is what he wanted me to find all along.
small TIME CRIMINALS VICTITM OF MASSACRE
Dexter, close your eyes.
don't look.
my mother.
no wonder I felt so disconnected my entire life.
if I did have emotions, I'd have to feel...
this.
october 3, 1973.
Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.
apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.
first officer on scene was Harry Morgan.
you've been busy.
a crime that big and yet there's no record ofthe case file at city hall.
that seems a bit odd.
it's a long time ago.
what is in that report that Harry didn't want me to see?!
why was there no mention in any of the newspapers about a 3-year-old boy at the crime scene?!
damn it, I need to know. I need that file.
I can't give you the file'cause it no longer exists.
I destroyed it the day your adoption went through.
you did what?
made a promise to your father.
why, to protect him?
to protect you.
Harry had a code. He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.
your father was a decent man and an honest cop, but what he saw in that cargo container changed him.
you were left there for days, starving, in blood 2 inches thick.
Yeah. - Dex, Cody's run away!
are you sure? - Yeah, I've looked everywhere.
well, call the police. I'll be right there.
I need to know the truth.
kid...
leave this one alone.
I-I-I can't sit here like this. I should be out there doing something.
Rita, the police said you need to stay here in case cody comes home.
the neighbors are helping. We'll find him.
Yeah, but one squad carfor all of Miami?
what if some crazy person picked him up off the street?
it's all my fault.
honey, what are you talking about?
I should have heard Cody get out of bed.
I'm his big sister.
Hey. Hey, look at me.
it's not your fault, okay?
okay?
could you go get Dexter some water?
I should have seen this coming.
Cody was so upset with me when I told him that Paul was back in jail.
today's thursday, right? - Yeah.
I think I know where Cody might be.
Hey.
need a push?
today's the day you meet daddy in the park, huh?
he'll be here.
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry, but he's not coming back
not for a long time.
look, we'll talk about thiswhen we get home, okay?
after all the lies Harry left for me to uncover, I'd love to run away, too.
he won't even look at me.
I'm not the one in jail, and yet I'm still the bad guy.
well, you didn't tell themthe truth... about their father.
I told them Paul was back in jail.
well, right, you told them where he is, but you didn't tell them o he is.
he's still the same drug-using, wife-beating redneck he always was.
they should hear that.
you're not a parent. You don't understand.
you do anything to protect your kids.
Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them. You're protecting Paul.
well, I --I got to get them home.
somebody's in a good mood.
the commissioner and the review board did not look happy this morning.
they've been in Matthews' office for two hours.
you thinking his ass is about three shades of red right now?
I don't care what color it is as long as it's on its way out the door.
tell me that did not just happen.
it's who you know and who you blow.
probably picking their fucking tee time.
Maria, watch your back. He's gonna be gunning for you now more than ever.
let him try.
my man Juan, hook it up.
they didn't have road and track so...
that better bea bag of applesauce.
okay, Juan, at this point, you should go save yourself. Go.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
two double-meats?
a man's got to eat.
you're so cute when you're annoyed. You know, your mouth makes those little o'S.
God damn it, Angel, do I look like I'm beingfucking cute with you?
well, not now you don't, no.
why do you always do this
make light of thingsthat matter?
okay, I'm sorry. Okay?
when I come home, I'll eat anything you want.
no jokes, no complaining --I promise.
when you come home?
I thought the way things are going with us...
I thought you'd forgiven me.
well, of course I forgive you.
I forgive you a long time ago.
okay, so let's fix this.
this could be a second chance for us.
what?
look, you did what you did.
it was hard.
but it got us to face the truth.
we were miserable...for years.
do you really want to survive this and go right back to being unhappy?
maybe.
what if I do?
look, you will always be Jorge's father.
I will always care about you.
I'll always be here for you.
but our marriage is over.
why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.
Maria...let's you and me have a talk.
congratulations on the review. I hear it went well.
you must be thrilled. But now, if you don't mind
let me get right to the point.
all our mishaps these last few months
failure to bring in the ice-truck killer, mishandling of Tony Tucci......
even Neil Perry
Neil Perry was your fuck-up...not mine.
they're all the result of a bad command structure, and that's my failure.
well...
I'm glad to hear you say that.
takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.
so this morning, the commissioner gave me the go-ahead to restructure the division.
effective immediately, you will no longer serveas my lieutenant.
I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.
please, it's ridiculous.
you really don't want to do this.
because of your status in the Cuban community.
I'm a fucking hero to this community. You think they're just gonna accept it?
your replacement has already been selected.
her name is Esmé Pascal, a transfer from fort Lauderdale -- a real up-and-comer.
Pascal, the Haitian-American?
the one who got shot last year in the line of duty.
Mm-hmm. Turns out she's an actual hero.
you think I'm gonna stay quiet for this, you're out of your mind.
I did warn you, Maria.
I'm gonna need you to clear out this office tonight.
expect a call from my union rep.
you'll always have a place in the bullpen
and my fucking lawyer, too!
...with all the otherdetectives. - This isn't fucking over, Tom!
you god damn... Son of a bitch!
Oh, you got to bekidding me.
how are you?
how the hell do I look?
I can barely remember how I got here.
look, there's something we need to discuss.
if you came for an apology, you wasted a tank of gas.
sit. I'm not finished.
fuck you.
Astor and Cody are in the other room.
Jesus, you brought them here?
look, I know this will be difficult, but I need you to explain to them why you're in this place.
I have no fucking idea why I'm in this place.
fine. Fine. You want to be in denial? Go ahead.
you will never seey our kids again.
wait, wait, wait, wait. Rita, wait, wait.
I fought so hard to win those kids back, especially Astor. If they see me here like this, I'm gonn lose them forever.
Paul, the one good thing that came out of our marriage are those kids.
and I know you love them.
but if you want to have any kind of real relationship with them, it has to be with the father they have, not the father they wish they had.
now, you cheated on me.
you broke my heart, you broke my bones, and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.
but I am giving you the chance to make it all right.
not for me, but for them.
I-I-I...I wouldn't know what to say.
tell them you're paying for your mistakes.
it's a valuable lesson.
it's one you never got.
so what's it gonna be?
okay.
daddy! Daddy, daddy!
Hey!
all right, this won't take long.
there was a drop of blood on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours, so I need to chec kthe back of your head.
just so long as it's only my head you're checking back there, bro.
how are things with you and Rita?
not so good, actually. We kind of...had words.
I think I really upset her.
Oh, that's rough, man.
maybe I'm not the right person for her. Some people are meant to be alone, right?
Dex, socio, alone sucks.
Ihijo de puta! - Sorry.
these are teeth marks.
you definitely wounded this guy. - Good.
I hope I broke his fucking nose...
or at least gave him a fat lip.
angel, have you ever met Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?
Yeah. I went by his office a couple of days ago.
nice guy. Why?
at lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt his lip that morning.
he was lying, and I was too distracted to care.
but he's got my full attention now.
Hey, you here tonight?
Yeah, we're tits-deepin the ice-truck killer. Might be onto something. It's gonna be an all-nighter.
so that text message you got from Rudy about going away wh him --you're not gonna do that?
tragically, no.
I was all psyched to meet him at the miami beach Marina, but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.
good.
I'm working on a theory that Rudy was gonna propose, and now he can't --why is that good?
no, I meant good that you're making progress here.
Yeah. We're getting closer.
fingers crossed.
at least I know my sister is safe tonight, which gives me time to check out my own theory on Rudy.
we've defined the area for the residential search.
good. So we'll start canvassing tonight. You take the
that him?
Yeah, how'd you know?
cause you got that stupid-assgrin on your face again.
go ahead. Answer it.
Hey.
Hey, supercop, what's the word?
I'm kind of in a thing right now.
got it. I'll be quick. You never answered my text.
do I have the pleasure of your company this weekend?
uh, yeah, about that
come on, Deb, it's only two days.
I know, I know. It's just we've had a major break in the ice-truck-killer case.
I promise, as soon as we catch this douche bag, you and I are gonna spend a whole week together in bed.
you are not gonna be able to get rid of me.
okay, okay, but how about dinner?
Oh, my god, you are persistent.
well, you got to eat, right? So why not eat dinner with me...
on this yacht I'm on?
where the hell did you get a yacht?
I rented it.
I thought we'd have a nice couple days together, but we could still have a nice night.
and there is that thing we need to talk about.
okay, well, maybe I can take an hour for dinner.
I can work with an hour.
I mean, a real hour, not one of your "let's stretch this outtill 2: 00 A. M."
you might as well stayand have sex" hours.
right. Real hour.
no fakey hour. Got it.
all right, I'll get out of hereas fast as I can.
I'll see you soon.
thinking Rudy attacked Batista doesn't make any sense. He's a loving boyfriend.
he spends his life helping people in need.
he brought me steaks.
well, that's just rude.
why would loving and helpful Rudy need an industrial-grade lock...
and a security camera?
how do I get his dna now?
at times like this, I wish the truth was more easily accessible, unless
right.
but Harry taught me to trust my gut.
"people lie all the time," he said.
but your instinct will never fail you.
some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?
fuck me!
I believe your rule specifically prohibits such action.
did you do all this?
in fact, I did.
you like?
I like.
I like so much that it makes what I have to tell you that much harder.
Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.
I'm sorry. I hit traffic. It took me 30 minutesto get here.
I have to turn around and go right back.
Oh, my god. Hold on. Hold on. Wait.
well, you're sort offorcing my hand here.
I wanted to wait until we were out in the water, but...
here goes.
I know this seems fast...
but I feel
I feel that I waited my wholeentire life for you.
and now that you're here,
I don't want you to leave.
will you marry me?
I knew it! I fucking knew it!
is that your version of a "yes"?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but
no, no, no! Stop at "yes." Yes, I like that part.
Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?
like, let me savor this. I want to be with you.
I want to enjoy it, you know? So it's a "yes," but
okay, I get it. You do?
no, not really, but I can work with it.
good, good.
Oh, god, I can still wearthe ring, right?
Yes, but...there's a condition.
I know you have to go to work, but...
if you're gonna wear the ring, we need to celebrate.
one glass of champagne --that's all I ask.
Rudy, I -- - I mean it.
you can't leave yoursort-of fiancé on a yacht with a cold meal and an unopenedbottle of champagne. It's kind of cruel.
just one glass of champagne...to celebrate.
and then you can go back, saving Miami from the ice-truck killer.
I can live with that.
Hey, I need these two tested against each other. It's kind of a rush.
excuse me, hi.
Hey, these two -- tested againsteach other right now.
okay.
it's Deb. Do it.
Hey, I know you're working, but let me know when you come up for air.
I need to talk to you. I'm in the building.
this yacht's amazing.
I didn't know you went for stuff like this.
well, you have a whole lot to learn about me.
was that just the phone ringing?
yeah -- big brother. I let it go to voice mail. He can wait till we're done here.
good. I want you all to myself.
So...let the toasting begin.
To...what comes next.
you're not drinking.
tastes like menthol, which, it turns out, is not that sexy.
what's the matter? - Nothing.
just bad memories.
Oh. That's right. That was the
the one clue the ice-truckkiller left behind, right?
right.
wait. How did you know that?
I don't often make mistakes, but when I do, they haunt me.
hilarious.
your champagne's gonna get warm.
you know the one thingI've been dying to ask you?
how did you not know who I was?
you're a cop.
this isn't funny.
I think a real cop would, um, at least have a sense that she was in the presence of the person she was hunting, right?
you're hurting me.
I'm didn't show you the best part of my loft. Built it myself.
stop it!
the refrigerated room.
Oh, god, why are you doing this?!
you know, the tricky part was getting you on the boat.
the other women I could just pay.
but at the end...you made it easy.
so desperate to fall in love.
stop.
dude, you got to see this.
the autopsy on our santa's cottage victim? Check it out.
one arm was shorter than the other. So that got me thinking.
I mean, our guy isn't sloppy. He's precise.
not now, Vince.
dude, her left wrist was2 inches shorter than her right.
I mean, why cut off moreon the left side than the right?
because our girl...
our girl was a fucking amputee.
I looked up her medical records.
she had a fake left hand. That's why we couldn't find it.
the killer cut off that extra piece of wrist so that we wouldn't see the stump.
let me see that.
that night Batista was stabbed, he was following upon a lead he got from a one-handed call girl.
guess what the lead was about.
the ice-truck killer.
Booyah.
you sure?
positive. The samples you gave me were a match. They're from the se person.
Hey, you all right?
Where's my sister?
took her code 12. Left about an hour ago.
she wasn't supposed to go anywhere.
dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan. I need you to raise officer Debra Morgan on her radio.
sorry, sir. She's been out of range for the last half-hour.
it's Deb. Do it.
where the fuck are you? I'm here at work, and you're not. I need to talk to you.
do not see Rudy until you find me.
call me when you get this.
if you were the Bay Harbor Butcher ,
would you use a place like this?
the conditions in this space don't support his m. O.
maybe the butcher's having an identity crisis.
your brother's a junkie.
are you high? He's never even smoked a cigarette.
looks like Cody 's enjoying himself.
Dexter's very patient with him.
Dexter's a saint.
I hope you could dig up a case file for me got a date?
it's the crime scene when Harry found me
I've been waiting for a chance to take your ass out.
I know how you feel, sergeant.
he crossed the line, lieutenant.
he broke into my lab.
he's probably gonna start tailing me again.
sergeant Doakes tailed you?
I followed him to an n. a. Meeting.
that asshole lied about that, too.
you're obsessed. I'm not.
and I need you to see it!
dinner was fantastic, Rita . Wow.
I kind of like her.
Dex, just calling to check in.
imagine Rita 's face if I told her
that you and I had spent the night together in a hotel.
it's over, Dexter .
I guess I just hope with Lundy it will be different.
Why? I respect him.
you love him.
no. He's like my dad.
you want to tell me what's going on?
you're the one who said I'm supposed to feel my feelings!
well, now I'm telling you to get them under control!
which step was that?
that night, a forest grew
use the entire canvas.
start from the top. Work your way down.
light, feathery strokes.
perfect!
stunning.
try longer strokes now.
perfect.
you really know what you want, don't you?
I hope you don't mind.
some men do.
no.
I've always found instruction manuals...
quite useful.
okay, your turn.
what do you want?
I think that was it.
hmm, come on.
you must have some dark fantasies...
...unfulfilled urges.
I'm pretty good at acting on those.
Really?
then fuck me like that.
your light's burned out.
it's the wiring.
I've been asking my landlord to fix it for weeks.
well, now I can see better.
that's where my landlord lives.
now he'll have to fix it.
see you later.
got to admire Lila for taking things into her own hands.
that includes me.
Ohh. Mom.
come on, let's go! No more moping.
I'm not moping. I'm sleeping.
oversleeping -- third time this week.
the only way you're gonna get over Dexter
is if you take charge of your day.
come on. You're not in high school anymore.
go scrub your face, and I'll heat up some oatmeal.
didn't hear you come in last night.
well, it was late. I was quiet.
Yeah, you're good at quiet.
guess you kind of have to be with me crashing here
and Rita 's mom over there.
you and Rita fuck quiet, too?
and she's off, right out of the gate.
because me -- I wake the goddamn dead.
it's a problem.
Oh, I know, only too well.
scary, right?
sometimes I disturb myself.
so what kind of noises does Rita make?
could we not talk about sex...
or Rita ?
Why?
cause we broke up...
for real.
it's over.
you break up, you get back together
that's just what goes on.
I mean, you and Rita are forever.
just say you're sorry and send some fucking flowers.
you're not hearing me.
look, when all this blows over,
I'll spend a few days at Gabriel 's, and...
you can screw Rita as loud as you want.
big news, Dex .
Whoa! Feel like I got caught in a wave.
the miamI tribune received a 32-page manifesto in the mail.
it's looking good for the Bay Harbor Butcher .
well, I've heard that one before.
look, this may be legit.
the manifesto includes the names of three victims
we never released to the press.
Oh, that is big news.
I'm heading over to the tribune now for special agent Lundy.
he put me in charge of the team.
go, Angel .
Yeah, I'm psyched.
Yeah, me too. I'm about to be published.
I sent that manifesto to the tribune.
guess I've been taking some cues from Lila lately,
and not just in bed.
I'm tired of reacting to the moves of agent Lundy and his super posse.
time to control their actions for a change.
Betsy court, 16. Blunt-force beating.
it looks like she was sunning herself
and never saw it coming.
who called in the body?
Craig Wilson , the stepfather. He's right over there.
Wilson told the reporting officer
that he came home for lunch and found her that way.
um, you and Dexter resolve your issues?
as far as I'm concerned.
Why? The bitch come crying to you again?
no.
there's blood work to be done here,
and if you can't control yourself,
I need to call in another detective.
I won't say anything to hurt the little girl's feelings.
God damn it, James , I'm not joking.
do I look like I'm laughing?
no. You don't. I wish you would. You used to.
bullshit. I never laughed.
Yeah, you know what? You're probably right.
now, look, I'm not gonna try to scare you anymore.
the reality is, you're out of free passes.
now, I already stopped Dexter from filing a complaint against you once.
I never asked you to do that, Maria . well, I did it,
out of my own concern over your obsessive behavior.
now I'm on the line,
so if you bully Dexter in any way
if you even look at him wrong,
I will not be responsible for the fallout.
you got it?
I got it.
you're backing the fucking freaktard.
James.
where you been, Dexter ?
you don't bring me doughnuts.
you don't sing me love songs. How are you, Camilla ?
I've been better.
well, that doesn't sound good.
sergeant Doakes dropped by my file room yesterday.
he requested the case files
for the 1973 shipping-yard murders.
I gave him the same line I gave you when you came sniffing around,
said all that old stuff was boxed up
in the basement of city hall.
that made him real angry.
he scared me, Dexter .
that's not right. He shouldn't do that.
look, Dex , I always assumed that your father asked me to destroy those files to protect you.
now I'm not sure what's going on.
Camilla...
now, I don't want to know.
I just don't want to get fired.
I'm retiring next year. Did I tell you?
I've been looking forward to staying home with Gene .
you won't lose your retirement. I won't let that happen.
I can stall sergeant Doakes for a few days,
but eventually, he'll figure out
that that case file's missing, just like you did.
and he'll track it back to me, you know, just like you did.
I'll take care of this. You have my word.
so much for threatening Doakes .
he won't back off till he exposes the twisted branches of my family tree,
from my father's indiscretions to my murderous brother
to the root of all evil -- me.
why aren't you at the tribune?
what for?
our guy's not gonna leave DNA evidence on a document.
Oh, but the thrill of the hunt.
I've had that particular thrill.
I'll leave it to younger men.
besides, it's easier for me to do my part from here.
yeah? What part is that?
operating on favors, political leanings, posturing.
I've been trying to find the right music.
right.
so, I'm off duty today,
but here are those marina reports.
and after my workout,
I'll swing by and pick up a copy of the manifesto.
look at that board.
these kills are precise, but there's also a fluidity,
even some improvisation.
if I could just find the music...
want to borrow my iPod?
got any Chopin?
no. Fresh out of Chopin.
shit. Chopin's perfect.
did you just swear?
what can I say?
you're rubbing off on me, Morgan .
but Chopin is perfect.
so this is how you do what you do.
the truth speaks to me from a peaceful place.
I got to set the stage to hear it.
you know what I mean?
no.
I thrive on chaos.
but this is good, too.
I didn't kill her.
I was just trying to stop the blood.
just the...
no forceful impact spatter
he's telling the truth. I can tell.
palms up, please.
when I found Betsy , she was still breathing.
I wanted to help her.
you believe me, right?
I'm just the lab guy, Mr. Wilson. Sorry.
arms down at your sides, please.
blood misting. Huh.
I need to collect his shirt for evidence.
Morgan!
the girl's mother was at work,
but she isn't really defending her husband.
Wilson and his stepdaughter fought all the time.
the neighbors heard him yelling at her this morning.
then he comes home for lunch -- motive and opportunity.
What'd the blood say?
well, the blood on his hands could have come
from trying to help her, like he claims.
but I did detect, uh, blood mist on his shirt.
a blood mist
the kind that comes from beating on a teenage girl?
no. Yes.
you're absolutely sure?
it's too fine for a bludgeoning.
the mist is from a bludgeoning.
medium-velocity impact spatters -- no doubt about it.
okay, Morgan .
just make sure you get me your blood report
as soon as possible.
this is my chance to make Doakes go away
without spilling a single drop of his blood.
of course, I have to sell an innocent man down the river.
sorry, Mr. Wilson, but I won't let you float too far.
I was just thinking about you.
hmm. I like the sound of that.
Yeah, I had to do a little creative problem-solving
at someone else's expense.
Bravo.
Yeah, I figured you'd like that.
what's up?
well, you know that art installation that I've been working on?
the cannibals.
they're not cannibals. How barbaric!
their eating is symbolic
of the way we consume others to feed our needs.
that's what I meant.
well, it sold.
I-I didn't even create it to sell, but one of my buyers
fell in love with it, and I named an outrageous price,
and she paid me a deposit on the spot.
so...
you in the mood to celebrate?
definitely.
I'm afraid we just can't seat you tonight without a reservation.
as you can see, we are completely at capacity.
Oh, well
no, I'm sorry. You have to help us.
I made this reservation two months ago.
this is our 10-year anniversary.
this is the place where Dexter proposed to me
on the patio, in front of the fountain.
he told me to make a wish, and when I looked down,
there was my diamond ring, sparkling under the water.
that is so romantic.
in case you're wondering,
there's nothing sparkling under that water tonight.
Oh, I'm sure you'll dazzle me somehow.
you're a creative problem-solver now, right?
a changed man, or at least "changing.
I suppose.
there's no supposing about it, Dexter .
you've taken control of your addiction
in a way that few people do.
it's been about a week since we've even discussed your recovery.
I think you're right.
and you haven't felt the need to use?
incredibly, no. I feel...
you know, like I'm finally in control of things again.
we call that warm fuzzy feeling the pink cloud.
it's when an addict experiences acceptance for the first time.
you're saying it won't last?
I'm saying that you have to work it -- that's all.
but I know that you will,
because I believe that we've found a true substitute for your addiction.
what's that?
life.
you're making us all look bad.
I'm the manager of il bistro Vino .
happy anniversary -- on the house.
thank you.
Oh, did you hear that, darling?
Oh, I heard it, darling.
enjoy your evening.
thank you.
happy anniversary, my love.
aren't we in recovery?
Oh, this? It's just bubbles.
we're not gonna shoot it up, are we?
you really have a way. You know that?
a way of what?
of whatever the hell you want.
well, here's to 10 more glorious years
of whatever the hell I want.
Hi, I'm Cody , and I researched saudI Arabia
for my cultural report.
that's good, sweetie.
now, look at me when you talk, okay?
and try and stand up straight.
my board is covered in sand
because saudI Arabia is one big desert.
one great big desert.
one great big desert.
it only rains in a tiny corner of the country,
so they save rainwater
okay, now, try and keep your fingers off your face.
you don't want people to think you're picking your nose.
you mean like this?
Cody, you need to take this seriously.
Dexter said it should be fun.
Dexter does drugs. He's wrong.
I finished my homework.
for the week?
Hey, guys. I'm home.
mom! - Sorry I'm so late.
I'm so happy to see you!
mom!
Oh, wow! What a greeting.
okay, why don't you guys go get ready for bed?
really, mom? I just got home.
they need their rest.
I will be in in just a minute to check on you.
those two are making great progress.
progress -- towards what?
their full potential!
mom, I know you're really good at these things,
but now that you're here,
have you thought about applying for a teaching job?
no, I'm through with the schools.
well, I thought teaching was your life.
and your children are going to be the beneficiaries of all that I have to offer.
our injunction stopped the tribune
from publishing the manifesto -- for now.
at the very least, we'll have time to get a jump on things before the news frenzy hits.
so, let's take advantage of this window.
our goal for the next 48 hours is to wade through
this shining piece of social commentary.
I've never seen so many dense and convoluted ideas in my life,
but we need to search them all for clues to his identity.
so, first impressions? I got something.
there are a lot of literary references in this document.
how do you know? - I like to read books.
what kind of books?
all kinds. Who cares?
Anyway...I see lots of references, like this one.
you can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.
he's a trekker!
that shit's straight from "deep space nine"
what? Mark twain said that.
it's one of his most famous quotes.
twain was never on "deep space nine."
he was on "next Gene ration.
he didn't say it on "star trek.
okay, so what's it from?
a Connecticut yankee in king Arthur's court.
angel, what other literary quotes are in that manifesto?
this guy -- he's the best boxing student I have ever had.
after four weeks, he's getting in shots to my head.
and finally he says, "I think I'm ready.
I'm like, "you're ready for what?"
and he says, "to kick my mom's ass."
I'm like, "you're learning how to box
because you want to beat up your mom?"
what the fuck?!
did -- did you hear what I said?
I was gonna hit the showers.
I'll meet you back here in 10 minutes.
okay, yeah, 10 minutes.
who the fuck are you?
Oh, hi! I'm Lila .
Oh, pardon my tits.
um, we thought you were crashing at your boyfriend's tonight.
we -- we who?
Dexter and I.
could you just...wait here a minute?
who's the skank?
Deb, did knocking occur to you?
who is she?
and are you trying to fuck her or set her on fire?
I didn't do this to you when you were riding square-jaw guy with the handcuffs.
that's different.
I wasn't cheating on anyone with Gabriel .
how could you do this to Rita , not to mention her kids?
you're like their father.
Hey, Rita broke up with me, okay?
you fucked up, Dex ...
...big-time.
excuse me.
don't worry.
she just needs some time to adjust -- that's all.
I had officers tear apart the stepfather's house
no murder weapon, but he had to hide it somewhere.
where is Wilson now? - Interview room 2.
we still have him? Why didn't his lawyer post bond?
well, he tried, but I pulled in a favor at the courthouse
and got a bail enhancement,
so they had to start the paperwork all over again.
I'm gonna break that cocksucker today.
what evidence you say we got on this guy?
he was dripping in the victim's blood.
he was home alone with her.
they fought the morning of the murder. All circumstantial.
Yeah, but the blood spatter on his shirt was a direct result of a blunt-force beating, Maria .
I'd like to see the blood report.
you'll get it as soon as I do.
if you're looking for me, I'll be questioning the suspect.
they're still playing my tune.
it's like I'm conducting a final symphony, "requiem for demonic Dexter ."
and forming the entire brass section,
sergeant James Doakes .
when I reach the end,
maybe I can lay to rest the monster
formerly known as Dexter .
just hang in there, Mr. Wilson.
I've asked a psycholinguist at m. i.t.
to analyze our manifesto.
his computer tabulates punctuation, misspellings,
and sentence structure to identify a set of key words,
which he'll use to create a profile of our killer.
Sounds...complicated. Stay on it.
okay, we've been at this too long.
it's, uh, 1: 00.
let's break for lunch.
are you all right?
huh? Yeah, I'm fine.
anything you want to talk about?
no, not really.
well, if you change your mind -- it's my brother.
he was dating this chick
super sweet, a little doe-eyed.
but, god, for him, fucking perfect,
and he just threw her away.
I'm just pissed at Dexter , not to mention my boyfriend,
who did absolutely nothing wrong.
but every time he opened his mouth last night,
I wanted to fucking slap him.
you've been listening to Chopin.
Yeah, I downloaded a Chopin
um, "nocturne number 2 in e flat major."
one of my favorites.
it, uh, can have this effect on people.
it can stir up some dust.
no shit.
listen, you -- you can heal yourself, sir.
just -- you just need to talk to me.
get it off you,
otherwise, it's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.
why don't you just listen to me?
I didn't do this.
you -- you can't say it and make it true.
you have a conscience,
and it's really fucking with you right now.
I wish it were me. I wish I were dead.
Yeah.
why are we questioning that guy?
he's a murder suspect.
no, he's not. He's innocent.
what did you say?
my blood report backed his story.
Mr. Wilson found his stepdaughter dead,
just like I told sergeant Doakes at the crime scene.
you turned in the blood report? When?
I don't know
at some point before I went home last night.
I put it right on the sergeant's desk,
just like he asked.
the green folder.
Yeah, according to my findings,
the mist on the stepfather's shirt was exhaled
from the victim when he tried to revive her.
the autopsy confirmed she had severe internal bleeding,
due to the bludgeoning.
Yeah, but he could have beaten her first.
that's impossible.
the crime-scene photos show blood radiating outward
around the victim's body.
that kind of bludgeoning would have covered the real killer
in blood from head to toe.
Thanks.
Mr. Wilson, you're free to go.
what the hell? Lieutenant, this man is a killer.
this man has been through enough for one day.
there's an officer in the hallway.
he'll see that you get your personal belongings back
and take you home.
thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much.
what the hell are you doing?
trying to save your career, James , if it isn't too late.
did you even check the blood report?
I didn't get the blood report.
it's on your desk, and it exonerates your suspect.
we should be out there looking for the real killer.
Maria, that is not what he told me at
that motherfucker.
he's good.
who?
Morgan.
he planned this whole thing.
Maria, that psychopath set me up.
Dexter again? You're blaming Dexter for this?
do you have any idea how pathetic that sounds?
this is not about Dexter !
this is about the poor judgment you have been displaying
in this department for months now!
you want to work out?
no.
I wasn't talking about the gym.
you're sweet, but I'm really not in the mood.
so, what do you want to do?
uh...
I think I want to break up.
for real?
Yeah.
is that okay?
no.
no, it's not okay.
fuck, what did I do, Deb ?
nothing. I swear to god.
You're...smoking hot and...fun
And...soulful and...
age-appropriate.
and but what?
but...
sometimes the truth speaks from a peaceful place.
it's taken me a long time to find that place,
but I think I have,
and it's telling me you're not the right one for me.
I'm so sorry.
you live in a nice neighborhood.
Yeah, I had no idea.
I'm usually passing by at 35 miles per hour.
I'm not a real big walker.
everybody walks in London.
of course, they're usually walking to the pub.
how far are we going?
Oh, you're a bit grumpy tonight.
what's wrong?
come on. Don't close up on me now.
no, I honestly don't know.
I mean, thanks to you, things are...
actually looking up.
some people at work have been...after me.
I think I have them under control.
so, why the grouchiness?
is it because your sister thinks I'm a trollop?
it's not just... Deb .
it's the suddenness of all of this
losing Rita , the kids.
they've been the only thing keeping me human for a long time.
were they keeping you human, though,
or were they the ones making you feel like the monster
that you were talking about?
keep going.
your friends and family have to accept you
for who you're evolving into now that you're clean.
is that what I am
clean?
cause I don't feel that way at all.
no, you certainly don't.
Mmm, god.
I wish I could fuck you right now.
whose house is this?
couldn't tell you.
God.
he's a man of many talents.
Ah!
look. I'm some old bitch.
better not press our luck. We should go.
Hello?
Hi, Dexter .
Cody?
can you come to my school tomorrow?
what's at your school, buddy?
I'm doing my cultural report.
saudi Arabia.
can you watch me? I'm kind of scared.
Cody, what are you doing?
who is this?
Dexter.
Hello?
who was that?
Rita's son.
he wants me to come see him at school tomorrow.
Oh, poor kid.
he doesn't understand that you've gone.
I think I'll go.
whatever you think's best.
Hey, guys!
I'm home!
Hello?
they're in bed.
why so early?
Cody is being punished for sneaking away
to make a phone call without permission.
Astor joined him in a misguided show of support.
well, who was Cody calling?
Dexter.
the boy was trying to invite him to his school.
can you imagine? Oh.
mom, we need to have a talk.
I made a phone call of my own today.
I spoke with aunt Cecilia.
she told me the school district fired you almost a year ago.
we had philosophical differences.
the educational system is falling apart.
school should be life itself, not a preparation for living.
do you know that they give trophies to every child now whether they win or lose?
Yeah, I finally get it.
it took me a few decades, but it's not just me
nobody can deal with you.
you don't leave room for anybody else to exist.
it's not my fault that so many people are willing to settle for mediocrity.
just look at you -- first Paul, then Dexter .
Rita, you lack even common sense,
and now you're passing that torch of ordinary character
on to your children.
shut the fuck up.
nobody talks about my kids that way.
Thatagirl.
that's what I've been waiting to see.
Yeah! I'm done with you.
no, you're not.
but you go -- you give me hell.
no.
no, I won't do that.
I won't let you turn me into...you.
Rita - here's what's gonna happen
first thing in the morning,
you're gonna pack up and go home.
you'll come and visit us for birthdays and holidays,
but you're not gonna live with us anymore.
well...
...if that's what I have to sacrifice
to get you on your feet...
kill one man, and you're a murderer.
kill thousands, a conqueror.
kill them all, and you're a god.
does it sound to you like our guy
has a narcissistic personality disorder,
a classic god complex?
I think you're onto something, Angel .
to tell you the truth,
I don't know what my alter ego had in mind
when he wrote that crap.
I just pulled from various blogs on the internet,
mixed and matched -- presto manifesto.
you finally decided to fight back.
I been waiting.
hope you don't expect me to comment on that
so you can record it on your hidden tape recorder.
I wasn't born yesterday.
you might have been, for all I know.
your past is a bigger mystery than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.
I tried every avenue, legal and otherwise, but there ain't no paper trail on the early years of Dexter Morgan .
I guess there's no recorder running, after all.
no, man.
unlike you, I do everything out in the open.
well, in that case, sergeant,
let me put this in the open for you.
no matter what you try, no matter when,
no matter how hard you work,
I'll always be a step ahead of you for one simple reason.
and what's that?
I own you.
Aah! Fuck!
get him off of me! Get off me!
why are you doing this?!
stop!
I want your gun, your badge, and your police I. d.
I want your access card, too
now!
type a statement that sergeant Doakes
is on administrative leave,
pending an internal affairs investigation.
you two, get him out of here.
Thanks.
what the hell happened?
I don't know. He just...jumped me.
that guy's always had it out for me.
thanks for meeting with me, don.
well, I don't know what the point is.
the district court injunction hearing starts in three hours.
which everyone here knows we're going to lose.
don't look so shocked. We always lose these things.
you bastards and your free speech.
my boss never lets me say anything.
I'll tell you what
I will agree to dropping the injunction,
which will save us days of courtroom arguments
and a boatload of legal fees,
if we can agree on some simple ground rules
on how you publish that document.
ground rules.
we're not gonna have any ground rules.
my only goal here is to avoid compromising an investigation of a mass murderer...
who could hurt a lot more people.
give me just a second, will you, frank?
I can't believe you got those assholes
to publish the manifesto without the victims' names
and as a page-3 story.
no sense hype in it.
it might just inspire the killer to greater heights.
wait.
it's quiet here...
peaceful.
it's a good spot.
for what?
it's 1: 00.
so it is.
I brought my own sandwich.
I thought you didn't like the quiet, Morgan .
I didn't.
I don't.
when I'm alone and it's quiet, I get scared...
shitless,
like I start hearing what's really going on inside.
I see.
so if it's all the same to you,
maybe I can just practice when you're around.
okay.
cause when you're around,
I kind of feel like I can deal with anything, you know?
like what happened to me
I don't have to run from it.
I don't have to jump into bed with some guy and hide there.
you give me strength.
I'm kind of opening up here.
what do you want me to say?
I don't know.
you're the fucking zen master. Figure it out.
Morgan...
I've got plaque in my arteries.
I know the lyrics to elevator music.
my hair isn't getting any thicker.
you're gonna do great up there.
you just have to remember something
they're more frightened than you are.
no, they're not.
are so.
you're gonna be staring at them the whole time.
if one of those unsuspecting moms or dads
does something embarrassing while you're up on stage...
like pick their nose?
...you're gonna be the one who sees it.
Yeah.
now that's power.
now go have fun.
Dexter, over here. We saved you a seat.
Thanks, guys.
there you go -- $18, 000.
I'll send a truck for the piece tomorrow.
I am telling you, Lila ,
this is going to create a critical mass for you.
according to the psycholinguistic analysis
of the manifesto,
our killer is a white male in his 50s.
what else?
uh, the killer has no girlfriends
and considers himself a good catholic.
hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
how can you tell all that by putting words in a computer?
I don't know, dude. It's science.
how about common sense?
I think the guy that we're looking for is pissed off at god,
and that's why he kills people.
Really? I actually found him very politically motivated.
Yeah, like a modern-day revolutionary.
which would suggest that he's killing for social change.
this is what he wants.
what's that?
confusion, chaos
it's what the killer wants.
he's always been an intensely private figure,
dispatching victims silently.
now he's suddenly a media whore? It doesn't make sense.
he's creating a clusterfuck.
very good, officer Morgan .
the killer's making us chase our tails.
you know what that means?
he knows how we work.
look how he hits every major theme
political, environmental, religious.
in one section, he manages to weave together Julius Caesar,
berlin, Germany, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Gandhi.
it's scattershot.
he knew that this would send us scurrying
like squirrels for nuts.
Yeah, but to suggest that he might be one of us
how can you be sure?
Hi, I'm Cody , and I researched saudI Arabia
for my cultural report.
my board is covered in sand
because saudI Arabia is one big desert.
as you can see, I used coffee beans to write "saudI Arabia."
arabic coffee is very famous.
I'm a little confused.
Lila is the one showing me how to take control,
stop killing, get my life clean.
but this is the first time since I went into recovery
that I actually feel clean.
the children in saudI Arabia are just like us,
because they...
this is the saudI Arabian flag.
the Arabic letters mean "there is no god except Allah."
do you know how tough it is for a woman in saudI Arabia?
they can't drive or have powerful jobs.
or get this -- they can't even go to the movies without men's permission.
after they turn 12, they have to wear long black sleeves,
and they can't hardly even talk to men until they get married.
the new king, Abdullah,
is trying to change some old bad rules,
so women can do more things...
thank you very much for listening.
or, as they say in Arabic, "shokran."
I can't believe how calm you were up there.
Yeah, you were like a professional talker.
you were pretty good.
can Dexter come for ice cream with us?
can he, mom, please?
Uh...sure, Dexter can join us.
I wouldn't miss it.
maybe they'll have some delicious saudI flavors,
like sand or oil.
hang on a sec, guys.
hello.
are you hurt?
O-okay, okay. I'm coming now.
I know. Me too.
come on, kids. Dexter won't be joining us.
Rita, it's an emergency.
look, I'm so sorry, you guys.
I'm gonna make it up to you,
but I got to help a friend who's in trouble.
there was a fire at her place.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, let's go.
Dexter.
what happened?
I was working on my piece with the blowtorch,
and it just caught fire. I was so scared.
Oh, I guess so.
promise me that you won't leave me,
that you won't go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
Hey, you got your light fixed.
you??
do U ???
???
maybe ???
you???
are you ???
???
DEX??
Dexter ???
those ??
???
it's
how MUCH
you ???
I've been??
I know??
he could??
he BROKE??
he's PROBABLY GONNA START TAILING ME AGAIN.
sergeant DOAKES TAILED YOU?
I FOLLOWED HIM TO AN N. A. MEETING.
that ASSHOLE LIED ABOUT THAT, TOO.
you're OBSESSED. I'M NOT.
and I NEED YOU TO SEE IT!
dinner WAS FANTASTIC, RITA. WOW.
I KIND OF LIKE HER.
Lila: Dex, just calling to check in.
imagine Rita's face if I told her that you and I had spent the night together in a hotel.
it's OVER, DEXTER.
I GUESS I JUST HOPE WITH LUNDY IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.
Why? I RESPECT HIM.
you LOVE HIM.
no. HE'S LIKE MY DAD.
you WANT TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
you're THE ONE WHO SAID I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL MY FEELINGS!
well, NOW I'M TELLING YOU TO GET THEM UNDER CONTROL!
which STEP WAS THAT?
that night, forest grew
Lila: USE THE ENTIRE CANVAS.
start FROM THE TOP. WORK YOUR WAY DOWN.
light, FEATHERY STROKES.
perfect!
stunning.
try LONGER STROKES NOW.
perfect.
you REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, DON'T YOU?
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
some MEN DO.
no.
I've ALWAYS FOUND INSTRUCTION MANUALS...
quite USEFUL.
okay, YOUR TURN.
what DO YOU WANT?
I THINK THAT WAS IT.
hmm, COME ON.
you MUST HAVE SOME DARK FANTASIES...
...UNFULFILLED URGES.
I'm PRETTY GOOD AT ACTING ON THOSE.
Really?
then FUCK ME LIKE THAT.
your LIGHT'S BURNED OUT.
it's THE WIRING.
I've BEEN ASKING MY LANDLORD TO FIX IT FOR WEEKS.
well, NOW I CAN SEE BETTER.
that's WHERE MY LANDLORD LIVES.
now HE'LL HAVE TO FIX IT.
see YOU LATER.
got TO ADMIRE LILA FOR TAKING THINGS INTO HER OWN HANDS.
that INCLUDES ME.
Ohh. MOM. [ SIGHS ]
come ON, LET'S GO! NO MORE MOPING.
I'm NOT MOPING. I'M SLEEPING.
oversleeping -- THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.
the ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET OVER DEXTER
is IF YOU TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR DAY.
come ON. YOU'RE NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL ANYMORE.
go SCRUB YOUR FACE, AND I'LL HEAT UP SOME OATMEAL.
didn't HEAR YOU COME IN LAST NIGHT.
well, IT WAS LATE. I WAS QUIET.
Yeah, YOU'RE GOOD AT QUIET.
guess YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BE WITH ME CRASHING HERE
and RITA'S MOM OVER THERE.
you AND RITA FUCK QUIET, TOO?
and SHE'S OFF, RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.
because ME -- I WAKE THE GODDAMN DEAD.
it's A PROBLEM.
Oh, I KNOW, ONLY TOO WELL.
scary, RIGHT?
sometimes I DISTURB MYSELF.
so [CHUCKLES] WHAT KIND OF NOISES DOES RITA MAKE?
could WE NOT TALK ABOUT SEX...
or RITA?
Why?
cause WE BROKE UP...
for REAL.
it's OVER.
you BREAK UP, YOU GET BACK TOGETHER
that's JUST WHAT GOES ON.
I MEAN, YOU AND RITA ARE FOREVER.
just SAY YOU'RE SORRY AND SEND SOME FUCKING FLOWERS.
you're NOT HEARING ME.
look, WHEN ALL THIS BLOWS OVER,
I'll SPEND A FEW DAYS AT GABRIEL'S, AND...
you CAN SCREW RITA AS LOUD AS YOU WANT.
big NEWS, DEX.
Whoa! FEEL LIKE I GOT CAUGHT IN A WAVE.
the MIAMI TRIBUNE RECEIVED A 32-PAGE MANIFESTO IN THE MAIL.
it's LOOKING GOOD FOR THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
well, I'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.
look, THIS MAY BE LEGIT.
the MANIFESTO INCLUDES THE NAMES OF THREE VICTIMS
we NEVER RELEASED TO THE PRESS.
Oh, THAT IS BIG NEWS.
I'm HEADING OVER TO THE TRIBUNE NOW FOR SPECIAL AGENT LUNDY.
he PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE TEAM.
go, ANGEL.
Yeah, I'M PSYCHED.
Yeah, ME TOO. I'M ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED.
I SENT THAT MANIFESTO TO THE TRIBUNE.
guess I'VE BEEN TAKING SOME CUES FROM LILA LATELY, AND NOT JUST IN BED.
I'm TIRED OF REACTING TO THE MOVES OF AGENT LUNDY AND HIS SUPER POSSE.
time TO CONTROL THEIR ACTIONS FOR A CHANGE.
Betsy COURT, 16. BLUNT-FORCE BEATING.
it LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS SUNNING HERSELF
and NEVER SAW IT COMING.
who CALLED IN THE BODY?
Craig WILSON, THE STEPFATHER. HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
Wilson TOLD THE REPORTING OFFICER
that HE CAME HOME FOR LUNCH AND FOUND HER THAT WAY.
um, YOU AND DEXTER RESOLVE YOUR ISSUES?
as FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
Why? THE BITCH COME CRYING TO YOU AGAIN?
no.
there's BLOOD WORK TO BE DONE HERE,
and IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOURSELF,
I NEED TO CALL IN ANOTHER DETECTIVE.
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING TO HURT THE LITTLE GIRL'S FEELINGS.
God DAMN IT, JAMES, I'M NOT JOKING.
do I LOOK LIKE I'M LAUGHING?
no. YOU DON'T. I WISH YOU WOULD. YOU USED TO.
bullshit. I NEVER LAUGHED.
[ scoffs ] YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
now, LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO SCARE YOU ANYMORE.
the REALITY IS, YOU'RE OUT OF FREE PASSES.
now, I ALREADY STOPPED DEXTER FROM FILING A COMPLAINT
against YOU ONCE.
I NEVER ASKED YOU TO DO THAT, MARIA. WELL, I DID IT,
out OF MY OWN CONCERN OVER YOUR OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOR.
now I'M ON THE LINE,
so IF YOU BULLY DEXTER IN ANY WAY
if YOU EVEN LOOK AT HIM WRONG,
I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALLOUT.
you GOT IT?
I GOT IT.
you're BACKING THE FUCKING FREAKTARD.
where YOU BEEN, DEXTER?
you DON'T BRING ME DOUGHNUTS.
you DON'T SING ME LOVE SONGS.
how ARE YOU, CAMILLA?
I've BEEN BETTER.
well, THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
sergeant DOAKES DROPPED BY MY FILE ROOM YESTERDAY.
he REQUESTED THE CASE FILES
for THE 1973 SHIPPING-YARD MURDERS.
I GAVE HIM THE SAME LINE I GAVE YOU
when YOU CAME SNIFFING AROUND,
said ALL THAT OLD STUFF WAS BOXED UP
in THE BASEMENT OF CITY HALL.
that MADE HIM REAL ANGRY.
he SCARED ME, DEXTER.
that's NOT RIGHT. HE SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
look, DEX, I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT YOUR FATHER ASKED ME
to DESTROY THOSE FILES TO PROTECT YOU.
now I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON.
now, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET FIRED.
I'm RETIRING NEXT YEAR. DID I TELL YOU?
I've BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO STAYING HOME WITH GENE.
you WON'T LOSE YOUR RETIREMENT. I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
I CAN STALL SERGEANT DOAKES FOR A FEW DAYS,
but EVENTUALLY, HE'LL FIGURE OUT
that THAT CASE FILE'S MISSING, JUST LIKE YOU DID.
and HE'LL TRACK IT BACK TO ME,
you KNOW, JUST LIKE YOU DID.
I'll TAKE CARE OF THIS. YOU HAVE MY WORD.
so MUCH FOR THREATENING DOAKES.
he WON'T BACK OFF TILL HE EXPOSES THE TWISTED BRANCHES OF MY FAMILY TREE, FROM MY FATHER'S INDISCRETIONS TO MY MURDEROUS BROTHER TO THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL -- ME.
Hey.
why AREN'T YOU AT THE TRIBUNE?
what FOR?
our GUY'S NOT GONNA LEAVE DNA EVIDENCE ON A DOCUMENT.
Oh, BUT THE THRILL OF THE HUNT.
I've HAD THAT PARTICULAR THRILL.
I'll LEAVE IT TO YOUNGER MEN.
besides, IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO DO MY PART FROM HERE.
yeah? WHAT PART IS THAT?
operating ON FAVORS, POLITICAL LEANINGS, POSTURING.
I've BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT MUSIC.
right.
so, I'M OFF DUTY TODAY,
but HERE ARE THOSE MARINA REPORTS.
and AFTER MY WORKOUT,
I'll SWING BY AND PICK UP A COPY OF THE MANIFESTO.
look AT THAT BOARD.
these KILLS ARE PRECISE,
but THERE'S ALSO A FLUIDITY,
even SOME IMPROVISATION.
if I COULD JUST FIND THE MUSIC...
want TO BORROW MY iPod?
got ANY CHOPIN?
no. FRESH OUT OF CHOPIN.
shit. CHOPIN'S PERFECT.
did YOU JUST SWEAR?
[ Chuckles ] WHAT CAN I SAY?
you're RUBBING OFF ON ME, MORGAN.
but CHOPIN IS PERFECT.
so THIS IS HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU DO.
the TRUTH SPEAKS TO ME FROM A PEACEFUL PLACE.
I GOT TO SET THE STAGE TO HEAR IT.
you KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
no.
I THRIVE ON CHAOS.
but THIS IS GOOD, TOO.
I DIDN'T KILL HER.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO STOP THE BLOOD.
no FORCEFUL IMPACT SPATTER
he's TELLING THE TRUTH. I CAN TELL.
palms UP, PLEASE.
when I FOUND BETSY, SHE WAS STILL BREATHING.
I WANTED TO HELP HER.
you BELIEVE ME, RIGHT?
I'm JUST THE LAB GUY, MR. WILSON. SORRY.
arms DOWN AT YOUR SIDES, PLEASE.
blood MISTING. HUH.
I NEED TO COLLECT HIS SHIRT FOR EVIDENCE.
the GIRL'S MOTHER WAS AT WORK,
but SHE ISN'T REALLY DEFENDING HER HUSBAND.
Wilson AND HIS STEPDAUGHTER FOUGHT ALL THE TIME.
the NEIGHBORS HEARD HIM YELLING AT HER THIS MORNING.
then HE COMES HOME FOR LUNCH -- MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITY.
What'd THE BLOOD SAY?
well, THE BLOOD ON HIS HANDS COULD HAVE COME
from TRYING TO HELP HER, LIKE HE CLAIMS.
but I DID DETECT, UH, BLOOD MIST ON HIS SHIRT.
a BLOOD MIST
the KIND THAT COMES FROM BEATING ON A TEENAGE GIRL?
no. YES.
you're ABSOLUTELY SURE?
it's TOO FINE FOR A BLUDGEONING.
the MIST IS FROM A BLUDGEONING.
medium-velocity IMPACT SPATTERS -- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
okay, MORGAN.
just MAKE SURE YOU GET ME YOUR BLOOD REPORT
as SOON AS POSSIBLE.
this IS MY CHANCE TO MAKE DOAKES GO AWAY WITHOUT SPILLING A SINGLE DROP OF HIS BLOOD.
of COURSE, I HAVE TO SELL AN INNOCENT MAN DOWN THE RIVER.
sorry, MR. WILSON, BUT I WON'T LET YOU FLOAT TOO FAR.
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.
hmm. I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
Yeah, I HAD TO DO A LITTLE CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING
at SOMEONE ELSE'S EXPENSE.
Bravo.
Yeah, I figured you'd like that.
what's up?
well, YOU KNOW THAT ART INSTALLATION
that I'VE BEEN WORKING ON?
the CANNIBALS.
they're not cannibals. How barbaric!
their EATING IS SYMBOLIC
of THE WAY WE CONSUME OTHERS TO FEED OUR NEEDS.
that's WHAT I MEANT.
well, IT SOLD.
I-I DIDN'T EVEN CREATE IT TO SELL, BUT ONE OF MY BUYERS fell in love with it, and I named an outrageous price, and she paid me a deposit on the spot.
so...
you IN THE MOOD TO CELEBRATE?
definitely.
I'm AFRAID WE JUST CAN'T SEAT YOU TONIGHT
without A RESERVATION.
as YOU CAN SEE, WE ARE COMPLETELY AT CAPACITY.
Oh, WELL
no, I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE TO HELP US.
I MADE THIS RESERVATION TWO MONTHS AGO.
this IS OUR 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.
this IS THE PLACE WHERE DEXTER PROPOSED TO ME
on THE PATIO, IN FRONT OF THE FOUNTAIN.
he TOLD ME TO MAKE A WISH, AND WHEN I LOOKED DOWN,
there WAS MY DIAMOND RING, SPARKLING UNDER THE WATER.
that IS SO ROMANTIC.
Dexter: IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,
there's NOTHING SPARKLING UNDER THAT WATER TONIGHT.
[ Chuckles ] OH, I'M SURE YOU'LL DAZZLE ME SOMEHOW.
you're A CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVER NOW, RIGHT?
a CHANGED MAN, OR AT LEAST "CHANGING.
I SUPPOSE.
there's NO SUPPOSING ABOUT IT, DEXTER.
you've TAKEN CONTROL OF YOUR ADDICTION
in A WAY THAT FEW PEOPLE DO.
it's BEEN ABOUT A WEEK
since WE'VE EVEN DISCUSSED YOUR RECOVERY.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
and YOU HAVEN'T FELT THE NEED TO USE?
incredibly, NO. I FEEL...
you KNOW, LIKE I'M FINALLY IN CONTROL OF THINGS AGAIN.
we CALL THAT WARM FUZZY FEELING THE PINK CLOUD.
it's WHEN AN ADDICT EXPERIENCES ACCEPTANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
you're SAYING IT WON'T LAST?
I'm SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK IT -- THAT'S ALL.
but I KNOW THAT YOU WILL,
because I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE FOUND A TRUE SUBSTITUTE
for YOUR ADDICTION.
what's THAT?
life.
you're MAKING US ALL LOOK BAD.
I'm THE MANAGER OF IL BISTRO VINO.
happy ANNIVERSARY -- ON THE HOUSE.
thank YOU. [ CHUCKLES ]
Oh, DID YOU HEAR THAT, DARLING?
Oh, I HEARD IT, DARLING.
enjoy YOUR EVENING.
thank YOU.
happy ANNIVERSARY, MY LOVE.
aren't WE IN RECOVERY?
Oh, THIS? IT'S JUST BUBBLES.
we're NOT GONNA SHOOT IT UP, ARE WE?
you REALLY HAVE A WAY. YOU KNOW THAT?
a WAY OF WHAT?
of WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT.
well, HERE'S TO 10 MORE GLORIOUS YEARS
of WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT.
Hi, I'M CODY, AND I RESEARCHED SAUDI ARABIA
for MY CULTURAL REPORT.
Gail: THAT'S GOOD, SWEETIE.
now, LOOK AT ME WHEN YOU TALK, OKAY?
and TRY AND STAND UP STRAIGHT.
my BOARD IS COVERED IN SAND
because SAUDI ARABIA IS ONE BIG DESERT.
one GREAT BIG DESERT.
one GREAT BIG DESERT.
it ONLY RAINS IN A TINY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY,
so THEY SAVE RAINWATER
okay, NOW, TRY AND KEEP YOUR FINGERS OFF YOUR FACE.
you DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK YOU'RE PICKING YOUR NOSE.
you MEAN LIKE THIS?
Cody, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
Dexter SAID IT SHOULD BE FUN.
Dexter DOES DRUGS. HE'S WRONG.
I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK.
for THE WEEK?
Hey, GUYS. I'M HOME.
mom! SORRY I'M SO LATE.
I'm SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!
mom!
Oh, WOW! WHAT A GREETING.
okay, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO GET READY FOR BED?
really, MOM? I JUST GOT HOME.
they NEED THEIR REST.
I WILL BE IN IN JUST A MINUTE TO CHECK ON YOU.
those TWO ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS.
progress -- TOWARDS WHAT?
their FULL POTENTIAL!
mom, I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THESE THINGS,
but NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
have YOU THOUGHT ABOUT APPLYING FOR A TEACHING JOB?
no, I'M THROUGH WITH THE SCHOOLS.
well, I THOUGHT TEACHING WAS YOUR LIFE.
and YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE THE BENEFICIARIES
of ALL THAT I HAVE TO OFFER.
our INJUNCTION STOPPED THE TRIBUNE
from PUBLISHING THE MANIFESTO -- FOR NOW.
at THE VERY LEAST,
we'll HAVE TIME TO GET A JUMP ON THINGS
before THE NEWS FRENZY HITS.
so, LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WINDOW.
our GOAL FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS IS TO WADE THROUGH
this SHINING PIECE OF SOCIAL COMMENTARY.
I've NEVER SEEN SO MANY DENSE AND CONVOLUTED IDEAS IN MY LIFE,
but WE NEED TO SEARCH THEM ALL FOR CLUES TO HIS IDENTITY.
so, FIRST IMPRESSIONS? I GOT SOMETHING.
there ARE A LOT OF LITERARY REFERENCES IN THIS DOCUMENT.
how DO YOU KNOW? I LIKE TO READ BOOKS.
what KIND OF BOOKS?
all KINDS. WHO CARES?
ANYWAY...I SEE LOTS OF REFERENCES, LIKE THIS ONE.
you CAN'T DEPEND ON YOUR EYES
when YOUR IMAGINATION IS OUT OF FOCUS.
[ Chuckles ] HE'S A TREKKER!
that SHIT'S STRAIGHT FROM "DEEP SPACE NINE.
what? MARK TWAIN SAID THAT.
it's ONE OF HIS MOST FAMOUS QUOTES.
twain WAS NEVER ON "DEEP SPACE NINE.
he WAS ON "NEXT GENERATION.
he DIDN'T SAY IT ON "STAR TREK.
okay, SO WHAT'S IT FROM?
a CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT.
angel, WHAT OTHER LITERARY QUOTES ARE IN THAT MANIFESTO?
this GUY -- HE'S THE BEST BOXING STUDENT I HAVE EVER HAD.
after FOUR WEEKS, HE'S GETTING IN SHOTS TO MY HEAD.
and FINALLY HE SAYS, "I THINK I'M READY.
I'm LIKE, "YOU'RE READY FOR WHAT?
and HE SAYS, "TO KICK MY MOM'S ASS.
I'm LIKE, "YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO BOX
because YOU WANT TO BEAT UP YOUR MOM?
what THE FUCK?!
did -- DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?
I WAS GONNA HIT THE SHOWERS.
I'll MEET YOU BACK HERE IN 10 MINUTES.
okay, YEAH, 10 MINUTES.
who THE FUCK ARE YOU?
Oh, HI! I'M LILA.
Oh, PARDON MY TITS.
um, WE THOUGHT YOU WERE CRASHING AT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S TONIGHT.
we -- WE WHO?
Dexter AND I.
could YOU JUST...WAIT HERE A MINUTE?
who's THE SKANK?
Deb, DID KNOCKING OCCUR TO YOU?
who IS SHE?
and ARE YOU TRYING TO FUCK HER OR SET HER ON FIRE?
I DIDN'T DO THIS TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE RIDING SQUARE-JAW GUY
with THE HANDCUFFS.
that's DIFFERENT. I WASN'T CHEATING ON ANYONE WITH GABRIEL.
how COULD YOU DO THIS TO RITA, NOT TO MENTION HER KIDS?
you're LIKE THEIR FATHER.
Hey, RITA BROKE UP WITH ME, OKAY?
you FUCKED UP, DEX...
...BIG-TIME.
EW. EXCUSE ME.
don't WORRY.
she JUST NEEDS SOME TIME TO ADJUST -- THAT'S ALL.
I HAD OFFICERS TEAR APART THE STEPFATHER'S HOUSE
no MURDER WEAPON, BUT HE HAD TO HIDE IT SOMEWHERE.
where IS WILSON NOW? INTERVIEW ROOM 2.
we STILL HAVE HIM? WHY DIDN'T HIS LAWYER POST BOND?
well, HE TRIED, BUT I PULLED IN A FAVOR AT THE COURTHOUSE
and GOT A BAIL ENHANCEMENT,
so THEY HAD TO START THE PAPERWORK ALL OVER AGAIN.
I'm GONNA BREAK THAT COCKSUCKER TODAY.
what EVIDENCE YOU SAY WE GOT ON THIS GUY?
he WAS DRIPPING IN THE VICTIM'S BLOOD.
he WAS HOME ALONE WITH HER.
they FOUGHT THE MORNING OF THE MURDER. ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
Yeah, BUT THE BLOOD SPATTER ON HIS SHIRT WAS A DIRECT RESULT
of A BLUNT-FORCE BEATING, MARIA.
I'd LIKE TO SEE THE BLOOD REPORT.
you'll GET IT AS SOON AS I DO.
if YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME, I'LL BE QUESTIONING THE SUSPECT.
they're STILL PLAYING MY TUNE.
it's LIKE I'M CONDUCTING A FINAL SYMPHONY, "REQUIEM FOR DEMONIC DEXTER.
and FORMING THE ENTIRE BRASS SECTION, SERGEANT JAMES DOAKES.
when I REACH THE END, MAYBE I CAN LAY TO REST THE MONSTER FORMERLY KNOWN AS DEXTER.
just HANG IN THERE, MR. WILSON.
I've ASKED A PSYCHOLINGUIST AT M. I.T.
to ANALYZE OUR MANIFESTO.
his COMPUTER TABULATES PUNCTUATION, MISSPELLINGS,
and SENTENCE STRUCTURE TO IDENTIFY A SET OF KEY WORDS,
which HE'LL USE TO CREATE A PROFILE OF OUR KILLER.
SOUNDS...COMPLICATED. STAY ON IT.
okay, WE'VE BEEN AT THIS TOO LONG.
it's, UH, 1: 00.
let's BREAK FOR LUNCH.
are YOU ALL RIGHT?
huh? YEAH, I'M FINE.
anything YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
no, NOT REALLY.
well, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND -- IT'S MY BROTHER.
he WAS DATING THIS CHICK
SUPERSWEET, A LITTLE DOE-EYED.
but, GOD, FOR HIM, FUCKING PERFECT,
and HE JUST THREW HER AWAY.
I'm JUST PISSED AT DEXTER, NOT TO MENTION MY BOYFRIEND,
who DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG.
but EVERY TIME HE OPENED HIS MOUTH LAST NIGHT,
I WANTED TO FUCKING SLAP HIM.
you've BEEN LISTENING TO CHOPIN.
Yeah, I DOWNLOADED A CHOPIN
um, "NOCTURNE NUMBER 2 IN E FLAT MAJOR.
one OF MY FAVORITES.
it, UH, CAN HAVE THIS EFFECT ON PEOPLE.
it CAN STIR UP SOME DUST.
no SHIT.
listen, YOU -- YOU CAN HEAL YOURSELF, SIR.
just -- YOU JUST NEED TO TALK TO ME.
get IT OFF YOU, OTHERWISE, IT'S GONNA HAUNT YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
why DON'T YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME?
I DIDN'T DO THIS.
you -- YOU CAN'T SAY IT AND MAKE IT TRUE.
you HAVE A CONSCIENCE, AND IT'S REALLY FUCKING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.
I WISH IT WERE ME. I WISH I WERE DEAD.
Yeah.
why ARE WE QUESTIONING THAT GUY?
he's A MURDER SUSPECT.
no, HE'S NOT. HE'S INNOCENT.
what DID YOU SAY?
my BLOOD REPORT BACKED HIS STORY.
Mr. WILSON FOUND HIS STEPDAUGHTER DEAD,
just LIKE I TOLD SERGEANT DOAKES AT THE CRIME SCENE.
you TURNED IN THE BLOOD REPORT? WHEN?
I DON'T KNOW
at SOME POINT BEFORE I WENT HOME LAST NIGHT.
I PUT IT RIGHT ON THE SERGEANT'S DESK,
just LIKE HE ASKED.
the GREEN FOLDER.
Yeah, ACCORDING TO MY FINDINGS,
the MIST ON THE STEPFATHER'S SHIRT WAS EXHALED
from THE VICTIM WHEN HE TRIED TO REVIVE HER.
the AUTOPSY CONFIRMED SHE HAD SEVERE INTERNAL BLEEDING,
due TO THE BLUDGEONING.
Yeah, BUT HE COULD HAVE BEATEN HER FIRST.
that's IMPOSSIBLE.
the CRIME-SCENE PHOTOS SHOW BLOOD RADIATING OUTWARD
around THE VICTIM'S BODY.
that KIND OF BLUDGEONING WOULD HAVE COVERED THE REAL KILLER
in BLOOD FROM HEAD TO TOE.
Thanks.
Mr. WILSON, YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
what THE HELL? LIEUTENANT, THIS MAN IS A KILLER.
this MAN HAS BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.
there's AN OFFICER IN THE HALLWAY.
he'll SEE THAT YOU GET YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS BACK
and TAKE YOU HOME.
thank YOU, MA'AM. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
trying TO SAVE YOUR CAREER, JAMES, IF IT ISN'T TOO LATE.
did YOU EVEN CHECK THE BLOOD REPORT?
I DIDN'T GET THE BLOOD REPORT.
it's ON YOUR DESK, AND IT EXONERATES YOUR SUSPECT.
we SHOULD BE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THE REAL KILLER.
Maria, THAT IS NOT WHAT HE TOLD ME AT
that MOTHERFUCKER.
he's GOOD.
who?
he PLANNED THIS WHOLE THING.
Maria, THAT PSYCHOPATH SET ME UP.
Dexter AGAIN? YOU'RE BLAMING DEXTER FOR THIS?
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW PATHETIC THAT SOUNDS?
this IS NOT ABOUT DEXTER!
this IS ABOUT THE POOR JUDGMENT YOU HAVE BEEN DISPLAYING
in THIS DEPARTMENT FOR MONTHS NOW!
you WANT TO WORK OUT?
no.
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THE GYM.
you're SWEET, BUT I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD.
so, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
uh...
I THINK I WANT TO BREAK UP.
for REAL?
Yeah.
is THAT OKAY?
no.
no, IT'S NOT OKAY.
fuck, WHAT DID I DO, DEB?
nothing. I SWEAR TO GOD.
YOU'RE...SMOKING HOT AND...FUN
AND...SOULFUL AND...
age-appropriate.
and BUT WHAT?
but...
sometimes THE TRUTH SPEAKS FROM A PEACEFUL PLACE.
it's TAKEN ME A LONG TIME TO FIND THAT PLACE,
but I THINK I HAVE,
and IT'S TELLING ME YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME.
I'm SO SORRY.
you LIVE IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD.
Yeah, I HAD NO IDEA.
I'm USUALLY PASSING BY AT 35 MILES PER HOUR.
I'm NOT A REAL BIG WALKER.
everybody WALKS IN LONDON.
of COURSE, THEY'RE USUALLY WALKING TO THE PUB.
how FAR ARE WE GOING?
Oh, YOU'RE A BIT GRUMPY TONIGHT.
what's WRONG?
come ON. DON'T CLOSE UP ON ME NOW.
no, I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, THANKS TO YOU, THINGS ARE...
actually LOOKING UP.
some PEOPLE AT WORK HAVE BEEN...AFTER ME.
I THINK I HAVE 'EM UNDER CONTROL.
so, WHY THE GROUCHINESS?
is IT BECAUSE YOUR SISTER THINKS I'M A TROLLOP?
it's NOT JUST...DEB.
it's THE SUDDENNESS OF ALL OF THIS
losing RITA, THE KIDS.
they've BEEN THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME HUMAN
for A LONG TIME.
were THEY KEEPING YOU HUMAN, THOUGH,
or WERE THEY THE ONES MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE THE MONSTER
that YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?
keep GOING.
your FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE TO ACCEPT YOU
for WHO YOU'RE EVOLVING INTO NOW THAT YOU'RE CLEAN.
is THAT WHAT I AM
clean?
cause I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY AT ALL.
no, YOU CERTAINLY DON'T.
Mmm, GOD.
I WISH I COULD FUCK YOU RIGHT NOW.
whose HOUSE IS THIS?
couldn't TELL YOU.
God.
he's A MAN OF MANY TALENTS.
Ah!
look. I'M SOME OLD BITCH.
better NOT PRESS OUR LUCK. WE SHOULD GO.
Hello?
Hi, Dexter.
can YOU COME TO MY SCHOOL TOMORROW?
what's AT YOUR SCHOOL, BUDDY?
I'm doing my cultural report.
saudi ARABIA.
can YOU WATCH ME? I'M KIND OF SCARED.
Cody, what are you doing?
who IS THIS?
Hello?
who WAS THAT?
Rita's SON.
he WANTS ME TO COME SEE HIM AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.
Oh, POOR KID.
he DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE GONE.
I THINK I'LL GO.
whatever YOU THINK'S BEST.
Hey, GUYS!
I'm HOME!
Hello?
they're IN BED.
why SO EARLY?
Cody IS BEING PUNISHED FOR SNEAKING AWAY
to MAKE A PHONE CALL WITHOUT PERMISSION.
Astor JOINED HIM IN A MISGUIDED SHOW OF SUPPORT.
well, WHO WAS CODY CALLING?
the BOY WAS TRYING TO INVITE HIM TO HIS SCHOOL.
can YOU IMAGINE? OH.
mom, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK.
I MADE A PHONE CALL OF MY OWN TODAY.
I SPOKE WITH AUNT CECILIA.
she TOLD ME THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FIRED YOU ALMOST A YEAR AGO.
we HAD PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES.
the EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS FALLING APART.
school SHOULD BE LIFE ITSELF, NOT A PREPARATION FOR LIVING.
do YOU KNOW THAT THEY GIVE TROPHIES TO EVERY CHILD NOW
whether THEY WIN OR LOSE?
Yeah, I FINALLY GET IT.
it TOOK ME A FEW DECADES, BUT IT'S NOT JUST ME
nobody CAN DEAL WITH YOU.
you DON'T LEAVE ROOM FOR ANYBODY ELSE TO EXIST.
it's NOT MY FAULT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WILLING
to SETTLE FOR MEDIOCRITY.
just LOOK AT YOU -- FIRST PAUL, THEN DEXTER.
Rita, YOU LACK EVEN COMMON SENSE,
and NOW YOU'RE PASSING THAT TORCH OF ORDINARY CHARACTER
on TO YOUR CHILDREN.
shut THE FUCK UP.
nobody TALKS ABOUT MY KIDS THAT WAY.
Thatagirl.
that's WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE.
Yeah! I'M DONE WITH YOU.
no, YOU'RE NOT.
but YOU GO -- YOU GIVE ME HELL.
no.
no, I WON'T DO THAT.
I WON'T LET YOU TURN ME INTO...YOU.
Rita -- HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
first THING IN THE MORNING,
you're GONNA PACK UP AND GO HOME.
you'll COME AND VISIT US FOR BIRTHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS,
but YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE WITH US ANYMORE.
well...
...if THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SACRIFICE
to GET YOU ON YOUR FEET...
kill ONE MAN, AND YOU'RE A MURDERER.
kill THOUSANDS, A CONQUEROR.
kill THEM ALL, AND YOU'RE A GOD.
does IT SOUND TO YOU LIKE OUR GUY
has A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER,
a CLASSIC GOD COMPLEX?
I THINK YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING, ANGEL.
to TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY ALTER EGO HAD IN MIND WHEN HE WROTE THAT CRAP.
I JUST PULLED FROM VARIOUS BLOGS ON THE INTERNET, MIXED AND MATCHED -- PRESTO MANIFESTO.
you FINALLY DECIDED TO FIGHT BACK.
I BEEN WAITING.
hope YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO COMMENT ON THAT
so YOU CAN RECORD IT ON YOUR HIDDEN TAPE RECORDER.
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY.
you MIGHT HAVE BEEN, FOR ALL I KNOW.
your PAST IS A BIGGER MYSTERY THAN FUCKING JIMMY HOFFA.
I TRIED EVERY AVENUE, LEGAL AND OTHERWISE,
but THERE AIN'T NO PAPER TRAIL
on THE EARLY YEARS OF DEXTER MORGAN.
I GUESS THERE'S NO RECORDER RUNNING, AFTER ALL.
no, MAN.
unlike YOU, I DO EVERYTHING OUT IN THE OPEN.
well, IN THAT CASE, SERGEANT,
let ME PUT THIS IN THE OPEN FOR YOU.
no MATTER WHAT YOU TRY, NO MATTER WHEN,
no MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORK,
I'll ALWAYS BE A STEP AHEAD OF YOU FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON.
and WHAT'S THAT?
I OWN YOU.
Aah!
Aah! FUCK!
get HIM OFF OF ME! GET OFF ME!
why ARE YOU DOING THIS?!
stop!
I WANT YOUR GUN, YOUR BADGE, AND YOUR POLICE I. D.
I WANT YOUR ACCESS CARD, TOO
now!
type A STATEMENT THAT SERGEANT DOAKES
is ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE,
pending AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION.
you TWO, GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
Thanks.
what THE HELL HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST...JUMPED ME.
that GUY'S ALWAYS HAD IT OUT FOR ME.
thanks FOR MEETING WITH ME, DON.
well, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POINT IS.
the DISTRICT COURT INJUNCTION HEARING STARTS IN THREE HOURS.
which EVERYONE HERE KNOWS WE'RE GOING TO LOSE.
don't LOOK SO SHOCKED. WE ALWAYS LOSE THESE THINGS.
you BASTARDS AND YOUR FREE SPEECH.
my BOSS NEVER LETS ME SAY ANYTHING.
I'll TELL YOU WHAT
I WILL AGREE TO DROPPING THE INJUNCTION,
which WILL SAVE US DAYS OF COURTROOM ARGUMENTS
and A BOATLOAD OF LEGAL FEES,
if WE CAN AGREE ON SOME SIMPLE GROUND RULES
on HOW YOU PUBLISH THAT DOCUMENT.
ground RULES.
we're NOT GONNA HAVE ANY GROUND RULES.
my ONLY GOAL HERE IS TO AVOID COMPROMISING AN INVESTIGATION
of A MASS MURDERER...
who COULD HURT A LOT MORE PEOPLE.
give ME JUST A SECOND, WILL YOU, FRANK?
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT THOSE ASSHOLES
to PUBLISH THE MANIFESTO WITHOUT THE VICTIMS' NAMES
and AS A PAGE-3 STORY.
no SENSE HYPING IT.
it MIGHT JUST INSPIRE THE KILLER TO GREATER HEIGHTS.
wait.
it's QUIET HERE...
peaceful.
it's A GOOD SPOT.
for WHAT?
it's 1: 00.
so IT IS.
I BROUGHT MY OWN SANDWICH.
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE QUIET, MORGAN.
I DIDN'T.
I DON'T.
when I'M ALONE AND IT'S QUIET, I GET SCARED...
shitless,
like I START HEARING WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON INSIDE.
I SEE.
so IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU,
maybe I CAN JUST PRACTICE WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.
okay.
cause WHEN YOU'RE AROUND,
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I CAN DEAL WITH ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?
like WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
I DON'T HAVE TO RUN FROM IT.
I DON'T HAVE TO JUMP INTO BED WITH SOME GUY AND HIDE THERE.
you GIVE ME STRENGTH.
I'm KIND OF OPENING UP HERE.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
you're THE FUCKING ZEN MASTER. FIGURE IT OUT.
I've GOT PLAQUE IN MY ARTERIES.
I KNOW THE LYRICS TO ELEVATOR MUSIC.
my HAIR ISN'T GETTING ANY THICKER.
you're GONNA DO GREAT UP THERE.
you JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING
they're MORE FRIGHTENED THAN YOU ARE.
no, THEY'RE NOT.
are SO.
you're GONNA BE STARING AT THEM THE WHOLE TIME.
if ONE OF THOSE UNSUSPECTING MOMS OR DADS
does SOMETHING EMBARRASSING WHILE YOU'RE UP ON STAGE...
like PICK THEIR NOSE?
...you're GONNA BE THE ONE WHO SEES IT.
Yeah.
now THAT'S POWER.
now GO HAVE FUN.
Dexter, OVER HERE. WE SAVED YOU A SEAT.
Thanks, GUYS.
there YOU GO -- $18, 000.
I'll SEND A TRUCK FOR THE PIECE TOMORROW.
I AM TELLING YOU, LILA,
this IS GOING TO CREATE A CRITICAL MASS FOR YOU.
according TO THE PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS
of THE MANIFESTO,
our KILLER IS A WHITE MALE IN HIS 50s.
what ELSE?
uh, THE KILLER HAS NO GIRLFRIENDS
and CONSIDERS HIMSELF A GOOD CATHOLIC.
hold ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
how CAN YOU TELL ALL THAT BY PUTTING WORDS IN A COMPUTER?
I DON'T KNOW, DUDE. IT'S SCIENCE.
how 'BOUT COMMON SENSE?
I THINK THE GUY THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS PISSED OFF AT GOD,
and THAT'S WHY HE KILLS PEOPLE.
Really? I ACTUALLY FOUND HIM VERY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.
Yeah, LIKE A MODERN-DAY REVOLUTIONARY.
which WOULD SUGGEST THAT HE'S KILLING FOR SOCIAL CHANGE.
this IS WHAT HE WANTS.
what's THAT?
confusion, CHAOS
it's WHAT THE KILLER WANTS.
he's ALWAYS BEEN AN INTENSELY PRIVATE FIGURE,
dispatching VICTIMS SILENTLY.
now HE'S SUDDENLY A MEDIA WHORE? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
he's CREATING A CLUSTERFUCK.
very GOOD, OFFICER MORGAN.
the KILLER'S MAKING US CHASE OUR TAILS.
you KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
he KNOWS HOW WE WORK.
look HOW HE HITS EVERY MAJOR THEME
political, ENVIRONMENTAL, RELIGIOUS.
in ONE SECTION, HE MANAGES TO WEAVE TOGETHER JULIUS CAESAR,
berlin, GERMANY, THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS, AND GANDHI.
it's SCATTERSHOT.
he KNEW THAT THIS WOULD SEND US SCURRYING
like SQUIRRELS FOR NUTS.
Yeah, BUT TO SUGGEST THAT HE MIGHT BE ONE OF US
how CAN YOU BE SURE?
Hi, I'M CODY, AND I RESEARCHED SAUDI ARABIA
for MY CULTURAL REPORT.
my BOARD IS COVERED IN SAND
because SAUDI ARABIA IS ONE BIG DESERT.
as YOU CAN SEE, I USED COFFEE BEANS TO WRITE "SAUDI ARABIA.
arabic COFFEE IS VERY FAMOUS.
I'm A LITTLE CONFUSED.
Lila IS THE ONE SHOWING ME HOW TO TAKE CONTROL, STOP KILLING, GET MY LIFE CLEAN.
but THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE I WENT INTO RECOVERY THAT I ACTUALLY FEEL CLEAN.
the CHILDREN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE JUST LIKE US,
because THEY...
this IS THE SAUDI ARABIAN FLAG.
the ARABIC LETTERS MEAN "THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ALLAH.
do YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH IT IS FOR A WOMAN IN SAUDI ARABIA?
they CAN'T DRIVE OR HAVE POWERFUL JOBS.
or GET THIS -- THEY CAN'T EVEN GO TO THE MOVIES
without MEN'S PERMISSION.
after THEY TURN 12, THEY HAVE TO WEAR LONG BLACK SLEEVES,
and THEY CAN'T HARDLY EVEN TALK TO MEN UNTIL THEY GET MARRIED.
the NEW KING, ABDULLAH,
is TRYING TO CHANGE SOME OLD BAD RULES,
so WOMEN CAN DO MORE THINGS...
thank YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING.
or, AS THEY SAY IN ARABIC, "SHOKRAN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW CALM YOU WERE UP THERE.
Yeah, YOU WERE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL TALKER.
you WERE PRETTY GOOD.
can DEXTER COME FOR ICE CREAM WITH US?
can HE, MOM, PLEASE?
UH...SURE, DEXTER CAN JOIN US.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.
maybe THEY'LL HAVE SOME DELICIOUS SAUDI FLAVORS,
like SAND OR OIL.
hang ON A SEC, GUYS.
hello.
are YOU HURT?
O-okay, OKAY. I'M COMING NOW.
I KNOW. ME TOO.
come ON, KIDS. DEXTER WON'T BE JOINING US.
Rita, IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
look, I'M SO SORRY, YOU GUYS.
I'm GONNA MAKE IT UP TO YOU,
but I GOT TO HELP A FRIEND WHO'S IN TROUBLE.
there WAS A FIRE AT HER PLACE.
I'm SO SORRY.
Hey, LET'S GO.
what HAPPENED?
I WAS WORKING ON MY PIECE WITH THE BLOWTORCH,
and IT JUST CAUGHT FIRE. I WAS SO SCARED.
Oh, I GUESS SO.
promise ME THAT YOU WON'T LEAVE ME,
that YOU WON'T GO ANYWHERE.
I'm NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
Hey, YOU GOT YOUR LIGHT FIXED.
Previously,on Dexter...
God, you're on fire.
Oh, shit. - What?
I'm pregnant.
I just got word Angel will be detective sergeant Batista.
Fred Bowman, A.K. A.Freebo, kills two college girls and escapes on a state police screw-up.
looking to hold some product.
I need a hit.
did you hear what I said?
fuck off, Teegan.
fine, I guess your dick can suck itself from now on!
freebo, get back here!
who are you? - Who are you?
I got it, Dex. - Got what?
only the case that's gonna get me my shield. It's huge.
angel put me on it.
who he is what makes this case huge.
it's Miguel Prado, assistant district attorney.
he and Laguerta go way back.
the other guy's Ramon Prado, Miguel's middle brother.
he's a lieutenant with the sheriff's department.
and... Oscar.
as in baby brother.
I've never killed anyone I didn't completely vet before, whose guilt I wasn't absolutely certain of.
Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo.
then he tried to kill me.
he's gotta be guilty of something.
why would a blood spatter analyst spend time searching for information on my dead brother?
this one, this death got to me.
Morgan, right? - Do I know you?
Yuki Amado, internal affairs. - And?
you know Joey Quinn?
I'm gonna do you a favor.
call this guy, tell him you wanna cash in one of my coupons.
he's an informant from my days in narcotics.
you're Anton?
you got something you need to show me?
what about this prado guy?
Oh, yeah, I've seen him before.
Oscar prado was into freebo for some serious cash.
you getting along with the new boss man?
Ah, fuck him. He took me off the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.
some dead-end jane doe.
Teegan. Freebo's girlfriend.
looks like he's still in Miami.
but right now, all I see are little bundles of uncertainty.
and germs. But that's another matter.
I love kids.
I can play with them, enjoy them...
and leave.
I don't have to worry about what they'll become.
a nobel prize laureate.
a drunk.
president of the united states.
or someone like me.
why do parents take the chance?
I've never felt compelled.
but why would I? I'm not in the business of giving life.
it's for sure. I'm pregnant, heh.
what should we do?
I don't know.
we should talk. Weight all the options.
together.
I have to get to work.
weighing options. The pros and cons.
something I'm good at, usually.
what the fuck, Dex? I was yelling at you to hold the elevator, ass-wipe.
sorry, I'm feeling off.
so see a doctor.
saw one.
really didn't help.
the Oscar Prado case?
Yeah, fuckers are on the career-maker of the year.
they nail this Freebo guy and they're golden.
the courts already let Freebo go once for those two girls in the everglades.
that was then. This time, he killed a senior A. D.A.'S brother.
afternoon fix.
except he didn't kill Oscar. I did.
if it hadn't been for freebo, oscar would still be alive, and I wouldn't be in this mess.
besides, he's seen my face.
I've gotta find Freebo before they do.
that's one thing I'm sure of, at least.
nice watch. Knockoff?
me? No. Real thing only. I sold a kidney to get it.
I'll show you the scar sometime.
I'll give you a kidney not to.
Hey, Dex, do me a favor.
go over the Prado blood evidence one more time, okay?
maybe you missed something. - Okay, but
sergeant! - Yeah?
we got narcotics on the line. - All right.
Hey, Dex, wait up.
my jane doe.
see what you see.
already saw what I saw, which was nothing.
so see what you see again.
I can't afford none solved, and I've got fuck-all on this.
coroner says he found a pharmacy in her.
big surprise, right?
body dumped near the waterfront stroll. Shocker.
looks like every other tweaker hooker case.
except the tattoo peeled off her shoulder.
coroner says not a tattoo.
you're getting interested.
actually, I'm getting sleepy.
it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one at sea.
I could throw them a line, tell them their cases are linked.
that jane doe is actually Freebo's girlfriend.
that it was Freebo who killed her.
but I need the head start.
step away from the incense.
this is America, buddy.
freedom of religion.
I didn't realize you were a buddhist, Vince. Japanese are traditionally Shinto.
Really? Oh, whatever.
I bought all this shit off my manicurist.
need all the luck I can get.
got a crucifix up there too.
cause it did so much for Jesus?
cause forensics quarterly is deciding whether or not to publish my article.
you know, the one you read. And proofed.
the incense stays.
did he use you at the doctor's office?
but you've got to use me, Maria.
A. D.A. S can put pressure on other agencies.
we have Ramon, who's with the sheriff's department. Together, we.
Miguel, Miguel, tranquillo.
I know that you and Ramon are going to help.
and it's hard to let somebody else handle Oscar's case.
but I have my best detectives on this.
I got the best forensics team-- - Morgan, right?
he's part of it.
we are tracking down every one of freebo's known associates
looking under every rock.
we will find him.
this is a good team.
this is the same team, by the way, that shared a roof with the bay harbor butcher.
that was totally out of line. I'm--I'm sorry, Maria.
it's just that my-- my fuse is so short ever since Oscar.
even with Syl. I'm driving her nuts.
I doubt that.
she knows what she's got.
the bay harbor butcher situation-- - no, don't
no, please.
I was too personally involved to see it clearly.
and that's why I've distanced myself from things.
you should do the same with Oscar.
I know.
I know. You're right.
some things never change.
we're not as close as we used to be.
but at least I still have you as a colleague.
and I'm glad that it's you that's here.
gracias.
Miguel Prado's already seen too much of me.
I can't comfort the grieving.
you got this?
I got this.
don't look familiar, hon.
Ooh, but those are some fine streaks.
who did her hair?
christophe of Beverly fuckin' hills.
Yeah, do you have his number?
Petunia, you are the dumbest whore on this stroll.
sorry, sugar. Don't got a name for you.
keep walkin', girl.
it's all you're good for.
they give you any leads?
it's officer Morgan to you.
right, not a detective yet.
course, an unsolved isn't gonna get you any closer to a shield.
look, I don't know why I.A. picked me, but
cause detective Quinn likes the ladies.
well, then you don't need a snitch. You need a fuckin' slut.
so why don't you go talk to petunia over there?
I can get you a shield tomorrow.
I'm a sergeant, after all.
you'd give me a shield for being a rat?
no, for being an honest cop, Debra.
like your father.
you are not god damn digging into my father right now.
digging? Please.
the old-timers at I. A.Talk about him like he's a brother.
well, the old-timers also talk about how popular that made him.
Oh, god. That really matters to you, doesn't it?
your cop friends.
it's your whole life. Them, the job, the shield.
far as I can tell, without that, you've got nothing.
except your, uh, treadmill.
kind of cunt, aren't you?
nice.
but seriously, um, you should look into expanding your world a little.
you know, finding something else fulfilling. Like...
gardening or, um...
Ooh, scrapbooking.
just in case.
get me a name.
drove a Volkswagen rabbit.
that should buy me an address for her.
if I'm lucky, she left me a lead to Freebo.
how many parents would give their kid a name like that?
Florida.
Nope. Nope. Bingo.
teegan Campbell. Address on sorority row.
guess I know what I'm doing tonight.
no, not a name I'd choose. Megan. Mary. Those are classics.
or, for a boy, Charles...
or Philip.
or Richard.
or what's so bad about...
Dexter, jr?
reminds me of you, Dex.
the last person I'd turn to for advice on fatherhood.
old habits die hard.
gotta focus on something easier to kill.
freebo.
Dexter!
shit.
sorry, I'd rather go rifle through a dead girl's apartment.
Dexter. We, uh...
I never really got to thank you for, uh, coming to oscar's wake.
it really means a lot to me and my family, knowing that you are taking a personal interest in the case.
okay. Well, you're welcome.
uh, what are you doing tonight?
nothing.
Oh, well, then, you'll come for dinner.
I rarely take no for an answer. You're gonna learn that about me.
I will. - Honestly, uh...
I wanna pick your brain about something.
and syl and I, uh, you know, we could-- we could use the company.
the more people around, the less we think about, you know.
sure. - You married? You got kids?
no. No kids. Uh, girlfriend.
Ah, bueno, bueno. Bring her.
unless you were lying.
you know, about doing nothing tonight.
we're gonna towel off, and we'll be right back.
officer Morgan, a music lover.
you ever seen this woman?
Quinn send you?
different case.
my debt's to quinn.
your debt's with the department.
I'm not an information ATM.
I'm fucking desperate! All right?
I got a steaming heap of crap all on this case.
I'm gone through every scum-sucking ball sack of a pimp I know, every whacked-out hooker.
you are my last-ditch ass-fucked effort!
God damn, you got a mouth on you, woman.
great, thank you.
it's cool. Show me the picture.
not from the neighborhood.
but from the looks of her, I doubt she had to pay cash for her habit.
so I'm looking for a dealer who'll take payment in sex.
Yeah. That'll be about all of them.
Yeah.
look, I can ask around for you, okay?
thank you. I'd appreciate it.
but you should stay.
grab a drink and work some of that massive tension out on the dance floor.
well, you know what? It smells like armpits in here.
and I got a lot of work to do.
well, you know, there is more to life than policing.
so I've heard!
if we had a house this big, it would make sense to have another child.
it's a valuable lot.
look at the lawn. It's so thick.
be a great place for kids to play.
zenith zoysia. Thrives in warm weather.
I'm not talking about grass, Dexter.
you're not?
I've been trying to talk about the pregnancy the whole way here.
maybe you should be a little less subtle in the future.
I'm trying not to pressure you.
but we have to make a decision before one's made for us.
you're right, I know. Okay.
welcome. I'm so glad you came.
made it. - Yeah.
hello. - I'm Rita.
Miguel. So you've met Sylvia?
syl, please.
so you guys have a beautiful home here.
great place for kids.
come on, I'll give you the tour.
strong family resemblance.
my father.
he was a drunk and a bastard, but he had a distinctive chin.
some people just shouldn't have kids, you know?
wish there were a test.
Yeah. Oscar, he got the-- the best and the worst of dad.
me, I just tried to stay clear, you know?
but, um... I suppose he's in me too.
hard to avoid.
welcome.
I--I shouldn't drink.
what, are you pregnant?
you are. Oh, my god, that's terrific.
Yeah. Yeah.
or not. That sounded really bad.
I meant...
Miguel and I have actually been trying for a while now.
it even took once.
and Miguel, he wants to start a family before he makes his run for the D. A.'S office.
but I don't know.
I'm happy with the way things are.
I don't wanna force Dexter into something.
that's kind of what happened with the ex-husband.
well, that and the fact that he was a sociopath.
I had an ulterior motive for inviting you here tonight.
does it involve charging me with a felony?
no, the truth is, uh, I wanted to talk to someone inside of this investigation.
See,'cause all I keep getting is reassurances, reassurances.
reassurances make me nervous.
you want me to put you at unease?
I want you to be straight with me.
how certain are you that this bastard freebo will be found?
very.
so I'm gonna get my shot at him in court?
well, that could take a while.
no, no, no. No more waiting. I'm done waiting.
is there another option?
I'm an A. D.A. My brother Ramon is a sheriff.
you don't think we got resources?
if our lead pans out, then we'll talk to homicide.
you have a lead? That's great. How can I help?
no, Ramon, you know, he has his own way of doing things. I don't wanna drag you into it.
come on. You're talking to the guy you caught breaking into your brother's secure files.
all right.
well... ramon... may have...
borrowed a cell phone that belonged to Freebo's mother.
he calls mommy...
we can track him.
mother's cell phone. That's good thinking.
it may lead to nothing.
or it may lead them to freebo before I can get to him.
I need to check out teegan's place as soon as I can get out of here.
the hunt.
my vision is much sharper through the eyes of my shadow self.
if only I could see this baby situation as clearly.
I promised rita I'd be back in an hour.
so she's nesting while I'm hunting, stalking my prey.
I'll start with his prey-- Teegan.
what she left behind will talk to me, guide me to him.
or... to a kegger.
what's the password? - There's a password?
I'm just looking for my girl Teegan. Where's her room again?
EW, teegan? Ew, that girl's a ho bag. She's a ho!
she's such a ho bag. She doesn't live here anymore.
she's hoeing off campus, probably living in her ho pad.
how about you give me the address of her ho pad so I can go tell her what a ho bag she is?
you have any party favors? - Oh, yeah.
uh, sorry. I don't have anything on me, but...
we put out. - We totally do.
all right, that is so totally off the hook.
but how about I just trade you for teegan's address?
okay. - Okay.
22 lincoln log.
I suspect that's lincoln lane?
whatever. Let's get high.
you two wait here. I'll go get my stash. - Okay.
the leaders of tomorrow.
their parents must be proud.
how much worse could my child turn out?
do I even wanna know the answer to that question?
teegan's ho pad will have to wait till tomorrow night.
I've got a girlfriend and a baby waiting on my promise to come back.
is this what my life will be like-- making promises I'm not sure I wanna keep?
it's complicated.
the pros and cons of responsibility.
all right. Pros.
can't we just talk?
sometimes lists are easier for me.
give it! It's my turn.
all right, pros.
kids are cute.
mom! - No soccer in the house!
I have to practice!
cons? - Noise.
time... money. Stretch marks. Saggy boobs.
less personal freedom.
personal...
freedom.
all right, I thought I said no soccer in the house.
now just go to your room until it's time for school.
son of a bitch.
what am I even thinking?
Zack adelman? - Yeah.
we need to talk to you about Fred Bowman.
who?
your pal, Freebo.
the dealer you got busted with two years ago.
Oh, yeah. Right, right.
um, yeah, I haven't seen him in, like, uh, two years.
you mind if we come in, Zack?
he actually doesn't have a choice, sergeant. He's a parolee.
Oh, gosh, you're right. - Yeah.
couldn't find anything new on your jane doe, sorry.
how's it going?
backward. I don't even think jane was a hooker.
bummer. So who you looking for?
her dealer.
what the fuck is scrapbooking?
the tradition of putting photos and memorabilia into family keepsake albums, along with relevant journaling.
I don't even want to know how you know that.
so do you know which dealer you're looking
Morgan.
Yeah. Got it. I'll meet you there.
might have found some luck of my own.
the lead on jane's I. D.
as soon as it gets dark, I'm back on the hunt so I can stay ahead of my sister.
this department is becoming annoyingly effective.
you home alone here, Zack?
totally.
get on your knees. Put your hands on your head.
don't move!
W-w-wait! It's just a cat, man.
it's cool, guys! - Shut the fuck up!
Ah, this fuckin' paperwork's gonna take forever.
come on, drop it. Drop it! Come on.
just a few pills, man. What's the big deal?
the big deal is you're making me cancel on a very willing woman.
get on your knees next to your boyfriend.
let's make a deal, then.
let's trade, I-- - stop there, asshole.
we don't got time to process a bribery charge too.
I'm not offering you cash, man.
I've got valuable information.
on Freebo?
even better.
chicky hines.
who the fuck is Chicky Hines?
chicky Hines just went down for a carjacking homicide.
he's waiting on sentencing now.
Yeah, this guy Zack says Hines didn't do the crime.
he's offering up an alibi for hines and another suspect.
I know all about the Chicky Hines case.
he was a big one for the prosecutor, and guess who that was.
shit. - Yeah, Miguel Prado.
so now, not only won't I be bringing him good news about his brother's case.
Worse--I'm gonna undermine his latest conviction.
think that's what he wants to hear right now?
doubtful.
Christ, vet this. Oh, yeah, vet this. Completely.
I wanna be absolutely certain that this is solid before I even think about bringing it to Miguel.
Hey, Angel.
case going all right?
no leads, no insights?
just the pressure, bro.
expected to make decisions, take responsibility.
you don't know what it's like.
probably like finding out your girlfriend's pregnant.
Rita's pregnant?
looks like it.
holy shit. That's fantastic.
it is?
my little girl is the best thing I ever did.
I've messed up a lot.
but in my darkest hours, auri's my light.
you wait and see. - Okay.
thank you. I feel better.
a light.
is that even possible?
higher, daddy!
Dexter, come play with us!
come play with us, daddy.
I'm right behind you, buddy.
you're it, baby.
Cody and Astor would be older, you know.
I like them this age.
I always wanted to be a grandfather.
I think we're better off without you.
well, it's a beautiful family you got there, Dex.
you couldn't picture this, could you?
I could have surprised you.
Yeah, there's no reason it couldn't turn out like this.
what have you done?
where the hell have you been?
street wasn't clear, yo.
I get spotted with you, no more trusty C. I.
fine. What have you got?
all right, department six.
pimp named javier, completely new to the game.
but he already has a rep for his stable of white girls.
if your jane doe is a strawberry, chances are he tried to recruit her.
this is good. Thank you. - Yeah.
you get spotted with me, no more trusty C. I.
Yeah, but he likes 'em white.
does he like 'em strapped?
all right, it's cool. But I'll be here, anything goes sideways.
Miami metro. I'm looking for Javier.
Entra, por favor.
you're a little young to be in business for yourself.
I'm a wonder kid. - Okay.
can you identify this woman?
you'd make a shitload more money on all fours than you do as a cop, mamita.
Oh, like I haven't heard that before.
Hey, look, little one, give me a name for this girl, I won't bust you for being a piece of shit.
never seen her.
besides, she looks too used up to be an earner.
but you, damn, mami.
I could get you a thou a night.
give you some spending money for, uh, extra curricular activities.
think I need to hear that? You sleazy piece of shit!
I'm a cop! That's all I need!
I'm not gonna do any fucking scrapbooking! You got it?
scrapbooking? - You fucked her.
you've seen her?
on his dick.
Hey, she's fading. She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
Oh, I think she does, and I think you fucked a girl who's now dead.
fuck. Look, I picked her up at some party. All right?
I-I-I thought that I could turn her out.
what's her name? - I don't know!
bitch, cunt,"hey, you.
yeah?
this doesn't look good, Javier.
all right, look, I passed her to a friend - who could feed her habit better than I could. - A friend, right.
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, a white guy named Freebo.
Yeah, yeah. He could deal with her shit longer than I could.
maybe he's a patient guy. I don't know.
Yeah, maybe not.
if my first stab at freebo had gone as planned, oscar prado might still be alive, miguel wouldn't know who I was, teegan would have lived to ho another day, and deb wouldn't be chasing a jane doe.
and I wouldn't be watching the clock, counting the minutes till darkness comes, trying to get the jump on my friends in blue.
anything?
uh, running additional dna tests on oscar prado's clothing.
if Freebo's cut himself, his blood could be on these clothes.
slam dunk in court. Is there a chance?
not even remotely. - Good.
any idea what your sister found?
she found something? - I'm asking you.
she left a message saying she was vetting a big lead that's gonna make me happy.
no idea.
got the call. I'm getting published.
Congratulations. The shrine worked.
totally.
freebo just called his mother's cell phone.
I'll have his address by tonight.
and then you will let me deal with him.
Ramon, you've done your job. I'm gonna take it from here, okay?
go be with your family. - Don't fucking sideline me on this, Miguel.
Hey, Maria.
your assistant told me you were here.
what do you have on freebo, maria? - Ramon...
well, we're working on some new angles.
which means you've got shit. - Excuse us.
go home.
cause you're not helping here.
Ramon and his temper. - Yeah, I remember.
but... I get it. I mean, him and Oscar were close.
Miguel, I need to talk to you about something else.
I remember that look.
okay.
he didn't do that carjacking homicide.
we found new evidence, and it checks out, Miguel.
I think you convicted the wrong man.
you're serious?
I was gonna wait, I mean...
the timing is... shit.
but if Hines is innocent, Miguel...
Miguel, I'm sorry.
Oh, this is frustrating and disappointing. And, uh...
I really hate my job right now.
but, hey...
don't ever think about holding back on me. Okay?
just like now, you tell me straight.
that's the maria that I've always counted on.
always can.
when all of this is behind us, I want to get together.
the three of us. You know, as friends. It's long overdue.
night time.
why you think freebo's still in town?
because I think he killed his girlfriend on sunday. Jane doe.
how do you know it's his girlfriend?
the C. I.Gave me a lead. I did some follow-up.
my C. I?
do you have a name for jane yet?
no, but she was strangled, with is consistent with Freebo's M. O.
if you're right, the oscar prado and jane doe cases are linked.
I guess we'll just have to merge them.
Freebo's still out there killing. We've got to catch him fast.
but we got a lead now.
we find the girlfriend's I. D.We find her place, her friends, her family, then we find him.
I'll coordinate with the feds.
Ramos, reach out to street patrol.
Anton is my contact.
if you wear him out or blow his cover
I know how to work a C. I.Quinn.
so unless there's some other reason you don't want me to talk to him...
solid police work, Morgan.
that's how you earn your shield.
Thanks, sarge. - All right.
all right, people. We're gonna be working late on this.
I'll be working late too.
ho pad indeed.
all right, Teegan, tell me where your homicidal beau might be.
hiding out at his dead girlfriend's house? Risky.
then again, it took me a while to find this place, and I knew who I was looking for.
no tools, no syringe, no kill room, no sure thing.
hang tight, Freebo. I'll be back before you know it.
detached garage. Perfect place for a kill room.
M-6 bayonet, vietnam-era. A family keepsake, maybe?
Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.
it's only fitting I use it to complete the task.
shit.
it's time for a decision, Dexter.
having this child is a huge mistake.
I've weighed out all the pros and cons, and all I've got are cons.
I've been thinking the same thing.
I'm keeping it.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
but being a mother was never one of them.
Dexter, I'd rather do this with you.
but I've been a single parent for a long time now, and I think astor and cody prove that I'm pretty damn good at it.
is this you being subtle again?
no, this is me in all sincerity saying I will honor your choice.
this child is happening.
but your role in its life is entirely up to you.
should I take the out rita gave me?
what kind of father would I be? After all, I kill people.
long time, no see.
Oh, god. What the hell is this?
show and tell.
it's been so long since you killed them, I was afraid you'D... forgotten.
Oh, I'm sure teegan is fresh in your mind.
see, now, I didn't-- Fuck!
you killed those girls in the everglades, and you got away with it on a bad warrant.
I love those.
and then teegan came along.
first, you drained her of her self-respect and hope.
then last sunday, you choked the life out of her.
no, last sunday...
I was gettin' high with-- it was Cheri or... Carrie.
she's at--she's at-- she's at Alpha fee.
you seem uncertain.
it's uncomfortable, isn't it?
just when you think you've answered all the questions, another one smacks you in the face.
life, life, life.
life is just like that.
which is why I prefer death.
Dexter? Is that you?
I had the phone records.
well, what are...
is he in there?
alive?
it was self-defense.
I found a forensics lead.
it was a long shot. I wanted to check it out before...
I wasted anyone's time.
I didn't expect freebo to be here.
he surprised me. He jumped me with this knife.
that looks like my father's knife from-- from Vietn.
he gave that to Oscar.
I didn't know what to do. I fought back.
the knife ended up in his neck.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I wasn't sure that I could do this.
but you did. You did.
we're gonna get rid of the evidence.
no. No!
you should leave--now. -No!
plausible deniability.
thank you.
you're welcome.
Previously,on Dexter...
God, you're on fire.
Oh, shit. - What?
I'm pregnant.
I just got word Angel will be detective sergeant Batista.
Fred Bowman, A.K. A.Freebo, kills two college girls and escapes on a state police screw-up.
looking to hold some product.
I need a hit.
did you hear what I said?
fuck off, Teegan.
fine, I guess your dick can suck itself from now on!
freebo, get back here!
who are you? - Who are you?
I got it, Dex. - Got what?
only the case that's gonna get me my shield. It's huge.
angel put me on it.
who he is what makes this case huge.
it's Miguel Prado, assistant district attorney.
he and Laguerta go way back.
the other guy's Ramon Prado, Miguel's middle brother.
he's a lieutenant with the sheriff's department.
and... Oscar.
as in baby brother.
I've never killed anyone I didn't completely vet before, whose guilt I wasn't absolutely certain of.
Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo.
then he tried to kill me.
he's gotta be guilty of something.
why would a blood spatter analyst spend time searching for information on my dead brother?
this one, this death got to me.
Morgan, right? - Do I know you?
Yuki Amado, internal affairs. - And?
you know Joey Quinn?
I'm gonna do you a favor.
call this guy, tell him you wanna cash in one of my coupons.
he's an informant from my days in narcotics.
you're Anton?
you got something you need to show me?
what about this prado guy?
Oh, yeah, I've seen him before.
Oscar prado was into freebo for some serious cash.
you getting along with the new boss man?
Ah, fuck him. He took me off the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.
some dead-end jane doe.
Teegan. Freebo's girlfriend.
looks like he's still in Miami.
but right now, all I see are little bundles of uncertainty.
and germs. But that's another matter.
I love kids.
I can play with them, enjoy them...
and leave.
I don't have to worry about what they'll become.
a nobel prize laureate.
a drunk.
president of the united states.
or someone like me.
why do parents take the chance?
I've never felt compelled.
but why would I? I'm not in the business of giving life.
it's for sure. I'm pregnant, heh.
what should we do?
I don't know.
we should talk. Weight all the options.
together.
I have to get to work.
weighing options. The pros and cons.
something I'm good at, usually.
what the fuck, Dex? I was yelling at you to hold the elevator, ass-wipe.
sorry, I'm feeling off.
so see a doctor.
saw one.
really didn't help.
the Oscar Prado case?
Yeah, fuckers are on the career-maker of the year.
they nail this Freebo guy and they're golden.
the courts already let Freebo go once for those two girls in the everglades.
that was then. This time, he killed a senior A. D.A.'S brother.
afternoon fix.
except he didn't kill Oscar. I did.
if it hadn't been for freebo, oscar would still be alive, and I wouldn't be in this mess.
besides, he's seen my face.
I've gotta find Freebo before they do.
that's one thing I'm sure of, at least.
nice watch. Knockoff?
me? No. Real thing only. I sold a kidney to get it.
I'll show you the scar sometime.
I'll give you a kidney not to.
Hey, Dex, do me a favor.
go over the Prado blood evidence one more time, okay?
maybe you missed something. - Okay, but
sergeant! - Yeah?
we got narcotics on the line. - All right.
Hey, Dex, wait up.
my jane doe.
see what you see.
already saw what I saw, which was nothing.
so see what you see again.
I can't afford none solved, and I've got fuck-all on this.
coroner says he found a pharmacy in her.
big surprise, right?
body dumped near the waterfront stroll. Shocker.
looks like every other tweaker hooker case.
except the tattoo peeled off her shoulder.
coroner says not a tattoo.
you're getting interested.
actually, I'm getting sleepy.
it's reassuring to know I'm not the only one at sea.
I could throw them a line, tell them their cases are linked.
that jane doe is actually Freebo's girlfriend.
that it was Freebo who killed her.
but I need the head start.
step away from the incense.
this is America, buddy.
freedom of religion.
I didn't realize you were a buddhist, Vince. Japanese are traditionally Shinto.
Really? Oh, whatever.
I bought all this shit off my manicurist.
need all the luck I can get.
got a crucifix up there too.
cause it did so much for Jesus?
cause forensics quarterly is deciding whether or not to publish my article.
you know, the one you read. And proofed.
the incense stays.
did he use you at the doctor's office?
but you've got to use me, Maria.
A. D.A. S can put pressure on other agencies.
we have Ramon, who's with the sheriff's department. Together, we.
Miguel, Miguel, tranquillo.
I know that you and Ramon are going to help.
and it's hard to let somebody else handle Oscar's case.
but I have my best detectives on this.
I got the best forensics team-- - Morgan, right?
he's part of it.
we are tracking down every one of freebo's known associates
looking under every rock.
we will find him.
this is a good team.
this is the same team, by the way, that shared a roof with the bay harbor butcher.
that was totally out of line. I'm--I'm sorry, Maria.
it's just that my-- my fuse is so short ever since Oscar.
even with Syl. I'm driving her nuts.
I doubt that.
she knows what she's got.
the bay harbor butcher situation-- - no, don't
no, please.
I was too personally involved to see it clearly.
and that's why I've distanced myself from things.
you should do the same with Oscar.
I know.
I know. You're right.
some things never change.
we're not as close as we used to be.
but at least I still have you as a colleague.
and I'm glad that it's you that's here.
gracias.
Miguel Prado's already seen too much of me.
I can't comfort the grieving.
you got this?
I got this.
don't look familiar, hon.
Ooh, but those are some fine streaks.
who did her hair?
christophe of Beverly fuckin' hills.
Yeah, do you have his number?
Petunia, you are the dumbest whore on this stroll.
sorry, sugar. Don't got a name for you.
keep walkin', girl.
it's all you're good for.
they give you any leads?
it's officer Morgan to you.
right, not a detective yet.
course, an unsolved isn't gonna get you any closer to a shield.
look, I don't know why I.A. picked me, but
cause detective Quinn likes the ladies.
well, then you don't need a snitch. You need a fuckin' slut.
so why don't you go talk to petunia over there?
I can get you a shield tomorrow.
I'm a sergeant, after all.
you'd give me a shield for being a rat?
no, for being an honest cop, Debra.
like your father.
you are not god damn digging into my father right now.
digging? Please.
the old-timers at I. A.Talk about him like he's a brother.
well, the old-timers also talk about how popular that made him.
Oh, god. That really matters to you, doesn't it?
your cop friends.
it's your whole life. Them, the job, the shield.
far as I can tell, without that, you've got nothing.
except your, uh, treadmill.
kind of cunt, aren't you?
nice.
but seriously, um, you should look into expanding your world a little.
you know, finding something else fulfilling. Like...
gardening or, um...
Ooh, scrapbooking.
just in case.
get me a name.
drove a Volkswagen rabbit.
that should buy me an address for her.
if I'm lucky, she left me a lead to Freebo.
how many parents would give their kid a name like that?
Florida.
Nope. Nope. Bingo.
teegan Campbell. Address on sorority row.
guess I know what I'm doing tonight.
no, not a name I'd choose. Megan. Mary. Those are classics.
or, for a boy, Charles...
or Philip.
or Richard.
or what's so bad about...
Dexter, jr?
reminds me of you, Dex.
the last person I'd turn to for advice on fatherhood.
old habits die hard.
gotta focus on something easier to kill.
freebo.
Dexter!
shit.
sorry, I'd rather go rifle through a dead girl's apartment.
Dexter. We, uh...
I never really got to thank you for, uh, coming to oscar's wake.
it really means a lot to me and my family, knowing that you are taking a personal interest in the case.
okay. Well, you're welcome.
uh, what are you doing tonight?
nothing.
Oh, well, then, you'll come for dinner.
I rarely take no for an answer. You're gonna learn that about me.
I will. - Honestly, uh...
I wanna pick your brain about something.
and syl and I, uh, you know, we could-- we could use the company.
the more people around, the less we think about, you know.
sure. - You married? You got kids?
no. No kids. Uh, girlfriend.
Ah, bueno, bueno. Bring her.
unless you were lying.
you know, about doing nothing tonight.
we're gonna towel off, and we'll be right back.
officer Morgan, a music lover.
you ever seen this woman?
Quinn send you?
different case.
my debt's to quinn.
your debt's with the department.
I'm not an information ATM.
I'm fucking desperate! All right?
I got a steaming heap of crap all on this case.
I'm gone through every scum-sucking ball sack of a pimp I know, every whacked-out hooker.
you are my last-ditch ass-fucked effort!
God damn, you got a mouth on you, woman.
great, thank you.
it's cool. Show me the picture.
not from the neighborhood.
but from the looks of her, I doubt she had to pay cash for her habit.
so I'm looking for a dealer who'll take payment in sex.
Yeah. That'll be about all of them.
Yeah.
look, I can ask around for you, okay?
thank you. I'd appreciate it.
but you should stay.
grab a drink and work some of that massive tension out on the dance floor.
well, you know what? It smells like armpits in here.
and I got a lot of work to do.
well, you know, there is more to life than policing.
so I've heard!
if we had a house this big, it would make sense to have another child.
it's a valuable lot.
look at the lawn. It's so thick.
be a great place for kids to play.
zenith zoysia. Thrives in warm weather.
I'm not talking about grass, Dexter.
you're not?
I've been trying to talk about the pregnancy the whole way here.
maybe you should be a little less subtle in the future.
I'm trying not to pressure you.
but we have to make a decision before one's made for us.
you're right, I know. Okay.
welcome. I'm so glad you came.
made it. - Yeah.
hello. - I'm Rita.
Miguel. So you've met Sylvia?
syl, please.
so you guys have a beautiful home here.
great place for kids.
come on, I'll give you the tour.
strong family resemblance.
my father.
he was a drunk and a bastard, but he had a distinctive chin.
some people just shouldn't have kids, you know?
wish there were a test.
Yeah. Oscar, he got the-- the best and the worst of dad.
me, I just tried to stay clear, you know?
but, um... I suppose he's in me too.
hard to avoid.
welcome.
I--I shouldn't drink.
what, are you pregnant?
you are. Oh, my god, that's terrific.
Yeah. Yeah.
or not. That sounded really bad.
I meant...
Miguel and I have actually been trying for a while now.
it even took once.
and Miguel, he wants to start a family before he makes his run for the D. A.'S office.
but I don't know.
I'm happy with the way things are.
I don't wanna force Dexter into something.
that's kind of what happened with the ex-husband.
well, that and the fact that he was a sociopath.
I had an ulterior motive for inviting you here tonight.
does it involve charging me with a felony?
no, the truth is, uh, I wanted to talk to someone inside of this investigation.
See,'cause all I keep getting is reassurances, reassurances.
reassurances make me nervous.
you want me to put you at unease?
I want you to be straight with me.
how certain are you that this bastard freebo will be found?
very.
so I'm gonna get my shot at him in court?
well, that could take a while.
no, no, no. No more waiting. I'm done waiting.
is there another option?
I'm an A. D.A. My brother Ramon is a sheriff.
you don't think we got resources?
if our lead pans out, then we'll talk to homicide.
you have a lead? That's great. How can I help?
no, Ramon, you know, he has his own way of doing things. I don't wanna drag you into it.
come on. You're talking to the guy you caught breaking into your brother's secure files.
all right.
well... ramon... may have...
borrowed a cell phone that belonged to Freebo's mother.
he calls mommy...
we can track him.
mother's cell phone. That's good thinking.
it may lead to nothing.
or it may lead them to freebo before I can get to him.
I need to check out teegan's place as soon as I can get out of here.
the hunt.
my vision is much sharper through the eyes of my shadow self.
if only I could see this baby situation as clearly.
I promised rita I'd be back in an hour.
so she's nesting while I'm hunting, stalking my prey.
I'll start with his prey-- Teegan.
what she left behind will talk to me, guide me to him.
or... to a kegger.
what's the password? - There's a password?
I'm just looking for my girl Teegan. Where's her room again?
EW, teegan? Ew, that girl's a ho bag. She's a ho!
she's such a ho bag. She doesn't live here anymore.
she's hoeing off campus, probably living in her ho pad.
how about you give me the address of her ho pad so I can go tell her what a ho bag she is?
you have any party favors? - Oh, yeah.
uh, sorry. I don't have anything on me, but...
we put out. - We totally do.
all right, that is so totally off the hook.
but how about I just trade you for teegan's address?
okay. - Okay.
22 lincoln log.
I suspect that's lincoln lane?
whatever. Let's get high.
you two wait here. I'll go get my stash. - Okay.
the leaders of tomorrow.
their parents must be proud.
how much worse could my child turn out?
do I even wanna know the answer to that question?
teegan's ho pad will have to wait till tomorrow night.
I've got a girlfriend and a baby waiting on my promise to come back.
is this what my life will be like-- making promises I'm not sure I wanna keep?
it's complicated.
the pros and cons of responsibility.
all right. Pros.
can't we just talk?
sometimes lists are easier for me.
give it! It's my turn.
all right, pros.
kids are cute.
mom! - No soccer in the house!
I have to practice!
cons? - Noise.
time... money. Stretch marks. Saggy boobs.
less personal freedom.
personal...
freedom.
all right, I thought I said no soccer in the house.
now just go to your room until it's time for school.
son of a bitch.
what am I even thinking?
Zack adelman? - Yeah.
we need to talk to you about Fred Bowman.
who?
your pal, Freebo.
the dealer you got busted with two years ago.
Oh, yeah. Right, right.
um, yeah, I haven't seen him in, like, uh, two years.
you mind if we come in, Zack?
he actually doesn't have a choice, sergeant. He's a parolee.
Oh, gosh, you're right. - Yeah.
couldn't find anything new on your jane doe, sorry.
how's it going?
backward. I don't even think jane was a hooker.
bummer. So who you looking for?
her dealer.
what the fuck is scrapbooking?
the tradition of putting photos and memorabilia into family keepsake albums, along with relevant journaling.
I don't even want to know how you know that.
so do you know which dealer you're looking
Morgan.
Yeah. Got it. I'll meet you there.
might have found some luck of my own.
the lead on jane's I. D.
as soon as it gets dark, I'm back on the hunt so I can stay ahead of my sister.
this department is becoming annoyingly effective.
you home alone here, Zack?
totally.
get on your knees. Put your hands on your head.
don't move!
W-w-wait! It's just a cat, man.
it's cool, guys! - Shut the fuck up!
Ah, this fuckin' paperwork's gonna take forever.
come on, drop it. Drop it! Come on.
just a few pills, man. What's the big deal?
the big deal is you're making me cancel on a very willing woman.
get on your knees next to your boyfriend.
let's make a deal, then.
let's trade, I-- - stop there, asshole.
we don't got time to process a bribery charge too.
I'm not offering you cash, man.
I've got valuable information.
on Freebo?
even better.
chicky hines.
who the fuck is Chicky Hines?
chicky Hines just went down for a carjacking homicide.
he's waiting on sentencing now.
Yeah, this guy Zack says Hines didn't do the crime.
he's offering up an alibi for hines and another suspect.
I know all about the Chicky Hines case.
he was a big one for the prosecutor, and guess who that was.
shit. - Yeah, Miguel Prado.
so now, not only won't I be bringing him good news about his brother's case.
Worse--I'm gonna undermine his latest conviction.
think that's what he wants to hear right now?
doubtful.
Christ, vet this. Oh, yeah, vet this. Completely.
I wanna be absolutely certain that this is solid before I even think about bringing it to Miguel.
Hey, Angel.
case going all right?
no leads, no insights?
just the pressure, bro.
expected to make decisions, take responsibility.
you don't know what it's like.
probably like finding out your girlfriend's pregnant.
Rita's pregnant?
looks like it.
holy shit. That's fantastic.
it is?
my little girl is the best thing I ever did.
I've messed up a lot.
but in my darkest hours, auri's my light.
you wait and see. - Okay.
thank you. I feel better.
a light.
is that even possible?
higher, daddy!
Dexter, come play with us!
come play with us, daddy.
I'm right behind you, buddy.
you're it, baby.
Cody and Astor would be older, you know.
I like them this age.
I always wanted to be a grandfather.
I think we're better off without you.
well, it's a beautiful family you got there, Dex.
you couldn't picture this, could you?
I could have surprised you.
Yeah, there's no reason it couldn't turn out like this.
what have you done?
where the hell have you been?
street wasn't clear, yo.
I get spotted with you, no more trusty C. I.
fine. What have you got?
all right, department six.
pimp named javier, completely new to the game.
but he already has a rep for his stable of white girls.
if your jane doe is a strawberry, chances are he tried to recruit her.
this is good. Thank you. - Yeah.
you get spotted with me, no more trusty C. I.
Yeah, but he likes 'em white.
does he like 'em strapped?
all right, it's cool. But I'll be here, anything goes sideways.
Miami metro. I'm looking for Javier.
Entra, por favor.
you're a little young to be in business for yourself.
I'm a wonder kid. - Okay.
can you identify this woman?
you'd make a shitload more money on all fours than you do as a cop, mamita.
Oh, like I haven't heard that before.
Hey, look, little one, give me a name for this girl, I won't bust you for being a piece of shit.
never seen her.
besides, she looks too used up to be an earner.
but you, damn, mami.
I could get you a thou a night.
give you some spending money for, uh, extra curricular activities.
think I need to hear that? You sleazy piece of shit!
I'm a cop! That's all I need!
I'm not gonna do any fucking scrapbooking! You got it?
scrapbooking? - You fucked her.
you've seen her?
on his dick.
Hey, she's fading. She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
Oh, I think she does, and I think you fucked a girl who's now dead.
fuck. Look, I picked her up at some party. All right?
I-I-I thought that I could turn her out.
what's her name? - I don't know!
bitch, cunt,"hey, you.
yeah?
this doesn't look good, Javier.
all right, look, I passed her to a friend - who could feed her habit better than I could. - A friend, right.
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, a white guy named Freebo.
Yeah, yeah. He could deal with her shit longer than I could.
maybe he's a patient guy. I don't know.
Yeah, maybe not.
if my first stab at freebo had gone as planned, oscar prado might still be alive, miguel wouldn't know who I was, teegan would have lived to ho another day, and deb wouldn't be chasing a jane doe.
and I wouldn't be watching the clock, counting the minutes till darkness comes, trying to get the jump on my friends in blue.
anything?
uh, running additional dna tests on oscar prado's clothing.
if Freebo's cut himself, his blood could be on these clothes.
slam dunk in court. Is there a chance?
not even remotely. - Good.
any idea what your sister found?
she found something? - I'm asking you.
she left a message saying she was vetting a big lead that's gonna make me happy.
no idea.
got the call. I'm getting published.
Congratulations. The shrine worked.
totally.
freebo just called his mother's cell phone.
I'll have his address by tonight.
and then you will let me deal with him.
Ramon, you've done your job. I'm gonna take it from here, okay?
go be with your family. - Don't fucking sideline me on this, Miguel.
Hey, Maria.
your assistant told me you were here.
what do you have on freebo, maria? - Ramon...
well, we're working on some new angles.
which means you've got shit. - Excuse us.
go home.
cause you're not helping here.
Ramon and his temper. - Yeah, I remember.
but... I get it. I mean, him and Oscar were close.
Miguel, I need to talk to you about something else.
I remember that look.
okay.
he didn't do that carjacking homicide.
we found new evidence, and it checks out, Miguel.
I think you convicted the wrong man.
you're serious?
I was gonna wait, I mean...
the timing is... shit.
but if Hines is innocent, Miguel...
Miguel, I'm sorry.
Oh, this is frustrating and disappointing. And, uh...
I really hate my job right now.
but, hey...
don't ever think about holding back on me. Okay?
just like now, you tell me straight.
that's the maria that I've always counted on.
always can.
when all of this is behind us, I want to get together.
the three of us. You know, as friends. It's long overdue.
night time.
why you think freebo's still in town?
because I think he killed his girlfriend on sunday. Jane doe.
how do you know it's his girlfriend?
the C. I.Gave me a lead. I did some follow-up.
my C. I?
do you have a name for jane yet?
no, but she was strangled, with is consistent with Freebo's M. O.
if you're right, the oscar prado and jane doe cases are linked.
I guess we'll just have to merge them.
Freebo's still out there killing. We've got to catch him fast.
but we got a lead now.
we find the girlfriend's I. D.We find her place, her friends, her family, then we find him.
I'll coordinate with the feds.
Ramos, reach out to street patrol.
Anton is my contact.
if you wear him out or blow his cover
I know how to work a C. I.Quinn.
so unless there's some other reason you don't want me to talk to him...
solid police work, Morgan.
that's how you earn your shield.
Thanks, sarge. - All right.
all right, people. We're gonna be working late on this.
I'll be working late too.
ho pad indeed.
all right, Teegan, tell me where your homicidal beau might be.
hiding out at his dead girlfriend's house? Risky.
then again, it took me a while to find this place, and I knew who I was looking for.
no tools, no syringe, no kill room, no sure thing.
hang tight, Freebo. I'll be back before you know it.
detached garage. Perfect place for a kill room.
M-6 bayonet, vietnam-era. A family keepsake, maybe?
Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.
it's only fitting I use it to complete the task.
shit.
it's time for a decision, Dexter.
having this child is a huge mistake.
I've weighed out all the pros and cons, and all I've got are cons.
I've been thinking the same thing.
I'm keeping it.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
but being a mother was never one of them.
Dexter, I'd rather do this with you.
but I've been a single parent for a long time now, and I think astor and cody prove that I'm pretty damn good at it.
is this you being subtle again?
no, this is me in all sincerity saying I will honor your choice.
this child is happening.
but your role in its life is entirely up to you.
should I take the out rita gave me?
what kind of father would I be? After all, I kill people.
long time, no see.
Oh, god. What the hell is this?
show and tell.
it's been so long since you killed them, I was afraid you'D... forgotten.
Oh, I'm sure teegan is fresh in your mind.
see, now, I didn't-- Fuck!
you killed those girls in the everglades, and you got away with it on a bad warrant.
I love those.
and then teegan came along.
first, you drained her of her self-respect and hope.
then last sunday, you choked the life out of her.
no, last sunday...
I was gettin' high with-- it was Cheri or... Carrie.
she's at--she's at-- she's at Alpha fee.
you seem uncertain.
it's uncomfortable, isn't it?
just when you think you've answered all the questions, another one smacks you in the face.
life, life, life.
life is just like that.
which is why I prefer death.
Dexter? Is that you?
I had the phone records.
well, what are...
is he in there?
alive?
it was self-defense.
I found a forensics lead.
it was a long shot. I wanted to check it out before...
I wasted anyone's time.
I didn't expect freebo to be here.
he surprised me. He jumped me with this knife.
that looks like my father's knife from-- from Vietn.
he gave that to Oscar.
I didn't know what to do. I fought back.
the knife ended up in his neck.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I wasn't sure that I could do this.
but you did. You did.
we're gonna get rid of the evidence.
no. No!
you should leave--now. -No!
plausible deniability.
thank you.
you're welcome.
we need to go after the root cause, this bloodsucking, soulless defense attorney Ellen Wolf.
has she ever actually killed anyone?
keep an open mind about her.
Miguel's on his way over here right now.
I know one side of him.
maybe there's more.
missing evidence, witness intimidation, jury tampering.
you got proof?
he's a bad guy. He's not a stupid guy.
I'm pregnant.
they say this part should pass soon.
this isn't some kind of weird end run, is it?
make me see how sensitive you really are?
I'm not all that sensitive. - Yeah, you are.
someone loaned Freebo some money and is willing to skin people to get it back.
which is why I want to use our C. I. More aggressively.
wait. You mean Anton?
Yeah, we're gonna spread the word that anton knows where freebo is.
you're gonna use him as bait?
which means that the skinner will be looking for me.
am I being set up?
I found the fucking lead on the skinner case.
the skinner is using tree-trimming as a cover for surveillance.
he watches from the trees, and when the time is right, he grabs them.
I know what you did for me.
I will be your bait.
so you told quinn I was investigating him.
Hey, you're the one who fucked him. Not my fault he didn't want an encore.
cop's dead 'cause Quinn cut all the wrong corners.
next dead cop's on you.
what did it feel like to end his life?
felt like justice.
we're like-minded.
together we can make a difference.
the butterfly effect.
you drop a pebble into a pond, and the ripples radiate outwards, touching and affecting everything.
until finally a fish grows arms and legs and crawls out of the water.
and picks up a rock and smashes the next two fish over the head.
and we have the first serial killer.
this is good pizza.
what channel's ESPN over here?
I think it's a big number.
Yeah, there you go.
and now we got Gary going the other way. Tryin' to get in.
no way. That's not a foul, man.
that was definitely wrong what that guy did.
you're clearly not a sports fan, are you?
not really.
I'm more of a national geographic kind of guy.
sharks, bears, the occasionally penguin.
you do have other interests, though.
Yeah, I suppose I do.
speaking of which...
uh, boundaries.
eh, it's encrypted.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Trust issues.
football.
see. You do know your sports.
this guy right here.
should I know him?
not yet, but hopefully, you will.
this was from maybe five years ago.
he never went pro. Drug problem. Turned to gambling.
unfortunately, he wasn't very good at it.
more than once he's paid his debts off to his bookies by working as an enforcer.
breaking fingers?
crushing skulls with a baseball bat.
I went after him a few years ago, but...
I just couldn't get the evidence.
I had to tell the children of a 70-year-old man that he had just killed that there was nothing we could do.
so here it comes.
Miguel wants me to kill him.
I don't want you to kill him. - No?
I wanna do it.
you.
I've let you do all of the heavy lifting so far.
now it's my turn.
I'm ready to get my hands dirty.
it's one thing to let Miguel provide a little backup, another thing to share the reins with him.
I'm gonna need your help, Dexter.
not a good idea.
just, uh, think about it.
no, Dexter, don't think about it.
the waffle is a lot like the pancake, only square.
why is it square?
because it was invented by simon P. Waffle, and he liked to stack his waffles in boxes, and that's just easier to do if they're square.
you're making that up.
I'm hurt that you would even think that.
Oh, god, Dexter, you're making a mess.
that's okay. We'll clean it up.
it's not the point.
what is the point? - I don't know.
the point is not to make a mess to begin with.
Rita's pregnancy hormones seem to be ganging up on us this morning.
how come there are no English muffins left?
uh, I think you ate the last one yesterday. Waffle?
uh, that's disgusting.
Cody, you need a haircut.
let's see... four, five, six more months till she delivers.
Rita, are you okay?
no, I'm not okay.
right, I am starting a new job and I'm planning a wedding all by myself.
what can I do to help?
it's not like you can pick out the deejay.
last time I got into your car, your radio was tuned to marching music.
it helps me think.
and it's not like you can pick the florist or the caterer or even the wedding bands.
I could pick the wedding bands.
right. Just like the engagement ring you never gave me.
you said you didn't want one.
I don't want one.
who drank all the orange juice?
Jesus christ. - What?
you have like no hot water in your shower. - All right.
Yeah, I told you to wait, remember? - Well, I can't wait.
some of us have jobs to get to.
I'm a musician. I work nights.
Yeah, and what do you do with the rest of your day?
you take a nap, you watch cartoons. Jack off.
Oh, I rarely watch cartoons.
fucking hilarious.
well, you better not be writing any more songs about me.
most ladies would be flattered.
well, most ladies aren't cops.
Oh, right. Right.
I gotta go.
you okay?
come get these. - Yeah.
Freebo's dead.
and now there's a tree trimmers' convention in here.
it seems random, but it's not.
the butterfly effect again.
of course, it's an odd sensation when you happen to be the butterfly.
and if I were to help miguel kill Billy Fleeter, who knows the effect that would have on the world?
Susoect found in school teacher murder case.
is this the beginning of a whole new level of friendship?
is it the end of life as I know it?
Mr. King, we met at the scene of our second victim, is that correct?
Yes, that is correct. - Great.
have you ever worked at any of these addresses?
no, no, see, these are city jobs. I'm a private contractor.
okay, well, I'm gonna need a list of all of your employees.
I can get you a copy of my payroll records.
that would be a big help.
how soon do you need this?
ten minutes ago would be great.
very well. - Thank you.
looks like someone got lucky last night.
uh, let's just say that Barbara and I have taken it to the next level.
you know that now you've done the deed, she's gonna be taking notes, making a checklist of your every move, to see if you're relationship material, right?
that's not true. Wait, is it?
well, it's not like we write anything down. It'S...
more of a mental process.
morning, loo.
third day in a row of this, huh?
let's hope something shakes loose on this. Come here.
uh, I have a favor to ask you. - Shoot.
you know I got to go to that peace officers association thing tomorrow night.
you wanna--you wanna be my date?
Maria, um, thank you for the invite. But I have plans.
and if I bail, I don't think it's gonna go over too well.
like that.
okay. Good for you. - Okay.
relationships are complicated.
letting Miguel kill Fleeter would be a gamble.
this guy's a gambler.
look where it got him.
something to consider when Miguel and I do our research tonight at the casino.
how'd you find out about this place?
research.
always a first good step, right?
move a little closer?
tonight is just about watching, learning his routine
where does he go, when does he go, what does he do when he gets there.
okay.
later, we'll meet him.
we?
Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
right now, we don't want him to notice us.
we don't want anyone to notice us.
cameras all over the place.
number one rule of the code is "don't get caught.
code? What code?
how much do I tell him?
it's just a series of precautions.
learned where?
common sense mostly.
a little more than that.
well, my dad was a cop.
right, right. So he taught you...
what cops look for in an investigation.
Oh, and so you work it backwards from there, right?
plus I spend all day looking at other people's mistakes.
you pick things up. - I'm sure.
am I forgetting something, Dexter?
was there one final lesson where I said, "go now, far and wide, and preach the code, my son"?
I don't think so.
so when you popped Anton for drug possession, was it just pot, or was it coke or...
what was it?
uh, pot, I think. - Right.
right, it couldn't have been anything too serious, or you wouldn't have made him a C. I.
I guess.
you're just full of answers today.
I-I-I just busted guys like him every day.
I don't remember, and it's all written down somewhere.
right. C. I.Files.
Hello?
Hey, lazy, hope I'm waking you up.
Hey, lazy? I haven't been to bed yet.
look, I need your C. I. Number. I'm gonna file a status report.
what's a C. I.Number?
your assigned confidential informant number.
it should be on your paychecks.
what checks?
hello. Your paychecks from the county.
hello. I don't get any paychecks.
Quinn always pays me in cash.
okay. I'll get it from him then.
my client was supposed to be sent to county yesterday.
apparently he was, but then they put him on the next bus right back here in the afternoon.
I've been chasing him all over the place.
we shouldn't have those mix-ups.
is it a mix-up, or is miguel fucking with me?
ever since I started looking into him, he's been going out of his way to make my job harder.
well, you knew that was gonna happen.
doesn't mean I can't bitch about it.
Oh, anyway, I should go see my client and ask what perfectly logical reason he had for lighting his ex-wife's house on fire.
Oh, I wanted to ask you.
any chance you'd go to a police charity function with me tomorrow night?
room full of cops? I can't imagine anything more fun.
shouldn't have asked.
I'm kidding. I'd love to go.
okay, next on your list, Mr. King, Santiago Ramirez.
he no longer works for me. That didn't end so well.
Why?
he was run over.
uh, Mario Astorga. Didn't I talk to him?
Yes, if you remember, he's the one who found the body of that man.
right. Second victim.
Mario's one of my best foremen.
so he's a good guy?
what, he's not a good guy?
he has a temper. He gets very angry.
keep going.
I knew his family back in nicaragua.
we're both from san marcos.
but mario had to leave. - Why?
the police were looking for him.
I heard he killed someone with a knife.
do you know where I can find mario?
I don't know where he lives.
but tomorrow, he'll be at bayside park.
you sure?
I make the schedule.
Fleeter pays off his gambling debts by eliminating people for his bookie.
a school teacher here, a mother of two there.
people who can't settle their debts.
sending a message to others-- "pay up.
do I help miguel move forward on this, or do I listen to harry and shut it down?
Hey, you.
Yeah, I just heard a love song on the radio that reminded me of you.
Oh, that's sweet. - And it made me really angry.
so have you gotten the wedding bands yet?
um, I'm still doing my research, but I'm on it.
I gotta go.
Hey, you know anything about wedding rings?
Yeah.
wedding rings and nuclear fission are like my secret specialties.
Thanks.
your brother's kind of a dweeb, huh?
you say anything more about my brother, and I will kick your fucking nuts down your throat.
that doesn't even make any sense.
so, hey, Anton doesn't have any priors, you pay him in cash, and I can't find him in the C. I.database.
should be in there.
what are you hiding?
Anton is not officially a C. I.
what do you mean? - Come here for a second.
look, it was just easier for both of us.
I never filed an arrest report on him so he has no police record.
I did him a favor.
Plus, it saved me the hassle of all that paperwork.
you have got to be fucking kidding me.
we used him as bait.
he was putting his life at risk, and he was under no legal obligation to help us.
no, no, no, there was just no paperwork, that's all.
not to mention the fact that because he's not officially a C. I.
there's no end date to when he's done working for us, so you can just string him along as long as you want to.
what are you getting so upset about? What, are you in love with the guy?
no, I'm not in love with him.
but you're sleeping with him.
Jesus christ, do you know what kind of a bonehead mistake that is?
sleeping with an informant?
I mean, it's that kind of judgment'll screw up your career.
he's not an informant. You just said it.
but you didn't know. Either way, it makes you look stupid.
no, you don't get to lecture me, asshole.
Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit against the police department once he finds out how you fucked him over.
Yeah, if someone told him.
of course I'm gonna tell him.
you'll sell out a cop for some dope you're fucking?
that's not half as bad as being responsible for another cop dying because you don't like to play by the rules.
what?
Yuki told me.
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
despite Harry's warnings, here I am with Miguel, outside Billy Fleeter's house.
if I'm gonna stop this, it's gonna have to be soon.
are you sure you want to do this? It's breaking and entering. But you know that.
Yes, I do. Let's go.
here, put these on.
forensics guy who always has latex gloves on him.
no one would ever think twice, huh?
I guess you're right.
I don't want Miguel to see how easy this is for me.
uh, you want me to try?
no, I think I-- I got it.
so what are we looking for?
proof. That he's guilty.
we know he bludgeons people to death, so look for something...
Bludgeony.
uh, this looks like it's been knocked around some.
hold it up.
purple? Ergo...
blood.
how easy is this?
I'll test it against the blood of his alleged victims.
let you know later today.
you know it takes me two days to get a search warrant, then another day to catalog evidence, and then, a week before I can get the lab results.
this is definitely the way to go.
we also need to make sure that he's likely to kill again.
why is that?
it's just one of the rules.
one of these days I'm gonna make you sit down and write out all these rules for me, but okay.
he--he kills whenever he needs money.
that's how he pays off his debts to the bookie.
Dex, I've tried a lot of these gamblers before, and they all keep records.
they're like anal about their numbers.
there's got to be like a ledger around here somewhere.
maybe there's a hidden wall safe or something.
we're talking about the man who leaves his murder weapon in an umbrella stand.
Yeah, you're right. What if we don't find anything?
then we don't move forward.
leave it, Dex.
just put it back.
you can stop this right now.
call it off.
why should I call it off?
I didn't teach you the code to share with your buddies.
I taught you the code to keep you alive.
you don't get to have friends, dexter.
nothing good can come out of this.
Hey, Dex, you know what, I don't think we're gonna find anything here, man.
look at you.
it's my life, dad.
30 grand in the hole.
I think we know how he's gonna pay that off.
so, look, we moving forward?
Yeah, moving forward.
if the blood matches.
I can't believe we are just now sending out invitations. This is so last minute.
it's okay. There's plenty of time.
and Dexter's no help.
do you know, I asked him for menu suggestions-- do you know what he says?
I don't know. - Steak.
he says steak.
Yeah, that's great, Dexter. That's really great.
we'll start with a steak appetizer, followed by steak salad, followed, of course, by a steak, and then, of course, it'll all be topped off by a steak fucking cake.
Rita. Rita. - What?
the envelope. You're making a mess.
shit.
why don't you stuff for a while? And I'll do the addresses.
okay.
I've got big news.
Yeah, about the skinner?
no, about you.
you're free.
Oh, yeah, ever since abe Lincoln.
I mean from the police department.
you're no longer a C. I.
hold on, wait a second.
the way Quinn explained it was, if I play ball, it would knock down my felony possession to a misdemeanor, and if I worked hard enough, it would go away all together.
well, it's gone away.
hmm, how's that?
clerical error.
the necessary papers were never filed, so there were never any charges for you to work off.
wait, so I've been doing all this shit when I didn't have to?
just be glad you don't have to do it anymore.
well, thank you.
and I want to put protective detail on you.
what? No. No, Debra.
Anton. - Listen.
you said I'm free, so I'm free of this.
so we should celebrate.
dinner tonight.
mm, no, I'm working tonight.
how about we celebrate now?
I've got to go back to work.
tomorrow. Breakfast.
perfect.
so I'm guessing we got a blood match, huh?
that's why we're here.
life vests?
we can't exactly load up the cart with axes and machetes, now can we?
exactly right.
so, um, have you given any thought as to how you want to do this?
small caliber gun to the head.
then I walk away.
that happens all the time.
guns make noise. And they leave evidence behind--bullets, casings, powder residue.
not to mention the body. - Okay.
you don't want to create a crime scene.
it's where experts like me gather evidence against you.
okay, okay, I get it, I get it.
what do you suggest?
up close and personal.
Hey, in case we have to tie anybody up.
I'm gonna put together a starter kit for you.
Hey, you got better.
Yeah, what do you know?
what better place to gamble on miguel than a room full of games of chance?
where slot machines go to die, huh?
and at least one gambler.
I think that's it.
now we pick up mr. Fleeter.
you ever drop a quart of milk?
watch it spread over the whole kitchen floor, the mess it makes?
Yeah.
there's six quarts of blood in the human body.
this isn't gonna be pretty.
there's no shame in backing out.
Dex, after 14 years of filing briefs, trying cases, and dealing with bullshit...
this is all gonna look nice and neat in comparison.
I have been to some lame-ass rubber chicken dinners - in my day, okay. - I know, I know.
a no-host bar is punishment enough, but no bar at all is cruel.
and unusual.
all right, I'm buying the first round. - Thank you.
that's pretty.
gift from my first husband.
nice, nice.
you're handsome.
dire ethanol emergency here.
what'll it be, ladies?
uh, cuba libre for this one. - Gracias.
and a double scotch neat soda back pour moi.
very nice.
easy.
Oh, and who was that guy, that--that suit and haircut sitting next to you that wouldn't shut up?
who knows? I don't know
what's sad is that this is the only social event I've been to in six months.
Oh, that doesn't qualify as a social event.
okay.
can I get you anything else?
Yeah, how about a foot massage with those big, gorgeous hands of yours?
they're kind of cold from scooping ice.
hmm, but you're hot.
Cheers.
nothing shy about you, huh? - No. Well...
after a pair of empty marriages, I realized the secret to long life and happiness is, well, chocolate and flirting with young, hopefully hung men.
sounds fattening and dangerous.
Oh, but so fun.
which, clearly, you're not having enough of.
I am.
look, believe me, I've had my fun.
you need to be raising hell and breaking hearts.
I need to be?
you need to be.
the skirt-wearing days do not last forever.
we all end up old and in the way.
I tell Miguel to be inconspicuous, and what does he do?
he shows up looking like the unabomber.
I've got my work cut out for me.
Oh, close game, close game.
Yeah, good D.
good game, huh?
no, it's not a good game.
good game is when they don't beat the fucking point spread.
Oh, you got a little money riding on this?
a little bit.
shit.
sorry. - Yeah.
not half as sorry as somebody else is gonna be.
here we go.
patron.
Hey, who was that guy?
uh, I don't know. Some guy.
how do you know him?
I don'T. Dex, sometimes people recognize me.
it's off. We're not doing this.
we need to take down the kill room.
no, no, Dex, let's just wait.
no one ever goes in that room there. You saw.
Tranquilo, huh? We decide tomorrow, okay?
we'll see.
Anton. Me again. Waiting on you still.
the way I figured it, you gigged until closing, and then you went home and smoked some of that herb that you keep in your cereal box.
and now, like all self-indulgent, vaguely adolescent musicians, you are sleeping in till noon
and I'm okay with that. Okay? I'm okay with that.
as long as you're alone.
okay, okay. Too much caffeine.
coral Gables man found blugeoned.
a dutch farmer sees his crop fail.
no money to his name, he takes a job working on a boat.
an unseasonably strong wind blows him to indonesia.
he drops a bean into the soil.
and voila, 400 years later...
java.
everything is connected.
Hello?
Dex, wanna hook up for breakfast? I'm buying.
I would, Deb, but I'm already freshly bageled.
what are you doing up so early?
trying to be a good fiance.
Rita made me vice president in charge of wedding rings, so I'm off to the jewelry store.
and what do you know about buying women jewelry?
zero.
less than. Jesus, Dex.
look, I'll meet you at that place on Second Street at 10: 00, okay?
the wedding band has to match the engagement ring, so what does that look like?
she said she didn't want one.
my god, you just get dumber every day.
how do you survive in this world?
of course she wants one.
how am I supposed to know that?
you're such a y-chromosome cliche.
just buy her a beautiful, romantic, I love you with all of my heart fucking engagement ring.
and Dex, size matters.
can I ask you something non-jewelry-wise?
go for it.
okay, hypothetically...
let's say that this guy has to work with this girl, but he fucking hates doing it, and too bad 'cause he has no fucking choice.
And?
and one thing leads to another...
and this hypothetical guy starts having sex with this hypothetical girl.
hypothetical sex?
real sex.
really real sex.
but then the guy is told that he no longer has to work with this girl, and poof, he just disappears. You know. Thin air. Adios.
so I'm wondering, is it possible if mr. Hypothetical never really was all that into this girl?
and he was just getting it on to, I don't know, pass the time or satisfy primal urges or whatever?
sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
what the fuck do you know?
that one. I gotta go sit in a hot car and wait for a suspect.
Hey, Anton...
what the fuck? Call me.
I can bring Mario in myself.
let you get all the credit for catching the skinner?
no fucking way.
we don't know he's the skinner.
closest thing we got.
that was really fucking unfair what you said yesterday.
well, is it true?
that a cop died because of you?
it's not that simple. - Try me.
Yuki Amado was my partner in narcotics.
there was another detective on our team, Stewart.
he made a bad judgment call and shot an unarmed coke dealer.
I remember that.
paralyzed him, right?
then Stewart went on a bender until he finally swallowed his own bullet.
how does Yuki make that your fault?
because Stewart had a problem with crystal meth.
and I knew it.
and rather than bust him, I tried to protect him.
so it is your fault.
listen to you. Everything is so black and white.
you could have stopped him.
Yeah, sure, if I knew what I knew now.
but that's not the way things work.
I'm sorry. You're just making excuses.
Yeah, of course I'm making excuses. Don't you?
I mean, how else do you sleep at night?
who the fuck said I sleep at night?
then you must be killing yourself over hooking up with anton.
Yeah, it was probably a mistake.
I think he lost all interest once he realized he was free.
not so black and white, is it?
I'm guessing he didn't want to come in for questioning.
he made a run for it.
interview two.
what's his story?
so far, he hasn't said a word.
Ah, you keep at it.
and you check with Nicaraguan authorities on priors.
we're just waiting to hear back.
I'm never gonna get out of here.
I gotta call Barbara and cancel our dinner.
Oh, she's not gonna like that.
I mean, it--it's work.
I'm not here. Leave a message.
Hello, barbara.
this is sergeant Angel Batista.
angel to you. How are you?
good I hope.
so I have to cancel our dinner tonight.
and I am deeply, deeply apologetic.
and I hope that you will let me make it up to you in whatever possible way you wish things made up to you in.
Oh, I can tell by that look on your face, you're trying to figure out how to tell me something I don't wanna hear.
calling off the kill. It's over.
really, Dex?
just because some guy recognized me in a bar?
no one is ever gonna make that connection once Fleeter disappears.
I'm not taking that chance.
cause that's not the way you do things. Right.
no, it isn'T.
tell me about that.
what are you asking?
I wasn't gonna bring it up before, but I'm guessing...
you've been doing this for a while.
freebo wasn't your first. Was he?
how many, dex?
okay, you know what, it doesn't matter.
I will respect your privacy.
but I just don't understand why are you not gonna help me here?
just because we--we broke this little rule from your code?
come on, Dex. It's okay.
no, it's not okay.
you never should have asked me to help you. You're not ready.
I'm not-- or is it you that's not ready?
because we could have dealt with this Fleeter problem like three times already, and you keep throwing up all of these roadblocks with all this code bullshit.
it's not bullshit. - Oh, come on. Keep telling yourself that, Dex.
come on, it's like wearing a fucking straitjacket, man.
no, Miguel, it's just the opposite.
if I didn't have the code, the darkness.
I could stand here and tell you another story about my abusive father, but what I haven't told you about is the time that I kicked the shit out of him and knocked him down a flight of stairs.
and I really enjoyed it.
that was the first time in my life that I've ever felt...
powerful like...
like I was in control of--of something.
and ever since then, I've been trying to--to get that feeling back again.
so when you talk to me about...
the darkness inside of you...
I understand.
I really do.
I just want to let some of mine out too.
I know you understand that.
you know what, mr. Astorga? Maybe I should have opened with my closer.
Meaning?
we know about the incident in Managua, the one where you stabbed a cab driver.
he touched my sister.
sadly, he survived.
that's a heartbreaking story.
still you are an illegal guest of our country.
immigration's on the way.
you're gonna be on a plane before the sun comes up.
but I have a son.
he was born here. He's a U. S.Citizen. He's my life.
your boy's a U. S.Citizen? - Yes.
then he stays. Maybe your wife too. We don't know yet.
but we do know is if you keep stonewalling us on this skinner case, you are gone on a one-way ticket.
no matter what you try to do to me, the facts ain't changing.
cause I don't know anything about anything.
then why would george king suggest otherwise?
senor King said I knew something?
in a word? Yup.
and senor King will be very disappointed to hear you're calling him a liar.
No! Please.
what are you so afraid of, Mario?
Yeah, what'd this guy do to you?
what can he do to you?
please.
send me back to Nicaragua. - Alone?
Si. Yes. Alone.
we mentioned George King's name once and he turns to jell-O.
scared to death of him.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, King jobbed us. I'm gonna issue a bolo for him.
Hello? Shit.
who was it?
uh, me. I was checking to see if my phone was working.
Barbara never called me back.
I think I ruined it.
sorry. Dating sucks.
Yeah.
well, I'm out here. Still no george king, but we put the word out.
you got my message.
Yup. Been listening to it all day.
makes me laugh every time.
it's pretty bad, huh?
um, the worst.
I'm glad I amuse you.
not half as glad as I am.
Hey, did they finish already?
they never even started.
what do you mean? Where's Anton?
he never showed. - Why?
I don't know. They waited an hour. They called. Doesn't answer.
Thanks.
what the fuck...
are you ready?
I am.
thank you.
thank you for this.
for letting me in.
for showing me the way.
look at him.
look at him trying to figure it all out.
what the fuck?
we're here because of them.
those lives that you destroyed.
who are you?
we're justice.
Hey, man, I was just doing what I had to do.
as are we.
I've always done the deed alone. Never stood outside.
been a witness to this moment.
the moment of truth.
can Miguel go through with it?
can he step out of the cocoon and fly?
how do you feel?
fantastic.
shouldn't we get him out of here?
as bonded as we may feel, there are still things I can't share with miguel.
I got it.
no, it's--it's too much work.
leaving no trace is my area of expertise.
Yeah, but, Dex...
get home before Sylvia starts to wonder where you are. I mean it.
okay. I'm going.
not a good idea.
that would be against your code, huh?
sorry.
Anton, you in there?
Hello, Anton?
Oh, god.
shit. Trimmed trees. The skinner's been here.
you were wrong.
it went well.
maybe. Who knows?
you can't admit it. He did good.
that was never the issue, Dex.
I was only thinking about you.
of course.
you've set something in motion here.
everything Miguel does from now on is connected to you.
it's a lot of responsibility teaching him what you just did.
a heavy burden.
it was too much for me to bear.
I hope you're a stronger man.
you're still up.
I can't sleep.
I hope it's okay. - My god.
it's--it's perfect.
Dexter, god, you've been such a saint through all this.
I don't know how you've put up with me.
if you need me to help out with more of the wedding stuff... - no.
no, it'S... it's the hormones.
I go crazy when I'm pregnant.
tell me about it.
that's not true.
you should just get out while you can.
just run for your life. - I won'T.
I promise.
it's like I have this monster living inside of me, and I don't know how to control it.
maybe I can help you out with that one.
it's so beautiful.
it's been said that a butterfly can flap its wings in brazil...
and set off a storm in Florida.
I'm taking the chance that's not entirely true.
I found a fucking leadon the skinner case.
the skinner is using tree-trimming as a cover for surveillance.
he watches from the trees, and when the time is right, he grabs them.
Mr. King.
we met at the scene of our second victim, is that correct?
Yes, that is correct.
mario Astorga?
I don't know anything about anything.
then why would George King suggest otherwise?
what are you so afraid of, Mario?
this is the shirt I was wearing when Freebo met his end.
that's his bloodright there.
this shirt implicates me in his death.
I trust you, and I want you to trust me.
but he's being secretive. He's never home.
he says he's with dexter. But I think it's a cover.
Freebo's final resting place.
hiding a body in a cemetery. you're fucking brilliant.
we need to go after the root cause- blood sucking,
soulless defense attorney Ellen Wolf!
we can't kill her.
I see.
this is personal. - Fuck yes, this is personal.
I'm asking you to do this for me as my friend.
I'm sorry. no. - Well, then, fuck you.
someone loaned Freebo some money and
is willing to skin people to get it back.
we're gonna spread the word that Anton knows where Freebo is.
which means that the skinner will be looking for me.
what are you hiding?
Anton is not officially a C.I.
we used him as bait.
I mean, what, are you in love with the guy?
Anton, you in there? Shit. Trimmed trees.
the skinner's been here.
I'm ready to get my hands dirty.
I've always done the deed alone.
never stood outside.
been a witness to this moment.
you've set something in motion here.
everything Miguel does from now on is connected to you.
today I wake up, kiss the wife-to-be...
feed the stepkids-to-be dress myself in the usual pants, shirt...
and pretense.
but last night, it was no pretense.
Miguel and I took a life. Together.
and today, someone knows my truth.
shares my reality.
I'm not alone.
Sylvia, good morning.
sorry for coming over so early.
it's okay.
but I need to see your face when I ask you.
ask me?
syl, what is it?
Miguel was out till all hours last night.
he says he was with you. is that true?
Absolutely. we were just hanging. Being guys. You know.
Miguel was telling the truth.
you see, there's nothing to worry about.
Dexter didn't get here till late.
it was - it had to be almost midnight.
Miguel got home an hour ago.
he's having an affair.
when you've been married as long as we have,
you know when your husband's lying.
something to look forward to.
maybe Dexter knows where he went.
I really don't.
but he did talk about a case he needed to look over.
at the office.
this really isn't your problem. I should go.
no. no, no, no.
you stay here for as long as you need to, okay?
I'll just leave.
work.
with a detour on the way.
Dex. Dex, man.
how you doing? you okay?
I'm good. - Me too.
it's like there was an imbalance in the world, and we righted it with our own hands.
it was deserving.
I don't know. I feel real.
like maybe for the first time in my life.
I know what you mean.
but. if we're thinking about continuing these extracurricular activities...
Absolutely. - You need to work on your alibis.
syl stopped by this morning, wondering where you'd been.
Ah, shit. I'm a moron.
I tried to cover for you, but I thought you went home.
I'm sorry, man.
I went over to jack's hide away over on 57th.
I was, like, so wired.
the next thing I know, the sun was coming up.
Jack's hide away.
don't worry about Syl. I can handle that.
I got a motion hearing this morning, though,
I don't wanna miss.
I'll get better at this with your help.
I stalked a wife-killer at Jack's hideaway last year,
grabbed him right at closing.
at 2: 00 a. m.
Sylvia said Miguel got homean hour ago.
did he just lie? To me?
another detour.
there's nothing here either.
well, what about the blinds? What about the glass?
checked them. Deb, there's no blood.
Anton didn't just follow the skinner out of here.
I'll keep looking.
I think we need to recanvass.
we've already talked to everyone in the building.
what about the kids? they're awake now.
we'll talk to the kids.
what do we got?
the skinner has Anton. Did you see the trees?
I saw them. It doesn't mean he got nabbed.
the coffee pot was left burning.
he definitely left in a hurry.
what the hell was Anton doing back in town?
he never left.
he contacted me, but he wouldn't agree to surveillance.
who cares if he agrees? He's a C.I.
that's why we used him as bait in the first place.
guys. No liner.
the building trash dumpster.
subscription renewal form from rolling stone addressed to Anton Briggs.
this is his garbage.
so the bag split on impact with the dumpster here.
he threw it. Defensive move.
why the hell didn't he use his fists?
he was hurt. There's blood and some hair.
looks like he hit his head against the wall.
how bad?
hard enough to daze him.
a blow from behind could have propelled him forward.
so Anton comes down to empty the garbage, the skinner clocks him,
he does a header into the wall, throws the bag as a last ditch.
skinner tosses him in the car and peels out.
got tire marks here.
fuck.
all right, we got a confirmed missing person.
Anton Briggs.
find a photo.
get his face out to all patrols and the media.
set up a tip line.
pull in some off-duties to man the phone bank.
skinner's had him for 24 hours.
how long do you think he can hold out?
report on the other victims suggests the skinner starts slow.
probably to build fear. Anton's a big guy. A lotta skin.
that's meant to be comforting.
george King, we need to bring him in.
we gotta find him first.
we got bolos out on him all night long.
haven't found him yet.
we could search his house, though.
we still holding King's foreman on resisting arrest, right?
he give us anything that'll buy us a warrant?
mario Astorga clammed up. too scared of King.
he would rather be deported away from his family than to talk about King.
is that all we got? - Yeah.
I'll try and find a flexible judge.
let me know when it comes in.
I'm gonna go sit on King's house.
we'll go sit on King's house.
Hey, I want this aboveboard.
use restraint. Wait on the warrant.
and I hope they find something because even if we nab King,
we got nothing to hold him on past today.
a day can save a lot of skin.
I keep telling you. You have to listen.
if I knew where Freebo was, I'd tell you.
don't you fucking understand, man? It was the cops.
I was - I was fucking bait.
all right, all right, you're right.
I know where he is. I can show you. I can show you.
all right, listen to me.
he owes you money, right?
he owes you money? I can get you money.
I can find you money.
I don't want your money.
I loaned Freebo that money.
this is about respect.
with your first cut, you had all night to consider my questions.
this cut, you have only one hour.
and when I return, there'll be no rest.
use the time to think about the skin you have left to lose.
Hi, how are you?
are you screening your calls? Ellen?
I'm surprised you missed the motion hearing this morning.
so was chicky hines.
of course, Miguel was perfectly happy to get a continuance.
uh, listen, if you're sick,
either way, let me know you're all right. Okay? Bye.
Miguel went missing last night.
Ellen's missing this morning.
could be a coincidence.
patrol's been set up here all night.
king's not inside.
well, something in there's gonna tell us where he is.
warrant should be here soon.
mother fuck - Anton? Anton, you in there?
Anton, are you in there?
Hey, I don't hear anything.
Yeah, well, I do.
I hear somebody calling for help.
that's probable cause, right?
we're doing this aboveboard.
the warrant's on its way.
right. Restraint.
what the fuck are you doing? - Anton?
shit.
Hey, you're not the only one working this case, Morgan.
prado here.
Hey, just checking in.
how'd the motion hearing go?
continued.
that's too bad.
Oh, no, serendipitous actually. It worked in my favor.
listen, you don't have to keep on checking on me.
Yeah, no, I'm just a concerned friend.
well, don't be.
in fact, why don't you meet meat cojimar for lunch?
because I been coming up with some more, uh, projects.
another kill so soon?
I can't. I gotta keep an eye on the situation here.
I heard. The skinner grabbed up another victim, huh?
let me know if I can help.
Miami metro hot line.
what location?
who am I speaking with? Can you spell that, please?
Anton Briggs' photo hit the media an hour ago.
I'm gonna bring King's employee up from holding, take another run at him.
mario Astorga, already in interview two.
thought I'd take a stab. - I can handle it.
I know. but I wanna help.
tired of standing behind my glass wall.
well, we can use the help today.
no, I knew,
I knew half those hookers were pre-op trannies,
but is it true
is it true their junk still works, but nothing comes out?
it's called slug-fucking.
hello.
babe. hey, Vice got word you needed extra bodies.
thought I'd help out.
that's 'cause you're the best.
Hey, hey, get a room.
actually, no, don't.
Miami metro tip-line.
Vince, you gota second?
what the fuck are you doing?
what? Helping out on my day off. You're welcome.
good place to meet chicks from other departments.
Yeah, well, that's my chick.
I don't want you talking your filth at her.
whoa, whoa, hold up. I didn't bring that up.
she did. - Bullshit.
seriously. She's like the Wikipedia of perv.
I gotta find mea girlfriend from vice.
she's awesome.
fuck. Fucking nothing. King could be anywhere.
or right here.
holy shit.
remember. We need his cooperation.
restraint, right.
what are you doing at my house?
Yeah, Mr. King, we have awarrant to search the premises.
what are you looking for?
more like who.
you wanna tell us where you've been all night?
Oh, I work, ma'am. Nights.
mornings. Trees keep growing.
it's a good business. I'm only home to have breakfast.
you wanna grab a bagel down at the station?
answers some questions for us?
I'm happy to answer right here, sir.
what, you got somewhere you need to be?
trees. - They'll wait.
am I under arrest, sir?
no, but we can hold you for questioning.
for the day.
what are you, a lawyer?
Oh, no, wait, I forgot. You're a fucking tree trimmer.
I moved to this country for its amazing liberties.
I know my rights. - Great.
george King is hanging you out to dry, Mario.
I thought you might want a chance- I've seen the fear.
an inch away from death fear.
it'd be a shame to leave your wife and your little baby behind.
his is real.
what makes you so scary, George King?
you miss your country, George?
I like this country, sir.
I like Miami, sir.
nicaragua can be a rough place, huh?
you in the military down there?
death squads, contras.
you would a been about the right age to get caught up in that.
you learn a few things there, George?
I learn respect, sir.
no interrogation techniques?
maybe a little snatch and grab. What do they call that? Renditioning?
Oh, I don't know that, ma'am.
ma'am, sir.
you did learn respect.
did you show any fucking respect to wendell when you tore his skin off?
how about anton when you bashedhim over the goddamn head?
Morgan, you want a coffee?
why don't you geta coffee?
Yeah. Sure.
he looks harmless, doesn't he?
they usually do.
I don't know. maybe he's not our guy.
well, you should trust your instincts on this one.
this one of your creepy insights?
why does it always have to be creepy?
fucking tell me.
he's heldlife and death in his hands.
he likes it.
I knew it.
so how do I crack this sick fuck's brain?
from what I've read about these sick fucks,
they usually have some sort of code.
I'd say disrespect is high on his list of violations.
maybe if you came at him with deference.
deference, huh?
Yeah, think about it. Hey, lieutenant.
I heard you say your friend ellen is ill. Was it a stomach thing?
because I just read this article - I don't know what it is.
I haven't heard back from her.
I left her three messages. I'm a little worried.
Yeah, me too.
I hope she didn't get in an accident or something.
excuse me. I have an errand to run.
a home office.
if she were sick, this is where she'd be.
her car's here.
she could have gone for a really long walk.
or borrowed a friend's car.
or maybe Laguerta's right and Ellen is comatose in some hospital,
post-accident.
one can hope.
not that there are any signs of foul play here.
but Harry did raise me to be paranoid.
blood. damn it.
no. Miguel wouldn't do this. we agreedellen wolf is innocent.
hello.
it's just blood. there's no body.
he would even knowwhat to do with one. I never taught himhow to dispose...
as far as Miguel knows,
the best place to dispose of a body is beneath an open grave.
good thinking.
hello.
uh, set-ups arein the kitchen.
Miguel?
Hi. any bites?
no, just nosy neighbors so far.
syl's office said that she would be here.
is she out back or- no, she wasn't feeling upto an open house,
so I'm sitting it for her.
well, you're a good friend.
here. you should have these.
how about I make sure syl gets them?
Miguel.
flowers are a good start, but can I be honest?
I like honest.
you're an idiot. - That's honest.
you were smart enough to ask her to marry you,
and she's still that same fantastic woman.
you don't think i know that?
well, you're not acting that way.
I am not having a goddamn affair, okay.
all right, let's say that's the truth. - It is.
either way, you violated her trust.
I just needed space.
I've got everything falling apart around me now, you know, Oscar, Ramon,
now my cases - and the same things are falling apart for her,
because she's your partner.
you're a wise person, aren't you?
well, if I am, it's only because I've learned from my many, many mistakes.
you have insight.
and I tell you what.
I'm gonna follow your lead.
so point the way.
Mr. King, I understand that respect is very importantto you.
Yes, ma'am.
and I'm sure you feel that people have to earn your respect.
Yes, ma'am.
I feel like you've earned this.
what's the matter, little gardener? huh?
you feel disrespected?
you'll get used to it in prison because your foreman mario's next door,
and he is spilling his guts.
you are so sure he's afraid of you. Why?
what did you do to him?
what did you do to Anton? what did you do?
Morgan!
fuck.
help!
help me!
you know, we're supposed to be working together.
you keep going off half-cocked. How am I supposed to trust you?
you trust me? that's unbelievable.
you're lucky Batista wasn't watching the monitors.
what the fuck were you thinking?
I was thinking about Anton. You oughta try it some time.
I want to find him just as bad as you do.
if you gave a shit about Anton, you wouldn't have made him your fake C.I.
and he wouldn't be messed upin this.
you're the one too busy boning him to provide him with protective surveillance.
you are so crossing the line right now.
am I?
you knew Anton was in town.
and I fucking told him to call it in.
you should have called it in your fucking self.
I know. It's my fault.
no, you're right.
I used him. I...
am i?
you knew Anton was in town.
and I fucking told him to call it in.
you should have called it in your fucking self.
I know. It's my fault.
no, you're right.
just fucking used him.
we can only hold George King for a few more hours.
we better get back to work.
schedule says there are four funerals today.
graves back-hoed last night.
that's four Miguel could have chosen from.
she's not here. that's one down.
that blood might not even belong to Ellen.
could be a client's blood. Or the previous owner's.
he did it. Miguel really did it.
and I taught him how. I guided him to this.
I created... this.
I'm sorry.
Miguel's making his own choices now.
look who he chose.
she didn't deserve this.
you can say it.
won't change anything, dex, whether I told you so or not.
easier to accept it.
cause there'll be plenty more where Ellen came from.
no, there won't.
Hey, Miguel, is it too late to grab that lunch?
so what do you think of this George King sicko?
skinner suspect?
I gotta go from here to your precinct to discuss
whether we're gonna file charges against this guy.
you think he's the guy? - He's the guy.
Skinner.
well, if the law can't get him, you and I can.
in fact, I could have this guy out on the streets in a few hours.
you need some help on this one, or is this another solo project?
we agreed to leave Ellen Wolf alone.
technically, we agreed not to kill her together. and we didn't.
technically? - I know. that's-that's bullshit.
I didn't tell you because I know you wouldn't approve.
cause she wasn't guilty.
apparently, we have a different definition of that word.
you got rid of her because she got in your way.
whatever happened to serving justice?
is that really why you do this, Dex? To serve justice?
we don't have to pretend with each other.
that's what I thought. - Okay.
I should have told you.
it was a chicken shit thing to do, and I abused your trust- a trust,
by the way, that wasn't easy to earn.
that's not lost on me.
I gave you my shirt linking me to Freebo's death.
I wish I had another one to prove to you how important this partnership is to me.
I'd take a little remorse.
you would know that I don't feel it.
Yeah, you'll feel it if you get caught.
I didn't leave any evidence.
they're just gonna think it was one of her scum bag clients.
right. right, just another low life who beat and stabbed an innocent woman.
again, different definitions.
Dex.
this is the nature of a real friendship.
we're gonna disagree.
and when we do, we just go our own way.
no, no more individual projects.
individuality is what makes america great.
I don't think that's what our forefathers had in mind.
look. I'm a big boy. I know what I'm doing.
eventually, you're gonna trust that too.
I'll see you over at the precinct.
he thinks he's untouchable.
he's not. It's time he learned that.
probably not a lot of leads on that screen.
king's a ghost.
he grabbed Anton without a single security
camera in the are a picking up him or his truck.
there's not one shot to implicate him.
so we'll have to get it out of King.
you gonna let Quinn do it on his own.
my time is better spent here.
away from people.
you know, someone - a good friend,
actually - told me I had a big wall around me.
I thought it made me a better cop.
I don't think it did.
they look at him and see a defender of truth, justice,
and the american way.
I see a man about to learn a hard lesson.
tire tracks in the alley are consistent with King's truck.
and several other thousand trucks in the Miami metro area.
king's company trims trees.
now trimmed trees were found in every one of the victims' homes.
that's the lead that nailed him.
I don't know about nailed.
the trees at my place just got trimmed too.
Yeah, but Mario Astorga - we're talking about a foreman, right?
a foreman who's terrified of his boss.
you can arrest my boss on that same evidence.
he's the fucking guy.
sir. - Muel. may I?
we really need your help on this one.
and you do owe us for getting Ramon off.
I do. But I can't very well charge Mr. King with assault on a palm tree.
you have your ways, Miguel.
you've bent rules before. getting people lost in the system.
we need to buy time for Anton Briggs.
for you. I'll do everything in my power.
we'll be right there.
showtime.
Dex, get your kit. you too, Masuka.
Hey, it's called off-duty. - Not anymore.
you two, you stay on King. Don't let up. We got another body.
Anton?
a female at the cemetery.
cause of death? - Take your pick.
sever beating, strangulation...
plus three stab wounds.
whoever did this was not a fan.
you have no idea.
think our killer's a pro.
I haven't seen many body dumps this clean.
I made sure of that.
Miguel getting caught isn't part of the lesson plan.
angel, don't let her see this.
no, they said it was her. but it's not, is it?
Maria, I'm sorry.
no, I don't believe - oh, my god. - Walk with me.
too many people are affected when the innocent die.
that is part of the lesson plan.
no one is untouchable. I learned that the hard way.
so will Miguel.
his own vulnerability is about to become very real to him...
after the stage show ends.
they won't find anything. - I know.
so you're just making a point.
am I?
we follow the code. or else.
there are a lot of other subtleties, but if that's what you've gleaned,
then yeah, that's my point.
you're a wise person, aren't you?
you're being facetious. - No, no, you have insight.
I'd be a fool not to follow your lead.
I think you're gonna save my life.
is this real?
I should go make a statement to the press.
I wouldn't want anyone getting ideas about Killing lawyers.
lesson learned. It seems.
Oh, good. good. You're here.
come here. Taste this.
this one.
and now this one.
which one?
I'm more in the mood for steak.
no, this isfor the wedding cake.
we have to choose one. chocolate or hazelnut?
is Sylvia still here?
no, because of me.
I intervened.
apparently, I'm a very wise person.
apparently?
according to Miguel.
he came to the open house I was sitting for Syl.
Really? - We - we talked for a while.
actually, I talked. I just - I gave him some insight.
insight.
he said he thinks I could...
save his life.
every word, bullshit.
when did he start lying? with Ellen? before her?
so, chocolate?
what about that shirt?
the shirt.
Dexter, what's wrong?
I have to look at some blood.
evidence. for a crime.
hazelnut.
Maria, why don't you head home, get some rest?
I can't. I have to...
do something. - Sure.
I'm here if you need me. okay?
tell me that we're close on the skinner.
cause this Ellen Wolf thing is about to take over.
still running down tips, but they're bullshit so far.
they're gonna keep being bullshit because no one saw King take Anton.
what about Mario Astorga?
as tight-lipped as King.
maybe I can help.
she could use a win right now.
we all could.
you gonna charge King?
not with what you have.
we release him, he's in the wind.
Anton's dead.
so has King asked for legal counsel yet?
king knows we have nothing on him. why would he waste the money?
well, technically, if he's not represented,
I can't walk in there and offer him any deals.
not on the record, anyway.
come on. no one'll know the difference.
still a year from now, the recorded document shows upon CNN, uh-uh.
actually, that camera's been on the fritz.
it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't record anything.
Freebo's blood.
the link between his murder and Miguel.
if I go down, I can take Miguel with me.
mutual assurance. A symbol of trust.
fuck. that's it?
no way we're gonna let that monster walk.
are we?
I hope we meet again.
I'd like to get to know you better.
but how well can you really know someone?
how much do you want to know?
there's gotta be something.
all we got is Mario, who won't say shit.
I mean, we can start skinning him ourselves before he'd talk.
Morgan, we're not skinning Mario.
I got a better idea.
wanna share with the whole class?
no, just you. I need a partner on this.
here we are. home sweet home.
it's too bad Anton won't ever get to do that. Thanks to you.
what?
Los arboles.
holy shit.
you told him I revealed things?
we didn't tell him shit. He knew you were in holding.
he must have thought you caved.
I didn't tell anyone anything.
look, I'm sorry.
we didn't mean to get your family caught up in this, all right?
we'll do everything we can to help you.
what can you do? Nothing.
you're right. we don't even know where this guy is.
you gotta help me, or I can't do anything to help you.
then that's it. I'm sorry.
wait! he has a building.
we went through all of his holdings.
there's no record of him owning any building.
he rents it with cash.
he had me go there and pay once.
he's trying to grow trees to sell. - Where?
on 164th under the highway.
it's all I know.
mi familia.
go inside. lock the door. I'll send a patrol car. go.
it worked. get in. - Thank you.
Anton! Anton, are you in there?
Anton?
fuck restraint. Here.
Morgan! get out of the way.
it's me. it's okay. You're safe.
I need an ambulance at the 164 and the 94 asap.
get an apb out on George King.
you found me. you found me.
you can't get away from me that easily.
and the results are...
I, uh...
come on. I'll take you home.
I can't go home.
there's too much silence.
I know.
you don't want to have to think about what she went through.
only to realize that she's really gone. - Don't.
she's gone. - Don't.
okay?
and that's gonna hurt like hell. I know that too.
but you have friends.
you got me. I'm right here.
okay? I'm right here for you. to get you through.
it's not Freebo's blood. It's not even human.
it's bovine. Cow's blood.
he's been using me the whole time.
I didn't create a monster; I was used by one.
he used me.
Miguel!
nine holes tomorrow?
you bet.
today I keep up the pretense.
but soon, maybe tomorrow, Miguel will know exactly how I feel.
because finally there's an emotion I don't have to fake.
today, I feel something real.
do you know where you are? You were in an accident. - ambulance. What happened?
bad news is that you sustained a concussion.
I'd like to keep you here for observation.
Dexter, oh my god!
you all right? - I'm fine. Just a little fender bender.
doc says I'm good to go.
you got a minute? I'd, uh, like to pick your brain. Lisa Bell?
the girl in the bathtub. - Of course.
the trinity killer's most recent victim.
Trinity is going to kill again. Another woman, older than lisa bell this time.
but the person that you should really be talking to is my sister - she's lead on Lisa Bell.
you sure that's a good call? Given our history.
I wouldn't want to mislead you.
what I have with anton. It's - it's great.
I fucking love you.
the reason I'm in Miami is because I'm convinced these bathtub murders are connected to a series or murders all over the country.
godson - I'm an idiot. - Debra!
tell me again this isn't crazy.
crazy good.
I brought you a copy of my article.
a string of robberies turned deadly in what authorities are now calling the vacation murder.
I found your guy. Name's Johnny Rose.
briefing room in five minutes. Strategy meeting.
Dexter's turned up a lead on our shooter.
don't sweat it, Quinn.
I've got much bigger things to worry about.
I thought it was a fender bender.
I'm sure there's a bent fender somewhere in this mess.
Oh, my god.
Rita, what are you doing here? - you lied to me, Dexter.
the backyard barbecue.
it's a holdover from the last ice age when food was scarce
and men had to work together to take down such a large beast.
those who worked well with others survived,
and their genes have been passed down through the centuries until they landed here
in this...
my community.
soda?
whatever.
how about you?
I'm good.
Ah, wasted youth.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah.
I just got off the phone with Dr. Montgomery,
the doctor that took care of you after your accident.
Oh, right.
why didn't you tell me you had a concussion?
I just wanted to keep you from worrying. You already have so much to deal with.
a the doctor also told you that you weren't supposed to drive for the next ten days, and you didn't listen. So I will now be doing all your driving.
I will take you to work in the morning, and I will pick you up at the end of the day.
Rita, I'm perfectly capable - Dexter.
the past few weeks, you have not been the most present father and husband.
remember. We're a team here, right?
okay, we work together.
she's right.
maybe now's the time to turn that around. Score a few points.
which will then make Rita more likely to say yes when I need a little time for myself.
you're right. I'm sorry.
thank you. Let's go eat.
so I guess you saw somebody bashed in Kate's birdbath.
I know, that's awful.
poor birds.
and poor kate. - Why would someone do such a thing?
the same reason he knocked over the Andersons' water fountain,
pulled down the Garcias' basketball hoop
and spray-painted the Schwarzs' trash cans. Because he's a dick.
he knocked the sea horse off my mailbox, too.
I hated that sea horse.
well, your mom picked it out.
you know Andy. - uh, yeah, of course.
Hi, how are you doing? Hey, Jess, Jess, Jess?
do you really need to be doing that?
Yeah, I really do.
his wife passed away last year.
so, uh, so about this neighborhood vandal.
we all need to work together to deal with this guy.
the last thing we need is a dangerous presence in our neighborhood.
you know, it's a funny thing, Dexter.
this all started to happen time you moved in.
a little suspicious, don't you think?
I'm just busting your chops.
Oh.
my chops are busted.
the danger of community is that the people who don't belong are looked upon with suspicion.
those of us who prefer to work by ourselves,
the lone wolves, risk being singled out.
Cody. What's that?
Waah!
I'm gonna get you! - oh, I'm scared!
so I become an expert at blending in,
camouflaging myself, becoming one of the guys.
astor, what's that?
Oh, my god. - Dexter!
I'm so humiliated.
what were you thinking?
she was wearing a bathing suit.
this blending in thing isn't as easy as it looks.
we're here.
stop right here.
that's okay.
Oh, god, please. Don't hurt me!
Oh, god! Oh, god!
don't do anything stupid.
careful, now.
wouldn't want to hurt yourself.
it's pretty, isn't it?
okay, now. It's time for you to jump.
what?
God, no. - Yes.
it always ends like this. - No, but
it's already over.
why are you doing this to me?
you know I'm not to blame here.
come on, now.
please, no!
now you just need to let go...
and fall. - Please, I'll do anything.
good. Jump. - no, I can't!
you can. - I have children!
I know. Jason and Susie.
if you like, I can swing by your house, put an ice pick in your husband's head,
and bring your kids back, and throw them off one at a time
until you finally decide to jump.
is that what you want?
please...
what? - Please.
just push me.
it doesn't work that way.
jump.
mommy.
you've only been here a month, and they've already got you tagged.
it's not just me. There are other houses.
Dex, we've been through this before.
11th grade. Bunch of kids tp'ed the house.
and you made me clean it up.
because it raised questions, Dexter.
it would have made people think, "why this kid? Why him?"
you can't afford to have people asking those questions.
no one's asking questions.
getting married, having a kid,
moving here - I know you're under a lot of pressure.
Yeah, I am.
but you can't let things slip.
I'm not slipping. But somebody is.
how come you never make the coffee even if you're up first?
because I don't want it bad enough to make it.
I don't even know what to say to that.
well, baby, if there was chocolate cake here I would eat it, but I sure as hell don't want to bake one.
Hey! Good news! - Yeah?
Yeah, the Sandpiper Hotel wants to book my band for a one-month gig.
three nights a week.
wow, that's great. - No more cruise ships.
and best of all it means no more time away from you.
Really? - yeah, I'll be here every day. Going to bed with you every night.
waking up with you every morning.
waiting for you to make me coffee.
okay, if I count yesterday, then this is day two of me being the best husband in the world.
I can last another five days. I really need to stop for a coffee someplace.
really, I started saturday afternoon,
so it's actually been more like 2 1/2 days.
I'm never gonna make it.
as far as our vacation murder suspect, Johnny Rose,
we've still come up with nothing.
we've spoken to his mother, his sister, his past two employers
everyone in his apartment building, his mailman, - the liquor store guy across the street. - So no one's talking.
we have his immediate family members under surveillance, - but we're still not getting any hits. - Well, expand the search.
draw up a new list of subjects. Morgan, where do we stand on the Lisa Bell murder?
somewhere in the middle of shit creek. - Well, you better find a paddle, or I'm moving you onto the vacation murder with the rest of us.
finding Johnny Rose is our number-one priority. - Yes, ma'am.
quick question: do you like the dolphins?
I'm really more of a manatee guy, but sure.
club level seats.
enjoy. - Why?
I can't go.
and I asked myself, who's a friend that I could give 'em to?
so I thought of you.
Miami dolphins.
football. - Club level?
jeez, who do I gotta fuck to get those kind of tickets?
here.
no fucking.
dude. - All right, listen up.
we got a report of a female body found at the old port. It looks like a jumper.
who wants it? - Sounds exciting, sarge,
but I think I'm gonna hold out for a cat stuck in a tree.
I wonder if that's the woman Lundy predicted.
we'll take it. - Okay.
unless she landed on a pile of marshmallows, there's gonna be blood.
grab your kit. - Sure, I'll follow you there.
not a chance, concussion-boy.
Rita said no driving for you. You're coming with us.
climb in the back, Dexter.
you'll be right on the subwoofer. You can feel the bass in your spine.
loud.
female. Caucasian. Mid-30s, I'm guessing.
if this is the latest victim of lundy's trinity killer,
then he's a very different monster than I am.
because of death?
gravity.
why her? Why here?
what is trinity's code?
does he have one?
no sign of a struggle. No pre-mortem bruising.
no ligature marks. - It's looking like a suicide to me.
Oh, well, if it isn't special agent grandpa.
shut up, Quinn. - Detectives.
Morgan. - Agent lundy.
Masuka. - cool hat.
you have a name yet?
driver's license in her car says Tarla Grant from Fort Lauderdale.
so what brings you to our little suicide?
just observing.
you're a little quick to decide it's a suicide, aren't you?
still has her jewelry, money in her wallet. Wasn't robbed.
well, why would she drive down from fort lauderdale to jump off this abandoned warehouse?
maybe she liked seagulls. - Well, until we know one way or the other
I'd like to treat this as a homicide if that's okay with you.
all right.
you two, on the sixth floor.
the rest of you, search the grounds. - victim: Tarla Grant. 30s...
so listen...
I want to apologize for being such a douche the other night.
no need.
we're all allowed to be the occasional... douche.
Thanks.
it was pretty embarrassing.
Debra, if we're being completely honest here, then, yes, I did come to Miami to follow a case. But
I have to admit that I'm glad the killer chose this city,
knowing I'd find you here.
so is Dexter right? Did you predict this jumper?
what I did was suggest that if trinity held to his pattern,
we could expect to see another woman die soon.
is this her?
little early to tell.
but you might want to check your missing persons reports.
I wouldn't be surprised to discover that she's married with two kids.
what else? - I'm very curious to know if there was a similar death
at this site 30 years ago.
I make my bodies disappear.
Trinity leaves his out in the open,
supremely confident that no one will ever trace them to him,
decade after decade...
after decade.
thanks for the ride. - Anytime, partner.
great, security lights.
just what every serial killer needs.
what are you looking at?
did you get my message about the neighborhood watch meeting?
actually, no, I didn't.
this is my community.
I am one of you.
great. Love having the neighbors over.
are you ready to fight crime, Dexter?
you betcha. - That's good.
be aware of your neighbors. Know their schedules.
that way you'll know if something's different, if anything seems off.
we don't want that. - Here, have a whistle and a head flashlight.
it'll keep your hands free when you're out patrolling.
patrolling? We're patrolling?
your job is to watch and report, watch and report.
watch and report. - You got it.
community college for me now.
Hey, Dexter, our neighborhood beautification association
asked me to give this to you. I'm the secretary.
it's a warning against the graffiti on your gate.
I know it's silly, but they want you to repaint.
Hey, Dex.
I guess you saw the new motion-detector lights I just put in.
sure are bright.
Yeah, brightest I could get.
made sure I angled one right on your place, too.
that's very neighborly of you.
we have to look out for each other.
Yeah, this guy started off small, a few broken windows, Andy's mailbox, but yesterday he broke into the Walkers' guest house and trashed the place.
Yeah, next thing he'll be stealing our women.
can't let him steal our women, now, can we?
no, they're our women.
is that the sign-up sheet? - yeah, yeah.
see, we're setting up patrols for every night of the week.
I'm good for every night but wednesday. I got a poker night at the lodge.
great. - No one will come in or out of this neighborhood unnoticed.
including me.
it's not the neighborhood vandal I'm worried about. It's the neighborhood watch.
graffiti.
excuse me.
so I was all set to go to the university of miami next year
till my dad decided to get himself laid off.
that blows.
how about you, Jesse?
you want to sign up for the neighborhood watch?
sounds kind of lame.
so lame.
paint can, soda can - I'm thinking fingerprints.
let me get that for you.
and I know one little lady who is up past her bedtime.
mom!
Dexter, you can't treat her like a little girl anymore.
I can't?
Hey, Dex. - Hey, Elliot.
have a nice day!
you knew this day would come, Dexter.
you've always been good with kids, but eventually they grow up.
they become more mature,
develop complex emotions that just aren't in your skill set.
astor's becoming a whole person, and you're...
something less. - I hope you're not taking any of this seriously.
the wife, the kids, the house in the suburbs.
it's all great camouflage, but that's all it is.
it's gotten more complicated than that.
then uncomplicate it.
you need to realize your limitations.
remember exactly who you are.
probably should have used something a little darker.
it's fine, dad. Nothing's gonna show through.
I hope not, Dex. For your sake.
Hey, you ready to go? - Almost.
I've got the best of bananarama.
it's a cruel summer.
as long as the neighborhood vandal keeps my neighbors on edge, I will have no privacy.
and I'm not going to let you do that to me, Jesse.
match.
married, mother of two.
it fits. - It fits what?
Lundy's theory.
that she's another victim of the serial killer.
Yes.
what? - His whole life is about serial killers.
that's all he thinks about, so of course he thinks she was killed by a serial killer.
I think he's a little smarter than that.
I'm sure you do, otherwise you wouldn't be sitting at your desk going through 30-year-old files all afternoon.
Oh, yeah, guess what.
so are you.
just unsealed the juvey records of johnny rose, - our vacation murder suspect. - Anything?
shoplifting with his high school girlfriend, Nikki Wald.
that was like, what, ten years ago? - Em.
you think they're still in touch?
since she testified against him back then, I'd say extremely unlikely.
well, at this point, I think we need to take any shot we can.
she lives in Oakland park. I'll drive out there with you.
let's go.
that seem accidental and unplanned to you?
even I believed it.
I was thinking we could stop somewhere for lunch first.
I know a little place where we can order some room service.
okay, here we go. 30 years ago to the week.
female, caucasian, 36, mother of two.
jumped to her death off the same warehouse.
the woman's family insisted she was the victim of foul play,
but it was ruled a suicide.
doesn't mean fuck-all.
someone fell or jumped off the same warehouse eight years ago.
someone else jumped off a ship loading crane
on the same pier back in '86,
and another body washed up on the rocks
right in front of the warehouse only two years ago.
nobody knows how it got there. This is Miami, Deb.
people die. - And sometimes it's by murder.
I want to follow up on this.
okay, Tarla Grant seemed to have a pretty decent life.
no apparent reason for suicide, - so keep it open for now. - Fucking A we'll keep it open.
I'd know that foul mouth anywhere.
Anton, what are you doing here?
I love you too, baby. Come on, let's have some lunch.
I have a fuckload of work to do.
all right.
all right, but it's a working lunch.
Ah, solitude.
something I won't enjoy again until I deal with Jesse,
the neighborhood shithead.
Hey, Dexter.
Hey.
Dexter, I was looking for you.
Hello, Debra. - Hi.
may I? - Yeah.
Frank Lundy. - Anton Briggs. - My lover
friend. My boyfriend.
all of the above.
so, Dexter, I was wondering if you'd gotten the blood tox results back on Tarla Grant yet?
Yeah, I should check on that right away.
please, finish your lunch.
all done.
Tarla grant, just like you said:
36 years old, married, mother of two.
that's a shame. - I found the matching 30-year-old case.
what's that? - Big case we're working on.
I'm afraid I've enlisted Debra in another of my mad theories.
Ah.
what's it all about? - Finding out who killed her.
I don't suppose you happened to bring the, uh - 30-year-old file?
read the husband's statement from 30 years ago.
family never believed it was a suicide.
but since trinity never leaves a trace,
there was nothing to investigate.
you give good room service, Angel.
you know, we should do lunch out more often.
missed one.
no arrests since she got busted with rose back in high school.
spotty job record, but that's about it. - It's a stretch, I know.
I'm not sure miss Nikki Wald is home.
okay.
Hey, I'm sergeant Batista from Miami metro homicide.
it's rose. - Get down!
shots fired, 41st and Andrews. We need backup!
good? - Yeah, I'm good, let's go.
suspects Johnny rRose and Nikki Wald going northbound on 41st street - in a white sedan. - I think it was gray.
a light-colored sedan. Make? Model?
suspects are armed and dangerous.
Rita thinks I'm with the neighborhood watch.
truth is, I'm gonna do a little more than watch.
there's dad, off to his weekly poker game.
and if I were the delinquent son,
I would take advantage of my father's absence.
going after him feels very familiar,
except it won't have its usual satisfying ending.
the best I can do is scare a little sense into this kid.
Hey! Come on, it's the vandal. Let's get him!
Oh, fuck.
it's watch and report, assholes. Not watch and chase.
this is so humiliating.
go that way.
this neighborhood's gonna kill me.
already? I mean, the kids aren't even dressed yet. - I know, I know, I'm early.
just wanted you to see the latest work of the vandal.
happened in the middle of the night.
he obviously smashed the window, released the emergency brake,
gave it a shove, and, uh, let it roll.
so dangerous.
is that Cody's bike?
Oh, my god. What if he had been out here playing?
these dummies share the same size and weight distribution
as our victim. At this height, any variant in trajectory resulting from a simple jump or being pushed off the building will be evident in where they land.
what if she took a running leap?
people don't kill themselves that way. They just let go.
Oh, hey, either of you interested in buying tickets to the dolphins game?
club level? I'll let them go for 500 bucks.
Where'd you get those? - Dexter.
son of a bitch.
come on, we have dummies to drop.
is he gonna pay me for those?
must be weird for you
Lundy coming back. - Why would it be weird? You're weird.
none of my business, I know.
but...
if I loved someone, and that person was gone,
and then I moved on, and then found someone else,
and then that first person all of a sudden showed up again,
I don't know - I've never had that problem.
but it's gotta be a little confusing.
maybe.
a little. - So then maybe if you know that it's supposed to be weird and confusing,
then maybe it's a little easier to handle.
Thanks.
it's always the same three kills with trinity
a young woman in a bathtub,
followed by a mother falling to her death,
and ending with a man getting bludgeoned.
I put her in a short shirt so that we can see her panties while she's falling.
specific.
how many times that you know of?
I've got the bits and pieces that add up to at least 15 cycles.
since we just turned the clock back another 15 years,
I'm sure there are considerably more.
that's impressive.
in a very evil way.
what's really impressive is that I can't prove a thing.
could never get anyone at the bureau convinced. He's that good.
why do you think he's so successful?
Trinity's likely someone who's gone his own solitary way through life,
so preoccupied with his own obsessions
that he's foregone all but the most rudimentary of human connections.
a lone wolf.
exactly.
it's a little bit disturbing.
Yeah. - I mean...
I could just as well be talking about myself.
sure, I've been married.
was married for 29 years, happily.
but even so,
the only thing that really got my heart beating
was the hunt.
I'm sure you can't relate.
no, sorry.
and now here I am at 60,
watching dummies fly off a roof,
still on the hunt.
it sounds like trinity is worthy prey.
what's really got me intrigued
is the notion that he's returned to Miami.
he's come home.
I'm not sure "home" is the right word.
people like us don't really belong anywhere.
we just pass through.
drink up.
you're next.
the vacation murders.
word is, you know who Johnny Rose's accomplice is.
forget it, you'll get the press release same time as everyone else.
but my sergeant and lieutenant were almost killed yesterday,
so if you put any negative spin on it, I'll be very angry.
when you're angry, you're very sexy,
so this could be sort of a win-win for me.
let's just say I'll be angry in a very withholding sort of way.
okay.
the bathtub murder? - Still under investigation.
the jumper at the old port building?
ditto. I gotta run. See you tonight?
sure.
can you just go over the figures one more time?
they're not gonna change.
the test results indicate that Tarla Grant jumped, rather than was pushed.
I don't buy it. I think we're looking at a murder victim.
Deb, we also got the autopsy report. She had a small tumor.
talked to the husband. They just found out last week.
maybe she was taking the easy way out.
maybe she was determined to fight it.
that doesn't mean she killed herself.
I checked her cell phone records. No text messages, no suicide note.
not everyone leaves a note.
I just got word.
we will be debriefed on our shooting incident in the morning.
okay, good.
we need to get our stories straight about why we left the precinct at 12: 30
and didn't get to Wald's apartment until after 3: 00.
we grabbed some lunch and then we had a flat tire.
flat tire it is.
you okay?
I've read Masuka's notes. That, along with the autopsy reports,
leads me to believe that there's no reason to keep Tarla's case open as a murder investigation.
lieutenant, I think it's premature to close it.
Lundy has this theory - you don't work for lundy.
you're welcome to pursue this, but between the vacation murders
and Lisa Bell, I think you're gonna be very busy.
you're on your own with this one.
poor Cody.
Ouch.
Where'd the glass come from?
that car on Elliot's lawn.
Cody was coming back from their pool, and he stepped on a piece.
does he need stitches? - No, he's fine, he's just scared.
first his bike, now this.
poor guy. Give him a hug for me.
help me out here, Dexter.
I've been going out of my way trying to make things good with you, but no matter what I do, you just throw it back in my face.
you don't need to make things good with me.
come on, what's it gonna take?
I don't care if you're a dirty cop.
if I didn't take that money, it would just sit inside a locker until some fatass
who sits behind a desk grabs it to buy new carpet for his office which he never leaves.
I put my life on the line every day. I give this job everything I've got,
and I can't even afford a down payment on a condo.
I thought you had family money. - Had, and that has nothing to do with anything.
just don't fucking call me dirty.
the last thing I need is a cop mad at me.
look, you're right, I take it all back.
I honestly don't give a shit.
just keep my sister out of it, okay?
you don't understand any of this, do you?
you can't, 'cause you're not a cop.
you're not one of us.
cops: another community I'm not part of.
what?
it's so crowded in there.
well, I guess so. A wife and three kids.
they're always there.
tell me about it.
it was easy living with anton when he was never home.
I'd come back to a quiet apartment and unwind without having to deal with anybody.
now, as soon as I walk through the door, he's there, waiting to engage.
there's no escape.
and now lundy shows up.
is that good or bad?
I have no fucking clue.
what?
we're complaining because people want to be with us?
how lame is that?
you think Tarla Grant killed herself?
no, I don't.
Masuka said she wasn't thrown or pushed from the building.
she jumped.
what would make her do that?
fear is a powerful motivator.
you should go inside. You're home.
Thanks. - Yeah.
Hi. - Hi, sweetie.
where is everybody? - I'm in here.
fort Cody.
Hey, buddy, how's your foot?
it's better.
good.
keep holding down the fort. - Okay.
and I'll take care of my end
once you guys go to sleep tonight.
you may want to talk to astor.
this is one of those moments when I wish I was like everyone else.
I'm sure other people would know what to say.
I know you're not a little kid anymore.
Duh.
I'm sorry.
it's just...
sometimes I'm...
dumb.
it's okay.
you can be dumb.
Thanks.
what?
it's funny.
a few months ago, after a shoot-up like this,
people saw me leaning against you, they wouldn't think twice.
they still wouldn't think twice.
they don't know anything about us. - I know.
but I think twice.
I'm constantly worried that people will misinterpret.
let them misinterpret.
I need this as much as you do.
this Dexter guy. First of all, who the fuck is named Dexter?
that feels good.
what, did his parents know he was gonna grow up to be a fucking egghead?
I met him. He seems okay.
he's a lab geek.
fuck, that feels good.
what else? - What else?
I'm exhausted.
I spent all afternoon in the sun
throwing dummies off a warehouse, because super agent Lundy has a hunch that the dead woman is connected to this big serial killer case.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
Lundy always gets his man.
yeah?
well, so do I.
this is where I first noticed the pattern.
raleigh, north Carolina, 1993.
that got you curious?
then I found San Francisco, Louisville,
Detroit, Richmond.
eight different cities in all that I know of.
never the same place twice.
until now.
ready for another?
Oh. Yeah.
so now this is your little retirement project?
you're completely incapable of relaxing, aren't you?
that's just it. This is how I relax.
I get the scent of a bad guy, I can feel my blood pressure go down.
and here I thought I was bad.
you are.
you're exactly the same as me,
just in a much prettier package.
are you flirting with me, agent Lundy?
simply stating the truth, miss.
thank you.
excuse me just a second.
Hey.
Hey, so you want me to order some takeout?
I'm still working, so I'll just grab something here.
okay, well, I love you, babe.
me too.
Ah, jesse, hard at work. Big surprise.
I'm gonna wait in your room and scare the shit out of you.
if you're in here...
apparently I'm not the only one who isn't exactly what he seems.
is that the wrench you use to break windows?
what the heck? - Don't move.
okay, what's going on? Who are you?
you're gonna stop breaking things, stop rolling cars down the street.
stop everything you've been doing.
if you so much as touch another window, I will come back here,
and I will leave with your head in a bag.
I already have the bag.
fuck you!
let go of me, you fucking asshole!
fuck!
you really don't know what you're doing here.
I know exactly what I want to fucking do, piece of fucking shit.
you should've seen their faces.
those boxes in their driveways with their big fucking flat-screen tvs.
Oh, look at us, aren't we so fucking rich?
they're lucky the only thing I broke was their fucking windows.
and you're lucky I don't break your fucking neck.
it's over. - Fuck you, it's over.
give up. - No!
I played by the rules my entire life.
and look what it got me.
my wife's dead.
I lost my job. My son hates me, and now...
the bank wants to take my house away.
so if you want to take my fucking head, you take it.
I said stop.
you want me to come back for your son's head too?
what? No! Not my boy!
it's all I have!
you're gonna save what's left of your family,
save what's left of yourself.
because all that other stuff
is over.
say it.
Yeah, it's over.
bad news for Andy is he's lost his house.
good news for me is he'll be out of the neighborhood.
but why should I care about him? It's his world.
people like him made it this way.
at least he had a chance to belong.
it's still there, Dex.
a stain so deep it can't be erased.
man: TWO TREASURE HUNTERS MADE A GHASTLY DISCOVERY TODAY
when THEY STUMBLED ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE
an UNDERWATER GRAVEYARD IN A CREVICE OFF THE COAST OF MIAMI.
Debra: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? MEANS THERE MIGHT BE A NEW MASS MURDERER OUT THERE,
way WORSE THAN THE ICE-TRUCK KILLER.
the "BAY HARBOR BUTCHER"?
that's WHAT THE PRESS IS CALLING WHOEVER DUMPED BODIES OFFSHORE.
the LAST THING MIAMI NEEDS IS ANOTHER SERIAL KILLER.
13 AND COUNTING.
they're SO SWAMPED UP THERE,
they HAD TO BRING IN OUTSIDE TALENT.
Doakes: FRANK LUNDY? THE GREEN RIVER KILLER, THE D. C. SNIPER
if THE CASE WAS IMPOSSIBLE, HE BROKE IT.
Dexter: SO, THIS IS THE MAN WHO STANDS BETWEEN ME AND DEATH ROW.
with YOUR HELP, WE'LL FIND WHOEVER DID THIS AWFUL THING.
so, LET'S GET A JUMP-START ON THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
with DOAKES TAILING ME,
my LIFE'S BEEN ALL JEKYLL AND NO HYDE.
paul KEPT INSISTING TO ME
that YOU KNOCKED HIM OVER THE HEAD,
dragged HIM TO HIS MOTEL, AND SHOT HIM UP WITH DRUGS.
I HIT PAUL TO PROTECT YOU AND THE KIDS.
look, IF THERE IS ANYTHING LEFT BETWEEN US,
you WILL ANSWER ME THIS ONE QUESTION
and YOU WILL TELL ME THE TRUTH.
are YOU AN ADDICT?
Yes, I HAVE AN ADDICTION.
an Inconvenient Lie
my NAME IS CAROLINE.
I'm AN ADDICT.
all: HI, CAROLINE.
Caroline: UM, I STARTED TAKING PAIN PILLS
after MY BACK SURGERY.
I DON'T NEED THEM FOR THE PAIN ANYMORE.
now I...
now I JUST NEED THEM.
and I NEED DUCT TAPE -- THREE OR FOUR ROLLS.
running LOW ON HEAVY-DUTY TRASH BAGS.
when's THE LAST TIME I SHARPENED MY KNIVES?
and I LOST MY LICENSE.
tears NOW?
it's VERY HARD TO CONCENTRATE IN HERE.
how AM I SUPPOSE TO GET ANY WORK DONE?
my HUSBAND SAYS HE'S GONNA LEAVE ME IF I DON'T STAY SOBER.
but I HAVE TO DO THIS FOR MYSELF.
no SELF-CONTROL, LOST EVERYTHING, TRYING TO STOP.
same WHINY STORY OVER AND OVER FOR...
10 MINUTES -- FEELS LIKE 10 HOURS.
...taking LORTABS AND DARVOCET AND PERCOCET
and ANYTHING I COULD GET MY HANDS ON.
and EVEN NOW...
I'd KILL FOR A VICODIN.
lightweight.
first I THOUGHT, "NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS," I DON'T BELONG HERE.
you GUYS ARE REAL ADDICTS.
RITA: SO, HOW WAS THE MEETING? TELL ME EVERYTHING.
it WAS, UH, INTERESTING,
hearing THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
knowing YOU'RE NOT ALONE. EXACTLY.
did YOU GET FORTUNE COOKIES?
only THE ONES WITH THE GOOD FORTUNES.
so, DID YOU SHARE OR JUST LISTEN?
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE IT ALL IN MY FIRST TIME OUT.
think THEY FORGOT...
Ah, HERE THEY ARE. SPRING ROLLS.
and WHAT ABOUT A SPONSOR? DID YOU FIND ONE?
I DIDN'T WANT TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING.
it's AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP.
Absolutely.
okay, SO, LET'S SEE YOUR NEWCOMER'S CHIP.
newcomer's CHIP.
you DID STAY UNTIL THE END, DIDN'T YOU?
of COURSE I DID. RIGHT TO THE END.
you're A TERRIBLE LIAR.
I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT 12-STEP PROGRAMS TO BE EASILY CONNED, DEXTER.
I DIDN'T STAY TILL THE END END, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.
I HAD SOME IMPORTANT ERRANDS TO RUN.
Mmm. IMPORTANT?
what? AM I IMPORTANT? ARE THE KIDS?
Yeah.
Yes, OF COURSE.
well, YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW IMPORTANT,
because IF YOU DON'T WORK THE PROGRAM
and I MEAN REALLY WORK IT -- I JUST...
I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.
all RIGHT, KIDS. DINNER.
how IMPORTANT ARE THEY?
I'm SURE SOMEONE WITH A HEART COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
tomorrow. I'LL GO TOMORROW.
I'll STAY.
okay.
okay? OKAY.
hold THE ELEVATOR!
Thanks.
nice DODGE LAST NIGHT, FLOORING IT THROUGH THAT YELLOW LIGHT.
were YOU BEHIND ME?
see YOU TONIGHT.
LaGuerta: WE WILL GET TO ALL OF YOU.
okay, TAKE THEIR NAMES
and KEEP THEM OUT OF THE BULLPEN TILL WE FIGURE THIS OUT.

who ARE THEY?
Batista: EVERY FAMILY MEMBER OF EVERY MISSING PERSON FOR THE LAST DECADE.
including SOME SAD, LONELY, AND PRESUMABLY SINGLE WOMEN,

it's NOT HER FAULT. THAT REPORTER'S AN ASSHOLE.
sergeant?
Yeah, HOLD THE REST OF THEM DOWNSTAIRS.
we're OUT OF ROOM HERE.

you KNOW, PASCAL IS JUST CAUGHT IN A CYCLE OF REACTION.
she's NOT CO-CREATING HER OWN REALITY.
you KNOW THOSE WORDS DON'T ACTUALLY MEAN ANYTHING, RIGHT?
look AROUND YOU, BRO. SHE'S MANIFESTING NEGATIVITY.
Masuka: IT'S ON AGAIN.
excuse ME, LIEUTENANT? NO COMMENT.
we HAVE REPORTS THERE WERE DOZENS OF BODIES FOUND IN THAT UNDERWATER GRAVE SITE.
not DOZENS.
the BOSS' SWEATER MELONS LOOK BIGGER ON TV.
the OPERATIVE WORD IS "BOSS." SHOW SOME RESPECT.
I THOUGHT I WAS.
one DOZEN? TWO DOZEN? 18 OR SO. excuse me.
have THE FAMILIES BEEN NOTIFIED?
we're STILL TRYING TO IDENTIFY THEM.
if VIEWERS HAVE INFORMATION, THEY SHOULD CONTACT YOU?
Yes. FINE.
so, THERE YOU HAVE IT.
police ARE SEEKING ANY LEADS THAT CAN HELP THEM IDENTIFY
the 18 FACELESS VICTIMS OF THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
if YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATIO PLEASE CONTACT...
pascal IS DEFINITELY OFF HER GAME.
word IS, HER FIANC? IS CATCHING SOME STRANGE ON THE SLY.
that'd DO IT.
the SHIT STOPS HERE. GIVE IT TO ME.
Dexter: MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WON'T FIND ANSWERS HERE.
chances ARE GOOD
their LOVED ONES WEREN'T AMONG MY CHOSEN FEW.
MATTHEWS: MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?
first OF ALL, I WANT TO TELL YOU
what A GREAT JOB YOU'VE ALL BEEN DOING ON THIS HORRIFIC CASE.
and WITH THE HELP OF THE BEST MAN HUNTER IN THE FBI,
we SHOULD HAVE ANSWERS SOON.
in THE MEANTIME, THE DAILY WORK OF THIS PRECINCT MUST CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC,

Vince MASUKA AND HIS TEAM ARE GATHERING DNA, PRINTS, AND DENTAL RECORDS.
the REST OF US ARE GOING TO CULL THROUGH COLD CASES AND MISSING-PERSONS FILES.
also, I WANT THAT CROWD OUT THERE INTERVIEWED
though MOST OF THEM WILL BE A WASTE OF TIME.
negative THINKING.
you FOUR, MOVE THEM OUT AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN,
but BE THOROUGH.
if WE GET EVEN ONE HIT, IT'LL BE WORTH IT.
everyone ELSE, WORK THE FILES.
remember, I. D.s WILL LEAD TO A PATTERN,
which WILL LEAD TO OUR MAN.
when THE MANHUNT IS ON, THE HUNTED GO SHOPPING.
not FOR A NEW CAR
for MY NEXT PROJECT.
I WON'T ACT ON IT...YET.
I'm STILL LAYING LOW. HARRY WOULD INSIST ON THAT.
just GETTING THE RESEARCH OUT OF THE WAY.
someone TALKED HIS WAY INTO THE HOMES OF TWO WOMEN
and DIDN'T LEAVE TILL THEY WERE DEAD.
Ann COHEN AND, A MONTH BEFORE HER, LYNN HALL.
a CERTAIN CAR DEALERSHIP RAN CREDIT CHECKS ON BOTH WOMEN.
both BOUGHT CARS ELSEWHERE,
so NOBODY THOUGHT ABOUT IT TWICE.
but WHO REQUESTED THOSE CREDIT CHECKS?
all I NEED IS SOME DNA PROOF
cup OF COFFEE SHOULD DO THE TRICK.
how MANY KIDS YOU GOT?
enough.
I HEAR YOU.
when MY TWO CAME ALONG, IT WAS BYE-BYE, CONVERTIBLE.
of COURSE... THEY'RE WORTH IT.
must TAKE AFTER THEIR MOM.
that THEY DO. THANK GOD.
I TELL YOU, I MISS MY CONVERTIBLE,
but, UH, TRUTH
my MINIVAN'S GOT A MUCH NICER RIDE.
so YOU OWN ONE.
Oh, THE SAME ONE YOU'RE LOOKING AT.
I MEAN, I KNOW -- WHIPPED, RIGHT?
but, UH, MY KIDS LOVE THE TWIN DVDs.
they're JUST CRAZY ABOUT SPONGEBOB, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
actually, I DO.
my WIFE LOVES THE NAV SYSTEM AND ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES.
and WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY...
you're HAPPY. THAT'S RIGHT.
except THE KIDS DON'T EXIST, NEITHER DOES THE WIFE.
and HE OWNS A BEEMER, NOT A MINIVAN.
still, HE'S SEAMLESS.
impressive.
it's NOT FLASHY, BUT...
what DID FLASH EVER GET ME?
it GOT ME PULLED OVER, THAT'S WHAT.
I'm DEFINITELY NOT INTO FLASH.
you GOT TO SIT IN THE CAPTAIN'S CHAIR, THOUGH.
it's LIKE A 747, MAN.
manuel, HOLD UP.
thank YOU, SIR.
so, UH...
we SHOULD TAKE IT OUT. CHECK OUT THE RIDE.
I'm JUST DOING RESEARCH.
okay, YOU DON'T WANT A BIG SALES PITCH.
I GET THAT.
let ME AT LEAST PULL THE SPECS FOR YOU.
because, RUTHFULLY,
we HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING THESE ON THE LOT.
you MIGHT WANT TO GRAB THE TEST-DRIVE
while IT'S STILL HERE.
I THINK I HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED
to MAKE A DECISION.
yeah?
well, THEN, YOU'VE SEEN THE, UH, THE STOW 'N GO SEATING SYSTEM, RIGHT?
I HAVE HAD EVERYTHING IN HERE
from A SOCCER TEAM TO A FREAKIN' DEER CARCASS.
it WAS AN ACCIDENT, OF COURSE.
but, UH, I SURE WAS GLAD FOR THE AMPLE CARGO SPACE,
not TO MENTION THE TINTED WINDOWS.
I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT COME IN HANDY.
I'll JUST GRAB THE KEYS.
I GO TO STALK A KILLER AND I END UP WITH A NEW CAR?
how'd THAT HAPPEN?
new CAR?
Yeah.
you GET MARRIED?
not THAT I KNOW OF.
so WHAT'S WITH THE MOMMY MOBILE?
I'm, UH...
not SURE.
synthetic.
even ROGER'S HAIR IS A LIE.
I COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO FROM THIS GUY.
who's YOUR DADDY?
dude, THE LEAD FORENSICS INVESTIGATOR
of THE JOINT TASK FORCE -- THAT'S WHO.
Oh, OKAY.
so, YOU WANT IN ON THIS BITCH OR NOT?
what BITCH?
the ONLY BITCH IN TOWN, BABY. THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
I GOT YOU TEMPORARILY ASSIGNED.
Vince, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
nothing SEXY, OF COURSE,
just SOME BONE-MARROW COLLECTION FOR DNA I. D.s.
but IT'LL GET YOU IN THE TENT.
and YOU GOT TO SEE THE TENT.
amazing.
say IT.
you're MY DADDY.
it SOUNDS WEIRD WHEN YOU SAY IT.
I HAVEN'T BEEN MUCH USE SINCE HE DISAPPEARED.
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO MOVE ON,
but...
here's THE PICTURE OF HIM.
he LOOKS...
...NICE.
not ACCORDING TO MY MOTHER... OR THE POLICE.
he WAS IN AND OUT OF JAIL,
but MY HEART RACED WHENEVER I SAW HIM.
I BROUGHT HIS TOOTHBRUSH.
they SAY YOU CAN GET DNA OFF IT.
you CAN FIND HIM WITH THIS, RIGHT?
special AGENT LUNDY?
look, THANKS FOR CHOOSING ME FOR THE TASK FORCE AND ALL,
but I'D APPRECIATE YOU FINDING SOMEONE ELSE.
you WANT OFF?
just AS SOON AS YOU CAN REPLACE ME, SIR.
this IS A CHANCE TO SOLVE A PRETTY IMPORTANT CASE.
most PEOPLE GET INTO THIS LINE OF WORK TO DO JUST THAT.
well, I'VE GOT CASES OF MY OWN BACKING UP,
and THE PRECINCT'S SHORTHANDED WITH ALL THIS SHIT.
so, IF YOU DON'T MIND...
I'll SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
in THE MEANTIME, IF YOU COULD CONTINUE THE INTERVIEWS...
Yeah. YEAH, OF COURSE.
thank YOU.
most OF 'EM HAVE BEEN UNDERWATER FOR YEARS.
but SOME, IT'S AWESOME, YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL.
the TEMPERATURE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR
and THE AIRTIGHT BAGS KEPT THEM INTACT.
I MEAN, A LITTLE GELATINOUS RESIDUE, SURE. BUT...
I'd RATHER REMEMBER MY OLD PLAYMATES AS THEY WERE
neat, CLEAN LITTLE PACKAGES.
you KNOW, VINCE, I APPRECIATE YOU DOING ME THIS FAVOR BUT
actually, YOU'RE DOING ME THE FAVOR.
I NEED YOUR HELP, BUDDY.
the PRESSURE'S FUCKING RIDONKULOUS.
glad TO BE OF SERVICE.
field MORGUE FOR THE OVERFLOW,
but IT'S STATE-OF-THE-ART.
fucking FBI, EH?
a GOOD PERCENTAGE ARE JUST BONES.
must HAVE FED THE FISH WHEN THE BAGS TORE.
Humpty FUCKING DUMPTY, RIGHT?
exactly.
they WEREN'T MEANT TO BE PUT TOGETHER AGAIN.
they WERE MEANT TO REMAIN IN THE SILENT SHADOWS,
keeping THEIR SECRETS.
now THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE GLARE,
reflecting MY DARKNESS LIKE SOME GROTESQUE CARNIVAL MIRROR.
Harry WAS RIGHT -- NOTHING STAYS BURIED.
perhaps NOT EVEN ME.
looking FOR MY TAURUS, SERGEANT?
keep LOOKING.
you DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TONIGHT.
and GENIUS ME,
not ONLY DO I LEAVE MY WORKS IN MY GIRLFRIEND'S CAR,
but ALSO ALL THE DEAD FISH FROM THE FISHING TRIP, RIGHT?
then I COLLAPSE IN HER PARENTS' HOUSE,
scare HER KIDS,
and GET MYSELF FIRED, 'CAUSE GUESS WHAT
we WORK TOGETHER.
Yeah.
so, NOW, WELL,
I'm 20-DAYS SOBER...
again...
hoping TO MAKE IT TO 21.
Thanks, GORDON.
this MEETING RECOGNIZES LENGTHS OF SOBRIETY WITH CHIPS.
so, IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE A NEWCOMER'S CHIP...
you've GOT THREE MINUTES TO SHARE IF YOU WANT IT.
Oh, REALLY?
go AHEAD, MAN. YOU AMONG FRIENDS.
well, I, UH...
what's YOUR NAME?
all: HI, BOB.
Hi.
and I'M, UM...
an ADDICT.
I USE...HEROIN
shoot IT.
it's AFFECTING MY JOB.
my BOSS FOUND MY WORKS. HE FIRED MY ASS.
but I SHOWED HIM
I SPENT EVERY PENNY OF MY FINAL PAYCHECK ON JUNK.
doctor SAID I...I ALMOST DIED.
coffee SUCKS...
as BAD AS THE DOUGHNUTS.
it's BETTER NEXT DOOR.
come ON.
it IS GOOD COFFEE. THANK YOU.
so, TELL ME...
exactly HOW FULL OF SHIT ARE YOU?
I'm NOT FULL OF ANYTHING.
it WAS A NICE PERFORMANCE IN THERE.
where DID YOU DOWNLOAD IT FROM? Addict. com?
look, I HAVE NO REASON TO LIE.
sure YOU DO.
we ALL DO.
you THOUGHT I WAS LYING?
I DON'T KNOW... BOB.
well, IT IS ANONYMOUS.
everyone IN THAT ROOM
has HEARD OR LIVED FAR WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE.
I DOUBT IT.
Oh, SO YOU'RE SUPER-JUNKIE.
I DON'T MEAN TO IMPLY
that WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HASN'T BEEN DIFFICULT.
but THERE'S NO WAY THAT I COULD KNOW WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED, RIGHT?
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY FEEL THAT NEED.
like A THOUSAND HIDING VOICES WHISPERING, "This is who you are.
and YOU FIGHT THE PRESSURE,
the GROWING NEED RISING LIKE A WAVE,
prickling AND TEASING AND PRODDING TO BE FED.
but THE WHISPERING GETS LOUDER
until IT'S SCREAMING, "NOW!
and IT'S THE ONLY VOICE YOU HEAR...
the ONLY VOICE YOU WANT TO HEAR.
and YOU BELONG TO IT,
to THIS...
shadow SELF.
to THIS...
dark PASSENGER.
Yes.
the DARK PASSENGER.
no.
I'm SORRY, BUT I NEED TO GO.
thanks FOR THE COFFEE.
she KNOWS.
she RECOGNIZES DEMONS...
dark PASSENGERS.
maybe THE OTHERS CAN, TOO.
this PROGRAM IS TOO RISKY, ESPECIALLY NOW.
Rita WILL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
Hey. YOU JUST MISSED STORY TIME.
I WAS AT A MEETING.
thank YOU.
it MADE ME REALIZE SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
Oh, REALLY? WHAT'S THAT?
those MEETINGS ARE NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR ME.
I KNOW HOW THIS SOUNDS, BUT I CAN DO THIS ON MY OWN.
Dexter, YOU NEED A PROGRAM.
I've READ STUDIES -- PEOPLE ARE 10 TIMES AS LIKELY
to CHANGE ON THEIR OWN
as THEY ARE WITH THE HELP OF DOCTORS OR PROGRAMS.
so YOU'RE QUOTING STUDIES?
look, I LIVED THIS.
I WATCHED PAUL TRY AND FAIL WITH WHITE-KNUCKLE SOBRIETY.
I'm NOT PAUL. I'M NOT ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE.
going TO THOSE MEETINGS WILL DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD,
I SWEAR TO YOU.
I'm BETTER OFF ALONE.
I PRAY YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
what JUST HAPPENED?
thought YOU WERE STAYING AT RITA'S.
taking THE NIGHT OFF.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ON THE TREADMILL.
taking THE NIGHT OFF.
with NO MONEY DOWN, GUARANTEED,
or WE'LL MAKE YOUR FIRST TWO PAYMENTS...
Dexter: A NIGHT OFF IS GOOD TO REMEMBER WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
two WOMEN ARE DEAD,
the KILLER IS SELLING MINIVANS,
and I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE IT,
even IF I AM LAYING LOW.
having A VICTIM PREPPED AND READY
will TAKE THE EDGE OFF THE WAIT...
I HOPE.
Hey, HANG ON JUST A SECOND, OKAY?
what's GOING ON, DEX? HEY.
any PROBLEMS, THE SERVICE CENTER CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU,
but THEY'RE AROUND THE CORNER.
actually, THE MINIVAN'S FINE.
well, OF COURSE IT IS. I NEVER SOLD A LEMON IN MY LIFE.
I'm JUST RETHINKING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.
great, I'LL SET YOU UP WITH A WARRANTY WRITER, THEN.
and I'M THINKING ROOF RACK AND PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM.
going ALL OUT. YEAH.
that's GREAT, BUT I'M WITH A CUSTOMER.
and SO ONE OF MY ASSOCIATES
I'd RATHER DEAL WITH YOU.
I'll JUST WAIT FOR YOU IN YOUR OFFICE.
outstanding.
DNA, DNA, COME OUT AND PLAY.
Uh-oh, ROGER'S GOT YOU IN THE BOX.
once YOU'RE IN THE BOX, YOU DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT A DEAL.
don't WORRY. YOU'RE SAFE WITH ROGER.
he's THE BEST.
I'm JUST DROPPING OFF THIS THANK-YOU NOTE.
well, I WAS JUST LEAVING.
he SENT YOU ACROSS THE STREET, DIDN'T HE?
across THE STREET?
it's OKAY, HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE EITHER.
Yeah, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE MAKES A LIVING
sending ALL OF HIS COMMISSIONS TO OTHER DEALERS.
maybe HE HAS ULTERIOR MOTIVES.
or MAYBE HE KNOWS I CAN'T AFFORD HIS PRICE.
after HE RAN A CREDIT CHECK?
trw DOESN'T LIE.
so, YOU'RE SINGLE?
Y-yeah.
makes IT TOUGHER TO AFFORD THOSE BIG-TICKET ITEMS, LIKE CARS AND HOUSES.
you RENT AN APARTMENT?
a HOUSE. I HATE SHARING WALLS. YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING.
tell ME ABOUT IT. NO PETS, THOUGH, RIGHT?
Yeah.
is THIS A COME-ON? 'CAUSE IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
it MUST BE WHY I'M STILL SINGLE.
another BRUNETTE.
single, NEIGHBORS AT A DISTANCE, NO GUARD DOG.
the CREDIT CHECK GETS ROGER ALL THE DETAILS HE NEEDS.
she's NEXT, AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
not UNTIL THIS MANHUNT ENDS.
Harry WOULD INSIST ON IT.
what? NO, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
I KNOW THE CARD IS IN HIS NAME.
I JUST WANT TO CHECK THE CHARGES.
well, THE SUPERVISOR I SPOKE WITH THIS MORNING ALLOWED IT.
yes -- NO, UH... YEAH, I'LL HOLD.
yes?
just A REMINDER
that THE BISCAYNE DRIVE-BY WARRANT NEEDS YOUR APPROVAL.
I'll LOOK AT IT.
and THE HOMICIDE THAT CAME IN LAST NIGHT
still NEEDS TO BE ASSIGNED.
right, THANKS.
look, ESMEE, I KNOW THAT THINGS ARE ROUGH
with YOU AND YOUR FIANC? RIGHT NOW, AND I'M SORRY, REALLY,
but WE NEED TO KEEP CLEARING THAT BOARD OUT THERE.
Yeah, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
I SEEM TO HAVE HAD MY HEAD UP MY ASS LATELY.
it's CALLED "BEING HUMAN.
okay, WHO'S UP?
Samuels AND KENT ARE UP.
put THEM ON THE LIQUOR-STORE SHOOTING.
and WHERE IS THE BISCAYNE WARRANT?
Oh, RIGHT HERE.
Simms AND HOAGIE WANT S. W.A. FOR ENTRY.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD MEASURE, GIVEN THE WEAPONS CHARGE.
excuse ME, I'M -- I'M GONNA NEED A MINUTE.
just...
just GONNA NEED A MINUTE.
please, MARIA.
I'll HANDLE IT.
you're NOT TAKING MY CALLS,
and NOW YOU'RE CHECKING MY CREDIT-CARD CHARGES, ESMEE?
Roger's DNA MATCHES THE SEMEN FOUND AT BOTH CRIME SCENES.
irrefutable.
if I DO NOTHING, ANOTHER WOMAN DIES.
is THAT MY LONG-DORMANT CONSCIENCE TALKING
or THE DARK PASSENGER WHISPERING?
Hi, IT'S ME.
Hi, DEXTER.
kids home from school yet?
Colleen's BRINGING THEM HOME NOW.
I'm A...LITTLE CONFUSED.
I'm SORRY YOU'RE CONFUSED.
I mean, it's pizza night. Should I pick up the usual?
did YOU GO BACK?
to A MEETING -- THINKING ABOUT IT.
the KIDS AND I WILL ORDER IN, THEN.
uh, okay.
so...
...is THIS IT?
that's UP TO YOU, DEXTER.
I WANT TO KNOW,
where IS SHE, MI TERESITA.
she's SO YOUNG -- 7 YEAR OLD.
you HELP ME. I KNOW YOU FIND HER.
we'll DO WHAT WE CAN.
por FAVOR!
don't CRY.
only ENGLISH. ANGEL?
just TELL HER WE'LL CALL HER.
she THINKS YOU CAN FIND THE DAUGHTER.
there ARE NO KIDS DOWN THERE.
tell HER I CAN'T HELP HER.
she
I-I CAN'T HELP YOU.
por FAVOR!
it's BEEN 24 HOURS SINCE I ASKED TO BE REPLACED.
has IT?
what's TAKING SO LONG?
every COP ON THE DAMN FORCE WANTS IN ON THIS CASE.
just TAKE YOUR PICK.
I've BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THAT, ACTUALLY.
everyone WANTS ON, BUT YOU WANT OFF.
I TOLD YOU, I HAVE CASES.
I DON'T THINK SO.
you don't think so.
Jesus, I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ON YOUR TASK FORCE, ALL RIGHT?
Why?
because I'M THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT SHOULD BE ON IT.
you WANT ME TO FIND A SERIAL KILLER?
I WAS ENGAGED TO ONE, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
what KIND OF COP -- WHAT KIND OF
that's WHY I CHOSE YOU, YOU KNOW
because OF WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.
you SURVIVED.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
I CAN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE THE STRENGTH IT TOOK CONTINUES TO TAKE.
more THAN THAT, YOU GOT A FIRSTHAND LOOK INTO THE MIND AND HEART OF A KILLER,
and YOU'RE STILL HERE.
if YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT -- REALLY ACCEPT IT
you COULD USE IT.
mix THAT WITH SOME OF YOUR STRENGTH, AND...
you COULD CATCH SOMEONE EVEN WORSE THAN THE ICE-TRUCK KILLER.
but YOU HAVE TO STOP RUNNING.
finish TODAY'S INTERVIEWS.
then, IF YOU STILL WANT OUT, YOU GOT IT.
lead FUCKING INVESTIGATOR.
translation -- EVERYONE'S BITCH.
I DO HAVE A LIFE, YOU KNOW.
you DO?
just GIVE ME YOUR BONE-MARROW DNA RESULTS.
no MATCHES.
big SURPRISE.
do ME A FAVOR ON YOUR WAY OUT, WILL YOU?
drop THESE DENTAL X-RAYS AT THE FIELD MORGUE FOR ME?
tech SHOULD STILL BE THERE.
fucking BAY HARBOR BUTCHER
is BUTCHERING MY ONLINE SOCIAL LIFE.
sorry.
next.
MATTHEWS: I FIGURED YOU'D STILL BE HERE.
you WERE A PAIN IN THE ASS BUT ALWAYS A DAMN HARD WORKER.
and, OF COURSE, YOU KNEW HOW TO HANDLE THE PRESS.
come HERE A MINUTE.
the PUBLIC NEEDS TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PROTECT THEM,
or ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE, SO I NEED ALL MY PEOPLE OPERATING AT THEIR VERY HIGHEST LEVELS.
I AGREE.
should I BE WORRIED ABOUT PASCAL?
Why?
you CAN CUT THE CRAP, MARIA.
I KNOW SHE'S BEEN AWOL ON PERSONAL MATTERS.
the PRESS FUCKUP IS HUGE,
and NOW I'M BEGINNING TO HEAR RUMORS ABOUT ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.
and YOU'RE ASKING ME BECAUSE...
because YOU'VE DONE THE JOB.
so IF SHE'S OUT, THAT MEANS YOU'RE BACK IN.
that MAKES YOU HER HARSHEST CRITIC, AND I WANT IT STRAIGHT.
so...
take YOUR SHOT, MARIA.
you KNOW WHAT "ERRATIC" MEANS?
it's CODE FOR "NON-MALE,
and IT'S THE SAME BULLSHIT SEXISM I PUT UP WITH WHEN I WAS IN CHARGE.
I WON'T DIGNIFY RUMORS, CAPTAIN. PASCAL'S FINE.
minivan's THAT WAY.
field MORGUE'S THIS WAY.
I'll WAIT.
you SHOULD TAKE THE NIGHT OFF, SERGEANT.
on PIZZA NIGHT?
no WAY.
what DOES THAT GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS SEE N A FREAK SHOW LIKE YOU ANYWAY?
you HAVE TO ASK HER.
maybe I WILL.
what EXACTLY IS IT YOU THINK I'VE DONE?
I KNOW YOU'RE CONNECTED TO THE ICE-TRUCK KILLER.
could YOU BE MORE VAGUE?
I KNOW YOU'RE TOO CAREFUL.
you KEEP YOUR ASSETS IN CASH.
you DON'T BELONG TO ANY ORGANIZATIONS OR ALUMNI GROUPS.
you WERE TOP OF YOUR CLASS IN MED SCHOOL,
but YOU TRADED IT FOR FUCKING BLOOD SPATTER.
I KNOW YOU STUDIED MARTIAL ARTS IN COLLEGE,
but I DON'T KNOW WHAT A LAB GEEK NEEDS WITH ADVANCED JUJITSU.
do YOU KNOW WHAT AN EASY CREDIT IS?
I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD LIAR, TOO.
not GOOD ENOUGH.
Dexter: SERGEANT DOAKES THINKS HE KNOWS MY SECRETS,
but HE ONLY NEEDS TO LOOK AT THIS, MY BODY OF WORK,
to KNOW THE REAL ME.
suit UP IF YOU'RE GONNA TOUCH THEM.
no, I'M JUST, UH... DROPPING OFF SOME X-RAYS.
I'm DEXTER MORGAN.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
right.
looks LIKE THE LAB TECH'S GONE HOME FOR THE NIGHT,
so I'LL JUST...
you HOPING THEY'LL TALK TO YOU?
the ONES WITH HEADS, ANYWAY.
they ALWAYS SPEAK... EVENTUALLY.
just GOT TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION.
which IS?
why WERE THEY CHOSEN?
you LOOKING FOR A PATTERN?
one DOESN'T KILL THIS MANY PEOPLE
in THIS CAREFUL, METHODICAL WAY WITHOUT A REASON
some...
twisted SET OF PRINCIPLES.
Yeah, THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE TWISTED, WOULDN'T THEY?
the WORST KILLERS IN HISTORY ARE USUALLY THE ONES
who THINK THEIR MURDERS WERE SOMEHOW...JUST
even DESERVED.
leaders HAVE SLAUGHTERED WHOLE POPULATIONS
for THE SAME WARPED REASON.
but THERE'S NEVER ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR KILLING.
no.
well, ONE, OF COURSE.
to SAVE AN INNOCENT LIFE.
to SAVE AN INNOCENT LIFE.
how MANY MORE BODIES WOULD THERE BE
had I NOT STOPPED THOSE KILLERS?
I DIDN'T DO IT TO SAVE LIVES...
but SAVE LIVES I DID.
motivation ASIDE,
I THINK HARRY AND LUNDY WOULD AGREE ON THIS ONE.
Dexter: ROGER THE ARTFUL DODGER.
Jesus!
you SCARED ME, BRO.
we HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
Oh, YEAH, RIGHT, THE WARRANTY AND STUFF.
listen, UH... I CAN'T WRITE YOU UP RIGHT NOW.
I GOT THE WIFE WAITING FOR ME.
you're NOT MARRIED.
ex-wife. I GOT TO TAKE THE KIDS.
you DON'T HAVE KIDS. STEPKIDS -- THEY'RE HERS.
Nope.
okay, HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
neither DO I.
you WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE AMPLE CARGO SPACE.
where AM I?
looks DIFFERENT UNDER PLASTIC,
but YOU SPENT AN EVENING HERE...WITH ANN COHEN.
you TOOK HER LAST BREATH FROM HER RIGHT OVER THERE.
you REMEMBER? NO.
you're -- YOU'RE WRONG. I WOULDN'T.
you WOULD AND YOU DID AND YOU WERE ABOUT TO DO IT AGAIN.
that's WHY WE'RE HERE.
no, THIS IS CRAZY.
you GOT THE WRONG GUY. I
I SELL CARS, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
I've NEVER HURT ANYONE IN MY LIFE -- DEFINITELY NOT A WOMAN.
why CAN'T I DO THAT?
do WHAT?
lie LIKE THAT.
I MEAN, I THOUGHT I WAS GOOD, BUT YOU, IT'S...MWAH.
I DON'T LIE.
okay, THAT ONE WAS WEAK.
okay, LOOK, ANY CAR ON THE LOT, IT'S YOURS.
T-BIRD, TOWN CAR, YOU NAME IT -- YOURS FREE.
I'll CALL IT IN RIGHT NOW.
lot's CLOSED.
I'll HAVE THEM OPEN IT UP. I'M THE MANAGER. they do what i say
the MANAGER'S NAME IS RICK BUXTON.
Yeah, BUT I'VE BEEN THERE LONGER THAN HE HAS.
you've BEEN THERE THREE MONTHS. AT THE OTHER LOT.
it's LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE SKI MOGULS.
you JUST HOP FROM ONE LIE TO THE NEXT
no SHAME, NO EMBARRASSMENT.
you JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
that's THE KEY, RIGHT?
not TO CARE ABOUT ANYONE OR ANYTHING.
I CARE.
I CARE A LOT.
no, IT WAS A COMPLIMENT.
I DON'T CARE, EITHER.
Yes, YOU DO.
like ABOUT YOUR WIFE.
not MARRIED.
girlfriend, THEN.
I SAW IT THE MINUTE YOU WALKED ON THE LOT.
what DID YOU SEE? TELL ME.
look, MOST GUYS YOUR AGE, THEY BEELINE...
right FOR THE HORSEPOWER
you KNOW, SOMETHING FLASHY, SEXY.
but YOU
you're THERE ALL ALONE, NO ONE THERE TO NAG YOU,
and YOU DON'T EVEN GLANCE AT THE COUPES.
the ONLY THING YOU LOOK AT IS THE MINIVAN,
like YOU CAN SEE HER IN THE PASSENGER'S SEAT AND THE KIDS IN THE BACK.
leave THE KIDS OUT. SEE?
you're LYING TO YOURSELF IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T CARE.
she's JUST A COMPANION, REALLY.
started THAT WAY, ANYWAY.
someone WHO...
looked GOOD, NORMAL.
they WORM THEIR WAY IN.
Yeah, THEY DO.
then THEY SHUT YOU OUT.
that's WHAT THIS IS ABOUT -- THAT SHE SHUT YOU OUT?
Oh. MAN, OKAY, I GET IT.
I-I -- I'VE BEEN THERE.
but YOU CAN'T LET HER GET TO YOU LIKE THIS, 'CAUSE -- 'CAUSE THEY'RE ALL THE SAME
fucking BITCHES.
you DO EVERYTHING FOR THEM, AND THEN THEY FUCK YOU.
she's NOT WORTH IT, ALL RIGHT?
you're BETTER OFF WITHOUT THAT CUNT.
don't...
...talk THAT WAY ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND.
Dexter: I'M DEXTER, AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT I AM.
all: HI, DEXTER.
I JUST KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING DARK IN ME...
and I HIDE IT.
I CERTAINLY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT...
but IT'S THERE...
always.
this DARK PASSENGER.
and WHEN HE'S DRIVING, I FEEL...
alive...
half SICK WITH THE THRILL OF COMPLETE WRONGNESS.
I DON'T FIGHT HIM.
I DON'T WANT TO.
he's ALL I'VE GOT.
nothing ELSE COULD LOVE ME,
not EVEN...
...ESPECIALLY NOT ME.
or IS THAT JUST A LIE THE DARK PASSENGER TELLS ME?
because LATELY THERE ARE THESE MOMENTS WHEN I FEEL...
...CONNECTED TO SOMETHING ELSE -- SOMEONE.
it's LIKE...
the MASK IS SLIPPING...
...and THINGS...
...PEOPLE...
who NEVER MATTERED BEFORE ARE SUDDENLY STARTING TO MATTER.
it SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.
hello...
man: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR SHARING.
would SOMEONE LEAD US IN THE SERENITY PRAYER?
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.
the SECRETS, THE SNEAKING AROUND
now IT ALL MAKES SENSE.
all: GOD GRANT ME SERENITY TO ACCEPT...
a LOT OF COPS HAVE BEEN WHERE YOU ARE.
the BOOZE, THE DRUGS...
makes THE JOB GO DOWN EASIER.
stay CLEAN AND STAY OUT OF MY WAY, WE WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
Oh, AND YOU OWE ME A NEW MICHELIN, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.
I HAVE ALL YOUR FORMS,
so WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN TO BRING YOUR DAD HOME.
I'm SORRY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T WANT HIM HOME.
just TELL ME HE'S DEAD. WE NEED TO KNOW HE'S GONE.
right, YOU WANT CLOSURE.
I WANT PEACE.
he MADE OUR LIVES A LIVING HELL.
when HE'D GO TO PRISON, IT WAS A BLESSING, BUT, UH...
you KEPT LETTING HIM OUT.
I NEED TO TELL MY MOTHER, MY SISTER
that THEY'RE SAFE AND THAT HE'S ROTTING IN HELL.
call ME WHEN YOU CAN TELL ME THAT.
Lundy, WAIT.
I THINK -- I MEAN, IT COULD BE A COINCIDENCE
but THERE ARE TWO OF THEM.
two...
missing PEOPLE WITH RECORDS -- PRISON RECORDS.
interesting.
and WHO TYPICALLY HAS A PRISON RECORD?
I DON'T KNOW.
bad GUYS?
bad GUYS.
do YOU THINK IT COULD BE A
a PATTERN? MAYBE.
we'll RUN ALL THE VICTIMS' DNA AGAINST THE CRIMINAL DATABASE.
D. C. LAB IS STILL OPEN.
come ON. LET'S GET TO WORK.
Dexter, WHAT?
you WERE RIGHT.
I'm SORRY TO WAKE YOU UP,
but I HAD TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE RIGHT.
about WHAT?
the PROGRAM.
it's...
it's GOOD. IT'S REALLY GOOD.
I... AM ALWAYS SO IN MY HEAD.
but THIS -- IT WAS...
good.
in FACT, IT'S ALREADY HELPED ME A LOT.
thank YOU.
Oh, I DO LOVE THIS CAR.
Yeah, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.
so, I WILL PICK YOU UP IN AN HOUR.
we'll GO SOMEPLACE NICE FOR LUNCH.
Oh, THERE'S MY SPONSOR.
Really? WHERE?
the GUY IN THE BLUE SHIRT?
no, NEXT TO HIM -- LILA.
Bye.
Bye.
I'm BACK.
two treasure hunters made a ghastly discovery today
when they stumbled on what appears to be an underwater graveyard in a crevice off the coast of Miami.
do you know what that means?
means there might be a new mass murderer out there, way worse than the ice-truck killer.
the bay harbor butcher?
that's what the press is calling whoever dumped bodies offshore.
the last thing Miami needs is another serial killer.
13 and counting.
they're so swamped up there, they had to bring in outside talent.
Frank Lundy?
the green river killer, the D.C. Sniper
if the case was impossible, he broke it.
so, this is the man who stands between me and death row.
with your help, we'll find whoever did this awful thing.
so, let's get a jump-start on the bay harbor butcher.
with doakes tag inme, my life's been all jekyll and no hyde.
paul kept insisting to me that you knocked him over the head,
dragged him to his motel, and shot him up with drugs.
I hit paul to protect you and the kids.
look, if there is anything left between us,
you will answer me this one question and you will tell me the truth.
are you an addict?
Yes, I have an addiction.
"an Inconvenient Lie"
my name is Caroline.
I'm an addict.
Hi, Caroline.
um, I started taking pain pills after my back surgery.
I don't need them for the pain anymore.
now I...
now I just need them.
and I need duct tape -- three or four rolls.
running low on heavy-duty trash bags.
when's the last time I sharpened my knives?
and I lost my license.
tears now?
it's very hard to concentrate in here.
how am I supposed to get any work done?
my husband says he's gonna leave me if I don't stay sober.
but I have to do this for myself.
no self-control, lost everything, trying to stop.
same whiny story over and over for...
10 minutes -- feels like 10 hours.
taking lortabs and darvocet and percocet
and anything I could get my hands on.
and even now...
I'd kill for a vicodin.
lightweight.
first I thought, narcotics anonymous, I don't belong here.
you guys are real addicts.
so, how was the meeting?
tell me everything.
it was, uh, interesting, hearing the same story over and over again.
knowing you're not alone. -- Exactly.
did you get fortune cookies?
only the ones with the good fortunes.
so, did you share or just listen?
I just wanted to take it all in my first time out.
think they forgot...
Ah, here they are. Spring rolls.
and what about a sponsor? Did you find one?
I didn't want to rush into anything.
it's an important relationship.
Absolutely.
okay, so, let's see your newcomer's chip.
newcomer's chip. Yeah...
you did stay until the end, didn't you?
of course I did.
right to the end.
you're a terrible liar.
I know too much about 12-step programs to be easily conned, Dexter.
I didn't stay till the end end, if that's what you mean.
I had some important errands to run.
important? What?
am I important? Are the kids?
Yeah.
Yes, of course.
well, you're just gonna have to figure out how important,
because if you don't work the program -- and I mean really work it
I just... I can't go through this again.
all right, kids. Dinner.
how important are they?
I'm sure someone with a heart could answer that question.
tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.
I'll stay.
okay.
okay? -- Okay.
hold the elevator!
Thanks.
nice dodge last night, flooring it through that yellow light.
were you behind me?
see you tonight.
we will get to all of you.
okay, take their names and keep them out of the bullpen till we figure this out.
she disappeared four years ago.
who are they?
every family member of every missing person for the last decade.
including some sad, lonely, and presumably single women,
courtesy of lieutenant pascal.
it's not her fault. That reporter's an asshole.
sergeant?
Yeah, hold the rest of them downstairs. We're out of room here.
you seen Pascal?
you know, Pascal is just caught in a cycle of reaction.
she's not co-creating her own reality.
you know those words don't actually mean anything, right?
look around you, bro.
she's manifesting negativity.
it's on again.
excuse me, lieutenant?
no comment.
we have reports there were dozens of bodies found in that underwater grave site.
not dozens.
the boss's sweater melons look bigger on TV.
the operative word is boss.
show some respect.
I thought I was.
one dozen? Two dozen?
18 or so.
have the families been notified?
we're still trying to identify them.
if viewers have information, they should contact you?
Yes. Fine.
so, there you have it.
police are seeking any leads that can help them identify the 18 faceless victims of the bay harbor butcher.
if you have any information, please contact...
pascal is definitely off her game.
word is, her fianc? Is catching some strange on the sly.
that'd do it.
the shit stops here. Give it to me.
most of these people won't find answers here.
chances are good their loved ones weren't among my chosen few.
may I have your attention, please?
first of all, I want to tell you what a great job you've all been doing on this horrific case.
and with the help of the best man hunter in the FBI, we should have answers soon.
in the meantime, the daily work of this precinct must continue to serve the public,
so we'll be dividing up our resources.
agent Lundy has requested the following officers for his joint task force.
officer cook...
Lundy made me LFI.
lead forensics investigator.
sorry you got boned, but, hey, no blood spatter.
sucks to be me.
actually, it keeps me off Lundy's radar.
sergeant Lee.
detective Ramos...
officer Panko...
detective batista... -- yes!
I saw this happening.
and officer Debra Morgan.
those called will report directly to special agent Lundy.
and let's not forget this is on all of us, folks.
let's keep our eyes and our ears open.
the ice-truck killer was an amateur compared to this guy.
I'd also appreciate it if your lieutenant would consult with me before speaking to the press.
I'll rip her a new one...
if I can find her.
prints, fiber, trace evidence
no, they won't find anything.
I followed all of Harry's painstaking preventative measures.
he knew that nothing stays buried forever.
his code will protect me.
still, I wish my own sister weren't hunting me -- makes for an awkward family dynamic.
so, I'm a fed.
my suit proves it.
the other suits here are feds.
but suit or...
ugly Hawaiian shirt
no offense -- we're a team.
and our first play is I.D.ing those bodies.
once we know who they are, we'll fill in every detail of their lives,
and, uh, get used to food references 'cause, well, I like food.
Vince masuka and his team are gathering DNA, prints, and dental records.
the rest of us are going to cull through cold cases and missing-persons files.
also, I want that crowd out there interviewed
though most of them will be a waste of time.
negative thinking.
you four, move them out as quickly as you can, but be thorough.
if we get even one hit, it'll be worth it.
everyone else, work the files.
remember, I.D.s will lead to a pattern, which will lead to our man.
when the manhunt is on, the hunted go shopping.
not for a new car
for my next project.
I won't act on it... Yet.
I'm still laying low.
Harry would insist on that.
just getting the research out of the way.
someone talked his way into the homes of two women and didn't leave till they were dead.
Ann Cohen and, a month before her, Lynn Hall.
a certain car dealership ran credit checks on both women.
both bought cars elsewhere, so nobody thought about it twice.
but who requested those credit checks?
all I need is some DNA proof
cup of coffee should do the trick.
how many kids you got?
enough.
I hear you.
when my two came along, it was bye-bye, convertible.
of course...
they're worth it.
must take after their mom.
that they do. Thank god.
I tell you, I miss my convertible, but, uh, truth
my minivan's got a much nicer ride.
so you own one.
Oh, the same one you're looking at.
I mean, I know -- whipped, right?
but, uh, my kids love the twin DVDs.
they're just crazy about spongebob, you know what I mean?
actually, I do.
my wife loves the nav system and all the safety features.
and when they're happy...
you're happy. -- That's right.
except the kids don't exist, neither does the wife.
and he owns a beemer, not a minivan.
still, he's seamless.
impressive.
it's not flashy, but...
what did flash ever get me? It got me pulled over, that's what.
I'm definitely not into flash.
you got to sit in the captain's chair, though.
it's like a 747, man.
manuel, hold up.
thank you, sir. So, uh...
we should take it out. Check out the ride.
I'm just doing research.
okay, you don't want a big sales pitch. I get that.
let me at least pull the specs for you.
because, truthfully, we have a hard time keeping these on the lot.
you might want to grab the test-drive while it's still here.
I think I have all the information I need to make a decision.
yeah? Well, then, you've seen the, uh,
the Stow'n Go seating system, right?
I have had everything in here
from a soccer team to a freakin' deer carcass.
it was an accident, of course.
but, uh, I sure was glad for the ample cargo space, not to mention the tinted windows.
I can see how that might come in handy.
I'll just grab the keys.
I go to stalk a killer and I end up with a new car?
how'd that happen? -- New car?
Yeah.
you get married?
not that I know of.
so what's with the mommy mobile?
I'm, uh...
not sure.
synthetic.
even Roger's hair is a lie.
I could learn a thing or two from this guy.
who's your daddy?
dude, the lead forensics investigator of the joint task force -- that's who.
Oh, okay.
so, you want in on this bitch or not?
what bitch?
the only bitch in town, baby.
the bay harbor butcher.
I got you temporarily assigned.
Vince, you didn't have to do that.
nothing sexy, of course, just some bone-marrow collection for DNA I.D.S.
but it'll get you in the tent.
and you got to see the tent. Amazing.
say it.
you're my daddy.
it sounds weird when you say it.
I haven't been much use since he disappeared.
I know I'm supposed to move on, but...
here's the picture of him.
he looks...
nice.
not according to my mother...
or the police.
he was in and out of jail, but my heart raced whenever I saw him.
I brought his toothbrush.
they say you can get DNA off it.
you can find him with this, right?
special agent Lundy?
look, thanks for choosing me for the task force and all,
but I'd appreciate you finding someone else.
you want off?
just as soon as you can replace me, sir.
this is a chance to solve a pretty important case.
most people get into this line of work to do just that.
well, I've got cases of my own backing up,
and the precinct's shorthanded with all this shit.
so, if you don't mind...
I'll see what I can do.
in the meantime, if you could continue the interviews...
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
thank you.
most of them have been underwater for years.
but some, it's awesome, you can't even tell.
the temperature on the ocean floor and the airtight bags kept them intact.
I mean, a little gelatinous residue, sure. But...
I'd rather remember my old playmates as they were
neat, clean little packages.
you know, Vince, I appreciate you doing me this favor but
actually, you're doing me the favor.
I need your help, buddy.
the pressure's fucking ridonkulous.
glad to be of service.
field morgue for the overflow, but it's state-of-the-art.
fucking FBI, eh?
a good percentage are just bones.
must have fed the fish when the bags tore.
Humpty fucking dumpty, right?
exactly.
they weren't meant to be put together again.
they were meant to remain in the silent shadows, keeping their secrets.
now they're exposed to the glare, reflecting my darkness like some grotesque carnival mirror.
Harry was right -- nothing stays buried.
perhaps not even me.
looking for my taurus, sergeant?
keep looking.
you don't need to know where I'm going tonight.
and genius me, not only do I leave my works in my girlfriend's car,
but also all the dead fish from the fishing trip, right?
then I collapse in her parents' house, scare her kids,
and get myself fired, because guess what -- we work together.
Yeah.
so, now, well, I'm 20-days sober...
again...
hoping to make it to 21.
Thanks, Gordon.
this meeting recognizes lengths of sobriety with chips.
so, if there's anyone who would like a newcomer's chip...
you've got three minutes to share if you want it.
Oh, really?
go ahead, man. You among friends.
well, I,uh...
what's your name?
Hi, Bob. -- Hi.
and I'm, um...
an addict.
I use...
heroin -- shoot it.
it's affecting my job.
my boss found my works. He fired my ass.
but I showed him -- I spent every penny of my final paycheck on junk.
doctor said I...
I almost died.
coffee sucks...
as bad as the doughnuts.
it's better next door. Come on.
it is good coffee. Thank you.
so, tell me...
exactly how full of shit are you?
I'm not full of anything.
it was a nice performance in there.
where did you download it from? addict.com?
look, I have no reason to lie.
sure you do.
we all do.
you thought I was lying?
I don't know... Bob.
well, it is anonymous.
everyone in that room has heard or lived far worse than anything you've ever done.
I doubt it.
Oh, so you're super-junkie.
I don't mean to imply that what you've been through hasn't been difficult.
but there's no way that I could know what you've experienced, right?
I couldn't possibly feel that need.
like a thousand hiding voices whispering,
this is who you are.
and you fight the pressure,
the growing need rising like a wave,
prickling and teasing and prodding to be fed.
but the whispering gets louder until it's screaming, now!
and it's the only voice you hear...
the only voice you want to hear.
and you belong to it, to this...
shadow self.
to this...
dark passenger.
Yes.
the dark passenger.
no.
I'm sorry, but I need to go.
thanks for the coffee.
she knows.
she recognizes demons... Dark passengers.
maybe the others can, too.
this program is too risky, especially now.
Rita will have to understand.
Hey.
you just missed story time.
I was at a meeting.
thank you.
it made me realize something important.
Oh, really? What's that?
those meetings are not a good place for me.
I know how this sounds, but I can do this on my own.
Dexter, you need a program.
I've read studies
people are 10 times as likely to change on their own as they are with the help of doctors or programs.
so you're quoting studies?
look, I lived this.
I watched Paul try and fail with white-knuckle sobriety.
I'm not Paul.
I'm not any of those people.
going to those meetings will do more harm than good, I swear to you.
I'm better off alone.
I pray you change your mind.
what just happened?
thought you were staying at Rita's.
taking the night off.
I thought you'd be on the treadmill.
taking the night off.
with no money down, guaranteed, or we'll make your first two payments...
a night off is good to remember what's important.
two women are dead, the killer is selling minivans,
and I have an opportunity to prove it, even if I am laying low.
having a victim prepped and ready will take the edge off the wait...
I hope.
Hey, hang on just a second, okay?
what's going on, Dex? -- Hey.
any problems, the service center can take care of you, but they're around the corner.
actually, the minivan's fine.
well, of course it is. I never sold a lemon in my life.
I'm just rethinking the extended warranty.
great, I'll set you up with a warranty writer, then.
and I'm thinking roof rack and premium sound system.
going all out. -- Yeah.
that's great, but I'm with a customer.
and so one of my associates -- I'd rather deal with you.
I'll just wait for you in your office. -- Outstanding.
DNA, DNA, come out and play.
Uh-oh, Roger's got you in the box.
once you're in the box, you don't leave without a deal.
don't worry. You're safe with roger.
he's the best.
I'm just dropping off this thank-you note.
well, I was just leaving.
he sent you across the street, didn't he?
across the street?
it's okay, he told me not to tell anyone either.
Yeah, I don't know how he makes a living sending all of his commissions to other dealers.
maybe he has ulterior motives.
or maybe he knows I can't afford his price.
after he ran a credit check?
trw doesn't lie.
so, you're single?
y -- yeah.
makes it tougher to afford those big-ticket items, like cars and houses.
you rent an apartment? -- A house.
I hate sharing walls. You can hear everything.
tell me about it. No pets, though, right?
Yeah. Is this a come-on?
because it's a little weird.
it must be why I'm still single.
another brunette.
single, neighbors at a distance, no guard dog.
the credit check gets Roger all the details he needs.
she's next, and I can't do anything about it
not until this manhunt ends.
Harry would insist on it.
what?
no, I'll take care of it.
I know the card is in his name.
I just want to check the charges.
well, the supervisor I spoke with this morning allowed it.
yes -- no, uh...
Yeah, I'll hold. Yes?
just a reminder that the Biscayne drive-by warrant needs your approval.
I'll look at it.
and the homicide that came in last night still needs to be assigned.
right, thanks.
I know that things are rough with you and your fianc? Right now,
and I'm sorry, really, but we need to keep clearing that board out there.
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.
I seem to have had my head up my ass lately.
it's called being human.
okay, who's up?
Samuels and Kent are up.
put them on the liquor-store shooting.
and where is the biscayne warrant?
Oh, right here.
Simms and hoagie want S.W.A.T. for entry.
I think it's a good measure, given the weapons charge.
excuse me, I'm -- I'm gonna need a minute. Just...
just gonna need a minute.
Esmee? -- Please, Maria.
I'll handle it.
you're not taking my calls, and now you're checking my credit-card charges, Esmee?
Roger's DNA matches the semen found at both crime scenes.
irrefutable.
if I do nothing, another woman dies.
is that my long-dormant conscience talking
or the dark passenger whispering?
Hi, it's me.
Hi, Dexter.
kids home from school yet?
Colleen's bringing them home now.
I'm a...
little confused.
I'm sorry you're confused.
I mean, it's pizza night. Should I pick up the usual?
did you go back?
to a meeting -- thinking about it.
the kids and I will order in, then.
uh, okay.
so...
is this it?
that's up to you, Dexter.
I want to know, where is she.
she's so young -- 7 year old.
you help me.
I know you find her.
we'll do what we can.
don't cry.
no Spanish.
only English. Angel?
just tell her we'll call her.
she thinks you can find the daughter.
there are no kids down there.
tell her I can't help her.
she -- I -- I can't help you.
it's been 24 hours since I asked to be replaced.
has it?
what's taking so long?
every cop on the damn force wants in on this case.
just take your pick.
I've been wondering about that, actually.
everyone wants on, but you want off.
I told you, I have cases.
I don't think so. -- You don't think so.
Jesus, I just don't want to be on your task force, all right?
Why?
because I'm the last person in the world that should be on it.
you want me to find a serial killer?
I was engaged to one, for Christ's sake.
what kind of cop -- what kind of
that's why I chose you, you know
because of what you went through.
you survived.
I don't know how.
I can't begin to imagine the strength it took -- continues to take.
more than that,
you got a firsthand look into the mind and heart of a killer,
and you're still here.
if you can accept that -- really accept it
you could use it.
mix that with some of your strength, and...
you could catch someone even worse than the ice-truck killer.
but you have to stop running.
finish today's interviews.
then, if you still want out, you got it.
lead fucking investigator.
translation -- everyone's bitch.
I do have a life, you know.
you do?
just give me your bone-marrow DNA results.
no matches.
big surprise.
do me a favor on your way out, will you?
drop these dental X-rays at the field morgue for me?
tech should still be there.
fucking bay harbor butcher is butchering my online social life.
sorry.
next.
I figured you'd still be here.
you were a pain in the ass but always a damn hard worker.
and, of course, you knew how to handle the press.
come here a minute.
the public needs to believe that we can protect them, or all hell breaks loose,
so I need all my people operating at their very highest levels.
I agree.
should I be worried about Pascal?
Pascal? Why?
you can cut the crap, Maria.
I know she's been AWOL on personal matters.
the press fuckup is huge,
and now I'm beginning to hear rumors about erratic behavior.
and you're asking me because...
because you've done the job.
so if she's out, that means you're back in.
that makes you her harshest critic, and I want it straight.
so...
take your shot, Maria.
you know what erratic means?
it's code for non-male,
and it's the same bullshit sexism I put up with when I was in charge.
I won't dignify rumors, captain.
pascal's fine.
minivan's that way.
field morgue's this way.
I'll wait.
you should take the night off, sergeant.
on pizza night? No way.
what does that girlfriend of yours see in a freak show like you anyway?
you have to ask her.
maybe I will.
what exactly is it you think I've done?
I know you're connected to the ice-truck killer.
could you be more vague?
I know you're too careful.
you keep your assets in cash.
you don't belong to any organizations or alumni groups.
you were top of your class in med school,
but you traded it for fucking blood spatter.
I know you studied martial arts in college,
but I don't know what a lab geek needs with advanced jujitsu.
do you know what an easy credit is?
I know you're a good liar, too.
not good enough.
sergeant doakes thinks he knows my secrets,
but he only needs to look at this, my body of work, to know the real me.
suit up if you're gonna touch them.
no, I'm just, uh...
dropping off some X-rays.
I'm Dexter Morgan.
I know who you are.
right.
looks like the lab tech's gone home for the night, so I'll just...
you hoping they'll talk to you?
the ones with heads, anyway.
they always speak... Eventually.
just got to ask the right question.
which is?
why were they chosen?
you looking for a pattern?
one doesn't kill this many people in this careful, methodical way without a reason
some... Twisted set of principles.
Yeah, they would have to be twisted, wouldn't they?
the worst killers in history are usually the ones who think their murders were somehow... Just -- even deserved.
leaders have slaughtered whole populations for the same warped reason.
but there's never any justification for killing.
no.
well, one, of course.
to save an innocent life.
to save an innocent life.
how many more bodies would there be had I not stopped those killers?
Dndi't do it to save lives...
but save lives I did.
motivation aside, I think Harry and Lundy would agree on this one.
Roger the artful dodger. -- Jesus!
you scared me, bro.
we have some unfinished business.
Oh, yeah, right, the warranty and stuff. Listen, uh...
I can't write you up right now.
I got the wife waiting for me.
you're not married.
ex-wife. I got to take the kids.
you don't have kids.
stepkids -- they're hers. -- Nope.
okay, how about this one?
I don't give a shit.
neither do I.
you were right about the ample cargo space.
where am I?
looks different under plastic, but you spent an evening here...
with Ann Cohen.
you took her last breath from her right over there.
you remember? -- No.
you're -- you're wrong. I wouldn't.
you would and you did and you were about to do it again.
that's why we're here.
no, this is crazy.
you got the wrong guy.
I -- I sell cars, for god's sake.
I've never hurt anyone in my life -- definitely not a woman.
why can't I do that?
do what?
lie like that.
I mean, I thought I was good, but you, it's...
I don't lie.
okay, that one was weak.
okay, look, any car on the lot, it's yours.
T-bird, town car, you name it -- yours free.
I'll call it in right now.
lot's closed.
I'll have them open it up. I'm the manager.
the manager's name is Rick Buxton.
Yeah, but I've been there longer than he has.
you've been there three months.
at the other lot.
it's like watching someone ski moguls.
you just hop from one lie to the next
no shame, no embarrassment.
you just don't give a shit.
that's the key, right? Not to care about anyone or anything.
I care.
I care a lot.
no, it was a compliment.
I don't care, either. -- Yes, you do.
like about your wife.
not married.
girlfriend, then.
I saw it the minute you walked on the lot.
what did you see? Tell me.
look, most guys your age, they beeline...
right for the horsepower -- you know, something flashy, sexy.
but you -- you're there all alone,
no one there to nag you, and you don't even glance at the coupes.
the only thing you look at is the minivan,
like you can see her in the passenger's seat and the kids in the back.
leave the kids out. -- See?
you're lying to yourself if you think you don't care.
she's just a companion, really.
started that way, anyway.
someone who.
looked good, normal.
they worm their way in.
Yeah, they do.
then they shut you out.
that's what this is about -- That she shut you out?
man, okay, I get it. I -- I -- I've been there.
but you can't let her get to you like this, because
because they're all the same -- fucking bitches.
you do everything for them, and then they fuck you.
she's not worth it, all right? You're better off without that cunt.
don't...
talk that way about my girlfriend.
I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.
Hi, Dexter.
I just know there's something dark in me...
and I hide it.
I certainly don't talk about it...
but it's there... Always.
this dark passenger.
and when he's driving, I feel...
alive...
half sick with the thrill of complete wrongness.
I don't fight him.
I don't want to.
he's all I've got.
nothing else could love me, not even...
especially not me.
or is that just a lie the dark passenger tells me?
because lately there are these moments when I feel...
connected to something else -- someone.
it's like...
the mask is slipping...
and things...
people...
who never mattered before are suddenly starting to matter.
it scares the hell out of me.
hello... Dexter.
that's all the time we have for sharing.
would someone lead us in the serenity prayer?
I knew there was something wrong with you.
the secrets, the sneaking around
now it all makes sense.
a lot of cops have been where you are.
the booze, the drugs...
makes the job go down easier.
stay clean and stay out of my way, we won't have a problem.
Oh, and you owe me a new michelin, you motherfucker.
I have all your forms, so we'll do what we can to bring your dad home.
I'm sorry. You don't understand.
I don't want him home.
just tell me he's dead. We need to know he's gone.
right, you want closure.
I want peace.
he made our lives a living hell.
when he'd go to prison, it was a blessing, but, uh...
you kept letting him out.
I need to tell my mother, my sister that they're safe and that he's rotting in hell.
call me when you can tell me that.
Lundy, wait.
I think -- I mean, it could be a coincidence
but there are two of them.
two...
missing people with records -- prison records.
interesting.
and who typically has a prison record?
I don't know.
bad guys?
bad guys.
do you think it could be a -- a pattern?
maybe.
we'll run all the victims' DNA against the criminal database.
d.c. lab is still open.
come on. Let's get to work.
Dexter, what?
you were right.
I'm sorry to wake you up, but I had to let you know that you were right.
about what?
the program.
it's...
it's good. It's really good.
I... am always so in my head.
but this -- it was... Good.
in fact, it's already helped me a lot. Thank you.
Oh, I do love this car.
Yeah, I thought you might.
so, I will pick you up in an hour.
we'll go someplace nice for lunch.
Oh, there's my sponsor. -- Really? Where?
the guy in the blue shirt?
no, next to him -- Lila.
Bye. -- Bye.
I'm back.
what's this big break in the bay harbor butcher case I keep hearing about?
Masuka found microscopic algae Inside the garbage bags with the body.
it's all about the rocks, baby.
the rocks?
Yeah, the algae we found on the rocks.
the bay harbor butcher used them to weigh his bags down.
we're assuming he picked them up where he docks his boat.
26940.0
Laura Moser and three others found chopped up with a chain saw.
apparently a drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.
what is in that report that harry didn't want me to see?!
you were left there for days,
starving, in blood two inches thick.
Dexter, this is my mother. -- Gail.
he's hiding something. I'm sure of it.
did you kill your wife?
Yeah. -- Don't make me do it, Curtis!
Debra, actually.
I'm Gabriel.
Oh, you're into the kinky stuff, huh?
no, the last guy i had sex with tried to kill me.
Oh, there's my sponsor.
Really? Where?
Dexter, meet Dexter.
I'm gonna help the two of you get to know each other.
you're going to tell me all your deepest, darkest secrets.
but the person who did this...
is a person just like me... Like you.
we're all good, Dexter, and we're all evil.
this woman sees me.
she doesn't know it,
but she's looking behind the mask, And she's not turning away.
"the Dark Defender"
uh, here's your cappuccino and scone, ma'am.
can I help the next person, please?
most people hate long lines.
Hi. Can I have a coffee and a danish?
the bank, grocery store,
coffee bar.
not me.
buddy, you mind?
want a real glimpse of human nature?
stand in the way of someone's mocha latte.
got a next of kin we can notify?
uh, Denny was, like, a loner -- Who's that?
the dark defender.
Denny had this great idea to put a spin on that vigilante serial killer we got running around.
definitely has a nicer ring to it than the bay harbor butcher.
I'm conducting an interview here, Morgan.
Denny was trying to set up the dark defender as a graphic novel.
stalker of the night, his blade of vengeance turns wrong into right.
I need some air.
thanks a lot.
the dark defender.
no, Miami's too hot for all that leather.
the first time I got high, I was 15.
no, that's not right. I was 14.
no, wait.
I was definitely 15 because it was my freshman year.
I remember now because I was dating susie mitchell.
we broke up because I called her by her sister, Sharon's, name once.
she hated when people did that.
what she didn't know was that I had a thing for sharon.
Sharon didn't want anything to do with me, so...
don't you hurt my baby!
don't you dare!
don't look. Close your eyes.
mommy loves you.
don't you hurt my baby!
it's okay, mom.
you're safe.
that's hot.
where did you drift off to, anyway?
I was having this bizarre dream about my mother.
say no more.
oedipus complex -- explains a lot.
so, what were you doing to your mother in this dream?
saving her life.
she was murdered...
when I was a boy.
I was there. I saw it happen.
I've never told anyone that before.
come on.
have you thought maybe you weren't saving your mother in this dream?
maybe you were saving yourself.
that's not what happened.
don't be so sure.
when I got clean,
all the seriously fucked-up reasons I used in the first place began to surface.
this could be where your addiction started.
I hope whoever did it got the bloody chair.
there were three men.
I don't know what happened to them.
Dexter, if these guys are behind bars,
you need to confront them.
if they're dead, hell, go piss on their graves,
but you need to do whatever it takes
so you can get closure.
how else do you expect to get better?
I never expected to get better.
my meth lab's in the sock drawer.
this looks bad, doesn't it? -- Yeah.
the cute panties help.
would you believe i'm trying to get to know you better?
by rifling through my stuff?
I'm retarded.
and you've been so great.
you know how I told you the last guy I had sex with tried to kill me?
well, that was kind of true.
he was the ice-truck killer.
who is he?
not fucking funny.
come on, Deb. I never heard of him before. -- Stop it. Don't screw with me.
Deb, I've been in el salvador visiting family for six months.
I just got back.
you sound like every other jackass out there who thinks...
I'm a trophy fuck.
you had no idea who I was when you hit on me at the gym?
when I hit on you at the gym,
it was because I thought you were hot.
good answer.
so, what's hot about me?
it's in the corner! -- Don't hurt it!
Oh, god, Dexter, be careful.
use a broom. It might have rabies.
Oh, it's right there! Get it!
watch it!
careful.
all right! -- He got it!
my hero.
all right, kids. Show's over.
come on. Let's get dressed for school.
so, any armadillos in Michigan?
no.
we didn't used to have any in Florida.
now it's like an invasion. "Armadillos attack! "
you think you're charming, don't you?
I'm sure that probably works for you most of the time.
it did for paul.
I know what you are.
confused?
I found these in a drawer.
tell me, Dexter,
why would Rita print out narcotics anonymous literature if Paul's dead?
because recently I entered the program.
I knew it.
I would never hurt Rita like Paul did.
because I'm not gonna give you that chance.
it's just a matter of time before you pull her under just like he did.
have you discussed any of this with Rita?
no, but I will if you don't do the right thing here.
if you truly care about this family like you say you do,
you will let my daughter and those sweet children go.
the algae on the rocks was exposed to both zinc and lead.
there are only three marinas near bay harbor Which have restricted water flow
that would account for such high levels Of these specific pollutants
turkey creek, sunset keys, and coral cove.
anyone familiar with these marinas?
coral cove is where my dad kept our family boat.
my brother uses the slip now.
I'll bet half the force has boats out there.
it's one of the few marinas left that's affordable on a cop's salary.
morgan and I will take that one.
Sodoquist and Lee, Turkey creek is yours. And, Hill and Ramos, you've got sunset keys.
the rest of you will stay here with detective Batista.
when the team reports in, relay the information back to me.
if our killer's boat is out there, let's find it.
sorry it took so long.
couldn't seem to find any other crime scene files.
probably lost in storage somewhere.
anyway, that's what I was able to dig up.
just one file?
there were three men arrested for those murders.
well, one's deceased, one's doing life without possibility,
and that's the only one that's still an open case -- Santos Jiminez.
Why's it an open case?
Jiminez turned state's evidence, went into witness protection.
there's a business address in there for him.
I guess after 34 years, he figures all the people who want him dead are long gone.
he figured wrong.
if you can't find what you need, there's audio tapes cross-referenced with this file.
tapes? -- Yeah, see that notation?
there was a criminal informant working a cocaine bust from the inside.
I'll take this, too. -- Okay.
Harry always said, "never make things personal"
clouds your judgement.
but I've been living in a fog way too long.
today is friday, september 28, 1973.
this is detective Harry Morgan.
dad. -- Case file
I can't fucking do this anymore!
I have to know when the next shipment's coming in, Laura.
Laura Moser -- my mother.
I can't take this anymore.
Harry, I'm so scared.
everything's going to be okay. You just need to calm down.
I already took the cocaine as evidence, Just like you asked
why isn't that enough?
if we want Estrada and his men behind bars,
we have to catch them in the act at the shipyard.
he's gonna find out, and then he's gonna kill me.
Harry, listen to me.
I think someone may have followed us to the park.
if we were followed, I would have noticed.
I just need you to hold out a little longer.
this will all be over soon.
I need to pick up Brian at school.
I won't let anything happen to you... or your boys.
you have my word.
Harry broke his word.
he wasn't called to that crime scene by chance.
it was his case.
Laura moser was his informant.
Harry knew my mother.
our suspect is 6'2," 380 pounds, Hispanic,
drives a 1971 Ford pickup.
circulate his DMV photo.
Hey. -- Hey.
I've got good news. -- Me too.
turns out our victim, Foster -- he had a blog.
he was in some online geek flame war with a guy calling himself "corndude."
the D.A. finally signed off on your review.
there won't be any charges.
this corndude's real name is Benjamin Alvaro.
anyone from the shoot roll-out team talk to you about counseling?
why the fuck would I need counseling?
because you shot a man last week, James.
that's two shootings in less than six months.
come on, it's got to take its toll.
I'm fine, but thanks anyway.
the sushi place next door has a security camera that covers the parking lot.
you know, department's chaplain's got a good ear.
Maria, can we stay on the goddamn point?
the camera caught the license plate of a green-and-white pickup.
it belongs to Alvaro.
timecode puts him here after the shop closed.
so send some unis to stake out Alvaro's house,
and you and I will take where he works.
no, it's okay. I've got Simms and Giles on it.
I got backup. -- Come on!
it will be like old times.
Nina, I just got a call from my attorney.
we need to talk about this visitation bullshit.
can you just try Dexter's office again?
miss, he's not picking up.
call me when you get this.
excuse me. Are you a friend of Dexter's?
I'm, uh, his decorator. Love the hat.
Terrence, uh, give her a visitor's badge.
I'll -- I'll take her up.
angel Batista. I'm Dexter's best friend.
nice to meet you... Angel Batista.
my work requires me to be an expert in analyzing patterns.
now a pattern keeps emerging from my past that's all too familiar
Harry lying to me.
no wonder he destroyed the file on my mother's death.
it wasn't to protect me. It was to bury his own guilt.
look who I found.
listen, when you're done with him,
maybe you can come over to my place.
it's a mess. Needs a woman's touch. Yeah?
what did you say to angel?
Dexter, these are amazing!
Lila, you can't be in here.
did you find out what happened to the men responsible for your mother's murder?
dead or in prison -- except for one.
he cut a deal. Now he lives in Naples, Florida.
he runs a Tavern.
and what are you gonna do about it?
not sure yet.
and you're not the least bit pissed off that this man got away with murder?
no.
you sure?
maybe a little.
then go and tell him.
healing is all about focusing your rage on the person that's hurt you.
Naples is, what...
two hours away?
we could go tonight.
okay.
pick me up after work? -- All right.
can I have one of these? -- Sure.
what is this stuff?
it's corn syrup and dye. It's my own recipe.
Mmm. Not bad.
thank you.
Oh, god!
who doesn't fix something like that?
you all right? -- Yeah
so, I'm thinking we're assuming our killer owns a boat, But what if he
how do you stand this Miami heat?
makes my toes swell up.
Oh, so, anyway,
I was thinking, what if the killer's been renting a boat?
I can cross-reference some names of
you like cucumber sandwiches, officer Morgan?
I -- I don't know.
anyway, uh, we have some of the dates of when the victims went missing.
it's all about the cream cheese.
so we could cross-reference those dates against the rental logs,
and maybe the same names will pop up.
did you hear anything I just said?
not one word.
it's 1: 00.
I always stop and eat lunch at 1: 00. You'll learn that about me.
why don't you sit down?
you're welcome to consider it an order if that helps.
the shoes, too.
shouldn't we be
I don't know -- investigating the area?
you're very fidgety.
anyone ever tell you that?
Yes. My father.
you applying for the job?
just an observation.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
are you criticizing me for wanting to do my job? -- Yes.
it's 1: 00.
look, the last time I was around boats,
a killer was kidnapping me,
which might explain why I'm living with my brother
and snooping on my new boyfriend.
so forgive me for being a little fidgety,
but if it's lunch we're talking, I'm gonna eat a fat pork sandwich,
and I'm sure as shit not gonna eat it here.
Debra. -- What?!
this isn't a commercial marina.
I haven't seen a single rental I.D. on any of these hulls.
but I can see the upkeep on this place is dismal.
unsecure perimeter, poor lighting.
come out here at night,
no one would know what the hell you're doing.
that's why I'm going to order 24-hour surveillance on this marina and the two others.
as soon as I finish my lunch.
I finished my spatter report, put in for a personal day,
left word with rita.
Naples, here I come.
I can't really focus my rage on the man who killed my mother,
not with Lila along for the ride.
but I can prepare for the day when I do.
where are you off to so early?
um, getting out of town for the night.
don't wait up for me.
in the middle of the week?
thought I'd, you know, take the minivan out on the open road.
who are you?
good news is you got the place to yourself if you want to tie up Gabriel again.
Yeah, that one never fucking gets old.
call me when you get back. I want to talk to you about coral cove.
what about coral cove?
the algae on the rocks sent us there.
if I were you, I would seriously consider moving your boat.
security out there sucks ass.
that's kind of the point.
this little green algae may as well be kryptonite.
if it's ever traced back to me, I'll be helpless.
is this a rental?
Nope, she's all mine.
so your minivan's a she, is she?
your girlfriend must be jealous.
is she cool with you doing this?
I didn't tell her.
Rita's mom found out I'm in recovery.
she wants me to leave rita and the kids.
she could be right.
I can't abandon them.
so, what about what you're gonna say to this guy when you get there?
I'm sure I'll think of something.
why don't you practice on me?
I'd... rather not.
just try.
out loud.
I feel like... you stole my life.
And?
I'm not the person I'm supposed to be.
it's like I'm hollow.
that's good.
go on.
I hide in plain sight... unable to reach out to people... close to me.
I'm afraid...
... I'll hurt them.
like I've hurt so many others.
this is what he made me become.
then that's what you should tell him.
what do you remember most about your mother?
she had long hair.
soft...
... like her hands.
that's all.
Yup... Just like old times.
you live for this and you know it.
we could always get in the car and pass the time like we used to.
no. No.
I'm not going down that road again.
code 1, suspect's vehicle spotted
one on board. Headed your way. -- Copy that.
I'll take lead. -- I got it.
we don't want this guy to do anything stupid in a crowd of people.
goddamn, that's what you out here for -- to babysit me?
I'm out here because I'm worried about you.
how many fucking ways to sunday do I have to tell you that I'm fine, Maria?
Yeah, and that's what worries me.
you're fine with killing two men? You're fine?
been more than two.
this isn't the army, James. This is my department.
I need to know that you are fit for duty. That's my job as a lieutenant!
that's all you care about is your job,
even if it meant doing Pascal's man to get it back.
how did you know about Bertrand?
I didn't for sure until just now.
I know you, Maria. We rode together for two years.
when you want something, you get it.
pascal was in your way.
we're not talking about this.
you all up in everybody else's shit as long as it ain't yours.
there's Alvaro.
wait until he gets out of the car.
how long you gonna keep wiping my ass?
until I see my old partner again.
on my go.
on the ground, motherfucker! -- Hands where I can see, Alvaro!
remember, this is about you.
not about him.
it's all right if we get there and you can't go through with this.
I know.
because we can come back another time. -- No.
I want to meet him tonight.
this isn't art. This is cottage porn.
that's Rita.
say no more. I need to take a shower anyway.
don't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi. -- Hey.
it's so good to hear your voice. I was starting to get worried.
you still on the road?
no, I just got in.
Oh. Well, you said you'd call.
where are you?
I decided to look up someone from my past.
that's what suddenly came up? -- Yep.
Dexter, what's going on?
well, after this morning,
I figured it'd be better if I kept my distance.
what -- what happened this morning?
let's just say your mom isn't a big fan of men in recovery.
Oh, shit.
look, this means nothing, okay?
I'm gonna take care of this.
now, when are you coming back?
uh, tomorrow morning.
promise me you'll stop by the house first thing?
sure.
I'm so sorry about this, Dexter.
I'll see you soon. -- Okay.
why are you not in the shower?
I know. I'm just checking some e-mails.
we have to be at the restaurant in half an hour.
sure you don't want to join me?
you stink.
thought you liked it dirty "ice princess"?
fuck.
dear Ms. Barnes: Please find enclosed a copy of "The Ice Princess." Hosler and Gravel publishing has a proud history of producing quality books and novels and it is my hope that "The Ice Princess" will only further that tradition . I eagerly await hearing your thoughts. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely Gabriel Bosque.
you son of a bitch!
Deb, what did I do?
you lied to me! You're a writer!
I-I'm trying to be, yeah!
I saw all of those e-mails you sent to those publishers
the ice princess!
Oh, you went through my e-mail!
all you wanted was to get close enough to me
so you could sell a book about me and the ice-truck killer!
that's crazy, Deb. Those letters
fuck you! Fuck you!
what can I do you for?
drink? -- Beer. Whatever's on tap.
way to ditch me. -- You were in the shower.
so, are you there? Do you see him?
he's staring at me.
you gonna say something?
I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
I should go.
well, call me when you figure it out. All right?
three bucks.
you had no right!
he's an addict, Rita. He is no good for you!
he's already got you smoking again.
you turned your back on me and your grandchildren.
that was not my fault.
I tried to warn you about Paul, but you ran away with him anyway.
I wasn't running away with Paul.
I was running away from you.
do you have any idea how much it hurts me to see you make the same mistakes again?
I've had my fair share of mistakes.
and guess what -- you were right about Paul.
he was a terrible man.
but for the first time, I feel safe and loved,
and that's because of Dexter.
I can't talk to you when you're like this. I'm going to bed.
this is my life, mother.
if you can't be happy for me, then maybe you shouldn't be here.
if you want to abandon me and the kids again, fine.
that's your choice.
but Dexter is not going anywhere.
last call was 30 minutes ago.
you hear me?
I need you to finish that up.
sorry.
I'm avoiding going back to my motel room.
I'm visiting from Miami.
you ever been there?
I can't say that I have.
how long you lived in Naples?
Oh, a few years now. -- You like it?
okay. This is gonna be awkward.
I need to tell you how I feel.
no, what you need to do is leave
because you been eyeballing me all night.
you really shouldn't do that.
I said get out of my bar.
okay. Just let me say what I need to say, and I'll go.
you stole my life.
what the fuck?
you are really beginning to piss me off.
I'm not the person I'm supposed to be Because you took someone from me.
I will beat your fucking head in If you don't walk out that door right now!
I tried Lila's way.
1973!
the port of Miami!
a shipping container!
a chain saw!
you remember now? You remember now?
you got me confused with someone else!
I know exactly who you are! You made me into what I am!
okay! I -- I killed her.
I had to!
did you? Did you have to?
did you have to saw her into little pieces?!
did you have to leave two little boys soaking in a pool of their mother's blood?
estrada would have killed me if I didn't.
you slaughtered her like an animal because she stole his precious cocaine.
no. We found out she was a snitch for a cop.
she was fucking him.
which cop?
I didn't know his name.
I followed them to -- to a park.
my mother and Harry -- that's what got her killed?
I'm not done with you yet.
isn't this what heroes do -- avenge lost loved ones?
what?
everything okay?
Dexter, what's wrong?
I thought I could resist.
Jesus... are you using?
no, but I'm about to.
tell me where you are
and I'll get in a taxi and I'll come get you.
I have to do this.
no, you don't! Just tell me where you are.
you'll be too late.
don't you bloody do this. You are stronger than that.
I'm not!
Yes, you fucking are.
you've come this far.
if you turn back now,
you'll go right back to the way you were
hollow, angry, alone.
I will get you through this. I swear.
just come back to me. Okay?
Dexter? Are you all right?
it's okay.
I didn't...
it's okay.
I don't care what you did.
it's okay.
it's okay.
baby.
it's okay.
what are you still doing here?
making sure our marina surveillance is in place.
you forget something?
I'm working up rental logs...
... on the other two marinas.
you don't give up, do you? -- Do you?
I'm wide awake anyway. Dexter's out of town.
I don't really sleep when I'm there by myself.
what about the new boyfriend?
we sort of broke up.
well, I broke up with him.
guess you won't be needing this, then.
what's that?
background check.
you said you sere snooping. Just thought I'd help.
you ran a background check on my boyfriend?
what's it say?
Gabriel's clean
well, except for those parking tickets.
just because he's not a criminal Doesn't mean he's not an asshole.
I went through his e-mail.
I know, but it was worth it. I mean...
he was using me to shop around a book about the ice-truck killer.
do you know what kind of writer Gabriel is?
children's books?
"the Ice Princess" is a children's book.
how could I be so fucking stupid?
when my wife met me, she was convinced I was a spy.
Connie didn't know it, but she was actually right.
you ran a background check on her?
no need. -- Must be nice...
to just know like that.
she died... two years ago.
cancer.
I'm sorry.
that's how I lost my mom.
I should go.
let me ask you something.
that boyfriend of yours
did he ever give you a reason not to trust him? -- No.
but I don't think it matters. I mean, I went insane on him.
he'll never forgive me.
any broken bones involved? Facial contusions?
no.
you'll be fine.
do you want to know how I got into the program?
I'd used for years
binge, crash.
thought I had it under control.
then I met Marco.
what a shit.
thought he was my boyfriend,
but he turned out to be my dealer.
bastard had me so strung out by the time he left,
nothing mattered.
nothing was left...
... but rage.
one night...
I was so fucked up -- god.
I went to his house, and I burned it to the ground.
what I didn't know was that Marco was passed out inside.
they blamed the fire on his drugs.
but it was me.
he died because of me.
that night, I went to my first meeting.
seeing that side of myself was terrifying.
that I could possibly do that to another person.
did he deserve it?
Yes.
then you didn't do anything wrong.
Hey, you.
I wasn't expecting you this early.
I didn't hit any traffic.
you're just in time for breakfast.
Where's your mom?
Oh, I doubt she'll be joining us.
she's been in her room all morning.
my guess is she's packing.
maybe I should go.
no.
no, you're staying right here because you're a part of this family.
are you sure? I've put you through so much lately.
I'm here for you, Dexter... No matter what.
what's this?
the patch.
I have some quitting of my own to do. Sit.
is that anything important?
when's THE NEXT ROAD TRIP?
Nope.
morning.
morning, Dexter.
hi... gail.
so, Rita assures me that you are committed to getting better.
I am.
then I want to be here to help.
in fact, I've decided to stay in Miami.
I e-mailed the school board my letter of resignation this morning.
what about your house?
I'll put it on the market.
sweetie, I thought about what you said last night.
I haven't been here for you, and I want to change that.
you know, my sister's looking for a new apartment.
I'm sure we can help you find one, too.
well, don't be silly. I'll be living here.
Dexter, be a dear and pass me the cream, please.
thank you.
Harry taught me to lie
and keep my darkest secrets from those around me...
which is why I need to make sure there's not a trace of blood left on my boat.
he also taught me not to rush to judgment.
things aren't always what they appear to be...
... including harry.
and what about me?
am I the twisted bay harbor butcher...
or the valiant dark defender?
only time will tell.
funny thing is I've met someone who doesn't care what I am.
I suppose every hero needs a sidekick...
every villain, a partner in crime.
all my relationships have been built on not knowing.
but that may be changing.
imagine that -- a life with no more secrets.
we have to catch them in the act at the shipyard.
he's gonna find out, and then he's gonna kill me.
Harry knew my mother.
why would rita print out narcotics anonymous literature if Paul's dead?
because recently I entered the program.
how many fucking ways to sunday do I have to tell you that I'm fine, Maria?
this is my department.
I need to know that you are fit for duty.
that's my job as a lieutenant!
I always stop and eat lunch at 1: 00.
you'll learn that about me.
why don't you sit down?
you're very fidgety.
anyone ever tell you that?
my father.
you applying for the job?
well, you said you'd call.
where are you, and when are you coming back?
uh, tomorrow morning.
promise me you'll stop by the house first thing.
I'll see you soon.
is she cool with you doing this?
I didn't tell her.
I don't care what you did.
I'm no longer sure who made me what I am.
funny thing is I've met someone who doesn't care.
I want to talk to you about Coral Cove.
what about Coral Cove?
the algae on the rocks sent us there.
if I were you, I would consider moving your boat.
security out there sucks ass.
when I get back, I need to hit the Marina and make sure there's no blood traces on my boat.
this isn't a commercial marina.
but I can see the upkeep on this place is dismal.
that's why I'm going to order 24-hour surveillance on this marina and the two others.
Dex, Lies, and Videotape
there's another shipment coming in tomorrow.
cocaine.
how much?
300 bricks, give or take.
can you get your hands on some?
Harry, that wasn't part of our agreement.
look, laura, we need hard evidence.
otherwise, it's just your word against Estrada's.
I'll protect you.
I promise.
you better.
meet me later?
Laura, the tape's still rolling.
ve convincing.
what was that?
Laura, the tape's still rolling.
damn it.
my mother -- confidential informant...
and mumbler.
whatever sweet nothings she had to whisper I probably don't want to hear.
it seems that my foster father and my biological mother were having an affair.
it's bad enough I can't shake the visual, but the questions
did he blame himself for her death?
is that why he took me in?
did he love her, or was he just using her?
was he using me?
I always thought harry's code was on-the-spot creative problem-solving, but maybe he planned for me to settle the score all along.
it's times like this I wish I really were a drug addict.
I had emotional problems as a kid because of what happened to my mother.
and harry tried to said he was trying to help me, but all we ever talked about were his rules.
I spent so much time trying to live up to his expectations because I thought he had my best interests in mind.
if you're going to come over this late, the least cou uld do is b me a coffee.
sorry.
cappuccino -- make a note of it.
truth is, Dex, it doesn't really matter why Harry did what he did.
the result's the same.
you have an addiction.
do you think harry made me what I am?
plenty of people go through trauma without turning to addiction.
whatever harry taught you led you down the wrong path.
but I've built everything in my life on what Harry said I was supposed to be.
my job, my girlfriend。
what do you think you need?
I have no idea.
whatever's inside you is splattered all over that paper that I took from your lab.
looks messy.
it probably is.
look, dexter...
everyone has a moment when they realize that their value system is different from their parents'.
mine was in college, but, hey, maybe you're a late bloomer.
lucky me.
damn right, lucky you.
you get to have a fresh start.
whatever you thought, whatever you did doesn't matter.
now you get to figure out who you are.
I went to lila for answers, but now all I have is more questions.
who am I?
what do I need?
what do I want?
coffee -- I really want a cup of coffee.
what up, half-day?
is there coffee left?
you're late.
I fell asleep before you got home last night.
were you at Rita's?
you're welcome, ass.
your brother looks like shit.
tell me about it.
I may be out of line with this, but did he fall off the wagon?
what wagon?
the only wagon Dexter's ever had is a radio flyer.
your brother's a junkie.
isn't he?
are you high? He's never even smoked a cigarette.
I'm glad you got some new material, though, 'cause "freak" and "psycho" were getting kind of tired.
agent lundy.
so, I hear a rumor you're tracking all our internet activity.
so, is it true?
cause I can explain all that she-male stuff.
I need my team outside in five minutes.
that sounds important.
I just got a major break in the investigation.
patrol found some guy saying he escaped the bay harbor butcher.
he claimed he was captured a couple hours ago.
well, that's a neat trick, considering I was asleep
at least trying to sleep.
this could be good news for me.
Morgan. - Yes.
the other Morgan.
I'd like you to join us, if you can spare him.
that's fine with me.
is there blood?
not that I'm aware of, no.
but what about Masuka?
Yeah, uh, I'm the lead forensics investigator.
Masuka's lab work is more pressing.
I need him to hold down the fort at the station.
he totally saw the she-male stuff.
so, what do you say?
I'll buy you lunch after -- pork sandwich, right?
uh, yes. Sure.
good.
I figured it was time to get a fresh perspective on the case.
rumor has it you have a knack for attracting serial killers.
I hear the same about you.
Dexter also enjoys long walks on the beach and foreign films.
then we've got a lot to talk about.
he knocked me out.
then when I woke up, I was tied up in that train car over there.
you said he used rope?
dumb fuck.
I stretched it out enough so I can get my legs free and then busted out of there.
ran across the road, almost got hit by that guy in the car.
so, that's the alleged victim of the bay harbor butcher.
but I've never seen him before in my life.
O'Connor, Singer... make sure you take pictures of those footprints.
Hey, Dex. - Hey.
so, the victim says the butcher held him in this train car.
Lundy wants you to search for trace evidence.
your spidey sense tingling yet?
we'll see when I get inside.
take your time in there.
we've never been this close to this pendejo.
closer than you think, amigo.
he may have borrowed my pseudonym, but this guy doesn't know the first thing about my techniques
amateur.
what makes you think it was the butcher?
well, he told me that the Bay Harbor Butcher's gonna clean up miami.
he said,"you're gonna get what you deserve.
and what do you deserve, mr. Henry?
well, look...
the butcher kills criminals, right?
I just got out of jail, you know
six years for aggravated assault and home invasion.
he kills murderers.
you didn't kill anyone, did you?
all right, I gave this old guy a heart attack.
it's not like I was doing it on purpose, all right?
I-I used to hit, you know, retirement homes, communities.
Snowbirds are easy targets.
and I don't do that anymore. I did my time.
your mother must be so proud.
I want to check out the train car with your brother.
why don't you keep an eye on our friend here while we confirm his story?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
killing tools left behind -- I'd never be this careless.
whoever did this would never pass Harry's muster.
then again, neither would Harry.
he lied about my past.
he cheated on my foster mother with my biological mother.
maybe lila's right. It's time for a new set of standards.
if you were the Bay Harbor Butcher, would you use a place like this?
actually, yes.
Locationwise, it's not a bad choice.
it's quiet, remote.
could use an upgrade in the lighting department, but...
so, you think this is our guy?
not exactly.
from what I understand, the conditions in this space don't support his M. O.
it's filthy, for one thing.
butcher's clean, orderly...
and some people would say compulsive.
Really? You think he's compulsive?
this doesn't fit, either.
a hatchet is sloppy.
the butcher uses precise surgical instruments.
well, he's not that predictable.
is he?
mixes it up -- different tools every time.
and never rope.
he uses duct tape and plastic wrap.
plastic wrap -- how can you tell?
depression patterns in the skin.
maybe the butcher's having an identity crisis.
it's entirely possible.
but not likely.
my guess is we're looking for a vigilante inspired by the butcher's principles.
bet he never thought he'd be a role model.
I bet you're right.
so, any new leads on the real guy?
not yet.
we're hoping the cameras will turn something up.
cameras?
in the marinas.
put them in a couple of days ago to monitor for suspicious activities.
good news for all those cops who keep boats at coral cove.
you've got one, too, right?
Yeah. Yeah. We've been needing a security upgrade for a long time now.
has Lundy seen me on the tape?
is that why he invited me along today -- to mess with me?
Hey.
I'm sorry if I was short with you this morning.
you know I'm lost without my morning coffee.
whatever.
how was your playdate with lundy? Did you bond?
you didn't tell me they put up security cameras at the marinas.
it's not like they're doing us any good.
we have to update the station's computer system before we can synch up with lundy's high-tech equipment.
so the cameras aren't recording?
well, they are, but nobody's seen any of the footage.
Lundy said it should be fixed by tonight.
well, that's a relief.
your mom told me about your cultural presentation at school.
did your teacher assign you a country yet?
saudi Arabia.
no. That's Israel.
I won't tell the Saudis you said that.
looks like Cody's enjoying himself.
Dexter's very patient with him.
Dexter's a saint.
Where's Astor?
uh, she's by the water.
I want to say goodbye.
I got to go.
I was supposed to meet Lila 10 minutes ago.
who's Lila?
his sponsor.
Really?
a woman?
Yes, mom.
Dexter's sponsor is a woman.
is that a problem?
is she attractive?
mom -- - I'm just curious.
is she?
I have an idea.
why don't you and Lila have dinner with us?
well, that's very kind of you, Gail, but, um...
I think it would be really nice if we got to know the woman you've been spending so much time with.
look, mom, they're doing step work.
but they have to eat, right?
Oh, here. Let me help.
thank you.
so lovely of you to have me over.
now I can put names to faces.
Dexter talks about you all the time.
good things, I hope.
Dexter never says a bad word about anyone.
tell me, Lila.
what exactly are you recovering from?
I'm a meth addict -- sober five years.
I don't know much about meth.
Rita's ex-husband shot heroin.
like Dexter.
guess we know your type, don't we?
just can't seem to help myself.
you have nothing to worry about...
with Dexter, I mean.
I'm sitting right here.
I didn't mean to imply
no. I completely understand.
Rita's your little baby.
you have every right to be concerned.
but if I can reassure you, Dexter's doing incredibly well.
well, I'm happy to hear that.
and I'm sure it's got everything to do with the two of you.
from what he tells me, you're very supportive.
Dexter's lucky to have you.
well... that's very sweet of you to say.
so, Lila, tell us more about yourself.
um, Dexter tells me you're an artist.
Yeah, she does amazing things with a blowtorch. What's it called?
uh, talent.
but I'm, uh...
I'm not the only artist at the table.
Dexter?
since when?
it's not really art.
she's talking about a blood-spatter pattern she took from work.
what kind of career choice is blood spatter, exactly?
he helps catch criminals, mother.
and it makes perfect sense, really
what with Dexter's mother and everything.
you know...
she's...dead.
forgot the bread.
dinner was fantastic, Rita.
and this dessert -- wow.
I never thought I'd say this, but I kind of like her.
Yeah, me too.
she's really helping me.
I wish she didn't have to help you tonight.
Why? What are you thinking?
Mmm, my mom could watch the kids.
I have to swing by the office tonight.
I need to take care of something really important.
Oh, I mean, can't it wait till morning?
I promise we'll go straight to bed.
you're very convincing, but it needs to get done tonight.
just give me an hour, okay?
meet you back at my place? - Okay.
I still think it's funny you write children's books yeah, a big, tough guy like me should be doing something manly, huh, like wrangling cattle.
I don't even know any kids' books.
my dad told me cop stories before bed.
it was really the only alone time I ever got with him.
you okay? - Yeah.
sorry -- just an annoying day at work.
you know that FBI guy I was talking about?
I was really starting to feel like I was his go-to girl, but...
he realized dexter is the superior Morgan.
come on - I should be used to it, you know?
it was like that with my dad, work.
I guess I just hoped with Lundy it would be different. - Why?
I don't know.
I respect him.
he's great at his job, supersmart, and, like, funny, but in this really dry way where he doesn't even know it.
you love him.
what?
no. - You do.
you totally have a crush on Grundy. - Lundy.
Oh, now you're getting touchy about it.
I don't have a crush on him.
he's like my dad, except I spent my whole life trying to get my dad to notice me, and he actually pays attention to what I have to say.
and Grundy loves you.
Oh, fuck off.
Lundy's good -- double-locked...
and a bit beyond my expertise.
I could try to crack it open, but in my own station...
too risky.
I can do this more often now that my mom's in town.
I feel like we're being bad.
bad -- bad is good.
Oh, let the machine get it.
Hey, Dex, just calling to check in
thought we could do the debriefing on dinner.
I thought it went well, don't you?
I'd say so.
Rita's sweet -- very Martha Stewart.
I love Martha Stewart.
God, her mum -- she's got quite the rod up her ass, doesn't she?
by the way, I am such a twat.
I can't believe I almost slipped up about your mum.
mind you, it could have been worse.
I could have spilled the beans about our road trip.
don't you dare!
can you imagine Rita's face if I told her that you and I had spent the night together in a hotel?
anyway...
you and lila stayed in a hotel together?
we had adjoining rooms.
adjoining rooms? Right.
God, I am such an idiot.
I can't believe I defended you to my mother while you were off sleeping with another woman.
Rita, wait.
I thought you were different than Paul, but you're the same.
you know what? Actually, you're worse.
you made me trust you.
Rita, please, will you just let me explain? - I've had it!
I have been patient and understanding, but there's only so much I can take.
you're a liar and a cheat, and I am through.
it's over, Dexter.
Tracy Jenkins was given the liver of a 9-year-old accident victim...
Hi, honey.
I thought you were spending the night at dexter's.
we had a fight.
I think we broke up.
what?
mama's here.
yesterday I was so hopeful -- a new me, a new life.
but a life without Rita seems strange.
what in the name of fuckare you doing up so early?
I got to getto the station.
are you okay?
you seem weird --weirder than usual.
Rita broke up with melast night.
Seriously?
what happened?
it's a long story.
I've got time.
yeah... but I don't.
cliff notes.
she thinks I did something bad, but I didn't.
did you tell her that?
I tried, but she dumped me before I had a chance to explain.
she said,"it's over,"and left.
well, did you go after her?
was I supposed to?
you're such a guy.
when I get pissed, I say stuff I don't mean all the time
I hate you," "I faked it," "you're hung like a grape.
you lost me.
when Rita said,"it's over,
I'm sure she didn't actually mean it's over.
stop being a douche bag and go fight for her.
she's fucking perfect.
I know.
Hello?
Oh, hey.
sure, I'll be right there.
Yeah. I'll tell him.
Bye.
who's that, Gabriel?
no, Lundy.
he's holding a meetingat the station about the Bay Harbor case.
he specifically requested that you be there.
I missed my window.
he's already seen the footage.
me? Why?
because you're his new butt buddy.
you gonna be okay?
check back with me later.
the show has already started, but have they seen the feature presentation
bane of the Bay Harbor Butcher,
starring Dexter Morgan as himself?
so, it's all synched up?
Yep, you can watchstreaming video of the marina right now if you want to.
Yeah.
maybe you'll get to seesome pontoon poon.
did you... need something?
that's not my marina... yet.
I'll be making my on-screen debut soon enough.
I've got to figure out a way to get to those video files.
the media frenzyabout the bay harbor butcher has come back to bite us --big surprise.
now we've got a wanna be vigilante out there who liked the butcher's style and thought, "hey, I should try this at home.
he attacked this man
John Henry, ex-convict, preyed on the elderly.
it gets better.
I have already received reports of ads on Craigs list and coffee-shop bulletin boards requesting the services of the butcher.
people think they've found their own personal batman.
this is not good news.
if this kind of thing catches on, we're looking at an epidemic.
kind of like herpes.
fucking, Masuka, I'm trying to listen.
one in four, Morgan --one in four.
vigilante justice is domestic terrorism.
and terrorism prevention is the FBI's top priority.
I have done my bestto be diplomatic, but if we lose one life to a vigilante,
I will pull this case from Miami metro and hand it over in full to the bureau.
that's a promise.
that's a disaster.
it'd be raining feds in Miami.
so, if we want to keep the investigation here, we need to nip this in the bud, make an example of our would-be vigilante.
the last thing we need is a bunch of weekend warriors...
I think I found a suspect.
could you?
Olson's mother was hurt badly in a home-invasion robbery.
guess who hurt her.
Oh, please tell me John Henry, our train-car victim.
I think Olson attacked him for revenge.
any evidence?
only circumstantial.
can you get him in here for questioning?
can't find him.
okay.
leak this to some of your media contacts.
let's beat this guy out of the bushes.
nice work, detective.
let's get moving.
I need hard evidence on this Olson character, and fast.
and if you can find the guy, even better.
the full force of the FBI-- that's the last thing I need.
I've got to make sure Lundy gets his man...
after I figure out a way to erase the Marina files and make up with my girlfriend.
and then maybe I'll tackle world hunger because things can't really get much worse.
there's another shipment coming in tomorrow. Cocaine.
how much?
300 bricks, give or take.
turn it off.
that wasn't part of our agreement, Harry.
I said turn it off.
I heard what you said.
I just don't take orders from you.
is there a reason you'rein my lab, sergeant Doakes?
is there a reason you're listening to tapes as old as you are, Morgan?
I had a little talk with your sister.
it turns out she didn't know you were in program.
anonymous, sergeant.
how long did you say you been clean?
actually, I didn't, because it's none of your goddamn business.
so, if I were to take a hair from your desk and run it for drugs, it would come back positive, right?
because why would someone pretend to be an addict if he's not...
unless he's got something a hell of a lot worse to hide?
Back...the fuck...off.
you want to hit me? Go for it.
I've been waiting for a chance to take your ass out.
I know how you feel, sergeant.
I want to file a formal complaint against Doakes.
Jesus, Dexter, the two of you
he crossed the line, lieutenant.
he broke into my lab.
he went through my personal things. He threatened me.
he's probably gonna start tailing me again.
sergeant Doakes tailed you?
for weeks, maybe longer.
okay, you have every right to file a complaint, but before you do that,
I'd like the chance to talk to James myself.
he's really not much of a talker.
I'm asking you, as a personal favor to me, to hold off.
can you do that?
Yeah.
okay, in the meantime,
I strongly encourage you to take a break for a couple of hours.
just go somewhere.
cool off. - No.
excuse me?
I need to be here, lieutenant.
this is really not a good time for me to leave.
it isn't a suggestion, Dexter.
it's an order.
clear the station. Clear your head.
I don't want to see you here until after lunch.
understood?
blimey, look at you.
you want to tell me what's going on?
what's going on?
being the new me sucks.
I'm about to be found out at work for what I am
for what I really am.
and I can't do anything to stop it because I got kicked out of the office to cool off.
well, that seems to be going well for you.
add to that the fact that Rita heard your message and dumped me last night.
I tried to explain to her that nothing happened, but she wouldn't listen to me.
nobody fucking listens to me.
listen, you need to calm down, okay?
last time I saw you like this, you came back covered in blood.
so?
you're the one who said I'm supposed to feel my feelings.
well, now I'm telling you to get them under control.
you don't understand.
why don't you make me?
which step was that?
the naughty one.
what are you thinking?
absolutely nothing.
I guess we found a way to quiet the voices in your head.
I guess so.
how do you feel?
much better, actually.
I guess I must bea good sponsor after all.
definitely.
and where are you off to?
I still have that thing at work to deal with.
well, come back tomorrow.
I promise you some serious recovery.
Hello?
Dexter, hey.
you at work?
uh, I will be soon.
I was just taking a break. What's going on?
I'd really like to get together and talk.
I don't like our last conversation ended.
me neither.
you said you wanted to explain, and I owe it to youto hear you out.
I owe it to us.
wow, okay.
so, can you come over after work?
sure.
great. - Great.
apparently my new life involves a love triangle.
I'm that guy.
the voices are back -- excellent.
you were tailing Dexter?
what the hell were you thinking?
if you wanted to have lunch, you could have asked.
if Dexter files a complaint, you will be kicked off the force, end of story.
there's a reason he hasn't reported me until now.
he's hiding something, Maria. I can feel it.
is this another one of your conspiracy theories?
it's instinct and a hell of a lot of experience.
I've spent years looking the enemy in the face, and I'm telling you Morgan is dangerous.
your instincts haven't been that great these days, James.
two shooting sin the last six months, stalking a police employee
listen to me.
morgan lied about the Ice-Truck killer.
that crack pipe knew way more than he ever told us.
he was trying to protect his sister.
you of all people should understand that.
I followed him to an N. A.Meeting.
that asshole lied about that, too.
you're obsessed.
I'm not.
you are, and I need you to see it...
as your boss and as your friend.
we've been through this before, and last time it cost you our relationship.
this time it's gonna get you kicked off the force or worse.
I'll take my chances.
let it go. I mean it.
leave Dexter alone.
the Batista suspect come in yet -- the wanna be vigilante?
Olson just came in
saw himself on the 3: 00 news and showed upwith his lawyer.
I hope we nail his ass to the wall.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Morgan. - Right here.
Oh, the other Morgan.
I didn't know you were a smoker.
have you seen Dexter Morgan?
Oh, he's on a break. Why?
detective Batista's got a suspect in interview room one.
we think he's the would-be vigilante who attacked our train-car victim.
I need Morgan to take some scrapings for evidence.
you want to use Dexter again?
isn't Masuka on your task force?
Yes, he is.
so, Mr. Olson, the man who assaulted your mom was attacked yesterday.
did you know that?
Nope.
can't say I'm upset, though -- son of a bitch almost killed my mom.
my client's emotional, detective.
I'm sure he's not trying to say he's -- any idea who might have done it?
I don't know.
maybe it was the butcher.
if you ask me, a guy like that should be running the police force, not hiding from it.
is this a lion or a hippo?
I think it's a lion.
tastes like a hippo.
animal cracker?
no, thank you.
what do you do for a living, Mr. Olson?
I just lost my job.
that's too bad.
I see that you have a minor assault record and no alibi for yesterday morning.
I'm sure my client didn't realize he needed one.
do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Olson?
she just broke up with me.
why, you interested?
just curious.
now, this is a lion.
all right, let me keep this all straight.
no job, no relationship.
you got guns and a minor assault record. - And I voted for George Bush both times.
I'm sorry, detective, were you getting at something?
what he's getting at, Mr. Novik, is that your client fits the four-point profile of someone who'd commit a vigilante offense.
I think you'rea ticking time bomb.
you ask me, you just needed a reason to take the law into your own hands.
and the butcher was the perfect excuse.
you don't know me.
we know you attacked John Henry.
you need proof to make those kinds of accusations, detective.
you heard the man, detective.
we've got work to do.
make yourself comfortable, Mr. Olson.
we're just getting started with you.
that's my Marina.
and in less than 30 minutes, I'll be on that screen.
I need to take care of this, and fast.
I'm out of time.
I need an idea, a sign, anything.
what would the old Dexter do?
definitely not that.
no security cameras.
apparently the new Dexter's stuck in high school.
maybe I am a late bloomer.
a fire drill? Are you kidding?
we have work to do.
it's probably one of those kids in the bullpen.
it's something I would have done.
all clear. Everybody out.
all clear! Everybody out!
respect the vest.
don't make me take out my hose.
like it never happened.
if only the rest of life were so easy to figure out.
Hey, where you headed?
I figured you'd be first in line to check out the firemen.
I have to arrange protective custody for that piece-of-shit train-car victim.
Why?
because we have nothing on Olson
not even enough to get a warrant to search his place.
is that Oson's file?
if we don't get something soon, Lundy's gonna have to let him go, which means Olson's gonna kill again, which means we lose the Bay Harbor Butcher case to the FBI, which means we're all fucked.
some more than others.
no shit.
till Lundy showed up,
I just felt like the dip shit who slept with the Ice-Truck killer.
if he pulls the plug, I go back to being the resident retard.
chin up, little sister
these things have a way of working themselves out.
I just have to find a piece of evidence to make sure Lundy catches Olson fair and square.
looks like I have a fan club, membership of one.
why you so interested in the Bay Harbor Butcher?
who the fuck are you?
holy, you're him, aren't you?
stop. Stop.
don't kill me. Don't kill me.
I'm like you.
I take out criminals.
you mean you try... pitifully.
no, that wasj ust the last one.
he got away.
I should have never made it personal.
you've killed others?
that's what I'm trying to tell you.
first was a drug dealer --I ran him down with my car.
it felt --it felt fucking great, even better than the free stash l got off him.
and then this guy at work found out I was fucking his wife.
he started to beat on her, he I pushed him down a starwell.
the cops thought it was an accident, but it was me.
see, you can't kill me.
I wasn't going to...
until now.
this is what the kill room should look like
the inside of a big plastic bag.
of course, I spent hours working in this train car yesterday, so I'm not too worried about trace evidence.
to your credit, your location was well chosen.
I just needed a little cleaning, a few lights, proper tools, of course.
I did it because of you. - No.
you attacked those people because you wanted to.
Yeah, but you inspired me...
I didn't...
with your principles. - They're not my principles.
of course they are.
don't tell me who I am.
my whole life, I've done what someone else said I should do, been who he said I should be.
I followed his rules.
I stuck to his plan.
I never stopped to think about what I wanted and what I needed.
and now I don't know who I'm supposed to be.
I'll tell youone thing, though.
I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.
I'm certainly not anybody's role model.
what are you talking about, then?
who are you?
I'll let you knoww hen I figure that out.
though, I got to tell you, I am well on my way, because, as sure as I'm standing here, I don't need to kill you.
that's a relief.
I mean that need that comes from within that always drives me to this table
I don't feel it.
I'm in recovery.
well, I mean, I knew you weren't gonna kill me.
no, I'm gonna kill you. I have to.
I just don't need to. It's very empowering.
anyone in there, make yourself known!
arm.
leg.
head.
it's Olson, gift-wrapped.
it would seem the butcher is watching us, tracking the investigation.
that wouldn't be too hard to do.
but why'd he leave the victim's body for us? That's a first.
probably didn't take too kindly to he idea of Olson imitating him.
it's a pretty good way to discourage others, don't you think?
I hate to say it, but he probably did us a favor.
you take the law into your own hands, the Bay Harbor boogeyman's gonna get you.
this is the first time we've set foot in a place where the Bay Harbor Butcher's actually been.
let's get busy.
anybody seen Lundy?
over there on the phone.
he's talking to D. C.I think.
Oh, shit. Is he gonna pull the case from us?
sure, have robinson call me. He's got my cell.
I came over here to getsome privacy, officer Morgan.
well, sorry. - Too much background noise over there.
hearing's the first thing to go.
or is it memory? I always forget.
you gonna pull the case from us?
you said if anybody died - - at the hands of a vigilante.
this was our killer.
I'm afraid you're still stuck with me.
will your brotherbe here tomorrow?
Yeah, I think so.
I'll tell him you want him within shouting distance.
hey...
what just happened?
no, it's cool. He's always been the family superstar.
who?
Dexter, your new go-to guy.
Oh, this isn't about Dexter.
it's about Masuka. I can't stand him.
if I hear one more titty joke, I'm afraid I'll punch him in the face.
Really?
Hey.
come on in.
sit down.
I was angry before when you tried to explain.
this time I'll listen.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the road trip.
came with me to Naples...
as my sponsor. That's all.
why would you need her in Naples?
you remember when I went out of town?
I went to find the man who killed my mother.
what are you talking about?
a lot of stuff has been coming up for me in recovery, things I never thought I'd deal with.
I watched my mother die when I was 3.
I'm so sorry.
she was murdered in front of me.
I saw it happen.
I think that has a lot to do with why I'm...
why I do the things I do.
of course. Of course, it makes sense.
I found the man who killed her in Naples.
I thought maybe if I talked to him, I could find some kind of closure.
that's why Lila came with me --for support.
what?
this was a huge moment in your life, Dexter...
and you chose to include Lila but not me.
she's my sponsor.
and I'm your girlfriend.
I was afraid you wouldn't understand.
okay.
okay. So, let me try to understand now.
you and Lila went away together as sponsor and sponsee.
and you really did have adjoining rooms.
Yes.
so, you didn't have sex that night?
no.
okay.
not that night.
leave.
no, please. Leave now.
there was a time I would have done anything to protect Rita.
I would have even lied.
but today I told the truth...
even though I knew she'd get hurt.
maybe I am leaving the old me behind.
my mother -- she was murdered when I was a boy.
I was there. I saw it.
there were three men arrested for those murders.
one's deceased, one's doing life without possibility, and that's the only one that's still an open case -- Santos Jiminez.
1972!
did you have to saw her into little pieces?
did you have to leave two little boys soaking in a pool of their mother's blood?
I don't care what you did.
it's okay.
who the fuck are you?
Oh, pardon my tits.
how could you do this to Rita, not to mention her kids?
Hey, Rita broke up with me, okay?
cause when you're around,
I kind of feel like I can deal with anything, you know?
your past is a bigger mystery than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.
it's time to make Doakes go away.
sergeant Doakes is on administrative leave pending an internal affairs investigation.
the killer's making us chase our tails.
you know what that means?
that he might be one of us?
I was working on my piece, and it just caught fire.
I was so scared.
promise me that you won't leave me, that you won't go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
morning Comes
I can't believe he said it.
even for Masuka, it was too much.
and Batista didn't do anything.
talk about Lame -- he fucking sat there.
you know how much I wanted to...
is that the sports section?
I used to enjoy quiet mornings, but ever since the fire at Lila's loft, she's been crashing here a bit too often.
is that my shirt?
I thought it was Dexter's.
it's not.
uh, no, it's okay. Just...keep it.
and so now I share the kitchen with a cobra and a mongoose.
did somebody drink all the coffee again?
no. Somebody didn't drink all the coffee.
I had a cup, and Dexter had a cup, and it just kind of went like that until the pot was empty.
Deb, please. - What?
someone didn't drink all the coffee.
stupid question.
why are you sticking up for her, anyway?
I'm just trying to keep the peace.
maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
has the fire damage been repaired yet?
the insurance company is still dicking me around.
won't give me a check.
don't worry about it.
I'll be moving out soon.
stop leeching off your brother?
whatever for?
again, Dex, thanks for sticking up for me.
I am Switzerland.
Yeah, and I'm out of here.
what's this?
it's the dragon zombie.
Cody likes to hide things in my bag.
he's trying to control you.
by hiding toys in your bag, you have no choice but to return them to him.
he's 7.
he seldom has thoughts more complicated than the desire for candy.
I'll see you at your loft tonight.
Oh, honey -- honey, no.
no.
you said we could make breakfast.
I meant cereal, baby.
I don't want cereal.
I guess I should give Rita back her key.
Cody, no. No, let mommy get the door...
it's dexter!
he brought doughnuts!
I did.
I also brought... a dragon zombie!
I knew you'd find it!
hope it's okay I'm here.
could you watch them while I finish getting ready?
Astor still has homework.
thank you, Dexter.
meet me at the car.
good thing I dropped by.
don't ever do it again.
I'm sorry?
it's too hard on the kids, and it's too hard on me.
it's Paul all over again.
please, Dexter, just stay away.
you'll notice we have some new faces here.
please make them feel welcome.
our immediate task is to re-examine every criminal case involving our 18 victims.
where would you like us to start?
by answering every question as honestly and with as much detail as you can.
excuse me, sir.
answering questions?
that is correct.
I can hardly expect you to investigate your own cases.
what are you saying?
are we under investigation?
we are now operating under the assumption that our killer is somehow connected to law enforcement.
whether he be a file clerk, a dispatch officer, park ranger...
or a police officer.
or a police officer.
is that why you brought in all these suits?
special agents.
sir, you risk alienating every cop on the task force if you do this.
we go where the chase leads us...
even if it gets messy.
it's insulting.
we're just as capable as they are of looking into our own cases.
who wears a wool suit in the middle of summer in Miami?
Nazis -- that's who.
it's all about intimidation.
and the idea that one of us could be the killer?
it's complete bullshit.
what do you mean? "Us" who?
Lundy has his feds investigating all of our cases that are tied to the bay harbor victims. That's good here.
look, we got to stand tough here.
we got to make it clear to them that we're not gonna be their little "yes, sir, no, sir" lapdogs.
gentlemen.
Morgan, I'd like to go over some of your cases tomorrow.
got them all listed right there.
it would be helpful if you could gather up any notes you may have taken.
happy to help.
way to stand tough, Dexter.
sorry.
that's exactly how hitler walked.
it seems my manifesto unintentionally helped Lundy narrow his focus.
that's what I get for trying to emulate Lila and take the offensive.
I've always worked best in the shadows, and that's where I have to stay.
Lundy's really pissing people off.
he's got his whole crew looking through every case involving any of the bay harbor victims.
he sounds desperate.
you know you're gonna be called in.
I'll be curious to see if I show up.
okay, James, you need to be a little careful here.
if you want to keep your job, you got to cooperate.
being on suspension does not exclude you from this.
and who was it that suspended me again?
Oh, shit. That was you.
please, don't act like you didn't deserve it.
your case is coming up for review in a week. If you want to keep your job
you keep saying that, Maria.
what makes you think I want to keep my job?
are you just talking here, or is this something that you've seriously considered?
well, you and I both know that I've gone as high as I can over there.
maybe it's time to move on.
well, what would you do?
I don't know.
my father was a butcher.
maybe I'll open up my own butcher shop.
Yeah, I can just see you putting on an apron every morning.
look, I have a friend.
he's the head of personnel at stillwater security.
government contractors?
they're always looking for people like you.
it's a dangerous world out there.
they pay a lot of money to make it safe.
Yeah, you got that right.
all right. Set it up.
I'll meet with your guy.
officer Morgan.
Debra. - Yes?
I picked the Rodrigo case for you to look into
small-time dope dealer.
arrested for murder, ended up walking free, then disappeared off the face of the earth until his body was found in a garbage bag in the ocean.
not exciting enough for you?
well, it's just... I'm homicide.
I mean, I thought you didn't want us checking into our own cases.
you're new to homicide.
at the time of this case, you were still in vice.
no conflict there.
well, I'm flattered you want me in on this, but...
Batista and Doakes were lead here.
I feel kind of weird about investigating my own colleagues.
weird. Gosh.
I'd hate for you to feel weird.
you know what I mean.
would you have dinner with me tomorrow night?
or would that make you feel weird?
I'd love to have dinner with you.
good.
I'll take you to the best restaurant in Miami.
great.
I like the smell. Don't you?
like something exciting happened here.
it's like when a piece of bread gets stuck in the toaster.
you like to pretend there's no poetry in you.
so, what's the problem with the insurance company?
why aren't they paying?
it's ridiculous.
they think the fire is of suspicious origin, and they need to finish their investigation.
what do they mean,"suspicious"?
are they saying you started the fire on purpose?
who knows what they're saying?
you know insurance companies -- anything to keep from paying out.
Yeah, especially when a fire has multiple points of origin.
so, you never told me.
how did it go at Rita's this morning?
uh, you know, I just returned cody's toy, and that was it.
no quickie on the kitchen table?
Rita doesn't have a kitchen table.
Oh, clever way of not answering the question.
it was...
awkward, actually.
always is.
you can't go back. You know that.
I'm not trying to go anywhere.
well, the bed's all ready.
uh, I can'T.
and why would that be?
I have too much work to do.
I have all these case files I have to go over for tomorrow.
you didn't bring any work with you?
home.
I need to... work at home.
okay. Goodbye, then.
so, I'll see you tomorrow?
whatever.
is it possible she started that fire on purpose?
I can't imagine why.
what I do know is that I can't take any risks right now.
Hi, you wanted to -- - Morgan, come in.
can I offer you some tea?
uh, no, thank you. I'm...
and he pours it anyway.
he's trying to throw me off balance, show that I don't have the power to say no to him.
how about some sesame crackers to go with that?
so I'll say yes to everything.
I'd love some.
sorry. Guess I ate them all.
ass hole.
so, you worked first hand on, what, four of the cases related to the Bay Harbor investigation?
I believe so.
your reports were a real pleasure to read.
concise, meticulous.
I appreciate that.
good. Thank you.
does your sister prefer meat or fish?
you have more than one?
sister? Uh, no. Just Deb.
or is she more of a salad kind of person?
she's definitely a carnivore.
good. Good.
so... the Rodrigo case.
let's talk about that one.
okay.
kind of blew it, didn't you?
I'm sorry?
Anthony Rodrigo -- crack dealer with an apparent habit of killing people who got in his way.
I believe this was -- yes
Doakes' and Batista's case.
they finally tied rodrigo to one of his victims, built a solid manslaughter case, would have got him off the street for a few years.
but the case largely rested on the bloodwork that you did.
bloodwork that in the course of the trial was proven to be, well...wrong.
so, you
one of the most cautious and precise forensic specialists I've had the pleasure to work with
you performed bloodwork that directly led to Rodrigo walking free.
I asked myself,"how the hell did that happen?
and did you answer,"Dexter blew the case on purpose
so that he could get Rodrigo off the streets for good with a cordless reciprocating saw"?
I'm sorry. You've caught me off-guard here.
sloppy bloodwork.
look, this wasn't my idea.
could have said no.
come on, Angel, we have a job to do.
since when is it my job to try and prove to a fellow police officer that I'm not a serial killer?
you know that's not what this is about.
what is this about?
it's about trying to find someone who had motive and opportunity to kill all 18 of our victims.
um, no way it's anybody in our department.
then help me prove it.
go through the Rodrigo case with me.
look, it is not just you.
LaGuerta's cooperating on her old cases.
even matthews is coming in.
the Rodrigo file.
you just happen to have it with you.
I'm a reasonable man.
you know how it is.
the defense attorneys bring in their so-called blood experts to counter everything I say.
I'm familiar with the process.
I understand how this may look like sloppy bloodwork to the layman.
that's what Rodrigo's defense convinced the jury of.
but as you can see, the low-velocity blood drops clearly point in the direction opposite to that in which we know Rodrigo to have fled, which makes it impossible
except those low-velocity drops were revealed to actually be 90-degree passive drops that were given tails due to the angle of the floor.
perhaps, but if you then examine the blood trail
which we know isn't a blood trail, but projected blood.
you're not winning me over here, Morgan.
the truth?
by all means.
I was overworked. I was carrying half a dozen cases at once.
it was a heat wave -- means a spike in...homicides.
this one got pushed aside.
I didn't write up my summary until an hour before the trial.
I obviously overlooked a few things.
a murderer walked free because you were overworked?
Yes.
who's this guy? Lenny Asher.
Lenny? He's a nutjob...
but it says he lived next door to Rodrigo, filed all kinds of complaints.
but he filed complaints about everybody.
he'd just sit at his window all day and call us every time he saw someone move.
he called us once to say there was something weird about the clouds.
still no harm talking to him, right?
who the hell are you?
detective Batista. This is officer Morgan.
we're with the Miami metro homicide.
can we come in?
who's dead?
I know.
they found him in the ocean.
I hope a whale ate him and shat him out, and then ate him again.
you weren't too close to him, were you?
he was scum!
Yeah, you made numerous calls about him when he used to live here.
he was a drug dealer.
he played loud music, urinated on my lilies.
you actually saw that?
they were dead.
that's all I needed to know.
any thoughts as to who might have killed him?
how the hell should I know?
look at that joker parked right in front of the fire hydrant.
I got his license plate, though.
that would be our car.
you, uh, take a lot of notes?
anything hinky happens outside this window, I make a note on it.
how long you been doing that?
since someone stuck a nail in my tire -- march 1998.
rodrigo was last seen alive the day after his trial -- april 16, 2002.
think you might have taken any notes that day?
if something happened, I did.
you still have those notes?
here.
what kind of order did you put them in?
I told you -- 2002.
I have no idea if Lundy bought my excuse.
either way, it makes me a little anxious to see my sister looking through the Rodrigo files
looking for me.
you're never gonna guess what I found.
what did you find?
an apartment.
great.
one-bedroom near 78th and Harding.
big change.
Yeah, well, it's time, you know?
well, good for you. When do you move?
as soon as possible, but not tonight.
I have a date.
I thought you broke up with Gabriel.
no, it's... someone new.
Lundy, special agent Lundy?
he's at least 20 years older than me. What do you care?
I don't. I mean...
I'm sure you wouldn't do anything like that.
what are you talking about? Do anything like what?
like try to sleep your way to the top.
you douche.
that is so not true.
no, of course not.
I shouldn't have even said anything, and I'm sure that thought would never even occur to anyone else.
double douche!
you are not allowed to talk about anyone I date as long you're seeing little miss "pardon my tits."
I am sorry, Dex, but she is gross...
and pale, and nobody is pale in Miami.
she is obviously a vampire.
a gross English-titty vampire.
you just described the perfect woman.
truth is I need to avoid Lila for now.
Harry taught me that the key to survival was staying one step ahead.
but Lundy almost trapped me today.
I can't be unprepared like that again.
Hey, it's me.
why aren't you here? I'm starving.
Oh, I thought you knew -- it's my bowling night.
bowling? Really?
what, like Fred Flintstone?
I'm more in the Barney Rubble category.
how fun.
I'd love to watch you bowl.
it's not really a spectator sport.
Oh, well, I'll close my eyes.
but it's sort of the guys' night out.
come on, Dexter, I want to meet your friends.
where is it? What time is it?
give me the address.
starlight lanes. 1690 Michigan Avenue. 7:00.
I guess I'm going bowling.
go, Dexter!
he only got three pins down.
Yeah, well, I like to celebrate the little things in life.
Hey, if you like little things, I'm your man.
I mean, I'm not little everywhere.
some places I'm just perfectly average.
you are perfectly adorable.
how come you got a hug and I got a pat on the nose?
cause you're like a retarded puppy.
your ass does the cutest little thing when you bowl.
Oh, thank you.
if you guys will excuse me, I need to use the ladies' room.
she's pretty hot.
Yes. She is.
nice place.
very, uh...
gray.
Yes, the bureau have always been known for their fashion sense.
honestly, all I care about is the kitchen.
you cook?
like I said, best restaurant in Miami.
Really?
you're gonna cook for me.
well, don't ever expect me to return the favor...
unless you're a big fan of toast.
I would love to eat your toast.
gosh, that sounded wrong.
so, what's for dinner?
uh, steak Florentine and grilled potatoes Italian-style.
Fucking-A.
there's that mouth again.
Oh, I'm sorry.
it's just the way I talk.
and if we're gonna be together, you better get used to it.
can't change who I am.
I'm crass and dirty, and...
I have a very filthy mind.
you're also pretty adorable. - I know.
now start peeling potatoes.
I like a man that takes control.
wash your hands first.
you're so turning me on.
you know, considering our age difference, you're not too old to spank.
no, stop. Please.
I can't control myself.
Oh, my god!
you sure you don't want to grab a beer with us, Dexter?
Nah, thanks. I'm tired.
Mmm, I hoped you saved enough energy for me.
that doesn't exactly look like the look of love.
I'm sorry. I really am tired. I
help! Help, please!
somebody please come!
God.
you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Dexter, you're bleeding.
it's not deep.
I mean, what the hell?
he tried to grab my watch.
it's stupid. I should have let him have it.
it was just -- it was reflex.
as long as you're okay.
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Jesus christ. They sell anyone a gun in Florida, won't they?
Yeah, I know. Scary, right?
anyone get a license plate?
no, it was all too fast.
you want us to take you to a doctor? - No.
really, I'm fine.
I'll take care of him.
so, who was it?
who?
that man.
he wasn't trying to rob you. He was trying to kill you.
Santos Jiminez, the man who murdered my mother.
Oh, my god, Dexter. - He must have followed me to the bowling alley.
if you hadn't have seen him in time
I did see him. That's all that matters.
none of this scares you?
nothing you could do, Dexter, would scare me.
I believe you.
come here.
whatever comes, we'll get through this together.
I'm not leaving your side, Dexter.
I'm not leaving yours.
Really?
why would you think that?
you've just been a bit distant lately.
I get that way when I'm stressed.
what are you stressed about?
right now, nothing.
do you think Dexter will come for breakfast tomorrow?
Oh, I-I don't think so, honey.
well, maybe we should call him.
it's kind of late.
but Dexter stays up late.
she doesn't want to call him.
why not?
Dexter and I broke up.
Why?
they don't like each other anymore.
well, that's not true.
does that mean he doesn't like us, either?
Oh, no. Of course he likes you.
it's just... it's hard when two people break up.
it makes them sad to see each other.
I don't think Dexter's gonna be coming for breakfast for a while.
sorry.
Lila may be the right woman for me, but she's wrong about one thing.
recovery simply isn't an option.
when I let my guard down, I open myself up for attack or capture.
I need to embrace who I am, who I've always been.
I need to kill the man who murdered my mother.
I'd almost forgotten this feeling
driving toward a kill, all my senses sharpened.
it's like I've been living underwater, holding my breath, and now I can finally breathe.
so how come it's so suffocating in here?
it's nice to see you.
Yeah, feels all warm and comfy.
I spoke to Todd about you. - Yeah?
he's very interested.
he said someone with your special-ops background typically starts at about $200, 000.
I could live with that.
you can meet him tonight.
9: 00, bar at the hilton.
I'll be there.
sergeant Doakes.
I appreciate your time.
can we get this over with, sir?
okay.
it's interesting that of the 18 victims, 9 passed through this very station, and you worked on cases involving 4 of them.
and you were unable to obtain a single conviction.
the Smith case thrown out because of inadmissible evidence.
orozco skipped bail, never to be seen again.
the Rodrigo case -- lost due to bad bloodwork.
excuse me?
Oh, you weren't aware of that?
the D. A.didn't get a conviction. That's all I know.
are we through here, sir?
no, actually.
we're just getting -- - we're done.
look at this.
june 1st -- Mrs. Holcomb takes out trash, drops soda bottle, doesn't pick it up.
march 17th -- airplane flying too low.
I told you, this guy's a fruit bat.
april.
Hey, it's the month we want.
april 16th...
fuck me sideways, listen to this.
rodrigo gets into car parked in wrong space.
must be drunk because someone is carrying him.
the license plate's right here. This is from 9: 00 the night he disappeared.
the last time anyone saw him alive. We got to run that plate.
I bet whoever owned this fucking car is our killer.
I'm gonna get Lundy.
he's out with his feds.
well, I'm calling him in.
Lila almost had me believing it was possible to change, to become something else, as if that ever really happens.
I've always known what I am.
if the glove fits...
a secret cabin in the middle of the everglades
what more could a rededicated serial killer ask for?
cocaine.
apparently Mr. Jiminez never gave up his old habits.
what a bad, bad man.
what, you think it just turned on by itself?
there is no such plate.
is that a 1 or an "I"?
fuck you, Lenny. Fuck your handwriting.
kind of busy here.
then can you please tell me where I can find Dexter?
I brought him some dinner.
Dexter's not here.
where is he?
how should I know?
he said he was working late.
is that what he told you?
what do you mean?
he's not working late.
I think he lied to you.
Oh, men are such pigs.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sure he'll show up.
he's very excited about this job.
I swear, I've tried every combination. Nothing is coming up.
I told you Lenny would be a waste of time.
maybe it's not a Florida plate.
try Georgia.
holy shit, here it is.
the vehicle was registered to Charlie Lewis.
I know that name.
a drug dealer out of New York.
a tough guy -- likes to carry a big-ass knife.
that's our guy. That's the Bay Harbor Butcher.
I told you he wasn't a cop.
what? Shit.
where is he?
according to this, South Bay correctional facility.
what? For how long?
Oh, shit.
Charlie Lewis was arrested April 12, 2002.
that's four days before Rodrigo was seen being carried into the car.
who had his car? One of his gang?
this is where it gets really bad.
the vehicle was seized as evidence.
by who?
by our department.
where was the vehicle held?
right here in our evidence lab, behind a secure gate.
someone signed the vehicle out, picked Rodrigo up, killed him, and then signed the vehicle back in.
so you have records.
why would we keep them?
the only people allowed access to those vehicles are members of the Miami metro police department. Holy shit.
Bay Harbor Butcher is one of our own.
we keep this to ourselves for now -- just the three of us.
I'm gonna go tell it to a bottle of scotch.
here we are again.
what -- what the fuck?
I know. I keep asking myself that same question.
let me out of here!
but...
I'm finding it's best to accept things you can't change, you know?
normally, I'd have a chat to make sure you understand why you're here, but...
I think you have a pretty good idea.
let me go.
I got cocaine.
you can have all of it.
it's funny you should say that. I am off the wagon.
but that was never my drug.
I'll fucking kill you!
no, Mr. Jiminez.
I'm gonna kill you tonight...
for what you did to my mother...
and because, well, this is what I do best.
it's kind of fitting, don't you think?
astor, cody, come on, let's eat.
how'd you get the door unlocked?
it was already open.
Oh, that's Odd.
Hello?
Dexter, hi.
um, look, I'm sorry to bother you, and I'm sure this is nothing, but I was just wondering if by chance you were at my house.
uh, well, no.
well, it's just that the door was open and you're the only other one with a key.
Rita, get out of the house. Call the police.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I can't leave you here.
I can't take you with me.
don't go anywhere!
Oh, hey, I'm sorry to drag you into this.
no, no, I'm glad you called.
the kids? - Next door.
the place is empty.
no sign of forcible entry.
I'm guessing you just forgot to lock the door.
if you need anything else
no, no. You're not leaving. - Sir?
someone was in this house.
I need you to stay here in the house until I tell you it's safe.
Really? I need to do those things.
I'm with Miami metro homicide.
I know you don't take orders from me, but if you'd like,
I could get lieutenant Laguerta on the phone.
or if you prefer to speak to captain Matthews, I could arrange that, as well.
Dexter, what's going on?
please, just stay here, okay?
it's one thing to fuck with me, another to fuck with my ex-girlfriend who hates me.
the Lila experiment is officially over.
give me Rita's key.
well, that's your fault, isn't it, Dexter?
you lied to me about working late, and I thought I might find you there.
do not ever go to Rita's house again. Do you understand?
do you understand?
is this the monster that you keep telling me about?
trust me, when you meet the monster, you'll know.
you called Jiminez.
Yeah, I suppose I did.
Why?
why would you try to have me killed?
you weren't going to get killed.
that's why I did it at the bowling alley, so all your police-officer friends would be there.
what were you thinking? Are you insane?
I was trying to bring us back together again!
you were pulling away, and...
remember at the hotel after you faced Jiminez?
that -- that's what I wanted!
to bring you back.
so you called him?
well, it worked, didn't it?
last night. You and I.
you fell asleep in my arms.
what?
you -- you are more dangerous than my addiction will ever be.
that's saying a lot.
stay away from Rita.
stay away from me.
or what?
or you will see the monster.
Jesus FUCKING CHRIST. YOU'RE THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
I REALLY HATE THAT NAME.
what's IT GONNA BE, MORGAN?!
kill ME NOW OR SET ME FREE!
James KNOWS THAT I BELIEVE IN HIM, SO IT WAS WORTH THE RISK.
to YOUR JOB? TO YOUR CAREER?
when YOU CARE ABOUT SOMEONE, YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
and YOUR CREDIBILITY WAS COMPROMISED
the SECOND YOU FAILED TO REPORT A PHONE CALL
from THE SUBJECT OF A GODDAMN FBI MANHUNT.
what REALLY PISSES ME OFF IS YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.
the KIDS HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH LATELY.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO FEEL
like THEY'VE BEEN ABANDONED BY EVERYONE THEY LOVE.
does THIS MEAN WE'RE DATING AGAIN?
I TRACK KILLERS. THAT'S WHAT I DO.
they TEND TO MOVE AROUND.
I KNOW THAT.
then I'M NOT SURE
what YOU THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN THE CASE ENDED.
I LIKE IT ROUGH.
yeah?
Jesus.
Dexter: I DON'T NEED DOAKES DEAD.
I JUST NEED HIS FINGERPRINTS TO COMPLETE MY FRAME JOB.
every SATURDAY, BEGINNING DIVE CLASSES PRACTICE UNDERWATER SKILLS BESIDE THIS DOCK.
tomorrow THEY'LL FIND A MORBID LITTLE SURPRISE.
I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE WAS ANYTHING UNUSUAL
about MY FATHER'S DEATH.
he KILLED HIMSELF, DEXTER.
the IDEA OF A CODE WAS ONE THING, BUT THE REALITY OF IT?
Hey, DAD.
Harry WALKED IN ON WHAT HE CREATED...
and HE COULDN'T LIVE WITH HIMSELF.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HARDENING ARTERIES SQUEEZED THE LIFE OUT OF MY FATHER, BUT IT WAS ME.
Harry GAZED INTO THE EYES OF HIS CREATION AND SAW EVIL, PURE AND SIMPLE.
my EVIL -- IT KILLED HIM.
Doakes: THAT SHIT ABOUT YOUR FATHER
if YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT...
about WHAT?
that MY LIFE IS ONE TRAGIC MISTAKE?
we've ALL FELT THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. I KNOW I HAVE.
did YOU HAPPEN TO BE STUFFING A HUMAN LEG
into A GARBAGE BAG AT THAT POINT?
if YOU WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE, MORGAN, NOW'S THE TIME.
all YOU GOT TO DO IS LET ME OUT OF HERE.
it's OVER, MAN.
it IS OVER WHEN I SAY IT IS!
there's THAT ANGER AGAIN.
you GOT TO LET THAT OUT, MAN.
careful, SERGEANT, YOU MIGHT GET YOUR WISH.
I'm FLYING WITHOUT A CODE HERE.
I CAN UNLEASH THE BEAST ANYTIME I WANT.
Morgan, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER.
but IT WOULD FEEL FUCKING GREAT.
but YOU WOULD HATE YOURSELF FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
all THE THINGS HARRY TAUGHT ME, EVERYTHING
it's BULLSHIT.
it's THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO LIVE.
turn YOURSELF IN.
rule NUMBER ONE
don't GET CAUGHT.
no, NO, MORGAN, YOU'RE SPINNING.
let ME HELP YOU.
it's ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU HURT SOMEONE ELSE.
and I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ME
I'm TALKING ABOUT YOUR SISTER OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND
or EVEN THOSE KIDS.
I WOULD NEVER
no, NOT ON PURPOSE, BUT YOU CAN'T CONTROL THAT SHIT
that's GROWING INSIDE OF YOU, MORGAN.
it's LIKE CANCER.
and IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, IT'S SPREADING.
end IT NOW.
take RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHO YOU ARE, MAN.
we'll GO TO THE STATION TOGETHER.
I'll HELP YOU.
Morgan, DON'T ANSWER THAT.
stay WITH ME, MAN.
fuck!
Yes, THIS IS DEXTER MORGAN.
Mr. Morgan, my name is Dr. Hill.
I work at Good Samaritan Hospital.
I'm calling on behalf of Lila Tournay.
how DID YOU GET THIS NUMBER?
you're listed as her emergency contact.
ms. Tournay was rushed into our E. R.
in RESPIRATORY ARREST.
could YOU COME TO THE HOSPITAL?
I'm TWO HOURS AWAY. CALL SOMEBODY ELSE.
Mr. Morgan, there's a legal complication.
what KIND OF COMPLICATION?
I can't discuss it over the phone.
you really need to be here.
where ARE YOU GOING, MORGAN?
don't WORRY, I'LL SEND THE FBI YOUR WAY SOON ENOUGH.
you're STILL GONNA TRY TO FRAME ME?
I'm KIND OF DOWN A PATH HERE.
you'll GET YOUR CHANCE TO TELL THEM I'M THE KILLER,
and THEY'LL IGNORE YOU LIKE BEFORE, AND I'LL
and YOU'LL BURN IN HELL？？？
something LIKE THAT.
he's GONE, DEX. [ SNIFFLES ]
dad's HEART FINALLY GAVE OUT.
Harry's HEART GAVE OUT WHEN HE SAW WHAT'S INSIDE ME.
he THOUGHT HE COULD TAME IT, GIVE IT A PURPOSE, HELP IT FIND A PLACE IN THE NATURAL ORDER.
guess HE WAS WRONG.
Mr. MORGAN? YEAH.
I NEED A SECOND ALONE WITH HIM, OKAY? THANKS.
Dr. HILL -- WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE
regarding YOUR GIRLFRIEND, MS. TOURNAY.
she's NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
Oh, I THOUGHT SHE SAID SHE WAS.
Yeah, SHE PROBABLY DID.
so, YOU'RE...
it's COMPLICATED.
look, WHY IS ANGEL HERE?
we FOUND ROHYPNOL, THE DATE-RAPE DRUG,
in LILA'S SYSTEM.
with HER BRUISING, THE WOUND TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD
we MAY BE LOOKING AT A CASE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.
no, NO, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
ms. TOURNAY HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT DID HAPPEN.
she's REQUESTED WE PERFORM A RAPE KIT.
I NEED TO TALK TO HER.
Dexter, YOU CAME TO SEE ME.
you're SO SWEET.
the DOCTORS THINK ANGEL RAPED YOU.
did HE? EVERYTHING'S A BIT FUZZY.
this IS DESPERATE.
it WON'T WORK.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'm JUST GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
this IS HOW YOU WIN ME BACK?
framing A GOOD MAN TO GET WHAT YOU WANT?
which IS PRECISELY WHAT I'M DOING TO DOAKES.
what's THE MATTER, DEXTER?
you LOOK SO SAD...LOST.
don't DO THIS.
I WON'T PRESS CHARGES AGAINST ANGEL.
I'll DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
if YOU PROMISE TO TAKE ME BACK.
why CAN'T YOU JUST LET ME GO?
because I'M YOUR REAL SOUL MATE.
not RITA.
me.
I SEE YOU.
inside.
I'm THE ONLY ONE.
look WHERE IT'S GOTTEN YOU.
you KNOW THAT I COULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT, RIGHT?
you DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING, ANGEL.
you WARNED ME ABOUT HER, BUT MY DICK WOULDN'T LISTEN.
I COULD LOSE EVERYTHING OVER THIS.
what WOULD I SAY TO MY LITTLE GIRL?
the DOCTOR SAID LILA HAS 72 HOURS TO PRESS CHARGES.
maybe SHE'LL COME TO HER SENSES.
I SHOULD GET HOME AND GRAB A FEW HOURS OF SLEEP.
let ME GET THIS.
no, BACK OFF. I GOT IT.
Oh, ANGEL.
if I GOT TO CHOOSE A PERSON
a REAL PERSON -- TO BE LIKE...
out OF ANYONE, IT'D BE YOU.
I'm NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT, THANKS, DEX.
see YOU IN THE MORNING.
Oh, AND, UH, I'D APPRECIATE IT
if YOU DIDN'T MENTION THIS TO ANYONE AT THE STATION.
of COURSE NOT.
Thanks.
how DID IT COME TO THIS?
I've ALWAYS GONE AFTER CRIMINALS.
now I HAVE THE FATE OF TWO COPS IN MY HANDS.
Doakes WAS RIGHT.
the CANCER IS SPREADING.
we're OUT OF YOGURT.
Lundy: ADD IT TO THE LIST.
we'll STOP BY THE STORE TONIGHT.
the STORE'S ON THE WAY TO WORK.
it's ALSO ON THE WAY HOME.
we're GONNA BE LATE.
Hey, WHO JOINED WHO IN THE SHOWER THIS MORNING?
how ABOUT, IN THE FUTURE,
I SET THE ALARM 10 MINUTES EARLIER?
make IT 20.
the FUTURE --" I'M LIKING THE SOUND OF THAT.
we're BEING ORDERED TO WORK.
fuck THAT. YOU'RE THE HEAD OF THE TASK FORCE.
you DO THE ORDERING.
who's D. D. ADAMS?
my BOSS.
mission ACCOMPLISHED.
the WEAPONS I TOSSED INTO THE OCEAN WERE FOUND AS PLANNED.
one MORE NAIL IN DOAKES' COFFIN.
all RIGHT, PEOPLE. LISTEN UP.
this IS FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR MAX ADAMS.
he JUST GOT IN FROM WASHINGTON.
he's GOING TO BE HELPING US OUT FOR A WHILE.
once AGAIN, I HAVE PLEDGED OUR FULL COOPERATION AND RESOURCES,
so LET'S MAKE HIM FEEL AT HOME.
the MURDER WEAPONS BEFORE YOU WERE RECOVERED YESTERDAY
by A BEGINNING SCUBA-DIVING CLASS.
the INSTRUCTOR CONTACTED THE FBI DIRECTLY,
which BROUGHT THEM TO MY ATTENTION.
fingerprint ANALYSIS TIES THEM TO ONE JAMES DOAKES.
this DOESN'T PROVE A GODDAMN THING.
not now, Maria.
why I WASN'T I BROUGHT IN ON THIS?
you JUST WERE, FRANK.
now, WE KNOW SERGEANT DOAKES HAS BEEN...
Lundy better watch his back.
...he's ABANDONED THE TOOLS OF THE TRADE,
that MEANS HE'S PROBABLY ON THE RUN.
this FOOTAGE WAS TAKEN FOUR DAYS AGO AT A MOBIL STATION
just OFF HIGHWAY 41, SOUTHEAST OF NAPLES.
ladies AND GENTLEMEN, SERGEANT JAMES DOAKES.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
$3. 49 FOR REGULAR?
so, WE HAVE LET OUR TARGET GET AWAY ONCE.
let's NOT DROP THE BALL AGAIN.
asshole.
Highway 41 RUNS THROUGH THE EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK.
it WON'T BE LONG NOW.
I CAN HANG THIS ON DOAKES AND THEN...
then WHAT?
years OF TRIALS AND APPEALS WITH HIM POINTING HIS FINGER AND CALLING ME KILLER?
for SUCH A NEAT MONSTER, I'M MAKING AN AWFULLY BIG MESS.
where DOES THIS PRICK ADAMS
get OFF TAKING SUCH CHEAP SHOTS AT LUNDY?
I HEARD THAT DOAKES WALKED OFF
in THE MIDDLE OF LUNDY'S QUESTIONING
and THAT LUNDY DIDN'T STOP HIM.
I MIGHT HAVE HEARD THAT WRONG.
nice HAIR, BORELLI.
I'm SURE THE JOHNS UP IN BOYS TOWN
are LOVING THAT DURAN DURAN LOOK.
what's THE MATTER?
you MEATHEADS LOSE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR?
your JOKE WASN'T FUNNY.
we HAVE A WARRANT FOR DETECTIVE BATISTA'S ARREST.
bullshit. FOR WHAT?
a WOMAN NAMED LILA TOURNAY
has FILED SEXUAL-ASSAULT CHARGES AGAINST HIM.
that FUCKING BITCH.
Debra, IT'S OKAY. I KNEW THIS WAS COMING.
it's NOT OKAY. CAPTAIN, LIEUTENANT!
put THOSE AWAY OR I WILL SHOVE THEM UP YOUR ASS!
LaGuerta: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
Borelli: WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO BRING DETECTIVE BATISTA UPSTAIRS.
I AM SURE THAT DETECTIVE BATISTA
will GO ALONG WITH YOU PEACEFULLY.
it's NOT YOUR FAULT.
I'll BE OKAY.
it ISN'T MY FAULT.
I WARNED ANGEL.
still, I HATE TO SEE HIM DISGRACED IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.
and LaGUERTA ABOUT TO LOSE HER FORMER PARTNER, HER FRIEND.
even LUNDY IS CAUGHT IN HURRICANE DEXTER'S PATH OF DESTRUCTION.
maybe THIS IS HOW EVIL WORKS.
destroying EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES...INCLUDING MY FATHER.
Hey.
you're NOT GONNA BELIEVE THE MORNING I'M HAVING.
I KNOW THE FEELING.
my car is stalled on Harper and 3rd.
think YOU CAN COME GET ME?
Yeah, HANG TIGHT. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
Thanks, Dex.
I'm THE HELPFUL HANDYMAN. HOW EVIL CAN I POSSIBLY BE?
I'm SPARING RITA AND DEB BY FRAMING DOAKES.
right?
Hey! HEY!
over HERE!
thank GOD.
I've BEEN HELD PRISONER IN A CABIN FOR TWO FUCKING DAYS.
fucking HELLHOLE.
no, NO. I DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE CABIN.
I NEED YOU TO GET MY ASS OUT OF HERE.
I'm A POLICE SERGEANT. MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.
POLICIA?
Si, SI. POLICIA.
VAMANOS.
I've GOT TO RUN UPSTAIRS.
there's A WHOLE BATISTA THING GOING ON.
lunch TODAY? DOUBTFUL.
I've GOT TO WRITE UP A STATUS REPORT
why'd THEY SEND THAT DIPSHIT?
washington GETS NERVOUS WHEN THERE'S NO MOVEMENT ON A CASE,
especially ONE AS BIG AS THIS.
no MOVEMENT?
you're THE REASON THEY FOUND THE BLOOD SLIDES IN DOAKES' CAR.
I'm ALSO THE ONE WHO LET HIM GET AWAY.
we ALL LET HIM GET AWAY.
I WAS IN CHARGE.
the EVIDENCE WAS THERE,
but SOMETHING INSIDE ME WASN'T CONVINCED HE WAS OUR GUY,
so I LET HIM WALK.
it WAS A BAD CALL.
now WE MIGHT NEVER
stop IT.
stop WHAT?
acting LIKE ME.
you're A GOD.
don't YOU FORGET IT.
RITA: SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
carburetor.
transmission.
that ROUND, BLACK HOSE THING.
[ sighs ] I'M MORE A BOAT GUY.
the LAST THING I NEED RIGHT NOW IS A MAJOR REPAIR BILL.
throw IN A TOW AND RENTAL CAR,
there GOES ASTOR'S PIANO LESSONS.
here, TAKE THE MINI-VAN.
no, I CAN'T. IT'S TOO BIG OF AN INCONVENIENCE.
you CAN DROP ME OFF BACK AT WORK.
I'll BORROW SOMETHING FROM THE MOTOR POOL.
I'll MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
dinner?
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
pack A LUNCH, BRING THE KIDS,
let ME TAKE YOU OUT ON THE OCEAN TOMORROW.
the KIDS HAVE SCHOOL TOMORROW.
think OF IT AS A FIELD TRIP.
[ Chuckles ] YOU DON'T KNOW CODY'S TEACHER.
it's JUST ONE DAY -- JUST ONE MORE DAY.
is EVERYTHING OKAY, DEXTER?
look, AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH LATELY,
I JUST WANT TO BE TOGETHER WITH YOU GUYS.
is THAT SELFISH?
no.
no, IT'S LOVELY.
sergeant DOAKES CAN REJOICE.
I COME BEARING REAL FOOD.
shit.
Hey, VAMANOS.
no, NO, NO. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ]
suck MY DICK, MOTHERFUCKER. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SHIT? HUH?
friends OF YOURS?
from WHAT I CAN TELL,
they're FRIENDS OF THAT DRUG DEALER.
they WOULD'VE KILLED ME
Thanks, MORGAN.
well, THIS IS AWKWARD.
I THINK WE MADE SOME ALLIGATORS VERY HAPPY.
so, HERE WE ARE.
back TO FUCKING SQUARE ONE.
not EXACTLY.
I'll TELL YOU WHAT, JAMES.
can I CALL YOU JAMES?
knock YOURSELF OUT.
I'm TOYING WITH AN IDEA.
I've BEEN UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION FOR TWO MONTHS.
my TROPHIES WERE STOLEN.
sorry.
the CODE I LIVE BY HAS BEEN SHATTERED.
and I HAVE A CO-WORKER IN A CAGE.
things AREN'T GOING SO WELL.
no SHIT. I CAN SEE THAT.
you TOLD ME, "TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT I AM.
you WERE RIGHT.
Harry KILLED THE WRONG PERSON.
Morgan, YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT
kill MYSELF? NO, THAT'S PATHETIC.
but I CAN'T LIVE IN THIS HOUSE OF CARDS ANYMORE,
waiting FOR IT ALL TO FALL DOWN.
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?
I'm THINKING ABOUT TURNING MYSELF IN.
that's A -- THAT'S A GOOD CALL, MORGAN.
that's A TOUGH CALL,
but... THAT'S A GOOD CALL, MAN.
I NEED SOME FUCKING RELIEF.
Yeah, YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING, MAN.
that's FOR PUSSIES.
you're JUST GONNA END UP IN EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION
sooner OR LATER.
prison.
I COULD FINALLY GET SOME SLEEP.
Yeah.
in THE LONG RUN WOULD BE EASIER ON DEB...
better THAN WATCHING ME DRAGGED IN LIKE AN ANIMAL...
which, LET'S FACE IT, WILL HAPPEN, SOMEDAY.
Yeah.
Morgan, WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.
I'll GO WITH YOU.
come ON, LET'S GO.
if I DO THIS, I NEED A DAY TO GET MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER.
that's FINE. TIE ME UP, THROW ME IN THE TRUNK. COME ON, LET'S GO.
I BROUGHT SUPPLIES. FRESH FRUIT.
make SURE YOU MENTION THAT
when THEY INTERVIEW YOU FOR THE STORY OF MY LIFE.
God DAMN IT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE ME IN THIS CAGE -- ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.
come on WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE WORST OF THAT.
I've REALLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATIONS, JAMES.
I LIE TO EVERYONE I KNOW...
except MY VICTIMS RIGHT BEFORE I KILL THEM.
it's HARD TO ESTABLISH MUCH OF A RAPPORT THERE.
sorry ABOUT THE CAGE.
fuck.
what?
Hey, DEB. IT'S ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?
I'm ABOUT TO GET OFF OF WORK, WHY?
I've GOT SOME PAPERS I NEED YOU TO SIGN.
papers? WHAT KIND OF PAPERS?
I'll EXPLAIN WHEN I SEE YOU.
well, I'm meeting Masuka and Batista for drinks.
why don't you bring the papers and join us?
how's ANGEL DOING?
how DO YOU THINK HE'S DOING?
you KNOW, IT'S YOUR FAULT HE'S IN THIS MESS.
if YOU HADN'T FUCKED ELVIRA.
I'm NOT THE BEST BROTHER, AM I?
Dexter, ARE YOU SMOKING SOMETHING?
no.
I've ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS TO TRY.
do YOU HAVE ANY WEED?
okay, NOW I'M REALLY WORRIED.
there's NO NEED TO WORRY.
I'll BRING BY THE PAPERS TOMORROW.
Bye, Deb.
it's STRANGE.
this SHOULD BE DIFFICULT, BUT A SENSE OF PEACE IS SETTLING OVER ME.
calm.
maybe IT'S THE MOONLIGHT.
can I MEET YOU OUTSIDE?
Oh, SURE.
I'll CHECK IN BACK HOME.
I NEED A PERSONAL DAY.
I HOPE THIS IS A JOKE.
just ONE DAY.
I THINK I CAN PROVE THAT JAMES IS INNOCENT.
I WAS TALKING TO A COUPLE OF THE FBI AGENTS
who WERE DOWN IN HAITI
Jesus CHRIST, MARIA.
we ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MANHUNT.
you're DOWN TWO DETECTIVES, AND NOW YOU WANT TIME OFF?
the ANSWER IS NO.
this DEPARTMENT CAN'T SPARE YOU RIGHT NOW.
this WASN'T A REQUEST, TOM.
I WON'T BE HERE TOMORROW.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.
Mmm.
Diablo. WHAT IS THIS SHIT, MASUKA?
Hey, TEQUILA'S ALL THE SAME.
not WHEN IT'S MADE FROM PUMPKINS.
Hey, WE'RE NOT ALL IN THE SAME PAY GRADE.
if I LOSE MY JOB OVER THIS, BRO, I WON'T HAVE A PAY GRADE.
that IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
everyone AT THE STATION KNOWS YOU'RE INNOCENT.
how AM I GONNA PROVE IT?
hmm? I CAN'T EXPLAIN THE ROOFIES, THE ROUGH SEX.
there WAS ROUGH SEX? IT WAS HER IDEA.
now IT'S MY WORD AGAINST HERS. I'M SCREWED.
angel, YOU HAVE GOT TO FIGHT BACK.
dude, MORGAN'S RIGHT.
you GOT TO MAN UP, GET TOUGH. LOVE'S A BATTLEFIELD.
or, IN YOUR CASE, A RESTRAINING ORDER.
look, I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS DOING THIS,
but YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY.
Hey, DOES IT EVER FLOOR YOU GUYS
that WE HAD A KILLER RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES THIS WHOLE TIME?
I MEAN, WHO DOESN'T SEE THAT SHIT?
that DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.
it's ALL RIGHT.
that STUFF DOESN'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE.
next ROUND'S ON ME.
I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU'D SHOW UP.
we NEED TO TALK.
sounds GOOD TO ME.
I'm MAKING COFFEE. DO YOU WANT ONE?
I'm HERE TO ASK YOU RESPECTFULLY
to DROP THE CHARGES AGAINST ANGEL.
Dexter, IF ANGEL MOLESTED ME,
as THE EVIDENCE SEEMS TO INDICATE,
then HE SHOULD FACE THE CONSEQUENCES,
don't YOU THINK?
it DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK.
but HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.
after TOMORROW, I WON'T BE AROUND ANYMORE,
so THERE'S NO END GAME IN THIS FOR YOU.
you're GOING SOMEWHERE?
it's LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKELY.
where?
all THAT MATTERS IS THAT I'LL BE OUT OF REACH PERMANENTLY.
Oh, COME ON, DEXTER!
tell ME. I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.
you're THE ONE WHO TAUGHT ME ABOUT ACCEPTING THE THINGS YOU CAN'T CHANGE.
this IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
goodbye, LILA.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MEN CAN BE SO STUPID.
well, NOT ALL MEN.
Yes, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.
I MEAN, HOW COULD DEXTER AND BATISTA
be SO EASILY DUPED BY LILA?
I TOOK ONE LOOK AT HER
I KNEW SHE WAS A WALKING NIGHTMARE.
that's NOT STUPIDITY.
it's SIMPLY IN OUR DNA.
when A PRETTY GIRL SMILES AND BATS HER EYELASHES,
we're POWERLESS TO RESIST.
I'm WORRIED ABOUT BATISTA.
this IS SO FUCKED.
there's NO WAY I'M GONNA LET HIM TAKE THE FALL FOR THIS.
what CAN YOU DO?
well... SPECIAL AGENT LUNDY,
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT ACCESS
those GREAT, BIG FBI FILES OF YOURS
and DO A SEARCH ON MISS LILA TOURNAY.
you SEE? POWERLESS TO RESIST.
is ADAMS GONNA BE PISSED OFF
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
she HAS NO WARRANTS.
no CRIMINAL RECORD.
nothing WITH THE DMV.
and NO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.
what ABOUT VISAS OR GREEN CARDS OR WHATEVER?
nothing. NO RECORDS.
that's IMPOSSIBLE. EVERYONE HAS A PAPER TRAIL.
everyone REAL.
that SNEAKY BITCH. SHE'S USING AN ALIAS.
that WOULD BE MY GUESS.
well, HOW DO I FIND OUT LILA'S REAL NAME?
I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
cut OFF HER HEAD, LOOK FOR A LABEL.
there's PROBABLY AN EASIER WAY.
you GOT SOMETHING SMALLER?
the LAST TIME LILA WAS IN MY APARTMENT,
she MICROWAVED SOME POPCORN.
there's DEFINITELY GONNA BE PRINTS ON THIS.
all RIGHT, GOT IT.
next TIME, MAKE HER A CUP OF TEA.
this IS MARLENE FROM ACCOUNTING.
Hi, MARLENE FROM ACCOUNTING.
she's ALSO A NOTARY PUBLIC.
good FOR YOU.
I MET WITH A LAWYER YESTERDAY,
and HE HELPED ME PREPARE A LIVING TRUST
that GIVES YOU CONTROL OFF ALL MY ASSETS
Oh, GOD. GO AWAY. THIS IS CREEPY.
my FINANCIAL PLANNER SAID A GUY MY AGE SHOULD HAVE A WILL.
it's JUST A PRECAUTION.
we're ALL GOING TO DIE EVENTUALLY.
okay. YEAH.
is THIS WHY YOU WERE ACTING SO WEIRD LAST NIGHT?
Yeah, PROBABLY.
sign HERE AND HERE, AND I'LL NEED TO SEE AN I. D.
fine.
thanks FOR SHOWING UP LAST NIGHT TO SUPPORT BATISTA.
I AM SUPPORTING BATISTA.
I STOPPED BY LILA'S THIS MORNING.
And?
and I TALKED TO HER.
I DON'T THINK SHE'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM.
Yeah, 'CAUSE SHE CERTAINLY HASN'T BEEN ONE SO FAR.
Hey, I'M FREE TONIGHT.
you WANT TO STOP BY, I'LL PICK UP SOME BEERS,
throw ON A COUPLE OF STEAKS?
there's SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
sure. SOUNDS GOOD.
so, WHAT AM I GETTING?
I COULD USE A NEW TV.
port-au-prince. Haiti
okay. BUT THAT'S THE ONE.
Lundy here.
Oh, SPECIAL AGENT LUNDY.
it's LIEUTENANT LaGUERTA. I'M CALLING YOU FROM HAITI.
lovely THIS TIME OF YEAR.
I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M NOT YOUR FAVORITE PERSON
how so?
I JUST MET WITH LEONES,
the TRAVEL AGENT THAT DOAKES SAW.
there's NOTHING NEW THERE.
I HAD TWO AGENTS QUESTION HIM FOR HOURS.
yet HE NEVER TOLD THEM ABOUT THE BLOOD SLIDES.
what does he know about the blood slides?
Doakes was looking for a lab to have them analyzed.
Why?
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
if he's our killer, he'd be keeping them for trophies.
he'd HAVE NO REASON TO HAVE THEM ANALYZED.
and I ALSO HAVE A LIST OF SPECIAL-OPS MISSIONS
that LEONES PERSONALLY KNOWS DOAKES TOOK PART IN.
now, TWO OF THEM DIRECTLY CONFLICT WITH MURDERS
we KNOW TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
I'm NOT SURE LEONES IS OUR MOST RELIABLE WITNESS.
no, but it's worth looking into, isn't it?
Yes. YES, IT IS.
Yes! OKAY.
for STARTERS, WHY DON'T YOU BRIEF ME ON BOTH THOSE MISSIONS?
give ME ALL THE DETAILS.
come ON, CODY. UP AND OVER.
okay. GREAT.
okay, ASTOR. UP AND OVER.
there WE GO.
watch YOUR STEP.
look, THERE'S A PELICAN.
what's THAT?
welcome TO THE GPS 3000 TELETRACKER.
previous DESTINATIONS.
for SO LONG MY BOAT HAS BEEN A TOOL OF MY DARK TRADE
a GRAVEYARD TRANSPORT.
I'd ALMOST FORGOTTEN IT COULD DOUBLE AS A PLEASURE CRAFT.
now, THE THING IS, IF YOU CATCH A WHALE,
we're PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO PUT IT BACK.
if IT'S A BABY, WE COULD PUT IT IN THE BATHTUB.
I'm NOT GONNA TAKE A BATH WITH A WHALE.
I KNOW, THEY ALWAYS USE UP ALL THE SOAP.
it's PEACEFUL OUT HERE.
Rita, I'VE NEVER BEEN A VERY GOOD BOYFRIEND.
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
I JUST NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU AND THE KIDS
are VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
no MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I WANT YOU TO ALWAYS KNOW THAT.
okay, DEXTER.
Hey, EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.
okay?
I JUST -- I JUST NEED TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.
Oh, I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.
Dexter, YOU DON'T NEED TO BRING ME GIFTS.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.
it's THE PINK SLIP TO THE MINI-VAN.
Dexter, I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
you DON'T
please, I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT FOR THE KIDS.
it'll KEEP THEM SAFER THAN A BROKEN-DOWN CONVERTIBLE.
thank YOU.
very GENEROUS.
you're WELCOME.
I KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING THINGS SLOW WITH US,
but IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.
it's MORE LIKE I HAVE TOO MANY FEELINGS,
and I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE TO GET IT RIGHT.
me TOO.
that's NOT EXACTLY TAKING IT SLOW.
sorry. I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.
well, DON'T SAY NEVER.
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR YOU.
the BOYS LOOKED AT LILA'S PRINTS.
we HIT THE JACKPOT.
Oh?
turns OUT HER REAL NAME IS LILA WEST.
I RAN HER PRINTS THROUGH THE AFIS,
which IS TIED TO I. C.E.
get THIS -- HER VISA EXPIRED TWO YEARS AGO.
bad GIRL.
I CAN HAVE HER DEPORTED.
not AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.
Miami IS SWAMPED WITH CRIMINAL IMMIGRANTS,
refugees FROM THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES.
they'll TAKE PRIORITY OVER SOME BRITISH GIRL.
then I'LL DEPORT HER MYSELF.
we GOT HIM.
talked TO A PARK-SERVICE MANAGER IN THE EVERGLADES
who REMEMBERS GIVING SERGEANT DOAKES DIRECTIONS FIVE DAYS AGO.
so YOU HAVE A TIP -- NOT DOAKES.
the PARK MANAGER SAID OUR TARGET WAS HEADED INTO THE EVERGLADES 15 MILES NORTH OF SUNDAY BAY.
we WILL HAVE THE SON OF A BITCH IN HANDCUFFS IN 24 HOURS.
I'd LIKE TO URGE STRONG CAUTION IN APPREHENDING THE SUSPECT.
I'm LOOKING INTO NEW INFORMATION THAT MIGHT COME INTO PLAY
Yeah, I GOT YOUR E-MAIL ABOUT LEONES.
the MAN WILL SAY ANYTHING FOR A DOLLAR.
I AGREE WE HAVE TO BE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT THIS,
which IS EXACTLY WHY I'D LIKE SOME TIME.
show A LITTLE GUTS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.
why DON'T YOU SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT?
you WOULDN'T BE CLOSING IN ON A SUSPECT RIGHT NOW
you KNOW, AS MUCH AS I ENJOY HEARING FROM THE LOCAL TALENT,
I'm REALLY RATHER BUSY RIGHT NOW.
well, I'M GUESSING YOU DON'T NEED ME
to FIGHT YOUR BATTLES ANYMORE.
Yeah, WELL, MAYBE YOU NEED ME TO FIGHT YOURS.
Ooh. AREN'T YOU A TOUGH ONE?
I'm JUST WARMING UP.
Wow. I THOUGHT I LIVED IN A SHIT CAN.
officer MORGAN, HAVE YOU COME TO INQUIRE ABOUT MY WELFARE?
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE MIAMI TONIGHT.
don't EVER COME BACK.
don't EVER CONTACT ANGEL OR DEXTER AGAIN.
and, UM, WHY WOULD I LISTEN TO YOU?
cause I'M A COP.
and YOU'RE HERE ON AN EXPIRED VISA.
I KNOW YOUR REAL NAME,
and I'VE CONTACTED IMMIGRATION.
officers WILL BE HERE ANY DAY NOW.
they'll ARREST YOU AND DEPORT YOU,
and IT WILL NOT BE PRETTY.
if THIS IS TRUE,
why ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
because I WANT YOU THE FUCK OUT OF HERE NOW.
whether YOU LEAVE ON YOUR OWN
or IMMIGRATION HAULS YOUR SORRY ASS AWAY,
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
but I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE MORE DAY
to FUCK WITH THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT.
I WANT YOU GONE.
tonight.
you DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
it's DONE.
tonight.
welcome. PREVIOUS DESTINATION.
starting ROUTE GUIDANCE.
left TURN AHEAD.
I KEEP EXPECTING TO COME TO MY SENSES,
but THE PRESSURE IS LIFTING WITH EACH STEP I TAKE.
I've SPENT A LIFETIME KEEPING UP MY GUARD, WATCHING MY BACK, WEARING MY MASK.
relief WAS NEVER IN SIGHT UNTIL NOW.
if ANYONE DESERVES TO TAKE ME INTO CUSTODY, IT'S DEB.
but HOW DO I TELL HER WHAT I AM?
Deb, I'M THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
Deb, I'M THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
on THE GROUND.
down ON THE GROUND, MOTHERFUCKER.
it's ME. I'M THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
no, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'm HIM -- THE BUTCHER.
this ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY.
I BROUGHT EXTRA BEER. WE'RE GETTING DRUNK.
fine WITH ME.
what's THE OCCASION?
I RAN LILA OUT OF TOWN TODAY.
Really? YEAH.
turns OUT SHE'S HERE ILLEGALLY.
you SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME, DEX.
I WAS LIKE AN OLD-WEST SHERIFF.
you're REALLY FEELING GOOD.
fuck, YEAH.
I GOT TO SAY, GREAT TIMING, DEX,
getting TOGETHER TONIGHT.
the LAST FEW MONTHS, I WAS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
I HAD MY HEAD PRETTY FAR UP MY ASS.
no ONE BLAMES YOU.
your WORLD WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.
like MINE IS NOW.
for THE FIRST TIME SINCE THAT ICE-TRUCK KILLER SHIT,
I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK.
new AND IMPROVED, EVEN.
when ALL THAT STUFF WAS HAPPENING
with RUDY, I MEAN...
...did YOU EVER CONSIDER DOING SOMETHING DRASTIC?
are YOU KIDDING?
all KINDS OF FUCKED-UP SHIT RAN THROUGH MY HEAD.
thank GOD I HAD YOU.
Really?
Yeah.
every TIME I STARTED TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL,
I HAD YOU TO GRAB ONTO.
hell, YOU LET ME LIVE HERE PRACTICALLY FOREVER.
it WAS TOUGH, THOUGH.
I'd HAVE DONE ALMOST ANYTHING
to GET OUT FROM UNDER THE WEIGHT OF IT ALL.
how'd YOU FINALLY DO IT?
I JUST -- JUST SAW THROUGH IT.
you KNOW?
you DECIDE WHO YOU ARE, WHO YOU WANT TO BE...
...and YOU HOLD ONTO THAT AND RIDE IT OUT.
like AN OLD-WEST SHERIFF.
brother, THIS IS WORTH LIVING FOR.
right?
you ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Hey, WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT, ANYWAY?
OH...NOTHING.
nothing AT ALL.
so, THIS IS ME, RIDING IT OUT.
Harry MAY HAVE REJECTED ME, BUT DEB CLEARLY BELIEVES IN ME,
so WHY SHOULDN'T I?
I'm NOT TURNING MYSELF IN.
this ISN'T HARRY'S LIFE.
it's MINE.
I MADE A PLAN TO FRAME DOAKES, AND I'M GOING TO STICK WITH IT.
no SHIT?
okay. OKAY, I'M ON THE WAY.
they FOUND DOAKES' FUCKING RENTAL CAR.
they FOUND -- REALLY?
his CAR?
did THEY FIND DOAKES?
no, NOT YET. BUT THE SEARCH GRID'S CLOSING IN.
come ON, WE GOT TO GET TO THE STATION.
actually I GOT TO MAKE SURE
they DON'T FIND DOAKES IN A CAGE.
Hallelujah.
Hey!
Hey, I'M IN HERE!
who's OUT THERE?! ANYBODY OUT THERE?!
ending ROUTE GUIDANCE.
Hello?
somebody IN THERE?
you HAVE ARRIVED AT YOUR DESTINATION.
I can honestly say I know who miguel prado really is.
my first good friend.
we need to go after the root cause.
blood-sucking, soulless defense attorney ellen wolf!
walk in the park to discredit you, counselor. - Try it.
Oh, I'm not the one on trial.
Oh, you should be. - You should be!
this is personal.
fuck yes, this is personal.
and it should be personal for you too.
as my friend. I'm asking you to do this for me.
sorry, no. - Well, then fuck you!
Miguel went missing last night.
Ellen's missing this morning.
I hope she didn't get in an accident or something.
he did it.
Miguel really did it.
wow, I didn't get it before, miguel, but you can't be reasoned with, guilted, controlled.
this whole back and forth game for leverage is pointless.
that's right!
I'll do what I want when I want to whomever I want.
count on it!
Yes, we will marry you.
you should be my best man. - What?
I trust you more than anyone.
why are you running your mouth about family business to a god damn stranger.
Dexter is not the problem here.
better keep your fucking hands off of me, pendejo!
Ellen wolf's ring.
Ellen wolf was threatening to wreck his career.
he has a black suv and no alibi for the night she died.
you think miguel had something to do with her murder?
I found this sample in the back of his car.
LaGuerta's deciding, I'll be eliminating her problem.
and george king's going to help me.
I'll copy his M. O. They won't even look for another suspect.
I am this close to getting my shield, and I'm putting it all at risk to be with you!
then debra, why are you?
I need for you to seriously think about us.
you've had a bug up your ass about dad for months now.
he didn't cheat on mom.
bullshit. Who?
a C. I.
Laura moser. My mother.
I kinda need a favor.
that I'm here for. What do you need?
all the records you have on my dad's confidential informants.
Skinner. George king.
the nicaraguan embassy is still giving me the runaround.
until we know king's true identity, there's not much to go on.
you need to have a long conversation with dexter morgan.
you think I'm done with you?
you think this ends here?
it doesn't!
it does for you.
there are few milestones in life that evoke a stronger response than our final act.
death.
what was once moving, speaking, killing, and threatening becomes nothing but an empty vessel.
which is not so different from how I've always felt.
several patches of skin removed from the, uh-- the shoulder area.
ligature marks on the neck.
why the fuck would the skinner wanna kill miguel prado?
Miguel was after freebo.
king had to figure he knew something.
we all react in different ways to death.
some, like ramon, choose anger.
others cling to ritual.
Dex. I know he was your friend.
so if you wanna take a pass on this...
Nah, that's all right. I got it.
me, I'll play the grieving friend who buries himself in his work.
you can tell a lot about a person by the friends he keeps.
and this is my best friend.
good-bye, miguel.
don't fucking touch my brother.
let go of my arm.
now.
come here.
I am going to find out why this happened.
we all want the same thing, ramon.
that was awkward.
I don't think I've ever been asked to leave a funeral before.
Ramon didn't ask you to leave, he pushed you out the door.
Yeah, he was drunk.
I could smell the fumes.
he's just so angry.
he's lost two brothers. He doesn't know who to blame.
well, certainly not you.
no, certainly not me.
how you handling this?
Oh, you know, a lotta different emotions.
I know miguel wasn't the man you thought he was.
but you lost a friend.
you don't have to be so strong.
can't help it.
Oh, poor syl. She has so much to deal with.
I can only imagine.
she insists we go through with the wedding.
she still wants to come to the rehearsal dinner tomorrow night.
well... life goes on.
from your mother?
she's not coming down.
she started teaching again and can't miss class.
too bad.
that's my loving mother.
"let's hope the third one's the charm." What's that mean?
the kid.
the third kid is the charm.
Cody and astor are charms too.
like I said, that's my loving mother.
did rita just lie to me?
so have you written your vows yet?
not completely.
what should I say?
well, you can talk about togetherness, loyalty, attraction, honesty.
honesty. Right.
you know, I should get home and keep working on them.
you should keep that.
he gave me so much.
darling rita, once you were a dream and a prayer.
now our future is as bright as the sun glinting off the morning dew.
and I vow that I will...
sounds like I'm marrying a unicorn.
scuse me, sir. You the occupant?
Yeah. - I'm detective pratt.
property manager called us. They found your door open.
Yeah, he called me too.
we're gonna need you to take a good look around and see what's missing.
it's kinda hard to tell.
your neighbor, a Ms. Levin, saw someone hanging around the mailboxes.
Latin, kinda burly, goatee.
ring any bells? - Ramon Prado.
no.
Thanks. Let me know if you find out anything.
you got it. - Thank you.
Miguel warned you that his death wasn't gonna be the end of things.
so his plan was to make me hire a housekeeper?
your suit for the wedding.
that's personal.
Ramon prado's like a gut-shot animal.
you know what to do with a wounded animal.
you put it out of its misery.
I can't kill him. He doesn't meet the code.
can't kill him. Can't ignore him.
I have no intention of ignoring him.
I can use the ring to tie miguel to ellen wolf's murder, threaten to destroy ramon's sainted brother's reputation forever.
that's enough to get ramon to back down.
how are you?
honestly, not so great.
I'm sorry, is--is ramon in?
no. He didn't come home with us from the funeral.
doesn't answer his cell.
he's been on a bender, dexter; I have no idea where he is.
I'm really worried about him.
if you hear from him, will you let him know I stopped by?
Ramon's blood family doesn't know where he is.
sheriff DEPUTIES PRADAO...
maybe his blood family does.
morning. Sheriff's department.
Yeah, could you put me through to sergeant jessie whitaker, please?
one moment, please.
Gail brandon. Future mother-in-law.
while I'm waiting, I may as well check into my new partner.
sergeant whitaker's in the field.
would you like to leave a message?
uh, this is sort of important. I'm with miami metro homicide.
you think you can track him down?
please hold.
before she left michigan, rita bennet would have been rita... brandon.
paul bennet wasn't her first husband.
she was married before, at 16.
ending in divorce six months later.
an impetuous teen marriage.
which makes me her third husband.
the charm.
the brass is giving us a blank check as far as overtime is concerned until this man is in custody.
jorge orozco. A.K. A.George king.
affectionately known back home as el fierro: The blade.
orozco was a captain in the resistencia nicaraguense.
the contras. He headed an interrogation unit.
he tortured people for a living.
and killed 'em.
now this already was a big case.
with miguel prado's murder, it's officially huge.
this is whitaker.
Hi, my name is dexter morgan.
I'm trying to track down your old partner ramon prado.
Why?
I'm a family friend.
Sara told me he's been missing since his brother's funeral.
I figured with his problem and all...
gotcha.
actually, I haven't seen him since he left.
I know a few places he used to hang out at.
I mean, basically any bar within a ten-mile radius.
I can give you a few of his favorites, if you like.
I'm sure sara would appreciate that.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'd love to help them with george king, but I've got a more pressing situation to deal with: Miguel's wounded messenger.
Morgan... a minute?
sure, sarge.
so it took a couple of months and a lot of wrangling, but my budget request finally came through.
homicide is gonna get a little extra money.
Oh, that's great.
we should get one of those crime-sight imagers.
have you seen 'em? Their pictures are amazing.
Really? I mean, that's what you'd spend it on?
cause I was thinking maybe we'd spend it on adding another detective to our squad.
maybe somebody who saved the life of a C. I.
who id'd our skinner.
I don't know what to say, I mean, wow.
thank you.
I put in the recommendation to lieutenant laguerta.
she's just gotta sign the paperwork.
Oh, fuck. Thank you, thank you.
we could use a little joy around here. Good work.
thank you.
I got it.
I'm guessing "it" is something good?
my detective shield.
Oh, big news.
it's gigantic news.
all laguerta has to do is sign the papers and I'm golden.
well, I'm silver.
we should celebrate. - Yeah, come on.
I mean later. I gotta pick up the kids, go to the tailor's...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
you know, dad would be proud.
that still means something, no matter how flawed he was.
Yeah, look at us.
you're getting married. I'm making detective.
the morgans are gonna be all right.
I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.
okay.
yo, francis.
any progress on my dad's C. I.Files?
Ooh, he knew a lot of folks, I'll give him that.
anyone of interest?
I haven't culled through everything yet.
are you sure you want me to?
some things are better left in a box.
I just-- I need to put a face on her.
knowing all the details isn't gonna change the fact that he was messing around on the sly.
I know.
I'll send 'em up as soon as I can.
thank you, francis.
Dexter. I need a word.
city council has voted to name the freeway interchange near my house after miguel prado.
I drive that way every single day.
he was a hero. To some.
he was a cold-blooded killer.
he murdered my friend, and now he's got an interchange?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
you're the only other person who knows the truth.
maybe it's time we let others in on the secret.
there is nothing to link miguel to ellen wolf's murder except evidence that was obtained illegally, and therefore inadmissible.
I'll find something. I'll tear his life apart if I have to.
he doesn't have a life anymore.
it's his family you'd have to tear apart.
the community. The cuban community.
and you still might not be able to prove anything.
so I just keep it a secret.
I hate secrets.
we all have them.
well, then tell me, dexter.
how am I supposed to live with this?
you just do.
can I get an everything burrito and a side of beans, maybe a little bit of
you're here. - Yeah.
Yeah, I was just, um, picking up some things from evidence.
my wallet, watch, chapstick.
I could've brought that to you.
Oh, it's cool. It's cool, I got it.
so how you doing?
I'm all right. - Good.
Oh, but-- looks like I'm gonna get my detective shield.
Debra, wow, that's great. - Thank you.
Congratulations. That's good. That's good.
you wanna get some co--Okay. - I should probably go.
I'll see ya. - I'll see you.
I stopped at four bars, got a new appreciation for how many alcoholics there are in miami.
but still no ramon.
Morgan. - What's up?
I just found out from the A. D.A.'S office that they're requesting logs from the anton briggs surveillance detail.
now, I didn't know why until I read 'em.
you slept with our key witness?
the A. D.A'S looking into it?
Miguel prado was.
I don't know what the status of it is now.
but it's a conflict.
and you should have given me the heads up.
especially before I sent my recommendation to laguerta for your shield.
you're gonna spike it now?
LaGuerta has final say.
but she deserves full disclosure.
disclosure? Really, sarge?
did you disclose that you met gianna because you were out strolling for a hooker?
where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear that?
I know someone in vice.
I'm the only one that knows, I think.
it's not even that big of a deal.
fuck, fuck! I am sorry. I'm sorry.
it's just my chickens coming home to roost.
Oh, fuck. Fuck.
I met detective gianna while seeking the comfort of prostitutes.
"Scuse me?
I propositioned her.
she revealed to me to be police.
she had mercy on me; she let me off with a warning.
it was a dark time for me.
I completely understand if you wanna pursue a case against me.
as cases go, laying you out for thinking with your dick is pretty low on my list of priorities.
actually, I was looking for simple human connection.
no. Right. You're right.
we all have secrets we prefer not to share, angel. Skeletons.
feel free to keep yours in the closet.
deep in the closet. - Thanks, maria.
there's something else you should hear from me instead of the grapevine.
angel, how--how dark of a time was this?
it's regarding my recommendation of debra morgan for detective.
so, when you and mom get married, what should we call you?
um, I think mr. Handsome would be a good name.
is that you, ramon?
uh, you can call me whatever you want.
I think we'll just call you dexter.
that sounds good.
following me with kids in my car?
now you're just pissing me off.
moment of truth.
stop or get a ticket, asshole.
did you see that, dexter?
Yeah, that's what happens when drivers do stupid things.
looks like he's okay enough to walk away.
until I get a hold of him.
this is gonna be a nice dinner.
thank you for doing this, dexter.
just doing what grooms are supposed to do.
so how are you coming along with your vows?
still working on 'em.
I'm going to lob this in nice and easy.
what kind of vows did you do the first time around?
the first time?
well, paul and I just recited whatever the pastor said.
liar, liar, pants on fire.
maitre d' said we'd be seated in 15 minutes.
Ramon, why don't we go outside and talk about this.
fuck you. You don't tell me what to do.
look, these people have nothing to do with this.
this is between you and me, right?
I should put a bullet in your head.
in front of everybody.
so they can see what it's like to lose someone.
Ramon. Come on, you need to put the gun down before anyone gets hurt.
freeze, asshole.
get your hands off of me!
I will, as soon as I get some of your sheriff buddies down here!
thank you.
they all say the same thing.
king was a very polite gardener. I can't believe he's the skinner.
I hate polite killers.
I heard you took down ramon prado last night. Again.
Yeah, the prados must love me.
you gonna eat that?
not anymore, thanks.
that was robbery.
there was a hit-and-run fender bender involving a stolen car.
traffic enforcement caught the guy's face. Guess who.
they're sending a photo over right now.
george fucking King.
God, that's definitely him.
robbery's sending the car in right now.
I'll grab my kit. We'll tear that car apart.
by the book, Mr. Morgan.
if you need us, we're right outside, lieutenant.
Thanks.
how's it feel, ramon? - How the fuck does what feel?
wake up sober for the first time in a week.
like shit.
Yeah, that shit's called reality.
it's gonna be life as you know it for a long time.
I'm gonna be outta here in a couple of days.
one last coupon from your famous brother's reputation.
something like that.
so you don't really have to bother with reality. That must be nice.
you know what my fucking reality is?
Miguel takes me on as a bodyguard, and I ask him why.
you know what he says?
to protect him from you.
did he say why? - No.
the only one miguel needed protection from was himself.
the man was paranoid. - That's not true.
that's true. You know it as well as I do.
look, I spent a lot of time with your brother, but it wasn't 24/7;
I don't know what he was up to when I wasn't around.
neither does syl, neither do you.
what I do know is this:
you got a really ugly history. Kidnapping, brutality, abuse.
you trashed my apartment, you followed me.
you put a gun in my face in front of my friends, in front of my pregnant fiancee.
why, ramon? What's your endgame?
to hurt you.
until you came into our life, everything was fine.
fine like what? Like oscar's drug problem?
like miguel's... darkness?
what do you know about that?
we were close. Miguel and I.
he told me things.
he told me how he pushed your father down the stairs to protect oscar and you.
and that he enjoyed it.
he fucking told you that?
it was me that did that to our father.
Miguel took it from me; made it his story.
part of his god damn legend.
Miguel always had to be the star.
he got the looks, the charm, maybe even the brains, but I got the strength.
I spent my whole life trying to hold it together, and now it's all gone to shit.
it doesn't have to. - Bullshit.
those cases you're talking about, the kidnapping, the brutality...that was me sweeping up after miguel's fuck-ups.
he wasn't making my problems go away, I was risking my ass to cover his.
I know the frustration, the disappointment, of wanting to help your brother and not being able to.
Where's your son right now?
soccer practice.
your daughter?
preschool.
where do they think their father is?
Sara told them something. I--I don't know.
someday your kids will be old enough to see the truth for themselves.
just like you did with your father.
I know. I've been there.
the sins of the father go on and on, from kid to kid to kid.
unless someone--you chooses to end them.
I've been there too.
you don't always have to destroy a wounded animal.
sometimes you just remove the thorn.
those dark lines...reticulated veins.
Oh, holy shit, it is skin.
no, more like...more like leaf.
so the only evidence we got from the car that skinner stole is a friggin' leaf?
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Yup. Tobacco leaf.
tobacco? Fuckin'-a, wasn't there aking's, uh, former employer, what was the name?
thank you, vince. You're welcome.
cigar company. What was it called?
el royale cigar company.
it's listed on the first tax form filled out by king in 1992.
come on, let's go.
what do you think? - It's great.
thanks for doing this so fast, bruno.
happy to help. Now, you do that. - Okay.
and I'll get your shoes. - All right.
remember what I taught you.
how could I forget?
mom's funeral.
the rabbit... hops over the log.
your mother would be so proud.
both of them.
the rabbit crawls under the log.
the rabbit runs around the log...
one more time, because he's trying to outsmart the fox.
the rabbit dives through his rabbit hole.
safe and sound.
safe and sound.
safe and sound.
what's this? - All we got out of searching the cigar factory.
total waste of time. - No sign of king?
the security guard's there 'round the clock.
no way king gets in or out.
tomorrow is my wedding day.
some men would be excited.
others panicky. Me?
I feel... calm.
what are you doing here on a saturday?
I'm just, uh, reanalyzing some of the evidence from king's stolen car.
det. Harry Morgan C. I.S
Francis, you came through.
Morgan. Glad you're here. I wanna talk to you.
Oh, shit. I didn't know she was here.
did I say anything bad about her?
you're not the one she's gonna ream.
sit.
that's okay.
it seems the A. D.A. has noticed that your personal and professional lives are colliding.
all right. Listen, Anton wasn't officially a C. I. when that happened.
so it was a one-time thing?
no. - Still going on?
I'm not sure.
do you want it to?
I don't know. He could be a key witness in my case.
doesn't have to be your case.
you know what. You go ahead.
you take away my case, you take away my shield.
I don't care anymore.
because it wasn't the wrong decision.
I wanted to be with anton.
I still want to be with anton.
and there is no possible way that us being together is a mistake.
which means you're not sacrificing your personal life to work.
good for you.
congratulations, detective morgan.
what?
you're one of the smartest, hardest working, most annoying pain-in-the-ass cops in my department.
and you've earned this.
what about the A. D.A.'S ethics probe?
the A. D.A. is dead.
try one of these.
ganache frosting.
you hold onto that personal life.
Yeah.
reminds us what's important.
cupcakes.
such a familiar situation.
such an unfamiliar perspective.
so ramon wasn't the only one following me.
I underestimated miguel after all.
this is the part where my fear is supposed to build.
I know his M. O.By heart.
but you're not afraid.
no. I'm not.
I am.
I've been scared of it coming to this your whole life.
a violent end.
I tried to protect you.
and you did.
this is my fault for not trusting you.
instead I trusted miguel fucking prado.
you did the best you could.
I need you to understand something, dexter.
so did I.
the very best that I could.
I hope to be half as good a father to my son.
your son.
dad.
I forgive you.
I've never seen you cry before.
they're not my tears, dex. They're yours.
I know, but I've never...
I've never felt this.
you've never had a son before.
you want to see him come into the world.
Yes.
to raise him with rita. To watch him grow up.
to protect him. - I know.
I didn't.
until now, when it's all gonna be taken away.
I wanna be there for him.
I've never wanted anything so much in my life.
come in.
you're completely different from me.
you're laid-back, and musician-y, and... un-ambitious.
you're like valium.
and you're like red bull.
you are the best thing that has happened to me.
I'm still a witness in your case.
it's not my case.
I recused myself.
you gave up a case--this case?
I had a choice. I chose you.
your turn.
I've already chosen.
okay.
hold on. Hold on, I'll turn it off.
wait, just, uh-- what?
george king wasn't at that cigar factory.
fucking duh, but that's not my case anymore. Why?
well, I re-ran the tobacco that we got from george king's stolen car.
it turns out it's at least a dozen years old.
I called the cigar factory.
they only moved in there three years ago.
Where'd they move it?
I know that look.
I've had that look.
he likes control. Needs it.
so I'll take it away from him.
I killed freebo.
sorry 'bout that.
I tied him up. Not unlike this.
stabbed him in the left carotid artery.
used his 16-inch, carbon steel bone saw to separate his limbs.
I don't believe you.
divided them equally amongst six biodegradable trash bags.
which are long gone now, carried north on the gulf stream.
you're lying.
usually. Not now.
no point.
why would you have done such a thing?
Oh, I have my excuses and justifications, but, really, I just...need to. Like you.
you have your flimsy excuses: Finding freebo, getting your money.
but you know he's dead.
you know there's no money.
so really, you're just... a killer. A monster.
the stuff of nightmares.
I could kill you now.
if you can convince yourself I'm lying.
that you need to skin me to get information out of me.
you are lying.
you do know where he is.
Miguel prado tell you that?
he wanted me dead.
so he used you.
he played on your obsession.
it probably wasn't too hard. I mean, you're a little single-minded.
let's hope you're this talkative once I get my tools.
a wolf would chew off its own paw.
its survival instinct is that fierce.
so is mine.
fuck!
king's truck, 11: 00.
shit!
no way I could stop in time, ma'am.
he fuckin' came out of nowhere.
Jesus, officer. He scraped his fucking skin off.
Yeah, well, what goes around comes around.
and it's detective.
Dexter's here. He just pulled up.
Oh, finally.
nothing to be concerned about, but he kind of had a little accident.
what happened?
he took a tumble down some stairs. Broke his hand.
Oh, my god. - Rita, he's fine.
he can't wait to get married.
Dexter, your room is down the hall. You cannot be in here.
you look...
you can't see her 'til the wedding.
it's bad luck.
I think I got that one covered, sweetie.
Oh, baby, are you okay?
just embarrassed, more than anything.
sweetheart, why don't we go and do your makeup?
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
you're not angry? - Why would I be?
it's not like you broke your hand on purpose.
I'm just glad you're here. Safe.
me too.
all right, now go, go. - Okay. Be ready in a jiffy.
you really do look beautiful.
she wants to hold onto her secret.
and I'm going to respect that.
it seems only fair, given the secrets I keep from her.
we all have secrets.
in that way, I'm just like everyone else. Sorta.
heard about your little fall. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I heard you nabbed george king?
Yeah.
great, big, scary contra boogeyman gets surrounded and takes the chicken-shit way out.
death by cop.
I'm glad he's the only one who got hurt.
Yeah, me too. Yuck.
me in a dress. I feel like a transvestite.
come here.
rabbit goes under the log...hops over the log...again... then...through his hole.
safe and sound.
Thanks.
just remember, cody has your rings.
and don't lock your knees when you're standing up up there.
you'll drop like a god damn stone.
where are your vows? - Right here.
I'm so happy for you.
just wish dad could be here.
I have a feeling he is.
enough of this sappy shit.
let's get you fuckin' hitched.
I honor you. I love you.
I marry you.
I promise to be the very best husband and father that I can be.
a completely, utterly honest vow.
Dexter morgan: Family man.
all my previous attempts at human connection have ended in...well, death.
and now I have a partner for life.
how did that happen?
am I drawn to the safety of belonging, or being part of something bigger than me?
either way, I'm a married man.
soon to be a father.
but what do I have to offer a child?
just... me.
demented daddy dexter.
maybe I'm making the biggest mistake of my life.
but who's perfect? Certainly not me.
certainly not harry.
sure, I'm still who I was, who I am.
question is, what do I become?
there are so many blanks left to fill in.
but right now, at this moment, I'm content.
maybe even... happy.
and I have to admit, when all is said and done...life is good.
Rita's inside.
it was me.
FBI?
fucking bunch of idiots.
you want to talk to Dexter, schedule an appointment.
I'll do that.
if this were anyone but Dexter, we'd at least be thinking like detectives.
when the wife is dead, 90% of the time, the husband did it.
what are you doing?
you wanna talk about it, or you just gonna act weird?
there's nothing to talk about.
all Rita and I ever did was kiss.
Dexter found out about the indiscretion, and, uh, came over and punched me out.
Arthur Mitchell.
Kyle Butler.
and what's his name?
something happened to your mom.
she's dead!
and it doesn't even matter to you!
I wish you were dead!
I just got a call from the FBI.
about your brother's interview.
don't tell me. What'd he say?
he didn't show.
I don't know where the fuck you are or why you think you can fucking run away from the FBI, but you better get back here before...
my wife died, and it was my fault.
your dead wife can suck my dick.
that's the first human thing I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.
they're not better off without you.
you're not better off without them.
you need to go back.
it's said there are seven stages of grief.
I suppose killing someone with my bare hands in a men's room was my way of working through the anger stage.
whatever the other six stages are, I don't have time for them.
cause now I'm a full-time dad.
once the kids and I are back together, it'll all be fine.
I can't believe we're all gonna squish in here.
it's just temporary, till we can get a new place.
here...
he needs to be hosed off or something.
Hey.
welcome home.
this isn't our home.
and why do we need a new place, anyway?
I think starting in a new apartment will be good for us.
look, I found a place practically on the beach.
or another one right next to a park.
but, until then, astor, you get to share the bed with me.
and, Dexter, you're on the couch.
Cody, you're on the cot.
time for you both to get to bed... school tomorrow.
how can I go to school?
I don't even have any of my things.
make a list. I'll go by the house tomorrow.
I want to go with you.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Why?
well...
because of what happened to your mother there.
I know what happened to my mom.
she was murdered.
don't forget, 9 A. M. tomorrow.
FBI interview.
one final loose end to tie up before putting all this behind me.
at the time of your wife's death, you were...
I already told you. I was on my boat.
right.
just seemed odd.
you do a lot of night boating, Mr. Morgan?
sometimes. It's more peaceful.
and you were by yourself?
Yes, I was alone. There's security cameras at the marina.
you can see me leaving and returning.
we've seen the footage, Mr. Morgan.
problem is, according to the coroner's report, your wife was killed several hours before you got on the boat.
is that what this is about?
you fucking serious?
suggesting I have anything to do with my wife's death...
that I'd slice her artery, let her bleed out in the bathroom...
Mr. Morgan, we know that you were at Arthur Mitchell's house.
at the time of your wife's death, you were part of the team that raided Arthur Mitchell's house.
right, of course.
we know you didn't kill your wife.
we're just looking for a reason why Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.
because he's a serial killer?
how'd it go?
It's...Fine.
I'm just glad it's over, and I can move on.
we miss you, brother.
yeah?
how's handling the department all by yourself?
Ah, it's a breeze.
I'll be back in a few days.
Oh, no you won't.
you're taking at least another week.
you need to spend time with your family.
Thanks.
excuse me.
anything you need, Dexter, just ask.
I will.
see you tonight.
Oh, grandparents stopping by too.
they're all staying at your place?
Yeah.
it's crowded.
but it's temporary.
he just doesn't want the kids staying at the house - where their mom... - Right.
so...we all good here?
Yeah, he's airtight.
but otherwise, we got Jack shit.
Arthur Mitchell disappeared.
the only lead we have now is this Kyle Butler.
we had a murder victim by that name a few weeks back.
well, our guy's alive, as far as we know.
unfortunately, he's disappeared as well.
we're gonna have a sketch artist meet with the family, and get a composite of him.
okay.
well, I'd appreciate it if you'd keep me posted.
will do.
Oh, hey.
Maria, your mail.
pero que cono?
so, Dexter Morgan, let's get you a moving van.
aren't you a cute kid, huh?
he's not actually talking yet.
here's your 18-footer.
what's his name?
14-footer.
it's a family name?
blood.
uh, sort of.
so what kind of stuff you moving?
just, uh, furniture, clothes.
uh, dresser, maybe.
plenty of reasons for blood to be there.
