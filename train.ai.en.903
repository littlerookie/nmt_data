Yeah, Sissy Skinner. - What a Gaylord.
thank you, Andrews.
now, despite my comments about "beheading" customers,
I personally relish the competition of another store.
anything to energise my workforce.
and anyway, what makes you think I could dislodge part of the church roof?
or for that matter, stage a car crash?
it's a well known fact that the church roof is in dire need of repair.
and isn't it true that two of your own employees operate the vehicle removal service for the council?
sergeant, this is the 21st Century.
many people hold down several jobs.
I myself host a life drawing class at the Village Hall.
Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.
nevertheless, you could have utilised the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.
these accusations are quite meaningless, Sergeant, unless you can back them up with hard evidence.
well, you've got me there.
I'd need something conclusive.
something that placed you at the scene of the crime.
perhaps a wound you sustained on a piece of broken glass this very evening.
this very evening.
sergeant, this is beginning to get embarrassing.
how could I possibly be in several places at once?
I'm sure the store's security footage will absolve me.
do feel free to spool through.
I can handle this, Danny.
you might as well go back and just enjoy the rest of your birthday.
did you really get me that plant? - Yes, I did.
but it's been impounded as evidence.
well, I mean, maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?
Yeah.
sergeant, I wanted you to know that if I do indeed now own the land belonging to...
belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it into a memorial garden, in her honour.
mr Skinner, what you do with your land is of no concern of mine,
so jog on.
Michael, will you escort the Sergeant off the premises when he's quite finished?
Yarp.
I just can't believe Leslie's dead. How did it happen?
she tripped and fell on her own shears.
Hey, that weren't me.
Hey, look.
look, Mr Treacher's got his big coat on again.
you want anything from the shop? - Cornetto.
no luck catching them killers, then? - It's just the one killer, actually.
no luck catching them killers, then? - It's just the one killer, actually.
no luck catching them killers, then? - It's just the one killer, actually.
no luck catching them killers, then? - It's just the one killer, actually.
what's the matter? You got brain-freeze? - No, I got brainwave.
get us back to the station, now!
it's more than one person. - Come again?
it's more than one killer. - It was Skinner a minute ago.
Yeah, well, maybe it still is.
you know, maybe he's... Maybe he's not alone. Maybe there are others.
Nicholas, you're an exceptional officer. But I've seen this before.
sir? - Sergeant Popwell.
it was exactly the same thing.
you've come from a city where there's danger round every corner, and it's driven you round the bend.
Yes, sir.
do yourself a favour. Sleep on it.
and if you still feel the same in the morning, I give you my word, I'll get right on to it.
Hey. Hey, what's happening? What's going on?
nothing, nothing. I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.
I mean, do you want a lift? - No, no, I could do with a walk.
Hey, big one, playtime's over.
skinner ON WALKIE-TALKIE.; Michael?
Michael? Are you there?
Michael? Is everything okay?
Yarp.
sergeant Angel's been taken care of?
Yarp.
he's not gonna get back up again?
Narp!
good. Proceed to the castle.
Frank, this shit just got real.
skinner just sent someone to kill me, and, now, now he's gone somewhere.
up to the... To the castle, I think. I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.
okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.
Oh, my God. What happened to your Peace Lily?
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay? And watch him, and call your dad.
tell him I was right. - What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna bust this thing wide open. - Nicholas, wait.
you might need this. - Thanks, partner.
SKINNER.; How could I possibly be in several places at once?
how could I possibly be in several places at once?
how could I possibly be in several places at once?
Jo YCE.; I just can't believe Leslie's dead. How did it happen?
WEAVER.; You'll find that we run a very tight ship here.
Reverend SHOO TER.; Who could do something like this?
HATCHER.; Seems like Mr Merchant tried to have a little fry up and left the gas on.
HATCHER.; Nasty way to go.
AMANDA.; What happened, Danny?
ANNETTE.; No luck catching them killers, then?
no luck catching them killers, then?
no luck catching them...
now, quick announcement before we begin.
Janet Barker has decided to call her boys Roger and Martin.
and the christening will be a week on Saturday and we're all invited.
Tom. - Thanks, Joyce.
now, you'll all be delighted to hear that the tenacious Sergeant Angel has been taken care of.
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying on the wet floor of his bathroom, having slipped and tragically broken his neck.
so, with the dispatch of the Sergeant, we will now be able to concentrate on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.
quite right.
after which, nothing will stand in our way.
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr Weaver.
well, well, well, I see we have visitors.
sergeant Nicholas Angel. Sandford Police Service.
my, he is tenacious, isn't he?
I'm arresting you under suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.
you should be ashamed.
calling yourself a community that cares. - Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.
it's all about the greater good.
all: The greater good.
how can this be for the greater good?
all: The greater good.
you see, as much as I enjoyed your wild theories, Sergeant, the truth is far less complex.
blower's fate was simply the result of his being an appalling actor.
all: Quite appalling.
you murdered him for that?
well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare. - What?
the Dramatic Society is an important feather in our cap.
HATCHER.; Couldn't let Blower jeopardise that.
not when we had two semi-professionals waiting in the wings.
let's not forget that Greg was an extra in Straw Dogs.
and Sheree played a cadaver in Prime Suspect.
Yes, I know!
martin was less concerned with the reputation of the village
and so Eve deserved to die too?
well, she did have a very annoying laugh.
all: Annoying.
and, and George Merchant? - He had an awful house.
all: Awful.
we begged him in vain to make his residence more in keeping with the village's rustic aesthetic.
and what about Tim Messenger? What was his crime?
tim Messenger's tenure as editor of the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.
our once great paper had become riddled with tabloid journalism.
not to mention persistent errors.
he listed her age as 55. - When, actually, I'm 53.
what, what about Leslie Tiller? One of your own?
her horticultural expertise helped put Sandford on the map.
Oh, she was ever so good.
cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.
but it seemed she was set on moving away.
we couldn't have her sharing her green fingers with anybody else.
not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.
if we can't have her, no one can.
how can this be for the greater good?
all: The greater good. - Shut it!
these people died for no reason. No reason whatsoever!
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Hello, Nicholas.
I was like you once.
I believed in the immutable word of the law.
that is until the night Mrs Butterman was taken from me.
you see, no one loved Sandford more than her.
she was head of the Women's Institute, chair of the floral committee.
when they started the Village of the Year contest, she worked round the clock. I've never seen such dedication.
on the eve of the adjudicator's arrival, some travellers moved into Callahan Park.
before you could say, "Gypsy scum," we were knee-deep in dog muck, thieving kids and crusty jugglers.
all: Crusty jugglers.
we lost the title and Irene lost her mind.
she drove her Datsun Cherry into Sandford Gorge.
from that moment on, I swore that I would do her proud.
and whatever the cost, we would make Sandford great again.
sir, this doesn't make any sense.
the adjudicators arrive tomorrow. We had to get everything ready.
are you saying this is all about winning the Best Village Award?
this is the best village, Nicholas. You've seen the people.
they're happy, contented. - They're living in a dream world.
sergeant Popwell thought much the same as you.
I'm disappointed you can't see the bigger picture.
well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.
and I'm afraid you're gonna have to come with me.
you are all gonna have to come with me.
no, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you who is going to have to come with us.
Danny, no.
back off! Back off!
or I swear to God, you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over and accidentally cut off his own head.
come on, Nicholas. You haven't got it in you.
I mean it!
shit!
FRANK.; Gypsy scum. Travellers.
thieving kids. Dog muck.
crusty jugglers.
crusty jugglers. Crusty jugglers.
there hasn't been a recorded murder in Sandford for 20 years.
there's a reason we accommodate a few of the younglings at the pub.
spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.
I'll make sure everyone gets their just deserts.
WEAVER.; If we don't come down hard on these clowns...
FRANK.; We'll get round to it.
Danny!
Ta-da.
what are you doing? - Saving your skin.
this is murder! - It's not, it's ketchup.
I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about the others.
what others? - The others the NWA have murdered.
that's not true. - It is!
dad just said it was his special club, he...
I thought it was about rapping people on the knuckles - and sending them on their way. - There are skeletons back there!
I don't know nothing about no skelingtons.
what did you think was happening? - Not this!
it's Frank.
he's appointed himself judge, jury and executioner.
he's not Judge Judy and executioner. - He is!
you've gotta help me take him down. - I can't.
he's my dad. Take my car.
go back to London. There's nothing you can do.
I can come back.
I can come back, and I can bring the blue fury of the Metropolitan Police Service with me.
they'll make it disappear. Who are they gonna believe?
my dad, or a loony London police officer.
but it won't be just me, will it?
we can do it together. You and me. Partners.
forget it, Nicholas. It's Sandford.
is that everything? Sir?
sir? Sir?
is there anything I can do for you? - No.
this is something I have to do myself.
another beautiful day in God's country.
Danny?
it's...
mum!
what you gonna do?
just walk in and arrest the whole village?
not exactly.
Oh, Sergeant Angel? Someone from London called for you.
I'll tell them you'll ring them back.
well, that's funny. - What's that?
I didn't know we had a mounted division.
nobody tells me nothing.
wanna do something useful?
AMANDA.; Annette, that Sergeant Angel's back. Check out his horse.
ANNETTE.; Roger that!
it's... - Angel.
morning.
that's what I'm talking about.
still feel like you're missing out?
fascist!
hag!
stop! Stop this, please!
let us stop this mindless violence.
Nicholas, my son.
you may not be a man of God, but surely you're a man of peace.
I may not be a man of God, Reverend, but I know right, and I know wrong, and I have the good grace to know which is which.
Oh, fuck off, Grasshopper.
No!
Jesus Christ!
Nicholas! Nicholas!
I thought you was a goner.
drop your weapons!
Dr. Hatcher, no! - Shut up, Danny.
I brought you into this world, I think it's rather fitting
I should be the one to take you out of it.
you and your interfering little friend.
now...
drop them.
you're a doctor, deal with it. - Yeah, motherfucker.
Danny, let's roll. - What you thinking?
pub?
Roy!
somebody call the police!
Freeze!
officers, arrest that man.
Danny, step away from the Sergeant. - No, Dad.
Danny, you'll do as you're told.
I'm not taking orders from you anymore.
officers, arrest these men! - Wait, wait!
you can arrest us if you like.
you can throw us in prison and go back to being blind, submissive slaves.
or you can be real police officers, and help us bring an end to this absurd story.
what the fuck is he on about?
fuck are you on about?
have you ever wondered why the crime rate in Sandford is so low?
and yet the accident rate, it's so high? - No. Yeah. What?
you've been brainwashed, Tony.
brainwashed into naivety by an old man with a murderous obsession.
this is ridiculous. - No, it's not, Dad. It's very unridiculous.
and it's only now that I'm starting to realise how unridiculous it all is.
silence, Danny!
think of your mother. - Mum is dead, Dad.
for the first time in my life, you know, I'm glad.
if she could see what you've become,
I think she'd probably kill herself all over again.
sorry, I am completely lost.
Sandford is a lie, Doris.
for the last 20 years, the village has been controlled by Frank and the NWA.
they've lulled everyone into thinking this is a perfect village and killed anyone who's threatened to change that.
I reckon he's got something there.
he says, "He reckons you got something there.
I know.
you're not seriously gonna believe this man, are you?
are you? He isn't even from round here.
maybe it's time to give it up, sir.
you incompetent flatfoots!
officer Walker, stay here with Saxon and hold everything down.
fair enough.
officers, let's go.
what about Dad? - He'll come round again.
want anything from the shop?
what you thinking? - Well...
we should strike now, while we've got the element of surprise.
longer we wait, more time they've got to mobilise.
I say we go in through the front entrance, take the place aisle by aisle.
they won't be expecting that.
very good. What he said.
my, my. Here come the fuzz.
maybe they're not here. - Wait here.
don't go in on your own. - Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.
okay. They're in.
you deal with the store. I'll deal with the trolley boy.
no, listen. Wait, wait, wait, Michael, wait, listen to me. Listen, listen.
is this what you really, really want?
Yarp.
suit yourself.
fisher: Go, go, go.
Oh, come on.
Andy!
it's all right, Andy. It's just Bolognese!
how's Lurch? - He's in the freezer.
did you say, "Cool off"? - No, I didn't say anything, actually.
shame.
there was a bit earlier on that you missed when I distracted him with the cuddly monkey.
and then I said, "Playtime's over," and I hit him with the Peace Lily.
you're off the fucking chain!
what's the situation? - Two blokes and a fuckload of cutlery.
what do you reckon?
idea.
good work, everyone.
nice one, Doris. - Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.
fruit attack!
can you handle this, Sergeant Fisher? We're gonna go after the big boss.
we're on it, Sergeant.
Danny, let's rock. - Angel!
don't go being a twat now.
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.
we should get down there. - How?
skip.
head them off? - Fuck, yeah.
I'll drive. - Shotgun! Punch that shit!
bang! Bang!
swan!
swan!
stay back! Or the ginger nut gets it!
you little fucker!
get out of my village!
it's not your village anymore.
you did good, kid. - Ta.
what's your name? - Aaron A. Aaronson.
sorry?
angel!
it's over, Danny.
it's over.
this really hurts.
I'm going to need some ice-cream.
Yeah, well, don't worry. There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.
isn't that right, Danny?
stay back!
pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard! - Now, now.
we don't want any more bloodshed.
Frank, this whole thing started because you lost somebody you loved.
don't expect me to believe you'd let it end the same way.
I'll tell you how this is gonna end!
I feel like I should say something smart.
you don't have to say anything at all.
satisfactory conclusion to the whole operation.
now, my perfect Sunday would begin with...
chief INSPECTOR: What do you say, Nicholas?
we... We... We have been trying to reach you for days.
Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy. - SERGEANT: We need you back.
the figures have gone a little squiffy in your absence, it has to be said.
come back to London.
Sandford's hardly a fitting place for such an exceptional officer.
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.
I kind of like it here.
besides, we have to do a considerable amount of paperwork.
fisher: Well, good job we've got the manpower, Andy?
well, official vocab guidelines state that we say "staffing," not "manpower,
cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.
you don't mind a bit of manpower do you, Doris?
Oh, dirty bastard!
Andy!
you cheeky fucker!
you know what you are?
a bloody busybody!
No!
Oh, God, no!
angel: Danny!
Danny!
Oh, God.
hold on, Danny, just hold on.
hold on, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.
just hang on, hang on!
everything's gonna be fine.
everything's gonna be fine.
everything's gonna be fine.
everything's gonna be just fine.
hope these are okay.
Yeah. They're lovely.
any officers near the church? - Go ahead, Doris.
chief, we've had a report of some hippy types messing with the recycling bins at the supermarket.
leave it with us. - Righto.
sergeant Butterman, little hand says it's time to rock and roll.
bring the noise.
after weeks of campaigning, Tony Blair and his family strolled to the polling station this election day morning.
the Labour faithful feel pride 'in Mr Blair's achievements 'as he is about to become the youngest PM this century.'
have you voted yet, Mr CraWford? - Yes, Ma'am.
l Was there When they opened. First in line, seven o'clock.
l don't mind telling you, it Wasn't for Mr Blair.
you're not a moderniser? - Certainly not.
we're in danger of losing too much that is good about this country.
there is a growing sense of excitement.
l envy you, being able to vote. Not the actual ticking of the box, although it Would be nice to experience that once...but the sheer joy of being partial.
Yes. Of course, one forgets that as sovereign, you're not entitled to vote.
no. - Still, l don't feel sorry for you.
you might not be alloWed to vote, ma'am......but it is your government.
Yes.
l suppose that is some consolation.
good morning.
shall l draW the curtains? - Yes, please.
so, did you stay up all night?
Yes, ma'am.
and Was it as expected?
Yes, ma'am. Mr Blair.
by a landslide.
Oh, l see.
they've stopped the traffic completely 'for Tony Blair's first day of poWer in London.
you've got the ceremonial, the official 'and you've got a lovely summer's day.
Tony Blair Waving to the croWds, people Waving to them there.
l guess they knoW it's the Prime Minister on the streets.'
the Prime Minister is on his Way, ma'am.
to be, Robin. The Prime Minister to be.
l haven't asked him yet.
he's a hard one to read, isn't he?
Yes. On the one hand, his background is quite establishment
father a Conservative, educated at Fettes.
he had the same tutor as the Prince of Wales.
we'll try not to hold that against him.
on the other, his manifesto promises the most radical shake-up of the constitution in 300 years.
think he'll try to modernise us? - l Wouldn't put it past him.
his Wife has anti-monarchist sympathies.
you may remember her curtsy the first time you met.
lt could best be described as shalloW.
l don't measure the depth of a curtsy, Robin.
l leave that to my sister.
downing Street is expected to be informal
everyone on first-name terms, at the Prime Minister's insistence.
what, " Call me Tony " ? - Yes, ma'am.
Oh, l don't like that. Have We sent him a protocol sheet?
funny, l'm actually rather nervous. - Why? You've met her before.
l knoW, but never one to one, and never as Prime Minister.
well, remember, you're a man that's just been elected by the nation.
but she's still, you knoW, the Queen.
the audience room is upstairs.
when We reach the audience room, l Will knock.
we shall go straight inside.
standing by the door, We boW, from the neck.
l Will introduce you. The Queen Will extend her hand.
you go to her, boW again, then shake her hand.
a couple of other things
it's ma'am as in ham, not ma'am as in farm.
when you're in the presence, at no point must you shoW your back.
the presence? - Yes, sir.
that's What it's called When you're in Her Majesty's company.
would you like to sit there, Mrs Blair?
how nice to see you again, Mr Blair.
and congratulations. - Thank you.
your children must be proud. - l hope so.
you've three, haven't you? - That's right.
such a blessing, children. Do sit doWn.
thank you.
have We shoWn you hoW to start a nuclear War yet?
Er...no. - Oh. First thing We do, apparently.
then We take aWay your passport and send you round the World.
you obviously knoW my job better than l do.
Yes, Well, you are my tenth prime minister, Mr Blair.
my first Was Winston Churchill.
he sat in your chair in a frock coat and top hat.
he Was kind enough to give a young girl like me quite an education.
l can imagine.
with time, one has hopefully added experience and Wisdom, better enabling us to execute our constitutional responsibility, to advise, guide and Warn the government of the day.
advice Which l... look forward to receiving.
Yes. We'll save that for our Weekly meetings.
lf there's nothing else, l believe We have some business to attend to.
of course.
your Majesty, my party has Won the election, and so l ask your permission to form a...
no, Mr Blair. l ask the question.
the duty falls upon me, as sovereign, to invite you to become Prime Minister and to form a government in my name.
and if you agree, the custom is to say yes.
Yes.
Mrs Blair, lovely to see you again.
and congratulations. You must be very proud.
Yes. - And exhausted, l imagine.
where Will you spend the summer? - France.
lovely. - You'll be in Balmoral?
Yes. Wonderful place.
my great, great grandmother, Victoria said, " ln Balmoral, all seems to breathe freedom and peace " and make one forget the World and its sad turmoils. "
your Majesty... - Oh, excuse me.
- No. Really?
Oh. Yes, of course.
l'm so sorry. We're going to have to leave it there.
not too short, Was it, 1 5 minutes?
one doesn't Want to be rude. - No, ma'am.
morning.
'thanks for coming. NoW, fuck off. " - What Was that about?
God knoWs. lt'll be something to do With Diana.
princess Diana embroiled in controversy 'as she pulls out of a meeting With MPs.'
princess Diana moved to mend relations With the former nanny...
princess Diana attended a memorial service for the fashion designer Gianni Versace.
...where another royal controversy sparkles.'
...was embroiled in a second controversy this Week.
l am not a political figure.
princess Diana sailed out into the Mediterranean in one of Mr Mohamed Al Fayed's yachts today.
with his son. - ...quarter of a million pounds for photographs Which appear to shoW the couple embracing.
once again, her judgement's under scrutiny.
earlier today, they visited the...
what?
tell Sir Guy l Want everyone in ASAP.
ma'am? Ma'am?
yes? - Ma'am, Mr Janvrin is here to see you.
what?
Oh.
good evening ma'am.
l'm sorry to disturb, but l've just had a call from our embassy in Paris.
lt's the Princess of Wales. - Why? What's she done noW?
l see. Er... Who are We speaking to there?
right, Well, keep me updated.
lt's Diana. She's been in a car accident in Paris.
ls it serious?
apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.
let's recap on the details of those injuries, Maxine.'
they're saying the Princess is in the intensive care unit 'of a southeast Paris hospital.
she has concussion, a broken arm...' - Why Was she in Paris?
l thought she Was in London. - You knoW What she's like.
Charles, isn't this aWful?
what Will you do about the boys? - Let them sleep until We knoW more.
Yes, that's sensible. - l should go to Paris.
l told my people to organise a jet.
what, a private one? - Yes.
lsn't that the sort of extravagance they attack us for?
how else can l get to Paris at this time of night?
Charles, dear, use the royal flight.
they keep one plane on permanent standby in case l should kick the bucket.
no, Mummy, he can't. This isn't a matter of state.
what are you talking about?
Diana is not one of the royal family. She's not an HRH.
lt's a private matter. - She's mother to your grandchildren.
what is happening noW?
l don't knoW. l can't hear. Everyone's shouting.
thanks for coming in. - The ambassador from Paris.
good evening, sir.
yes?
l've just spoken to our ambassador in Paris, ma'am.
l'm afraid it's not good neWs.
No!
no...
no. No. No.
no.
Diana, Princess of Wales, has died after a car crash in Paris.
the French government announced her death this morning.
what have l got on this Week? - Writing your conference speeches.
well, let's cancel everything else.
this is going to be massive.
her death Was confirmed by the French...'
l'll make a statement in the morning. - l've started coming up With ideas.
she's only been dead an hour. - Would you prefer l didn't?
try and be very brave.
lt's Mummy. She's dead.
they're going to go back to sleep.
try, anyway.
my private secretary's office have found a travel agency in NeW York that Will sell me a flight to Paris With an hour's stopover in Manchester.
perhaps you might consider if it's an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future king of England in one of our planes.
all right. Of course.
John, l don't Want the boys to see the neWs and get upset.
take the radio from the bedroom and the TV from the nursery.
Yes, ma'am.
well, Well, Well. - Yes.
are you all right?
your sister called, from Tuscany.
l hope you told her to cut her holiday short.
l did. - l can't imagine she Was pleased.
that's putting it mildly. - What did she say?
something about Diana being more annoying dead than alive.
never let the boys hear you talk like that.
of course.
something to help you go doWn?
no, l think l'll Write my diary a little longer.
fine. l'm going to bed.
we've heard nothing official from the palace.
we don't knoW When We'll get any statements from the palace 'or When the royal family are due.'
that's hoW she Will remain, in our minds, our hearts, forever.
OK? Got it. - 'Where Will you do it?'
at the church, on the Way in. - l'll organise it.
viscount Althorp, Diana's brother...'
hang on. l Want to Watch this.
this is not a time for recriminations, but for sadness.
however, l Would say l alWays believed the press Would kill her in the end.
not even l imagined they Would take such a direct hand in her death 'as seems to be the case.
lt Would appear that every proprietor and editor of every publication 'that paid for intrusive photographs of her has blood on his hands today.'
not the press, mate. You've got the Wrong villain.
Tony...
Oh. Got to go. - You about to speak to the Queen?
Yeah. - Ask her if she greased the brakes.
now, noW.
Thanks.
Hello? - 'Putting you through.'
Oh... Right, OK.
ls the Prince of Wales With the boys? - Yes, ma'am.
good. And he's going to Paris? - Yes.
l'm sorry to disturb, ma'am... Ma'am......but l have the Prime Minister for you, from his constituency.
lucky you.
thank you, Robin. l'll take it in the study.
your Majesty.' - Prime Minister.
may l say hoW very sorry l am.
the thoughts and prayers of my family are With you at this terrible time, and With the princes in particular.
thank you.
ls it your intention to make some kind of appearance or statement?'
no. No, certainly not.
no-one in the royal family Will speak publicly. This is a private matter.
we Would appreciate it if it could be respected as such.
l see.
l don't suppose anyone's thought about the funeral.
we've spoken With the Spencer family, and it is their express Wish that this should be a private funeral With a memorial service to folloW.
right.
as Diana Was no longer a member of the royal family, We must respect their Wishes.
l see.
you don't feel that in vieW of her high profile and popularity, it might be an idea to pay tribute to her life and achievements, or even just to her as a mother?
well, as l said, it's her family's Wish.
and the public, ma'am, the British people?
you don't think that might be denying them a chance...'
a chance to What?
to share in the grief?'
this is a family funeral, Mr Blair, not a fairground attraction.
l think the Princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press, don't you?
lf there's nothing else, the children have to be looked after.
of course. Goodbye, Your Maj...
her instinct is to do nothing, say nothing, and give her a private funeral.
are you surprised? She hated her guts.
l think it's a mistake.
they screWed up her life. l hope they don't screW up her death.
where can l get a black tie?
Oh, the chaplain called.
he asked if he should make any changes in the service, any special mention of Diana.
what did you say?
l told him not to change a thing. - Quite right.
the less attention draWn to it, the better, for the boys.
Yes.
we should find some company for them, some young people.
l'll take them for a long Walk up Craggy Head.
Yes, but no guns, Philip. lt is Sunday.
we're going, l believe, to Sedgefield, the Prime Minister's constituency,
where he is about to make a statement.
Yes, the Prime Minister coming noW With his Wife, Cherie.'
Yeah, Well, apart from that?
he's on. Alastair, he's on! Come on!
though her oWn life Was often sadly touched by tragedy, 'she touched the lives of so many others in Britain and throughout the World......With joy and With comfort.
the people everywhere, not just here in Britain, everywhere, 'they kept faith With Princess Diana.
they liked her. They loved her.
they regarded her as one of the people.
she Was the people's princess......and that's hoW she Will...stay, 'hoW she Will remain......in our hearts and in our memories...forever.'
a bit over the top, don't you think?
the Prime Minister, paying his tribute to the Princess of Wales.'
the people of Britain, he said, kept faith With Princess Diana.
they loved her. She Was the people's princess.
do We have the Royal Standard? - Yes, sir.
and floWers? - Yes, sir.
lf We left it to the royal undertakers, they'd bring her back in a crate.
- Hello?
this is Lord Airlie. May l speak to the Prime Minister?'
one moment, please. Lord Airlie.
the Lord Chamberlain in charge of the funeral.
you're meeting him at the airport.
lord Airlie. - Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
lt's my job to organise all the ceremonial events.
there's no precedent for the funeral of an ex-HRH.
perhaps We should plan for any contingency.
l propose a meeting tomorroW morning at Buckingham Palace, 'officials from all three palaces, representatives of the Spencer family, the emergency services and your people.
Absolutely. Of course.
precedent? Where do they find these people?
thank you.
brigadier Sir Charles Wood.
air Commodore Wessex.
prime Minister. - l'm so sorry, sir.
lf there's anything l or my government can do...
they stood up as We drove past, in cafés, in restaurants, removed their hats.
this Was Paris, and you could hear a pin drop.
l imagine it Will be the same here. - The palace prefers a private funeral.
what are your feelings on that? - l...
l think that'll present us With difficulties.
so do l.
my mother... The Queen comes from a generation not best equipped.
she greW up in the War.
l think What We need, What this country needs, is a more modern perspective, if you folloW.
balmoral is... - l think l understand.
an aircraft of the Queen's Flight brought the Princess's body home, 'Where the Prime Minister gathered With members of his government.
a black hearse crossed the Tarmac 'and a Royal Air Force guard of honour moved forward.'
has anyone heard from the Spencers? Did they say When the funeral Will be?
hmm? l don't knoW. Nobody tells me anything.
president Clinton heard the neWs last night.'
we liked her very much.
we admired her Work for children, for people With AlDS 'for ending the scourge of land mines...'
on our Walk today, one of the gillies said he'd seen a stag up Craggy Head.
he reckoned 14 points. - Oh.
we haven't had one as big as that on the estate for years.
no. Quite.
...and l Was tremendously impressed...'
anyway, l thought it might be a good distraction.
for the boys. - What, stalking?
you don't think it's too soon? - Anything that gets them out is good.
...as their relationship deteriorated, 'she became increasingly unhappy.
the couple divorced in August of last year.
their love story brought croWds into the streets.
they came to see the Queen and the Prince, 'but most of all, they came to see Diana.'
l'm going to bed. - 'But the fairytale Was destined...'
l'll ring the Lord Chamberlain's office to say We'll send representatives to the meeting.
thank you, Stephen.
she gave us so much.
why couldn't We have given her something and left her alone?
lt just...hurts me so much.
l've never experienced anything like this.
l Wait to Wake up, like it's a bad dream.
right, it's ten o'clock. Let's get started.
thank you all for coming at such short notice.
l think We all agree that this is a sensitive occasion, Which presents us With tremendous challenges logistically, constitutionally, practically, diplomatically and procedurally.
Oh, Christ.
after 1 8 years of opposition, l am proud to stand before you as the neW Prime Minister...
labour Prime Minister.
l Want to set an ambitious course to modernise this country, to breathe neW life into old institutions, to make privilege something for the many, not the feW.
you think the royals are nutters? You should meet their flunkies.
two and a half hours to choose betWeen a hearse or a gun carriage.
you got raves in the press. This calls you " The nation's mourner in chief. "
this lot says you correctly judged the country's mood.
Hello? - Even The Mail Was impressed.
people's princess, mate. You oWe me.
gordon for you. - Tell him to hang on.
ls it going to be a public funeral? - Yeah. Saturday.
lt's a Whopper. The Abbey, the Works. - Great.
has anyone told the Queen? - l don't knoW.
no doubt some flunky Will be dispatched, grovelling on all fours.
do you think it's Wise for the boys to go stalking?
anything that gets them out is good.
maybe they shouldn't take guns.
lf a photographer saW them, it might send the Wrong signal.
lf there is a photographer out there, he could be the first kill of the day.
l see Mr Fayed Was buried last night.
at midnight. No cameras, no fuss.
very dignified.
why do they do that? Why do they bury the bodies so soon after death?
lslamic tradition.
something to do With the heat. - Mmm.
lt stops the body decomposing.
- Come in.
good morning, ma'am. Ma'am.
Yes, Robin? What can We do for you?
Er...ma'am, there Was a meeting at the palace this morning.
about the funeral arrangements. Yes.
the Lord Chamberlain faxed these plans for you to consider.
there is noW general agreement, ma'am, that a public funeral Would be more appropriate.
l see.
and What form Will this funeral take?
at the moment, they're suggesting...
and, of course, these are early days, basing it on Tay Bridge.
Tay Bridge? - What?
Tay Bridge is the code name for my funeral.
lndeed, ma'am, but it Would be for practical reasons only.
lt's the only one Which has been rehearsed, the only one that could be put together in time.
but l supervised those plans myself.
lndeed, and the Lord Chamberlain Was at pains to stress that the spirit of the occasion Will be quite different.
for example, the suggestion is that instead of 400 soldiers, 400 representatives of the Princess's charities march behind the coffin.
and, instead of foreign heads of state and croWned heads of Europe, the guests Would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other...celebrities.
celebrities?
Oh.
Er...Was there anything else?
no, ma'am.
Oh, yes, one other thing.
the police commissioner Was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book.
lt Would give the groWing croWds something to do, make marshalling them easier.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
Oh, and the floWers. - What floWers?
the floWers outside Buckingham Palace.
they're blocking the main gate, and making things difficult for the changing of the guard.
fine. Just move them aWay.
the Lord Chamberlain Was Wondering Whether We shouldn't leave the floWers and send the guards through the north gate.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
Yes, quite right.
stephen Lamport on One.
who? - Prince of Wales's private secretary.
Balmoral. - He says it's urgent.
lt's all right.
good morning. - Good morning, Prime Minister.
the Prince of Wales has asked me to thank you for your kind Words.
not at all.
the Prince feels that you and he are both modern men of similar mind, Who could Work Well together at this difficult time.
Er...Well, please thank His Highness, and assure him he can count on my full support......at all times.
was that it? - Er...yes.
goodbye.
bizarre.
why is Charles doing this? - What?
creeping up to me like this, banging on about being modern.
he did it at the airport.
he knoWs that if the Queen gets it Wrong over Diana, the royals Will become public enemy Number One.
he's terrified of being shot. - Who, Charles?
his people have asked for extra protection.
he thinks if he's seen to be on our side, that Will leave the Queen in the firing line.
so it's OK for his mother to take the bullet and not him?
what a family!
wait. Where are they? - Up at Craggy Head.
l'll come With you. - ln you go.
do you Want me to drive? - No. Certainly not.
l thought you Were getting a neW one? - What for? lt's perfectly all right.
l Was thinking What Diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris.
she Would have taken the boys to Paris. l regret not doing that.
what, and expose them to the media?
that Would have been dreadful. They're better off here.
lt's private. They're protected.
whatever you thought of Diana, she Was a Wonderful mother.
she adored those boys, and never let them forget it.
always Warm, physical, never afraid to shoW her feelings.
especially if a photographer Was in sight.
she may have encouraged all that, but still...that Was the extraordinary thing about her.
her Weaknesses and transgressions only made the public love her more.
yet ours only make them hate us. Why do they hate us?
not us, dear. - What?
yesterday, When We brought the coffin back, there Was a noise, a bang, and l thought it Was a gun.
l thought someone had taken a shot at me. l think l'm going to Walk back.
l don't feel like stalking. - Are you sure?
l'll take the dogs.
Walkies? Yes!
who knoWs the Way home? Come on.
do you think you Will ever be queen?'
no, l don't. No.
why do you think that?
l'd like to be a queen of people's hearts, in people's hearts, 'but l don't see myself being queen of this country.
l don't think many people Want me to be queen.
by many people, l mean the establishment l married into, 'because they've decided that l'm a non-starter.'
Charles and l had a talk in the car today.
he Was good enough to share his thoughts on motherhood.
what did he say? - HoW Wonderful Diana Was.
that's changing his tune.
he thought her natural.
they see me as a threat of some kind.'
Oh, for God's sake!
maybe he's got a point. Maybe We are partly to blame.
Oh, l can't Watch this.
no, no. Wait. Please, no, leave it.
l don't go by a rule book. l lead from the heart, not the head, 'and it's got me into trouble in my Work.'
we encouraged the match.
we signed off on it, both of us.
you Were very enthusiastic, remember?
she Was a nice girl. Then.
and l Was sure he'd give the other one up, or at least make sure his Wife toed the line.
lsn't that What everyone does? - ls it?
was Mrs Parker BoWles a factor in the breakdoWn of your marriage?'
there Were three of us in this marriage, so it Was a bit croWded.'
l can't bear it. lf you're Watching, l'll sleep next door.
early start tomorroW. - Any luck With your stag?
no. But close, a couple of hundred yards at one point.
one of the boys even got a shot off.
we'll get him tomorroW.
see you in the morning.
not to Worry. Night-night.
...and With her obsession With the belief 'that Charles loved a Woman he'd fallen for years before, Camilla...'
heaven Must be missing an angel Missing an angel, child, Cos you're here With me right noW...
the good neWs is the palace agreed to video screens.
and the bad neWs? - Crash barriers.
what about them? - They expect over tWo million people.
there aren't enough barriers, so We've gone cap in hand to the French for theirs.
there's something else l think you should see.
can We run that piece again?
of course. - You'll love this.
...find their behaviour disgraceful.' - 'What do you think?'
l think it's disgusting that they've not said a Word relating to all this.'
look, l knoW all this. - Wait for it.
...not to have a flag up. l think it's a disgrace on the royal family.'
OK, the Queen's not in residence, but Where is the flag?
do you see What l'm saying about the establishment?'
don't tell me there isn't a flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace.
dodi, When them tWo Were together, it Was a fairy tale come true.'
will someone please save these people from themselves?
fine, l'll call Balmoral. - Planet Zog?
l've really got nothing better to do.
come on, dogs. Come on.
those fire lighters all right? A bit damp?
Oh, Well, l brought some steW just in case.
lt's lamb. We can have that cold. - No, We'll be all right.
stay.
Robin had a call from the Prime Minister, Who expressed his concern.
about What? - The flag above Buckingham Palace.
he thinks it should be flying at half mast.
l hope Robin said there isn't a flag above Buckingham Palace.
there's the Royal Standard, Which flies to denote the presence of the monarch.
since you're here, the flagpole is bare, just as it should be.
lsn't it possible that for some people, the Royal Standard is just a flag, and the flagpole being bare sends out the Wrong signal?
no, that's not the point. - The point is it's over 400 years old.
lt's never been loWered for anyone.
your grandfather didn't get the flat at half mast When he died, and if your mother died tomorroW, she Wouldn't either.
Yes, Granny, but in a situation like this, one has to be flexible.
lt is just a flag.
'what about the Union Jack? " Was Mr Blair's next suggestion.
for heaven's sake!
next, he'll suggest you change your name to Hilda.
who does the think he's talking to? You're the sovereign.
you don't get dictated to. You conceded the idea of a public funeral.
you've opened the parks. That's enough.
SSH. The boys.
you Wait. ln 48 hours, this Will all have calmed doWn.
ln one sense, it's comforting.
now, my parents can see What it's been like for me, being up against her popularity.
they're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they kneW Will eventually be the one seen by the public, but it Won't.
the tWo Dianas, the public's and ours, bear no relation to one another at all.
the flag of St George, it is at half mast over Highgrove?
Yes, sir. - Get a picture of that in the papers.
l'll get onto it, call in a feW favours.
what about a statement of gratitude to the croWds?
something heartfelt from myself and the boys, thanking people for the floWers and so on.
right.
di Was Wonderful, because she stood up to the establishment.
she said, " You're elitist people We are paying to be better than us, " 'and you have to get out among the people. "
we have a Wonderful Prime Minister, Tony Blair, 'a compassionate young man, Who, after 1 8 years of establishment Tory rule 'is such a breath of fresh air, 'and l feel he Will do something...'
ls this the stirrings of... - What?
l don't knoW. Something more interesting.
maybe people Will see them for What they are.
which is?
a bunch of freeloading, emotionally retarded nutters.
that's just absurd. - Why?
they live in a cocoon of Wealth and they don't pay tax.
Yes, they do. - The Queen costs us 40 million a year.
lf you Want a serious conversation about the constitution.
we don't have one.
about Ways in Which We could phase out hereditary privileges, then fine.
lf you're leaving, take the plates. - Forget the 'off With their heads' bit.
Why? - lt insults your intelligence.
the Queen cannot be expected to change.'
lt's unimaginable, this country being a republic.
certainly in her lifetime. - Why?
because no-one Would Wear it. No-one Wants it.
lt's just...daft.
lt's not a mother thing, is it? - What?
well, if she Were alive noW, your mother Would be the same age.
you alWays say hoW stoical she Was old-fashioned, uncomplaining, lived through the War.
who does that sound like? - l'm going to do the Washing up.
that's the stalking party off.
right, We'd better have a look at those papers.
'show us there's a heart in the house of Windsor, " says The Sun.
'lt's proof the royals are not like us, " The Mirror.
'time to change the old guard at Buckingham Palace, " Express.
'one can't help Wondering Whose advice they are taking, " for it's clearly the Wrong advice. "
l'll try not to take that personally.
people have yearned for change in this country.
the result is a quiet revolution led by the real modernisers, the British people.
revolution? Who Wrote this?
where does this come from? - Where does it come from?
you've Won a huge majority. - People Want a change.
Why? What did you think it meant?
hurry, dear. Your tea's getting cold.
ls that it? - Yes, ma'am.
just the letter of condolence to the WidoW of the ambassador to Brazil.
thank you.
tea.
mr Janvrin, the Prime Minister Wishes to speak to Her Majesty.
ma'am, apparently the Prime Minister is on the phone.
tell him to call back.
no, no. lt's all right. l'll take it.
prime Minister. - Good morning, Your Majesty.
sorry to disturb, but l Was Wondering if you'd seen today's papers?
we've managed to look at one or tWo, yes.
ln Which case, my next question Would be Whether you felt 'some kind of response 'might be necessary?'
no. l believe a feW over-eager editors are doing their best to sell neWspapers.
lt Would be a mistake to dance to their tune.
under normal circumstances, l Would agree, 'but... Well, my advisors have been'
taking the temperature among people on the streets, and...Well, the information l'm getting is that the mood 'is quite delicate.'
so, What Would you suggest, Prime Minister?
some kind of a statement? - No, ma'am.
l believe the moment for statements has passed.
l Would suggest flying the flag at half mast above Buckingham Palace......and coming doWn to London at the earliest opportunity.
lt Would be of great comfort to your people.'
and Would help them With their grief.
'their grief " ?
lf you imagine l'm going to come to London, before l attend to my grandchildren, Who've just lost their mother...then you're mistaken.
l doubt there is anyone Who knoWs the British people more than l do, nor Who has greater faith in their Wisdom and judgement.
and it is my belief that they Will, at any moment, reject this...this mood, Which is being stirred up by the press in favour of a period of restrained grief and sober, private mourning.
that's the Way We do things in this country
quietly, With dignity.
lt's What the rest of the World admires us for.
lf that's your decision, ma'am, the government Will support it.
let's keep in touch. - Yes, let's.
bloody fool!
and noW your tea's gone cold.
Tony, Robin Janvrin on One. He Was listening in.
l understand hoW difficult her behaviour must seem to you, but try and see it from her perspective.
she's been brought up to believe it's God's Will.
she is Who she is.'
l think We should leave God out of it. lt's just not helpful.
she hasn't seen anything like this since the abdication, and l cannot emphasise the effect that had Unexpectedly becoming king as good as killed her father.
l'm afraid she's in a state of shock.
this public reaction has completely throWn her.'
all right, but first, We have to deal With these terrible headlines.
l'll do What l can With the press. - l'm grateful, Prime Minister.
l can't promise anything.
lt's not me they Want to see.
ask Alastair to come and see me.
cancel What l'm doing tonight.
good morning. - Your Majesty.
Thomas, Where have they gone?
up to Abergannie Ridge, ma'am. - All that Way?
remind me, that's right at the fork? - That's right, ma'am.
you folloW the track for about a mile, and you come to...The river.
one of the lads Will drive you. - No, l'll manage. Thank you.
bugger it!
Oh, hoW stupid!
Hello, Thomas.' - Hello, ma'am.
l've done something foolish. l've broken the prop shaft.
are you sure, ma'am. - Yes, of course l'm sure.
lt's the front one. Lost the four-Wheel drive.
don't forget, l Was a mechanic during the War.
are you all right? - l'm fine.
we'll come out straight aWay. - Thank you very much.
l'll Wait by the car. You are kind. Bye.
Oh, you're a beauty.
Shoo! Shoo! Go on!
go on.
go on!
there are neWs creWs outside Waiting for you to speak to the people.
Yes. - What's all that about?
l told the Queen's private secretary l'd try to help With the press.
Why? Don't you think she deserves it, sitting up there on her 40, 000 acres?
Yes, but alloWing her to hang herself might not be in our best interests either.
besides, l think there's something ugly about the Way everyone's started to bully her.
the first thing that you obviously think about...is the rest of your family, and l...
when's she coming to London, Mr Blair?
she's our figurehead.' - 'She is.'
she Wanted me to pass on to the people croWding around...'
ln a spare moment, the Prime Minister Went doWn DoWning Street...'
how are the boys? - Not so good tonight.
a lot of slamming doors.
l think they saW the papers. - Oh, no!
l'll take them out early again tomorroW morning.
perhaps they'll take it out on the stag.
what do you think of the royal family?'
they've made a mistake.'
pardon? - They've made a mistake.
Why? What do you mean?' - 'Well, they should've came.
the family should have come doWn to Buckingham Palace on Sunday, 'all of them.
that girl's been left on her oWn.
she's on her oWn and the place is empty.'
Oh, please!
sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair?
for someone they never kneW? And they think We're mad?
have you seen the funeral guest list? - No.
l suggest you keep it that Way.
a chorus line of soap stars and homosexuals.
apparently, Elton John is going to be singing.
that'll be a first for Westminster Abbey.
condolence books are being signed in embassies all over the World, and in London alone, the number has reached 40.
lt reminds me of one of those films
a feW of us in a fort, hordes of Zulus outside.
so, it's vital you hold firm. Stick to your guns.
you Wait. They Will come to their senses soon.
they have to.
come on, move over, Cabbage.
lt's six o'clock 'on Thursday 4th September.'
as people start camping out on the route of Princess Diana's funeral cortège, 'people are asking Why the Queen hasn't addressed her subjects?'
this is What the neWspapers are saying, " 'Where is our Queen? Where is her flag? " '
the Express, " ShoW us you care. " A picture of a grumpy Queen.
the Mail, " Let the flag fly at half mast, " and inside, " The Queen should be here to shoW her respects. "
but the flip side is " Blair more popular noW than Churchill. "
did they pick up on our statement of support?
just the one.
statements of support don't sell papers.
right.
ma'am! Ma'am!
the Prime minister for you, ma'am.
l'm afraid he's rather insisting.
l'll take it in the kitchen.
good morning. Sorry to disturb you.
l'm expecting a phone call to be put through. Out!
Oh, there it is.
thank you, Peter.
good morning, Prime Minister. - Good morning, ma'am.
you've seen today's headlines?
Yes, l have.
then l'm sure you'll agree the situation has become quite critical.
Ma'am?'
a poll that's to be published in tomorroW's papers suggests that 70% of people believe your actions have damaged the monarchy...
...and that one in four are noW in favour of abolishing the monarchy altogether.
as your Prime Minister, l believe it is my constitutional responsibility to advise the folloWing...
ls Queen Elizabeth up yet?
mummy?
one, fly the flag at half mast above Buckingham Palace and all other royal residences.
two, leave Balmoral and fly to London at the earliest opportunity.
three, pay our respects in person at Diana's coffin.
and four, make a statement, via live television, to my people and the World.
swift prosecution of these matters might, he felt, just might, avert disaster.
you Will have to talk to the Lord Chamberlain.
l have, and to Robert FelloWes. They both agree With Mr Blair.
Oh, l see. - Something's happened.
there's been a change, some...shift in values.
when you no longer understand your people, maybe it is time to hand over.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
remember the voW you took?
l declare that my Whole life, Whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.
your Whole life. That is a commitment to God as Well as your people.
what if my actions are damaging the CroWn?
damaging it? You're the greatest asset this institution has, one of the greatest it has ever had.
no. The problem Will come When you leave, but you mustn't think about that noW, not today.
Oh, Mummy.
you must shoW your strength, reassert your authority.
you sit on the most poWerful throne in Europe, head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years.
do you think any of your predecessors Would have dropped everything and gone to London because a bunch of hysterics carrying candles needed help With their grief?
as for that silly Mr Blair, With his Cheshire cat grin...
mr Janvrin on the phone for you, sir.
yes?
what?
l can't hear!
well, that's madness!
the Whole thing. Bloody madness!
l've just been told you've decided We're to folloW the Prime Minister's advice.
l just Want to say l...admire...
l think it's the right decision.
let's hope We haven't left it too late.
these are historic shots of the Windsors.
the Queen has had a change of heart.
she's clearly responding to the need 'to feel that the royal family is somehoW engaged.
these floWers have been brought to Balmoral 'so she can see some token of What's been expressed in London.'
fish fingers. Do you Want any? - l'll be right there.
thank God for that!
l'm afraid they're a bit burnt.
from CNN lnternational, this is World NeWs 'With Ralitsa Vassileva from CNN Center.'
queen Elizabeth Will deliver a televised address, Friday.
the royal family has been accused of shoWing little grief over the Princess's death.
where are the boys? Have they left? - Yes.
they left for London after breakfast With Charles.
lt's not right, you knoW.
no, but further discussion is no longer helpful either.
Oh, Well.
lt gives the gillies time to find another stag for the boys, noW theirs has been shot.
what? - Haven't you heard?
he Wandered over to a neighbouring estate, Where one of the commercial guests got him.
Oh.
Really?
which estate?
here's your box. There's some policy unit stuff that's important.
have you seen the papers? - l thought l'd skip them.
of course l've seen them. - Not bad, eh?

mr Father of the Nation.
ma'am? Good morning, ma'am.
good morning. - ls it his lordship you came to see?
no, please don't disturb him. l came on another matter. l hope you don't mind.
there he is.
he's a beauty, isn't he?
an imperial, ma'am.
Fourteen-pointer.
he Was Wounded. - Yes.
we got our guests in very close, had him lined up perfect...
...and still...
an investment banker, ma'am, from London.
l'm afraid the stalkers had to folloW him for miles to finish him off.
let's hope he didn't suffer too much.
pass my congratulations to your guest.
l Will, ma'am.
God bless you, ma'am. - Thank you.
ma'am... - Yes, Robin?
l've done a draft of your television address.
thank you.
was there anything else?
no, ma'am.
landing in 1 5 minutes.
l've got the Queen's speech.
shall l give Tony a copy? - Let me look at it first.
he's next door.
...and the anger, as somebody said earlier, 'perhaps Was that people grieving need to target their anger at somebody, 'and royal protocol might have got in the Way, 'but royal protocol is being sWept aside en masse today.'
come back, Diana!
...very serious, 'Her Majesty and the Duke.
normally, it is a happy occasion When they arrive here, 'and normally, When they're out the front, 'on days like Trooping the Colour, VE Day or VJ Day.
this is a tragic occasion.'
the Queen is getting out to talk to people.'
lt's very unusual. This is unprecedented.
l think, perhaps the last time the Queen Was among her people 'outside the palace Was the day the War in Europe ended.'
lt's really as if the public and the royal family, the monarchy, 'have had a bit of a quarrel and noW it's being healed in some measure.'
like a family spat, not unlike the spats they acknoWledged With Diana.
Jenny is quite right to say that Whatever the professional ups and doWns 'betWeen the Queen and the Princess...'
they sent a copy of the Queen's speech.
you might Want to scrape the frost off it first.
l think the queen Was generous in recognising 'that her oldest son Wasn't the easiest chap to be married to.'
l sent some suggestions to make it seem like it came from a human.
Yeah, all right, Alastair.
at least the old bat agreed to visit Diana's coffin.
when you get it Wrong, you really get it Wrong.
that Woman has given her Whole life in service to her people, 50 years doing a job she never Wanted, a job she Watched kill her father.
she's executed it With honour, dignity, and Without a single blemish, and noW, We're all baying for her blood!
she's leading the World in mourning for someone Who threW all she offered in her face, and Who, for years, seemed committed to destroying everything she holds most dear!
hello. Would you like me to place those for you?
no. - Oh.
these are for you.
for me?
thank you.
thank you very much.
ma'am, there's been a last-minute addition from DoWning Street.
they're suggesting adding, " and as a grandmother " here.
right.
'So, What l say to you noW, as your Queen, and as a grandmother, " l say from my heart. "
do you think you can say it?
do l have a choice? - They're ready for you, Your Majesty.
just to confirm, this is live. - Fine.
you'll be at the front of the six o'clock neWs on all channels.
Yes.
thank you.
OK, nice and quiet. - Ten seconds.
we cross, noW, live, to Buckingham Palace 'for the Queen's tribute to Princess Diana.'
since last Sunday's dreadful neWs,
we have seen, throughout Britain and around the World, an overwhelming expression of sadness at Diana's death.
we have all been trying, in our different Ways, to cope.
lt is not easy to express a sense of loss, 'since the initial shock is often succeeded by other feelings, 'disbelief, incomprehension, anger and concern for those Who remain.
we have all felt those emotions in these last feW days,' so What l say to you noW, as your Queen, and as a grandmother, l say from my heart.
heart? What heart? She doesn't mean a Word of this.
that's not the point. What she's doing is extraordinary.
ln good times and bad...'
that's hoW to survive. - Listen to you.
a Week ago, you Were the great moderniser, making speeches about the people's princess.
now you've gone Weak at the knees. - Ssh.
...and for her devotion to her tWo boys.'
l don't knoW Why l'm so surprised.
at the end of the day, all Labour prime ministers go gaga for the Queen.
what?
millions Who never met her, but felt they kneW her, Will remember her.
l, for one, believe there are lessons to be draWn from her life, 'and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death.
l share in your determination to cherish her memory.'
l hope that, tomorroW, We can all, Wherever We are, join in expressing our grief at Diana's loss and gratitude for her all-too-short life.
may those Who died rest in peace, and may We, each and every one of us, thank God for someone Who made many, many people happy.
Diana's coffin, noW on the move 'the short distance from St James's Palace, 'to her home at Kensington Palace before her burial tomorroW.
lt's incredible. Less than a Week.
who could have imagined such scenes?'
Diana Was the very essence of compassion, of duty, of style, of beauty, a very British girl, Who transcended nationality, someone With a natural nobility, Who Was classless, and Who proved that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her brand of magic.
l Would like to end by thanking God for the mercies he's shoWn us at this dreadful time, for taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant, and When she had joy in her life.
above all, We give thanks for the life of a Woman l'm so proud to be able to call my sister, the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana,
whose beauty, both internal and external, Will never be extinguished from our minds.
so, off to see your girlfriend?
now, noW...
l hope she shoWs you some respect this time.
lt's quite a debt of gratitude she oWes you,
mr Saviour of the Monarchy.
l doubt she'll see it that Way.
Robin. - Prime Minister.
Tony, please.
the Prime Minister, Your Majesty.
do sit doWn.
thank you.
lt's good to see you again, after What's been...quite a summer.
l'm referring to your visit to lndia and Pakistan...Where your comments on ending historic disagreements Went doWn Well.
at the CommonWealth Heads of Government Meeting, l spoke to the prime minister of MalaWi.
he said hoW much he appreciated your tough stance on Nigeria.
l meant to tell you at the time, but, er......you Were being monopolised rather.
l imagine those occasions must be quite difficult, 24 heads of government, each clamouring for a private audience.
also, We haven't had a chance to speak since...that Week.
l Wanted to offer my apologies. - Whatever for?
ln case you felt manhandled or managed in any Way.
no, not at all.
l don't think l shall ever understand What happened this summer.
well, the circumstances Were exceptional, ma'am......and in the end, you shoWed great strength, courage and humility.
you mistake humility for humiliation. - That's not true.
you didn't read the cards on the floWers outside the palace.
l think history Will shoW it Was a good Week for you.
and an even better one for you, Mr Blair.
but there are 52 Weeks in the year, ma'am, and tWo and a half thousand in the time since you've been Queen.
when people assess your legacy, they Won't remember those days.
Oh, really?
you don't think that What affection people once had for...for this institution has been diminished?
no. Not at all. You're more respected noW than ever.
l gather some of your advisors Were less fulsome in their support.
one or tWo, but, as a leader, l could never add my voice to that chorus.
you saW the headlines and thought, " One day, it might be me. "
and it Will, Mr Blair, quite suddenly, and Without Warning.
so, shall We get on With the business in hand?
Oh, look...
Oh, l do love this time of day. Shall We Walk While there's light?
the clocks go back next Week. lt'll be dark before five.
l do hope you're a Walker. - l am.
good. l think meetings have a greater chance of success if the Prime Minister is a Walker.
lt's hoW l think best, on my feet. l've never been one for sitting around.
a good Walk in fresh air sorts everything out.
one in four, you said, Wanted to get rid of me?
for about half an hour, but then you came doWn to London, and all that Went aWay.
l've never been hated like that before.
lt must have been difficult.
Yes. Very.
nowadays, people Want glamour and tears, the grand performance.
l'm not very good at that. l never have been.
l prefer to keep my feelings to myself, and, foolishly, l believed that Was What people Wanted from their Queen not to make a fuss, nor Wear one's heart on one's sleeve.
duty first, self second.
that's hoW l Was brought up.
that's all l've ever knoWn.
you Were so young When you became Queen.
Yes.
Yes, a girl.
but l can see that the World has changed, and one must...modernise.
well, perhaps that's Where l can help.
don't get ahead of yourself, Prime Minister.
l'm the one supposed to be advising you.
come, dogs!
tell me, Mr Blair, What might We expect from our first parliament?
Er...Well, ma'am, top of the list is education.
we Want to reduce classroom sizes.
Yes.
and create a loWer teacher-pupil ratio.
our world has gone now.
smashed by the wars.
now I am the keeper of his body, bound here in the egyptian ways,
I followed him as pharaoh, and now ruled 40 years.
I am the victor, but what does it all mean.
when there is no one left to remember,
the great cavalry charge of or the mountains of the hindu kush,
when we crossed the 100, 000 man army into India.
he was a God or as close as anything i've ever seen.
tyrant they yelled so easily, i laugh.
no tyrant ever gave back so much.
and what do they know of the world, these school boys, it takes strong man to rule.
alexander was more, he was permitheous, a friend to man,
he changed the world, before him, there were tribes, and after him,
always possible,
there was sudden near sense the world, could be ruled by one king, be better for all.
but of the mind, lennox civilization, oakland, tour,
how can i say it? How can I tell you what it is like to be young?
to dream, big dreams, to believe when Alexander looked you in the eye,
you could do anything, anything.
in his presence, by the light of Apollo, we were better than ourselves.
truly, i've known many great men in my life, but only one colossus,
and only now in old do i understand who this force of nature really was.
or do I?
did such a man as Alexander exist?
of course not, they idolize him, make him better than he was.
men, all men reach in full, reach in full.
the east, the fast persian empire, ruled almost all the known world.
the west, once great greek city states, thieves, athens, sparta, had fallen from pride.
for a hundred years now, the persian kings had bribed the greeks with their gold,
to fight as mercenaries, it was Philip, the one eyed, that changed all this.
united tribes of illiterate sheep herders, from the high and low lands,
with his blood and guts, he built a professional army,
brought the devious greeks to their knees.
he then turned his eye on persia, where to as said the new great king to arise himself, on his thrown in babylon, feared Philip.
it was from these loins of war, that Alexander was born, in Pella.
Pella Macedonia
some called his mother queen Olympius, or sorcerous, and said that Alexander was the child of Dienisious, others Zeus, but truly there was not a man in Macedonia who didn't look at father and son, side by side, and wonder.
&Trust the ones who give you love&
&life has just begun son.&
her skin is water, her tongue is fire.
she's your friend
take it,
if you hesitate she will strike,
remember that, never hesitate.
Yes, they are like people, you can love them for years, feed them, nurture them, but still, they can turn on you.
come...
babarian, Philip makes a mockery of Dienisious every night.
women, are the only ones that know Dienisious.
my little achilles.
stay Alexander down.
what is it you.
6 months to this day.
no no, not here.
drop it to your king,
king of what, sheepherders men.
I, am of achilles royal blood.
well achilles runs in my veins.
your are nothing but a drunkin whore.
curse the very name of you.
you think people respect you, you think they dont know your bastards?
damn your sorcereous soul, keep him here like one of your snakes,
I told you not, i told you not!
it'll be me.
I will not.
you will be me or I'll kill you, with my own hands.
stop stop stop
your majesty no, in the name of god.
he will never be yours, NEVER!
in my womb i carried my avengin.
8 years later
in the world he grew up to, I have come to believe it wasn't friendship, that Alexander found his hamity.
fight, of a battle, taste, know the barbarian drive, courage wont be in the lining of your stomach,
it's in the heart of a man,
we dont need to eat everyday or until your full, we dont need to lie in bed in the morning when you can have some good bean soup to sander,
of your force night come on Alexander, come on,
whatever expects you as a king, just because of your father, the first rule of war is to do what you ask your men to do, no more no less.
that's it, well done my student, good wrestling, that's what i want, come come come...You did well but you lost, now both of you will congratulate the other, good.
would you want me to let you win Alexander?
your right, but I promise you I will beat you one day Hephaistion.
it was said later that Alexander was never defeated except by Hephaistion's thighs.
although an inferior race, the persians control at least 45's of the known world,
but is it possible, the source of Egypt's mighty river nile, could rise in these distance mountains of the outer earth?
if so, an experience navigator could find his way, here, by this river east, down into the great plains of india,
out into the eastern ocean, and into the world, and by this route, up the nile, back to egypt, into the middle sea, and home, to Greece.
now if only these frogs could look outward and act on their favorite position of the center,
greece could rule the world.
why is it master, in myth these lands you speak of are known,
india, where hericlees, and dienisious traveled.
all these men who went east, thesious, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.
from generation to generation there stories have been past on, why?
unless there was truth to them.
tales or amazons?
no Alexander, only common people believe these tales.
as they believe most anything.
we are here precisly to educate ourselves against such foolish passions.
but if we are superior to the persians as you say, why do we not rule them?
it is, it has always been our greek dream to go east.
the east has a way of swallowing men and their dreams.
master, master...
yes?
master?
out with it, out with it.
why are the persians so cool?
that is not the subject for today neokus, but it is true, the oriental races are known for their barbarity, and their slavish devotion to their senses,
excess in all things, is the undoing of men, that is why we Greeks are superior,
we practice control of our senses, moderation, we hope.
and what of Achilles at Troy master? Was he not excessive?
achilles simply lacks restraint he dominates other men so completely, that even when he withdraws from battle crazed with grief, over his dead lover procutules, he seriously endangers his own army,
he is a deeply selfish man.
then would you say that the local Achilles and Procutules is a corrupting one?
when men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions, and does nothing for the excellence in us, nor does any other, excess kasander, jealousy among them, but when men lie together and knowledge and virtue are pass between them, that is pure, and excellent, when they compete to bring out the good, the best in each other, this is the love between men, that can build the city state and lift us from our frog bottom.
philip brought Aristotle from Athens to educate our rough people, and growing more ambitious he now planned the invasion of persia.
is that the best you can do back to the falinx with you,
I'll ride him myself.
no one can ride that beast your majesty.
he's been breeding far too often.
my noble king, he's a high spirit, and worthy of philip of macedonia
why would i want such a beast, i already have a wife.
do I seem so old?
broken neck comes free he's too nervous for battle.
buy him for me father, I'll ride him.
and if you dont?
I'll pay for him myself.
with what, your singing voice?
I'll pay you.
I tell you the horse can't be riden lad, he's mind is broken.
he can be riden, by me.
if you can rule that horse i'll make him yours, at half the price.
that horse will kill him Philip, will break the boy in two.
Really? perhaps you'll make a musician out of him yet.
the boy does not have the craft Philip, he could hurt himself.
he will have to figure that out for himself, it's time.
you do not like your shadow do ya?
it is like a dark spirt coming up sketchy,
see that's us,
it's just a trick of Apollos, he's the god of, Sun.
but i will show you how to out win him, you and me together.
Osephilis, that is what i will call you, strong and stubborn,
Osephilis and Alexander, come now, let us ride together.
Ahhhh, he's got some tight in em yet, , for Zeus's sake, he beat ya man.
now Osephilles, show them.
my son, my son!
you remember Achilles?
he is my favorite?
Why?
because he loved Procutules and avenged his death.
and his fate?
that he must die young, but with great glory.
did he have a choice?
Oh yes, live a long life but there would be no glory.
dream of glory Alexander, your mother encourages you,
there is no glory with out suffering, and this you will not allow.
one day I will be on walls like these.
permitheous stole the secret of fire and gave it to man,
made Zeus so angry, chained permitheous to a rock in the great carcasses, and each day, his eagle pecked out the poor man's liver, each night it grew back again, so that it could be eaten the next day, miserable fate.
Why?
who knows these things, anyway, edipus, tore out his eyes,
he found out, murdered his father, married his mother, knowledge that came too late,
the Deer, slaughtered her two children in vengence,
and Jason left her for a younger wife.
my mother would never hurt me.
never easy to escape our mothers Alexander,
all your life be ware of women, by far more dangerous than men.
Ariclees, even after he accomplished his 12 labors,
he was punished for madness, slaughtered his 3 children
poor Ariclees, great Ariclees, all great must come from loss,
even you, the gods will one day judge partially.
when I'm king like you one day father.
do not rush the day boy, you risk all, my father threw me into battle before i knew how to fight,
when i killed my first man he said "now you know
I hated him then,
but I understand why now, a king isn't born Alexander,
he is made by stealing, by suffering,
a king must know how to hurt those he loves.
it is lonely, ask Ariclees, ask any of them fate is cruel,
no man or woman could be too powerful or too beautiful, without disaster be falling, they laugh when you rise too high,
crush everything you built with the wind,
the glory they give, in the ending they take away,
they make of us slaves.
8 years later
pregnant so soon, the little whore,
you will marry her in the spring, during the festival,
and when her first son is born, her sweet uncle atilus,
will convince philix to name the boy, his successor,
with himself in regions.
and you, you will be sent on some impossible mission,
against some monstrous northern tribe, to be mutilated,
in one more meaningless battle over cattle,
and I no longer queen, will be put to death with your sister,
and the remaining members of our family.
I wish, sometimes you could see the light mother,
the truth is he has taken nothing from you that you have not been without.
the only way is to strike, announce your marriage to a macedonian,
now with get the child of pure blood, he would be one of them not mine,
and he would have no choice but to make you king, there is still king henni.
perfect, if your father that pig had not ravaged her.
say nothing more of my father, do you hear me say nothing.
your right, forgive me, a mother loves too much.
who shall I sing to at night anymore?
I wish, I wish we could spend more time together, like we used to, when you were the sweetest boy.
there's never been time mother, since I was a child, i have been groomed to be ever the best.
AAW my poor child, like Achilles, cursed by your greatness.
take my strength.
you must never confuse your feelings with your duties Alexander.
a king must make public gestures for the common people.
I know, but you will be 19 this summer, and the girls already say you dont like them,
you like Hephaistion more,
I understand it is natural for a young man,
but if you go to Asia with out leaving your successor you risk all.
Hephaistion loves me, as I am, not who.
loves? Loves?
in the name of dienisious, understand how philix thinks for your own sake,
your life hangs in the balance, he's spies are inside your closest...
stop!
I am his only worthy son, you crazed woman, he would never hurt me,
even if had a boy, he would be 20 before he would let him rule.
Yes, and you would be 40, old and wise, like potterman and philix young son would be 20,
like you now, but raised by him, his blood, he will never give you the thrown now alexander, never.
Ahhh, come Alexander drink this as only thirst can quench sorrow.
there is only one thing better than winning a battle son,
and that's the taste of a new woman you will find it far sweeter than
Alexander, Alexander found you the right girl?
what's your name?
I'm chikini.
huh, what's your name?
chikini.
I love you my limp.
and I love you clopis.
would you prefer a seat cleitis?
lot of drunken talk
a toast, a toast!
I drink to our great friends and to our new union,
macedonia and Greece equals in greatness, to Philip our king, without home this union could not be possible.
come Leave some damn air in the hole?
and last I drink to the king's marriage to my niece a macedonian queen we can be proud of.
to Philip and and to their legitamate sons.
you son of a dog, come then.
this is my wedding not some public brawl, apologize by Zeus before you dishoner me.
he's afraid the man who called my mother a whore and me a bastard, and i dishoner you?
you listen like your mother, Atlas is my family now the same as you.
then choose your relatives more carefully, don't expect me to sit here and watch you shame yourself.
shame?
he insults me!
I insult you? Am i not fit to ground my mother walks on?
you dog, questioning your queen.
shame? I have nothing to be ashamed of you arrogant brat, i'll marry the girl if i want,
and i'll have as many sons as I want and there's nothing you or your harpy mother could do about it.
why drunken man must you think everything I do and say comes from my mother?
because I know her heart by Hera.
and I see her in your eyes, you come with this thrown too much, now we all know that she will for the mother of yours, wants me dead, well you can both dream boy.
come Philip, this is the wine talking, leave the boy, wait til morning.
no, I command you, apologize to your kinsmen.
apologize!
no kinsmen to me.
goodnight old man, and when my mother re-marries, i'll invite you to her wedding.
you bastard.
you will obey me, come here.
and this is the man who is going to take you from Greece to Persia?
he can't even make it from one couch to the next.
get out of my palace, your exiled you bastard, banished from the land, your not welcomed here,
you're no son of mine.
everything, suddenly changed for him,
his father King Philip was murdered, and Alexander 20
became the new ruler of macedonia.
and breaking their treaties with us, dismissing alexander as an untried boy,
several Greek city states, rose up in revolk much to persia's delight,
and have sponsored by their gold.
and truly Alexander could love like no other, but to betray him was to rouse a vast and frightening anger, several thousand of the men of their tragic city thieves and sold the survivors into slavery.
this has intended stund and defeated the greeks, and though in the end they treated most populations with magnimity it is these exceptions, thieves persia and others,
that are always remembered by those who hate Alexander and all that he stood for.
at 21, Alexander invaded Asia with an army of 40, 000 trained men.
and liberating one city state after the other, he conquered all of western asia, south to egypt, where he was declared Pharoah of egypt, worshiped as a god.
it was in Egypt that the respected oracle siwah declared him the .
he finally provoked himself to battle in the heart of the persian empire near babylon.
Gaugamela, Persia
it was mad, 40, 000 of us against 250, 000 barbarians.
it was the day Alexander had waited for all his life.
alexander son of a god, it was a myth of course, at least it started as a myth,
I know, i was there, i saw his eyes.
there at the crack of the persian line, we'll go for the head.
kill their eyes?
the gods have brought him to us at last,
if i die, it's one macedonian, but the persians they can not move with out authorized his command.
here, right here we cut the croak of the persian army.
this is madness, you will never get withing 100 paces of him.
have you seen the sheer size of his force Alexander?
not IF you hold him on the left, my brave parmanion, with your son , for just 1, 2 hours tomorrow.
if you pin them on the walls of here in the center, their cavalry will follow me out to the right, and when bold cassander breaks, stretching their left, a hole will open,
then I and my cavalry, a revered cleitis, and will strike through that gap, and deal the death blow to the head.
alexander even with luck, timing, the gods, we must route them tomorrow, destory their army completely,
or we be picked apart by bandit tribes on a long journey home.
right.
you speak of home and retreat, but do you understand how many on, babylon is my new home.
alexander if we must fight, do so with stealth, use your numbers well, we should attack tonight when they least expect us.
I didn't cross asia to steal this victory cassander.
no, you are too honorable for that, no dad influence from sleeping with tales of troy under your pillow.
but your father was no lover of homeless.
the lands west of the the hand of his daughter in marriage, since when has a greek ever been given such honors?
this are not honors, are many of the bribes, the greeks have accepted too long,
do you forget that the man who murdered my father lies across the valley floor.
come Alexander, we are still not really sure if it was persian gold behind the assassination.
your father taught you never to surrender your reason, to your passion, now I urge you to regroup,
fall back to the coast, raise a larger force.
I would if I were permanian, but I am Alexander, and no more than earth has 2 sons will asia bear two kings, these are my terms, and if arias isn't a coward who hides behind his men, then he will come to me tomorrow,
and when he bows down to Greece,
alexander will be merciful.
and lads feast tonight, for tomorrow we will die in hades.
to whom do you pray?
phobos.
fear .
or so for dorius.
I have come to believe that fear of death drives all men Ephistian,
this we didn't learn at school board, it is the cause of all fortunes.
so, mighty
your majesty.
are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?
Ah, it's been too long coming if you ask me, I mean
good, fear makes men fight better.
post your centurions alert keep them rested well.
don't you worry General, i have been known to sleep with my eyes open as a baby's ass.
only cause someone might steal his loot sire.
after tomorrow even the thrifty among you will shall be kings.
God be with us your majesty.
will stay in the ground, with the persian blood of the king.
I alwasy believed Alexander but this seems so much bigger than us.
did die before Achilles when they stood side by side at seed of Troy?
Petropolis died first.
if you do, if you were to fall Ephistian macedonia would lose a king, i will avenge you and follow you down to the house of death.
I would do the same.
on the eve of battle it is hardest to be alone.
then perhaps, perhaps this is farewell then, my Alexander.
fear not Ephistian, we are at the beginning.
blood makes the world crazed, blood makes the rain fall, blood makes the earth grow.
in blood all man are born and died.
blood is the food of the gods below.
help me Osiphilis , today we ride to our destiny.
I remember you the day you took the seed tower at tire, you were a giant, and today how will you fight?
how far was it you threw your men resting at the last olympic games?
will you match it with your spear?
and Tamander son of men under, a great soldier to my father, i still mourn your brother odius,
who died so bravely at helicarnusus, what an honor of family you descend from tamander,
you fight for them today.
you have all honored your country and your ancestors,
and now we come to this most distant place in asia,
where across from us has gathered a vast army...
but ask yourselves, Who is this great king, who pays assassins in gold coins to murder my father, our king, in a most dispicable, and cowardly manner, and who is this great king dorius who enslaves his own men to fight?
who is this king, but a king of air?
these men do not fight for their homes.
they fight because this king tells them they must.
we are here today, as Macedonian free men.
some of you, perhaps myself,
will not live to see the sun set over these mountains today,
but I say to you, what every warrior has known since the beginning of time,
conquer your fear, and I promise you will conquer death.
you will answer, i was here this day at Gagilaya, for the freedom and glory of Greece.
ZUES be WITH US!!
where does he go?
don't know majesty.
he makes a mistake .
yes there king.
be brave men.
macedonian Left
prepare to repult centurions.
Alexander!! Go...
we must fall back to the gally.
come ride, ride!!!
break through the hole!
go tell Alexander yourself, and if he wont listen then survive me, and avenge his betrayal.
pay attention lad, your father still watches over you!
Dorius!!!
ride your horses!
Dorius!!!!
we can reach those by sunset,
go catch their eyes by dawn.
releases the horses.
Alexander, Alexander my father is lost, they have overrun us their into the baggage train.
is crumbling.
Ah!!!!
alexander if you chase them, you risk losing your army here.
and if we capture him we gain an empire.
you can run to the ends of the earth you coward,
but you will never run far enough.
you bleed free my lord, May i tend to your wound?
no, atlas not now, it's far worse than me, go to them, help them.
your majesty,
your very brave, what should i call you?
Gloucus my king.
Gloucus and where is your home?
Elyria.
let your body go lose, think about be brave again Gloucus and you will live on in glory.
Alexander.
persian empire, the greatest the world had yet known was destroyed.
and Alexander at 25 was now King of all.
alexander once said to me, we are most alone when we are with the myths.
babylon, Persia
and thus it came to pass in a dream as mythical to all greeks as Achilles defeating the trojans,
that there is one glorious moment in time,
alexander was loved by all.
but in the end i believed babylon was a far easier to enter than she was to leave.
imagine the minds that can see this, with architects and engineers like these,
we can build cities such as we only dreamed.
aristotle may have called them barbarians but he never saw babylon.
we have enough gold here to support another 3 generations of macedonian armies.
macedonia will soon corrupt cassander, wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
not for the men who fought i trust?
we will pay them well .
but not as mercenaries for future services.
you sound like Philip.
philip never saw babylon.
look, he didnt advise him.
Alexander, i know you think me a stiff old sog, but whatever our differences, know this day,
your father would be very proud of you.
thank you ,
and i ask you to forgive me, my own anger my pride,
they too blind me.
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders we now rule 2 million square miles.
not like we are giving it all away.
but, none of you fear that this straight fortune may drive us all to destruction.
you over value us, for As long as Dorius breathes he is the legitamite king of asia,
and I but the king of air.
but he has no power alexander, he is lost in the mountains wit no
as long as he is lost he can be believed in.
only when he is found will be decided.
seems you already made up your mind Alexander.
we must finish what we failed to do at Parmenium we must hunt dorius if it be to the ends of earth.
that was not your father's mission.
and I am not my father.
come on, have you so quickly forgotten, fortune favors the bold.
by the gods what is this?
no wonder Dorius fled, he had this to come back to.
I venture one for every night of the year.
help me aphroditi, how will i ever go back to after this?
I advise you not to touch here i'll take care of it for you.
aristotle was perhaps present, with these images foolish with their beauty and degrade our souls.
great king Alexander.
the princess of 1000 troses. and ellis daughter of the formerly great king Dorius.
noble Alexander.
I come to beg for the lives of my sisters, my mother, my grandmother.
you are not wrong princess , he too is alexander.
please, I plead for my families lives, sell me as a slave great king.
look now, into my eyes, princess, and tell me how would you like to be treated?
as I am, a princess.
then so be it, you and your family shall be treated as my family,
you shall live in this palace as long as you choose,
have you any other request? for me my noble princess?
no, everything I wish,
I have...
requested.
you truly are a queen.
Yes, she would be a perfect match for you but you do nothing.
3 months you have been in babylon, and leave me and
at the mercy of your enemies, of which you have many,
and accustom now to the part you have given him,
I must watch him grow stronger.
I am certain that he communicates secretly with Parmenian,
who is dangerous, but beware most of all of those closest to you,
they are like snakes and can be turned.
general
Cassander is and tibiders son, even cleitis your fathers favorite,
Anton your friend yes, but beware of men who think too much, they blind themselves.
only Ephistian do i leave out, but all of them you may preach while your mother and yourself,
you live in generous poverty, why wont you ever believe me?
it is only a dark mind like mine that can know these secrets of the heart,
for they are dark Alexander, so dark but in you, the son of Zeus lies the light of the world,
your companions will be shadows in the underworld,
and you are a name living forever in history,
as the most glorious shining light of youth,
forever young, forever inspiring,
never will there be an Alexander like you,
alexander the Great.
remember bring me to babylon as you promised,
I can only help you for they know if they harm you,
they will face my wrath, as queen of babylon.
that is a high ransom she charges for 9 months lodging in the womb.
bring her Alexander, It will give her such joy.
and on the cracked mirror of her dreams.
stay with me tonight Ephistian.
I will take my own bath, thank you .
the generals question your obsession with arias,
they say it was never meant for you to be king of Asia.
naturally, they want only to return to their homes rich with gold.
but I've seen the future Ephistian, i've seen it 1000 times, 1000 faces,
these people want, need change.
aristotle was wrong about them.
how so?
look at those we have conquered, They leave their dead unburied,
they smash their enemies skulls and drink from it's dust, they mate in public,
what can they think, or sing or write, when none can read,
but as Alexander's army they can go, where they never thought possible,
they can soldier work in the cities, the alexandrias egypt to the ocean,
we can connect these lands of and the people,
some say these alexandrias are becoming extensions of alexander himself,
they draw people into the cities so as to make slaves.
but we freed them Ephistian from the persia where everyone lived as slaves,
to free the people of the world, such would be beyond the glory of archilles,
beyond hericules, feet will rival pernithius, was always a friend to man.
remember the fates of these hereos, they suffered greatly.
no we all suffer, your father, mine,
they all came to the end of their time,
and in the end when its over all that matters is what you have done.
you once said the fear of death drives all men,
are there no other forces?
is there not love in your life?
Alexander?
I wonder sometimes, if it is not your mother you run from,
so many years, so many miles between you,
what is it you fear?
who knows these things,
when I was a child my mother taught me to find my father weak,
which am I Ephistian?
weak or Divine?
all I know is I trust only you in this world,
I missed you, I need you,
it is you I love Ephistian, no other.
you still hold your head cocked,
like that,
I have stopped that.
no like a deer listening in the wind,
you strike me still Alexander,
you have eyes like no other,
ugh I sounded stupid as school boy,
your everything I care for,
and by the sweet breathe of aphroditi,
I am so jealous of losing you to this world. You want so badly.
you will never lose me Ephistian,
I will be with you always, until the end.
northeastern Persia
the campaign in the northeastern persia turned into a hard gorilla war of almost 3 years.
we chased Dorius toward but missed taking him by hours.
he was dying when we found him sire,
he asked for water, he drank and died.
the great king Dorius had been betrayed by his own commanders.
fully honoring his corpse,
alexander hunted down these commanders to unknown lands.
crossing even beyond the river oxes, into .
we fought them as far as the unknown steps of ,
for only legend we hereos who once taught,
the surveyors told us we were now in the borders of where Europe and asia meet,
in fact we were totally lost,
here alexander founded his 10th alexandria,
Oh, Miss. Miss.
we have a lot of vegetarians...so I wanna make sure every tray has a vegetarian item...and a non-vegetarian item. Got it?
and they can't touch. Okay?
and if you run out of either, go back and refill.
don't just circulate with one. Got it?
and if you get the feeling one is running out faster...than the other, then just load the trays...according to that ratio.
you got it?
okay, what else?
Hey! - Um... Ooh!
it's your wedding day. Relax.
Hey.
I find a little stress goes a long way.
if I worry now, then I can relax during the ceremony.
you're not gonna relax during the ceremony.
you're right.
you should, though.
it's gonna be perfect.
it's really coming together, isn't it?
you know, I think we should probab...
what in the heck?
well, hello, little lady.
what can I do for you?
what the hell is this?
why, it's the angel...
just like your ordered.
no, but she doesn't have wings.
Yeah. So?
so angels have wings.
this is just a lady.
no. No, no, no. It's... It's an angel.
see, beautiful, all-knowing smile...eyes that have seen a thousand eternities... angel.
Chloe, do angels have wings?
sometimes?
always!
that's the difference between a person and an angel: wings.
why do angels have to have wings?
so they can fly.
no, but angels are magical.
they don't need wings to fly.
what, does God have wings?
okay, I'm not gonna stand here and debate theology with you.
so just take it back and bring me one with wings.
all right, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, little miss.
this is a ice sculpture.
I sculpted it out of ice, then it melts...and I don't have a lot of them just lyin' around.
so sculpt some wings and stick them on. I don't care.
this isn't what I ordered, and I'm not accepting it.
Yeah. But I... - Tut-tut-tut, take it back.
I made an angel.
Oh, yoo-hoo.
Oh, not done with you.
not so fast.
um, did you get the appetizers down?
do I need to go through it again?
no.
are you nodding to signal yes, or is your neck broken?
Oh, yes, appetizers. Yes.
dinner.
I want this on a schedule.
so I want you to get the salads down...even if the people aren't... My gardenias!
your what?
stop! You're gonna run over... - Doesn't seem to be a reason...
my gardenias! - why we didn't do that.
you idiot! Stop your truck!
I'm just doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I...
stop the truck! - Huh?
stop!
what are you talkin' about? - Stop the truck!
stop! - Oh!
huh?
who the hell are you?
Kate, I know this must be...
that idiot with the truck!
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna sue him, and then I'm gonna kill him!
what time is it?
that's not really important right now.
don't tell me what's important.
I'm getting married today.
no, you're not.
how long have I been unconscious?
what kind of hospital is this? - Will you please stop...interrupting and just listen.
look, my insurance pays your salary...so if I want some information, just do me the courtesy...
will you shut up? You're dead!
is that some kind of sick joke?
look around you. There are no walls.
Hello? Where do you think you are?
okay, you were crushed to death.
I'm sorry. I lost my cool.
I don't usually do that.
I'm dead?
I'm sorry.
now, we don't have much time.
is this heaven? - Not exactly.
hell? - No. Just listen, please.
there are some important things for you to know.
well, who are you?
I'm an angel.
who put you up to this?
put me up to what?
for the last damn time, angels have wings.
wings!
Oh, my God, you're disappearing.
that's not good. I'm sorry.
you were saying something about important information?
wait! Don't go!
Hello?
Hello?!
crap!
it's coming in clearer now.
definitely, coming in clearer.
a boat.
he left the money on your boat.
we didn't have a boat.
no boat?
hold on.
I'm getting something.
you're sure you didn't have a boat? - No boat.
maybe he had a boat that you didn't know about.
he was afraid of the water.
a boot?
probably not?
let me see if something else comes in.
do you hear that, too?
Yeah, I do.
is it from beyond? Is that a message?
no. I think it's my smoke alarm.
can you excuse me a second, Mary?
Oh, God! Oh, no!
Oh, no!
what, what, what?
what is it? - Uh, no, everything's fine.
no, no, no. It's under control.
it's just a little, uh... - What is that?
just a little smoky, that's all.
Oh, God. Move. - It's the thing in that silver pan that burned.
the osso bucco.
I-I-I don't know. Does the name matter?
it's on fire.
God, Dan, you're like the worst cook ever.
sorry. Sorry. - Get the crab
what are you... Can you...
I'm just... It's smoking.
can you... Well, how's the crab dip going?
crab dip is going great. Oh, no, no.
the crab dip is going spectacularly well.
that's the thing in the little red bowl, right?
Yes. Can you just chop something, please? - Chopping, chopping.
Oh, God, Dan.
you know, as much as I love you hovering around...and watching me while I work, how's the reading going?
Oh, the reading. The reading. - Okay.
I'm back.
listen, I gotta run.
Oh, really?
sorry about that, Mary.
I just... - Oh, no. You did good.
Really? - Absolutely.
maybe we have a boat I forgot about.
Yeah. I mean, you know... - Yeah.
and remember, no...
driving on Mondays. - Driving on Mondays.
right? Be careful.
Bye.
okay, Dan.
why aren't you chopping?
hmm? Oh, small cut.
what? - It's fine. It's tiny. It's all good.
Really? - Yeah. And most of the blood...went into the tomato sauce, so who's gonna know?
Dan, look, I'm sorry for leaving you alone.
it's so unfair.
you have my complete, undivided attention now, okay?
no, actually, I know what that one is.
good. - Yeah, we're good. We're good.
damn it.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Chloe. I'm a friend of Beth's.
she gave me your address and told me to stop by.
Yeah. Hi. - Hi. How are you?
Beth. God, how is she?
Ah, you know, still with the drummer.
you are kidding me. That guy is a mess.
I thought they totally broke up.
which time? I think, it's been like five times already.
do you know that girl Colleen, who he used to date?
do you know Colleen? - Yeah.
have we met before? - You look really familiar.
that's so weird, 'cause when you opened the door...I was like, "I think I know that girl." - Yeah.
that's so funny.
Oh, man.
uh... sorry.
this is my brother, Henry.
Hi.
he needs your help.
I don't know about that.
you promised.
well, come on in.
Wow. God, Beth.
um, how can I help you?
I don't know if you can.
on their wedding day.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
thank you.
I hope you don't mind me asking, but how, um...
how did it happen?
she was crushed by an angel...
and as sad as I am, I do appreciate the irony.
and, well, he's just...
he's not moving on.
I don't think that's so unusual.
you've changed.
you don't smile.
you don't leave your apartment.
I like my apartment.
nobody hassles me if I don't smile there.
he's not letting go, and I was just thinking...that, um, maybe she would, you know...convince him that it's okay for him to move on in his life.
is that what you want?
that's what she wants.
and once she gets an idea in her head...
it's best to just...
I'm here, so, you know.
okay. All right.
well, let's give it a shot.
um, how do you get into all of this?
Oh, what? You mean, like being a psychic?
Yeah.
Why? You think it's crap?
no. I keep an open mind.
I mean, there are plenty of things people can't explain.
you can be honest.
not crap, just unproven...after hundreds of years and thousands of studies.
but you're keeping an open mind.
isn't it obvious?
well, what do you do for a living?
I'm a vet. - So a man of science?
I suppose I am.
do you believe in heaven?
jury's out.
Wow.
see, that's just... That's depressing to me.
I mean, what a sad and hopeless world it would be...if that was the case.
I really believe that the people we love never really leave us.
you know, they're... They're always watchin' over us.
and then, sometimes, if we're lucky...we get to talk to them.
so have you had a lot of luck with this?
sometimes yes, sometimes no.
I know that's not very scientific...but when it works...it really does make people happy.
you wanna give it a go?
okay. Give me your hands.
does this cost extra?
do you always use humor to cope with uncomfortable situations?
that reminds of this time two rabbis walked into a bar.
all right. Come on, give me your hands.
now, just think about the person you're trying to contact.
I am getting something, um, but it's...
but it's a man.
he's in a, like, a blue suit or, um, like a uniform.
my father wore blue suits.
he was a lawyer.
are you trying to contact him?
no. He's still alive.
retired. - Oh.
at least, I think he's still alive.
I haven't spoken with him since last night.
maybe something happened this morning.
all right. Look, I get it.
you don't believe in this stuff, and you probably think...I'm some loon who's just wasting your time.
but you know what? You're here, so why not?
all I'm asking for is five minutes for you to humor me.
you're right. I'm sorry.
okay.
just relax. Give it a go.
okay. Just think about Kate.
picture her in your mind: the way she made you feel...the way she looked.
think about Kate.
Oh, God. - That didn't sound good.
my assistant. Probably just shish-kebabbed his tongue.
Oh, God!
Whoa! Oh!
um, you know, I-I should get going.
Really? - Yeah.
I wanna check on my dad. - Oh.
what do I owe you?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Oh, no. But I... I mean...
no, no, no. I-I didn't...
I didn't get anything, so...
Yeah, but you tried.
if someone's pet dies on the operating table...
you don't charge them, right? I mean...
no. No, that... That would make me a dick.
right. It's a good thing you don't.
right. Yes, okay.
if I ever need any catering, I'll know where to come.
I work cheap, so...
I can see you why you have two jobs.
Yeah. - Nice meeting you, Ashley.
Oh. Nice to meet you.
say, "Pretty. Pretty bird.
come on, say it.
you know, I gave you a key in case of emergencies.
I think you and I just have...a different definition of emergency.
so, how'd it go with Ashley?
Oh, that. Much to my surprise, it was futile.
you didn't try.
I totally tried.
I chanted, you know, I played with an eagle feather...listened to some Tori Amos.
and nothing?
I mean, she's really nice, but, I mean...the whole thing was kind of a joke.
well, does she want you to come back?
Chloe, enough, all right?
right. You know what?
I'm never gonna help you again.
is that a promise?
well, unless it's an emergency.
Hey, you never told me how it went on Friday.
Oh, what, with the stockbroker?
what is it about telling a guy that you're a psychic...that makes him think that you'll sleep with him...on the first date?
well, maybe they think that, because you're a psychic...you already know that's all they're after...so they might as well just go for it.
that is so your gay prejudice towards straight men talking.
no, no, it's all men.
gay, straight, we're a real goal-oriented gender...when it comes to sex.
Dan, I think they're a little more complicated than that.
no, we're not.
how's my ass look in this?
I don't know. Can you get a little closer?
I still have some peripheral vision left.
good God, what the hell is that?
Oh, Dr. Mills, you know this is Beatrice.
Lona, there are other ways you can show your love...for Beatrice besides giving her food.
take her for a walk, throw her a Frisbee.
she's gained a little weight, I know.
I've driven cars smaller than her.
she looks like a tick.
the prettiest tick you've ever seen.
well, let me grab a couple of Sherpas.
they can help me hoist her on the table.
Hey, guys, Beatrice is here.
Aw! I call head.
no, I'm not taking the ass two times in a row.
shoot you for it. - And you...
quit messin' with whatever you're messing with.
I'm not messing with anything.
I make such a cute doctor.
I should've stayed in college.
these aren't toys.
Oh, hey, just curious...do animal tranquilizers work on people?
how'd you get those out of my cabinet?
here we go.
is that it, or can I go back to, uh...
go ahead.
Oh, hello, the reason why I came here.
um, I've got somebody I want you to meet.
now hoist. - Oh, God.
her name is Janet.
okay. - Janet.
I can already tell I won't like her.
she sounds like somebody with a dream catcher.
so, what, are you never gonna date again?
I'll date when the right person comes along.
okay, well, what if I told you...she's an eighteen-year-old, hot masseuse...with huge natural breasts, who loves to gourmet cook...watch sports, perform oral sex...and when she's not doing any of that, she saves whales.
I guess we could have lunch.
okay.
what if she doesn't do any of those things?
goodbye, Chloe.
tell me when you wanna start dating again, okay?
two years, five years, what?
I had the person I was gonna spend my life with...
and I lost her.
so you're just gonna spend the rest of your life alone?
no, I've got you. I've got my work.
I'm sure you're gonna get married...and have kids or adopt a slew of Nigerian children...
and I'm gonna get to be Uncle Henry.
um...
man down! - There's a man down.
all right, I've got to get...
why would you even want these?
they're just cool.
they're so big.
I can't move my legs.
Oh!
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was wondering if you would maybe try again with Henry.
I mean, he really liked you...
and if he's ever gonna believe...that anyone is talking to Kate, then I think it's gonna be you.
Yeah, I mean, I think that's a great idea.
I just... I don't know if he'll go for it.
I don't think he would come to you...
but if you would go to him...
and you could prove that you heard from Kate...
but I didn't.
you could fake it. - Oh, no, no, no.
I can't do that...
cause I'm not like a, you know, scam artist.
this is Kate's diary. I, um...I went into Henry's apartment when he wasn't there...you know, looking for letters or anything...that would have information...that only the two of them would know, and, I mean...Henry doesn't even know this exists.
right. I just... I really...
look, I know that you've heard the story before...
but would you really think about it?
do you really think that Henry's better off sitting alone...in his apartment for the rest of his life?
do you really think that Kate's ghost...
doesn't want him to date again?
I'm just asking you to tell one little lie...to salvage someone's life.
is that so impossible?
Hey. Ashley, right?
Yeah. - Henry.
Henry. Hi.
how are you? - Yeah, good, good.
you shop here?
Yeah, they, uh... They have really great tomatoes here...
so I just... Oh, I see. Okay.
uh, tomatoes are vegetables that you buy fresh...and then you cook them in food.
I've heard about these, yeah.
I always wondered what was on this side of the store.
so colorful. - Yeah.
how's business?
Oh, you know, sucks.
so it's looking up. - Look up, right.
well, you know, I'll let you go...but, uh, if you're ever in the area...you should stop by, and I'll cook you a...I'll cook you a real meal.
all right. Well, maybe I'll do that.
okay. - Nice seeing you.
nice seeing you.
it was raining.
it was raining when you met her...
the woman you were trying to contact.
it was night time, and it was raining.
you tried to steal her cab?
Yeah.
and you two... You two got into a fight...but you rode with her all the way home...even though you lived in totally opposite directions.
that's exactly what happened.
and she stiffed me.
I wound up paying eighty bucks for that cab ride.
do you wanna go somewhere else, so we can talk?
Yeah, it's...
Yeah.
so I noticed you didn't have any animals in your apartment.
Oh, well, my building doesn't allow pets...
but I always grew up with cats.
Oh.
when I get a new a place, I think I might...
wait. Why'd you go, "Oh"?
Oh, you had cats. That's nice.
no, that was more like, "Ah, you had cats. Figures.
I'm a vet. I love cats.
right. And the women who have them?
they're insane, across the board.
you know, they wear, like, sweatshirts...
with their cat on them. - Oh.
you know, "Hang in there.
Hey, look, let me ask you, when...in the market, were you, like...Were you hearing someone?
um, yeah, I mean, I think... I think so.
I think it was Kate.
seems a little hard to believe.
I know, but do you wanna try again?
what do you got to lose?
all right.
let me just get your hand, like... Okay.
this restaurant reminds her of something.
new York. It was snowing.
we went... We went there for Christmas.
you refused to admit that you didn't speak French...
so you ordered the pancreas?
and then, later, after you threw up all...
hello. No, yeah.
no, no, no, I'm just eating right now.
you're not interrupting anything.
are you serious?
just so you know, that wasn't me.
that was J. W. I swear. - Wow.
what else? Are you getting anything else?
okay, listen, we'll come over tonight... - Yeah, I'm just, I gotta...
I gotta get back into it.
okay? - and we can meet afterwards.
great.
look, bro, when I see four girls in matching bowling shirts...
that's how I roll, man.
it's totally true.
sorry, I'm, like, totally thrown...
no, it was great.
with the cell phone guy, um... - I don't know where to begin.
we should just try another time. - We started out with a donkey.
Yeah, I have to get going anyway.
what are the odds there was...
two chicks named Darla? - Oh. When'd you give her your card?
that's all right. You got your tricks, I've got mine.
Wow. - Seriously?
Yeah, but you don't really have to be tricky...if you wanna pay for lunch, because I won't fight ya.
Yup. Cat person.
I thought it was the one without her.
thank you.
I was actually really nervous at first...but then it was so easy.
I almost wanted it to be harder...
so I wouldn't feel bad about the situation.
what? - Ashley.
no. - Look in my eyes.
no. - It's time for a reality check.
I don't want a reality check.
you don't want one, because you know you need one.
tell me you are done with this.
I'm done...
right after this next meeting.
why are you doing all this?
I'm... I'm helping someone.
is he cute?
I don't see what that has to do with anything.
stay with me here.
you, ahem... You hate doing this.
Yeah, it goes against everything I believe.
all right, but instead of just doing it and getting it over with, you're stretching it out.
well, he's very skeptical.
I can't just blurt it out, or else he'd never believe me.
today, you had lunch. Tomorrow, who knows, dinner?
maybe you'll go to a movie...
so off base. - What does he do?
veterinarian. - A doctor.
if you weren't gay, I'd think you're jealous.
if you weren't blushing...I'd think you were telling the truth.
so you like David Foster Wallace, huh?
I couldn't get past page 20.
I keep it there because it makes me look smart.
Oh. Huh.
Oh, God, is he, like, a friend of yours or something?
you got me a gift?
well, you won't charge me, and I'm taking up your time...so, you know, I had to do something.
I love him.
I saw the book last time, so I figured you were a fan.
I am. I am.
I can't wait to not read this.
Yeah, they're short stories...
so you could read the first paragraph...of each one and then just quit.
that's... That's great.
no, this is, um... This was really sweet of you.
thank you.
should we get started?
Yeah. - Okay.
Oh, before we start, I've been doing a little research.
okay.
some of the things you've said are pretty unbelievable...and I think I know how you're doing it.
Really?
normally, in these readings...the person that's getting read gives out unconscious signals.
like you could suggest something...and then I'll shake my head no or nod...and I don't even realize it, but you pick up on it...and then you get closer and closer...until you actually get something.
all right, well, that makes sense.
how do you... How do you wanna deal with that?
well, I'm gonna concentrate really hard...
on not giving you anything.
I mean, keep my body very still...
not change my voice. Nothin'.
okay. Sounds good.
uh, let's start.
okay.
you're gonna talk like that the whole time?
Yes.
you know what?
I'm still picking up a slight bit of emotion from you...so what I think we should do...is turn our chairs back to back so I can't see you at all.
okay. - Okay?
better? - Yes.
you know what?
to be safe, I think we should be in separate rooms.
Oh, but then I'm gonna have to shout.
Yeah, all right. Now you're just messing with me, right?
Yes.
that's pretty stupid, huh?
Yes.
you wanna go get something to eat?
Yes.
so, you bring all your psychics here?
well, you really should know the answer to that.
but this is a cool place that you picked...
I'll give you that.
Kate showed it to me.
you know, I'm getting the feeling...like she wants you to be happy again...like when you used to come here.
I'm getting that feeling, too.
you are so screwed.
what? - I didn't say anything.
Oh. Right.
traitors.
lying, cheating, red-headed hussy.
I'll wring her neck.
throw her in front of a car, throw her down some stairs.
you. You bastard.
whoa. Hey, evening, Miss.
you can hear me?
unfortunately.
are you psychic?
no, dead.
good. What happened?
drunk driving accident.
Oh, so backing over me with your truck wasn't enough...to get you to stop drinking and driving?
I'm not proud.
what are you doing here?
same as you.
takin' care of unfinished business.
are you sure that's why you're here?
that's what the lady told me.
the lady in the white room? - 'Course.
why, what'd she tell you?
none of your business.
did she give you any hints?
how... How specific was she?
Ah, you didn't talk to her, did you?
What'd you do, piss her off?
unfinished business.
well, that's it.
I got to protect Henry.
Yeah.
Wh... Hey, hey!
you're welcome.
Hey. Can I help you?
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.
I called, and no one answered.
um, my friend gave me your number in yoga class.
well, I'm just having a really bad day.
my... My friend died, and we had a fight.
Oh, okay, okay. Sure, sure, sure, come in.
come in. It's fine.
thank you.
okay. Come right this way.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
Oh, it's Kay... eleen.
Kayleen? - Mm-hmm.
great. Um, why don't you come this way.
uh, just have a seat.
do you want a drink or anything?
no, I'm fine.
okay, great.
make yourself comfortable.
okay.
so, you talk to dead people?
well, I can't promise results...but, yes, I have had some success.
comes in nice and clear, huh?
no mistaking it?
sometimes, yeah.
great. Can't wait.
all right, so the first thing I'm gonna have you do...
is give me your hands.
uh, you... Uh, we probably shouldn't...because I'm, uh, coming down with a cold.
okay. Um, great.
okay, this is what we'll do then.
um, why don't you concentrate on your friend, okay?
and let's try to see if she can come through to us.
you're the psychic. - Great.
Yeah, wow, I'm getting something.
Ashley Clark, you have made a mockery of the gifts...
you've been given.
uh, Kayleen?
you speak falsely for the dead.
we have been sent here to give you a warning.
stop now or suffer a terrible fate.
is this some sort of joke?
this is no joke.
we see and hear everything.
we saw you drop the tray of meatballs last night...and still serve them.
we saw what you did in the shower last night...and it's nothing to be ashamed of...but we still saw.
and we see what you're trying to do...to Henry Mills.
I... I'm just...
you, of all people...should know the consequences of defaming the dead.
leave Henry Mills alone...or you will never find peace again.
you will lose your possessions, your friends...and eventually your life.
this is the only time we will visit you.
Oh, I must've dozed off.
did you contact my friend?
Ashley, are you okay?
please go.
well, you look like you've seen a ghost.
can you go now, please?
just go.
you'll never guess who I ran into.
who? - Ashley.
Ashley...
I know so many Ashleys.
the psychic.
Oh, that Ashley.
what did she say? - Well, it was really weird.
I mean, she got these images, really specific stuff.
Really? Wow.
will she get a message from Kate?
like what? - Huh?
what? - What?
anyway, we're, you know, gonna try it again.
that's great. That's... I really...
I feel like she can help you, Henry.
come on, Ashley!
Ashley, come on!
she's not home?
uh, why?
are you here to meet her?
no, we had, um, an appointment.
wait a second. Are you Henry...
the-the veterinarian?
she mentioned me?
no, it's just a really lucky guess.
I'm good like that.
I'm Dan, the catering partner.
right. Hi, Dan. - Hi.
Yeah, we were supposed to meet an hour and a half ago...at this restaurant, but she's not answering her phone.
I know. I've been calling her all day.
do you mind if I try?
knocking?
please. No, please. Help yourself.
maybe later you can come jab an elevator button...a hundred times after I've already pushed it.
Ashley!
Ashley, it's Henry. Are you there?
Henry, I'm sick!
I tried to call.
I might be sick for a really long time.
okay, do you need anything?
no. I'll call you if I ever feel better.
Ashley?
Ashley!
got more than you did.
Hey, it's Ashley, psychic-slash-caterer...leave an awesome message.
good morning. It's Henry.
just thought I'd check in since you didn't...sound so good last night, see if you're all right.
so, um, you all right?
morning again.
it's, uh, Henry again.
that's some cold. I hope you didn't get it...
when we went out the other night.
anyway, I was gonna...
you know, come by and drop off some soup or something...
so, um, maybe I'll see you.
# And I'm gonna let it shine # - It's Henry.
the sandwich was gone, so, you know, that's a good sign.
buying a sandwich for someone...you've never had a sandwich with...is a lot harder than you think.
I mean, just the bread.
I started off with whole wheat...but then I worried that, you know, I'm saying...you're kind of a crunchy person...
I almost went with pumpernickel, but then I'd look like...the kind of guy who wants to impose...my weird bread fetish on everyone and...You know, now, I'm one of those idiots who just prattles on...in, uh, answering machines...and also uses a word like "prattles.
so the only thing I can think of is that, uh, you really just...you don't wanna talk to me anymore.
um, if that's right, well, um...I don't know, I guess just...kinda keep doin' what you're doin'.
so, take care of yourself...
Ashley.
there you are.
why have you been avoiding my brother?
uh, I can explain.
um...
I guess I can't explain.
okay, if you didn't wanna do this...you should've just said so...but to lead him on and let him think...that you can help him and then just disappear?
I mean, he's worse off, if that's possible.
I just couldn't do it anymore, all right?
I'm sorry.
please tell him I'm sorry.
did you run out of things to say?
no, it's not that. It's not that. - Because I have...
it's not... - more information.
I have letters and some pictures and...
is that her? - Yeah, that's Kate.
Oh, God!
wait, what do... What does that mean?
do... Do you want the letters?
all right, show's over.
come out. I know who you are...
Kate.
boo. - God.
God, it's really you. This is unbelievable.
are you really like a... - Ghost?
it's the only way I can explain it.
that is awesome.
here, catch.
nice throw.
crap.
Hey, what was that the other day, man?
I was just trying to help out the situation.
help?
you were helping yourself to Henry.
okay, so, like, I'm like...
I'm like slightly attracted to him.
well, he's not right for you.
Yes, he is.
he is considerate, and he is sweet, and, you know...pulls the chair out for me when I sit.
big deal.
it is a big deal, and you know it, okay?
he's been wonderful to me from the second he met me...even though he probably thought I was a little crazy.
well, you do talk to dead people.
that's a little crazy.
Oh, I'm crazy?
you're the one who's spying on me in the frickin' shower.
you're right. I'm sorry about that.
you know what, girl to girl, you're gettin' a little hippy.
you might wanna cut back on the pasta.
all right, what do you want?
I'm serious. Why are you here?
look, we got off on the wrong foot...and that's partly my fault...with the threats from beyond and all.
Yeah. - But here's the thing.
I was sent back to earth to protect Henry.
Really? How do you know that?
because when you die, you go to this white room...and there's a woman who may or may not be an angel...and she says that, you know, just, you know...stuff, and I just know.
so, like, I have to like stay away from Henry now?
Oh, that would be so great. Thank you.
wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
but you're dead.
I still don't want you to see him.
Yeah, I know, but for argument's sake...I mean, if I wanted to see him...there's not a whole hell of a lot you could do about it.
Really?
then why have you been hiding in your bedroom for a week?
well, I'm done hiding.
let's not let this get ugly.
I think it already has.
you have no idea.
Ashley?
Hi, Henry.
Oh, sorry.
Dr. Mills.
Oh, hey, you're alive.
Yeah, thanks to you.
you're a real lifesaver.
know... You know, the food that you left me...was the only thing that kept me going.
Oh, you got that. Good.
I left a couple of messages, but...
I know. I'm so sorry. I, um...I just... I felt so ill that I couldn't talk to anyone.
but the minute I felt better...I wanted to come down here and thank you in person.
I hope you're not mad at me.
no, not at all. I...I'm sorry that I called and bothered you.
I mean, you said that you'd call when you felt better...
and here you are.
do you wanna go out tonight?
Yeah. All right. I'd love to.
okay, great.
Oh, great. Oh, great.
I'll let you get back to saving animals' lives...
okay.
and what seems to be the trouble with Margaret?
itchy ass.
excellent.
Oh!
Oh, God!
Ashley, hello.
what was that crash? I heard a crash.
Ashley, hello. - Shit.
what is going on? Is there someone there?
is someone at your place?
hello. - You know what...
Hello! - I'm callin' the police.
I'm giving you ten seconds to pick up.
Dan. Sorry.
the phone scared me, so I killed it.
what's going on? Where have you been?
why haven't you talked to me? - It's a long story.
I've got time.
I... I can't talk right now.
why don't you come over tomorrow...
we'll work on the Spencer party. I got to go.
where are you off to?
the gym. Okay? I got to go. Bye.
Oh, wait, Dan! - Yeah?
would you say I'm hippy?
there's a gas leak in the building.
everyone get out now.
this is an emergency.
it'll be fine if we just don't freak out!
it's all right! It's okay!
we'll be right if we just stay cool!
just stay cool, guys! Just don't light a match!
what... Everyone out!
Oh, no.
miss? - The...
it was just the P. A.
was there an announcement on the P. A?
what P. A?
Stairmaster's open, you know, for your... Mm-hmm.
miss.
Yeah. I was just...
well, look at me, hmm?
naked in there, okay.
just kidding. Sorry about that, you guys.
I'm crazy.
so, do you have any idea where you wanna eat?
um, no.
I mean, if you have a place... some place in mind or...
no, it's your treat, so, you know...I'm gonna let you choose.
Oh, well, in that case, I just... I know just the place, actually.
no, I was... I was kidding.
do you wanna get some seafood?
Oh, no, no, big talker...
you're now gonna eat a hot dog out of a cart.
Hey. - Sor... Oh, sorry.
uh, one Italian sausage.
thank you. - No, make it two.
if you're sure you wouldn't rather have seafood.
no, we're... No, we're fine with the two.
two Italian sausage. Thank you.
are you going to treat me to a funnel cake, too?
only if you're a good boy.
watch out for that.
stop it, please. It's really not funny.
no, you're right. That's horrible.
stop, 'cause if you wanna play, I'll play that game.
you wanna play that game?
Oh, my God! Oh!
Ohh!
Oh.
let me just...
you got a little somethin', uh...
I can't believe you're not embarrassed...to be seen with me right now.
Oh, God, no, no, I totally am.
Oh. - Yeah.
if I run into anybody that I know...
I'm gonna pretend you're a German tourist.
I don't wanna be associated with you.
do you know any German?
uh... Ich machen dachen zeit yachen...
it's kinda like a Swedish German.
Yeah. - Nice.
it's not. Yeah. - It's good.
Yes, no, I think the bathrooms are over there...
german lady, who's from also Sweden...
that I don't even know.
Hey, I feel kind of weird bringing this up...
but have you thought about Kate lately?
um, yeah, not really.
I mean, you know how I feel about all that...
but you said some pretty amazing things.
can I ask you a question?
sure.
um, there's no right or wrong answer to this...
so you can just be honest, but, um, are we...Are we out to talk about Kate...or-or are we, you know, just out?
because, either way is totally fine with me.
I just... If it's both...then it probably gets, like, a little complicated for me.
Yeah, I was kind of wondering the same thing, actually.
I mean, are we out because I'm your client...or are we out?
Oh, great, I'm your client.
that sucks.
I had a good time.
me, too.
I'll call you tomorrow.
okay, you don't have to.
no, I want to.
okay. Okay, me, too.
okay.
Bye.
forgetting something?
was I somehow unclear about what I wanted you to do?
Oh, were you expecting Henry?
I was hoping. He's quite a kisser.
you're really gonna throw that in my face?
isn't that tactic a little beneath you?
you're one to talk!
I had to show a room full of guys my naked breasts...because of you!
that's a nice gesture, but unnecessary, dear.
Oh, I was... Um...
good night.
bingo, come on.
that dog just sniffed you.
God, I think the animals can see you.
that is so cool.
that's great.
wonder how I can use that against you?
Hey, I showed it to you.
Yeah, that was dumb.
I don't understand.
if you weren't sick, then what was the problem?
I can't get into it...because you're gonna think I'm crazy.
no, no, no. I'll hide it.
I promise, I'll look at you really sincerely and say...I understand.
okay. Fine. - Good.
you remember Henry, right?
Yeah, yeah. The guy with the wife...that was the crushed by the angel.
right. I saw her.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
uh, now, when you say, uh, you saw her...
you mean you saw...
her ghost, yes. - Mm.
Yeah, she's been hassling me.
I understand.
no, Dan, this is not a joke.
look, I've heard voices before and stuff like that...but I've actually seen her.
do you see her right now?
no, I only see her when she wants me to see her...
I think. I don't know.
you know what? Never mind. I'm kidding.
I seriously was kidding. I totally made that up.
let's cook. I bought salmon.
you... You really believe this, don't you?
it's really happening.
and it's only you. No one else can see or hear her?
Yeah. I don't know why I'm the only one who can see her.
maybe because I'm after the guy she was supposed to marry.
maybe that's sufficient motivation for her...to come back from the dead. I don't know.
I note that during your little rant...defending your sanity, you admit you're after him.
well, yeah, I mean, we're like...
we're like... We're sort of dating or whatever.
Ashley.
no, I don't want a reality check.
this is what happens when you lie...
I've seen it a thousand times.
no, because I'm not lying, okay?
I can actually talk to her. That's different.
okay, I was lying before...
because I actually couldn't talk to her.
and also, admittedly...
I lied to you about being interested in him.
so I am sorry about that.
Yeah, listen, while you work that out...maybe this can bubble into your subconscious.
run away!
I mean, you have dated guys with every problem there is...
but this one, apparently, has a ghost?
Mm. - Look, it's impossible to find a great guy...
and I'm not gonna let a little thing...like a ghost stop me, okay?
I'm not gonna let her win.
you mean her ghost?
right. - I understand.
I'm going to the market. Bone the fish.
are you all right? Why are you screaming?
no, I wasn't.
I was... I was singing.
Thanks.
father Marks?
Ashley.
that's me.
I haven't seen you in, what's it been, ten years?
I've been to a few Christmas services.
well, next Christmas, why don't you come up and say hello?
Absolutely. I will put that in my calendar.
december the 25th.
got it.
well, you didn't come here...
so I could make you squirm about your attendance.
now that you mention it.
um... Father, um, I've... I've...
I've had an encounter...encounters with a ghost.
well, you mustn't be completely surprised...
that this is happening to you.
I mean, if you dabble with the occult...you're bound to get these kind of incidents.
I know. - Well, all right.
you're not here to get a lecture from me.
so why did you come here?
I want you to get rid of her.
do you see the ghost now?
no.
and this room is where you've seen her the most?
definitely. This is definitely the room...where I see her most.
so, uh, is there a script for this sort of thing?
for exorcism? Oh sure, sure.
no, when you're casting out spirits...the Church doesn't really like us to wing it.
right. Of course.
shall we? - Yes.
Yes.
I address thee, spirit, in the name of the Father...and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
come out and leave this servant of God.
you don't really believe this is gonna work.
I see her. She's right there.
it is time for your soul to pass on.
hear the command of God himself...who did walk upon the sea...and extend his right hand to Peter.
you really don't believe in all this hocus-pocus, do you?
in the name of God, the Almighty Father...that thou depart... - Oh, that's not good.
it's working. It's working.
uh, okay, Ashley, listen.
I've been reconsidering, and I think we can come...
to some sort of understanding. - "Let the Holy Spirit...dwell therein.
okay, uh, s-s-some of the...some of the things I did, a little out of hand...and I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize.
you know, the whole naked in the gym thing, not cool.
I get it now.
what's happening? - "Therefore, restless spirit...
Oh, make it stop!
acknowledge that your time has ended.
please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go!
she's gone.
Yeah.
you did it.
you sure? - Yeah.
I'm... I'm... I'm sure.
she was right there...and then she vanished.
well, bugger me.
good.
good. - Very good.
so, you're, uh, finished with your psychic work?
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's over.
and we'll see you in church on a regular basis?
we didn't agree to that before we started.
Oh, I'll bring her back.
it's a deal. It's a deal. I promise.
okay. No more of these games.
I know. I'm sorry. - Take care of yourself...
Ashley Clark. - Bye-bye.
he sounded so serious.
No! No!
did you like that disappearing thing?
I just made that up.
I didn't even know I could do that before now.
okay, time to get to work.
tonight, instead of sleeping, I thought I'd tell you...all the stories of all the pets I've ever owned.
Oh, people love pet stories. - Just... Just...
so, I'm gonna start with the first pet I ever had.
it was a turtle named Ernie, and I must've been eight.
she actually had kittens.
she had baby kittens, and then we named them all.
and we used to call him Boots, because he was all white...
and he had these little black...
boots? - Exactly.
at least that's what we called him until "he" had kittens.
then we named him Mrs. Piggy.
and there were six kittens. What were their names?
was that you?
the doorbell?
Yeah, that was me. Don't answer that.
I remember the kittens' names!
it was Willy, Betty, Whiskers...Fang, Teddy, and Nugget!
and then there was Buffy, who was my last dog.
but after he died, that was it.
God, I think that's all my pets.
you should get some sleep.
Mmm... thank you.
good morning.
the time is 7 A. M. - You have a busy day in front of you...
good morning, everyone. - so I thought you might like to hear...all my favorite colors and numbers.
blue, seven, seventeen... - Good morning, everyone! Well...
lime green, forest green, yellow, one, blue.
Oh, crap, did I already say blue?
you know what? I'm gonna start over.
blue. - Ow!
Oh, God!
gettin' tired? Unable to function?
I'm fine.
you know, you really should think...about what you're getting into here.
I don't need sleep.
I can hound you every second of every day.
you're never gonna know...if something you hear is real or not.
I can keep you from sleeping and eating...and drinking... - Enough!
enough, okay? Congratulations, you win.
I love spending time with Henry, but it's not worth it.
good. Then my work here is done.
but if you ever try to see him again...
you'll be back. - You can count on it.
go.
Hey, wait, Kate.
look, is there, um...
is there anything you wanna tell him?
what do you mean?
well, Henry came to me...because he wanted to talk to you...and I definitely think I can deliver on that.
so is there anything you wanna say to him?
Kate contacted me from beyond...not like before, but clearer.
clearer than anything that I have ever experienced.
what did she say?
Hi, Henry.
she says, "Hi, Henry.
I know. Um, you know what?
ask me questions.
just, uh, ask me as many questions as you'd like...
and just keep asking me until you're convinced.
what was her favorite food?
the three berry cake at Sweet Lady Jane's.
she says ask a tough one.
um, what was her first pet's name?
Ernie the turtle. She told me that earlier today.
her favorite Hawaiian island?
she's only been to Maui, and she got stung by a jellyfish.
you really, uh...
what else?
she always hated this chair.
her second toes are slightly longer than her first.
she always meant to take guitar lessons.
well, I... Why did she come here?
I mean, what does she wanna tell me?
she says that she can tell that you're torn...between being faithful to her memory...and the feelings that you have for me.
the hell I did!
Ow! Oh! Ah!
what happened? - Seed in the eye! It's okay!
tell him the truth!
she says she just wants you to be happy, Henry...and she can tell that you're happier with me.
you are screwing with the wrong woman.
that's it. I mean, she wants you to move on.
Oh, she's gone.
no, I'm not!
I'm right here!
I'm right here!
I'm gonna be with you every second of every day...for the rest of your life!
tell her thank you.
thank you, Kate, wherever you are.
are you okay?
you look at it, Doctor.
Oh!
it really hurts.
good. I hope it blinds you.
what would I do without you?
you are so dead.
I, Andy Chris, take you, Natalie Yeroshik...as my best friend for life.
I pledge to honor, encourage...and support you... - Oh, you know the Lerner party?
you're gonna have to do that alone.
where, uh... Where are you gonna be?
uh, I gotta... I gotta...
I gotta go away. I'm... Some... I've got a thing.
with... With who?
Shh.
with Henry? With Henry.
this is my solemn vow.
from this moment, I, Natalie Yeroshik...take you, Andy Chris...
what, Dan? - Nothing. Nothing.
this is my solemn vow.
by the power vested in me...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
Congratulations.
Yeah.
Yeah.
six. - Ashley.
Shh!
okay, where was I? I was on...
three. - Thank you.
for what?
I have to say something.
now, you know I never get involved in your love life.
bullshit. - Fine.
as someone who's always involved in your love life...I think you should listen to me.
you're making a huge mistake.
no, I'm not. Help me with the cart.
is trying to drive you away, and-and it's not because...
he's a client who you lie to...
but you talk about picking guys with problems?
he just got out of a relationship...where his bride was killed on their wedding day...and you'll be the first girl he dates.
that's a pretty serious rebound.
you really think this is gonna end up well, huh?
nice try. You're still handling the Lerner party alone.
ladies and gentlemen, Cherries Jubilee.
excuse me for a second.
I could feel the heat all the way back here.
are you okay? - You know, if I were dead...
I wouldn't be following around one person, okay?
I'd be finding out the meaning of life.
I would be talking to wise, notable dead people.
Oh, like who?
um, like Eleanor Roosevelt.
what would you ask her?
like, all kinds of things.
like what?
um...
all right, forget Eleanor Roosevelt.
you're the only dead person I wanna talk to right now.
Oh, I think you burned off a little bit of your eyebrow.
what? Where?
right... Right there.
it's not gonna be even.
you know what? I don't care.
and you know what else?
I'm going away with Henry this weekend...whether you like it or not, and I don't care what you do.
I don't care if you set me on fire or yell and scream...and talk about your dog or watch me while I piss!
I don't care! So if you're trying to make me look insane...
it's not working!
so...
who's ready for cake?
# There's nothing you and I # - Ha! No! - Yeah.
# Won't do # - Oh, my God.
pretty smooth. - It is beautiful.
it's so weird how much this place...reminds me of my own apartment.
you know what we should do?
I saw some people riding one of those...like, two-person bikes.
we should totally rent one of those.
Yeah, absolutely.
okay, cool.
now?
Yeah, why not?
we just got here.
don't you want to unpack, check out the room?
Oh, my God.
did you think that you could just bring me...up here and never leave the room?
just put a "do not disturb" sign on the door...and lock ourselves in for the weekend?
um... yes?
awesome.
I'll go freshen up.
Henry?
yes?
you know I'm still in the room, right?
Yeah.
okay. - Okay.
that was gross.
are you all right?
I'm fine!
okay.
I should've known it was you.
you know, I never thought farts were funny...when I was alive, but the look on your face.
you get out of here.
you're not having sex with my husband.
he is not your husband.
and even if you did make it down that aisle...there's still that "till death do us part" clause.
you're a ghost!
did you say something?
there's potpourri!
don't do it!
Oh, I'm doin' it.
Oh, my God.
it looks even better on the floor.
best day ever.
wow, this is gonna be awkward.
Oh, my God!
you okay? - Yeah, yeah.
I just, you know, it's just, "Oh, my God.
I'm surprised he didn't spring for the suite.
Hey! - Are you sure you're okay?
how's it going down there? - Why? Yeah.
Yeah. - Yoo-hoo!
it's just you're closing your eyes very energetically.
I think you're freakin' him out.
Oh, you like to kiss with your eyes open? That's cool.
I mean, that's kind of kinky, but all right, all right.
I'm cool with that. - Being on the bottom...not your most flattering angle.
I was talking to another ghost the other day...
and you'll never guess who it was.
remember that guy you used to date in high school...who got killed in a motorcycle accident?
Ted?
what? - What?
you said Ted.
no, I didn't.
I just... I, um... 'cause I bumped my arm.
I'm okay now.
anyway, this is a little embarrassing...but he said you were a bad kisser.
actually, he said you were the worst kisser ever.
painful and overly wet," was his exact quote.
he made a noise like this.
talk dirty to me. - What?
talk dirty to me. I love it. It turns me on.
Henry doesn't like that.
do it loud.
um... Oh, you're a dirty girl, aren't you?
she's a dirty little liar is what she is.
louder.
you're a dirty little thing.
you're a dirty girl...
# I believe the children # - aren't you?
# Are our future # - You're a dirty girl.
good, good. Louder though, louder. - # Teach them well #
like... Like you're trying to drown out some annoying noise - # And let them lead the way #
# Show them all # - Like this?!
# The beauty # - Yeah!
# They possess inside # - You're a dirty little girl, aren't you?
louder, please! - Aren't you a dirty little thing?!
you like the dirty stuff!
aren't you a dirty... That's just stupid.
I'm just yelling at you.
music! - Is that annoying?
it's a little loud.
What?!
the music. You like it this loud?
Oh, yeah, I love it.
love this. Salsa.
salsa makes me horny!
no, no, no, no!
come on, just anything.
I like your hair!
Oh, God, I love it!
it's looks really good! - Louder!
Really?!
sorry, sorry.
Oh, hey. - Hi.
how you doin'? - I'm good.
so, what's up?
you know that woman you sent me to...
the, uh, psychic?
believe me, you don't have to whisper that...in this neighborhood.
I mean, it's not like I sent you to a...Republican.
well, She's, um... She's great.
I mean, really, I feel a thousand times better.
did she get a message from Kate?
Yeah, and I think that Kate really wants me to move on.
in fact, I'm dating her.
who?
Ashley.
wait, so she told you that Kate said...that she wants you to start dating again...and then she went out with you?
well, it didn't happen exactly like that, but...Oh, yeah, I guess that is...how it happened exactly, but...Well, you got to stop.
Why?
she's a psychic.
since when do you have a problem with psychics?
I... You do.
you do. You hate them.
look, Henry, I think it's great...that you're dating again, but, I mean, you can't date her.
God, I thought you'd be happy about this.
I guess, I-I should be.
I'm just... You're right.
I'm just surprised, I mean...
but I'm... I'm... I'm coming around now.
I mean, look how happy I am now.
Chloe.
I've been meaning to call you, actually.
what's been stopping you, huh?
so you could date him?
come on in.
no, I'm okay.
I just... I want Kate's diary back.
okay. Um... yeah.
I'm not gonna tell him that I gave this to you...because, somehow, he does seem better.
I know it looks bad.
how could you do this?
I mean, uh, "I can't fake it. I'm not some scam artist.
I mean, you totally took advantage of him.
you asked me to do this.
use fake psychic vision to date him?
let me think. No, I'd remember that.
Chloe, I really, really care about him.
worst part is that I did this.
I mean, I gave this to you.
I handed you everything that you needed.
you gave what to her?
no, what... It's okay. Don't...
what's this?
this is Kate's diary.
Yeah.
why would you give this to her?
how'd you even get it?
the story about the pancreas is in here...
um... - and how we met.
Henry. Henry!
Henry!
you were right.
it all fell apart, you know, 'cause I'm a horrible person.
no, no, you're not a horrible person.
Yes, I am. I am.
I'm a liar, and I'm a horrible person.
and you know what? I never even deserved him.
okay, you... You kn... - I didn't!
no, you know what? He's an idiot to let you go.
No! - All right? No.
no matter what you did, he's an idiot to let you go...
okay?
anyone would be lucky to have you.
you're just saying that.
anyone.
what the hell was that?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you're my friend.
you're gay.
you're my gay friend.
Ah, screw it.
I'm not gay.
what?
I'm not gay!
I've never been gay.
I don't have sex with men, and they don't have sex with me.
Wow.
so when you just kissed me just then, you were like...
I'm in love with you.
What?!
I've been in love with you since I met you.
every time you turn your back to me, I sniff your hair.
I went into business with you, so I could be near you.
I hate cooking!
I wanna throw up every time I cut a fish.
God, you have got to be the worst psychic...in the history of time.
how could you not know any of this?
why didn't you just, like, tell me?
okay, remember when we met, and-and-and we started, you know...going out to lunch and dinner...and talking on the phone all day and all night.
I thought we were dating.
and... And then...
and then, after a week, we went to a movie.
I was just about to kiss you, and you turned to me...and you said, "I love having a gay friend to talk to.
I could never be this comfortable...with a straight man.
what was... What was I supposed to do?
you waited a week to make your move!
of course, I thought you were gay.
I was taking it slow.
five years, one kiss? That's not slow.
that's family.
I'm sorry. I missed my window.
I was... I was waiting for it to come back around again.
God, Dan, you've, like...
betrayed me.
betrayed you? - Yeah.
Ashley, I love you.
you think it was easy for me listening to you...talk about other guys, Watching mind-numbingly boring romantic movies...and pretending to cry?huh?
going shopping with you and giving you advice on clothes?
do you know how much of the last five years...I have spent learning about clothes?
this shirt cost me $175, and I hate it!
I hate it!
I love that shirt.
you know, before this whole stupid thing...I probably spent $100 a year on clothes.
now? Now, I spend that much every three weeks...on this haircut, which I also hate!
God.
we took bubble baths together.
Yeah.
now can you see how hard it was for me?
I just wanted to cry on my gay friend.
Yup.
I'll let myself out.
okay.
all right, I'm ready.
you don't have a cat.
I rescued a stray, so you'd talk to me.
come in.
so, have you thought about a name for him yet?
no. After we're done here...I'm taking him back to the pond.
I'm kidding.
it's a joke, so you start laughing now...breaks the tension, and then we start talking again.
pet's a big responsibility.
did you ever think about maybe just running...into me on the street?
listen, I didn't know that Ashley was gonna use...the information I gave her to start dating you.
I mean, I really thought that she was just...gonna tell you that Kate wanted you to move on.
we... Do you really have to do that?
Yeah, he needs his shots.
Yeah. I think he's already had them.
he's my neighbor's cat.
your neighbor let you borrow her cat to bring to the vet?
you stole a cat?
I'm gonna bring him back.
he was on a fire escape. It's like a walk.
would you quit doin' stupid stuff...because you think you know you're right?
whoa. You should hear yourself.
you sound like Mom and Dad.
and your friends and your bosses...
and your teachers and strangers that you meet on the street.
they all tell you this because it's true.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
see if you can get the cat home without killing it.
I think I can handle it.
he's fine.
Hi.
I read this.
Henry, I really wanna talk to you about all this.
it's just... - How did you know...about the cake or Hawaii or the chair?
none of that's in here...and no one else knows about that.
all right, um, your sister gave me the diary...and she asked me to pretend...that Kate had talked to me, which is not her fault...because I shouldn't have done it in the first place, okay?
but I did, because I thought, I don't know...
I thought maybe you needed it, you know, to help you move on.
but I must have crossed over some sort of line...or something, because then, suddenly, she appeared.
Kate. - Yeah.
and sh... And she tried to scare me away from you.
but I just... I really wanted to be with you...so I didn't let it stop me.
you pretended that she wanted us to be together...because you thought that that would make me...fall in love with you.
Yeah, I guess I did.
I, um...
I hoped that you would love me for other reasons, too.
is she here now? - No, I haven't...
I haven't actually seen her, um, since you broke up with me.
guess it was her job to get rid of me...and, well, she did that.
so, she just sort of disappears?
I don't know.
thank you.
there's a soul and seal on thine arm.

long time. - Yeah, could've gone longer.
Yeah, listen, I've...
I've been thinking about what I did, and...
can we stop walking?
I'm trying to... trying to be sincere...
and the panting is really killing my delivery.
sorry.
I screwed up. - Yeah, you did.
Yeah, I did. Definitely screwed up.
but look at it this way.
I pretended I was gay for five years.
has any other man ever done anything like that for you, huh?
I mean, I could see a guy pretending...for two, three...three, three years tops... - Okay.
but five, come on, that's... - Okay.
all right, listen, Ashley, you know me.
you know me better than anyone else does.
and I know you.
even though I did a stupid, stupid...
really stupid.
beyond crazy, stupid thing by lying to you...
we have been best friends for five years.
Yes, that is true.
look, I don't...
I don't know any more fancy way to say this.
I'm a good guy. I love you.
and I... I just...
I just really wish you'd give me a chance, so...
do I attract screwed-up guys, or what?
Hiya.
you. - Yeah.
well, he doesn't look so good, does he?
no, he doesn't.
finish your mission?
Yeah. You?
no, or I wouldn't still be here.
Really? - Mm.
so you do move on once you finish...
what you're supposed to do? - Oh, shoot.
did you listen to anything she said?
no. - So I guess you're not done yet.
guess not.
look, what do you think you're supposed to do?
I don't know.
well, what do you want more than anything else right now?
for Henry to be happy.
okay.
what do you think would make Henry happy?
I don't know.
think you do.
damn it! Anything but that.
wait, where are you going?
I'm done.
so your job was to...Get you to do the right thing, yeah.
well, why didn't you just tell me that in the first place?
would you have believed me? Mmm.
see ya, up there.
yeah? Well, if I see you, I know I'm not in heaven.
that's the spirit.
the yellow dress?
are you planning on wearing that, or taking it to Goodwill?
I haven't talked to him in months.
Wow. No, "Hello, Kate.
how's the afterlife treatin' you?
you know, I think I lost weight.
I never looked this good when I was alive.
what do you want, Kate?
um... all right, this isn't easy for me, so...
you at a loss for words?
that's a first.
have you talked to Henry, you know, since...
since you broke us up?
no, I haven't.
as a matter of fact, I'm, uh, dating someone else.
no, you're not. You can't be.
Yes, I can, and we're goin' to Vegas.
well, stop! What about Henry?
what about him? You know what?
I am not interested in whatever sick game...you're playing, Kate.
no, listen to me. I'm being very serious.
I want you two together.
no sale.
I can't believe I'm begging you to date my husband.
okay, don't you still love him?
even if you weren't screwing with me right now...which it's so clear that you are...the answer would be no.
I moved on.
I mean, it killed me to do it, but I did it.
so just, um...
can you leave me alone now? Please?
get up!
get up!
Henry!
why can't you hear me?
get up!
everything okay over there?
who cares about the bird?
call Ashley!
Ashley. Call Ashley.
Ashley.
did you just say...
Ashley. - Who taught you that?
call Ashley. Call Ashley.
you want me to call Ashley?
what do you... I'm talking to my bird.
get up. Get up.
Kate?
is that you?
are you talking to me through my bird?
Yes.
why do you want me to...
call Ashley.
I got a machine.
airport. - What?
airport.
take the bird.
Oh, yeah.
Taxi! Taxi! - # You know that it's not for naught #
Oh, hey, nice. Thanks.
welcome.
# It's not like that anymore # - Where to?
airport. Airport.
what? You heard the bird. The airport.
why are we going to the airport? Where is she goin'?
Las Vegas.
and you want me to stop her? I thought you hated her.
what gave you that idea?
how do you even... How do you know this?
what a day, right?
got your bird with you, huh?
# What is this downside # - Ah.
I think. - # That you speak of? #
Ashley!
whoa, whoa, whoa! Back of the line, sir.
I just need to talk to that woman for a second.
the only way you get through here is with a ticket.
could you maybe get her then?
it's an emergency.
Oh, it's an emergency?
well, by all means, come on in, man.
you know, people who have emergencies...don't even have to go through the metal detectors.
all right, there's really no need for sarcasm.
back of the line.
Hi. I need the cheapest ticket you have.
where do you wanna go, sir?
it doesn't matter.
well, that's not at all suspicious.
hurry up, lard ass.
excuse me?
uh... no, that's, uh...
that's... That's my bird.
he says that to everybody.
move those fat fingers, Helen.
all right, you know what? That's enough.
sorry.
one ticket to Miami, $1, 350.
that's the cheapest ticket... - Don't be cheap. Buy it!
all right, you know, that's fine. That's fine. - Buy it!
you know, I never really thought about it...but, uh, a psychic in Vegas?
we could really clean up, you know?
Yeah. Too bad I don't do that anymore.
all right.
over there.
what?
what's the matter?
you don't wanna know.
Ashley.
what are you doing here?
I don't know. The bird told me to come here.
did you do this?
who are you talking to?
Oh, let me... Let me guess, uh, the ghost?
why are you here?
why is your arm around her? You're gay.
no, I'm not... I'm not gay. No, no.
no, I've never been gay.
methinks he doth protest too much.
do you really want this?
Henry does.
where is she?
she's right next to you.
you want Ashley and me to be together?
I do.
I'm sorry I put you through all of this.
she says she does, and she's sorry...for being such a royal bitch.
I mean, I'm... I'm paraphrasing.
thank you, Kate.
you're welcome, Henry.
when we get to heaven, all bets are off.
she says you're welcome.
so, Kate wants us to be together.
I want us to be together.
what do you want?
well, I wouldn't wanna piss her off again.
Hello? - # I just want you to be loved #
you know what? That probably wasn't gonna work out anyway.
I'm Bill, by the... - I'm not gay!
okay. - Okay.
all right. - Very good.
me, neither. Not gay at all.
um, maybe, though, when we get to Vegas...we can grab some dinner...and talk about how, you know, not gay we are.
I am so glad I met you. You're hilarious.
I was just going for ironically amusing.
are you sure you haven't been drinking already?
Oh, wait till after the ceremony.
if you like me now...you are gonna love me when I'm drunk.
really quick. - Well, I'm not gay.
I'm not gay.
I just need... I just wanna get that...out there right now, so there's no misunderstanding later.
I'm not... So that's why we, uh... Okay.
there she is.
Oh, God, hold on, Dad.
one second. One second.
Hi.
look, I know this was supposed to be you...so thank you.
just make him happy, okay?
or else, you know.
wait, can you come back and haunt me for that, or...
I... I don't know.
I kind of missed the orientation speech.
don't worry.
Kate, I will make him happy.
I love Gardenias.
sorry.
we are gathered here in the presence of God...to witness the exchanging of vows that will bind...this couple together...in the covenant and relationship of marriage.
when the ceremony has ended, they will leave this place...for the very first time.
# It's gonna be a bright # - Hello, Kate.
not you again! Come on!
relax! I'm just here to congratulate you.
Really?
I did the right thing?
you certainly did.
now just give me back the orb of true light...that you collected from your loved ones...and you can move on.
I'm sorry, the orb of which what?
Oh, dear.
are you screwing with me?
are you allowed to screw with me?
Hey, hey, no!
you are not disappearing on another conversation!
you better hope I don't end up in this room again!
I'm gonna kick your ass!
get back here!
Walter, honey.
time to wake up.
just 10 more minutes.
Oh, I'm sorry, sport. You can sleep in tomorrow.
that's what Saturdays are for.
up against the wall.
come, come, come.
all right.
got it. Got it. Look, look!
all right, sit down.
your breakfast is getting cold.
it's cereal.
it's supposed to be cold.
sweetheart, we're here.
okay.
here's your books.
go ahead.
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a moment, I'll get a supervisor for you.
Sandy: Yes, she's coming right now.
just a second, she'll be with you.
just one second, please. You deal with this one. I'm not going near it.
Hello, this is the supervisor. How can I help you?
I can see you're on a party line...
unfortunately, some people do listen in on party lines. We...
well, what is he doing?
Oh, my...
everything all right?
Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was having trouble with the connection.
Hey, sport. Hey, Mom.
how was school?
okay. Yeah?
we learned about dinosaurs.
and I got in a fight with Billy Mankowski.
what happened?
he hit me.
did you hit him back?
good.
rule number one, remember?
never start a fight, always finish it.
why'd he hit you?
because I hit him.
you hit him first?
Why?
he said my dad ran off because he didn't like me.
honey, your father never met you, so how could he not like you?
then why did he leave?
well, because the day you were born, something else arrived in the mail.
and it was in a box a little bit bigger than you.
you know what was in it?
something called responsibility.
and to some people, responsibility is the scariest thing in the world.
so, he ran away because he was scared of what was in that box?
Uh-huh.
that's just dumb.
that is exactly what I thought.
did I miss Amos and Andy?
I'm afraid so, sport.
come now, time for bed.
are we still going to the movies tomorrow?
Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin picture and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman.
who's that?
I don't know. Nobody does.
that's what makes him so mysterious.
Oh.
am I too heavy for you to carry?
Oh, no, not for years.
not for years.
Hello? This is Margaret.
Hi, Margaret.
so, how are you?
fine.
listen, Jean can't come in today and now we're a little shorthanded.
when did she call in sick?
about half hour ago.
I'm having a hard time trying to find someone.
well, what about Myrna?
I know she could use the extra hours and...
she's busy. Can't you come?
no. No, no, no. I just...
I promised Walter that I'd take him to the movies, is all, and...
well, it's just until 4: 00.
all right.
just... Just until 4: 00.
I'll see you then.
there's a sandwich and milk in the fridge, and I've asked Mrs. Riley and her daughter to stop in in a couple of hours.
I can take care of myself.
I know you can. They're checking on the house, not you.
tomorrow we will go to the movies.
and then we'll ride Big Red to Santa Monica and take a walk on the pier.
how does that sound? Does that sound good?
I'll be home before it gets dark.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I know. I know.
be good.
I love you.
we've got lines jammed from here to Ohio.
he says he needs to speak to somebody in charge.
I need your signature here for a supply requisition.
number, please. Number, please.
go ahead, please.
all right, get me the Omaha routing station.
see if we can put our calls through their switchers.
let's get this console running, now.
Christine. Good, I was hoping to catch you.
look, I've been following your work reports, and I just want to let you know that I am very impressed.
when I first suggested hiring female supervisors, my superiors weren't big on the idea.
but you have held your own as well as any of your male counterparts.
thank you, Mr. Harris.
Oh, Ben, please. Listen, I...
listen, the point is, we're looking to take on a manager for our new Beverly Hills office.
and if you're interested in the job, I could write a report, or...
that would be wonderful. Thank you so much, sir.
okay, good, so maybe we could...
could we speak about it Monday? Yeah, absolutely.
would that be all right? Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.
please!
please.
honey?
honey?
honey!
Walter, it's time to come in, honey.
Suzie? Have you seen Walter?
no, Mrs. Collins.
sorry.
number, please.
may I please have the police station?
I'll connect you.
Lincoln Heights Division.
Hello, my name is Christine Collins.
I live at 210 North Avenue, 23.
and I'm calling to report a missing child.
missing child.
what's your relation to the child, ma'am?
it's my son.
how long has he been gone?
I'm not sure. I just got home from work.
it could be since this morning or it could be just the last hour.
have you checked around the neighborhood?
Yes, of course I did.
well, maybe he's lost track of time.
no. No, no.
he always stays around the house when it gets dark.
would you please send someone down here?
I'm sorry, but our policy is that we don't dispatch units on missing child cases for 24 hours.
what?
look, 99 times out of 100, the kid shows up by morning.
we don't have the resources to go chasing every kid who runs off with his pals.
no, no, no.
no, that's not Walter. He doesn't do that.
with all due respect, ma'am, every parent who calls says the same thing.
please, please.
look, there's nothing I can do.
I'll take your name and your information, but that's all until the morning, at the earliest.
I'm sure he'll show up by then. They always do.
are you Mrs. Collins?
our thoughts go out again today to Mrs. Christine Collins of Lincoln Heights, whose young son, Walter Collins, disappeared nearly two weeks ago.
though she is not a member of our congregation, we pray for her today as we have every day, since we learned of her plight.
on the radio and in the newspapers we are told that the Los Angeles Police Department is doing its very best to reunite mother and child, and I'm sure that that is true.
but given its status as the most violent, corrupt and incompetent police department this side of the Rocky Mountains
I am not sure it's saying a great deal.
every day, new bodies appear along Mulholland and in the ditches of our cities, the work of Police Chief James Davis and his aptly named Gun Squad.
every day, the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain.
every day, this city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption.
once the City of Angels, Los Angeles has become a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers.
where to be the law is to be above the law.
I understand. Thank you.
I will call back in a few weeks.
thank you very much.
Las Vegas Missing Persons Department?
Hello, this is Christine Collins.
I'm calling to see if you've found any missing or lost children who meet the description that matches Walter Collins.
Oh, all right. Well, please do. Please do call.
and I'll call back in a matter...
in a week, if that's all right. Thank you very much.
thank you.
2.0
hell, I think I left my wallet at home.
can I owe it to you?
no credit.
pay up or I call the cops.
I'm sick of bums like you coming around here.
I'm not trying to stiff you, chief.
I just left my wallet at home, that's all.
I'll go back and get it. Five, 10 minutes, tops.
got collateral?
you can't ask for better collateral than a man's own flesh and blood, right?
now, you stay here, son.
I'll be right back.
but... Now, don't give me any trouble.
he's a good man to trust us like this.
now, you just stay here and I'll go back and get my wallet.
ten minutes, then I call the cops.
Ah, hell.
number, please. Hello, Myrtle?
Hello? Yeah, this is Harve, down at the diner.
Oh, hi, Harve.
would you get me Sheriff Larsen?
sure thing.
you have a nice day, too.
Christine, I'm having trouble with the connection here.
I can't seem to get through.
I think so. Yeah, I think that's better.
you have a person to person call, Fairfax 2231.
long distance. Sorry, can you repeat?
I'll connect you right away, ma'am.
Thanks.
Mrs. Collins?
Yes.
I'm Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.
my office supervises all runaway and missing child cases, including your son's, and...
he's alive, Mrs. Collins.
he was picked up two days ago by local police in DeKalb, Illinois.
he's safe and unhurt.
he was in the company of some drifter. We have an APB out for him, but he's safe.
thank you so much.
Oh, Christine...
that is so great.
thank you.
there's so much press.
yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins.
people love happy endings.
we better get a move on, the train's pulling in.
back, boys. Back.
Thanks. Thanks, boys, thanks!
I'll have a statement for you in a few minutes, but the important thing right now is to reunite this little lady with her son, so if you'll excuse us.
stay right there. Come on, don't rush.
easy, easy.
Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you to James E. Davis,
chief of Police.
very nice to meet you.
we don't get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days, so it's good to be here with a positive story, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
I take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department?
I couldn't file a report for 24 hours, and I thought that maybe that was a...
technicalities aside.
it was wonderful.
well, good.
then you won't have any trouble telling that to the press, and the fact that the LAPD...
women.
hold on a second.
back, boys, back.
keep them back.
well, aren't you... Aren't you gonna...
that's not my son.
what?
what are you saying?
it's not my son.
well, I'm sure you're mistaken.
I'm not mistaken.
well, he's been through five terrible long months.
he's lost weight, he's changed.
I would know my own son.
all I'm saying is you're in shock and he's changed.
what's your name? Can you tell me your name?
it's a common name.
where do you live, Walter? You know your home address?
I live at 210 Avenue 23,
Los Angeles, California.
and that's my mommy!
Mrs. Collins, listen to me. I understand.
you're feeling a little uncertain right now, and that's to be expected.
a boy this age, he changes so fast.
we've compensated for that in our investigation.
and there's no question that this is your son.
that is not Walter.
it's not Walter as you remember him.
and that's why it's important for you to take him home on a trial basis.
a trial basis?
Yes, yes.
once he's around his familiar surroundings, and you've given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition, you will see that this is your Walter.
now, I promise you, I swear to you, I give you my word.
this is your son.
now, if you have any problems, any problems at all, you come and you talk to me.
I'll take care of it.
I give you my word. Trust me.
Mrs. Collins, he has nowhere else to go.
please.
maybe I'm not thinking clearly.
and...
all right.
all right, you're not thinking clearly, that's right.
here we go!
thank you. Thank you.
here, just turn around here.
how does it feel to have your son home, Mrs. Collins?
What'd you think when you saw him for the first time?
it's hard to explain.
she was shocked at first.
she didn't recognize the boy, which is perfectly natural.
he's been through quite an ordeal.
How're you feeling, son?
bet it feels great to be home.
Yeah. It's great.
the Los Angeles Police Department is thankful for all the hard work done by the DeKalb County Sheriff's Department in making this joyful reunion possible.
the LAPD is dedicated to serving the public at all times.
can we get a photo with mother and son, Captain?
Absolutely! Here we are.
like that. Like that.
squeeze together. There you go, boys.
this way, Walter. Big smile.
one more, please. That's a good one.
one more.
the sandwich all right?
would you like some more milk?
no.
no, thank you.
no, thank you.
you're covered in soot from the train. You should take a bath.
pajamas are on the edge of the bed.
you okay? You all right?
I fell. Stupid tub!
that's all right.
you're circumcised.
get out.
move.
last time I measured Walter, last time I measured my son, he was inches taller than you are now.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
who are you?
who are you?
he's not my son.
Mrs. Collins...
no, I don't know why he's saying that he is, but he's not Walter and there's been a mistake.
I thought we agreed to give him time to adjust.
he's three inches shorter.
I measured him on the chart.
well, maybe your measurements are off.
look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for all of this.
he's circumcised.
and Walter isn't.
Mrs. Collins.
your son was missing for five months.
for at least part of that time in the company of an as yet unidentified drifter.
who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done?
he could have had him circumcised. He could have...
made him shorter?
why aren't you listening to me?
I am listening, damn it, I am listening.
and I understand your feelings.
he's changed, no mistake, and that's...
you've both been through a terrible experience, and that's why he needs your love and support to bounce back.
he's not my son!
why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?
why are you doing this?
you seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy.
your job pays you enough to attend to his personal needs, so I don't understand why you're running away from your responsibilities as a mother.
I am not running away from anything!
least of all my responsibilities!
I am even taking care of that boy right now, because I am all he has!
what worries me is that you have stopped looking for my son!
why should we be looking for someone we've already found?
because you have not found him.
his identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they're doing.
and I don't?
I'm sorry.
I appreciate everything that this department has done and I know how hard you're working.
I really do, and I don't want to cause any trouble.
I just... There has been a terrible mistake, and I need you to help me correct it, so I can find my son before it's too late.
please.
I won't take up any more of your time. I'm sorry I got upset.
I'm sorry, very sorry.
Yes, Captain?
Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Collins? Yes?
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.
captain Jones sent me.
I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases.
may I come in?
Yes, thank you for coming.
I was beginning to think he didn't believe me.
well, I'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights.
Where's the boy?
Ah! There he is.
a handsome young man.
he has your eyes, doesn't he?
and a little bit of the nose.
very fit, in spite of all his travails.
a very resilient boy you've got here, Mrs. Collins.
I thought you were here to help me.
well, I am.
captain Jones said that the boy had been through some severe physical changes and asked me to drop in on him to reassure you in your time of motherly concern.
my motherly concern is not for him because he's not my son.
now, statements like that will hardly help the boy's self-esteem, now will they?
captain Jones said something about a change in height?
Yes.
come.
against the wall.
he's three inches shorter.
Ah, well...
hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.
we've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children.
given the stress of the past five months, his spine may have actually shrunk.
it's uncommon, but it's within the realm of possibility.
and circumcision?
very likely his abductor thought it appropriate.
after all, circumcision is hygienically sound.
must have been quite traumatic at the time.
no wonder he's submerged the memory.
I...
you see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this.
but it's right for you to raise the questions.
you need to be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence.
wouldn't I know whether or not he's my son?
I'm the mother.
which means you're in no position to be objective.
you are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember.
he isn't the same boy that left here.
just as a boy that goes off to war and then returns is not the same anymore.
and a mother's heart, driven by intuition and emotion, sees these changes and rebels, insists that this isn't your son.
doesn't change the facts.
I'm willing to put my theory to the test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.
are you?
it is absolutely outrageous!
calm yourself, calm yourself and just listen to me.
no, no, no. No, you listen to me, please.
this so called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood, like some kind of a derelict mother who didn't even know her own son.
and what was his findings?
he found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find.
Mrs. Collins. But that's not...
that's nothing to be embarrassed about.
that I was embarrassed is not the issue.
the point is that you are wasting time when you should be looking for my son.
but the report is final, Mrs. Collins.
well, then I want to receive the report, so I can refute it, before it goes to anyone else.
fine.
Yes. Good day.
I'm finished. Could I go to my room now?
Yes.
good night, Mommy.
stop saying that!
stop saying that!
I'm not your mother!
I want my son back.
you're not him. You're not my son!
I want my son back.
I want my son back!
damn you!
I want my son back!
I was wrong to yell at you.
you're just a child and I don't think you know what you're doing, and the hurt you're causing.
but I need you to understand that my son is my life.
he's all I have.
and no matter what the police think, and no matter what the world thinks, you and I, we both know the truth, don't we?
we both know that you're not Walter.
you just have to tell them that you're not my son, so they can find my son.
please.
we can talk tomorrow.
Hello?
is this Mrs. Christine Collins?
Yes.
my name is Gustav Briegleb.
I'm the pastor over at St. Paul's Presbyterian.
Oh, yes, I've heard your broadcasts.
I'm...
thank you.
have you read the Times this morning?
no.
well, maybe you should give it a gander and then come over here to the parish for breakfast, in, say, an hour. I think we should meet.
Hello?
mysterious case of...
acting on the request of the Los Angeles Police Department, "Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child specialist, examined Walter Collins "to determine the cause of his loss of weight, "paleness, confusion, and rundown condition "noticed since the return of the boy " to his mother last Monday.
lovely bit of phrasing, isn't it?
noticed since the return of the boy to his mother.
now, not only does that clearly state you're the boy's mother, but one could infer from it that you're somehow responsible for these changes.
and that the police department is concerned for the boy's welfare while he's in your charge.
you should try the eggs. They're very nice.
I examined the boy quite thoroughly,' Dr. Tarr said, And it's clear that he has something to tell.
I'm sure that in time he will give his boyish story of the entire affair, but not until he has faith in his listener.
and that is what is lacking here, faith in the poor lad's story.
course of my examination, I found nothing to dispute the findings of the LAPD.
why would they do this?
to avoid admitting they made a mistake when they brought back the wrong boy.
of course, anyone reading the newspaper with half a brain would see through it instantly.
sadly, that would exclude about half the readership of the Times.
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission in life to bring to light all the things the LAPD wish none of us ever knew about.
a department ruled by violence, abuse, murder, corruption and intimidation.
when Chief Davis took over the force two years ago, he said...
we will hold court against gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles.
I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least mercy to a criminal.
he picked 50 of the most violent cops on the force, gave them machine guns and permission to shoot anyone who got in their way.
he called them the Gun Squad.
no lawyers, no trials, no questions, no suspensions, no investigations.
just piles of bodies.
bodies in the morgues, bodies in the hospitals, bodies by the side of the road.
and not because the LAPD wanted to wipe out crime. No.
the LAPD wanted to wipe out the competition.
mayor Cryer and half the force are on the take.
gambling, prostitution, bootlegging, you name it.
because once you give people the freedom to do whatever they want, as the Lord found in the Garden of Eden, they will do exactly that.
this police department does not tolerate dissent, or contradiction, or even embarrassment.
and you are in a position to embarrass them and they do not like it.
they will do anything in their power to discredit you.
I've seen that happen too many times to start going blind now.
that's why I wanted to meet you, to let you know what you're getting yourself into and to help you fight it, if you choose to.
Reverend, I appreciate everything that you're doing and everything that you said, but I'm not on a mission.
I just want my son home.
Mrs. Collins, a lot of mothers' sons have been sacrificed to expediency around here.
your son, unfortunately, would not be the first.
but if you do it right, he may very well be the last.
he had two cavities that needed filling.
he put up a fight, but I took care of it.
And?
your son's upper front teeth were separated by a small tissue, a diastema.
it made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart.
the boy in that room has no such gap.
can that change with age? Because that's what they're gonna say.
in some cases, yes, it's possible.
but the tissue between Walter's teeth prevents that from happening.
see, they can never come together without an operation to sever the tissue, and I can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation.
would you be willing to put that officially in writing?
pardon my language, but hell yes.
sounds like the anesthetic's wearing off.
on the other hand, maybe I'll write that letter first.
give the little fella something to think about.
well, if it is, he's changed enormously.
do you know who I am?
you're a teacher.
Yes, but even teachers have names. What's mine?
I don't remember.
I know you, but I don't remember your name.
Mrs. Fox. Now, take your seat.
I didn't say take a seat. I said take your seat, the one assigned you.
you must know where it is, you've been sitting in it for over a year now.
Mrs. Collins, if that's your son, I'll eat my yardstick.
not only will I put it in writing, I will testify to it in a court of law or to the President Calvin Coolidge himself if I have to.
thank you.
I'll see you tonight for the broadcast.
good luck.
quick question, ma'am.
quick question!
Mrs. Collins.
hello. My name is Christine Collins.
good morning. MAN: Good morning.
on March 10th, my nine-year-old son, Walter Collins, disappeared.
and a five-month investigation led to a boy being brought to Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.
they told me and all of you that this boy was my son.
he was not my son.
the LAPD made a mistake, and that is the reason for the supposed transformation.
I have letters from his teachers and his doctors all confirming that he is not my son.
I'm having them reprinted now, and I'll have them for you tomorrow.
I have given the LAPD every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son.
since they have refused to do so, it has forced me to bring my case public.
and I hope that this now will persuade them to finish what they started and bring my son home to me.
thank you very much.
I want you to find the Collins woman and get her here.
and, Bill, bring her in the back way.
Yes, sir.
this way, miss.
why are we going in the back?
captain's orders. Front's jammed with reporters.
please, sit down, miss. Captain Jones'll be right with you.
Hey! Anyone want to take a call from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?
What'd they do, lose a moose?
they need a juvenile living here illegally deported back to Canada.
he's living with his cousin on some ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.
you want it? I'll take it.
got nothing better to do.
you're a prince.
Mrs. Collins.
you can leave the boy. She'll take care of him.
sit.
Oh, you've caused us quite a bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.
this situation has become an embarrassment for the entire police department.
it wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone.
Oh, no, of course not.
you just told the papers we couldn't tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case.
you trying to make fools out of us? Is that it? You enjoy this?
of course not.
I want you to find my son.
you know what your problem is, Mrs. Collins?
you're trying to shirk your responsibilities as a mother.
what?
you enjoyed being a free woman, didn't you?
you enjoyed not having to worry about a young son.
you could go where you wanted, do whatever you wanted, see anyone you wanted.
but then we found your son, and we brought him back.
and now he's an inconvenience to you.
and that's why you cooked up this scheme, to throw him to the state and get the state to raise him for you.
isn't that true? That is not true!
no? Well, even the boy says he's your son.
why would he say that?
how would he know to do that?
I don't know. I just know he's lying.
Oh, maybe so. Maybe he is a liar.
but that's how he's been trained, isn't it?
lying was born in both of you.
you're a liar and a troublemaker and, if you ask me, you got no business walking the streets of Los Angeles.
now wait a minute.
because either you know you're lying, or you're not capable of knowing if you're lying or telling the truth.
so, which is it?
you a derelict mother? Or just plain nuts?
cause from where I sit, those are the only options.
I'm not gonna sit here and take this.
you want experts? You want doctors? I have a few of my own.
matron.
Mrs. Collins, you still insist that the boy out there is not your son?
Yes, I do.
please, don't struggle. What?
No! You'll only hurt yourself.
what are you doing? Hold still.
you can't just do this. No, you can't.
you are to convey the prisoner to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward.
what?
you are to make the following entry.
defendant states she's been deceived by police and others, and that we have given her a boy and tried to make her think it is her son when she says it is not.
take her away. No. No, no.
please. Please.
come on, Mrs. Collins.
no. No.
this way.
Mrs. Collins has been known to us since about March 10th, 1928
when she reported her nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.
the boy was gone until August 1928. MAN: Okay.
since his return, she has complained that he is still missing and has made repeated requests that he be found.
she suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution and dislocation from reality.
she may be a threat to herself or others.
we recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward until her senses can be restored.
got another code 12.
name?
no, no, no, listen, this is a mistake.
certifying officer?
captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Heights Division.
no, no, please! Please! The police are trying to punish me...
if you keep it up, I'm gonna have to put you in a straitjacket.
do you want that?
no, ma'am.
then behave yourself. Code 12.
woman: I'm not mad!
please.
Oh, God.
all right.
No!
stop!
spread your legs.
what?
wider.
Oh.
I'm not sick!
touch me! Touch me!
inside. This is your room.
the doctor has left for the day. He will see you in the morning.
can I... I need to speak to somebody in authority.
sorry.
my room! No. No, no, no, this is my room.
can I make a phone call?
phone privileges are earned by good behavior.
you're not allowed newspapers, magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.
this is for your own good. Help me!
listen to me.
my room.
no, this is my room.
Oh, God!
my room.
no, no, this is my room.
my room.
my room! My room! My room!
my room!
they said it was my room!
you have a problem?
overheated, that's all. She'll be fine in a bit.
Hey, listen, could you give me a hand?
I'm trying to find a place called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.
Northcott Ranch, huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
you're almost there.
you just... You just follow this road west, about two, no, three miles.
and then you take that next right.
and you stay on that and it will bring you right to it.
is something going on out there?
no.
just looking into a juvenile matter.
thanks for your help.
sure.
Hello?
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
come here! Come here!
this is the police!
I have a warrant for a minor named Sanford Clark.
open the door or stand aside.
Hey! Stop!
stop! Stop it! Stop it!
stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face through this floor!
stop it!
fine!
give me your hands.
come on. Sit down.
Jesus!
what the hell is wrong with you, kid?
huh?
don't you know assaulting a cop is against the law?
what difference does it make?
we're just sending you back to Canada, son.
it isn't the end of the world.
what?
well, you can't stay in the U. S. As long as you want, pal.
no word from Mrs. Collins?
we haven't heard from her.
get on down to her house, make sure she's all right.
and if she's not there, check with her neighbors.
find out what they know.
Absolutely.
and now KGF welcomes the Reverend Gustav Briegleb of St. Paul's Presbyterian.
this is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, bringing you the Lord's word on Radio KGF.
good evening.
I had hoped to have a guest with us tonight, but apparently she has been delayed.
and since she cannot be here to tell you what she told the press this afternoon,
I'll have to fill in as best I can.
I'm going to tell you what happened and I'm going to keep on telling you every night, right here, until somebody does something about it.
the Desert Local, train number 45, will be arriving on track two in five minutes.
hello. I'd like a ticket to Canada.
alberta or Vancouver, whatever's leaving tonight.
I don't have anything going that far tonight.
the best I can do is put you on a train to Seattle.
from there you can transfer to a local or drive across the border.
that would be fine.
Roundtrip?
one way.
that'll be $15.
right.
there you go.
thank you. There you go. Enjoy your trip.
I will.
breakfast is half an hour.
please, miss, I need to see a doctor in charge.
the dining room is down the hall.
the doctor will call for you when he's ready.
do you want eggs or oatmeal?
okay, that's everyone that's here.
all right.
you can pull the oatmeal.
do you want it for tomorrow?
you know, just dump it. NURSE 2: All right.
you should eat.
eating is normal.
you gotta do everything you can to look normal.
it's the only chance you got.
I'm not hungry.
barbara, you have to eat now. I'm not hungry.
my name's Carol Dexter. What's yours?
now, finish it all. I know it's hard, but you gotta try.
Oh, boy.
I heard them talking.
you're here on code 12?
police action.
I mean, the doctors, the staff, they figure that if the police brought you here, there must be a good reason for it.
there isn't a good reason for it.
I'm perfectly sane and I will explain that to them.
how?
the more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look.
if you smile too much, you're delusional or you're stifling hysteria.
and if you don't smile, you're depressed.
if you remain neutral, you're emotionally withdrawn, potentially catatonic.
you've given this a lot of thought.
Yeah, I have. Don't you get it?
you're a code 12, so am I.
we're here for the exact same reasons.
we both pissed off the cops.
now, you see, you see that lady there?
she was married to a cop who kept beating her up.
when she tried to tell somebody about it, he brought her here.
woman: I want more juice.
and that one?
put your tray back where it belongs.
the police beat the crap out of her brother, broke both his arms.
when she tried to tell the papers...
and you?
I work nights.
sure.
I mean, I work nights.
Oh.
Yeah. In the clubs. Downtown.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, this one client just kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop, so I filed a complaint.
and it turns out he was a cop.
next thing I know, I'm here.
but they can't do that.
are you kidding?
all right, one more and then that's it.
everybody knows women are fragile.
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic, there's nothing going on upstairs.
somebody! Help me!
every once in a while they say something that's a little inconvenient, they just go fucking nuts.
pardon my French.
you gotta get those dishes. You got it.
if we're insane, nobody has to listen to us.
I mean, who are you gonna believe, some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of the force, or a police officer?
then once they get us in here, we either shut up and we learn to behave, or we don't go home.
are you all done?
or we go home like that.
stop. Stop it.
stop it! Stop it.
please.
here.
paperwork's come through.
you'll be deported back to Canada day after tomorrow.
police there will decide what to do with you next.
wait!
I'd like to talk to the officer who brought me in.
I'm sure he has far more important things...
please. It's important.
Christine Collins.
thank you. Mrs. Collins.
Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat.
I hope your stay with us has been comfortable so far.
Yes.
Really?
I'd think it'd be quite difficult at first.
Yes, it was.
of course it was very difficult, but comfortable enough.
I see that they have... They've taken a blood test.
the Wassermman Test.
they said it was to check for syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.
the idea that someone thinks you need to be checked for syphilis, does that upset you?
no, they said it was standard procedure, so it did not.
Yes, exactly. Standard procedure.
we have to cover all our bases.
I can imagine that for some people that would be uncomfortable, but I understood.
according to your file you believe that the police substituted a fake boy for your son.
no, I didn't say he was a fake boy.
he's not my boy.
they brought home the wrong boy.
my son is still missing.
well, that's strange, because I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming home your son.
that is you in the photo, isn't it?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
so, at first he was your son, and now he's not your son.
has this been going on for a long time?
people changing, becoming something other than what they are?
people don't change.
you don't think people change?
no, that's not...
the police, they're not out to persecute you?
no, they're not.
no, they're not.
the police are here to protect you.
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
well, that's odd because when you were admitted, you told the head nurse that the police were conspiring deliberately to punish you.
so, either the head nurse and the interns are also conspiring to punish you or you're changing your story.
do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?
no.
I'm sorry to bring you out in this weather, Detective, but the boy has been quite insistent.
it's all right.
I'll see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry.
it's raining cats, dogs, and Democrats out there, so this had better be worth it.
you again, huh?
we'll see.
well?
this isn't easy, okay?
yeah?
driving my ass here in the pouring rain wasn't easy either.
my cousin is Gordon Northcott.
he owns the ranch where you found me.
he said I could live there in exchange I watch the place when he's gone, doing chores and stuff like that.
said I could stay as long as I wanted to.
I thought that meant I could leave whenever I wanted.
Mmm.
you saying that he held you prisoner?
bull.
when I got there, you were running around free as a jaybird.
could've left any time you wanted.
no.
so, what's this, huh?
some kind of story to cover why you're in the country illegally?
no, it's nothing like that.
cause I don't have time for this, okay?
listen to me! He said...
what?
what did he say?
he said that if I tried to leave, he'd kill me.
look, you don't understand what he's like, what he... What we did, what he made me do.
all right.
let's start at the beginning then.
What'd he make you do?
we killed some kids.
what?
look, I didn't mean to, I swear. He made me help him.
he said if I didn't, he'd kill me, too.
look, you gotta help me, please. I'm so scared.
I don't want to go to hell for killing kids.
look.
what kids? What... What are you talking about?
I don't know. I never knew their names.
names?
how many?
how many kids?
all together?
about 20, I guess.
no, you're lying.
No! It's true, I swear!
you're gonna tell me you killed 20 kids?
Yeah! Thereabouts.
I stopped counting after a while.
gordon said maybe one or two may have escaped.
but...
no.
nobody can just up and kill 20 kids, okay?
we did.
we did.
how?
most times we'd just have one or two.
sometimes as many as three.
I always knew when we were getting ready to leave.
clean up the car.
make sure the tires were good.
check the engine.
cause he was afraid that the car would break down and we'd get caught.
my loving baby
we'd always go a different direction every time.
never hit the same part of town twice.
sometimes we'd just drive around for hours, till we found somebody.
well, there you are!
we've been looking for you like mad.
you have?
sure thing.
listen, your folks, they've been in an accident.
and they sent us to come find you. Now, they're hurt real bad.
the police took them to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you, so we said that we would do it.
now, come on.
all right. Get in here. Hurry.
listen, we gotta get you to that hospital so you can see your folks.
see, a lot of kids won't get in a car alone with a stranger, but when he's got a kid there...
there's a good boy.
scoot over. Scoot over, San.
...that made it easier.
I want you to hold on tight.
they'd look at me and say...
we've got a long way to go.
Hey, if he's safe...
and we are gonna fly.
...I guess I will be, too.
every time they got in the truck,
I just wanted to die.
as soon as we got back to the ranch, they went in the coop.
you boys hungry?
huh?
watch the door, Sanford!
Hey! Watch the door!
what's the matter?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
are you worried that I'm gonna hurt you?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
huh? Come here.
No! No! No! No! Please! I would never hurt you.
some days he'd do them right off.
other days he'd wait, pick up a few more, until he had about four or five of them.
Yeah.
No! No! No! GORDON: No what?
no what, huh?
come on. Come on. Come on!
sanford, keep your eye on that door!
No! Please, no! No! No!
No! No! No! No! Please! No! No!
he'd... He'd sometimes leave just one or two of them alive, barely, anyway.
he'd say, "Finish them, San.
finish them or... Finish them or I'll finish you.
and I did.
and I killed them.
and I did.
I killed them.
Oh, God, I killed them!
Oh, God! Oh!
Hey.
Hey.
what?
look at me.
I don't wanna be a product of my environment,
I want my environment to be a product of me,
years ago, we had the Church,
that was only a way of saying we had each other,
but now, I don't know. It's a funny thing.
it put hate in your heart.
the Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers, true guineas,
they took over their piece of the city,
twenty years after an Irishman couldn 't get a fucking job, , we had the presidency, May he rest in peace,
that's what the niggers don't realize,
if I got one thing against the black chappies, it's this:
no one gives it to you,
you have to take it,
vin, don't make me have to come down here again for this.
won't happen again, Mr. C.
Carmen's developing into a fine young Iady.
you should be proud.
you get your period yet, Carmen?
you Johnny Sullivan's kid?
you Iive with your grandmother? -Yeah.
vin, get him a couple Ioaves of bread, couple half-gallons of milk.
do you Iike bologna and cheese? Give him some cold cuts.
throw some mayo in. You Iike comic books?
you do good in school?
Yeah. -That's good. I did too.
they call that a paradox.
just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.
you ever wanna earn a Iittle extra money, you come by L Street.
you know where I am on L Street?
good.
good boy. -Thanks.
to you, oh Lord, we commend the soul of AIphonsus, your servant.
in the sight of this world, he is now dead.
forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness.
Amen. -The Church wants you in your place,
kneel, stand, kneel, stand.
if you go for that sort of thing, I don't know what to do for you.
a man makes his own way.
no one gives it to you.
you have to take it.
James Joyce. -Smart, Colin.
guineas from the North End, down Providence ...tried to tell me what to do.
and something maybe happened to them.
maybe Iike that:
jeez. She fell funny.
Francis, you really should see somebody.
when you decide to be something, you can be it,
that's what they don't tell you in the Church.
when I was your age, they would say we could become cops or criminals.
today what I'm saying to you is this:
when you're facing a Ioaded gun...
...What's the difference?
that's my boy,
terminal ballistics is the study of a projectile...
...as it hits a target and the destruction that it causes.
take, for instance, what you carry, 9 mm hollow-point.
when the hollow-point hits the skull, what happens is it mushrooms.
when it mushrooms it peels back, So you may have six, eight, ...ten Iittle particles of the bullet that are Iike razor blades
sir, yes, sir!
tearing their internal organs, their liver, their lungs, their heart, ... bringing tissue, bone, blood, brain matter, and that' s called a blowback.
fuck you. Fucking queers.
firemen getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire or pussy.
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree, you fucking homos.
pencils.
begin.
what are you Iooking at?
forget it.
your father was a janitor, his son's only a cop.
those fucking firefighters are a bunch of homos.
they are.
so she tells me, "You never finish anything. You finish the police course...
...you get taken care of again, baby." So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.
that's great. Your mother must be a wonderful woman.
fuck yourself.
put it this way. You're a black guy in Boston.
you don't need any help from me to be completely fucked.
the Massachusetts State Police has a Iong tradition of excellence.
your graduation today solidifies your acceptance...
...into one of the finest Iaw enforcement agencies in our nation.
as the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident...
...each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity.
congratulations to all our new troopers.
thank you. You are dismissed.
sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out of the gate, congratulations.
we're going for a beer. You wanna come? -No, I'II catch up with you guys.
school's out.
thank you, Frank.
you earned it.
no more pencils, no more books.
aII right.
this is not the regular police, this is the state police, -And fire!
your training will illustrate the difference,
state police, search warrant! State police, open the door!
what's the difference?
go, go, go! -Sir, yes, sir!
is that understood? -Sir, yes, sir!
move it, get the fuck down right now. Get down, right now.
congratulations on passing the detective's exam, and welcome...to the Special Investigation Unit.
Whoop-de-fucking-do.
we won't be working together, that is, directly.
you'II be working for Captain EIIerby, but I Iike to see everybody.
you're a worker. You rise fast.
like a 1 2-year-old's dick.
thank you, sergeant. -My pleasure.
thank you, sir. -Good Iuck.
Congratulations. -Thanks, hon.
you can go in there now.
you can sit.
so...
do you know what we do here? My section?
Yes, sir, I have an idea-- -Let's say you have no idea...
...and Ieave it at that, okay?
no idea. Zip. None.
if you had an idea what we do, we would not be good at what we do, would we?
we would be cunts.
are you calling us cunts?
staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own.
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.
so you have family connections down in Southie, right? Through your father?
why don't you tell us about your Uncle Jackie?
he was a carpet Iayer for Jordan Marsh.
uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.
he got popped by Nicastro in '95. We found his body out by the airport.
that's right.
I remember his funeral. -Oh, good.
cIosed casket?
that's right.
so tell anybody up at Deerfield
before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a chair.
you had an uncle met his demise Iike that?
I got a question.
how fucked up are you?
Hi, Darlene.
what you got, staff sergeant? In no time you made sergeant.
Siu. What a country. -Perfect.
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.
you know, if you went alone once in a while you might get somewhere.
we're cops, all right? This isn't somewhere.
aII right, Iookit, I know you're a worker. Maybe I can do something for you.
you got any suits, or do you Iike...
...coming to work dressed Iike you're gonna invade Poland?
you got quite the family tree. That maggot uncle of yours...
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof. He gets busted selling guns...to federal officers, among many, many, many other departures......from our normative behavior.
and what's this got to do with me?
why are you pretending to be a cop?
this unit is new, and you are the newest members of it.
you have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.
this is an elite unit.
our job is to smash or marginally disrupt...organized crime in this city by enhanced cooperation with the FBI...
...represented here today by Agent Frank Lazio.
and we will do it.
and by organized crime in this city, you know who we mean.
that's Jackie Costigan. That's an old picture.
Jackie met his demise.
last known photograph.
Costello uses three key guys.
that's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho, Iives in Brockton with his mother.
she's straight out of Going My Way,
delahunt, muscle.
French, the number one. But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.
we've done a briefing book, so read up. I want all ideas...
...so I can pass them off as my own.
work hard, you'II rise fast. You're in the best possible position in the department.
let's go to work.
your old man was a fucking hump from Southie.
baggage handler at the airport, right?
family's all criminals except for the old man, huh?
and one priest, since you seem to know everything.
last I heard he was married to a 1 2-year-old boy, Iiving on a beach in Thailand.
fucking family's dug into the Southie projects Iike ticks.
three-decker men at best. You, however, grew up...on the North Shore, huh? Well, Ia-di-fucking-da.
you were kind of a double kid, I bet, right?
one kid with your old man, one kid with your mother.
you're upper-middle class during the weeks, then you're hanging...
...in the Southie projects with your daddy, the fucking donkey......on the weekends. I got that right?
Yup. You have different accents?
you did, didn't you, you Iittle fucking snake?
you were Iike different people. -You a psychiatrist?
if I was, I'd ask you why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.
and I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud I wouldn't get an answer.
tell me, what's a Iace-curtain motherfucker Iike you doing in the staties?
well, families are always rising or falling in America, am I right?
who said that? -Hawthorne.
what's the matter, smart-ass, you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?
we have a question.
do you wanna be a cop, or do you wanna appear to be a cop?
it's an honest question.
lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.
a Iot of them just wanna slam a nigger through a window
I'm set without your own personal job application, sergeant.
what did you say? -Sir, what do you want from me?
Hey, he can't help you.
I know what you are. I know what you are...
...and I know what you're not.
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna help you understand something.
you're no fucking cop.
he's right. We deal in deception here.
what we do not deal with is self-deception.
five years from now you could be anything else in the world.
but you will not be a Massachusetts state trooper.
are you sure of that? -I'm sure of that.
Guaran-fucking-teed.
you had 1 400 on your SATs, kid. You're an astronaut, not a statie.
you don't have much family.
I don't have any family.
what's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman?
Stephanie, who was the only one who came to my father's funeral?
that Stephanie? -Yeah, that Stephanie.
nothing much to it, Uncle Edward. -Trying to prove something to the family?
when you say "the family," who do you mean exactly? You?
you always have to question everything, don't you?
maybe it would've done you some good to have some questions from time to time.
am I an asshole? Are my kids a mess?
is my wife a money-grubbing whore? I mean, those are questions, right?
have I ever been good to my dying sister, or am I just now pretending to be?
do you need some money for the funeral?
when my mother dies, we don't have any more connection.
it's Iovely. You get the high ceilings, the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.
the fridge has got an alarm in it in case you have eating issues, which is a joke. Not a very funny one.
well, there's a great view of the State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.
I mean, you move in, you're upper-class by about Tuesday.
so you're a cop.
a state-police detective.
and are you a married state-police detective?
no.
because this is kind of a-- Sort of a big place and
I have a co-signer.
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.
Yeah, it's got-- -Just give me the papers.
sure.
eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and Iet perpetual Iight shine upon her.
Amen. -May she rest in peace. Amen.
may her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace.
Amen.
so what do I do?
there's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a regular cop...
...but there's a bonus involved.
tax-free.
we can't conceal that you were a trainee. You'II be convicted of a crime.
we're thinking a guilty plea to assault and battery would make sense.
given your nature.
you'II do enough jail time to convince anyone this is no setup.
you'II be on probation, see a court-ordered shrink......the whole nine yards.
you wanna serve the Commonwealth, this is your chance.
we need you, pal.
you've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston.
every weekend, sergeant. -Perfect.
do it again.
for me.
Hey, you Billy Costigan? -Yeah, who wants to know?
well, nothing. I know a Sean costigan down on L Street.
Yeah, that's my cousin. -Connected. Not too bright.
Yeah, I know. -I mean, no offense.
Billy? -Yeah, it's me.
Oh, my God. Good to see you. -Aunt Kathy, how are you?
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.
they said you was in the staties. I couldn't believe it.
I got kicked out, Iike, four months ago.
Yeah, it was in the papers.
so you know.
and why are we graced with your presence?
I brought your mother some pictures of my father.
look at the smile. -My mother had them. My...
my mother's dead.
I'm sorry. Sorry for your troubles.
I was at a funeral myself, man.
Myles Kennefick. Knew him in school.
he was a young guy, you know? It's terrible. It's a shame.
you remember that. What a night. -Listen.
I got, Iike 30, 000 bucks, right? Insurance money. -Yeah.
you know, after my mother passed and everything.
in your Iine of work, if I gave you...Iike, what, say, 1 0, 000, what could I get back?
you know what you
you know what you usually say at these moments.
what? What? -Come on, man.
Oh, come on, you fucking moron. Come on.
what, you want me to say it?
I'm not a cop, all right?
I'm your fucking cousin. -You're bad.
you corrupt fuck, man. You must be my cousin.
fucking Ricans think they know everything.
if they knew shit, they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.
R is for Ricans P is for pigs
would you shut the fuck up for five seconds, huh?
that's right. You used to be a cop.
when we're working together just Iimit it to two eight-balls an hour.
we're not even supposed to be doing this shit this close to Worcester.
this side of Worcester.
says who? -Says him. Says Costello.
God says, as far as you're......concerned.
no, no, he's no cop. He got out of the joint three weeks ago.
cunt cop. -No, no, no.
he talks Iike his shit don't stink, but he's good people.
well, I knew his father.
I Iiked his Uncle Jackie better. -Jackie was all right.
uncle Jackie was excellent.
fucking guineas.
to Jackie. -Uncle Jackie.
cranberry juice.
it's a natural diuretic.
my girlfriend drinks it when she's got her period.
what, do you got your period?
Fucking--! -Get off!
get your fucking hands off me! -Hey. Hey, hey.
do you know me?
no. No.
well, I'm the guy that tells you there are guys you can hit...
...and there's guys you can't.
now, that's not quite a guy you can't hit...
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.
so I'm gonna make a fucking ruling on this right now:
you don't fucking hit him. You understand?
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.
I fucking know you. I know your family.
you make one more drug deal ...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet of a cousin of yours...
...and I'II forget your grandmother was so nice to me.
I'II cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
what are you drinking?
a cranberry juice.
what is it, your period?
get him a cranberry juice.
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.
what? "Oh," fucking what?
get the fuck out of here.
sorry I'm Iate.
staff Sergeant Dignam is our Iiaison to the undercover section.
his undercover work is extensive.
he's here to give us his report. Sergeant Dignam.
okay, my people are out there.
they're Iike fucking Indians. You're not gonna see them.
you'II hear about them through me or Captain Queenan.
you will not ever know the identity of undercover people.
unfortunately, this shithole has more Ieaks than the Iraqi navy.
fuck yourself. -I'm tired from fucking your wife.
how's your mother? -Tired from fucking my father.
good. Today, girls...
...what I have is microprocessors.
somebody, as you may already know, stole 20 microprocessors from the Mass Processor Company out on Route 1 28.
these are the kind they put into computers that could put a cruise missile up the ass of a came from a couple hundred miles away.
these pieces of plastic are worth about 1 00 grand apiece.
we got a guy working for the company two months...
...walks out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday...
...has a ticket for FIorida on Wednesday...
...but on Thursday, he gets found in a Dumpster.
you know where that dirtball started his Iife?
Southie projects.
what was his name, the departed? -Myles Kennefick.
got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass, Boston...
...which happens to-- -South Boston?
Oh, you're a fucking genius. Who forged your transcript, dickhead?
his old man runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.
we're not here to solve the case of the missing scumbag.
we're here to nail costello.
aII right, Iook. We got a guy says Costello's moving the processors to China.
he set up the whole fucking job and popped Kennefick.
you do not want to miss it if Costello takes a dump.
we'd miss Iess if you made your informants available to us and the Bureau.
without asking for too many details, do you have anyone in with Costello now?
maybe. Maybe not.
maybe fuck yourself.
my theory on Feds is they're Iike mushrooms.
feed them shit and keep them in the dark.
you girls have a good day.
normally he's a very nice guy.
don't judge him from this meeting alone.
now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.
I knew Myles.
he was younger than me, but he was behind me in school.
I wanna get these people who did this to him.
would you Iike to help us? You wanna help catch the people...
...who forced your son to do a robbery and then killed him?
AIIegedly.
if he was killed, he probably did something wrong.
but not the robbery. That's not wrong.
he did something else wrong?
wave to your girlfriend, honey.
I mean, fuck yourself.
did you get that? -"AIIegedly" or "fuck yourself"?
welcome to the neighborhood. -Different breed down here, sarge.
I need a cup of coffee.
you making a house call?
have I seen you professionally?
no, no. No, I know who you are, though. I know.
guys gotta use their service revolver in the course of duty...
...and then they get to come to talk to you about their feelings and whatnot.
no, no, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional.
I have an appointment on this floor.
Oh, well, you'II have fun. They're all frigging crazy on that floor.
I'm one more up. -Oh, fancy policeman.
Yeah, that's right, fancy. -Are you a statie?
Yeah, I am. I'm actually going to Iaw school also.
suffolk, nights?
Yeah, they don't run Harvard at night, Iast time I checked.
when's the Iast time you checked? -Before I went to fucking Suffolk.
okay, Iisten, I went to UMass. I wasn't insulting you.
well, I thought you were. So now you gotta buy me dinner.
maybe you can shoot someone and then see me professionally.
I'II stab someone in the heart with a fucking ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.
that's all right. I'm a detective. I'II find you.
no, sorry. I'm just joking. I need the card. card helps.
nice to meet you, Madolyn.
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail until I saw it.
no, I couldn't. I had the other guy with me, I couldn't
aII right, it's a blue sedan and then a white van.
it's fucked up with graffiti. And the van is the audio surveillance.
aII right, have a nice day.
cut him here.
Bye-bye.
Jerk-ass!
come on, Babu. I can't do anymore. I cannot hold off.
don't Iet me go back empty-handed. Don't do this. I wanna help you.
come to my store next Friday. I'II give you the money.
this is Friday, Babu. How many times I gotta tell you?
you keep on calling me Babu. It's Singh, motherfucker.
I'm trying to help you.
you keep telling me I'm your friend. You don't even know my fucking name.
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back again Iike Iast week.
because he wants to come back there and squash your head.
I have one customer sitting here. What I'm gonna do?
business is bad? You opened a store in an Irish neighborhood.
these are dirty people. Don't you know that?
sell potatoes, I don't know what you're gonna do.
excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry. -Know what I'm saying?
you fellas come from Providence?
it isn't any of your business, is it, now?
what, are you fucking delivering cannolis or something?
Hey! You are killing my business, man!
fuck!
what's wrong with this fucking country? Everybody hates everybody!
get out of here. Get out of here!
now, you also do probation work, right? -That's right, I see violent offenders.
Oh, bad guys. -Not necessarily.
Yeah, they got this but they don't got duck I'orange.
was your meal okay?
Yeah, no, the Iobster was good.
I just, you know, because it was a French restaurant I was surprised.
I'm waiting for you to make your move.
look, I don't know, if that thing moves, I'm gonna shoot it.
I don't even know what it is.
so what's it Iike having people find themselves in your office all day Iong?
does it get messy with all those feelings flying around?
why, does that make you uncomfortable?
no, no, no. -No?
no, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.
well, you know what Freud said about the Irish?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, if you actually do, I'II see you again.
who says I wanna see you again?
don't you?
you should see your face. -Don't you?
course I wanna see you again.
what Freud said about the Irish is...
...we're the only people who are impervious to psychoanalysis.
Yeah, he said that. -I know he did.
so you're up shit's creek with a client Iist full of mick cops.
I mean, opening up? Good Iuck to you.
why do you do it, then?
some people do get better.
fair enough.
sometimes I want people to forget their personal bullshit and do their jobs.
including the criminals?
if they don't do their jobs, you don't have one.
I'II always have a job. I'II just arrest innocent people.
wait. You are trouble. -You don't know the half of it.
I'II arrest you right now.
my word against yours, --then I see her dancing at the wedding with you-know-who.
I say, "Why don't you go to Parents Without Partners"?
he goes, " Ma, they're all Iosers at the Parents Without Partners,"
so I say to him, "Princess Carolina of Monaco..."
Schuyler.
do you know who I am?
no.
you met my friend Mr. French the other night.
his real name Mr. French?
no.
come with me.
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.
you know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence.
and this can cause me a Iot of problems.
those guys you tuned up...
...they're connected down Providence.
what they're gonna do is come back with some guys and kill you.
which, sure as you're born, they will do.
unless I stop them.
do you want me to stop them?
is this something I can't do personally?
I'm gonna have my associate search you.
no one's searching me. Search me for what?
Contra-fucking-band. Take your shoes off.
shoes.
I knew your father.
yeah? Do you know he's dead?
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?
stand. -He didn't complain.
Yeah, that was his problem.
who said he had a problem?
I just said he had a fucking problem.
there's a man could've been anything.
are you trying to say that he was nothing?
fuck. -I'm saying he worked at the airport.
he's clean. -Arm.
Yeah, come on.
what arm? What fucking arm?
show me your arm. FIip it.
makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood.
he's clean.
and if I can slander my own environment...
...it makes me sad, this regression.
Pius, I don't know if it's beyond some fucking cop prick Iike Queenan...
...to pull you out of the staties and send you after me.
I just can't know.
I don't know what they do in that particular department, anyway.
are you still a cop? -No! No!
swear on your mother's grave you're still not a cop?
I am not a fucking cop!
are you gonna stop doing coke deals with your jerkoff fucking cousin?
Yes. Yes, yes.
aII right, all right, all right.
you're okay. You'II be all right.
get your hand taken care of.
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.
as for our problem with Providence...
...Iet's not cry over spilled guineas.
who Iet this IRA motherfucker in my bar?
just kidding. How's your mother?
she's on her way out.
we all are. Act accordingly.
here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.
get in the car. I wanna show you something.
what's got you all hot and bothered? -Get in the car. You'II see.
do you trust him?
well, these days who's reliable?
his Uncle Jackie was.
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy acts Iike he's got nothing to Iose.
I'm reliable.
Arnold, you're one in a million.
ten. Ten million.
what about your wife, Arnold?
well, I thought she was.
she wasn't.
well, she got reliable.
don't you people ever shut the fuck up?
another county heard from.
one too many. She got a big mouth.
answer this for me, will you?
the principles of detection tell me these two gentlemen came from Providence.
lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.
Thanks.
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having posttraumatic stress.
can I meet you for Iunch?
aII right, see you then.
who's the Iead detective?
good. He's a Iox.
get the cops to Iook at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...
, and he'll say so,
look in his car, you'II find the gun that did it, registered, official. Providence.
in the trunk or the glove compartment?
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?
Hey, this will get Captain EIIerby on the 6: 00 news.
no wonder you get ahead.
have a seat, Bill.
do you know John Lennon?
Yeah, sure, he was the president before Lincoln.
Lennon said:
I'm an artist.
you give me a fucking tuba, I'II get you something out of it.
I tell you, Mr. costello...
...I'd Iike to squeeze some fucking money out of it.
Smart-mouth.
too bad.
if you'II indulge me...
now what?
choir practice.
choir practice...
the point I'm making with John Lennon is a man could Iook at anything...
...and make something out of it.
for instance...
...I Iook at you and I think:
what could I use you for?
get rid of this.
French.
put it downstairs, Here, Go ahead, thank you,
maybe we could work something out.
good. -And send this to his wife.
it was nice the way you asked the guy...
...which hand he jerked off with.
I hope this don't shake Rita up.
as I remember, she ain't that sentimental.
that was quick. You think he's dead already?
we have to do it by phone, I won't do it, ...if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Understand?
you don't know what this is Iike. -Microprocessors, -Micro what? -Microprocessors,
we'II probably be at war with the Chinese in 20-odd years...
...and Costello is selling them military technology.
microprocessors, chips, computer parts.
anybody says anything about anything like that, ...you Iet us know.
so who did the two guys from Providence?
Jimmy Pappas.
what happened to Jimmy Pappas?
Jimmy had a rough month.
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...
...and then he got himself knifed at Boston City Hospital.
I believe it's been in the papers.
you seem quite happy with that result.
it's a fucking result.
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?
cui gives a shit? It's got a frigging bow on it.
I think you are a cop, my son.
Where's your Iicense? -What Iicense?
I don't see none. There's no such thing as a Iicense, of course.
but you, you definitely need to have fucking one.
if you're not being run by us, you're being run by someone else.
that means you're bringing undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area.
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!
Hey.
that's Jimmy Bags.
he was rea-- I don't know. -What the fuck you doing?
I'm in the hole, I pay him two grand.
there's no profit, I pay him two grand.
then make more money. This is America.
you don't make money, you're a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?
make more money. -That's the spirit!
Oh, fuck. -Don't worry about it.
the guy don't need any fucking teeth anyway.
it's a small surveillance subunit, but it's mine.
I didn't take this job to fuck up or Iet anyone else fuck up.
I handpicked this group. You're my A team. Now, our prim
Hi, captain.
this crazy fuck knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
so?
he was-- -He was reaching for his cigarettes.
you're gonna give me shit? It wasn't for no reason, Frank.
he reached into his coat.
I don't know if he's a bookie or what he's doing.
well, you do know what a bookie does, don't you?
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.
queenan's compartmentalizing everything in SIU...
...which is the right thing.
I don't trust half the troopers out there anymore.
bottom Iine...
...we think we might have a problem.
we think Costello's got a rat in the state police.
Really? -Yeah, really.
do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers?
no, no, not presently.
but I'm working on that.
here, Bill, this is for you.
from now on, call the bar, ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.
you ask for Mikey because there is no Mikey.
you wait. We'II call you.
you got that? -Yeah, I got that.
sorry, I didn't hear you. -I got that.
good.
Hi, Dad.
I got promoted. AII right.
excuse me for one second.
you know...
...if your father were alive...
...and saw you here sitting with me...
...Iet's say he'd have a word with me about this.
in fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat.
and he could do it...
...which is maybe something you don't know about William Costigan Sr.
so he never--? I mean, never? -No. No, no.
he kept his own counsel. He never wanted money.
you can't do anything with a man Iike that.
your Uncle Jackie...
...he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you.
and I think about this.
so what the fuck are we talking about here?
did you ever think about going back to school?
school?
with all due respect, Mr. costello...
...school is out.
maybe someday you'II wake the fuck up.
good day, Fathers.
Mr. Costello. -Good morning, Francis, good morning.
you recall our chat?
little boys sucking on their peckers, et cetera and so forth...
"I am as God made me." Was that your rationale?
may I remind you, in this archdiocese, God don't run the bingo.
may I remind you that pride comes before the fall.
how's Sister Mary Theresa doing?
we had a tasty relationship before she took her vows.
enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.
pay them.
get the old bombardier a drink on the house.
what do you got for me? -Uniform clipped him for suspended Iicense.
however, he's a subject of an open investigation
more than one. He's one of costello's.
we're getting a warrant. Can't get an address off him.
he paged his Iawyer but the Iawyer hasn't called back yet.
who's the Iawyer? -Didn't know the name. Just a number.
beeper number.
and the guy didn't show up? -No.
and he beeped him? -Twice.
give me your phone. Turn that off.
what? -Turn the fucking camera off.
give it to me. He doesn't know what the fucking Iawyer Iooks Iike.
whose briefcase is this? AII right.
it's off? -You're good.
afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.
he can't do that. -He just did.
you my attorney? -What do you think?
have you made statements or phone calls...
...I need to be made aware of?
I beeped you.
the card they gave me. That's it.
that's it? -That's it.
you need to call your mother...
...tell her you're not gonna be home for supper.
camera's off. It's off. Call your mother.
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid right now.
I don't know where they're going, but they do. And so do you.
so make the call.
Lookit, fuckstick, you don't gotta trust me...
...just Iisten to what I'm saying to you.
mom, I'm not gonna make it home for supper.
sorry, yeah, I got held up,
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.
I'II talk to you Iater. Okay.
Bye.
everybody out. Move.
thank you.
so who are you?
I think you need a different attorney, Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.
so when the fuck am I gonna get out?
aII right, run the Iast number he called. That's his house.
I'II swear to the judge I surveilled him there...
...and abra-fucking-cadabra, we got a warrant.
why did you use my phone? -Because you didn't go in there.
the Iight's nice here in the morning.
so do you wanna talk about Iast night?
you know, it's all right. Guys tend to make too big a deal out of it.
it's actually quite common.
I gotta go to work.
do you Iie?
Why? Do you?
no, I'm asking if you Iie.
honesty is not synonymous with truth.
Yeah, you Iie.
you Iie.
is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally...
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?
well, I expect that some people do it to keep things on an even keel.
so you had a parent who was a drunk.
did you?
no.
let's keep it with you.
talk about how you feel.
how I feel,
how I feel, -Fuck. -Brian, stop it.
no. PIease. No.
ain't gonna hurt you.
you sit there, ...with a mass murderer.
a mass murderer.
your heart rate is jacked.
and your hand...steady.
that's one thing I figured out about myself in prison. My hand...
...does not shake.
ever.
wake the fuck up.
there was a cop Ieaving when I came in.
how did you know he was a cop?
bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight, you know, air of scumbag entitlement.
do you see cops? -That's part of what I do.
I normally don't see cadets who've been kicked out of the academy.
Oh, boy. You should get a better job, huh?
should I?
so do they all come in here...
...and cry, your cops?
sometimes they do. Yeah, sure. Sometimes they cry, yeah.
if they've had trouble at home, if they've had to use their weapons
use their weapons?
let me tell you something.
they signed up to use their weapons.
most of them, all right. But they watch enough TV...
...so they know they have to weep after they use their weapons.
there is no one more full of shit than a cop.
except for a cop on TV.
I looked at your file,
I see that you have a record of assault.
Yeah.
so what was it like for you in jail?
what, you wanna hear about the showers? Is that what you wanna hear about?
did something happen to you?
no.
okay, Iet's do this. Come on, spread them. -Hey, you think you can pop somebody...
...and there's a special card to play? Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...
...happens to work undercover for the Boston Police Department.
I'm going nuts. I can't be someone else every day.
it's been a year. I've had enough!
calm down. Most people do it every day. What's the big deal?
well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay? -Exactly.
you're nobody. You signed the papers, remember?
we're the only two people on this earth that even know you're a cop.
how about we just erase your file, huh?
how about we erase your file...
...and you're just another soldier for Costello...
...open to arrest for I don't know how many felonies. What do you say?
how about I fucking kill you, huh? How about I fucking kill you!
that was a joke. come on. -That wasn't a joke.
you play a tough guy, doesn't mean you are one...
...you Iace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy! -Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!
fuck you, motherfucker! -Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!
for chrissake, be smart.
if anybody's watching us now, how are we not supposed to arrest you?
come on, get in the car.
both of you, get in the car.
when are you gonna take Costello?
what's wrong with taking him on any one...
...of the million felonies that you've seen him do or I've seen him do?
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?
the guy fucking murders somebody and you don't fucking take him!
what are you waiting for? Do you want him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?
that what you want? -That'd stick.
will you shut up?
we are building a case and it takes time.
you know that.
something's wrong.
I'm telling you, something's wrong.
Yeah, maybe.
look, we need you to keep your ears open, all right?
no bullshit.
I think Costello's got a spy inside the Special Investigation Unit.
you serious?
I'm afraid so.
have you heard anything Iike that?
Jesus christ.
hang tight for me, kid.
just a Iittle while Ionger.
we are this close:
aII right?
what do you expect coming in here?
I have to come here. -I know you have to come here.
but now that you're here...
...what do you want?
you want the truth?
valium.
if you Iied, you would have an easier time getting what you wanted.
what's that say about what you do? -We should have a few more meetings...
...before we even talk about prescriptions. -Look, I'm having panic attacks.
other night, I thought I was having a heart attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.
is that true? -Yeah, that's true.
I said something fucking true. I want some fucking pills...
...and you're gonna close my file?
I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I-- -I thought I was supposed to tell...
...the truth here, if only fucking here. -You are! Yes.
a guy comes in here against every instinct of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...
...and what do you do?
what do you do? You send him off on the street to score smack? Is that what you do?
you're fucking ridiculous.
two pills?
why don't you just give me a bottle of Scotch...
...and a handgun to blow my fucking head off?
are we done with this psychiatry bullshit? -You can Ieave!
what did I just put myself through? I'm out of here.
and what if that was a Iegitimate threat? Think about it, fucking hotshot.
fuck,
why is the Iast patient of the day always the hardest one?
you're tired and you don't give a shit.
it's not supernatural. -Listen.
listen. You know, I'm not just somebody that you have to see or they put you in jail.
okay? I mean, if you're in distress, I will help you.
what's this?
it's my card. And a prescription for 20 Iorazepam.
yeah?
is it enough to commit suicide?
maybe it is. AII right? Okay?
have I done my job up to your goddamn standards?
because according to my standards, you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.
you know, and too damn bad if you don't Iike my initial clinical reaction.
thank you.
I'm transferring you to another counselor.
good. -Okay.
so you wanna get a cup of coffee?
bring it in here, please. Would somebody bring it in?
come on in.
our target is a major transaction of microprocessors.
Yes, those.
I don't know what they are, you don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.
lots of cash is gonna change hands inside a building...
...that we have under AV surveillance close-by.
I know this Iocation is not the best, but we had very Iittle time to set up.
you guys know anything about this? -No.
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys and Iisten in on the phones.
our unit will not take action.
I repeat, not take action, until a man that Captain Queenan has inside...
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?
anybody? Any questions? No? This is who we're after.
we've been after this cocksucker for a Iong time, and tonight...
...we are going to get him. Let's go to work.
aII right, you guys find out what we're doing and get on it.
sorry to get you Iast-minute, but things Ieak.
this Iead came from Queenan's undercover guy.
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.
Hi, Dad? -Yes.
Yeah, something big came up at work, -I'm not gonna be home for supper. -Too bad,
your mother worked all goddamn day.
we'II just have to sit down without you and your friends.
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.
so we'II just-- I'II just see you for Iunch instead tomorrow.
your mother will be proud.
aII right, thanks, Pop. Bye.
the readiness is all.
you know the players. call the game.
thank you.
you ready? -Is your highness...
...gonna drop me off at confession before work, or fuck me, or what?
what have you got to confess to that anointed pederast?
a confessional seal, these days...
...I'm not so sure.
he'II operate the cameras. You ID the guys and Iog them.
aII cell-phone signals are under surveillance...
...through the courtesy of our federal friends over there.
patriot Act, Patriot Act. I Iove it, I Iove it, I Iove it.
keep an eye on this one.
aII right, here we go.
there's costello. Mr. French.
there's Fitzy, Delahunt...
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.
time is 1 0: 46.
aII right, turn off your cell phones.
Fitzy's got the chicken. Check your weapons.
we have a blind spot. -Why do we have a blind spot?
we had two hours' notice. Two hours.
fuck you think this is, NASA? -It never crossed my mind.
have you got a camera in the back? -What back?
how you going, Robert? -Good, Mr. Costello.
I wanna tell you, at Ieast two of these gents have machine guns.
he's from the chinese government. He's scared shitless.
government man. Scared.
I'm concerned about a chinaman who thinks it's wise...
...to come to a business transaction...
...with automatic weapons.
for his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids...
...None of us are carrying automatic weapons.
because here, in this country...
...it don't add inches to your dick.
you get a Iife sentence for it.
if we had some Homeland Security money Iike some douche bags I could mention...
any calls? -They turned off their cell phones.
search randomly for calls made from the area.
eight hundred and seven phones are Iive in this area.
then narrow the area.
what you see there for service is what you're gonna get.
why did they turn their phones off?
wait. There's still one phone up. -Where?
the buyers are there.
you know, direct contact with your guys would have its advantages.
not to my guy.
this is unbelievable. Who put the cameras in this place?
Oh, who the fuck are you?
I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.
if these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan any time in this century...
...they'd better shape up and show me 1 million dollars.
what we generally do, in this country...
...is one guy...
...brings the items...
...and the other guy...
...pays him.
no "tickee..."
...no Iaundry.
go ahead, Fitz.
cars are moving, but did you see anybody come out?
pIease tell me those cars aren't empty.
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!
they didn't figure we had a navy.
did you put a camera in the back?
can I talk to you for a second, please?
you stupid fucking hard-on!
you fucked this whole thing up!
what the fuck did you do, you cocksucker? Let go of me!
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off and shove it up your fucking ass!
why don't we meet? Let me buy you an ice cream.
I'm getting on a plane unless you put Queenan on,
queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down.
why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane, huh?
meet up? You actually want me dead?
look, there is a rat in your unit. That is a fact, all right?
Where's Queenan? -He's not here.
they knew you had cameras in the building. They knew everything.
there is a Ieak from the inside. It's real. Man, smoke him out.
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who- Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have a sealed wiretap warrant...
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our division, but tell SIU.
fIush it down the pipe, see if it comes out on my end.
that's what we do first. Narrow it down.
where the fuck is Queenan, huh? -He's not here,
you wanna meet up or you got something real, call me back.
changing your Iife radically.
change anything. Right? Change everything.
right? -Yeah.
how Iong you been with this guy?
my boyfriend? -Yeah.
four months. AImost four months. -Four months.
do you Iove him?
it's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.
it's very serious.
is he a headcase Iike me? I'm just curious.
no more than I am.
I know that it's a serious relationship.
I know there are ups and downs. Right?
people have doubts and problems.
well, not problems, but doubts.
what would you do if he was standing right there and he saw us?
I would Iie. Yeah, I would Iie.
you know, to keep things on an even keel, right?
right? We talked about that.
morning. -Good morning.
want a French doughnut?
Yeah.
Hey, can I Iook it? -Yeah.
sure.
aII right, we're not having this out. -What?
you don't see any pictures of where I came from.
look, I respect who you are...
...just, you know, not in the Iiving room.
we might have company.
company? -Yeah, company.
Hey, now, why do you work for the state? -Why not? You do.
no, what you do. The degrees and all, everything you got. You're hot shit.
yeah?
I know I should know this, darling, but are you mad at me?
baby. Holly.
I did something, right? I did something bad, right?
should I know what it is?
or is it something maybe you just think I did?
no, no. I did it. I did it.
it was a bad, bad thing I did, and I'm so sorry, luv.
Holly, come on, will you?
Holly, wait. Baby......you have to let me in on it.
or are you waiting until we're in the apartment before you talk to me?
are you gonna make me sleep in the bathtub again?
Oh, no, I don't know what I said.
you said it. You know you said it. - No, I don't know what I said...
...but I didn't mean it. - You mean everything you say.
sometimes I mean nothing when I say something.
something is never nothing. It's always something.
most of what I say is nothing. Just something to say.
men say it's just something to say to get away with saying something......but they know they're saying something. - Say what? What did I say?
you said at my mother's, you would have a baby but I'm not ready.
to my mother! You might as well have said I'm a lesbian.
well, I am the only man you ever had.
Oh, I dated Timmy Harrison for four months before I met you.
isn't he a woman now? - Aah!
you told my mother I didn't want children!
I did not. I didn't say that. - Yes, you did.
Yes, you did. You said exactly that. - I did not.
I didn't say that you weren't ready to have a baby. I said that you wanted to wait.
which means I don't want one right now.
right. - Thank you.
wait a minute. I'm confused. Can I get a ruling on this?
no, you're not confused. You're just wrong.
Holly doesn't wanna have a baby." We had a plan, Gerry.
to wait to have children until we could buy an apartment......put 25 percent of each paycheck into a separate joint account......with a 6. 25 interest for 5 years. Why didn't you tell my mother that?
Ha-ha-ha. Each paycheck?
darling, you only just started getting regular paychecks.
you quit five jobs in two years, remember? - Well, I can't work for idiots.
they can't all be idiots. - Yes, they can.
they can all be idiots. And why didn't you tell my mother......about the business loan you and John took out without asking me?
Oh... Aha!
you see, you... You finally said it.
I knew that's why you're angry. - That's not the reason.
it is not the reason.
it is the reason. - We should have waited.
waited for what? What? I've been driving limos for four years, Holly.
so John and me, we wanna start a business. We buy a few cars, we get a few clients.
that's a career right there. What is your problem?!
what if it doesn't work? What if we always have to live here?
and what about what I want, huh?
you think I wanna be a real estate agent......showing apartments to buy that I can never live in?
there may be other things I wanna do with my life.
okay. Like what? - I don't know. Other things.
then quit, all right? The job makes you cranky at home every bloody day anyway.
you wanna have a baby? Let's do it. - See?
I hate when you do that. - Hah. Do what?
let's have a baby." La-la-la!
in a five-floor walkup we can barely move in. I'd change diapers on the windowsill.
you have to have a plan. You can't act like everything's just gonna work out by itself.
why do I have to be the responsible grownup who worries?
why can't I be the cute, carefree Irish guy who sings all the time?
because you can't sing without making dogs bark.
look, Holly, people have babies with no money all the time.
if you're so worried about it, why don't you stop buying designer clothes?
I buy everything on eBay.
it doesn't count when you're wearing Marc Jacobs from Minneapolis.
do you want to have a baby?
do you? - Yes, I do.
see? - See what?
I know what you're really saying even when you don't say it.
you mean the two conversations thing.
the one we're having and the one you think we're having.
you said that to my mother because you're mad at me for not wanting children yet......and because I'm no fun anymore and we don't have enough hot, nasty sex......because I'm always bitching about bills. Why don't you just be honest and say it?
say what you mean.
all right.
I wish we had more hot, nasty sex.
or the other kind is fine.
what you're really saying is this isn't the life you wanted, is it?
well, that's not what I'm saying. Is that what you're saying?
and what if this is it, Gerry? What if this is all there is to our life?
what do you mean? - It means this is it.
we're a married couple who own a limo company...
...who may or may not have children, end of story.
well, what other story do you want? - I don't know. L...
what do you want, Hol? What?
because I'm tired of trying to figure it out.
you want a bigger apartment? I'll take a second job.
you want a child, you don't want a child. What?
I know what I want because I have it in my hands right now.
do you? Do you know what you want?
because you better tell me now if I'm not it.
or what? You gonna leave?
you want me to leave? - Lf you wanna leave.
don't use me as an excuse. - I'll leave if you want me to.
then leave if you wanna go.
don't push me. - You wanna leave, just say goodbye.
Oh, that's me bollocks!
stop acting bilingual. - Oh, kiss me arse.
kiss mine in English!
are we finished now, luv? Can I come back?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, luv. Ahhh. - I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said the wrong thing to your mother.
God, I still get nervous around her.
I still think after nine years, she doesn't like me.
I know I'm being stupid.
no, you're not being stupid, baby. She doesn't like you.
Really? And I thought deep down, she really loved me.
no, she doesn't. I was 19 when we got married.
and you corrupted me with sex and charm......and the longer it takes you to make your fortune, the less sexy and charming you are.
hmm.
what? What are you looking for?
me balls. They were hanging there a minute ago.
my mother said it was a mistake marrying you because I loved you too much.
it won't last.
I don't wanna make any mistakes, Gerry.
well, you're in the wrong species, luv. Be a duck.
my baby.
we're not a mistake just because we don't have any money.
and we are gonna last.
you know how I know?
because I still wake up every morning......and the first thing I want to do is see your face.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I see people buying bigger apartments and having babies.
I get so afraid sometimes our life's never gonna start.
no, baby.
we're already in our life.
it's already started. This is it.
you have to stop waiting, baby.
and Hol, you can't keep eating me head off, telling me to leave.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not your dad.
or don't you know that yet?
I should get my shoes.
they're all over the place. They're gonna think I don't love them.
Whoo!
shake it, baby.
do the stomach shake.
Whoo!
Oh! Ow! Aah! Ooh!
my eye! I'm blind.
Oh, I just wanna lick your little Glaswegian chocolate.
okay, okay. I can't believe I'm in love with a leprechaun.
Oh, wait. The light. You were up last. - The light?
no. - You were up last.
but I'm not up now, am I? Baby, look, I'm injured. My eye.
God. A pain in me hole.
that's a good girl. That's a good girl.
come on, get back to bed or I'm gonna start without you.
Aah! Shit.
you okay? - Shit, no! My toe! Oh! Ow!
I tell you what. Someone should get a light, that side of the bed. It's ridiculous.
ridiculous.
I'll get my next husband to do it. - Oh, come here.
next husband. Oh-ho-ho. Next husband. Come here, you.
I'm sorry I lose my mind sometimes.
did it hurt you? Let me look. - Will you shut up and kiss me, okay?
you crazy bitch. Pain in me hole.
Oh, Daniel, we forgot those Thanksgiving decorations. Will you take them down?
sure, Mrs. Reilly. Where do you want them?
Patricia. In the skinny closet. Have you got the key?
no, I don't.
I'll make you a set next week.
and ask Gerry's drivers to close the curtains, will you?
sure.
go ahead. Thanks.
John. - What?
Oh, Denise. - Hi.
Oh, it's good to see you. - Do I have to help?
no, you do not have to help. - Good.
Sharon, you look great. - Hi.
Hi. This is good. - So do you.
am I late? - No. This is gorgeous.
wait till you see Gerry. You're gonna die.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
well, as Gerry would say, let's get this party started.
Gerry Kennedy did not want a lot of words. He preferred music.
he was a unique young man......as you can see by the urn he had designed by the love of his life......his wife, Holly.
his life may be over for now, but we can still hear it.
he lives in us forever in our hearts......like his favorite song.
got on a lucky one
came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
this year's for me and you
so happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
when all our dreams come true - You're a bum, you're a punk - You're an old slut on junk
lying there almost dead On a drip in that bed
you scumbag, you maggot You cheap, lousy faggot
happy Christmas, your arse I pray God it's our last
the boys of the NYPD choir Still singing "Galway Bay
and the bells are ringing out For Christmas Day
Aww.
mama, how you doing?
Ciara. - Oh, sis, good to see you.
Oh, good to hold you. - Oh.
Hello, Gerry.
Hi, I'm Denise. - Matt.
I love your tie. - Oh, thanks.
are you single, Matt? - Yes.
are you gay? - Yes.
okay.
did Holly call his parents? Why aren't they here?
I did, I spoke to the mother.
his father's just had another operation. He's not supposed to travel.
so why didn't she come alone?
I mean, it's Ireland, it's not Japan. It was their only son.
don't ask me.
Hi. - Hi.
I like your chain. - Thanks.
Denise. - George.
are you single? - Yes.
are you gay? - No.
are you working? - No.
you make a ravishing widow, sis.
Thanks.
I'm so glad you're here, but it's so far. I would've understood.
no, I'm done with Australia. Besides, Gerry wrote me I had to.
he wrote you?
Yeah, a couple of months ago. Probably because of Mom.
he knew I'd have melodrama for her to play with......while you pull yourself together.
can I get you anything?
Mm.
I'm sorry about your loss. - Thanks.
how did he die?
a brain tumor. - Nice!
so that's a great looking urn.
I wish I were that creative.
I buried my dog in a stereo box.
it's not the same.
I love your suit. - Thanks.
are you single? - Yes.
are you gay? - No.
are you working? - Yes.
Denise. - Sam.
Oh.
when Gerry and I went to a bank to apply for a business loan......I was a little nervous. Gerry told me:
relax, these people are never gonna give us the money......so we might as well have some fun.
no, don't clean.
no, I have to do something. I can't talk anymore.
wanna stay with us while your sister's here? - No.
I think...
you know, I think I should be home.
I think I need to be...
...home. - Well...
...this is your home too, you know.
but that's good. Get back on your feet.
that's a good thing.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo.
leave a message.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo. Leave a message.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo. Leave a message.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo. Leave a message.
Holly? It's Mom. Are you all right?
are you showering? Don't make me worry.
I'm worried you're not calling me back.
I know it's hard, honey, but don't lock yourself in. It's been over a week.
I'm here, okay? Hey, it's Denise.
listen, I buzzed your apartment. Nobody's heard from you.
where are you? All right, call somebody. I love you.
I'll make him pay for it. I will.
whatever you might do, I can do more..... because I know how to fight better than you.
why can't I be Bette Davis?
all right? I mean, the job...... makes you cranky at home every bloody day anyway.
you wanna have a baby? Let's do it.
see? I hate when you do that. Hah. Do what?
let's have a baby." La-la-la!
in a five-floor walkup we can barely move in.
you can't act like everything's just gonna work out by itself, Gerry.
why do I have to be the responsible grownup who worries?
if you're killed, I'll be free.
if I'm killed, it really doesn't matter.
if we both die, good riddance!
go ahead, crash it. Crash it!
Gerry, get the light.
it's your turn.
I just want to see you
when you're all alone
I just want to catch you if I can
I just want to be there When the morning light explodes
on your face it radiates I can't escape
I love you till the end - Do all Irishmen sing? - Heh.
I'll love you till the end
Ah. Only the really well-hung ones.
I can't fall asleep alone.
I'm right here, baby.
I had a terrible dream.
don't tell me.
Gerry, I don't wanna go back to work.
what should I do? - Quit.
stay here with me.
I don't have a plan, Gerry.
that's okay, luv, your plans never work out anyway.
hmm.
that's true.
Whoo!
happy birthday!
you're 30!
Hey, Holly...
...these were falling out of your mailbox.
what is that smell?
I wasn't expecting company. Mom, don't clean.
I'm not. I'll just organize the garbage. - We did try to call first.
are you drunk? - No.
do you wanna be? - Ciara.
what happened to your head?
pimple.
you're not showering? - You always squeeze it too hard.
what is that smell? - It's me, all right?
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be like that.
like what? - Like the only Ionely widow in Gotham City.
I'm just... exhausted.
Yeah, well, what are you doing, two shows a night?
you know, if you want us to leave, that's fine......but you do know that at some point, this all has to stop.
all right.
just give me a second, okay? I'll get cleaned up.
okay, troops, let's sweep the area. - Yes.
I haven't called the office. Are they mad?
Nah. There's no rush.
even Larry said, "Take all the time you need. The job is there when you're ready.
that was nice of him.
he's an asshole. - He's still an asshole.
do you think it'll be all right if I stop my life right here?
become the Miss Havisham of the Lower East Side.
never leave my apartment till I'm old.
sit in my wedding dress. - Which you never had.
with an old piece of wedding cake. - Which you never had.
you gotta be rich to be insane, Hol.
losing your mind is not a luxury for the middle class.
I'll get it. - That's so not fair.
no, it's not.
Holly? Something's been delivered for you.
what is this?
I don't understand. Did you do this? - No.
wait a minute.
John, tell me the truth. Did you do this? - No. I did nothing, I swear.
Hey, baby. Surprise.
I know this probably feels a little bit morbid...... but I just hate the idea that I'm not gonna be there...... to see you freak out over turning 30. I mean, it kills me not to be there.
Heh-heh. That's funny.
no, it's not. - Okay. No, it's not.
you're gonna be so impressed. I have a plan, baby. Can you believe it?
I've written you letters. Letters that will be coming to you all sorts of ways.
I waited till your birthday. I figured you weren't stepping out of the house...... for a while. Letter number one will be arriving tomorrow.
now, you must do what I say, okay?
okay?
don't try to figure out how the letters are coming.
it's too brilliant and it'll ruin my plan. Just go along with me on this.
because the thing is, I just can't say goodbye yet.
so for starters...... I want you to get dolled up, and just go out and celebrate tonight.
go out with your girlies.
I hereby free you from a party with your family, especially your mom.
Oh, man, your mom's there, isn't she?
Mm. Shit.
sorry, Patricia.
it isn't that I don't love you...... but she needs to get a little crazy. So have a slice of the bloody cake...... put on your dress and get out of the apartment.
Denise, make a plan. - I'm on it!
I'll help. - Just leave me with John, okay?
and know that wherever I am, I'm missing you.
happy birthday.
I love you.
come on. - Look, it's a private gay club.
Yes, but we are on the list. My colorist called and he's gay.
gay colorist in New York? Like sand on the beach.
listen, Crystal. Don't mess with her.
he's a very good colorist. - Uh-huh.
and she's the princess of Finland.
and she's here on matters of critical political importance.
and she's here to extend the hand of friendship from Finland...
...to homosexuals... That's us!
...throughout the tri-city area.
what?
Thanks.
great. You're fired.
okay. "Snaps" is the name of the game. The name of the game is "Snaps.
make sure you pay attention.
ready?
have you got it?
Mariah Carey?
I don't get it.
Paul. - God, he's been dead, like what?
fifteen years. - Unbelievable.
can you believe that? - You remember Steve?
steve was so sweet. He was a good guy.
honey, don't be so Miss Doom and Gloom. - You'll be fine.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Snaps" is the name of the game.
the name of the game is "Snaps.
do you hear me? - Yeah.
ready? Keep looking.
Derek Jeter!
come on. No. - How?
this is a stupid game.
sorry.
what are you doing?
trying to figure out why God killed my husband.
well, if you need any help with that, let me know.
Ow! - Sorry. Heh.
Daniel? - Yeah.
so why do you think?
your husband died?
maybe you're being punished for something.
what? - Being too happy? Too beautiful?
I don't know. God can be a pretty jealous guy.
I don't believe that. I've never been too happy. I'm not too beautiful.
I think you're hot.
sorry, I have a syndrome.
I don't really have a filter. I don't pick up on social cues.
you mean you're rude?
Yeah, but now it's a disease I can take medication for.
they have pills for rudeness?
I know. And they can't figure out the Middle East. Go figure.
Hey, you're Irish. Maybe it's an Irish curse or something.
well, Gerry and I did love the Yankees......which was pretty much against our religion.
well, there you go.
Really?
Yeah, she slept with my best friend. She left me.
Oh...
my best friend was a woman.
Oh.
her last words to me were, "I'd still be with you if you weren't a man.
and I'm like:
well, castrating me is definitely the first step toward achieving that particular goal.
it's still my fault. I introduced them.
I always had this fantasy about making love to two women at the same time.
except in my fantasy, I was still in the bed for the second and third time.
sorry. - Then this'll make you feel great.
...and she was my business partner, and we started the business with my money.
how'd you get over that?
I went through, like, a major hooker phase all year.
but that didn't help.
no, it helped a lot. I just started to run out of money.
it's actually a lot cheaper to date.
do you think that you're gonna ever find another woman to love?
no.
no, I think I repel the women that I want the most.
that's not true.
no?
no?
thank you, Daniel.
you can start closing up downstairs.
right.
what do you want?
Oh, good. A friendly voice. Oh.
what happened last night?
lemon drops and tequila, my friend.
the moment where a 30-year-old body does not recover quite as fast......as a 29-year-old body.
stop screaming at me.
are you working? - Hell, no.
but I told him we're gonna start next week. We'll go out starting Monday.
is that okay? - No, I was planning on......staying in bed and dying today.
well, you can't.
you gotta go check the mailbox, remember?
call me immediately.
save yourself bruises and buy yourself a bedside lamp.
and remember, a disco diva must look her best.
go buy yourself a knock-out outfit. You'll need it for when my next letter comes.
need it for what?
and I know you hate your job, but I'll help.
look for a sign. You'll know what to do.
P. S. I love you.
I still know you're around.
you're still here, aren't you?
so who lived here before?
a family. They're having another baby. So do you have any children?
three. Girls. Teenagers.
that's nice.
Uh-huh.
Ted, Sharon says there's another offer on the table......and we have to move on this.
I think if you offer another hundred grand, they'll back down.
well, maybe we should talk about it.
we don't have time, Ted. We have to tell her today.
we didn't wanna go over...
I know, but we love this apartment, and it is what it is.
there's nothing else. This is what an apartment costs.
we're already beyond our cap. - We'll make it work...
think about another area. - I am not living in Brooklyn.
will you listen to him? What?
he's obviously worried about this.
look at him. He's pale. - Hol.
who are you to tell me how to talk to my husband?
you shouldn't push this on him if he doesn't want to.
I'll push what I want on him. He's my husband.
I want this apartment.
say no, Ted. - It is amazing that you are still talking.
don't listen to her. - Ted, she's being a tyrant.
she's got your balls on one of those things that cling back and forth.
you know? - Yeah.
you bitch. - Brat.
shut up! - You shut up!
no, you shut up! I will end you, and when I do...
you know what? I'll tell you... - No. No. No. Okay, tell me.
he's my husband, I'll talk to him the way I want to. I'm not living in Brooklyn!
do you know who I am? What's wrong with Brooklyn, lady?
are you Holly Kennedy?
lf I am, will you sing? - Yes.
no, I'm not. - Please don't make this an issue.
I gotta sing and deliver a letter. - A letter? What's the song?
yah Mo Be There. - Just give me the letter.
I could get reported. - By the leprechaun union?
you know, I was in an off-Broadway play with Al goddamn Pacino.
I don't need this shit. You want the balloons?
no. - Fine.
you bastard.
there's no way I'm doing this.
Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are. - Oh, no, I'm not.
remember the last time?
thank you very much.
Oh, my God.
Whoo! - One more!
okay. I guess it's time to give somebody else a chance here now.
who wants a shot?
anybody else here willing to give it a go?
yourself? No? Young lady.
come on. Don't be shy.
what about Holly? - Stop it.
Holly. I don't know about that, John.
Holly's my wife, by the way. My beautiful wife.
and I do... I love Holly, I do.
but she would never have the guts...
Oh!
...to do something like this.
Oh, no.
in fact, she ate me head off about coming out tonight.
you know, she had a long day at the office.
Ah. She'll never do it.
Yep.
Oh, you think so?
you think she'd get up here? Okay, I'll bet you 100 dollars...
...she doesn't get up on this stage. Oooh.
make it two.
what is she doing? What is she doing? - Ha-ha-ha.
that's my wife, the surpriser.
Holly!
all right.
Oh! - Oh, God!
do you mind coffee?
how do you feel? You look good.
I'm sorry, baby, but I have to say you were really good before...
my nose is broken, Gerry. My ankle is twisted. Happy?
are you mad at me? - I didn't wanna go out......and you made me.
I hate karaoke and you forced me to go up there.
come on, honey. It was nobody's fault.
Oh, come here, baby. Give me a...
give me a kiss.
well, how long are you gonna be mad for?
I never let him off the hook.
anytime I was mad, I made him feel bad.
I was mad when we left the house that night.
I was mad at him because our apartment was too small. So stupid.
baby, you were married.
married people make each other feel like shit on purpose sometimes.
it just feels good.
Gerry knew you were crazy about him. He told me all the time.
well, I wish I would've told him that night.
so tell him now.
it's slightly dirty. Just slightly.
Ooh.
he's delicious, isn't he?
you could serve coffee on that ass.
do you have to be so vulgar about men, like they're pieces of meat?
I'm sorry, John. I forgot you're sensitive about your flat ass.
Hoh.
you know, Denise, that's why you're not married.
Ahem. - Women act like men...
...then they complain men don't want them.
Oh, is that why? Oh.
okay. Because I thought it was something different.
I thought it was because I thought that I deserve the best.
and he's out there. He's just with all the wrong women.
and let me be clear.
after centuries of men looking at my tits instead of my eyes and pinching my ass instead of shaking my hand I now have the divine right to stare at a man's backside with vulgar, cheap appreciation if I want to.
well said. - I thought so.
new York City, how we doing? Huh?
Hey, guys, we're here! Yay!
give a warm welcome to our next singer.
rumor has it this is her return engagement. Put your hands together for Holly.
this is for you, Gerry, you son of a bitch.
I just wanna tell you
nothing you don't want to hear
all I want is for you to say
Oh, why don't you just take me Where I've never been before?
I know you want to hear me Catch my breath
I love you till the end
I love you till the end
I love you till the end
okay, let me get this straight.
you're straight, you're single, and you own your own business?
it's my own club.
I'm doing a big renovation right now.
it'll open in the spring. - Mm-hm.
I could show it to you if you want. It's over on Tenth Avenue. Wanna go?
great.
Yeah. Let me just do one thing first.
what's my name?
Tom. - Where have you been?
with all the wrong women.
Hey. - Hi.
Hey, Gerry. You lost weight.
thanks for inviting me.
you're a terrible singer.
Yes, I am.
I'd be really embarrassed if I were you. - Did you take your medication today?
no, I thought I'd come here instead.
say, I'm feeling kind of hungry. You feel like getting a bite or something to drink?
no, I'm... I don't think so.
it's all right. - Thanks.
I don't mean to throw this at you, but what do women want?
I can't figure it out. They want us to ask.
they don't want us to ask. They want us to make a move, not make a move.
they want us to be on bottom, be on top.
use hair products, don't use hair products.
what do you people want?
I'll tell you, but you have to promise not to say I told you.
l... I swear. - Because it's a sacred secret.
sacred secret.
you ready? You sure? - Yeah. I think so.
come here.
we have absolutely......no idea what we want.
I knew it! I knew that! Son of a bitch! - Ooh!
Yeah.
look, if you ever just wanna get out......just do anything, just...I'll wait for your call.
and just so you know, I'm not looking for a thing right now.
I'm just flirting in good faith. - I appreciate that.
maybe we can defy God.....and go see a Yankees game. - Yeah.
we'll be really weird friends, joined by self-pity, bitterness and vomit.
I'd like that. - Me too.
my leather jacket is for you. I always loved the way that looked on you.
but the rest of my stuff, you don't need it.
make some space in that bloody apartment for yourself. Go on.
it's time, baby.
P. S. I love you.
I think you're a little bit perverted.
I mean, you bring me to an Irish famine memorial......and we're eating corned beef sandwiches. That's pretty sick.
Gerry thought it was the best way to honor the dead.
you know, show them how well we're doing.
I'm sorry I always bring him up.
Yeah, I'm starting to get a little bit sick of it.
now that's a real honest-to-goodness couple right there.
they've probably been together since the Flood.
we're so arrogant, aren't we?
we're so afraid of age, we do everything we can to prevent it.
we don't realize what a privilege it is to grow old with someone......someone who doesn't drive you to commit murder.
or doesn't humiliate you beyond repair.
it's sweet.
it's good, huh?
can I ask you a favor? Sure.
I started bagging up Gerry's stuff. Couldn't finish.
I think I need someone who didn't know him to get rid of it all.
be happy to help you get rid of Gerry.
do you have to say it like that? - Like what?
what is wrong with you? Take a pill. - Nothing. What?
what's wrong?
nothing, I...
I've just never been alone with another man in this apartment besides Gerry.
want me to stand out in the hall? You can just throw me the boxes.
no. Heh.
that's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna change.
look through stuff. If there's anything you want......just let me know. - Okay.
I can't remember the last time somebody held me like this.
did you find a new husband yet?
shut up.
where have you been?
I haven't felt you around lately. - Oh, please.
I've been so around.
I can feel you hugging me.
that's because I am.
you look great.
this is the one.
are you Barbara? - Yes, may I help you?
I hope so.
you're his wife.
he was here?
so I don't understand. You're taking a vacation?
it's a trip.
Gerry planned the whole thing for me and Sharon and Denise.
you think it's the best time to vacation?
Gerry made all the arrangements. I have to go.
have you spoken to Daniel? Thought you two were spending time together.
we're just friends, Mom.
I've stood by and not said anything about all this, but now I think it's time it stopped.
what do you mean? - It's not healthy.
Gerry's not gonna be able to keep this up forever, is he?
his life ended, and so will his letters.
you're gonna have to face things on your own.
it was a gift from Gerry.
and how can you say that?
my husband was 35 years old. He wasn't supposed to die.
but he did. It was awful.
it's what happens.
but his death is a part of your life now. And you have to deal with it.
stop saying that like I'm not dealing with it. I am.
how? By waiting for a letter from a dead husband?
taking a vacation? When your father left, I had two children to support.
excuse me for not having any children. - That's not how I meant it and you know it.
your father leaving was just as devastating.
but I did what I needed to do and got on with it.
it's not the same thing. - Why not?
my husband died. He was taken. He didn't wanna go, he didn't wanna leave.
Yes, my husband wanted to leave.
and it's so much easier being abandoned by choice, is it?
I've had my say.
I won't say anymore.
so where's he sending you?
Oh, my God.
get the bags.
Oh.
all right. - She just elbowed me.
know what? If that's an indication of how this trip's gonna be, I won't have it.
is that her bag? Is that her bag?
leave it. Don't take it in. - This is ridiculous.
Holly?
this is heavy. - I know.
Holly!
look.
Hey, Big Mama. Make sure my baby has a good time.
make sure you and John do everything you wanna do......whenever you wanna do it.
and make sure my baby does things.
I want you to take her fishing." - Oh, God.
he's been wanting to get me on a lake since forever.
and be sure to give yourself a big, sweaty pony-boy kiss from me.
Ugh. Jerk. He will never let me forget my bachelorette party.
Joey the Pony Boy.
Tony. - Tony.
Tony, I remember him. I bet I have a letter too.
where would he hide one for me?
bedroom.
Denise, take Holly to Whelan's, my favorite pub.
there's beautiful music to be heard, beautiful people to be around.
and Denise, you're going to heaven for being my baby's friend.
I'm making all the arrangements up here for you.
got a few hot men lined up. I hear Ben Franklin's hung like a racehorse.
love you.
I don't know how you do this. - Let me see it.
what?
he didn't leave me a letter.
well, probably didn't love you......as much as us. - Mm-mm.
Oh my God, look at that. Look at that!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Oh. Please let me buy him as a souvenir.
he's coming this way. - He's coming.
how long has it been?
how long has what been?
how long has it been?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
you're gonna go talk to him. Oh, yeah. - Mm. No.
you just heard him. Say how much you like it, flatter him. Go.
we don't have those in the States.
go, go. We don't make those.
you're ready. - Go! Do it for us. Go on.
Where'd she go? - What are you doing? Go ahead!
I'm an old married widow.
Oh, you've got much better stuff than those tarts. You're experienced.
you're American. You got foreign exotic stuff going...
there's nothing exotic about being an American.
he doesn't know that. - We'll help you.
just take it off. No, no, no!
listen! You're gonna do what we say.
I'm gonna hurt you. I'll pull your hair.
you look hot. Put your shoulders back. Puff your hair a little.
you're so sexy. Go. - Yeah, you look hot. Do it!
Hi.
I just wanted to say I really loved your music.
you're beautiful. I mean... I mean... Sorry.
your music is beautiful.
thanks... Um...
Holly. - William.
you're American? - Yeah.
and what brings you to Ireland?
holiday. Oh, well, with my girlfriends.
Hi. - Hi.
good. Good to have you here.
Heh. Thanks. - I have one more song to play.
will you stay and have a listen?
baby, Holly.
I did something, right? I did something bad, right?
should I know what it is?
or is it something maybe you just think I did?
no, no. I did it. I did it.
it was a bad, bad thing I did, and I'm so sorry, luv.
Holly, come on, will you?
Holly, wait. Baby...
...you have to let me in on it.
or are you waiting until we're in the apartment before you talk to me?
are you gonna make me sleep in the bathtub again?
Oh, no, I don't know what I said.
you said it. You know you said it. - No, I don't know what I said...
...but I didn't mean it. - You mean everything you say.
sometimes I mean nothing when I say something.
something is never nothing. It's always something.
most of what I say is nothing. Just something to say.
men say it's just something to say to get away with saying something...
...but they know they're saying something. - Say what? What did I say?
you said at my mother's, you would have a baby but I'm not ready.
to my mother! You might as well have said I'm a lesbian.
well, I am the only man you ever had.
Oh, I dated Timmy Harrison for four months before I met you.
isn't he a woman now? - Aah!
you told my mother I didn't want children!
I did not. I didn't say that. - Yes, you did.
Yes, you did. You said exactly that. - I did not.
I didn't say that you weren't ready to have a baby. I said that you wanted to wait.
which means I don't want one right now.
right. - Thank you.
wait a minute. I'm confused. Can I get a ruling on this?
no, you're not confused. You're just wrong.
Holly doesn't wanna have a baby. We had a plan, Gerry.
to wait to have children until we could buy an apartment...
...Put 25 percent of each paycheck into a separate joint account...
...with a 6. 25 interest for 5 years. Why didn't you tell my mother that?
Ha-ha-ha. Each paycheck?
darling, you only just started getting regular paychecks.
you quit five jobs in two years, remember? - Well, I can't work for idiots.
they can't all be idiots. - Yes, they can.
they can all be idiots. And why didn't you tell my mother...
...about the business loan you and John took out without asking me?
Oh... Aha!
you see, you... You finally said it.
I knew that's why you're angry. - That's not the reason.
it is not the reason.
it is the reason. - We should have waited.
waited for what? What? I've been driving limos for four years, Holly.
so John and me, we wanna start a business. We buy a few cars, we get a few clients.
that's a career right there. What is your problem?!
what if it doesn't work? What if we always have to live here?
and what about what I want, huh?
you think I wanna be a real estate agent...
...showing apartments to buy that I can never live in?
there may be other things I wanna do with my life.
okay. Like what? - I don't know. Other things.
then quit, all right? The job makes you cranky at home every bloody day anyway.
you wanna have a baby? Let's do it. - See?
I hate when you do that. - Hah. Do what?
let's have a baby. La-la-la!
in a five-floor walkup we can barely move in. I'd change diapers on the windowsill.
you have to have a plan. You can't act like everything's just gonna work out by itself.
why do I have to be the responsible grownup who worries?
why can't I be the cute, carefree Irish guy who sings all the time?
because you can't sing without making dogs bark.
look, Holly, people have babies with no money all the time.
if you're so worried about it, why don't you stop buying designer clothes?
I buy everything on eBay.
it doesn't count when you're wearing Marc Jacobs from Minneapolis.
do you want to have a baby?
do you? - Yes, I do.
see? - See what?
I know what you're really saying even when you don't say it.
you mean the two conversations thing.
the one we're having and the one you think we're having.
you said that to my mother because you're mad at me for not wanting children yet...
...and because I'm no fun anymore and we don't have enough hot, nasty sex...
...because I'm always bitching about bills. Why don't you just be honest and say it?
say what you mean.
all right.
I wish we had more hot, nasty sex.
or the other kind is fine.
what you're really saying is this isn't the life you wanted, is it?
well, that's not what I'm saying. Is that what you're saying?
and what if this is it, Gerry? What if this is all there is to our life?
what do you mean? - It means this is it.
we're a married couple who own a limo company...
...who may or may not have children, end of story.
well, what other story do you want? - I don't know. I...
what do you want, Hol? What?
because I'm tired of trying to figure it out.
you want a bigger apartment? I'll take a second job.
you want a child, you don't want a child. What?
I know what I want because I have it in my hands right now.
do you? Do you know what you want?
because you better tell me now if I'm not it.
or what? You gonna leave?
you want me to leave? - If you wanna leave.
don't use me as an excuse. - I'll leave if you want me to.
then leave if you wanna go.
don't push me. - You wanna leave, just say goodbye.
Oh, that's me bollocks!
stop acting bilingual. - Oh, kiss me arse.
kiss mine in English!
are we finished now, luv? Can I come back?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, luv. Ahhh. - I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said the wrong thing to your mother.
God, I still get nervous around her.
I still think after nine years, she doesn't like me.
I know I'm being stupid.
no, you're not being stupid, baby. She doesn't like you.
Really? And I thought deep down, she really loved me.
no, she doesn't. I was 19 when we got married.
and you corrupted me with sex and charm...
...and the longer it takes you to make your fortune, the less sexy and charming you are.
hmm.
what? What are you looking for?
me balls. They were hanging there a minute ago.
my mother said it was a mistake marrying you because I loved you too much.
it won't last.
I don't wanna make any mistakes, Gerry.
well, you're in the wrong species, luv. Be a duck.
my baby.
we're not a mistake just because we don't have any money.
and we are gonna last.
you know how I know?
because I still wake up every morning...
...and the first thing I want to do is see your face.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I see people buying bigger apartments and having babies.
I get so afraid sometimes our life's never gonna start.
no, baby.
we're already in our life.
it's already started. This is it.
you have to stop waiting, baby.
and Hol, you can't keep eating me head off, telling me to leave.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not your dad.
or don't you know that yet?
I should get my shoes.
they're all over the place. They're gonna think I don't love them.
Whoo!
shake it, baby.
do the stomach shake.
Whoo!
Oh! Ow! Aah! Ooh!
my eye! I'm blind.
Oh, I just wanna lick your little Glaswegian chocolate.
okay, okay. I can't believe I'm in love with a leprechaun.
Oh, wait. The light. You were up last. - The light?
no. - You were up last.
but I'm not up now, am I? Baby, look, I'm injured. My eye.
God. A pain in me hole.
that's a good girl. That's a good girl.
come on, get back to bed or I'm gonna start without you.
Aah! Shit.
you okay? - Shit, no! My toe! Oh! Ow!
I tell you what. Someone should get a light, that side of the bed. It's ridiculous.
ridiculous.
I'll get my next husband to do it. - Oh, come here.
next husband. Oh-ho-ho. Next husband. Come here, you.
I'm sorry I lose my mind sometimes.
did it hurt you? Let me look. - Will you shut up and kiss me, okay?
you crazy bitch. Pain in me hole.
Oh, Daniel, we forgot those Thanksgiving decorations. Will you take them down?
sure, Mrs. Reilly. Where do you want them?
Patricia. In the skinny closet. Have you got the key?
no, I don't.
I'll make you a set next week.
and ask Gerry's drivers to close the curtains, will you?
sure.
go ahead. Thanks.
John. - What?
Oh, Denise. - Hi.
Oh, it's good to see you. - Do I have to help?
no, you do not have to help. - Good.
Sharon, you look great. - Hi.
Hi. This is good. - So do you.
am I late? - No. This is gorgeous.
wait till you see Gerry. You're gonna die.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
well, as Gerry would say, let's get this party started.
Gerry Kennedy did not want a lot of words. He preferred music.
he was a unique young man...
...as you can see by the urn he had designed by the love of his life...
...his wife, Holly.
his life may be over for now, but we can still hear it.
he lives in us forever in our hearts...
...like his favorite song.
got on a lucky one
came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
this year's for me and you
so happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
when all our dreams come true - You're a bum, you're a punk - You're an old slut on junk
lying there almost dead On a drip in that bed
you scumbag, you maggot, you cheap, lousy faggot
happy Christmas, your arse I pray God it's our last
the boys of the NYPD choir Still singing Galway Bay
and the bells are ringing out For Christmas Day
Aww.
mama, how you doing?
Ciara. - Oh, sis, good to see you.
Oh, good to hold you. - Oh.
Hello, Gerry.
Hi, I'm Denise. - Matt.
I love your tie. - Oh, thanks.
are you single, Matt? - Yes.
are you gay? - Yes.
okay.
did Holly call his parents? Why aren't they here?
I did, I spoke to the mother.
his father's just had another operation. He's not supposed to travel.
so why didn't she come alone?
I mean, it's Ireland, it's not Japan. It was their only son.
don't ask me.
Hi. - Hi.
I like your chain. - Thanks.
are you single? - Yes.
are you gay? - No.
are you working? - No.
you make a ravishing widow, sis.
Thanks.
I'm so glad you're here, but it's so far. I would've understood.
no, I'm done with Australia. Besides, Gerry wrote me I had to.
he wrote you?
Yeah, a couple of months ago. Probably because of Mom.
he knew I'd have melodrama for her to play with...
...while you pull yourself together.
can I get you anything?
Mm.
I'm sorry about your loss. - Thanks.
how did he die?
a brain tumor. - Nice!
so that's a great looking urn.
I wish I were that creative.
I buried my dog in a stereo box.
it's not the same.
I love your suit. - Thanks.
are you single? - Yes.
are you gay? - No.
are you working? - Yes.
Oh.
when Gerry and I went to a bank to apply for a business loan...
...I was a little nervous. Gerry told me:
relax, these people are never gonna give us the money...
...so we might as well have some fun.
no, don't clean.
no, I have to do something. I can't talk anymore.
wanna stay with us while your sister's here? - No.
I think...
you know, I think I should be home.
I think I need to be...
...home. - Well...
...this is your home too, you know.
but that's good. Get back on your feet.
that's a good thing.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo.
leave a message.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo. Leave a message.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo. Leave a message.
Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo. Leave a message.
Holly? It's Mom. Are you all right?
are you showering? Don't make me worry.
I'm worried you're not calling me back.
I know it's hard, honey, but don't lock yourself in. It's been over a week.
I'm here, okay? Hey, it's Denise.
listen, I buzzed your apartment. Nobody's heard from you.
where are you? All right, call somebody. I love you.
I'll make him pay for it. I will.
whatever you might do, I can do more...
... because I know how to fight better than you.
why can't I be Bette Davis?
all right? I mean, the job...
... makes you cranky at home every bloody day anyway.
you wanna have a baby? Let's do it.
see? I hate when you do that. Hah. Do what?
let's have a baby. La-la-la!
in a five-floor walkup we can barely move in.
you can't act like everything's just gonna work out by itself, Gerry.
why do I have to be the responsible grownup who worries?
if you're killed, I'll be free.
if I'm killed, it really doesn't matter.
if we both die, good riddance!
go ahead, crash it. Crash it!
Gerry, get the light.
it's your turn.
Mmm.
I just want to see you
when you're all alone
I just want to catch you if I can
I just want to be there When the morning light explodes
on your face it radiates I can't escape
I love you till the end - Do all Irishmen sing? - Heh.
I'll love you till the end
Ah. Only the really well-hung ones.
I can't fall asleep alone.
I'm right here, baby.
I had a terrible dream.
don't tell me.
Gerry, I don't wanna go back to work.
what should I do? - Quit.
stay here with me.
I don't have a plan, Gerry.
that's okay, luv, your plans never work out anyway.
hmm.
that's true.
and all because of the man
that got away
no more his eager call
the writing's on the wall
the dreams you dreamed Have all
gone astray
the man that won you Has run off and undone you
that great beginning Has seen a final inning
don't know what happened
it's all a crazy game
no more that all-time thrill
for you've been
and never a new love
will be the same
good riddance, goodbye...
Whoo!
happy birthday!
you're 30!
Hey, Holly...
...these were falling out of your mailbox.
what is that smell?
I wasn't expecting company. Mom, don't clean.
I'm not. I'll just organize the garbage. - We did try to call first.
are you drunk? - No.
do you wanna be? - Ciara.
what happened to your head?
pimple.
you're not showering? - You always squeeze it too hard.
what is that smell? - It's me, all right?
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be like that.
like what? - Like the only Ionely widow in Gotham City.
I'm just... exhausted.
Yeah, well, what are you doing, two shows a night?
you know, if you want us to leave, that's fine...
...but you do know that at some point, this all has to stop.
all right.
just give me a second, okay? I'll get cleaned up.
okay, troops, let's sweep the area. - Yes.
I haven't called the office. Are they mad?
Nah. There's no rush.
even Larry said, "Take all the time you need. The job is there when you're ready."
that was nice of him.
he's an asshole. - He's still an asshole.
do you think it'll be all right if I stop my life right here?
become the Miss Havisham of the Lower East Side.
never leave my apartment till I'm old.
sit in my wedding dress. - Which you never had.
with an old piece of wedding cake. - Which you never had.
you gotta be rich to be insane, Hol.
losing your mind is not a luxury for the middle class.
I'll get it. - That's so not fair.
no, it's not.
Holly? Something's been delivered for you.
what is this?
I don't understand. Did you do this? - No.
wait a minute.
John, tell me the truth. Did you do this? - No. I did nothing, I swear.
Hey, baby. Surprise.
I know this probably feels a little bit morbid...
... but I just hate the idea that I'm not gonna be there...
... to see you freak out over turning 30. I mean, it kills me not to be there.
Heh-heh. That's funny.
no, it's not. - Okay. No, it's not.
you're gonna be so impressed. I have a plan, baby. Can you believe it?
I've written you letters. Letters that will be coming to you all sorts of ways.
I waited till your birthday. I figured you weren't stepping out of the house...
... for a while. Letter number one will be arriving tomorrow.
now, you must do what I say, okay?
okay?
don't try to figure out how the letters are coming.
it's too brilliant and it'll ruin my plan. Just go along with me on this.
because the thing is, I just can't say goodbye yet.
so for starters...
... I want you to get dolled up, and just go out and celebrate tonight.
go out with your girlies.
I hereby free you from a party with your family, especially your mom.
Oh, man, your mom's there, isn't she?
Mm. Shit.
sorry, Patricia.
it isn't that I don't love you...
... but she needs to get a little crazy. So have a slice of the bloody cake...
... put on your dress and get out of the apartment.
Denise, make a plan. - I'm on it!
I'll help. - Just leave me with John, okay?
and know that wherever I am, I'm missing you.
happy birthday.
I love you.
come on. - Look, it's a private gay club.
Yes, but we are on the list. My colorist called and he's gay.
gay colorist in New York? Like sand on the beach.
listen, Crystal. Don't mess with her.
he's a very good colorist. - Uh-huh.
and she's the princess of Finland.
and she's here on matters of critical political importance.
and she's here to extend the hand of friendship from Finland...
...to homosexuals... That's us!
...throughout the tri-city area.
what?
Thanks.
great. You're fired.
okay. "Snaps" is the name of the game. The name of the game is "Snaps."
make sure you pay attention.
ready?
have you got it?
I don't get it.
Paul. - God, he's been dead, like what?
fifteen years. - Unbelievable.
can you believe that? - You remember Steve?
steve was so sweet. He was a good guy.
honey, don't be so Miss Doom and Gloom. - You'll be fine.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
"Snaps" is the name of the game.
the name of the game is "Snaps."
do you hear me? - Yeah.
ready? Keep looking.
come on. No. - How?
this is a stupid game.
sorry.
what are you doing?
trying to figure out why God killed my husband.
well, if you need any help with that, let me know.
Ow! - Sorry. Heh.
Daniel? - Yeah.
so why do you think?
your husband died?
maybe you're being punished for something.
what? - Being too happy? Too beautiful?
I don't know. God can be a pretty jealous guy.
I don't believe that. I've never been too happy. I'm not too beautiful.
I think you're hot.
sorry, I have a syndrome.
I don't really have a filter. I don't pick up on social cues.
you mean you're rude?
Yeah, but now it's a disease I can take medication for.
they have pills for rudeness?
I know. And they can't figure out the Middle East. Go figure.
Hey, you're Irish. Maybe it's an Irish curse or something.
well, Gerry and I did love the Yankees...
...which was pretty much against our religion.
well, there you go.
Really?
Yeah, she slept with my best friend. She left me.
Oh...
my best friend was a woman.
Oh.
her last words to me were, "I'd still be with you if you weren't a man.
and I'm like:
well, castrating me is definitely the first step toward achieving that particular goal.
it's still my fault. I introduced them.
I always had this fantasy about making love to two women at the same time.
except in my fantasy, I was still in the bed for the second and third time.
sorry. - Then this'll make you feel great.
...and she was my business partner, and we started the business with my money.
how'd you get over that?
I went through, like, a major hooker phase all year.
but that didn't help.
no, it helped a lot. I just started to run out of money.
it's actually a lot cheaper to date.
do you think that you're gonna ever find another woman to love?
no.
no, I think I repel the women that I want the most.
that's not true.
no?
no?
thank you, Daniel.
you can start closing up downstairs.
right.
what do you want?
Oh, good. A friendly voice. Oh.
what happened last night?
lemon drops and tequila, my friend.
the moment where a 30-year-old body does not recover quite as fast...
...as a 29-year-old body.
stop screaming at me.
are you working? - Hell, no.
but I told him we're gonna start next week. We'll go out starting Monday.
is that okay? - No, I was planning on...
...staying in bed and dying today.
well, you can't.
you gotta go check the mailbox, remember?
call me immediately.
save yourself bruises and buy yourself a bedside lamp.
and remember, a disco diva must look her best.
go buy yourself a knock-out outfit. You'll need it for when my next letter comes.
need it for what?
and I know you hate your job, but I'll help.
look for a sign. You'll know what to do.
P. S. I love you.
I still know you're around.
you're still here, aren't you?
so who lived here before?
a family. They're having another baby. So do you have any children?
three. Girls. Teenagers.
that's nice.
Uh-huh.
Ted, Sharon says there's another offer on the table...
...and we have to move on this.
I think if you offer another hundred grand, they'll back down.
well, maybe we should talk about it.
we don't have time, Ted. We have to tell her today.
we didn't wanna go over...
I know, but we love this apartment, and it is what it is.
there's nothing else. This is what an apartment costs.
we're already beyond our cap. - We'll make it work...
think about another area. - I am not living in Brooklyn.
will you listen to him? What?
he's obviously worried about this.
look at him. He's pale. - Hol.
who are you to tell me how to talk to my husband?
you shouldn't push this on him if he doesn't want to.
I'll push what I want on him. He's my husband.
I want this apartment.
say no, Ted. - It is amazing that you are still talking.
don't listen to her. - Ted, she's being a tyrant.
she's got your balls on one of those things that cling back and forth.
you know? - Yeah.
you bitch. - Brat.
shut up! - You shut up!
no, you shut up! I will end you, and when I do...
you know what? I'll tell you... - No. No. No. Okay, tell me.
he's my husband, I'll talk to him the way I want to. I'm not living in Brooklyn!
do you know who I am? What's wrong with Brooklyn, lady?
are you Holly Kennedy?
if I am, will you sing? - Yes.
no, I'm not. - Please don't make this an issue.
I gotta sing and deliver a letter. - A letter? What's the song?
yah Mo Be There. - Just give me the letter.
I could get reported. - By the leprechaun union?
you know, I was in an off-Broadway play with Al goddamn Pacino.
I don't need this shit. You want the balloons?
no. - Fine.
you bastard.
there's no way I'm doing this.
Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are. - Oh, no, I'm not.
remember the last time?
all you wanna do is ride around, Sally
ride, Sally, ride
all you wanna do is ride around, Sally
ride, Sally, ride
one of these early mornings
you gonna be
wiping those weeping eyes
those weeping eyes, yeah
thank you very much.
Oh, my God.
Whoo! - One more!
okay. I guess it's time to give somebody else a chance here now.
who wants a shot?
anybody else here willing to give it a go?
yourself? No? Young lady.
come on. Don't be shy.
what about Holly? - Stop it.
Holly. I don't know about that, John.
Holly's my wife, by the way. My beautiful wife.
and I do... I love Holly, I do.
but she would never have the guts...
Oh!
...to do something like this.
Oh, no.
in fact, she ate me head off about coming out tonight.
you know, she had a long day at the office.
Ah. She'll never do it.
Yep.
Oh, you think so?
you think she'd get up here? Okay, I'll bet you 100 dollars...
...she doesn't get up on this stage. Oooh.
make it two.
what is she doing? What is she doing? - Ha-ha-ha.
that's my wife, the surpriser.
how can I put this in a way
so as not to offend or unnerve
there's a rumor going all around That you ain't been getting served
all right.
they say that you ain't you know what In, baby, who knows how long
it's hard for me to say what's right When all I wanna do is wrong
get off Twenty-three positions in a one-night stand
get off I'll only call you after if you say I can
get off, let a woman be a woman And a man be a man
get off If you want to, baby
here I am Here l...
Oh! - Oh, God!
do you mind coffee?
how do you feel? You look good.
I'm sorry, baby, but I have to say you were really good before...
my nose is broken, Gerry. My ankle is twisted. Happy?
are you mad at me? - I didn't wanna go out...
...and you made me.
I hate karaoke and you forced me to go up there.
come on, honey. It was nobody's fault.
Oh, come here, baby. Give me a...
give me a kiss.
well, how long are you gonna be mad for?
I never let him off the hook.
anytime I was mad, I made him feel bad.
I was mad when we left the house that night.
I was mad at him because our apartment was too small. So stupid.
baby, you were married.
married people make each other feel like shit on purpose sometimes.
it just feels good.
Gerry knew you were crazy about him. He told me all the time.
well, I wish I would've told him that night.
so tell him now.
it's slightly dirty. Just slightly.
Ooh.
he's delicious, isn't he?
you could serve coffee on that ass.
do you have to be so vulgar about men, like they're pieces of meat?
I'm sorry, John. I forgot you're sensitive about your flat ass.
Hoh.
you know, Denise, that's why you're not married.
Ahem. - Women act like men...
...then they complain men don't want them.
Oh, is that why? Oh.
okay. Because I thought it was something different.
I thought it was because I thought that I deserve the best.
and he's out there. He's just with all the wrong women.
and let me be clear.
after centuries of men looking at my tits instead of my eyes...
...and pinching my ass instead of shaking my hand...
...I now have the divine right to stare at a man's backside...
...with vulgar, cheap appreciation if I want to.
well said. - I thought so.
new York City, how we doing? Huh?
Hey, guys, we're here! Yay!
give a warm welcome to our next singer.
rumor has it this is her return engagement. Put your hands together...
this is for you, Gerry, you son of a bitch.
I just wanna tell you
nothing you don't want to hear
all I want is for you to say
Oh, why don't you just take me Where I've never been before?
I know you want to hear me Catch my breath
I love you till the end
I love you till the end
I love you till the end
okay, let me get this straight.
you're straight, you're single, and you own your own business?
it's my own club.
I'm doing a big renovation right now.
it'll open in the spring. - Mm-hm.
I could show it to you if you want. It's over on Tenth Avenue. Wanna go?
great.
Yeah. Let me just do one thing first.
Mm.
what's my name?
Tom. - Where have you been?
with all the wrong women.
hmm.
Hey. - Hi.
Hey, Gerry. You lost weight.
thanks for inviting me.
you're a terrible singer.
Yes, I am.
I'd be really embarrassed if I were you. - Did you take your medication today?
no, I thought I'd come here instead.
say, I'm feeling kind of hungry. You feel like getting a bite or something to drink?
no, I'm... I don't think so.
it's all right. - Thanks.
I don't mean to throw this at you, but what do women want?
I can't figure it out. They want us to ask.
they don't want us to ask. They want us to make a move, not make a move.
they want us to be on bottom, be on top.
use hair products, don't use hair products.
what do you people want?
I'll tell you, but you have to promise not to say I told you.
l... I swear. - Because it's a sacred secret.
sacred secret.
you ready? You sure? - Yeah. I think so.
come here.
we have absolutely...
...no idea what we want.
I knew it! I knew that! Son of a bitch! - Ooh!
Yeah.
look, if you ever just wanna get out...
...just do anything, just...
I'll wait for your call.
and just so you know, I'm not looking for a thing right now.
I'm just flirting in good faith. - I appreciate that.
maybe we can defy God...
...and go see a Yankees game. - Yeah.
we'll be really weird friends, joined by self-pity, bitterness and vomit.
I'd like that. - Me too.
my leather jacket is for you. I always loved the way that looked on you.
but the rest of my stuff, you don't need it.
make some space in that bloody apartment for yourself. Go on.
it's time, baby.
P. S. I love you.
I think you're a little bit perverted.
I mean, you bring me to an Irish famine memorial...
...and we're eating corned beef sandwiches. That's pretty sick.
Gerry thought it was the best way to honor the dead.
you know, show them how well we're doing.
I'm sorry I always bring him up.
Yeah, I'm starting to get a little bit sick of it.
now that's a real honest-to-goodness couple right there.
they've probably been together since the Flood.
we're so arrogant, aren't we?
we're so afraid of age, we do everything we can to prevent it.
we don't realize what a privilege it is to grow old with someone...
...someone who doesn't drive you to commit murder.
or doesn't humiliate you beyond repair.
it's sweet.
it's good, huh?
can I ask you a favor? Sure.
I started bagging up Gerry's stuff. Couldn't finish.
I think I need someone who didn't know him to get rid of it all.
be happy to help you get rid of Gerry.
do you have to say it like that? - Like what?
what is wrong with you? Take a pill. - Nothing. What?
what's wrong?
nothing, I...
I've just never been alone with another man in this apartment besides Gerry.
want me to stand out in the hall? You can just throw me the boxes.
no. Heh.
that's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna change.
look through stuff. If there's anything you want...
...just let me know. - Okay.
Mm.
I can't remember the last time somebody held me like this.
did you find a new husband yet?
shut up.
where have you been?
I haven't felt you around lately. - Oh, please.
I've been so around.
Mm.
I can feel you hugging me.
that's because I am.
you look great.
this is the one.
are you Barbara? - Yes, may I help you?
I hope so.
you're his wife.
he was here?
so I don't understand. You're taking a vacation?
it's a trip.
Gerry planned the whole thing for me and Sharon and Denise.
you think it's the best time to vacation?
Gerry made all the arrangements. I have to go.
have you spoken to Daniel? Thought you two were spending time together.
we're just friends, Mom.
I've stood by and not said anything about all this, but now I think it's time it stopped.
what do you mean? - It's not healthy.
Gerry's not gonna be able to keep this up forever, is he?
his life ended, and so will his letters.
you're gonna have to face things on your own.
it was a gift from Gerry.
and how can you say that?
my husband was 35 years old. He wasn't supposed to die.
but he did. It was awful.
it's what happens.
but his death is a part of your life now. And you have to deal with it.
stop saying that like I'm not dealing with it. I am.
how? By waiting for a letter from a dead husband?
taking a vacation? When your father left, I had two children to support.
excuse me for not having any children. - That's not how I meant it and you know it.
your father leaving was just as devastating.
but I did what I needed to do and got on with it.
it's not the same thing. - Why not?
my husband died. He was taken. He didn't wanna go, he didn't wanna leave.
Yes, my husband wanted to leave.
and it's so much easier being abandoned by choice, is it?
I've had my say.
I won't say anymore.
so where's he sending you?
Oh, my God.
get the bags.
Oh.
all right. - She just elbowed me.
know what? If that's an indication of how this trip's gonna be, I won't have it.
is that her bag? Is that her bag?
leave it. Don't take it in. - This is ridiculous.
this is heavy. - I know.
look.
Hey, Big Mama. Make sure my baby has a good time.
make sure you and John do everything you wanna do...
...whenever you wanna do it.
and make sure my baby does things.
I want you to take her fishing. - Oh, God.
he's been wanting to get me on a lake since forever.
and be sure to give yourself a big, sweaty pony-boy kiss from me.
Ugh. Jerk. He will never let me forget my bachelorette party.
Joey the Pony Boy.
Tony. - Tony.
Tony, I remember him. I bet I have a letter too.
where would he hide one for me?
bedroom.
Denise, take Holly to Whelan's, my favorite pub.
there's beautiful music to be heard, beautiful people to be around.
and Denise, you're going to heaven for being my baby's friend.
I'm making all the arrangements up here for you.
got a few hot men lined up. I hear Ben Franklin's hung like a racehorse.
love you.
I don't know how you do this. - Let me see it.
what?
he didn't leave me a letter.
well, probably didn't love you...
...as much as us. - Mm-mm.
Oh my God, look at that. Look at that!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Oh. Please let me buy him as a souvenir.
he's coming this way. - He's coming.
how long has it been?
how long has what been?
how long has it been?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
you're gonna go talk to him. Oh, yeah. - Mm. No.
you just heard him. Say how much you like it, flatter him. Go.
we don't have those in the States.
go, go. We don't make those.
you're ready. - Go! Do it for us. Go on.
Where'd she go? - What are you doing? Go ahead!
I'm an old married widow.
Oh, you've got much better stuff than those tarts. You're experienced.
you're American. You got foreign exotic stuff going...
there's nothing exotic about being an American.
he doesn't know that. - We'll help you.
just take it off. No, no, no!
listen! You're gonna do what we say.
I'm gonna hurt you. I'll pull your hair.
you look hot. Put your shoulders back. Puff your hair a little.
you're so sexy. Go. - Yeah, you look hot. Do it!
Hi.
I just wanted to say I really loved your music.
you're beautiful. I mean... I mean... Sorry.
your music is beautiful.
thanks... Um...
you're American? - Yeah.
and what brings you to Ireland?
holiday. Oh, well, with my girlfriends.
Hi. - Hi.
good. Good to have you here.
Heh. Thanks. - I have one more song to play.
will you stay and have a listen?
it's an American song about a local girl. I think you'll like it.
sure. - Good.
grand.
so I'll see you after, then?
okay, sure.
em...
this is an American song dedicated to Holly.
I hope you enjoy it.
well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
of a day l-ay-l-ay
there's no ether, either.
Jesus Christ.
you there! Is this the last one?
God, what a mess.
at least there's no gangrene.
there will be if it doesn't come off soon.
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.
I'm sorry.
let's coffee up. He can wait a few more minutes.
God!
glass.
is that Tucker's men? - Yes, sir. I think it is.
how long has it been like this?
we found 'em this morning, sir. They've been here for two days.
is that you, Lieutenant?
sons of bitches.
come on. You better take cover.
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters. Come on. Go under cover.
there you go.
you went to the hospital?
it was no good.
what's going on here?
what's going on here?
that seems to be the question, all right.
see, you could ask the major...
...but he don't know.
he's busy.
he's busy trying to figure out how come the officers' mess...
...run out of peach ice cream.
then, of course, you got the general.
he come up to see the show.
all he knows is there ain't no show...
...which ain't entirely correct 'cause we started a balloon up...
...but they shot her down before we got off the ground.
nobody's made a run either way. It's been a standoff all damned day.
now, the major, he's looking at the general.
he's thinking to himself, I better do something.
you know what that means.
I sure as hell don't want to be the first one across this field.
they're supposed to be beat up just like us.
hell, everybody knows Tucker's men are tough as cobs.
so far, the only thing been killed out here is three milking cows.
of course, that's about to change.
you son of a bitch.
you know, some of the boys are saying if we ain't gonna fight...
...we could just settle this whole business with a little...
...high-stakes poker.
wouldn't that be a sight?
a bunch of fellas sitting in the middle of this field...
...drawing cards.
what is it, sir?
looks like a suicide.
Tucker!
what's he doing?
what did you say to him? - I didn't say nothing.
come on back, you son of a bitch!
you won't make it no second time! - All right by me.
forgive me, Father.
he's coming back again! - Here he comes, boys!
ready! - I got him.
don't...
don't take off my foot.
you rest easy, son. You'll keep your foot.
with God as my judge, you'll keep it.
bring up my ambulance. - Sir?
bring up my ambulance, and bring my surgeon with it!
we got an officer who's worth something lying here.
the strangeness of this life cannot be measured.
in trying to produce my own death...
...I was elevated to the status of a living hero.
I was also awarded Cisco...
...the trusty mount that carried me across the field that day.
and on full recovery, was given transfer to any station I desired.
the bloody slaughter continues in the east as I arrive at Fort Hayes.
a tiny island of men and material surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie.
lieutenant.
where can I find Maj. Fambrough?
down at the end of the hall.
thank you.
lt. John J. Dunbar.
lt. John J. Dunbar?
Yes, sir. - "Yes, sir."
indian fighter.
excuse me?
it says here that you're to be posted on the frontier.
the frontier is Indian country.
I quickly deduced that you're an Indian fighter.
I did not ascend to this position by being stupid.
no, sir. - "No, sir."
it says here that you've been decorated.
Yes, sir.
and they sent you here to be posted?
actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.
Really? Why?
I've always wanted to see the frontier.
you want to see the frontier?
Yes, sir.
before it's gone.
such a smart lad, coming straight to me.
sir...
...Knight.
I am sending you on a knight's errand.
you will report to Captain Cargill...
...at the furthermost outpost of the realm...
...Fort Sedgewick.
my personal seal will assure your safety...
...through many miles of wild and hostile country.
I was wondering... - Yes?
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?
you think I don't know?
no, sir. - You think that.
it's just that I don't know... - Hold your tongue.
I am in a generous mood and I will grant your boon.
see that peasant out there?
he calls himself Timmons.
he's going there this very afternoon. You can ride with him if you like.
he knows the way. Thank you. That is all.
sir Knight?
I've just pissed in my pants...
...and nobody can do anything about it.
to your journey!
to my journey!
haw!
over a little bit, Jim!
have this by tomorrow. - Yes, sir.
I'll have my crown now.
sir? - I'll have my crown now!
I'm sorry, sir. - Are you deaf, fool?
I said I'll have my crown right now!
now!
no.
I'll get your crown. - No.
sir?
major?
the king is dead.
long live the king.
get these kids out of here, come on!
haw, Jim and Jake!
gee a little bit, Jim!
the hell was that?
what is that?
what the hell is that?
why don't you put that in your book?
were it not for my companion...
...I believe I would be having the time of my life.
I know he means well...
...but he is quite possibly the foulest man I have ever met.
how far you make the Fort?
far.
how far?
forty, fifty mile, maybe.
what's the big hurry on Sedgewick?
it's to be my post.
my home.
you ain't hard to please, I'll give you that much.
look yonder.
what you got there?
somebody back east is saying, "Why don't she write?
you stupid bastard.
get up, Timmons.
get up.
get up.
come on. Get up.
get up!
someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?
goddamn it!
I'm gonna have a welt.
cpl. Guest?
you don't have to talk to me, just please come out.
it's the end.
assemble the men in front of my quarters.
you hate me.
but I feel none of the same for you.
you men stayed.
you stayed after they took all our horses.
you stayed after all the others deserted.
you stayed after the army failed to resupply us.
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes...
...just as you have...
...day after miserable day.
and all I can say is that I'm proud of you.
now get your things, men. We're leaving this place.
the army can go to hell.
go.
get your things.
how come we haven't seen any buffalo?
you can't figure the stinking buffalo.
you can't. Sometimes you won't see any for days.
other times, they'll be thick, like curls on a whore.
what about Indians?
Indians? Goddamn Indians!
you just as soon not see 'em unless the bastards are dead.
they're nothing but thieves and beggars.
ho, up there!
not what you would call much of a going concern now, is it?
go down there.
Why? There ain't nothing down there. - Because I said.
go down there.
there, son of a bitch!
there ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.
there ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.
lieutenant!
everybody's run off or got killed.
all right. Let's unload the wagon.
what? What, and leave it all here?
I'm staying, too.
there ain't nothing here.
no, not at the moment.
we don't know what's happened.
things being as they are...
...we might as well just turn around and get headed back.
this is my post.
this is my post?
this is my post.
this is my post?
Jesus H. Christ.
what, are you crazy, boy?
fast son of a bitch.
Jesus H. Christ. - This is my post.
all right, put it down.
and these are the post provisions, all right? Now get your ass off the wagon...
put it down! - And help me unload.
we're just havin' a conversation, now put it down.
I'll let them know where you are.
good.
good luck.
thank you.
Jake and Jim!
good mule!
haw up there now!
good mules!
have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick deserted.
am now waiting for garrison's return or word from headquarters.
the post is in exceedingly poor condition...
...and I have decided to assign myself clean-up duty beginning tomorrow.
supplies are abundant...
...and the country is everything I dreamed it would be.
there can be no place like this on Earth.
bad horse.
bad horse.
the animals in the pond had not been poisoned.
they had all been shot.
but why? Was it for sport?
could it have been out of spite?
my first guess would have been that the men here were starving.
but this rotting waste speaks to the contrary.
the caves are an even bigger mystery.
what could have driven men to live in caves?
perhaps they were frightened.
maybe there had been some sort of revolt.
I can make no sense of the clues left me here.
perhaps my relief will provide the answers.
come on, Cisco. One more time.
git up!
come on! Git up, Cisco.
git up!
git up! There you go!
easy.
only a white man would make a fire for everyone to see.
maybe there's more than one.
there might be three or four.
I know three or four...
...who will not be making the trip back home.
we have nothing to show for this trail.
we have no rifles.
white men are sure to have rifles.
it's hard to say how many might be down there.
we should forget this and go home.
then go.
I would rather die...
...than argue about a single line of smoke in my own country.
he will not quit until we are all dead.
and if I...
look at me.
don't hurt my mules.
stop.
stop it.
please don't hurt my mules.
I am pleased with my efforts thus far.
for all my improvements, though, there remains an ugliness here I cannot dispel.
an injury that goes beyond neglect and like a bruise, it will be slow to heal.
it's been almost 30 days.
I have come to enjoy the patterns of my life at Fort Sedgewick.
especially my daily reconnaissance rides with Cisco.
each day, we go further into the prairie and every discovery...
...big or small, becomes etched in my mind forever.
it would seem I've been marooned, as no one has yet come for me.
I can only assume that there is a problem, which the army will solve shortly.
maybe I am being foolish in my optimism...
...but when I look to the eastern horizon...
...I never fail to hope that a column might be out there.
still no sign of Capt. Cargill's command.
though well-supplied, I've decided to ration my goods...
...as if I were part of a post instead of the whole affair.
there's a wolf who seems intent on the goings-on here.
he does not seem inclined to be a nuisance, however.
and aside from Cisco, has been my only company.
he's appeared each afternoon for the past two days.
he has two milky white paws.
if he comes calling tomorrow...
...I will name him Two-Socks.
almost a month and no one has come.
the longer this condition persists...
...the less inclined I am to believe that anyone will.
rain has forced me indoors for most of two days now...
...and I have begun work on an awning.
it is the loneliest of times for me now...
...but I can say honestly that I am not unhappy.
how can I marry a pretty little girl "When I got no coat to put on?
soldier, soldier "Won't you marry me "Before the fight comes home?
how can I marry a pretty little girl when I got no shoes to put on?
how can I marry a pretty little girl when I got no hat to put on?
soldier, soldier, won't you marry me "Before the fight comes home?
how can I marry an ugly little girl "When I got a pretty wife back home?
you there!
have made first contact with a wild Indian.
one came to the fort and tried to steal my horse.
when I appeared, he became frightened and ran off.
have decided to bury excess ordnance lest it fall into enemy hands.
keeping only the barest necessities for myself.
my afternoon rides have been pared down to short circular patrols...
...always keeping the post in sight.
am taking steps to prepare for another visitation.
do not know how many more might be in the vicinity...
...but I am assuming that where there is one there's sure to be another.
most of my work has been geared toward creating the illusion...
...of strength and stability.
I'm still alone, however, and unless troops arrive soon...
...all may be lost.
kicking Bird has been keeping to himself these last few days.
I do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone.
what does his wife say?
she says that he is keeping to himself.
that's not what I asked you.
well, what did you ask me?
what did she say?
she said that he is keeping to himself these days.
that's what she says.
make sure that my meat is soft.
my teeth hurt.
may I come in?
no, let him sit with me.
our country seems good this summer...
...but I have not been out to see it.
but the buffalo are late.
and I always worry about the bellies of our children.
I was thinking of a dance.
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.
it would be good to have a strong sign.
there's a funny thing about signs.
we know when they are bad or good.
sometimes they are strange and it's hard to understand them.
a smart man will think on these things.
if he is still confused, he will tell somebody.
for instance, he might tell you or me.
a smart man always does this.
I have seen such a sign.
Really?
I saw a man.
a naked, white man.
are you sure it was a man?
I saw his sex.
did you speak to him?
no.
it's been two days now, and nothing.
my presence here must have been reported by now.
have made all the preparations I can think of.
cannot mount an adequate defense as I am still alone.
but will try to make a big impression when they come.
waiting.
Post-script...
the man I encountered was a magnificent-looking fellow.
he might be a god.
or a white chief with special abilities.
that is why we should talk with him.
I do not care for this talk about this white man.
whatever he is, he is not a Sioux, and that makes him less.
when I hear that more whites are coming, I want to laugh.
we took a hundred horses from these people.
there was no honor in it.
they don't ride well. They don't shoot well.
they're dirty.
those soldiers could not even make it through one winter here.
and these people are said to flourish?
I think they will all be dead soon.
I think this fool is probably lost.
wind In His Hair's words are strong and I have heard them.
it's true the whites are a poor race and hard to understand.
but make no mistake. The whites are coming.
even our enemies agree on this.
so when I see one man alone without fear in our country...
...I do not think he is lost. I think he may have medicine.
I see someone who might speak...
...for all the white people who are coming.
I think this is a person with which treaties might be struck.
kicking Bird is always looking ahead and that is good.
but this man cannot cover our lodges or feed our children.
he is nothing to us.
I will take some men.
we will shoot some arrows into this white man.
if he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.
if he has no medicine, he will be dead.
no man can tell another what to do.
but killing a white man is a delicate matter.
if you kill one, more are sure to come.
it's easy to become confused by these questions.
it's hard to know what to do.
we should talk about this some more.
that is all I have to say.
what's the matter, now?
we don't think this is such a good idea.
if we take the horse of a white god...
...they will make up songs about us.
maybe.
they will ask us to go on raids.
who gets the horse?
I do.
I do, but we share. Now who can say this is not a great plan?
it's always the same.
every time.
Yes, sir, I have. No, I'll ask, sir.
we'll be heroes.
they'll write songs about us.
what happened?
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.
you shouldn't have fallen off. Now we'll get in trouble.
it was your idea.
my idea was only to take the horse, not fall down.
otter hurt himself.
what are you looking at? I'm the one who's hurt.
I will be when my father finds out. His bow will be across my back.
I am Wind In His Hair.
I am Wind In His Hair.
do you see that I am not afraid of you?
do you see?
the party that went against the Utes is coming back.
there are many hearts on the ground.
I realize now that I have been wrong.
all this time, I've been waiting.
waiting for what?
for someone to find me?
for Indians to take my horse?
to see a buffalo?
since I have arrived at this post I have been walking on eggs.
it has become a bad habit and I am sick of it.
tomorrow morning, I will ride out to the Indians.
I do not know the outcome or wisdom of this thinking...
...but I've become a target and a target makes a poor impression.
I am through waiting.
what are you looking at?
son of a bitch!
no. Wait.
wait.
wait.
you need help. You're hurt.
you need... - No!
let me... You need help.
you need help. You're hurt. Let me help you.
you're hurt.
don't.
she's hurt.
she's hurt.
you are not welcome here.
no. She's hurt.
go away from us.
you are not welcome. Go away from us.
stop.
the soldier did not come to fight.
he is going away and we will let him.
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.
we will go down and talk to the white man.
and find out why he is here.
if this council decides to talk to the white man...
...then it will be so.
but in my mind it's not right...
...that a chief as great as Ten Bears...
...goes to ask the business of a puny, trespassing white man...
...who has only a smart horse and a few white man's clothes.
I will not go.
you will go.
and you will go.
that is all I have to say.
welcome.
welcome.
Hi!
come.
please, sit down.
sit down.
wait just a... Just a minute.
his mind is gone.
tatanka. Buffalo.
Buffalo. - Tatanka.
Buffalo. Tatanka.
the fierce one, as I call him, seems a very tough fellow.
I hope I never have to fight him.
from the little I know, he seems to be honest and very direct.
I like the quiet one immensely.
he's been patient and inquisitive.
he seems eager to communicate.
I would conclude that he is a man of some weight among his people.
Buffalo.
I believe I made an even greater impression on their next visit.
I produced a coffee grinder, something none of them had seen before.
is the coffee not good?
it's too strong, maybe.
sugar.
put in.
taste it.
sugar.
you want some?
you want some?
that's a lot.
okay.
Yeah.
it's good to finally have some company.
so much goes unsaid and I have the feeling that these people...
...the quiet one in particular, want something from me.
made presents of coffee and most of the sugar.
it didn't figure to last anyway.
don't believe I go too far in saying...
...that a foundation for good relations is being laid.
stands With A Fist.
we will talk a while.
your wounds are healing well?
Yes, they are.
you are happy here, with my family?
I am glad to be here.
I am missing my husband.
perhaps you will marry again when the time is right?
perhaps.
we have word from many places that the whites are coming.
they are coming into everyone's country.
I think they will soon be in ours.
this white man who lives at the old soldier fort...
I have visited him and I believe his heart is a good one.
I am afraid of the white man at the fort.
I am afraid he will tell others that I am here.
I am afraid they will try to take me away.
I've heard they take people away.
every warrior in camp would fight them if they tried.
I cannot make the white man language.
he cannot speak Sioux.
it has been a long time since I made the talk.
I want you to try.
I don't know how.
Yes, you do.
I can't.
I can't. It's dead in me.
I don't ask this for myself. I ask this for all the people.
he knows things about the whites which we do not.
now, you must remember.
I can't.
will she make the white words?
she won't try. She is being difficult.
well, she's the one who's crying.
perhaps the difficulty is yours.
Christine!
get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!
Billy, you get away from those puppies!
Damn!
get the kids, and get them in the house.
go on!
Christine!
Christine! Where are you?
I'm up here, mother.
get down now. - Why?
just do it.
stay right where you are. Get back. Do you hear me?
Joe, get in the house right now!
Willie!
who is it, Willie? - They look like Pawnee.
my father and your father are talking to them.
what do they want? - I don't know.
go on. You heard him. Get out of here.
run, Christine!
I said run!
Joe!
Christine!
mommy!
come on, Two Socks. Bacon.
two Socks, like Cisco, has become a trusted friend.
he still won't eat from my hand...
...but his keen eyes and ears never fail to alert me when something is wrong.
tatanka.
no.
no, I haven't seen any buffalo.
sorry.
are you hungry?
are you hungry?
I have food. I have a lot of food.
nothing I've been told about these people is correct.
they are not beggars and thieves.
they are not the bogeymen they've been made out to be.
on the contrary, they are polite guests and have a familiar humor I enjoy.
real communication is slow, however...
...and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.
most of our progress has been built on the basis of failure...
...rather than success.
I've thought to inquire if the woman I found lived or not...
...but it seems far too complicated a subject, given our limitations.
one thing is clear, however. There are no buffalo.
and it weighs heavy on their minds.
yesterday's meeting was the best yet.
it seems I've been invited to the village and I'm looking forward to going.
we were waiting for you.
we were waiting for you.
now tell him we are glad that he is here.
hello.
you...
here...
good.
thank you. I feel good.
I feel good.
ask him why he is at the soldier fort.
the soldier fort.
wait.
what is your names?
our names? - What is his name?
he's right. Introductions should come first.
he...
he...
kick.
kick?
more.
more kick?
more kicking?
kicking.
bird? Bird, kicking bird.
kicking Bird.
what is he...
is he chief?
no.
a holy man.
holy man.
your name?
I don't... - How are you called?
get up?
stand up?
stands?
stands. Your name's "Stands"?
stands.
with. - With?
with. - Stands with?
fist?
Yes.
stands With A Fist?
stands With A Fist.
I'm John Dunbar.
John Dunbar.
dumb Bear.
no, not Dumb Bear.
Dunbar.
dun...
bar.
not Dumb Bear.
Dunbar.
there's been an exciting breakthrough with the Indians.
the woman I found on the prairie speaks English...
...and today, clear progress was made.
she is white, and though I cannot be sure how she came to be with these people...
...I can tell she is not a captive.
while I'm not afraid...
...I don't feel completely welcome by everyone in the village.
my being here must be Kicking Bird's idea.
he is very enthusiastic and like two children...
...we are both anxious to know more about each other.
but I find myself holding back.
for some reason, I am reluctant to answer all his questions.
maybe it's my sense of duty...
...but something tells me not to say too much.
it was good to see Fort Sedgewick again...
...and yet I look forward to another visit with my new neighbors.
this is still my home, however...
...and I remain watchful for my relief and can only hope...
...that my negotiations with the wild people of the plains will bear fruit.
buffalo!
buffalo! I've seen buffalo!
buffaloes!
tatanka.
Tatanka?
Yeah.
riders were sent out to pick up the trail.
in the time it took to gather my things at Sedgewick...
...the entire tribe was well on its way.
their efficiency and speed with which they moved...
...was enough to impress any military commander.
spirits are high, and overnight I've gone from a person of suspicion...
...to one of genuine standing.
I am greeted with open smiles and looks of appreciation.
in short, I have become a celebrity.
loo ten tant!
loo ten tant! - Loo ten tant!
scouts picked up the trail exactly where I said it would be.
it was not hard to find...
...a gigantic swath of torn-up ground extending to the horizon.
the numbers it took to create this impossible image...
...was hard to imagine.
loo ten tant!
loo ten tant!
who would do such a thing?
the field was proof enough...
...that it was a people without value and without soul.
with no regard for Sioux rights.
the wagon tracks leading away left little doubt...
...and my heart sank, as I knew it could only be white hunters.
voices that had been joyous all morning...
...were now as silent as the dead buffalo left to rot in this valley...
...killed only for their tongues and the price of their hides.
loo ten tant.
it was suddenly clear now what had happened...
...and my heart sank as I tried to convince myself...
...that the white men who'd been killed were bad people and deserved to die.
but it was no use.
I tried to believe that Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird...
...and the others who shared in the killing were not so happy for having done it.
but they were.
as I looked at familiar faces, I realized that the gap between us...
...was greater than I could ever have imagined.
as they celebrated into the night the coming hunt...
...it was hard to know where to be.
I don't know if they understood, but I could not sleep among them.
there had been no looks, and there was no blame.
there was only the confusion of a people not able to predict a future.
are you all right?
I can't.
no, I'm full.
I'm full, and I can't tell the story anymore.
no.
you want to try it?
you want to try it?
here.
I can't. This is too much.
good trade.
this is a good trade.
no, no, I can't. I'm full, I'm tired.
No!
loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!
tatanka. Big tatanka.
big tatanka.
that's my hat!
you're wearing my hat.
it's my hat.
I found it on the prairie. It's mine.
no, you...
my hat.
that hat belongs to the Lieutenant.
he left it on the prairie. He didn't want it.
well, you can see he wants it now.
we all know that it's a soldier's hat.
we all know who wears it.
if you want to keep it, that's all right.
but give something for it.
good trade.
there you are.
come here, Cisco.
it seems every day ends with a miracle here.
and whatever God may be, I thank God for this day.
to stay any longer would have been useless.
we had all the meat we could possibly carry.
we had hunted for three days, losing a half a dozen ponies...
...and only three men injured.
I'd never known a people so eager to laugh...
...so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other.
and the only word that came to mind was 'harmony.'
many times I've felt alone...
...but until this afternoon...
...I'd never felt completely lonely.
made a long patrol today.
there's nothing to report.
time seems irrelevant except for the fact that I am bored...
...and these hours alone are endless.
it is difficult for me to muster any enthusiasm...
...for my regular duties here.
and the fort is showing serious signs of neglect.
the truth is, I am missing the company of my friends.
I can see all of their faces, but somehow it is not enough.
tomorrow I will pay them a visit.
it may be forward of me, but what can it hurt?
after all, they are my neighbors.
the night sounds have become so familiar as to be comforting.
my life on the prairie's a good one and for the most part, I am content.
the Indians have a great pull for me that goes beyond curiosity.
there's something wise about them and I'm drawn to them...
...in ways much stronger than my obligations to the military.
go home!
damn him.
God! Go home!
go!
go home, Two Socks!
bad wolf!
you were right. He is a special white man.
he should have a real name.
it is autumn now and I am spending more time than ever with my friends.
they have given me my own lodge and I feel comfortable there.
we talk every day, but I know Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.
he always wants to know how many more white people are coming.
I tell him they will most likely pass through this country and nothing more.
but I am speaking in half-truths.
one day there will be too many, but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.
I am sure that Stands With A Fist knows that I am holding back...
...but to her credit, she says nothing.
a war party is going against the Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.
I sense I made a mistake in doing so...
...but I could not bring myself to take it back.
they are my friends, and from what little I gather...
...the Pawnee have been very hard on these people.
I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.
come in, please.
sit down?
kicking Bird want to know...
...why you want to make war on the Pawnee.
they have done nothing to you.
they are Sioux enemies.
only Sioux warriors to go.
tell him that I have been a warrior...
...Ionger than many of the young men who will go on this war party.
tell him.
he said that the Sioux way of being a warrior...
...is not the white way.
you are not ready. - I know, I understand.
tell him I cannot learn these ways in camp.
he also asks that you...
...watch over his family while he is gone.
this thing he asks is a great honor for you.
tell him that I would be happy to watch over his family.
he thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.
who is Dances With Wolves?
it is the name which all the people...
...are calling you now.
dances With...
that's right.
that day.
dances With Wolves.
how do you say it?
keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.
I like to make the talk.
I'm here.
we walk.
I cut this off.
I shaved it off. More.
grass grows on the prairie.
"grass grows on the prairie"?
wrong. - Wrong?
you said, "Fire lives on the prairie."
I did?
no laughing, though.
that man is a fighter.
again.
that man is a fighter. - Okay, I have it.
Yes.
hoo hoo, right?
no?
try this.
what's the word...
...for beautiful?
what are you doing?
it's hot, and we are sitting in the shade.
I'm hungry.
how is Dances With Wolves?
what do you mean?
how is he learning?
he is a fast learner.
what did you think I meant?
you go for water, today?
then let us take you.
how did you get your name?
I was not very old...
...when I came to be with the people.
and I was made to work.
I worked every day, very hard.
there was a woman...
...who didn't like me much.
she used to call me bad names, and sometimes she...
beat me?
and one day, she was...
...calling me these bad names...
...with her face in my face...
...and I hit her.
I was not very big, but she fell down.
she fell hard and didn't move.
and then I stood over her with my fist...
...and I asked if...
...there was any other woman...
...who wanted to call me bad names.
no one bothered me after that day.
no, I wouldn't think so.
show me.
show me where you hit her.
why are you not married?
I'm sorry. - I have to go.
I'm sorry.
can I help you?
you are not talking today?
no, I am not.
some of your words are wrong but you are learning fast.
so what can I tell you today?
I want to know about Stands With A Fist.
why is there no man with her?
she is in mourning.
I don't...
I do not understand "mourning.
she cries for someone.
cries for who?
it is not polite to speak of the dead.
but you are new, so I will tell you.
she cries for her husband.
he was killed not long ago.
that is how you came to find her on the prairie.
how long will she cry?
it is Kicking Bird's place to say when she is finished.
he's the one that found her when she was very little.
people are talking about you.
what are they saying?
they are proud of the medicine...
...you are making with Dances With Wolves.
I have hurt him, and I should go talk to him.
you can't. He is gone.
he left this morning.
bet you were thinking:
now, why don't he write?
Hello, Two Socks.
come on.
I won't hurt you. Come on. You can do this.
you can do this.
come on.
this is easy.
this is easy, Two Socks.
I am in mourning.
no, we cannot.
Yes. - We must be careful.
we must be careful.
okay.
wait!
what?
trouble.
the Pawnee are coming. A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.
hunters found them not far to the north. Soon be here.
stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.
the Pawnee do not come for horses. They come for blood.
get your weapons and come to my lodge.
I will get them.
stone Calf, wait.
I have guns.
I have many rifles.
at the fort? - Yes.
no. The ride is long and we can spare no men.
guns would make one warrior like two.
take one man and go quickly.
I will take Smiles A Lot.
shoot the gun!
it was hard to know how to feel.
I'd never been in a battle like this one.
there was no dark political objective.
this was not a fight for territory or riches or to make men free.
it was fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through the winter.
to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet away.
stone Calf was a great loss, but even the old men could not remember...
...such a one-sided victory.
and I gradually began to look at it in a new way.
I felt a pride I'd never felt before.
I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.
perhaps the name itself had no meaning.
but as I heard my Sioux name being called over and over...
...I knew for the first time who I really was.
when we were younger, he always bragged about how brave he was.
and what a great chief he would make.
he thought I was impressed.
while walking on the prairie, we surprised a small herd of buffalo.
and the first thing this brave warrior did is run for a tree.
he would have forgotten all about me...
...if he hadn't needed my help to climb it.
and we sat there all day as this old cow circled below.
making loud noises and hitting her head against the trunk.
where are you going? There is gambling tonight.
Horseback's games are always good.
I'm tired. Horseback already has a good rifle of mine.
good night.
how long will Stands With A Fist mourn?
I don't know.
I hope it will not be too long.
has something happened?
what?
she has found love again.
with who?
who do you think?
tell me.
dances With Wolves.
are you certain of this?
when you see them together, you will know.
what are people saying?
they like the match.
no one is angry?
it makes sense. They are both white.
I suppose I will be the one to say something.
she's your daughter now.
I know.
relax. You can't see everything coming.
stop it. Quit your playing.
stands With A Fist.
you will mourn no more.
sit, sit.
there's talk that you want to get married.
to who?
to Stands With A Fist.
that's the one, isn't it?
she's in mourning.
not today.
kicking Bird has released her.
he did?
what are you doing here?
kicking Bird told me to wait.
you might have to wait a long time.
smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking Bird riding on the prairie.
he says he was talking to himself.
a medicine man takes it pretty hard...
...when he is the last to know something.
what do I do?
you are pretty poor and a Sioux girl is not for free.
I don't know if you can get married.
I have the buckskin...
no, that's too much medicine.
do you think my horse is too much medicine?
for a girl.
wait here. Maybe we can help you.
wait.
that's all I do is wait!
the whole village was eager to take up a collection on my behalf.
the generosity of the people was astonishing.
the more valued the gift, the more easily it was given.
even the poorer families wanted to give up animals they could not afford.
it was hard to turn them away.
black Shawl was a mystery.
I couldn't guess what she was thinking and she offered no advice...
...no words of encouragement.
I may have been the brunt of an inside joke...
...that included the entire village...
...but I was determined.
wind In His Hair told me if all the gifts were gone in the morning...
...my offer had been accepted.
I spent a sleepless night wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.
I had no idea what Kicking Bird's decision would be.
turn around.
you look good.
you know, the man she mourned for...
he was my best friend.
I didn't know that.
he was a good man.
it has been hard for me to like you.
I am not the thinker Kicking Bird is.
I always feel anger first.
there were no answers to my questions.
but now I think he went away because you were coming.
that is how I see it.
this is a good day for me.
and for me.
if you want this man, take his hand in yours.
I had never been married before.
I don't know if all grooms have the same experience...
...but as Kicking Bird began to speak about what was expected of a Sioux husband...
...my mind began to swim in a way that shut out everything but her...
...the tiny details of her costume...
...the contours of her shape...
...the light in her eyes...
...the smallness of her feet.
I knew that the love between us would be served.
have you heard all that I have said?
Yes.
good, then take her inside.
she is your wife.
good.
thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
dances With Wolves' door is closed a lot these days.
I think they're having trouble making a baby.
I don't think they're having trouble at all.
if we pull the smoke flap shut, they will come out for sure.
dances With Wolves, are you in there?
today I am riding away to a far away place.
I would like you to ride with me.
it's good to be out.
Yes, it must be.
we are trying for a baby.
no waiting?
no waiting.
I was just thinking that of all the trails in this life...
...there is one that matters most.
it is the trail of a true human being.
I think you are on this trail, and it is good to see.
we call you the Busy Bee.
it is said that all the animals were born here.
that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people.
even our enemies agree that this is a sacred place.
it's quiet here.
we must wait for these people.
no, they've been gone a week. Maybe more.
we will water the horses and go home.
you always ask about the white people.
you always want to know how many more are coming.
there will be a lot, my friend.
more than can be counted.
how many?
like the stars.
it makes me afraid for all the Sioux.
we should tell this to Ten Bears.
the men who wore this came...
...in the time of my grandfather's grandfather.
eventually we drove them out.
then the Mexicans came. They do not come here anymore.
in my own time, the Texans.
they have been like all the others.
they take without asking.
I don't know if we are ready for these people.
but I think you are right. I think they will keep coming.
when I think of that, I look at this helmet.
our country is all that we have, and we will fight to keep it.
tomorrow we will strike the village...
...and go to the winter camp.
you have everything from the soldier fort?
Yes.
there's nothing for me there.
that's good.
the journal.
stands With... Wait!
words are important!
the words in the book are like a trail for people to follow.
now, it tells everything about my life here. I must get it.
enough.
we cannot wait for you.
I'll catch up.
Injun!
get him! Injun!
No!
stay down. Stay.
my God.
God.
it's okay.
something has happened.
dances With Wolves is not coming.
he must have trouble.
pick two good men and send them back to the soldier fort.
Spivey.
Spivey! - Yeah, Sergeant.
tell the major he's waking up.
move your worthless ass.
you got yourself a hell of a shiner...
...didn't you?
major's coming through.
does he speak English?
I don't know, sir.
speak English?
talk English? Talk!
I speak English.
who are you?
lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.
why are you dressed like this?
I came out from Fort Hayes last April, but there was nobody here.
do you have proof of that?
my journal's on the bunk in my quarters. My orders are in the journal.
it will tell you everything.
Spivey, you and Edwards were the first ones here.
did you find anything? A journal?
no, we didn't find nothing, sir.
Where's Edwards?
he's outside.
he didn't find nothing either.
somebody find me Edwards.
you turned Injun, didn't you?
didn't you?
what did you say your name was?
Dunbar.
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.
you say you're an officer?
God. Did you read my orders? - No.
they're in my journal.
there are no orders.
there's no journal.
why are you out of uniform?
I have to relieve myself.
sergeant, take care of him. - Yes, sir.
let's go.
he's a white man. - Doesn't look white to me.
they say he's a soldier. - He's an officer.
do you salute him or shoot him?
here, you. Eyes front.
I said eyes front!
don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!
get him!
why are you out of uniform?
what's the army doing out here?
lieutenant's asking the questions. - Bauer.
we're charged with apprehending...
we're charged with apprehending hostiles and recovering stolen property...
...retrieving white captives taken in hostile raidings.
there are no hostiles. - We will ascertain that for ourselves.
if you'll guide us to these camps and serve as an interpreter...
...your conduct will be re-evaluated.
what conduct? - With all due respect...
your status as a traitor might improve should you choose...
...to cooperate with the United States Army.
there's nothing for you to do out here.
are you willing to cooperate or not?
speak up!
I am Dances With Wolves.
what's that?
I have nothing to say to you.
you are not worth talking to.
sergeant, form a detail and take this man down to the river.
let him clean up his face. - Yes, sir.
not you, Spivey.
lieutenant.
major wants to see you.
Spivey.
Spivey. You got paper?
what's it to you? - Give me some, shit-bird.
can you read?
no, I can't read. What the hell's the difference?
you can't read either. Now just give me some.
quick, give me some! - All right. Hold your horses.
Bauer!
let go of me!
lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.
you son of a bitch!
it's all right.
it's all right.
he's going to get hungrier, that's all. But maybe that don't matter.
word is they're going to ship you back to Hayes.
and once you get there, they gonna hang you.
come on. Forget about him. Go on. Get out of here.
get up in there!
Spivey, what is that?
looks like he's following us.
hell, I'm going to shoot him.
dang. You missed him.
don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot. - Wait. I seen him first.
get down! - Look at that stupid bastard.
he ain't even moving.
wait a minute! That's my shot. - Shoot him!
shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.
shoot him!
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!
Bauer, get him off him!
he might have killed you.
I'll get that son of a bitch.
sit down, goddamn it!
that's it. I got him!
dead shot, boys. Come on.
son of a bitch!
get up!
get up!
I mean it! Get up!
get up! Come on, get up!
what?
you bash that prisoner one more time, I'll put those shackles on you.
you men get back here!
goddamn it!
boo.
clear behind that stand of trees?
all right. Let's go.
I don't see nobody.
Indians!
no.
dances With Wolves is quiet these days.
is his heart bad?
killing the soldiers at the river...
...was a good thing.
I did not mind killing those men. I was glad to do it.
but the soldiers hate me now, like they hate no other.
they think I am a traitor.
and they will hunt for me.
and when they find me, they find you.
I think it would be wise to move the village now.
I will be leaving.
I must go and talk with those who would listen.
quiet. You are hurting my ears.
leave us alone.
you are the only white man I have ever known.
I have thought about you a lot. More than you know.
but I think you are wrong.
the man the soldiers are looking for no longer exists.
now there is only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves.
let's smoke awhile.
with Ten Bears, it was always more than a while.
there was purpose in everything he did and I knew he wanted me to stay.
but I was sure of myself.
I would be an excuse and that's all the army would need to find this place.
I pushed him as far as I could to move the camp...
...but in the end he only smiled and talked of simple pleasures.
he reminded me that at his age a good fire is better than anything.
ten Bears was an extraordinary man.
you have nothing to say?
what can I tell you?
what's ever on your mind.
you've made the decision.
my place is with you.
I go where you go.
you're not afraid?
no.
I told Ten Bears we'd leave when the snow breaks.
did you tell everyone?
not everyone.
it's all right.
you...
...finish your pipe?
good pipe.
how...
...does it smoke?
I've never smoked it.
we come far...
...you and me.
I will not forget you.
dances With Wolves.
I am Wind In His Hair.
do you see that I am your friend?
can you see that you will always be my friend?
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
sergeant! Over here! Now!
thirteen years later, their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone, the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone and the American frontier was soon to pass into history.

Where's you boyfriend.

look at him, it seems the world has wronged him.
he hates accompanying girls shopping.
he only loves car racing.
he's so mannish?
if you woo a man, you must let him.
it's bad you say so.
what do you think, wooing or not wooing?
what about you? Is your Patrick easy to woo?
if tell you easy, will snatch him from me?
I'm not as flirty as you.
terrific.
Hi.
that man with glasses is staring at you.

I didn't mean to.
okay, let me go to disco with you tonight.

I'm sorry, Mum. I was just in the bathroom with the kids.
take the bags in my room.
Yes. Mum.
you do nothing but listen listen listen!
can't you go make money if you have time?
the movies shot recently don't suit me.
what do you want?
if you don't make movies, where do you get money for us?
we needn't little money for our living.
we can eat like king if you buy fewer clothes.
I buy clothes just to bring face to you.
okay, I'll stop buying clothes tomorrow.
I'll only wear bras out starting tomorrow.
your bras costs thousands of dollars too.
okay,
I'll go outside without bras on.
No...don't...
you're afraid now?
no, I fear you'll pollute the society.
shit! You bastard!
all right...
I'll write more songs, okay?
how much can you make by that? Let's do estate business.
you have so many buddies, ask them to sell you some good flats.
I don't know this.
Alan, ask Alan to sell you his flats.
doesn't he have several flats?
he has several families, of course he has several flats.
net, Net has many flats.
he has many horses, but he has no flats.
wife, I am hungry, is dinner ready?
okay, you're always hungry!
shit!
what's up?
the bank has frozen my card!
call them up and complain.
you won them almost $1 million?
is it so much?
you purchases $400, 000 at Royce, it's not much.
if this card is frozen, will other cards be too?
what will happen then?
then we'll have no card to use, what then?
how can I shop without a card?
wife, will you wake up?
do you feel uneasy if you don't shop at Royce one day?
you're more loyal than the sales girls there.
even if I print money, it needs time to dry.
are you complaining about me?
I'm not complaining.
then shut up, unless you don't want to dine.
Okay...I want to dine now.
we're dining, not barbecuing.
I can't cook, gas has been cut off.
let's dine out then.
I do suspect, we haven't paid the power bill for ages.
I wonder if it is too.
right, you haven't paid the electric bill.
shit!
daughter, quit as it's such a hard job.
no one is beaten like this when making kung fu movie.
hard job will make me successful.
your elder brother is doing show business also.
why don't you ask him to help you a bit?
he will only step down on me.
it hurt. Bear it for a while.
Thanks, Marry.
take if for me.
mom.
Tai Chi, please help your sister.
you make movies and sing.
mom, I am hungry, let's eat now.
look at your sister, the wire broke and she is injured.
I did ask her not to enter for that so called Miss what.
it's all dirty business.
she's made relation with others, but failed to win.
she only got second runner.
she had to sing contract, making series that no one will watch.
it's really hard to be in show business.
look, one must be talented and with big body.
Ann is different.
I've decided to root her by making a special programme for her at TV.
she must make a fame with my help.
brother, why don't you help me too?
it's not that easy, it depends on whether the audience like or not.
tell me, which part do audience like you?
say.
brother, you needn't step on me even if you won't help me.
just look at Ann.
she has sexy body.
and you, you're have no figures at all.
a movie star must be sex appealing.
do you have such points?
if you can become famous,
I'll cut here and let you cook it.
cut!
okay, move the machine here.
hung, Okay now.
remember to call me up when you arrive there...
just 4 phrases, you needn't work so hard.
we're actor, we must be professional.
we're forever extras...
I want to become insurance agent.
everyone says insurance make big money.
I say that Hung is not good enough.
she's so thin, how can she become leading actress?
she's girlfriend of the boss here. Right.
what's so special? I can too, I'm also a woman.
she has good figures, you have it?
Yeah!
cut!
hung, what do you mean?
director, look at them, how I can make?
will you keep quiet?
it's not first day work here.
don't be afraid, let's shoot again, okay?
what's so special?
maybe her busts are fake.
listen, once I changed clothes in the same room.
I saw her busts are hard, not bouncy at all.
is it true?
I don't know how those girls enlarge their busts.
I know, my friend went for plastic surgery.
she said surgeon cut open the armpit and put some jelly inside.
there's a scaring way, just like opening bottle lid.
cutting the nipples open...
...then put some jelly inside, close the lids again.
no scar can be seen after that.
is it that horrible?
there's even more horrible way.
they say in Mainland a woman made it this way.
the surgeon cut the nipples down and put on the desk.
who knows while the surgeon was doing the operation...
...a mouse bit away one of them.
cut!
what is it? What are you doing?
what are you doing when we're shooting the movie?
go away!...we don't need you today!
sorry... those extras are troublesome,
I'll cast them away.
sorry, let's shoot again.
go away. Let's go.
let's leave.
Helen, I want to ask you the name of the surgeon.
why, your want plastic surgery?
no, my friend wants it.
does she?
I want...I...
I want...to have my busts enlarged.
want to have you busts enlarged.
you heard what I said?
everyone comes here to have their busts enlarged.
but I must tell you first, there're several ways to do it.
I don't want to "Open the lid."
open the lid?
the way of cutting down the nipples and placing them on the desk.
I heard someone underwent it and mouse bit one away.
we're not making horrible movies.
I don't want cutting under the armpit, I fear ticking.
let's cut open from under the busts then.
I fear there'll be scars left.
there's no perfection in this world.
Then...don't enlarge them too much, please.
if they hang down a little, they'll cover the scars.
it's the first time a patient request hanging busts.
doctor, you must help me.
I must become a woman with big busts.
okay, you can have very big busts, but you will have big pressure after that too.
no, I want big busts!
I want big busts...
Okay...big busts...
I want them pretty too.
sure, they'll be pretty.
what if they're not pretty?
come back and change for pretty ones then.
Really?
then you must follow my instructions carefully.
after the surgery, you must massage your busts every day.
you must go on fast too.
you must stop sexual life for a while.
otherwise they won't be pretty.
okay, let me see your busts now.
how is it?
do you play mahjong?
Yes, what is it?
it's not flat, they have shape.
but they'll become super after the surgery.
Really?
doctor, I have a request.
what is it?
doctor... can I go without injection?
but injection will speed up recovery.
are you singer Mike?
no, I'm not.
yue seems to live up there, you come to see her?
no, you take me for someone else.
your change!
Mike! Inform the newspaper at once.
why isn't she in? She said she's in.
it's bad.
my boyfriend is arriving, you'd better leave now.
he must kill you if he sees you.
no...
go away, you're bad.
you dare woo my girl?
you want to be killed?
run? I'll break your legs if you run on, stop.
I won't run then.
you beat me so hard?
I must beat you back.
why must you play so hard?
sure, that will bring me excitement.
okay, we beat each other now.
it's a fair play.
where are we dining tonight?
we're dining out?
why, we haven't dined out for a long time?
but Paparazzi are working hard these days.
why fear?
of course you don't fear, you make comics.
being a singer, my company won't like this.
must we stay home and eat instant noodle again?
let's order pizza. Okay then.
you men are all like this.
I'm a normal man, so I have normal need.
I have one thing for you.
good. Come on.
what is it?
my buddy, Lusy.
go find her if you need help.
nuts! I don't need her, I need you!
are you having breakfast at Cheung Hing Restaurant?
no way.
it's all right,
paparazzi won't get up so early.
let's go.
come on...
my trousers fall down?
I'll get the car.
they're coming out...
you spend the night at Yue's home, you live with her?
we're only common friends.
we spent the night only discussing the script.
the whole night discussing the script?
there's nothing to say, he has told you already.
yue, I'll leave now, okay.
call me up.
Mike!
let's discuss later.
call me for a tea, okay?
are you a man?
Cheers!
miss Hung, haven't drunk with you for ages.
I've been busy, I didn't mean it.
is it true? Sure.
you're singer and play in TV series, you don't know us?
we're buddies, why are you fooling me?
how long haven't you played with us?
aren't I sitting with you,
dirty Shane?
do you remember your ex-boyfriend, Vinci?
it's long ago, don't mention it anymore.
he's guard in here.

Yes.
hung!

fame? No, but a flame.

don't say such dirty thing again.
come, let's cheers.
okay, drink!
let's cheers.
we haven't met for ages, come to my place.
Vinci, you have so many girls, you don't need me now.
Hey, we were a good couple.
you're famous now, you must take care of me.
nuts, what do you want me to help you?
I know some men from Mainland.
help me, sing with them and drug...
shit! You take me as a whore?
bitch! You pretend clean?
your first time was with me in a garbage room.
go to hell.
you're daring, movies star!
let's go!
go away! Right.
hung, how are you, are you okay?
are you alright? Don't be angry.
are you alright?
come, let's drink.
let's drink. Drink.
drink, come, let's cheers.
Cheers!
why must you drink in karaoke of TST East?
you're a singer, you now get beaten up.
how can we do the promotion?
I've told reports
I ran into an accident.
will they believe this?
five men beat you up, they took your photo too.
your CD has only 150 copies for the trial order.
what can I do?
sorry.
sorry?
we've decided to freeze you.
no, if so, I'll quit.
go away if you must.
you own us expenses of hair, make-up and costume.
you must settle up with it this year.
if not, you'll be sued.
I don't think I'll die if I leave here.
how are you, I am Yue.
it's the first time I host a programme.
you might wonder it's time for a kill.
no, though I make amusing movies...
...I just want to tell you.
the woman who is always bullied, who always picks her nose...
...is indeed a sentimental woman.
okay, I know many of you are calling up.
I promise
I will chat with you today.
Hello, who are you?
are you Yue?
Yes, who are you?
I'm Patrick, same name with your boyfriend.
you're wrong,
Patrick and I are common friends.
we just have tea together if we have time.
he's not my boyfriend at all.
don't pretend, everyone knows you live in Tin Hau Street.
cut it off!
let it, audience likes it.
the care-taker always see you coming out together.
I think you must be mistaken.
I suggest you consult an oculist at once.
your eyes must be weak.
no, it's said paparazzi took your photos when you went out.
he then dumped you and ran away.
how come you love such a man?
are you nuts?
being a man, I feel ashamed of him.
I've said...you eyes are weak.
I think the one who have weak eyes is you.
if not, you should dump him at once.
I ask you, you love him because he is famous?
do you?
answer me.
dead Air, play a song now.
is it Patrick? Yes.
you pay attention to Yue's affairs very much.
who are you?
me? I'm your friend, Yin Chau.
yin Chau? You haven't hosted a programme for ages.
right, I haven't done that for ages, but today at "thunder 887..."
...we have such a wonderful girl as host here.
I can't help...
chatting with you.
is it true?
I say, it's first time for Yue to host a programme.
she has not experience at all.
you must fear your boss blame you for hiring her with big money.
otherwise you wouldn't come to help this little girl.
you stress much for her.
sure, this little girl reminds me of something.
even God will love her.
everybody will love her.
must you say so about her?
this is my true words.
of course I exaggerate a bit.
Patrick, let me dedicate this song to you.
you're thirsty, drink this.
thank, Miss Yin.
call me Queenie.
today at the Studio...
...I didn't know how to do if you didn't help me out.
I behaved like a dummy, don't know why.
it's your first day, every new DJ behaves like this.
but you praised me, it'll bring me pressure.
I know I was lying.
this is it.
I want to invite you to dinner.
why, so old-fashioned?
no, what about playing mahjong with me?
I don't know.
okay, lose some money to me.
it's a deal.
tonight at 8.
you're too slow, I'm nearly asleep.
wait, I'll decide soon.
she's new, don't force her.
go to sleep if you must.
why do you protect her this way?
okay, Spot 3?
your turn, you win my money.
new player? She wins so much.
spot 2. Spot 2?
made it, Spot 2!
are you mistaken, Queenie?
you played stupidly.
you threw the plates for her, why?
you want to seduce her?
what did you say?
sister Lin, is dinner ready?
after this game.
let's eat after the game.
she's so lucky,
I fear it'll take a long time.
sorry, I am sorry.
it's okay, as long as you're happy.
you know, mahjong curse all diseases.
Yeah, we needn't pay at all.
try this abalone, it's been cooked for 3 days.
Thanks.
very soft inside!
sister Lin, your cooking is great.
can you manage?
I don't know cooking, my boss made it herself.
you're so great.
I know a bit only.
your must teach me.
no problem, I'll write down the recipe for you.
you must use first grade abalone.
good, I'll cook it for Patrick.
you're still with him?
I hear nothing.
let's eat soup.
it's time for us to calm down.
we've been together for ages, I must try to fix it.
I'm a mad woman, no men like me.
you're so naive.
Queenie, you're smart too.
want to be fired? Shut up.
who are you looking for?
miss Yin asks me to send you this.
Thanks.
yue, send you these abalone for cooking.
...and also some bird's nest, cook every other day.
women must eat nutritiously or they'll grow old.
Thanks, Sister.
wait for me here.
director, how long will take you?
what how long? I go inside and ask Maggie to go away.
it's not too good, it's weekend anyway.
it's a place for rich guys.
if you go and sit there, you mean you want rich guys to take you?
I don't think Maggie is such a girl.
how come you know?
a bosomy woman!
let me see.
it's a bit too much.
right, she wasn't a bosomy woman before, why is her bosom getting so large now?
I hear pumpkin will enlarge women's bosom.
then you should eat a lot.
you're bad, you're ironic to me?
you look.
doesn't she have a husband?
she's called Pink, she's wife of Brother Pin.
in this society, such is social activity.
after social activity is sexual intercourse.
how come you speak so dirty?
not as dirty as she is.
I'm sorry for Brother Pin.
why are you staring at them?
she turned me down at the boutique last time.
I wonder if there's still chance to make friends with her.
hung, introduce her to please.
she's Movie Queen, I am not up to knowing her.
you're lousy singer, of course you don't know her.
drink you wine!
send another of that bottle to that table, charge me please.
sure.
your boyfriend?
Director...here!
Maggie, come on.
Why? I want to sit a bit more, why leave now?
right, Director, what movie are you shooting?
silly movies are in trend now, or it's movie of suicide.
I have now movies to shoot.
make some other movies or put commercial elements in them.
shall I shoot her picking nose or throwing cakes?
I won't make such silly movies.
brother, are they running down on you?
why get me involved?
it was only joking...
let's drink, come on...
why to drink? We've finished all the wine.
half a dozen Budweiser.
we haven't ordered any beer.
that Mr. Tong buys the beer for Miss Maggie.
who is he?
I don't know.
he doesn't know you but buys you wine?
kao Shing...
sir, who are you? I'm Maggie boyfriend.
I think you're mistaken.
I'm only Maggie's fans, nothing serious.
I tell you, we don't know you.
so please take these back!
what are you doing?
go away.
I said I'll sit a bit longer.
okay.
sorry.
I've never seen such mannish guy, nuts!
Yes, there is.
any male who approaches Maggie will stir him up.
he wants to be your only man.
he irritates me want to have a leak, I wanna go to toilet.
kao Shing...
what's happened?
our difference is too big.
you're Movies Queen, I am nobody.
I'm no more a popular kung fu star, a lousy director only.
I'm not up to be with you!
I've never thought of this.
I have.
what do you want then?
I want you to leave at once, okay?
Queenie, are you drunk?
I love you very much.
I am scared.
I am serious.
I am seriously scared too.
Yue...
I love you too, but...
lesbian isn't my cup of tea.
okay? Wash the face now.
Maggie, sorry for the chaos just then.
it's not your fault.
can we make friends?
you may woo me.
come woo me if you're 3 inches taller.
I'm 30 already, l...
make yourself taller be snapping on your own face 30 times daily.
sure, snap you own face first.
let's go, what if we go yachting?
no, you want to screw me.
it's not your first time, don't pretend.
I said I won't go, leave me alone.
you're lousy singer, go to hell!
look at this Hing.
she's her busts enlarged, what does she want?
for movie, she is holding a press conference tomorrow.
she's announcing to make 3 X-rated movies.
welcome to the press conference of "Enjoy Yourselves."
Hing, you work very hard for this charitable activity.
right, you're making a fame recently.
your company is making you top star.
they want to shoot a TV series in Yunnan.

let's take a short break.
there will be shows later on.
I won't shoot it you don't listen to what I say.

hing will also perform picking eggs.
eggs will be placed on every part of her body.
if she manages to pick one up, the Directors will donate $50, 000.
good, good work from Hing!
Why? Eggs again?
why destiny puts me with eggs together?
okay, let's do a little example.
36
37
38! Great! 38 eggs now.
what a coincidence! 38 eggs.
my busts are 38 inches too.
Hing, you work so hard, you want to make X-rated films?
if it's a good script, I don't mind at all.
are you discussing the contract?
I'm discussing about 3 movies right now.
Yes, my daughter has decided to make 3 X-rated films.
I encourage her to do so.
she has great figures.
Yes, sure, thanks.
I must invite you to the Premiere.
okay, goodbye...
bad guys, they all send flowers at once.
Hing, you're doing very correctly this time.
I just fear you'll make your brother lose face.
what? I don't care a dime.
no, your brother is bad tempered.
mom, where's Hing? Is she in?
she is in.
ask her to stay,
I'm coming back at once.
Hing, your brother seems to be very angry.
what shall we do?
I fear he'll beat you, go away at once.
okay.
sister.
congratulations, Sister.
congratulate, me?
but I'm making X-rated films.
audience is most important, it's art.
have you signed your singing contract yet?
not yet.
sign it with me then.
I must air a special programme every night for you.
everyone will see you every night.
aren't your special programmes for that Coke bottle?
what Coke bottle? She's as fat as Coke can now.
she's not as sexy as you now.
I don't like that.
go to hell.
you Coke can have wasted mush of my money.
HK people don't like you anymore, no one buy your CD.
those people in Mainland like you, they buy pirated CD only.
I must promote Hing this time.
I can't become popular.
Yes, You will.
if I become popular, you must cut it?
it's nothing special to cut it,
I cut hundreds of time a year,
I don't want you to cut it.
I'm considerate for Ann.
never mind her, I must take you popular.
do you like it? Buy it if you like.
I have lots of money, just buy as long as you like.
I make money being an actress, I hate spending other's money.
I don't mean this.
what do you mean then?
can be make friends?
but I stall have a friend there.
William, are you trying to snatch her from me?
hing is now my girlfriend.
credit my account for whatever Miss Hing buys.
Mr. Chiu has just opened an account for Miss Hing.
everything she buys will be debited directly.
that requires a $2 million from the bank.
you want to show me your money?
I don't fear to do that.
come, give me the bill.
never mind him, Miss. Go away...
Hing, it's hard to look for you.
master King, What a coincidence! Where's your girl?
don't laugh at me, I dumped her long ago.
I am wrong, can be start again?
what start again?
me and you were just common friends.
two men nearly went for a fight over there just then.
I might consider it if you defeat them.
what are they doing?
everything changes ever since Hing went for plastic surgery.
if you want, go for plastic surgery too.
Hello, may I speak to Patrick?
I'm his friend from HK.

what do we do here?
make love, what else do you want?
I need to service them from dawn to night?

what other rules are there?
because of religion reasons,
prince is most respected here.
when making love, only he can touches you, you mustn't touch him.

but her husband admit in the office this morning.
I find that both of them are nuts!

Yeah, they make up stories.
I...didn't marry your for money.
I love you really.
all these years, I've worked hard for your career.
I've raised the children for you.
I've made efforts for them.
and now they said I have monkey affairs.
I'm suffering, Pin!
I know, I know.

then you needn't fly around.
don't influence him like this.
right, Henry, what do you think about HK?
it's big place, and the laws are stricter.
the stock regulation is good.
there's China concept in investing here.
with bright future.
this silly girl used to lend money to her friends...
...and buy properties worthless at all.
now I handle all that and she earns 3% just within 2 months.
what if... you manage my properties as well.
no problem.
let's go shopping in Landmark...
...and let the men talk business.

I won't care about you.

take off your clothes and go to the bed.
prince is happy after screwing you last time.
so he asks his brother to share happiness with him.

Thanks.
Hey, can you come back tonight?
I can't.

I'll drink red wine alone, listen to music.
and it's my birthday this way.
this is it.
nuts, come back soon.
okay, wait till I come home.
I'm good girl.
okay, I must hang up.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
let's celebrate when you come back.
wait for me then.
goodbye. Goodbye.
sorry to bother you.
you skin is smooth too.
is it?
why don't you hold a skin-care talk? You mean it?
sure.
I'll go for bath now.
it's not true, no...
what's no?
your girlfriend is waiting for you outside.
shit!
what shall we do?
don't shout! Stand aside!
must I go out and apologize like this?
when love is nearly dead, you must let it be over.
happy birthday.
you're pretty,
miss Shung, what is your feeling?
no feeling, as I always play the role of bride in movies.
this is a real marriage, it's not same.
how come Mr. Tong hasn't arrived yet?
right, let me call him up.
the number you dial is not connected, please try again later.
miss Shung, your call. Thanks.
Maggie, Hing speaking.
why are you so nervous?
many policemen went to your boyfriend's company this morning.
how come?
general has been looking for him for days, do you know where he is?
I've worked night notice these 2 days, haven't seen him.
I'm trying on my wedding gown.
no, let's find him in the company.
see you later.
Hing.
Maggie, hurry.
honey, how is it going?
you still call me honey?
I've lost $90 million!
what? You're Miss Shun Maggie?
Yes, I am.
I am from Commercial Criminal Bureau.
I want to know your relation with Henry Tong.
he's my boyfriend.
we suspect he's making use of your fame and some empty shell companies...
...to cheat others and business organizations.
where is he now?
we do want to know too.
no way, how come he cheats me?
it's bad, I've given him all my money to manage.
what shall we do now?
honey, give it back to me please.
give you hell! Don't come to see me again!
stop taking photos!
come and work now, men.
I'm sorry.
no, it's none of your business.
he's just a man, we can find another.
but being buddies is forever.
stink men are just clouds in the sky.
we mustn't be too serious for them.
I never thought that he was such a guy.
forget it, Maggie.
being in show business, we seem to enjoy very much.
in fact, we're poorer than ordinary girls.
just dating is a pressure for us already.
and about this incident, I just wonder...
...what magazines will write about.
what do you intend to do?
I want to take a rest in US.
maybe I can get a new man to heal me.
what if you come with me?
wounds at heart are not so easy to be healed.
I know how to heal my wallet.
right, all your money is gone.
come with me.
it doesn't suit me that way.
be take care.
bye bye.
you have chosen?
you're been running down behind me for half hour.
Yes, it's me, what then?
why do you look down on others? Shit!
it's you who forced me to do all that.
Maggie, you haven't come for ages, where have you been?
I've been to France for half a year.
you had a good time?
I'll wait outside.
no, you stay here.
okay.
Maggie, is this you new boyfriend?
have you checked about Henry Tong?
why do you take photos without asking others?
it's public place, we have rights to take photos.
what's the difference with raping?
stop! Give me that!
Maggie, what a coincidence!
let me introduce you my boyfriend.
Julian Chu, he runs convenience stores in U. S.
how are you, let's talk next time, goodbye.
it's all for me. Sure.
send them to my home. Yes.
I've got to go, goodbye. Goodbye.
Hi!
how are you, what a coincidence!
can we talk for a while?
what can we talk?
I hear you've shot an art film, very successful.
good, I've fulfilled my wish at last.
it's better than always making amusing films.
it's good.
I know you've helped me so much behind.
I've go to go.
yue.
can we start from the beginning?
no, I'm scared already.
at least we...can be friends.
I have a programme perfect for you.
Wa!...You again?
the name of the programme is nice.
you use this trick again?
when I was a kid,
whenever I'd feel small or lonely,
I'd look up at the stars.
wondered if there was life up there.
turns out I was looking in the wrong direction.
when alien life entered our world, it was from deep beneath the pacific ocean. A fissure between two tectonic plates.
a portal between dimensions.

I was fifteen when the first Kaiju made land in San Francisco.
by the time Tanks, Jets and Missiles took it down.
6 days and 35 miles later,
three cities were destroyed.
<b> </b>
tens of thousands of lives were lost.
we mourned our dead,
memorialized the attack,
and moved on.
and then, only 6 months later,

named Kaiju Blue.
and then the third one hit Cabo.
and then the fourth.
and then we learned...
this was not gonna stop.
this was just the beginning.
we needed a new weapon.
the world came together, pooling its resources.
and throwing aside old rivalries. For the sake of the greater good.
to fight monsters,
we created monsters of our own.
the Jaeger Program was born.
there were setbacks at first.
the neural load to interface with a Jaeger, proved too much for a single pilot.
a two Pilot system was implemented.
left Hemisphere, right Hemisphere pilot control.
we started winning.

jaegers stopping Kaijus everywhere.

but the Jaegers were only as good as their pilots.
so Jaeger pilots turned into rock stars.
danger turned into propaganda.
Kaijus into toys.
we got really good at it.

then it all changed.

I think even you can see, marshal,
this is no longer a sound strategy.
this is no longer a sound strategy.

the frequency of the attacks has increased.

the Jaegers are not the most viable line of defense anymore.
the Jaegers are not the most viable line of defense anymore.
I am aware.
those are my Rangers that die...
everytime a Jaeger falls,
which is why I'm asking you for one last chance...
- Excuse me, marshal. Excuse me!
one final assault with everything we've got. - Listen to me.
the Jaeger Program is dead, marshal.
on the other hand,
the Coastal Wall Program is a promising option.
the world appreciates all that you and your men have done,
but it's over.
we will authorize you to take all remaining Jaegers...
to the last battle station: Hong Kong.
we're prepared to fund you for the next 8 months.
while the coastal wall is completed.
after that,
you will receive no further support.
you have your answer, marshal.
so that's it?
it's over?
suits and ties, flashy smiles.
that's all they are, Stacker.
we don't need 'em.
ration cards, guys! Come on, come on!
let's go!
now, I got good news and I got bad news, fellas.
which one you wanna hear first?
bad news!
bad news:
three guys died yesterday working the top of the wall.
what's the good news?
the good news is:
I got three new job openings.
top of the wall.
okay, who wants to work? Who wants to eat?
come on!
I am here in Sydney, where earlier today,
yet another Kaiju attack took place.
the Kaiju, an enormous category 4,
broke through the coastal wall in less than an hour.
the wall of life had been deemed unbreached by its builders.
why the hell are we even buildin' this thing?
that... thing. Went through the wall like it was nothing. - Ironically, it was.
the recently decommissioned Jaeger, Striker Eureka,
piloted by Herc and Chuck Hansen,
that finally took the beast down.
look, they decommissioned the Jaeger Program...
because of mediocre pilots. It's that simple.
that's Striker Eureka's tenth kill to date.
it's a new record.
and you're still going to Hong Kong, even at a time like this?
well, orders are orders. What else am I supposed to do?
come on, mate.
Chuck Hansen, one of the pilots of Striker Eureka,
the Jaeger that took down the Kaiju...
Mr. Becket.
marshal. Looking sharp.
long time.
5 years, 4 months.
can I have a word?
step into my office, marshal.
took me a while to find you.
anchorage, Sheldon point, Nome...
Yeah, a man in my position travels with the wall,
chasing shifts to make a livin'.
what do you want?
I've spent the last 6 months.
activating everything I can get my hands on.
there's an old Jaeger,
a Mark 3.
you may know it. It needs a pilot.
I'm guessing I wasn't your first choice.
you are my first choice.
all the other Mark 3 pilots are dead.
look...
I can't have anyone else in my head again.
I'm done.
I was still connected to my brother when he died.
I can't go through that again, man, I'm sorry.
haven't you heard, Mr. Becket?
the world is coming to an end.
so where would you rather die?
here, or in a Jaeger?
Mr. Becket.
this is Mako Mori.
one of our brightest.
also in charge of the Mark 3 Restoration Program.
she personally handpicked your copilot candidates.
Hey.
at ease.
we will tour the facility first.
and then Miss Mori will show you to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket.
wait for us, please! - Hold the door, please!
thank you...
stay back! Kaiju specimens are extremely rare,
so look but don't touch, please.
Mr. Becket, this is our research team.
Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Geiszler.
Oh, no, call me Newt.
only my mother calls me Doctor.
Herman, these are human beings. Why don't you say hello?
I have asked you...
not to refer to me by my first name around others.
I am a Doctor with over 10 years decorated experience... - Oh, no, yes.
10 years of experience. Man, I feel so bad and tired.
Oh, please.
who is that, Yamarashi?
Oh, this little Kaiju? Yeah, you got a good eye.
my brother and I took him down in 2017.
you know he was one of the biggest category 3s ever?
he was 2, 500 tons of awesome.
or awful. You know, whatever you wanna call it. - Yes, please excuse him.
he's a Kaiju groupie. He loves...
shut up, Herman, I don't love them, okay?
I study them.
and unlike most people,
I wanna see one alive and up close one day.
trust me, you don't wanna.
so that's your research division?
things have changed.
we're not an army anymore, Mr. Becket.
we're the resistance.
welcome to the Shatterdome.
war clock.
we reset it after every Kaiju attack.
keeps everyone focused.
the frequency of attacks is accelerating.
how long till the next reset?
a week, if we're lucky.
my experts believe there'll be a Kaiju attack.
even before that.
this complex used to lodge 30 Jaegers.
in five bays just like this one.
now we only have 4 Jaegers left.
I didn't know it was this bad.
it is that bad.

on they watch it stayed unbreached for 6 years.
6 years.
Herc! Chuck!
gentlemen, welcome to Hong Kong!
wait here.
Max! Come here! Remember me?
don't drool all over Miss Mori. - Hi.
sees a pretty girl and he gets all wound up.
raleigh, this is Hercules Hansen,
an old friend from the Mark 1 glory days.
I know you, mate. We rode together before.
we did, sir. 6 years ago. My brother and I.
it was a 3 Jaeger team drop. - That's right. Manila.
sorry about your brother.
thank you, sir.
Herc and his son Chuck'll be runnin' point.
usin' Striker Eureka.
fastest Jaeger in the world.
first and last of the Mark 5s.
australia decommissioned it a day before the Sydney attack.
Yeah, it was lucky we were still around.
Yep. Now it's runnin' point for us.
wait, running point on what?
you haven't told me what I'm doing here yet.
we're going for the breach, Mr. Becket.
we're gonna strap a 2, 400 pound.
thermonuclear warhead to Striker's back.
detonate an equivalent of 1. 2 million tons of TNT,
and you, and two other Jaegers will be runnin' defense for them.
thought we were the resistance.
Where'd you get something that big?
see the Russians back there?
they can get us anything.
herc, shall we?
good to have you back. - Thank you, sir.
I'll show you to your Jaeger now.
miss Mori,
will you give me a minute?
Marshal!
sir, we've hit the breach before.
it doesn't work. Nothing goes through.
what's changed?
I've got a plan. I need you ready.
that's all.
let's go, Herc!
Max, come here!
crew 17, please report to the fifth floor
zero minus two.
xy minus two. Req...
in the beginning, the Kaiju attacks were spaced by 24 weeks.
then 12, then 6, then every 2 weeks.
the last one in Sydney was a week.
in 4 days, we could be seeing a Kaiju every 8 hours, until they are coming...
every 4 minutes.
marshal, we should witness a double event within 7 days.
Mr. Gottlieb,
I'm to drop a 2, 400 pound thermonuclear bomb.
I need more than a prediction.
well, uh, that's a problem, then.
because see, he actually can't give you anything more than a prediction.
no Kaiju entrails over my side of the room.
you know the rules.
every bloody day. It's incessant. - Gents! On point.
numbers do not lie.
politics and poetry, promises, these are lies.
numbers are as close as we get to the handwriting of God. - What? God.
would you give me a moment?
there will be a double event.
and then, shortly thereafter, 3. And then 4.
and then we're dead.
I get it. - At last.
this is where the good news comes.
here is our universe,
and here is theirs.
and this is what we call "The throat," the passage between the breach and us.
we know that it's atomic in nature.
I predict that the increased traffic will force the breach to stabilize.
and remain open long enough.
to get the device through...
and collapse its structure.
Yeah, and that's where I gotta chime in.
because, really, I wouldn't wanna go in there.
with that limited amount of information.
Newton, don't embarrass yourself. - That's what I was tryin' to say.
just hear me out for a second. Give me a second, please.
why do we judge the Kaiju on a category system?
it's because each one is completely different from the next, right?
you see what I'm saying?
one looks like a shark and one looks like a fish... - Dr. Geiszler.
just get to the point. - Yes.
the point is I don't think they're all completely different after all.
these are some samples I collected, all right?
now, this one here was harvested in Sydney.
and this was harvested in Manila.
6 years ago.
they have the same exact DNA.
they're clones.
and this is the point where he goes completely crazy.
there's so much more to the Kaiju than we understand.
and we've really only scratched the surface.
this is a piece of a Kaiju's brain.
now, unfortunately, it's damaged.
it's a little bit weak.
but it's still alive.
now, I think I can tap into it.
using the same technology.
that allows the two Jaeger pilots to share a neural bridge.
now, think about that.
I could tell you exactly how to get through the breach yourselves.
you're suggesting that we initiate a drift with a Kaiju?
no, no... Not like a whole Kaiju, you know,
just a tiny piece of its brain.
the neural surge would be too much for the human brain.
I agree. - I don't agree.
Gottlieb, I'd like your data on my desk ASAP.
sir.
no, but his is so... - Thank you, Newt.
guys, now, this is the most amazing thing...
Newton, I know that you're desperate to be right.
so you've not wasted your life being a Kaiju groupie,
but it's not going to work.
it is going to work, Herman.
and I'll tell you something else.
fortune favors the brave, dude.
you heard them. They won't give you the equipment, and even if they did...
you'd kill yourself.
well, I'd be a rock star.
there she is.
Oh, my God.
look at her.
gipsy Danger.
God, it's so beautiful.
she looks like new.
better than new.
she has a Double core Nuclear reactor.
she's one of a kind now.
she always was.
how do you like your ride, Becket boy?
solid iron hull, no alloys.
forty engine blocks per muscle strands.
Hyper-torque driver for every limb and a new fluid synapse system.
come here. - Tendo.
it's good to see you, buddy.
it's good to see you too, brother.
it's just like old times.
so what's your story?
restoring old Jaegers,
showing has been like me around.
that can't be it.
you a pilot?
no. Not yet.
but I wanna be one, more than anything.
what's your simulator score?
51 drops, 51 kills.
wow, that's amazing.
but you're not one of the candidates tomorrow?
I am not.
the marshal has his reasons.
Yeah, he always does, doesn't he?
but with 51 kills, I can't imagine what they could be.
I hope you approve of my choices.
I've studied your fighting techniques and strategy.
even... Alaska.
and what do you think?
I think you're unpredictable.
you have a habit of deviating from standard combat techniques.
you take risks and injure yourself and your crew.
I don't think you're the right man for this mission.
Wow.
thank you for your honesty, you might be right.
but one day, when you're a pilot,
you're gonna see that in combat...
you make decisions.
and you have to live with the consequences.
that's what I'm trying to do.
the candidates are ready.
we will commence the trials immediately, sir.
good. - But there is one thing.
mako, we have talked about this.
we will not be talking about it again.
you promised me.
vengeance is like an open wound.
you cannot take that level of emotion into the drift.
Raleigh.
come sit with us.
Oh, I'm okay, thank you...
Ah, come on, there's plenty of room at our table.
I haven't seen bread in awhile.
hong Kong.
beauty of an open port, no rationing.
we've got potatoes, peas, sweet beans, decent meat loaf.
pass the potatoes.
raleigh, this is my son, Chuck.
he's my copilot now.
he's more my copilot, right, Dad?
so you're the guy, eh?
you're the guy who's gonna run defense for me in that old rust bucket of yours?
that's the plan.
good.
so when was the last time you jockeyed, Ray?
about 5 years ago.
what have you been doin' for 5 years?
something pretty important, I reckon.
I was in construction.
Oh, wow, that's great.
that's really useful. Uh, you know,
we get into a fight, you can build our way out of it, eh, Ray?
it's Raleigh.
whatever.
look, you're Pentecost's bright idea.
my old man, he seems to like you,
but it's guys like you who brought down the Jaeger Program.
to me, you're dead weight.
you slow me down,
I'm gonna drop you like a sack of Kaiju shit.
I'll see you around, Raleigh.
come, Max.
you can blame me for that one.
I've raised him on my own, he's a smart kid, but...
but I never knew whether to give him a hug or a kick in the ass.
with respect, sir...
I'm pretty sure which one he needs.
okay, what?
you don't like 'em?
I thought you selected them personally.
excuse me?
every time a match ends, you make this little gesture,
like you're critical of their performance.
it's not their performance, it's yours, your gambit.
you could have taken all of them two moves earlier.
you think so? - I know so.
can we change this up?
how about we give her a shot?
Yeah!
no. We stick to the cadet list we have, Ranger.
only candidates with drift compatibility...
which I have, marshal.
mako, this is not only about a neural connection.
it's also about a physical compatibility.
what's the matter, marshal?
don't think your brightest can cut it in the ring with me?
go.
4 strikes marks a win.
remember, it's about compatibility.
it's a dialogue, not a fight.
but I'm not gonna dial down my moves.
okay.
then neither will I.
concentrate.
better watch it.
enough.
I've seen what I need to see.
me too.
she's my copilot.
that's not going to work.
why not?
because I said so, Mr. Becket.
I made my decision.
report to the Shatterdome in 2 hours,
and find out who your copilot will be.
Mako.
what was all that about?
I mean, I'm not crazy. You felt it, right?
we are drift compatible.
thank you for standing up for me.
but there is nothing to talk about.
that's my room.
excuse me.
I mean, come on. I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
mako, this is worth fighting for.
we don't have to just obey him.
it's not obedience, Mr. Becket.
it's respect.
would you at least tell me what his problem is?
in the wake of the Sydney incident,
which showed the ineffective nature of the Wall of Life Program,
many are questioning the government's motives.<b> </b>
and wondering why the Jaeger Program has been discontinued.<b> </b>
riots have erupted along the coastlines of several pan pacific cities.<b> </b>
now we have relocated millions of civilians...
and supplies, 300 miles inland to the safe zones.
safe zones? For the rich and powerful? What about the rest of us?
Yeah, answer the question.
I believe the wall of life is still our best option at this time.
and that's all I'm gonna say on the matter. Than... Thank you.
Kaiju / human drift experiment, take one.
the, uh...
the brain segment is the frontal lobe.
um, chances are... the segment's far too damaged to drift with.
unscientific aside:
Herman, if you're listening to this,
well, I'm either alive and I've proven what I've just done works...
in which case, ha, I won.
or I'm dead and I'd like you to know that it's all your fault.
it really is, you know, you drove me to this. In which case, ha, I also won.
sort of.

Marshal! Marshal!
I need to talk to you.
not now, Mr. Gottlieb.
I'm sure you can appreciate how important this moment is to me.
newton created a neural bridge from garbage and drifted with a Kaiju.
I found him prone, and he's sort of dazed.
I don't exactly know what to do.
I told you it would work.
Yes, you did.
well, what'd you see?
you know, it was only a fragment of a brain, so really all...
I was able to get was, like...
a series of, uh, images or... or impressions. You know?
like when you blink your eyes over and over again, all you really see are, like frames. Um, - It was emotional in the... - Newton, Newton.
okay, Newton. Newton, look at me. - It was so...
now I want you to take your time and be very specific.
okay, okay.
well, I don't feel like they're just...
following some sort of animalistic urge, you know, just hunting and gathering.
and I think they're attacking us under orders.
that's impossible.
is that impossible? - It's impossible.
because... - You know what? Why don't you drift with a Kaiju?
you! Shut up!
you, keep talking. - Yes, sir.
these beings, these masters, they're colonists.
they overtake worlds. They just...
they just consume them and then... they move on to the next.
and they've been here before in sort of a trial run.
it was the dinosaurs.
but the atmosphere wasn't conducive, right?
so they waited it out. And they waited it out.
and now, you know, with ozone depletion,
and carbon monoxide, polluted waters...
well, we've practically terraformed it for them.
cause now they're coming back, and it's perfect.
see, the first wave, that was just the hounds.
categories 1 through 4, it was nothing.
their sole purpose was to aim for the populated areas.
and take out the vermin... Us!
the second wave, that is the exterminators.
and they will finish the job.
and then, the new tenants will take possession.
see, the reason that I found the identical DNA.
in the two separate Kaiju organs is because they are grown!
Newton, I need you to do it again.
I need more information.
Wh...? I can't... I can't do it again.
I mean, not unless you have a fresh Kaiju brain lying around.
do you?
pretty impressive.
Yeah, he remembers how to turn it on.
boy, show some respect.
when his brother died, he got the Jaeger back to shore on his own.
I've known one other pilot's been able to do that.
now, there are certain individuals.
whose business is the preservation and exploitation of Kaiju remains.
Yeah, right, the black market dealers, right?
Yep. They're in and out in a matter of hours.
they neutralize the acidic factor of the blood,
and they harvest what they need.
now, this guy, he's Hannibal Chau.
he runs the Kaiju black market here in Asia.
when our funding ran out,
we turned to him for help, and in return,
I gave him exclusive rights to all Kaiju remains in the region.
you did that?

go to the corner of Fong and Tull.

and a word to the wise,
do not trust him.

would You Like to Try Again?
hello.
you looking for some Kaiju bone powder?
some... bone? Some bone powder?
uh, no, why would I want that?
male potency. I take it myself.
I see. Uh, no, thank you.
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.
come.
Hannibal Chau, huh?
good luck.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, this place is heaven!
that's a lymph gland from a category 2!
and what are you working on here?
is this a cuticle? In mint condition?
is that a Kaiju skin parasite?
I've never seen them alive before!
they usually die as soon as the Kaiju falls!
I thought you couldn't keep them alive!
you can if you soak 'em in Ammonia.
what do you want?
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.
I was told he was here.
who wants to know?
I really can't say.
stacker Pentecost sent me!
Oh, that's great. That's real great.
so I take it you're Hannibal Chau, right?
you like the name? I took it from, uh...
my favorite historical character.
and my second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn.
now tell me what you want,
before I gut you like a pig and feed you to the skin louse.
she can't control her drift, - And he went out of phase first! - We all know what happened.
we can't afford mistakes, the Kaiju keep evolving,
they keep kicking our asses!
he's a has been, she's a rookie.
I don't want them protecting my bomb run, sir.
you need to watch your tone, Mr. Hansen.
Hey, stay there.
give me a moment.
you two are a goddamn disgrace.
you're gonna get us all killed, and here's the thing, Raleigh:
I want to come back from this mission.
cause I quite like my life.
so why don't you just do us all a favor and disappear?
it's the only thing you're good at... - Stop! Now!
Yeah, that's right.
you just hold back your little girlfriend.
one of you bitches needs a leash.
apologize to her.
screw you.
I said apologize to her.
Hey! Hey! Enough! What's going on?
on your feet, both of you!
Becket, Mori, into my office, now.
no, we aren't finished! - Hey! Hey! This is over!
you're a Ranger, for Chrissake. Why don't you start acting like one?
I went out of phase first.
it was my mistake.
no.
it was my mistake.
I should have never let you two in the same machine.
so, what?
you're grounding us?
not you.
permission to be dismissed, sir.
permission granted, Miss Mori.
Mako.
sir, what are you doing?
she is the strongest candidate by far.
what other options do we have? Huh? Tell me!
do not let my calm demeanor fool you, Ranger!
now is not a good moment for your insubordination!
mako is too inexperienced.
to rein in her memories during combat.
that's not why you grounded her.
I was in her memories. I saw everything.
I don't care what you think you saw.
I know what she means to you. I saw it! I...
Hey! Hey!
this conversation is over.
Marshal..., can we just talk about this for one second?
you rescued her.
you raised her.
you're not protecting her now.
you are holding her back.
one.
don't you ever touch me again.
two.
don't you ever touch me again.
now, you have no idea who the hell I am or where I've come from,
and I'm not about to tell you my whole life story.
all I need to be to you and everybody...
in this dome is a fixed point.
the last man standing.
I do not need your sympathy or your admiration.
all I need is your compliance and your fighting skills.
and if I can't get that,
then you can go back to the wall that I found you crawling on.
do I make myself clear?
all crews please go to the seventh floor
all crews please go to the seventh floor
Yes, sir.
good.
I'm sorry.
I should've warned you.
first drifts are rough.
but you weren't just tapping into my memories.
you were tapping into my brother's too.
when Yancy was taken, we were still connected.
I felt his fear, his pain, his helplessness,
and then...
he was gone.
I felt it. I know.
you know, you live in someone else's head for so long.
the hardest part to deal with is the silence.
to let someone else in, to really connect,
you have to trust them.
and today the drift was strong.
her heart.
when's the last time you saw it?
not in a long time.

they believe the Kaiju are sent from heaven.
that the Gods are expressing their, displeasure with our behavior.
the silly bastards.
and what do you believe?
well...
I believe that Kaiju bone powder is 500 bucks a pound.
what do you want?
I need to access a Kaiju brain, completely intact.
no, no, no. The skull plate is so dense.
that by the time you drill into it...
the brain's rotted away, but I'm talking about the secondary brain.
now we both know that the Kaiju are so large.
they need two brains to move around, like a dinosaur.
I want to get my hands on that.
what the hell do you want a secondary brain for, anyway?
I mean, every part of the Kaiju sells.
cartilage, spleen, liver.
even the crap!
one cubic meter of crap, has enough phosphorous in it...
to fertilize a whole field!
but the brain...
too much Ammonia.
so what's the deal, little fella?
well, that's classified.
so I couldn't tell you. Even if I wanted to.
but it is pretty cool.
so I might tell you.
I'm gonna tell you.
I figured out how to drift with a Kaiju.
are you funnin' me, son?
it's fascinating how their minds work.
every single Kaiju, his mind's connected.
the species has like a... Like a hive mind.
holy Jesus.
you've gone and done it, haven't you?
I did it a little bit, yeah.
you goddamn moron.
get him.
hit him in the face.
Loccent! Typhoon and Alpha are in trouble.
we're movin' in!
you are to hold your ground, do not engage.
we need you to carry that bomb, do you copy?
Jesus, we can't just sit here and watch 'em die.
come on!
Ah, screw this.
Loccent, we're movin' in now!
Cherno Alpha, we've been hit with some type of acid!
come on! - Hull has been compromised.
we need backup immediately!
just hold on, Cherno! We're on our way!
our power move! Yeah!
we just lost Cherno, sir.

what's going on? What happened?
the blast. It jumbled all the Jaegers' electrical circuits.
what the hell was that? - Loccent!
I've never seen that before.
Loccent! - They're adapting.
this isn't a defense mechanism, it's a weapon!
get me Striker!
nothing, sir. The Mark 5's digital's fried.
it'll take me 2 hours to reroute the auxiliary.
all the Jaegers, they're digital!
not all of them, marshal.
Gipsy's analog. Nuclear.
we got 2 Kaijus. We gotta get out, This way boss.
hang on a second. Excuse me, what's going on?
there are 2 goddamn Kaiju, headed straight for Hong Kong city.
no... That's not possible. There's never been 2 before.
well, maybe...
that's cause nobody ever drifted with one before, eh, genius?
when Jaeger pilots drift, it's a two way street.
a bridge, right? It sets up a connection. - Of course. Yes!
both ways!
a hive mentality," you said!
maybe those Kaiju are tryin' to find you.
what... What're we gonna do?
I'm gonna wait out this shitstorm in my own private Kaiju bunker.
but you are going to a Public Refuge.
I tried it once.
once.
now get the hell outta here.
move! Move! I'm a Doctor! I'm a Doctor!
okay, hold on. Let me in.
okay, I'm a Doctor. Okay, let me in, I'm a Doctor.
there's no emergency power. - We gotta bail.
I'm gonna try somethin' else.
No! Don't disengage my arm！ - Hey!
come on! Get on your feet, old man!
don't call me that!
he's right outside, we gotta get outta here now!
we're not goin' anywhere!
now you and I are the only thing standin' between...
that ugly bastard and a city of 2 million people.
now we have a choice here, we either sit and wait.
or we take these flare guns and do something really stupid.
how's your arm? - Ah, just give me the gun.
Hey, you!
I think we just pissed it off!
all right, Mako.
get ready, this is for real!
Yeah! - Come on, Gipsy! Kick his ass!
come on! Let's do this! Together!

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. This isn't a Refuge.
this is a Buffet Line!
he knows I'm here...
he knows we're all here!
no, you don't understand, he's trying to get me!
he knows I'm here and he's trying to get me!
he knows I'm here and he's trying to get me!
what was that? What did you say? What was she saying?
what was that? What did you say? What was she saying?
I gotta get out of here! Let me out of here!
Ah, come on!
those were expensive glasses. - Get him outta here...

go to Dr. Geiszler now! - Yes, sir!
I want the two remaining Jaegers back to 100% functionality.
Yes, sir!
we're gonna harvest the skin, the talons and the wing.
Germans are gonna go nuts for that stuff.
let me see that map.
here is where the Kaiju fell,
here's where we concentrate our efforts.
we'll get it, boss. - Right.
Hey!
okay.
guess who's back, you one eyed bitch?
and you owe me a Kaiju brain.
Raleigh!
my kid'd never admit it...
but he's grateful.
we both are.
Mr. Becket!
miss Mori!
in all of my years fighting...
I've never...
seen anything like that.
well done.
proud of you.
proud of us all.
but...
as harsh as it sounds,
there is no time to celebrate.
we lost two crews.
no time to grieve.
reset that clock.
reset the clock.
I still can't believe what you did to me.
I mean, I coulda been eaten.
well, that was definitely the plan.
lucky for you, that didn't become necessary, huh?
okay. Thank you so much.
you're so kind, I really appreciate all of this.
but now do you mind tellin' me exactly what is taking so long.
for your workers to get that brain?
well, they pump the cavity full of CO2,
just like in any other Laparoscopic Surgery.
okay, yes, obviously, the CO2's gonna delay the acidic reaction, yes.
and it allows us to harvest.
but our boys need oxygen pumped into their suits.
they move slow.
what's goin' on in there, boys?
we've reached...
the Upper Pelvic Area.
moving to the 25th Vertebra.
shit.
even through the suit, boss,
it smells like dead catfish in here.
boss.
the secondary brain is damage.
it's ruin. - Oh.
destroy. - Bitch! How could they screw that up?
wait. Wait.
what was that? Did he say "wait"? Why, why wait?
do you hear that?
it's like a heartbeat.
Oh, my God... this can't be. Hold on a second.
Hey! Let me have that!
listen, listen!
listen to this.
it's pregnant.
no, no! Please.
No! No.
I knew it.

his lungs weren't fully formed.

that's all I needed. I knew he wouldn't make it.
ugly little bastard.
anyway, I woulda...
how sick are you?
and why didn't you tell me?
what's to tell?
you know, them Mark 1s,
we scraped them bad boys together in 14 months.
last thing we were thinking about was Radiation Shielding.
I ran nearly a dozen missions.
I stayed under the medical radar for awhile. But...
but the last time I jockeyed was Tokyo.
I finished the fight solo, but for 3 hours...
I burned.
they warned me if I ever stepped foot into a Jaeger again,
the toll would be too much.
you and I are the only two that ever ran solo combat.
that's why I brought you here.
what is it?
sir, it's happening.
I just got 2 signatures with unprecedented dilation, 40Meter spikes.
what category?
checking the ratios, category 4.
Where're they headed?
that's the thing, they're not headin' anywhere.
they're hovering just above the breach. It's...
it's like they're protecting it or something.
all right, Gipsy, Striker, on deck.
sir, Herc cannot ride. His arm...
you heard me.
biohazard 2 signatures.
2?
there are... 2 Kaiju signatures in the breach.
not 3 like I predicted? - Herman!
I haven't exactly had a very good day, okay?
I got about 5 minutes...
should be 3 Kaijus. - Before brain death occurs here!
I don't wanna spend it talking about your theories!
this is all wrong!
there should be 3 Kaijus coming through, not 2!
there should be 3 and there's 2? I'm sorry, it hurts - I am not wrong. to be wrong, doesn't it, Herman?
but there is something here that we don't understand.
okay. Herman, hopefully we can argue about any mistakes.
you made in your predictive model in the future!
but in the meantime, the neural interface is way off the charts!
if you want to help, help with that!
Newton, I am not wrong.
there is only one way to make sure...
and that is to do this together.
I'll go with you.
that's what the Jaeger pilots do,
share the neural load.
you're serious?
you would do that for me? Or...
you would do that with me?
well, with worldwide destruction a certain alternative...
do I really have a choice?
then say it with me, my man:
we're gonna own this bad boy!
by jove, we are going to own this thing for sure!
Oi, Tendo. Tendo!
you're not suited up.
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis.
I need to know what's going on.
he said suit up, so suit up.
Tendo, I can't pilot Striker on my own, now, can I?
dad's hurt, so who's gonna be my copilot?
I don't remember it being so tight.
getting back into that Jaeger will kill you.
not gettin' into one would kill us all.
listen,
you are a brave girl.
I'm so lucky to have seen you grow.
but if I'm going to do this...
I need you to protect me.
can you do that?
Hey.
everyone,
listen up!
today
today...
at the edge of our hope...
at the end of our time...
we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves,
but in each other.
today there's not a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone.
not today.
today we face the monsters that are at our door.
and bring the fight to them!
today we are canceling The Apocalypse!

Hey, marshal!
you know, that was a great speech, but...
how exactly are you and I, supposed to match up in there?
I carry nothing into the drift.

no rank.
and as for you...
well, you're easy.
you're an egotistical jerk with Daddy issues.

but you are your father's son...
so we'll drift just fine.

Hey, now.
when you drift with someone,
you feel like there's nothing to talk about.
I just don't want to regret all the things - Don't. that I never said out loud.
you don't need to.
I know them all.
I always have.
Hey. Hey, handsome.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.
you look after him for me.

that's my son you got there.

I never really thought about the future.

Oh, yes, yes.

they're stopping.
why the hell are they stopping? - I don't give a damn, sir!
we're 300 meters from the jump!
something's not right!
striker, the bogeys aren't following.
take the leap now!
don't do it!... it's not gonna work!
move, you Fascist!
blowing up the breach, it's not gonna work!
what do you mean? What's not gonna work?
sir, just because the breach is open.
does not mean you're gonna be able to get a bomb through.
the breach genetically reads the Kaiju like a...
a barcode at the supermarket and then lets them pass.
okay, so you're gonna have to fool the breach into...
thinking that you have the same code!
and how are we supposed to do that?
by making it think you are a Kaiju.
you have to lock onto the Kaiju, ride it into the breach.
the throat will then read the Kaiju's genetic code...
and let you pass.
if you don't do it, the bomb will deflect off the breach, like it always has...
and the mission will fail.
all right, now that you've heard all that, Striker, take the leap!
sir! I have a third signature emerging from the breach!

to be Continued...
where is my goddamn shoe?
thanks for Watching
reporter: The '"Rocky Mountain News,'" which has been around for 1 50 years, is publishing its last edition today.
a great newspaper is dead.
denver can"t support two newspapers any longer.
reporter #2: lt's a grim race to see who goes under first.
the "'Philadelphia Daily News"' and Minneapolis '"Star Tribune' are both in bankruptcy.
'"The Boston Globe'" and '"San Francisco Chronicle'" have been losing...
'"The Seattle Post-lntelligencer,'
the largest daily newspaper yet to go out of business...
tribune Company, owner of the '"LA Times'
and the '"Chicago Tribune'" filed for bankruptcy
and the Gannett Company is faltering...
all the news that was fit to print for 88 years...
after 146 years, the print edition is now a thing of the past...
the '"Grey Lady'" is suffering from...
woman: '"New York Times'" stock is off more than 75%...
man: '"The New York Times'"-- '"The New York Times,'" are you kidding me?!
the obituary column these days is full of the death notices of American daily newspapers.
so there's been a death watch on '"The New York Times'
as long as l've been covering media.
people are sort of fascinated with what's going to be the demise of this great institution.
and it hasn't come, and it hasn"t come, but that doesn"t lessen people's certainty that it will come.
okay, I see this as a big story.
I can probably get significant space.
what do you think the story is that I should tell?
lately when I finish an interview, most subjects have a question of their own:
what's going to happen at '"The New York Times'"?
even casual followers of the newspaper industry could rattle off the doomsday tick-tock.
Bruce Headlam.
Headlam: As much as we want to flatter ourselves, it"s still this very old-school business.
I'm the Media Editor.
you know, trees are still cut and papers are still delivered.
I just think that helps us sort of be in the mix.
yeah yeah. - Okay.
Carr: Not to worry, suggest the new-media prophets.
the end of '"The New York Times'" wouldn't be that big of a deal, they say, because tweets, blogs and news aggregators could create a new apparatus of accountability.
say again?
but some stories are beyond the database.
sometimes people have to make the calls, hit the streets and walk past the conventional wisdom.
richard Perez-Pena: Well, trust me, if your numbers are better than anybody else's I will write that.
I'm just always skeptical when everybody tells me that the numbers don"t mean what they appear to mean, you know.
because everybody gives me that line, so I don't accept it from anybody.
the collapse in advertising happened faster than anybody anticipated.
this year in 2009, there's been about a 30% decline in advertising revenue, on top of about a 1 7% decline last year, and nobody knows where that ends.
it might just be that something very permanent has changed.
two things have happened to '"The Times,'" I think in a way, most of all.
the first thing that"s happened, famously, is the advertising market has turned upside down. So at the same time as the revenue takes a hit, suddenly publishing has gone from being something done by a specialty class to being something that literally every connected citizen has access to.
so the authoritative tone with which "'The Times"' has always spoken is now one of many many voices in a marketplace.
and that reduction in advertising revenue coupled with the competition for attention-- both at the same time has turned this from a transition into a revolution.
so this is about wikileaks, which is a website which calls itself an intelligence agency for the people.
and yesterday they posted this video of a US attack, an aerial attack, where there were 1 2 people killed.
the government claimed at the time that these were insurgents, but it turns out there were two Reuters employees and then some other unknown people.
wikileaks somehow from an anonymous source gets the video and puts it on YouTube.
it felt like a possible front-page story to Bruce and l.
so now basically the assignment for the rest of the day is to keep the story interesting to editors.
we're trying to do a front-page story on what this means, and what this means for journalism.
clearly it's great for journalists in some ways, because then it's out there, but it"s this kind of collision of two worlds,
Iike this closed old world of expertise and classification and information and privacy and this new world that just kind of wants to crack it all open.
you know, we see it ourselves. we"re a perfect example of a kind of culture that, you know, is having what we do completely ripped open.
so it's-- hey, did you send it?
okay, yeah, I got it. Yeah, thanks. Bye.
this is-- these are watching people get killed in an incredibly graphic way in a war and hearing the reactions of the soldiers.
Stelter: I didn't see that-- the van flips over.
I didn't notice that last time.
God, what a fuckin' terrible story.
here's '"the nut graph'": '"The release of the lraq video is heaping attention on the once-obscure website, which aims to take advantage of the global reach of the internet and to bring to light hidden information about governments and multinational corporations.'
they didn't have to drop this off on the front step of NBC News or '"The New York Times.'
they just dropped it off on YouTube and waited for everybody else to find it.
Headlam: Even with '"The Pentagon Papers,'
they had to be delivered by hand and they can stop the presses.
this, they're just taking it and they're just putting it up there where everybody can see it.
Nixon: Hello. - Haig: Yes sir.
Nixon: Hi, Al, anything new on your front today?
Haig: Very significant this goddamn '"New York Times'" expose of the most highly-classified documents of the war.
Nixon: Well, God damn it, I am not going to have it.
Haig: I mean, could '"The Times'" be prosecuted?
Nixon: Look, as far as '"The Times'" is concerned, hell, they're our enemies.
I think we just oughta do it and anyway, nobody from '"The New York Times'" is to be talked to.
Alex Jones: The decision to publish '"The Pentagon Papers'
was the moment when the American news media stood up and said, '"We are independent of the presidency and we are going to do what we think is the right thing to do.'
woman: Do you feel, Mr. Sulzberger, that the national security is endangered, as charged by the administration?
I certainly do not.
these papers, I think as our editorial said this morning, were really a part of-- a part of history that should have been made available considerably longer ago, and I just didn't feel there was any breach of national security in the sense that we were giving secrets to the enemy.
reporter: Julian Assange, editor for WikiLeaks, denies that the site has put troops in danger.
reporter #2: Assange is clearly an advocate and opponent of the war.
assange made a name for himself as a hacker, and was arrested for computer crimes before starting his whistleblower website.
Julian Assange: We would like to see the revelations that this material gives investigated by governments, and new policies put in place as a result, if not prosecutions.
I gotta try Julian again, because I have not heard back from him at all.
assange: Hello?
Hi, it's Brian Stelter calling from '"The Times.'
there is a traditional definition of journalism that is objective, totally legal, never breaking the law to obtain content.
do you view yourself as trying to achieve that definition, or is your definition of journalism broader?
and tell me what the goal is. Tell me what the goal is.
I don't know whether what he"s doing is good or bad.
I mean, clearly, you know, in an open society, you know, information is, you know, is important.
it's vital for people to make decisions.
on the other hand, there are things that can get people in trouble.
the video was edited in a way that did not show the full story.
it was presented as journalism, but it had, you know, an agenda.
is '"journalist'" a word you attach to yourself?
okay.
the video has been edited to the extent that you really have a hard time knowing the greater context.
there is, there is.
so they have both, right? - They did do both, it's true.
but the unedited version clearly shows a guy carrying an RPG.
they"re shifting from being a clearinghouse to being advocacy.
it's a big decision they make to suddenly edit a 30-minute thing.
are you writing separately on this? - we are, we are.
I certainly had not heard of WikiLeaks before that moment.
and I think probably a lot of my colleagues hadn't either.
that was the time it kind of burst out into broader public view.
hey hey, did you send it? - Stelter: Oh, I saw a
there was a note in there. - Did you?
I didn"t see it from you. I'm going to open it up.
he's lying.
Oh, he didn't send it. I knew he didn't send it.
Headlam: There's two A1 meetings.
there"s the 10: 30 where we discuss the stories of the day, what we're going to offer. And there"s a 4: 00, when the top editors make that decision.
it's all the desk heads, or at least somebody from each desk.
you make your pitches and they ask questions.
then they decide what they want to put in the newspaper the next day.
you know, it's kind of a competition.
you go in there and lots of people want stories and we fight to get on A1. But it's very constructive fighting.
man: All right, folks, we're still waiting for a few people but I think we can get started. First, I think-- Bruce.
this is our follow on the video that was released yesterday on the web.
we're taking a look at WikiLeaks, which is the organization that leaked it.
I think it"s a very interesting moment for them.
they've been gaining a lot of notoriety because of the Baghdad video.
as lan pointed out, they've put up the raw footage, which is 38 minutes.
they've also put up an edited version, which is what many people are seeing, and there are already people in the army and elsewhere saying that this actually distorts what actually happened there.
and when they went to get the bodies, they found a guy with the RPG, so as Bruce was saying, it's become advocacy. Now
fisher: Somebody's, yeah. I just talked with
they probably belong in the same place.
fisher: l"m sorry? - They probably belong in one kind of coherent whole, right?
fisher: Sure. - Headlam: Yeah, right right.
Chira: In the Page-One meeting, the most senior editors
Iook at the summary of the story itself and say, '"Have you framed it correctly?
does this seem loaded? Do you have enough facts to back this up?'
and then ultimately people present their arguments pro and con and build the sides.
Oh, the West Bank story.
Hmmm.
I don't think the whole country is interested in Sharpe James.
no. - Swing Sharpe and West Bank?
west Bank's going to have a big readership here.
Yeah, I wouldn't swing that. - Swing it with WikiLeaks?
Uh-huh. - Okay, swing it with WikiLeaks.
let's leave the West Bank story.
it's going to swing, which means in New York it will go inside, but for the rest of the country it will go on the front page.
you know, you look for that moment where you can really tell people, '"Here's how the world's changing.'
Daniel Ellsberg: When I gave '"The Pentagon Papers'" to '"The Times,'
there was a 22-month period from the start of my copying to it finally coming out.
had the internet existed then,
I would have bought a scanner, sent it out to all the blogs.
it"s not certain that that would have had as good an effect, but at least it would have been out.
the bottom line is WikiLeaks doesn't need us.
Daniel Ellsberg did.
the old newspaper model is dying.
period. Done. News is not dying.
news is much cheaper to produce now because we can gather and share in new ways, operate on cheap platforms, operate in networks.
there's incredible new ways to do news.
there's no question that there is still an enormous amount of information out there, but these papers have the great capacity of a newsroom.
and if you think of the history of these institutions
Watergate, Abu Ghraib, the Walter Reed scandal
it is these institutions bringing to bear newsrooms of experienced journalists.
and I think we're at a dangerous moment in American journalism.
the question really is whether it's too late for some institutions to take advantage of that change and change as much as they have to.
so along comes David Carr, the most human of humans, talking about how media operates within '"The New York Times.'
please welcome David Carr!
you were a-- you are a former crack addict and you are a reporter for '"The New York Times.'
which of these two do you think is more damaging to society?
Carr: If you write about the media long enough, eventually you'll type your way to your own doorstep.
I arrived at '"The New York Times'" late in my professional life, and I have an immigrant's love of the place.
the chip that was implanted in me when I arrived
Iet's just call it '"New York Times"' exceptionalism
ieads me to conclude that of course we will survive.
you're so nice!
then again, having suffered through drug addiction in my 20s and 30s,
ianding in jail for cocaine possession, raising two children as a single parent, and eventually ending up at '"The New York Times,'
I know what it's like to come out the other side when the odds are stacked against you.
Hi, l'm looking for Alex.
receptionist: Sure, you can go have a seat on the couch.
huh? Okay. - He'll be right back.
Hi. - Man: This is David Carr - from '"The New York Times.'" - Nice to meet you.
don't keep saying l'm from '"The New York Times.'
that sucks. I'm just-- it's me.
lt's nice to meet you finally. - l"m David.
very nice to meet you. - Hi, pleased to meet you. How are you?
we wanted to get everyone together to do a companywide update.
the media landscape is changing in really dramatic ways in just six months. So print as an industry and a medium continues to nosedive.
publications like '"Newsweek'" and '"Times'" are going down fast.
we like to say that we're perfectly positioned.
Shane Smith: Not only are the sort of biggest media companies willing to come talk to us, but the biggest brands are wanting to come talk to us and give us money. And what we have to do is we have to figure out how we can be meaner and faster and more dynamic than everybody out there.
we don't want to get hot and die. We want to get hot and get hotter.
you asked the question is there a business model that, like
just a sec though. I want you to feel me on this:
I don't do corporate portraiture.
what the fuck is going on that you're doing business with CNN?
we know how to speak to young people.
they"re listening to us. We're a trusted brand for them.
I mean, the first thing that CNN said when they walked into the meeting last summer was, '"49-year-olds are watching CNN right now, and we're fucked. Can you please help us develop a new, young audience for the future?
they like the way you tell stories. They like your hosts.
they like where you go.'" That's really what they came looking for.
reporter: So what kind of war is this, guerrilla?
I don't know Liberia.
I don't know what's going on. I don"t pretend to.
I"m not going there for a news thing, reporting on a particular news story.
I'm not there to solve the problems of the world.
I'm just a regular guy. I didn't get flown in on a thing.
I don't have security. I don't have anything.
and l've been to some places just fuckin' insane.
if you're a CNN viewer and you go, '"Hmm,
I'm looking at human shit on the beach.'
I've got to tell you one thing: l'm a regular guy and I go to these places and I go, '"Okay, everyone talked to me about cannibalism, right?'
everyone talked to me about cannibalism. Now l"m getting a lot of shit for saying the word '"cannibalism'" and stuff-- whatever.
everyone talked to me about cannibalism!
so you'd kill the child? - Yes.
and then drink the blood? - Yeah.
that"s fucking crazy. So the actual-- our audience goes, '"That's fucking insane. Iike, that"s nuts."'
and "'The New York Times"' meanwhile is writing about surfing.
I'm sitting there going, '"You know what? I"m not going to talk about surfing.
I'm going to talk about cannibalism because that fucks me up."'
just a sec. Time out.
before you ever went there, we've had reporters there reporting on genocide after genocide.
and just because you put on a fuckin' safari helmet and went and looked at some poop doesn't give you the right to insult what we do.
so continue, continue. - Sorry.
I"m just saying that l'm not a journalist.
l'm not there to report. - Obviously. Go ahead.
I'm sorry. I'm just talking about, you know,
Iook what I saw there.
what's up?
dressed like a big Page-One guy.
how are you? - Boy, what a day.
Arango: "'The Times"' was really where I wanted to work from when I was very young.
I always had this idea of the place as this sort of magisterial place where great things happened and were done.
and there was this idea in the past where getting to '"The Times'" was almost like getting tenure.
and you could have this great long 30-year, 40-year career where you go cover politics, you cover some foreign, you maybe write a book.
and that's not the track now.
ladies and gentlemen, we are now on West 43rd Street in Midtown Manhattan in the central office of '"The New York Times.'
they are this minute busy getting ready.
this is the beehive, the central office, the city room. Here an avalanche of news is shaped into Monday morning's newspaper.
well, here we are, boys.
cooke: That is Turner Catledge. He is the managing editor.
and I just heard from the circulation department a few minutes ago that we had the largest distribution of papers today in the history of '"The New York Times.'
hard news was a phrase '"The Times'" almost owned.
nbc, CBS, ABC-- the first thing they"d do in the morning, the directors of their shows would look at "'The New York Times."'
if '"The New York Times'" had a story about such and such in a faraway place, the networks would think, '"Ah, now we'll send Walter Cronkite over there.'
david Remnick: When I was growing up I read '"The Times'" every morning.
and then I read this book by Gay Talese, '"The Kingdom and the Power,'
and it went inside this imperial institution.
and he just, you know, thrilled me.
I mean there was nothing else I wanted to do.
'the Times'was a very human institution, run by flawed figures, men who saw things as they could see them.
but it was equally true that 'The Times' nearly always tried to be fair.
and each day, barring labor strikes or hydrogen bombs, it would appear in 1 1, 464 cities around the nation and in all the capitals of the world, 50 copies going to the White House, 39 copies to Moscow, a few smuggled into Beijing, and a thick Sunday edition to the foreign minister in Taiwan, because he required 'The Times' as necessary proof of the Earth's existence, a barometer of its pressure, an assessor of its sanity.
if the world did indeed still exist, he knew it would be duly recorded each day in 'The Times. "
there's actually something called "'The New York Times"' effect.
in the world of analogue newspapers, there was an observable effect;
if on day one, '"The New York Times'" ran a piece on a particular story, a political or business issue, on day two the tier-two newspapers would all essentially imitate the story.
just like everything else in the newspaper business, we didn't realize that '"The New York Times'" effect actually depended on the structure of analogue newspaper distribution.
'"The Times'" still, I think to a remarkable degree, does set the agenda.
I mean, you really can trace almost any major story these days back to something that originally appeared in '"The Times.'
the problem is is that once it reaches the public, they may not even know it came from '"The Times.'
okay, so at 6: 00 AM the release goes out. Is that right?
Arango: So for two, three months now
I think the end of September the story leaked that Comcast was going to buy NBC.
it seems like finally it will be announced.
so the challenge is this piece l'm working on with Sorkin, which is what we call a tick-tock, which is the fun details behind the scenes of how the deal came together.
so l'm just waiting for Andrew to come up so we can sort that out, and we"ll get that in the paper tomorrow.
by the way, how's the tick-tock coming?
sorkin, l'm just waiting for him. He"s like...
has he filed anything? - No.
so that means he hasn't written a word.
I don"t know. Like at 1 1: 00, he said, '"l'll have something for you in an hour."'
so now l"m going to look like a chump if I don't hit that.
because our deal was he was going to write what he had and I was going to write into it.
do you want me to go to him and say Bruce needs to talk?
just say Bruce needs it in 1 5 minutes. - Okay.
Arango: lt's another reshaping of the media industry.
comcast, which is the biggest cable company, they look at the future and they see what's going on in media, and they worry about if young people are watching TV online, are they going to need to keep paying their cable bills forever down the road?
so they feel like, if they can own as much of the television shows and the movies, they can play a bigger part in that future, whatever that future is.
I want to talk to you.
can I wait?
you"ll come up? He's going to come up.
all right, here's the lede. '"The secret meeting'
secret-- '"The secret meeting was set for 1: 00 PM the second week of July in an out-of-the-way condominium along the ninth hole of the golf course in Sun Valley, ldaho.
jeffrey lmmelt got to the condo first, trying desperately to avoid being spotted by Jeff Zucker, the chief executive NBC Universal who was mingling with other executives in front of the duck pond only a couple hundred yards away and had no idea what was happening.'
okay, anyway, here's the story. I"m calling GE now.
okay. - So l'm hoping you can like...
sort of maybe tie it together. -...tie it together.
because it's basically just all these little weird stories.
and I tried to tie it and leave little places to...
then how would... - It works out for Comcast if the thing becomes worth a lot of money in the future.
Arango: Okay. - Sorkin: That's basically the concept.
all right. How many words do you think we have for this? It's very long.
you think you can do it in 1 500? - Arango: Yeah.
is it looking good? Are you happy? - Arango: Yeah.
I mean some of this may just be too much detail, by the way.
I went a little overboard. - Yeah no, l'm tightening it up.
he said we have 1 500 words. - This thing's like 1 500 words now.
no no, he said we could have 1 500.
I'll check and tell you if it"s different.
I've gotta make sure we got the space.
Headlam: Sorkin have a look? - Arango: Sorkin just emailed me and said file away, but said don't put it on the web yet, because he still needs to confirm something.
Arango: Once we could pare it down and tighten it up,
I think it read well. It tried to tell a tale rather than get bogged down in the financials and the numbers.
here was this kid, 21 -year-old Brian Stelter, who started a blog, who did it anonymously so no one would out him, until '"The New York Times'" outed him as a mere kid.
he made his brand and his reputation by just getting out there and blogging.
Arango: You know, he became this sort of must-read for the Brian Williamses of the world.
and I think '"The Times'" had the idea, '"Why don't we hire this guy?'
Stelter: A week after that story was published, '"The Times'" contacted me and asked me to come up and do these series of interviews back to back to back with editors, seeing if you're '"Times'" material, I guess.
Arango: You see him at his desk and he's got two laptops and TVs open and he's Twittering, and he just embodies everything about new media.
I don"t know why anybody who's a reporter isn't on Twitter.
I constantly berate my colleagues who aren't on it.
it drives me nuts when l'll hear my colleagues talking about a story at noon, and I read it on Twitter at midnight.
I'm thinking to myself, '"Why is that allowed?'
you know, "'why are we not on top of the news?'" lt's 201 0.
I still can't get over the feeling that Brian Stelter was a robot assembled in the basement of "'The New York Times"' to come and destroy me.
here's an entertaining tip:
I'm putting the expensive beer on the top.
Carr: welcome to Austin, the city where for the time being everybody is famous, the economy is rocking and the grid is groaning under an influx of the digitally interested.
I might have to put you on ban. - No, I agree, I agree.
I might have to put you on ban.
you're both going to end up with your devices over the fence.
Carr: Twitter entered the lexicon two years ago here, when it was the darling of the conference.
why talk when you can tweet?
you"re reading an article. If you want to tweet about it or if you want to follow the columnist, you can do it right there.
headlines can be sent out via Twitter.
it's about finding out what's happening in the world that you care about.
really, what could anyone possibly find useful in this cacophony of short-burst communication?
but at 52, I succumbed, partly out of professional necessity.
now nearly a year later, has Twitter turned my brain to mush? No.
it's hard to convince someone that they should use Twitter until you get them on it and they use if for 1 0 days and they"re like, '"Oh, this is why it's interesting.'
l'm a narrative on more things at a given moment than I ever thought possible.
see how many people just now...
I get a sense of today's news and how people are reacting to it in the time it takes to wait for a coffee at Starbucks.
nearly a year in, l've come to understand that the real value of the service is Iistening to a wired collective voice.
the medium's not the message.
the messages are the media.
man: Bruce? - Headlam: We're always looking for ways to show how cutbacks across the media business has affected coverage.
and Brian Stelter has come up with an unlikely one, which is coverage of the President of the United States.
when Obama travels to Buffalo today, there won't be a charter plane traveling with him because many of the networks have simply opted out of taking that very expensive ride, and the reason is simply cost.
uh, we'll call it '"press.'
Oh good, my sources are starting to come out.
they're starting to wake up.
it's job number one, of course, for every DC bureau to follow the president and to travel with him on trips both foreign and domestic.
but lately there's been fewer and fewer of these White House planes that go with President Obama to events.
these guys are trying every day to save every dollar they can.
it's a demonstration of networks trying to do more with less.
or just accepting you can only do less.
sometimes that's the answer-- is just doing less.
is it 1, 500 people on staff right now? 1400.
are you confirming that 300 and 400 number that's out there?
abc's laying off 400 people. CBS laid off 90 a few weeks ago.
God, that is stunning.
20 to 25% of the staff they're trying to cut.
they're not just there to make sure the president doesn"t choke on a chicken bone.
they're also there to corner people for interviews in a way they couldn't otherwise.
I think the other thing you have to do is nod to what this is going to mean for coverage in the next few campaigns. In the last election, because they couldn't afford to send out regular reporters, they were sending out 24-year-olds with video cameras.
they were capturing all kinds of things.
somebody fell asleep and it never would have been caught if they didn't have some kid with a video camera who was bored and filming everything.
Stelter: He's not going to make news today, no.
Headlam: No, the last president who made news in Buffalo got shot.
wasn't it McKinley?
let's not put that one in the paper.
this is what it is at this point:
how do you cover the president on the cheap?
we've looked at every, I think, conceivable model all the way from, you know, philanthropic, you know, could you find a generous foundation that wants to underwrite "'The New York Times"' to memberships.
that's an extraordinary thing. I mean, it used to be that newspapers almost gave themselves away.
I mean, they charged far less than the cost of printing the newspaper, and they made up the difference in advertising.
mcquivey: The newspaper industry didn"t see Monster. com taking the jobs portion away. They didn"t see
craigslist taking the classifieds portion away.
they didn't see Ford and GM making their own websites to take automotive advertising basically away forever.
keller: We are now in the middle of a really unsettling time.
the real question is whether newspaper advertising will ever return at the same level.
Perez-Pena: Like a lot of companies in the industry, this one found itself scrambling for its cash position.
the company borrowed $250 million from Carlos Slim and executed a sale-leaseback of the building, which is essentially like mortgaging the building.
nobody wanted to make any predictions, because all the predictions they had been making had been so badly wrong.
nobody was pessimistic enough.
there was just this sort of decades of organizational hubris about, you know, our own excellence and our own dominance.
and then in a matter of, like, 18 months, all of a sudden there was-- the air ionized the situat
and everybody started like asking a question:
could '"The New York Times,'" like, go out of business?
'the New York Times,"' which is trading for three bucks
a Sunday newspaper costs more than a share of '"New York Times'" stock.
there has been, since the famous '"Atlantic,'" you know, '"Monthly'" story, there has been open talk of '"What if 'The Times' were to go away?'
Hirschorn: You know, I don't pretend to be a seasoned business reporter, but certainly looking at the numbers, it did seem as if they were in some peril and that there certainly was a scenario in which if they didn't act fast, that '"The Times'" could go into bankruptcy.
and so that's what I wrote.
I thought, '"You horse's ass.'" I thought, you know, '"You don't know what you're talking about. You really don't.'
I mean, I thought that that kind of article, for that to appear in '"The Atlantic,'
I thought that was just so stupid of '"The Atlantic.'
I was actually pretty stunned at the reaction that piece had.
I just-- I didn't-- I genuinely didn't expect that people would be so shocked by it, because it felt sort of obvious to me.
please. I mean this is '"The New York Times'" we're talking about, and I think that that kind of an article was both-- I found it just dumb.
there's a collective denial about what is going on and that newspapers are somehow special and somehow they're public trusts and that they shouldn't fail, and so therefore they won't fail.
and I think the disconnect between "'shouldn"t fail"' and "'can"t fail"' is the thing that l'm trying to, like, really blow up.
'"End Times'" is good. It's great.
people have been arguing that '"The New York Times'
should be put out of business ever since there was one.
so it's an old question, but one that has a great deal of salience for people.
they like it.
I don"t think it"s an argument that will be very easily made, and if it is, l'll vaporize whoever's making it.
Copeland: l"d like to note that none of us are economists.
we're here not to talk about whether '"The Times'" is a viable institution or not, talk about CPMs or prices on advertising.
we're here to talk about what would happen if '"The New York Times'" disappeared.
how many of you would be happy if '"The Times'" disappeared?
okay, so we have a sprinkling of hands.
we have probably 1 0 people voted for that.
and then how many of you would be disappointed or upset?
okay, wow. So Markos, l'm going to go to you first.
if '"The Times'" ceased to exist, how would you feel about it?
I think there's a perception that a lot of people like me who are writing online cheer the demise of traditional media outlets like '"The New York Times.'
but people like me just want traditional media outlets
Iike '"The New York Times'" to do their jobs, to do what they're supposed to do.
'"The New York Times'" helped cheerlead our way into the war in lraq with Judith Miller.
I think a lot of the decline in these traditional media outlets is because people have lost faith that those publications don"t have ulterior motives or agendas.
people like me, I have an agenda, and l"m very clear about it.
but '"The New York Times,'" they try to be something better than that
that's great, Markos, but here"s the thing:
when you"re making an argument about how we're always falling down on the job, you're reaching back through five years of really important, good hard reporting.
we're on the ground in Afghanistan. we"re on the ground in lraq.
I'm not implying that it's bad work.
I'm saying that to claim that because you're with '"The New York Times'
you have to be taken seriously, I think that"s dangerous.
it"s that sort of implied credibility that '"The New York Times'" brings, and that's how Judith Miller got away with her war
pre-war coverage that helped get us into this war.
it's because she works for '"The New York Times,'" so she has to be credible.
reporter: Judy Miller reported, quote...
reporter #2: '"The New York Times'" carried the unsubstantiated claims of those, including...
reporter #3: On the front page of the nation's paper of record, '"The Times'" reported that Saddam Hussein had launched a...
weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass destruction.
'"The Times'" had reporters who were very much vulnerable.
there"s a story in '"The New York Times'" this morning...
we read in '"The New York Times'" today a story that says that Saddam Hussein is closer...
they were trying to acquire certain high quality...
reporter #4: The Bush administration was helped by the nation's leading newspaper, "'The New York Times."'
reporter #5: If '"The New York Times'" thinks Saddam is on the precipice of mushroom clouds, then there is really no debate.
Seth Mnookin: Judy Miller was someone who was let loose on this story, and there were not people there who were given the power to rein her in, and she clearly needed to be reined in.
do you accept that your reporting was wrong?
Absolutely. The handful of stories
about six or seven of them
that I did before the war were wrong, and the intelligence information that I was accurately reporting was wrong.
I guess if your sources are wrong, you're going to be wrong.
but to say you got it wrong when your sources were wrong, that, as your colleagues at '"The New York Times'" have said, reduces your role as a journalist to no more than a stenographer.
no, on the contrary, I really reject that criticism.
we made errors in our coverage of the weapons of mass destruction.
we made them at the reporting level and at the editing level.
does she tell the truth?
'"The New York Times'" can"t have a reporter
and we don't.
anytime '"The Times'" fails on a serious scale on a particular story, a big story, there's a cost.
there's a price to pay.
and certainly in recent years, you've heard people say, '"Well, I no longer need 'The Times.' I can no longer trust 'The Times. "
one more Jayson Blair or one more Judy Miller and you're chipping away at this institution that everyone is sort of desperate to protect.
I think kind of until Jayson Blair, they were kind of impervious. They were Teflon.
the Jayson Blair incident was a real scandalous occasion.
the reporter was found to be reporting stories at places where he was not actually there, though the dateline would give indication that he was there, taking stories and not even rewriting them written by other people at other newspapers.
Mnookin: He eventually got caught because he plagiarized a story from someone who had previously been a colleague of his at '"The Times.'
not only does he take and wind a rope around his neck and, like, go jumping off a cliff, you know, right in plain sight, but he ties it to our feet and tries to pull us off the cliff with him.
the minute they put it on the front page in that little box
I still remember the day it came out-- Raines"s reign was over.
Raines: This system is not set up to catch someone who sets out to lie and to use every means at his or her disposal to put false information into the paper.
Mnookin: You went from having Howell being the most successful editor, not just in the history of "'The Times,"'in the history of newspapering, to his being fired.
I'm delighted to announce Bill Keller as our next executive editor.
I'm aiming to raise our ambitions higher than they've ever been.
when Bill came in, he was all about restoring trust after Howell Raines.
he was supposed to sort of get the ship back on course.
it just wasn't in the conversation that, you know, there was going to be an economic crisis in journalism.
and that"s been the dominant event,
I think if you asked him, on his watch.
reporter: Darker times are ahead for the '"Grey Lady.'
'"The Times'" will resort to layoffs.
the paper is looking to cut 1 00 jobs from its news staff by the end of the week.
we're hearing that the layoffs are beginning today.
we now know how many people have opted to go voluntarily, which means we know how many people we have to layoff.
in the immediate moment, we're in the middle of cutting 1 00 people out of a staff of roughly 1 250.
we"ve spent a lot of time in the last couple of weeks going over lists, trying to prioritize based on skills we can afford to lose.
we are not a specialized newspaper, we"re a general-interest newspaper.
and we try to be excellent at everything from foreign coverage to education coverage to arts to sports.
you know, we're large, but there's not a lot of slack in the system.
I feel some days that, you know, we should be symbolically wearing, you know, bloody butchers" smocks or something around the newsroom.
it's such a kind of grim undertaking.
Ray: I was hired in 1 977.
when I was trying to get this job, a job-getting focus group asked me to write my own obituary.
and since then, l've been the deputy editor of obituaries.
Hey, it"s Claiborne Ray, the departing retiring person.
should I come down through the freight elevator or through the regular passenger elevator?
I came with the high hopes of staying for one year.
I've overstayed that by 20 years.
Headlam: We have to dump bodies overboard.
they don't really have any choice.
we all got the packets in the mail.
there's something obviously dispiriting about getting a packet in the mail that invites you to leave your job.
I almost feel like I don't know of everything that's going on and I almost feel like I don't have a clear grasp on the enormity of the situation.
Katherine Boulton: I decided not to press my luck.
nobody knows if there'll be a paper on paper in another five years.
everybody is unbelievably pressured to do more than people are really humanly able to do.
I'm sorry to leave '"The Times.'
there are a lot of unemployed people out there, a lot of underemployed people and a lot of scared people.
and I have to remind myself every day that l'm one of the lucky ones.
the main effect is just this insecurity that pervades the newspaper business.
the mood is so funereal.
for those of us who work in media,
Iife is a drumbeat of goodbye speeches with sheet cakes and cheap sparkling wine.
that carnage has left behind an island of misfit toys,
Iike model trains whose cabooses have square wheels.
sure, l"ve been fired in my day, but always after
I'd failed to show up at work like a normal person.
'go to treatment,"' my editor at the magazine in Minneapolis would tell me.
'"There's a bed waiting for you.'
but at the tender age of 31,
I still had a year left before hitting rock bottom, a year left of being that guy, the violent drug-snorting thug, before I found my way to this guy, the one with a family and a job at "'The New York Times."'
one day I came over from '"The Twin Cities Reader'" where I worked, came over here to the Skyway Lounge and met my friend Phil.
Phil gave me a film canister full of coke, and I was going to get a gram. I went into the bathroom, the cop hit the stall door that I was in and said, '"You roll a noisy joint, pal.'
and he immediately put me up against the wall and then walked me down the street this way and up the block toward Nicollet Mall where his car was parked.
the interesting thing about that is that my father worked right in City Center, so I was being crabwalked in handcuffs past the shopping，the downtown shopping center where my father worked.
it was another life.
it was another guy.
it's that guy.
look, l'm afraid of guns and l'm afraid of bats.
I'm really not afraid of anything else.
it's an advantage of having lived a textured life.
I've been a single parent on welfare. This is nothing.
I was talking to John Hume and he said, '"Look, you didn't go to Afghanistan.
you didn"t turn into the great city-hall columnist.
you didn"t set out to be a media reporter, but you are.
and your story has arrived and it behooves you to man up, show some sack and cover it until it's done.'
and I thought, '"You know what? That"s what l"m going to do."'
welcome, everyone, to another debate from '"lntelligence Squared.'
we'll be debating this motion:
good riddance to the mainstream media.
there will be winners and losers tonight, and you the audience will be our judges.
I work at '"The New York Times.'
we have 1 7 million people that come to our website.
we put out 1 00 videos every month. We have 80 blogs.
we are fully engaged in the revolution.
'"The New York Times'" has dozens of bureaus all over the world, and we're going to toss that out-- which is the proposition
toss that out and kick back and see what Facebook turns up.
I don't think so.
what you're going to hear tonight is that the media is necessary for the commonweal.
an informed citizenry is what this nation is about.
that is self-serving crap.
'"The New York Times'" is a good newspaper
sometimes. '"The Washington Post'" is a good newspaper.
the '"LA Times,'" before it became a bad newspaper, was a good newspaper.
but after that, it's off the cliff.
it's oblivion. The news business in this country is nothing to be proud of.
the media is a technology business.
that's what is. That's what it has always been.
technology changes, the media changes.
over time, the audience has switched to the web.
the audience that"s worth a buck in print is worth a dime and sometimes a penny on the web, because we end up competing oftentimes against our own work aggregated.
'"Newser'" is a great-looking site and you might want to check it out.
aggregates all manner of content.
but I wonder if Michael's really thought through get rid of mainstream media content.
okay.
go ahead.
Remnick: There are a lot of websites, the core of their being very often-- not all of them, but some is repurposed pieces by '"The Times'
with a sexier headline or a bigger picture or bouncing off of '"Times'" reporting, commenting on '"Times'" reporting.
places like "'Gawker,"' they're going for what will feed that Google-beast algorithm.
they'll go to feed the hits.
and how we build a really rich media environment where you don't lose coverage of statehouses, of Congress is a question.
the big board is anathema to anyone at '"The Times'
or any other traditional daily newspaper.
it's a list of 1 0 stories from our sites on a big television screen, which are at that very moment getting the most buzz, being distributed and passed around on the web.
it's our equivalent of the front page.
it's the most visible manifestation of a writer"s success.
we've always been very much focused on stories that our readers want.
we're not trying to force-feed them.
we"re trying to give them what they want.
I have a friend who's at the Albany bureau of '"The Times.'" I told him about the big board, sent him a picture of it and "'How do you like our new innovation?'
he was terrified. Albany corruption stories
they may be important to cover, but no one really wants to read them.
the future is to be found elsewhere.
it's a linked economy.
it's online advertising. It's citizen journalism, and if you can't find your way to that, then you just can't find your way.
there's nobody covering the cop shop, nobody covering the zoning board.
the day I run into a '"Huffington Post'" reporter at a Baltimore zoning board hearing is the day that I will
senator Kerry, I was not around when the printing press was invented, but if I were around, I would imagine that the people dealing with stone tablets would be making a similar argument.
there's no way that I can think of that you can have a '"business model'
you know, one that makes a profit
for investigative reporting.
vanden Heuvel: ProPublica-- a very interesting model.
part of its formula is pairing with legacy media to get its information out in the most effective way.
Steiger: Everything we do goes on our website.
but for our biggest stories, we get a CNN, a '"60 Minutes,'" a '"New York Times'to work with us.
you know, I was 25, 26 years at "'The Journal."'
we were absolutely rolling in money.
why should you open yourself to some story that you didn't know where it had been?
who knows what kind of germs that had gotten on it?
people are open to new ways of working, because the world has changed.
vanden Heuvel: There's a hybrid model here, and I do think journalism is a public good.
and if it's a public good, then that requires a whole new mindset about how you support journalism.
1, 000 bloggers all talking to each other doesn't get you a report from a war zone.
somebody's gotta take a real risk.
there's gotta be some infrastructure and some pay, and they"ve gotta go and gather that news originally.
Arango: A lot of the people in the Baghdad bureau were moving to Kabul. And they asked if there was anybody who wanted to volunteer for Baghdad, and so l'm going to lraq.
Headlam: He's done all these stories on media companies and, you know, capital cases and death row.
and Tim is just one of the guys who wants answers to really basic questions. And I think once you've got that you're curious about all kinds of things.
Arango: lraq is kind of off people's radar screens here, but we still have 1 20, 000 soldiers there and it's a real crucial point in terms of seeing what the last chapter is for our country there.
Headlam: The locals who have worked for us, some have been killed and kidnapped and-- and
Yeah, I worry about that.
but that's something he wants to do and...
you know, kind of just hope he'll be okay.
Cheers, to your good health.
did they tell you what they want you to do?
I mean, there's no beats.
it"s just do the day's stories and settle in with the lraqi staff and write stories, you know.
for the beginning, it's going to be the election.
you had covered a bunch of other conflicts, right?
civil wars and conflicts in Africa.
somalia-- a lot of time in Somalia.
I did a tour in Yugoslavia when all that was going on.
Oh really? The only advice they give is fall into this well-run machine that's been going on for seven years and you"ll figure it out.
as you may well know, I expect you to be on TV in a week
'"Those of us who have been covering this for a while."'
'"Those of us who have been here for two days think...'
it's been a privilege to work with you. Come back real soon.
thanks for the kind words. - People: Cheers!
man: Stay safe.
it is a history. It is an enormous compendium of material that will affect many different people in different ways.
there has been a massive leak.
there are so many pages of military secrets now public.
some of the documents rip the cover off the US-led war effort in Afghanistan:
unexplained American deaths, questionable battlefield tactics and a mission just not going that well.
reporter: wikileaks released 91, 000 raw military documents online, but this time also to three traditional news organizations including '"The New York Times,'" which vetted the material, it said, eliminating information that could put lives at risk.
well, I think it was an important moment that WikiLeaks chose to go through the '"Guardian, " Der Spiegel"' and '"The New York Times.'
in a sense they were detoxifying the information that they had, and they were giving it a little more veracity.
what Julian Assange realized is that going through '"The Times'
and '"Spiegel'" and the '"Guardian'
would actually have a greater impact. He was right.
we as a journalistic group
the four media groups who worked on this have really only just scratched the surface.
we"ve treated them as an advocacy organization, but we're partnered with them.
are we partnered?
I think they're a source.
but they're a publisher. - I think they're more like a source than-- well, you're right.
he's not our media partner. He"s not our collaborator.
he's a source like any other source giving us access to documents.
they can be a source when they"re a publisher. I think that's very clear.
we"re all in this together. - But you wonder about the negotiations, when they come and say, "'You can have this, but we're going to give it to other papers, and you guys are all going to hold hands.'" Where we say, '"But we are 'The New York Times, " " and they say, '"But we have all this and we are dictating terms.'
you can say that. And then can you turn around and say, '"By the way, 'The New York Times' never should have done this in the first place'"?
I really am appalled by the leak, condemn the leak.
there is potential there to put American lives at risk.
do you believe there should be an investigation into whether '"The New York Times'" broke any laws?
I'm not calling for prosecution of '"The Times,'
but I think they're guilty of bad citizenship.
keller: The basic calculus that you try to do in your head is the trade-off between the obligation, really, to give people information about how they're being governed and on the other hand, the government"s Iegitimate need for secrecy.
I've had a dozen of these instances where we had classified information and had to decide whether or not to publish it or publish it with some parts of it withheld.
officials at the White House asked us to communicate to wikileaks their strong exhortation that wikileaks redact the documents and take out the names of people who might be identified and put in danger. And we passed that along.
the oddest thing in the story, you saw, was that '"The Times'" said that the White House asked them to lobby WikiLeaks not to print things.
Headlam: Yes. - Which is really odd.
like, '"You're the White House. Can"t you call wikileaks?"'
but also we're '"The New York Times'"-- - '"lt's 1 -800-WikiLeaks.'
reporter: The supposedly private cables detail everything from security threats to diplomatic dirty laundry.
there are unflattering views of key allies.
reporter #2: lt's the largest release of diplomatic correspondence ever.
reporter #3:...from highly encrypted telegrams to email messages to raw, unfiltered analysis from embassies and consulates.
keller: l'm still getting messages from people who think that
I'm a treasonous son of a bitch.
and l'm getting some from people who think that Julian Assange is the messiah and why did I not treat him as such?
many of the media outlets who had been partnered with WikiLeaks now find themselves trying to figure out whether this guy is a villain or a hero.
it would be great if people got past the debate over WikiLeaks and the disclosures, and looked closely at what these are, which is a real-time history of the US relationship with some very important countries.
it is one of the biggest journalistic scoops in the past 30 years.
and the fact that '"The Times'" made it their front page for weeks shows that, even as all these papers are becoming a shadow of their former selves, '"The Times'" is still in the game and very much leading the game at this point.
Cohen: Maybe newspapers are going to have to supplement using WikiLeaks to get their news.
it's unclear what the model is, but I think it"s a sign though of openness at the paper that there are many more sources.
in a lot of ways it's a very positive step, even though it definitely is coming at the cost of a contracting traditional newsroom.
like the Chinese say, it's a very interesting time.
it's kind of a curse, but it's also a blessing that we live in interesting times-- especially if you're a journalist.
you should want there to be interesting things going on, even if it is also a curse.
'"New York Times.'
get your '"New York Times'"!
come on, check it out. Check it out.
good morning, '"New York Times'"?
'"New York Times,'" $2.
'the New York Times"' announced today that it's going to start charging for access to its website.
the system they're going to adopt says anybody who comes to the site who's not a paying subscriber can look at X number of articles free, and then when you reach X+1 you'll get a message saying if you want to keep going, you've got to pay.
the design of '"The Times'" paywall comes this close to the NPR model, which is to go to the people who care most about '"The Times'
and say, '"You and us, we're partners.
we're keeping this thing afloat.'
Perez-Pena: "'As of today you've lost a daily reader.
if they start charging, l'll change this away from my homepage."'
this was a college friend of mine:
'l want to pay, but l'm not willing to pay for information I can easily find elsewhere.
sorry, 'New York Times.' Freedom of information.'
I worry about people like that who have grown up in that era where everything was free, or everything seemed free. It's never free, but...
the economics of this business have always been that it required both advertising and payment from the reader.
and for the last 1 5 years on the internet, we've sort of pretended
this is the end of pretending.
they find it through you. They click through through you.
they come up with the story, which is currently free.
so they're still not getting paid for it.
there's usually advertisements on the page when they land there.
in many cases, I don't think they're getting that advertising revenue, and it certainly isn't covering the cost of doing business.
my view is that it's still very early and that
Kerry: when you say it"s early, it's not early for '"The Denver Post'
or '"The Seattle lntelligencer'" or a bunch of folks who are facing bankruptcy today.
information historically was not free.
you had to pay for it in one way or another.
I think what '"The Times'" says-- '"This is what it's worth to read our newspaper every month'
will go a long way to establishing what people feel they can charge or maybe what they can't charge.
it's actually kind of a big day in the newspaper business.
and some people may date this, you know, this is the day the whole thing died. We'll find out.
people who make prescriptions
'"They should go do a paywall; not do a paywall;
put it all on iPad; kill the paper product'
they're being naive. They have no idea about the economics of running a legacy print-newspaper business and trying to build an online news business.
you better hope they figure it out, because you got like 40 years to go.
whereas if we got our heads chopped off, we only have to figure out, what, 15 more years?
Oh, fuck that.
I think I got a lot longer to go than that.
Really? - My working life or my life life?
how old are you? - 46.
Somebody"s going to tap you on the shoulder here at 62, 63, and say, '"That was great.
thanks a lot. Your sheet cake's over there.'
Stelter: '"Turn in your tablet.'" - Turn in your tablet.
we call it...
rupert Murdoch: I got a glimpse of the future this last weekend with the iPad.
it may well be, you know, the saving of the newspaper industry.
Marvin Kalb: And even if the cost is the end of newspapers as we know it
well, it's better than them going out of business altogether.
Headlam: Why are media companies so excited about a tablet?
well, they see it as a do-over, they see it as this, they see it as that.
and then the question becomes, well yeah, there's lots of people who think Apple saved the music business.
they didn"t save it on the music business's terms.
there's lots of people in the music business saying it's incredibly punishing dealing with those guys.
like, '"Oh yeah, they're my best friend.
see this? It"s a leash."' What makes anybody think that's going to be different for publishers?
that's why l'm wondering if we're going to end up screwing ourselves.
1 64 and 232.
one per buyer.
it's just amazing to be able to cover this, 'cause I think in five years this could be, like, how computers are.
but it's a little bit scary down there, actually.
I'm walking out and people are like '"Congratulations!'
and it"s like I just had a kid or I just had twins or something.
you know, I just bought a-- I just bought a computer.
is that a bridge to the future?
or-- oh wait, it's a gallows!
Ow!
right there is the dream come true.
let's see you navigate. Mm, sweet.
that is a great reading experience right there.
you know what it reminds me of?
Stelter: what? - A newspaper.
people including me are probably silly to think, you know,
steve Jobs is riding over the hill like cavalry to save the media industry.
he's driving Apple's stock price.
and we may have business in common.
and what that Venn diagram of interests is their interests versus our interests
that's sort of where the story is.
I have a lot of great background conversations, but l've got to move people onto the record.
think of what you might be able to say to me.
all right, man. Thanks. Bye-bye.
you know, you could say being at '"The New York Times'" is a big advantage.
you know, it kinda scares people when you call them.
and I also think I sound sort of weird on the phone.
and it's like
well, do you have time to talk to me?
great.
um, how long did you work at the "'Trib"'?
it's a big story that hasn't really been told in this kind of comprehensive way
the biggest media bankruptcy in history, billions and billions of dollars just evaporated, a lot of people lost their jobs.
the people there are still doing, you know, excellent work, but it's under very difficult circumstances from people who manifestly do not respect what they do.
Headlam: Sam Zell, when he came in, was somebody with no experience running a company like this.
no news experience. In fact, a fair bit of contempt for sort of traditional ideas of journalism.
my attitude on journalism is very simple:
I want to make enough money so I can afford you.
it"s really that simple, okay? You need to in effect help me by being a journalist that focuses on what our readers want.
I'm sorry, l'm sorry.
I can't, you know, you're giving me the classic what I would call journalistic arrogance.
you know, people inside just sort of get dispirited because the company's being run by these people who just don't share their values.
hopefully we get to the point where our revenue is so significant that we can do puppies and lraq, okay?
Headlam: Sam Zell wanted to put Randy Michaels, whom he knew from the radio business, in charge of Tribune Company.
Michaels then came in and one of the first things he worked on was rewriting the company's ethics policy to basically say, "'we"re going to be in a much more permissive atmosphere'
and you know, '"lt's going to be creative and there"s going to be things that offend you.'
you know what"s important to the people who buy advertising?
I don't mean the agencies. I mean the people who write the checks.
they want to sell widgets. They want to move product.
they want the cash register to ring. They want butts in seats.
some people are like, "'we need something, so this could be as good as any.'" I mean, it's a kind of...
you know, it"s a sort of crazy Hail Mary pass.
so these guys come in, bought the company.
this is how they behaved. This is the result.
this company, they drove it into bankruptcy.
Randy Michaels and a hand-picked crew of 20 people who he's known a long long time have extracted something like $1 00 million in bonuses.
you could call that incentives or you could call that looting, depending on your perspective.
Yeah, let's just quit typing altogether and just talk us girls for a minute.
I have certain memos about behavior of the executives there, and I just want to make sure that they"re true.
in this memo that was sent to the board, there's an incident described where Randy Michaels "'talked openly and loudly about other women's breasts, sex toys...
not just in closed room with other executives but openly...
he wrote the employee handbook so that kind of talk wasn"t against the rules."' Does that all sound right?
I was mostly doing the bankruptcy stuff, and then I saw those poker pictures and I thought it seems more like a radio station in the 1 970s than a great big media company.
don't you think that would sell?
so I cold called a person from Trib Co. and he lays them out flat:
who they were, what they did, et cetera.
all on the record. My first of that. - Yeah.
I"m doing two more weeks of reporting, then l'm going to take a week to write it and show it to you.
all right.
Stelter: Tonight at 6: 30, NBC will be driving in the convoy with the last combat troops as they cross back into Kuwait.
I don't think we know much about it. we"re not on the embed, partly because we think it's a PR stunt.
what do you make of the notion that they're trying to choreograph an exit here?
in my mind it would be easy just to fly these trucks out.
they've been flying trucks out for months.
but the fact that they want to drive across the desert and bring reporters along with them, what does that indicate to you?
that's perfect.
man: So let's get started, please, with media.
Headlam: The final fighting brigade in the war is going to be crossing the border into Kuwait, as I understand it, and there's embeds with
'"The Washington Post'" is there, the '"LA Times,'" NBC.
and we're watching to see if this is some sort of end of the war as we know it.
but it's complicated.
if this is just some sort of photo op
I get no sense that this is coming from the administration or that it's coming from, you know, the military.
it just seems to be...
so far I get the sense it's only coming from NBC and the other embeds.
okay, now what we won"t be able to predict, obviously, is what '"The Post'" and the '"LA Times'" will be doing with it.
keller: Right, but you know.
is anybody, is the White House, is the military
who is saying this is the end of combat troops in lraq?
nbc is saying that the military will say that.
they are saying-- NBC is saying they will declare it.
in other words, NBC will declare it tonight. NBC's implication is
as far as I know, NBC isn't actually at war at Middle East
I know, I know. I understand.
but how come, if people know this is coming
and that's why the White House sent their email.
have I seen this anywhere? - No, it's under embargo.
it's totally secret. We're not allowed to talk about it, that"s why.
when does the embargo break? - Hopefully 6: 30.
good evening. It's gone on longer than the Civil War,
Ionger than World War ll.
tonight, US combat troops are pulling out of lraq.
and, Richard, I understand your reporting of this at this hour tonight constitutes the official Pentagon announcement, correct?
richard: Yes it is. Right now we are with the last American combat troops.
we are with the
did you watch NBC? - Yeah.
I thought it was hallucinatory. Brian williams says to Richard Engel that your report here from the field amounts to the official Pentagon announcement of the end of combat troops in lraq.
and there is no Pentagon announcement.
I mean l'm going over territory you already know.
but let me back up. We're trying to figure out if...
I don"t know that there was-- I mean, l'm not trying to be difficult.
no no no. - Was there some sort of official--?
thom Shanker in washington is right now calling the Pentagon again.
if I weren't thinking about this every day, I would look at this and think, '"What just happened?'
I mean... - Headlam: You would think, - is the war over and I missed it? - Strum: Yeah.
fisher: So we just heard from Shanker, who talked to the Pentagon five minutes ago, and he said there was no official anything today.
what the fuck's going on?
joseph Kahn: If you were watching '"NBC Nightly News,'
you would have thought there was a big ceremony of some kind to commemorate the final end of combat operations.
Strum: I was flabbergasted by it because I didn"t understand.
that's news to the Pentagon. - Hi, it's lan.
did Thom specifically ask the Pentagon guy, '"Did you see NBC?'
this is making everyone here completely insane.
Iook, I mean we could do the there-was-a-made-for-TV moment.
I don't know whether we even need to...
I'll leave that to you.
but l'm not sure it even wants to turn the knife a little bit.
the Pentagon or somebody's calling this mission
that is the mission to drive across the border-- '"The Last Patrol.'
so there's something going on.
right? - Strum: Right.
fisher: The White House has been fucking saying it's at the end of the month.
'the white House spokesman immediately sent out a second email saying it's at the end of the month.'
how do you cover the end of a war that's not ending?
fisher: Right, exactly. - I mean, even wars that end badly end up with, like, helicopters leaving the Saigon roof.
this isn't even going to be that.
I think that story should be written.
I do. I think you're right.
I don"t think tonight is the night to write it.
Headlam: let me start to get something ready and let's talk again in half an hour.
so I think we're all standing around trying to figure out whether this is a real story or a media story, which doesn"t really... isn"t very flattering to media reporters, is it?
'"Stand down, we think it's actually something happening.'
no, we're not going to write anything.
there's still 56, 000 in lraq, and the AP notes correctly that all of them are combat troops until they're redesignated otherwise, which hasn't actually happened.
I'm only wondering if are our betters going to come in tomorrow and say, '"Gee, everybody covered this but us?'
uh, there appears to be no indication that way.
all right. Good.
so I think we're all right.
Headlam: l"m going to wear my combat helmet just in case.
Carl Bernstein: The function of reporting and the press is the best obtainable version of the truth.
we're not out there to bring down governments.
we're not out there to be prosecutors.
we're out there to be judicious, not judicial.
and that's really what happened in Watergate.
richard Nixon: In recent months, members of my administration have been charged with involvement in what has come to be known as the Watergate Affair.
we began covering the Watergate story the day after there was a break-in at Democratic headquarters, and we continued to cover it for more than two years.
in the first year, we wrote more than 1 00 stories.
Remnick: The story was not one dam breaking.
it was story after story after story, and it was really pretty much owned by '"The Washington Post.'
reporter: In the House of Representatives, there is not a member left who thinks the president will not be impeached.
it really pains me to say it. I grew up with '"The Washington Post,'
and you can't say that the diminishment of that paper, in terms of its scale of its staff and its ambitions, haven't affected it.
you"d be kidding yourself to say it's just trimmed some fat.
no, economic circumstances have made it a lesser paper.
if that were to happen in any serious way to "'The New York Times,"' that would be a terrible tragedy.
keller: You know, I get the Twitter feeds and read the blogs about how media will or won't fare in the digital age.
but sometimes they seem to have it all boiled down to an aphorism.
I'm not sure that I can boil it all down to a sort of "'aha."'
but I do think there's a growing sense of how much it would matter if "'The Times"' weren"t here.
news organizations that deploy resources to really gather information are essential to a functioning democracy.
it just doesn't work if people don't know.
when you read '"The New York Times'" today, in the business section you will see the obituary of the newspaper industry.
Jesus, what a bunch of pussies!
I'm not a newspaper guy.
I'm a businessman.
lt's really important to remember that the consequences of this bankruptcy did not just fall on the employees at the Tribune Company.
in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in Hartford, in Baltimore, the diminution of those newspapers crippled or destroyed important community civic assets.
well yeah, it's going to be a pretty community civic assets story, and I want it to be, uh-- fair, which is why l'm calling you.
I mean if you want me to characterize the overall story, what I would say is that this was an overleveraged company that Mr. Zell operated into bankruptcy, handed this kind of flaming baton off to Mr. Michaels.
Michaels brought in guys from his career in radio to help them out.
overall, a lot of people lost a lot of money.
employees are out contributions.
man on phone: This sounds like it's going to be a top-to-bottom hatchet job.
where-- where is the hatchet?
I don't-- l-- I don't
if there's a counternarrative, um,
I'm happy to talk about it.
if there's a heroic narrative, l'm happy to talk about it.
we haven"t even gotten into the cultural issues, which l'm sure are not going to please you much at all.
let's cut to something a little more hard and fast.
on December 1 1th, 2008, your board received in a letter-- it was anonymous alleging a broad pattern of sexual harassment.
had received oral sex on the 22nd-floor balcony.
she also added that in a meeting suggested that her assistant come in and perform a sexual act on him to cheer him up.
this is not 1 977. This is 201 0, and those kinds of things are material for the people that work there.
it created a work environment that people say is closer to a frat house than a front-line media company.
so that's in there.
Headlam: 5, 459.
well, that's not going to happen.
He"s got probably 6, 000 words of good stuff.
now every editor and writer thinks they've got good stuff, but he really does have good stuff.
it"s well written, very very sharply reported.
it sticks to the facts, fantastic quotes from people.
your board looked into these matters, had their law firm make calls.
what did they conclude?
man: l'm trying to figure out why that is important.
well, because-- because there's people who are out billions of dollars in debt, who are going to decide whether the current management is going to stay in place.
there"s judges that are going to decide whether they're worthy of bonuses that are on the table.
I will see what I can find out and we'll get back to you.
okay, you have both my numbers, so let me know.
Headlam: What should I know before I listen to my messages?
he was willing to start friendly.
I brought up widespread sexual harassment.
so when he calls and says I can't get this shit together
I should probably get this.
Yeah. - All right.
you shouldn't be here.
Bruce Headlam.
how are you?
you have a couple things going for you.
he is one of the most fair-minded people I know.
that's one thing.
he's a very diligent reporter.
we don't do hit jobs.
that's not the business we're in.
the story we were led to, we were led to by the reporting.
Iet me talk to my bosses, see what they're thinking.
you talk to your bosses, see what they're thinking.
and maybe we can look at it a little more dispassionately in the morning. Fair enough?
you guys have negotiated this issue to the exclusion of everything else. And now all of a sudden you want to broaden out the discussion four hours before we close?
we"re interested in getting responses from you.
they're sending a letter from the law firm.
it'll be staking out a position.
if we say we're going to go with that, then another letter will come from the law firm, and that will be contain threats of legal action.
they"re worried this is a hatchet job.
they're worried where the reporting started, all that kind of thing.
the muscles of the institution are going to kick in here at some point.
it's not really up to me.
Bernstein: We need institutions that have the ability both financially and culturally to bring news that other institutions and individuals cannot.
I think part of what goes on with conferences now is it's sort of lonely and scary out there.
it"s a way to sort of gather around a campfire and say, '"We're all right. Aren't we?
are we okay?
we're fine.
we must be. We have badges on.'
so. - What are you doing for supper tonight?
I"m going to eat with the AA guys.
Oh yeah? - Are you skinny?
how skinny are you?
1 31. - You're short now too.
Yeah. - You used to be like six feet tall.
I was at least. - Is that going to happen to me?
see, my neck is already bent over. - Yeah.
thank you so much.
please welcome David Carr.
you have lived through the worst cyclical, secular recession the publishing business has ever seen in modern times.
look around you. You're still here.
don"t think about the people that are gone.
think about the people that made it.
it's a really big deal.
it's demonstrates, number one, that you are a bunch of tenacious motherfuckers, l'll tell you that.
you have proven you cannot be killed!
l've always thought it was a little bit of a caper that I ended up working at '"The New York Times.'
I don't think I was destined to be the best Timesman there ever was.
I just didn't want to screw it up.
I would find it unspeakable if "'The New York Times"'ended up in a diminished place,
but '"The New York Times'" does not need to be a monolith to survive.
welcome, everybody. We're here to take note of the fact that journalism is alive and well and feisty, especially at '"The New York Times.'
we'll see you in a little while.
I always find French posters of American films funny.
Orson Welles has a size 28 waist.
doesn"t look like any newspaperman I know or anybody I see up in the cafeteria, even though we have a salad bar.
my name is Jane Vasco.
I could use you on my team.
I work for a secret government agency that hunts Neuros.
people who can do dangerous things with their minds.
on my first assignment... something a little weird happened, okay, something really weird.
until I get some answers I'm getting on with my life, doing my job.
stocking up on aspirin, Because let me tell ya, pain's a bitch!
arsonist has finally been apprehended by local authorities.
after allegedly burning another house to the ground in north salem last night the serial arsonist and public enemy number 1 for this community has apparently been apprehended.
trial begins today.
up to the minute coverage right here on Action News.
my partner and I were on routine patrol when we saw the flames.
would you tell the court what happened next?
we arrived at the Samuel's house and saw the suspect fleeing from the scene.
when he refused to obey our orders my partner fired a warning shot.
was that sufficient to stop the defendant from attempting to escape?
no, sir.
I fired at the suspect.
my shot hit him in the leg.
it was at that point that we were able to subdue him and take him into custody.
the police alerted us to the fire just after 10: 00 am.
two of our units responded, including emu.
by the time we got there... ...
the fire had already reached the second story of the samuel's house.
how long did it take to get control of the fire?
it took about an hour before I felt that it was safe for my men to enter the structure.
would you tell us what you discovered?
most of the ground floor was gone.
there was enough left of the support beams to keep the house from collapsing.
after you entered... what was your first impressions as to what caused the fire?
as we passed through the main entry of the house, I noticed a hot spot.
could you explain that?
usually the location where the fire begins is the hottest spot.
usually you'd expect to see the hot spot in a kitchen, near a stove, or in the case of an electrical fire, near wiring or circuit breakers... something like that.
was that the case in the samuel's house?
no.
my first impression was that the ignition point of the fire was a small bathroom on the ground floor.
is that unusual?
it's not unheard of but, yes, it is unusual.
unless there's indication of flammable materials or electrical problems.
given what you saw, did you form an opinion?
my first reaction was that, like the others... this was an arson fire of unknown origin.
was there anything else of note about this downstairs bathroom?
Yes.
and what was that?
we found charred, human remains.
were these "remains" those that were later identified as lucy samuel's,
Yes, sir.
thank you.
that's all.
would defense counsel care to present any witnesses at this time?
no, your honor.
we would, however, appreciate an expeditious ruling on our request for bail.
given the severity of the charges, serial arson and second degree murder,
I'm going to rule that the defendant will be bound over for trial and held at the county jail.
bail is denied.
it's just the preliminary, not the trial.
so where do we go fm here?
to work.
ex-cop.
ex-con.
kinda cute in a borderline sociopath kind of way.
God, I can't believe I just thought that.
here's the deal: I'm able to heal, and connor isn't, but he keeps taking one for the team.
either he's mental or there's more to the man than he wants people to see.
check that, he's definitely mental, but he's also a good act.
he works hard to keep people at arm's length, but then so do I.
maybe we're more alike than I'd like to admit.
except he loves to be hated and maybe would hate to know every once in a while he's loved.
federal Courthouse
here's what we're up against.
public opinion's running pretty high.
people want someone to blame.
there is someone to blame.
a pyromaniac neuro.
I work for the government just like you do.
we know the truth here.
Richaed Stanley Connor's defense attorney
the public doesn't know anything of neuros.
so the truth isn't always the best defense.
that's reassuring.
we're not here to reassure you, we're here to acquit connor.
What're we looking at?
facts that don't look good for connor.
first, he's been identified at three of the six fires.
because we've been on the trail of the neuro who's been starting those fires.
go on.
Connor, against your orders, broke position and entered that house.
Yeah, to try and apprehend the damn fire starter.
look, I understand your thinking.
but I want you to consider for a moment how the jury would react if I put any one of you on the stand and asked you testify to the existence of people who possess the ability to start fires with their mind.
the truth isn't always the best defense.
witnesses have placed connor at the scene of multiple arsons.
he was apprehended exiting the samuel's house...
and then there's his criminal record.
is that admissible?
evidence only requires exclusion when probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.
the present rule recognizes the practice of admitting evidence for a limited purpose and instructing the jury accordingly.
how the hell did you know that?
I read up on it last night.
so the judge can admit connor's criminal record.
given miss vasco's very accurate recital of the law... yes.
hell, why even bother with the trial!
it sounds as if he's already been tried and convicted.
I'm not going to lie to you.
we're facing an uphill battle.
but the war's not over until we've taken our best shots at the evidence.
given everything you told us, it sounds like truth may be our best shot.
why don't we tell the jury what we're really dealing with?
it's not as if we can't prove it.
even if you're right... you're sworn to silence and secrecy.
our hands are tied.
maybe it's time to cut the knot.
what you should have done is made this all go away before it even started.
you'll have to explain that to me, agent mcbride.
as your superior, I do have connections in high places.
as high as they go.
gerald Morgan Supervisor to Andre's team
however, they don't extend into the heavens.
heavens?
what is that supposed to mean?
only god can save connor?
don't give me that crap!
disagreement, I encourage, sir.
I will not tolerate insubordination.
hell, we've covered up the assassinations of foreign leaders.
our own leaders!
but when it comes to connor king...
the man was shot at the scene... by the police.
the case of the decade, solved.
it was on the front pages before they'd read him his miranda.
how, exactly, did you expect us to make that go away?
then let us present the truth.
admit to the existence of neuros.
only as much as we have to.
need to know.
and when the prosecution demands proof... what then?
we give it to them!
we've got years of caseloads.
that would not only bring something to the surface that we've worked very hard to keep secret...
but would compromise your team as well.
need to know rapidly becomes full exposure.
it might be connor's only chance.
and it might not.
are you willing to see your unit de-commissioned to risk a defense that, chances are, no one would ever believe-- despite your proof?
and if they did believe it and connor was acquitted...
the result would be a population in panic and our ability to keep our operations a secret and fight these "things" compromised.
is one man really worth that much?
that one man happens to be innocent.
soldiers do die in battle.
a soldier dying on the field, in combat, is something that can't be undone.
Connor isn't dead.
you know as well as I do... he was always a liability.
liability?
what is that supposed to mean?
feed him to the wolves because you don't like his attitude?
consider this, agent mcbride... with all you do know... if I were to permit this...
put you on the stand... armed with all your evidence...
simply because the fires are of unknown origin, you can't prove that a neuro is behind them.
yeah...
great.
the first time I get you alone and we've got see-thru doors.
my luck's turned to crap.
you know what they say... it ain't over 'til it's over.
what the hell do "they" know?
they're out there.
if andre sent you to cheer me up, you should know... you really suck at it.
maybe.
but andre doesn't have my legs.
what aren't you telling me?
it's the truth.
he's got lousy legs.
Andre just got word... no mention of the team, what we do... or neuros.
great.
so I end up looking like a guy who likes to hang around fires.
who happens to have a criminal record.
we're trying to keep that out.
we'll come up with something.
my neck in a noose.
Connor, look... -save it, bowers.
we all know the risks.
I'd rather gone down takin' out one of those mental defects but...
we don't always get to make that choice, I guess.
Andre's still trying to get the truth out.
no, bad idea.
he'd only compromise the team.
if I have go down for this, I go down.
fall on your sword, man of honor kind of thing.
the hell with that.
figure at least maybe I'd get a going away present from you and supergirl.
what?
just nice to know that, even in a moment of strength and character, you're still a pig.
hang in there.
guard!
twenty-three years old.
married just under two years.
killed in an arson fire.
those faces is what's going to hang connor.
no... regulations and his past are what's going to hang connor.
if they admit his criminal history.
that's no longer an "if."
the judge is admitting it.
look, nobody... not even the top arson investigators could figure out how these fires were started.
hell, even with my brain, if I didn't know about neuros, I wouldn't be able to figure it out.
your point?
what kind of background does connor have that could make him that much of a specialist?
someone who can outsmart even the best?
that's pretty slim, riley?
they don't care how they started just that they were.
you have something better?
I could lie.
I was there with him.
since I can't testify as to why I was there... why do I have to admit that I was.
about a half a dozen cops as witnesses?
my word against theirs?
enough of this.
I don't need two of my people in prison.
just get up there and answer the questions.
and put another nail into connor's coffin.
admitting who we are and what we do is not the only truth here, people.
the truth is that there is a neuro out there who set those fires.
and who stopped setting them the moment connor was arrested.
doesn't matter.
we find the person that did this... and connor walks.
let's get to work!
look, if you guys would only stick to my pattern, we might find this guy.
Connor already put a dent in your pattern the day he and vasco staked out the samuel's house.
we all agree on this: Every target house was two-stories, painted blue, all within a mile of an interstate on ramp.
and all... except one... have garages facing back alleys.
except one isn't a pattern.
Connor played a hunch and he was right.
sorry, riley.
if we go strictly by your criteria we could miss the next opportunity.
if there is one.
well I'm sorry, my database isn't set up to predict hunches.
well maybe it should.
you're fighting the clock on this, people.
trial starts tomorrow.
they're calling bill cole, connor's former cell mate to testify.
with bail denied, former police officer and convict, connor king faces arson and murder charges today in day 1 of this gripping trial.
a profile of Mr. King, the man behind the match tonight.
trial Day 1 9 a. m.
everyone knows connor is crazy, that's why we love him.
but an arsonist, I couldn't believe it.
and yet...
he's down!
let's get him!
take care of this!
Thanks!
so much for falling on your sword.
what the hell did you think you were doing?
trying to save my ass.
which I might've if vasco didn't pull her hero act.
she took two shots to her shoulder... to act like a hero.
she'll get over it.
she was trying to protect you, connor from more than just bullets.
how far do you think you'd get if you got away.
you gonna keep me after school, boss?
I'm trying to help, what do you want me to do, just throw you to the lions.
I thought you already did that.
every man has his breaking point.
I know you.
this isn't yours.
why'd you run?
listen to me you stubborn sonuvabitch, we're trying to help you.
we can't do that if you're hiding something from us.
why'd you run?
bill cole's gonna testify.
I know.
we tried to keep your past record out of this... but you don't know what he knows.
I read your sheet before I took you on the team.
