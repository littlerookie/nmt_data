see you soon.
midnight. I guarantee all kinds of illegal activity.
another? Yeah.
kid?
brother.
come on, you don't have to do this
thank you for what you did for me for killing those animals who raped me.
will you thank Officer White for me, please?
sure.
seeing him come through the door is about the only thing I remember.
thank God.
you remember what time the Negroes left you, right?
in your statement, you said they left you at midnight.
they might have.
they "might" have?
I don't know what time they left me.
I wanted them dead.
would anyone care that they raped a Mexican girl if they hadn't killed those white people at the Nite Owl?
I did what I had to do for justice.
Inez.
Exley, over here.
smile, Inez.
is he your hero?
fellas, how about this?
rape Victim Wheeled Out by Nite Owl Hero.
all they get is Veronica Lake.
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.
Bisbee?
I grew up there.
I'm going back in a couple of years, open up a dress shop.
the girls in Bisbee need a little glamour.
Where'd this come from?
I was 12. My dad went after my mother with a bottle.
I got in the way.
so you saved her.
not for long.
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
he tied me to the radiator.
I watched him beat my mother to death with a tire iron and he left me there.
three days before a truant officer found us.
they never found the old man.
is that why you became a cop?
to get even?
maybe.
do you like it?
I used to.
now it's all strong-arm, sitting duck stuff.
if I could get a chance to work Homicide like a real detective.
that prick, Exley, he shot the wrong guys.
whoever killed Stensland's still around.
I know it in here. I know it.
something's wrong with the Nite Owl.
I just can't prove it, that's all.
I'm not smart enough.
I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.
you're wrong.
you found Patchett. You found me.
you're smart enough.
bud White! What brings you down to the basement?
I got a couple of Nite Owl questions.
don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
anything bother you about it?
the fact that the pack-up boys haven't hauled this shit out of here yet.
the suspects' 3 shotguns match the strike marks on the shell casings.
what more do you want?
there's blood on the wall here.
I thought everyone got shot in the men's room.
that is Stensland's blood.
Stensland? Yeah.
blow to the head.
probably unconscious when they dragged him in the john.
did they hit anyone else?
no, but he was a cop.
probably tried to do something.
grilled cheese, black coffee.
someone was sitting next to him.
2 victims were women?
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.
Susan Lefferts.
Yeah, what about her?
you're welcome!
Mrs. Lefferts
Mrs. Lefferts?
I'm Officer White, LAPD.
tell me about the boyfriend you mentioned at the coroner's office.
I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.
he was too old for you.
and you let him be fresh with me.
they came here one day when I wasn't home.
Mrs. Jensen next door said she saw Susie's boyfriend and another man and she heard a ruckus.
what was his name?
we weren't properly introduced.
Susie gave him a nickname, Muns or Luns.
Stens?
was it Stens?
maybe.
I don't know.
look.
that's him.
that's him.
you said a neighbor heard a ruckus.
was it outside? Inside?
outside.
and then Mrs. Jensen said they kept going under the house.
you have to leave now, officer.
what's through here?
just a room full of old things.
don't move that!
don't mind the smell.
I think a rat died behind the wall.
my Susie was a good girl.
she was never in any kind of trouble at all!
Leland Meeks.Never heard of you.
they call me Buzz.
was it a rat?
Yeah, a great big one.
here.
compliments of the Police Department.
stomach of the week from a motel homicide.
unemployed actor had frankfurter, French fries, alcohol and sperm.
hell of a last supper, don't you think?
anything bothering you about the Nite Owl case?
that you guys won't let it get filed away.
what do you mean?
bud White grilled me on it today.
bud White?
he's not as dumb as I thought.
did he say where he was going after he talked to you?
let my daughter rest in peace!
Mrs. Lefferts, I want to ask a few questions.
officer White already checked under the house.
under the house?
where? -Out back.
all he found was rodents.
I need an I. D. on this as soon as possible.
talk only to me on this one.
I need your help.
I'm busy right now. Why don't you ask your boys in Homicide?
I can't. I need someone outside of Homicide.
tail Bud White until he goes on duty this evening.
do me a real favor and leave me alone.
you make the Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
what?
it's a simple question.
why in the world do you want to dig deeper into the Nite Owl killings?
lieutenant?
Rollo Tomasi.
is there more or do I have to guess?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.
my father ran into him off-duty.
he shot my father 6 times and got away clean.
no one knew who he was.
I made the name up to give him personality.
what's your point?
Rollo Tomasi's the reason I became a cop.
I wanted to catch the guys...
who thought they could get away with it.
it was supposed to be about justice.
then somewhere along the way I lost sight of that.
why'd you become a cop?
I don't remember.
what do you want, Exley?
I want to solve this thing.
Nite Owl was solved.
no.
I want to do it right.
even if it means paying the consequences?
all right, college boy, I'll help.
but there's a case your boys in Homicide don't care about.
they think it's just another Hollywood "homo"-cide.
but I don't.
you help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.
deal?
deal.
Johnny Stompanato.
officer Wendell White. How's tricks, paesano?
I amn't your paesano.
I amn't in the snitch business anymore.
you know a guy named Buzz Meeks?
works for Pierce Patchett.
should I?
you're muscle for hire. Meeks is muscle for hire.
you tell me.
Yeah, I remember now.
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop.
same as you're going to be some day.
that's all you'll get.
keep your 20 bucks.
what do I get if I give you your balls back, you wop cocksucker?
there was a rumor going around that Meeks had a line on a large supply of H.
And?
and nothing!
he skipped out.
bullshit.
how would Meeks get his hands on a large supply of heroin?
you're right.
it's probably bullshit.
even if he did, he could never unload it.
not without drawing all kinds of attention.
maybe that's why he's under a house in Elysian Park not smelling too good paesano.
maybe White's not so dumb after all.
we got Rita Hayworth at the morgue, and now Veronica Lake with White.
I think your case and my case are connected.
it's Fleur-de-Lis again.
fleur-de-lis?
whatever you desire.
porno.
high-class whores cut to look like movie stars.
who knows what else.
Reynolds, the kid that got killed, was involved.
so is Pierce Patchett.
the millionaire?
I think we should go talk to him.
first I want to brace Stompanato.
want an autograph?
write to MGM.
since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs?
what?
LAPD. Sit down.
who in the hell do you think you are?
take a walk, honey.
you are making a large mistake.
get away from our table.
shut up.
a hooker cut to look like Lana Turner is still a hooker.
she just looks like Lana Turner.
she is Lana Turner.
she is Lana Turner.
how was I supposed to know?
I believe the Nite Owl's your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.
I saw you on television getting your medal.
and you're that other Hollywood celebrity policeman, aren't you?
the Veronica Lake look-alike works for you.
she's one of your whores.
a vulgar term.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
why do men and women usually see each other?
let's try this on for size:
fleur-de-lis.
whatever you desire.
an actor named Matt Reynolds.
no? Nothing?
we want some answers.
we all want something.
the guy's as cool as they come.
lieutenant Exley, come in, please. Over.
Exley. The coroner wants to talk to you.
he says he has your I. D.
tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him.
Yeah.
I'll drop you at your car.
where are you going?
Lynn Bracken's.
to find out why Patchett has her seeing Bud White.
see you at the Frolic Room.
Oh, great. You get the girl.
I get the coroner.
hush-hush, off the record and on the q. t.
I was just coming up to see you.
you get that I. D?
thank God for dental records. Stiff used to be a cop.
Leland Meeks.
buzz Meeks?
you knew him?
of him. He was around when I joined the force.
bad reputation. Thanks.
just the facts,Jack.
just the facts.
anything else?
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39-'41.
I need to see his arrest records.
miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I know.
bud told me all about you.
is that so?
and what did White have to say?
he said you were smart.
he also said you were a coward, and that you'd screw yourself to get ahead.
let's concentrate on my smarts.
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
taught you how to dress, talk and think.
I am very impressed with the results.
but I need answers.
and if I don't get them, I'll take you and Patchett down.
Pierce Patchett can take care of himself.
and I'm not afraid of you.
and you forget one thing, Lieutenant
Pierce also taught me how to fuck.
and he tells you who to fuck.
why does he have you fucking Bud White?
what makes you think I'm not seeing Bud because I want to?
it would be easier for you if there was an angle, wouldn't it?
you're afraid of Bud because you can't figure out how to play him.
he doesn't follow the same rules of politics as you do.
it makes him dangerous.
I can handle Bud White.
can you?
I see Bud because I want to.
I see Bud because he can't hide the good inside of him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.
I see Bud because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.
I see Bud for all the ways he's different from you.
don't underestimate me.
the way you've underestimated Bud White?
fucking me and fucking Bud aren't the same thing.
stop talking about Bud White.
shit.
Jack Vincennes.
it's going on midnight.
I need 2 minutes, Dudley.
it's important.
good thing for you...
my wife and daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
a disgrace as a police officer.
straight D fitness reports from every C. O.
he ever served under. Why?
12 years ago, he was on a Vice roust with Dick Stensland.
they questioned Pierce Patchett about a blackmail scam.
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing prominent businessmen with hookers.
anyway, charges were dropped.
insufficient evidence.
you were the supervising officer on that case.
remember anything about it?
what's this about, boy?
it has to do with a murder I've been working with Ed Exley on.
you're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.
since when do you work with Edmund Exley?
it's a private investigation.
I messed something up. I'm trying to make amends.
don't start trying to do the right thing, boyo.
you haven't had the practice.
buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.
so, what does Exley make of this?
I haven't told him yet. I just came from the records room.
have you a valediction, boyo?
Rollo Tomasi.
sergeant Vincennes was killed by a. 32 slug to the heart.
time of death, approximately 1 a. m.
although he was found in Echo Park, forensics indicates the body was moved.
I want 2-man teams to scour that entire neighborhood.
our justice must be swift and merciless.
that is all.
might I have a word with you?
we're trying to run down a lead on an associate of Vincennes.
the records check has led to a dead end.
what's the name?
Rollo Tomasi?
you ever heard Vincennes mention him?
no. No, I haven't.
it's probably nothing. Still keep your eyes open, boyo.
I know it's unlikely, but suppose, just for a moment somebody had a lot of heroin, who would they go to move it?
white, in my office.
captain.
look, just give me a name.
Mickey Cohen.
captain? I could use your fearsome habits at the Victory Motel.
when?
now.
close the door, lad.
you're a bit of a puzzlement to me these days.
you don't seem your old cruel self.
and I had such grand plans for your future.
what plans?
you have your extracurricular activities and I have mine.
we must have a clarification session one of these days.
however right now we'll brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes.
so the question is can I count on you, lad?
yes or no? -Yes, sir.
I want to know everything you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night.
start with the I. D. on the corpse.
an ex-cop.
Leland "Buzz" Meeks.
an ex-cop?
did Jack know him?
only by reputation.
this is Sid Hudgens.
I'm willing to cooperate.
no need to tie me down.
it's for your own safety.
what can you tell us about Jack Vincennes?
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?
I can tell you he's on the night train to the Big Adios.
I had nothing to do with him getting killed, if that's what you mean.
but you were business associates.
what's that got to do with anything?
okay, so we worked together.
it was an information exchange.
I got him first-class collars, he got me good stories.
we were friends.
we'll drop that for the moment.
care to comment on Pierce Patchett?
you think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced?
Wendell, I'd like full and docile cooperation on every topic.
okay, okay, okay. All right.
everyone knows Patchett's worth a boatload of greenbacks.
but the man has hobbies too.
he bankrolls B movies under the table.
and try this one on.
he's rumored to be a heroin snuffer.
all in all, a powerful behind-the-scenes strange-o.
And? And what?
reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is the key to every relationship.
he runs call girls.
primo tail fixed up to look like movie stars.
And?
blackmail shit.
in my car, in the trunk, under the rug.
Patchett got me to photograph this cop screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.
she looks like Veronica Lake.
leave him!
I said leave him be!
get him away from me!
back off! Back off!
I wouldn't trade places with Exley right now for all the whiskey in Ireland.
dudley
dudley, I thought you were going to let the dumb bastard kill me!
and you.
learn to pull your punches a little better.
you can uncaught me now, fellas.
fellas ,we had a deal.
you, me, Patchett, we're a team.
hush-hush.
anything? -Nothing.
Meeks never made an arrest the entire time he worked Vice?
someone must've pulled the files.
what about the daily report books?
they'd be buried in the basement.
find them.
did you talk to Exley?
come in out of the rain.
I want to know what happened with Exley.
just come in.
are you going to tell me what happened with Exley?
we talked.
tell me about him.
later.
you fucked him.
you fucked him.
I thought I was helping you.
I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.
wait.
dudley killed Jack.
he wants you to kill me.
he showed you the photo, didn't he?
didn't he?
think!! Goddamn you, think!!
get out!
dudley
I checked the daily report books.
dudley, Buzz Meeks and Stensland go way back.
I knew Stensland lied to me.
Lefferts' mother I. D.'d Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend.
Stensland pretended he didn't know Meeks...
or her the night that I met Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks what the hell were they up to?
I don't know.
but I think Stens killed Meeks over heroin.
what heroin?
Johnny Stompanato told me that Meeks had heroin for sale.
Meeks ends up dead.
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.
it wasn't the Negroes.
the rape victim lied in her statement.
the first guys to the Mercury coupe were Breuning and Carlisle.
dudley's guys.
they planted the shotguns.
they'd have killed the Negroes too if Jack and I hadn't shown up.
dudley framed them because they were Negroes and had records.
he knew there'd be no questions asked if they were killed resisting arrest.
somehow this is all connected to Jack's angle.
Sid Hudgens the pictures to blackmail Ellis Loew.
a kid got murdered.
to figure this out, we need to work together.
why are you doing this?
the Nite Owl made you.
you want to tear all that down?
with a wrecking ball.
want to help me swing it?
let's go see Ellis Loew.
find out what the District Attorney knows.
you can't go in there.
want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
ask for Capt. Dudley Smith.
tell him we're discussing...
an unemployed actor's death at a Sunset Strip motel.
these are the police.
what do you want?
I want D. A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.
I want you to get a judge to authorize wiretaps on their home phones.
I want authorization to check their bank records.
on what evidence?
call it a hunch.
absolutely not.
dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of the department.
I won't smear his and Patchett's name without
without what?
them smearing yours first?
what do they have?
pictures of you and Matt Reynolds with your pants down?
you have any proof?
the proof had his throat slit.
so far, you're not denying it.
I won't dignify this with answers.
now if you gentlemen will excuse me
I have a press conference for Jack Vincennes that I have to prepare for.
unless you came to wipe my ass,
I believe we're through.
don't pull that good cop-bad cop crap.
I practically invented it.
so what if some homo actor is dead.
boys, girls, ten of them get off the bus to L. A. everyday.
pull him off me!!
I don't know how.
I know you think you're the A-number-one hotshot, but here's the juice.
if I kill you, 10 lawyers will take your place tomorrow.
they just won't come on a bus.
okay!
dudley and Patchett, they.
Oh, my God!
I wouldn't play ball so they set me up! I gave in!
but the kid heard everything so they killed him.
Why? -What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.
because of those pictures I couldn't prosecute them!
Oh, Jesus!
help me up!
is that how you ran the good cop-bad cop?
Patchett?
looks like his bodyguard had a conflict of interest.
suicide note.
says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out his pornography scam.
slicing himself open wasn't his idea.
2 of his fingers are broken.
they held him there.
or drugged him.
dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Patchett's dead.
he sent you after me.
Lynn.
west Hollywood Sheriff.
they're closer than we are.
I'll get the car.
keys!
we took her to the station for safekeeping.
hold her as Joan Smith.
and no one sees her unless I okay it.
someone worked her over.
she wouldn't say who.
see you, Exley.
we should talk to Lynn.
you do it.
what will you do?
I'm going to talk to Sid Hudgens.
compliment him on his performance at the Victory Motel.
remember, Bud, we need evidence.
I'll get the evidence.
are you okay?
you okay?
bud hates himself for what he did.
I know how he feels.
I need to know what you can give me on Dudley Smith.
he's a police captain in business with Patchett.
I've never heard of him.
do you have a place to stay?
I'll be okay.
nobody goes in without official I. D!
he's okay. Let him through.
what happened?
someone beat him to death, and stole a bunch of files.
must have dug up garbage on the wrong guy.
we got it narrowed down to 1000 suspects.
sergeant White dispatch got a call for you.
lieutenant Exley wants you to meet him at the Victory Motel.
you wanted to meet here?
you called it. I thought Hudgens was-- -Hudgens is dead.
let's get out of here.
it's too late.
you figured it was a set-up but came anyway?
a lot of bad stuff happened here.
it's as good a place as any for it to end.
clip.
all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
now's your chance.
he died in the line of duty, didn't he?
bud.
goddamn it!
you okay?
Yeah.
come on. Easy.
move!
Rollo Tomasi.
who is he?
you are.
you're the guy who gets away with it.
Jack knew it.
and so do l.
are you going to shoot me or arrest me?
good lad.
always the politician.
let me do the talking.
after I'm done, they'll make you Chief of Detectives.
hold up your badge so they'll know you're a policeman.
you think you can talk your way out of this, Lieutenant?
no ,but I can tell the truth.
during our investigation of events surrounding the Nite Owl case
Jack Vincennes, Bud White and I learned the following:
your golden boy's throwing his whole life away.
the 3 Nite Owl suspects while guilty of kidnapping and rape were innocent of the multiple homicides at the Nite Owl.
the gunmen were most likely
Los Angeles police officers Michael Breuning and William Carlisle and a third man who may or may not have been Captain Dudley Smith.
the objective:
the elimination of another police officer
richard Stensland who, along with former LAPD officer Leland "Buzz" Meeks also committed multiple homicides on behalf of Captain Smith and then betrayed him over 25 pounds of heroin the retrieval of which was the ultimate motivation behind the Nite Owl killings.
beginning with the incarceration of Mickey Cohen
capt. Smith has been assuming control of organized crime in Los Angeles.
this includes the assassinations of Mickey Cohen lieutenants the systematic blackmail of city officials and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.
captain Smith admitted as much to me before I shot him at the Victory Motel.
that's it.
well the press will have a field day.
Christ! It'll stain the Department for years.
decades.
if we can get the kid to play ball who's to say what happened?
maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.
good idea. -lf we get the press to play.
want to tell me what you're smiling about?
a hero.
how'd he know what we said?
he couldn't have heard us.
in this situation you'll need more than one.
it is my pleasure to present this award to
detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley two-time Medal of Valor recipient.
next year the LAPD will move into its new facility.
with leaders like Edmund Exley the image of fat cops stealing apples will be left behind and Los Angeles will finally have the police force it deserves.
you just couldn't resist.
they're using me. So for a while, I'm using them.
come on.
thanks for the push.
congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.
some men get the world, others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
I still ask myself if I did the right thing when I abandoned his floating city
and I don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet and if then you no loner hear the music of the gods around you
but, like he used to say
you're never really done for as long as you got a good story and someone to tell it to
trouble is nobody'd believe a single word of my story
it happened every time
someone would look up and see her
it's difficult to understand
there'd be more than a thousand of us on that ship
traveling rich folks, immigrants and strange people, and us
yet there was always one
one guy alone who would see her first
maybe he was just sitting there eating or walking on the deck
maybe he was just fixing his pants
he'd look up for a second. A quick glance out to sea and he'd see her
then he'd just stand there rooted to the spot, his heart racing
and every time every damn time, I swear he'd turn to us, towards the ship towards everybody and scream
america
the Legend of 1900
new York
the one who sees America first
there's one on every ship
and don't be thinking it's an accident
or some optical illusion It's destiny
those are people who always have that precise instant stamped on their life
and when they were kids you could look into their eyes and if you looked carefully enough you'd already see her
america
and I've seen a few Americas
six years on that ship five crossings a year
europe, America and back always soaking in the ocean
when you stepped on land you couldn't even piss straight in the john
it was teady. The john, I mean
but you'd keep bobbing like an idiot
you can get off a ship all right But off the ocean
I was just closing
what can I do for you?
when I boarded, I was 24 years old
and I only cared about one thing in life
playing the trumpet
I'm selling it
Conn
not bad
best brass money can buy
six pounds, ten shillings Best I can do
that horn's my whole life, mister
even being a nobody has got to be worth more than twenty lousy bucks
it that's how things are, I suppose it's barely worth half a crown
shut the door when you leave please
okay, pops you win
you just bought yourself a piece of musical history
now if you want my advice go out, treat yourself to a decent meal
at least let me play it one last time
young man I don't have time to waste
all right
hurry up, then
I'm closing
thank you
two peas in a pod, wouldn't you say
it's the music you were just playing
what is it?
it doesn't have a name
just a handful of people have had the privilege of hearing it
that style. I was wondering since this morning, but...
I can't work out who this amazing piano player is
I don't think you ever heard of him
who is he?
if I told you this pianist never existed
I wouldn't be lying
I don't like secrets
come on now, Yank who the devil is playing?
that's my secret
it was the first year of this frigging century as defined by an unknown colored coal stoker on the Virginian
fucking rich-ass bastards Can't lose nothing but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs
can't lose no watch not even a beat-up Elgin or a sorry-ass cufflink
what am I talking about? Not even a fake fucking ring

must've been somebody poor at the party
look at this shit
nasty fucker
damn rich. Don't forget nothing unless they owe you some money
what in the scuts you doing here?
T. D. Lemons
howdy do there, Lemon
immigrant bastard
you said it That's the way the immigrants do it
have a baby on the ship and then leave on board another mouth to feed
and, like that, avoid trouble with the immigration office
what's a boy like him going to be when he grows up?
another immigrant
don't pay those bastards no mind Lemon
go on, lap it up, boy
this one they left in first class on top the piano
they are hoping some rich guy will come and stick a silver spoon in his mouth
and who does the little ape get instead?
a poor coal stoker
Someoe is taking you for a sucker, Danny
they have the fun You have the misery
fuck poverty
you stinking sewer rats
T. D. was wrote on that box. Any of you shitheads know what that means?
I forgot. You all can't read
it means, "Thanks, Danny." "Thanks, Danny
they left him for me and I'm gonna keep him
rest of you all can go fuck yourselves
Danny, what are you going to call the nino?
hell, I ain't think about that
to start off I'm going to name him after me
Danny Boodman
then I'll put "T. D." in the middle
like rich folks puts that in the middle, don't you think?
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
all fucking lawyers gots initials in the middle of their names
well, my lawyer was Jonathan PTK Wonder
my son grow up to be a lawyer I swear I'll kill him myself
but the boy's name is still going to be Danny Boodman T. D. Lemon
he ain't the son of no fucking duke, Danny
you found him on a Tuesday Call him "Tuesday""
you ain't as dumb as you look colored boy
I found him the first month of the first year of this frigging new century
so I calls him: Nineteen Hundred
nineteen Hundred? But that's a number
it was a number, now it's a name
Danny Boodman T. D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred
Danny, your little bambino is not so happy
come on, hurry. Hurry up. Don't worry, your mama's here
damn. How can something that small shit so much?
and that's how little Nineteen Hundred grew up
inside that cradle as big as a shi
but since Danny was afraid they'd take him away on account of some business concerning documents and visas the boy lived his early years always hiding in the belly of the Virginian
okay, now try one for yourself
put your finger up here against these words so the letters can't run off on you "Man
all right, keep going "Go""
go on "Ma""
just a little bit more "Ma"
boy, you read like a god, Lemon
now go on, put them all together kind of like them boiler valves Come on "Man... go...Mama
mango Mama. All right. Deep going
Yank...My...Chain
Danny, why are you laughing so much
because these are names of horses. Don't that make you laugh?
I"m just crazy about these horses' names. Look at this one here "Happy Hoofers""
listen to this "Sassy Lassy""
and this one "Red Hot Mama""
what's a mama, Danny?
a mama?
a mama's a horse
a horse?
racehorse
matter of fact, you know what I say Mama's the best horse in the world?
thoroughbred You bet on a mama, you always win, Tano D Amato
the King of Lemons
dad, put your finger here and read
T. D. doesn't mean "Thanks, Danny
who's this pansy ass?
that's enough reading for tonight
too much reading is bad for you
what else is bad, Danny?
everything off the Virginian is bad
everything
they got sharks on the land they eat you alive
you keep away from they, you hear?
Danny, what's an orphanage?
well, a orphanage is like a great big prison where they lock up folks that ain't got kids
so if I wasn't with you they would put you in an orphanage?
you got that right, little Lemon
night-night
watch out, Danny
roll over. Roll him over
my God. Doctor
call the doctor. Get the doctor
Danny, you bloody cow. Talk to me
ain't nothing but a pat on the back, boys "Holy Shoot..."
and Times Were Good was disqualified "Saucy Bossy"
it took him three days to go toes up, old Danny
he let go on the sixth race in Chicago
drinkable Water by two lengths over Vegetable Soup and five over Blue Foudation. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil for Thou art with me
thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me
thanks Danny
in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
Amen

nineteen Hundred was eight years old then
he'd made the trip between Europe and America about fifty times, I imagine
the ocean was his home
he never set foot on dry land Never
though he'd seen it from the ports a hundred times
but he never got off the boat
problem was as far as the world was concerned he didn't even exist
there wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place
he didn't have a country, he didn't even have a birth date. No family
he was eight years old but officially he had never even been born "No Entry
captain. Captain, wake up
what's his name?
not the song, the boy
like the song
nineteen Hundred, all of this is entirely against the regulations
fuck the regulations
but I don't understand what the record has to do with any of this
this record shouldn't exist
the only existing matrix was destroyed right after it was cut
this is a matrix
quite handy for on-the-spot recordings that sort of business
how did you get your hands on this?
I spend the better part of the day putting the bits and pieces together
I found them by accident.
hidden inside one of those two pianos
I bought them from a second-hand dealer
they've emptied out an old hospital ship at Plymouth
it's over there, mate
slow down not so fast with that pulley
easy up there, easy
watch that! These aren't bananas, you know -Where are you from? -Liverpool -What do you do? -I'm a barber -Sign him on -Thanks very much
next. What's your trade?
I'm a carpenter. A good mechanic
get out
what do you do?
I play the trumpet
we've already got musicians on board. Next
where the hell is he going?
what's that? I don't know
when you don't know what it is it's jazz
it was the happiest day of my life
all those people hope in their eyes
the goodbyes, the sirens
and that big floating world starting to move
it felt like one big party A huge bash just for me
but just three days later the ocean got tired of the festivities
Hey, Conn?
what's the matter?
lose your sea legs?
Yuu're the new trumpet man, aren't you?
and you blow a Conn
come with me I have a cure for your misery
follow me
take the brakes off, please
that's crazy
trust me. Just take the brakes off
hop on next to me
what are you, some kind of nut case
you better get on now or you never will
tell me something do you have children?
they'll lock you up in the orphanage one of these days
he's nuts
Oh, mama
I see you know your horses
just a litte
good man
good evening, Captain
care for a ride?
tell me again how big the fucking window was
it was a big fucking window
we're going to be shoveling coal on this ship till eternity
no shit
least you know what you'll be doing when you grow up
Conn
you're from New Orleans, right?
how'd you know that?
I love that town
Really? I haven't been there in a while?
in winter, it's beautiful
and in March you can always count on one afternoon when you least expect it the fog slides in a milky barrier hangs just below the street lamps
it cuts everything off Iike a white blade. And it's magic
houses lose their top floors trees lose their branches
St. Louis Cathedral loses its spires
people passing by they lose their heads
so from the neck up everything disappears
all you can see in Jackson Square is decapitated bodies stumbling around bumping into each other saying "How's your mama and them?
that's it Too bad it doesn't last long
how do you know all these things?
you know ever since I came on board
I been hearing a lot of talk about a guy
he's supposed to have been born on this ship and never been off it since
crazy story
twenty years without ever setting foot on land?
twenty seven
they say this guy makes music that's never been heard before
I've heard of him too
first off I thought you were the guy
but then something didn't add up
I figured: if he's Nineteen Hundred how could he know New Orleans so well?
because you've been to New Orleans
if I told you I'd never set foot in that town would you believe me?
whoever you are
Max Tooney
gald to meet you
how we doing?
we're supposed to blow it up not wait for it to be eaten by the fishes
you're not going to blow up a goddamn thing because my best friend is on this ship
you'll all be responsible for murder
get him out of here!
do whatever you want, but get him off my case
I'm not making this up and I'm not crazy
if I tell you there's a man aboard the Virginian
Jesus Christ it means there's a man aboard the Virginian
we cleaned that scuttle from stem to stern
not even doorknobs were left
only dynamite. Dynamite
how can you be so sure that's a man on board?
if you've any proof, out with it
because I'm the horse's arse who has to throw that switch
I'm sure he's there
I spent the best years of my life on the Virginian
end of line
all right! Run it down
what the hell do you think about when you're playing?
where does your mind go when you hit the keys?
last night I was in a beautiful country
women had perfume in their hair
everything glowed
and it was full of tigers
he traveled.
and each time he ended up someplace different
in the heart of London on a train in the middle of the country on the edge of a giant volcano in the biggest church in the world counting the columns and staring up at the crucifixes
he traveled
Hey, Kid, give us a good tarantella
and you show me how a tarantella goes paisa
america
why the hell don't you get off?
just once? One time?
see the world for yourself with your own eyes?
you ever think about it?
you could do anything you wanted to
people would go crazy for you
you could make beaucoup bucks, man
get yourself the finest house
get yourself a wife
why not?
God knows you can't spend the rest of your life traveling back and forth like some yo-yo
the world is out there
nothing but a gangplank to cross
and what's a gangplank? A few stupid steps
christ everything is waiting at the bottom of those steps
why don't you just do it one time?
why don't you just get off?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
I think land people waste a lot of time wondering why
winter comes and you can't wait for summer
summer comes and you live in dread of winter
that's way you never tire of traveling
always chasing someplace far away where it's always summer
doesn't sound like a good bet to me
hold it! Stop everything
forgive me for allowing myself to your music was so strong
you don't look too happy to be going to America
it's not America
it's everything I leave behind
until a few years ago I know only my field
the world for me started and ended there in that little piece of the land
I never walked down the main street of a city
maybe you can't understand but
I understand perfectly
I know someone who went through something very similar
and one fine day did his field go dry too?
and did his wife also run off with a priest?
and did the fever take his five children?
no. But he ended up alone too
then he is more lucky than me
I still have a daughter The young one
she survived
and it's for her that I decide one day to fight against my bad luck and travel all over without a destination
and then one day when I go through one of the many towns I never see before
I come to a hill
and then I see the most beautiful thing in my life
the sea
the sea?
I never see it before
it was like lightning hit me
because I hear the voice
the voice of the sea?
Yeah, the voice of the sea
I never heard it
the voice of the sea it is like a shout
a shout big and strong screaming and screaming
and the thing it was screaming was:
you with shit instead brains life is immense can you understand that?
immense
I never think of it that way
a revolution was in my head
that's how
I suddenly decide to change my life to start fresh
change life. Start fresh
tell that to your friend
it's Max Tooney, your friend
come on out, Nineteen Hundred!
I'm your friend too
even if we never met
don't worry, no cops
you said something about a piano
where was it exactly?
we found it over there
on the violin yours truly, Bill Douglas
tuba and bass, Freddie Loycano
Max Tooney on trumpet
and finally, on piano
Danny Boodman T. D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred the greatest
for the last time Nineteen Hundred, just...
just the normal notes
end of the line
where do yu get it?
what?
the music
I don't know. You see that woman over there for example?
she looks like someone who's killed her husband with the help of her lover
and now she's running off with the family jewels
don't you think this music's her?
damn, it's true
you see that guy over there?
he can't forget a thing
listen to his music
his head bursts with memories and there's nothing he can do about it
and look at that one there
she looks like a prostitute who's thinking of becoming a nun
that's incredible
now, look at this one
see how he walks?
I'd say he's in someone else's suit judging by the way he wears it
I'd say he's a stowaway slipped into first class
Iooking for an amorous adventure
this one's got America stamped on his eyes
I can already hear him screaming
America!
I'm going to get my money back
that'll be the day
singleton, Lee Claire
you don't know me
but I was wondering if we could have a little chat
a little chat? What about?
about anything you like weather conditions?
anything You pick or chuck the subject
is this an obscene phone call?
christ
you the fish with the twenty-dollar name?
man, where you going? We got to talk
that way
wait, we just want to talk to you
where the hell are we, man?
hold still you little son of a bitch
come on out! We don't want to hurt you
we're players, man! Sidemen
bon appetie
you can say that again, brother You can say that again
you the one that plays ten kinds of jazz rolled into one?
I've never counted them I'm just a piano player
better start counting, buddy. The man who invented jazz sent us here
Really?
what does he want with me?
he challenges you to a piano duel
Jello Roll, what's the reason for a trip to Europe on a steamer when you've never been on anything bigger than a Mississippi riverboat?
I don't give a damn about Europe
the only reason I'm hopping this crappy tub is because there's a gentleman I want to meet
they say he plays a hot piano
but I hear he has a little thing about setting foot on land
is he talking about me?
you bet he's talking about you
he say, Hey, Jelly
someone plays better piano than you
so I say to myself, Self how can this cat play so well when he don't even have the balls to get off the goddamn ship
Hey, hot damn, Jelly
you invented jazz
I said, Goddamn you can afford a first-class ticket to Europe and the boat that's going to take you just by lifting a finger Get a shot of it, boys, get a shot
tell the truth. Are you scared?
I don't know
why a duel? What happens when you have a duel?
I hope this Jelly Roll Morton guy is as good as they say
heard a lot about him back in the States
he's a Negro
I believe you're sitting in my seat
you're the one who invented jazz, right?
that's what they say
and you're the one who can't play unless you have the ocean under your ass? right?
that's what I say
jelly Roll Morton did not play
he caressed those notes
it sounded like a silk slip sliding down a woman's body
his hands were butterflies so light
he got his start in the famed tenderloin districts of New Orleans
and did he learn to stroke the keyboard in those whorehouses
people doing the deed upstairs didn't want any uproar
they wanted music to slip behind the curtains and under the beds without disturbing the passion
that's the kind of music he played
and in that he truly was the best
Bravo!
your turn, sailor
come on
what's he doing?
"silent Night"?
isn't that a Christmas carol?
does he understand it's a contest?
"Silenet Night" is jazz?
is it Christmas already?
come on, Jelly Roll show us what jazz is all about
what is wrong with you?
I can't help it. Music makes me cry
the whole crew bet on you I put a year's pay on the line
now you cut that out and start thinking your music
can I bet too?
No!
it's bad luck to bet on yourself
I don't want to bet on me. I want to bet on him. He's the greatest
you are crazy, you know that?
that way, if you lose you'll get your money back
it's exactly the same piece of music, darling
this is really the end of the line
unbelievable
come on you can do better than that
jelly, show them how to sink a ship
you stick this up your ass
Hey, Max
give me a cigarette, will you?
you're not handling this well
just give me a cigarette
you don't smoke
what is the matter with you? You could lick this guy with one hand
come on
are you going to give me a cigarette?
we'll be chucking coal a couple hundred years and all you can say is...
give me a fucking cigarette will you?
you asked for it, asshole
you smoke it
I don't know how
jelly Roll Morton spend the rest of that trip locked in his cabin
when we got to Southampton he got off the Virginian and went back to America
I remember Nineteen Hundred watched him as he walked off down the dock and all he said was
fuck jazz too
and that's just what he said "Fuck jazz too
this is an incredible story
did I miss anything important?
you couldn say that
damn
don't worry, our friend will fill you in later. Won't you?
you can count on it
thanks He's so good at telling tales
this is no tale, sir
there's nobody here
because there's too many of us We scared him
you leave this ship or I'll have to have you arrested
get back to work. Quickly
give me another chance
piss off, friend. Noon tomorrow this ship is history
stop or I'll shoot
gotcha
pops, easy, it's me
you again?
Yes, lower that cannon, will you?
see your instrument and then steal it back again
that's an old trick. I should have guessed that you were a thief
I was looking for this
and what do you need that for?
it's a matter of life and death And I need a phonograph too
a thief and a liar
pops I don't have a whole lot of time
well, I do! Seeing as I have a gun
and now that I think of it since when were records made on board steamships
if that music was played by your friend it means that at some time in his life he got off that ship! Correct?
not a chance, Pops
he cut this passionate recording personally
I think it's his best work
but he didn't jump ship to do it not even for a second
the sky's the limit Mr. Nineteen Hundred
if this record sells like hotcakes and we think it will you'll go far, Mr. Nineteen
do you mind if I call you Nineteen?
this is going to hurt, isn't it?
ready now, gentelmen
on the count. And one, two, three
that is one amazing piece of music What is it called?
it's going to have people crying buckets
it's got to have the right title though, something catchy like "Swinging in the Breeze" or...
great, as usual "Sweet Nineteen," that's it
you are going to be bigtime
and all you got to do is take that big step
what big step?
getting off. Getting off these lousy planks of wood and going after...
going after your fame and fortune
I don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
we'll print millions of copies so that people all over the world can hear your wonderful music Nineteen
Mr. Nineteen?
I won't let my music go anywhere without me
No! Don't touch
what are you doing? You can't do that
we have a contract. You can't go back now
I always go back
miss
I'd be pleased if...
miss
I'd be thrilled if yu'd accept this...
small token
miss Padoan, what are you doing here all alone? Counting the waves?
the captain said we'd be passing the Tropic of Cancer soon
great! At least we'll have something to look at
you ever notice how the sea changes colors? Ten times a day
even more
I could look at the sea all day long
you know farmers don't ever look at the sea
it scares them. At least that's what I heard
that's not true
once, my father told me he heard the ocean's voice
Really? What did it say?
I can't tell you. It's a secret. And secrets should be kept
gosh, it's really coming down now. Let's get back inside
let me take your arm
women's dormitory 3 class
next
next
excuse me
excuse me
excuse me
please, miss
I have to talk to you
you're meeting your father aren't you?
yes
how did you know?
I think I've met him
on this ship quite a few years ago
I don't know if he took this same ship
I'm sure of it
he has a musette
I think we played together
I don't know if he'd remember, but say hello to him
I will
but how did you know who I was? It's very strange, no?
it's a secret
and secrets should be kept
although I think your father felt differently back then
please accept this...
small musical token
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you
I want you to...accept this small token.
I can't hear you
good luck
thank you. Good luck to you too
why don't you come and visit us some day?
we live on Mott Street. Number 27
my father has a fish shop
maybe
Padoan, okay. Next
next
he never mentioned her to me again And I never asked
at least not for the next twelve crossings
besides, he was happy just like always
his popularity was its peak
then, one evening in spring halfway between Genoa and New York right it the middle of the ocean
in three days when we get to New York
I'm getting off this ship
cat got your tongue?
no, I'm glad
but all of a sudden?
my man...
that's aces
I've got to see something down there
what?
the ocean
you're pulling my leg
you've seen nothing but the ocean since the day you were born
but from here
I want to see it from there
it's not the same thing at all
wait till we dock lean over the side take a good look
it's the same thing
no, it's not
from land, you can hear its voice
you don't hear that from a ship
what do you mean, its voice?
its voice
it's like...a big scream...
telling you that life is immense
once you've heard it, then you know what you have to do to go on living
I could stay here forever
but the ocean would never tell me a thing
but if I get off live on land for a couple of years then I'll be normal just like the others
then maybe one day
I'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
I don't know who's been telling you this bullshit or if you're just making it up
but you want to know what I think?
I think...
the real reason you want off this ship is the girl
it's always the girl
but even if it's not the reason that suits me just fine
because I've always wanted you to leave this ship and play for the people on land and marry a nice woman and have children and all those things in life which are not immense but are worth the effort
you'll come visit me won't you, Max? On land?
of course
that way, you'll introduce me to the mother of your children
and invite me for Sunday dinner
I'll bring the dessert and a bottle of wine and you'll tell me I shouldn't have and while you're showing me around your house shaped like a ship your wife will be cooking a turkey
and then we'll sit at the table and I'll tell her she's an excellent cook and she'll say how you talk about me all the time
you know I'm going to give you my camel coat
you'll cut a fine figure when you get down there
how many people I have seen saying goodbye on the docks without giving a damn
but when I said goodbye to Nineteen Hundred it was a real blow
we laughed and kept saying "See you soon
but inside we both knew we'd never see each other again
goodbye, Nineteen Hundred! Take care
good luck. Have a good time
take care Nineteen Hundred, take care
write us a letter sometimes
give my regards to Broadway
What'd he do, step in shit?
maybe he just forgot something
maybe he's forgotten why he's getting off
what do you want?
he was strange for a long time after that
he wouldn't talk to anyone
he preferred keeping to himself for days and days
he seemed taken by very personal matters
then one day while I was sitting at the bar
thanks for the coat, Max. Fit like a glove
it was a real shame
I'm much better now I'm done with all that
just like old times
I left the Virginian on August 21st, 1933
with my leave papers and back pay everything in order
I knew that sooner or later I'd have been through with the ocean
so that's what I did
I heard no more about Nineteen Hundred or the Virginian
not that I ever forgot them
on the contrary
during the war I'd always ask myself
who knows what Nineteen Hundred would do if he were here?
who knows what he'd say?
fuck war, he'd say
but said by me it wasn't the same thing
a lot of time's gone by, you know who's to say he really didn't leave
maybe he actually went to the fish shop and asked for that woman
maybe
what's the matter? You lose your sea legs?
where the hell did you find that record?
what have you been up to all these years
making music
even during the war?
even when no one was dancing anymore
even when the bombs were falling
and I kept playing till the ship got here
call this a ship?
it's more like a mountain of dynamite about to explode
a bit dangerous, don't you think?
and you, Max?
Where's your trumpet?
I gave it up as well, as while back
but, you know, now I'm in the mood for starting again
I'm busting with new ideas
let's start a duo. You and me
or our own band
the Danny Boodman
T. D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred Big Band
it's gets the blood going
we'd be a smash
come on, Nineteen Hundred Come with me. Let's get off
we'll watch the fireworks from the pier and then we'll start from scratch
sometimes that's the way you have to do it
you go right back to the beginning
you're never really done for...
as long as you've got a good story and someone to tell it to
remember?
you told me that
well, what a stack of stories you got now
the world would be hanging on your every word crazy for your music
believe me
all that city
you just couldn't see an end to it
the end...
please?
you please just show me where it ends?
it was all very fine on that gangway. And I was grand too in my overcoat
I cut quite a figure
and I was getting off
guaranteed
that's wasn't the problem
it wasn't what I saw that stopped me, Max
it was what I didn't see
understand?
what I didnt' see
in all that srawling city there was everything except an end
there was no end
what I did not see was was where the whole thing came to an end
the end of the world
you take a piano
keys begin
the keys end
you know there are 88 of them
nobody can tell you any different
they are not infinite
you are infinite
and on those keys the music that you can make is infinite
I like that
that I can live by
you get me up on that gangway and you roll out in front of me a keyboard of millions and billions of keys that never end and that's the truth Max that they never end
that keyboard is infinite
and if that keyboard is infinite then there is no music you can play
you're sitting on the wrong bench
that's God's piano
Christ, did you see the streets? Just the streets.
there were thousands of them
how do you do it down there?
how do you choose just one?
one woman
one house
one piece of land to call your own one landscape to look at one way to die?
all that world just weighing down on you
you don't even know where it comes to an end
I mean, aren't you ever just scared of breaking apart at the thought of it?
at the enormity of living it?
I was born on this ship
and the world passed me by
but two thousand people at a time
and there were wishes here
but never more than fit between prow and stern
you played out your happiness but on a piano that was not infinite
I learned to live that way
land?
land is a ship too big for me
it's a woman too beautiful
it's a voyage too long perfume too strong
it's music I don't know how to make
I could never get off this ship
at best
I can step off my life
after all
I don't exist for anyone
you're the exception, Max
you're the only one who knows I'm here
you're a minority
and you'd better get used to it
forgive me, my friend but I'm not getting off
Hey, Max
picture the scene at the Golden Gates
some guy searching a list trying to find my name not finding it
what did you say your name was again?
niemann, Nightingale, Ninestock...
Nittledeen?
well, you see, sir I was born on a ship
beg your pardon?
born, raised, and died on a ship
maybe I'm not registered there
shipwreck?
six and a half tons of dynamite Boom
feeling better now?
Yeah, I'm fine except I lost an arm
an arm?
Yes, in the explosion
well, you should be able to find one over there
which one did you say you were missing?
left, sir
I'm dreadfully sorry we only seem to have two rights
two right arms?
afraid so
would you mind awfully if...
if I what?
well, if you take a right arm instead of a left?
well, all things considered better a right arm than nothing, I suppose
couldn't agree more
no laughing matter, Max
what a cock-up
spend eternity with two right arms?
I mean, how would you make the sign of the cross?
Hey, Max
imagine the music I could play with two right arms
hope I can find a piano up there
what would you have done in my shoes?
I don't know
I wouldn't probably have felt quite useless
sooner or later, all stories end and there's nothing left to add
anyhow, thanks, pops
Conn
there's just one thing I don't get
who hid the broken record inside the piano?
you're looking at him
so you weren't so useless after all
Conn
here

well, you'll be needing it
never mind the money
a good story's worth more than an old trumpet
okay, pops
his Highness, Prince Yu arrives!
your Majesty.
Yu...
is everything ready?
mother...
second Brother should be here soon.
has he entered the Palace?
l hear he stopped at the Official lnn to await orders.
first Brother mentioned...
that as soon as Father arrives...
he will ask permission to leave.
he wants to go to Qingzhou.
mother.
her Majesty the Empress arrives!
first Brother.
your Majesty.
so you are leaving.
are you afraid?
you are my mother, Your Majesty.
we have been intimate for three years.
you, of all people should know who l am.
l am first and foremost my father's son.
mother!
l am not your mother!
many things can be changed.
ln fact, nothing can be changed.
still, l would like to try.
what are you going to do?
lt is time to go and welcome the Emperor
the day breaks.
the court presides.
peace to all.
lt is the Hour of the Tiger.
the day breaks.
the court presides.
peace to all.
lt is the Hour of the Tiger.
your servant kneels before the Empress.
your Majesty's medicine for the hour is ready.
by the Emperor's command...
retire to your chambers!
the welcome ceremony is cancelled!
retire to your chambers!
the welcome ceremony is cancelled!
the Emperor commands...
retire to your chambers!
the welcome ceremony is cancelled!
retire to your chambers!
the welcome ceremony is cancelled!
your Majesty...
the Emperor commands...
everyone is to return to their chambers.
the welcome ceremony is cancelled.
where is His Majesty?
the Emperor has diverted his escort to the Official lnn.
your Majesty...
the Emperor requests the presence of the Empress and the two princes...
on the Chrysanthemum Terrace tomorrow morning.
your Highness, Prince Jai...
the Emperor has arrived.
your son kneels before the Emperor.
l am honored...
by Father's personal visit.
come.
father's prowess is unequalled.
the decision to send you to the frontier...
was clearly the right one.
l came here today...
to warn you...
against your past mistakes.
there are many things in Heaven and Earth..
but you can only have...
what l choose to give you.
what l do not give...
you must never take by force.
father's counsel...
is etched into my heart.
return to the Palace with me.
his Highness, Prince Jai arrives!
Jai.
your son kneels before the Empress.
mother.
lt has been over three years.
have you been well?
l am very well.
and you?
l have missed Mother...
every moment of every day.
mother.
you must have suffered.
l am fine.
charity seeks no recognition.
virtue seeks no reward.
the harvest is abundant.
lt is the Hour of the Rabbit.
your Majesty...
the Empress has been taking her medicine...
daily and without interruption.
following Your Majesty's instruction...
the black fungus is added personally by my daughter, Chan.
nobody knows about the new ingredient.
has it been ten days now?
exactly ten days.
ls your relationship with Father unchanged?
why is Mother embroidering so many chrysanthemums?
lt is the Chrysanthemum Festival soon, remember?
mother!
mother!
your Majesty! Your Majesty!
what is the matter?
your Highness...
your servant does not know.
lt is the third time this has happened.
mother's illness is clearly serious.
have you been taking your medicine?
have a rest.
before the Chrysanthemum Festival...
l must finish all the embroidery.
why don't you go and see your brothers?
his Highness, Prince Jai arrives!
Jai bows to his First Brother, the Crown Prince Wan.
second Brother, please sit.
thank you.
second Brother.
Yu.
second Brother...
l hear Father changed his plans and welcomed you in person.
we all waited up half the night in vain.
these years away from home...
must have been hard.
lt was fine.
do you know wha is wrong with Mother?
father says she suffers from anemia.
she has been taking her medicine regularly.
she seems to be obsessed with embroidering chrysanthemums.
they must be for the Festival.
dad!
have you been visiting with the Crown Prince again?
why would l visit the Crown Prince?
father knows.
what do you know?
go more often!
this is a Persian black fungus.
do you know its properties?
two grams a day, taken over a few months...
will cause a person to lose all their mental faculty.
and you think you know so much.
but the Empress...
don't breathe a word.
our entire clan will be executed!
law of the nation...
precept of the home...
ancient yet unchanged.
lt is the Hour of the Dragon.
your servant kneels before the Empress.
your Majesty's medicine for the hour is ready.
so, you are Chan.
Yes, Your Majesty.
the lmperial Doctor is your father?
Yes.
the Crown Prince seems a little pale lately.
ls the Empress asking her servant?
my duty is only to prepare Your Majesty's medicine.
l am not acquainted with His Highness's state of health.
ls that so?
you may enter.
'to the highest mountains my brothers ascend...
but one is missing, without berries in his hair.
prince Jai has returned.
the family is reunited.
do you know why...
every Chrysanthemum Festival...
we assemble on this high terrace as a family?
father, on the ninth day of the ninth month...
the sun and the moon unite.
we call this the Chrysanthemum Festival.
lt symbolizes the strength and harmony of the family...
and we always celebrate on this high terrace.
that is a very good answer.
the terrace is round. The table is square.
what do they represent?
that Heaven is round. The earth is square.
the law of the Heavens...
dictates the rule of earthly life...
under the circle, within the square...
everyone has his proper placement.
this is called natural law.
emperor, Courtier, Father, Son...
loyalty, filial piety, ritual and righteousness...
all relationships obey this law.
do you have any requests?
your Majesty...
l beg permission...
to travel to Qingzhou.
you also wish to be sent to the frontier ?
l have never left the Palace...
and would like to gain experience in the outside world.
ls there anything else?
father...
l beg your permission, also.
what is it?
l...
do not know if it would be appropriate...
then speak when you do know.
you did not finish the medicine served at the Hour of the Dragon.
ls there any left?
your Majesty...
there is a sip or two.
serve it to the Empress.
Yes.
your Majesty...
your consort is not ill.
that is your opinion.
medicine has to be taken in the right measure, at the right time.
everything abides by its own law.
Yu.
mother, please do not upset Father.
mother, please take the medicine.
remain kneeling...
until your mother drains the cup.
father...
mother does not wish to drink.
why not let her be?
medicine is governed by dosage...
just as life is governed by its own law.
surely you all know this.
mother...
you have been taking this medicine for years.
this is only a little sip...
why refuse?
you are right.
l have been taking this medicine for years...
why refuse now?
your mother is not well.
are you not aware?
we know, Father.
lf a person is sick, they have to be treated.
why is this unusual?
what were you trying to say just now?
father...
l would like...
on the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival...
l would like to command the lmperial Guards.
l, too, wish to gain experience.
since Prince Jai has returned...
he will assume this duty.
Jai.
present, Father.
the lmperial Guards protect our private palaces.
on the night of the Festival...
they will be under your sole command.
do you understand?
father's trust will not be misplaced.
you know what to do.
the Empress arrives.
your consort kneels before the Emperor.
do you know why l summoned you?
today...
you acted against the family's wishes.
watch closely...
l select each ingredient personally...
with utmost care.
this will cure your anemia.
l thank His Majesty for his concern.
all good medicine tastes bitter.
you have excess bile...
poor digestion...
yin and Yang are out of balance.
that is why you are fractious...
listless and lethargic...
capable of nothing but cutting remarks.
these are all symptoms of anemia.
lt has been more than ten years.
my so-called sickness...
is clearly not improving with Your Majesty's treatment.
lf your father were not the King of Liang...
l would scarcely be speaking with you...
with such restraint.
you had better understand...
that as long as l am the Emperor...
and you, the Empress...
we shall play our parts to perfection.
the lmperial Family...
has to set an example for the entire country.
for the sake of this family...
there is much that l am prepared to tolerate...
because my concern...
is to maintain law and order in the home.
chickens roost.
gentlemen to rest.
streams run clear.
lt is the Hour of the Snake.
your servant kneels before the Empress.
your Majesty's medicine for the hour is served.
thank you, Your Majesty.
do you know what day it is tomorrow?
the Chrysanthemum Festival...
the day my birth mother died.
you lost your mother when you were small...
and l was away at war much of the time.
l never took proper care of you.
this has created a distance between us...
but you have always been my favorite son.
l asked Jai to come back...
and gave him a heavy responsibility tonight.
did you wonder why?
father...
is thinking of...
making Jai the Crown Prince.
lf this makes you uncomfortable...
l shall not go ahead.
father need not worry.
l am without talent...
and do not deserve the throne.
twice in the past l begged Father to appoint another heir.
l had meant it sincerely.
father's wish is my wish.
how did you manage to sneak away?
did the Emperor grant you permission to leave for Qingzhou?
after the Festival...
if Your Highness asks again...
l am sure the Emperor will say yes.
your Highness, please do not forget...
to take Chan with you.
once there...
we shall finally be together.
lf only l could get away...
lt will happen!
her Majesty the Empress arrives!
your Majesty.
you can tell her to come out.
what did Mother say?
tell her to come out!
mother...
come out!
what is the punishment?
for seducing the Crown Prince...
trespassing into royal chambers...
by law twenty lashes of the whip...
branding of the face...
and banishment from the Palace.
your Highness, what do you suggest?
what happened here was entirely my fault.
for my sake, l beg Your Majesty...
to exercise lenience.
mother, please spare her.
fine.
l shall let her go this time...
but l do this for the sake of another, not you.
you may rise.
l am not trying to make things difficult for you.
but before the Festival...
nothing untoward must happen in the Palace.
leave me.
l have made the discovery...
your Majesty requested.
the new ingredient in your prescription...
is a black fungus from Persia.
two grams a day...
over a few months...
will cause a person to lose all their mental faculty.
thank you.
l did not do this for money.
then why did you?
the Empress may think...
that l came...
because of the generous reward...
but l came...
for my own reasons.
l hate this man.
only Your Majesty is in a position to avenge me.
l see that your face is branded.
why were you in jail?
your Majesty...
forgive my silence on this subject.
farewell.
your Highness, Prince Wan.
the Empress has already retired.
who are you?
father.
your Majesty.
this is the wife of the lmperial Doctor.
father...
this woman broke in into the Palace three days ago.
raise your head.
loosen the ties!
leave us!
Wan...
you must never speak of the events of this night.
remember!
you may rise.
lt has been twenty-five years.
l thought...
that l would never see you again.
and you married the lmperial Doctor!
at the time you were only a lowly captain...
plotting day and night to become Emperor.
you flattered the King of Liang...
into letting you marry his daughter.
you planned meticulously to have my entire family put in prison.
later...
l alone managed to escape.
far from home, l almost died.
lt was the doctor who saved me.
who then, do you think l should have married?
why did you come?
l came to see my son.
l suppose the Empress invited you.
l have never even met the Empress.
what l owe you...
l shall repay in full.
the lmperial Doctor...
has served us for many years...
with impeccable conduct, loyalty and honesty.
he is promoted to Governor of Suzhou...
also Commander of Chariots.
he will depart immediately...
with his daughter, Chan.
this is the order of His Majesty.
we thank His Majesty for his gracious favor.
your humble servant kneels before the Emperor.
before l leave...
l beg to serve Your Majesty one last time.
how long have you been with me?
your Majesty...
it has been fifteen years.
lf l have ever wronged you...
please forgive me.
your Majesty must not say such things!
your servant would willingly give his life...
your wife...
is she well?
she is.
she will accompany you to your new post.
your Majesty is too considerate.
my gratitude is without bounds.
as for the Empress's medicine...
l have prepared two months' supply.
your Majesty need only command the pharmacist...
to heat up each dose as necessary.
your consort kneels before the Emperor.
leave us.
l came to pay respects to the Crown Prince's birth mother.
today is the anniversary of her death.
for over twenty years this portrait has kept Your Majesty company.
ln your heart...
there is only one woman.
what have you come to say?
l hear...
that an assassin was captured last night...
and the Emperor spent a long time interrogating him.
ls anything wrong with that?
of course not.
l shall take my leave now.
his Highness, Prince Jai arrives.
leave us, all of you.
mother.
l have been taking your father's medicine for over ten years.
ten days ago...
he suddenly changed the formula...
and this new ingredient was added.
mother was taken ill yesterday.
was it because of this?
why is Father doing this to you?
Jai...
after the Chrysanthemum Festival...
l shall tell you the whole truth.
each day, in front of your father...
l have to feign ignorance.
every two hours...
l swallow this poison without protest.
nobody knows what is happening.
l shall die exactly as your father intends - a cretin...
but l refuse to submit without a fight.
on the night of the Festival...
l shall put an end to all of this.
do my brothers know?
no.
lf l had not come back...
would Mother have gone ahead?
Yes.
then why did you tell me?
because l want you to be Emperor.
are you going to kill Father?
l shall force him to abdicate...
but it is not my intention to kill him.
mother...
a son cannot stand in rebellion against his father!
whatever the circumstances...
he is still my father and my Emperor.
Jai...
l know that this puts you in an untenable position.
you do not have to do anything you do not want.
prayers in the Spring...
tranquillity in the Fall...
the earth yields.
lt is the Hour of the Monkey.
mother.
your son will help you.
you will never drink this poison again.
his Highness, the Crown Prince arrives!
mother summoned me.
ls anything the matter?
please leave us.
l have made a new robe for you...
different from the one last year.
l have added this chrysanthemum specially.
what does this mean?
lt will protect you from harm.
protect me?
what exactly are you plotting?
Wan...
on the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival...
you must wear this.
l will not wear it.
you must.
l refuse!
l refuse.
l refuse to wear it!
what in Heaven's name are you trying to do?
your Highness!
l received the message...
that Your Highness was coming...
and have been waiting up all night.
l came here...
to ask you something.
why was your mother at the Palace?
she came to see me.
had she visited you before?
no. Why?
do not keep anything from me.
Never!
l always tell Your Highness everything l know.
do you know why the Empress keeps embroidering chrysanthemums?
l hear they are for the Festival.
the eunuch in charge of weaving has made ten thousand flowers for her.
ten thousand?
her Majesty had them all delivered to General Wu.
of the State Army?
that's right.
how did you know?
l heard my father mention it.
what else do you know?
nothing.
Chan.
Chan.
my mother is coming. Please hide!
something is about to happen at the Palace.
l must go back.
something terrible...
your servant kneels before the Crown Prince.
your Highness, may l present my wife.
quick!
kneel down, welcome the Crown Prince!
leave!
l said leave!
how can you speak to His Highness in this way?
mom, this is the Crown Prince!
leave now! Go!
please forgive her.
your Highness...
please forgive her.
please forgive her.
l was such a fool.
l should never have let you enter the Palace.
his Highness's feelings for me are true.
the two of you...
can never be together.
but why?
no reason.
you must never see him again.
something terrible is going to happen tonight.
mom, l have to go and find him.
you dare!
what is going on?
chan, go outside.
for more than ten years...
l have never once asked you about your past.
what exactly have you been hiding from me?
where is Chan?
gone to the Palace!
you fool!
by royal command, l am the new Governor of Suzhou!
who are you?
let's go!
let's go!
you must be hiding something important from me.
quick! Go and save our daughter!
No!
his Highness the Crown Prince arrives.
when will you make your move?
so you know.
how did you find out?
lt is not your concern.
when do you plan to make your move?
the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival.
what are you afraid of?
this has nothing to do with you.
how can it have nothing to do with me?
l am the Crown Prince.
the entire country is going to think l planned it all.
so what if you did?
you lunatic!
you raving lunatic!
father is right.
you do need to take his medicine every day until you die!
get out!
lf you proceed with your insane plan...
you are asking me to die.
all you ever wanted was for me to die.
yes...
l want you to die.
Wan!
Wan!
Wan!
help!
your Majesty, fortunately the wound is not fatal.
his Highness will recover.
you must be hiding something else from me.
why are you doing this?
l have no choice.
l beg you...
please stop...
for your own good.
l know...
but l cannot do as you say.
Wan.
are you open? - You got to be a member to drink here.
a member?
a member of what?
a member of the social club.
I thought you'd just buy me a beer.
give him a beer, Frank.
nice to be back in a dry county again.
when I was sheriff, half of my take-home pay...
.was from collecting taxes on illegal jukes like this.
probably works the same here.
I would think you'd haul in a tidy penny here, winking at the bootleggers.
I wouldn't know nothing about that.
yeah... A tidy penny.
got anything stronger than this, Deputy? - No. No, we ain't.
Oh?
you know, in Thornton, Mississippi, there's a joy-juice still in every yard.
all you need is just some corn and sugar and a pot to boil it in.
I was trying to fingerprint this old boy once.
he'd had his hand in the mash barrel all his life.
there was no skin at all on there. No prints.
we ain't interested in your good ol' Mississippi boy stories.
you ain't from here no more.
why'd you leave, anyway? - I just wanted a change of scenery.
the grits started leaving a bad taste in my mouth.
well, if that's how you feel about it, Mr FBI Man,...
.why don't you get back to your commie, nigger-loving bosses up North?
you must not know my boss - Mr Hoover.
he's not too fond of commies. He'd be on your side there.
I don't give two shits whose side your Mr Hoover's on, boy.
all I know is we got 5, 000 niggers in this county Who ain't registered to vote yet.
and, as far as I'm concerned, they never will.
so tell your stiff suits up in Washington, DC, they ain't gonna change us one bit.
unless it's over my dead body. Or a lot of dead niggers.
you'd kill, Frank? ls that what you're saying?
I wouldn't give it no more thought than wringing a cat's neck.
and there ain't a court in Mississippi that'd convict me for it.
how about you, Deputy?
how are you with wringing necks, huh? - Just keep pushing me, Hoover boy.
you get this straight, you cornhole fucker.
tell your queer-ass bosses they'll never find them civil rightsters down here.
so you might as well pack your bags and head up North where you belong.
you get this straight, shitkicker.
don't you go mistaking me for some whole other body.
your brain's in your dick if you think we'll just fade away.
we're gonna be here till this thing's finished.
how about you, Deputy?
is that gun just for show?
or do you get to shoot people once in a while?
thanks for the beer.
ask them ifthey want to help save this country from the onslaught ofintegration.
you know the system: they want to throw white children and coloured children...
.into the melting pot ofintegration,...
.out ofwhich will come a conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel class ofpeople!
both races will be destroyed in such a movement.
I, for one, under God will die before I'll yield one inch...
.To that kind ofa movement in America.
do you know the trouble you've caused?
they've been on the radio all day, talking about FBI intimidation.
we're not thugs, Mr Anderson. We're gonna do this thing my way.
I know. Bureau procedure. - Why were you at the beauty parlour?
if that was Bureau business, I wanna know about it. If not, I won't allow it.
do you understand me?! - Get in here!
you know your problem? You don't know when to speak and when to shut up!
that makes you a fool!
Mrs Pell won't say anything her husband doesn't want her to.
and I'm not gonna choke it out of her!
this can of worms only opens from the inside.
I know that.
freedom! Freedom!
white nigger!
white niggers!
hurry up! Hurry up!
freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
20 cents?
freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
bring him ' Yourburdens ' Seek not his favour ' Tell... tell him yoursorrows - Hi. - Hey, now!
just passing by. Just saying hello. You're not out watching the parade?
how come you don't ask me questions? Everybody's been talked to 'cept me.
why don't you send some of them good-looking FBI boys to talk to me?
sorry about the intrusion. I was at the hardware store and...
pecan? - I'm sick of pecans.
freedom! Freedom!
are you willing to stand and fight? - Yes!
how'd you find out about this?
bureau procedure, Mr Ward.
sheriff Stuckey.
he got his phone call.
wonder who else was called.
where you going, boy?
go on. Get outta here.
here they come.
come on. Let's go. - We'll wait until they go back inside.
get him!
get him into the goddamn truck!
get inside, you sons of bitches.
let's go! - Wait until they go back inside!
come on, Ward. Let's go. Come on!
go on!
turn left! - How do you know?
I don't. Just turn left.
there's the truck.
go up that little road there.
stop, stop.
what's wrong with these people?
Mrs Walker, I know this is difficult for you, but I really need your help.
if you could just persuade your son to press charges,...
.then we could pick up the deputy at least, right away.
he won't talk to no one.
and it won't do no good anyway. - I promise you, it will.
leave him alone.
maybe then they'll let us alone.
if this is a pattern, I guess at least we know what happened on June 21st.
pell stopped the three boys for speeding at three o'clock.
he held them in jail until the Klan could get organised.
then he released 'em at 10. 30. By that time, his buddies were ready and waiting.
no. Pell went with 'em that night. I'm sure of it.
do you think he'll crack?
down here they say rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.
did you release the three civil rights workers...
no.
are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan? - No.
have you ever been a member? - No.
are you familiar with the term Grand Cyclops?
I've heard of it.
were you in fact the Grand Cyclops of the East Mississippi Klavern...
objection. My client's already told you, he's not even a member of the Klan.
objection? This is just an interview, sir. There's really no need to be so formal.
well, if this is just an interview, I guess I don't have to stay here. I got work to do.
I guess you do too, don't you? - Yes, sir. You can be sure that we'll do it.
good luck.
y'all get enough to indict me, you know where to find me.
how'd it go? - Fine. Just fine.
don't you worry about a goddamn thing.
are you about to be indicted?
does the FBI have evidence against the sheriff's office?
are you cooperating with them? - We're cooperating. We have all along.
there's not one iota of proof.
could you not do that, please? Sir, do not do that, please.
you've already been told once! Get the fuck outta here!
do we have to tell you 2, 000 times? Go back where you belong!
get outta my face!
get on outta here and leave us alone! Leave us alone!
go on home where you belong, boy! You're gonna get hurt!
mr Ward, this is getting to be about as much as we can take.
I cannot register a stronger complaint. - Not now, sir.
now, just a minute. I resent your public pursuit of my sheriff's department.
you have made every effort to implicate them in these disappearances.
your slimy innuendoes are not evidence that they were connected with any crime.
we're trying to get to the truth. We're frustrated too.
any jackass can point a finger, but that ain't evidence.
us old cotton-choppers are still stupid enough to believe in democracy.
we know our rights under the law! - You know something, all right.
I'd bet a cotton-chopping dollar on that. - You're getting so far up my nose,...
.l'm beginning to feel your boots on my chin.
and I'm telling you one more time, Mr Apple Red.
a couple of crazies in bedsheets dancing round the countryside scaring Negroes...
.is not the fault of the entire state of Mississippi!
there are three dead kids and a lot of scared people because of your sheriff.
so get used to having us around. - Get used to my boots on your chin too.
and you people better back off.
goddamn FBl. Who do they think they are, coming to my part of the country...
do you have a statement, Mr Mayor? - Goddamn right I have.
for a moment there, Mr Anderson,...
.it sounded like we were both on the same side.
are you all right, honey? - Yeah, I'm fine.
let me know if you need anything. - Thanks. I will.
Momma! Come quick!
there's no sign of him, sir. He's long gone.
his mother lives across the street. She won't even answer the door.
I want the whole area covered. Someone must have seen something.
they won't talk to us. - Get going, Mr Bird.
if they won't talk to us, shake it out of 'em.
let's go. Every house. Come on.
what?
all these white guys chasing around with their notebooks will get you nowhere.
OK. What would you do?
it's OK to be afraid.
go on, Willie. Tell 'em what you saw.
the defendants will rise.
in this country a man's home is his castle.
that is one of the principles by which this community survives.
you men have done violence to that principle.
but I want you to know that the court understands...
.That the crimes you have committed have been, to some extent at least,...
.brought about by... outside influences.
outsiders have come into Jessup County...
.and they've been people of low morality,...
.and unhygienic.
and their presence here has provoked a lot of people.
so the court understands,...
.without condoning them, mind you,...
.That the crimes to which you men have pled guilty...
.were, to some extent at least, provoked by these outside influences.
so, with all this, I'm gonna make your punishment light.
I'm gonna sentence you each to five years' imprisonment.
but I'm gonna suspend these sentences.
you can't go in there, sir.
FBl. Let us through.
I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there.
sheriff?
y'all really started something this time.
move these cars. I wanna go in and talk to them.
you've gone as far as you're gonna go. - We can handle this.
just some crazy coloureds tearing up their own assholes.
local problem.
look at those flames, Mr Ward. That's why they sent you down here, wasn't it?
it would've happened anyway and you know it.
if I was a Negro, I'd probably think the same way they do.
if you were a Negro, nobody'd give a damn what you thought.
Aaron! Take your momma, grandmomma and the children out the back door.
when you hit the road, keep going. You understand? Keep going, son.
Nathan! Come on, Nathan. Get up!
get up, Nathan, now! Come on! Get out of the bed!
what's happening? - Momma! Come on, Momma.
come on, y'all.
come on, Grandma. Let's go!
all ye who labour
who's there? lf you're in there, come on out! You hear?
I ain't taking this shit no more!
bring him yourburdens ' Seek not his favour ' Tell... tell him yoursorrows ' ln... him... confiide ' He satisfiies ' He satisfiies
everything's OK, Papa.
momma and the girls are fine.
they just cracked your head some. You just keep on breathing.
don't you go dying on me now.
you hear me?
you gonna be just fine.
you know, cows won't run away. No one knows why. They're just stupid, I guess.
they just stand there until their bellies swell up and they pop.
they have relatives in Detroit.
are they gonna go? - I didn't give 'em any choice.
at least we know who did this.
we did. - Well, don't fret. It's progress.
20 years ago they'd have strung 'em up for stealing a watermelon.
I don't understand you, Mr Anderson. Not at all.
let's get something straight, all right?
this thing was fucked up the moment we turned it into a show for the newsmen.
the moment those three kids disappeared, it was news.
the moment the three civil rights workers disappeared, it was news.
to me they're just kids. They're still missing.
what's missing... is the 50 minutes Pell said he was with his wife.
OK.
I love Mississippi.
they...
they hate Mississippi.
they hate us because we present a shining example...
these Northern students, with their atheist, communist bosses,...
.That have come into our community this summer with the wish to destroy it,...
.this week have taken a terrible blow.
this week their cause has been crippled.
this week all of these federal policemen you see out here prying into our lives,...
.violating our civil liberties,...
.have learned that they are powerless against us...
.if every single Anglo-Saxon Christian one of us stands together!
this week...
ward? - We have company, sir.
why are you here? This is a political meeting.
doesn't smell that way to me, Deputy. - It's a political meeting, Hoover boy.
Oh, it looks like a political meeting but smells more like Klan to me,...
.with or without the Halloween costumes.
gentlemen.
in the courts of Mississippi, they have been reminded...
.That they cannot by force turn our communities...
.into replicas of theircommunities.
communities in which Negroes run riot, unrestrained and unpunished,...
.as they do this summer in the streets of Harlem, or in the streets of Oakland,...
.or in the streets of Chicago!
can I come in?
it's not good for you to be here.
Why? - It's ugly.
this whole thing is so ugly.
have you any idea what it's like to live with all this?
people look at us... and only see bigots and racists.
hatred isn't something you're born with.
it gets taught.
at school they said segregation is what it said in the Bible.
genesis 9, verse 27.
at seven years of age, you get told it enough times, you believe it.
you believe the hatred.
you live it. You breathe it.
you marry it.
my husband drove one of the cars that night.
Shh. - That's what you wanna hear, isn't it?
the bodies are buried on the Roberts farm, in an earthen dam.
sir!
take a break, Mr Bird.
put some handkerchiefs around your face.
bring that here.
the bodies of the three civil rights workers were found today...
neither the FBI nor the sheriff's department will comment on the case.
the bodies were brought to Jessup County Hospital.
officials here also refused comment.
there is speculation that an autopsy will be performed later tonight.
OK, keep it open. We're coming through.
come on, open it up.
hold it back.
clinton, you got problems at home to tend to.
what do you mean?
I mean pull your head out of your ass and get home!
I, Vincent Thompson, am the cheddar-cheese champion ofthe world.
in international competition with 42 other entries, my cheddar won fiirstprize...
.based on flavour, texture, appearance and colour.
Hey, Clinton. I didn't expect you home so early.
Hi, Frank.
no, don't. I'm sorry.
sir.
say again?
I'll be right there.
mr Bird. - Yes, sir?
get five men and meet me outside.
Where's Anderson? - He's at the motel, sir.
you two take the front door. If anyone tries to get past you, break 'em down.
you two take the door on the corridor. Mr Bird?
OK. Go get Anderson. Bring him here.
don't tell him why. Don't tell him anything. Just get him here.
mr Anderson. Stop!
mr Anderson! - Go to hell.
I'm telling you to stop and I mean it. We're not killers.
it's the difference between them and us. - No, between them and you!
you're no more like them than I am. - Wrong.
what do you care what I do to a bastard hiding behind a sheriff's badge?
you have the whole world to change! - And I'm changing it.
you're as arrogant as you are stupid! - You're changing it too.
I'll make some changes right now!
don't mess this up just because you like fooling around with witnesses.
a gun don't mean shit unless you use it.
I'll kill you now if you don't listen to me. - Fuck you.
let me go. Let me go.
we'll go after all of 'em, together. - You wouldn't know how!
you'll teach me. - You don't have the guts.
not only do I have the guts, I have the authority.
what is that supposed to mean?
new rules. We nail 'em any way we can. Even your way.
is this you talking or some guy pulling your strings?
both.
we do it my way. - Your way.
with my people! - Whatever it takes.
OK.
gimme a minute.
you think he would've shot me? - Oh, yes, sir.
he's a ballsy little bastard, isn't he?
they want me to say "Let us not forget...
.That two white boys also died helping Negroes help themselves.
they want me to say "We mourn with the mothers of these two white boys.
but the state of Mississippi won't even allow these white boys...
.To be buried in the same cemetery as this Negro boy.
I say I have no more love to give.
I have only angerin my heart today,...
.and I want you to be angry with me!
now, I am sick and I am tired,...
.and I want you to be sick and tired with me!
I... I... I am sick and tired ofgoing to the funerals...
.ofblack men who have been murdered by white men!
I... I am sick and tired ofthe people ofthis country...
.who continue to allow these things to happen!
what is an "inalienable right" ifyou are a Negro?
what does it mean, "equal treatment under the law"?
what does it mean, "Iiberty andjustice forall"?
now I say to these people:
look at the face ofthis young man and you will see the face ofa black man.
but, ifyou look at the bloodshed, it is red. It is like yours!
it isjust like yours!
you...
I'm gonna tell you a story.
a young kid named Homer Wilkes lives about 30 miles north of here.
he'd just taken his girlfriend home and was walking back along the road...
.When a car pulled up.
three white boys took him for a ride.
now...
.he hadn't done anything,...
.except...
.be a Negro.
and they took him to a shack.
a shack like... Iike this one.
and they took out a razor blade,...
.a regular old razor blade, like this one,...
.and they pulled down his pants...
.and they spread his legs...
.and they sliced off his scrotum.
put it in a coffee cup.
and do you know how much you bleed when somebody cuts off your balls?
huh?!
when they found Homer, he looked like he'd been dipped in blood up to his waist.
he was barely alive when they got him to the hospital.
he can hardly walk now.
mayor, we know you know...
.who was there when those three civil rights boys was murdered.
we know you know who pulled the trigger.
is there something you wanna say to me?
OK!
is he with the Bureau? - Yeah. He's kind of a specialist.
you're sure the mayor won't talk? - No, they'd kill him!
all right. What do you have?
there were three cars and seven men. Pell and Bailey did the killing.
sheriff Stuckey? - He was too smart to be there.
so Pell pulled the trigger for him. - And Townley?
it was his idea. Grand Dragons, they don't get their hands dirty.
the whole thing, huh? Bullet by bullet.
I don't suppose you're interested in words like "coercion" or "hearsay" or "duress."
this is no good in court.
we're not in court, Mr Ward. We'll never get 'em on murder anyway.
that's a state charge. These hayseeds will never prosecute.
I know that! - We've got to get 'em in federal court!
violation of civil rights! - Remember whose rights you're violating!
don't put me on your perch, Mr Ward! - Don't drag me into your gutter!
these people crawled out of a sewer, Mr Ward!
and maybe the gutter's where we should be!
thank you.
this better be important.
who the hell called this meeting?
we thought you did. - Of this group? Are you stupid?
you didn't call this? Shit.
if you didn't call this, who the fuck did? - Shut up.
is this some kind of bullshit setup? Ray, are you sure you didn't call this?
cos I got a note from my wife and it said it was from you and Clinton.
Lester, shut up!
now, we're all gonna walk straight outta here...
.and say nothing.
that means nothing, Lester.
first one who opens his mouth is dead. - Shut up.
Hey, Clinton.
Clinton.
looks like the rattlesnakes are starting to commit suicide.
Hi, Lester.
we'll give you that ride home.
what?
well, I know you said 4. 30 but we're running a little late, so...
I'll meet you in the car. - You're cracked.
do you have change of a 20?
sure.
get in the car, Lester.
or you'll have a hard time picking your nose once I've closed this drawer.
Lester, you could make it a lot easier on yourself by going on the record right now.
I ain't got nothing to say. You barking up the wrong tree, mister.
Lester, I gotta tell you something. We got you cold.
your buddies have already talked.
you're lying.
you're in a lot of trouble. We know you drove the second vehicle, the green truck.
and your buddy says... Refresh my memory here, Mr Bird.
Lester Cowens kicked the Negro twice in the face and then shot him.
that's a goddamn lie. - No, it's true. What else, Mr Bird?
Lester Cowens said 'They only left me a nigger, but at least I shot me a nigger."'
I didn't kill him. I shot him in the ass. - We know that.
he was already dead by the time you shot him. But your buddy sees it differently.
your buddy tells it that you killed the kid. You either go on the record right now...
.or it's gonna be your ass we're talking about, not just a black kid's!
think about it, Lester. Come on out of there.
come on out.
this is tricky.
they make it look so easy, don't they?
I got a question for you, Clinton.
you don't mind if I call you Clinton, do you?
I feel like I know you so well.
the way we have it, on the night of the murders...
.you made a short speech as the bulldozer buried the kids in the dam.
how does Lester tell it?
mississippi will be proud of you. You've struck a blow for the white man.
is that what you said, Clinton? Hm?
is that what you said?
it must've been you...
.because Clayton Townley and Ray Stuckey were too smart to be there.
and you was too stupid to think anybody'd remember what you said.
but old Lester, he got a good memory.
I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a long time.
did you make a speech the night that you beat up your wife, Clinton? Huh?
did ya?
did you strike a blow for the white man that night?
you got a stupid smile. You know that, Pell?
can you see it? Huh? Good!
did you smile when the bulldozer ran over the black kid's body? Did ya?!
did you smile when the bodies were covered over? Did ya?!
get up here. Come on. Get up!
did you smile that same stupid smile, huh?!
did ya?! You...
did ya smile, Pell? Did ya smile?!
huh?! Did ya?!
make no mistake about it, Deputy.
I'll cut your fucking head off and not give a shit how it reads in the report sheet.
one more bite. One more bite.
one more bite, darling. One more bite.
shit, Lester! What the fuck is going on?! - Shut up!
get in the bedroom and lock the door! And stay away from the windows!
shit.
please. Please! I didn't say a thing!
I swear! It's a setup! I didn't say nothing! I didn't say nothing!
nothing! I didn't say nothing! I didn't say nothing!
I didn't say nothing!
you're lucky we've been watching your ass, Lester.
if you go on the record, Mr Cowens, we'll give you protection. If not...
if not, they're gonna kill you anyway.
Oh. You need a toilet, Lester.
we really had him going, huh?
we'll take care of the check, Mr Swilley.
well, I suppose I'll... be back for supper.
button up, Wesley.
why did he do it?
he wasn't even in on it. Wasn't even Klan.
mr Bird, he was guilty.
anyone's guilty who watches this happen and pretends it isn't.
no. He was guilty all right.
just as guilty as the fanatics who pulled the trigger.
maybe we all are.
Hello!
Yeah.
I just missed you at the hospital. They said you'd gone home.
what's left of it.
I'm real sorry. - So am l.
what are you gonna do? - I don't know.
where will you go? - I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying.
this is my home. Born here.
probably die here.
if I wanted to leave, I would've done it a long time ago.
things'll work out.
there's enough good people around here know what I did was right.
and enough ladies like the way I fix their hair.
Hey.
if you're ever in Des Moines,...
.don't send me a postcard.
OK.

I mean when I beat her on the roof?
shut up, fuckers!

Hey, here's your wife's face.
Doo-il, come here!

Doo-il, tell me.

Yes.

Doo-il, think...

he's never seen it, but told you he did.
Doo-il, when did you see?
tell me exact date.
if he said so, that's it.
how can he remember the date?
you never remember!
Doo-il's Mom was the best for you.
live with her then! You can't say that!
this bastard is crazy.
you don't know marriage life.
you should beg your wife sometimes.
you're too stubborn.
you insist black while people say it's white.
I can insist black if I'm right.
I can't agree with what's wrong.
I can't agree with what's wrong.
hurrah Hak-ie.
hurrah Hak-ie.
hands down, mother fuckers.
no, not again.
you can't say 'no' again either.
listen to me, ok?!
you're dead. Mom'll kill you.
what, brat? I'm not late.
behave yourself!
you want to get killed?
chasing woman mak... makes you...
you frustrate me...
make you screwed!
mom, I'm home.
eat supper before leaving.
what supper... no need!
I am leaving, mom.
don't ever come again.
Bye.
busy today?
are you ever interested?
give me, I'll do that. - Don't touch that!
if you like your friends so much, break up with Soo-kyung too.
you're always saying stuff like that.
you've dated her for 4 yrs, and have been engaged for 2 yrs.
I'll marry this year.
it's too late though. Marry right away!
have you washed them clean?
chief!
you feel fresh?
what brought you here?
nothing special, about Kyung-ah...
sit down and take these flowers first.
these are to apologize...
it's my first time giving flowers to a woman.
can you just treat me as a sister?
I tried, but not that easy...
I tried, but not that easy...
I'll move to another bar, then.
you can't say shit like that.
I'm sorry, but I can' help it.
fuck!
OK then. I won't bother you, so don't move.
don't ever show up with your boyfriend.
if I see that, I'll eat you up.
let's see what will happen.
next song is 'Bye-bye'.
Why? I'll give you a tip.
you can push the button...
that's not fun! Next song!
sit down for a sec.
Why?
come here.
when will you marry?
I said I will.
When?!
whenever I'm ready!
ready?
I know it's because of your friends!
if you marry late, it's not good for the baby.
what baby? I can't even take care of myself.
marry her right away!
I'll get you an apartment.
I'll take care of it.
be careful when you ride your motorcycle.
why did you catch the damn cold?
don't need to bother...
I'm good at this.
delicious?
Yes.
tomorrow's Min-gu's birthday...
he'll treat us well. If not, I'll kill him.
you'll bring me there, right?
you should go to school.
will you bring Soo-Kyung instead?
she finishes her work late.
we gather early in the evening.
behave yourself, OK?
what again? Bitch...
never let me notice although you date her. Got it, bastard?
why must she come when
I'm out with the boys?
he's being mean again.
when did I do that?
why are you saying stuff like that?
go marry if you want, but don't talk of marriage in front of me.
how long will you do this kind of work?
if you get me money, I won't.
learn some skills, so I can get you an hair salon after a year.
OK.
stop saying 'OK', just do it.
you put it off for a year already.
you should lead your life.
so, you're giving me a salon, and telling me to fuck off?
no, I didn't mean it that way...
what else could you mean?
I know you will marry Soo-kyung.
but why do you emphasize that?!
I didn't emphasize that!
you think I am nuts?
you keep mentioning Soo-kyung.
why marry Soo-kyung? Not me?
I met her before you...
a year?
then you should be engaged with me if you knew me first.
right.
you said you love me.
knowing someone early doesn't mean anything.
tell me why it must be Soo-kyung as your wife.
when I met Soo-kyung...
it's enough, shit!
she was a virgin? Is it the reason?
no one's virgin these days.
she might be a whore.
you..., fuck!
virgin or whore might be the same for you.
fuck!
you, don't ever call me.
get out!
don't you dare say bad things about Soo-kyung.
fuck you...
live your life as you want!
you want to get screwed?
fuck off, you mother fucker!
I've never seen a crazy bitch like you.
say hello properly, you bastard!
you know I like you.
I'm fucking pissed off.
what make you like that this time?
because of Youn-ah.
I had better end things with her.
she asked me why I don't marry her.
right, what's the reason? I am also curious, bastard.
what?
Youn-ah is best for you.
she's nice, sexy and too good to you.
we think Youn-ah's better than Soo-kyung.
you fucking crazy bastard!
you never gonna leave Youn-ah.
you need her whenever you're in trouble.
you call her when you're sick, hungry, and even horny.
you just pay back my money, fucker!
don't wring money out of woman, bastard!
shit, this rotten bastard!
stop it. Bastards!
Joon-Hee, stop! Here's a restaurant.
Hey! I bring up a gun.
Hey! Put this book back in its place!
fuck you... - Bastard!
wake up! Youn-ah's ready for our meal.
Ugh, stink!
this brat was snoring the whole night.
when did I snore?
where are you going?
I gotta go.
no way!
I broke up with that bitch. I am not going, no.
Hey!
I won't beg you to see me again. So just eat up and go.
I don't want to...
Ugh. Idiot. - Ouch!
let's go eat!
behave yourselves, bastards!
you, sons of bitches!
I love you Young-woon.
ditto, Youn-ah!
Ah... shit!
Oh my goodness!!
cool...
get back to work!
ms Choi, how much do you collect today?
2. 5M won, why?
bring it here.
Hey!
no, if you do that again, I'll be fired.
I see, I won't get you fired. Come on, bring it to me!
I don't have a key for the safety box.
Oh my... these bitches...
ms Kim! Go get Director Lee.
why are you sitting there, not working? Chief Kang!
Lee, get me the key, I'm busy.
what key?
cut the crap, and step aside.
why do you keep my family's key?
don't try to do that. Company is badly off.
you are so funny.
my family goes bankrupt, not you!
shut the fuck up. Just get me the key.
go get approved by boss then!
father's not here now!
I know you're a good worker, I do know!
I will get approved soon, so get me the key!
no, I can't!
Lee! Hey you!
Gee... no...
don't bother me, ok?
I'll be laid off, no...
this crazy bitch... - Ouch!!
hold it tight, dude!
I'm holding, I like you, man!
Wow! Look at this money!
Hurrah!
Min-gu is the best!
Hey, Mr. Bartender!
I'll see you.
come here, darlin! - Read 'em.
sheriff. - Evening, Sheriff.
pleasure doin' business with ya... - Lyin' cheat!
Oh, my God!
mama, it's getting late.
come here by Mama.
do you think...
pa and Kathy are watching over us?
Yes, sweetheart, I do.
is there anything you want to say to them before we go?
I love you, and I miss you every day.
why don't you go on ahead? I'll be there in a minute. Okay?
it seems wrong to leave you here, Willie.
and I know that you and Kathy will look after each other.
and no matter how far away I am...
you will always be in my heart.
I'll see you again.
pa and I are going to Pennsylvania to see my sister and her husband.
who are you going to visit? - We're not visiting anyone.
we're going to live with my grandpa and grandma.
you're leaving home?
my pa was the sheriff of Tettsford Junction.
he got himself killed a couple years back.
gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, look, Maddy.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Whoa!
Whoa! - Maddy!
Hey, Pa!
I missed you! - Oh, I missed you so much!
come here, young man! - Grandpa!
grandma!
my, my, my, Maddy. How you have grown.
and looking more like your father with every year.
do you really think so, Grandma?
I really do, sweetie.
I bet you're hot and thirsty.
there's fresh-churned buttermilk inside. - All right!
welcome home, Missie.
it's good to be home, Mama. I just wish...
I know. I know.
let's see what you do now. Your move.
Yeah, right. King me!
somebody's been practicing. - Yes, I have.
your father found you a house in town.
it's small and it needs some work...
but it's near the school and the rent is reasonable.
good. On my teacher's pay I can't afford much.
I really wish you'd reconsider staying with us...
at least for a little while.
do you need the help, Mama? - No.
I really appreciate you and Papa wanting to help me and Maddy.
but I need to stand on my own two feet right now.
Maddy needs to see that even though his daddy's gone...
he still has one parent strong enough to take care of him.
the other day...
Maddy asked me what color his father's eyes were.
he couldn't remember.
Maddy might forget details like that...
but he won't forget the things his father did with him or the things Willie taught him.
I'm starting to forget little things about Willie too.
like that last morning when we said good-bye.
did I kiss him? I think I did, but I don't remember.
it's only been three years, Mama.
just like with Maddy, you'll remember the things that mattered...
like how much you and Willie loved each other.
no one will ever love me that way again.
and I will never love anyone else.
I can't imagine being truly happy again.
that's how I felt when my first husband died.
and then I met your father.
see, I feel if I were to love someone else...
that I would be betraying Willie in some way.
Willie would want you to be happy.
whoa. Whoa.
it's gonna take a bit of work, but I can help you out with that, Missie.
that's all right, Pa. It's gonna be just fine.
Maddy. Look what I found.
it's our Christmas star.
I promise you, Maddy, I will make this into a nice place.
it won't be like home though.
do you know what makes a house a home?
no.
home is where you'll always have a place...
where you will always feel loved...
and where you will never, ever be alone.
it might not seem like it now, Maddy, but...
this place will come to feel like home.
come here.
o Lord, how manifold are your works.
we thank you for the sun and the rain...
which help nourish the crops...
and help them grow into sustenance for our minds and bodies.
in wisdom you have made them all. Amen.
Amen! - I have an announcement.
I received this notice from the Children's Aid Society of New York.
and it says, Wanted: Homes for children.
a company of homeless children from the East will arrive on Friday.
these children are of various ages and of both sexes...
having been thrown friendless upon the world.
we seek good homes with decent families who will love them as their own.
distribution of these children will take place right here at the church.
I know I can count on all of you to open your hearts to these precious children of God.
God bless you all.
pastor Joe! Hi!
well, I've heard a lot about you, Missie. - Oh. All good, I trust.
your father thinks the world of you.
seems we're neighbors.
my husband and I are just two farms away from your new house.
all right. See you tomorrow morning!
pastor. - Ah, Mrs. Pettis.
morning, Sheriff. - Sheriff.
we missed you at Sunday services today.
Clara!
he should be comin! - That's his choice.
I know. I know.
we'll see ya. - Bye.
sheriff Tyler couldn't be bothered to attend church.
again.
well, he's pretty busy keeping the peace.
we should be going, Mrs. Pettis.
well, it looks like your husband had a reason for not showing his face in church as well.
there is much work to be done on the farm...
and we can't afford hired help.
if my husband doesn't do the work, we don't eat come winter.
good day, ma'am. I'm Sheriff Tyler.
Hello, Sheriff. I'm Mrs. LaHaye.
Yes, I know. Small town. Word gets around.
I heard about the new teacher. - What else have you heard?
your folks are Clark and Marty Davis, and you have a little boy.
Maddy. - Maddy.
pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. LaHaye.
could I have some more, Grandma?
Mmm. Maddy. - It's all right, Missie. Sure you can.
you spoil him.
of course I do. It's my job as a grandma.
so tell me more about this orphan train Pastor Joe was talking about.
now, Marty, you know you're not well enough to be chasing after a child.
I will be soon. - For now, we're gonna have to let other people handle that.
would you consider taking in one of those children?
Yeah, Mom! Then I'd get to have a brother or sister!
no. - But all my friends have a bunch of brothers and sisters.
but since Kathy died, I've had none.
I'm sorry, Mama.
that's all right, Maddy.
it's good to talk about her.
we don't want to forget her. Right?
right.
don't stand so close.
but I'm scared, Lindy.
I told you... get away from me.
folks don't want a brother and sister.
whoa.
Oh, they're so cute. Don't you think?
you mean the one on the right, or on the left?
good day, Mrs. LaHaye.
Oh. Sheriff.
you gonna take one of these kids? - No.
I was just passing by, and I thought I would stop in and see how it was going.
good day.
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming today.
these children are putting their faith in the kindness of strangers like you.
let's begin with Alice Moore.
Alice, you wanna come up here next to me? - Go on.
Alice is seven years old.
she was orphaned when her parents died in an influenza epidemic.
Paul, she's the same age as Lily was when we lost her.
do you think that we could...
may we take Alice aside and get acquainted with her, Pastor?
you certainly may.
why don't you go with these nice folks?
Jonas Sykes is nine years old. His parents were killed three years ago in a fire.
Oh, he's such a nice boy.
ruth Lind is five years old.
she was left on the doorstep of the Battery Park Orphanage as an infant.
well, I'm sure certain. Let's do it. - Mm-hmm.
Hello!
next is Belinda Marshall.
she's 14 years old.
we need a boy. - The boy's too young. And scrawny.
she's older. She looks like she could handle herself on a farm.
I'll look her over, Pastor, see if she might do.
open your mouth.
Why? - I wanna make sure you're healthy.
Oh, you're spirited, huh?
that's all right. That means you're tough.
you'll be a good worker. We'll take her.
I'm not going with you! You smell! You probably haven't had a bath for a year!
watch your mouth, girl.
Ow! Geez!
she's incorrigible. - He looks healthy enough.
we'll take him. He looks like he'll grow into a good farm hand.
that isn't the point, Hank. - I thought the point was to find homes for these young 'uns.
anyone else here want 'em?
if he comes with us, he gets a decent home with plenty of good food.
and I'll see he comes to church.
the choice is yours, Jacob. You don't have to go with them.
would you rather go back to the orphanage?
no.
all right then. Sign the paper, Sheriff.
come here, boy. Come on. Let's go.
come on.
I'm sorry, child. Looks like you'll have to get back on the train.
unless someone can find room for her.
my house is small. There's barely enough room for me and Maddy.
I'm Missie LaHaye.
I'm the schoolteacher here, and I have a little boy.
I can't offer you much.
no fancy dolls or store-bought dresses.
but if you come to live with me, I'll treat you kindly.
okay?
I'll take that as a yes.
welcome to your new home.
Maddy? This is Belinda Marshall.
she's going to be living with us. - For how long?
just till I'm old enough to leave. Not a day longer.
let's just say for the foreseeable future and leave it at that for now.
you can put your things over here.
um, I'll make up a bed over here...
and hang some curtains around it for privacy.
I'd rather sleep in the shed. - Oh, no.
it's too dirty, and there's lots of broken-down old furniture and stuff.
I don't care. I'll fix it up myself.
Maddy, will you go over to Mrs. Hudson's...
and ask her if we can borrow her spare mattress just for a while?
Belinda, I would like for you to stay in the house with me and Maddy.
Why? - Because this is your home now.
Belinda, we're your family.
you're not my family. I've got a papa back in New York.
he'll be coming for me soon as he gets a job.
I won't be staying here long, so don't think I will.
this should do for now.
at least until it turns cold.
is that your family Bible?
something your parents gave you?
no.
we each got one at the orphanage.
have you read much of it?
maybe we could read a passage tonight after supper.
no.
what grade are you in, Belinda? - No grade.
I mean, in New York what's the last grade that you finished?
first. - That's as far as you've gotten in school?
I had work to do. There was no time for school.
Belinda, can you read?
what if I can't? Doesn't matter.
don't need to know how to read to sweep a floor or bake biscuits or wash clothes.
but books open up a whole world to you.
they teach you things like how much an African elephant weighs...
or how Betsy Ross came to make the first flag.
why would I need to know any of those things?
it's not just facts and history.
there are stories that touch your heart...
and make your imagination soar.
books can take you anywhere.
you could, uh, go to China or be in the court of Queen Elizabeth.
I'm going outside.
grandma! Grandpa!
Hey! - Hey, sweetheart.
hey there.
mama, Papa, this is Belinda.
welcome to the family, Belinda.
we hope that you'll come to think of us as your grandparents.
I'm not your granddaughter. - We're not trying to take the place of your grandparents.
we just think a child can't have too many people who love her.
do you have grandparents back in New York?
no. And I don't need none either.
well, I think it's just about time to sit down to supper.
Belinda. - What?
we say grace first, Belinda.
do you know what that is?
of course I do. We had to pray over our food at the orphanage.
I don't know why. - Well, it's important.
we're very fortunate. A lot of people go hungry.
bet I know that a lot better than you do.
let's bow our heads and pray.
dear Lord, we thank you for everything that you've given us...
especially for the new member of our family...
Belinda.
Amen. - Amen.
Amen. - Yeah!
let's go!
we're gonna go play with the puppies down in the barn. Do you wanna come?
no.
well, if you change your mind, you're more than welcome to join us.
getting big there, boy.
come here. - I'll beat you to the barn!
for the life of me...
I don't know what possessed me to take in that child.
I sure didn't need any more responsibility.
then why did you?
well, I didn't intend to.
but when I rode past the church that day, something stopped me.
then when I heard Pastor Joe say, "Will someone take this child?"
it was as if another voice came out of me saying, "I will."
maybe it was another's voice.
you think God was speaking through me?
I think God knew that Belinda needs you.
and maybe, for some reason that you don't understand yet, you need her.
look at her play! She's so cute!
I think he makes a nice hat. - Snowball!
there you go.
come here, boy! Come over here! Get over here!
I told you.
you tryin' to get away?
is that it? You tryin' to get away?
answer me, boy! Come here, boy! Better get over here!
you think you can just run away cause you don't like your chores?
huh? I can make you work as hard as I want!
get in there! Take your punishment! - Ow! Ow! Why?
that's rising nicely.
if I get the berries, can I use your oven to bake some pies?
pies? Of course.
is that one of your favorites, berry pie?
not mine.
my mother's.
belinda's gonna bake us some fruit pie.
that's nice.
what's the matter, Clark? - I gotta take care of somethin' for the Fletcher widow.
go back inside, Belinda.
what are you gonna do? - What I have to.
I'm coming with you. - Fletcher widow's horse broke loose.
he fell in a gully and broke his leg. She asked me to put him down for her.
you're gonna shoot an innocent animal? - Because it needs doing.
now please, go back inside.
what if the horse's leg can be fixed? Shouldn't you at least try?
why is everybody so cruel? Why doesn't God stop you?
please don't kill it! Please! - Child, listen to me.
I'll check his leg. If I can save his life, I will.
but if the bone is shattered, would you rather I leave him to be eaten alive by coyotes?
wait here, child.
Belinda, your food is getting cold.
what's the matter?
can I?
Lindy?
I brought you some food.
Maddy? - Yes?
thank you.
you're welcome.
do you think there's enough berries for a pie?
not hardly. Don't you know nothing?
I know a bunch of things. I just don't know how to make a pie.
we need a lot more berries. So quit talking and start picking.
which ones are the better, the squishy ones or the hard ones?
Maddy!
help!
Maddy!
Maddy, are you okay? Oh, my gosh.
no. My arm hurts real bad.
we have to get you into town. Can you stand? Can you stand up?
what happened? - I fell.
I can see that.
here.
let's take you over to Mrs. LaHaye's.
what happened?
Maddy, are you okay?
apparently, he fell.
I tore my clothes. I'm sorry, Mama.
it's all right, sweetheart.
will you take him inside? - Sure. Come on, little fella.
come along, Belinda.
I don't think it's too bad. It bled a lot, but it's not broken.
thank you, Sheriff. - I didn't do anything.
she managed to get him into town.
thank you, Belinda.
I'll go get a towel and a bowl of water.
sweetheart, does it hurt?
Yeah.
what is it?
nothing.
I'd best be going.
you're a very brave boy.
Missie told me about how you took care of Maddy.
how did you know how to get the bleeding to stop?
my mama taught me stuff.
she used to be a midwife, so she knew all about fixing people.
at the orphanage there were 300 kids and only one nurse...
so I helped out.
did you like doing that?
Yeah.
it made me feel good.
Belinda, have you ever thought about becoming a nurse?
me, a nurse? I don't think so.
why not?
someone like me can't do something like that.
what do you mean, someone like you?
you know.
poor.
plain old poverty can't keep you from doing something you really want to do.
only poverty of spirit can do that.
my mama always wanted to be a nurse.
she never got the chance to.
your mama was never able to pursue her dream.
I think she'd be very proud if you were able to do something she couldn't.
no matter how early we leave, we are always running late.
is that why we're always running?
what's the matter with you, boy?
we ain't got money to go wasting on your clumsiness!
Hello, Mr. Pettis. - Mrs. LaHaye.
jacob only tripped. It was an accident.
money's tight, Mrs. LaHaye. Couple more "accidents" might well put me in the poorhouse.
and you might want to keep an eye on your own young 'uns.
let's go.
ready? Set? Go!
run!
go, Sam! - You have to win!
go! Go! Go! Go!
can I play?
course not. - Why not?
nobody likes you. That's why.
you're just a no-account orphan.
you take that back, liar!
all right. That's enough.
get up.
I said, that's enough.
now, someone wanna tell me what happened here?
how about you and I go over here and talk?
it wasn't my fault! I didn't start it!
I know that Stevens boy well enough to be pretty sure he did or said something mean.
you wanna tell me what that was?
must have been pretty bad if you don't wanna say.
he just...
he wouldn't let me play, is all.
it's hard being the outsider.
I imagine your whole life's pretty hard right now. But you can't give up.
I can run faster than all of them.
I bet you can. Why don't you go back there and show 'em? Go on.
go!
I can outrun any of you.
no, you can't. You're a girl.
Yeah, and you're a stupid bully, but I can still outrun you.
you wanna get beat bad? Come on in.
once around the old oak.
ready? Set? Go!
come on!
recess is over. Everybody back inside.
next time I want you on my team. Okay? - Good job.
why do I get the feeling that something just happened and you were a part of it?
nothing I couldn't handle, ma'am.
if I were you, I'd keep an eye on that Belinda.
if she does run, you're not gonna catch her.
Hey, Mr. Bartender!
I'll see you.
come here, darlin'!! - Read 'em.
sheriff. - Evening, Sheriff.
pleasure doin' business with ya... - Lyin' cheat!
I brought food.
it smells really good. - You gotta hide it from 'em.
I'll put it under my bed.
I'll try to bring something better tomorrow night.
I hate it here, Lindy. He hits me, and she yells at me.
I don't want to stay. Can't I come live with you?
I don't know how Mrs. LaHaye would feel about that.
and even if she were okay with it...
Mr. And Mrs. Pettis probably wouldn't let her take you.
I miss you somethin' awful.
let's run away from here right now.
jacob, you know we can't leave.
even if we could leave...
how would Papa find us?
least this way, the orphanage can tell him we were sent here.
I promise I'll get you out of here, Jacob.
it just can't be tonight.
you're gonna leave me again?
I'll never leave you longer than I have to.
I'll be back tomorrow. Okay?
at least you're safe, thank God.
look, it is late and we are both exhausted...
so we will talk about this in the morning.
now go to bed, Belinda.
last night wasn't the first time you sneaked out, was it?
I want to know where you went and why you stole food.
members of a family need to trust each other.
so? - I don't understand.
what do you want?
I have to stay here.
if you don't want me, I can find work somewhere.
I'm a hard worker. All I ask for is food and a bed.
Belinda, I want you.
my family wants you.
and I'm not gonna send you to work when you should go to school and be a child.
I ain't been a child for a long time.
I'm worried about her safety.
I'll keep a close watch over her, of course, but I can't stay up all night, every night.
and if she's determined to sneak out, she's going to just do it.
instead of trying to stop something you can't stop, just let her go and...
let her go? Have you lost your mind? - You didn't let me finish.
let her go and follow her. See what this is all about.
it may be nothing. She could be sneaking out just to prove she doesn't have to stay with you.
or... - Or it could be something serious.
something dangerous, even.
there's only one way to find out.
Shh.
what are you doing here?
same thing you are. Finding out what that little girl's doing.
brought peaches.
Oh, boy. Ain't had nothing like this in a long time.
how are you doing? - He hit me again.
I didn't do nothin'.
I just didn't move fast enough when Mrs. Pettis told me to fetch somethin'.
jacob, I'll get you out of here just as soon as I can.
I hope that's soon, Lindy.
good night, Jacob.
Belinda, why have you been sneaking out to see Jacob?
and why are you bringing him food?
we need the truth now, Belinda.
it'll be better for you to get it all out.
jacob looked thinner than when I saw him the last time.
are Mr. And Mrs. Pettis treating him right?
we need the real story. - It's not a story! It's true!
they're being real mean to Jacob!
what's Jacob's last name?
is it Marshall?
is Jacob your brother?
Belinda, why did you keep this a secret?
at the other towns the train stopped at...
I saw brothers and sisters having a real hard time.
most folks only want one kid.
and others feel bad about breaking up families...
so they don't take any kid.
I would have taken both of you, Belinda.
you say that now, but you know you wouldn't have wanted more than one kid.
jacob had a better chance on his own.
Why?
cause he's younger.
folks want younger kids.
once you get to be around my age, it's harder to find people that'll take 'em.
you need to go to bed.
but I promise you, Belinda...
we will go over there first thing tomorrow morning and I will talk...
Mrs. LaHaye, may I speak to you outside, please?
go to bed.
why did you stop me? I was going to tell her that we'll go get her brother out of there.
that's why I stopped you. I didn't want to get her hopes up.
so you think that I won't do what I said?
no. I know you'll try to do exactly what you said.
but when Mr. And Mrs. Pettis took Jacob, they got legal guardianship.
and unless we can prove that he's being seriously hurt, no court will interfere.
so you're not going to do anything? - I'll check the situation out.
but I gotta be careful how I handle this.
I don't wanna make Hank so mad that he takes it out on Jacob. - Well, I'm going with you.
no, you're not. - You can't stop me.
you be in my office at 8: 00 sharp.
I won't wait a minute longer. - I'll be there.
Belinda Marshall...
you are an amazing girl...
and I love you very much.
just wanna see the boy, Hank.
we know you've been mistreating him. - You watch your mouth!
let us see the boy, and we'll leave.
come on out here, boy.
you just stay right here.
jacob, I'm Sheriff Tyler, and this is Mrs. LaHaye.
Lindy's foster mama?
Yes. Your sister's very worried about you, Jacob.
she believes that Mr. And Mrs. Pettis aren't feeding you enough...
and that they're working you too hard.
is that true, Jacob?
don't be afraid of him. We won't let him hurt you. - Has he laid a hand on you?
are they feeding you enough?
you said you were going to bring him to church. Why haven't you done that?
that's enough. You got your answers, Sheriff. Now git.
Hyah!
Hyah!
I wanted to ask them why they aren't sending Jacob to school. - No law says they have to.
but... - Even parents, let alone guardians don't have to send their kids to school.
that's just wrong.
jacob needs an education if he's going to have any kind of future.
unless we can persuade Pettis of that...
jacob's future's on that farm.
you don't understand how desperately Belinda and Jacob love each other...
what it means to be separated from someone you love that deeply.
I don't think you've ever felt that way about anyone in your life...
or else you wouldn't let that happen.
Whoa!
did you see Jacob? Is he okay? Is he gonna come live here?
Belinda, I'm sorry.
sheriff Tyler and I talked to Mr. Pettis, but Jacob gonna have to stay there for now.
our papa's gonna come for us, and he's gonna get Jacob away from that terrible man!
and he's gonna take both of us home with him!
for those of you in the second grade primer, please open your books to page 13.
for the rest of you, you can continue doing your multiplication tables.
Belinda.
will you open your book to page 13?
I would like for you to read aloud.
the T... Tales...
of Pete...
Peter Ra... Ra...
rabbit.
you're doing very well. Go on.
I can't read it. - You could try.
I don't want to!
all right, class. That's enough for today.
we will pick up tomorrow where we left off.
you're excused.
she doesn't want to be part of a family.
she really resents me. Maybe even hates me.
you and I didn't take to each other at first. Remember?
and I am so ashamed about how I resented you. - It's perfectly natural.
you'd lost your mama and didn't want me to take her place. Just like with your papa and me.
I'd lost my husband and didn't want Clark to take his place.
but then you fell in love with Papa and things changed.
I fell in love with both of you.
Belinda has so much anger in her.
she's had it much harder than I did.
which is exactly why she needs you.
even if she's not ready to admit it right now, she needs what you have to give.
but I have so little to give. I can barely keep enough food on the table for Maddy and me.
those other parents that adopted those children...
they have so much to offer.
you will leave Belinda a legacy of character...
and of a love for others, and of faith.
that's a beautiful legacy.
that's the kind of legacy that lasts.
well, we've gone through all the books at school...
and all the books here...
and you can't seem to find anything that you're interested in.
there must be something that you want to be able to read.
well...
when my pa dropped me and Jacob off at the orphanage...
he pinned this letter to my dress.
I was supposed to give it to 'em, but I kept it. - Why?
these are his last words to us. They're important.
I just know it's gonna say how much he loved us and wanted to keep us...
and how he'll come back for us someday.
will you read it to me? - Oh...
Belinda, this letter is private.
it's between you children and your papa.
I can teach you how to read it.
okay, I'll learn how to read.
but will you just read it to me now?
all right.
to Whom It May Concern...
this is to certify that the biological father and only legal guardian of Belinda and Jacob Marshall...
freely and of his own will...
requests that the Children's Aid Society...
provide a home for his minor children until they are of age.
samuel Marshall promises...
not to...
interfere...
in any arrangements the Children's Aid Society may make for them.
sincerely...
uh, your father put his mark.
is that all?
I'm so sorry, Belinda.
I know it must have been very difficult for your father to give up you and Jacob.
last one to the swimmin' hole's a rotten egg!
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
Mrs. LaHaye, what's wrong?
I lost my locket. The chain must have broken.
is it valuable? - Yes.
I'm sorry. My mother gave it to me a long time ago, and it is very dear to me.
let me help you look for it.
thank you.
it's starting to get dark out here.
we can look again tomorrow.
there's no point.
it's gone.
some of this? - Cake? I'll take the biggest piece I can get.
you oughta be out there, Sheriff.
Aw, I'm not much of a dancer.
it's not how good you are. It's just an excuse to wrap your arms around a pretty girl.
why don't you ask her to dance?
you're just all right! - You're moving all right yourself!
well, maybe I will.
I love that cobbler. I'll see you later.
Mrs. LaHaye, may I have this dance?
Mrs. LaHaye?
I, um... I got some...
a peddler came through town the other day, and I got this for you.
I know it won't replace the one your mother gave you, but maybe it might make you feel better.
Zach, this looks like real gold.
well, if it isn't, I got taken.
there's enough room for two pictures... Maddy's and Belinda's.
I can't accept this.
it's just a gift. It doesn't mean anything. - That's just it.
I could only accept an expensive gift like this if it did mean something if it came from a man that I love.
could I be such a man?
no.
I know, sweetheart.
I just never wanted to feel this way again.
it was so much easier when I didn't feel anything.
unfortunately, it doesn't seem like God put us on this Earth...
to have it easy.
but he did put us here to love one another.
I'm so ashamed of myself.
I have two children at home to think of, and I'm acting like a child myself.
you're not acting like a child.
you're acting like a woman in love.
I have to get home to the children.
if there's anything your father and I can do to help... - Thank you, Mama.
thank you.
Mrs. LaHaye?
there's something I... I need to tell you.
you asked me a while back why I care so much about Belinda.
see, she reminds me of someone.
someone you loved?
Eleanor. Ellie.
we grew up together.
her daddy was the town drunk.
and when he wasn't passed out...
he was just full of meanness...
and he took it out on her.
nobody did anything?
no.
then when I finally got big enough, I... I stood up to him.
what happened? - Well, let's just say he didn't hit her again.
did you marry Ellie?
I was going to.
what happened? - Bank robbery.
she wasn't a threat in any way.
they didn't have to kill her.
but they did, and... and they got away with it.
they're alive, and...
Ellie's dead.
just no rhyme or reason to it.
Zach, I'm so sorry.
I understand your bitterness toward God.
I felt the same way once.
my husband, Willie, was the sheriff in the town that we lived in.
he was killed in the line of duty.
how did it happen?
it was stupid really.
darlin'! - Couple of men in a saloon got into a fight.
Willie went in to break it up.
should have ended with nothing worse than a black eye or two and a broken nose...
but...
one of the men pulled out a gun.
he was dead by the time I got there.
I didn't even have a chance to say good-bye.
I'm so sorry, Missie.
you must have loved him very much.
with all of my heart and soul.
we're just about done.
sure goes fast when you're not doing it alone.
grandma! Mama! Come quick!
one of the puppies won't wake up!
Aw. Poor little thing.
can I hold him for a minute? - Yeah.
you're all right now. You're all right.
Belinda! How did you do that?
Belinda?
Belinda? Oh, Belinda.
you just did an amazing thing. What's the matter?
mama didn't only have Jacob and me.
there was a baby girl.
Jenny.
I'm so sorry, honey.
I tried to take care of baby Jenny...
and to keep her warm and to get her milk...
e... even though we didn't have much money.
how old were you, Belinda?
eight.
that is far too big a responsibility for a little girl.
there wasn't anyone else to do it.
what happened to Jenny?
she got sick...
and we couldn't afford a doctor.
so one day she just...
stopped breathing, and...
and I tried to do what Mama told me to do...
like with the puppy...
but it didn't work.
it's all my fault Jenny died!
Belinda, listen to me. Sometimes things happen... terrible things.
and there is nothing that we can do about it.
you don't understand.
Yes, I do. - How can you?
because I lost a baby too.
her name was Kathy.
she was so very precious to me.
what happened to her?
she just stopped breathing.
I don't know why.
one minute she was in her cradle asleep, and then the next she...
it wasn't your fault. - I felt like it was.
I felt like there must have been some way that I could save her...
just like you thought that you could save Jenny.
but we couldn't.
it was out of our hands.
it was in God's hands.
I couldn't save Jenny...
and you couldn't save Kathy.
but we can save Jacob.
I'm going to bring you and Maddy home now.
then what? - Then I am going to get Jacob.
sheriff!
what is it? Is somethin' wrong?
I think Mrs. LaHaye may be in trouble, and it's all my fault. I made her go out there.
go where? - To get Jacob! But she's all alone, and that man is so mean.
I'm afraid he might hurt her. - You go on home, Belinda.
B...But, Sheriff... - I'll take care of this.
but I can't worry about you, too, so go on home and stay there.
if anything happens to Mrs. LaHaye...
nothing's gonna happen to her. I won't let it.
all right. What is it this time, Mrs. LaHaye?
Where's Jacob? - None of your damn business, that's where.
let him come with me. He needs to be with his sister.
surely you can see that, Mr. Pettis.
all I know is I got a good hand.
you can hire someone.
a grown man could do much more work than that little boy can.
men don't work for nothin'. That boy does.
search your heart, Mr. Pettis.
I know that somewhere deep inside, you must feel something for him.
well, now, that's where you're wrong, Mrs. LaHaye.
you are a cruel and selfish man...
and I am not going to let Jacob spend one more day in your power!
and just what do you think you can do about it? Huh?
you come on to my land, threatening me.
I'm within my rights to do whatever I want to you!
even the law can't say otherwise. - Let go of me!
let her go, Hank! - Nobody tells me what to do on my own land!
you let her go.
you can't arrest me for defending myself on my own property!
if we weren't on your property, you'd be heading to jail right now.
either way, you shoot anyone here or anywhere else, I will arrest you.
we'll let the courts decide whether it's right or wrong.
Mrs. LaHaye, come on. - But what about Jacob?
can't do anything about him right now.
he shot at you. Why didn't you arrest him?
well, that was just a warning shot.
he wanted to hit me, he would have hit me.
you were trespassing on his land, Missie.
by law, you should have been the one arrested.
Where's Jacob?
I'm sorry, Belinda, but we couldn't get him away.
why not?
we don't have the legal right.
what about Jacob's rights? - Look, I am not giving up.
I promise you that I will get Jacob back.
Hey, Mama. - Where's Belinda?
she came in, grabbed her stuff and left through the back door.
Oh, no. Stay here.
Belinda?
Belinda?
she's gone. She took all of her things, and she's not coming back this time.
well, she won't leave without Jacob.
I'll go to the Pettis place. - I'm coming.
no. Go home and wait for her.
if my husband sees you, he'll run you off again.
I think Belinda might've come for Jacob.
you're wrong. He's in the barn, feeding the cow.
I'd like to check, if you don't mind.
what are you doing back here?
the boy's run off.
all right, everybody. Let's gather round.
I have no idea where these kids might be going, so we'll go in different directions.
I'll go north. Clark, you go east.
Anderson, you go south. Missie, you go west.
pastor, if you don't mind, go back to the church in case the kids seek refuge there.
let's everybody meet back here by sundown.
let's go by Anderson Pass. - That's it.
taking the county road? All right.
let's go, boys.
Belinda!
Jacob!
Belinda!
no one found them? We have to go back out.
no. - But they can't stay out there.
not in the dark, alone in the storm!
Zach's right, Missie. It's too dark to look for 'em now. We have to wait until dawn.
belinda's a smart, tough little girl. She'll find shelter for her and Jacob.
what if there is no shelter where they are? What if there's a wash?
they don't know it's not safe because of flash floods.
it'll be no help to them if you get lost too.
Maddy needs you. Stay with him.
we'll talk to more parishioners, arrange for a search party to go out in the morning.
we'll stay with you tonight, Missie.
I'll stay with you.
I'm so scared, Papa.
all right. Let's go, boys.
all right, Clancy. You ready? - Right behind you.
let's go.
okay.
Jacob! Up there. Come on!
it's okay, Jacob. It's all right.
we're just gonna stay here till the rain stops.
what'll we do then? Where do we go?
don't worry, okay? I've got a plan.
Belinda! Jacob!
Belinda!
Jacob!
let's pray.
dear Lord, please give those little children the strength and the courage...
to make it through this dark night.
and give us the faith to accept your will.
Amen. - Amen.
I don't know if you can hear me or not, God.
I'm not sure I even believe in you.
but I know I can't find those children without you.
hear my prayer, Lord.
I'm so cold.
Jacob? Belinda!
over here! We're over here!
keep talking, Belinda.
I'll follow your voice.
over here! We're over here!
sheriff Tyler? - Yes.
you're safe now. I'm gonna get you back.
back to Mr. Pettis? - No, son.
home, to Missie's.
why don't you come inside?
Zach...
there are no words that can begin to describe the depth of my gratitude.
none are necessary, Missie.
so, what happens now? Does Jacob have to go back to Pettis?
no. No, we talked on the ride back...
and he admitted to me that Hank's been beating him and practically starving him.
I'm gonna tell Hank, if he doesn't voluntarily give up his legal guardianship of him...
I'll arrest him.
I don't think that Belinda and Jacob should be separated again.
I would like for him to come and live with us.
I think the Children's Aid Society will go along with that.
I can't believe that you found them in that storm...
all by yourself.
hmm.
I wasn't alone out there, Missie.
what do you mean? I thought that you rode out by yourself.
Yeah, I searched for hours, calling them over and over again.
it got to the point where I felt hopeless.
I knew I would never find them on my own.
so I prayed to God for help.
Oh. Zach.
and then I was absolutely silent, and in that silence...
I heard what I couldn't hear while I was riding, calling them.
what? - A child crying.
the thing is even standing still...
I shouldn't have heard that little voice over the storm.
maybe it wasn't Jacob's voice you heard.
you spoke to God...
and he answered you.
with a miracle.
when did you start coming here, Pa?
when your mama died.
this is where I said good-bye.
how do you do that?
how do you let go of someone you love?
when we love someone...
that love doesn't die when they do.
that stays in our hearts forever.
but we do have to say good-bye to the life we shared with them...
go on with a new life...
a chance at happiness.
Willie would want me to be happy.
Mm-hmm.
I know that.
he'd approve of Zach.
he's a good man.
but it feels like a betrayal. - It isn't.
and it doesn't matter how I tell you that.
you're gonna have to feel it, Missie.
I think I'm gonna go on back to the house.
you want to sit here for a while?
Mmm.
I'll always love you, Willie.
but I am finally ready to be happy again.
good-bye, sweetheart.
do you still have that locket?
why, yes. Right here.
if you still want to give it to me, I'll take it.
but you said you couldn't accept a gift like that.
unless it came from someone that I loved.
will you put it on me, Zach?
gladly.
there's something else I couldn't do unless it was with the man I love.
I wish you happiness!
Bye, darlin'! - Bye-bye!
I love you!
come on, you guys. Come on. Let's go.
Bye!
Bye. Be good. - Bye!
Bye-bye.
Bye, Missie!
are you really here with me?
I'm here. - And you'll never leave me?
never.
promise? - Promise.
how can I be certain?
because the two shall become one.
what a wonderful life you've given me, Clark.
what a wonderful life we've made together.
Lord, we're grateful that the soil is warm and ready to be planted.
and we ask that this season's crop be bountiful.
we thank you for this nourishment before us.
bless it to our bodies and bless this day. Amen.
Amen.
Hey, where's Missie?
I thank you again and again for the honor you've done me in your proposals...
but to accept them is absolutely impossible.
I mean, my feelings in every respect forbid it.
now, can I speak any plainer?
Hyah! Hyah!
and I think I'm old enough to be riding by myself to school.
Charlie's a good horse, and he don't like standing around all day with nothing to do.
how do you know he don't like standing around?
from Charlie. - Hyah!
Hey. That was Missie...
on Charlie.
I believe it was.
Hyah!
take your seats and get out your reading primers.
quickly, please.
all right. Daniel, please start reading from the top of page 25.
just makin' sure the teacher made it here safely.
well, here I am, safe and sound.
I would appreciate it, though, if you made sure that Arnie and Aaron got here on time.
it's disruptive to the rest of the class when they enter late.
well, I think they're gonna be here on time from now on.
you have a very nice day, Miss Davis.
all right, Daniel. - Yes, ma'am.
get on up. Ho.
how you doin', Zeke? - Gettin' by.
I just took the boys to school. Late again.
I'll tell you, though, I wish they'd stay young forever.
how old's that boy of yours now?
he'll be 10 on his next birthday.
and the younger one? - Arnie? He's seven.
he's got it in his head, though, that one of these days...
he and Aaron are going to swap places and he's gonna be the older brother.
Yeah, well.
boys sure are full of big ideas.
Yeah.
any word from your boy?
well, like you said...
boys are full of big ideas.
lunch.
no. Get your own.
I was wondering if you'd do me a favor, Clara.
I'm just not hungry today, but I don't want my lunch to go to waste.
maybe you'd eat it for me? - I'd like to help you, Miss Davis.
thank you, Clara.
I'll be stepping out for a few minutes.
Charlotte will be in charge while I'm gone...
and she'll report to me the names of anyone breaking any class rules in my absence.
anyone.
I got it level.
give the men a break for lunch. I'll be back.
you're the boss. All right, that's lunch.
is this a private lunch or can anyone dine here?
I hope I didn't startle you.
no.
I'm Grant Thomas.
Missie Davis.
well, Missie Davis...
I have surveyed hundreds of miles of land west of the Mississippi...
but today is the first time I've ever seen anything as pretty as you in the viewfinder of my transit.
I was picking berries.
not a very substantial midday meal, if you don't mind my saying so.
did you say you have a transit?
Yes. It's a device used to measure the...
horizontal and vertical angles of the land.
that's right. - And you have one close by?
would you like to see?
would you like to look? - Mm-hmm.
allow me. - Thank you.
that's amazing. - Hmm.
what are you all doing here?
follow me.
we work for the Continental Railroad Company. It's our job to survey the lines...
to find the best and shortest routes for the men who lay the tracks.
that's a Vernier solar compass. It shows us which direction is true north.
I've read about equipment like this.
I know you said you're not hungry, but...
maybe you'd consider joining me for lunch.
I'm sorry. I really have to go. I'm late.
late?
Thanks.
are you sure you have to go? - I'm afraid so.
but it was nice to meet you, and good luck with all your work here.
let me in.
let me in.
I know you're responsible for this, Brian Murphy.
get off this door. I'm giving you one last chance.
fine, have it your way. I'm leaving and coming back with your pa.
I'm sorry. I assure you it isn't my desire to startle you every time we meet.
no. It's fine. I was just about to go in and teach a class.
I'm the teacher.
well, I don't mean to hold you up, but you left this.
thank you.
I understand now why you couldn't accept my invitation for lunch.
so maybe you'll accept my next invitation to dine with me for lunch?
a week from Saturday? It's not a school day.
unless you have a steady beau. - No.
no, you won't dine with me? - No. I mean, no, I don't have a steady beau.
Oh. - Yes. I would be delighted to dine with you.
wonderful. I hear the hotel dining room has the best food in town.
I could arrange for transportation.
Oh, no. That's all right. I'll meet you there.
around noon? - Noon would be perfect.
better get back to my class.
all right. Good-bye.
good-bye.
and this handsome and mysterious stranger rides up on this mighty steed...
and sweeps me off my feet.
Missie Davis, you are making that up. - I'm not.
it really happened. His name's Grant Thomas, and he works for the railroad.
on the crew? - Yes, but he's different from the other men.
I mean, he was well-dressed and self-assured.
they treat him like he was the boss.
he even had his own tent filled with food.
looks like you're imagining a little more than just food.
he invited me to dine with him at the hotel.
he said "dine"? - Yes.
What'd you say? - I said yes.
pa, when you gonna let me do the choppin' and you do the loadin'?
when you get older. - That's what you said about the plowin'.
well, that's right. You're gonna be a big help with the plowin' someday.
but I wanna help now. - You are helping me.
but I wanna do important work. A man's work.
there's all kinds of work, Son.
there's a boy's work.
there's a man's work, and there's God's work.
it's all important.
so feeding the chickens is important? - Yep.
and cleaning the pig's pen? - Oh, you bet.
um, Pa, I gotta go.
go ahead. - Be right back, Pa. Be right back to help.
okay.
Whew.
Aaron.
aaron, are you hurt?
seen 'em trapped lots of times, Pa...
but I ain't never heard one do that till now.
it scared me so bad, Pa. I don't need to pee no more.
you all right, Pa?
come here.
listen to me, Son.
I need you to take off your belt...
I need you to take off your belt and wrap it around my leg.
Oh. Come on.
there you go.
what do I do again, Pa?
wrap it around above my knee. Tight.
pa, help me. I don't know what to do.
it's not your fault.
pa.
pa! Pa!
please, Pa.
don't leave me.
please, Pa.
Hyah! Hyah!
hyah.
hyah.
whoa. Whoa.
hello.
who are you?
hyah.
help him, Missie.
Oh, my God. Ma... Mama!
mama! - What?
come quick.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
the bleeding has stopped for now.
no moving around, Clark. Uh-uh.
need to give that wound a chance to heal.
for how long? - At least a few weeks. Maybe more.
that's a serious injury. Gash goes clear to the bone.
I'll see you out.
Thanks, Doc.
how's Pa? - He's resting.
thank you for coming so quickly.
it takes me a better part of a month to do my rounds...
but I'll be back to check on him then.
I'll make sure he stays in bed.
infection. That's your biggest worry now.
a bad infection could lead to gangrene.
he could lose his leg.
or worse.
dear Lord, you've healed the lame.
please.
please help this good man.
give us the strength to endure this.
he will.
he will.
that look of worry on your face, it hurts a lot more than this leg does.
I'm fine.
I'm right here.
I know, but...
I'm right here, Marty. I'm not going anywhere.
and I'm figuring that, uh...
a couple of days, I'm gonna be right as rain.
you can't work the fields, Clark.
I have to.
if we don't get a good crop this year, we're gonna lose everything.
I know.
that's why Missie and I will do it.
you can't.
we will.
Shh.
pa's asleep.
go on and eat your lunch.
I wanna stay here with Pa. - I'll be right here with him.
pa needs me.
whoa.
thank you. - Here you go, sir.
Mm-hmm. Thank you. - Looks good.
whoa.
lunchtime.
Oh, no. Saturday.
what is it? What's wrong?
I'm just redressing the wound. Can you hand me that canister of yeast?
elm bark and yeast?
this should make it all better.
and if it doesn't?
Oh, God. Please, God. Help my pa.
whoa. Whoa.
afternoon. I think this belongs to you.
you're the man that helped bring my pa home.
how is he?
he's alive.
how did you happen upon him?
I was out checking my traps.
what do you think you're doing?
I thought I might have a turn at the plow.
why are you helping me?
well, wait a minute. What's your name?
Nate.
I thought maybe we'd met before.
I don't think so.
got, uh, Anders and Malone working on the next quarter-mile like you asked.
I'm glad someone is where they're supposed to be.
Yeah. I know it's none of my business, boss...
but maybe the lady had a good reason for standing you up.
whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
so, you've handled a plow before. - Yep.
are you from around here?
here and there. - Just passing through?
you always ask so many questions?
just wondering on your work experience.
cause it seems to me you should be spacing the rows a little closer together.
because the more rows you plow, the more seeds I can plant and the bigger the harvest is.
do I tell you how to braid your hair?
don't tell me how to plow a field.
how is he, ma'am?
mind if I take a look?
there's some water in the bowl. Missie, could you...
best if your boy wasn't in here.
aaron, Pa needs fresh water.
Missie can. - No, I want you to get it.
no, Mama. I'm not leaving Pa.
pa will be all right. We're here to see to that.
right now I want you to... - I'm not going! No!
Aaron. - No.
go and get fresh water. - I'm not leaving.
pa needs me! - Hand me that chair.
let me in!
he needs me in there, Mama. Let me in.
please, let me in.
what didn't you want him to hear?
we're gonna have to open that wound and burn it clean.
it's the only way to get rid of the infection.
I thought the elm bark would help dry it out. - Mama, please.
he'll lose his leg or his life if you let the infection get worse.
no. You're not touching my pa.
have you ever done this sort of thing before?
been a ranch hand for years. Seen a lot of mishaps.
so I've taken care of my share of accidents.
mama. Can't we just wait for Doc?
the doc won't be around for another three weeks.
what do you need?
take my knife and clean it with whatever you got. Brandy or iodine.
I'm gonna need some hot coals and a fry pan.
be best if you took your brothers out of earshot.
I love you, Pa.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
appreciate it.
the fever broke. He's awake.
he's even hungry. He's asking for my fried chicken.
make sure you thank him and invite him for supper tonight.
I will. Nate.
whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
thank you... for everything.
just glad I was there.
especially wouldn't wantin' your brother watching his pa die...
then living a life wondering what he could've done different.
well, I hope you like fried chicken.
that's what we're having for supper.
I'm hungry. You hear my stomach growl here?
we're all hungry. We've been waiting all day.
so who cooked this fine feast anyway?
who do you think cooked it? - Come on. Who cooked it?
I cooked it of course. - Who put the on this chicken?
the what? - It's my favorite.
he's here. Can we start eating?
patience. - Nate, come on in.
we're having a picnic. We made you a plate.
pa's leg is getting better, Nate.
and I'll be right here to make sure you have everything you need, Pa.
like if you need water... or biscuits. Or someone to get you a piece of ham.
or your Bible. - How 'bout you get me some help with the chores?
pa needs me. - All right, you two. Let's say the blessing...
so we can eat this fine meal that your mama has prepared.
Lord, we thank you for the blessings that you've bestowed on this family.
my family. And to Nate...
our very own miracle...
who has reopened our eyes to your enduring promise.
Amen. - Amen.
eat up. - All right.
Oh.
Marty tells me that you've done more work in that field today than she and Missie have been able to do all week.
well, it wasn't my first time behind a plow.
you got your own piece of land?
uh, no. No land yet. Just plans.
never despise meager beginnings.
got some wheat and corn needs to get in the ground... next couple of weeks.
I'll pay you fair price soon as the crop comes in.
but Missie here, she's young and able...
and I'm sure she'd be happy to help you with the planting.
I'll be out there at sunup.
all right.
do a bunny.
he has a big mouth. - You better watch out. He might get ya.
what I won't give for a handful of quiet.
do a swan.
do a bear.
he has a big mouth. - Better watch out. He might get ya!
cut your hair for two bits.
actually, I'm not here for a haircut. I just need a little information.
information's two bits.
I'm looking for a young woman... a Missie Davis.
I can tell you just where to find the Davis place.
I'd be most appreciative.
you wanna head back out of town. Go south from the post office.
get to two big oak trees. Head west. - Head west.
you can't miss it. - Thank you very much.
sometimes when I'm outside like this...
surrounded by all this beauty...
it feels like I'm walking through one of God's paintings.
feeds my soul.
speaking of God...
what did your Pa mean by "His enduring promise"?
that someday he'll wipe away all our tears...
and that all pain and suffering and heartache will be gone.
that evening when we were all together...
feeling joyful that Pa wasn't in pain...
you helped give us a glimpse of that promise.
we have plenty of wood back at the cabin.
not a sturdy piece of oak like this one.
what's it for?
none of your beeswax.
are you all right?
crazy.
you're foolish to mess with bees.
I've done this plenty of times.
smoke puts 'em to sleep.
we'll surprise your mama with some honey.
Ouch. Hey, ouch!
what's the matter? One of the bees not sleepy?
what about the honey for Mama?
I'd, uh, stop talking and start running if I were you.
Oh.
come here.
that was close.
smoke puts 'em to sleep.
it's always worked before. - Well, throwing a rock at 'em didn't help either.
no. Oh, no.
what is it? - My locket.
it's gone... It can't be gone. - Missie.
my mama gave it to me.
come on.
I can't believe it.
someone you know?
someone I never thought I'd see again.
good afternoon, Missie.
good afternoon, Grant.
I was worried when you didn't show up at the restaurant.
it took every bit of my surveying equipment to find you.
actually, I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of asking around in town.
I had planned to be there. My pa had an accident and was quite ill.
is he all right? - He's still recovering...
but I think the worst is behind him.
well, I'm so glad.
this is Nate. He's been working for my pa since his accident.
this is Grant Thomas.
we had a mishap with some bees. I'm a mess.
a beautiful mess. If you don't mind my saying so.
would you like to meet my folks? I mean, my pa might be sleeping, but...
well, I don't wanna disturb them with this unannounced visit.
but if it's all right, I'd like to come back and do things the right and proper way.
things? - Yes.
I'd like to ask his permission to court his daughter, if that's all right with you?
Yes. That would be fine with me.
then I'll look forward to my next conversation with him when he's feeling up to it.
it's nice to meet you, Nate.
I'll see you soon.
all right, John.
mama sent me to get you. She's got supper ready.
I'm not real hungry.
but thank her for me anyway. - All right.
I could bring you something for later. - No.
but you, uh... you can do something for me.
give this to your pa. He's gonna need it to get around.
a sturdy piece of oak.
I know how much he'll appreciate it.
good night.
whoa. Whoa.
good to see you up.
I just wanted to thank you for making this fancy cane for me.
mighty thoughtful of you. - I know what a chore it can be to get around at first.
you had some experience with a bum leg yourself?
my pa. He needed a cane for months.
best if I get the horses brushed and fed.
all right then.
how was your walk?
felt good to get out for a while. Thanks to you.
I went back to that spot in the woods where I had my accident.
woods are nice and green this time of year.
Yep. Fella could get lost in those trees if he wanted to.
Willie.
how long have you known?
boy does a lot of growing and changing in his teen years.
when you told me about your pa's leg, well, that kind of confirmed it for me.
my middle name's Nathan. Nate.
been using it for years 'cause I thought if I changed my name I could change my past.
hmm.
how's that working out for you, son?
most days it seems like the past is breathing down my neck...
reminding me I'm Willie.
even in a roomful of folks who call me Nate.
your family had a lot to deal with...
and it must've been awful hard.
when a tragedy...
happens...
a real family pulls together.
I mean, mine ripped apart.
my ma, she...
grieved herself crazy, and she went back East.
my pa, he just quit. So I left home six years ago.
I imagine you got your reasons for coming back now.
I got some things that need to be said.
then I came close to going home, and I couldn't face my pa.
not after I left like I did.
and then you found... Aaron and me.
Yes, you did.
I saw your pa today, son.
I don't know what happened between you two.
I do know you're never going to step out of the shadow of your past until you see him.
did you... Did you tell him about me?
that's not up to me.
he probably doesn't even wanna see me.
I saw a man with a face full of regret.
seeing you. Talking to you.
that might help him put his past to rest.
I suppose you think I'm a coward for running the way I did.
the way a man grieves, that's a personal thing.
but I do know there are times...
when a man can be driven to take a trip in search of answers.
and if that man doesn't find the answer he's looking for?
most often we're not looking for answers. We're in need of comfort.
and for me, the only trip worth taking is when I kneel to pray...
all the comfort I could ever ask for is right there.
in God.
you'll be fine, son.
Oh, yes. Of course.
what's your business here?
pa, it's me, Willie.
Oh, my.
I guess you would be old enough to have whiskers by now.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna make some coffee. You want a cup?
coffee would be good.
maybe I'll fix some eggs.
I found your parents to be very gracious about our lunch together.
back East, young women must often be accompanied by a chaperone.
mothers and sisters are too busy with their tasks of the day...
to spend time chaperoning.
if you don't mind my saying so, Mr. Thomas...
the entire town is very happy...
that your family's bringing the railroad right past our doors.
glad to hear we have the support of the community.
Oh, um, the cook is preparing that special chicken dish that you requested.
well, whenever you're ready for your first course, just signal me.
very good. - I thought you were a surveyor.
I am. When your family owns the business...
it's only smart to know every aspect of it.
I hope you find everything to your satisfaction.
well, everything's so lovely...
the table linens, the crystal, the beautiful Aubusson china.
you know the pattern? - Her Majesty's Filigree.
see, the scroll designs along the rim give it elegance...
and the raised accents make it unique.
I spend an exorbitant amount of time reading.
Hey! Hey!
I believe that's our lunch. - Pardon. Sorry, sir.
excuse me.
I'm terribly sorry.
here you go, sir.
thank you.
a connoisseur of knowledge and a chicken-wrangler.
the advantage of being raised in the West and educated by a woman from the East.
um, my mother died when I was just a child...
and my father ended up marrying a woman from the East.
Oh, no! Oh, I'm so clumsy.
no, no. Not at all. Missie. No, Missie.
I know they're expensive. I can pay him back. - Missie. Missie.
the crystal is mine... as are the plates.
they are easily replaced. Now sit.
they're yours? - I wanted the table to be perfect...
so I had my man, John, bring them over this morning.
don't worry another moment. I have 20 more crystal glasses just like that one at home.
twenty more. - Yes.
and I would happily let you crack each and every one...
if you'll dine with me 20 more times.
maybe next time we'll have to have a picnic instead.
you can leave all your crystal at home.
I'm already planning the menu.
this is potatoes with scrambled eggs.
just like you always used to have.
Oh, that wasn't me. That was Matt...
I hate to waste good food.
you know, Pa, I could probably eat some of this.
just don't do me any favors, Willie.
it ain't gonna break my heart if you don't eat the eggs.
really, Pa, I could eat some of that.
well, you're gonna eat nothin' now.
I mean, six years since I seen or heard from you.
I guess I'm entitled to forget a few things.
Oh, Pa.
I'm sorry I left like I did.
well, at least your ma had the guts...
to tell me to my face she was leavin'.
you know what happened to her? - No.
then I guess you're a lot like your mama.
well, I'm here now.
I came back to set things right.
I hope you could... - What can I do? I could pretend none of this ever happened?
I'm not asking you to pretend nothin', Pa.
I'm asking you to forgive me. - You want me to forgive you?
maybe you should forget you still have a son.
Yes. We'll take three of those, okay? - Yes.
Yes, please.
that will be fine.
we'll try these ones.
my goodness.
you make him sound like a fictional hero from one of your novels.
grant is educated... and handsome...
attentive.
he's traveled all over for his job...
and seen places I've only read about.
just remember...
that God has written his own story for you.
and it's not the feelings of your heart that it should be based upon...
but... rather the thoughts of your heart that you need to hear...
that inner voice that tells you...
that this man will care for you no matter what...
that he'll still want to kiss you when you're old and gray...
tend to you when you're sick, honor you.
and if the thoughts of my heart say yes, he is the one?
then you should trust your instincts and pledge your heart to him...
because a man like that is as rare as a diamond in the rough.
like Pa.
Yes. Like your pa.
aaron said he saw you packin' up your horse.
you plannin' on goin' somewhere?
took your advice. I saw my pa.
I figured that's where you were.
according to him, I ruined his life.
I'm sorry that it didn't work out the way you hoped, Willie.
I really thought your father was ready to make amends with you.
he'll never be ready to do that.
he'll never forgive me.
you're his son.
not anymore.
you wanna talk about it?
talkin' about it don't change anything.
sometimes, just talkin' it through...
it'll help you see things in a whole different light.
there ain't no light in the world that'd make this better.
can't hurt to try.
unless you're afraid.
I used to set traps for Pa.
Mattie was always after me to let him come along.
I didn't want him to. I just figured he'd slow me down.
I didn't want him to.
I just figured he'd get in the way.
but Mattie had a way about him.
he knew just how to get Ma and Pa to let him have his way.
when are we gonna set the first trap, Willie?
when I find the right place.
when are we gonna eat the food Mama sent? - When we get hungry.
how do you know when it's the right time for the traps?
can't you hush up for just two seconds?
I can't concentrate with you yammering on and on.
I don't know how I lost track of the day.
guess I was just so intent...
on gettin' those traps... set so Pa would know...
what a good trapper I really was.
thinkin' back, I don't know how I couldn't see...
how tired and worried Mattie was.
I'm cold, and it's getting dark.
don't you think we'd better head back?
I got one more trap to set.
mama's gonna be worried.
hush. Gotta make this last trap count.
pa's dependin' on me.
it was like a curtain dropped over the sun.
one minute, I could see where I was goin'...
and the next minute it got so dark...
I couldn't make out the right way to go.
I'm so sorry, Mattie. I should have listened to you.
there's no way I can get us home in the dark.
may... Maybe Pa will come find us.
maybe. More than likely, we'll just have to wait out the night...
set out home at first light.
I'm awful cold, Willie.
here. Stay close to me, and I'll...
I'll keep you wa... warm.
Thanks, Willie.
Thanks, Willie.
the kid was shiverin' and shaking in the cold, and he says thanks.
then what happened?
then...
then he, uh...
you know.
I was right.
talkin' about it doesn't change anything.
Plowin's about done.
I think it's time I moved on.
I did what I came for. - Did you?
came home, saw my pa.
are you sure that's who you really needed to face?
I should be on my way.
our doors will always be open to you, Willie...
and our prayers will be with you.
Mattie, wake up.
come on, Mattie. Quit foolin'.
Mattie?
no. Mattie.
Mattie, come on.
come on, Mattie. Wake up. No.
No! Mattie!
Mattie!
Mattie! No!
Mattie.
no. Mattie.
Mattie.
it was my fault, Mattie.
I was supposed to protect you, and I didn't.
I didn't want it to happen.
you slipped away, and I didn't even know.
you were so brave, and I didn't even get to tell you.
I'm sorry, Mattie.
please forgive me.
after you. - Thank you.
grant.
I've never seen anything like it.
it's just like a real home.
it is my home.
the tent goes up wherever I am.
I don't see any purpose in depriving myself of the comforts I've become accustomed to.
you travel with all these books?
books... and music.
honor me with a dance.
you're an excellent partner. - Thank you. My father taught me.
Missie, I...
I'm not generally a man who thinks much past the next site I'm working...
but, since we've met, I've found myself daydreaming about a future with you.
what do you see for us in your dreams?
well, I see us traveling and exploring together.
midnight picnics under a canopy of the brightest stars...
or dining in the finest hotels.
a life brimming with anything and everything you could ever want.
that life sounds like a fairy tale.
that life could be ours.
you would never have to turn a spade in soil again or...
or toil at planting your own food.
and if I did have to plant and plow...
do you see yourself right there beside me?
you're missing my point. I wouldn't have to be there...
because no wife of mine would ever struggle if even for an hour, in a field.
I'm a very wealthy man.
what's wrong?
I just always thought my first kiss should be for the man I marry.
then marry me.
Missie, you don't want to say no to a man who's offering to save you from a life of adversity.
I'm saying no to a man who doesn't think adversity...
is something to get through together.
it's just not real, Grant.
I'll tell you what's real.
you've just given up the chance of a lifetime.
I can have any heart I want.
until now.
I'm sorry, Grant.
I'll get someone to take you home.
God bless you.
Nate. Hi.
actually, I'm Willie... Nathan LaHaye.
Willie LaHaye. - You were the boy that stole my hair ribbons and dipped my braids in ink.
and then when your brother...
and then you were gone.
so, why didn't you tell me who you were?
I've been Nate for years to strangers.
guess I wasn't ready to be Willie again...
UN... until now.
well, you don't look like anything I remember.
Oh. I was just a boy when I left.
it's been a while. People change.
they do.
well, how about your Pa? Have you seen him?
I've seen him...
but he's not ready to see me.
well, you know, I wanted to thank you for all you did for my family...
but you... you left without saying good-bye.
had some thinkin' to do, some things to get right.
I'm grateful to you and your family...
for helping me put down a burden...
that I've been carryin' for a long time.
actually, I'm... I'm headed for the West.
you've got land to farm?
no. Not yet. When I do claim my land...
it'll be for raising cattle, not crops.
I worked on a couple cattle ranches, and it's what suits me.
the thing is, I came by today...
because I didn't want to make the same mistake.
I wanted to see you and, um...
and give these back to you.
my ribbons.
you kept them all these years?
probably seems silly to you.
no, not silly.
it's sweet.
well, anyway, that's what I came for...
to give you those and...
to say good-bye.
Bye.
never despise meager beginnings.
wait!
Willie.
Willie.
I was just wondering if, um...
are cattle ranchers tied to the seasons the same way farmers are?
no, not in the same way, I suppose.
so, would it make a difference if you leave now or leave later?
I guess not.
after all the work you did plowing and planting our fields...
it would be a shame for you to miss the harvest and not collect your pay.
and I make really good corn bread pudding once the sweet corn's shucked.
I'll bet that fella Grant Thomas will really like that.
Yes, I bet he will...
if he finds someone to make it for him.
it won't be me.
I guess I could postpone my trip long enough to be here for the harvest.
good.
they named him Big Earl.
big Earl, he...
dear Father, we thank you for this harvest...
for your faith in us...
and for the time we spend together.
Amen. - Amen.
all right, pass your bowls down.
you workin' hard?
tryin' to.
go again.
all right, you two. You know what's expected.
Ah. - Go ahead. Get on up there.
time's a-wastin', boy.
Ah!
look at them two.
I love you, Missie Davis.
I always have.
I love you too.
Missie Davis, will you marry me?
happy day.
try and send word as soon as you're settled. - I will.
and walk as much as you can. It's better than riding.
you know how much we love you.
I know it's not so far, but send word once you're settled.
I'll take good care of her.
I know you will.
you take good care of both of you.
ever since you were just a little baby...
I knew this moment would come.
you always had an independent spirit.
pa. My heart's breaking.
mine too.
can you fix it? - Not this time, little one.
not this time.
you go ahead now.
your husband's waitin' on you.
thank you.
remember His promise.
no tears.
no tears.
no tears.
but I'm tired! - It's the beginning of the day now. Come on.
all right.
you're it.
forward!
mama! - You stay with Pa!
now hold up.
dear Ma and Pa.
the Bible says, for everything, there is a season.
and after two years of marriage...
the time has finally come for Willie and me to put down roots on a ranch of our own.
ho!
so long. - We left the wagon train today and are heading out alone through desolate and beautiful country.
it's not green like the farm. More golden.
as you can tell by my handwriting, the way is pretty bumpy.
Willie's worried we got a late start leaving Denver.
august is not a good month to start up a ranch.
I did get a full year of teaching in, and we can use the money.
we also may be starting up something else.
namely, your first grandchild. I haven't told Willie yet.
he's got so much on his mind already.
there will be plenty of time to tell him after we've settled.
for everything, there is a season.
Willie, can you pull up for a minute?
feel better?
Yes.
you're bound to get sick pitching around in that wagon.
there's still a couple of hours left of daylight. We can keep going if you want.
Nah, that's okay. We'll get an early start in the morning.
come on. I'll help you get supper started.
looks like they're alone, Trent. Just out for a little romantic ride in the country.
shouldn't we do a roundabout, make sure they ain't part of a wagon train?
I'm tired.
what I'd like'd be a hot bath...
a bottle of whiskey and a woman.
well, one out of three ain't bad. - What do you say?
enough talk.
let's make me rich today.
the sodbuster ties his gun down. - So do we.
but your average rancher don't tie his gun down, Mason, that's the point.
what do you say, Trent? - Some other time maybe.
Willie, bring some forks when you come.
welcome, folks. - Thank you, sir.
Frank Taylor. Proud owner of the greatest general store in this parts.
Oh, Missies LaHaye. And this is my husband, Willie.
pleasure. You folks just passing through?
we're figuring on staying. - Well, that's good news to Texford Junction.
well, if you could just show us the land offices, Mr. Taylorson.
Yes, sir. About two doors down.
good-bye.
this is the track you'll be homesteading. Just north of McClain Place.
see? There's the main creek threading through the middle...
with plenty of branches for the cattle to water.
it's a good place to start a family. Here's the deed.
I wish you folks the very best of luck.
many come. Not many last.
we'll last. - With hard work and a lot of prayer.
what are you doing?
next to marrying you, this is the happiest day of my life.
our life. - Missies LaHaye...
as God as my witness, I swear to work harder than any man to build you a home on this land.
and we'll raise a family...
and watch generations after generations of LaHayes thrive and prosper.
well, Willie, I have something to say about that.
Hey, get back here. Get back here.
Hey, hey, hey. - I didn't see nothing, Mister, honest.
chicken thieves start early in these parts.
that's the first child I've seen.
Yep. Glad you brought all those books just for that one.
I'm sure there are more.
first the ranch.
then teaching.
then everything else. - Everything else?
you know what I mean. What were you gonna tell me before that chicken butted in?
just that, uh... that I'm happy too, Willie.
Hello, young man. - Howdy.
I'm Missies LaHaye. What's your name?
Jeff Huff, ma'am. - How old are you, Jeff Huff?
twelve years old, ma'am. - Did you catch that chicken?
no. Got distracted by your smooching.
sorry, ma'am. - Well, I'm sorry we caused you to lose your chicken.
Oh. Weren't mine, anyway. Just fooling around.
Willie. - Sonny! Sonny!
where you been? I been waiting so long for you to come back.
where have you been? Sonny? Where you been, Sonny?
where you been, Sonny?
Ow. - Leave him be. I mean it.
I'm just having a little fun with your little brother, Sonny.
take it easy, Mason.
why don't you and I go in and have a drink?
Sonny...
you can go play.
don't go embarrassing me like that! - Sorry, Sonny.
got you something.
easy there, Jeff. Don't that widow feed you? I pay her good money.
I don't like it there, Sonny. I wanna go with you.
Yeah, well, you can't.
I told you that a hundred times.
whoa.
I'll build you a house a lot better than that one.
Oh, no. Willie, this house is just fine.
let's go take a look.
humble as it may be, sweetheart, this is the first home of our own that we've ever had.
no stove. - I can use the fireplace.
my cooking can't get any worse than it is right now.
Lord, bless this house and all who enter.
Amen.
dearest family, I miss you and the small creature comforts.
sometimes I can almost hear your voices in the soft prairie wind.
I worry about Willie.
he works with a ferocity that sometimes scares me.
he's so concerned we won't be ready for winter.
I've still not found the right time to tell him about the baby.
Willie and I went riding over our land.
what a beautiful country the Lord has made.
just the other day, we saw Indians on our ridgeline.
Willie is very concerned for my safety...
though there hasn't been any Indian attacks in years in these parts.
Willie and I are sending you a treasure map to our hard-earned savings...
which we just buried in the wilds of our new ranch.
I certainly hope you never need to use it.
Willie doesn't trust banks out here.
but then, this is a strange and wild place.
I've been punching cattle over three years, Mr. LaHaye.
I'm not as experienced as some, but more than others.
where you hail from, Henry? - What does that matter? I'm here now.
all right.
I suppose it's none of my business anyway.
no offense. - None taken...
if... you give me a job.
how.
uh, I'm Missies LaHaye.
my husband and I, uh, homestead this place.
we raise, uh, cattle.
this "how," what is that supposed to mean?
you speak English?
that's what they tell me.
I'm Miriam Red Hawk McClain.
married to Sean McClain
we homestead the next tract to the south of here.
Oh, we're neighbors. - Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am.
Oh!
please. Please come in.
I don't understand, Mister... - Just Scottie's fine.
been cowboying since I was a kid.
I've done everything there is to do.
how come you haven't been hired by one of the big outfits?
I can't use this no more, so most people think I'm washed up.
but I learned to get by with my left.
you take me on, Mr. LaHaye, and I won't let you down.
you got yourself a job.
uh, I'm just getting started. Trying to make this place into a home.
please, sit.
I think I have one last jar of strawberry preserves...
that I've been saving for just such an occasion.
please, here.
now, this here is a county fair blue ribbon winner.
Mm. Mm.
this is very good. You must teach me how to make this.
Oh, my mother made it. I'm not a very good cook.
when I was growing up, I mostly helped out my pa riding horses, plowing the field, tending to the chickens.
then you will do very well here.
many women who come here are soft.
they don't know how to do these things. You do.
still, I feel that my husband would prefer a good meal.
I brought you some things.
it is too late to start a garden this year, so corn, potatoes, beets.
Oh, thank you, Miriam. - We are neighbors.
the last family was here, well, they could have asked us for more help...
but... I think they feared my Shoshone ways.
Oh, well, my husband and I will be grateful for whatever help we can get.
um, what is in there?
the secret to flaky biscuits.
pig lard.
excuse me. Sorry, sorry.
what do you think about these? - You could breed 'em.
would you be Mr. LaHaye? - I would.
well, I'm Fyn Anders. I would like job, sir, if please.
uh, what kind of foreigner is you, son?
I come from Norway on boat...
to find adventure in the big, wide open spaces.
well, you have any experience around cattle?
no, sir. But I am big, strong. Own horse.
well, Fyn Anders from Norway, this'll be strictly trial basis.
hope you learn fast. - Don't worry, Mr. LaHaye.
I learn good and fast. You betcha.
what do you think? - Probably 40 or 50
good cow.
the boys will love the jam. And so will their pa.
sure I can't give you any biscuits.
no.
thank you, though.
well, maybe next time I'll make them with the pig lard.
if I don't retch.
when you're ready to bring this little one into the world, I will be there.
I've delivered many babies. - Oh, Miriam, thank you!
I'll bring some books for the boys. - Good.
I don't want them growing up illiterate like their pa.
very nice to meet you, neighbor.
you too.
here comes trouble.
I, uh, heard you were hiring some cowpokes.
jobs are filled.
Oh, this is the bunch you hired.
too bad you just couldn't have waited a bit, hired some real men.
just where would I find these real men?
me.
me and my boys.
not only can we rope and ride...
but most important, we can shoot.
Hey, Mister. I bet you can't shoot worth nothing.
why don't I start with you?
Trent, come on. Let's get out of here.
well, we got some cows to drive, so watch them, and do likewise.
you betcha, boss.
Mr. LaHaye.
how would you feel about hiring on another broke-down old cowboy?
well, I suppose I wouldn't feel so good about that, Mister...
my name is Cookie. - You're a cook.
you're real quick.
afraid I can't afford another hand right now.
strictly on a trial basis.
come on! Get up there!
get it up there! Move it now! Ha!
it's a beautiful herd, Willie.
move it! Come on. Move it!
this... This way. Come on.
Hyah! Hyah! Come on!
this way. Hyah!
how do, Miss LaHaye?
my dearest Missies, the prospect of being grandparents...
fills us with such joy and pride.
I can only imagine how happy you must be.
and by now, I'm sure you've shared the happy news with that hard-working son-in-law of mine.
I can still remember the exact moment...
when your mother told me about you.
I was standing in the kitchen eating breakfast...
and most of all, I remember how radiant your mother looked when she told me.
and as for you, my strong daughter, I hope you are feeling well...
and that it is an easy pregnancy for you.
I love you, darling.
my wife and my initials.
fine idea, including her.
all this would be nothing without her.
therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife.
they shall be as one.
genesis. You know your Bible.
Yes. Yes, good reading material. Anyway, I'm happy for you.
a good marriage, that's...
something to be treasured.
speaking from experience?
Scottie! - What?
ready for another one? - Not just yet.
hold on.
where you off to?
I'm taking some books to our neighbors, the McClains.
be back in a couple of hours.
she sure is a better rider than I am.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Buffalo.
it ain't done by white men neither.
white men only take the pelt.
Injuns use just about everything...
the hide, the meat, the horns, some of the bones.
Yeah, Missies and I saw some Indians riding south last week.
all this beef is better than this buffalo meat any day.
there ain't been Injun trouble in these parts for quite a while.
let's tell the boys.
Lord, give this horse wings to fly. Hyah!
Fyn.
go spell Scottie. There's some sick cows that need to be brought in.
Yes, boss. - Mrs. LaHaye in the house?
no, sir. She up and took some books over to your neighbors...
the McClains.
boy, she sure can ride.
Miriam!
you are safe here, Mrs. LaHaye.
I'm so sorry.
you're putting a scare into this poor woman.
we were just having a little fun.
you listen to Sharp Claw!
is it trouble you want for us?
my apologies, Mrs. LaHaye.
Missies, this is my brother, Sharp Claw.
I give you my word, Mrs. LaHaye, my young hunters meant no harm...
except to laugh at your expense.
their proper behavior when they saw you should have been to make sure that you arrived at your destination safely.
especially a woman in your condition.
Oh.
and this is my husband Sean.
it's a pleasure to meet you, madam. - Nice meeting you.
and Robert and Bruce.
Hello, boys.
please.
can we take our books? - Yes, they're yours.
now, children, these are the same books used in almost every school in America.
who is this McGuffey?
an Ohio schoolmaster who felt a burden from God...
to teach all American children how to read.
american children? - Yes, sir. And that includes those...
whom our late President Lincoln called Native American.
thank you, Mrs. LaHaye. Now, you all have your books.
all you men and children out.
we have women's business to talk about.
Yes.
sharp Claw!
over there. Someone's coming.
Willie.
this is Miriam...
and her husband, Sean, and her brother, Sharp Claw.
we're on our way to the mountains.
we intend only to take some buffalo.
I have given strict orders that no cattle are to be harmed, and those orders will be obeyed.
are you ready to go home, Missies?
Mr. McClain, Mrs. McClain.
sharp Claw.
good-bye. Thank you. - Good-bye.
thank you.
hold her down. - Uh-huh.
she'll be good in a couple of weeks.
first time I ever seen 'em go on like that. - Well.
just what did you think you were doing, Missies?
I was taking some McGuffey readers over to the McClains.
Miriam asked me to teach her children how to read.
how come you never told me about Miriam's visit?
I'm worried about you riding alone.
it's too dangerous. You won't be doing this again, Missies.
Oh, yes, I will! - Oh, no, you won't.
Oh, yes, I will!
Missies. Sweetheart.
do you miss teaching this much?
no, that's not why I'm crying.
then why?
because I truly believe...
that the Lord sent Miriam McClain to us.
and why would he do a thing like that?
to bring our baby into the world...
healthy and hardy.
our baby?
Missies.
please, Willie, don't worry. Miriam will be my midwife.
she's delivered all the babies in her village for many years.
our baby?
Oh, Willie, aren't you happy?
I'm the happiest man alive.
good grub, Cookie.
very good. - Perfect for a brisk night like this.
here's a blanket to keep off the cold.
don't give her that old horse blanket.
you, uh... You take mine, Mrs. LaHaye.
Oh, no. Well, thank you both, but I'm fine.
you told them?
I'd like to raise a coffee cup to, uh...
seeing as this is the strongest we got... to Mr. and Mrs. LaHaye...
and their happy news.
so say we all. - Hear! Hear!
thank you.
Willie.
hmm?
what is it? I'm awake.
they were just so kind and concerned tonight.
the hands? - Mm-hmm.
Yep.
what about their families?
I really don't know much about them.
but they're good workers.
and that's the most important thing.
shouldn't we know if they have families or not?
Missies, lots of times...
cowboys come out here to get away from things.
you gotta respect that.
still, it seems like such a lonely life.
you're gonna be a wonderful mother.
so?
well, looks like they figured it all by their lonesome.
let's make me rich today.
Willie says you know the good book.
Sunday mornings, my husband and I read the Bible and pray together.
you're invited to join us.
well, thank you, Mrs. LaHaye, but, uh, I don't think so.
aren't you a churchgoing man? - Actually, I used to be a preacher.
a preacher? - Yeah, well...
the Lord giveth...
and the Lord taketh away.
what did he take away from you?
something very special.
my wife.
Fyn. Come here.
need you to reshoe this horse. - Yes, boss.
morning, Mrs. McClain.
Mr. LaHaye.
you and Missies going into town today? - Yes, we are.
Mrs. McClain, I know when we first met I was...
out here, neighbors need one another, Mr. LaHaye.
I couldn't agree more.
please. - Thank you.
basically, you just take it up...
you make it look so easy, Sonny.
well, practiced lots of hours to make it look like that.
okay, come here. Remember how I showed you.
you coil it in your left hand, like that. Make sure there ain't no kinks in the line.
this is the noose.
okay? - Mm-hmm.
let's see what you got.
now loosen your wrist. When you're ready, cast it off.
Oh, missed again.
that's all right. Keep practicing. I'll get another rope.
good day.
I'm Missies LaHaye.
he seems like a nice boy.
my brother.
I'm glad to hear that he has family.
I've been a little worried about him. - He's fine.
and your mother and father?
they're gone.
no offense, ma'am...
but it ain't your business worrying about someone's not your kin.
it's just Christian charity, Mr. Huff.
I hope we're not interrupting you, ma'am.
what do you want, Trent?
I think you'd better get saddled up.
we got some riding to do.
Sonny. I did it. I roped the post.
gotta go now.
behave yourself. Keep practicing.
you'll be back though. - You know it.
you got my rope.
is Sonny gone a lot?
it's his job.
he's making money so we can have a ranch of our own someday.
he sounds like a very good brother.
got yourself a strong breed.
and we'll know more after roundup. Let's call it a day.
now, children... and Mr. McClain...
I want you to write these letters on your slates...
and then sound them out.
and when you know them...
you'll have mastered the entire alphabet.
help each other out now.
the weather's turning cold...
and Sharp Claw and his camp will be leaving tomorrow...
and you probably shouldn't get a chill riding over.
so, this is my last class for a while?
the children have learned much from you, Mrs. LaHaye.
keep at it, Mr. McClain.
having a turbulent time finding a word that starts with an "X.
that is a difficult letter.
Sean's always used an "X" to sign his name.
well, not for much longer.
thank you.
Snow'll be coming soon.
now remember, really sound out the words with them.
and when you come back, they'll be ready for the advanced readers.
I'll keep them on it.
good.
God go with you and your family, Sharp Claw.
thank you.
and, Miriam, I'll be seeing you.
Yes, you will.
safe travels.
thank you. Good-bye.
come on!
Willie and the ranch hands have worked hard...
to ensure the livestock survive the long winter.
and that over there is gonna be all your peas.
cookie and I have prepared the soil for a large garden next spring.
I so enjoy his companionship and his cooking.
here I just might make a... a sweet tater patch.
Oh. - Have large taters in here.
it's all coming together.
it's beginning to feel like... home.
now, as we wait for snow, the ranch hands have time to go into town...
for some well deserved relaxation.
this time I got a better hand - Don't tell us what you got.
how many? - Three.
as for Willie, he still works harder than anyone.
maybe more now, knowing the baby's coming.
as we prepare for winter...
I'm reminded of Isaiah preparing the way for our savior's birth...
and I think warmly of all of you as Christmas approaches.
are you warm enough?
I'm fine.
why are you always so warm? Even your feet.
well, someone's gotta warm them icy toes of yours.
I guess that's why we're a perfect match.
the sky looks like snow. We're lucky it held off this long.
you know, I was thinking today...
this is gonna be our first Christmas in this house, Willie.
I bet you miss your family and all those family traditions you talk about.
Yeah, sure, I miss them.
but we'll start new traditions here.
well, with the weather settling in...
this might be our last chance getting to town for a while.
better tell Santa what you want for Christmas.
no, nothing store bought. That would be just a waste of money.
well, what then?
all I want for Christmas is to be surrounded by the people we care about.
this here's mine.
no.
you got the watch.
I got the watch...
because mine broke.
it's a practical thing. I have to know the time in order to steal.
gimme more money.
no.
you got two brooches and a watch, and I don't got none of that.
you got two salt and pepper shaker, and, uh...
you ever wish you had a place to call your own?
more coffee?
thank you.
men...
Mrs. LaHaye would like to say something.
well, as you all know...
Christmas will be here before we know it.
Santa Claus will never find us all the way out here, I bet.
well, he will if my wife has anything to say about it.
Willie and I would like to cordially invite you all to Christmas dinner.
unless you have other places to be.
well, then that settles it. Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.
Trimmings?
now, where do you rustle up some of those?
well, I was hoping you might help me, Cookie.
I got that.
Mrs. LaHaye! Mrs. LaHaye!
Jeff. What is it? - Mrs. LaHaye, I got something.
from Sonny. - What's it say?
not sure.
come here.
dear little brother, it's real hot here.
"I'll bring you some beans that jump all by themselves."
stay good, and I'll see you after Christmas.
Sonny.
best be going, Missies.
well, thank you, Mrs. LaHaye.
that boy's got one speed... runnin'.
by the time this arrives, I expect it will be nigh onto Christmas.
I think on how long the world lay in darkness before the light of the world was born in that humble little stable.
we have been blessed to receive his light.
not only to live in hope ourselves, but to take hope to others.
I am sending you something which I know you'll remember from many Christmases past.
may it start a new tradition in the LaHaye household...
and remind you we are there in spirit...
sharing your first Christmas on the ranch.
and know we will miss you...
but our hearts are forever knit together in love.
round. Take it round there, Henry.
round. Here.
here. Fyn. Come on, Fyn. Hurry up.
I just don't understand why Willie had to go into town on Christmas Eve.
Oh, I'm sure he'll be along shortly, ma'am.
Wow.
Willie LaHaye, where have you been? It's Christmas Eve!
I know.
there's gonna be one more for Christmas, Missies.
merry Christmas, Mrs. LaHaye.
merry Christmas, Jeff.
please come in. Come in.
there's just one thing missing.
this star stood on top of every Christmas tree we had when I was growing up.
go ahead.
here you go, little man.
come on.
Oh, that was good.
mm, thank you, Mrs. LaHaye. This is...
the finest Christmas dinner I've had in many a year.
many a year? It's the best one I ever had.
well, thank you, but I couldn't have done it without Cookie.
well, thank you, ma'am.
now is it time to open presents?
presents?
Yes, Jeff, I think now it's time to open presents.
all right. Let's see.
uh, Fyn.
Scottie.
Henry.
and Je... Oh, me.
and Cookie. Here ya go.
well, go ahead. Open 'em up.
Oh.
thank you, Mrs. LaHaye.
this is the best Christmas I ever had.
me too.
what is it, Scottie?
this is the...
first Christmas present I ever got.
well, gentlemen, I know how you all feel about Bible reading...
but it wouldn't be Christmas without it.
so, you are welcome to stay, but if you want to leave...
I... I believe I'd like to stay, ma'am.
Yeah, I'd like to stay too.
me too, ma'am.
gospel, according to Luke?
and so...
joseph went up from Galilee...
to the city of Nazareth, to Judaea...
to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed...
who was with child.
and while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered.
and she gave birth to her firstborn son.
and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger.
and an angel of the Lord appeared above them...
and the glory of the Lord shone around them...
and they were filled with fear.
and the angel said to them...
be not afraid, for behold...
I bring you good news of a great joy...
which will come to all the people.
for unto you this day is born, in the city of David...
the savior who is Christ, the Lord.
Amen. - Amen. - Amen.
Amen. - Amen.
Amen.
how.
I've missed you, neighbor.
I missed you too.
Sonny! Sonny!
Oh, now, isn't that sweet?
is there nothing good and decent with you guys?
Hey, Mason, come on.
let's give them some privacy.
Oh, well, that's just real nice of you, Trent.
come here. - How's it goin'?
Oh, I... I really got a lot of stuff to tell you about.
um, it's kinda hard to know where to start.
read 'em and weep.
I'll go around back to get that for you.
now, deal, boys.
as long as the old man don't blow it.
that's a pair right there.
mind if I sit in?
uh, we're just about to leave. Uh, I'm out.
Oh, come on, Scottie. Just a few more hands.
I can win it all back. I feel it.
uh, let's go, Fyn. You're almost out of money anyway.
LaHayes doesn't pay you. - Well, like all cowboys...
we get paid when the cattle is sold.
no, no, no. Mr. LaHaye pay us anyway.
he dig up a tin of dollar bills just to pay us.
it's like a... a buried treasure.
don't listen to him. He's drunk. Now come on, Fyn!
just like buried treasure.
old Henry's going to Sunday morning meeting.
well, maybe I should be going too.
if believin' the way they does makes them the way they is...
it bides looking into sometime.
Henry, will you be so kind as to lead us in prayer?
I don't know, ma'am. I'm...
I'm afraid I'm out of practice.
kind of... Kind of hard to...
start.
it's okay to stumble.
he's ready to catch you.
Lord, sometimes...
we look but don't perceive.
sometimes we listen but don't understand.
please, open our ears and eyes to your truth.
Amen. - Amen.
Amen.
it's open to everyone on Sunday.
Oh, Fyn. Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Please come in.
sorry, boss. He got the jump on me.
what do you want? - I want your money.
let's go. Follow him.
get up. Move it out.
Hey, there, come on!
let's go. Come on.
come on. Come on. Good Sunday morning to y'all.
Sonny?
Jeff, I... I didn't know. I thought you was in town.
what ya doing?
ain't this sweet?
all right, all of you, sit down.
come on.
you too, kid.
just do as the man says.
I'll just go over and get my treasure map.
leave her alone!
now...
I missed on purpose, but I won't do it twice.
please. You can see she's expecting.
so am I.
I'm expecting to come back here with more money than I left with.
I don't know what makes you think that there's any money.
well, your Norwegian cowpoke...
has a tendency to run off at the mouth after a couple of pints.
showing off his money, and bragging about...
how his boss has a treasure buried on his land.
tie him up.
you do as he says, Missies, you'll be all right.
you remember where we dug that hole?
I think I remember. - You'll be fine.
all right. Enough said.
let's make me rich today.
Hyah!
hurry it up.
I need something to dig with. - Well, then use your hands.
make it quick.
is that it or not?
well, then toss it over.
you're gonna have to show me where the rest of the money is.
but you... you have all the money. There is no more.
no, I don't have all the money.
cause that Norwegian, he wasn't spending silver.
he was spending cash.
I could just about eat me a whole side of beef right now.
well, if you turn me loose, I'll cook you whatever you want.
like rat stew. - Oh, and now how stupid you think I am?
you're working for Trent, ain't you?
equal partners is what we is.
that right, Sonny?
you equal partners with these lowlifes?
shut your mouth!
Ooh.
why don't you tell your brother, Sonny?
why don't you tell him what you do to make money?
tell him how all you do is rob innocent people.
probably been involved in a murder or two.
that's a lie!
tell him he's wrong, Sonny. You ain't never killed nobody.
tell him, Sonny. Tell... Tell him you ain't like these other bad men.
I ain't never killed nobody. Never.
don't you see?
I'm doing this for us, Jeff.
our future. You and me and the life we're trying to have.
no, Sonny. You can't mean that.
what would Ma and Pa say about your thieving ways?
they'd say, "Good for you, Sonny."
trying to make a life for you and your little brother.
so you think...
they're looking down from heaven right now, and they're proud of you?
aren't you tired of living in that boardinghouse?
huh? No place that's really yours?
I want a better life for us, Jeff.
that's why I'm doing this.
these folks are my friends, Sonny.
Mrs. LaHaye has been teaching me to read.
Mr. LaHaye fetches me for the Sunday meetings, and he's teaching me ranching.
these are the kind of people things always work out for. They'll be fine.
we ain't taking nothing from them they can't get back 10 times over.
when this is over, you and me can spend all the time you want together.
get it out of there.
toss it to me.
you got a key for this? - No.
don't you trust nobody anymore?
Oh, my, isn't that pretty?
Whoo... wee.
put your hands in the air.
you know how to use that?
I missed on purpose.
I won't do it twice.
shooting a man's a different story.
a good Christian woman like yourself wouldn't hurt anyone.
so what you gonna do?
that's two more shots.
Sonny, I could use a little help here.
this is for your own good.
look.
Where's the woman, Trent? What did you do?
mi...
where is she? Go get her! Go find her!
what are you doing here? - It's all right, Jeff. I will. I will.
get her. - Jeff, it's all right.
listen to me. Listen to me. I will, Jeff.
What'd you do with that girl? Where is she?
it's all right. It's all right, Jeff.
it's all right. Where is she, Trent?
you'd better tell me she ain't hurt, or so help me.
stand up slowly.
drop your gun, Sonny, or he's dead.
Missies.
Missies? - Sonny, go cut Willie loose...
and don't you so much as nick him.
find it hard to believe you got the drop on Trent.
I got his gun and his dignity.
Missies, pick up the gun, and move away from him.
looks like you got me.
Sonny, tie him up. Just like you did us.
then maybe we'll ask the law to spare your life.
here, let me help you with that, Sonny.
Sonny!
it's okay. Just don't go away, Sonny.
don't go.
don't go away.
fix him up, won't ya? He wouldn't have hurt ya.
Oh, I would fix him if I could. I knew he wouldn't hurt me.
I'm so sorry for what I done, ma'am.
please forgive me.
don't hold my deeds against him.
he's got no one now.
he's got nobody.
Oh, no, forgiveness is yours, Sonny.
he'll be with us now, I promise.
you grow up to be a man that Pa would be proud of, you hear me, Jeff?
I will.
and you promise me you won't spend your days missing me.
ask me no questions...
I'll tell you no lies.
I'll pray for you, Sonny.
now, don't go wasting your prayers on me, ma'am.
I done too many bad things for God to be forgivin'.
long ago, there was a thief...
left on a cross to die, just like you, Sonny.
but then he heard the glorious words of the Lord about redemption.
and he knew that very day he was gonna be in paradise.
he's waiting for you, Sonny.
go with God.
thou anointest my head with oil, and my cup runneth over.
surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life...
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.
Jeff's part of our family now.
Yep.
if someday he wants to take the LaHaye name...
I'd be fine with that too.
that would be nice, Willie.
we are gonna need a bigger house.
I was thinking I could knock out this back wall...
maybe put in a bedroom or two.
maybe... - Willie.
yeah? - I think maybe you should put your boots back on.
it's time.
but Miriam said we were still a few weeks away.
no, I think you'd best be getting Miriam.
now.
what's the matter?
you're gonna sleep in the bunkhouse tonight, Jeff, just like a real cowboy.
I'm having the baby.
maybe I'll go, uh, check on those cattle.
okay, sure.
I'll go with you.
uh, maybe I'll wait a little bit.
okay.
Yeah, I'll wait.
it ain't your firstborn you're worrying about.
now quit it. You're making the boss crazy.
it's gotten awfully quiet in there.
it's a boy!
Willie.
come and meet your son.
we never did get around to deciding what to name him.
I was thinking...
Matthew.
after your brother.
Matthew Isaiah LaHaye.
Mattie.
it fits.
shoo. Shoo.
she needs her rest.
it's all right, Miriam.
you can come closer.
hello.
I remember thinking that day...
we had finally reached the end of our journey.
but now I know that the journey is long and lasts a lifetime.
each day on the ranch, I am reminded of God's plan...
and the never ending circle of life.
come on! Hyah!
I love you.
Bye, Willie.
your grandsons grow bigger and stronger each day.
Matthew has your eyes...
and hopes to see his granddaddy soon. - Bye, Henry.
Jeff has thrived, and Willie and I are very proud...
he has taken the name of LaHaye.
Bye-bye, Scottie.
you take care, Mrs. LaHaye. We'll be back pretty soon now.
see you, Cookie. - Take care.
safe travels.
the herd has increased by another 40 head...
and Willie and the ranch hands are driving some of them to the market.
whoa. Look at this one.
Oh, wow. - This is huge.
will you bring it in? - Okay.
the garden has given us a bounty of vegetables...
to put up for the winter.
who knows what the next year will bring.
I am confident the love of God and family will light our path.
and a renewed faith in the words...
for everything, there is a season...
and a time for every matter under heaven.
and I need to rush home and change because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.
imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.
now, I'm wearing blue so, if...
are you going to change? - We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
a press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.
the President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
all we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
further updates every hour.
temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes. Of course.
no, we understand. It wouldn't be right.
thank you.
here he is, gentlemen. Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
senator Haddigan. I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.
damn good to meet you.
proud to make your acquaintance, son.
sorry?
that's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?
took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.
doc. - Ira.
and now, the heroes of lwo Jima!
that's you. - Go, go, go, go. Go.
please welcome
navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,
private First Class Ira Hayes,
private First Class Rene Gagnon!
holy shit.
come in, come in, come in. Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.
rene Gagnon. - Bud Gurber.
you showing the boys the sights? - We saw a hell of a ball game.
that's great. The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you here, just some simple things we want you to say.
mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.
itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.
everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them, notes written in lipstick. We won't mention that to the press, am I right?
have a drink, for Christ's sake.
my God, what you boys must have seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels.
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.
so, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.
white House tomorrow, then we trot you over to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.
politicians and actors.
you put them in a restaurant together, they'd die of old age before picking up the check.
then New York City, Times Square, dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...
who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
that's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
you present each mother with a flag, they say a few words, people will shit money.
it'll be so moving.
but this says Hank Hansers mom.
lovely woman. She knows how close you and her son were.
he wrote home about you.
she is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasrt in the picture.
sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
he raised the other one, the real flag.
the what? The real... The real flag? There's a real flag?
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.
we put it up when they took the other one down.
am I the only one getting a headache here? You know about this?
it was after it was already in the papers.
the mothers had already been told, but...
that's it, that's beautiful. Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
who is in the goddamn picture?
are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima. Victory is ours.
you're three of them, right?
this was the fifth day, sir. The battle went on for 35 more.
well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
can I hit this guy?
you know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture. Harlon is in the picture.
well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block. That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.
you know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.
you know what they're calling this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.
they might've called it the "We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets "So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive, but it didn't have quite the ring. They could've called it that, though, because the last four bond drives came up so short we just printed money instead.
ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you our dollar is next to won'thless, we borrowed so much.
and nobody is lending any more. Ships aren't being built.
tanks aren't being built. Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
you think this is a farce? You want to go back to your buddies?
well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.
and don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway because the fuel dumps are empty.
and our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.
if we don't raise $14 billion, and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.
we make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want and we come home, because you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
$14 billion.
the last three drives didn't make that much all together.
people on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.
you can't even see your faces.
but it said we can win this war, are winning this war, we just need you to dig a little deeper.
they want to give us that money.
no, they want to give it to you.
but you, you don't want to ask for it. You don't want to give them hope.
you want to explain about this person and that flag.
well, that's your choice.
because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about and that will be that.
gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
well, hello. Good to see you. - Mr. President.
darn good to see you, boys.
heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
Yes, sir.
IRA, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.
very proud, sir.
they should be.
well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.
you fought for a mountain in the Pacific now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
and I don't expect you'll let us down. - No, sir.
good. Go get it.
that's the end of this ceremony.
let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
my gosh. There you are.
boys. Boys, this one's on me. To those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
excuse me, Mr. Gagnon. May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
and your name is?
I don't know about you, but I get the impression
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
you're such a hero. I feel honored to be in your presence.
that's just not true.
that's professional work. Here, to professionals.
here they are. You're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
let me shake your hands, John Tennack.
John Bradley.
these boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.
boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
excuse me for one moment.
you can buy them a drink while you're at it.
that's right. Drinks for these men all the way around.
and you're the other one, aren't you? John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
rene Gagnon. - Pleased to meet you.
have a drink, come on. And here's my card.
listen to me, Rene, when you get finished being famous you come see me because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
you heard of prefab homes? - No, sir.
well, you will. And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
all right? - Certainly will.
all right.
this sure takes it, huh, Doc?
if Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
can you imagine Franklin on this train eating at the dining car with all the silver?
we shouldn't be here, Doc.
there's gonna be a Hallelujah Day
when the boys have all come home to stay
and a million bands begin to play
we'll be dancing the Victory Polka
and when we've lit the torch of liberty
in each blacked-out land across the sea
Ira! Hey, Ira! We heard the picture was posed!
what?
we heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc!
we're bigger than life, Doc!
and we'll heave a mighty sigh
when each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye
and they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue
the United Nations in review
when this lovely dream has all come true
we'll be dancing the Victory Polka
good job.
thank you.
thank you, girls!
and now, here are the men you've been waiting to meet, the men in white.
right behind me here, the heroes of lwo Jima,
private First Class Rene Gagnon,
private First Class Ira Hayes, and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
thank you.
it's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
we really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
cause we can't win the war without your help.
as far as us being the heroes of lwo Jima, that's just not the case.
we really didn't do much at all.
especially him.
especially me.
I was just a runner. That's it.
we put up a flag.
the pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
we had our picture taken doing it.
the real heroes are dead on that island.
and we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them. Thank you.
jump on any grenades, Ira?
take out any machine gun nests I missed?
at least I fired my weapon.
all right, knock it off.
you hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?
what?
guys! Come on!
stop it. Knock it off.
the tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way
get your savings out when you hear him shout "Any bonds today?
any bonds today?
bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling
any bonds today?
Rene, right here. Sit between these two boys.
here comes the freedom man
asking you to buy a share of freedom today ...for us and they need our help.
and, if you think about it, I think you'll realize that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
we have given too many lives. And its cost...
chocolate or strawberry, sir? - Strawberry.
...has been far too high.
but if we waver now, if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can then those sacrifices would be wasted...
chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
let's move! Go, go!
easy Six, this is Easy Two, over. Where the hell are our tanks?
stuck in the sand. Captain says you're to go without them.
Christ.
that's real good work you're doing there, Rene.
all right, prepare to move out. Pass the word.
second Platoon! Move! Move! Move!
all right, Second Platoon, on your feet! Let's move out!
jackass.
let's move out!
go, go! Move, move, move!
corpsman!
corpsman!
second Platoon, move out!
doc!
doc, get out of there!
corpsman!
doc!
doc, get the hell out of there!
may I have your attention, please.

rochester, New York,
toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.
train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.
okay, let's go. Let's go.
come on, boys. - Let's go.

ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of lwo Jima.
navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
private First Class Ira Hayes.
and Private First Class Rene Gagnon.
Rene! That's my boyfriend!
who the hell is that?
I don't know.
Rene, is that your girl? - Hey, what do they call you?
how about a photo? Hey, look at that!
what's your name, doll? What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
let's go find a saloon.
smile, boys. Give them their money's won'th.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
thank you.
where exactly are you staying?
I'm not sure yet. - Just forget about that.
senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.
doc, right? - Yes, sir. Nice to meet you, Senator.
good to meet you, young man.
now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.
thank you, sir. - Quite all right.
this is Captain White.
Colonel Johns. - We're proud of you, Corpsman.
and then Colonel McCourtney.
major General Green. - Nice to meet you.
senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.
of course!
now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs. Is that true, Chief?
no, sir.
well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?
Attaboy. - This is Captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley. I recognize you from all the photographs. I'm Hank's mom.
it's so nice to meet you, ma'am. Hank was always talking about you.
this is PFC Rene Gagnon.
pleasure to meet you, son. Thanks for everything.
my pleasure. - Not at all.
IRA, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
it's all right.
when I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
it's so silly, isn't it? - No, it's not.
how are you, son? Thank you very much.
we're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
thank you. Excuse me.
I'll make sure he calls. - Well, thank you. Thank you.
are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklirs mother.
it's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
would you mind?
paper said that's Hank, and I honestly can't tell.
it's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
but that's him, isn't it?
well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick, and with everything that was going on it's kind of hard to remember who was where.
but...
Yeah, I think... I think that's where he was.
that's Hank.
thank you.
excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
excuse us.
take him outside.
I'm Pauline.
very nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you.
he was the best Marine I ever knew.
thank you.
you okay, Chief? - Oh, Christ!
I'm okay.
Yeah, you look it. You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
you're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
get some sleep, Ira.
Mike? - Yeah?
you see this? - What?
Mike! - Oh, shit, go!
he's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
what?
well, they're not shooting at us. Maybe we killed them all.
or they ran off in the night or something.
or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
third Platoon! Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
just us? - Yeah, just us, lgg.
all right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want. Get a good shot of my face.
it's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me, too.
lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
don't worry, lggy. They never shoot at the first patrol.
they don't? - No.
they want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay, then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
Really? - Yeah.
unless of course they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
thank God that ain't us.
told you.
boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
set up a perimeter! First Squad!
Hank? Find me a pole. - Yeah.
let's put this flag up.
watch it.
right over here.
right here. That's good. That's good. Right here, right here.
got that end? Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
Hey, who's got rope? - Right here.
give me something. Yeah, good.
that work?
do it, fellas.
keep it coming.
USMC! USMC!
shit, look at that!
jeez, look at that.
get down! Take cover!
cover with that. 30!
watch it! Twenty yards down, Hank! - You see them?
I got about 20 yards, left side. - Lindberg, get the flamethrower!
boots, you see them? - Cover right!
about 20 yards down! Duck one! - You see them?
keep the cover on!
second Squad, you see them?
get me some grenades!
I see them!
you see them?
right flank, over to the right!
cover me, I'm going down!
careful, lggy.
easy.
all clear!
okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
God damn it. Strank! - Sir?
they want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
let me guess, they picked us.
second Platoon, let's go. Get some exercise.
let's go! Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!
get Forrestal! - All right, then.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
well, it was goddamn brilliant. I want that flag, Holland.
mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir. I'll make sure no one touches it.
you can count on me.
fuck that. That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
that son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
he's out of his goddamn mind!
get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.
you've gotta be shitting me.
Gagnon!
get your ass over here.
Hey. Hi, fellas. How's it going?
missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
it's that kind of day.
Hey, Mike. - Hell of a view, Lieutenant.
lieutenant!
captain says he wants that flag.
he wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
we just put the damn thing up. - Yes, sir.
some kind of flag shortage?
he wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
do me a favor and put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
all right, let's find a pole.
take the flag down, boys.
captairs orders.
you heard him, let's do it.
there you go.
lordy, she's a heavy one.
all right, hang on. Put this on.
one hell of a view, huh?
good view from up here. Yes, I'd say so myself.
all right.
not in your way here, am I, Joe? - Nah, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
ready? Ready?
let's go.
you get it?
I don't know. I wish I could've seen their faces.
nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
but your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
all your friends dying, it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
but for putting up a pole?
you gotta be kidding.
Hey! It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
just wait till tonight when it's lit properly and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.
it's gonna look a lot better.
so, stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
you charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.
you smile, you wave. You know the drill.
you want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mache.
Hey, that's show biz.
and try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
the dead guys.
Yeah. Yeah.
okay, not a problem.
good.
but where do we imagine Hank is standing?
sorry?
well, seeing that he wasrt there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
I think you know exactly where he was. You pointed him out to his mother.
this is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.
Hayes! - Oh, for Christ's sake.
Hayes. Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
you wanna do your damn job?
let go of me! Let go of me!
come on!
he's with me!
Hey, he's with me!
back off! - Sir, he's with me. Okay? He's with me.
IRA, put the goddamn chair down!
put the chair down, son! - Put the chair down, Ira!
tell them drop their sticks!
IRA, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.
you're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.
calm down, son. - Sir, turn around, please.
that poster right there? The one on the end, that's him.
that's him? - Yes, sir. You read the papers?
Christ.
we got another fucking hero. Get him out of here.
can you do that? - Yes, sir.
put the goddamn chair down. And let's go.
did you start this?
he didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules. We don't serve Indians.
he needs to go sleep it off.
soldier Field.
you hear that?
what the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
keep an eye out.
it sounds like it's coming from up there.
they're using grenades.
they're killing themselves.
IRA, let's go.
come on.
let's go, Ira. Come on.
thank God. Jesus. Look at you, Chief.
you found him.
holy shit. You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
come on, let's go. Can you walk?
Yes, sir. - By yourself?
all right, look. I don't care if you have to carry him get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
get him in his stuff. I'll stall these guys for as long as I can. Hurry up.
Jesus Christ.
and now, the heroes of lwo Jima!
cover!
I'd like to think that fate had a hand in what happened that summer.
that it was the pants' destiny to find us.
where they came from and why they chose us...
...well, that will always be a mystery.
but perhaps that was part of their miracle.
that they sensed in that moment how much we needed them.
how much we needed some little bit of faith to hold onto...
...when it seemed like everything we believed in was about to slip away.
but wait a minute, i'm getting ahead of myself.
beautiful dress! love it.
we'd been a foursome for as long as i could remember.
where are we going? -we're going over there.
in fact, we were a foursome before we were born.
and seven. anyone feel any kicking?
our mothers met at a prenatal aerobics class.
they really didn't have anything in common...
...except their due dates.
one, and relax. good work.
the first one out of the gate was bridget.
ladies, let's keep it together.
the rest of us followed within the week.
Bridget liked to take charge.
l'll handle this.
and you know what?
sometimes, that worked in our favor.
Oh, my god.
and that's how it always was with us：
give and take.
but mostly give.
Lena, l don't think he's coming back this time.
it's gonna be okay, carmen.
l'll come over first thing tomorrow.
and tibby and bridget too.
just stay on the phone with me until you fall asleep.
what were they thinking? take seven.
we were there for each other...
...to understand the things that no one else in the world could.
what were they thinking, having another baby at their age?
and what was l?
just some experiment from their hippie days...
...and now it's time to start their real family?
go ahead.
they're out of their minds.
lt sucks.
totally. -cut!
Lena, don't you realize this is tragedy?
can't you give me a bit more enthusiasm?
there were some things we would never make sense of.
grief is never an easy burden to bear.
and we were there for those too.
and as we mourn the loss of this beloved wife, mother and friend...
...it only makes her choice that much more unfathomable.
we can only take comfort in the fact that she is in a better place now...
my deepest sympathies. bridget.
we were there for the things we couldn't face alone.
Hey. -hey, bee, you okay?
y eah. l will be as soon as l get out of these stupid heels.
here. hold them for me, will you?
think l'll run home.
or the ones we didn't want to face at all.
together, it was as if we formed one single, complete person.
wild, unstoppable bridget.
shy and beautiful lena.
Tibby, the rebel.
and me, carmen, the writer.
can't buy anything new at a vintage store.
we were 1 6 and had never been apart. and all that was about to change.
how about this one? -lt's great.
who? -'70s tv icon.
am l the only one who's not culturally deprived?
actually, l'm saving them for when l'm stuck doing time at wallmans...
...while the rest of you jet off on your little adventures.
boo-hoo, tibby. y ou are such a drama queen.
l am going to south carolina. that is only, like, three states away.
lt's abandonment, nevertheless. l hate you all.
y ou're the one who wanted to stay here all summer...
...and angst it out making your documentary.
y eah, it's gonna be a huge hit.
thrilling footage on how to stack deodorant.
l think l'm gonna start my own genre, call it the " suckumentary. "
Lena, look at this! oh, my goodness.
they're perfect. -l can't wear a bikini.
don't you know all the beaches in greece are nude?
what? -she's just kidding, lena.
God, l envy you.
y ou get to go to a place where there's actually guys.
l thought you were looking forward to el campo de fútbol.
she sure was until she found out it was girls only.
no boys allowed. -don't talk about it.
Hey, pierce alert, pierce alert.
sorry, young lady, no more holes.
take those out right now and try these on.
look. here you go. -put them on.
go, go, go. -okay, carmen-- carmen.
Tibby, you're a babe!
Tibby, you look amazing. turn around. look at you!
Carmen! -y ou look wonderful.
lt looks good. -lt looked great on you. please buy them.
y ou try them on, then. -but l don't wear jeans.
y eah. or bikinis or miniskirts...
...or anything else that might actually show you have a shape.
l do not.
Tibby, those look so great on you. why can't you just admit it?
because l'm wallowing in self-pity.
Lena! -are you serious?
y ou have a body! -look at that.
Lena kaligaris has a body!
stop it! l do not. -when did this happen?
y ou look good in them. -look at you.
y ou look good! little lena.
y ou're the one who loves jeans so much, why don't you try them?
maybe because l'm 3 inches taller than you. -fair's fair.
Hey, how can they be perfect on you too? -that is a little weird.
l don't know, but it's really starting to freak me out.
okay, carmen, it's your turn.
Carmen, you try them on.
Oh, come on, honestly. are you serious? -y ou have to.
y ou think that a pair of jeans that fits all three of you is going to fit all of this?
put them on. now. -we'll help your thighs get into them.
tibby! come on, now. -l'm just kidding.
will you help me get out of them?
Carmen, we all tried them on. just try them.
all right.
my thighs.
sassy britches.
get over these thighs.
okay, here we go.
what? l told you guys. l'm just gonna take them off...
...and we're gonna pretend like this never happened.
no, carmen, come over here and look at yourself.
they look amazing on you. -look at them.
call me crazy, but it's scientifically impossible...
...that a pair of pants could fit me... -and me.
and me. -and me.
this is crazy.
look, tib, something happened today that l can't explain and you can't explain.
whatever, let's just ignore it. -we can't just ignore it.
Why? -because it's a sign, the pants
be quiet, you're gonna-- -y ou know what, tibby?
sometimes you're much too much. -be careful.
l'm fine, lena. -oh, my god. y ou're gonna fall.
lt makes our butts look good. that's enough for me.
that's right, amen. -get up there. go on.
there is more going here than lycra. -but there's probably lycra.
all right, guys, are you ready for this?
ln the name of the father, the son
here we go. -carmen, this isn't church.
y ou guys! but it's still a sacred place!
l mean, this is where our moms met, right?
anyway, look, we're gathered here today...
...to honor a gift that has been sent to us.
so why do we have to pay for them? -tibs.
Carmen, go ahead, just finish what you have to say.
tonight, on the eve of our separation...
...magic has come to us in a pair of pants.
and l'm proposing that we share them equally...
...and that this summer they travel among us...
...and they'll link us in hearts and spirits...
...even though we're far apart from each other.
l think that tonight we're the sisters of these pantalones.
sisters of the pants? -y es!
we need rules. every sisterhood has rules.
thank you. a manifesto.
okay. -good point. l love it.
okay, rule number one:
each sister is going to keep the pants for...?
a week. -a week.
Lena should be first because greece is the furthest away.
okay. -tibby, you next.
what's your rule? -l don't have a rule.
y es, you do. -tibs, come on.
no picking your nose when wearing the pants.
honestly. -that's not
y ou can casually scratch while really picking a little.
thanks for the allowance. -good rule.
when sending the pants, we'll write a letter...
...detailing the most exciting thing that happened while wearing them.
that's good.
so most exciting thing that happens to you.
and what if nothing exciting happens?
it will. it has to! -no, i really doubt it.
and when it happens, and we reunite...
...we will document it on the pants themselves.
that's good. -that's rule number six.
rule number seven:
any removal of the pants must be done by the wearer herself.
y es, you.
Touche!
he works, you know.
so he may not have that much time to spend with you.
so if you get lonely, come home, okay?
l'm gonna be fine, mom.
we will never, ever wash these pants.
Carmen, that's so unnecessary. why not?
because you can't wash the pants.
Why? why? -carmen, we have to.
what? are you gonna wash the magic out of the pants?
the magic's not sanitary.
no, l have a better one. no double cuffing.
double-cuffing the pants at the bottom, it's tacky.
the '80s are over. -y ou know what else is tacky?
tucking in your shirt and wearing a belt at the same time.
l don't do that anymore. -good one.
l did that one time.
forbidden to cuff or tuck. -okay, okay.
no cuffing or tucking. -my turn, my turn.
okay. -y es, bee?
y ou can never say you look fat while wearing the pants.
y ou can't even think it!
all passengers, this is the final boarding call
take care, and be sure to write, huh?
y ou too. bye.
y ou better get going. looks like they're starting to board.
that's nine. -so we need one more.
we need a final rule. -final rule.
love your sisters and love yourself.
to the pants.
and the sisterhood.
and this summer...
...and the rest of our lives.
together and apart.
y ou know, papou, l really wouldn't mind walking.
l'm sorry that my greek isn't so good.
mom said that l'd pick it up in no time.
y ou know, with all the talking, just with you and with yia yia.
lt's the evil eye.
Lena. l think l'll die and never see my lena.
l think l'll never see you, my lena.
y ou like your room? and your bed?
l have put the most special sheets and lace.
and from this window, the most beautiful view.
she's precious. like a jewel.
we guard you like a jewel.
y ou need rest.
when you hear your name called and the color of your team...
...run over and join your coach.
all right. -alma, megan, green.
Anderson, alice, green.
adissa, jessica, red.
Bo, natalie, red.
come on, come on, rápido!
please, god, let me sprain my ankle as soon as possible.
come again?
this whole thing was my mother's idea. she couldn't wait to get rid of me.
God, mine has been sobbing all week, " what am l gonna do without you? "
l'm like, " get a life, ma, " you know?
what's yours do?
nothing.
Hey, who's that?
don't even think about it. lt's against the rules to have flings with the coaches.
marsden, olivia, red.
come on!
vreeland, bridget, red.
Hey, baby.
here it is. l asked the school to postpone sending this...
...because, dad, l wanted to surprise you.
Ta-da! straight a's. -that's fantastic.
dad, l brought my tennis gear and l have been practicing like crazy...
...so serve to me your absolute hardest. -l'll do that.
y ou know, l was calculating it on the train.
l haven't spent more than four straight days with you since l was 1 0.
l mean, l love it when you come for christmas...
...but a whole summer and just the two of us?
mom taught me how to make arroz con pollo.
wait, where are we?
l have a surprise for you.
l moved out of charleston.
and into a development? dad, you hate developments.
when did l say that?
at the frederick law olmstead exhibit at the smithsonian.
y ou said, " there's city and there's country, and everything else is a wasteland. "
l was 9 years old. y ou came to d. c. for one day to visit with a plastics company.
y ou remember everything!
l don't remember you telling me you moved.
who is that?
ls that your neighbor?
actually, we live together.
Hey!
y ou must be carmen.
y our daddy has told me so much about you.
l just know we're gonna have the most wonderful summer together.
kids! kids, come on out here! -kids?
they're not kids, they're teenagers, just like you.
they live with you?
Carmen, this is krista and this is paul.
we're gonna be bridesmaids together. -excuse me?
l hadn't quite gotten to that part of the surprise yet.
Oh, sweetheart...
we're getting married.
august 1 9th.
say, you're a real natural with that thing.
took me weeks before l got the hang of it.
y eah, well, we all have our special talents.
tibby! l thought l made it perfectly clear...
...that employee headsets are to be worn at all times.
don't make me mention it again.
excuse me?
where are the shampoos?
aisle seven.
somebody help!
girl down.
somebody call an ambulance!
y ou've got a price sticker on your forehead.
l'm sorry...
...l don't speak greek very well.
well, we'll have to work on that, won't we?
thanks for lending me a shirt.
looks good on you.
sorry if it smells like fish.
ls this your boat? -my grandfather's.
y eah. all the ones with the blue flags are his.
do you work for him? -no, just in the summer.
l go to the university in athens.
kostas dounas.
Lena kaligaris.
Lena kaligaris. then you are greek too, eh?
so how do you know english so well?
well, l lived with my parents in chicago until l was 1 2.
Oh, my parents moved to the u. s. too.
but l'm just here for the summer. l'm staying with my grandparents.
l have to throw the small ones back.
would you like to help?
no. that's okay.
okay, here, l'll show you.
give me your hand.
put your hand on my hand.
put your hand close.
good?
luck was on his side today.
l have to go. l should go.
but thank you again for saving my life.
do you dance better than you swim?
excuse me? -saturday night. meet me.
l'm sorry. l can't.
pick it up!
Hi.
Hi. -l'm bridget.
Eric. -l know.
so l hear you go to columbia.
y ep.
well, what have you heard about me?
y our high school won nationals.
MVP. l play forward.
so l've noticed.
l'm 1 7.
come on, l'll race you.
that's it.
seven miles.
Oh, god, don't you love to run?
y eah.
lt's the best high there is.
exactly, it's
lt's like you're just in this place where nothing bad could ever happen, you know?
like if you just push a bit further, if you just keep moving
nothing can touch you.
of course, the endorphins don't suck, either.
so tami's feeling okay? -y eah.
ls she gonna do baton twirling with you?
we don't know yet. she might just have to hold the banner.
sweetheart, why don't we say grace before we start eating dinner?
l would love to. -all right.
bless us, o lord, for these, thy gifts which we are about to receive...
...from thy bounty, through christ, our lord.
Amen. dig in. -this looks great.
l will get that. -oh, it's okay.
we don't answer the phone during dinner.
except that one time. tell us again how you guys met.
we've told that story so many
y ou wanna tell it? -l don't.
want me to? -all right.
l dialed the wrong number. -and l answered.
Lydia answered. -during dinner.
just that one time.
and lydia agreed to go out with a stranger.
ls that not what happened? -oh, no, come on. no, l did not.
that is exactly what happened! -we went bowling. lt was so much fun.
do you remember you bowled a two? -a two is a bad score.
at least l didn't get the ball stuck on my thumb.
the water in the toilet is blue.
blue? -y es, mom, blue.
and by the way, doesn't dad hate bowling?
bowling? -well, he's down here bowling.
and he says grace. -grace?
he says grace, mom. he gives thanks to god before he eats.
we couldn't get him to go to church with us once. who is this guy?
I don't even-- -y ou need to talk to him, carmen.
just tell him how you feel. -l do talk to him. l talk to him all the time.
y eah, like you talk to me? no.
this is important, carmencita. what he did was wrong.
l'm gonna get on a plane and l'm just gonna come down there.
look, you'd never want him to be happy, and that's why you blame him.
and this is gonna work out great. lt's going to be fine.
dear tibby...
...I think we may have been very, very wrong about the pants.
the one time i wore them i almost drowned...
...and then got plucked onto a fishing boat...
...By a guy who made me touch a live fish. it was disgusting!
at least i'm getting some good sketching in.
I love everything about this island.
Oh, except that you're not with me.
infinite X's and o's, lena.
how was town? -fine.
l have found this in the laundry.
ls it yours?
no, actually...
...l sort of borrowed it.
when l went down to the harbor, l went swimming...
...and someone just lent it to me.
Oh, someone. someone who?
a boy?
which one? l know everyone.
don't mind them, they're your cousins.
they're cousins too? how many do l have?
plenty of them. don't change the subject.
out with it. out, out.
his name is kostas dounas.
dounas?
he's a dounas?
y ou must never speak of them.
they are liars! they are thieves! they are barbarians!
y our grandfather would die if he know about this.
y ou must never see this boy again.
y ou understand?
y es. -no, that's not enough.
y ou have to swear.
l swear.
okay.
what am i supposed to be saying here?
Oh, just, stuff about your life.
well, there ain't nothing too interesting.
we're not really looking for interesting. it's just real, you know.
that's the point of a documentary. -a what?
a documentary.
like a movie, only boring.
Hi, l think this is yours. they delivered it to my house by mistake.
they must've got the numbers screwed up.
see, this says 721 and l'm 27 1 . l'm bailey graffman.
y eah, you're the one that fainted the other day, right?
at wallmans. l was there. -oh, yeah.
y ou're the weird girl with the price sticker on your forehead.
wait here, l got something for you.
lt was lying next to you. l opened it to see if there was an ld.
so you ripped off my wallet?
that's kind of like a thank you but different.
l think l had more than $4 in here.
do you seriously think l would steal your money?
l opened it to see if there was an ld in there.
okay? there wasn't. there was a school photo and a pathetic picture of a kitten.
so, what's in yours?
a wallmans' employee card or a license to ride a bike?
excuse me, l get my learner's permit next week and
how old are you, like 1 0?
twelve. -whatever. same difference.
no, when l was 1 0 l didn't have an ipod.
y ou're so cool. what are you listening to, teletubbies hit parade?
y ou woke her up. thank you.
must suck.
what? -having to babysit on your day off.
why are you working there, anyway?
lt just so happens that l need some extra money for new video equipment.
when l finally got around to looking for a new job, wallmans was the...
why am l telling you this? don't you have somewhere to be?
not really.
looks like you got a lot already.
are you making a movie or something? -more like an ode.
to what? -lives of quiet desperation.
fascinating. maybe you need an assistant. -maybe l don't.
y ou wouldn't have to pay me or anything. l could carry equipment and stuff.
Hi, honey.
l'm sorry l'm late.
who's your friend?
she's not my-- -bailey, bailey graffman.
well, l gotta go.
see you around, tibby.
there you are.
Hi. -hey.
we should play tennis tomorrow.
Really? -y eah.
ln the morning? -y eah.
are you ready for this, old man? y ou think your knees can take it?
y ou actually think you can return my serve? -l do, dad. l do.
like to put money on that? -l'll put money on it.
sweetheart? -y eah.
l gotta meet the caterers at the hotel. mind stopping by paul's game?

well, he's an unbelievable soccer player.
we'll just stop for one second, okay?
lt's right on the way. -y eah. y eah, okay.
Hey. -how are you?
good. didn't think your team was scrimmaging till later today.
they're not. l just came out early to check out the competition.
well, you're looking at her.
y ou're awfully sure of yourself, huh?
when l know what l want.
y ou got it!
take it down! take it down!
what's that?!
overtime! all right!
overtime, yes. -which one of those is yours?
Paul, paul rodman.

y eah, he is. -al!
okay. pass!

y ep, nice shot.
we're not worthy! we're not worthy!
sub! vreeland, you're out!

everyone on the team needs to get some.
we know you're a superstar, okay? we got it.
now save it for the championship.
who do we got, deanna? -katie, you're up.
okay, katie, let's go, let's go!
same thing!
nice! get up, wendy! get there! y es!
the hotel that's doing our wedding had a water main break.
the whole place is flooded. -the repairs won't be done for months.
Oh, my god, the place was just so perfect.
l'm never gonna find another place in time.
we will find a place.
l'm sorry.
Lydia never had a real wedding.
my dad died just before my first and...
come on, let's get you home. we'll work this out.
Hey, paul, you wanna play tennis with carmen?
great shot, paul.
what? -lydia needs me, sweetie.
lt'll be a chance for you to get to know each other.
dad, paul doesn't talk.
y eah, he's a little shy.
go on. lt'll be fun.
we'll play tomorrow, okay? -okay.
Oh, my god, are you okay?
Oh, my gosh! are you okay?
l'm so sorry, l'm sorry!
lt's swelling. l'm so sorry.
lt's no big deal. -we should just stop.
l'm tired anyway.
kalimera, lena. -no. l thought-- l didn't
well, here's your shirt. thanks again.
Lena, wait.
l was just about to take her out. come with me?
no. l shouldn't even be here at all.
they told you, didn't they?
y ou think this is funny? our grandparents hate each other.
y ou knew my name. why didn't you say something the other day?
well, because the arguments of old men have nothing to do with us.
well, they're not arguing about nothing. what was the fight about?
what everything here is about:
money and fish.
my grandfather says your grandfather cheat him.
y our grandfather says my grandfather...
...sold him fish that make his whole restaurant sick.
so, what's the truth?
the truth is that it's a beautiful day and...
Mrs. Claus is hot!
my name is Samantha Caine.
at least, l think it is.
you might not believe it, but l was born only eight years ago...
on a beach in New Jersey.
l entered the world fully grown, wearing clothes l don't remember buying.
ln the back pocket, a single key filed blank and faceless.
fitting metaphor, but otherwise no help whatsoever.
none.
sometimes l stand naked in the mirror. Try to guess my age.
maybe 35?
l have lots of scars.
they call my condition "focal retrograde amnesia."
lt's no picnic, but l've learned to live with it.
got a job l love. Been seeing someone.
nice guy. Good sense of humor.
hound of the Baskervilles. - Mad dogs.
Hal? - Yes, Sam.
of all the Christmas pageants l've ever seen...
this is by far the most recent.
for God's sake, Sam, l have teenage girls playing the wise men.
what did you expect? - Teenage boys?
l thought they did fine.
lt was the first Nativity where Joseph stares at the wise men's tits.
her name is Caitlin.
when l woke up on that long-ago day, l was two-months pregnant with her.
l don't know who her father is. l may never. l just know she's mine.
his name is Mr. Perkins. My mom named him for me.
Caitlin, come help in the kitchen!
that's her.
that's who? - Her mom.
she's got amnesia.
swear?
swear.
too weird.
Hello, girls.
Caitlin, come help me in the kitchen.
hurry up, l forget where it is.
Raymond!
catch you smoking, they'll never find the body. Understand?
Yes, Ms. Caine.
have a cookie.
as the year draws to a close...
l would like to share with you just a few things about myself.
things of which l am especially proud.
first, l'm proud to say that...
l don't smoke...
l don't drink...
and l don't swear.
Oh, shit, l do smoke and drink.
to our dear friends.
may the best of your past be the worst of your future.
l'll drink to that.
take a bow, my dear. Take a bow. We got the mistletoe.
eight years.
except for my name, all traces are lost.
l used to hire expensive detectives. Now l use the cheap ones.
doesn't seem to matter. The woman l was...
the one l used to be, she's gone.
l've kissed her goodnight.
police! Don't move!
what the hell is this?
don't give me attitude, sir.
you're assuming l won't shoot your sorry ass.
when you make an assumption, you make an "ass" of you and "umption.
l'm Sgt. Madigan, vice, and if you do cop a 'tude...
l will see to it you spend the next 10 years in prison getting ass-fucked.
lf the case is thrown out because my arrest was violent...
l will hire men to ass-fuck you for the next ten years.
so if you're an ass-fucking fan...
go ahead and mouth off.
meanwhile, you're under arrest for the crime of prostitution.
officer Dunleavy...
read him his rights.
what? - His rights.
you have the "remight"
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say and do...
will be held against you
please, listen, l got a wife.
l never. This is the first time...
l've ever done this. l swear!
sir! Listen to me.
l can see from your choice here, you're not a wealthy man.
because of the damage this arrest could do to you...
l think we might be able to make an arrangement.
Oh, God!
gotta stop using bums.
forget that.
they looked like cops. We pulled it off, didn't we?
lt was embarrassing.
you want me to hire actors?
these guys are cheap. They work for food.
when they puke, is that a like a refund?
what's this? - l got movement on Samantha Caine.
Really?
no, l may have a lead on someone who rented Amnesia Chick an apartment back in 1987.
they may still have some of her stuff.
get outta here.
Where'd that come from?
lucky break.
old lady died, and one of her asshole grandkids found a credit card...
with the name Samantha Caine on it.
tried to use it at Nordstroms.
okay, here's what we do.
get on the phone to Amnesia Chick. Tell her we need more cash.
that was a really swell party.
thanks again for the ride.
you and Hal have been together, what, a couple of years?
how often do you two...
stick our fingers in our hands and pull them out? Every chance we get.
Earl, do me a favor? Every few words blow bubbles and say "hic."
goddamn it, l'm not drunk!
l'll prove it to you.
come on.
stop that!
l'm sorry.
and so much for the skydiving Santa of Hutchinson County.
meanwhile, WlCC news...
journeyed to Honesdale, where Santa's own Mrs. Kringle turned out...
to celebrate her hubby's worldwide tour.
and after one look at her, l'm thinking...
Santa got what he really wanted this Christmas.
the parade included floats and participants from four counties.
everyone enjoyed themselves, especially the young...
and the young at heart.
gotta be fucking kidding!
No!
no fucking way!
lt's impossible!
you rest up...
and l'll see you in the morning.
sweet dreams.
l want a cigarette.
l don't smoke.
you used to.
see how easy it comes back?
l'm coming back.
you know that, don't you?
name's Charly by the way.
you're going to love me.
this is the intergalactic slammer. lt's a jail.
this is the Borian dude. Kind of like a dinosaur.
this is his escape chute. He's mean, quick, and he don't take no shit.
he can shoot at the guards with his arrow.
cool, huh? - Todd.
time for dinner.
now.
guess you better go in.
hope you like the toy.
lt's awesome.
dad, Mom... she gets weird.
like on my birthday when you gave me that Schwinn.
she called the bicycle store to see if there'd been any robberies.
tell her l don't steal them locally, all right?
sorry, but, l can't take this.
you know how Mom will get.
guess l'll see ya.
all right.
how do you like that?
yo, Trin, me. What's up? - Ready to be happy?
remember the landlady l told you about?
the Caine woman was her favorite tenant.
then one day, the tenant never comes home.
old lady very sad. So sad she can't throw away Amnesia Chick's shit.
lt's pay dirt, Mitch. Got an old postcard never mailed.
woman telling everyone she just got engaged.
Samantha's handwriting. Perfect match.
she was engaged to some guy in Jersey. No phone number, just an address.
holy shit! Score!
that's worth time and a half.
double. l made us look good. Her other P. l.s couldn't find dick.
course not. Took a true dick hound like yourself.
tell Ms. Caine l'm coming to see her tonight.
honey, you have an ETA on that carrot?
stow it.
maybe you should just take it with you to school.
you're killing me. You're so funny.
here. Give me the knife.
No!
l'm going to cut this carrot, and you're going to eat it and like it.
piss off.
hon?
look, will you?
how the hell?
l used to do this.
l'm a chef.
look what she's doing.
give me something else.
quick, anything!
tomato. - Tomato.
look.
look at this woman go. All right. - More!
pepper. Pepper!
celery!
look at this!
more!
Scallions!
one more tomato.
look at this woman. She's amazing!
chefs do that.
Timothy, l know you're gonna kill me.
please use the gun, not the knife
as a favor to me l'm begging you.
goddamn it, how can l tell the Feds about the fucking "Honeymoon" thing?
l don't know a fucking thing about it.
no, you don't.
l don't know a fucking thing.
you know, l can tell when someone's lying to me.
what's so fucking important?
remember your old colleague...
one-eyed Jack?
he's doing 7-10 upstate.
not anymore. He broke out. Two days after seeing...
something on TV that "disturbed" him.
Yeah, "Baywatch Nights." You want to get to the fucking point?
under sedation, he said Charly Baltimore's alive, sir.
Daedalus is concerned. He thought you disposed of her eight years ago.
l know it's highly unlikely, but if she were alive, she might be in contact...
with the old man in Massachusetts.
tap his phone.
tell Daedalus l'm on my way. Timothy, out.
l can't see Mr. Perkins.
he's there. He's on the sled, see him?
he's watching you.
he's very excited.
that's better.
ready to try it alone?
l want you to hold my hand.
just pretend l am.
you can do it. Piece of cake.
here we go.
ready?
mom, it won't work. Swear. - Sure it will.
you're one of the X-men. You're tough. Ready? Let go.
3, 2, 1, go! - Wait! l'm not ready!
go!
keep going!
l can't do it.
l want to go home.
l know you're afraid. That's the whole point.
can't you see that?
stop being a little baby and get up.
l can't skate anymore. My wrist hurts.
life is pain.
get used to it.
you will skate all the way to the shore, princess.
and you will not fall again.
am l understood?
l'm just guessing, but...
this is a tree house. l think you wanted a doghouse.
little joke.
she said that her wrist hurt.
l didn't know it was fractured.
l don't remember...
what l said to her.
l can't remember.
No!
l'm not going to hurt you.
lt's not me l'm worried about.
evening, Charly.
long time.
get out!
l want my eye back, bitch!
chefs do that.
Caitlin! Oh, my God! We have to find Caitlin.
slow down! Your kid's okay.
she's in my car.
Jesus! What the hell's going on here?
Freeze!
don't hurt him!
don't shoot!
Yeah, don't shoot! Like she said!
call an ambulance!
this man? He's gonna...
help me find out some things.
so we'll be safe.
you understand?
when will you be back home?
before you know it. l swear.
here.
l want you to keep a candle burning in the window...
for me.
that's called "keeping a vigil."
that's to light my way home.
here.
this is to my portable phone.
l keep it with me.
you call me anytime.
why don't you keep this?
for luck.
let's have Mr. Perkins wear it.
there.
see?
you do what you have to.
but, Sam...
the person you used to be...
whatever you find...
l'm not scared.
l never will be. Not ever.
thank you.
Mr. Perkins...
you lost one of your agents whose training included, among other things...
Counterassassination.
now she turns up as belle of the Christmas parade.
that information is two weeks old, Mr. President.
to my knowledge...
Charlene Baltimore died...
in my employ. Relic of the Cold War.
the kind of violent operative that has since been eliminated from our ranks.
you recruited this woman?
for Chapter, sir.
her father was...
a friend of mine.
stop, l don't want to hear that stuff.
the "intelligence" community.
you people are unbelievable.
you dump a mess like this in my lap...
and then you come whining to me, "Where's our funding?"
l'll tell you where it is.
can you say, "health care"?
l'm not talking 'bout moving in
and l don't want
to change your life
but there's a warm wind
blowing the stars around
and l'd really love to see you tonight l'm not talking 'bout the Linen - And l don't want to change your life - "Moving in."
what?
lt's, uh
the song's not about Linen.
Yeah, whatever.
so, you cold?
Yeah, freezing. - Turn on the heat.
lt doesn't work, but it makes a very annoying noise.
distracts from the cold. - l'll pass, thanks.
who knew l had an old fiance?
and now we're just going to pay a surprise visit?
there are no bells or whistles because l don't remember any of this.
that's too bad. That's the cream of the crop, believe me.
l forgot to ask.
why is it that you got so far?
say what?
well, l mean...
you seem kind of low-rent.
no offense.
none taken. Really, l was about to
shit!
are you okay?
ls your neck all right? You don't have whiplash?
what?
l'm just...
since you almost ran us off the road, l'm wondering what it is...
that you get from an experience like that?
don't get me wrong. l'm sure it's enriching in some way...
and l know she was probably moved by some asshole screaming out the window.
l didn't hang out the window and yell. l checked out her form, okay?
lf it's any consolation, you got her beat hands down.
Really?
Yeah, from the neck up.
this is exciting.
you saw her tits. lt's so neat.
look, it's a guy thing, all right?
now you got a nice body and all...
but those, you could see them coming around the corner.
you got time to comb your hair. Shit.
what's that?
Charly was my name in the dream.
to Charly. Love, Nathan
Nathan J. Waldman, Ph. D.
all right, let's find a phone.
found one.
find his number.
take the stand. - l got it. Now what'll l do with it?
sit down!
Alice, please.
your dog, Alice.
lt and my appetite are mutually exclusive.
what's wrong with the dog? - lt's simple.
he's been licking his asshole for the last three hours.
l submit that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention.
and l think that whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good...
or there to stay.
wouldn't you agree?
Mr. Waldman...
l got your number from a realtor...
in Massachusetts, and l'd just like to speak to you.
who is this?
you tell me, Mr. Waldman.
my full name, please?
God!
lt's really you.
chapter...
they think you're dead.
my full name, please! - You don't know your name?
your full name...
is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.
don't talk, just listen. You could be in danger, understand?
we must meet.
we must meet straightaway. Where are you now?
ln Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.
we'll meet halfway.
there's a town in New Jersey, Chesterman.
tomorrow.
central train station...
at 11 a. m.
meet me.
l'll tell you everything.
signal Daedalus.
we got her.
curry Brand cat food. - Could you spell that, please?
curry Brand.
all this shit is the same anyway.
yeah? You don't happen to have a cat?
what do l need a cat for? l got a girl.
Yeah, pussy's pussy.
mom, can l stay up for "Rugrats"? - What, sweetie?
"Rugrats." l want to stay up.
Yes, you can stay up for "Rugrats.
l'm gonna go now.
all right.
mommy loves you. - l love you too.
big kiss.
Bye, Mommy. - Good night.
put my glasses in my pocket
put the jacket on the chair l sing the things l do, so l won't forget.
like...
turning off the downstairs' light
before l go to bed at night
shit.
l can't take this...
fucking waiting.
excuse me.
do you normally curse this much?
what are you, a Mormon?
Yes, that's why l just smoked a pack of Newports...
and drank three vodka tonics. What l'm saying is...
back when we first met you were all like...
Oh, phooey! l burned the darn muffins.
now, you go into a bar...
ten minutes later sailors come running out. What up with that?
thanks for sharing.
mind your own damn business.
while you're at it, if you're going to smoke inside...
close the damn door.
l heard you scream
shit!
Henessey...
l didn't know about the gun. l wasn't hiding things. l swear.
goddamn it, stop walking! - l'm going home!
and so are you!
l paid you!
well, here! Take your money!
take it!
l can't go home.
until l know why that man tried to kill me, l'm trapped.
lt's like l'm in a goddamn prison! Do you know how that feels?
Yeah, l know exactly what that's like!
four years inside. Marion, lllinois.
a real shithole!
and l'm not going back!
seven years ago l was an Atlanta cop.
me and my partner handled a lot of impounded shit.
that motherfucker hated me.
l forget why, but he did.
on one weekend...
when he was conveniently away...
some bonds disappeared from his office.
lo and behold, when my brothers in blue responded to an anonymous tip...
you'll never guess what they found sitting in my closet.
the bonds.
your partner put them there.
no, l did.
l stole the damn things.
l never did one thing right in my life. You know that?
not one.
that takes skill.
you just missed our exit.
give me back my money.
Oh, so you're
l'm taking you to the train station, yes.
to meet Mr. Waldman.
here you go. Merry Christmas.
bah humbug.
look out the window. Shut up.
you know we're about ten minutes early.
l've got a bad feeling about this.
put my keys in my left pocket - Gun in the right-hand side - lt makes a bulge you can see.
l should stick it in my pants and shoot my damn dick off?
now you're a sharpshooter?
going to shake hands with the man - How you doing? - Hi.
lt's for you.
another in a long line of...
bad personal investments.
excuse me? - Just saw the ring on your finger.
do l know you from somewhere?
back up. Total pickup line.
forget l said it. l take it back.
thank you for the beer, but...
l don't know you, no.
no, you don't.
l can tell when someone's...
lying to me. l'm sorry to have bothered you.
yours?
who's your boyfriend?
some guy.
okay, people, l got what l need.
move in. Do them both.
that man walking this way.
ls that him?
l think so.
Mr. Waldman?
gun!
Jesus wept!
let's go!
we got to get to the car. This way!
come on!
go! Go! No! Come on!
no, this way!
move it!
come on, Ms. Caine! Come on!
Oh, shit!
take this! l got three shots left in this revolver.
you got a full clip. Just point...
and spray. Okay?
ready? And...
fuck it! Run for your life!
there's no way out!
jump! - That's a three-story drop!
are you crazy?
what happened? - l saved your ass. lt was great!
we've got to get to the car!
this way. Come on!
get down!
get down!
get in, both of you!
now!
l said now!
we jumped out of a building!
Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorrow we go to the zoo.
you're Waldman.
no, l'm the Hill Brothers bean buyer. Who else would l be? Hang on.
lf you want me to talk in front of him, you may be asked...
to kill him later.
lt works for me. Your call. Fire out the back if you have to.
old man, how many of those you got? - Three.
one shoulder, one hip and one here...
right next to Mr. Wally.
most patdowns never reveal it as an agent's often reluctant to feel up...
another man's groin.
other questions?
what's the weather like on your planet?
Charlene, my darling.
my name is Samantha, Samantha Caine.
no, forget all that. The schoolteacher business...
was your cover. Do you hear me, Charly?
your memory was gone. You bought your own cover.
lt was a fantasy for Christ's sake!
Samantha Caine never existed.
you wrote the bloody thing!
no, it's not a fantasy. l'm in the goddamn P.T.A!
then quit!
you're an assassin working for the United States Government.
l ought to know.
l trained you.
get the fuck out of here!
assassin!
your father was...
in the Royal lrish Rangers, assigned to Belfast.
after he was murdered there in 1975...
his friend, Perkins, adopted you, or perhaps l should say...
recruited you, to work for Chapter...
a blackbag operation working from the U. S. State Department.
you getting this?
october, 1988, you were assigned...
to take out a munitions dealer named Daedalus...
and his hired enforcer, Timothy.
you failed to complete your mission...
electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary.
dead you remain. Until without preamble...
you reemerge eight years later and a good deal frumpier.
anyhow, l think we can safely assume...
that Daedalus is aware of your resurrection...
and attempting to reverse it.
he'll be watching the police, hospitals. We must stay away, understand?
Mr. Henessey, can l help you?
henessey, what is it?
lt's a setup. lt's got to be. - Put that down.
this is not an episode of television.
those guys back at the train station.
how'd they know we'd be there? lmpossible! Unless Waldman told them.
l did nothing of the kind. - They tapped your phone.
l know it sounds preposterous.
just happen to know we'd be calling?
get in the car. - All right.
see here, my friend.
Oh, shit!
get in the car, now!
how about it? You believe any of the crap that guy said?
well... no.
that guy was a lunatic.
we got to talk to someone else.
you thinking what l'm thinking?
l hope not because l'm thinking how much my balls hurt.
but if you're talking about the postcard...
l don't think l want to meet any more of your old friends.
we have no choice.
we need some answers, or we're gonna die.
l saw you from the road.
l think your name is Luke...
and l think l was going to marry you.
Charly
Oh, baby!
Oh, man.
Luke.
she's my only daughter...
and l don't quite trust you yet.
so what about it?
you and Mr. Outdoors bump pelvises? - lt's possible.
and how about your daughter? What's her name, Cathead?
Caitlin. - You think he might be the father?
l don't know. But all these little details about him are coming back.
l'm remembering things. - Like what?
ls this "America's Funniest Practical Videos" or something?
keep your fucking hands where l can see them!
l had an itch.
Charly, this is crazy.
you and me, we were like...
don't you remember? Hell, you pursued me.
l know that he has a pin in his leg. Car accident.
l know he cuts his own hair.
he doesn't own a TV.
he sits down when he pees.
that's enough. l'm getting a boner.
l know this man. l must have been seeing him.
let me talk to him.
alone.
l'm sorry.
do you want to take a walk?
got me a handgun
got a rifle too
anybody fuck with Mitch
he know just what to do 'Cause l'm a
bad motherfucker
stay quiet and drop the rifle.
how'd you find us?
there may be many reasons not to kill you...
but among them is not that you'll be missed by NASA.
l found the address in your coat.
here. Between the address of a topless bar...
and a picture of what looks like a man's penis.
that's a duck, not a dick.
the man she's with. Who is he?
her former fiance. His name's Luke.
former fiance? That's ridiculous. She was never engaged.
l just went through this with her. She knows how the man pees.
look at him. He's cool.
former fiance.
why on earth would she think that? - We found a note.
lt's in her handwriting.
she saw a note? - Who are you, William Shatner?
calm down.
Yeah, a note to her uncle. - Max?
uncle Max!
that's the agency, you blithering idiot!
and the word "engaged" means she's locked on to target. Fuck!
not a former lover but a target? - Her target, yes!
she knows things because she studied the bastard to assassinate him.
shit!
Sam! - Charly!
he's Daedalus!
get out of there! lt's him!
well, howdy there.
lf it isn't the forgetful spy. How you feeling?
you're the man from the bar.
will you look at her. She's not faking it.
she doesn't know me from Adam.
lt's not that l don't trust my compadre here, Major Baltimore.
ln fact, l had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine.
until you showed up here.
you follow?
l'm trying to pull off the biggest job of my career...
so, darling, l have to know...
how much about me you really remember.
and who you've told.
l haven't told a soul. l swear.
we'll soon know.
what is this? Some kind of torture thing?
torture, yes.
a woman's face never looks...
quite so beautiful as when it's distended in pain.
witness...
the beauty of childbirth.
untie me, and l'll make any face you want.
let's not and say we did.
take a deep breath.
we're gonna do the torture thing.
operation Honeymoon is on schedule.
l've secured the tanker.
now l just got to make the soup.
l'll follow as soon as l'm done here.
ten minutes in this cold water, she'll be insane or dead.
five minutes. She'll tell me everything l need.
that's right. Take in all the air you can.
lf you need to vomit, do it now.
so you...
don't remember anything at all?
best night of your fucking life.
l say drown the wench.
talk to me, Major.
ls my identity safe?
my name is Samantha Caine.
answer the question.
who knows about me?
nobody!
fuck you!
fuck you!
l hate to see you like this, Charly.
l heard you were a hell of a spy once.
watch your back.
l'm not done yet.
Goodnight.
okay, l'll signal Daedalus. Your money will be waiting.
Jack...
do yourself a favor, man.
don't let her looks fool you.
she's the fucking Energizer Bunny.
just do her and dump her.
don't get cute and play doctor first. l made that mistake.
nearly killed me.
little fucker.
Daedalus...
l'll make you a deal.
let me go now...
and l'll leave you the use of your legs.
why have you resurfaced?
ls it Operation Honeymoon? ls that it?
who sent you?
why are you here?
l let you touch me, cowboy.
l think l need a bath.
Samantha, please.
who's Samantha?
Where's Henessey?
Hey, Mitch!
you're awake.
you're seeping.
here...
look at this.
Oh, shit!
that hurt like shit.
l know. That's why l distracted you first.
same principle as deflowering virgins.
what? Virgins? What?
l read it in this Harold Robbins' book. The guy bites her on the ear.
distracts from the pain. Ever try that?
no, l sock them in the jaw and yell, "Pop goes the weasel."
who the fuck are you?
name's Charly, the spy.
nice to meet you.
drink?
as you can see, things are still crazy, but the sheriff has told me this:
there have been gunshots
okay, let's say l buy it.
you are a trained killer.
l can't even say that with a straight face.
so, Samantha, she...
never really existed.
like Nathan said. She was a total fabrication.
l made her up.
so now she's just gone?
forever and ever? - Thank God!
look at my inordinately large ass.
look what she did to me.
pretty convincing act.
l guess.
you know...
her personality had to come from somewhere.
change the subject.
better yet. Bring me that bottle.
here you go. Drink up.
so what's next?
what do we do now? - l contact Chapter.
l come in for debriefing. Bury the last eight years.
get back to work.
Cheers!
would you believe it, Harry?
we got an appropriations review in three weeks...
and now the President wants to know how l managed to lose an agent.
Yes, sir, you have a call on line three, sir.
you going to tell me who it is?
Charly Baltimore, sir.
run a trace.
this is Mr. Perkins.
turn on the TV. Farm in New Jersey. Seven dead.
good Lord, girl, we've been looking all over for you.
l got a photo of you in a Christmas parade.
what the hell is happening?
don't be stupid.
l completed my assignment.
you mean Daedalus?
l shot him. He's pretty much dead.
actually l would have done it earlier, say in '92...
but l was baking. Don't ask.
l want to come in.
sure.
of course.
let me direct you to a safe house.
forget it.
we play it my way.
you want me back, then you stay away. l'll call you.
those are the rules, understand?
shit!
did you hear that?
lf she got to Daedalus...
she could know about Honeymoon.
she might know that old targets are now your new best friends.
that could be trouble.
goddamn you.
there were weapons on that farm. She's armed.
stop having kittens.
you're the head of a major spy network, and you have a tendency to whine.
she could compromise this entire operation.
we have 24 hours.
we find her...
and we kill her.
do whatever it takes but be careful.
lf it gets out you're working for me...
l'll be grabbing my ankles on the White House lawn.
the lady's wacked. She's lost it. l gotta get out of here.
l need you to meet me.
l'll sneak out to this phone and call you at midnight with the details.
all right, Sam, what did that accomplish?
l'm testing our boy Perkins. Got a light?
l don't really trust him.
come again?
little experiment.
lf he was looking for me in Pennsylvania, he tapped your office.
you mean he just traced that call?
come midnight, you hang by the phone.
lf he wants to erase me...
he'll send someone to kidnap and torture you for my whereabouts.
ln which case, hey, l don't trust him.
no. Time out.
l haven't had a date in eight years, Mitch.
ls this a fun date?
what's going on?
true love.
shut the fuck up.
a beautiful...
white lady seducing the colored help.
get real, sweetheart. l ain't handsome. l ain't rich...
and the last time l got blown, candy bars cost a nickel.
what's going on? - Chemistry. Go figure.
chemistry, my ass!
you know what l think?
l think this is why you'd fuck me.
to kill a schoolteacher.
to bury her once and for all.
l kind of like that schoolteacher.
when she comes back, you give me a call.
Oh, and call your fucking kid.
lt's two days to Christmas.
she might be under the mistaken impression Mommy gives a fuck.
l didn't ask for the kid.
Samantha had the kid, not me!
nobody asked me!
good evening, lady. How about some company?
no, thanks. l'm saving myself until l get raped.
step in the alley.
l ain't asking you. l'm telling you.
fuck.
goddamn it.
you're early. So Perkins wants me dead? What's the rush?
why don't you go away and come back at midnight? Shoo!
honey, this is a real big fucking gun.
this ain't no ham on rye, pal.
what the hell are you doing?
saving your life.
l'd have been here sooner, but l was thinking of the ham-on-rye line.
you think l can't take him?
you probably scared the others away. - What others?
headhunters, nimrod. They don't travel alone.
were you always this stupid, or did you take lessons?
lessons.
Hey! - What?
l still got this fucking gun.
fuck this!
put that away.
l'm out of here.
Perkins, you prick.
now you want me dead. Why? What's going on?
easy, sport.
l got myself out of Beirut.
l think l can get out of New Jersey.
don't be so sure. Others have tried and failed.
the entire population in fact.
question.
you keep saying "l" this, "l" that, like...
lt's like you don't need me anymore.
good point.
get in.
found a use for me, huh?
Yep.
l'm leaving the country, Mitch.
l need a fake passport and money. Lots of it.
why didn't you say so?
hold on a minute while l pull that out of my ass.
the key, Mitch. The one l keep on the charm bracelet.
lt opens box 227 in a bank in Buffalo.
how the fuck would you know? The numbers are filed off.
l filed them off.
there's a briefcase...
in box 227. lt's got cash and lDs in it.
l need you to get them for me.
l should of known.
so where's this charm bracelet?
Yeah, well...
that's the thing about being a secret agent.
nothing is ever simple.
drive past. Don't slow down.
park under those trees.
honk if there's any trouble.
Yes'm, Miss Daisy, l be honking.
good morning.
good morning, Ms. Caine.
what have we learned about the dangers of smoking?
give it here.
Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me...
l'll blow your fucking head off.
fuck!
you're about to have 24 children.
merry Christmas.
so, how far to the money?
hour, tops.
haven't seen a cop in a while.
so, Mitch.
still think l'm warm and fuzzy?
Yeah, sure.
anything?
phone bill...
Christmas card.
you know, you could've aimed for those guys' shoulders.
back off, man.
l'm thinking...
maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act.
you had amnesia and all, but...
l think maybe you forgot to hate yourself...
for a while.
what the fuck is that?
lt's me. l got your kid.
give your location. Don't waste time.
state road 5.
15 minutes east of Union Springs, New York.
l don't like cellular phones, so here's what we do.
go to the Holiday lnn nearest you. There's one in Cayuga.
be there when l call in 15 minutes.
who?
he's got the kid. - Timothy?
he's routing me to a landline.
he doesn't want to talk over the airwaves.
Oh, shit!
maybe we can trace him.
trace him? How? lt's a random motel.
how long did he give you? -15 minutes.
fuck, why don't we try the phone company?
think you can get here in under 15 minutes?
nobody move!
you.
you've got 40 seconds to run a patch for me.
everybody up! Against the wall!
holiday lnn, Chet speaking.
l'd like to page Charlene Baltimore, please.
please hold.
lt's me.
no shit. Verify you have the kid.
how else would l get your cellular number?
l got it off the cast on her right wrist.
right below "Mommy loves you.
l offer up a simple trade.
you for the girl.
l'll tell you where and when. And Charly?
you fuck with me...
l'll blind the kid...
and shoot out her knees.
give me an ANl trace.
do it.
how do you know so much about this Timothy character?
what do you think? l bumped pelvises with him.
he was a target, remember?
ma'am?
that call was placed from Niagara Falls.
Niagara Falls?
operation Honeymoon.
Bingo!
Perkins.
what's he doing here?
timothy acting alone...
we had a chance.
Charly's hooked.
all we gotta do is set a time and a place.
my God, we're monsters.
you talk to me about Honeymoon.
tanker's ready.
one terrorist on ice waiting to play patsy.
and no loose ends?
no, not that l can tell.
the Feds are going to find him...
crashed in a ravine five miles from the blast site.
l'm not a complete ogre.
the young one gets a doll to play with at Christmas.
Oh, fuck you.
l think l should go in first.- Negative.
you'd just screw it up.
l'm a much better shot up close.
you couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom. Forget it.
here.
the guards are at 126. 9 megahertz.
you meet me...
at 127. 1, you need to talk.
as soon as you spot me with the kid, you start laying down cover fire.
all right.
they're going to blow my head off, you know.
this is the last time l'll ever be pretty.
northeast sector, all clear.
bogey.
round her up, gentlemen.
l want her alive and unmarked.
she's got the kid!
l smell gasoline.
you have a little accident?
l got plenty of matches. Be a bad way for a kid to go.
30 seconds. Think it over.
pick him up.
l'm gonna miss you, Major.
you ought really to have stayed dead. You don't know the rules anymore.
tell me about it.
eight years ago, this guy was on the hit list.
budget cuts, dear.
congress blinded us overseas.
l was forced to turn to any eyes and ears l could find...
even if it meant recruiting the "bad guys" here.
budget cuts.
ls that what this is about?
operation Honeymoon.
fuck me!
you're running a fund-raiser.
fund-raiser?
1993
world Trade Center bombing, remember?
during the trial, one of the bombers claimed the ClA had advance knowledge.
the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was ClA.
lt's not unthinkable they paved the way...
for the bombing purely to justify a budget increase.
you're going to fake a terrorist thing to scare money out of Congress?
unfortunately...
l have no idea how to fake killing 4, 000 people.
so we're just going to have to do it for real.
blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
then l get my funding.
Goodnight, old girl.
Timothy, l'll be in Chopper 1.
no, just her.
l'll be waiting for you to come rescue me.
be just a minute.
so, you plant this poor Arab to take the fall.
what's going out in the tanker?
come on.
l'm going to die. l want to know.
chemical bomb.
chain reaction.
once started, it can't be stopped.
the catalyst injected into the tanker heats up.
we pull the truck into the center of town.
goes critical around midnight.
farewell.
adieu.
please.
let my kid go.
l'm about all out of favors, Chuck.
l'm already letting you spend time with her while you freeze to death.
they're going to find your bodies...
somewhere in Pennsylvania.
and you're just going to be...
written off as some crazy mommy who kidnapped her own kid...
and died with her in a blizzard.
goddamn you.
look at her eyes.
why exactly would l want to do that?
because they're yours.
that night...
with you, l got pregnant.
the little girl is your daughter.
that's priceless.
would you bring my little bitch in here?
Hi, princess.
you mind if l take a look at your fucking eyes?
we're going to take a nap together.
like the bears in winter.
Yeah, bears. Thank you. Thank you!
we'll fall deep asleep.
lt ain't over.
you're going to die screaming.
and l'm going to watch.
am l telling the truth?
mommy, it's cold in here.
just for a minute.
polar bears, remember?
open.
okay, step over this way.
now.
give me a spark.
sorry to keep you waiting. - For you, Tim?
always a pleasure to wait.
l wanted to tell you this story. The Grinch, like a mean fucker...
but
come on! Do it!
do it!
lt being Christmas Eve, l'm going to give you a choice.
the knife?
or the gun?
do it!
mommy, don't cry.
l keep these here for lighting your candle.
l love you!
Sam called Washington.
by morning this place will be crawling with Feds.
we'll be gone by then.
Yeah, that's what l'm saying.
couple of those Feds said they couldn't sleep and might come early.
that tanker goes bang at 312 degrees Celsius.
right in the center of town.
25 minutes from now.
mommy, am l gonna die?
no, baby.
you're not going to die.
they are.
cover your ears.
should we get a dog?
Bye, Mitch.
thanks for coming.
you foxy bitch!
mommy! - Run!
hide!
Yeah, Sam. They don't know who they're fucking with.
where the fuck is that kid going?
shit!
move it out!
and find that bitch!
all right, people, listen up.
nothing changes.
LCY roads. Five miles past the town limit.
plant the car in the ravine and get your asses out of there.
Where'd you go, baby?
show Mommy.
Sam, are you out there?
Sam, where are you?
Mitch, l don't believe it!
l just saw Caitlin climb in the back of the truck.
she's locked in the tool box.
left rear. - Jesus, the truck is a bomb!
tell me something l don't know.
timothy rigged it.
312 degrees, it goes boom. We have 20 minutes, tops.
l'll go in and get her.
no chance. - l'm close.
l make it a dozen, with automatic weapons.
kill them, bitch! What are you good for?
you can do this.
just do one thing right.
talk to me, Mitch.
please.
goddamn it.
on your nine, Mitch!
30 degrees left.
left!
your other left!
they've got you flanked!
get out now!
move it out! Let's go!
listen up. She's going to make a try for the payload.
units 2 and 4, watch your back.
sky 1, get me a chopper in the air. l'm on my way. Out.
let me through.
out!
clear out! This truck's going to blow up!
sir, she's got the truck. She's headed out of town.
l'm hurt real bad, maybe dying.
continue dying. Out!
head her off. Please!
what the fuck!
not fair!
not fucking fair!
get out of the way!
hang on, Catey!
suck my dick, every one of you bastards.
Oh, honey...
only four inches?
you'll feel me.
mommy!
must be in the truck.
get away from her!
help!
mommy, l hit my head. - Come on.
run.
get out.
don't go away again. Please!
the truck is a bomb.
lt's going to blow up.
go.
l'm right behind you, baby.
go. Don't look back.
good girl.
here! Over here!
mommy, no!
lt's okay.
l'm sorry l left.
please, get up.
Charlie Team 1, we are ready to advance.
Charlie 1, that's a negative. Orders are to...
stand down until notified.
stop it.
stop being a little baby.
get up now. You're not dead.
don't you die! You get up now!
life is pain!
you just get used to it!
stand up right this minute, Mommy!
you're grounded.
get me to the bridge!
l'm not leaving until l know...
that bitch is dead!
somebody!
help me!
l got a kid here!
l got my eight-year-old daughter. Do you hear me?
somebody get this motherfucker off me!
help me. - Negative, ma'am.
we understand your request, but
that's right! You can't kill me, motherfuckers!
get in.
stay here.
l'm here!
l'm here, you bastard.
die screaming, motherfucker!
don't let her get to the border! Cut them off!
don't hit the cars!
l'm sorry.
l can't drive anymore.
you okay?
are you stupid?
Hey, gorgeous...
you got your mama's eyes.
don't let nobody tell you different.
hang in there, partner.
did you forget we're rich?
l'm putting your call through to the President.
Hello, Ms. Caine. - Yes, Mr. President.
l owe you...
the country owes you, a debt of tremendous gratitude.
l wonder, would l be out of line if l asked you to come back into government?
work for the State Department?
out of the question, sir. l have a stack of papers to grade.
the money involved would be...
substantial.
you'd be surprised how much a good teacher can earn.
Oh, gosh, l know, and l am working on it.
but it's for next term.
before l go, sir. There is a small favor l'd like to ask.
welcome to "Larry King Live." We seek closure in the Perkins' matter...
he's been indicted on six counts of high treason.
joining us is ClA Section Chief, Walter Hodge.
he's in Langley, Virginia.
at our studio in New York, intelligence analyst...
Jack E. Wadsworth.
and in our studio here, Pittsburgh native Mitchell Henessey who in a surprise press conference was singled out by the President of the United States for his role in this affair.
as they say, "That ain't hay." Hello, Mitch, and thanks for coming.
thank you, Mr. K, for having me.
Mitch, you have had one hell of a Christmas Eve.
we've heard from our reporter, Carla Grebs, in Niagara Falls...
that when she first heard the story, she didn't believe it, right?
what Carla failed to realize, Mr. King, is that...
l am always frank and earnest with women.
ln New York, l'm Frank. ln Chicago, l'm Ernest.
Yeah, l could just sit out here forever.
couldn't you?
go, go, go, go!
clear. Clear.
we clear here .
surveillance had them all going inside 45 minutes ago.
did anyone bail out on the perimeter?
no, ma'am. All secure out here.
boss, this isn't a meth lab.
so why an escape tunnel?
need to take a look at this.
when?
did they raise the terror alert?
no, that's probably best.
all right, get everybody in now.
I'll be there in a minute.
what's going on?
nothing. I just have to go to the office.
it's 6: 15, and you're talking about a terror alert?
it's bad, isn't it?
I don't know yet.
please don't lie to me.
it might be.
I may not be home tonight.
I mean, I might be home late.
I know.
shoot. I forgot.
tomorrow is the day we scheduled to take jack to have his pictures taken.
don't worry about it. I'll reschedule.
no, no, no, no. Go ahead and take him, and I'll do my best to be there, ok?
just come back safely.
I will.
Bye.
everybody, meet agent prentiss.
you had a date. I've been filling her in on protocol.
we can make nice later. What do we know?
the dea raided what they thought was a hardened meth lab right here in northern virginia, but they found this instead.
that could be a dispersal device for a chemical weapon.
sophisticated.
homeland security's thinking al qaeda.
they've developed devices that span the spectrum of sophistication, some as simple as soda bottles and paint cans.
they're called al ikhteraa.
literally "the invention." - They are.
do we know what the biological or chemical agent is yet?
no, not yet.
the cell members bailed out through a tunnel.
the dea recovered a nextel 2-way and managed to intercept a message.
that's not the transcript. No, it's in arabic.
our friends surprised us and eloped.
we can no longer wait for the wedding as planned.
we can deliver our gift at the next crescent.
I lived in several middle eastern countries growing up.
next crescent?
muslims sometimes use a lunar calendar.
I'd have to look it up... - next crescent moon is in 2 days.
so whatever they're attacking, it's happening in less than 48 hours.
it sounds like it, sir.
payment for the nextel is linked to this man.
literally soldier of god.
that's pretty poor operational security for a sophisticated plot.
2 months ago, jind allah was captured leaving the U. S.
using a forged pakistani passport via richmond international airport.
he's been held as a ghost detainee in guantanamo bay ever since.
so technically, he doesn't exist.
soldier of god isn't a name.
no, it's most likely a name taken on for the jihad, meaning struggle.
extremists claim it's a holy war.
yet the words "holy" and "war" never appear together in the qu'ran.
do we know his real name?
CIA interrogators have gotten nothing out of the guy.
they need us to break him.
we do know from past intercepts that he's a recruiter.
he came into this country to assemble the omega cell, a sleeper cell with an unknown mission.
we have 48 hours to do what the cia hasn't been able to manage in 2 months.
we could be looking at the first attack on our soil since 9/11.
Hey. Car here? I told reid 5 minutes.
I think you should take prentiss with you to guantanamo.
excuse me? She could be of help.
I don't know enough about her abilities.
there's plenty for her to do back here.
I don't know what she's capable of either, but we've got to find out sooner or later.
well, it's an interrogation, not a training exercise.
she's the only member of the team fluent in arabic.
well, there are other translators.
Yeah, but they haven't studied behavior.
she ever have her ready bag yet?
my guess is there isn't much this woman's unprepared for.
car leaves in 4 minutes.
Yes, sir.
the old term used, some of the best lessons are learned from past mistakes.
the error of the past is the wisdom of the future.
excuse me, sir.
I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate
do not thank me.
sir? - It's not a favor.
of course. I know that.
you're coming to do a job.
do you think the interrogation of jind allah will work in time?
interrogation's the most dynamic form of profiling.
that's not an answer.
sir.
he's been locked away in gtmo.
he doesn't know we raided the cell's safe house.
that's an advantage for us.
the main thing is to get him talking about anything.
then his language and body movements will betray him.
it's like this-- you just focus on the way your opponent holds his piece.
how quickly and firmly he places it. Then you watch his face and body.
it'll telegraph a player's strategy, his training, maybe his motivations.
is that what you need us to do?
no. I need you to listen.
you're fluent in arabic.
I won't know the nuances like you.
every word, every phrase.
be on the lookout for subtext, ulterior meanings.
what do you want me to do?
I want you to watch for tells.
Non-verbals, micro-expressions.
watch him when he's comfortable and relaxed, then note the behavioral changes when he's under stress.
if we can establish a baseline, we'll be able to read him once I challenge his belief systems.
before I can get him to give up where or how they'll attack,
I'll first have to cause him to reveal something of himself.
game oveR.
what are you talking about?
Gtmo's runway is perpendicular to cuban airspace, so approaching aircraft have to negotiate a last minute 90 degree right turn in order to land.
they call it the gtmo twist.
I was winning.
actually, he would have had you in 3.
DEA team. We ran this raid.
this must have slowed you down some, huh?
enough for them to get out through the tunnel.
they must have done escape drills.
Hey, morgan.
Hey, kenny. Been a minute, man.
Yeah.
we good in here? - Yeah, don't worry about it. Everything's been rendered safe.
these guys weren't messing around.
Hotch, these tubes surround what would be the explosive charge.
and this cylinder right here?
it's gotta be where they put whatever bio or chem agent they plan on dispersing.
that's happy thought.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
looks like a 4 man cell.
they assimilated into the community.
just like any other suburban gangster wannabes rolling at the mall.
who do you think we're dealing with?
most likely middle eastern males in their early twenties.
and judging by that device out there, they're looking at significant targets:
military installations, government buildings.
you must be the bau boys.
and gal. Pardon me.
I'm jason gideon. - Andy bingaman, fbi.
agent prentiss, dr. Reid.
I'm the intelligence supervisor here at gtmo.
you guys having a hard time getting jind allah to talk?
not only can't they get him to budge, but 2 weeks ago, word got out that one of the other detainees was spilling secrets.
jind allah managed to have a 3 minute conversation with him in the shower line.
that night, the other detainee committed suicide.
he's reciting the qu'ran from memory.
he's most likely a hafez.
he must have done it a dozen times since he's come to this facility.
some muslim children are able to do it since age 12.
2 months of interrogation, that's all the cia's been able to get out of him.
there are cuts and bruises under his right eye socket.
what kind of tactics are they using?
I control the actions to the detainees, but I can assure you, my protest about their methods has been ignored.
let the interrogation proceed normally.
I'm gonna interrupt and demand they stop harassing.
maybe I should tell them in advance.
no, it's better if they don't expect it.
the reaction will be more visceral, more believable.
go ahead with phase 2 as planned. - Got you
you really gonna put a show on for these guys?
no, no for them.
for jind allah.
he's needs to see me as a complete contrast to what he's come to expect from his captors.
it's the best way to jump start him into talking.
we have less than 36 hours.
have at it.
you 2 ready?
Yeah, this way. - Thank you.
do you understand?
every day
who the hell are you?
supervisory special agent jason gideon.
I'm an fbi behavioral analyst.
it's time to show this man some respect.
you gotta be kidding me.
you have orders from agent bingaman to leave so I can speak with this detainee alone.
I'm sorry for the treatmentyou've suffered.
if you don't mind, I'd like to spend some time with you.
he stopped his recitation.
he's sizing gideon up.
if I don't mind?
like to get to know you as a person.
your faith, your ideology.
to what end?
studying human behavior is what I do.
you know, if these guys are fundamentalists, you'd think they'd have qu'rans, prayer mats.
no. We didn't find any of that here.
they must have at least one other location.
Hotch. what is it ?
that looks like a list of chemicals.
I'm gonna check with garcia.
go, doll.
Hey, I'm gonna read off a list to you. it's criminals
I'd like to believe, with greater understanding one day, we can come to a peaceful resolution of our differences.
is that so?
look, I don't know what you've done or what you may have planned to do.
but unlike the other detainees here, you have the education, intelligence to convey the nuances of your culture.
that's what interests me.
until I don't give you what you want.
then you will resort to other tactics.
I swore an oath to uphold the united states constitution, no matter where I am, no matter who I deal with.
you're sure?
all right.
What'd she say?
Garcia says this looks like a list of additives needed to weaponize anthrax.
could they get enough anthrax?
the letter sent to senator tom daschle's office in 2002 only contained 2 grams of purified spores, enough to kill 25 million people if effectively distributed.
are you willing to have a chat with me?
go ahead. Good.
let's chat.
he's from egypt. Cairo.
you sure?
no, he could be yemeni, but odds are he's egyptian.
what type of name is gideon?
American.
I often forget that in your country you put your country first and your god last.
sir, he was born and raised in egypt.
they pronouce "j" sounds as a "G.
you don't consider yourself egyptian as well as muslim?
Egyptian.
in 2 minutes, you know more about me than those thugs found out in 2 months.
they and I have very, very different motives and methodologies.
and yet your country relies on them to protect you from us.
sometimes they're their own worst enemy.
Yeah. Who is your worst enemy, agent gideon?
it's not a who.
it's a what.
ignorance.
you're a very honest man.
and you?
must have become a hafez by what, age 10?
9
any person with the discipline and dedication to memorize the entire qu'ran by age 9
must have a very serious reason to choose a life of violence.
perhaps.
we are through already?
no, not at all.
the sun is about to set.
mecca's in that direction.
I'll have a prayer rug and water bowl sent in.
what the heck is going on here?
the nsa is routing all messages to us for language analysis.
you know, rumor has it, much to my chagrin, that during national security emergencies, our fair country turns all of its satellites homeward and records all electronic traffic in the whole U. S.A
is this even legal?
Yeah, I don't really want to think about that right now.
somewhere in this slew of chatter could be a shred of something that could save a whole lot of lives.
all right, well, cross reference gift with wedding allusions.
they'll be consistent with their code.
here's something.
it rained all over the wedding, but the gift is waiting in the barn.
when was that call made?
looks like just over 2 hours ago.
let's run the words "barn and "wedding" through.
the wedding will now be held at vincent's barn off link and annandale.
route the gift for delivery.
that's not a gift I wanna get.
I'll call hotch.
Yeah, jj.
we think we just found the cell's backup location.
it looks like a construction site in annandale, virginia.
sounds like they may have another device ready to arm.
I'll get agent ryan to organize another raid. And notify gideon and reid.
OK.
can I offer you some water?
I offer you some first.
they only kept it there to show me what I could not have.
I'd like you to explain something to me.
how can you ignore the fact that muhammad preached passivitywhile he was in mecca?
do no violence.
his later message from medina was perfectly clear.
when violence come upon you, you must fight back with violence.
he's quoting from the hadith, not from the qu'ran.
it's called the verse of the sword.
they argue that it cancels out earlier teachings.
verse of the sword.
just someone's spin on the words of the prophet.
it's not even part of the qu'ran.
but it does say in the qu'ran fight and slay the infidels wherever you find them and seize them in every stratagem of war.
unless they repent.
establish regular prayers and practice regular charity.
is it your intention, mr. Gideon, to become a man of faith and revert to islam?
I am a man of faith.
I have repented, I pray regularly, and I practice charity.
I have never committed violence against you, so how is it that my faith would allow you to live and worship as you please, and yours would take my life and snuff it out?
you are simply misguided people of the book.
but if you revert to islam... - a billion muslims...
one billion muslims manage to practice their faith in peace...
for allah is surely merciful.
you...
inquired about my childhood earlier.
I will tell you...
that it was a happy one until one day a bomb fell out of the sky and leveled the bazaar that I was in with my family.
I was only 8.
must have been horrifying for such a young boy.
he's opening up about himself.
maybe.
we need to verify what he's saying, though.
speak.
Garcia, I need you to check something for me.
I'm looking for a stray bombing in a bazaar somewhere in egypt approximately 30 years ago.
OK, greaT. That's not too obscure.
I don't need you to give me details.
we're just trying to set a baseline for jind allah's truthfulness.
I just need to know if it happened at all.
when I know, you'll know. - Thank you.
when the rubble was cleared...
half...
of my family was dead.
it was on that day that I swore my life to vengeance for allah.
and for that very reason those holding you here can never let you leave.
your only hope is to tell me so I can hopefully one day share your struggle with the world.
your government won't even admit that I exist.
how possibly can you tell my side of the story?
Hey, guys, we want silence. No conversation.
let's be careful. We don't know what to expect.
ready? - Ready. Let's do it.
clear!
this place is completely empty. We missed them again.
you got gideon, prentiss, and me.
it's hotch. We're at cell location number 2.
no cell members, no lab, no dispersal devices.
we're still looking for escape tunnels.
call us.
we're running out of time. The attack's supposed to take place in less than 24 hours.
so getting jind allah to talk is our only chance of finding them.
time I confronted him with the truth.
what are you going to do?
show him my hand.
I'm going to give you the respect of telling you what just happened.
a team of agents raided an omega cell location.
actually, both of them.
our men are in place in annandale as we speak.
you gain nothing by remaining silent.
jihad is forever.
something's wrong.
his hands.
Gideon, something's wrong.
this guy seemed relieved by what you just told him.
excuse me.
what's the problem? - Get everybody out of there.
now! Now! Now!
everybody out.
it's a trap. Now!
I said out! Go!
how did a terror cell get its hands on anthrax without a single lab reporting a security breach?
would we know if a foreign lab had a breach?
a foreign lab? Actually, no.
Garcia, isn't annandale where morgan and hotch are?
that's not a gas main explosion.
please pick up.
please pick up. Please pick up.
Yeah, it's morgan.
Hello? Garcia, can you hear me?
we saw the explosion on tv.
Yeah, I know. We lost a swat agent.
Oh, god.
don't worry. Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do. Thanks, baby doll.
that's ok.
is he all right?
Yeah.
we lost a swat agent.
son of a bitch.
sorry about that.
Yeah, me, too.
the chatter was a set-up. They knew we'd be listening.
they led us straight here.
just tell me you know where to look next.
not yet.
they ok?
we were right about the trap.
it was rigged to explode.
a swat agent was killed.
was anthrax involved? - No.
then that's not the final target.
you look troubled, my friend.
you killed one of my men.
I was here with you.
the second location was a trap.
one of my agents was killed in the explosion.
this is war.
we expect casualties.
shouldn't you?
he was a good man.
well... if he would convert, there would be no reason for him to fear death.
what do you say to his family?
I say...
where... were you to mourn...
when my son was murdered?
his son?
did you see that?
when he told the story about his childhood, the bomb landing in the bazaar, his behavior changed.
we know he was lying.
Garcia couldn't find any record of a bombing during the time jind allah was a boy.
exactly, but this time when he mentioned his son, he looked at his hands, like he had to concentrate to control his anger.
that first story wasn't about him.
it was about his son.
which means it must have been more recent.
I need you to look for a bombing again in egypt, but this time anything in the last 10 years.
on it.
we're looking for civilian casualties, an 8-year-old boy.
OK. I'm cross referencing bombings and child victims.
7 years ago, in the heart of cairo, egyptian government blamed hezbollah, but conspiracy theories on the street claimed it was a joint U. S
Israli strike that went astray.
your gross detainee's name is jamal abaza.
how about his son's name? Do you have that?
amir abaza. 8. Killed in the blast.
all right. Find out everything you can on that. I'll get back to you soon.
we know his real identity.
it appears that there will be no peaceful resolution to our difficulties after all.
I haven't given up that hope.
it's time for your salut-ul-isha prayers.
may we speak again tomorrow?
you are asking me?
Yes.
tomorrow, then.
Jamal abaza's been in the U. S. For a while.
he volunteered as the prison imam at the dearfield correctional center 3 years ago.
how could the cia not know that?
they're focused overseas. We're domestic.
Yeah. They probably sent a request for a domestic information search, and it's somewhere making its way through channels.
if he was a prison imam, he must have recruited militant islamic society members.
M. I.S. Is an atypical prison organization.
they pick up an amalgam of ethnicities.
the qu'ran says that my lord...
those that slip through the cracks are the ones that traditional groups won't accept.
outside these walls, you need to understand...
it's made up largely of american citizens.
american citizens with a reason for hating the government.
we're looking at home grown terrorists.
what the hell do you want?
the name jamal abaza. Does it mean anything to you?
abaza was an imam in cairo.
he preached jihad to his followers, but he fell off the grid 7 years ago.
that's because when his son died, he took the jihad name jind allah.
he came to america to recruit sleeper cells.
you're telling us that that detainee in there is jamal abaza?
amazing what you learn when you talk to people.
he was also a prison imam in virginia 3 years ago.
are you familiar with the militant islamic society?
they're home grown?
we know the cell that abaza put together has access to anthrax, but we can't find any reports of any going missing in the states.
we have protocols that we have to follow.
you really going to allow a terrorist attack on U. S.
soil because of protocols?
I told you what I learned in there because you and I, fbi, cia, right now we have the ability to break through all the protocol and share information.
let me see what we have.
coordinate with agent jareau and penelope garcia at quantico.
please.
think it'll work?
I don't know.
CIA's tough. They play it pretty close to the vest.
well, if we don't all work together, more people are gonna die.
a lot more.
how goes it with the cia?
I don't know what gideon said to them, but they are feeding me information like crazy.
they sure do generate intelligence. - Yeah.
hopefully not too much to interpret.
slept well?
for the first time since I've been here.
good.
until yesterday,
I was not permitted regular prayer.
we receive comfort from our prayers.
we? - Human beings.
I say something wrong?
you placed us on the same level.
aren't we?
well, here I am thought of as less than human.
and in your jihad, I am.
what do you really want from me?
I already told you.
I want to understand you.
and if that is not possible?
then that would be my loss.
it's almost time for your midday prayers. May I return later?
I look forward to it. - Thank you.
most of these tips are so new they haven't even been authenticated yet.
Yeah, but there's nothing in the established information that's remotely helpful.
wait a minute. Anthrax.
what? - Genimmune.
a dutch biotech firm reported that they may have had a security breach involving anthrax last week.
may have?
they're still doing a security and inventory sweep, but they may be missing up to 20 grams of lab grade anthrax.
20 grams.
could potentially kill a quarter billion people.
he seems much calmer than he was yesterday.
may make any reading of his body language less accurate.
I know.
is that what we want?
I hope so.
well, isn't that the exact opposite of
he hopes so?
we have less than 10 hours before the new crescent moon rises.
aren't you worried?
I've been with him long enough to trust him.
CIA is funneling you their dutch terror watch list.
OK, I can cross reference that with any port of entry information we have as well as customs and immigration enforcement.
you know, it would sure be a lot easier if there was a centralization of all this information.
Oh, dream on, J.
no one wants the other kids peeing in their sand box.
tariq muhammad. Dutch citizen, islamic convert.
traveled here 4 days ago under his original name.
and we have the address he listed on his customs form.
thank you.
we just got a lead. - Got a name?
and an address.
how does a terrorist cell exist right here in mayberry?
infrared scanning still shows no one inside.
we're doing a soft entry in case it's booby trapped.
sir, get in here!
we have 5 deceased males and what looks to be a crude lab, all shot in the head execution style.
any anthrax on the scene?
only residue.
there's also packing and tags from 4 new backpacks.
all right, listen up.
backpacks? - They're already on the move. We're too late.
have you finished?
as you said, the sun is set.
Yes.
I'd like you to meet a colleague of mine. Dr. Reid.
may we speak? - Of course.
I have a little time.
that was a joke.
I have all the time. Please.
a joke.
well, we're making progress.
Yes, progress. That is true.
is there no way for this thing to end? This jihad?
the jihad will end when allah wills its end.
then how will you know that it is allah's will?
when the jihad ends.
I have been lying to you.
of course you have.
my colleague has been outside watching us as we talked on monitors.
watching your body language, trying to figure you out.
were you successful?
somewhat.
your name is jamal abaza.
your son amir was killed in 2003 in the bombing at the mahfouz bazaar in cairo.
since then, you've been recruiting M. I.S Members in prison by convincing them that U. S. Economic policies are exploiting third word nations and turned them into extreme fundamentalists by promising a better existence with allah.
I would say that you were more than somewhat successful.
but I did not learn where your M. I.S. Cell was going to make an anthrax attack in the U. S.
at the new crescent tonight.
I have no knowledge of such a thing.
Yes, you do, mr. Abaza.
and there is still time.
what?
are you sure?
something has happened?
how could you?
you choose to contort islam into an excuse for a life of violence.
you have perverted your faith to justify murder.
now we are finally chatting, gideon.
you accuse americans of being puppeteers of the third world, yet you used your own people's faith tonight to make them dance for you.
Why?
why is it always those who profess to be the most fervent believers in this war, they always manipulate other people to die for them.
does your president go to battle?
or does he send your children?
tonight...
all those innocent people.
there is no such thing, gideon. They were infidels.
and they were engaged in activities that spread american policies over the entire world.
your incessant need to own things, material things.
your capitalism rests on the back of third world countries.
no one's hands are clean.
no one is innocent.
those people tonight, they were innocent.
they never hurt you.
they hurt me by existing.
Yes, the infidels shall fall at the hands of the righteous.
and that is when the jihad will end.
so you are ready to murder 4 billion people.
america has learned nothing from the past.
you harden targets like your power plants, but you leave the soft root for our taking.
what has happened tonight will affect your economy for years, the way september 11th affected air travel.
and maybe the next time a giant shopping center opens, people will think twice before going.
and maybe next it will be a school. Hey!
you can shut the video feed down now, garcia.
has the sun not set yet?
no.
no...
a shopping center. A mall.
it's a grand opening tonight not long after sunset.
that gives you about an hour.
God help us if they don't make iT.
let's just hope we have somewhere to go.
grand opening of the usa mall today.
it's the third largest in the country, and it's right smack in the middle of mclean, virginia.
let's move.
what's going on with you?
you look like you've seen a ghost back there.
Haley's supposed to take jack to the new mall to have his portrait taken.
well, go ahead and call her.
it's a breach of security.
you lose haley and jack, screw this job.
you won't have a life.
I can't reach her.
Morgan, I'm going to find the security office.
looks like loading dock security.
should we evacuate? - No, no.
we'd have mass panic. Let's go.
Hello!
are these all your security cameras?
Yes, sir.
what's this camera here?
that's the roof. East end.
Morgan, I've got 4 guys on the east end of the roof.
what's on that side of the roof?
nothing.
no access doors to the mall?
not unless you go through the air vents.
Morgan, it's the air vents.
they're going for the air vents.
don't move!
put the devices down and put your hands where I can see them!
gun!
police tonight foiled an apparent robbery attempt at the new usa mall, which presumably have marred an otherwise successful grand opening.
Hey, in here.
you're home.
did you see that there was an attempted robbery at the new mall?
I'm glad I cancelled jack's photos.
I just decided I wanted you to be there.
it's better if we do it as a family.
is everything ok?
Yeah, everything's perfect.
Ralph waldo emerson once said in order to learn the most important lessons of life, one must each day surmount a fear.
when did you know you were gonna have to trick him?
the first time I talked to him.
you realized you couldn't break him?
well, I realized he was too smart to have had that nextel phone registered to him accidentally.
he drew us there.
he wanted our presence at gtmo to confirm that he was successful.
and that's when you started moving up the time of his prayers.
if I'd used an actual clock, he might have caught on.
so it was all a chess game.
we won this round...
but you heard him.
jihad never ends.
mate.
I quit.
yield. Surrender.
capitulate. I'm gonna take a nap.
sir?
you play?
Yes, sir. I play.
nothing's happening - Watch
ah
I'm so sorry, Emily
what was that
don't you recognize a rocket when you see one
I--I was merely demonstrating a physics law
I--I--I didn't meant to hit-- oh, show me
all right
uh... well, turn around, please
turn around
Yeah, he's not gonna show you... how it's done
all right, all right, turn back and observe
all: Oh
physics magic
Yes, sir
Reid, we talked about this
I'm sorry, sir
really starting to get some distance on those [Camera clicks] You're sure she's got enough butter

Well...you're careful, right 'Cause you owe me some grand babies
Oh, come on, mom [Knocking on door] Oh, look at that, saved by the bell
phew
a bunch of them

this is some kind of sick joke, right
don't make us get physical
it'll only make it worse for your family how secrets deep how secrets become dark that's in the nature of secrets " Writer, Cory Doctorow
you know, you better have a real good reason for doing that in front of my family
you gonna tell me the charges now
Oh, I bet if you think real hard you'll be able to figure it out, Derek
uncuff him
agent Morgan
you'll always just be Derek to me
and you'll always be a racist son of a bitch to me
right, Derek
that's all it is
then what, man [Chuckles] Man, I should have done this a long time ago
what the hell are you talking about
sit down [Chuckles] Oh, wow
there isn't gonna be a hole deep enough to bury your career
what's wrong with you, man
you know I'm an FBI agent
well, then you should be fairly aware of your rights
do you want a lawyer
I'm not some punk kid you can scare anymore, Gordinski
tough guy... you want a lawyer Yes or no
I want a phone call
local
I need to call my supervisor at FBI headquarters in Quantico
agent Hotchner
he's already getting a call
there has to be a mistake
yes
of course
we're on our way [Sighs] This is SSA Hotchner,
I need an emergency recall of agents Reid, Prentiss, Jareau and Penelope Garcia as well
Yeah--uh, yes, I'll call him myself, thank you
Jason, it's Hotch, we've got to get to Chicago, Morgan's been arrested
homicide
righ I can wait as long as you guys can
did you get some sleep
you know I didn'T
slept like a baby, myself
didn't even wanna get out of bed
really
so that wasn't your donut-eatin' ass on the other side of that glass all night, then, huh
here you go
you want the other ones
no, just this one right now [Laughs] Come on, man
you gotta be kidding me, right
pretend you went home and slept, put an empty box with my name on it on a table right in front of me
the FBI invented this stuff, you simple bastard
we teach it
what's this
it's yesterday
you're following me
whose grave is that
why would you be following me
whose grave
you know I don't know his name
you paid to bury him, didn't you
the neighborhood did
but you led the collection
so
and you visit him a lot
every time I come home
is there something wrong with that [Chuckles] What, you got a crush on me all of a sudden, Gordinski
OK, that's me at the youth center tossing a ball around with a couple of kids
you did a little more than that
this is about you giving one of them a ride home, one of the boys
yeah
Yeah, I did
this kid named, um, Damien
his place was on the way to my mother'S
so what, man
Damien Walters, D O A
Oh, no
somebody killed him
not somebody, Derek
you think I did this
special agent Hotchner, FBI
I'm looking for detective... Gordinski
I got this, Chuck
how you guys doing
Wally Dennison, CPD
Where's agent Morgan
detective Gordinski's in with the suspect now
I need to see him
when my partner's finished talking to him
I have your superintendent's personal cell number, and in the interest of not running roughshod over another police agency
I've resisted calling him so far
I need to see agent Morgan now
I'll get Gordinski
he's the, uh, primary
I don't like them calling him a suspect
me neither
you're the last person anyone saw with my victim
you recognize him
found in an alley four years ago
still unidentified
John doe
just like that kid whose grave you visit every time you come to Chicago
another boy
just after you left the city
this is crazy
no kidding
look, man, Rodney Harris
he's been following me around ever since I got back to town
Rodney Harris the gangbanger
Yeah, he was waiting for me outside of a corner store
he did that drive-by yesterday
so you think this looks like something a gangbanger did
is that how you'd advise me, Mr Fbi [Clears throat] [Whispers indistinctly] All right, tell him I'll be there in a minute
you're gonna have to come up with something better than a gangbanger, Derek
detective Gordinski, CPB
you think an FBI agent, a BAU profiler committed a homicide
actually, three homicides at least, over 15 years
you--you think he's a serial killer
this is ridiculous
has he been charged with anything
I got 72 hours for that
I'd like to see him
be my guest
this way
agent Gideon, right
yes
I owe you a big thank you
I had no suspects at all until you looked over my case for me and sent me this profile
everything in it points to that son of a bitch, Derek Morgan [ ] I profiled him
it's all right there
detective, a profile's just a guide
Yeah, this one guided me to him
they're really more useful in the elimination of suspects rather than the inclusion
that's not the way you presented it to me
well, if I confused you, I'm sorry
I'm not confused at all
look, whatever it is in here that made you consider agent Morgan a suspect has to be coincidence
you can't rely solely on this
you're right, I'm not [Door opens] You ok
this kid
I was with him yesterday
so
so he's dead
I drove him home, Hotch, and Gordinski's saying I was the last person seen with him 15 years ago, I was a new detective
one of my first cases was a black kid 12 or 13 years old, found strangled in a vacant lot near here
boy was a john doe, right
still unidentified to this day
wait, a 12-year-old kid that no one reported missing
ever
four years ago, another body turns up, same M O
worked that case just as hard, came up with just as much nothing
nobody in the area had ever seen the kid before
no one's looking for these kids
then a few months back, I attended a seminar that you taught at CPD headquarters
I told you about my case, you said to send you the files and you'd look 'em over
this is the profile you worked up
there are about 3 million people in Chicago
your profile said I was looking for a black male, 25 to 35, with a knowledge of the area
nonthreatening to children-- either knows them or is normal enough that he doesn't scare them
a probable criminal record
it also said the way the body was placed gently on a mattress, not just tossed on the ground, indicated someone who was probably consumed with guilt, especially for the first victim
your exact words are
with a guilt-ridden offender,"the BAU postulates the first victim is the most important
and the unsub may still visit the place of the crime or even the victim himself " Care to guess who visits my first victim every time he's in town
can't be just visiting the victim
there has to be more than that
sure
you said the unsub might try to inject himself into the investigation to keep tabs on it
morgan has called our headquarters many times since he joined the bureau
always about this case
so, wait, he talked to you about it
headquarters
he'd never call me
after I got your profile, I checked airline records
turns out Derek had just left Chicago when the other body turned up
tell me the story from the beginning
I--I guess it starts when I was 15
I was coming home from football practice one day [Car horn blares] Me and my boy, we were goofing off, you know, we were throwing a football around [Telephone ringing] The only person that I'd ever seen dead before that was my father when I was ten
I mean, there I was, I was looking at this kid and he was my own age, Hotch
dead in this vacant lot
and he was never identified
nobody knew who he was, nobody ever even reported him missing
and that, that just didn't sit right with me
so I--I felt responsible for him, I mean, I was the one that found him, right
I went around the neighborhood, door to door, trying to start a collection, and... eventually I got enough so I could bury him, and... I gave him a little headstone
what did you put on the headstone if he wasn't identified
Morgan: Just the date
I left room for a name if he was ever identified
and you still visit him
Hotch, I go see this kid every time I'm home
I just feel like he deserves to have somebody look in on him
Gordinski must read that as a guilty conscience, a killer revisiting his victim
but that can't be the only reason he suspects you
believe me, that guy's had it in for me my entire life
he's supremely confident that you're his killer
then yesterday another kid ends up dead and the last person he was with was Derek Morgan
in the boy's pocket we found one of his FBI business cards, his cell number written on the back of it
this is all just coincidence
a hell of a lot of coincidences
it's purely circumstantial
so's a fingerprint
did I mention that Morgan found the body in 1991
hidden way back in a vacant lot
now, don't you teach that when a body is hard to find, the person finding it is always a suspect
reid: There are key pieces of the profile that don't fit, detective
uh, the age, 25 to 35, Morgan was 15 or so at the time
also says that age is the hardest to predict, and I should never exclude someone simply because of a discrepancy with the age
what about the speculation that since he didn't managed to leave any evidence at the scene of the crime and he most likely has a criminal record or previous law enforcement knowledge
Derek wasn't even in the bureau yet when the first body was found
he may not have had a knowledge of law enforcement but Derek Morgan definitely had a criminal record
a desperate detective here
three dead boys, no evidence at all, so he applies the profile directly to someone he already suspected
it's easy to get tunnel vision that way
one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts
that's, uh, one of Sherlock Holmes's favorite quotes
we need to figure out who really killed these boys before they decide to charge Morgan
what do you want us to do
last victim was someone Morgan was seen with
conveniently, Morgan was already a suspect in the other two
someone set him up
we should consider Morgan a victim
Prentiss, you and Reid talk to his family, learn about him
especially around the time of the first murder
do we have the address
I can take you
Oh, that's ok
Gideon: No Actually, that's not a bad idea
right
Okey-doke, lead the way, detective
according to Morgan, he's got a bad history with Gordinski
resisting arrest, vandalism, aggravated battery
this is Morgan
as a juvenile Look at the dates
this isn't in his personnel file
he said he told me everything relevant
then he either lied or he doesn't consider this relevant
since when is the criminal history of a suspect not relevant
you just called him a suspect
get Garcia into Morgan's life
Yes, sir
Hey, Hotch, I almost forgot
there's a local banger out here, his name is Rodney Harris
he's been running these streets for a while now
you have a criminal record
what
where did you get this
what difference does that make
Hotch... this was supposed to be expunged
my record's clean
I asked you if there was anything you hadn't told me
a judge expunged this, it doesn't exist anymore, man
I was a kid, it's nothing
aggravated battery
I-- [Sighs] Ok
I was with some guys, we got in a fight with some other guys
Rodney, this cat I'm trying to tell you about, it was him
we got into it a little bit, we knocked each other around, he got a couple stitches in his head so they made it aggravated
that's it
so you're saying this Rodney committed three murders because you beat him up
no
I'm saying he's been following me around since I got here, so go talk to him and you might get something
this was expunged
you still should've told me
you know how important accurate information is to victimology
whoa
whoa
victimology
it's very likely the latest victim was an attempt to set you up
are you profiling me
Morgan, we need to look at-- no
we don't need to do anything
Derek, you're in trouble here [Laughs] Hotch, I didn't do this
I am not worried about Gordinski out there
you still have three dead children
OK, ok, so you profile them
that's the case
is there something else you don't want us to find out about
Hotch, I don't need the people I work with going into my entire world
is, uh, Derek all right
he wouldn't let us go down there
he's fine
our boss is with him
did he tell you Gordinski's been harassing him since he was a kid
reid: Why's that
you'd have to ask that bastard
Oh, Sarah
it's true, mom
sure it is
what are you even doing in my mother's house
they asked me
Oh, really
I don't understand how they could think he did this
someone may be trying to make it look like he hurt those kids
and the police believe it
just following the evidence
but he's an FBI agent
reid: Actually... law enforcement officials are just as probable statistically to commit a crime as anyone else
look at the cross-section of a society, there's a general population and a small fraction-- he's not actually saying we believe Derek's involved in this
Oh, no, no, yeah, not at all
I'm merely, um-- speaking theoretically
you're dr Reid, right
Mm-hm
Derek talks about you
he does
anyway, so... someone may be trying to make it look like this was Derek
but Derek loves kids
every time he's here, he goes to the youth center
youth center
the upward youth center
does that have some sort of significance for him
Oh... are you saying there's something in it for him
Sarah... Sarah, we're friends of your brother's
we're here trying to help
when we ask a question, it isn't to denigrate or demean anything he's done
we just have to know everything, so we can figure out where to look next
is there some special significance to the youth center
the youth center saved his life
does this make any sense to you
no
he's clearly hiding something else
well, we know he isn't involved in any murders
no
there are larger implications
we can't have people on this team who have secrets
Oh, come on, Hotch, we all have secrets
would you want us profiling you
I feel terrible looking into his life like this
I know, just remember we're trying to help him
Garcia: Right, ok
graduated with honors from northwestern law
did you know he was a star football player
surprisingly, I don't know much about him at all
quarterback
that's the guy who throws the ball, right
yes
ha That's what he was
full ride athletic scholarship
sophomore year he severely injured his left knee and he never played again
OK, Garcia, look further back, ok
before college
Garcia: Right Where are we
OK, um... wait
he was mentioned in the Chicago register as...
body of a ch-child in a vacant lot in 1991
[Sighs] That's our first victim
Garcia: He never told me about this
he never told any of us
my husband, um, their father, was killed when he tried to stop a robbery
Derek was with him, he was ten
a year or so later, he started getting into trouble
what kind of trouble
he started running around with older kids
they would give him money to run errands for them
not drugs
no, Derek would never disgrace his father's name
but they were gangbangers
so people started looking at Derek like he was one of them
one night, he and a friend were attacked by some boys from another gang
big fight
and one of the other boy's head split open
and that was the first time Gordinski arrested him
now, he wasn't a detective yet, just a street cop, but from that night on, no matter what happened in the neighborhood, he'd pick Derek up for it
Dennison: Probably because he was involved
the hell he was
Stan's never arrested anyone who didn't need arresting
he did with Derek
until Carl Buford stepped in
he runs a youth center
he took Derek under his wing
mentored him
became like a surrogate father
he taught him football and that changed Derek's life
he got a scholarship to college, with it he got his degree
where is Carl Buford now
he still runs the youth center
I'd like to talk to him
detective, do you think you could take me over there
just you
yeah
I thought maybe you could stay here and keep going through this stuff
good idea
Yeah, keep going through the stuff
is there a criminal history
Garcia: Criminal
Garcia, is there a criminal history
unseal it
but it's a sealed file
Garcia, helping him
ah
right
helping him, helping him... that's a juvenile criminal record
it was expunged and sealed by a judge Esposito after presentation of a letter and testimonial from a local youth center director "Finest young man I've ever known, "criminal record could jeopardize "potential scholarship offers...
stake my personal and professional reputation...
Garcia: He was definitely a fan of our boy
do we have a name
hang on a second
I'm Carl Buford
I've brought Damien Walters' mother to see detective Gordinski
Hi, Carl
Mrs Walters, thanks for coming
this way
did you just say Buford would you just give me the hell out here
that wouldn't be a good idea, would it
says who
apparently I provided the profile that led them to arrest you
you what
they sent the case to me a few months ago
I did a routine consult but he was looking for it to lead to you
preconception of guilt
we just can't force 'em to let you go, it's not gonna look too good with the local press
Oh, like I give a damn about the press, Gideon
well, we cannot appear to be covering something up
you trying to say something to me right now
only if you're hiding something You need to trust us
trust us enough to tell us about it
it's not about trust
it's about having a little privacy
I got the right to keep something to myself
look at us, man, we practically live together already
then the best way to clear you is...find the real unsub
find anything out about Morgan
the record wasn't picked up in his background check because everything in it was expunged and the file sealed by a judge
forgiving judge
it was based on the recommendation of an upstanding member of the community who took personal responsibility for Morgan
that sounds like somebody we should talk to for more background
should be easy, he's right over there
hello
mr Buford
this guy's been honored by everybody but the Nobel society
that's Carl Buford
who are you
I'm with the FBI
do you know Derek Morgan
Yeah, he's a friend of mine
I've been trying to call him
he's a little busy right now
is there something I can do to help you
I just... a friend of mine
someone killed him yesterday
do you know something about who might have done it
no
Derek's always telling me if I need somebody to talk to, about anything, I can call him
guess I just wanted to... I don't know
I'll tell you what
why don't you give me your name and I'll let him know that you've been trying to reach him
does he know where to find you
he can find me here
anytime
all the time
you folks work with Derek Morgan
Yes, sir, closely
you knew him well as a teenager
one of the finest boys I ever coached
football
I run a youth center
I gather you were instrumental in helping to get his criminal records expunged
I feel terrible about that now
you do
well, in view of what's happened
what's happened is a mistake
I'm confused, I thought Stan said there was all kinds of evidence
there is
Thanks, Carl, you can take miss Walters home now
appreciate you bringing her in
of course, of course
it's still hard for me to believe
for them, too
I can understand that
Derek had a way of charming people into looking past his deficiencies
excuse me, deficiencies
well, you've seen the records
Derek was at the youth center yesterday, wasn't he
playing football with Damien Walters and some other boys
Carl's the one that saw 'em leaving together
did you talk to him
I was working inside
by the time I was done, they were leaving
when was the last time you did talk to him
I don't know
years
if you need anything else, Stan
anything at all
Thanks, Carl
appreciate it
you seem friendly with Mr. Buford
I can't tell you how many times that guy's come through for me
goin' way back to my beat cop days
Carl Buford knows the kids in this neighborhood better than almost anybody
he's knocked more than a few of them back onto the straight and narrow
has he kept up with the investigation
I'm sorry
over the years, does he ask how it's going
Yeah, he'S... wait a second, you're not gonna try to turn this off on him to save your guy, are you
just a question
Carl Buford is a local hero
I'm sure he is
what
Carl Buford, he runs the youth center
what's that got to do with anything
he's responsible for getting your records expunged
I told you to stay the hell out of my business
you said you visit the youth center every time you come here
so what
Buford says he hasn't spoken to you in years
why don't you visit the man who made your career possible
damn you, Hotch
it is none of your damn business
Buford's the one who told detectives you were with Damien
I am warning you, Hotch
back off
I'm not saying it's mr Buford
there's a huge amount of investigation left to be done
for 15 years he hasn't been the slightest bit suspicious
morgan won't even talk about Buford
he won't
Buford should be that kid's hero
something happened
you talking about Carl Buford
yes
we just left his office
Dennison: Hey
what, did we turn him loose
you let him escape black male, 33, six foot one, name is Derek Morgan
you're standing there trying to convince me that a local hero is my killer while you let my suspect dance our the back door
I'm gonna charge all of your asses
Yes, as soon as possible
you have to tell your officers that Morgan's not a threat
like hell I will
but this-- lady, as far as I'm concerned, he is a threat, ok
they're beyond reason
we have to find hm first
any ideas
his mother said that Buford practically raised him after his father died, he mentored him, took him on trips, spent all of his time with him
basically became a surrogate father
Jason, I think I know what he was afraid we'd find
detective, we may know where he's heading
lookin' good there, kid
I was tryin' to call you
I'm here now
someone killed Damien
I know
James, we need to talk about Carl Buford
what about him
you're a star player, right
center of attention
Yeah, I guess
you know, I used to be that guy
Yeah, I know
it's a lot of pressure, isn't it
always wanna make 'em happy
impress 'em
I can handle it
Oh, I'm sure you can, kid
does he ever take you to his cabin
what
fishin' in Wisconsin, camping
do things you wish you had a real father for
sometimes
Yeah, he's good like that
you know about the cabin
James, I told you, I used to be you
what do you mean
the first time you weren't even sure what was goin' on
he brushed up against you
you thought it might have just been an accident
but then at the cabin, he let you sit and drink with him
you thought it was kinda cool
made you feel grown
he gave you a glass of wine
maybe a little shot of something harder
and then he took you swimming
only he told you to jump in without your swimsuit on
he did things to you, James, didn't he
he did 'em to me, too
you do whatever you think you gotta do to keep him happy because he's the closest thing to a father you got
but what he's doin' to you is wrong
and you don't have to let it continue, man - Yeah, I do
my oldest brother's in jail, my sister was paralyzed in a drive-by, she's eight years old
I'm all my mom's got left
I gotta get us outta here
Carl's gonna make sure I get into college
then I can make something of myself
James, you are something, man
you're something right here, right now, without Carl Buford
you just gotta believe that
Where's Carl right now, huh
look at you, man
you're out here in the dark running pass routes
that's you
that ain't got nothin' to do with Carl
what you got inside of here, that's what's gonna get you off these streets
you never told
not until right now
Damien always said I should call you
what
Damien knew
I didn't think you'd believe me
James... I got your back
forever
you've been let go
looks that way
I told 'em it was crazy, thinkin' you were involved in any killing
really
Gordinski said you're the one who told 'em I drove Damien home
was that supposed to be a secret
no
that wasn'T
I don't follow
all these years, I kept my mouth shut
I let you go on being a hero
Carl Buford, my mentor
what are you talkin' about
God, I was so afraid of you
I was afraid of the police, afraid of losing everything I was gaining
but that's how you work, isn't it
you make sure there's a hell of a lot to lose, don't you
I don't know what you think you remember
no, no, no See, it's not what I remember that's gonna hurt you, Carl
our business is over way too long ago to matter
you're protected by a statute of limitations and that's my fault
then good night
you set me up
you knew Damien Walters wanted James to call me about you
so you killed him
you killed him because you knew I'd come after you, didn't you
now you're just talking crazy
God, I should have told somebody about you when I was a kid
when you were helping me
well, you know what happens in cases like this
once that dam breaks, the flood comes
one kid steps up, just one
and then another one, and another
because they're not scared of you anymore
they know they're not alone
James Barfield is your dam
whatever lies James told you... they're not lies
you did the same thing to me
I did nothing to you, to James
one by one, they're gonna pile up until there's so many accusations - You can't say that they're all lies any idea how many kids I've helped get out of this neighborhood
hm
how many lives I've provided
look at yo 
Yeah, well, it wasn't for free, was it
I pulled you out of the gutter
I pulled myself out of the gutter, all the way to the FBI
I did that
you sayin' I had nothin' to do with making you who you are
no, Carl
actually I'm saying you have everything to do with making me who I am
because of you I'm somebody who gets to spend the rest of this life making sure guys like you go down
look, Derek... Carl: I never hurt you
you could have said no
you're under arrest, Carl
I've helped a lot of kids
let's go
the neighborhood won't be the same without me
it's gonna be worse without the center
somebody'll keep this center running
the neighborhood will
I will
wait Wait
Derek... isn't there something you can do for me
you go to hell
can you see in the dark
can you look at a king
would you sit on his throne
can you say of your bite that it's worse than your bark
are you cock of the walk when you're walking alone

Jellicles do and Jellicles would
Jellicles would and Jellicles can

are you keen to be seen when you're smelling a rat

there's a man over there
with a look of surprise
as much as to say well, now, how about that
do l actually see with my own very eyes a man who's not heard of a Jellicle cat
what's a Jellicle cat
what's a Jellicle cat
what's a Jellicle cat
the naming of cats is a difficult matter lt isn't just one of your holiday games
you may think at first l'm as mad as a hatter
when l tell you a cat must have three different names
first of all, there's the name that the family use daily
such as Peter, Augustus
Alonzo or James
such as Victor or Jonathan
george or Bill Bailey
all of them sensible everyday names
there are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter
some for the gentlemen some for the dames
such as Plato, Admetus
but all of them sensible everyday names
but l tell you a cat needs a name that's particular
a name that's peculiar, and more dignified
else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular
or spread out his whiskers or cherish his pride
of names of this kind l can give you a quorum
such as Munkustrap, Quazo or Coricopat
such as Bombalurina or else Jellylorum
names that never belong to more than one cat
but above and beyond there's still one name left over
and that is the name that you never will guess
the name that no human research can discover
but the cat himself knows and will never confess
when you notice a cat in profound meditation
the reason l tell you is always the same
his mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
of the thought...
of his name
his ineffable ineffable
deep and inscrutable
singular
name, name
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicle cats come one come all
the Jellicle moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
Jellicle cats meet once a year
at the Jellicle ball where we all rejoice
and the Jellicle leader will soon appear
and make what is known as the Jellicle choice
when old Deuteronomy just before dawn
through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
announces the cat who can now be reborn
and come back to a different Jellicle life
for waiting up there is the heaviside layer
full of wonders one Jellicle only will see
and Jellicles ask because Jellicles dare
who will it be
who will it be l have a Gumbie cat in mind
her name is Jennyanydots
her coat is of the tabby kind
with tiger stripes and leopard spots
all day she sits beneath the stairs
or on the steps, or on the mat
she sits and sits and sits and sits
and that's what makes a Gumbie cat
that's what makes a Gumbie cat
but when the day's hustle and bustle is done
then the Gumbie cat's work is but hardly begun
and when all the family's in bed asleep
she tucks up her skirt to the basement to creep
she is deeply concerned with the ways of mice their behaviour's not good and their manner's not nice
so when she has got them lined up on the matting
she teaches them Music, crocheting and tatting l have a Gumbie cat in mind
her name is Jennyanydots
the curtain cord she like to wind
and tie it into sailor knots
she sits upon the windowsill
or anything that's smooth and flat
she sits and sits and sits and sits
and that's what makes a Gumbie cat
that's what's makes a Gumbie cat
but...
when the day's hustle and bustle is done
then the Gumbie cat's work is but hardly begun
she thinks that the cockroaches just need employment
to prevent them from idle and wanton destroyment
so she's formed from that lot of disorderly louts a troop of well disciplined helpful boy scouts
with a purpose in life and a good deed to do
and she's even created...
a beetles tattoo
for she's a jolly good fellow
thank you, my dears
the Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat lf you offer me pheasant l would rather have grouse lf you put me in a house l would much prefer a flat lf you put me in a flat then l'd rather have a house lf you set me on a mouse then l only want a rat lf you set me a rat then l'd rather chase a mouse
the Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
and there isn't any call for me to shout it
for he will do as he do do
and there's no doing anything about-a-wow-wowt-it
the Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore
when you let me in then l want to go out l'm always on the wrong side of every door
and as soon as l get home, then l'd like to get about l like to lie in a bureau drawer
but l make such a fuss if l can't get out
the Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
and there isn't any use for you to doubt it
for he will do as he do do
and there's no doing anything about-a-wow-wowt-it
the Rum Tum Tugger is a curious beast
my disobliging ways are a matter of habit
now if you offer me fish then l always want a feast
and if there isn't any fish then l won't eat a rabbit lf you offer me cream then l sniff and sneer
for l only like what l find for myself
no
so you'll catch me in it right up to my ears
and you put it away on the larder shelf
the Rum Tum Tugger is artful and knowing
the Rum Tum Tugger doesn't care for a cuddle
so l'll leap on your lap in the middle of your sewing
for there's nothing l enjoy like a horrible muddle
the Rum Tum Tugger doesn't care for a cuddle
and there isn't any need for me to spout it
for he will do as he do do
remark the cat
who hesitates toward you ln the light of the door which opens on her
like a grin
you see the border of her coat is torn
and stained with sand
and you see the corner of her eye twist
like a crooked pin
she haunted many a low resort
near the grimy road of Tottenham court
she flitted about the no-man's land
from " The Rising Sun " to the " Friend At Hand "
and the postman sighed as he scratched his head
you'd really had thought she ought to be dead
and who could ever supposed that that...
was Grizabella the glamour cat
Grizabella, the glamour cat
Grizabella, the glamour cat
who'd have ever supposed that that...
was Grizabella the glamour cat
Bustopher Jones is not skin and bones ln fact, he's remarkably fat
he doesn't haunt pubs
he has eight or nine clubs
for he's the St James's street cat!
he's the cat we all greet
as he walks down the street in his coat of fastidious black
no commonplace mousers have such well cut trousers.
or such an impeccable back ln the whole of St James's the smartest of names is the name of this brummel of cats
and we're all of us proud
to be nodded or bowed to, by Bustopher Jones in white spats ln the whole of St James's the smartest of names ls the name of the brummel of cats
and we're all of us proud
to be nodded or bowed to, by Bustopher Jones in white spats
my visits are occasional to the senior educational and it is against the rules
for any one cat
to belong both to that
and the joint superior schools
for a similar reason
when game is in season l'm found not at fox's but blimp's l am frequently seen at the gay stage and screen
which is famous for winkels and shrimps ln the season of venison l give my benison to the pot hunter's succulent bones
and just before noon not a moment too soon
to drop in for a drink at The Drones
when l'm seen in a hurry there's probably curry at the Siamese or at the Glutton lf l look full of gloom then l've lunched at The Tomb
on cabbage, rice pudding and mutton ln the whole of St James's the smartest of names ls the name of this brummel of cats
and we're all of us proud
to be nodded or bowed to, by Bustopher Jones in white
Bustopher Jones in white. Bustopher Jones in white spats
so, much in this way passes Bustopher's day
at one club or another he's found lt can be no surprise
that under our eyes, he has grown unmistakably round
he's a twenty five pounder
or l am a bounder
and he's putting on weight every day
but l'm so well preserved
because l've observed. All my life a routine and l'd say l am still in my prime. l shall last out me time
that's the word from the stoutest of cats lt must and it shall be spring in Pall Mall
while Bustopher Jones wears white
Bustopher Jones wears white

Tootle pip
Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer
we were a notorious couple of cats
as knockabout clowns quick change comedians
tightrope walkers and acrobats
we have an extensive reputation
we make our home in Victoria Grove
this is merely our centre of operation
for we are incurably given to rove
when the family assembles for sunday dinner their minds made up that they won't get thinner
on Argentine joint, Potatoes and greens
and the cook would appear from behind the scenes
and say in a voice that is broken with sorrow l'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow
the joint has gone from the oven like that
then the family will say it's that horrible cat
was it Mungojerrie
or Rumpelteazer
and most of the time they leave it at that have a wonderful way of working together
and some of the time you would say it was luck
and some of the time you would say it was weather
we go through the house like a hurricane
and no sober person could take his oath
was it Mungojerrie
or Rumpelteazer
or could you have sworn that it might have been both
and when you hear a dining room smash
or up from the pantry there comes a loud crash
or down from the library came a loud ping
from a vase which was commonly said to be ming
then the family will say now, which was which cat lt was Mungojerrie
and Rumpelteazer
and there's nothing at all to be done about that
and there's nothing at all to be done about that l believe it is old Deuteronomy
well, of all things
can it be really?
Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye
my mind may be wondering but l confess.
l believe it is old Deuteronomy
old Deuteronomy's lived a long time
he's a cat who had lived many lives in succession
he was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
a long while before queen Victoria's accession
old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives and more l am tempted to say ninety-nine
and his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
and the village is proud of him in his decline
at the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
when he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall
the oldest inhabitant croaks
well, of all things
can it be really?
Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye!
my mind may be wondering but l confess l believe it is old Deuteronomy l believe it is old Deuteronomy l believe it is old Deuteronomy
my legs may be tottery l must go slow
and be careful of old Deuteronomy
Jellicle cats meet once a year
on the night we make the Jellicle choice
and now that the Jellicle leader is here
Jellicles cats can all rejoice
of the awful battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles together with some account of the participation of the pugs and the poms
and the intervention of the Great Rumpus cat
the pekes and the pollicles everyone knows are proud and implacable passionate foes lt is always the same, wherever one goes
and the pugs and the poms, although most people say that they do not like to fighting. Yet once in a way
they now and again Join into the fray
and they bark, bark, bark, bark, bark
until you can hear them all over the park
now on the occasion of which l shall speak
almost nothing had happened for nearly a week
and that's a long time for a pol or a peke
the big police dog was away from his beat l don't know the reason but most people think he slipped into the Wellington Arms for a drink
and no one at all was about on the street
when a peke and a pollicle happened to meet
they did not advance or exactly retreat
but they glared at each other and scraped their hind feet
and started to Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. bark, bark, bark
until you can hear them all over the park
until you can hear them all over the park
now the peke although people may say what they please ls no British dog but a heathen Chinese
and so all the pekes when they heard the uproar
some came to the window. Some came to the door
there were surely a dozen, more likely a score
and together they started to grumble and wheeze ln their huffery snuffery heathen chinese
but a terrible din is what pollicles like
for your pollicle dog is a dour Yorkshire tyke
there are dogs out of every nation
the lrish and Welsh and the Dane
the Russian, the Dutch, the Dalmatian
and even from China and Spain
the poodle, the pom, the Alsation
and Mastiff who walks on a chain
and to those that are frisky and frolic let my meaning be perfectly plain
that my name is little tom pollicle
and you'd better not do it again
and his braw Scottish cousins are snappers and biters
and every dog jack of them notable fighters
and so they stepped out with their pipers in order playing when the blue bonnets come over the border
then the pugs and the poms held no longer aloof
but some from the balcony, some from the roof
until you could hear them all over the park
huffery snuffery, huffery snuffery
until you could hear them all over the park
now!
when these bold heroes together assembled the traffic all stopped and the underground trembled
and some of the neighbors were so much afraid
that they started to ring up the fire brigade
when suddenly up from a small basement flat why who should stalk out but the Great Rumpus cat
his eyes were like fireballs fearfully blazing
he gave a great yawn
and his jaws were amazing
and when he looked out through the bars of the area
you never saw anything fiercer or hairier
and what with the glare of his eyes and the yawning
the pekes and the pollicles quickly took warning
he looked to the sky and he gave a great leap
and they every last one of them scattered like sheep
and when the police dog returned to his beat
there wasn't a single one left on the street
all hail and all power to the Great Rumpus cat
Jellicle cats and dogs all must
pollicles dogs and cats all must like undertakers come to dust
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicle cats come one come all
the Jellicle moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
Jellicle cats are black and white
Jellicle cats are rather small.
Jellicle cats are merry and bright
and pleasant to hear when we caterwaul
Jellicle cats have cheerful faces
Jellicle cats have bright black eyes
we like to practice our airs and graces
and wait for the Jellicle moon to rise
Jellicle cats develop slowly
Jellicle cats are not too big
Jellicle cats are roly poly
we know how to dance a gavotte and a jig
until the Jellicle moon appears
we make our toilette and take our repose
Jellicles wash behind their ears
Jellicles dry between their toes
Jellicle cats are white and black
Jellicle cats are of moderate size
Jellicles jump like a jumping jack
Jellicle cats have moonlight eyes
we're quite enough in the morning hours
we're quiet enough in the afternoon
reserving our terpsichorean powers
to dance by the light of the Jellicle moon
Jellicle cats are black and white
Jellicle cats as we said are small lf it happens to be a stormy night we will practice a caper or two in the hall lf it happens the sun is shining bright you could say we had nothing to do at all
we are resting and saving ourselves to the right
for the Jellicle moon and the Jellicle ball
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicle cats come one come all
the Jellicle moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball
you see the corner of her coat is torn and stained with sand
and you see the corner of her eye
twist like a crocked Pin
midnight
not a sound from the pavement
has the moon lost her memory
she is smiling alone ln the lamplight
the withered leaves collect at my feet
and the wind...
begins to moan
every street lamp seems to beat
a fatalistic warning
someone mutters and a street lamp gutters
and soon it will be morning
memory
all alone in the moonlight l can smile at the old days l was beautiful then l remember the time l knew what happiness was
let the memory live again
the moments of happiness
we had the experience but missed the meaning and approach to the meaning
restores the experience in our different form
beyond any meaning we can assign to happiness
the past experience revived in the meaning is not the experience of one life only
but of many generations
not forgetting something that is probably quite ineffable
moonlight! Turn your face to the moonlight
let your memory lead you
open up enter in lf you find there the meaning of what happiness is
then a new life will begin

Gus is the cat at the theatre door
his name is l ought to have told you before ls really Asparagus but that's such a fuss to pronounce
that we usually call him just Gus
his coat's very shabby. He's thin as a rake
and he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake
yet he was in his youth, quite the smartest of cats
but no longer a terror to mice or to rats
for he isn't the cat that he was in his prime
though his name was quiet famous, he says in his time
and when ever he joins his friends at their club
which takes place at the back of the neighboring pub
he loves to regale them if someone else pays
with anecdotes drawn from his palmist days
for he once was a star of the highest degree
he has acted with lrving he has acted with Tree
and he likes to relate his success on the halls
where the gallery once gave him seven cat calls
but his grandest creation as he loves to tell was firefrofiddle, the fiend of the fell l have played in my time every possible part
and l used to know seventy speeches by heart l'd extemporise back chat l knew how to gag
and l knew how to let the cat out of the bag l knew how to act with my back and my tail
with an hour of rehearsal l never could fail l'd a voice that would soften the hardest of hearts
whether l took the lead or in character parts l have sat by the bedside of poor little Nell
when the curfew was rung, then l swung on the bell ln the pantomime season l never fell flat
and l once under-studied Dick Whittington's cat
but the grandest creation as history will tell was firefrofiddle, the fiend of the fell
then if someone will give him a toothful of gin
he will tell how he once played a part in East Lynne
at a Shakespeare performance he once walked on pat
when some actor suggested the need for a cat and l say that these kittens
they do not get trained as we did in the days when Victoria reigned
they never get drilled in a regular troupe
and they think they are smart just to jump through a hoop
and he says as he scratches himself with his claws
well, the theatre is certainly not what it was
these modern productions are all very well
but there's nothing to equal from what l hear tell
that moment of mystery
when l made history as firefrofiddle the fiend of the fell
these modern productions are all very well
but there's nothing to equal from what l hear tell
that moment of mystery
when l made hist...
Skimbleshanks, the railway cat
the cat of the railway train
there's a whisper down the line at eleven thirty-nine when the night mail's ready to depart
saying, Skimble, where is Skimble?
has gone to hunt the thimble
we must find him or the train can't start
all the guards and all the porters and the stationmaster's daughters would be been searching high and low
saying, Skimble, where is Skimble
for unless he's very nimble, the night mail just can't go
at eleven forty two, with the signal overdue and the passengers all frantic to a man
that's when l would appear and l'd saunter to the rear l'd been busy in the luggage van
then he gave one flash of his glass green eyes and the signal went "all clear"
they'd be off at last
for the northern part of the northern hemisphere
Skimbleshanks, the railway cat
the cat of the railway train
you could say that by and large it was me who was in charge of the sleeping car express
from the driver and the guards to the bagmen playing cards l would supervise them all more or less
down the corridor he paces and examines all the faces of the travelers in the first and the third
he establishes control by a regular patrol
and he'd know at once if anything occurred
he would watch you without winking and he say what you were thinking and it's certain that he didn't approve of hilarity and riot so the folk were very quiet when Skimble was about and on the move
you could play no pranks with Skimbleshanks
he's a cat that can not be ignored
so nothing went wrong on the northern mail when Skimbleshanks was aboard lt was very pleasant when they'd found their little den with their name written up on the door
and the berth was very neat with a newly folded sheet
and not a speck of dust on the floor
there was every sort of light, you could make it dark or bright
and a button you could turn to make a breeze
and funny little basin you're supposed to wash your face in
and a crank to shut the window should you sneeze
then the guard walked in politely
and would ask you very brightly do you like your morning tea
weak or strong
but l was just behind him and was ready to remind him for Skimble won't let anything go wrong
when they crept into their cosy berths and pulled up the counterpanes
they all could reflect it was very nice
to know that they wouldn't be bothered by mice
they could leave all that to the railway cat
the cat of the railway train
Skimbleshanks the railway cat
the cat of the railway cat ln the watches of the night, l was always fresh and bright
every now and then l'd have a cup of tea
with perhaps a drop of scotch while l was keeping on the watch
only stopping here and there to catch a flea
they were fast asleep at Crewe
and so they never knew that l was walking up and down the station
they were sleeping all the while l was busy at Carlisle
where l met the stationmaster with elation
they might see me at Dumfries lf l summoned the police if there was anything they ought to know about
when they got to Gallow Gate there they did not have to wait
for Skimbleshanks would help them to get our.
and he gives you a wave of his long brown tail which says l'll see you again
you will meet without fail on the midnight mail
the cat of the railway train

Macavity's a mystery cat
he's called the hidden paw
for he's a master criminal who can defy the law
he's the bafflement of Scotland yard the flying squad's despair
for when they reach the scene of crime
Macavity's not there
there's no one like Macavity
he's broken every human law
he breaks law of gravity
his powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
and when you reach the scene of crime
Macavity's not there
you may seek him in the basement
you may look up in the air
but l tell you once and once again
Macavity's not there
Macavity's a ginger cat. he's very tall and thin
you would know him if you saw him
for his eye's are sunken in his brow is deeply lined with thought
his head is highly domed
his coat is dusty from neglect
his whiskers are uncombed
he sways his head form side to side with movements like a snake
and when you think he's half asleep he's always wide awake
there's no one like Macavity
for he's a fiend in feline shape
a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a by-street
you may see him in the square
but when a crime's discovered then
Macavity's not there
he's outwardly respectable l know he cheats at cards
and his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland yard's
and when the larder's looted or the jewel case is rifled
or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
there's the wonder of the thing
Macavity's not there
there's no one like Macavity
there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
he always has an alibi and one or two to spare
what ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
and they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known l might mention Mungojerrie l might mention Griddlebone
are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
just controls the operations the Napoleon of crime.
there's no one like Macavity
he's a fiend in feline shape
a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a bye-street
you may see him in the square

Macavity's not there

we have to find old Deuteronomy
you ought to ask magical Mister Mistoffelees
the original conjuring cat
there can be no doubt of that
please listen to me and don't Scoff
all his inventions are off his own bat
there no such cat in the metropolis
he holds all the patent monopolies
for performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions
the greatest magicians have something to learn from Mister Mistoffelee's conjuring turn
and we all say oh, well, l never was there ever a cat so clever as magical Mister Mistoffelees
he is quiet he is small he is black
form his ears to the tip of his tail and he can creep through the tinniest crack
and he can walk on the narrowest rail
he can pick any card from the pack
he's equally cunning with dice
he's always deceiving you lnto believing that he's only hunting for mice
he can play any trick with a cork
or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
and if you look for a knife or a fork and you think that it is merely misplaced
you've seen it one moment and then it is gone
but you find it next week laying out on the lawn
and we all say
Oh, well, l never was there ever a cat so clever as magical Mister Mistoffelees
presto
his manner is vague and aloof
and you would think there was nobody shyer
but his voice has been heard on the roof while he was curled up by the fire
and he's sometimes been heard by the fire while he was about on the roof
and well at least we all heard that somebody purred
which is incontestable proof and of his singular magical powers l've known the family to call him in from the garden for hours while he was asleep in the hall
and not long ago this phenomenal cat produced seven kittens right out of a hat
and not long ago this phenomenal cat produced seven kittens right out of a hat l give you the magical the marvelous
mister Mistoffelees
daylight
see the dew on a sunflower
and a rose that is fading
roses wither away
like the sunflower l yearn to turn my face to the dawn l am waiting...
for the day
now old Deuteronomy just before dawn
through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
announces the cat who can now be reborn
and come back to a different Jellicle life
memory
turn your face to the moonlight
let your memory lead you
open up enter in lf you find there
the meaning of what happiness is
then a new life will begin
memory
all alone in the moonlight l can smile at the old days l was beautiful then l remember
the time l knew what happiness was
let the memory live again
burnt out ends of Smokey days
the stale cold smell of morning
the street lamp dies
another night is over
another day is dawning
daylight l must wait for the sunrise l must think of a new life
and l mustn't give in
when the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
and a new day will begin
sunlight through the trees in summer
endless masquerading
like a flower as the dawn is braking
the memory is fading
touch me lt's so easy to leave me all alone with the memory of my days in the sun lf you touch me
you'll understand what happiness is
look! A new day has begun
up, up, up, past the Russell hotel
up, up, up, up to the heaviside layer
up, up, up, past the Jellicle moon
up, up, up, up to the heaviside layer
the mystical divinity of unashamed felinity
round the cathedral rang vivat
life to the everlasting cat
you've heard of several kinds of cat
and my opinion now is that you should need no interpreter to understand our character
you've learned enough to take to the view
that cats are very much like you
you've seen us both at work and games
and learn about our proper names our habits and our habitat
but how would you address a cat
so first, you'll memory l'll jog
and say a cat is not a dog
so first, your memory l'll jog
and say a cat is not a dog
with cats, some say one rule is true
don't speak till you are spoken to
myself l do not hold with that l say you should address a cat
but always keep in mind, that he resents familiarity
you bow! And taking off your hat! Address him in this form, O, cat!
before a cat will condescend to treat you as a trusted friend and you might now and then supply
some caviar or Strassburg pie
some potted grouse or salmon paste
he's sure to have his personal taste
so in time you reach your aim
and call him by his name
a cat's entitled to expect these evidences of respect
so this is this and that is that
and there's how you address a cat
a cat's entitled to expect these evidences of respect
so this is this and that is that
and there's how you address a cat
I miss you.
testing. Testing.
Hey, Brit. - Hey.
how you doing? - I'm okay.
don't worry, sweetie. It'll be okay.
your mom will always be with you.
seniors.
quiet down.
seniors!
this party atmosphere quite simply has to stop.
move.
God, bitch!
no wonder they held her back twice.
Maya, I heard Principal Mosster's making you work the school paper.
Yeah, that or juvie.
now, I'm joined today by Detective Morrison and Coroner Haynes.
they're here to enlighten you on the dangers of excess.
now, listen up.
detective.
I can promise you all one thing. - That this will be short?
that if you party too hard for the rest of this school year...
we're the people you're gonna meet.
I've seen it too many times to even count.
a kid gets a hold of some alcohol, maybe some drugs...
and you don't know when enough is enough.
call goes out...
and that's where the coroner, Dr. Haynes, comes in.
that's where I come in. And a few days later...
a badly decomposed corpse washes up on the beach.
it becomes my job to identify the body.
and do you know how I do that? - Dental records.
kiss ass. - Yeah.
it's a sad and sorry task, but yes, that's how it's done.
and if there's no dental records?
well, then we would have to carry out a DNA analysis of the corpse's bone marrow. - That's fucked up.
it's not that difficult of a process.
you take the bone marrow and grind it up in these little pieces...
and then you add in some dye elements and some chemicals...
and you put that all in an agarose gel.
get it up! - Then you take your gel and put that...
my apologies, detective.
it's so hard to keep their attention, especially today.
why, what's today? - The district volleyball final.
they love their volleyball here at Blue Bay.
can't think why.
blue Bay sucks!
here's a new angle on the Brittney Havers story.
forget that whole preppy, popular-girl bullshit.
let's go deeper.
let's expose how little Miss Trailer Park...
...became the richest bitch at Blue Bay High.
get it up! Get it up! Let's go!
come on! - Yeah! Good shot. Come on!
almost, Brittney. You suck!
all right, let's go! Get it on!
tie breaker. Close. Very close.
the suspense is killing me.
party at your house, Brit.
blue Bay! Blue Bay! Blue Bay!
Hey, Brit, what's up?
I'll be in a world of shit when my stepfather finds out about this.
Oh, my God. Have fun. Don't worry about it. It's a party.
look at those guys. They're college guys, frat guys.
I think they're Zeta Pis...
...or KOK. I'm not really sure.
come on, have fun. What's wrong with you?
look!
what are you doing?!
just giving her a little make over.
I want everybody out of my house, right now!
out!
not me.
what's her fucking problem?
that's her dead mother's portrait, you dumb-ass.
I'm sorry, Brit. They're just assholes.
I messed up bad this time.
why don't you marry a millionaire, just like your dear, dead mother?
what the hell are you doing here?
thought I'd write a story for the school rag.
gator white trash makes good.
what you think? - Don't you dare, you bitch.
so...
tell me what your poor, desperate, alcoholic mother...
ever saw in booty-chasing millionaire Niles Dunlap.
why don't you get the fuck out of here?
you may fool your cardboard-cutout friends...
but I still remember where you came from.
you can take the girl out of the trailer park...
but you can't take the trailer park out of the girl.
out of my fucking house before I call the police!
trouble in paradise?
I'm not gonna say it again!
out of my fucking house before I call the police!
I said, now!
you. You can stay.
great party, Mr. Dunlap.
this is not my fault. I didn't...
well...
that's trash.
like mother, like daughter.
green, baby. You know what that is? Cash!
cash! Everything around me! You have my cash? Do you?
you remember me, right? Bald head, tall, glasses.
Where's my money?
what did I tell you?
what did I tell you? You think you're a gambler?
that's enough.
look. Look at me.
Oh, my God! - I'll blow your fucking head off!
next time I'm here, your whole family...
Niles?
what happened?
nothing.
who was that guy?
it's none of your business, okay?
I'm leaving tomorrow, and you pull this party shit?
how am I supposed to trust you now?
I'm sorry, okay?
you can trust me, Dad.
stepdad.
you feeling okay? - Yeah, it's just...
what's up?
there was just this guy at the house last night.
what happened? - No, nothing like that.
what, then?
just forget about it.
tell me about the guy, Brit.
was it one of those cute frat guys? - No.
come on.
tell me.
there was a man threatening Niles with a gun.
Seriously?
Jesus.
when I asked Niles about it...
all he did was give me shit about the party.
I'm sorry.
what are you gonna do?
I don't want to talk about this right now. Let's go to practice.
Hey, Brit. Brit.
principal's looking for you.
call you back.
Brittney.
what is it?
maybe you'd better sit down.
last time you asked me to do that, my mother was dead.
there's been an accident.
no.
no, not again.
afternoon, detective.
insurance investigator. Great.
any word on what caused the crash, if you don't mind me asking?
you know what? I do mind.
we're on the same team. We're both looking for answers.
no, we're not. I'm looking to wrap this up and go home.
you're looking to find trouble. - I'm just trying to do my job.
Oh, yeah? What's your job? Scratch a wound till it bleeds?
what happened here is the guy took on gravity and he lost.
that simple enough for you?
nothing is ever as simple as it appears.
Hey, look around you, pal.
this is a police investigation. You don't belong here.
so pay that girl her check and go back to wherever you came from.
detective.
what do you got?
looks like swamp rats. - They probably went in after the body.
excuse me.
you ever hear of a rat running into a burning airplane?
I'm sorry to be bothering you.
I know this isn't an easy time for you. - Something wrong?
we...
we found rats in the fuselage of Niles' airplane.
they'd chewed through the wiring. - Are you serious?
like somebody put them there on purpose.
you know anybody who may have been angry...
or had a grudge against your stepfather?
Hey, Brit. What about that guy you told me about?
the one that threatened Niles.
wanna tell me something?
what did I tell you? You think you're a gambler?
that's enough.
look at me. I'm gonna fucking...
I'm gonna have to take that tape.
according to Mr. Dunlap's will, Miss Havers shall be furnished a stipend...
...until she graduates from a college of her choice.
after that, she'll be provided with a small trust.
how small are we talking? - $25, 000 a year for life.
$25, 000 a year?
what about controlling interest in the company?
his 51 percent will revert to the corporate trust...
of which the board will supervise, subject to the provisions of the will.
there must be some kind of mistake.
I'm afraid not, Miss Havers.
what were the provisions?
that the money would go to a blood heir, if Mr. Dunlap had one.
otherwise, the trust is to donate the money...
to Mr. Dunlap's favourite country club.
this is bullshit. What...?
these are your stepfather's last wishes.
is there any other money?
Mr. Dunlap took out a $2 million life-insurance policy last year.
but with no heir, I'm afraid that also reverts to the trust.
so $25, 000 a year. That's it?
a lot of people live very well on $25, 000 a year.
in the Glades, maybe.
we'll have the papers ready for you to sign in front of the judge tomorrow.
term National. - It's me.
well, how's life in Blue Bay with the rich and shameless?
same shit, different day.
listen, Lacey, I need you to do me a favour.
give me everything you can on Niles Dunlap. Hire a PI.
I want the good, the bad, the ugly.
where are you going with all this, T? - I smell a rat.
what up, boss?
thought you fulfilled your weekly hours.
got another angle on the Brittney Havers story.
this shit ain't gonna sell.
you need to think sensational.
that's what I'm talking about.
that's kind of disrespectful to Brittney.
what the hell do I care? Fuck her if she can't take a joke.
but with the will, I'm sure she doesn't need any more bad news.
what about the will?
I heard she lost out on everything except 25 grand a year.
all his money's going to the country club...
unless they can find a blood relative.
damn. That fucker must have been worth a boat load.
sixty-five mil, according to Forbes.
honey, you need to get out more.
perfect.
let's see what we got here.
I'm afraid there's not much we can do for the little fella.
I didn't think so, doctor.
what I need here is some information.
what kind of information?
where did this thing come from?
why was it found in the control panel of a downed airplane?
you really loved this rat, didn't you? - Indeed. This could be worth 2 million.
okay, I'll run some tests.
I really appreciate this. Thanks. - Sure, buddy.
Yeah, you rat.
crime figures are down for one reason only.
hard work and dedication of men and women of this department.
excuse me. I'm in the middle of this dog and pony show.
we got it. - What?
the guy from the security tape. Fax came from Miami P. D.
small-time hood runs backroom gambling joints for the Cuban Mafia.
I'll call you back.
there she is!
everything's fine, Brittney. Come on.
what's going on? - There's a wrinkle in Dunlap's will.
what do you mean?
the clause about a blood relative getting the money.
come on, make some room.
back off. She doesn't have a comment.
no, she is lying!
order! I will not tolerate another outburst in my courtroom.
I understand that this is hard for you, but you will respect this process.
now, Miss King, will you please continue.
like I said, Niles Dunlap was my father.
you lying little bitch!
order in the court! Order!
order! Order!
court's adjourned.
we'll try again tomorrow, with a little more decorum, perhaps.
bridge. - It's me.
you're working late. - You got Cragen's panties in a bunch.
he's scared you'll lose out on a big payout.
you tell him not to worry. Bridge will bring this home.
what you got on Dunlap?
okay. Married three times. Twice divorced.
Brittney's mother was the last wife. Committed suicide a year ago.
it was real nasty too.
took a long car ride off a very short jetty.
she'd found out about his reputation with the ladies.
what kind of reputation?
he's seen more pussy than an animal shelter.
I love it when you talk dirty.
had a world-famous wine collection in the cellar of his $10 million mansion.
I wouldn't expect anything less from a corporate tyrant.
that it? - I always have more for you, T.
he was also a big-time gambler.
seedy backrooms in Miami, as well as legit tables in Biloxi and Atlantic City.
wouldn't bat an eyelid at dropping a mil or two. He was compulsive.
he learned to fly so he could squeeze in a little more time at the tables.
even taught stepdaughter Brittney to fly so he could down a cocktail or two.
very interesting.
I overnighted Dunlap's medical records.
Thanks, Lacey. You're the best.
where high-school student Maya King came forward...
...claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of Niles Dunlap.
the room exploded in chaos when Brittney Havers attacked Miss King upon hearing the news.
bailiffs restrained Miss Havers before the judge ordered the court adjourned for the day.
plot thickens.
and these are? - Letters, Your Honour.
from Mr. Dunlap to my mother. - Love letters?
no, I wouldn't call them that.
tell me about them. When were they written?
after I was born. Summer of '84.
my mother worked in the Dunlap mansion.
one of her three jobs.
for the first month, he didn't even talk to her.
ignored her like she was a piece of trash.
but then one evening, that all changed.
suddenly he was all over her like a rash.
a few weeks later, she exploded the myth...
you can't get pregnant your first time.
the very same day he fired her, he cut her a check...
...gave her the name of a doctor he wanted her to see.
needless to say, she didn't know what he wanted her to do with the money.
how could he not see the crucifix around her neck?
this is an outrage! We're dragging a respected man through the mud based on the testimony of a less than reliable witness.
I will not tolerate any more interruptions!
miss King. - I'm sorry.
it's just...
it still hurts to think about.
mom put me in foster homes when she needed to save money.
I haven't spoken to her in a couple of years.
last I heard, she moved to Puerto Rico.
I went through her personal stuff after she skipped town...
and that's when I found those letters.
all from Niles.
all threatening her...
if she revealed that he was my father.
order!
order!
miss King.
you'll be required to submit to a DNA test...
which will be matched to the late Mr. Dunlap.
Really? - The results will be back in two days.
at which time this court will make a final ruling.
court dismissed.
there you go.
Thanks. - Let's go.
now, what do we have here?
Niles Dunlap, exhumation for DNA testing.
that's a killer.
cancer sticks. - Everybody dies, believe me.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. - Terence. Terence Bridge.
term National Life Insurance.
well, Mr. Dunlap must be an important client of yours, huh?
he was. I wrote the policy myself.
now I'm on the hook for 2 million.
it's gotta be a pain in the ass for you, this whole mess.
it's no big deal.
when you finish doing the DNA, could you give me a call? Let me know?
you'll be the first to know. - Great.
now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta open this up.
I appreciate your help.
see you when I see you.
Yeah.
you sure you don't want some company tonight?
no. I just need some time to think.
Bye.
you want to dance with me, baby?
you want to dance? - What do you want?
what I'm owed, mija. What I'm owed. - I don't owe you anything.
seven fucking million dollars. That debt don't die with him!
look at me.
three days, I'll be back, mija.
and you don't want to fuck with me, muchacha.
Cicatriz.
do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth?
I do.
Dr. Haynes, have you completed the DNA tests?
Yes, Your Honour. - Let me see them.
and are you satisfied with these results?
Yes, Your Honour. - Very well.
the transcription reads as follows:
the DNA taken from the person of Maya King...
and checked against that of Niles Dunlap...
is a genetic match.
it is the opinion of the coroner's office...
that Niles Dunlap is indeed the blood father of Maya King.
as per the will, Mr. Dunlap's 51 percent controlling interest in the Dunlap Corporation goes to Miss Maya King.
court adjourned.
miss Havers was led away in tears after the ruling.
miss King stands to inherit the shares of the Dunlap Corporation...
valued at approximately $ 70 million.
in a related story, a Cuban national was detained here on suspicion of murder in the crash of Niles Dunlap.
thank you, Linda. Mr. Cicatriz was taken into custody today at his home in Valley View. No word yet on what specific charges...
they got him.
Christ, Mr. Bridge, don't you ever sleep?
I did, once. It's overrated.
well, come in if you're coming in.
what did you find out about our rodent friend?
a few bits and pieces. I'll tell you one thing.
that was no ordinary swamp rat. - What do you mean?
wasn't quite sure myself, so I ran some tests.
I love rats. They're amazing.
they can survive a five-story fall, swim for six hours...
crawl through a hole size of a quarter. Scavengers.
but not this guy. He wasn't settling for scraps of garbage.
he had a taste for the finer things in life.
like what? - Like this.
cork fragment. I found it in its stomach with mould residue.
mould residue? - From an expensive bottle of wine.
I'd say at least 20 years old.
trendy rat.
Yeah.
I think it's time to celebrate.
Oh, shit.
why don't you just kill those fucking things?
that's a $2000 bottle of wine.
you know I'm good for it.
we did it. - We did it, didn't we?
I saw they arrested the Cuban guy...
and they're charging him with Niles' murder.
see? What did I tell you?
that cop just wants all his cases tied up in a pretty little bow.
nothing's over until it's over.
we haven't even sold the company shares yet.
nothing's foolproof, girls.
quit worrying.
this is the last time we'll be together before the money's in the bank.
let's make the most of it.
come here.
now kiss him.
beautiful, but deadly.
do I know you?
the name's Terence Bridge.
I'm handling your stepfather's insurance claim.
if you're talking about Niles' $2 million policy...
you're talking to the wrong person.
the melaleuca tree.
beautiful to look at...
but all it does is suck up the water around it until nothing is left.
everything dies around them.
Really? That's fascinating.
you know they found rats in your stepfather's plane.
detective Morrison told me.
now, if you'll excuse me.
rough night last night, huh?
few too many drinks?
must be tough to know when to stop...
...when you have the most extensive wine collection.
what's your point?
just learned a long time ago...
when something doesn't add up, you seek out the oddity.
good luck with that.
do you happen to have a rodent problem?
just you.
who the hell does she think she is? That's Brittney's spot.
Hey, you're parked in Brittney's spot.
haven't you heard? She's out.
I'm in.
so can I join your little Nazi fashion clique now?
you're trash.
you always have been, and you always will be.
dyke.
Maya.
what the fuck are you doing here? If somebody sees us...
come here.
what is it? - The insurance guy, Bridge...
was asking me about wine collections and rats.
and rats! - So?
he knows. He fucking knows! - Don't be so paranoid.
the insurance creep is on the hook for 2 mil.
he doesn't care about anything else.
lf he goes to the police? - He has nothing.
what if the Cuban guy gets out of prison? He'll come after me.
he'll come after me. - Don't sweat your pretty little head.
I'll take care of you.
we're in the clear. - Maybe.
I want to fuck you so bad.
is this a bad time, doctor?
Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack.
well, we're in the right place for that.
what's on your mind, Mr. Bridge?
Niles Dunlap's medical record.
the man was 50 years old and more physically fit than a man half his age.
Yeah.
a strong heart, low cholesterol.
in fact, aside from some bouts with chicken pox and scarlet fever as a child, his medical record is unblemished.
that's good for him.
doesn't help him now that he's toast, but good for him.
just out of curiosity, what are the long-term effects of scarlet fever?
that depends on the severity of the infection.
if it was real bad, it could cause a heart murmur...
or sometimes eye or ear damage.
or sterility.
sometimes.
now, what if, and this is just a "what if..."
Niles Dunlap was sterile?
well, that's impossible.
you see, Miss King proved that... - I know. I know, I know.
the DNA was a perfect match.
you ran the test yourself.
right.
but it would throw a real monkey wrench into the works, wouldn't it?
wouldn't it?
if he was sterile?
sorry, I don't wanna waste any more of your time.
if you think of anything you can tell me...
...just call me day or night. All right? - Great.
harvard man, I see.
Yeah. I...
I went to Morehouse.
but I'm just trying to figure out...
how a big-time education at Harvard can land someone like yourself...
at some small-town coroner's job.
just seems odd.
see you when I see you.
Yeah.
what are you doing here?
that insurance agent's crawling up my fucking ass.
get the fuck in the house. Let's go. Come on!
you fucking idiot, let's go. Get in the fucking house. Damn it.
if he could prove anything, he wouldn't be an insurance agent, would he?
he's just fucking with you, see if you'll crack.
crack?
I don't think I'll get through this. - Yes, you will.
just think about the 70 million.
and this.
so how did you do it, Maya?
how did you get the DNA to match?
what the fuck you doing here?
I was just looking for Maya King's place.
well, you're looking at it.
I know. I was...
look, man, I'm an insurance...
agent.
Hey, whoa, just take it easy, okay?
I'm just trying to give you my business card.
here.
want some light?
all right.
here.
what do you want with her?
well, you know, she stands to inherit a large sum of money.
from Bobby Santiago?
I very much fucking doubt that.
Bobby who?
her father.
probably. You never can tell.
hung around here when he wasn't doing time.
died on the business end of a pig sticker in Tallahassee a year back.
really sorry to hear that.
you wouldn't happen to know where he would be buried?
county dumped his box in the ground out at Sapienza Hill.
sapienza Hill.
Hello? - Fucking Julian.
Maya, what's wrong?
he's losing it. That insurance investigator's nosing around...
and Julian can't take the fucking heat.
he wouldn't do anything stupid, would he?
abso-fucking-lutely.
we gotta deal with him.
what do you mean, "deal with him"?
what do you think? We never planned on cutting him in.
let's think about this before we do anything.
don't think, Brit.
just sit there and look pretty, and we'll be together forever.
Papa King.
all right, Miss King, if we can get your signature here.
and...
here.
all right.
all right?
we're finished here.
that's it?
seventy million dollars.
seventy fucking million dollars!
Yes!
sixty-nine million, 427 thousand, to be exact.
now, you're sure you don't wanna transfer this to an account?
no, thank you.
a company check will do just fine.
Hello? - It's done.
seventy million big ones. I got the check in my hand.
all right. All right, calm down. We still got shit to do.
we meet Julian at midnight. You know where.
I've been thinking about this...
no. No, you're not. We stick to the plan.
damn it.
so you have something to hide after all, huh?
Maya?
Maya?
look, don't fuck around with me right now, please.
Maya?
shit! What the fuck is wrong with you?
glad you could make it, Brit.
let's go.
you're such a puss.
remember when we came here with Andy and his brother Ross?
we need to talk. He does not deserve this.
the plan's a mistake. - No, it's not.
knock it off. - Did I scare you? Oh, pumpkin.
what is wrong with you? - It's not gonna bite you.
come on. Let me show you something. Let me show you...
how to use it. Come on, put your hand on it.
hold on to that and open it up.
good.
now, I want you to...
gently put them in.
slowly.
slide them all the way down.
that's it.
slowly.
then close it up.
and raise it all the way up.
now, all you have to do...
is squeeze. - Can I join in?
fuck!
Maya! - Fuck!
Maya!
No! No! Don't do this!
it's already done! Now, go find his junkie ass.
I'm gonna double back.
Julian! I don't want to hurt you. Please, come out and let me explain.
come on, Julian.
we just want to talk.
Julian?
Julian, it doesn't have to end this way.
how did you think it was going to end, huh?
with all of us living together happily?
moving to Utah, raising chickens?
no.
it's gonna be me or you.
bitch.
hold this.
hold it!
we're never gonna get away with this.
think happy thoughts, Brit.
well, where are we gonna take him? - Where do you think?
no.
no, not there.
they never found your mom, did they?
her suicide inspires our perfect murder.
at least she didn't die in vain.
Where's Dr. Haynes? - He called in sick today.
Oh, really?
so, what would it take to see Niles Dunlap's body?
a miracle. Mr. Dunlap's body was released for cremation this afternoon.
on whose authority?
his daughter, Maya King.
of course.
of course.
what's Dr. Haynes' home address?
Brittney, grab a leg.
we gotta get him in the water. Come on. Brittney!
shit. - Come on, let's go.
holy shit! - Oh, shit.
Oh, my God, we are fucked! We are fucked!
what are we gonna do? - Calm down, Brittney!
pull yourself together. Take care of that thing.
I'll stall him.
Hi.
what in God's name are you doing out here?
don't you know Gator Alley ain't safe? - Yeah.
I was just out here with some friends...
and they kind of ditched me. So I tried to start my car.
it wouldn't start. Just making my way back to town.
town?
little lady, town is in the opposite direction.
what the hell was that?
I didn't hear anything.
all right, missy, you get in the back seat of the car.
come on, get in the back seat of the car. Move! Now!
maybe you could just give me a jump.
fine.
shit.
where are you?
that was so fucking close.
it's done.
fucking better be. Meet me at Julian's.
shit. Shit.
Dr. Haynes?
Dr. Haynes?
bridge, Bridge, Bridge.
this had better be good.
how'd you like a murder case wrapped up nice...
handed to you on a plate?
murder, huh?
who? - Dr. Julian Haynes.
yeah?
you okay?
you sure? You were kind of freaking me out last night.
I'm sure.
fine. We're on for tonight.
make sure you're ready.
Yeah, I already checked.
nothing over here.
how long do you want us to stay out here?
there ain't nothing down here. - Pack it up.
we're out of here. Motherfucker.
you got any idea what this bullshit cost the department today, huh?
what about Julian's body?
they killed him. He's in there.
the only thing in that swamp is my fucking reputation.
maybe the gators pinned him under a log.
I'm sure if... - Sure what?
that my boss is gonna have my head because of your bullshit?
you're done. I'll make sure of it.
now, get the fuck out of my county.
you eat well last night?
well, I hope you had a great fucking meal!
because it cost me my goddamn job!
this fucking sucks!
it sucks.
the melaleuca sucks everything around it.
fuck.
come on, come on.
shit.
Brit!
Brittney, come on, we gotta go. - We can't go.
why not? - I'm why not.
I need some more ice.
I gotta admit...
it was a cool plan.
I'll give you that.
using those pesky cellar rats to take Niles' plane down...
...making it look like a Cuban hit.
smart.
but not smart enough.
I called some local exterminators...
and I found out all about Miss Havers' well-documented rat problem.
and then, there's the little matter...
of digging up Maya's rotting father...
and getting the coroner to switch the bodies. Very sexy.
you didn't think about the fresh soil you leave behind digging up a body that's been buried for a full year.
not sexy.
and last, but not least...
there's the junkie coroner.
dear old Julian.
now, that was a tough one.
what the fuck are you talking about?
what am I talking about?
I'm talking about a beautiful tree...
that does nothing but suck up everything around it...
till nothing's left.
and those roots, well, they take in anything.
even blood.
what do you want?
I want half the money.
fuck you! - Bad choice.
detective Morrison, please.
Yes, I'll hold.
fine. Fuck! Fine!
you're in, okay?
half the insurance money.
I think not. I want half the score.
thirty-five million.
or Morrison will have the easiest murder case ever.
detective Morrison, Terence Bridge. How you doing?
all right!
half.
I just wanted to apologize for this afternoon.
see you on the back nine.
no.
I'm not giving up my half.
Brittney. Brittney!
fuck.
I'll take care of her.
so how long you been in the insurance business?
eleven years.
eleven years, huh?
must have been tempting.
cut a deal, skim a little off the top.
no, never. - Never?
Really?
Yeah, well, I find that hard to believe.
it's not your money.
what made you change your mind?
eleven years of cutting checks to assholes in wheelchairs...
who later are dancing a fucking jig in Maui.
paying fortunes out to abused wives whose husbands...
inexplicably decide to take baths with toasters, blow dryers.
eleven years of living out of a suitcase...
watching the rich get richer.
and a boss who's just been looking for a reason to fire my ass.
so this is payback time.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
for all the years I've played by the book.
now it's time for old Bridge to get what's coming to him.
it's so nice to finally meet somebody who can play my game.
do it.
please.
you don't... You don't have to do this.
I'm... I was...
you just...
come on, man. - You want half the money?
then you earn it.
okay.
where the hell have you been?
getting her shit together. - Well, we could take her to Gator Alley.
no way the police is gonna check that place again.
just act natural.
nothing's wrong.
nothing's wrong.
we're cool. We're cool.
what the hell are you doing?
stop me. I dare you.
fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
fuck!
double-crossing fucking...
Yes, there's a beige Buick LeSabre, license plate 2-8-8-A-J-H...
driving around downtown Blue Bay with a dead girl in the trunk.
did you say a dead girl in the trunk? - Yes, that's right.
morning, Miss Havers. - Is it ready?
it took a little while to put it all together, but it'll work.
I need to talk to Detective Morrison.
I didn't kill her, Brittney Havers did.
we can't find Brittney Havers. Maybe you killed her too.
you guys are wasting precious time, man.
you need to be at the bus depots, car rentals, the airports.
we already checked. She wasn't there. - What do you mean she wasn't there?
goddamn it.
she doesn't need to buy a plane ticket because she already knows how to fly.
we are out of here!
she's probably halfway to the Cayman Islands by now.
laughing all the way to the bank. - Turn to the left.
Oh, boy, she played me like a punk-ass bitch.
that skank.
turn to the right.
Oh, I'm the fall guy now? Is that what it is, Brittney?
you just gonna disappear and leave me hanging with all this shit.
don't you see what's going on, man? She killed all of them.
you know, she killed all of them! It's as simple as that!
nothing is ever as simple as it appears.
isn't that what you said, Bridge?
it is when it's the truth. - Sure it is.
well, the truth is we found this in the trunk of your car.
right next to the dead girl.
looks like it came from the Dunlap's security system.
what do you want?
I want half the money.
fuck you.
bad choice.
all right.
I got a little greedy.
but I didn't kill Maya, Brittney did. - Jesus Christ.
she must have erased the rest of the tape or something.
the FBI raided the Dunlap mansion based on testimony of a Cuban national arrested in the suspected murder of Niles Dunlap.
early reports show that records seized indicate Mr. Dunlap misappropriated...
millions of dollars of his company's funds...
to finance a gambling addiction.
turning now to entertainment...
concert pianist Benjamin Kosk ert continues to wow...
he's not dead.
he's not dead. - Oh, come on.
Niles Dunlap is not fucking dead.
he knew his corporate balls was gonna be in a sling and he set this thing up.
you killed a little girl, you piece of shit!
they're gonna love you in general population. Get him out.
you couldn't find your dick if they put it in your fucking hand!
in your fucking hand! You won't do this, Morrison!
you can't do this, man! Don't do this, please!
don't do this!
Jesus, Brit.
what are you trying to do, kill me?
it's just a little turbulence. It'll be smooth sailing from here on out.
it sure will.
I'll tell you, greed, it'll do it to you every time.
poor old Mr. Bridge.
you had him figured out the moment you laid those pretty eyes on him, huh?
you ready? - You betcha.
you got an airboat waiting for us? - Yeah, it's all taken care of.
don't worry about a thing.
what's the matter? You afraid I did something when I packed your chute?
maybe.
take mine.
what are you worried about? You're dead already.
you know, you and your mother, you couldn't be more different.
I don't think she would have ever had the brains...
or the balls to pull off something like this.
well, I learned it all from you. - Bad influence, huh?
the worst.
here we go!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry you had to fuck everything in Blue Bay...
and sorry you kept breaking my mother's heart!
what are you talking about?
I'm sorry I packed your chute with newspaper!
you wouldn't do that to your own father!
Stepfather!
you should've taken the first one I gave you, you fuck!
Hi, Mom.
let's go get our money.
I see your 10, 000...
and I raise you 20 more.
Oye, man.
call.
you gotta be fucking kidding me, cabron.
what's that make it? Three, four million you're in the hole?
how could I have been so fucking stupid?
I have a plan.
it'll get you out of all your troubles.
but you're gonna have to trust me.
do you trust me?
really think this will work? - Yeah.
as long as you can get that junkie doctor to cooperate.
Yeah, I'm on it.
Dr. Haynes. - Yeah.
Hi.
can I...
ask you a personal question? - Yeah, sure.
that's it.
we got him.
nice to meet you, Pops.
dickhead.
come here, Bobby.
you're gonna need these.
they're gonna cut down on the glare.
now, you're sure you know how to fly this thing, huh?
we're all set.
the money has been transferred to Zurich.
well, then, I guess we'll go skiing.
strong.
they do make them strong here, don't they?
Damn! Fuck!
they've been looking for you.
don't leave without me. - Where the fuck are you going?
incoming!
that's the colonel's surfboard!
Hey, get the fuck off it. It's mine.
Lance. - Chef, light up, man.
come on. Let's get high.
wanna smoke? - Let's do it, man. Light up.
someday this war's gonna end,
that would be just fine with the boys on the boat, - Captain? - Trouble is, I'd been back there and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore,
buddha time. Here.
all right, that's great, motherfuckers. Yeah.
if that's how Kilgore fought the war
I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz,
it wasn't just insanity and murder,
there was enough of that to go around for everyone,
I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangoes.
I meet Raquel Welch.
I make a nice mango cream pudding.
you know, kind of spread it around on us.
she's into mangoes too.
she's like one limb above me.
we're both in the jungle here nude. - Hey, Chief.
yeah? - Here comes that colonel guy again.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like,
I will not hurt or harm you,
I will not hurt or harm you,
it was a good board, and I like it,
you know how hard it is to find a board you like, - He's a determined motherfucker! - I will not hurt or harm you,
I will not hurt or harm you,
just give me back the board, Lance,
it was a good board, and I like it,
you know how hard it is to find a board you like, - I will not hurt or harm you, - Jesus Christ.
that guy's too fucking much, man.
do you think he would have shot us?
he wouldn't have shot us on the beach.
he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board.
let's go surfing now. Everybody's learning how
how am I gonna shoot him next time he comes around?
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.
sock it to me, Lance.
I wonder if that's the same chopper.
hell, he's probably got them all over the river with that recording.
we'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.
don't worry, Lance. He won't follow us too far.
what makes you say that?
you think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver - to know we stole his board? - I didn't steal it.
captain.
just how far up this river we going?
it's classified, Chief. I can't tell you.
we're going up pretty far.
is it gonna be hairy?
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.
you like it like that, captain, when it's hot, hairy?
fuck.
never get a chance to know what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangoes now, okay?
take somebody with you. - Yeah, I'll take him.
I'll go with him.
chef?
Yes, sir? - How come they call you that?
call me what, sir? - Chef.
because you like mangoes and stuff? - No, sir, I'm a real chef.
I'm a saucier. - Saucier?
Yes, sir.
see, I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier.
what's a saucier? - We specialize in sauces.
gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.
then I was supposed to go to Paris, study at the Escoffier school.
but then I got orders for my physical.
hell, I joined the Navy.
heard they had better food.
cook school, that did it.
Yeah, how's that? - You don't wanna hear about that.
they lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.
all of us, you know, lined up looking at it.
magnificent meat, really. Beautifully marbled.
next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons.
all of it. Boiling it.
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.
I couldn't fucking believe that one.
that's when I applied for radioman school, but then they gave me the...
what is it?
Charlie?
it's a tiger!
son of a bitch! It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!
battle stations. Lance, up front.
get on your 60! - Got it.
holy shit! A fuckin' tiger! - Chef, come on!
captain, come on! - Let's hop in and go!
let's go!
you were right. Never get out of the boat.
bring that 60 forward! - Why never get out of the boat?
I gotta remember! Never get out of the boat!
never get out of the boat!
how many is it? - A fuckin' tiger!
what? - A tiger?
Yes! I've had it! I've had the whole goddam fuckin' shit, man!
you can kiss my ass on the county square...
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.
I didn't come here for this.
I don't fuckin' need it! I don't want it.
I didn't get out the goddam eighth grade for this kind of shit!
all I wanted to do was fuckin' cook!
I just wanted to learn to fuckin' cook, man!
you're all right. - What happened, bro?
you're all right. You're gonna be all right.
all right? It's gonna be all right?
never get out of the fuckin' boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Goodbye!
never get out of the boat.
absolutely goddam right...
unless you were going all the way.
kurtz got off the boat.
he split from the whole fuckin' programme.
how did that happen?
what did he see here that first tour?
thirty-eight fucking years old.
if you joined the Green Berets...
there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.
kurtz knew what he was giving up.
the more I read and began to understand...
the more I admired him.
his family and friends couldn't understand it...
and they couldn't talk him out of it.
he had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit.
but when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.
the next youngest guy in his class was half his age.
they must have thought he was some far-out old man...humping it over that course.
I did it when I was 19. It damn near wasted me.
a tough motherfucker.
he finished it.
he could have gone for general...
but he went for himself instead.
dear Eva...
today was really a new one.
almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger.
really un-fucking believable, you know?
we're taking this guy, Captain Willard, up the river...
but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him.
come on, baby
thought you might have heard by now from Elwood.
october 1967. On special assignment...
kontoom Province, II Corps.
kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.
rated a major success.
he received no official clearance.
he just thought it up and did it.
what balls,
they were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one,
but after the press got ahold of it they promoted him to full colonel instead,
Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam you needed wings to stay above it,
this sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit.
expecting us this time?
damned if I know.
Jesus.
it goes back up into the truck. - What?
we gotta get all that stuff up.
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?
I bet you we can score up here.
you, man. Check out the bikes, Lance.
yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah.
that's a good one. - Yeah, Sukiyaki.
Yeah, man. This is something.
please. - This must be the guy.
right over there.
sergeant. Sergeant.
three drums of diesel fuel, PBR five...
one hour. That's all. What do you want?
can I get some Panama Red? - Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.
sergeant? - Destination?
I don't have no destination. - Can't do a goddamn thing without it.
Sarge? Sarge? - Got a destination?
I need a destination. Can't do a goddamn thing without it.
Sarge, these guys are with me. Destination's classified.
I carry priority papers from COMSEC Intelligence.
okay. Right, sir. Hey, listen, it's a real big night.
eight bucks for that... - Hey.
all right. Damn.
just give him some fuel. - You got it.
dog starts barking. - Hey, listen, captain.
I'm really sorry about tonight. It's really bad around here.
just take this over to the man at the supply desk and you got it.
would you guys like some seats...? Some press-box seats for the show?
you want those? The show out here.
bunnies, bunnies. - Playboy bunnies?
you got it. Are you gonna be here?
Hey, listen, captain, on the house.
no hard feelings, huh?
how you doing out there?
I said, how you doing out there?
wanna say hello to you from all of us up here, to all of you out there who have worked so goddamn hard on Operation Brute Force.
Hello, all you paratroopers out there.
and the Marines. And the sailors.
we wanna let you know we're proud of you.
we know how tough and how hard it's been. Yeah!
to prove it, we're gonna give you entertainment we know you're gonna like.

and the Playmate of the Year, Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!

Hello! - What's the matter?

Yeah!

Hey, lover! You want us to come over?
I sure do! - Sign my centerfold!

come on.
will you sign this? Please?
Hey, girls! Let's go!
come on! Hurry!
so long!
Charlie didn't get much USO,
he was dug in too deep or moving too fast,
his idea of great R and R was cold rice and a little rat meat,
he had only two ways home;
death or victory,
no wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass,
the war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away,
Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out.
I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December, Chief.
Hey, Clean, look at that. She was here, man.
I even wrote to the cunt. She didn't write me back.
you can really get hung up on these broads, just like that cat in the delta.
Yeah, you'd better believe it. - What cat?
the one that went up for murder. He was an Army sergeant.
remember? This cat, man, he really dug his Playboy, man.
I mean, like, this cat, - Dig it.
when the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man. He just knew.
look at these beautiful fucking jugs, man!
Yeah, so anyway, he was working ARVN patrols, you know?
had one of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants and shit.
one day the gook took his magazine from him and wouldn't give it back.
he said, "Give me my magazine back."
gook say, "You shut up. I have you court-martialed." You know?
typical fucking ARVN, man. - Yeah, man.
so then the gook starts to go too far. - Chef. Take the wheel.
this dude started to stick pinholes in the lady's tits.
take the wheel.
he started sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold and all kinds of shit like that.
and the sergeant said, "You'd better not do that to her."
don't do her like that," right?
gook say, "Fuck you," in Vietnamese. - Goddamn.
the sergeant, man, he just couldn't handle it no more.
he just picked up his iron, flipped it to rock 'n' roll and:
gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.
it blew his ass clean off of the dock.
there wasn't no more lieutenant that day, man.
that was it for his ass.
they burn him for it? - The sergeant? Yeah, man.
they stuck his ass in the LBJ.
it's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothing.
fucking ARVN, man.
they should have killed the fuck.
should have given the fucker a Silver Star.
bummer for the gook, though, wasn't it?
good morning, Vietnam,
I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AMVN,
it's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon right now, also very humid,
and we have an important message for all Gls who are living off-base from the mayor of Saigon,
Yeah!
he'd like you to hang your laundry indoors instead of on the windowsills,
the mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful,
here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam, who's alone in the mantle room out there with the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, and dedicated by the fire team at An Khe to their groovy CO Fred the Head;
the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction," - All right!
watch out, Clean!
get down, bubba!
hang on, Lance!
get down, bubba!
tell them you did it, Lance. Tell them you did it.
I see you are right on target today, baby.
work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
all right!
look out, Lance!
commitment and Counterinsurgency'
by Colonel Walter E, Kurtz,
as long as our officers and troops perform tours of duty limited to one year, they will remain dilettantes in war and tourists in Vietnam,
as long as cold beer, hot food, rock 'n' roll and all the other amenities remain the expected norm, our conduct of the war will gain only impotence,
we need fewer men, and better,
if they were committed, this war could be won with a fourth of our present force,
shit. Chicken time. - Holy shit.
you ain't shitting, bro. The motherfucking...
who is that? - What's going on?
is that you, Lazzaro? - Come on, Chief.
don't chicken out now.
fire on the canopy!
I got it! I got it! I got it!
Lance, get down!
put that fucker out, man!
what the fuck they think they're doing?
late summer, autumn, 1968,
kurtz's patrols in the highlands coming under frequent ambush,
the camp started falling apart,
november,
kurtz orders assassination of three Vietnamese men and one woman,
two of the men were colonels in the South Vietnamese army,
enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing,
guess he must have hit the right four people,
he joined the Special Forces,
and after that, his...
the Army tried one last time to bring him back into the fold, - methods...
and if he'd pulled over, it all would have been forgotten, - unsound,
but he kept going, - Now he's crossed into Cambodia - And he kept winning it his way, with this Montagnard army of his...
and they called me in, - who worship the man like a god and follow every order, however ridiculous.
they lost him,
he was gone,
nothing but rumors and random intelligence, mostly from captured VC,
the VC knew his name by now, and they were scared of him,
he and his men were playing hit and run all the way into Cambodia,
I know where I'm going.
I'm going to the White House to have dinner with the president of the United States, baby.
that's where I'm going.
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.
clean.
how long has that kid been on this boat?
seven months.
he's really specializing in busting my balls.
very possible, captain, he thinks the same of you.
Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
my orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat, so I don't.
but one look at you and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.
we're going upriver about 75 klicks above the Do Lung Bridge.
that's Cambodia, captain. - That's classified.
we're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going.
you just get me close to my destination and I'll cut you and the crew loose.
all right, captain.
dear son,
I'm afraid both you and your mother will have been worried at not hearing from me during the past weeks, but my situation here has become a difficult one,
I have been officially accused of murder by the Army,
the alleged victims were four Vietnamese double agents,
we spent months uncovering them and accumulating evidence,
when absolute proof was completed, we acted,
we acted like soldiers,
the charges are unjustified,
they are, in fact, and in the circumstances of this conflict, quite completely insane,
in a war, there are many moments for compassion and tender action,
what is often called ruthless, but may in many circumstances be only clarity, seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it - Medevac, come in. Over. - Directly, - quickly, awake, - Alpha, Tango, Tango,
I would trust you to tell your mother what you choose about this letter,
as for the charges against me, I am unconcerned,
medevac, come in.
I am beyond their timid, lying morality, and so I am beyond caring,
you have all my faith,
Jesus.
no wonder I couldn't get them on the radio.
what a dump.
hi there! - How you doing?
wow, that's a nice little boat you got there.
never seen one up here before.
you know, we called in a request for a medevac. You guys receive it?
medevac? No.
Yeah, we passed a downed Huey with some KIAs.
on your way here? - Yeah.
so you're going up this river? - Way up.
way upriver? Whoa, forget it.
Why? Why?
well, we wanna send some people downriver.
just forget it. - What the fuck was that?
we'll be back in a couple of days. - Yeah, right. You'll be back.
Hey, Chief? - Yeah, captain?
see what you can do with that engine.
I'm gonna have a look around. - All right.
Hey, don't leave without me.
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
don't ask me, man.
give my clothes back, asshole!
fucking asshole!
Hey, guys, where's the CO?
he stepped on a land mine about two months ago. Got all blown to hell.
who's in charge here? - Charge?
I don't know, man. I'm just the night man.
just doing what I'm told. Shit. I'm just a working girl.
what about you, Fella?
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam. You mark my words.
keep it in that condition, it's your ass. - Get off my back.
no, man, I'm telling you... - Lay off!
Hey! Hey! Come here!
is that your boat? Come on inside.
what do you want?
come on inside. I wanna talk to you. Come on!
get out of the rain.
get off me!
come on. Cut this shit. Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.
Hey, how you doing, captain? I want you to meet some people.
I got your ass. - Your ass is shit.
chef, your ass is shit!
you're a motherfucker.
you're a motherfucker, man.
goddamn, my ear, you motherfucker.
get him off me, Chef. - You smart-ass.
Hey, guys.
I got you! I got you, man!
you ain't shit, Chef. - Hey, fellas.
you broke my fucking knee, man. - Hey, guys.
I just made a deal with the people from Hau Phat.
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies.
Hey!
Hey! Hey! You shitting me?
no, I'm not. Grab a couple barrels and get up to that big tent.
come on!
captain.
you're giving away our fuel for a Playmate of the Month?
Nope. Playmate of the Year, Chief.
warm them up, baby! Warm them up!
warm them up.
captain, we get in a firefight and run out of fuel,
I want you to tell me how she was.
you got some mamas in there? - Some what?
forget it, captain. I'll stay with the boat.
Hey, captain! Give me a hand.
you know, I got a...
I got every one of your pictures.
I got the centerfold, the Playmate's Review, the Playmate of the Year runoff.
I even got the calendar.
Hey, Oiseau. Wait, how come you got a bird?
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.
Busch Gardens? - Yeah, I used to train birds there.
you are...
you are Miss December, aren't you? - Miss May.
is it coming?
miss December had black hair. - It's over there.
he's not one of my regular birds.
come on. Come on, baby. Snack? Snatch a cracker. Come here.
being Playmate of the Year...
...is the loneliest experience I can imagine.
it's like, you try to express your feelings to someone and show them your heart...
Yeah, I wanna hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.
but would you mind just putting this...?
would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please?
and there's this glass wall between you.
this invisible glass.
and they can see your mouth moving.
I used to train birds for at least two years - That's beautiful. - At Busch Gardens...
this was kind of cascading over your right shoulder and this was open here.
but they can't hear what you're saying.
I used to train them to stand on their head and fly upside down, and ride a little bicycle.
your right hand was kind of... - Hey, Chef!
Hey, come on. Get out of here, man! - Come on, Chef!
someone wants to talk to you. - Later, later. Give me 15 minutes.
because you can never really make them hear what you're trying to say.
Yeah, your ass was sticking out just a little... Hey, man, fuck off!
fifteen minutes!
that's why I tried so desperately...
...to show somebody that I had some talent.
little baby macaws.
have you ever seen a baby macaw? - That's kind of open there.
they're all blue and gold. - Come on. Take off, would you?
I got my rights, man!
they make you do things that you don't wanna do.
like...
like this picture here.
I started feeling repulsed with myself.
you were just kind of bending forward. Your ass just kind of out a little bit.
that's over there. That's it. - I love training birds.
that's it. That's very... That's it.
you're beautiful. I just wanna...
you know, I can't believe it.
me, Jay Hicks.
I mean, I can't believe I'm really here, you know?
maybe I'm unfit to have a relationship with a beautiful, innocent boy.
I never would have met you, Miss December.
miss May.
I wish... I wish I could find just one person...
...that could share my point of view.
Oh, you kiss like a bird!
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!
who is that?
you're driving me crazy! Oh, kiss me!
Oh, my God. Take it off. - I love birds.
you finished yet?
like a bird! Sing like a bird!
fly, baby! Cock it to me!
fly! - I can fly like an eagle!
I'm an eagle! - It drives me crazy!
it drives me crazy!
Lance, that was somebody's son.
Lance, there were things that they made me do that I didn't wanna do.
like, they said, "Pull the ribbons between your legs.
and I didn't wanna do it.
but they said that was what was expected of me.
that's what people wanted to see.
who are you? - Oh, I'm next, ma'am.
hell, I didn't know he was a cherry.
didn't know you never got no pussy. - Shove it, fuck-up.
sorry about that. If I'd have known, I'd take you to New Orleans.
lay off, Chef. - Cherry boy, cherry boy.
you're a fucking dog!
come on down to New Orleans. I'll get you fixed up, you prick.
lay off, Chef.
you're the only fucking prick I see around here.
if I wanna play with a prick, I'll play with my own.
you wouldn't know what to do with it, cherry boy.
chef, I said lay off!
chef, knock it off! Give him a break! What do you think I said?
then give your jaws a rest!
and this ain't the Army. You are a sailor.
so get out of that frizzly Army-looking shit, and stop smoking that dope. You hear me?
Lance, what's with all the green paint?
camouflage. - How's that?
so they can't see you. They're everywhere, Chief.
I want you to stay awake up there, man. You got a job to do.
sampan off the port bow. Let's take a look. Lance.
bring them in. Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16.
what's up, Chief?
a junk boat, captain. We're gonna take a routine check.
well, let's forget routine now and let them go.
these boats are running supplies in this delta, captain.
I'm gonna take a look.
chief, my mission's got priority.
hell, you wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.
until we reach your destination, captain, you're just on for the ride.
stand by, Lance. - Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.
all right. Come on. Let's bring it over.
look in that forward hooch. Bring the people out of there.
come on! Hurry up, motherfucker! Move it!
you too. Come on. - Keep your eyes open.
I got you, Chief.
it's clear, Chief.
okay, that's them. That's them. They're okay.
board and search it. - It's just a fucking boat.
there ain't nothing on it. - Board it and search it.
there's baskets, there's ducks. Fucking bananas.
ain't nothing on it.
what's wrong with you? Search it. - There's the goat. Some fish.
chef. - Fucking vegetables...
get on that boat! - There's nothing on it, man!
get on it! - All right!
move it, asshole! Move it, goddamn it!
some pigs. Look, mangoes.
what's in the rice bag? - Fucking rice.
look in there, Chef. Look in it. - Coconuts and fucking fish.
more coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.
what's in that vegetable basket? - Get out of here! Come on!
get over there, goddamn it! - Chef, check that vegetable basket.
all right. - Shut up, slope!
there ain't nothing in here. - What's in the boxes?
look in that tin can. That rusty can. - Nothing.
just fucking rice and that's all! There ain't nothing on it!
check the yellow can. She was sitting on it. What's in it?
chef!
motherfuckers!
motherfuckers!
motherfuckers! Motherfuckers!
hold it! - Come on! Let's kill them all, huh?
motherfucking cocksucking mothers! - Hold it! Hold it!
let's kill all the assholes! Shoot the shit out of all of them.
hold it, Chef! Hold it! - Why not? Jesus Christ.
why the fuck not?
clean? - I'm good.
you okay, Lance? - Fuck! Shit!
chef, you okay? - Look what she was hiding, huh?
you all right? - See what she was running for?
it's a fucking puppy.
it's a fucking puppy.
give me that dog! Give me that dog! - No! You're not gonna get it!
fucking give it to me! - No, give me the fucking dog, asshole!
fuck you!
chef. Chef. - Fucking mango too! You want that?
chef, she's moving behind you. She's alive. Check her out.
chef! She's moving behind you. Check her out!
all right. All right.
come on, Clean! - She's not dead. She's wounded.
clean, give him a hand. - Fuck it.
just take it easy. Take it easy.
bring her up. - Is she breathing?
she's hurt. She's bleeding. - Oh, man.
bring her onboard. We're taking her to an ARVN.
what are you talking about? - We're taking her to some friendlies.
she's wounded. She's not dead. - Get out of there, Chef.
the book says, captain...
fuck, yeah. Fuck them.
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.
Saigon.
shit.
I'm still only in Saigon.
every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in thejungle.
when I was home after my first tour, it was worse.
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.
I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce.
when I was here, I wanted to be there.
when I was there, all I could think of was getting back into thejungle.
I'm here a week now.
waiting for a mission...
getting softer.
every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.
and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger.
each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.
everyone gets everything he wants.
I wanted a mission...
and for my sins, they gave me one.
brought it up to me like room service.
captain Willard? Are you in there?
Yeah, I'm comin'.
it was a real choice mission.
and when it was over,
I'd never want another.
what do you want?
are you all right, Captain?
what does it look like?
are you Willard, 505th Battalion? -Affirmative.
173rd Airborne? -Yeah.
assigned to SOG? -Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?
we have orders to escort you to the airfield.
what are the charges?
What'd I do? -There's no charges, Captain.
you have orders to report to Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.
I see. -All right?
Nha Trang, for me? -That's right.
come on, Captain. You still have a few hours to get cleaned up.
I'm not feeling too good. -Captain?
Dave, come here and give me a hand. We got a dead one.
come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.
don't be an ass. -Get a hold of him good.
we're gonna take a shower, Captain. In we go.
stand underneath this, Captain.
I was going to the worst place in the world...
and I didn't even know it yet.
weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river...
that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable...
plugged straight into Kurtz.
it was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. kurtz's memory.
any more than being back in Saigon was an accident.
there is no way to tell his story without telling my own.
if his story is really a confession
captain Willard reporting, sir.
then so is mine.
captain. Good. Come on in. -Thank you, sir.
stand at ease.
general.
you want a cigarette?
no, thank you, sir.
have you ever seen this man before?
no, sir. -Met the general or myself?
no, sir. Not personally.
you've worked a lot on your own?
Yes, sir, I have.
your report specifiIes intelligence...
counter intelligence with Com-Sec, I Corps.
I'm not presently disposed to discuss those operations, sir.
did you not work for the CIA in " I " Corps?
no, sir.
did you not assassinate a government tax collector Quang Tri Province, June 1 8, 1 968?
captain?
sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation
nor would I be disposed to discuss such an operation if it did, in fact, exist, sir.
I thought we'd have a bite of lunch while we talk.
I hope you brought a good appetite, Captain.
I notice that you have a bad hand there.
you wounded?
I had a little fishing accident on R and R, sir.
fishing on R and R? -Yes, sir.
but you're feeling fit? You're ready for duty?
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.
well, let's see what we have here, roast beef, and usually it's not bad.
try some, Jerry, and pass it around.
to save a little time, we might pass both ways.
captain, I don't know how you feel about this shrimp...
but if you'll eat it you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way.
I swear, why don't I just take a piece here?
captain, you've heard of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.
Oh, Jesus!
operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.
Luke, would you play that tape for the captain, please?
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. -Listen to this carefully, Captain.
october 6, 0430 hours, sector Peter, Victor, king.
these were monitored out of Cambodia.
this has been verifiIed as Col. kurtz's voice.
I watched a snail...
crawl along the edge of a straight razor.
that's my dream.
that's my nightmare.
crawling, slithering...
along the edge of a straight razor and surviving.
transmission 1 1, received '68, December 30, 0500 hours.
sector King, Zulu, King.
but we must kill them.
we must incinerate them.
pig after pig.
cow after cow.
village after village. Army after army.
and they call me an assassin.
what do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?
they lie.
they lie, and we have to be merciful for those who lie.
those nabobs.
I hate them.
I do hate them.
Walt kurtz was one of the most outstanding offiIcers this country's ever produced.
he was brilliant. He was outstanding in every way.
and he was a good man, too, a humanitarian man.
a man of wit and humor.
he joined the Special Forces.
and after that his ideas, methods became unsound
unsound.
now he's crossed into Cambodia with this...
Montagnard army of his that worship the man like a god...
and follow every order, however ridiculous.
well, I have some other shocking news to tell you.
col. Kurtz was about to be arrested for murder.
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?
kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents
men he believed were double agents.
so he took matters into his own hands.
well, you see, Willard...
in this war, things get confused out there.
power, ideals, the old morality...
and practical military necessity.
but out there with these natives...
it must be a temptation to be God.
because there's a conflict in every human heart...
between the rational and the irrational...
between good and evil...
and good does not always triumph.
sometimes...
the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
every man has got a breaking point.
you and I have them.
Walt kurtz has reached his.
and very obviously, he has gone insane.
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. Obviously insane.
your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a navy patrol boat
pick up Col. kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba...
follow it, learn what you can along the way.
when you find the colonel, infiIltrate his team by whatever means available and terminate the colonel's command.
terminate the colonel?
he's out there operating without any decent restraint...
totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct...
and he is still on the field, commanding troops.
terminate with extreme prejudice.
you understand, Captain, that this mission does not exist nor will it ever exist.
how many people had I already killed?
there were those six that I knew about for sure
close enough to blow their last breath in my face.
but this time it was an American...
and an officer.
that wasn't supposed to make any difference to me...
but it did.
shit.
charging a man with murder in this place...
was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
I took the mission.
what the hell else was I gonna do?
but I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him.
did you check the tank?
Yeah.
I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR...
a type of plastic patrol boat
a pretty common sight on the rivers.
they said it was a good way to pick up information and move...
without drawing a lot of attention, and that was okay.
I needed the air and the time.
only problem was I wouldn't be alone.
mornin', Captain.
the crew were mostly just kids
rockand rollers with one foot in their graves.
how old are you? -Seventeen.
the machinist--the one they called Chef
was from New Orleans.
he was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.
probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans.
Lance, on the forward fifties was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L. A.
to look at him, you wouldn't believe he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.
Clean--Mr. Clean--was from some South Bronx shit-hole...
and I think the light and the space of Vietnam...
really put the zap on his head.
then there was Phillips, the chief.
it might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the chief " s boat.
there's about two points where we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River.
they're both hot. Belong to Charlie.
don't worry about it.
don't smoke.
you know, I've pulled a few special ops in here.
about six months ago...
I took a man who was going up past the bridge at Do Lung.
he was regular army too.
heard he shot himself in the head.
at first I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.
third-generation West Point, top of his class.
korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations.
et cetera, et cetera.
I'd heard his voice on the tape, and it really put the hookin me...
but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man.
like they said, he had an impressive career.
maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.
he was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation
general, chief of staff, anything.
in 1 664, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam...
and things started to slip.
his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.
seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them.
during the next few months, he made three requests for transfer to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia, and was finally accepted.
airborne?
he was 38 years old.
why the fuck would he do that?
1966, joins Special Forces...
returns to Vietnam.
Hey, what's that?
arc light. -What's up?
b-52 strike. -Yeah?
what's that? -Arc light.
I hate that. Every time I hear that, something terrible happens.
Charlie don't never see 'em or hear 'em, man.
there they are.
concussion will suck the air out of your damn lungs.
something terrible is gonna happen.
smoke!
secondary burning.
hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.
let's have a look, Chief.
it was the Air-Cav. First of the Ninth
that's them.
our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.
but they were supposed to be waiting for us another 30 kilometers ahead.
well, Air Mobile. Those boys just couldn't stay put.
Hey, kid, come on. Get down. Come on.
first of the Ninth was an old cavalry division...
that had cashed in its horses for choppers...
and gone tear-assing around 'Nam looking for the shit.
they'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here.
what they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.
just keeping running by. We're for television.
don't look at the camera. Just keep--Go on. keep going.
this is for television. Don't look at the camera.
just go by like you're fighting, like you're fighting.
don't look at the camera. It's for television. Just go through.
just go by. keep on going.
keep going. Don't look at the camera. Go on. keep going.
all right, come on. Go.
right here. Yes. Over here. Over here.
where can I find the CO?
that's the colonel comin' down!
the CO's on that chopper.
lieutenant, bomb that tree line back about 1 00 yards!
give me some room to breathe! -Yes, sir!
body cards!
bring my body cards! -Yes, sir!
I'm the Fourth Tank commander. I got five tanks broken down.
we're all right with the tanks. It's all right, Captain.
captain Willard!
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you...
on the requirements of my mission.
what mission? I haven't heard from Nha Trang.
sir, your unit is supposed to escort us into the Nung!
we'll see what we can do. -Colonel!
but just stay out of my way until this is done, Captain.
all right, let's see what we have. Let's see what we have.
a two of spades, three of spades, four of diamonds...
six of clubs, eight of spades.
there isn't one worth a jack in the whole bunch.
four of diamonds.
Hey, Captain, what's that? -Death cards!
what? -Death cards!
death? -Lets Charlie know who did this.
cheer up, son. -We will not hurt or harm you.
fire in the hole! -Fire in the hole!
this is an area that is controlled by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Jim.
we are here to help you.
we extend a welcome hand...
come on. Everybody in? -To those who would like to return...
to the arms of the South Vietnamese government.
get in. Hurry up.
move it out. -This is an area that is controlled by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Hey! What's this?
what is this?
this man's hurt pretty bad, sir.
about the only thing that's holding his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.
yeah? What do you have to say?
this soldier is dirty VC.
he wants water. He can drink paddy water.
get out here! Give me that canteen.
he's VC! -Any man that's brave enough to get outta here! I'll kick your fuckin' ass!
he killed a lot of our people!
any man brave enough to fiIght with his guts strapped on him can drink from my canteen.
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.
where? Here? You sure?
yeah? Here.
down there.
repeat. We have a body count. We have
what's your name, sailor?
gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
gunner's Mate Third Class
lance Johnson, the surfer?
Yes, sir.
it's an honor to meet you.
I've admired your nose riding for years.
I like your cutback too.
I think you have the best cutback there is.
thank you, sir. -You can cut out the " sir " crap.
I'm Bill kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.
this guy with ya? -Yeah.
I want you to meet some guys.
this is Mike from San Diego. -Far out.
Johnny from Malibu.
John, hi. Far out. -Solid surfers.
none of us are anywhere near your class though.
no way.
we do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.
fly down to Yung Tau for the evening glass.
been riding since you got here?
no way. I haven't surfed since I been here.
through Christ, our Lord from Whom all good things come...
through Him in the unity of the Holy Spirit.
all glory and honor is Yours, Almighty Father.
let us bring our iniquities to the Father in the words our Savior gave us.
our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
thy kingdom come.
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread...
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
kilgore had had a pretty good day for himself.
they choppered in the T-bones and the beer...
and turned the LZ into a beach party.
the more they tried to make it just like home...
the more they made everybody miss it.
make my meat rare--rare but not cold.
well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.
he loved his boys, and you felt safe with him.
he was one of those guys that had that weird light around him.
you just knew he wasn't gonna get so much as a scratch here.
what happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?
airborne.
sir, two places we can get into the river.
Yeah. -Here and here.
it's a pretty wide delta, but these are the only two spots I'm sure of.
that village you're pointing at is kind of hairy.
what do you mean " hairy, " sir? -It's hairy.
got some pretty heavy ordnance.
I lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
what's the name of that goddamn village?
vin Drin Dop. Dop or Lop?
damn gook names all sound the same.
Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop?
that's a fantastic peak.
peak? -About six foot.
it's an outstanding peak. It's got both the long right and left slide...
with a bowl section that's unbelievable. It's just tube city.
why didn't you tell me that before? A good peak.
there aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country.
it's all goddamn beach break. -It's really hairy in there.
that's where we lost McDonald.
they shot the hell out of us there. That's Charlie's point.
sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.
there's always a good offshore breeze in the morning.
we may not be able to get the boat in.
the draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow.
we'll pick your boat up and put it down like a baby where you want it.
this is the First of the Ninth, Air-Cav, son.
air mobile!
I can take that point and hold it as long as I like.
you can get anyplace up that river that suits you, young Captain.
hell, a six-foot peak.
take a gunship back to the division.
Lance, go with Mike and let him pick out a board for you.
bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight-six.
I don't know, sir -What is it, soldier?
it's hairy in there. It's Charlie's point.
Charlie don't surf!
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't gonna believe this. Look.
Hey, man! They're pickin' up the boat!
how are you feeling, Jimmy?
like a mean motherfucker, sir!
all right, son, let 'er rip.
let's go!
I never have got used to a light board.
I can't get used to one.
I'm used to a heavy board. -I know, it's a real drag.
you prefer a heavy or light board? -Heavier.
Really? -Yeah!
I thought all the young guys like lighter boards.
you can't ride the nose on those.
big Duke Six. Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
this is Eagle Thrust Seven. We've got it spotted.
put on heading two-seven-zero.
assume attack formation.
that's a roger, Big Duke.
we're going in.
Hey, Lance, we'll come in low out of the rising sun.
about a mile out, we'll put on the music.
music? -Yeah, I use Wagner.
scares the hell out of the slopes. My boys love it.
Hey, they're gonna play music!
how come all you guys sit on your helmet?
so we don't get our balls blown off.
big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. Put on psy war op.
make it loud. This is a Romeo Fox Trot.
shall we dance?
Yes, sir!
come on! -All right. Fire.
we got a couple--at that tree line.
we're taking fire from the holes.
run, Charlie!
this should make everything burn.
we got a couple of people ahead here.
what's going down here?
we got an automatic! Shoot to kill!
shoot to kill in the open!
I spotted a large weapon down below.
we're gonna go down and check it out.
all right, this is Fox Trot. We're pullin'in.
what a shot.
outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
get you a case of beer for that.
Six-four-one-zero, we're over the village right now.
I see a vehicle in the courtyard. I'm gonna check it out.
well done, Hawks.
want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan along those tree lines.
ripple the shit out of'em.
got a vehicle on the bridge, 50 caliber on board.
he's moving across to resupply the weapon.
big Duke Six, clear the area. I'm coming down myself.
don't these people ever give up?
nice shot, Bill.
shit! -All right, all right!
it's just a flare! It's a flare!
gotta get outta here! -Un-ass that shit.
get it outta here!
get it out. It's just a flare. It's all right.
everybody all right? Lance?
I'm fine!
get down!
I'm not going! I'm not going!
I'm not going.
we just got a secondary down there in the plaza.
hold on to your position.
Duke Six, we've got wounded down there.
get a stretcher over here!
please, God! Help me!
give him some morphine. -My God! Oh!
Where's that duster?
I want my wounded out of there and in the hospital in 1 5 minutes.
I want my men out.
somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.
this is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in, throw 'em on and get out.
she's got a grenade!
she's got a grenade!
the whole thing blew up.
she blew the shit -Fucking savages.
get a medevac.
holy Christ, she's a SAP. I'm gonna get that dinkbitch.
get over there, Johnny. Roll that right skid right up her ass.
we gotta get some air in these trees.
it's goddamn eat-up with enemy down here.
I'm taking fire. I'm taking hits all over.
three o'clock! I'm drawing heavy fire!
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin'in. My tail rotor's out. I got control.
what do you think? -Wow! This is really exciting, man.
No! No! The waves!
the waves! -Oh, right.
look at that. Breaks both ways.
watch.
watch. Look! Good six-foot swells!
come here, Lance.
incoming!
this LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.
what do you know about surfiIng, Major?
you're from goddamn New Jersey.
come here! Come here!
change! -You mean right now, sir?
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is. Go change.
it's still pretty hairy out there.
do you wanna surf, soldier? -Yes, sir.
that's good, son, 'cause you either surf or fight.
that clear?
get going.
I'll cover for 'em. And bring a board for Lance.
we can't do shit until the boat gets here.
Lance, I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.
what? -See how they break both ways?
one guy can break right, one left, simultaneous.
what do you think?
we ought to wait for the tide to come up.
come here. Look. -Incoming!
the tide doesn't come in for six hours!
you wanna wait here for six hours?
yo! Chief! Chief!
okay, fellas, quit hiding.
come on! Let's go!
goddamn it!
don't you think it's a little risky for R and R?
if I say it's safe to surf this beach, it's safe to surf this beach!
I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fuckin' place.
give me that R-T, soldier.
dove Four, this is Big Duke Six. Goddamn it!
I want that tree line bombed!
big Duke Six, roger. Dove One-Three, stand by.
blow them into the Stone Age, son!
out! -No, back, no!
let me take care of this.
get that out of here!
I'm sorry. -Come here now. All right.
no, ma'am. Sorry!
Jimmy!
hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three.
they need some napalm in the tree line.
can you put it down there?
right, One-Three. We're fixin' to fuck with 'em.
what's the target?
we're trying to suppress some mortar fire off the tree line down there.
Roger. Here we come.
good. Give it all you got. Bring in all your ships.
put him in my chopper. Get him back to the hospital.
no, no, no, you got to go with him. -Come on! Go!
get it outta here! Tell my guys I want my board!
big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three. The jets are inbound now.
you got about 30 seconds to bomb station.
get your people backand heads down.
this is gonna be a big one.
don't worry.
we'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.
give me those shorts.
these are from the Air-Cav, a present from me and the boys.
I want to see you do your stuff in 'em out there.
you smell that?
do you smell that? -What?
napalm, son.
nothing else in the world smells like that.
come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
you know, one time we had a hill bombed for 1 2 hours.
when it was all over, I walked up.
we didn't fiInd one of them, not one stinking dink body.
but the smell--You know, that gasoline smell.
the whole hill smelled like...
victory.
someday this war's gonna end.
Lance! The wind!
the wind! -What?
it's blowin' onshore!
it's gonna blow this place out.
it's gonna ruin it! -Not cool!
it's gonna blow out! -It's the goddamn napalm!
that's what's doin' it! -I know.
I'm really sorry, Colonel. I'm afraid that does it.
the kid's got a reputation.
you can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves.
I understand. -I'm an artist, Bill.
I couldn't surf that stuff.
I apologize. It's not my fault.
the waves are gettin' blown out by the napalm.
don't get me wrong
it was the bombs causing a vortex with the wind.
I accept your apology.
but if you could hang around 20 minutes
some other time, Bill. -Just 20 minutes!
I'm an artist. -keep walking.
okay, give it a try, guys.
one goes left and one goes right.
look, Lance.
you through surfiIng? -Yeah!
wanna say good-bye to the colonel? -No.
you sure? -Yeah!
get the fuck outta here. -It's the napalm.
just wait 20 minutes!
Damn! Fuck!
they've been lookin' for ya.
don't leave without me! -Where the fuck you goin'?
here!
that's the colonel's surfboard!
incoming! Hey, get the fuck off me! It's mine!
Lance. -Chef, light up, man.
come on. Let's get high.
wanna smoke? -Let's do it, man. Light up.
someday this war's gonna end.
that would bejust fine with the boys on the boat.
they weren't looking for anything more than a way home.
captain? -Trouble is, I'd been back there...
and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.
buddha time. Here.
all right, that's great, you motherfuckers. Yeah.
if that's how kilgore fought the war...
I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz.
it wasn't just insanity and murder.
there was enough of that to go around for everyone.
I mean, he never was hurtin' for pussy.
I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos.
I meet Raquel Welch.
I make a nice mango cream pudding.
you know, kind of spread it around on us.
she's into mangos too.
she's like one limb above me.
we're both in the jungle here nude. -Hey, Chief.
yeah? -Here comes that colonel guy again.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
just give me back the board, Lance.
it was a good board, and I like it.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
he's a determined motherfucker!
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
just give me back the board, Lance.
it was a good board, and I like it.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you. -Jesus Christ.
that guy's too fuckin' much, man.
do you think he would have shot us?
he wouldn't have shot us on the beach...
but he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board.
let's go surfin'now Everybody's learnin'how -Let's get this board out of my turret. -Sucker.
how am I going to shoot him the next time he comes around?
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.
sock it to me, Lance.
I wonder if that's the same chopper.
he's probably got them all over the river with that recording.
we'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.
don't worry, Lance. He won't follow us too far.
what makes you say that?
you think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver...
to know we stole his board? －I didn't steal it!
captain?
just how far up this river we goin'?
it's classifiIed, Chief. I can't tell ya.
we're goin' up pretty far.
is it gonna be hairy?
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.
you like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy?
fuck.
maybe you'll get a chance to know what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangos now, okay?
take somebody with ya. -Yeah, I'll take
I'll go with him.
chef?
Yes, sir? -How come they call you that?
call me what, sir? -Chef.
because you like mangos and stuff?
no, sir, I'm a real chef.
I'm a saucier. -Saucier?
Yes, sir. See,
I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier.
what's a saucier? -You specialize in sauces.
gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.
then, I was supposed to go to Paris...
study at the EscoffiIer school.
but then I got orders for my physical.
hell, I joined the navy.
heard they had better food.
cook school--That did it.
Yeah, how's that? -You don't wanna hear about that.
they lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.
all of us, you know, lined up lookin' at it.
MagnifiIcent meat. Really! Beautifully marbled.
next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons
all of it--boiling it!
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.
I couldn't fucking believe that one.
that's when I applied for radioman school, but then they gave me
what is it?
Charlie?
it's a tiger! Son of a bitch!
it's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!
battle stations. Lance, up front.
get on your 60! -Got it.
holy shit! Chef, come on!
a fuckin' tiger!
captain, come on!
let's go!
you were right. Never get out of the boat.
bring that 60 forward!
I gotta remember! Never get out of the boat!
never get out of the boat!
what happen? How many is it?
a fuckin' tiger! -What? A tiger?
Yes! I've had it!
I've had the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man!
you can kiss my ass on the county square...
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.
I don't fuckin' need it! I don't want it.
all I wanted to do was fuckin' cook!
I just wanted to learn to fuckin' cook, man!
you're all right.
you're all right. You're gonna be all right.
never get out of the fuckin' boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Good-bye!
never get out of the boat.
absolutely, goddamn right...
unless you were going all the way.
kurtz got off the boat.
he split from the whole fuckin'program.
how did that happen?
what did he see here that first tour?
thirty-eight fucking years old.
if you joined the Green Berets...
there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.
kurtz knew what he was giving up.
the more I read and began to understand...
the more I admired him.
his family and friends couldn't understand it...
and they couldn't talk him out of it.
he had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit.
but when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.
the next youngest guy in his class was half his age.
they must have thought he was some far-out old man...
humping it over that course.
I did it when I was 1 6. It damn near wasted me.
a tough motherfucker.
he finished it.
he could have gone for general...
but he went for himself instead.
dear Eva...Today was really a new one.
almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger.
really un-fucking believable, you know?
we're taking this guy, Captain Willard, up the river...
but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him.
thought you might have heard by now from Elwood.
october 1 667.
on special assignment Kontoom Province, II Corps.
kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.
rated a major success.
he received no official clearance.
he just thought it up and did it.
what balls.
they were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one.
but after the press got ahold of it...
they promoted him to full colonel instead.
Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam.
you needed wings to stay above it.
this sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit.
expecting us this time?
damned if I know.
Jesus
it goes back up into the truck. -What?
we gotta get all that stuff up.
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?
I bet you we can score up here.
check out the bikes, Lance.
yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!
that's a good one. -Yeah, Sukiyaki.
Yeah, man. This is something.
please! -This must be the guy.
right over there.
sergeant.
three drums of diesel fuel, PBR five
come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
one hour. That's all. What do you want?
can I get some Panama Red? -Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.
sergeant? -Destination?
I don't have no destination.
I can't do a goddamn thing without a destination.
Sarge? Sarge? -I need a destination!
I can't do a thing about it with a destination.
these guys are with me. Destination's classifiIed.
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence.
okay, right, sir. Hey, listen, it's a real big night.
eight bucks for that -Hey!
all right. Damn.
just give him some fuel. -You got it.
dog starts barking. -Hey, listen, Captain.
I'm really sorry about tonight.
it's really bad around here.
just take this over to the man at the supply desk and you got it.
would you guys like some seats--some press box seats for the show?
the show out here.
bunnies, bunnies. -Playboy bunnies?
you got it. You gonna be here?
Hey, listen, Captain, on the house.
no hard feelings, huh?
how ya doin'out there?
I said, how ya doin'out there?
wanna say hello to you from all of us up here...
to all of you out there who work...
so goddamn hard in Operation Brute Force!
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!
and the marines! And the sailors!
we wanna let you know that we're proud of you!
we know how tough and how hard it's been.
to prove it we're gonna give you entertainment you're gonna like.
miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.
miss May, Miss Terri Teray! Yeah!
and the playmate of the year,
miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!
come on! -What's the matter?
grease my gun!
I'm ready to powwow, baby!
you're cute. I like you.
I'm here, baby! I'm here!
Yeah!
you fucking bitch! -Take it off!
take it off!
Hey, lover! You want us to come over!
I sure do! -Sign my centerfold!
sign my centerfold!
come on, baby!
start her up. Hey!
get out of my way!
will you sign these? Come on!
let's go!
let's go! Hurry!
so long!
Charlie didn't get much USO.
he was dug in too deep or moving too fast.
his idea of great R and R was cold rice and a little rat meat.
he had only two ways home
death or victory.
no wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass.
the war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns...
who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away.
Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out.
I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December, Chief.
Hey, Clean, look at that. She was here, man.
I even wrote to the cunt.
she didn't write me back.
you can really get hung up on these broads, man...
just like that cat in the delta.
Yeah, you better believe it. -What cat?
the one that went up for murder.
he was an army sergeant.
remember? This cat, man--He really dug his Playboy, man.
I mean like this guy
when the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man.
look at these beautiful fuckin' jugs, man!
Yeah, so anyway, he was workin' ARVN patrols.
one of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants and shit
one day the gook took his magazine and wouldn't give it back.
he said, Give me my magazine back.
gook say, You shut up.
I have you court-martialed.
typical fuckin' ARVN. -Yeah!
then the gook starts to go too far.
chef. Take the wheel.
this dude started to stick pinholes in the lady's tits.
he started sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold.
the sergeant said, You better not do that to her.
you leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl.
don't do her like that. "
gook say " Fuck you " in Vietnamese. -Damn.
the sergeant couldn't handle it no more.
he just picked up his iron...
flipped it to rock and roll and
gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.
it blew his ass clean off of the dock.
there wasn't no more lieutenant that day.
that was it for his ass.
they burn him for it? -The sergeant? Yeah, man.
they stuck his ass in the LBJ.
it's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothin'.
fuckin' ARVN, man.
they should have killed the fuck.
should have given the fucker a Silver Star.
bummer for the gook though, ain't it?
good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist ZackJohnson on AMVN.
it's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon right now, also very humid.
we have an important message for all GI's...
who are living off base from the mayor of Saigon.
he'd like you to hang your laundry up indoors instead of on the windowsills.
the mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful.
now here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam who's all alone out there with the 1 st Battalion, 35th Infantry...
and dedicated by the fire team to their groovy CO.
the Rolling Stones, " Satisfaction. " -All right!
watch out, Clean!
get down, Bubba!
hang on, Lance!
get down, Bubba!
tell 'em you did it, Lance.
all right!
look out, Lance!
commitment and Counterinsurgency...
by cononel Walt E. kurtz
as long as our officers and troops perform...
tours of duty limited to one year...
they will remain dilettantes in war and tourists in Vietnam.
as long as cold beer, hot food, rockand roll...
and all the other amenities remain the expected norm...

with a fourth of our present force. "
shit. Chicken time.
you ain't shittin', bro. They're motherfuckin'.
who is that? －What's going on?
is that you, Lazzaro?

I got it! Get outta there!
Yeah! I got it! I got it! I got it!
Lance, get down!

the camp started falling apart.

man like a god and follow every order, however ridiculous.
they lost him.
he was gone.
nothing but rumors and random intelligence...
mostly from captured VC.

he and his men were playing hit-and-run all the way into Cambodia.
I know what I'm doin'.
I'm goin' to the White House to have dinner...
with the president of the United States.
that's where I'm goin'.
