xiangzi belonged to the happy ones. The bustle in the streets, the calls of the vendors, the hope of bonus money and tips, the new year holiday and the visions of good food filled him with thrilled anticipation like a child.
xiangzi bought a cup of tea from him and briefly recounted his woes.
xiangzi collected his bedding and just as he walked out of the gate, a torrent of abuse broke out in the courtyard behind him.
xiangzi could not reply. He felt as if years had passed since last he saw her, and there was a ball of fire blocking his chest.
xiangzi couldn't bear to listen to this drivel.
xiangzi decided that his first fare must be a well-dressed gentleman, on no account a woman, and the destination should be qianmen gate or the dongan market.
xiangzi did not reply but waited quietly for him to fight back.
xiangzi didn't particularly like the concubine, simply considering her a provider of tips.
xiangzi didn't smoke, but this time he felt he couldn't refuse. He took a cigarette and started to puff.
xiangzi didn't wait for her to finish but staggered out.
xiangzi feared coming into this yard, and even more going into his own rooms.
xiangzi felt as if choked by a gust of wind and swallowed several times.
xiangzi felt like hailing that expanse of red light for it was as if he hadn't seen the sun since the soldiers seized him. His head bowed, his heart flied with curses, he had forgotten the sum, moon and slay.
xiangzi flushed as crimson as the painted eggs distributed by the parents of a new-born child.
xiangzi flushed red as if his face were on fire. He knew there was trouble ahead.
xiangzi followed him into the courtyard where he saw four camels.
xiangzi glanced at old cheng as if he were handing wang er over to him. He picked up his bedding-roll.
xiangzi glared at him with flaming eyes.
xiangzi gradually found out what had happened to harmony yard. Fourth master liu had sold some of the rickshaws, the rest he had turned over to another well-known rickshaw owner in the west city.
xiangzi had remained silent all along, standing there woodenly.
xiangzi hadn't noticed the old man's expression. He had no time for such trivia.
xiangzi knew he would not be told to leave after the meal, but he chose to eat with the others.
xiangzi knew that lack of rain and news of war boosted the price of grain;
xiangzi looked himself over and began to feel the pain. Both his knees and his right elbow were cut.
xiangzi lowered his head, not daring to look right or left, his heart thumping against his ribs.
xiangzi plied his trade as usual, not considering the rumours an excuse for taking time off.
xiangzi purposely took his time, waiting until the cyclist was a good distance away before picking up the shafts again. "Confound him!" He swore.
xiangzi ran his rickshaw straight back to harmony yard.
xiangzi remembered mr. cao's instructions.
xiangzi said nothing, he was already past caring.
xiangzi sat on his bed.
xiangzi seemed to have even forgot-ten how to smile. He kept wiping his face with a little towel.
xiangzi sensed something wrong, but still didn't take it to heart.

xiangzi squatted a long time outside the door, waiting for them.
of everyone who died in those woods.
xiangzi stood stock-still in the doorway watching the old man and the boy with that dilapidated rickshaw of theirs.
xiangzi stood there, straight as a ramrod. As usual, he could think of nothing to say.
xiangzi wanted to get things clear.
xiangzi was indeed rather like a tree, sturdy, silent yet full of life.
