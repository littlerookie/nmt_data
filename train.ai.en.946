okay, let's begin.
judge Robert Parks, emergency on-call justice, presiding over plaintiff request for declaratory judgment on medical procedure...
r-h-l-h-s.
an emergency injunction preventing nonpayment by insurance company life state. Mr. Harper.
uh, your honor, we're asking for a delay of eight hours.
our lead attorney was caught unaware by this emergency motion.
your honor, this surgery needs to happen now.
life State's strategy is to run down the clock.
they have no defense, so they want to make your ruling irrelevant.
in three days time, my client's baby could be dead.
objection.
your client's fetus.
well, thank you, Mr. Harper.
I'm sure we'll all feel much better with that distinction.
this is an emergency court.
you get your attorney in here, or you start arguing for yourself.
do you understand?
I do.
the wheels on the bus go round and round.
round and round, round and round.
the wheels on the bus go round and round.
all through the town.
the people on the bus go up and down.
up and down, up and down.
the people on the bus go up and down.
all through the town.
the horn on the bus goes beep-beep-beep, beep-beep-beep, beep-beep-beep...
Mrs. Florrick.
ms. Nyholm.
do you mind giving me a hand here, please?
Oh, boy or girl?
girl.
unlucky you caught judge Parks, huh?
that's not going to turn out too well, is it?
why do you say that?
well, he's a pro-business constructionist who never met an insurance company he didn't like.
isn't that right?
Yes, it is, little baby.
it is right. - eh, pro-business and pro-life.
Ah, that's what you're hanging your hat on, huh?
I know a lot of pro-business pro-lifers, and somehow business always seems to win the upper hand.
do you mind?
here we go!
this is an ultrasound of the fetus' heart taken six weeks ago, during the 18th week of pregnancy.
you're referring to my client, Mrs. Willoughby's baby?
Yes.
as you can see here, the right ventricle is enlarged, the left side severely underdeveloped.
it's hypoplastic left heart syndrome
a uniformly fatal condition without in utero surgical intervention.
and this is surgery performed on the baby's heart
excuse me, the fetus' heart - while still in the womb?
Yes.
it needs to happen by the 24th week, two days from now.
and the surgery is scheduled for...
well, 20 minutes ago.
I had specialists flying in from los angeles, Miami and Boston.
until yesterday, when the insurance company pulled the plug?
objection, Your Honor.
life State did not pull the plug.
ms. Nyholm, you're late.
Yes, Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick buttonholed me in the parking lot.
fetal surgery is simply not a covered procedure per the terms of the Willoughbys' policy.
this is an experimental treatment.
and we are not in the business of...
my apologies, Your Honor.
I found myself without child care.
and with a handy prop.
excuse me?
that is cynicism of the ugliest order, counselor.
your honor, I know Mr. Gardner hasn't enjoyed the special bond a mother has with her child...
Oh, come on.
Llife State just wanted to put a pretty face on an ugly stratagem, and...
Mr. Gardner, do you have any further questions?
not at this time, Your Honor.
ms. Nyholm?
Yes, Your Honor, but she really needs to be fed.
this is a stall tactic, Your Honor.
Yes, it's a stall tactic for me to give my child sustenance.
your Honor, we don't have time to delay this for even five minutes, let alone...
she really is very hungry.
if we could just reconvene in an hour?
ten minutes.
daily walking close to thee let it be dear lord, let it be...
there, that's when Mr. Daley stopped me.
he said, "no, reverend, not that one."
so, your new boy's in trouble?
why do you say that?
you phoned me.
my guess is, florrick is polling well everywhere except african-americans.
african-american women.
he's polling ten points behind last election.
we think it's about crime.
well, it's about cheating.
and you want me to help kick off some kind of forgiveness tour, right?
prayer breakfast.
a few gracious words about God's forgiveness, Peter's true repentance.
Hey, it worked for clinton.
no, no, Bill had Hillary out there doing press.
uh, it's not an option.
um, Mrs. Florrick is a very private person.
look, I like Peter.
he's been good for us.
but the lord in christ church belongs to my son now.
you get his blessing and I'll happily pray with Peter.
it's just, it's so bizarre.
we have insurance for exactly this type of thing, and now we could sell off everything and still not cover this.
we're staying calm, keeping positive.
right.
it was a good day today.
he started kicking again today.
any closer to a name?
not yet, we...
we wanna make sure we're all fine first.
how did you get a judge in here on saturday?
you didn't count on that, did you?
so, this isn't really your baby, is it?
what's her name?
bite me.
is that Dutch?
excuse me, we're back in session.
how many times have you performed this fetal heart surgery procedure, Dr. Hall?
I'm not a pediatric cardiologist.
Yes, I understand that but that would mean none, right?
no criticism implied, ma'am, i just want to be clear on all the facts.
Yes, that's correct.
in fact, how many times has fetal surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome been attempted in illinois, do you know?
I must confess I don't.
four times.
now, Dr. Hall, how is that not an experimental procedure?
objection.
it's not within her expertise.
sustained.
I can see why Mr. Gardner wouldn't want you to answer that.
no further questions.
ms. Nyholm, how long will you need to prepare your defense?
well, Your Honor, I'm tempted to ask for one week, except...
24 hours.
except 24 hours is what i mean.
thank you, pastor.
we feel peter needs spiritual guidance.
he's paid his debt to society, but we know that there's a greater debt.
so, you want to use me.
Yes.
Why?
it looks good if I'm embraced by you.
our polling numbers are below par with African-American women.
so, is that the latest scheme, Mr. Florrick?
brutal honesty?
son...
no, wait, it's okay.
look, reverend, I know that you think I'm just a...
shallow, narcissistic politician, and you know what?
I agree with you.
but I have been in prison for the last eight months.
I've been away from my family, from my life.
I've seen everything i've built turn to dust.
until one day you found the glorious words of the gospels.
can we have a minute alone?
I'm not a photo op.
I know you're not.
I won't be charmed, finessed, yupped.
you've done wrong.
I know I have.
your marriage is in trouble.
I know you think it isn't, but it is.
because you don't acknowledge true repentance.
tell me what i have to do.
you love your wife?
Yes.
does she love you?
I don't know.
you are sleeping in separate rooms?
Yeah.
do you believe Jesus died for your sins?
I don't know what that means.
do you want to know what it means?
no.
please, God, make me good, but just not yet.
you're afraid of change.
but your wife won't love you, she won't return to your bed till you change.
so...
do you want to change?
Nyholm's not budging.
life State's worried about setting a precedent that could cost them millions in the class action.
where are you and Cary?
we're still working up a list of experimental procedures Life State's covered in the past.
good.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just don't like investing myself emotionally.
I know.
we have a fighting chance here.
get some sleep.
okay, thanks.
Bye.
Jesus, we pray you to embrace your lost sheep,
guide him back to your flock.
show him your mercy.
let him know that his sins will be forgiven.
merciful Jesus, restore to him the joy of your salvation, and uphold him by your generous spirit.
even if you don't sympathize with my clients, even if you don't sympathize with my clients, this won't play well in the press.
Oh, come on, Will.
how bad do you think you can make the insurance company look these days?
Hey.
but we can pay for the operation.
high six figures, right?
Mr. Harper can cover that with the stroke of a pen.
if?
you drop the class action suit.
that's right, Will, let's talk like adults here.
you're not in this to help some sweet couple have their first baby.
Where's the paycheck in that?
you know, there were 68 other sweet couples who were denied coverage by life state.
trial lawyers, defenders of the just and the innocent.
just think about it.
drop your class action nuisance suit, and we'll find the money to save that baby.
can you grab my bags, please?
how's the Life State?
Patti Nyholm offered to pay, if we drop our class action.
Ouch, might as well close up shop.
Yep, starting to make sense why she's fighting it tooth and nail, though.
you might think about going the political route.
get the state insurance commissioner to apply some pressure.
he won't get involved; there's no political upside.
he might for a friend.
are you...
no, not me.
Mr. Florrick.
it's a side benefit of having her on staff, right?
use her connections.
his connections.
her connection to his connections?
is that a problem?
no.
I just think there are better ways to go.
so, good, the reverend's on board.
Yes, he's seeing Peter twice a week, and I'll petition the court for monitored trips back and forth to the lord in christ church.
and I'll slip an item to Avedon and Palish, and we'll get a couple of photographers there.
Yeah, you might want to hold off on that.
Why?
Peter doesn't want it.
he - why?
pastor Isaiah.
what's going on?
exactly what we wanted.
spiritual guidance.
what we wanted was a photo op.
Yeah, and we'll get that, eventually.
and in the meantime?
Peter's listening.
I'm not liking the sound of this.
religion's like a drug.
in small doses, it's curative.
in large, it's addictive.
talk to him.
he won't listen to me.
not Peter, the reverend Isaiah.
pastor Isaiah, and I'll tell you what, why don't you talk to him?
you'd be better.
Eli, aren't we living in a post-racial world these days?
okay, i'll do it.
won't this be entertaining.
I am incredibly sympathetic.
I can't even imagine the stress kate must be under.
but a risky, medically-unnecessary surgery is not the answer.
to be fair, you are a claims manager, not a medical professional.
Yes, uh...
but that's why we hire independent medical consultants, uh, retired doctors who are contracted to evaluate medical records and make a determination.
and what was the consultant's determination here?
a fetal surgery is not considered medically necessary when there is a tried and tested alternative, as is waiting until the baby's born.
no further questions, Ms. Pomeroy.
I know this was hard for you, and your sympathy really goes out to this couple.
so...
as soon as Kate has the baby
if she has the baby
you'll pay for the surgery, correct?
Yes, that's correct.
it's covered for a baby that's born?
right.
in utero surgery for Spina Bifida, 23 weeks.
so as far as Life State's concerned, this isn't a baby.
this isn't someone who qualifies for surgery.
this, according to your denial letter, is a pregnancy complication not covered.
is that correct?
objection, relevance.
overruled - policy language is relevant here.
unfortunately, that's right.
no further questions.
I'm a new mother myself, so I know how exciting and overwhelming it is and how important it is to guard your health.
ms. Nyholm, I get it.
you're a mom; we're all impressed.
can we move this along now?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mrs. Willoughby, do you understand the risks of a surgery that would involve cutting you open to reach your uterus?
cutting open your baby to insert a balloon catheter into its heart?
to save his life.
you forgot that part.
his life, that's right.
because this is a life we're talking about.
isn't it?
Mrs. Willoughby, what do you do for a living?
uh, I'm-I'm a community organizer.
which involves?
uh, grass roots efforts towards social change protecting civil rights.
in fact, you spent the last five years advocating for abortion rights, didn't you?
I lobbied for women's reproductive rights, in general.
you spent years fighting to ensure that a fetus at this stage could be aborted legally.
fighting to ensure that there was a choice.
and now that you're the one with a fetus at 23 weeks, you argue that it should be considered a baby...
in fact, it is a life worth saving...
in fact, your baby deserves the most cutting-edge, extreme life-saving measures possible.
Yes.
this is my child.
of course, he deserves anything.
and you can live with that hypocrisy?
Objection!
badgering the witness.
sustained.
how you doing?
I don't know.
I guess I've been better.
you did well.
they're worried Patti pushed it too far.
it's hard to read this judge, but I think we have a fighting chance.
and if we lose?
then what?
what do you mean?
what are our options?
let's not worry about that now.
Dr. Forrest, dial 113, please.
Dr. Forrest, please dial 113.
we can't drop our class action.
I know.
there are 68 other couples just like them.
Yes, it's about the firm, too.
but we can't drop the class action.
I understand.
don't you like this?
being a lawyer.
isn't it fun?
it has its moments.
I can't tell which way he'll rule.
hold on, hold on.
we're good.
sorry about that. Damn it.
your Honor, I'm sorry.
I need to raise a quick issue, if you don't mind.
I'm ready to rule, Ms. Nyholm.
Yes, Your Honor, but everything about this emergency court has been rushed and unorthodox, and something has been brought to our attention within the last ten minutes.
what's she doing?
quickly, Ms. Nyholm.
all this litigation has led to a higher level of scrutiny of the willoughbys' policy application, and I'm afraid we've uncovered some deal-changing issues.
Oh, come on.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
when we began these proceedings, I didn't expect Mr. Willoughby to misrepresent his medical history.
what?
sit down, sir.
sit down.
this misrepresentation gives Life State the right to rescind his policy entirely.
your Honor, this is not a buffet.
ms. Nyholm can't pick one attack and then failing that, try another.
your Honor, I would argue that this goes to the heart of contract law.
even if you are prone to rule in the plaintiffs' favor, at the very minimum, you should hear whether there was a legal contract to begin with.
your Honor, I want to remind you that we are racing against a ticking clock.
ms. Nyholm is counting on this surgery being irrelevant by the time you decide.
Mr. Gardner, urgency is not its own rationale.
a just decision cannot, will not be rushed.
you still have two days for the surgery.
ms. Nyholm, prepare your witnesses and your exhibits, and I will hear on this matter tomorrow.
you understand what you're doing here, Patti?
you take away their coverage altogether, that baby gets no surgery at all.
that's on you, Will.
you have another option.
drop the class action.
speak to you today about the path, God's path.
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life when we walk with him, our souls are right with him.
I never realized you rehearsed these sermons.
thought they just came down from the holy spirit, like a dove.
Hello, Mr. Gold.
Reverend Isaiah.
so, I believe I've been crimping your style.
Peter did wrong.
he's sorry.
he apologized to his wife he apologized to his constituents.
he would now like to apologize to his god.
and I approve.
no, sir. reverend, you're doing more than approving.
you're trying to take advantage of a man who's feeling raw about his mistakes.
I love that word, "mistakes."
sleeping with a prostitute is just like a dropped zero on a tax form.
you're young, sir.
youth tends to see things in black and white.
things are black and white.
so, let's put things into black and white for you, then.
four point two grams of crack cocaine
you were just short of intent to distribute.
and you want to what?
tell my congregation?
shock them?
you're gonna have to look for something new.
I could give you my license plate number.
Reverend, Peter could make a difference...
in people's lives.
he needs to make a difference in his life first.
he has.
no.
I have to go.
I've enjoyed this.
let's stay in touch.
Mr. Willoughby, Life State is saying that this question wasn't answered accurately.
can you see that?
Yes.
you were to check the box if you had circulatory problems, including but not limited to chest pain, heart murmur, palpitations, phlebitis.
do you know what that is?
I don't.
funny, I don't either.
do you?
objection.
Mrs. Florrick.
sustained.
Mr. Willoughby, why didn't you check box number two?
well, because it says circulatory disorders'problems.
the doctor said the heart palpitations were nothing to worry about.
they weren't a problem.
so, I just thought I was being accurate.
thank you.
let's chalk question two up to a misunderstanding.
but if someone outright lied on an application regarding a relevant health issue, that would be grounds for voiding their policy, correct?
Yes.
but I didn't.
question 10.
during the past 12 months, has any applicant smoked cigarettes, pipes, cigars, or used chewing tobacco?
you answered no, correct?
correct.
Yes, good.
now, last fall, did you go on a fishing trip with a friend, with the lovely name of Brent Boyle?
objection.
relevance.
I'm getting there.
overruled.
the witness may answer the question.
Yes.
Yes, you did go on such a fishing trip?
good.
here.
here's you.
and...
here.
looks like you're smoking a cigarette there.
that was...
it was only one.
I've never been a regular smoker.
the question wasn't whether you were a regular smoker.
Yes, but I didn't think...
your Honor, the question was simple.
Mr. Willoughby's answer was a lie.
laying aside my sympathy for the plaintiff, what this boils down to is a simple matter of contract law.
Mr. Willoughby's material omission gives Life State the right to render this contract null and void.
plaintiff's motion is denied.
policy recision stands.
your Honor, I would ask for an emergency motion to reconsider.
sending Kate Willoughby home without this surgery is a death sentence for her child.
I'm following the law, Mr. Gardner.
not agreeing with it.
motion to reconsider denied.
okay, let's make a deal.
you just lost at craps, Will.
you don't make a deal with the croupier;
you just go home.
well, if i were you, Patti, I'd still want to be certain.
Oh, come on.
right.
good-bye.
I blew it.
no, Jesse blew it, and he knows it.
no, Nyholm's right. I...
I played craps with that kid's life.
will, you did everything.
will, you listen.
I know you did everything.
are we...
damn it.
no, no, no.
damn it.
God.
this is not a good idea.
Oh, hi.
just, uh, forgot my laptop.
good night.
night.
you just missed her.
Oh, thanks.
Hello?
Mr. Gardner?
please, we need your help.
Hey.
you all right?
let's go to the bedroom.
no, here.
we're hoping it's Braxton Hicks, but they still won't...
excuse me...
this hospital is required by law to treat patients in an emergency, regardless of insurance coverage.
we are just sorting out the paperwork, sir.
for an hour?
if a doctor is not examining her within three minutes, I will personally call the police and file a malpractice suit against you.
personally.
don't make an enemy out of a lawyer, lady.
Hi.
Hi.
that was...
great last night.
are you becoming religious?
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm becoming.
but I want to change.
no.
no, really...
change.
must be Eli...
so I better change.
Hi.
will, you, you can't...
it's not about...
it's about work.
for wor...
what?
your cell phone's off.
I just spent all night at the hospital with the Willoughbys.
I need to talk to Peter.
no.
Hey, Peter.
been a long time.
a very long time.
come on in.
good to see you.
you, too, man.
Yeah.
the surgery's tomorrow.
we've exhausted all legal channels and...
you didn't have to do that.
how can I help?
a company like Life State is motivated by two things - money and the fear of a revoked license.
and I know you and the commissioner go back a long way.
give me something concrete, and i'll make sure he gets his eyes on it right away.
thank you.
so, um...
how's Alicia doing at work?
good.
great, really.
I'm sorry about all the late hours.
Oh, hey, a lawyer's life?
I get it.
AAnyway...
I hear the retrial's going well.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
our state's attorney seems intent on retrying me, no matter how thin the evidence.
well, at least you're home.
at least I'm home.
so, Alicia, we need to reconvene this morning with Kalinda.
supposedly, she's got something on Life State.
Oh, what do you know.
Kalinda works at Stern Lockhart.
small world.
that's right.
she used to work for you.
so, I'll see you later.
Yup.
don't be late.
he's great.
I don't remember him being so nice.
Yeah.
please tell me you have something good.
well, I'm not sure what it is.
and my method for obtaining it is not exactly legitimate.
illegitimate as in "I can't use it in court," or...
we can go to jail?
I downloaded firmware and cloned Patti Nyholm's phone, in order to intercept her text messages.
what?
you wanted something.
I got you something.
okay, let's hear it.
well, apart from an alarming flirtation with a guy that mows the lawn, she's hiding Pamela.
Pamela who?
my guess is Pamela Pomeroy, that claims manager.
I think she's ready to flip.
she was on the stand.
she didn't say a thing.
Yeah.
they're on to Pam.
they turn Pam, we lose everything, my guess is, Pomeroy went one too many times to bat for Life State.
she's ready to spill.
you really cloned Nyholm's cell?
Yeah.
you do that again, don't tell me.
no problem.
I should talk to her.
Mr. Gardner?
yeah?
did Alicia get her laptop last night?
after you left, she came back looking for her laptop in your office.
just making sure she got it.
Yeah, yeah, she got it.
okay, let's go see Pamela.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm sorry about this morning.
you don't have to be sorry.
can I come in?
Yeah.
so, you're my boss.
I know.
I'm a junior associate.
I know.
you came into my office.
last night after you left, you came back to my office - why?
help me out, please?
I mean, we had...
we had...
whatever we had at Georgetown, and I just...
but you came back.
I know.
it was wrong.
because you're married?
okay, I have a suggestion.
I like work.
I like working here.
I don't want everywhere I go to be a mess.
we're not going to talk about this.
we're not going to say any more, okay?
good.
we're going to go to dinner in one week's time, and we'll talk then.
please don't end up hating me.
I need this job.
I mean, I'm...
I - I, I mean that...
I'm sorry...
it's fine.
we have bad timing.
we've always had bad timing.
excuse me, Ms. Pomeroy?
Oh, you're, uh...
Yes.
do you have a moment, Ms. Pomeroy?
I - I don't think we should be talking.
we just need a minute.
why are they trying to hide you?
I - I have no idea what you're talking about.
uh, I have to go.
please!
the Willoughbys...
their child is dying.
I saw it in your eyes.
you want to help.
please help.
you saw it in my eyes?
Really?
what powers of perception.
what do you see in my eyes now?
I'm going home now. - but...
Nyholm said she was trying to hide Pam.
you guys are really clueless.
she's not trying to hide it.
it's closed already.
"it"?
it's an acronym.
Pam policy application management.
it's an off-site group of life state employees who look for application mistakes, but only after expensive claims were filed.
it's organized post-claims underwriting.
Yup.
it's illegal in some states, and legislation in Illinois is on the horizon.
which explains why they shut it and tried to bury it.
Yeah, but we got it with an illegally-obtained text.
it's fruit of the poisonous tree.
we can't use it.
we can use it.
we just can't use it in court.
not a good time.
sure, it is.
suit yourself.
is that...
Yeah.
this case is over, will.
no.
life State is going to quietly reinstate Kate's coverage in time for the surgery this afternoon...
or your client's going to be dealing with a hell of a lot more than one upset family.
here I go trembling again.
we know about Pam.
and do you know who's sitting outside your office right now?
jonathan Dobbs, the insurance commissioner.
is there a man in the waiting room?
describe him.
how'd you do that?
he's waiting to hear about Pam.
an entire department dedicated to finding specious ways to rescind policies when patients need them most.
do you remember when you asked me how bad I can make an insurance company look?
really bad, Patti.
drop your license bad.
you got this illegally.
you must have, or we'd be in court.
you want to take it to a judge and sort it out there, or just cover Kate?
thank you.
I, um...
I failed her.
just one puff of a cigarette, and I saw it all going wrong.
you have kids?
no.
I think it changes everything.
doesn't it?
it does.
is he...
I can't tell if he's smiling.
is he smiling?
I don't know.
take off your mask.
you realize if one whiff of Pam surfaces, we can trace back to your firm?
I know what a confidentiality agreement is, Patti.
and you can't use it in the class action suit.
we'll find another way.
I doubt that.
how'd you find it?
find what?
who's pam?
you two make a cute couple.
Hey.
how'd it go?
the insurance guys?
jonathan showed up, right?
Oh, right.
Yeah, he did.
it worked.
our client got the surgery, and it went well.
all right...
how was your day?
good.
I spent more time with pastor Isaiah.
he wants us to go to church.
well, that would be interesting.
it's getting late.
good night, Peter.
could the name be Kozko?
if you accidentally cross the line...
then you'll receive a telephone call from our monitoring center.
you need to answer that call within five rings or you're terminated from the program. Do you understand?
I understand.
it's over.
what is? - Us. Me caring.
me actually thinking that you're changing.
I am changing.
no, you're not. - They're fighting?
you want to think you are so you can go back to what you did before.
then help me.
mom's leaving?
I don't know.
help me.
if you're right, help me.
they're going to divorce.
no. - We don't know that.
mom just left. She just walked out the door.
we're going to be okay.
I was liking having Dad back, too.
just like before.
dad?
I just moved the reservation at the National Cafe in 40 minutes.
if that's all right.
it's all right. - You sure?
Yeah, I'm trying to be spontaneous these days.
okay. I'll see you then.
okay?
okay.
Peter, no! You...
I love you.
you can't be down here!
please. Don't leave me.
you have to be upstairs, Peter.
I can't lose you. I can't lose Zach. I can't lose Grace.
tell him it's an emergency!
Peter's going to be arrested in 20 minutes.
dad?
dad?
is everything all right?
my mom's getting complaints from the tenants.
it's the police. No, Zach, don't!
we have five rings or Dad's going to prison.
dad has to answer.
we'll say we're getting him.
that's four rings.
Hello? - This is Sergeant Thacker at HMD Center.
please identify yourself.
this is Grace. Grace Florrick.
we've received an alert there's been an unauthorized breach of the perimeter.
please put Mr. Florrick on the line.
that's my dad.
please put your father on the line.
I need to speak to him now.
okay, hold one minute. I'm going to go get him.
say he's in the shower. I'll go downstairs.
no.
dad, there's someone here for you.
he's in the shower. Um... he'll be out in a minute.
he's not there, is he?
no, he's here. He's-he's just in the shower.
he's rushing.
this is my last request for you to put Mr. Florrick on the phone.
dad, they need you right now.
they're going to take Dad.
watch out.
what do we do, Peter?
you're going back to jail.
I know.
Hello?
what happened? - It's my arm.
where? - I was skateboarding.
no, he's here. My dad's right here.
no, it was a skateboard.
it's okay. I got you. - No, he never left.
my dad's with my brother. He's bleeding.
grace, what are you doing?
keeping Dad.
so, that's what happened?
your brother made this move on his board...
all right, well, I appreciate... Thank you.
now I'm going to talk to you. It's Amal, right?
Amal. Yeah.
now, when you first arrived at the apartment, did you, uh, see Mr. Florrick?
Yes. - You're sure.
Yeah, he just, uh, got out of the shower.
now, your mother is the building manager?
Yes, uh, on the fourth floor.
I came up because, um, we got some complaints about the noise.
do you have some I. D?
Yeah, I probably have something. What do you need?
a current driver's license...
what were you thinking?
they were going to arrest Dad.
hello.
these are beautiful bookcases. - Are you with the police?
Mrs. Florrick, your daughter said the HMD sent a false positive, because your son was...
attempting a crooked grind and slammed into it.
sheriff, she's just a kid.
meaning what? She's lying?
uh, Sheriff, if I could interrupt.
good evening, first of all.
I'm going to ask Mr. and Mrs. Florrick not to answer any more of your questions.
uh, Mrs. Florrick, I'm Daniel Golden's partner.
and I ask that all questions be directed through me.
well, I could take Mr. Florrick in right now.
Yes, and where was Mr. Florrick when you arrived?
he failed to answer his HMD call.
due to the fact that his son was injured in a skateboarding accident.
again, where did you find Mr. Florrick?
excuse me, we received a warning that the perimeter had been breached.
due to a malfunctioning unit.
you found Mr. Florrick in his apartment.
cause he returned.
or never left.
Hey, who installed the HMD unit?
who installed it? I did. Why?
do you know what an OHS clip is?
an itty-bitty wire clip about this big.
it's required by the sheriff's department whenever an HMD is installed.
one clip for every one foot of wire.
do you know how much wire you installed?
who are you?
Elsbeth Tascioni. Hi.
you installed, by my eye, three feet of wire.
and do you know how many OHS clips you installed? None.
people don't like permanent fixtures in their houses.
well, that's very kind of you, Sheriff.
but it's still an infraction.
and unfortunately in this case, your loose wire is what tripped up young Mr. Florrick's skateboard causing his injury.
thank you. - You know, I wish I had an eye with color.
I'm always mixing oranges with reds.
is that you? - Is that...
incoming call Will - Will. - Hey. Is everything all right?
I'm so sorry. It's been such chaos around here.
it's okay. We'll talk tomorrow.
Hey, Sadie. Sorry for flaking out on you tonight.
no, my emergency fell through.
do you want to...
what favor?
what's wrong?
we're not going toward your floor.
what we have here is a rather large collection of items with your name on them.
you don't need to be nervous.
I'm your friend here.
they aren't mine. Really.
look, the sheriff ran your I. D. last night, Amal.
it triggered a red flag warning to me.
you see, there are a dozen credit cards, driver's licenses, passports with your name on 'em.
you know how that could've happened?
no. I don't.
were you paid to let someone use your identity?
Simran? - Are you certain?
is everything okay?
Yes, Alicia. Um, they just...
they have a few questions, um, for Amal.
it's about work.
do you... do you want me to do anything?
Oh. No. I don't know.
they said it would only take a minute, and so...
amal isn't in trouble.
you don't want to get in trouble, Amal. - No.
then why aren't you answering honestly?
I am answering honestly.
I don't know anything about this. I swear.
excuse me, gentlemen.
is Amal a suspect here?
because if so, you probably should read him his rights.
not a suspect... at this time.
we're asking a few questions. That's all.
Mrs. Florrick, isn't it? - Y- Yes.
you just accused him of being dishonest, and warned him he could get into trouble.
we're trying to ascertain his connection to an identity theft ring.
Simran, I think you should invite these gentlemen to leave.
we only need a few more minutes, Mrs. Verma.
if you don't want them here, you can ask them to leave, Simran.
gentlemen...
would you please leave?
my guess is they're just fishing.
look, I-I didn't do anything wrong, Mom. I swear.
I have to rush to work, but if you need anything, just call me, okay?
thank you, Alicia. - Of course.
does he have a moment?
actually, Will's out today.
he's... Oh, court?
no, volunteer work. All very last minute. He's out until Thursday.
Thursday?
so this is the favor?
for an old college chum. Very hot.
that's right. You have a thing for judges.
my first husband.
it's not half bad.
I wonder if I can get it fitted.
objection, Your Honor.
uh, calls for speculation.
the question asks Mr. Hunter to guess the answer rather than rely on facts.
Yes, that is the definition of speculation.
congratulations, Mr. Bigelow.
too bad I didn't do that.
sustained. - Exception.
noted, and when you go to mock trial appeal court, Ms. Cabrini, you can argue it there.
now, Mr. Hunter, I just want to understand the sequence of events.
you say that you saw my clients entering the cottage?
Yes. I was hunting in the forest when I heard a scream.
actually, you said "screams"?
Yes. ScreaMs.
and you said that you recognize those as belonging to the witch?
that's right. She lives in that gingerbread house.
so you just assumed that it was the witch's scream coming from inside the oven?
no. I recognized her voice.
incoming call alicia
so you have the power to distinguish between screams?
well, how about this one?
Objection! Your Honor!
ms. Cabrini! Sustained.
sustained, what? What's the objection?
badgering the witness.
you're arguing the prosecution's case, Your Honor.
excuse me, Ms. Cabrini.
I am not doing anything of the sort.
okay, let's leave it there. We'll pick it up tomorrow.
now, remember, even though this is a mock trial,
I do not want the jury discussing the case.
this is not a joke.
grades depend on its outcome.
and let's thank our judge, Mr. Will Gardner, for volunteering his time.
anyone else have a problem with the argument on page 18, mid-page?
you mean mine?
well, I didn't know it was yours.
I just find the citing's a bit off topic.
our clients are suing because their video game was stolen. That's all.
well, I'm here to listen, Cary, so why don't you tell me how my citings could be more on topic?
well... - One minute.
what's up? - Nothing. Neighborhood kids need help.
want me to get rid of them? - No, thank you.
billable hours, Alicia.
Cary's got his eye on the prize.
billable hours. - Thanks, Kalinda.
sorry, but we didn't know who else to contact.
that's okay. What happened?
they came for her an hour after you left.
they can't just take her away. Can they?
this was about me. They want me.
wait. Who came?
mom was going to the grocery store when this van...
these men got out and took her.
all we got was this phone number to call.
the line's been busy all day.
us Immigration
I thought your... Your mom's a citizen, right?
she spent $8, 000 on an immigration attorney who ripped her off and never filed for a green card, so she just gave up.
she's lived here for 27 years.
look, I have some names of immigration attorneys.
I'll get them for you.
thank you. - Thanks.
this way.
you're such a pushover.
I am not. I'm responsible.
no, I mean, I'm responsible for the Feds questioning him.
you're not responsible for everything bad in the world, Alicia.
where would they put her, the mom?
Broadview, McHenry Detention, general population at Cook County.
they make it a shell game.
but you could find her?
so you're the pushover, I'm the one who actually does the work?
no, no. It's fine. I can do it. Thank you.
mama?
Thanks. - Hey, my good deed for the year.
thank you, Mrs. Florrick.
please stand on the lines.
all rise, please.
the Honorable Judge Gordon Tomlin presiding.
I'm Judge Tomlin, presiding immigration judge via closed-circuit in Miami.
currently presiding over Cook County I. C.E.
are we ready, Miss...? - Bow. Yes, Your Honor.
I.C.E. is petitioning the court for summary judgment on Simran Verma's immediate removal and deportation to her native India.
your Honor, I'm sorry, but Simran has lived in America for 27 years.
too loud for the microphone, Ma'am.
Mrs. Verma has demonstrated good moral character.
she supports herself as a building manager, and she would be subjected to undue hardship if she were separated from her American-born children.
she more than qualifies for an adjusted residence status.
your Honor, I have a copy of Simran's application for a driver's license from the DMV.
on the application, she checked the voter registration box, thus making a false claim of citizenship, a federal offense.
your Honor, these forms are confusing and often filled out by rote.
the application clearly states that making a false claim is a serious federal offense.
Mrs. Verma should be permanently inadmissible as a citizen of the United States.
your Honor, her ties to America are very strong.
too close for the microphone again, ma'am.
summary judgment approved.
Mrs. Verma's deportation is approved. Next case.
Oh, Your Honor... But, Your...
what? What is happening?
is that it? Are they taking her back? - Mrs. Florrick? What happened?
wait. Wait. What has happened? - Mom.
you can't take her! Mom! Mom!
this is absurd. I am not a criminal.
Mr. Belkin!
so that's what this is about.
I won't confirm or deny, but, ma'am, it would have been better if you'd let us question him.
what do you want?
identity theft is a multi-billion dollar burr in the side of America.
all I ask is that Amal do his patriotic duty, help us bring down the major player.
he does that, you stop his mother's deportation?
I'll put in a good word.
that's the problem with good deeds...
they multiply.
what? I got it cleaned.
so this is why you dropped all of your appointments for the next two days?
Hey, I'm doing good for the community, and I'm keeping an eye on law school prospects.
and of course, there's always your good friend, Professor Sadie Hart.
you know what?
I'm not a bad judge.
what's the case?
the mock trial? It's a...
a murder. Yeah.
double defendants. Brother and sister.
and the victim?
a homeowner.
it's a fairy tale, isn't it?
hansel and Gretel.
but it brings up some interesting legal issues: trespass, castle law.
eating other people's houses?
Oh, Will, Alicia dropped by yesterday wanting a few minutes.
okay. Got it. Thanks.
we are going to have to deal with that, too. - That?
the junior associate position.
Cary and Alicia.
we said six months; it's been seven.
it's bad economy to drop somebody.
are you getting cold feet?
next week. - Next week.
they think your work is a front for selling stolen I. D.'s.
the travel agency?
they traced the false I. D.'s to that address.
have you seen anything there?
no.
but... I haven't wanted to see.
he'll get our mom a visa...
this Belkin... if Amal cooperates?
Yeah. The Feds want you to download three files.
it's mom. You have to. Amal.
I know.
you don't know what these guys are capable of.
I don't know why you think you're the only one...!
you seem less than sympathetic.
their mother's illegal.
with 27 years in this country.
27 years of being illegal.
I would've thought you would've been more sympathetic.
Why? Because my parents immigrated legally, - My mistake. - So, who are they?
big case. Can't talk about it.
yeah?
they're the video game clients, right?
can't talk about it.
well, do you need some help with it?
because I know the gamer world.
lucky you.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back right away.
I'm on this mock trial thing at DePaul.
Oh, that's all right.
I was just making sure everything was all right after the other night.
one minute.
everything is all right.
you sure?
because...
I'm sorry.
Alicia, you don't have any reason to be sorry.
I was pushing a situation that was wrong to push.
you weren't. - I was.
don't worry.
we're good.
we're going to be good.
Yes, just three files. That's all they want.
you won't be alone. Look.
they don't want to arrest them;
they want to do this quietly, in and out.
did you tell them about the Pujari brothers?
belkin knows that your bosses are potentially dangerous.
he also knows you did nothing wrong.
he'll keep his promise to release my mother?
we have a deal in writing.
Amal, take a deep breath, think about your mom.
uh, do you have any direct flights to Agra?
calm down.
when have you ever know someone to calm down when you tell them to calm down?
could you turn the screen toward me so I can see the direct flights to Agra, please?
Oh, found it.
download it.
they're exiting the building.
hold it, hold it.
federal agents! Hold it right there.
put your hands where I can see them.
get agents in there and sweep the place.
call it in, all right?
sure, what do you need?
what am I doing wrong?
what are you...
I didn't know you were doing anything wrong.
there were 38 objections and I lost 34, so what am I doing?
well, at the moment, what you're doing is playing the ref.
tell me, teach me.
you want me to tell you why I'm deciding against you?
Yes, half of those objections could have gone either way.
that's not true. Where are you from, Chicago?
is this important for the lesson?
it's important for a life lesson.
judge asks you a question, you answer.
you don't come back with another question. - Why?
because court is a lesson in humility, and you just came back with another question.
so you're deciding against me because I'm not humble?
no, I'm deciding against you because you're wrong on the law, but life is not the classroom and judges decide things all the time based on a whim...
which attorneys they like, they trust.
Oh, so you don't like me?
Oh, my God, you're like a three-year-old with the questions.
I said the textbooks go out the window when you're in court.
charm and finesse is just as important as logic.
okay, so I need to work on my charm?
to succeed in court, you need to work on everything.
okay.
then what?
let's see. Cross-examination.
what?
Hey, I'm a big gamer.
in college they used to call me the thumb-meister.
grand Theft Auto, you know.
Thanks, man.
what do you mean you're not releasing Simran? We had a deal.
right, we had a deal. Your boy blew it apart.
what? Amal got you the data.
he also warned the Pujari brothers to get out.
no, he didn't. - Someone sent them a text.
well, you still got what you wanted. You made your arrest.
I didn't want to bust the brothers. I wanted their buyer.
we only arrested them so they wouldn't take off on us.
now the whole operation is scattered.
because of your client, eight months of work is shot to hell.
and Simran, what about Simran? - Deportation.
Oh, come on, this... - Ma'am, you know what this is? It's the law.
she broke the law and now she's paying the consequences.
Mrs. Florrick.
gerald Kozko?
Yes, I know who you are.
I only need a minute.
I'm leaving now.
please, I...
I want you to give your husband a message.
I want you to tell him that my son had nothing to do with this.
I was the one that made the deal with Childs.
I'm cleaning up my mess.
my son is completely... - No.
Mrs. Florrick... - No, that's it,
Mr. Kozko, I'm not your go-between.
you want to give Peter a message, pick up the phone.
Mrs. Florrick, you don't realize...
Yes, and I don't want to realize.
I've had enough of everything.
you don't understand; I don't have anybody.
you know what? I don't care.
I don't know you. You don't know me.
help me.
okay, family meeting.
we're going to settle some things.
from now on...
we tell each other the truth.
no more lying to the sheriff about skateboards or to me about secret packages. Okay?
Where's Dad? - This isn't about him; this is about us.
so I'll go first.
I've been very angry with your father.
I almost walked out a few nights ago, but we've decided to give it a go.
in separate rooms?
Yes, and you two will just have to deal with that.
you're almost grown-ups.
you'll realize that adults have complicated emotions.
Zach, your turn.
my turn?
what's on your mind?
mom, it's really late.
I'm seeing Becca.
okay, this is progress.
and I will be honest in telling you that I don't like Becca, but I think you should bring her to dinner so we can have a proper introduction.
okay.
who's Will?
will Gardner... my boss.
I heard you talking to him on the phone a week ago.
you were whispering at night.
he's my boss...
and we used to know each other in college and we thought that we were attracted to each other, but it's over.
what's over?
thinking that we were attracted to each other.
but he's still your boss.
Yes. - So what happened?
actually, that's all I intend to share right now.
your father and I are agreeing to make this work and I have agreed to trust you again, so good night.
sweet dreams.
it's getting to her.
definitely.
Yeah, it's me.
you're working late.
Yeah, on this good deed someone saddled me with.
belkin won't budge; I already went to him.
they weren't after the Pujari brothers.
they were after their buyers.
now they're looking for the go-between.
Really?
then maybe we have something to negotiate with.
okay, go ahead.
did you threaten Kozko? - Yes.
downstairs at Lord of Christ?
Yes.
do you want to know why?
he was wearing a wire.
he made a deal with Childs for immunity.
and why'd he do that?
I don't know why.
because you steered investigations away from him?
everything, Peter.
I want to know everything.
everybody has friends, everybody has enemies.
I did things for Kozko as a friend.
that were illegal?
no, but...
the line gets fuzzy.
who paid for this?
I did.
then why isn't the receipt in your name?
I went to the store, Peter.
I wanted to get you something nice...
I didn't have the money.
Kozko lent me the money.
and that was illegal.
that was... fuzzy.
look, Alicia, I want to run again, but I want to do it right this time, nothing fuzzy.
and I only want to do it if you're with me.
if we're in this together.
these? No, I don't know who handles these.
they look like they were mounted in a necklace or something.
well, your best bet with jewelry is not here.
thanks for your time, anyway.
the box is another matter. - You recognize the box?
it's a camphor box. It's sold down the street at the Mundy bazaar.
Thanks.
all rise. The Honorable Will Gardner presiding.
is the defense ready with its first witness?
Yes, Your Honor. I just have a quick motion first.
proceed.
title 28, USC-455A provides:
a judge must recuse himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality may be reasonably questioned.
the defense asks that you do so now.
recuse yourself.
ms. Cabrini, we've been through this.
I'm not biased against you.
I agree. You're biased for me.
Really? You're gonna have to explain that one.
well, yesterday after court, you advised me on how to cross-examine and question witnesses for this trial, clearly demonstrating bias.
you asked for advice.
united States v. Burger.
if a reasonable person knowing the relevant facts would harbor doubts about a judge's impartiality, he must recuse himself.
motion denied, Ms. Cabrini.
why don't we take a break for a minute, Mr. Gardner.
Sadie, she set me up.
okay, I think we're in an awkward area here, Your Honor.
what? I didn't do anything wrong.
thanks so much for your help.
you believe her?
I believe I'll take the robe.
Yep. Men and 25-year-olds.
same thing happened to my ex.
what are you talking about?
we think these gems, they're Kashmir blue sapphires, were used in payment for the I. D.'s.
if we can find the smuggler, we can find the buyer.
and if you find the buyer?
then Belkin will get you a visa.
but they're deporting me on the next transport.
I know. My associates are still running these sapphires down.
I... I don't know anybody in India, Mrs. Florrick.
my life... my life is here.
I know.
can I see Amal and Frida before I go?
I'm... I'm working on it.
please, um...
Mrs. Florrick, you have the key to my apartment, no?
I need a few items, and then...
and the sentimental things.
Yes, of course I will.
and will you tell Amal it's no his fault, mm?
thank you.
Cary? Hi. Can you hear me?
okay, I need you bring it to me. - What, the gems?
no, the box. I need you to bring the box.
all right, all right, but I'm just driving around in circles here...
little India's a nightmare.
I'll e-mail them to your car, the directions.
all right. Hold on, that's my other line. Hello?
Hi, Cary. Are you near Kalinda?
no. I'm looking for her right now.
and ha-ha, very funny, it's not about gaming.
wait, hold on a second.
all right, I got it. What do you need?
tell her I think Simran's involved.
the sapphires used to pay the Pujari brothers,
I found the same jewels in her apartment.
damn it. All right, well, I'll tell her.
Namaste.
what did he say?
I don't know. I don't speak Hindi.
what do you mean, you don't Hindi?
I didn't grow up in India.
do you speak English? - No, no.
Oh, seriously, Kalinda, where is your cultural identity?
uh, I'm looking for a box like this.
Ah...
Ah, thank you.
I don't think Simran was involved.
what? You just get a hunch?
no. Better.
employee of the month
so, your back?
I'm back.
uh, did, uh, Hansel and Gretel get off?
I don't know. I recused myself.
you recused yourself from the prosecution of Hansel and Gretel?
what, were you dating Gretel?
for a few weeks. Bad time.
what's that?
Oh, that? A personal case, immigration.
I'm letting them run with it.
excuse me. Someone to see you, Will...
giada Cabrini. No appointment.
send her in.
long lost love?
no. A student.
this should be interesting.
your Honor.
ms. Cabrini.
I thought I'd bring you some gingerbread.
so, did you win?
no, actually.
to be honest, I think they did it.
very clever, getting me recused.
Yes, well, you were biased.
and you're here because...?
I want to take you to dinner.
no hard feelings.
how old are you?
25. How old are you?
not 25.
well, I won't hold that against you.
come on, I'll buy.
let me think about it.
okay.
I'll wait.
you're wasting your time.
deportations fall under I. C.E.
the U. S. Attorney's Office can't countermand their order of removal.
we can still authorize an S-1 visa.
a snitch visa? For whom, the mother?
you want the Pujaris' contact with organized crime, right?
well, if Simran gets deported, so does the name.
I seem to be missing something.
I'm open to a new proffer, but I'll need to see a statement.
I sacrificed.
now it's your turn.
I was the courier between the Pujari brothers and their buyers.
they offered me a lot of money to do it.
they threatened me if I told anyone.
so I kept it from my mother...
and Amal.
I was the one who texted the brothers you were watching.
okay. That's enough.
you get the rest when you get the visa.
give me a few hours.
she'll get jail time, you know.
she knows.
thank you. - No problem.
that's nice.
isn't that nice?
no big case, no video games...
we just did some good here.
actually, Alicia and I did some good.
you just drove the car.
Oh, that is not fair. I'm the one who found...
what is it? - ...today a car believed...
was found abandoned... - Hold on.
I'm gonna play it back.
patience.
and now back to our headline news.
Chicago real estate developer Gerald Kozko is missing, in fear to have taken his own life.
authorities fear Mr. Kozko may have committed suicide by jumping from the Des Plaines River Bridge just outside the Loop.
police found his abandoned car parked midway across the bridge earlier today.
there are no witnesses, and no body has yet been recovered, but police boats and divers continue to search...
mom! Dinner!
Hey, babe, we're just sitting down.
now I've worked hard to earn forgiveness both from my family .
and from you, the citizens of Chicago.
that work is ong ...and will continue, - Hello? Will? - but I'm confident...
huge press conference. Is everything all right?
that it will continue to make me a better husband - Wait. I can't hear you.
hold on.
a better public official.
I just need to say it.
we've been up and down, back and forth, and I... - Will...
No!
show me the plan.
the what? - The plan. I get the romance. I need a plan.
but it's unnecessary, because Chicago...
poetry's easy.
it's the parent-teacher conferences that are hard.
Alicia, come on.
I have to go now. - Come on.
I believe I am that change, and I believe that I am that individual.
thank you very much.
thanks for doing this. It'll be right here for you.
I'm away from my phone at the moment, so please leave a message.
I just wanted to say...
you all know my wife...
look, you're right.
I don't have a plan.
it's wrong. I'm your boss. You're my employee.
let's just... drop this. Okay?
now that hasn't been the focus of the current tate's attorney's office.
instead, S.A. Glenn Childs...
I'm away from my phone at the moment, so please leave a message.
no. You know what? I'm not just dropping this.
you want to know my plan? My plan is, I love you, okay?
I've probably loved you... ever since Georgetown.
so phone me.
I'll meet you anywhere, and we will make a plan.
if none of this makes sense to you, just ignore it.
no embarrassment, nothing.
we'll just go back to where things stood.
no. You know what? I'm not just dropping this.
you want to know my plan? My plan is, I love you, okay?
so phone me. I'll meet you anywhere.
if none of this makes sense to you, just ignore it.
cook County State's Attorney will put justice before politics, public safety before personal vendetta.
one week Later
thank you for coming out this morning.
I have a short statement I'd like to read.
first, please let me apologize to my wife, friends, staff, and fellow Coloradans for the shadow placed over them by these accusations.
I did nothing wrong, but I can understand how my actions over the last two years have been misinterpreted.
so let me say without equivocation, I have always been faithful to my wife.
not only... - Yeah?
I'm headed out.
the Police Union speech? - Yeah.
did you have a chance to read it? - It's good.
the opening story... - Not funny enough?
cut it.
listen, this... - It's not us, Peter.
you know, I have an hour today. I thought,
thought I'd drop by court and watch you work.
that's okay. - No, I really want to.
it's a status hearing. Maybe another time. - Okay.
the charges and gossip now being bandied about in the press and through anonymous blogs...
am I boring you?
excuse me, Your Honor?
I asked if I'm boring you.
I saw you check your watch, and I thought I might be holding you up.
no, Your Honor. We have a staff meeting in an hour.
I was checking to make sure I was on time, and I am.
I'm so glad.
was that a smile, Miss Long?
no, Your Honor. Food in my teeth.
okay, so, I love when prosecutors and defense attorneys come together and find agreement, but your client's restitution should also include court costs,
Mrs. Florrick, so if you don't mind, you two can revise this while I handle a pretrial motion.
Tommy... - Let me guess. He hates women?
no. He just checks his Google alerts daily.
you have more than he does.
so it looks like you're off the hook.
I'm...?
press has a new scandal.
it's my right, Your Honor!
you are one day away from trial. We have a jury.
I will not slow this process down!
it's my right to represent myself. - You are not a lawyer, sir.
Yeah, and I wasn't an Alaskan fisherman till I stepped on my first trawler.
I wasn't a hacker till I broke my first code... - This is not a game.
you are being accused of murder.
it's a murder the government committed.
the Pentagon murdered my business partner and set me up for it.
Why? Because we posted top secret Pentagon video on our Web site!
and I don't care if you don't believe me, Your Honor.
it's my right under the 6th and 14th Amendment to fire my attorney, represent myself.
I will not allow this court to become your personal soapbox, Mr. Salle.
and I won't watch this trail turned over on appeal, you understand?
you are getting a baby-sitter. That is not open for discussion.
Mrs. Florrick?
are you a member of the Capital Litigation Bar?
excuse me, Your Honor?
are you a member of the Illinois Capital Litigation Bar?
Yes. - Good. Congratulations.
I'm appointing you standby counselor to Mr. Salle.
I'm sorry, but I have the Murphy/Gomes suit going to trial next week.
who's the judge?
judge Fullerton.
good. My court takes precedence.
trial starts tomorrow at 9: 00.
no. Your Honor, I can't! You can't do this.
actually, ma'am, I can.
your Honor, I just want to point out... - Don't you start!
we are going to trial on this tomorrow.
anything from you, Mr. Brody?
the People are content.
of course, they are. - Tommy, next case.
and his name just kept coming up.
I go to Louisiana to sign up fishermen for a BP class action, and I find that half of them have already been signed up by a small boutique D. C.firm.
imagine my frustration.
so I had to look up this Derrick Bond.
and I was surprised to find one of the most gentlemanly young lawyers that I have ever met.
anyway, I couldn't be happier about this merger.
will and I could not be happier.
thank you, Diane. Thank you, Will.
I know that there some unfamiliar faces around, so please, everyone, introduce yourselves and communicate through...
we're moving towards a paperless office.
we bring lobbyists, you bring corporate.
we bring D. C.you bring Chicago.
with our current president's ties to your city, we mean more together than apart.
now, let me turn things over to Bachelor number 16.
I'm not going to hear the end of that, am I? - No.
a few updates.
we got a continuance on BP, so we'll need a few of you to join us on the diocese depos.
and the Murphy/Gomes suit got an expedited start date, so we'll need that team to kick into high gear.
so let's get going. - Will?
good job.
not me, you.
its like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
as long as we're the ones snatching.
how long do I have to wait before I get my season tickets back?
a polite week.
happy days.
just so you know, I'll be playing this disgruntled.
the excluded partner.
well, maybe we can shake something else loose contractually.
Oh, Derrick, we were just talking about you.
that went well, didn't it?
it did. It did. A good group.
very good. Will was just talking the merger. He had a few concerns.
nothing big. Just about office space. An equitable division.
an hour ago, I resigned as State's Attorney of Cook County.
another year, another scandal.
another woman standing by her man... .
are you kidding?
you'd rather have your husband sleep with a prostitute?!
if the choice was that or fall in love with someone, yeah.
one's just sex. The other's...
what happened to your couch?
why, hello, Mr. Gold.
it's gone. Redecorating.
I'm taking this very personally.
Mr. Gold.
do you know what a tracker is?
do I know what a tracker is?
no.
an unpaid political operative who tracks the opposition candidate, trying to catch him off-guard with a question or a comment in order to tape the embarrassing encounter for free viral negative campaigning.
result of a tracker.
and I imagine this will all come around to me.
the events of this morning. This congressional scandal.
you are back in the news.
and Childs has people tracking you.
you know this?
well, I know what I would do, and I just flip it to know what my opponent will do.
okay.
so, if anyone approaches you with a flip phone or an oddly shouted comment, the best thing to do is smile and move on.
they will try to follow you.
probably a college student, often working in twos.
again, smile and move on.
I'm trying to keep you out of this, but it's modern politics.
wives are no longer off-limits.
everything good here?
everything's good here.
anything else?
no.
I'm good. If you're good.
I'm good.
you needed something?
Yes.
judge Matchick made me standby counsel on a pro se case starting tomorrow.
you told him about the Murphy/Gomes date?
I did.
he didn't seem to care. - Yeah, that sounds like Matchick.
he's still proud of a walk-on line he had in The Dark Knight.
okay, I'll have Shawn take over.
I think I can do both.
no, it's okay. We're not starved for personnel anymore.
merger going well?
it is. - I'm glad.
don't sweat the drug cases.
gag 'em and bag 'em.
five to ten.
on page two, you'll find a summary of outstanding continuances.
we may not have enough copies, so share at the back.
let's not go continuance crazy, okay, folks?
unless you're up against Goldstein and Michaels.
then all continuances are welcome.
Matan, what's up with the pro se?
guy's running a unicorn defense.
he killed his business partner for the money, and now he's trying to suggest it was some sort of Pentagon conspiracy.
judge Matchick saddled him with a wrangler.
should be entertaining.
anyone on break, sit in. Anything else?
okay. Let's get the bad guys.
why would Matchick choose Florrick?
happenstance. She was there on a settlement.
take Cary as second chair.
sir, it was nothing. It's okay.
it's happenstance.
it's an election year.
there's no such thing as happenstance.
Matchick supports Peter.
he's pushing his wife into a prominent position.
I want you to take second chair.
matan will bring you up to speed, okay? - You got it.
you're up to speed.
he was bleeding profusely from the neck and chest.
there also appeared to have been a struggle before the shooting.
I attempted CPR, but the victim died at the scene.
now, Detective, at the crime scene, you also found shell casings, isn't that correct?
objection.
on what grounds?
on the grounds of foundation.
Mr. Salle, he was about to tell us the foundation.
may I have a ruling, Your Honor? - Overruled.
exception.
Mr. Salle, you know that doesn't mean anything?
I'm preserving your bias for the record.
dear God. Mrs. Florrick?
please, Mr. Salle, let me argue for you.
I'm very good at it.
it's not about being good, Mrs. Florrick.
in a fight between a man being paid and a man fighting for his life, who would you bet on?
I'm betting on myself.
don't turn your back to the jury.
these nine millimeter casings you found at the scene?
they are consistent with a Russian-made Makarov semiautomatic.
a very rare handgun? - That's correct.
and who owned such a handgun? - The defendant.
and when you arrested him, did he say what had happened to his gun?
he said it was missing.
no more questions.
now, Detective, didn't I say it had been stolen?
you did.
you said agents from the government had stolen it.
did I say why? - Objection.
actually, you know what? Forget it.
let the jury hear this.
you said the government was upset because you had uploaded a leaked video to your Web site.
was it this video that played on my Web site, OpenSourceFind. com?
this video is of a U. S.predator drone assassinating an unarmed man in Afghanistan.
Yes, I believe that's correct.
and did I give you the name of someone to talk to?
someone who could point to the real killer at the Pentagon?
you said to speak to one of your volunteers:
a woman named Onya who'd acquired the video from a leaker.
did you speak to Onya, this volunteer?
okay, I think I'll object at this point, Your Honor.
sustained. Mr. Salle, I already told you.
the government is not on trial here. You are.
well, maybe they should be.
do I think the U. S. government killed his business partner?
no.
but I've got nothing else to go on.
look, we're trying to be more thrifty with Kalinda's hours, so I can't have her chasing phantoms.
just do the best you can with what you've got.
what's your strategy?
my strategy?
well, there's this one juror.
I think he agrees with Salle.
every time the judge overrules us, you can tell he wants to hear more.
he thinks we're being censored.
quite a risk. Trying to win over one juror.
I only need one for a deadlock.
we can give her half a day.
to hunt down Pentagon assassins?
to find sand to throw in the prosecutor's case.
Kalinda? - What's up?
Alicia needs help fingering the Pentagon for a murder.
how long do I have?
the afternoon.
sorry.
what? - See this month's Chicago Magazine?
sixteenth most eligible bachelor.
we're fine, Kalinda.
Yeah, that looked fine.
did you see the photo spread?
will in a swimsuit. - He wasn't in a swimsuit.
so you saw it, then?
talk to him.
he doesn't want to. He told me.
he wants to drop it. - Yeah. In voice mail.
anything said in voice mail doesn't count.
Salle doesn't know who leaked the pentagon video.
he was insulated from the leaker by a go-between activist named Onya, no last name.
her last known address.
but she's paranoid, so she moves around a lot to avoid detection.
well, the good thing about amateur paranoids is, they always leave something behind.
talk to him.
life is short.
the most honest part of the body, which you wouldn't guess, is the feet.
the feet? You're kidding. - No. Look at Mrs. Timmerman's feet.
they are pointing away from her husband, almost as if to flee.
now, let's look at Mrs. Clinton's feet.
they are facing toward her husband.
this is a marriage that can recover.
now let's look at Alicia Florrick's feet.
one foot is toward her husband.
one foot is away from her husband.
it just signifies ambivalence.
it's not going away.
that's the problem.
it's not my scandal.
thank you. It's Colorado.
that's like going to the moon.
every time they show him, they show you.
every time they show his wife, they show Alicia.
so change the subject. - Right, to Glenn Child's divorce.
no, Eli. No.
Peter, you can't keep leaving all your missiles in the silo.
I'm not leaving anything. This isn't about being a good guy.
we go after his family, then he's going to come after mine.
he's coming after yours, either way.
then we'll wait till he does.
in the meantime, change the subject to something positive.
what am I doing here, anyway?
get me in front of some woman's group, - so we can remind them of the mutual respect. - Peter Florrick.
get me a list of any organizations giving out an award this season.
I don't care if it's the Knitting Needlers of America.
I need a visual.
sorry.
my friend lives here and she said I could get her key.
are you...? - The landlord.
who's your friend?
Onya. - Yeah. She moved out.
right. She leave a forwarding address?
no. No.
she's a friend of yours?
Yeah. Look, the thing is, she has my extra key, and I'm locked out.
I was hoping I could get in. - there's nothing left in there.
she cleaned it out, so... - It might be shoved to the back of a drawer or something.
do you mind if I just check?
check? For your extra key?
it would really help. Please?
close the door when you're done.
thank you.
I found it in the Dumpster in the back.
no SIM card. She must have taken it when she left the apartment.
so, it's a dead end? - For the moment.
but there was somebody there just before me.
I found chipped paint under the air vent screws.
so somebody must have checked the vents after the apartment was cleaned.
Yeah. Sorry. I should have cleaned that up.
Yes. Derrick said you would be dropping by.
this is Derrick's in-house investigator, Blake, from D. C.
I picked the lock in the apartment.
found a cell phone hidden in the air vent.
it looked like the subject left in a rush.
she left this in the phone.
SIM card.
much of it's encrypted.
I can try and decipher if you want.
Yeah.
let's see what you can find.
I wouldn't mind Kalinda trying to decipher.
she's done it for me before.
Yeah. Well, why don't you work on it together?
did you ever find your extra key?
you knew who I was?
Yeah.
I wanted to see how you'd play it.
what are you, man of a thousand faces?
no. Just one.
does that flirtation bit always work for you?
Yeah.
are we going to have trouble?
no. No. As far as I'm concerned, it's your backyard, Leela.
sorry. That's not your name, is it?
it's Kalinda.
Kalinda's your name. Right.
imagine my surprise when I looked at the membership roll of the Women's Auxiliary of the Botanical Gardens and saw your name.
I was also surprised to see that the Auxiliary has not awarded a "Friend of the Auxiliary" in quite some time.
anyway, if you could talk to the auxiliary...
well, certainly, Mr. Gold.
how's the campaign going? - The campaign? It's going very well, ma'am.
thank you. Why? - no reason.
it's just that it seems like you're coming to me more than I might expect.
and how much did you expect, Mrs. Florrick?
I imagine that campaigns are very complicated things.
maybe you need... help.
what kind of help?
I think we should stay in touch.
I think we should talk regularly.
I can offer you advice and you can ask questions when you are confused.
I think that's a very good idea. Let's stay in touch.
Objection!
overruled. And ye-yes, exception, I get it.- Exception!
continue, Mr. Brody.
what other forensic evidence did you collect from the scene, ma'am?
we found partial palm prints on the Cessna door and fingerprints on the inside.
and who did those prints belong to?
the defendant.
no further questions.
have I been on that plane before?
objection, Your Honor. Beyond the scope.
sustained.
these prints of mine on the plane - that doesn't mean that I was at any time...? - Objection.
sustained.
did your investigation reveal you were on the plane...?
did your investigation reveal that I had been on the plane a week before the murder, and that could be the source of the fingerprints?
Yes.
are we finished here, Mr. Salle?
one second, Your Honor.
Mr. Salle?
miss I forgot your name.
Loren. - Loren, sorry.
what happened to the sample #48?
I don't understand the question.
you collected 48 blood samples. Isn't that correct?
no, 47 blood samples.
Yes, 47 samples according to your evidence list, and yet here on the crime scene photo, there is a 48th sample.
that's outside the designated crime scene.
so, you found blood outside the designated crime scene, and you decided not to include it?
objection, Your Honor.
this is a large hangar, and this blood sample was found by a tool kit which could have been left by any random worker.
overruled.
answer the question.
we did a preliminary blood type test of this blood sample, as we do with all our samples.
it was O-negative, not consistent with the victim.
and what is my blood type?
B-positive.
so it wasn't consistent with my blood type either.
no further questions.
I haven't said this in a while to anyone.
thank you.
Cryptbit encryption? You don't like Lasermite?
try combining Lasermite and Elcosec.
use them as binary sifters.
they'd cancel each other out.
use Lasermite for salting.
so, what did you find out about me?
some friends in D. C.said you phoned.
you have enemies.
nice-- same phone number.
there, there, there.
every night at 7: 30.
Yeah.
you recognize it.
Stan's Chicken Shack.
she's ordering takeout.
you think she would get takeout again from her new address?
Hey, Leela.
we should work together.
stop it. - What?
it's been such a difficult time for Peter and his family, and...
this award will mean so much to them.
now he needs us.
would you excuse me?
her daughter-in-law-- that's who we should get.
Oh, hello, Jackie. - Hello, Ruth.
we were just talking about your daughter-in-law.
where is Alicia?
well, as you know, she works, but my granddaughter is here-- Grace.
she's thinking of joining our cotillion.
it's so bogus, huh?
Yeah, I got dragged here.
Yeah.
you, too? - No, no, I'm... I'm working.
doing what?
you know.
so has your mom or dad said anything about this other scandal?
the one right now?
no.
they kind of just try to avoid the whole subject, you know.
they're still sleeping in separate rooms?
who's that?
Steven-- he's in film school.
so your parents aren't sleeping together anymore, right?
and you used to do accounting work for the victim, Mr. Kimball?
Yes, and Mr. Salle.
I'm sorry, Miss Derbeken, could you please move your hand?
Yes, sorry.
in fact, you traveled with Mr. Kimball, didn't you?
Yes, our job required moving around a lot, so I stayed in the same hotel.
and you saw firsthand a dispute between Mr. Kimball and the defendant about their Web site?
Yes, I did.
in fact, could you describe the letter you saw sent by Mr. Salle to the victim a week before the murder?
object now. - Why?
do it. - Objection.
your Honor, this isn't hearsay.
miss Derbeken is testifying to a letter she read herself, not what was heard.
Yes, but, uh... best evidence, Your Honor.
I'm listening.
the original letter offers... - The original letter offers the best evidence, and it can't be testified to if the letter is not produced.
where is the letter?
Oh, come on.
your Honor, we can't establish motive unless we hear from her.
that's not my problem, Mr. Brody.
the objection is sustained.
miss Derbeken cannot testify to the letter.
know what I want to do if I get out?
go to law school.
he's got no case, sir.
he's still arguing a unicorn defense.
and he's beating you.
he's got no case, and he's beating you. Cary.
don't do this-- he's a first year.
I don't care if he's just out of law school.
can you beat her?
we just caught a bad break, Mr. Childs.
that's not what I asked.
can you beat her?
Yes. -You're first chair.
I don't know how long you plan to stay with us, but that's not how you endear yourself to your coworkers.
Oh, is that what this is about-- endearment?
one last thing.
how are you on partners' offices?
Diane has a corner office.
I have a partial corner with more square footage.
we could splurge for either.
one of the things we did at our old office was move the partners' offices into the core of the building and made the outside communal associate areas.
it fostered goodwill.
do you prefer an interior office?
let me think on it.
and I would like to start a partner mentorship program.
well, we already unofficially mentor associates.
I think it'll create greater goodwill if we officially mentor.
there's one more thing.
peer review.
we don't choose who to fire.
associates grade each other.
it creates community.
Yeah, like Lord of the Flies.
well, let us think on that.
are we being played in some way?
I don't see how.
I don't either.
it's making me suspicious.
Stan's Chicken Shack on 58th.
Yeah, I just phoned a minute ago for my delivery order.
I just want to check I gave you the right address.
the name's Onya.
no delivery by that name.
are you sure you have the right...?
Stan's Chicken Shack.
Yeah, I think I might have given you the wrong address.
the name's Onya.
Yeah, you got a new address?
no, I-I think I may have given you the wrong address.
what do you have?
9625 West Marshfield, Apartment 5-EE.
is that right?
Yeah, yeah, that-that's really good. Thank you, bye.
you ready to take another go at this?
what is lupus?
lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks... Objection, Your Honor.
beyond the scope.
I'm going to overrule on that.
I'd like to see where this is going.
lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's cells and tissue, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage.
how common is it?
fairly common.
it affects perhaps one out of every 1, 000 Americans.
does the defendant Mr. Salle suffer from lupus?
lupus erythematosus, yes, he does.
now, what is another odd artifact of lupus?
well, if you withdraw medication, it can change your blood type.
so Mr. Salle could have O-negative blood one week, and if he changed his medication, B-positive the next?
that is correct.
now... this blood sample that you took from a tool kit in the hangar
this blood sample that Mrs. Florrick and her mentor worked so diligently to get into evidence
did you expedite a DNA test looking for a match? - I did.
and who did it match?
Mr. Salle the defendant.
well, no further questions. The prosecution rests.
no, no, no, Vance sent me. I work with his lawyers.
I'm not Onya you're looking for...
okay, they know you're in there. Don't go back in there. Come on.
look, Vance wants to help, but he needs your help, too.
you know who shot Kimball, right?
was it the government?
what?
the Feds use strollers. They're transmitters.
they're easy to disguise.
the guy who leaked me the video?
he was afraid that Kimball was going to name him, so he killed him.
Onya, you have to testify to that.
no. No, he'll kill you. He'll kill me, too.
we can hide your identity. - No, you can't.
if you bring me into that court, I will plead the Fifth.
look at her.
like that's a real baby.
okay, then tell me the name of the leaker.
I'll take the risk.
come on. It's the least you can do for Vance.
good news is we found the leaker.
CIA analyst, Edgar Barkus.
the bad news? - He's missing.
office was cleared out a month ago.
so, what are we saying?
it is a government conspiracy?
or the Pentagon found their leaker. - Alicia?
use her.
use Onya.
I don't understand.
prosecution is winning because they're arguing a straightforward case with a straightforward motive.
your client killed over money: possession of his Web site.
you need a straightforward alternative.
jealousy.
who's jealous? - Onya.
but she'll plead the Fifth. - Right, so use her.
Onya, you're familiar with Mr. Kimball's accountant, Jeanine Derbeken?
what do you mean, familiar?
you know who she is?
Yes.
this should be interesting.
you have to go?
Yeah. Take care.
and you knew that Jeanine would often stay in Mr. Kimball's hotel room when he traveled?
no.
you didn't know that?
but you also traveled with Mr. Kimball, didn't you?
I did, yeah.
and... did you ever fight with Jeanine?
with...? No.
you never fought with Jeanine over the attentions of Mr. Kimball?
objection.
sustained.
so, Onya, the week before the murder
this is the week Mr. Kimball received the leaked video
did you and Mr. Kimball travel to Washington D. C?
it's a simple question, Onya.
did you and Mr. Kimball stay together in Washington, D.C?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
are you sure that's what you want to do?
you're pleading the Fifth?
Yes.
you're worried about relating what happened with the victim in Washington D. C?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
miss, I want to make sure I understand what you're saying.
your Honor, the witness already answered...
are you pleading the Fifth because you were involved in Mr. Kimball's murder, or because of the leaked...?
your Honor, it is not your place to ask my witness.
Yes, it is, Mrs. Florrick.
now, you are taking the Fifth...
your Honor, if you compel my witness to answer this question,
I am moving for an immediate mistrial.
denied. I'm asking a simple question...
you are not, sir!
Mrs. Florrick... - You are piercing the Fifth Amendment right.
Mr. Florrick, shut up.
no, sir.
excuse me.
as long as you are attempting to circumvent her Fifth Amendment right,
I will not shut up.
you will shut up, or be held in contempt.
then hold me in contempt, and I will refer this to the Judicial Conduct Committee for immediate action.
this court will adjourn until tomorrow morning.
I'm almost done.
what are you up to?
I saw you in court today.
yeah?
you were amazing.
Peter, I've got to... study.
Peter, I have to study.
okay.
let me.
so, let's just go at this from a different angle.
do you know of any motive Mr. Salle might have had to murder Mr. Kimball?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me.
now, are you pleading the Fifth because you were involved in the murder, or...
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me.
so, you want to follow me again?
have me do your work for you?
Nope, I have something for you.
I picked it up on my police scanner.
a kid found the murder weapon down by the river.
a Russian-made Makarov semi-automatic.
the cops have it?
they're checking it for prints right now.
my guess is, your client didn't wipe it down.
how long do we have?
I know your Chicago cops are slow, but I'd say you got few minutes.
and you still want to plead the Fifth?
I refuse to answer...
no more questions.
Mrs. Florrick?
your next witness.
defense rests, Your Honor.
what are you doing? We still have to refute the blood evidence.
defense rests.
your Honor, The People are unprepared for closing arguments.
that's unfortunate, Mr. Agos, because I am.
well, we request a five-minute recess.
no, Mr. Agos.
this trial has gone on much longer than I anticipated, and I'm tired.
so you go now, or you don't go.
and where does that leave the defense?
in tatters. Look at their witnesses.
I'm sorry.
their one witness.
your Honor, I need to interrupt.
the police have just uncovered a new piece of evidence.
Mr. Brody, you know as well as I that once the prosecution starts its closing arguments, there is no new evidence.
Yes, Your Honor, but these are extraordinary circumstances.
well, that's unfortunate, Mr. Brody.
if the jury deadlocks, you may use your extraordinary circumstances in the next trial.
the jury will ignore Mr. Brody's statements.
you may continue, Mr. Agos.
about your peer review suggestion.
we thought we could try it for one year as a pilot program. - Okay.
and we're still working on getting you a smaller office without a window.
but in the meantime, you'll have to live with this.
thank you.
you shoot the hoops?
I do.
we got an afternoon league. A few judges, lawyers.
we could use some Baltimore blood.
Oh, you can't handle some Baltimore blood.
that's how it starts.
still deliberating? - Yep.
you know, that gun they found?
the Feds have a way of making this stuff pop up right when they need it.
they're offering you five years.
they're... Who is?
the state's attorney's office. Five years, second degree.
but you're... I mean, we're not considering it.
Yes, we are. It just takes one.
Yeah, it just takes one to deadlock. - Yes.
and if the jury deadlocks, the gun is in.
a deadlock works against you.
I can say the government planted... - Oh, Vance, stop it.
you did it.
right now, you're in control.
once the jury comes in, it's out of your hands.
take the five years.
did he take it?
the five years? Yes.
it was the smart move.
I'm your new mentor.
see you tomorrow morning.
now I've worked hard to earn forgiveness both from my family .
and from you, the citizens of Chicago.
that work is ong ...and will continue, - Hello? Will? - but I'm confident...
huge press conference. Is everything all right?
that it will continue to make me a better husband - Wait. I can't hear you.
hold on.
a better public official.
I just need to say it.
we've been up and down, back and forth, and I... - Will...
No!
show me the plan.
the what? - The plan. I get the romance. I need a plan.
but it's unnecessary, because Chicago...
poetry's easy.
it's the parent-teacher conferences that are hard.
Alicia, come on.
I have to go now. - Come on.
I believe I am that change, and I believe that I am that individual.
thank you very much.
thanks for doing this. It'll be right here for you.
I'm away from my phone at the moment, so please leave a message.
I just wanted to say...
you all know my wife...
look, you're right.
I don't have a plan.
it's wrong. I'm your boss. You're my employee.
let's just... drop this. Okay?
now that hasn't been the focus of the current tate's attorney's office.
instead, S.A. Glenn Childs...
I'm away from my phone at the moment, so please leave a message.
no. You know what? I'm not just dropping this.
you want to know my plan? My plan is, I love you, okay?
I've probably loved you... ever since Georgetown.
so phone me.
I'll meet you anywhere, and we will make a plan.
if none of this makes sense to you, just ignore it.
no embarrassment, nothing.
we'll just go back to where things stood.
no. You know what? I'm not just dropping this.
you want to know my plan? My plan is, I love you, okay?
so phone me. I'll meet you anywhere.
if none of this makes sense to you, just ignore it.
cook County State's Attorney will put justice before politics, public safety before personal vendetta.
one week Later
thank you for coming out this morning.
I have a short statement I'd like to read.
first, please let me apologize to my wife, friends, staff, and fellow Coloradans for the shadow placed over them by these accusations.
I did nothing wrong, but I can understand how my actions over the last two years have been misinterpreted.
so let me say without equivocation, I have always been faithful to my wife.
not only... - Yeah?
I'm headed out.
the Police Union speech? - Yeah.
did you have a chance to read it? - It's good.
the opening story... - Not funny enough?
cut it.
listen, this... - It's not us, Peter.
you know, I have an hour today. I thought,
thought I'd drop by court and watch you work.
that's okay. - No, I really want to.
it's a status hearing. Maybe another time. - Okay.
the charges and gossip now being bandied about in the press and through anonymous blogs...
am I boring you?
excuse me, Your Honor?
I asked if I'm boring you.
I saw you check your watch, and I thought I might be holding you up.
no, Your Honor. We have a staff meeting in an hour.
I was checking to make sure I was on time, and I am.
I'm so glad.
was that a smile, Miss Long?
no, Your Honor. Food in my teeth.
okay, so, I love when prosecutors and defense attorneys come together and find agreement, but your client's restitution should also include court costs,
Mrs. Florrick, so if you don't mind, you two can revise this while I handle a pretrial motion.
Tommy... - Let me guess. He hates women?
no. He just checks his Google alerts daily.
you have more than he does.
so it looks like you're off the hook.
I'm...?
press has a new scandal.
it's my right, Your Honor!
you are one day away from trial. We have a jury.
I will not slow this process down!
it's my right to represent myself. - You are not a lawyer, sir.
Yeah, and I wasn't an Alaskan fisherman till I stepped on my first trawler.
I wasn't a hacker till I broke my first code... - This is not a game.
you are being accused of murder.
it's a murder the government committed.
the Pentagon murdered my business partner and set me up for it.
Why? Because we posted top secret Pentagon video on our Web site!
and I don't care if you don't believe me, Your Honor.
it's my right under the 6th and 14th Amendment to fire my attorney, represent myself.
I will not allow this court to become your personal soapbox, Mr. Salle.
and I won't watch this trail turned over on appeal, you understand?
you are getting a baby-sitter. That is not open for discussion.
Mrs. Florrick?
are you a member of the Capital Litigation Bar?
excuse me, Your Honor?
are you a member of the Illinois Capital Litigation Bar?
Yes. - Good. Congratulations.
I'm appointing you standby counselor to Mr. Salle.
I'm sorry, but I have the Murphy/Gomes suit going to trial next week.
who's the judge?
judge Fullerton.
good. My court takes precedence.
trial starts tomorrow at 9: 00.
no. Your Honor, I can't! You can't do this.
actually, ma'am, I can.
your Honor, I just want to point out... - Don't you start!
we are going to trial on this tomorrow.
anything from you, Mr. Brody?
the People are content.
of course, they are. - Tommy, next case.
and his name just kept coming up.
I go to Louisiana to sign up fishermen for a BP class action, and I find that half of them have already been signed up by a small boutique D. C.firm.
imagine my frustration.
so I had to look up this Derrick Bond.
and I was surprised to find one of the most gentlemanly young lawyers that I have ever met.
anyway, I couldn't be happier about this merger.
will and I could not be happier.
thank you, Diane. Thank you, Will.
I know that there some unfamiliar faces around, so please, everyone, introduce yourselves and communicate through...
we're moving towards a paperless office.
we bring lobbyists, you bring corporate.
we bring D. C.you bring Chicago.
with our current president's ties to your city, we mean more together than apart.
now, let me turn things over to Bachelor number 16.
I'm not going to hear the end of that, am I? - No.
a few updates.
we got a continuance on BP, so we'll need a few of you to join us on the diocese depos.
and the Murphy/Gomes suit got an expedited start date, so we'll need that team to kick into high gear.
so let's get going. - Will?
good job.
not me, you.
its like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
as long as we're the ones snatching.
how long do I have to wait before I get my season tickets back?
a polite week.
happy days.
just so you know, I'll be playing this disgruntled.
the excluded partner.
well, maybe we can shake something else loose contractually.
Oh, Derrick, we were just talking about you.
that went well, didn't it?
it did. It did. A good group.
very good. Will was just talking the merger. He had a few concerns.
nothing big. Just about office space. An equitable division.
an hour ago, I resigned as State's Attorney of Cook County.
another year, another scandal.
another woman standing by her man... .
are you kidding?
you'd rather have your husband sleep with a prostitute?!
if the choice was that or fall in love with someone, yeah.
one's just sex. The other's...
what happened to your couch?
why, hello, Mr. Gold.
it's gone. Redecorating.
I'm taking this very personally.
Mr. Gold.
do you know what a tracker is?
do I know what a tracker is?
no.
an unpaid political operative who tracks the opposition candidate, trying to catch him off-guard with a question or a comment in order to tape the embarrassing encounter for free viral negative campaigning.
result of a tracker.
and I imagine this will all come around to me.
the events of this morning. This congressional scandal.
you are back in the news.
and Childs has people tracking you.
you know this?
well, I know what I would do, and I just flip it to know what my opponent will do.
okay.
so, if anyone approaches you with a flip phone or an oddly shouted comment, the best thing to do is smile and move on.
they will try to follow you.
probably a college student, often working in twos.
again, smile and move on.
I'm trying to keep you out of this, but it's modern politics.
wives are no longer off-limits.
everything good here?
everything's good here.
anything else?
no.
I'm good. If you're good.
I'm good.
you needed something?
Yes.
judge Matchick made me standby counsel on a pro se case starting tomorrow.
you told him about the Murphy/Gomes date?
I did.
he didn't seem to care. - Yeah, that sounds like Matchick.
he's still proud of a walk-on line he had in The Dark Knight.
okay, I'll have Shawn take over.
I think I can do both.
no, it's okay. We're not starved for personnel anymore.
merger going well?
it is. - I'm glad.
don't sweat the drug cases.
gag 'em and bag 'em.
five to ten.
on page two, you'll find a summary of outstanding continuances.
we may not have enough copies, so share at the back.
let's not go continuance crazy, okay, folks?
unless you're up against Goldstein and Michaels.
then all continuances are welcome.
Matan, what's up with the pro se?
guy's running a unicorn defense.
he killed his business partner for the money, and now he's trying to suggest it was some sort of Pentagon conspiracy.
judge Matchick saddled him with a wrangler.
should be entertaining.
anyone on break, sit in. Anything else?
okay. Let's get the bad guys.
why would Matchick choose Florrick?
happenstance. She was there on a settlement.
take Cary as second chair.
sir, it was nothing. It's okay.
it's happenstance.
it's an election year.
there's no such thing as happenstance.
Matchick supports Peter.
he's pushing his wife into a prominent position.
I want you to take second chair.
matan will bring you up to speed, okay? - You got it.
you're up to speed.
he was bleeding profusely from the neck and chest.
there also appeared to have been a struggle before the shooting.
I attempted CPR, but the victim died at the scene.
now, Detective, at the crime scene, you also found shell casings, isn't that correct?
objection.
on what grounds?
on the grounds of foundation.
Mr. Salle, he was about to tell us the foundation.
may I have a ruling, Your Honor? - Overruled.
exception.
Mr. Salle, you know that doesn't mean anything?
I'm preserving your bias for the record.
dear God. Mrs. Florrick?
please, Mr. Salle, let me argue for you.
I'm very good at it.
it's not about being good, Mrs. Florrick.
in a fight between a man being paid and a man fighting for his life, who would you bet on?
I'm betting on myself.
don't turn your back to the jury.
these nine millimeter casings you found at the scene?
they are consistent with a Russian-made Makarov semiautomatic.
a very rare handgun? - That's correct.
and who owned such a handgun? - The defendant.
and when you arrested him, did he say what had happened to his gun?
he said it was missing.
no more questions.
now, Detective, didn't I say it had been stolen?
you did.
you said agents from the government had stolen it.
did I say why? - Objection.
actually, you know what? Forget it.
let the jury hear this.
you said the government was upset because you had uploaded a leaked video to your Web site.
was it this video that played on my Web site, OpenSourceFind. com?
this video is of a U. S.predator drone assassinating an unarmed man in Afghanistan.
Yes, I believe that's correct.
and did I give you the name of someone to talk to?
someone who could point to the real killer at the Pentagon?
you said to speak to one of your volunteers:
a woman named Onya who'd acquired the video from a leaker.
did you speak to Onya, this volunteer?
okay, I think I'll object at this point, Your Honor.
sustained. Mr. Salle, I already told you.
the government is not on trial here. You are.
well, maybe they should be.
do I think the U. S. government killed his business partner?
no.
but I've got nothing else to go on.
look, we're trying to be more thrifty with Kalinda's hours, so I can't have her chasing phantoms.
just do the best you can with what you've got.
what's your strategy?
my strategy?
well, there's this one juror.
I think he agrees with Salle.
every time the judge overrules us, you can tell he wants to hear more.
he thinks we're being censored.
quite a risk. Trying to win over one juror.
I only need one for a deadlock.
we can give her half a day.
to hunt down Pentagon assassins?
to find sand to throw in the prosecutor's case.
Kalinda? - What's up?
Alicia needs help fingering the Pentagon for a murder.
how long do I have?
the afternoon.
sorry.
what? - See this month's Chicago Magazine?
sixteenth most eligible bachelor.
we're fine, Kalinda.
Yeah, that looked fine.
did you see the photo spread?
will in a swimsuit. - He wasn't in a swimsuit.
so you saw it, then?
talk to him.
he doesn't want to. He told me.
he wants to drop it. - Yeah. In voice mail.
anything said in voice mail doesn't count.
Salle doesn't know who leaked the pentagon video.
he was insulated from the leaker by a go-between activist named Onya, no last name.
her last known address.
but she's paranoid, so she moves around a lot to avoid detection.
well, the good thing about amateur paranoids is, they always leave something behind.
talk to him.
life is short.
the most honest part of the body, which you wouldn't guess, is the feet.
the feet? You're kidding. - No. Look at Mrs. Timmerman's feet.
they are pointing away from her husband, almost as if to flee.
now, let's look at Mrs. Clinton's feet.
they are facing toward her husband.
this is a marriage that can recover.
now let's look at Alicia Florrick's feet.
one foot is toward her husband.
one foot is away from her husband.
it just signifies ambivalence.
it's not going away.
that's the problem.
it's not my scandal.
thank you. It's Colorado.
that's like going to the moon.
every time they show him, they show you.
every time they show his wife, they show Alicia.
so change the subject. - Right, to Glenn Child's divorce.
no, Eli. No.
Peter, you can't keep leaving all your missiles in the silo.
I'm not leaving anything. This isn't about being a good guy.
we go after his family, then he's going to come after mine.
he's coming after yours, either way.
then we'll wait till he does.
in the meantime, change the subject to something positive.
what am I doing here, anyway?
get me in front of some woman's group, - so we can remind them of the mutual respect. - Peter Florrick.
get me a list of any organizations giving out an award this season.
I don't care if it's the Knitting Needlers of America.
I need a visual.
sorry.
my friend lives here and she said I could get her key.
are you...? - The landlord.
who's your friend?
Onya. - Yeah. She moved out.
right. She leave a forwarding address?
no. No.
she's a friend of yours?
Yeah. Look, the thing is, she has my extra key, and I'm locked out.
I was hoping I could get in. - there's nothing left in there.
she cleaned it out, so... - It might be shoved to the back of a drawer or something.
do you mind if I just check?
check? For your extra key?
it would really help. Please?
close the door when you're done.
thank you.
I found it in the Dumpster in the back.
no SIM card. She must have taken it when she left the apartment.
so, it's a dead end? - For the moment.
but there was somebody there just before me.
I found chipped paint under the air vent screws.
so somebody must have checked the vents after the apartment was cleaned.
Yeah. Sorry. I should have cleaned that up.
Yes. Derrick said you would be dropping by.
this is Derrick's in-house investigator, Blake, from D. C.
I picked the lock in the apartment.
found a cell phone hidden in the air vent.
it looked like the subject left in a rush.
she left this in the phone.
SIM card.
much of it's encrypted.
I can try and decipher if you want.
Yeah.
let's see what you can find.
I wouldn't mind Kalinda trying to decipher.
she's done it for me before.
Yeah. Well, why don't you work on it together?
did you ever find your extra key?
you knew who I was?
Yeah.
I wanted to see how you'd play it.
what are you, man of a thousand faces?
no. Just one.
does that flirtation bit always work for you?
Yeah.
are we going to have trouble?
no. No. As far as I'm concerned, it's your backyard, Leela.
sorry. That's not your name, is it?
it's Kalinda.
Kalinda's your name. Right.
imagine my surprise when I looked at the membership roll of the Women's Auxiliary of the Botanical Gardens and saw your name.
I was also surprised to see that the Auxiliary has not awarded a "Friend of the Auxiliary" in quite some time.
anyway, if you could talk to the auxiliary...
well, certainly, Mr. Gold.
how's the campaign going? - The campaign? It's going very well, ma'am.
thank you. Why? - no reason.
it's just that it seems like you're coming to me more than I might expect.
and how much did you expect, Mrs. Florrick?
I imagine that campaigns are very complicated things.
maybe you need... help.
what kind of help?
I think we should stay in touch.
I think we should talk regularly.
I can offer you advice and you can ask questions when you are confused.
I think that's a very good idea. Let's stay in touch.
Objection!
overruled. And ye-yes, exception, I get it.- Exception!
continue, Mr. Brody.
what other forensic evidence did you collect from the scene, ma'am?
we found partial palm prints on the Cessna door and fingerprints on the inside.
and who did those prints belong to?
the defendant.
no further questions.
have I been on that plane before?
objection, Your Honor. Beyond the scope.
sustained.
these prints of mine on the plane - that doesn't mean that I was at any time...? - Objection.
sustained.
did your investigation reveal you were on the plane...?
did your investigation reveal that I had been on the plane a week before the murder, and that could be the source of the fingerprints?
Yes.
are we finished here, Mr. Salle?
one second, Your Honor.
Mr. Salle?
miss I forgot your name.
Loren. - Loren, sorry.
what happened to the sample #48?
I don't understand the question.
you collected 48 blood samples. Isn't that correct?
no, 47 blood samples.
Yes, 47 samples according to your evidence list, and yet here on the crime scene photo, there is a 48th sample.
that's outside the designated crime scene.
so, you found blood outside the designated crime scene, and you decided not to include it?
objection, Your Honor.
this is a large hangar, and this blood sample was found by a tool kit which could have been left by any random worker.
overruled.
answer the question.
we did a preliminary blood type test of this blood sample, as we do with all our samples.
it was O-negative, not consistent with the victim.
and what is my blood type?
B-positive.
so it wasn't consistent with my blood type either.
no further questions.
I haven't said this in a while to anyone.
thank you.
Cryptbit encryption? You don't like Lasermite?
try combining Lasermite and Elcosec.
use them as binary sifters.
they'd cancel each other out.
use Lasermite for salting.
so, what did you find out about me?
some friends in D. C.said you phoned.
you have enemies.
nice-- same phone number.
there, there, there.
every night at 7: 30.
Yeah.
you recognize it.
Stan's Chicken Shack.
she's ordering takeout.
you think she would get takeout again from her new address?
Hey, Leela.
we should work together.
stop it. - What?
it's been such a difficult time for Peter and his family, and...
this award will mean so much to them.
now he needs us.
would you excuse me?
her daughter-in-law-- that's who we should get.
Oh, hello, Jackie. - Hello, Ruth.
we were just talking about your daughter-in-law.
where is Alicia?
well, as you know, she works, but my granddaughter is here-- Grace.
she's thinking of joining our cotillion.
it's so bogus, huh?
Yeah, I got dragged here.
Yeah.
you, too? - No, no, I'm... I'm working.
doing what?
you know.
so has your mom or dad said anything about this other scandal?
the one right now?
no.
they kind of just try to avoid the whole subject, you know.
they're still sleeping in separate rooms?
who's that?
Steven-- he's in film school.
so your parents aren't sleeping together anymore, right?
and you used to do accounting work for the victim, Mr. Kimball?
Yes, and Mr. Salle.
I'm sorry, Miss Derbeken, could you please move your hand?
Yes, sorry.
in fact, you traveled with Mr. Kimball, didn't you?
Yes, our job required moving around a lot, so I stayed in the same hotel.
and you saw firsthand a dispute between Mr. Kimball and the defendant about their Web site?
Yes, I did.
in fact, could you describe the letter you saw sent by Mr. Salle to the victim a week before the murder?
object now. - Why?
do it. - Objection.
your Honor, this isn't hearsay.
miss Derbeken is testifying to a letter she read herself, not what was heard.
Yes, but, uh... best evidence, Your Honor.
I'm listening.
the original letter offers... - The original letter offers the best evidence, and it can't be testified to if the letter is not produced.
where is the letter?
Oh, come on.
your Honor, we can't establish motive unless we hear from her.
that's not my problem, Mr. Brody.
the objection is sustained.
miss Derbeken cannot testify to the letter.
know what I want to do if I get out?
go to law school.
he's got no case, sir.
he's still arguing a unicorn defense.
and he's beating you.
he's got no case, and he's beating you. Cary.
don't do this-- he's a first year.
I don't care if he's just out of law school.
can you beat her?
we just caught a bad break, Mr. Childs.
that's not what I asked.
can you beat her?
Yes. -You're first chair.
I don't know how long you plan to stay with us, but that's not how you endear yourself to your coworkers.
Oh, is that what this is about-- endearment?
one last thing.
how are you on partners' offices?
Diane has a corner office.
I have a partial corner with more square footage.
we could splurge for either.
one of the things we did at our old office was move the partners' offices into the core of the building and made the outside communal associate areas.
it fostered goodwill.
do you prefer an interior office?
let me think on it.
and I would like to start a partner mentorship program.
well, we already unofficially mentor associates.
I think it'll create greater goodwill if we officially mentor.
there's one more thing.
peer review.
we don't choose who to fire.
associates grade each other.
it creates community.
Yeah, like Lord of the Flies.
well, let us think on that.
are we being played in some way?
I don't see how.
I don't either.
it's making me suspicious.
Stan's Chicken Shack on 58th.
Yeah, I just phoned a minute ago for my delivery order.
I just want to check I gave you the right address.
the name's Onya.
no delivery by that name.
are you sure you have the right...?
Stan's Chicken Shack.
Yeah, I think I might have given you the wrong address.
the name's Onya.
Yeah, you got a new address?
no, I-I think I may have given you the wrong address.
what do you have?
9625 West Marshfield, Apartment 5-EE.
is that right?
Yeah, yeah, that-that's really good. Thank you, bye.
you ready to take another go at this?
what is lupus?
lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks... Objection, Your Honor.
beyond the scope.
I'm going to overrule on that.
I'd like to see where this is going.
lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's cells and tissue, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage.
how common is it?
fairly common.
it affects perhaps one out of every 1, 000 Americans.
does the defendant Mr. Salle suffer from lupus?
lupus erythematosus, yes, he does.
now, what is another odd artifact of lupus?
well, if you withdraw medication, it can change your blood type.
so Mr. Salle could have O-negative blood one week, and if he changed his medication, B-positive the next?
that is correct.
now... this blood sample that you took from a tool kit in the hangar
this blood sample that Mrs. Florrick and her mentor worked so diligently to get into evidence
did you expedite a DNA test looking for a match? - I did.
and who did it match?
Mr. Salle the defendant.
well, no further questions. The prosecution rests.
no, no, no, Vance sent me. I work with his lawyers.
I'm not Onya you're looking for...
okay, they know you're in there. Don't go back in there. Come on.
look, Vance wants to help, but he needs your help, too.
you know who shot Kimball, right?
was it the government?
what?
the Feds use strollers. They're transmitters.
they're easy to disguise.
the guy who leaked me the video?
he was afraid that Kimball was going to name him, so he killed him.
Onya, you have to testify to that.
no. No, he'll kill you. He'll kill me, too.
we can hide your identity. - No, you can't.
if you bring me into that court, I will plead the Fifth.
look at her.
like that's a real baby.
okay, then tell me the name of the leaker.
I'll take the risk.
come on. It's the least you can do for Vance.
good news is we found the leaker.
CIA analyst, Edgar Barkus.
the bad news? - He's missing.
office was cleared out a month ago.
so, what are we saying?
it is a government conspiracy?
or the Pentagon found their leaker. - Alicia?
use her.
use Onya.
I don't understand.
prosecution is winning because they're arguing a straightforward case with a straightforward motive.
your client killed over money: possession of his Web site.
you need a straightforward alternative.
jealousy.
who's jealous? - Onya.
but she'll plead the Fifth. - Right, so use her.
Onya, you're familiar with Mr. Kimball's accountant, Jeanine Derbeken?
what do you mean, familiar?
you know who she is?
Yes.
this should be interesting.
you have to go?
Yeah. Take care.
and you knew that Jeanine would often stay in Mr. Kimball's hotel room when he traveled?
no.
you didn't know that?
but you also traveled with Mr. Kimball, didn't you?
I did, yeah.
and... did you ever fight with Jeanine?
with...? No.
you never fought with Jeanine over the attentions of Mr. Kimball?
objection.
sustained.
so, Onya, the week before the murder
this is the week Mr. Kimball received the leaked video
did you and Mr. Kimball travel to Washington D. C?
it's a simple question, Onya.
did you and Mr. Kimball stay together in Washington, D.C?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
are you sure that's what you want to do?
you're pleading the Fifth?
Yes.
you're worried about relating what happened with the victim in Washington D. C?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
miss, I want to make sure I understand what you're saying.
your Honor, the witness already answered...
are you pleading the Fifth because you were involved in Mr. Kimball's murder, or because of the leaked...?
your Honor, it is not your place to ask my witness.
Yes, it is, Mrs. Florrick.
now, you are taking the Fifth...
your Honor, if you compel my witness to answer this question,
I am moving for an immediate mistrial.
denied. I'm asking a simple question...
you are not, sir!
Mrs. Florrick... - You are piercing the Fifth Amendment right.
Mr. Florrick, shut up.
no, sir.
excuse me.
as long as you are attempting to circumvent her Fifth Amendment right,
I will not shut up.
you will shut up, or be held in contempt.
then hold me in contempt, and I will refer this to the Judicial Conduct Committee for immediate action.
this court will adjourn until tomorrow morning.
I'm almost done.
what are you up to?
I saw you in court today.
yeah?
you were amazing.
Peter, I've got to... study.
Peter, I have to study.
okay.
let me.
so, let's just go at this from a different angle.
do you know of any motive Mr. Salle might have had to murder Mr. Kimball?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me.
now, are you pleading the Fifth because you were involved in the murder, or...
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me.
so, you want to follow me again?
have me do your work for you?
Nope, I have something for you.
I picked it up on my police scanner.
a kid found the murder weapon down by the river.
a Russian-made Makarov semi-automatic.
the cops have it?
they're checking it for prints right now.
my guess is, your client didn't wipe it down.
how long do we have?
I know your Chicago cops are slow, but I'd say you got few minutes.
and you still want to plead the Fifth?
I refuse to answer...
no more questions.
Mrs. Florrick?
your next witness.
defense rests, Your Honor.
what are you doing? We still have to refute the blood evidence.
defense rests.
your Honor, The People are unprepared for closing arguments.
that's unfortunate, Mr. Agos, because I am.
well, we request a five-minute recess.
no, Mr. Agos.
this trial has gone on much longer than I anticipated, and I'm tired.
so you go now, or you don't go.
and where does that leave the defense?
in tatters. Look at their witnesses.
I'm sorry.
their one witness.
your Honor, I need to interrupt.
the police have just uncovered a new piece of evidence.
Mr. Brody, you know as well as I that once the prosecution starts its closing arguments, there is no new evidence.
Yes, Your Honor, but these are extraordinary circumstances.
well, that's unfortunate, Mr. Brody.
if the jury deadlocks, you may use your extraordinary circumstances in the next trial.
the jury will ignore Mr. Brody's statements.
you may continue, Mr. Agos.
about your peer review suggestion.
we thought we could try it for one year as a pilot program. - Okay.
and we're still working on getting you a smaller office without a window.
but in the meantime, you'll have to live with this.
thank you.
you shoot the hoops?
I do.
we got an afternoon league. A few judges, lawyers.
we could use some Baltimore blood.
Oh, you can't handle some Baltimore blood.
that's how it starts.
still deliberating? - Yep.
you know, that gun they found?
the Feds have a way of making this stuff pop up right when they need it.
they're offering you five years.
they're... Who is?
the state's attorney's office. Five years, second degree.
but you're... I mean, we're not considering it.
Yes, we are. It just takes one.
Yeah, it just takes one to deadlock. - Yes.
and if the jury deadlocks, the gun is in.
a deadlock works against you.
I can say the government planted... - Oh, Vance, stop it.
you did it.
right now, you're in control.
once the jury comes in, it's out of your hands.
take the five years.
did he take it?
the five years? Yes.
it was the smart move.
I'm your new mentor.
see you tomorrow morning.
rid Our Campus Of Hamas
it was e-mailed to campus inboxes.
do you know who sent it?
my guess is Tau Kappa Theta, the Jewish fraternity.
I'm not saying anything bad. - No, of course not.
I just think it was this video that provoked the fight at the interfaith rally.
and you want us to defend... - Jimal Mifsud.
scholarship student in Science.
his family is in Jiddah, and he can't afford a lawyer.
do you know his family?
no, I am purely an interested bystander here who wants to see justice done.
Purely?
there's a campus fistfight between a dozen Palestinian and Jewish youths, and the State's Attorney only charges one Palestinian?
well, he doesn't have a record, so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery.
court supervision, at most. - No the new State's Attorney wants to appear tough on his first day.
it was deemed a hate crime.
seven years.
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an old friend who until recently retained our competitor Young,
bachman and Meyers for his legal interest.
to my eternal regret.
very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
Alicia's fine.
your husband was very good to the Muslim community in his first term.
my fear is, that's changed.
of course, Alicia can't influence her husband in any way, but she is still one of our best lawyers.
well, that's all Jimal needs.
this is a good kid they're painting as a suicide bomber.
bond hearing's today. I'll be there.
good, that's one piece of business.
what else might we handle that Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?
I know that Eli Gold is working with you these days?
I'm in need of some crisis management.
what's the crisis? - Where's the management?
will you get, uh, Eli for us?
and ask Will to step in.
will? Sure.
he's late. Overslept.
must be from celebrating yesterday's victory.
must be. - Hey, Mom, pick up the phone...
Hello, dearest daughter. - You sound happy.
I am happy. I have my daughter on the phone. What more could I desire?
look, I don't think I need a tutor.
grace, we discussed this. It's just a month.
Yeah, but it was one report card.
and it's one month.
dad just thinks I need to apply myself.
I agree, and a tutor will help you do that.
Eli? The meeting.
mom, Nisa's parents want you to come over for dinner.
you and Dad. Both of you. - Why?
just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.
it was like you said; I haven't let anyone know you guys are separated.
okay, I'll talk to your father about it. I-I've got to go.
so, who is this guy again? - Wasim Al-Said.
he's a commodities trader. - Wasim?
Diane's been trying to sign him for two years.
he has ten million in charitable assets to spend.
on what?
a campaign against anti-Muslim bigotry.
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that I'm not a PR specialist.
I handle lobbying and crisis management.
do you watch the evening news, Eli?
religiously.
then you know there was a murder of a Jewish poli sci major at Chicago Polytech last night.
unsolved, but the police are questioning Muslim students.
ten minutes later, a riot broke out at the other end of campus at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue, and only one Muslim was arrested.
now I'm used to reading the tea leaves in this country, and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one.
isn't that true? - It is.
so, are you hiring me because I'm good or because I'm Jewish?
because I imagine it might look quite good having a Jew campaign for Muslims.
can't it be both?
I don't like being used. - Really? Since when?
he knows Jewish money is going to Peter for his next campaign - and he wants to buy influence. - And...
don't you get so knowing on me.
what's up with you, anyway?
you seem different.
where you going?
court. - Why?
I'm a lawyer.
okay, glad we cleared that up.
this is a hate crime, Your Honor, and we ask that bail be set at $100, 000.
have you ever been in a fistfight, Counselor?
have I, Your Honor? No.
well, let me educate you. It's chaos, chaos in there.
no one can tell who hits who.
fists are flying, you get hit in the head.
the next thing you know, you're on the ground and somebody's jumping...
Jimal, I'm sorry to be late. I was... - Jimal assaulted someone because he was Jewish. That is not chaos, Your Honor.
and Jimal was hit because he's Palestinian, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick, Your Honor.
20 students were fighting. Only one was charged.
one Muslim. - His religion had nothing to...
it had everything to do with it. - All right, okay, your passion is preserved for the record.
bond is set at $5, 000.
and I do suggest that the State reconsider its charge.
thank you, Your Honor.
Jimal, I was just put in on this.
you have a benefactor who asked me to step in. Are you all right?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I know, a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution to get you to accept a higher plea.
the good news is, the judge is on your side.
now, do you want me to call your parents or anything?
no, no they wouldn't...
look, I'm ashamed. - I understand.
hopefully, we can handle this by admitting simple battery.
but I didn't... I wasn't even there.
he wasn't at the rally, Cary.
he was at the library. - Oh, my God, really?
that's terrible.
this isn't about Jimal, and this isn't about some stupid fistfight.
this is about that Jewish kid stabbed to death, and you can't find the killer so Jimal is the scapegoat.
we have an eyewitness who saw Jimal throw the first punch.
that's what this is about. - Is the eyewitness Caucasian?
how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness.
why not ask if he's Jewish?
cross-racial identification. Caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics.
six months in County, one year probation.
no.
then I'll see you in court.
tell Peter there has to be a better way to firm up his campaign contributions.
using everything we can, are we?
it's a new day.
we're running a clean office.
let me say that again, because we're all prone to the same cynicism.
we... are running a clean office.
clean, ethical, honest, but not weak.
I know our budgets have been slashed.
I know we're the underdog here.
but our strategy will be this:
no plea bargains.
that's right.
defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite.
so for the next two months, I want you to hold the line on every single plea.
after that, you won't have to work as hard.
you get your enemy flinching, you'll never have to hit him hard again.
your first complaint will be about investigator hours.
that's why I've hired an outside contractor until we can budget full time.
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.
she's good, and she's cheap. - Thanks!
relatively.
Mr. Florrick, I offered the defense six months on the college hate crime.
should I walk it back?
what's the law say?
three to seven years. - There's your answer.
the lawyer's Alicia, and she might come after your campaign contributions.
Really? - Yeah.
what do you want? - Follow the law.
you can't go wrong if you follow the law.
all right.
geez, what a pit. - Thank you.
you're working on the, uh, the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?
Yeah, the hate crime. Why? What do you need?
it's not what I need.
what is this?
you used to work with Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?
Yeah. - If I were you, I'd slip it to her.
so, kind of odd not seeing you around much.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Yeah.
and here I thought you didn't need me anymore.
what's that?
it's a peace offering.
Peter Florrick wants to run a clean office, so...
this is me being clean.
you're welcome.
you can't make Chicagoans feel good about Islam with pathos.
you need to go positive.
link the Arab Spring to the American Revolution.
who is the Islamic George Washington?
who is the Islamic Paul Revere?
morning in the Middle East...
do you need something? - It's on your desk.
it's self-explanatory.
red Light Violation
that's your car?
good.
now, I know you said you were at the library.
but the time code on that traffic light shows that the driver of your car was running a red light just outside the campus gates at the exact moment of the interfaith rally.
that means that the driver of your car, if that is you, couldn't have been involved in the rally fight. Do you understand?
I do.
so, I want you to take your time before you answer.
is that you driving your car?
it is.
are you certain, young man?
it's a very roundabout way to come from the library.
I'm sure.
we ask that Mr. Mifsud state under oath that he was the driver in this photo which we will mark as People's Exhibit #1.
your Honor, is that really necessary?
it's the only way we'll drop the hate charge.
very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.
do you swear that that's you in the photo?
Yes. - Good.
well, I think that just about, uh, wraps it up, doesn't it, Mr. Agos?
I'm late for the gym. - It does, Your Honor, and the State has made a terrible mistake in charging Mr. Mifsud with this battery.
but this car with this license plate was seen racing away from the scene of the frat murder of Simon Greenberg...
objection, Your Honor!
that is why he ran the red light.
this is outrageous. - He had just killed Simon Greenberg.
this is prosecutorial misconduct.
he swore to it. His alibi means he committed this murder.
because you overcharged him with a hate crime so he would grab at any alibi.
so you're saying your client perjured himself?
no, I am saying he took my advice, that's all.
well, then congratulations, Alicia.
you just advised your client to admit to murder.
your Honor, the People charge Jimal Mifsud with first-degree murder.
Alicia dropped by for you. - Why?
I don't know. You want me to get her?
no. Later.
so this isn't you?
it's your car, but you're not driving it?
I'm sorry, I,uh, I thought it was the easiest way out.
so who is it? Who's driving it?
I don't know.
Jimal, they have a witness who swears that that car...
your car...
was driven away by Simon Greenberg's killer.
so don't cover for anyone. - I'm not covering.
my-my two roommates don't have a car,
I let Amir and Tariq use mine. I just leave my keys in the room.
so which is driving it, Amir or Tariq?
I don't know.
but he swore that was him driving away from the murder?
he didn't know it would implicate him in a murder.
it's my fault. I encouraged him to place himself in the car to give him an alibi from the hate crime.
Yes. And now I have a multimillion-dollar client thinking that we're amateurs.
I got the pictures from the ASA's office.
I should've checked. - Great.
it's everybody's fault. Now let's make it right.
I'm questioning Jimal's roommates. One of them is the real driver.
and I'm filing a motion to dismiss Jimal's alibi statement during preliminary.
I don't know what's going on with you two, but make it better.
whatever you have to do. Make it better.
so are we supposed to do something?
sure. What subject? - I don't know.
you're the tutor.
what does your mom want?
she wants me to get better grades, so that I'll get into Briarcrest.
you don't like public school? - No, I do.
it's just that there was a mugging on the field, and all the parents got really scared.
is this your first job tutoring? - Yeah.
how am I doing? - Not so good.
Darn.
can we go outside?
Yeah, I think it's up to you.
Cary the man! Throwing down that opposition.
nicely played - Thanks - So this is the new Cary? - No, just a new day.
so can I see the crime scene photos, Cary?
well, come on. You're in the big leagues now. What can it hurt?
I'll think about it.
well, looky who's here. - Sophia?
in the flesh.
strange bedfellows, huh? - The strangest.
well...
you two have a nice time.
What'd she want?
crime scene photos.
damn it. - Okay
Simon Greenberg, 22, found in his dorm room gagged, hands bound, stabbed 45 times.
little overkill? - Yep.
police think it was an execution. No sign of a struggle.
any witnesses?
neighbor heard a scream, looked out his window and saw a dark, possibly black Middle Eastern man running to his car.
they got a number plate...ET27.
damn.
that's not a partial plate. - Yeah, I know. Jimal's plate.
one other thing. Something that wasn't released to the press.
what?
killer drew a swastika with the victim's blood.
Yep. I know this is not looking good, is it?
okay, um, let me know what you get from the roommates.
got it. by the way the swastika...the police don't know why, but it was drawn backwards.
okay.
am I interrupting?
Nope.
how are you?
good.
do you have a moment to talk?
about last night? - Yeah.
don't act like this is nothing, Eli.
you're running a pro-Palestinian campaign.
it's an anti-Muslim-bigotry campaign, - and I am a crisis man... - You are a Jew.
we are both... - come on, Michael!
what is this? Ultimate Frisbee?
we only win by making them lose?
Yes.
you act like you're not paying attention, but I know you're paying attention.
this is a PR war. - And I'm a traitor?
in February, Israeli soldiers helped a Palestinian woman give birth.
you didn't read about it unless you subscribed to the Israel National News.
two days later, an Israeli woman gave birth in a Palestinian hospital.
where did you read it? AP, CBS News, every major paper. Google it.
go ahead. This is a PR war and they are winning.
I do not go to your house and tell you what novels to write.
I do not go to your committee and tell you what lobbyists to hire
that's it.
now I get it.
I didn't hire you. There it is.
I hired Tarkovsky & Associates.
with a $20 million Jewish League Fund to fight intolerance.
Yes, you did.
so this isn't Israel/Palestine to you.
it's Gold versus Tarkovsky.
you're paying a competitor, Michael.
and as moved as I am by your plea for Jewish brotherhood, I'm not that moved.
4, 000 years and we are always our own worst enemy.
so you were driving Jimal's car that night, right?
this is just like the cops.
racist.
they think an Arab had to do it.
Yeah, but this is you, isn't it, Amir?
you were driving your roommate's car that night, right?
no.
and you know why it's not me?
look at your time code, lady.
I was in my living room for salah. Evening prayers.
anybody else see you there? - Yes.
who? - The Prophet Muhammad.
peace be upon him.
Yeah, Amir's in the living room five times a day praying.
okay, Tariq. Did you see him praying on the night of the murder?
no. - So you were home?
you were home to be able to not see him there?
no, I was out. - In Jimal's car?
no, I wanted to take it, but the keys were gone already.
so where were you? - I was here.
in the quad at the interfaith rally.
I didn't see you over there.
this is how you investigate these days? By just following me?
Yep. Makes things a lot easier.
so you and Cary, huh?
that's why you've been ignoring me, right?
it's not because I'm married.
Yep. You got me.
listen, I'm gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the Jewish frat.
do you want the address?
Where's the fun in that?
your Honor, this is...
this is prosecutorial misconduct. This is absolutely unethical.
all right, all right. Each to your corners.
Mrs. Florrick, your client already swore that that was him in the car.
is he now trying to say that he lied?
he's saying that he was misled by the prosecution.
how did I mislead?
Jimal was given an opportunity to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it, that's all.
this murder charge is based on nothing else.
there's no evidence that Jimal and the victim even knew each other.
Where's the motive?
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish and Jimal was Muslim, and as you can see here, Your Honor, a swastika was drawn on the victim's...
come on. Anti-Semitism isn't some cookie cutter motive you can apply to any dark-skinned...
all right, counselors, listen.
nobody likes a street fight better than me, but that's for in the street, not here.
Mr. Agos, do you have any further probable cause?
because if it's just that statement, I am prone to overturn.
we do, Your Honor.
professor Noah Fineman. I teach political science.
and did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures?
he did.
it's a lecture that I give on the anniversary of 9/11 about chickens who come home to roost for the United States and Zionist regime in Israel...
objection. Your Honor, is Mr. Agos really trying to find a motive in Jimal's classes?
why not home ec? Maybe that's where the knife came from.
overruled.
I think we can stand a bit of rough and tumble here, Counselor.
so, Professor, you would argue that Israel's a criminal regime.
I-I don't argue it.
I think that's fairly self-evident.
given this, what do you think of suicide bombings and the death of Jewish citizens?
if you're asking me if I approve of such a thing, no, never.
but I do understand them.
these are understandable movements against a Zionist oppression.
and how did your student Jimal take an added interest in this lecture?
well, he was, uh, very engaged in class, yes.
and afterwards, he approached me to ask me questions about my newest book,
zionist Occupation: the Need for Realignment and New Thinking.
Bordinay Press.
thank you, Professor.
no further questions, Your Honor.
actually, Professor, I have a few questions.
my client was very engaged in your lecture, you said?
how did you witness this?
well, if you teach students long enough, you get a sense.
and for how long did you teach Jimal?
well, it's been four weeks since the beginning of the semester.
so four weeks, that's, uh, 20 sessions.
and for how many of those sessions were you actually present?
I don't understand.
how many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching and not having one of your TA's do it?
didn't you only lecture the class twice, Professor?
well, I would question your use of the word "only,
but, uh...
Yes.
and yet you really focused with your laser-like perception on Jimal and his engagement.
you're being a bit rude.
Yes, and I'm just getting started. So, after one of your lectures, Jimal came to you to ask you about your book.
how do you know this?
because I keep a record next to my attendance.
see? That asterisk tells me that
I must send them an e-mail about my book.
and, of course, you recognize Jimal, over there?
Yes.
this record attendance, the students sign themselves in, yes?
Yes, it's a very efficient way to work.
I'm sure. Do you see Jimal's name there?
it's him there. - That's not his handwriting.
objection.
that's the handwriting of his roommate, Tariq, also a student in your class who signed him in so that Jimal could cut class.
well, I'd say things have been pretty easy for you up until now.
Really? How's that?
in court, these people don't really know how you think.
but you do?
hate to tell you this but we're going to beat you.
good luck with that.
battle M. E. Gaza Strip.
it's one of my best MMOGs. - And what is an MMOG?
massive Multiplayer Online Game.
meaning people log onto their computers and battle each other.
Yep. - What are we looking at now?
well, that's the recorded actions of Sampson5.
that's the avatar of the accused, Jimal...
objection. Your Honor, what does this have to do with the death of Simon Greenberg?
goes to motive, Your Honor.
what is that assault weapon over there, is that an uzi?
no, it's a Galil 5. 56.
what's the range of fire? - 450 meters.
cool. Proceed.
well, that's Jimal's avatar there.
the guy running.
and what is he wearing?
that? That's a suicide vest.
he's wearing a suicide vest?
and what is he entering?
that's a civilian Israeli building.
that's a school, in fact... - Your Honor, this is a game.
Mr. Al-Said was just here.
he wants us to pull out of Jimal's defense.
he is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing will undercut Eli's pro-Muslim campaign.
he wasn't making light of it. He was playing a video game.
in which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids.
Yes, but in a video game.
have you seen video games lately?
we can't abandon Jimal. He was looking at misdemeanor battery.
we helped him into a murder charge.
"we"?
I...
helped him into a murder charge, which I did as a representative of this firm.
we made a commitment to him.
what do you think?
I think your friend will pull out of Eli's campaign and go right back to his old firm with his $10 million.
Yeah.
still, retail rules.
we broke it, we own it?
okay, we'll stick with Jimal.
win this one.
no. - No, what?
no, Mr. Al-Said.
I'm coming here as a courtesy.
I don't need your campaign anymore. I'm taking my business back to my old firm.
that's too bad because I already cashed your check.
you did not. - I did.
you know us Jews.
you'd do anything to piss me off.
you're right. But I have still got a great pro-Muslim campaign for you.
good doing business with you.
did you hear the one about the Arab and the Jew?
no. But I'm sure it's very funny.
an Arab and a Jew walk into a bar.
and then they kill each other.
energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta, matched to...
patterns of black body radiation.
you know that's bad for you?
it's like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn.
but I don't want three buckets of popcorn.
Oh, my God. - What?
okay, I need your help.
don't shake the camera. Just keep it steady.
what are you doing?
look at the color. It's Bollywood. You can't pass up Bollywood.
do you know them? - No. It's chance.
I do this all the time.
grace, camera up.
what are you doing?
good to have you back, Mr. Sartori. - Yeah.
so tell me, what is a power-up?
sorry, this is the only place in the world where I have to explain a power-up.
in a video game, it's something that you collect to give you extra power.
like a gun, or, you know, ammunition.
so, would anyone ever pass up a power-up?
no. Not unless you're crazy.
you never know when you'll run out of ammunition.
so this suicide vest that Jimal's avatar is wearing, what is that?
it's a power-up.
and everybody who plays your game grabs one?
at one point or another.
in fact, according to your own logs, many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office...
objection. - Overruled.
many ASAs in Mr. Agos's office have collected such suicide packs?
Yeah, it's a part of the game. It's not a thing.
but doesn't that mean these ASAs are more likely to have murdered Simon Greenberg?
your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick?
Mrs. Florrick, any further questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Sartori, Jimal's roommate, Amir Al-Fulan, he played your online game, too?
I have no idea.
this is a record of your subpoenaed logs. Can you read that there?
Oh, yeah.
and you had to reduce his privileges because he fought with another player, didn't he?
Yeah, he, uh, he got in a fight online. On the Battle M. E.board.
and who did he fight with? Can you read that there?
you had to reduced both their privileges.
Simon Greenberg. - Thank you.
Jimal's roommate, Amir, is the most-likely suspect.
but he has an alibi...praying.
Yes, but he was alone.
what about the other roommate...Tariq?
we can't find any contact between Tariq and the victim.
and he doesn't have the political motive.
amir is the Palestinian hard-liner. Tariq could care less.
okay.
thank you, Alicia.
keep us in touch.
what do you think? - I think...
you're holding something against her.
I'm what? - Alicia.
maybe it's unconscious, maybe it's not, but you're being hard on her.
no.
she's a third-year associate on a partner track and she's treating us like peers.
that's all you're seeing.
my God, am I the only adult left here?
could everybody just put their emotions away?
I've got to get to a meeting, unless you have some other stray observations for me.
are we overdoing it?
Diane thinks I'm going too hard on you.
am I?
going too hard?
all those late nights...
no time off.
Buried...in work.
up to my knees.
he's doing it again, Mom! He's doing it again!
it's just my neighbors.
come on, let's go to the bedroom. - No, no, no, no, no.
don't move. Don't move.
leg is done, the chops are ready to go.
I'm just warming up the leg of lamb piece after it's been reposing for ten or 15 minutes...
we need to eat better.
I like what we eat. - No, I need to cook.
you're happier without Dad.
no, I'm happier with you.
okay, that was such a mom thing to say.
no, it's about Dad.
does that upset you?
no.
I don't know.
you know I love Dad. - I know.
I'm sorry.
no.
I found you a new tutor. Dana.
I think you'll like her, she's social.
actually, I think I like this one now.
you...
I thought you said she was too different.
she is.
but sometimes different isn't always bad.
she's coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow.
what? - she's setting up your computer?
I asked her to.
please tell me you're learning something, and that this isn't all pointless.
I'm learning something.
so how do you explain that, Amir?
I don't explain it.
you said you didn't know the victim, Simon Greenberg, and here you are on a video game fighting with him.
I don't need to talk to you.
you got no authority here.
Hey, you want to make yourself useful in here?
I just got the authority.
he claims it wasn't him.
it wasn't him, what, fighting against Greenberg?
on the video game. Amir says it was Tariq.
he let him use his screen name.
these roommates...they share everything.
so I'm checking Tariq, but we're back to square one.
amir had a motive...politics, fanaticism.
tariq isn't political or religious.
I wonder if we're making a mistake thinking it's about Middle Eastern politics.
these kids...they're just...college kids.
all rise.
okay, I'll keep checking, but I'll need some time.
judge Karpman presiding. - Thank you.
please be seated.
so, this is where we stand.
there is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause.
further, we set this case on my trial...
your Honor, we ask that you recuse yourself.
excuse me?
we believe you have shown bias against our client.
believe? Really?
in what way?
your religion.
this is...
outrageous.
I'm...My Jewish background is completely irrelevant in this case.
your Honor, you have given money to the Outlook for Israel, an organization that supports the settlements in Israel.
we believe you have shown bias against our client, and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings.
I'll give you my answer in an hour.
he's not going to recuse himself.
he will.
Karpman always backs down when he's pushed.
he's afraid he'll be overturned on appeal.
so we start over with a new judge.
no.
I know what Alicia's doing.
Hi, Michael. How are you?
I was just sitting here going over this campaign.
arab Spring.
sort of like Irish Spring, but with Arabs.
do you want some coffee? - How much?
for the coffee?
how much for six months if I brought the Jewish League Fund here?
how much are you paying Tarkovsky & Associates?
you know how much I'm paying.
well, of course, we would have to tell Mr. Al-Said that we can't handle his account anymore, so if you'd help us defer those costs...
you're really a son of a bitch.
I am.
but now I'm your son of a bitch.
all rise. Judge Karpman presiding.
please be seated.
I've taken a great deal of time with this motion because I believe that part of being a tough judge is also being a fair judge.
your Honor, may I quickly interrupt?
can't imagine why, Counselor. I'm ready to rule.
Yes, but...
I believe Mrs. Florrick is attempting to manipulate this court.
excuse me! - If you recuse yourself,
your Honor, the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow?
is that correct? - Yes, it is.
you were about to make your ruling, Your Honor?
that's what she's counting on.
do you know what tomorrow is, Your Honor?
what tomorrow is? - The holiday.
that has nothing to do with my motion.
it's Rosh Hashanah.
there will be no Jewish judges in court, the case will be assigned to a non-Jewish judge.
that is why she's asking you to recuse yourself.
your Honor, this is offensive!
Mrs. Florrick, I am...
disappointed in you.
the motion is denied. Case remains on my trial call!
Hi, Tariq. How are you?
so, what, are you following me?
no. I'm following her.
Hey, Tariq.
you know, if you're looking for a more discreet gay bar, I'd try Scarlet's on Halsted.
no, no, no, no. I'd try Sidetrack.
it's too leathery. - What do you need?
you used Amir's avatar on Battle M. E.the online video game.
so?
so, that's where you met Simon Greenberg.
no. - Yeah.
Actually...yeah.
checked your alibi.
didn't hold up, Tariq. You weren't at the interfaith rally.
why would I kill Greenberg? It-It makes no sense.
we spoke to the bartender.
he said you met Greenberg here quite a few times.
my guess is, you two fell in love.
you argued. He met someone else.
you got jealous. You stabbed him.
made it look like a hate crime.
I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't!
why the reversed swastika? - What?
when you set it up as a hate crime, why did you draw the swastika backward?
what do you mean? Isn't that how you draw it?
is it good for the Jewish League Fund? I don't know.
the Muslim was the killer, but he was also gay, and sleeping with our guy, so, uh, I would call that a classic mixed message.
crisis management.
if it helps our cause, I could find out if he's a top.
that was a joke.
Yeah. Okay, I-I-I got to go.
important work? - Fate of the world.
what do you think? - It's very flattering, Eli.
but I can't be thinking about the governorship when I'm doing this job.
so do this job.
let me think about the governorship.
just an observation from work.
if you're worried about Alicia and Will Gardner...
I'm not...worried.
I know, I know, but, um, if you were,
I think that whatever was there is no more.
they barely look at each other.
you don't want a divorced candidate, do you?
no, I...
forget it.
you need a friend, K.
why do I need a friend? - Or a dog.
maybe you need a dog.
Kalinda and Pooch. Out investigating.
I'm fine, Will. Really.
what's wrong with me?
we're not like normal people, are we?
what are normal people like?
emotional. - You're emotional.
no. Sometimes I'm in the middle of an emotion, and I just look at myself and realize...
I'm not feeling anything.
I just like acting like someone who feels something.
you want to stop acting and actually feel?
Yeah.
that's what it feels like.
Thanks.
I got to go. I got to be somewhere at 8: 45.
Really?
that's specific. - Yup.
be good.
I'll get them to school on Monday.
you sure? - Yeah.
do we take our homework?
Yes! - Yes!
so, you've hired a tutor for Grace?
Yes, I did. She's good, I think, and Grace likes her.
Or...she likes her now.
I'll keep an eye on that.
also, Zach's girlfriend, Nisa...her parents wanted us to come for dinner.
I'll tell her you're busy.
Yeah, yeah, tell her I'm...I'm busy.
love you. - Love you.
I love you. You call if you need anything. I'll be here.
28, 000 feet, 73-mile-an-hour winds.
the South Col.
500 climbers all crowding the same route in the one three-week period.
it's a nightmare on Everest.
that's Hillary Step. I shot this just below the summit.
there's always a bottleneck waiting to use the ropes.
and that's where Robert Lambros died?
Yes.
and that's his body there?
Yes. He was a guide.
one of the members of his party collapsed and died above Hillary Step, and Bobby stayed to help, and then succumbed, too.
I'm sorry.
I liked your brother.
you okay? - Now, regarding his book...
the defendant's book...
have you read it? - I have.
in it, he claims that my client,
Mr. Oliver Cardiff, came upon the dying Robert Lambros, not only stepped over his body to get to the summit, but then took his bottled oxygen.
you're aware of that accusation? - I am.
and do you disagree? - I do.
I was climbing Everest for a documentary, and I saw Mr. Cardiff here climbing with a British team.
and this is below the Hillary Steps?
step. Yes.
so, Mr. Cardiff couldn't have been near Lambros.
he was lower on the mountain, heading up?
Yes, that would follow. - So, this bk is untrue?
well, I hate to question another climber, especially a friend, but Danny was at base camp and didn't see what I saw.
no further questions.
nothing personal, but I have to rip your friend apart.
be gentle.
Mr. Branch, what is the death zone?
the death zone?
in mountaineering parlance, it's the altitude above 26, 000 feet where oxygen is insufficient to sustain life.
it's also a place where perceptions are not to be fully trusted?
sometimes.
you believe that bottled oxygen has hurt the sport of mountain climbing, so you climb without oxygen?
I do.
and an absence of oxygen would increase the likelihood of untrustworthy perceptions?
Yes.
so, when you say that you saw the plaintiff below the Hillary Step, we have to take your word for it, and yet your word could be colored by your oxygen-deprived perception.
I believe... that follows.
your Honor, I'd like to make a motion at this time to dismiss this lawsuit.
this is a libel suit, not a criminal case.
the plaiiff needs not only to prove that my client's book was wrong, but that he knew it was wrong.
which we're doing. - No.
there is too much inherent uncertainty here.
this is a case built on perception, and the death zone makes those perceptions essentially suspect.
he dismissed. I'm...
I'm stunned. - Me, too.
thank you.
the thought of him leaving my brother behind and then suing me for everything...
I know. It's over.
Hi, Eli.
where are you? The meeting's in ten minutes.
and what meeting was that again?
okay, don't tease. I'm not in the mood.
I'm heading back there now. 30 minutes.
Mickey, there you are.
any trouble? - No.
took the elevator to the 31st floor, walked on down, nobody saw me.
you look like crap.
Thanks. This way.
who was that?
no idea.
do you ever get the feeling we're losing control here?
every day.
the state's attorney can hire any law firm he wants to handle all civil cases against his department.
glenn Childs had Brimly, Tully & Snider.
God, I hated them.
Peter Florrick fired them and is looking for new outside counsel.
it's $20 million a year in new business.
Florrick will never hire us.
it's his wife's firm, his campaign manager's firm.
which works against us.
he doesn't want it to look like a sweetheart deal.
we've been invited in to pitch.
how many firms have been invited?
eight.
then you should pitch.
we should pitch. - No.
is there something I should know?
about?
I just don't want to be blindsided.
have you noticed you're turning into me? All the sports metaphors.
a better version of you.
how the hell is it I can love a new car smell but hate a new office one?
cause a car means fun, and an office, work.
you getting laid, anyways?
me? No.
you? - Not since the summer of '08.
so, you're the flavor of the month these days in crisis managers.
what happened with Weiner? Thought you'd be on that one.
Oh, God, the day politicians discovered Twitter...
I hear you're the flavor of the month in strategists.
what campaign are you on?
I need your help.
but I can't tell you who this help is for.
okay.
I've been hired by a candidate who's setting up an exploratory committee.
for what? - I can't tell you.
but he's got a problem. A real problem.
financial or sexual? - I can't tell you.
come on, Mickey. You want me to crisis manage a crisis you can't tell me?
this guy wants options, okay?
he wants to know this scandal can be handled if he chooses to run, but he doesn't want the scandal to get out if he chooses not to run.
this is BS. It's like a bake-off without any ingredients.
buyer's market, Eli.
if you choose not to play, there are others who will.
now, I'm meeting with three crisis managers.
whoever's got the best play, that's who we're going with.
Alicia, I'd like you to meet a good friend, Mickey Gunn.
Yeah, yeah, I get it. You got Saint Alicia on your team.
I'll hear from you by Thursday, buddy.
that was the big meeting?
who's the investigator here?
Kalinda Sharma. Why?
I need her to investigate a scandal before it happens.
Mrs. Florrick.
hello.
are you here to see someone? - Yes, you.
James Thrush. Very pleased to meet you.
and you.
how may I help you?
do you know the key distinction between the libel laws in your country and mine
burden of proof is reversed.
in America, it is up to the person libeled to prove the accusations against them are either knowingly or recklessly false.
in England, it is up to the person libeling...
your writing client, Mr. Lambros...to prove what he says is true.
this is already adjudicated, Mr. Cardiff.
Yes. In the United States.
Danny didn't sell any books in England.
actually, I'm afraid he did. This, in fact, is one.
purchased not two weeks ago from your wonderful Inteet site, Amazon.
you can't... - Actually, I'm afraid I can.
I am a Queen's Counsel of the Royal Courts of Justice, and this is a writ of new proceedings for libel.
you had this ready tor the day you lost.
Mr. Cardiff wished to exhaust the American courts first.
you're going after the wrong man...Danny did nothing wrong.
he accused me of killing his brother.
he ruined my reputation. Read the charge.
I am suing him for 20 million pounds
he's not rich. He doesn't have your money.
let's not make this a classist issue, shall we?
I know he's not rich. Now he'll be poor.
Mr. Ash Brannon?
so sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Alicia Florrick.
Yes. Hello.
sorry.
Florrick? Right. Two Rs?
Yes. Come with me.
certainly.
excuse me?
it's an anagram. Sorry. It's a nervous habit. Sorry.
okay.
so you are the barrister that Danny hired. Is that correct?
actually, no. The solicitor.
no, not as posh as a barrister, but we try harder.
sorry, I'm a bit punchy. Just, uh, first trip to the States.
you know, just off the plane. Where are the Olsen twins?
where?
would you like a cup of coffee?
will! This is Mr. Timothy Ash Brannon.
Yes, the barrister. Will Gardner.
actually, solicitor. No, thank you on the coffee.
anagrams.
it's not a deposition. It's a letter rogatory.
and that's? - Well, basically, it's a, uh...
it's a deposition.
evidence given before a trial.
the witnesses are primarily in America, so his lordship has agreed to allow it to be videotaped here.
good, then we try to get this kicked before trial.
or we stall it. - Stall what?
cardiff doesn't need the money from this suit.
he wants the publicity. That's why he's expediting this.
so? We can't just sit back.
we get this kicked, there won't be any publicity.
but the burden of proof worksed, against us now.
we would have to prove that Danny's book is true.
which we can't do.
we can't stall.
my wife's house...it's in Toronto. My business, too.
canada is a British Commonwealth.
they froze your assets? - Yes.
what was your strategy in court?
show there could be no certainty about the events on Everest.
therefore, there could be no libel.
well, that strategy just went out the window.
what do we have?
to prove Cardiff took Lambros's oxygen?
well nothing. The goal wasn't to prove it.
can we, though? Can we prove it?
what about the satellite call?
robert talked to his wife from his satellite phone just before he died.
we never needed the tape. - I'm on it.
are you the investigator?
I am.
do you have a minute?
do you want me to have a minute?
so there's a scandal of some kind, but you don't know who or what it is?
Yes. Can you find out?
how does this work when I investigate for you?
I have no idea.
but you are one of my bosses now?
Yes. I think so.
you probably invoice in some way.
I have to pitch to a campaign manager on Thursday on how to manage a scandal, but he's afraid the scandal will be exposed, so he won't give me any information, and I need that information to pitch.
do you want to sit down? - No.
you want the information so he's forced to hire you, or you'll expose it?
how have I never met you before?
we move in different circles.
sorry about that.
it's amazing how my life has gone from no calls to a call sheet of 85 a day.
Yes, it's quite a change...
from prison back to the state's attorney's office.
how you doing? - I love it.
I really love it.
you don't mind if Cary sits in on this, do you?
no, not at all.
Hi, Cary. - Diane.
he gives me insight into all the Lockhart/Gardner matters.
so you guys are the survivors of the economy.
I looked at the roll of Chicago firms since I was last in this seat.
they're practically all gone.
well, there's been some tough times, but we're fighters.
well, you've beaten us a few times.
no hard feelings?
the reason you're in that seat.
we're hiring an outside caretaker for our civil cases...
lawsuits against County Hospital, the police or SA's office...
and we need to decide between three firms.
Really? I thought there were eight.
there were. We whittled it down. - I'm honored.
the only problem is, we have some concerns.
if it's about Alicia and Eli Gold, we've established a Chinese wall between their work and SA business.
no.i'm not going to reject a law firm because it might look bad to the public.
the drug dealer.
we only handle his legitimate business.
and I'm sure you'll find that every major law firm has a few potentially unsavory clients.
we have to have some assurances that your money isn't tainted.
is that a fair word? - It is.
Diane, look, I'm running a new office, and I know that every state's attorney says that...
I said it my first term...
but this time, it's different.
now, you're one of three law firms that I'm considering to hire as my attorney.
I need to know that you're clean.
so we just need you to voluntarily submit to an audit by the Illinois State Department of Taxation.
and that won't violate attorney-client privilege.
it gives me an independent confirmation that your hands are free of drug money.
you're asking us to voluntarily submit to an audit?
Yes. If you want the job.
well, uh, that's significant. I'll need to talk to my partner.
of course. Will?
Yes. You two know each other, don't you?
we do.
why don't you bring him in next time, and we'll all talk about the possibility of, uh, making this all work?
86th call. If you will excuse me.
Yeah.
dad. I'm coming over early tomorrow night. At 8: 00, okay?
okay.
is everything all right?
Yeah, everything's fine. I just wanted to come early.
okay, good. Well, I'll make dinner.
well, thanks for the vote of confidence, Zach.
I think it might be more appropriate to respond,"Good morning."
I understand the arguments for "Good evening," but the court of record is in London, not in the United States, and as you can see, it is morning here.
your Lordship, I will gladly defer. Good morning to all.
and good evening to you, Mr. Thrush.
who is the barrister representing the respondent?
a solicitor, Your Lordship.
one Timothy O'Brannon.
Brannon, Your Lordship. No "O"
Mr. Brannon, are there any applications to the court before we commence?
there are, Your Honor.
your Lordship. - Your Lordship.
this is a sham of a lawsuit.
rich plaintiffs like Roman Polanski, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mr. Cardiff can't win their libel suits in American courts, so they take them to England.
sir, I understand your passion in this matter, but I would ask you to address this court with a greater degree of restraint.
I... Apologies, Your...
lordship. - Lordship.
that might be an artifact of the Polycom.
I merely wanted to stress that there were only 18 copies of our client's books sold in the United Kingdom.
they were all bought online, and they were all bought by Mr. Cardiff's staff.
as my learned colleague well knows, Your Lordship, where and who purchased these books is irrelevant.
excuse me.
Mr. Cardiff bought the books that he is now bringing suit to here.
Mr. Gardner, what are you doing?
I... what am I doing?
your body.
the disposition of your body.
you turned your back to the judge.
are you kidding me? - No. Look.
look, maybe you should let me argue... - Apologies apologies, Your Lordship. I am...I am new to your court.
we would argue that your parliament is in the midst of rewriting these libel laws to prevent exactly this type of libel tourism.
your Lordship, parliament was indeed considering revising these very laws until Mr. Rupert Murdoch and his recent News of the World contretemps.
I would argue that only 23 copies of Funding Evil were purchased through the Internet, yet this court ordered that book's destruction...
I think you'd better argue instead. The judge likes demure.
Mr. Thrush made a fine point. We will continue.
if I may, Your Lordship. - Yes, Mr. O'Brannon.
Brannon, Your Lordship.
we ask the court's indulgence in hearing evidence intended to refute the applicant's charge.
proceed.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
it's just so cold.
Bobby, do me a favor. Just get up.
you can do it. Please.
I'm just so tired. - I know.
your son needs you, Bobby.
he's here. He needs his father.
get up and walk.
and this was your husband?
Yes.
he had a satellite phone.
he called from the South Col.
he always called at noon.
and you recorded it? - Yes.
I wanted his son to remember him.
use the oxygen, Bobby, please.
and get up and walk.
over here!
here! - Is someone there?
it's the British team.
hold on.
but they didn't stop for him.
no.
and they took your husband's oxygen tank.
Yes.
I asked him to use his oxygen tank, but it was gone.
no apology, no money.
but we'll agree not to print the book in Great Britain.
very emotional in there.
nice touch using the female lawyer.
you Americans certainly do enjoy your drama.
so does His Lordship. Did you see him?
1.2 million and an apology.
so is this some of that famous stiff-upper-lip stuff I've heard about?
God, I do love you Yanks.
you are so easy to distract.
with our accents and our periwigs and our tea and crumpets.
and Benny Hill. Don't forget Benny Hill.
but I am not the England of Big Ben and bobbies.
I'm not the England of doilies and cucumber sandwiches.
I'm the England of football hooligans and Jack the Ripper.
and this England don't play nice, and it don't play fair, and it don't ever stop.
here's some advice, Mr.uh...Thrush.
when you want to intimidate someone, don't use so many words.
intimidation isn't a sonnet.
it seems we understand each other perfectly.
shall we?
Mrs. Lambros, you used to be a mountaineer yoself?
Yes, until I became pregnant.
and why did you stop then?
Why? I couldn't risk it with a son.
Yes, of course.
your husband kept climbing after you gave birth?
Yes. He was a guide. It was his job.
but he was offered other climbing jobs on less dangerous peaks.
in the Alps, for instance.
don't need to answer that. We understand.
tell me about hypoxia.
hypoxia is an extreme form of oxygen deprivation - prevalent at high altitudes. - Thank you.
now, isn't one of the potential side effects of hypoxia hallucinations?
potentially.
Mrs. Lambros, I put it to you that your husband was hallucinating on that telephone call.
I put it to you that your husband saw what he wished to see...
the British team coming to save him.
come on. You're kidding me.
I beg your pardon.
you really think that Robert Laros hallucinated Cardiff taking his oxygen tank?
Really? How does that work?
I think, my I...Your Lordship, I...
no, seriously, how does he hallucinate the loss of his oxygen tank?
it was my contention that he hallucinated its existence in the first place.
if you're going to blame the victim, at least use some better logic.
your Lordship, I object to the tone that this...
this what?
this American lawyer? Is that what you were going to say?
let us take a short break.
demure, huh?
change of plans.
I think I'm having American Revolution fantasies.
that turned me on.
well, I can dress up.
I want to take you now.
well, that might prove difficult.
in my bathroom.
we have ten minutes.
I'll go first.
will, we're being watched.
where is that book?
to be continued.
we can't do that. - I know.
he said it was about Lemond Bishop.
they wanted to make sure none of our billing came from drug money.
it's like putting a bull's-eye on our back for the IRS.
I know. Do you think he's after us?
Florrick? I don't know.
glenn Childs was this close to a RICO charge.
maybe Florrick's taking up the hunt.
you really think he would do that to his wife's firm?
I think he's ting to run a clean office.
what if we offer to open up our books to an independent accounting firm?
Florrick might just be looking for a gesture like that.
I think if he's serious, it's worth a try.
but let's not expose ourselves on a subway platform unless we have to.
well, what a colorful and pointless metaphor.
thank you. It's the Brits.
I think I'm picking up their accents.
I noticed. It really classes up the joint.
and here's Mr. Gunn meeting outside of his office.
and here. is the SUV license plate.
here it is driving away.
and here is the occupant.
Harold Burke? - Yup. Ex-senator.
here's a photo of him with his family.
any whiff of a scandal?
here's the children's nanny.
you're kidding.
here's a photo of her leaving work.
here's a photo of Mr. Burke leaving work.
and here is a photo of them...
at their destination.
nicely done. - Thanks.
how do I know you?
you don't.
and yet, you look so familiar.
I just have one of those faces.
I'll need you again. - Then invoice.
grace, set the table, please.
dad. - Yeah?
why is Mom doing this? - Doing what?
kicking you out.
we're just getting back to normal.
I don't get it.
what did your mom tell you?
she said that she wanted to make e marriage work, but it didn't.
you don't kick someone out for no reason.
I wasn't always good to your mom, Zach.
but that was a long time ago. And she stayed.
it wasn't just...
there were other things.
what do you mean? - I mean...
I hurt your mom with other things.
with someone else?
I think we should just leave it at that.
dad, there's sething wrong with the computer.
okay. Let's have a look.
so where are you from, Mr. Brannon?
I'm sorry, where am I from?
Yes. County Cork? County Clare? Tipperary?
have a bit of an ear for accents.
I'm just trying to place your Irish brogue.
county Kerry.
a bit of the old potato famine emigration, was it?
well, fair play, lad.
and good luck to you, me boy.
what's his anagram? - Jams her tush.
there is this inbred deference I have to greater rank.
Yeah, I know. Me, too.
Really? You don't seem so.
I'm trying very hard to change. - Yeah.
I'm not well-disposed to change.
no, me neither.
Mandy Cox. I am a music executive working in A&R.
thank you, Ms. Cox.
and you were intending to summit Everest at the same time as the events in question?
Yes, sir. It's always been a dream of mine.
Evest. My mountain.
I've paid two guides over the past two years to get me to the top.
and you observed Mr. Cardiff on the South Col, is that coect?
Yes. Our Sherpa was injured in an icefall the day before, and Mr. Cardiff was kind enough to share one of his with us for the final assault.
so you made the last assault on Everest with Mr. Cardiff?
my goodness, that was not mentioned in Mr. Lambros's book.
there were a lot of things not in Danny's book.
many of us in the climbing community were outraged at the many distortions.
did you ever see Mr. Cardiff step over a body, or take anyone's oxygen tank?
of course not.
as far as I could tell, he was the perfect gentleman.
thank you, Ms. Cox.
ms. Cox, were you sleeping with Mr. Cardiff at base camp?
if I may interrupt.
I might suggest to my learned colleague that these News of the World type smear tactics are beneath the dignity of the court.
I would tend to agree, Mrs. Florrick. I'm sorry.
yes
I know. Where's Kalinda?
my associate, Kalinda arma.
she's been helping me prepare for this meeting.
and these are my associates.
I don't know their names, but they're very expensive.
so let's hear it, Eli. - Three-day plan.
day one: I meet your candidate.
I tell him that scandals are owned by the first man in.
breitbart owned the Weiner scandal.
if Weiner had released those tweets with his spin, he would still be in office today.
day two: I don't ask your candidate to tell me everything, because candidates lie.
I'm falling asleep here, Eli.
but I do tell him we have to get the nanny's story straight so that she doesn't hop off to The National Enquirer.
day three: We acknowledge there is some entertainment value in a father of three sleeping with his nanny.
and the goal is not to smother that value, but to harness it.
that's very interesting. - Thank you.
only problem is it ain't Burke.
Burke asked me to run his campaign, but I said no.
and that's what you saw when you accidentally followed me.
you're lying. - No, I'm not.
and here's the thing...
come on, you follow any candidate, you're gonna find a nanny, a hooker, a mistress or an intern.
but thanks for the pitch, buddy. I'll see ya.
give me one more chance.
okay.
I'm deciding Monday.
there are no other candidates. I checked.
they all have strategists already.
unless we go local.
Nah, nah, he's a national kind of guy.
he may have gone with someone new, but why pick a rotten apple from the tree?
maybe it's a celebrity. - No.
I can't see him tolerating that.
what? - I get it.
he's flipping sides. It's a Republican.
he wanted to play in the presidential primaries.
I'm on it.
mazel tov.
thank you for returning, Ms. Cox. - No problem.
before you went on your climb to Everest, did you have any surgery performed?
no.
what do you mean?
I mean, did you have any surgery performed?
no. What do you mean, like an appendix out?
no. - Or LASIK surgery?
no, I-I thought you meant, like, major surgery.
Yeah, LASIK. That was a while ago.
I had contacts for farsightedness, and I didn't want to deal with them on the mountain.
good.
and did you know that LASIK reacts poorly to decreased atmospheric pressure?
I...
I don't...What are you asking?
I'm asking if you knew that. - No.
the vision of LASIK patients becomes blurry at high altitudes in the weeks following surgery, due to decreased atmospheric pressure.
was your vision blurry, Ms. Cox? - No.
isn't that why you had Mr. Cardiff's Sherpa carry you the last thousand feet up Everest?
that's a lie.
people keep saying that, but I wasn't carried.
your Lordship, this is a sworn affidavit from Tenji Gelu, the Sherpa in question.
now, he swears that Ms. Cox had blurry vision and could not have seen any of the events in question.
he's lying. He was always lying.
he hated me because I accused him of stealing my satellite phone.
your Lordship, given the circumstances, we ask that
ms. Cox be removed from the claimant's witness list.
I would regretfully agree.
I got it.
no, that's okay. - Mom, I got it.
are you okay?
what, because I'm cleaning?
Yes.
you have work. I thought I'd let you do it.
you are so adorable.
come on. You know it's gonna happen, so just let it happen.
good. Thank you.
how's Dad?
he's good. - Are you good with him?
am I?
Yeah. I mean, you know.
what?
do you think I'm like him?
do I think you are?
no. - Really?
you're different.
very different. Why?
I just wanted to know.
I'll get it.
Diane. - Yes.
I'm sorry, Alicia. I'm here, um...
I'm trying to get in touch with Peter, and the office said heas home.
well, no, he's-he's not here.
I'm so sorry, Alicia.
I would, I would never do this to you, but do you have a minute?
we're competing with two other law firms for the state's attorney civil business.
it would be very lucrative, as you know.
but Peter has asked that we be auded by the Department of Taxation.
and that...well, that would be quite invasive.
grace, I'll be there in a minute.
how old? - Fourteen.
that's a sweet age.
anyway, I-I suggested to the state's attorney that we use an independent auditor, but he insisted on a departmental audit.
and that would open up our books in an alarming way.
I'm not sure I...
I checked with the two other law firms under consideration, and they have not been asked to do the same.
so I was wondering, is there something I should know about why Peter's only asking us?
Diane, I've worked hard to keep my home life separate from my work life.
I know, and I respect that.
but I need to know if Peter is doing the same.
I don't know how to answer that.
well, let me ask you this.
if you were assisting me in this decision, how would you advise?
agree to the audit or not?
I would advise you not to.
you really have a very lovely apartment, Alicia.
thank you.
take two.
morning.
so, let's hear what you got.
actually, Ms. Sharma and I discussed it, and we've decided to pass on your polite offer to pitch.
but thank you.
you're kidding me, right? - Nope.
but thanks.
I mean, what the hell is that?
don't you think you could've told me that over the phone?
I could've, but that would've taken up less of yr time.
go to hell.
what's going on? - I don't like being used.
what are you talking about? How did I use you?
you're considering joining a Republican presidential campaign.
no comment. - But the guy's too clean.
you can't find a single thing wrong with him.
he's too good to be true.
I don't know who you're talking about.
okay.
And?
and you didn't have the money to vet him, so you hinted that you wanted to hire me so I would vet him for you.
poor man's crawfishing.
you let the tourist set the bacon trap, and then you go in and raid them.
Yeah, Mickey, uh, tell me the last time you were in the bayou.
so cut the Trapper John crap, okay?
you going to offend me now?
Yeah. I'm just getting started.
okay.
what did you find out? - No.
come on. I'll hire you. - No, here's how it works.
you first offer your services to your Republican, then you hire me.
I already did. He hired me. - Nope.
he's had two meetings, but he hasn't jumped yet.
go get hired.
and you'll work for a Republican?
I don't mind this guy. He's not bad.
okay. I'll call you tomorrow.
no hard feelings, right? - Go.
it's business. - Go!
all right. I'll see you.
I'll be calling on you again.
it's your dime.
Mr. Cardiff, good evening. - Actually, good morning.
Yes. Of course. Good morning.
a year before you climbed Everest, Mr. Cardiff, you successfully summited the Trango Towers in Pakistan. Is that correct?
Trango II, to be exact. - Trango II.
you came upon a team of Japanese mountaineers during that climb, did you not?
let's see. It's, uh...it's been so long.
in fact, you not only came upon them, you took the ropes and pitons from a dying Japanese climber.
if I may quickly ask my learned colleague to which materials he is referring here.
the book, Only in May, the account of a French climbing expedition to the Trango Towers.
Yes, that was my worry.
your Lordship, Mr. Cardiff previously brought suit...
brought successful suit...against the publisher of that very book.
it has been deemed libelous and therefore cannot be mentioned in these proceedings.
well, then, let me ask you this.
in that expedition...the one that I was just talking about...
apologies for interrupting again, Your Lordship, but as part of the successful suit against the aforementioned book,
Mr. Cardiff instigated a superinjunction, which, of course, means not only are we prevented from discussing the book here, we are prevented from even discussing the supposed events alluded to in that book.
come on.
even the request by my learned colleague here must be stricken from the record.
it is as if the book and its events, and even events questiong the events, never happened.
unless, of course, it's discussed in the English press, Your Lordship.
Yes, and we would ask for a superinjunction to prevent the mention of the superinjunction.
only in England.
look, I'm sorry, but that is not necessary.
we need to get that book in. The climb to Trango Towers.
it shows a pattern of abuse.
where are you going? - I have an idea.
no, there's nothing there. I...what am I looking for?
I don't understand what the purpose this whole page is.
Eli, you still have your geek squad together, right?
well, hello, Alicia. How are you?
you still have your Internet trolls who tweet anonymously?
Yeah. Why? What do you need?
I need some tweeting.
the tweeting fairies did their work during the night.
I don't know what you're talking about.
100, 000 tweet followers, Your Lordship.
the superinjunction and Mr. Cardiff's actions are now a matter of discussion in the English press.
this is an obscenity, Your Lordship.
in this morning's Chronicle:
what did Oliver Cardiff do on the slopes of Trango II?
your Lordship, here is the respect for our laws when any young thug with a computer and a Twitter account can circumvent a lawful injunction...
I'm sorry, Mr. Thrush, but I haven't finished.
Yes.
please continue, Mr. Brannon.
the subject of Mr. Cardiff's actions during his Pakistani climbing expedition are now a subject of concern in the English press, Your Lordship.
therefore, I do not need the manuscript of Only in May in order to ask these questions.
we still believe the stricture of the superinjunction applies, Your Lordship.
I did nothing wrong.
you didn't take the rope and climbing gear from the Japanese team on Trango Tower...
Trango II? - I did nothing wrong.
with the Japanese pitons?
we do not use pitons. We're clean climbers.
we use chockstones and quickdraws.
Yes, which you took from a Japanese climber.
he was dying.
the hypocrisy here is amazing.
you, Danny, you were on K2 when a Korean climber died.
I know for a personal fact you passed him on the way to the summit.
that was different. - How was that different?
because he wasn't your brother?
he froze to death, and you left him.
I left him. Every climber left him. And why?
because we would have died carrying him down.
it is the law of the death zone. We all know we can't be carried out.
and so you did it on Everest.
the events as described in Danny's book are a lie.
even though you passed a dying Robert Lambros on Everest?
the book, as told, is a lie.
Mr. Cardiff, are you planning another climbing expedition?
Yes. - When?
don't answer that. - Patagonia, in one month.
your Lordship, there is qualified privilege as an exception to our libel laws.
and what is that, Mr. Brannon?
when they are a warning.
Mr. Cardiff has demonstrated a predisposition for bypassing stranded climbers at altitude.
now, if this book is a warning to climbers in the future, then it is no longer held to the same burden of proof maintained by our libel laws.
I, therefore, ask that this suit be dismissed because this book, Your Lordship, is a warning.
your Lordship, that is a strange interpretation of the law.
no, Mr. Thrush. I'm sorry.
I don't think it's a strange interpretation of the law at all.
in fact, it seems right.
we would agree with Mr. Brannon and therefore dismiss the suit in etter rogatory.
apologies, Your Lordship.
so you decided against an audit.
smart.
have Alicia and her husband separated?
is it any of our business?
if there is blowback on our firm, then yes, it is our business.
is there blowback on our firm?
this is my life. It's yours, too.
have Alicia and her husband separated?
ask her.
we can't be the enemy of the state's attorney.
we're not. - He wanted to audits.
because he wants to run a clean office.
this is crazy. She's supposed to work for us.
if she's working against, we should let her go
she's not.
but if she is? - Then...
we'll let her go.
insufficient Funds
you got any toys?
don't fool with me! You hear me? Open it up!
all right, all right! - Get out the money!
come on! - Man, it's jammed!
stop stalling, man! Stop...Don't you fool with me!
it's okay, I got it, I got it. I got the safe right here, man!
don't you fool with me, man! I'll blast your ass!
Gimme... Gimme the damn money!
Oh, my God. You were in a robbery? Where are you?
at a police station.
I was the only one who saw the robbery. I didn't want you to worry.
Yeah, I'll call you back, honey. Someone's here.
Yeah, please call me back. - Yes. Bye.
it's okay if you want to finish your call.
no, I did. It's the wife, you know. - yeah, I know.
I'm Cary Agos with the State's Attorney's office.
I wanted to thank you for helping us out here.
no problem.
why don't we talk in private? This is kind of a noisy room.
so, we may need you around for trial, Mr. Dolan.
you, uh, found a suspect?
no, no, but if we do, we'll need you around for trial.
were you planning on going anywhere?
me? No. Why?
just you and your wife applied for passports last week.
right.
pretty pricey?
no. No, it's, uh, it's my in-laws.
in-laws.
so...
you told the officer you didn't touch anything in the store, and you were just looking for a squirt gun for your son.
it's his birthday today. Why?
well, it's just...
the police, they dusted for prints, and they found yours on this display here.
Ah, yes.
when I entered the store, I,um,
I was looking at some of the greeting cards.
so you did touch something.
the display, yes. Why?
just trying to figure out what happened.
so you wanted to buy a greeting card, not a toy?
no, I-I wanted to buy a toy. - So why did you touch the cards?
is-is there something wrong?
I don't think so. Is there?
I think I'd like to leave now.
I'm afraid I can't allow that, Mr. Dolan.
Why?
we're holding you for investigation.
Mr. Dolan, I'm Alicia Florrick.
are you the public defender?
no, I'm registered with the City Bar's Pro Bono Program.
they referred your case. But if you'd prefer a public defender.
no. This is crazy. - I know.
I saw a robbery and they think because my fingerprints were on a display that was thrown down, that I did it.
well, actually, Mr. Dolan, the police have an eyewitness who saw you struggle with the clerk and shoot him.
that's not true. I don't...
okay, listen, don't say a word to anyone. Okay?
will you call my wife? They took my cell.
actually, don't call her. I'll call her.
okay.
so are you following me now?
just going where the pro bonos take me, Cary.
I don't suppose you'd let me question him more.
I mean, he's innocent, right?
thank you, Mr. Boylan. Are you ready?
I guess I am. - Okay, send the first one.
you take all the time you want.
hello.
may I help you? - No, I'm good.
there's going to be five total.
all right, walk to the line.
turn to your left.
touch the wall.
and turn back.
no. Not him.
send in number two.
walk to the line.
were you wearing those glasses when you saw the murder?
Yeah.
turn to your left.
no, definitely not. He was much thinner than that.
okay, send in number three.
number three, step forward.
stop on the line.
look in the lens.
don't move.
that's him.
are you sure?
that's the man you saw struggling with the cashier, and firing two bullets into his head?
Yes. Definitely.
head back in, number three. Thank you.
Travis Dolan, an unemployed former Parks employee.
he's broke, about to be evicted.
he's Mr. Everyman, except this Everyman walks into a convenience store to rob it.
doesn't count on the cashier having a gun.
shoots him, kills him.
sees a passing patrol car pulling up.
puts his gun down, hides in the back of the store, pretending to be a witness.
prints on the gun?
no usable prints, but a solid eyewitness.
no cash taken?
didn't have time.
the patrol car surprised him.
there was a struggle, right?
during the commission of a robbery.
you want second degree?
offer second degree, I'll take it to him.
once again, I look for my liaison, but where is she?
and once again, I have a job that sometimes takes me, oddly, out of the office.
so what, I handle this meeting on my own, is that it?
you do. You're a big boy, Eli. And Will and Diane don't bite.
Yeah, it's not them I'm worried about.
okay, so here's my advice, Eli: don't bite them. Okay?
always the level headed one.
okay. I need you to work with me full-time.
Really? - Yes.
I need investigator time.
the law moves slow; I move fast.
I'm managing three campaign crises right now, and the cheese lobby has just taken me on full-time.
Yes, the cheese lobby.
you're fast, you're a pro. I need you full-time.
they won't let me be full-time.
that's why I'm telling them.
I don't like sharing.
and between you and me, and whoever else you tell once I ask you
I need someone as investigator when I leave here.
for opposition research.
that's not going to happen.
it is going to happen, because I'm going to make it worth your while.
more money, more power, more self-reliance.
Hello, Eli. How are you? - Great. Good.
will, how are you? - I'm good, Eli. Always a pleasure.
Julius Cain, head of litigation. - Nice to meet you.
so, I've hit the ground running, as I'm sure you're well aware, and now I think it's time to take a breath and reassess.
No! Ten minutes!
and I need both Alicia Florrick and Kalinda
what's your last name again? - Sharma.
sharma, dedicated to my department full-time.
lobbying and crisis management are a 24/7 business, and I need 24/7 dedication.
no.
anything else?
am I making you money? - You are.
am I encouraging clients to keep political business in-house?
you are.
then I can't be splitting Alicia and Kalinda's time with Legal.
Alicia is supossed to be at this meeting. Where is she?
she's on a case, a case that makes us money.
why don't we discuss this, Eli?
we take your concerns very seriously.
he'll stay because it's in his interest to stay.
it's only in his interest to stay if we encourage cooperation.
he doesn't want cooperation. - Look at the numbers, Will.
the dairy people bring in almost a as much as we lost last year.
but at what cost? If we dedicate Alicia to Eli,
what are we pulling them from? How much money are we losing?
well actually, at the moment Alicia is working on a pro bono.
okay, why are we still doing pro bonos?
because we're still a member of...
and why am I the only one who's worried about the economy?
we are heading into a double-dip recession without a bankruptcy department, without tax lawyers, and our lawyers, some of our best lawyers, are busy doing pro bono?
I need to talk to you. - About?
things.
the players. The political crosscurrents.
Really? You seem smart enough to figure that out.
I'm smart enough to know I need your help figuring it out.
we've expanded, Will, beyond our means.
Yes, we're one of the few all-service firms left standing, but we did it at a cost, and we can't continue this way.
what way? - We need bankruptcy.
if there's one department that'll survive a double-dip recession, it's bankruptcy.
to build one from the ground up would take time, but luckily enough, we can acquire one off the shelf.
how?
there's a firm breaking up:
malpractice is going one way, acquisition another, bankruptcy, I just found out, is going with litigation.
no. - Yes.
you need to talk to her. - We already said no.
we already said no when we thought it was just litigation.
if it's litigation and bankruptcy...
then you talk to her. - No.
everybody's going to be vying for her bankruptcy department.
we need someone who has a preexisting relationship.
I don't even know where she is.
the Midwest Bar Association.
Celeste Serrano is doing a seminar in Dispute Resolution.
get us bankruptcy, and we won't have to dance to the tune of Eli Gold.
have you noticed, no matter how high we go, we're still dancing to someone's tune?
welcome to leadership.
I don't want to see any lawyers pushing off their CLE hours.
guess who's in town? The Midwest Bar Association.
that's right. That's right. Just get it over with.
I have one more item I want to talk about.
the Department of Justice has identified certain
and I'll use their word-- "biases" in how we plea bargain.
so I've agreed to the government's request to detail an AUSA to this office.
not to monitor us, but to work with us, and be as one of us.
so please welcome Imani Stonehouse. Imani.
hello.
you're all under arrest.
okay, let's get going.
Imani, I'd like you to meet Cary Agos.
he'll be showing you the ropes.
he already has. Maximum sentence to a black drug dealer.
discount to a white killer.
okay. We're off to a great start.
the white defendant-- he had no priors.
and no crack.
Oh, yeah. Yep, you got me there.
big bad white prosecutor out to put down the black man.
and black woman.
will Gardner. What the hell are you doing here?
I've got 30 hours of CLE like everyone else.
well, come on up to the 34th floor if you want to continue that legal education.
strippers and Acquisitions.
maybe later.
the Globalization of Crime
so, um...
based on this, um, I believe, um...
it's not just, uh...
should have known you'd be here.
he's amazing, isn't he?
the criminal mind...
Yeah.
you always hated him. - Nope.
just thought he was a bad boss.
you were jealous.
of...?
you did not.
after the staff meeting on 9/11. Remember? He was in tears.
you slept with him?
we didn't do much sleeping.
Oh, oh, okay, you can stop now.
you found out it wasn't only litigation.
the bankruptcy is coming with me.
so you here to charm me? - To offer you a home.
and what about your lawyer friend Alicia Florrick?
why isn't she here to charm me, too?
what are you looking for?
to come to Lockhart/Gardner?
a three-year commitment to litigation.
come on.
and a five percent bump in salary and a 50/50 split on the Hammett Aerospace.
the jetliner crash? No.
Mr. Osterman. Remember me? Celeste.
Yes. How are you? - In Baltimore?
Oh, my goodness, yes. Excuse me.
a three-year commitment to litigation, a five percent bump in salary and we'll call it a day.
we have other suitors. - I'll talk to Diane.
until the economy improves, we're calling a halt to pro bonos.
plead out the ones you've got, then we need everyone full-time, back in the office.
Cary's resisting a plea.
what's on the table? - Second degree. 20 years.
for a murder with an eyewitness? Sounds like a worthy offer.
the client's resisting.
okay, I'll help out there. You want me to talk to Legal Aid?
no, I'll do it. I at least owe them an explanation.
Yeah. Will. Where are we?
she wants 50% on her jetliner class action.
she has the crew, we've got the passengers. 35%. Maybe.
okay, tell Celeste 35%.
the way you usually do-- your charm.
I believe in you.
Bye.
she's playing hard to get.
Mr. Dolan, how are you?
I'm okay, thank you. I just, uh...
I'm so sorry.
no. We love you.
can I, uh... - No, not yet. No contact.
Jakie, this all just a big mistake, all right?
I'll be home soon and we'll celebrate your birthday, all right, kiddo?
daddy loves you very much.
come on. No record. Not even a parking ticket.
that's why I offered second degree.
shave off another five years.
you haven't met my workmate, have you?
she's an AUSA to make sure there's no racial imbalance in plea bargaining.
so that's what's going on here?
you're hard bargaining for, what, appearances?
I don't think it's just appearance, do you?
I think it's another state's attorney preoccupation.
forgotten in a month.
I think he liked you.
what's the plan?
turn the preliminary hearing into a poor man's deposition, get the prosecution to show their hand?
judge isn't going to let that happen.
all rise! The Honorable Francis Flamm presiding.
no, no. Everybody sit down, please.
justice Tie-Dye?
Evelyn made a great zucchini bread, if anybody wants.
Evelyn, quiet, hand it around. Come on.
Chicago Legal Aid Society offer her flex time. The option to telecommute.
tell her we'll find her a corner office.
we're out of corners. Where are you, football game?
Yes, my midday treat to myself. No. Legal Aid.
come on, Diane, you don't have to break up in person. Just make a call.
Mr. Coyne, please. Tell him it's Diane Lockhart.
Yeah, well, that was the plan, but my guilt was getting to me.
guilt is for the weak.
go-- sweeten our offer.
the cashier pulled this gun from a holster he had under the counter.
then they just started firing.
and you were standing 20 feet from the window.
and how far was the shooter inside the store?
your Honor, again, objection. This is a preliminary hearing.
the defense is using this as a poor man's deposition, to get a preview of our case.
Yep. Heard it the first time, Counselor.
got it. Overruled.
and how far was the shooter inside the store?
he's killing us. - Get used to it.
ten feet, probably?
so, 30 feet in total?
20 feet to the window, ten feet inside.
was he on the sidewalk or in the parking lot?
and so I'm curious, Mr. Boylan, were you on the sidewalk in front of the store, or in the parking lot?
on the sidewalk.
on the sidewalk.
Yep, I can see into the store. There's no reflection problem.
where did he say the shooter went?
where did shooter go?
where did this person go after you saw him shoot?
back into the store to hide.
so you saw him hide?
no, I'm just...
he went toward the rear of the store.
so maybe the real robber went out the back door.
Objection!
it's one exit. Punch-key lock. You need to know the code to get out.
damn.
detective, have you heard of cross-racial identification?
I have.
but you don't give it much credence.
well, do I think that some whites tend to misidentify black suspects because they have trouble distinguishing features-- yes.
but the eyewitness here was black and the accused white.
and have you seen studies that blacks often misidentify whites?
I haven't, but I'll take your word for it.
didn't Mr. Boylan give a more general description of a white suspect, before he saw my client at your desk, being questioned?
are you talking about the artist's sketch?
I wasn't.
but sure.
continue, please.
and this artist sketch was done prior to Mr. Boylan's seeing my client in the police station?
Yes, but I wouldn't call the description "general " .
isn't it possible that Mr. Boylan only fixated on my client as the shooter, because he saw him being questioned by police?
and couldn't this sketch direct you to the real killer?
no. We have the real killer.
your Honor, defense asks for access to this sketch.
seems like a reasonable request. Counselor?
any trouble getting it to them?
any more questions? I got to get back to work.
Yeah, so you were here yesterday during the shooting.
Yes. It was crazy. The cops got here really fast.
people running around, screaming...
and did you see anyone who looked like this, running around, screaming?
I thought they caught the guy who did it.
no.
I don't know. This looks like a hundred people.
do you mind?
sure.
Yeah. Try and get the crime scene photos.
cops aren't giving me access.
we also would suggest, Your Honor,
they do have access, Your Honor, in discovery.
which we always get at the last minute.
because we have to prepare them, so it takes time.
well, who prepares it, Counselor?
give me their number.
maybe they can expedite it.
Tim, listen-- can you find out who bought a lottery ticket from its bar code?
you do know you're in the criminal law mixer?
I like criminal.
the men are so...straight.
so we're fine with a three percent bump and a two-year commitment to your litigators.
do you know what it means to feed the rat, Will?
do I...? No.
you can live your sweet little domesticated life.
you can date your cute little apple-cheeked lawyer.
Apple-cheeked?
but eventually, you have to feed the rat.
return to the wild. - that's fascinating.
we're not going above three percent.
you need to feed the rat, Will.
you are killing yourself trying to be normal.
I am normal.
Mr. Florrick, hi. Big fan. - Hello.
I came here especially hoping to bump into you.
I think you know Will Gardner.
Yes, I do. Hi, Will. - Peter.
you two have so much in common, don't you?
we do have a lot in common.
and how do you two know each other?
us? We...
worked at the same firm together long time ago.
we did a lot more than that.
the Baltimore firm: Osterman, Lee, Canfield. It was my first job out of college.
my first threesome was with Will.
that's true. - What was her name again?
well, you have to start somewhere.
so Alicia Florrick, huh?
well, she works with Will, she's married to you.
must be quite an arrangement. Discuss.
it is quite an arrangement. Yes.
any awkward moments?
you mean besides this one?
how many kids do you have, Peter?
two. Boy and a girl.
I love boys and girls.
that's very domestic.
what ages? - 16 and 14.
Oh, that's a very good age. Isn't that a very good age, Will?
me, I don't get kids.
I mean, I get why they're important, but...
you get them if you got them.
Really? I don't know. I'm too selfish.
have you ever met his kids?
no, I haven't. - Really?
Alicia never brought them to work?
I think I'll head out.
it's good to see you, Peter. - Yeah.
who did you say you were with again?
the Lottery Control Board.
a lottery ticket was paid out yesterday for five dollars.
it should have been $500.
well, that's my receipt all right.
but I bought it as a gift for my son.
Where's your son?
Oh, he moved back here-- home-- few months ago.
lovely.
Mrs. Silvestre, may I use your bathroom?
Hi, dear. Did you have a nice day?
there's a young lady here for you. - Who?
she's from the Lottery Control Board. Where is she?
Hello?
Hello?
I feel like you're cheating on me.
only for money. - You think that makes it better?
between Will and Diane, who holds more power?
it's equal.
it's never equal. - Yeah.
Diane has more power in criminal, and Will in civil.
but Diane controls the purse strings.
only by default. Will hates dealing with it.
but if Will says no, is it real?
often.
you're not helping much. - Darn.
and this Julius guy-- what about him?
he's head of litigation. - He doesn't like me.
why doesn't he like me?
you're the new and shiny thing.
does it matter that he doesn't like me?
no.
anybody else with power?
david Lee, family law.
and Alicia-- where does she stand in all of this?
yes?
she's only a third-year associate, but she matters.
because of her husband? - Various reasons.
she can persuade people.
people, as in Will?
what are you looking for, Eli? - The hierarchy.
usually, I can figure it out, but this place is like a mom-and-pop store.
it's all Will and Diane.
if you want to persuade Diane, you persuade David Lee.
if you want to persuade Will, you persuade Alicia.
and here comes your next customer.
okay. Where are we?
according to the time-coded register receipt here, this lottery ticket was redeemed seconds before the murder.
whose ticket? - Mitch Silvestre.
he's a manager from a fish market across the way.
as you can see, there is a slight resemblance between him and the artist sketch.
can you get more on Silvestre?
I'm on him. - Good.
we need to delay in court.
what are you doing?
I'm working on a pro bono. What are you doing?
I don't know. Whoring myself out.
sort of miss you. - I sort of miss you, too.
well, what can we do about that?
I don't know. What do you want to do?
let me call you back. - I'll be here.
okay. Love you.
I said that... - I know.
no, automatically. Mechanically. I didn't mean anything.
will, don't worry about it.
I... it's not that I don't care.
will, call me later. - Right. Good-bye.
I'm sorry, okay? Don't pout. - I'm fine.
but you're not accepting my apology. What do I got to do?
bring us bankruptcy. - Okay, I'll come clean.
you're not chasing me, Will. I'm chasing you.
you're chasing me? - Yes.
how you doing that?
litigation and bankruptcy are, in fact, leaving the firm. That is true.
so is tax and family law. And we're all regrouping.
as what, a jazz combo? - No, as a new firm.
and we want you.
Celeste, I know you're a dreamer, and I know you like to live in your head, but what in your wildest dreams would make you think I would leave my firm, one of the most prestigious in Chicago, to come work for what is basically a start-up?
cause I have the one thing I know you want.
what? - Can't even guess?
I can't even begin to guess.
I'm happy where I am. - Baseball commissioner.
it's the one thing George W. Bush wanted more than the presidency.
don't play games with me. - I'm not.
the league's our biggest client.
commissioner is getting on in years. He needs a successor.
the successor's going to come from our firm.
you know baseball. You know the law.
I don't believe you.
call some friends, Will. You know who to call. Look at me.
I'm not making this up.
when I go all in, it's not with a stone-cold bluff.
I got my dispute resolution seminar in ten minutes.
if you want to discuss how this will work, stop by.
not Judge Powers, Judge Romano! And tell her the brief is on its way.
all right, got it! - Sorry about that.
been in court all day. - No problem, Mr. Coyne.
Maggie, hold all calls, give me about five minutes.
you were a litigator at Portman & Michaels.
partner track.
dropped out. Couldn't stand all the meetings.
next door down, man. - Thanks.
thank you for picking up the slack on the convenience store shooting.
I hear you have two lawyers on the case?
I...Really?
it's good to see, considering all the firms that are pulling back these days.
the Hanley deposition's over there.
Yes, well, actually...
I need to talk to you about this, uh...
guys, it's a go on the Packer appeal.
see if you can pull up some U of C intern time.
ties? Gentlemen, you go to court, you wear a tie.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I know this, uh...
might not be a great time for this but we have to, um...
our firm is bowing out of our pro bono obligations.
just till things pick up. You know, the economy.
I get it. Don't worry about it.
thank you for fighting for us, anyway.
well, I mean we hope to return when things improve.
it's okay. We're not sure we'll be here. We lost our funding.
You...what, your state funding? - Yeah.
budget crunch. - So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know. You know, we still have a few options, so...
such as? - Such as knocking on a few doors.
yelling at a few rich people.
one thing I've learned in the not-for-profit world is that eventually, someone steps up.
well, I-I should go. - Yes, thanks.
you know, it's good to finally meet you in person.
and you.
I wish, uh...
I don't know what I wish.
the world were different.
that sounds good! I'll be here waiting.
will Gardner, what the hell took you so long?
come on in. You don't want to miss the Q and A.
no, thanks. I'm looking for, um, dispute resolution, neutrality something or other.
next door on the right.
look who's here. Saved you a seat.
do you need help?
yeah?
I'm on him now.
easy does it. Meeting at 6 pm
alcoholics Anonymous?
Yeah. Mitch goes to meetings twice a week.
what about the cash in the envelope?
legit. He was chapter treasurer.
he likes to bet at the track, but it was all of his own money.
still doesn't mean he wasn't the killer.
Yeah, but this does.
I checked the register at the convenience store. It's an hour fast.
it could be an accident, or it was monkeyed with to run a lottery scam.
it still puts him at the store an hour before the murder.
we can still tell a story.
the guy worked a few doors down. He knew the code to the locks.
a 30-year-old who likes to gamble.
whose financial situation is bad enough it forces him to move home.
I appreciate that we're trying to find a fall guy, but putting this on an innocent man?
isn't that how our client got into this mess?
we're defending our client.
all rise!
the Honorable Francis Flamm presiding.
well, good morning, everyone.
it's good to see you all here again.
and I see we've grown by one at the defense table.
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
I've been so moved by the plight of Mr. Dolan that I have decided to lend my assistance.
well, it's great to have you in my court, Ms. Lockhart.
and I understand your team would like to argue a motion to dismiss.
Yes, Your Honor.
the prosecutor has built this case on one weak reed: a single eyewitness.
an eyewitness who was 30 feet from the crime and who only identified our client after seeing the police questioning him.
Mr. Dolan has no record.
he has a wife and a son who are here in this court right now.
he is an innocent man, Your Honor.
and it would be unjust not to dismiss these charges.
let me.
let you, what? - Argue.
your Honor, injustice comes in all shapes and sizes.
it's not just in the man held, it's also in the man released.
my grandfather once said, a judging brain requires a listening ear.
I think that was true then, but it's doubly true now.
you need to hear our full case before you can decide.
to dismiss before you hear would be an injustice.
your grandfather is the Reverend Roy Stonehouse?
he is, Your Honor.
well, I'm honored. How is he?
he's good.
recovering.
well, please tell him how greatly he's admired.
my first thesis I wrote was on Selma.
I'll tell him.
and convey my respect, as well.
we all owe men like your grandfather a huge debt.
but let's not forget that this case is about an innocent man.
well, I think that still needs to be determined, don't you, Counselor?
Yes. What I meant, Your Honor...
Yes, it's all right. I know what you meant.
I just think that it would be unjust to summarily dismiss this case before offering a listening ear.
and so, your motion is denied, Ms. Lockhart-- and the other two with you.
we will move directly to trial.
Oh, and, uh, Ms. Stonehouse, thank you.
I have chills.
I don't like to use that much.
does it get you into restaurants?
I'm out. - come on.
not when you're up like that. - Yep, when I'm up like that.
we'll be here tonight. After the Civil Mixer.
I'm fine, thanks.
take you to breakfast? - No.
geez, you sound so definitive. - Yep.
so, I'll hear from you on the baseball commissioner job?
Celeste, no. I didn't like this life, not even when I was living it.
I didn't like not knowing when I was being conned or conning.
you don't think there's a job? - No, I checked.
in ten or 15 years, there's a chance I could vie for baseball commissioner.
what a sad thought that is.
losing what I love now to chase something in the future.
what do you love? You said,Losing what I love now.
my job!
I don't believe you. I don't believe you love it.
what you love is winning.
and you can't win big enough at Lockhart-Gardner.
this is your dream. What happened to pursuing your dream?
what happened to work?
not everybody can pursue their dreams. Someone has to work.
that is so sad. - No. Not really.
take care.
that's the cashier's bay.
and that's where the shooter was. And the line of sight checks out.
I'm not seeing what's good.
the line of sight checks out until the cashier reaches under the counter for the gun.
the wall would've hidden the cashier from view.
and Boylan told the police the cashier pulled the gun from a holster taped under the counter.
but he couldn't have seen him reach under the counter for his gun.
unless he was in the store.
Boylan tried to escape, saw a patrol car pull up, and pretended to be an eyewitness, not a killer.
so, let's go talk to Cary.
only a few more minutes.
I've always waited for bad things to happen. Every day.
Travis sees the good things.
and I'm always waiting for the bad.
well, this is good. - I know.
I don't want to be that anymore.
the worst thing happened, and we're still here.
will you thank the other two lawyers?
I will, but it was really the prosecutor. He reversed himself.
can I...? - Yes.
buddy. How's it going?
yes?
Oh, nothing. I'm, uh, just looking.
an espresso machine would be nice.
the release went well? - It did. You should've been there.
no, I didn't do enough.
how was whoring? - Unproductive.
listen, about what I said yesterday...
will, please. I'm on the phone with my kids and I say,"I love you " ,
and then I'm on the phone with my mother-in-law and I say,"I love you," too.
it's an accident.
Yes. But do you think we should talk?
no, I don't, actually. - You don't?
no.
you sure? - I'm so sure.
I've never been so sure.
I'm not interested in anyone else.
Will...you're talking about it.
no fuss, no muss. - That's me.
Celeste Serrano is forming her own firm.
bankruptcy, litigation, family law.
I don't want to be careful anymore.
I don't want to count every penny and worry more about failing than doing what's right.
okay.
legal Aid is losing its office space.
everybody's pulling back because of the economy.
I want to bring them in-house. There's rooms next to Eli.
he won't like it, but he'll have to live with it until we find more room.
when our lawyers have free time, they can offer it to Legal Aid.
you should've broken up on the phone.
I want to do this.
and I want your okay.
okay.
what is your name? - Ricky Packer. 29 days.
c-could you include the question in the answer, you know?
Yeah, yeah. my name is Ricky Packer.
and I have 29 days left to live.
Ricky Packer Day of excution November 14, 2011
been reading a lot of the Bible-- Job.
when I lie down, I think, how long before I get up?
Yes, Camus says,"Fate is not in man, but around him. "
what is your crime, please?
well, the State says double homicide, but I don't even think they believe that.
they had some bodies they needed to put on someone.
you were saying before I switched on the camera about the authorities.
what is it you were saying?
Yeah, yeah.
I told the guards about this murder that I heard about
Almighty Vice Lords payback on 19th.
there's a dead body buried up there in Douglas Park. You think they care?
no. Why don't they care?
it means more work.
they go dig up some gangbanger's body, what are they gonna do?
they gonna go find the killer?
you got here fast.
Yeah, it's called driving.
What'd you do, stop for hamburgers?
so, what is it, gang-related?
Yep. His tip was accurate.
a tip from death row-- go figure.
John Doe buried six months.
one other thing, Mr. Deputy State's Attorney.
yeah?
you missed a button.
thank you, ASA Lodge.
do we know his colors?
22nd Disciple.
an Almighty Vice Lords reprisal?
well, that's the thinking.
but oddly enough, that's not why you're here.
they dug up someone else.
a citizen? - With very expensive taste.
ed says those are Christian Louboutin shoes.
ed knows that?
the purse still had $300 cash in it.
name on the driver's license was Adrianne Iver.
a missing person for six months now.
and guess what else we found in her purse.
her boyfriend's number.
how long?
they'll be here in 20 minutes.
so what do I do? - Just what they ask.
you will be processed, photographed and fingerprinted.
they will take away all your clothes and supply you with a Department of Corrections jumpsuit.
our hope is you'll get bail.
you have ties to the community, and the evidence is circumstantial.
I loved her.
I mean, we argued, but I loved her.
I-I didn't report her missing because Adrianne said she was going back to Canada.
Alicia. It's important.
okay, the key thing here is to let us do our job.
what's that about?
he's being charged with murdering his girlfriend.
what's important?
my computer's acting up again.
Yeah, I know that doesn't quite sound as important.
Really?
I need you in this meeting, too.
okay, I have a meeting. You got to go.
you should've told Mom no. - I did tell her no.
that's not what she said.
she said you vetted her and everything was all right for her to run.
why is it that every other kid in the universe knows about computers except you?
your mom's a politician now.
she's adapting the truth for her needs.
you know who gets hurt in all this? The children.
they'll talk about your divorce and how I'm the product of a broken home.
and how I'm dating a Communist.
Bob's a Communist? - Ben.
and I broke up with him. This is a new one. Hal.
do you date anyone with more than one syllable?
it makes our conversations very confusing.
didn't I say I had a meeting?
tell Mom not to run.
you tell her. She'll listen to you. I'm not the one...
Hey, old man, how you doing?
so, I got to head off to meet the candidate.
where are we? - A hiccup.
actually, more than a hiccup.
you said he was clean, Eli.
I want to run him for lower office and gear up for the 2016 presidential.
he was. Financials are healthy, no affairs, good to his kids.
wow, you're bringing in Saint Alicia.
this must be serious. - More than serious.
we're dealing with the ridicule factor.
is that a picture?
that's something else.
well, Giuliani dressed up in women's clothes.
he survived that. - This is different.
okay, all right. What do you need?
bring him in. We'll talk about how to handle it.
will she be here?
Alicia. And yes, I will be in the meeting.
he's got kids.
he's gonna want to know how this'll impact his kids.
understandable. - You think we can survive it?
I think if we're lucky.
so what's going on here?
heard you were under investigation.
you heard we're under investigation?
I heard the firm's under investigation.
look, I don't want to drag my candidate in here and have this firm be under indictment.
no, uh, w-we're good.
we're growing and, uh, we're-we're blooming.
aren't we good? - Yes. Better than ever.
a rumor is often a sign of jealous competitors.
hello.
Hi.
we haven't met. ASA Dana Lodge. - Kalinda Sharma.
I was just trying to...
snake the Adrianne Iver crime scene photos?
want to see? - Sure.
Adrianne Iver, a 28-year-old flight attendant, quit her job after her boyfriend proposed.
Oh, wait. You represent her boyfriend, don't you? Tom LaVere?
why, yes, we do.
what a coincidence.
they fought, Adrianne tried to leave, that didn't end well.
Tom shot her with his Walther P99 handgun.
which was never recovered.
Yes, so few criminals make it easy for us these days.
Mr. Lavere buried the body in a dirt lot near Douglas Park six months ago, far from prying eyes.
and as luck would have it, this very same lot was chosen by an Almighty Vice Lord to bury a 22nd Disciple.
so when we dug up one, we dug up the other.
so you and Cary?
me and Cary? - You and Cary.
I don't think there is a me and Cary.
my mistake.
now, uh, Mr. Lavere, our client, he was worried about Ms. Iver's safety.
they were burglarized the week prior, so he gave her his handgun for protection.
and it was the same handgun that she kept in her glove compartment.
Really? - Yeah.
so here's just another possible scenario.
ms. Iver was driving when she came across a gangland slaying.
happens all the time.
when she reached into the glove compartment for the Walther P99, she was stopped by your Almighty Vice Lord, who took the gun...
and shot her with her own gun?
Yeah.
so, in your scenario, what happened to her car?
gone. Taken by the killers to a chop shop.
these are two connected murders.
you solve this, you'll know who killed Adrianne Iver.
only problem: We solved this murder.
a gang sweep. Maurice Johnson, aka AKA.
Yeah, it makes things hard when their akas are AKA.
what did he do, confess?
we ask that Mr. Johnson be tried as an adult, Your Honor.
your Honor, Maurice has come forward on his own.
he has confessed to this homicide exactly because he wants to remake his life.
you don't believe him?
I tend not to believe 14-year-old lieutenants who confess.
but maybe that's just me.
well, you bring me proof of the opposite, I'm all ears.
but we closed two murders.
aka killed the 22nd Disciple banger.
Tom Lavere killed his girlfriend.
where do I bring the proof?
where? - Yeah. Do you have a card?
Yeah. Sure, Kalinda. Here.
and this is my cell. So, anytime.
Thanks.
we have a problem.
they think they've resolved it.
got it. We're with the filmmaker now.
so, how did the police get involved?
you see, I sent the footage to the police.
I did not think they would pursue it.
they dug up two bodies. - Yes, I know.
it is now part of my documentary. Quite exciting.
do you plan to interview Ricky Packer again?
unfortunately, they have now limited access to death row.
did he say anything more about this murder, André?
anything more in your footage?
he did. I-I showed it to the police, but, they are uninterested now.
can we see it? - Of course.
well, I interviewed Mr. Packer again, after they found the body.
it is always good to go with my assistant.
he likes the pretty women.
you say you know who killed him?
who killed this man? - Yeah.
but why am I gonna help the cops?
why would you not?
look, man, the cops don't care if they got the wrong one.
vice Lords are gonna do what they always do:
send up some wannabe gangster to go do a juvie rap.
cops will be happy.
and that was the end. No more interviews.
he didn't say who did it?
great. The only one who can help our client is being executed in 36 hours.
I can't do this.
I can't go back to jail.
it was just the bail hearing.
Tom, listen to me. We have a lot of options.
I can't last till trial. I can't wait six months.
let's go. - Listen to me.
we are not delaying this to trial.
we're doing everything we can, okay?
time's up.
is that all you have, Mr. Coyne?
that is only part of what we have, Y-Your Honors.
Mr. Packer will be executed in approximately 30 hours, and we ask that you look carefully at the legal mistakes made by the trial judge.
look again at the legal mistakes?
Yes. If it pleases the court.
we'll take that under advisement.
you here to help?
well, it's a bit more complicated than that. - Try me.
we need to get to Ricky Packer before he's executed.
we think he can help us on a case.
you're kidding. - No, I'm afraid not.
can you get us in to him? - We can't even get in to him.
unless the judges hear our appeal, he's in 24-hour lockdown.
you have another appeal coming up?
lack of mitigation at trial, yeah.
Why?
so, we have the humanitarian appeal and not much time.
Alicia, you've dealt with Judge Glendon before.
Yes. He has the swing vote on the court.
he sided with us on another death row appeal.
he had a religious conversion, so there might be an opening there.
and my people-- we're scouring Ricky Packer's life for any shred of humanitarian appeal...
Alicia, you work with them, and Lockhart/Gardner, remember, we win this appeal, we question Ricky Packer...
and that helps our client?
packer helps us find Adrianne Iver's murderer.
it's like a Rube Goldberg defense.
well, it'll do until we have better.
so, we will work a two-pronged strategy.
Kalinda, anything you can get independently on who killed this 22nd Disciple victim...
I have access to the State Attorney's office again, - so, I'll see what I can get. - Good.
and again, the immediate push has to be on this appeal.
we lose Packer, we lose the key to the real murderer.
Alicia, if you have a moment? - Sure.
sorry to make that sound so boss-like.
no. It's been hard to get away.
it has.
Diane's been eyeing us like we're a lawsuit waiting to happen.
it's getting a bit complicated, isn't it?
it is.
do we need to...pause?
do you want to pause?
I'm afraid even if we say we will, we won't.
that sounds right.
this is not why I called you in here.
I know.
it's like Grand Central Station, isn't it?
go ahead. We'll talk later.
what does Peter know?
about us?
I-I don't think anything, but that's never mattered to him. Why?
no reason. - Did he talk to you?
no.
look, I appreciate that you guys have to do your due diligence here, but,
I'm not a ticking time bomb.
I don't have an intern.
I love my wife, I love my kids.
Mrs. Florrick, hello. Robert Mulvey.
how's your husband?
he's very well, thank you, sir.
so you're here to, uh, hand-hold me through this scandal?
anything you need.
do I need a stiff drink?
you guys had me scared.
is that you, sir? - Yeah.
but about ten years ago. Winter break.
you guys are joking, right?
it's the ridicule factor, sir. Like Anthony Weiner.
Yeah, but Anthony Weiner took his clothes off and photographed himself for his constituents. This is...
you fellating Santa.
I have to be blunt, sir, because that's how TMZ is gonna report it,
fox is gonna repeat it, and Jon Stewart is gonna finish it
here Comes Santa.
is it possible you were changing a lightbulb?
what, between his legs?
look, it was a joke. I was a college kid.
Yes, but it's a joke about you fellating Santa.
and Santa's expression does not help.
what do you think?
I think...
you have the advantage of releasing it yourself and taking some of the sting away, which is why you should take this seriously.
you think we should release it?
it's coming out either way.
the only thing you can control is when and what it means.
what it means?
you're the Facebook generation, sir.
every candidate under 40 has some dumb photo from some dumb college buddy.
krystal Ball and the reindeer nose.
well, she lost. - Yes.
but she didn't release it. You will.
my kids... my wife seeing this.
go talk to them and make them understand.
I need to think about this.
one more thing, sir.
are there any more photos out there?
of this? - No. Of you, in front of...other statues?
funny college stunts sometimes get repeated.
thank you, sir. I'm sorry.
ain't ever easy, is it?
so what, do you work here now?
no, they're just having trouble with their computers.
they spend, like,$85, 000 on IT when I can just do it in a few hours.
humble much?
to be accurate, that was me making fun of the law firm, not me, - you know, taking credit... - Are you still talking?
you're boring me.
hello.
Marissa, do you have a moment?
dad. I do...in a moment.
why don't you let Zach do his work?
I'm letting Zach do his work. He can multitask. See?
I'm multitasking.
he's watching us.
act like I said something really shocking.
that's terrible.
I've done bad things.
not as bad as the things done to me.
it was a double homicide.
Ricky Packer picked up two 14-year-old girls from a shopping mall, raped them over three days, then slit their throats.
look, we know he's not a saint. All we need is mitigation.
it's just...
my daughter's their age.
I know.
it's our job.
grew up on 24th. Tough neighborhood.
what have you got?
he was born with neuroblastoma, a syndrome requiring a dozen painful surgeries before the age of five.
that's good. We can build on that.
and his mother has not visited him in prison.
bad and painful childhood, absentee mom-- we can work with that.
we need some photos of sadness, squalor.
my mom-- she's always talking about redemption. Right?
but redemption from what?
from being a man?
let's go visit the mom.
you called?
I did call.
I need something.
footage from a blue light camera.
now why would you want access to our antigang cameras?
just one in particular. 19th and Troy.
we have the killer. - No, you don't.
okay, I give you access, you give me access.
to what?
your boss, Will Gardner.
what do you need? - Access.
Why? - We're investigating him.
for what?
I don't think I can do that.
okay, Kalinda, I know how you work.
you get want you want without giving back, and that's just not gonna happen here.
you want your back scratched?
I have an itch.
okay.
what do you need?
he had a friend. A judge. Baxter.
we need to know the nature of their relationship.
get me the blue light camera.
get me the backstory on Will.
I asked first.
Where'd you get that jacket?
I don't know.
can I look at the label? - Sure.
nice. - Thanks.
breathes.
this is the address? - Yeah.
not much squalor.
thank you for seeing us, Mr. Packer.
we need to offer evidence of mitigation.
show that your son's crimes were a result of...
outside causes, difficulty in childhood, his upbringing.
I'm sorry. I just...It's hard.
father Jim got all the neighbors together, and that helps.
do you have any pictures of Ricky as a child?
we want to show the judges how he grew up.
of course.
so you haven't seen your son in prison?
no. He won't let me.
I keep writing every week, but he won't...
we read that Ricky had a lot of illnesses as a child?
illnesses? - Yes. Operations.
Oh, no. That was his brother, Michael.
he's in New York now. On Wall Street.
he's broken up about this.
what about school? Did he have problems in school?
Oh, yes. Michael was always the weakest.
no. Ricky. - No. Ricky was fine.
we were able to get him into a program at St. Matthew's.
there's Ricky.
that's a lot of presents.
well, we wanted them to have Christmases we never had.
would you excuse me?
we could always say he was too spoiled?
she's a saint.
to have that son-- I don't understand it.
whatever he wanted, she was there.
you think he really did it, he killed those two girls?
Why?
he liked doing mean things. It was fun for him.
is there anything that you can say to help the court at all, anything that would save his life?
he shouldn't be killed.
that was a wash.
do you believe that?
what?
that no matter who he is, no matter what he did, he shouldn't be killed?
Yeah. Don't you?
I saw those photos.
those girls were my daughter's age.
they don't exist anymore.
and to get that call.
to spend every night thinking about your daughter's last breath...
he raped...
did you see what he did with their bodies?
but we don't execute him.
why not?
because it would be wrong.
what day are you looking for?
june 15, the day Adrianne Iver disappeared.
okay.
there you go-- corner of 19th and Troy.
okay. There he is. That's the victim, right?
that's what he was wearing? - yeah. That's his corner.
okay, and that's the night Ms. Iver died?
my guess is there's someone else on the corner the next night.
you want to...you want to see the next night?
if you'd be so kind.
do you know anything about Will Gardner's relationship with Judge Baxter?
they had a falling out.
he was a corrupt judge.
will got him thrown off the bench.
no, our office got him thrown off the bench.
Gardner didn't do crap.
there.
that's the next night? - It is.
you have the wrong man, Dana.
it was a corner fight, and he took the corner.
that's why he killed the 22nd Disciple-- so he could take the corner.
my guess is, that man killed Adrianne Iver, too.
you need to find that man.
your Honors, Ricky Packer is a changed man.
his rehabilitation is a testament to the dignity of the human spirit even in the face of great adversity.
we ask that you show mercy and compassion by sparing his life.
I'm so sorry, ma'am. - That's all right.
is this good? - Yes. Thank you.
Mr. Packer's defense attorney never availed himself of mitigation witnesses during the penalty phase of the trial.
as you can see, there are many people here who would speak to Mr. Packer's...
fine character.
he has changed in prison, Your Honors.
he had an unfortunate upbringing
none of the opportunities that you or I have had.
just listen to his mother
she will speak to how hard it was for Ricky, growing up in their tough South Side neighborhood, how she neglected Ricky as a child, and even now, how she has not seen her son in prison.
imagine being a child in the inner city, with no hope...
I've known Ricky Packer all his life.
I was there at his baptism.
I'm here to say that Ricky Packer's a good person.
he's a redeemable person.
he has been led astray, and I take it as my own person failing that I didn't lead him back.
he's not a good person.
no. I said what I said so he wouldn't be killed.
and it's all right to do that?
nothing is very clean.
the older I get the more I realize that.
what if...
what if it meant releasing him?
then we would be having another conversation.
looks like it worked.
well, they're considering the appeal.
we have a 24-hour extension and access to Ricky Packer.
so, Alicia? Where is Alicia?
I need you to get to Indiana.
André says Ricky Packer likes talking with women, so you talk with Ricky, and we'll work the appeal.
all right, let's get going.
work on the appeal.
Alicia...are you all right doing this, going to him?
I'm all right doing this. It's my job.
okay. Then head out.
just doing homework.
Jennifer's coming over later for tutoring.
okay. I already talked to Zach...
but I'm working on this case, and I don't know what time I'll be home.
so Dad is gonna come over and pick you up and take you to his place, all right?
we can take care of ourselves, Mom.
no. I already talked to Dad.
and lock the door, okay, Grace?
I know sometimes we forget, but just do it.
okay. Is everything all right?
I think so.
you come straight home from school every day, don't you?
mom, you're getting weird. - I know.
I love you. Bye.
Eli Gold and Mickey Gunn.
I think that's the third sign of the apocalypse-- you guys working together.
but only on something we truly believe in.
Yeah.
you know Robert Mulvey? - The ex-congressman.
the one that flipped from Republican to Democrat.
I hear he's looking for a campaign he can win, isn't he?
Mickey represents him.
and we want to offer you a story.
about him? - About Mickey.
it's a sort of think piece about the next generation of candidates.
really! You got a headline for me, too?
your sweat's showing, guys.
we have a picture.
it's not as bad as Anthony Weiner, but in our opinion, it encapsulates the problems of the Facebook-era candidate.
he slept with a campaign worker?
that's him? That's Robert Mulvey?
it is.
you want to hang a lantern on your problem.
hang a lantern on what?
this has nothing to do with Mulvey's policy.
this has nothing to do with his morals.
Really? Servicing Santa's not about his morals?
it ain't the real Santa, it's a statue.
and there is no real Santa, so he wouldn't have a penis.
look, the real story here is Mickey Gunn, and how he deals with a photo that is, admittedly, ridiculous, but is also irrelevant to Mulvey's character.
look, I'm fine.
you want to give me something, give me something, but why don't you put the candidate on?
we'll see what we can do.
incoming call: Marissa
would you excuse me a moment?
so, you want to cancel dinner?
you know me. Flighty.
you want something to drink?
where are you, Marissa?
getting computer advice, Dad. I'll call you later.
how long have your parents lived apart?
I...what do you mean?
don't worry, my dad told me.
when did they split up?
about five months ago.
I'll give you all the tips on how to use it.
parents going through divorce are so guilty.
that's my dad, to come pick me up.
Zach? hello.
grandma.
Peter had to work today, so he asked me to look in on you.
hello. - Hello. I'm Marissa.
are you the new tutor? - No.
I'm Eli Gold's daughter.
Really? And, uh, what are we doing here?
what are we doing here, Zach?
I was just showing her how to change her dad's computer settings.
grace, Grandma's here!
is Grace here?
I thought you were out there trying to save the world.
I was; now I'm here.
you look serious.
an ASA in Peter Florrick's office is asking about your relationship with Judge Baxter.
you in trouble?
I'm in something. I don't know what I'm in.
who's the ASA? - Dana Lodge.
I think she's working with Cary.
is this coming from Peter Florrick?
I think it is.
so it's about his wife?
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
I used to be able to read the political tea leaves, now I can barely tell why people say hello to me in the morning.
then use me.
thought you were an island these days.
no man is an island.
I don't know, Kalinda, this one is tough.
they're coming for me.
did you pay off Baxter? - No.
but I think I know why they think I did.
okay, then ask for my help.
I feel like hugging you.
no, just...just ask for my help.
you okay? - I will be.
you need something?
you discussed with André Bergson, the fimamaker, a murder?
a buried body?
a man becomes very popular in his last hours of life.
you said you know who killed him?
what's your name?
André said to send a girl, didn't he?
Yes.
and here you are.
it would help us greatly if you could tell us who committed this murder.
didn't the cops find someone?
Yes, a juvenile from a competing gang.
but we think it's this man.
Yeah.
can you tell us who this is?
why should I?
we're helping you with your appeal.
we successfully argued in front of the 7th Circuit.
they just like torturing me.
they say they'll reconsider, but I'll be dead come Sunday.
then why not help us?
I heard my mom argued for me.
she did.
and my brother?
it was hard on both of them, but they argued for you.
you get them here...then I'll tell you.
I...I don't know if we have time.
well, make the time.
I'll get them. Just tell me who this is.
who is this, Ricky? Just tell me.
ERVIN Womack, aka Mace. He's your man.
it's just rearranging the desktop, so try.
okay.
Chris, do, uh, do I admit to being young, stupid, even immature?
Yes, but the 21-year- old Robert Mulvey is not the 34-year-old Robert Mulvey.
and you think we shouldn't judge you because it was just this one time?
well, I think you should judge me on what I say and what I do now.
and what if it's more than one time?
these photos were taken on the same winter break, Congressman.
Oh, dear God.
is that you at the National Gallery Sculpture Garden?
don't go there, no, please don't go there.
and is that George Washington?
no.
well, I-I, I don't believe they, um...
I would, I would need to get a closer look.
we need to talk to your politician.
you look serious. - I'm a serious guy.
ERVIN Womack, aka Mace.
I think we should question him for the 22nd Disciple hit.
closed that. - Yeah, with a juvenile.
this guy's adult.
is that what Kalinda said?
you mean your girlfriend Kalinda?
no, I mean yours.
no, don't stop there. You're on a roll.
Yeah, I saw you two-- it looked more than friendly.
really, and what does "more than friendly" look like?
like more than friendly.
Cary, listen to my words now, okay?
I have never said this before, but I am now going to say it for you.
are you ready?
I am not a lesbian.
I know a lot of people who weren't anything until they met Kalinda.
is that why you have a thing for ethnic women?
what? - You still pining for your lesbian?
okay, now you're turning it. This isn't about me.
okay, that's enough for me. Going home now.
you want to question Mace, go for it. You're the deputy.
Kalinda is trying to get to me through you.
Yeah, and it seems to be working.
figure out what you want, Cary, then we can talk.
I don't want her. - Good to know.
what do you know about him?
not much. Alicia got a tip from death row.
you found out something on him?
his description matched another murder.
we just want to question him. Nobody's going in hard.
so you talk to ASA Lodge these days?
Yeah, you, too, huh?
what are you doing?
what am I doing? - Yeah.
don't, okay? Don't.
Cary, look, ASA Lodge approached me.
she gave me her card-- if you have a problem with that, then you need to sort that out with her.
she's not the one I mistrust.
go to hell, Cary. Do you think that...?
you all right? - Yeah, you?
Yeah.
looks like a Walther P99.
that's Tom's gun.
I say this with some trepidation, but a failing is a failing.
I am an alcoholic. - Nice work.
changes the subject. - Thanks.
the only place left to go.
I thought foolishly that I had taken care of my problem, but as all alcoholics know, it's never over, so I'm going back into the program.
all right, so I'll talk to you when he gets out.
Yeah.
I like him. - Not a bad guy.
still room to corrupt him.
I'm thinking of him for state senate first.
S-State senate here?
Yeah, what were you thinking?
I just didn't know you were thinking local.
only as a jumping-off point.
what's wrong, is that too small for you?
my ex-wife is running for state senate.
Really?
well, that's, uh, unfortunate.
Yep.
okay, thanks for your help, buddy.
I'll see you.
he lost the appeal.
execution is going forward.
Suzanne, thank you for coming. We need to hurry.
we got here as fast as we could.
this is Michael. - Yes, come this way, please.
just as you know, Mrs. Packer, he helped us with our case.
we found the real killer, and our client will be freed.
I don't know if that helps.
it helps, thank you.
it's Ricky's mother. Tell them we're coming.
thank you.
he'll be coming out of that door.
we have to stay out here.
he really helped you with your case?
Yes. You sound surprised.
I'm, uh, I know there's supposed to be good in everyone, but sometimes it's just hard to see, so this gives me hope.
here he comes now.
ma.
it's me.
it's Michael.
I'm going away now.
we love you.
I know.
what can we do for you?
burn in hell, both of you.
I want you to suffer every day of your life thinking of me.
Bye, Mom. Love you. It was fun.
Yeah, okay, okay, thank you.
it is the gun, Tom Lavere's gun.
we're releasing him.
you all right?
considering it was my first gunfight.
you?
Yeah, thanks for pulling me down, for protecting me.
what do you want from me, Kalinda?
what do I want from you?
why does everybody always think that I want something?
cause you do.
she's not attracted to women.
Cary, you make me too calculated.
look, I came here, you weren't here, she was here, so I asked her about the case, that's all.
you've got blood on your ear.
under.
I don't like you being in my head.
what?
I said, I don't like you being in my head.
then get me out.
what are we doing? - I have no idea.
what?
may I?
no, sorry. I'm, uh, saving them.
this isn't a game, Mr. Stack.
I didn't say it was.
you're treating it like it is.
I'm treating it with all the respect it deserves.
Mr. Stack? Mr. Dylan Stack?
Yes. Present.
Hi, I'm Alicia Florrick. We spoke on the phone.
Yes. Nice to meet you.
this is a mistake, Mr. Stack.
you walk through that door, we can't help you.
well, what if I walk through that door?
what was that about?
posturing.
before we begin, Mr. Stack, I just want to warn you that we are a full-service firm.
we don't really take walk-ins.
Oh, well, I'm...I'm not technically a walk-in.
I called you. - Yes, ten minutes ago, - saying you were walking in. - Sorry.
I don't like reservations.
I can pay. - For...?
keeping me out of jail.
are you in danger of going to jail? - Yes.
the two men out there are federal agents from the Treasury.
they've been following me for the last two days.
Why?
I won't reveal the name of my client. - Okay.
Oh, no, I-I mean...that's why they're following me.
hello.
if you're agents from the U. S. Treasury and
I ask to see your badges, you have to show me them, correct?
may I see your badges, gentlemen?
actually, could you hold them higher?
I practice digital information law in New York.
the U. S. Treasury wants to arrest one of my clients, a client who asked that I maintain his anonymity.
this is a subpoena to submit to questioning, or be imprisoned for 18 months.
why have you come to us?
to you, actually.
the rumor is you've had your own dealings with the Treasury.
dealings in which you came out the victor.
well, I think that's a bit of an exaggeration.
and as I was saying, we do have a pretty stable client...
I don't like credit cards or checks.
that's a lot of money. - It is.
is it counterfeit? - No, why?
well, the involvement of the U. S. Treasury would suggest some reason for...concern.
no. They're after my client for...something else.
and what is that?
he invented a new currency.
Really?
how did he do that?
he invented Bitcoin.
it's a...digital currency. It's traded and spent online.
Yes. I've read about it.
well, according to the FBI, it is a violation of federal law for individuals to create private coin or currency systems.
I think the Treasury feels... threatened.
Bitcoin? - Yes. It's an online currency.
but he's not going to pay us in Bitcoin, is he?
no, he's got cash. Lots of it, in fact.
I don't know, Diane. It's the U. S. Government.
we swore off these Charge- of-the-Light-Brigade suits.
we swore off the ones based on idealism.
this one has cash.
and I know how that sounds. - Okay.
but let's not stick our necks out too far.
when we poke the bear?
I'm tired. I mix metaphors when I'm tired.
how's it going?
well, she sure is different.
you can always get Kurt Leventhal. I have his number right here.
no. I rolled the dice.
Hey, what time are they...
here they are.
hello.
you have the right to remain silent. - This way.
you visit me in prison?
every Friday.
I'm putting on a good face.
I'm actually kind of terrified.
that makes sense.
I thought you were gonna say something comforting, like,"Don't be.
sorry.
well, I guess the truth is comforting, too.
sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Stack.
we have agreed to take your case.
that's great. Thank you.
but we can't receive the cash. We need a cashier's check.
Yep.
only in America is greater abstraction more desirable.
I am so sorry.
they found asbestos in my office.
this is fine, thank you.
Mr. Gardner, this is a proffer session. It's completely...
would you like something to drink?
no, thank you.
it's completely off the record.
if you give me... - How about you two?
Oh, I'm fine. - No, thank you.
well, do you mind if I have something?
I didn't have breakfast. Oh, and, um...
we have blankets, you know, if anybody's cold.
just one morning shake, please. Thanks.
sorry. Go ahead.
if you supply us with truthful information as to your knowledge about judicial criminal conduct, we'll close this investigation against you.
no grand jury.
does that make sense? - It does.
the...the name of your bookie was was Jonathan Meade, is that correct?
jonathan Meade was the name of a friend of mine who I invited to one of my Wednesday night basketball games.
but he acted as a bookie?
he acted in a lot of capacities.
at one point, he was even an actor.
Really? In what?
I... I don't know, but I think it was a low-budget movie.
a horror movie?
and you witnessed several judges placing bets with Jonathan Meade?
could you be more specific?
regarding? - Which three judges?
excuse me, Ms. Tascioni, this is Mr. Gardner's proffer, not ours.
Oh, yes, I know, but Mr. Gardner needs to know what you're after in order to help you.
there were a lot of judges at this basketball game over the years, and how many of them talked to your actor friend?
quite a few. - You see?
how can we help you if you won't give us any direction on how to help you?
judge Winter, Judge Dunaway, and Judge Parks.
okay, now it's your turn, Mr. Gardner.
did you see Mr. Meade placing any bets or otherwise conferring with these three judges?
I'm sorry. I wish I could remember.
that was a sham.
she played you. - Yes, thank you, Cary.
this investigator that you're cultivating at Lockhart/Gardner?
it's time to stop cultivating, and start planting.
okay.
we need to have a conversation about vulnerabilities.
here's the difficulty: I don't know where I'm vulnerable.
well, I'd start looking, because...
look, there's my earring!
dollar bills can be lost, stolen, burned.
bitcoin is here forever, on the Internet.
while dollar bills are traded through a bank, Bitcoin is traded peer-to-peer.
see, Mom? Pretty colors. Fun, right?
Thanks, Zach.
so... you don't buy Bitcoin.
no, you can. There are currency traders online.
Yeah, one Bitcoin's worth three dollars.
it used to be $33. People were hoarding.
but that's not how it gets into circulation.
you mine it. Like gold.
the guy who invented it created this program that releases blocks of Bitcoin over time.
see?
that means running software on your computer that works to solve complicated mathematical problems.
you receive a Bitcoin when your computer succeeds.
the more computer power you have, the more mining you can do.
once you have Bitcoins...
so you're representing the inventor, Mrs. Florrick. That's really cool.
just his lawyer, Nisa. Bit less cool.
it's like this big mystery.
the guy who invented Bitcoin.
nobody knows who he is.
he's supposed to be this genius cryptographer, because no one's been able to break the Bitcoin code yet.
Yeah, my father thinks he's a Japanese programmer.
I heard Irish. - Okay.
well. Thanks for your help.
this stuff makes me feel so...dated.
I have to go. I love you.
love you, too.
good morning, Your Honor. - Good morning, Mr. Higgs.
you're representing the U. S. Treasury today, correct?
Yes, Your Honor. - Good.
cause I have some complaints about my Susan B. Anthony silver dollars.
Well...That-that was before my time.
no, seriously. What were they thinking?
they feel like quarters.
well, again, I wasn't here, but I can ask around.
Oh, please. Please do.
Mrs. Florrick. Hello. - Good morning, Your Honor.
so, uh... money-- that's why we're here today?
Oh, yes, Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick's client represents a criminal, Mr. Bitcoin.
excuse me. Mr. Bitcoin?
Yes. That's what we've come to designate the mysterious creator of this new Internet currency.
do you guys at Treasury get a lot of dates?
Yes, we do. Thank you for asking.
and why is this so important?
we believe this unregulated currency is being used in a digital black market, guaranteeing anonymity to money launderers, drug dealers, and child pornographers.
and Mr. Bitcoin is attempting to guarantee his own anonymity through the smokescreen of attorney-client privilege.
I don't think I would call attorney-client privilege a smokescreen, Your Honor.
this privilege protects communications between a lawyer and his client, not the client's identity.
unless his identity is the subject of these communications.
with one exception.
the "crime fraud exception," which requires that Mr. Stack reveal Mr. Bitcoin if he's in the process of committing a crime.
which has not been established.
you know, folks, I always wait in court patiently for these little conundrums.
that is why God made me a judge.
so that I could decide on motions exactly like this.
So...eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
that's a joke, folks.
government's motion is denied.
thank you, Mrs. Florrick.
now I have to go meet with some Occupy Wall Streeters.
new clients? - Yes, but...
these don't pay as well.
hello again. You're under arrest, Mr. Stack.
you heard the judge's ruling.
Yes, that attorney-client privilege applies.
I don't agree, but I respect the law.
then we're done. - No, we're not.
I'm arresting Mr. Stack for being Mr. Bitcoin.
Oh, come on! - I am coming on.
Mr. Stack presents himself as a lawyer representing the mysterious Mr. Bitcoin, but we've come to realize he is Mr. Bitcoin, and the penalty for creating a currency is ten to 30 years.
you're under arrest, Mr. Stack.
your Honor, Mr. Higgs does not believe that my client is Mr. Bitcoin.
he is using this arrest to apply pressure in counteraction to your ruling.
Yes, Mr. Higgs, the timing of the arrest does seem strangely coincidental.
bitcoin has incorporated, Your Honor.
here are the incorporation papers.
as you can see, the only signature evident is that of Mr. Stack.
because he's Bitcoin's lawyer, not its creator.
bitcoin has subcontractors, computer entrepreneurs who supply animation or random coding.
as you can see from these affidavits, their only contact was with Mr. Stack.
because Mr. Bitcoin wanted to remain anonymous.
really, Mrs. Florrick, must we all use "Mr. Bitcoin" now?
occam's razor, Your Honor.
the person signing the checks, incorporating and becoming the public face of a company is the company.
your Honor, those documents don't prove anything.
but they are evocative.
and I must say, I am a sucker for Occam's razor.
so I will grant Mr. Stack bail and, uh, hear arguments tomorrow.
good to see you again.
always a pleasure.
the difficulty here is proving a negative.
how do we prove Dylan isn't his client if we can't prove someone else is his client?
does he know you're in trouble, Dylan, your client?
can he help us?
I'm sorry, but I can't say anything without breaking attorney-client privilege.
okay, so hit the incorporation papers
that's not proof of ownership.
no, play offense, not defense. - How?
bitcoin isn't a currency.
there's no crime if Bitcoin is a commodity
just something to be traded like a bushel of fruit.
Mr. Gardner taps his inner rebel.
good, we have our strategy in court.
and outside court?
was there anything said by your client that would prevent us from hunting him down independently?
I cannot help you without breaking attorney-client privilege.
but we can do it on our own?
again, I cannot help you.
well, the inventor has left a few fingerprints.
he wrote a manifesto when Bitcoin came out.
I could use linguistic analysis to run him down.
good. And look for contact points with Stack.
when did they meet? Where?
you might try Decode-a-Con.
what, it's not on your social calendar?
stack is here for Decode-a-Con, the conference of cryptographers.
good. Maybe they were meeting there.
okay, I'm on it. One thing we might consider.
what?
it could be him.
I am vulnerable.
it's innocent, but it looks bad.
okay.
are you sure you want to tell me? Subpoenas could go out.
when I stopped gambling, this friend
my bookie-- Jonathan Meade, he forgave my debt.
how much? - $8, 000.
it's not much, but it could look like a payoff for setting him up with these judges.
but it wasn't?
I didn't take it that way. This guy was a friend.
my guess is Wendy is trying to tie it to a case we won.
they're looking at three judges: Winter, Dunaway, Parks.
could you look at our cases before them?
I want to anticipate which one they'll hit.
sure.
how are you holding up?
I don't want to go to jail.
up until this week, I never thought I would.
it's making you more human.
that's not much of a trade-off.
Jim Cramer. I am a former hedge fund manager, author and current host of Mad Money.
your Honor, we take this case very seriously.
obviously, Mrs. Florrick does not.
is there an objection in there somewhere, Mr. Higgs?
we object to the defense questioning this TV personality as an expert in currency.
well, let me think about that.
overruled.
Mr. Cramer, do you consider Bitcoin a currency?
no, I don't.
it has none of the characteristics associated with coinage and currency.
in what way?
there's no central bank to regulate it, it's digital and functions completely peer-to-peer.
thank you, Mr. Cramer. - You're welcome, ma'am.
Mr. Cramer, are you the TV personality who regularly shouts and badgers on Mad Money?
well, I think "badger" is debatable, but, yes, I have a very, dare I say, flamboyant personality on my TV program.
and you use various beeps and honking sounds on your program, and sometimes clench a knife between your teeth?
I would call it a scimitar more than a knife.
and, yes, I do employ beeps.
why aren't you objecting?
because the judge is.
so why on earth should this court take you seriously?
for the reason you would any man: the solidity of my arguments.
so you would ask this court to ignore the ass you make of yourself on TV?
excuse me, Mr. Higgs.
may I ask you please to be more cordial in your questioning?
thank you.
my apologies, Mr. Cramer.
I'm a great fan of your show, by the way.
thank you. No apologies. Was it Montaigne who said, "How many valiant men can survive their own reputation"?
no further questions.
our software blocks both schemes, creating pre-image resistance and creating a secondary pre-image resistance...
so, hieroglyphics were the first cryptograms.
the Egyptians, like companies and governments today, strove to protect their sensitive information...
are you familiar with the 2009 abstract that speaks directly to this issue?
of course I'm familiar with the study, but the methodology is completely flawed.
is leakage inevitable?
leakage is never inevitable.
c++ allows for some restrictions based on the complexity of the leakage. Okay?
now, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I will be right back.
women
sorry. This is the only place I can get some peace and quiet.
Oh, no problem. It's quite a scene, isn't it?
Oh, just wait till the Crypto-Bash.
there's nothing like a bunch of drunk cryptographers.
so you're Mr. Bitcoin?
no. Elaine Middleton, MIT. You?
Kalinda Sharma. St. Mary's High.
I did a linguistic match on the Bitcoin manifesto, and guess what popped up?
a patent application by one of the Ten Hottest Geek Women.
Oh, God. That'll be on my tombstone.
no Nobel, no MHV, just Third-Hottest Geek Woman.
everybody's looking for Mr. Bitcoin, when in fact, they don't realize it's Mrs. Bitcoin.
you have a linguistic tic, Ms. Middleton.
theoretically established combinatorial properties.
it's an odd little phrase that you've used exactly twice.
once in a patent application and once in the manifesto.
actually, you'll find that odd phrasing used three times.
once by me, once in the manifesto, and once by a Chinese econophysicist from Nankai University who goes by the code name: NewMint91.
Really? And why does NewMint91 use that phrasing?
he has a crush on me.
and he steals things. - "He"?
so, you've met him?
Yeah, actually, just today for the first time at the conference.
Bao Shuwei.
Thanks.
hello there. - Hello there, yourself.
what are you doing?
attending Decode-a-Con. What about you?
I am staring at a document you might be interested in.
I thought we could get together and talk.
sure. Whenever you want.
how's tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow's good.
my name is Mitchell Tambor.
and I stayed at the Crestview Priority Inn on the night of November 18, 2011.
thank you, Mr. Tambor.
this room at the Crestview Priority Inn, tell us about it.
well, uh, it was nice.
Mr. Higgs, as much as I cherish all this time we spend together, is there some driving point you want to make?
Yes, Your Honor.
sorry.
Mr. Tambor, how did you purchase this room?
with Bitcoin.
and how much Bitcoin did one night set you back?
well, the exchange rate at the time was approximately $25 for one Bitcoin, so I spent 4. 32 Bitcoin.
and did you purchase other goods with this Bitcoin?
an in-room movie, yes. - Good. And what movie was that?
that's okay. any other incidentals?
a Snickers bar and some peanuts from the minibar.
and you paid for all this with Bitcoin that you mined?
you used it as money? As currency?
Yes. - No further questions.
no, sir, we just need a rebuttal witness.
you're not in trouble.
get home safe, okay? - I will.
all right, I'll call you later. - Bye.
no, I'll hold.
so, you and Nisa are getting close.
I guess so.
this was her fourth night over here.
I thought you liked Nisa. - I do.
but, um, are you getting too serious?
mom, we go to different schools now.
we don't see each other at school, so we see each other here.
I know, but maybe you should slow it down a little.
Why? - Because...
you're young. Because she's young.
you'll meet a lot of people. She will, too.
did I do something wrong?
no, no, it's just...
she's over here a lot.
is this 'cause she's black?
Oh, my God, no. Zach!
no, you don't believe that.
I don't know what to believe, Mom.
you don't want her over here. - Okay, wait a minute, stop.
you know it's not that, so don't try to pretend.
I heard you two saying "I love you."
I'm just worried that it's moving too fast, that's all.
I'll ask her over here less.
Hello? - yes. Hello, sir.
great. Can you meet us at court?
Alex Krakowski. I'm the manager of the Crestview Priority Inn.
and you rented Mr. Tambor the room in question?
that's correct.
this hotel room is taking on legendary status, isn't it?
and you accepted his Bitcoin?
Yeah. It's a promotion, so yeah.
and you would also have accepted his frequent travel miles in trade for the room?
Yeah. We have a promotion going.
priority Inn frequent travel miles.
but you don't consider frequent travel miles cash?
what do you mean?
I mean, you have a cash register with a drawer for cash.
Oh, yeah, no.
we don't have a drawer for Bitcoin or frequent travel miles.
so it's more like a trade?
trading frequent travel miles for the room?
Yeah.
in other words, it's a commodity, not a currency?
Yeah. And we're not gonna do it much more with Bitcoin.
I thought it would be cool, but it's a bit of a hassle.
thank you.
no further questions.
good morning, Mr. Krakowski.
if you wanted to purchase a book on Amazon, could you do it using the frequent travel miles you accept at your hotel?
could I do it? No, I don't think so.
because they're non-transferable?
Yeah, that's right. It says right on it.
but you could buy a book on Amazon with the cash from your cash drawer?
well, no. You'd have to do it with a credit card or something.
but you could also buy the book with Bitcoin, could you not?
Yeah, I think that's right.
because Bitcoin is transferable, and therefore a currency?
okay, okay, I get it.
you know, I'd love to hear more about this saga of the Priority Inn in Crestview, but I'm ready to rule. Bitcoin is a currency. There.
your Honor, Mr. Higgs still hasn't proved my client created Bitcoin.
we'll be ready with witnesses tomorrow, Your Honor.
good. See the two of you tomorrow.
I need help on Will Gardner.
I'm getting pressure, and I've been asked to give you pressure.
and that's what that's about?
Yes. You have a choice to make.
people always say "choice" when I think they mean "ultimatum.
this was slipped to us last week.
it's highly actionable.
unless?
unless you get me something on Will Gardner.
we need to find which case makes him most vulnerable.
I like Will.
I go back and forth on you.
then don't do it for me.
that is Alicia Florrick's signature on what we believe is a forged document recently sent to us by an opposing attorney in a divorce case against your firm.
that's a felony.
forging a document and perjury, we prove this, Alicia gets disbarred.
but we don't want her.
we want Will Gardner.
I'm on your side, Kalinda.
Crypto-Bash - Who are you? - Kalinda Sharma.
your friend, Elaine, suggested we meet.
where is she?
I don't know.
it's Bao, right? - Yeah.
don't you ever just want to let the secret out?
scream at the top of your lungs,"I did it"?
did what?
invented Bitcoin.
okay.
Oh, God, she's getting back at me, isn't she?
so she sent you?
getting back at you for what?
I said I would leave her alone.
I found out she invented Bitcoin, and she threatened me, so I said I would drop it. Now she sends you.
no, no, she didn't send me.
I'm not Mr. Bitcoin. She is.
anyway, you should check out the new embedding.
that isn't me.
what isn't you?
the newest block of Bitcoin has a statement embedded in the code.
a statement?
when did that happen?
last night.
see?
what does it say?
stack is innocent.
your Honor, the time code of the embedding on this new block of Bitcoins embedding that only could be put there by Bitcoin's inventor was at exactly the same moment Mr. Stack was in court yesterday.
which means nothing, Your Honor.
it's the easiest thing in the world to arrange for a delayed embedding.
and in fact, if you were trying to establish an alibi, wouldn't you delay the embedding for exactly the moment you were in court?
or if you were trying to set Mr. Stack up, wouldn't you do the same?
so we're back to zero.
what a familiar place.
not exactly, Your Honor.
Yes, I was one of the subcontractors hired to do computation work.
I didn't know it was Bitcoin at the time.
and all your dealings were with...?
Mr. Stack there, yes.
she's gonna set us up.
Why? - Jealousy.
cryptographer jealousy. The ugliest kind.
do you have an opinion as to whether Mr. Stack had the technological capacity to be Mr. Bitcoin?
objection. The witness is not qualified to answer.
well, she seems qualified enough to me. Overruled.
Yes. Mr. Stack definitely is qualified to be Mr. Bitcoin.
my dad just keeps this apartment for when he's working late in court.
and you're sure it's all right to work here?
Yeah, he won't mind.
it's better than home.
well, look who's here.
Hi, Grandma. How's it going?
and, Nisa, right? - Yes.
how are you, Mrs. Florrick?
very well, thank you.
I thought you two were in different schools now.
we are.
we're just working on some homework together.
we're gonna use Dad's study.
and how is public school, Nisa?
it's good, madam.
we all miss Zach there.
well, perhaps he can return sometimes and say hello.
we hope so.
Bye, madam.
we're gonna go listen to some music, so it might get a bit loud.
Zach, I'm surprised you two are still friends.
I thought you were seeing Eli Gold's daughter.
what? No. I mean, she came over to the apartment once.
she's nice, but she's in college.
I see.
but she's very young, Zach.
Marissa? - No, Nisa.
she's only a year younger than me.
Yes, but you have such different experiences now that you're in Capstone.
and you don't want to always be driving across town.
it's not that far.
I just don't want you to get too serious.
maybe you should slow it down a bit.
you'll meet a lot of different people. She will, too.
what? Did I say something?
no, that's just what my mom said earlier.
Really?
well, your mother is probably right.
she just testified against our client in court.
Yeah, she's trying to deflect attention from herself.
can't you help trace the source of her embedding?
she would have covered her tracks.
Yeah, but if this recent embedding was done remotely, can't you trace the IP address?
I probably can.
it won't matter.
she'll have moved on from there.
Yeah, but it will help me get closer to her.
what, do you know it?
it's our IP address. - Ours? Lockhart/Gardner?
it was embedded from here?
Yeah.
so we think it's him, and not this woman who testified?
Yeah.
well, he's still our client.
we need to represent him.
Yeah, but I'm gonna stop looking for Mr. Bitcoin.
Oh, I agree.
so you're helping Will on his issue?
Yeah.
I know Will tries to stay brave about these things, but I don't want to be behind the curve.
you want to know when to cut your losses?
no. I want to know when to help.
okay. I'll keep you in the loop.
thank you.
$8, 000? That's how much this actor paid you?
well, no, he excused my debt for that amount.
okay. What else?
well, we think she'll try to go after a case, too.
I think you're right.
so we reviewed all of our cases with those three judges.
and we're in good shape on almost all of them.
who does the design in here?
it's very attractive.
I don't know. I can find out. - That would be great.
the worst is the McDermott case. Product tampering.
it resulted in an $8-million judgment in our favor.
the evidence wasn't with us, but it went our way anyway.
why is that?
sometimes the ball just bounces funny.
I like that.
so, was it a jury trial?
no, bench.
which judge? - Parks.
okay, I'm gonna ask this in the most friendly and objective way possible, and just understand, this is not a prod to do anything, but is there anything in that file there any notes or receipts or nasty little memos that could make you look bad?
Yeah. It could make Will look bad.
okay.
good to know. I'm gonna go now.
what do you want me to do?
I can't ask you to do anything.
I know.
yeah?
Yeah, it's Bao.
you told me to stay in touch.
Yeah. Bao I'm a little bit busy right now.
I did a deeper analysis of the IP address, - where the recent embedding came from? - Yeah?
okay, I had to use a large data set because it was stored on an untrusted server, and if I amortized the verifiable computation...
Yeah, yeah, that's real interesting, Boa, but no.
the thing is, there was no protection on the source computer.
there wasn't?
no, so I could trace it to the computer where the embedding was done.
great. What was it?
it's your computer.
you did not embed the "Stack is innocent" code on the new Bitcoins, Ms. Sharma?
I'll be answering for her. No.
and yet we traced the embedding to your computer.
ms. Sharma has nothing to do with it.
and I would like to bring the Treasury's attention to a common computer hacking practice called ghosting, in which the hacker only needs access to a parasite computer to get it to do his or her will.
in other words, Mr. Stack had access to Ms. Sharma's computer.
no. To deny that Ms. Sharma did it is not to say that Mr. Stack did.
and yet, as Judge Sobel might say, it is evocative.
ms. Sharma has been independently searching for Mr. Bitcoin, and in the process, she has been in close proximity to several key Bitcoin suspects.
any one of those could have ghosted her computer.
and would Ms. Sharma like to share those names?
no. But thank you.
this is one thing you might want to consider.
you're representing a client who is willing to set you up for a federal crime.
that, to me, is not a healthy attorney-client relationship.
do you know who did it?
I have a suspicion.
that leaves us with an LR-ZK interactive proof system construction based on standard general assumptions.
and we'll have to leave it at that, because I have someone here who wants to question me.
women
Yep.
someone ghosted your laptop a few days ago.
here's the aftereffect.
good. Can you tell who did it?
no, but I can tell you where it was done.
would you like that? - I would.
this isn't one of those Columbo-like things where you keep me doing things for you, hoping I'll slip up?
because I'd rather just confess.
I would rather that, too.
tell me what I should be confessing to.
ghosting my computer.
embedding the Bitcoin remotely.
here's something you should find interesting.
whoever ghosted your computer wanted to be found out.
Really?
it's easy to cover your tracks when you ghost.
they didn't.
it's like they're taunting you.
who? - I don't know.
but whoever did it recently did a search of the IP addresses you accessed.
you know who it is?
I know who it is.
so we're back to proving Stack is innocent?
maybe there's another way of proving it.
what?
treasury doesn't really believe that our client is Mr. Bitcoin, do they?
they're just using Stack to get to him.
Yes. - So prove that.
prove Higgs is still looking.
that he doesn't think Stack is the one.
right. - Good. I'm on it.
see? No Nisa. - I see.
everything okay with you two?
mom, you said that we should be seeing less of each other.
no. I said maybe you were moving too fast.
Yeah, that's what Grandma said.
she did?
she said that we should slow down 'cause we're too different.
that's what she said?
she said that it wasn't a matter of race. Just that...
I'm in private school and Nisa's in public school.
Hey, Nisa.
Yeah, come on over.
no, my mom says it's fine.
Bao.
so you did it.
did what? - Come on, Bao.
you're the one who traced my IP addresses.
you ghosted my computer, and you wanted me to find you.
no.
if people knew you created Bitcoin, you'd get a lot of attention.
people would talk to you.
in fact, you would be the hero of the Occupy Wall Street crowd.
have you seen the Occupy Wall Street women?
they're beautiful.
are those guys with you?
no. - I have to go.
wait, Bao. Talk to me.
come on. Not...not here. Not with them around.
okay. Then...let me get rid of them.
m-my room. Upstairs-- 2545.
do you want something?
actually, it's what Mr. Higgs wants.
tell him to come on down, and I will give him Mr. Bitcoin.
no. - Bye.
you know, I'm really good at losing people, so after I lose you two, call Mr. Higgs and tell him to meet me on the 25th floor of this hotel.
hello.
you didn't need to dress up.
what do you need?
Mr. Bitcoin is through that door.
Bao Shuwei. An econophysicist. - Yeah?
from Nankai University.
what's an econophysicist?
I have no idea, but they're very impressed with themselves.
is-is it all right if a, uh...
treasury official accompanies us?
sure.
I have a key.
very resourceful of you. Great.
looks like your friend checked out.
it's for you. Do you mind?
sure.
dear Kalinda, I wish I could stay and talk,
but I don't like attention, and creating Bitcoin "would probably bring me the wrong kind.
but now I have a new obsession. I love you.
I have one more witness, Your Honor.
goody, goody. I can't wait, Mrs. Florrick.
and Mr. Higgs followed you into the hotel room? - Yes.
and he stated that he was looking for the real inventor of Bitcoin?
objection, Your Honor. - No, Mr. Higgs.
you may answer.
Mr. Higgs stated that he believed I was on the right track to finding Mr. Bitcoin.
and what was that right track?
Bao Shuwei, an econophysicist from Nankai University.
objection. This is all hearsay, Your Honor.
no. No.
I recorded it. By accident.
I just got a new phone, and I didn't know how to turn it off.
thank you.
feeling less terrified? - Oh, much less.
here's your cashier's check.
it only took 20 minutes standing in line at a bank to change dollar bills into another piece of paper.
thank you.
I went online, and I bought one Bitcoin last night.
Really? It's the future.
I don't know. It didn't feel real.
well, real's going to change.
just watch.
thank you.
for what? - Testifying.
I just followed the path you set.
the path I set? - Yeah.
there is no Mr. Bitcoin.
there's three.
Really? - Yeah.
it's not one person; it's three.
I looked up the Decode-a-Con logs for the last three years.
you met each other in 2009, and that's where you came up with the idea.
Elaine wrote the manifesto, and Bao wrote the code.
and you got all that from...
what, a log?
from a log and a lot of pointed fingers.
you were hoping to lose the Treasury in a round-robin.
I think you are overestimating my intelligence.
no. I don't think I am.
well, then, thank you.
I'm honored.
there you are.
what do you have?
what's this? - You'll see.
to trial for a crime punishable by imprisonment unless the initial charge has been brought by indictment of a grand jury.
and that's where you come in.
you are 16 citizens who have been given an immense responsibility.
you must decide a man's fate.
my name is Wendy Scott-Carr, and this is Deputy State's Attorney Cary Agos and ASA Dana Lodge.
we are the prosecution.
unlike a trial, there is no defense.
you will only hear our case.
it is up to us to convince you that there's probable cause to bring William Paul Gardner to trial.
sorry. Thanks for waiting.
is everything all right?
uh, no. I wanted to talk to you before I broke this to the equity partners and associates.
is this about Will?
Yes. A grand jury has been impaneled, and our expectation is he will be indicted within the next two days.
I...
what's the charge?
judicial bribery.
of course, it's not true.
but the, uh...the State's Attorney believes that Will arranged bets between judges and bookies at his Wednesday night basketball game. I...
I-I didn't know it was that serious. -It is.
felony bribery... three to seven years.
I'm sorry, I really should go.
is it Wendy Scott-Carr or Peter?
uh, both, I should think.
Peter has put Wendy Scott-Carr in charge of the prosecution.
what can I do?
I don't want you to feel responsible or obligated to do anything.
I mean, "responsible" is the wrong word.
we've never considered you an...
extension of the State's Attorney's Office, and you've never acted like one. So...
again, I leave it to you.
Oh, Alicia, hi.
would you like me to help Mr. Gold today?
yes - Is there anything that you need help with?
Nope.
thank you.
state attorney
Hey. Hi. I just... I have to rush off.
what's wrong? What do you need?
no, nothing. It's-it's about Jackie, -but we can talk about it later. -Oh, well, 8: 00 tonight?
sure. Great.
in Session
I'm sorry.
no. Why? I am. -I didn't tell you because I - didn't want this to become... - You do not need to explain.
this is legal; It's not personal.
if I told you, it would become per... -Will, I'm a lawyer.
I'm a third-year associate in your firm.
so use me.
ms. Tascioni, -hello. -Hello again.
we seem to meet under a lot of circumstances like these.
we do.
I want to help.
okay.
with what?
with what I know about the State's Attorney.
I was hired as an investigator by the State's Attorney's Office.
and in this capacity, did you come to review Mr. Gardner's cases?
I did. And...
I was surprised by how many cases, both civil and criminal, in which he achieved a successful verdict.
could you elaborate?
on average, you would expect a 60% win rate as a ceiling.
and what did you find with Mr. Gardner's cases?
he had 75% wins.
did you find anything suspicious with regards to which judges decided favorably for Mr. Gardner?
Yeah. Three judges decided favorably for Mr. Gardner 95% of the time.
they were Judge Winter, Judge Dunaway and Parks.
and what else did you discover about these three judges?
they all played regularly in a pickup basketball Game on Wednesday nights, run by Will Gardner.
thank you, Mr. Wiley.
okay, so the strategy is this.
Hello, Ms. Lockhart.
hello. -You're, uh, you're up next.
I know. Thank you. -How did the partners take it?
they were concerned.
we'll work the phones this afternoon to handle clients.
how are things here?
uh, we were just... going over strategy.
Mrs. Florrick.
you can join us.
Yes. Okay, so here's the thing.
grand juries indict; That's what they do, hamburgers and all.
ham sandwiches.
Yes.
so, you're gonna get indicted, unless...
I like that pin.
thank you.
unless someone pulls the plug.
someone higher.
the State's Attorney. -Yes. You have an audience of one in there, Ms. Lockhart.
who? -Cary Agos.
he defers to the State's Attorney.
Wendy Scott-Carr does not.
she's...
no, that's right; She's her own person.
so you need to keep bringing the testimony back to Peter Florrick.
that'll get Cary talking to Peter.
that's right. If you want to stop this at the grand jury stage, you need to get the State's Attorney to stop it, and he'll only stop it if it looks like it'll hurt him.
you see? -Yes. Good.
excuse me.
Hello, Eli. -Hello, Alicia.
would you like to guess what's wrong with this picture?
I'm not there?
Yes. I ask for Alicia;
I get Alicia lite.
this is GLAC, Alicia, GLAC... the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Chicago.
they need someone to campaign against the defense of Marriage Act.
I needed you.
why me? - Because you...
because you're a gay icon.
excuse me?
I didn't decide it.
where are you getting this? -The gay blogosphere.
you're one of those spurned wives. -Oh, dear Lord.
your suffering has made you iconic.
they have a lot of money to fight DOMA.
this means a lot of money.
Eli, as much as it would gratify me to sit beside you signing autographs, you are the one they want; You don't need window-dressing.
Oh, yes, Alicia, give me a pep talk.
Caitlin is capable. She's smart.
she's studious. She's David Lee's niece, and that means something to Spencer Roth.
she's what?
david Lee, David Lee's niece.
the divorce attorney?
Yeah, family law. Why?
I'll be waiting by the phone!
you and I need to talk, Alicia. Don't make me wait.
don't you dare. It'll get ugly.
it's so good to see you! And you.
we're up for all the same jobs, aren't we?
we should be friends.
we shouldn't be enemies.
the best of friends.
so, the Defense of Marriage Act, what's your pitch on that?
it's wrong.
I want to learn from you, Eli.
there's so much I can learn.
I want to have lunch.
let's do. - No.
not lunch. Drinks.
hot drinks.
there are these drinks... mulled wine with Brandy.
they're amazing.
sounds good. I'm gonna call you.
gay and Lesbian Alliance of Chicago.
how may I connect you?
hello. This is Stacie Hall's assistant.
I'm having trouble texting her.
could you get her an immediate message?
I know she's in a meeting with Spencer Roth.
sure. What is it?
could you tell her that her 11: 00 meeting with Rush has moved to noon.
with Rush? Yes. Limbaugh.
do you want me to spell that for you? -No, I think I've got it.
you and Mr. Gardner have known each other for...
how many years? -Eight years.
and you were originally partners in opposing firms? -Yes.
and you knew about his troubles at his first Baltimore firm?
I'll need more clarity -in order to answer that question. -My apologies.
you knew that he took $45, 000 from a client's account to pay off a gambling debt?
all I knew is what I heard from you when you questioned me in my office, Ms. Scott-Carr, and that Peter Florrick, the State's Attorney, doesn't feel there's enough evidence there to prosecute him.
I can understand -your defensiveness. -Really? I didn't think
I was being defensive, I thought I was being clear.
then let's continue to be clear.
have you ever been to one of Mr. Gardner's pickup games?
no. -Why not?
I don't play basketball.
has he asked you to go?
uh, yes.
and why did he ask you to go if you didn't play basketball?
he said it was a good place, uh, to meet judges and prosecutors who matter.
for example, Peter Florrick, the current State's Attorney, often participated in the pickup games.
but you decided not to go to these games.
now, wasn't that because you thought there as something corrupt about these relationships?
no. Oddly, it was because
I didn't play basketball.
I don't think there's anything wrong for judges and lawyers to unwind over sports.
and my guess is that the current State's Attorney -doesn't think so either, or he wouldn't participate. -What's she doing?
tying Peter to it.
let's talk about one particular lawsuit...the McDermott case.
now, this was a lawsuit brought by a family whose child died from eating food tainted with peanut oil.
Yes. - And this was a client you brought into the firm. Yes.
but Will Gardner requested to take it over from you.
Yes.
Why?
he thought he would be better.
but it was only after a change of courts, after Judge Parks had taken over the case, that Will requested this switch?
take your time, Ms. Lockhart.
uh, yes.
and didn't you explain this switch to your associates as being due to the fact that
Mr. Gardner had a better relationship with Judge Parks?
Yes.
how did it go?
will, do you have a moment?
why did we win the McDermott case?
they asked you about the McDermott case?
they asked me almost exclusively about the McDermott case.
why did we win it?
it was a good case. -No, it wasn't.
we argued it well.
you argued it well.
I wasn't there.
then I argued it well.
they asked me questions about my conversations with the associates.
how would they know that?
you and I should talk.
sync and corrections by Edward Lo - I don't want to see - Alicia prosecuted either.
I need more.
the McDermott file doesn't connect the dots.
it's not me. It's Wendy.
give me more, and we'll tear it up.
the rider evidence that can hurt Alicia?
we'll tear it up.
you got to smile.
I got to smile?
Yes, 'cause the grand jury will perceive your attitude as hostile if it's...
hostile.
please?
well, since you said "please.
so, we were worried about the McDermott case, and here we are, dealing with questions about the McDermott case.
Yes, we were just discussing that.
and their questions would suggest some deeper familiarity, as if someone were...
talking to them.
I'm gonna check into it. -Good.
she's great. Yeah.
please stay on the line and your call will be answered...
Mr. Gold?
here are your xeroxes. -Oh, good. Thanks.
and could you get a few things from downstairs?
here's a list.
um, sure, definitely.
I will be right back.- Good.
sooner, the better.
and hello, Alicia. -Hello.
getting close to Caitlin, are we?
Yes. She's a real go-getter.
not a moment of complaint.
she made these copies for you?
Yup. Very important stuff.
these are from last year. Yes.
and who knows when I may need them again.
so, who are we acting out against, Eli? David Lee?
me? The concept of first-year associates?
might there be a simpler explanation?
I need someone to free me up so I can... work.
there are paralegals for that.
I like Caitlin.
you wanted to talk?
Yes, about attitudes, and let's start with yours.
I outrank you.
I am an equity partner, you're a third-year associate.
and I feel...
and yes, you are making me resort to marriage counseling speak...
I feel that you're treating me with the same degree of disregard as when I was your husband's campaign strategist, and I think that is wrong.
not kill-a-puppy wrong, but wrong, as in incorrect.
working off old information.
and I think we all need to reevaluate our working relationship here.
you're right.
what do you need?
Oh, well,
I need you to help me with my pitch.
Spencer Roth has asked us in to pitch to all of GLAC on Wednesday.
okay. Let's get going.
no.
I'm sorry. I think I interrupted you.
you said in an interview in Chicago magazine, quote, "What I love about Will Gardner is he is as sneaky as I am," end quote.
do you still believe that?
I think I meant "sneakily charming.
so, that's why the next line reads:
the sneaky thing is to cross that ethical line and not lose track of your client.
is that what you meant?
uh... something like that.
you did contract work for Judge Parks, didn't you?
I did. His wife was ill, and you helped him with the will and his children's trust?
if by "helped" you mean he paid me, yes.
but he paid you less than what was usual for this type of work?
no, he paid what was fair, considering the will and trust were simpler than most.
who brought Judge Parks to you as a client?
wasn't it Will Gardner? -That's probably right.
and wasn't the work a payoff for Judge Parks deciding the McDermott case for you?
it's an odd payoff, to charge him for work I did.
isn't that a conflict of interest, sir?
no more than the trust work I did for Peter Florrick, -the current State's Attorney. -Please answer the question, Mr. Lee.
Oh, I thought I was, ma'am.
I'm making an honest comparison to other work I did for your boss, Peter Florrick...
trust work for which I charged even less than Judge Parks.
if this is a conflict of interest... isn't that?
that's how a pro does it.
you're welcome.
what did they ask?
you and Judge Parks.
everything was you and Judge Parks.
daddy's a balloon.
Where's the pin?
Oh, hey, there. I'm sorry.
um, I was wondering if you might know where there was a restroom that had a changing table?
Oh, my goodness, look at that face.
Yeah, she's waking up.
Oh.
are you gonna go to the park?
I have a sweet tooth.
Yeah, I can see that.
does it taste better with whipped cream?
is there anything that doesn't taste better with whipped cream?
tell me when.
when. When.
to Eli and Stacie, new friends.
Mmm.
hmm. It's very, very sweet.
Mmm, wait till you get to the bottom.
so, Rush Limbaugh, huh?
Yeah. Oh.
how do you explain that one?
Mm. I was meeting him to argue against DOMA.
nice. And they believed you?
Oh, I'm convincing when I have to be.
Mmm. Fish. It burns. -Fish?
Oh, I'm trying not to swear.
everybody swears these days. Have you noticed?
old ladies, young girls.
really, everybody.
I have to tell you something.
all right.
but I have to steel myself first.
I desire you.
I'm serious.
I desire you, Eli.
every part of you.
your eyes, your hair.
I want to take you right now, right here on the floor of this bar.
well, go ahead.
I'm serious. -I know you are.
make the first move.
right here.
I'm ready.
you.
no, you're the one who desires me.
I'm pliable.
so...
ply me.
it's Sun Tzu, hmm?
destabilizing your enemy?
you know the only problem with Sun Tzu?
he never fought the Jews.
we're Masada, baby.
we don't mess around with mind games.
we use knives.
you're Jewish?
you're a nice girl.
hmm.
with your sweet little drinks and your giggle, but you're not playing in the little leagues anymore.
put out your hand. Why?
put it out.
and this is supposed to what?
Oh.
okay, this is... this is lacking subtlety.
no, tell me about Masada.
960 dead?
all those big, strong Jewish warriors?
Ah...
Hey.
Hi.
I'll talk to Jackie.
good, thank you.
I just don't want things turning sour.
they won't. They won't.
how are things here?
good.
work is hard, of course, because of this grand jury investigation.
what's going on, Peter?
I don't think we can have this conversation.
actually, we need to have this conversation.
it has nothing to do with us.
Peter, how can it not?
because I won't let it; That's why I chose
Wendy Scott-Carr, so that it wouldn't.
she's making it worse. -No, she isn't.
she's not me; I don't control her.
but that's the problem, Peter.
it keeps your hands clean at the expense of...
at the expense of who?
will? -No, my firm.
and Will. Yes, my boss.
the boss who you're sleeping with?
Peter, if that's the issue here, then let's talk about that.
of course that's the issue!
there's nothing between us.
my God, you have changed.
I used to be able to tell when you lied.
you think I'm lying?
I think you're manipulating the truth like a pro.
well, you would know about pros.
well, you got me there.
what do you want, Alicia?
I want you to stop this grand jury.
no.
that's what I used to do.
things that worked, but were wrong.
not doing that anymore.
Peter, your...
problem wasn't that you did things that were wrong.
your problem was that you did things that were wrong against your family.
that may be so, but that has nothing to do with this.
will Gardner is not my family.
good night.
please state your name for the record?
I'm a presiding justice in Cook County's third municipal district.
thank you, sir.
your Honor.
thank you, Your Honor.
is it fair to say that you are a reluctant witness here today, Your Honor?
that I believe this is a witch hunt.
and I think you're trying to criminalize behavior that is far from criminal.
and what behavior is that?
friendship and acquaintances between justices and attorneys outside work.
did the attorney, Will Gardner, ever offer you a bribe, Your Honor?
upon the advice of counsel,
I am here today to assert my right under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
did you ever make a illegal bets through Will Gardner with the bookie Jonathan Meade?
upon the advice of counsel, my answer to this question and all your questions will be to assert my right under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
I understand, Your Honor.
you don't understand a thing?
you're attempting to suggest that there is something nefarious here, when you know for a fact that any judge you haul in here would take the Fifth.
excuse me, Your Honor?
you either take the Fifth, or you leave yourself open to questions.
did you meet with Will Gardner yesterday?
upon the advice of counsel,
I continue to assert my rights under the Fifth Amendment.
is this a photo of you meeting with Will Gardner yesterday?
upon the advice of counsel,
I insist on my Fifth Amendment rights.
you setting me up?
excuse me, Your Honor?
they have a photo, from yesterday.
you brought them to me.
Yep. You go down, you're not taking me.
okay, I can see there is some kind of strategy going on here.
we can't say.
I just want to know one thing.
is it illegal?
no. - Good.
you two behave now.
I just wanted to see - Yeah?
how you're doing.
I'm good.
up next. Probably another 30 minutes.
are you...?
I'm fine.
no, are you taking the Fifth?
I don't know.
Elsbeth thinks I should.
it's the smart move.
will... I'm sorry.
don't be.
I am.
well, then be sorry because it's happening.
don't be sorry because of anything else.
okay. Do good.
always.
well, well, it's family law, darkening my halls.
Nora, could you ask Caitlin to come in here, please?
something fell off my desk.
so...
so...
Caitlin's not cleaning this up.
Oh, yes, she is.
it's such a double-edged sword, isn't it?
nepotism gets you the job, but then you catch all the poop your uncle should. "Poop"?
I'm trying not to swear so much.
how's the campaign going for Peter Florrick?
I hope well.
because his wife and I have been chatting.
as her divorce lawyer, of course, attorney-client privilege applies, and I can't really share anything, but, uh, I hope the campaign is going well.
Yes, Mr. Gold?
Oh, hi.
Hi, Caitlin. How are you?
good. Uh, what was it you needed?
no, nothing. Eli's fine.
well, give a call if you need anything.
and I have your xeroxes.
Thanks, Caitlin.
there's not much I love in life.
I like money.
I don't love money. -Is this going to be long?
but I do love my niece.
she is all that is good in the world.
and I think you ought to clean that up.
good afternoon, Mr. Gardner.
ms. Scott-Carr.
shall we start from the beginning here?
did you meet with Judge Parks yesterday?
Yes, I did meet with Judge Parks yesterday.
I see.
um, thank you, sir.
and thank you for not taking the Fifth.
you're welcome.
this is you in this picture?
Yes.
and what is in this envelope you handed to Judge Parks?
money.
okay.
and, um, was there an agreement between you and Judge Parks based on the exchange of this cash?
Yes.
and what was that?
that he would give it to UNICEF for their immunization drive in Uganda.
uh, and, um, how-how much money did you give him?
2000
for UNICEF?
I mean, isn't that a lot of money to be giving to UNICEF?
it is.
and why did you give him all that?
because I think kids in Uganda should be immunized.
and isn't this just a little bit suspicious that you gave this money on the eve of your testifying here?
I don't know.
I hadn't thought of it.
and why should we trust you that this money was, in fact, for UNICEF?
because I have a receipt.
okay. Let's see.
I have some notes here from...
thank you.
this is a copy of an e-mail from you to Judge Parks, exchanging information about which settlement would be agreeable to your client.
Really? Where did you get it?
when I am the subject of a grand jury investigation, Mr. Gardner, you may ask me that.
are these e-mails from you to Judge Parks?
no.
could you read there?
to whom are these e-mails addressed?
it says, "Judge Parks," but I never sent these to him.
someone must've typed over the real addressee.
and why would someone do that?
I have no idea, you just handed it to me, but the original e-mails...
are here.
um...
uh, let's turn now to Judge Parks.
but don't you want to know who the e-mails were really addressed to? -No, that's not necessary.
they were addressed to my partner, Diane Lockhart,-Excuse me, Mr. Gardner?
and it seemed only natural to discuss the award amount.
Mr. Gardner. Mr. Gardner, that was not my question.
please strike that from the record!
you fooled me?
Yeah.
go ahead.
what?
hit me.
it'll make you feel better.
I owe you.
no, you don't.
okay, you two, it's not over yet.
she promised a new subpoena.
what I'm worried is she...
it's not Kalinda...
but she's angry now.
so she goes where?
the whole firm?
personal.
she...
you're vulnerable somewhere, right?
you gave her the McDermott case as some big fat juicy... bait, right?
so she wouldn't go after your real vulnerability?
Yes. So...
who would she subpoena now?
any word on Mr. Gardner?
not yet.
did I do something wrong?
did you...?
do you know why Mr. Gold is being so cold to me now?
Oh, I didn't think he was.
I thought he was overworking you.
no.
he's not even talking to me now.
did I do something wrong? No.
I wouldn't worry. He seems distracted.
I wanted to tell him something about the meeting, but he won't listen.
what?
Yeah, what do you need?
well, I'm in bed, thinking of you.
no, you're not.
you know my meeting's in five minutes, and you're trying to throw me off my game.
well, that's true, but I'm still
of course, you are.
thinking of you.
do you hear my voice? I am not thrown.
well, you shouldn't have wimped out last night, Eli.
you'd be right here in my bed with me.
I gotta go now,
ms. Hall, and kick your ass.
but it's been nice talking to you.
Eli, sorry to keep you waiting.
Spencer, no trouble.
remember Mrs. Florrick?
I promised I'd drag her along.
Yes, hello, Alicia.
that's a beautiful suit.
Oh, thank you. Um, do you mind if we just take one second?
no problem. I'll be right back.
what the heck?
tell him, Caitlin. I'm sorry.
I wanted to get to you earlier.
this is not about the Defense of Marriage Act, Eli.
I was studying up on this meeting, and one thing that didn't make sense is why GLAC needed a crisis manager to fight against the Defense of Marriage Act when, in fact, the national committee was handling it.
and then I was reading some gay blogs...
can we talk about this after the meeting?
Eli, this is the meeting.
Spencer Roth wrote a letter in support of the proposed AT&T merger with T-Mobile as acting head of GLAC.
AT&T supposedly gave GLAC a $60, 000 grant.
when was this?
last week.
this isn't about the Defense of Marriage Act.
this is about damage control.
the GLAC board doesn't want to be criticized for its involvement in this merger.
but why say it's about the Defense of Marriage?
because they don't want to make it public they're shopping for crisis managers.
we have to change the pitch right now.
attacking the GLAC board is attacking gays.
too cynical?
thank Caitlin.
thank you.
Uh-oh. This is about Will.
I'll catch up.
hello.
I don't understand. - I know.
I thought Wendy Scott-Carr was targeting the McDermott case.
I never worked on that.
I know.
so... why?
well, she'll probably push you on things Mr. Gardner did that she could paint as legally questionable.
a prosecutor can ask anything at a grand jury hearing.
so what do you know that could hurt him?
the same spelling as my husband Peter, the State's Attorney.
thank you.
for the sake of disclosure, have we met before? - Yes, last year, during the State's Attorney election.
I believe you lost to my husband.
how long have you worked at Lockhart/Gardner, Mrs. Florrick?
two and a half years.
who hired you?
you were friends in college?
Yes, at Georgetown.
how long had it been since you'd last practiced law?
13 years.
I took time off to raise my children.
a 13-year layoff.
that was quite generous of Mr. Gardner.
have you ever seen Mr. Gardner do anything that you'd consider illegal?
not that I recall.
since joining his firm, at any time, have you been engaged in a sexual relationship with Mr. Gardner?
I don't see how that's relevant.
the jury is entitled to know the true nature of your relationship with him.
this line of questioning is inappropriate.
the jury needs to know she has an incentive to protect him.
you asked me what I thought about their relationship, and I told you... in confidence.
if you're not comfortable, Mr. Agos, you are free to step out.
Mrs. - Florrick, one more time.
while working at his firm, at any time, have you and Will Gardner engaged in a sexual relationship?
Yes.
is this sexual relationship still active?
no.
when did this relationship begin?
in the spring.
and when did it end?
a few months ago.
during the course of this relationship with Mr. Gardner, was your office moved to the 28th floor, the same floor as the senior partners'?
Yes.
and in that time, had you been advised that you were on a track to make partner?
Mrs. Florrick, would you please take your seat?
no.
I need to ask you to sit.
no. Thank you.
the witness has not been excused!
you are out of control.
Mrs. Florrick, if you do not sit back down,
I will have you held in contempt.
fine. Arrest me.
Mrs. Florrick?
Hi. You zipped out of there.
I didn't get a chance to do a postmortem.
the transcript of the hearing... it'll be released to the public?
only if Mr. Gardner's indicted.
otherwise, it stays sealed.
what happened in there?
I've got to talk to my kids.
Oh.
you're so funny.
you're so spontaneous.
like a youth in May. Say when.
keep going. Keep... Yeah, that's perfect.
so, what's the surprise?
you called saying you had a surprise?
Yes, um...
the surprise is...
I desire you, too.
Oh, now you're just trying to throw me off my game?
I am, but I still desire you.
Really? Okay? Well, then let's go do something about it.
my apartment's 15 minutes away.
mine's ten. You're playing chicken.
I am, and I'm good at it.
Mm. You don't see me swerving off the road.
then don't.
we're gonna crash.
unless you swerve.
I got the GLAC account.
Oh, what's happened?
Where's that desire?
I don't believe you.
you were expecting a call from GLAC about an hour ago.
you didn't get it.
I did. Oh, fish.
I still desire you, Stacie.
the way a victor desires his spoils.
that's right.
get those tiny little wheels turning in your head.
which way should I play this?
contrite and compliant, or tough and brash?
okay. Let's go.
let's have intercourse.
ladies and gentlemen of the grand jury, the hour has grown late.
if there are no further questions, the People of Illinois ask that you vote a true bill to indict Mr. Gardner on the charges of conspiracy to commit bribery and interfering with a judicial officer, class three and class two felonies.
please signify by raising your hands.
I've got a question?
excuse me?
you said, if there are no further questions.
I have a question.
Yes. I'm sorry, please.
who is this Peter everyone was talking about?
that would be Peter Florrick, the State's Attorney.
he hired Ms. Scott-Carr to conduct this investigation.
Uh-huh, okay.
so then, isn't it weird to bring in his wife?
I-I'm sorry.
by law, we are permitted to only answer questions about the facts of the case, but if you're asking...
I mean, who cares who she sleeps with?
if she's getting some, great.
here's what I don't get.
why even go after Will Gardner?
why not that judge guy?
well, again, by law, we are not permitted.
I mean, at least Will Gardner answered the questions
the judge just kept taking the Fifth. I know.
I didn't t get that, either.
maybe this judge knows Peter Florrick
maybe they should both be arrested...
you know what? That's-that's not... - Here's what I say happened.
I think Florrick and the judge are in it together.
Wow. Yeah, why don't you bring in that guy?
Ah, that was some good fishing.
Hey, um, could you grab my robe for me, please?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, what do you think of that?
I mean, it's just a mock-up.
I told Vanessa a deeper blue border would really make it pop.
you're working on my ex-wife's campaign?
only 'cause she asked me.
she threw me a lot of business in D. C.
that's why I'm here. To see this?
I desire you.
you're home early.
what's wrong?
nothing. I just... Um...
I want to talk to you.
what did we do?
you didn't do anything. It...
God, paranoid...
Hello?
Hi. It's Kalinda.
I know. What's wrong?
nothing.
no bill.
what?
I don't... I don't understand.
they didn't indict a ham sandwich.
you're kidding?
no. Will is free.
how is that possible?
um, we don't know.
we're still trying to figure that out.
you should come on down here. We're having a party.
Oh, um, no. Thanks, though.
and... Kalinda, th... thank you for calling.
no problem.
come on, let's dance. Oh, no, I don't dance.
no, I have to drink a lot to dance, and I don't like to drink a lot, no.
well, this is the one exception. Come on.
no, no. Seriously, you do it.
that was a close one. Yes.
let's try and reduce the excitement level from now on, shall we?
what is it, Mom?
nothing. Just something at work.
was it good?
yes...
it is, oddly.
you wanted to talk to us?
I did, didn't I?
I haven't been the best of moms.
mom. How?
I want to change all that.
I, um...
I think I should take a week off work, and we should go on vacation.
ms. Scott-Carr.
I wanted to thank you for your service.
you're excused.
Peter, we can still indict Will Gardner. With the next grand jury, I'll-I'll take...
no.
no.
we're done.
there are other ways.
like calling my wife?
it was a strategic move.
thank you for your service.
my assistant will validate your parking.
I'm sending these infractions of Mr. Gardner's to the bar association.
if you won't pursue him, they will.
do what you got to do.
now get out of my office.
again, I want to thank you for your service.
my assistant will validate your parking.
I'm sending these infractions of Mr. Gardner's to the bar association.
if you won't pursue him, they will.
do what you gotta do.
now get out of my office.
it's over.
it is. Odd, huh?
get used to it.
Diane, Viola Walsh on line one. - Yeah. Be right there.
Syria? - Yeah, we go to court tomorrow.
my guess, an eleventh-hour offer.
Oh, and, Will, Cary Agos for you.
Oh. There it is. The official word.
or he wants to indict me again.
Hey, Cary, how you doing?
Ah, I'm okay.
I think you know why I'm calling.
I hope I know why you're calling.
you're safe.
no indictment, and we're not coming after you again.
Thanks. - No. No, you guys, you played this smart.
go celebrate.
Thanks, man.
you have 23 calls. All congratulations.
six judges among them, and Lionel Deerfield.
he said it was important you call him tonight, it's an emergency.
Yep.
I think I can do without Lionel Deerfield's good cheer tonight.
they're on their way in now. No, we're setting things up now.
okay. Thanks, Alicia. See you in a minute.
I want in.
I handed it off when I thought I was going to jail. I'm not going to jail.
you had a brush with death, my friend. Take a week.
no, the adrenaline's pumping. I'm ready to take someone down.
okay, then. Let's take 'em down.
I'm so glad, Will, really.
I am, too. Thank you.
so, anyway, they're going to be here in a few minutes for negotiations.
can you greet them? - Sure. Viola Walsh.
Yeah. Why?
last time she was here, she asked me to join her firm.
Really? Maybe you could use that.
ms. Walsh. Mr. Gross.
Yes, and you're...?
Oh. Yes, right.
so, this is where creativity goes to die.
Oh, no, that's the next floor.
is that supposed to be funny? - It-it is.
well, I didn't think it was funny.
must've been my delivery. This way, please.
Diane! William. My two favorite people.
Viola. Always a pleasure.
and Neil Gross, in his patented hoodie.
I'm just waiting to get my blood sucked.
we seem to be catching you in the middle of a party.
casual Wednesdays.
Wow. Look at these wonderful exhibits.
well, you just seem to be girding yourself for battle, aren't you?
hello. - Oh, this is Caitlin. She's sitting in.
can we start?
Mr. Gross, hello. You created a suite of software...
Oh, excuse me. We don't need to review the case.
Oh, this isn't a review. This is my opening argument.
you created a suite of decryption software entitled CoursePoint.
it's not decryption software. It's data-mining.
and your company sold it to the Syrian government. - We would deny that.
and the Syrian electronic army used this software to decrypt and obstruct private e-mails and chats in order to arrest, torture, and murder protestors.
we represent the three American protestors, and we are asking that their families be awarded $1 million for damages Uh......
and $16 million for pain and suffering.
maybe my taste for hypocrisy is at an all-time low.
discussing dissidents while party music's playing in the next room...
can we just get to the core of the problem?
you don't care about these protestors.
you care about your top client, Patric Edelstein.
he's battling me for control of the international software market.
this is just one more attempt to embarrass me in order to make way for him.
it's death by a thousand paper cuts. This is one paper cut.
Yes. We represent your chief competitor. But no, this is not about paper cuts.
this is about the families of Mohammed Hazouri, Amy Newton, and Sara Fellner.
okay. All good to know.
but here's our offer. Are you ready?
$100, 000 and an endowed scholarship to advance the causes exemplified by these fine youths, and a joint statement of agreement saying that we will more strictly supervise third-party sales of our software.
that's why you brought us in here?
m - May I speak to you for a moment, please?
Caitlin... I know you thought you were being helpful in there, - but you really shouldn't talk. - Will asked me to.
he... What?
will asked me to say that, no matter what their offer was.
uh, how close are we, Samir?
uh, why? Is there somewhere else you need to be?
Yeah. You know, it's tough getting cross town.
you need to come to Syria, Kalinda. You live in boredom.
our days are filled with excitement.
you make it sound very tempting. Two protestors dead in Damascus today.
Yes, I know. I...
I should have confirmation on the middleman in three minutes.
you keeping yourself safe there? - Oh, yes.
I have friends in the Mukhabarat, the Shabeeha, and the protestors.
I have, uh, covered my bases well.
Oh, I saw, uh, Barbara Walters yesterday.
Really? - Yes, uh, she was here to interview our president.
she had, um... much better hair than I thought.
uh, excuse me, Samir. Yes, Eli?
did you talk to Stacie Hall? - Uh, it's not a good time.
no. I need to know now.
did you talk to Stacie Hall about my ex-wife?
can we discuss this later? I'm on with Syria.
no. Kalinda, I want... ... right now.
what's the emergency, Eli?
Why? - Why what?
why did my ex-wife hire Stacie Hall as a campaign strategist for her upcoming State Senate campaign?
why does my ex-husband care?
I care because she is my competition, and she has poached three of my clients!
so she's good?
Vanessa! She is out destabilize me, and that is why she's offering to represent you.
Oh, really? My mistake.
I thought my campaign was about me, but of course it's about you.
this is not narcissism, Vanessa. It's strategy.
Eli, you turned me down. I asked you to consult on my campaign...
which I did. - ... until we got into one of our postmarital spats, and we decided not to work together. So I sought out Stacie, that's all.
she didn't seek me out.
Uh-oh. Eli's mind is at work.
I get it.
I get it. This is to try and get me back on your campaign.
Oh, my God.
you're telling me it's just a coincidence that you pursued my competitor?
I'm not telling you anything.
it makes sense. You have your Bin Laden problem...
I didn't know he was a bin Laden! - And if I'm on your staff, it looks better.
see? Her husband doesn't mind that she slept with a bin Laden.
okay. Thanks for this. Whenever I feel nostalgic about our time together, Eli,
okay, okay, wait. Wait.
don't go with the green border.
Why? It's about the environment.
Yeah. Voters don't think "nature" when they see green. They think "bad skin.
look at the McCain campaign.
and that is not your best side.
you know. You need warmer lighting.
gold is good for you.
Stacie thought gold was too on-the-nose.
Oh, geez! On-the-nose is good. You're not trying to win the Nobel.
okay. Thanks, Eli.
do you really get nostalgic about our time together?
good night, Eli.
here's your problem.
to win, you need to prove two things:
one, that my client knowingly sold the software to Syria- a high bar in itself
and two, that he knew that the software would be used to capture and kill protestors.
good luck with that.
you-you got the invoice in your hand?
uh, yes. It was, uh, routed through, uh, Dubai.
Thanks, Samir. Um, I'll be in touch, okay?
no, no. I will be in touch with you. Okay?
just send me an e-mail with three question marks, and I will call you. Okay?
it's, um... safer, that way.
okay, good. Um... Stay safe, my friend.
and as kind as your financial offer is, we'll take our chances in court.
don't you want to check with your clients first?
they've given us permission to reject any unreasonable amount.
well, you're not going to get any more.
I'll make it my life's mission to get more.
that was odd. - What was?
the offer was too lowball.
it's like they're challenging us to take it to court.
Hello, Lionel. I would've called, but it's been crazy here.
Hello, Will. Can we go someplace private?
sure. This way.
things seem to be falling apart here.
so what's the emergency?
have you talked to anybody at the bar?
at the bar? What bar?
the bar's Attorney Compliance and Disciplinary Board.
Oh. No. Why?
we're pursuing your disbarment.
wh-what are you talking about?
I'm on the review panel.
look, I know I shouldn't be saying anything,
I've been sworn to confidentiality, but...
we received anonymous charges that you took $45, 000 from a client's account.
and put it back. 15 years ago.
there's no statute of limitations with disbarment.
we start disciplinary proceedings tomorrow.
I'm sorry, I just... I thought you should know.
don't say I said anything.
uh, before we begin,
I want to take a few minutes to talk about something that is happening a mere 100 yards from this courthouse:
occupy Wall Street!
Yes, these amazing young men and women are braving 36-degree weather, with the grit in their eyes of a shared cause, and all to challenge the system.
and I, for one, I...
I salute them.
well, that's all right. That's all I want to say.
and with that, we should get started, so...
do you want me to take the first witness?
no, I'm good.
and that's you? - Yes.
and you and your sister were in Syria why?
we were studying Arabic at the Al-Baath University in Homs.
and who is this? - My sister... Sara.
she told me to take the camera. She wanted the video to get out.
and then what happened?
the officers took us into custody.
Saydnaya Prison in Homs.
and the al-Mukhabarat al-'Askariyya...
that's military intelligence? - Yes.
they had a transcript of a cell call I had with Sara a week earlier, and he kept repeating it.
and that's why you were arrested?
Yes. We discussed joining the protest on the call.
do you have any idea how they intercepted this call?
Yes. There was a PC in the interrogation room, and he kept reading it from the screen.
but what does that have to do with Mr. Gross's company?
couldn't that have been any software?
no. When they took me to my cell, I saw the logo on the screen.
it was the chess piece logo from Chumhum.
and that was the last time you saw Sara alive?
Yes. When the guards looked through her passport, they saw a stamp for Israel.
we had gone a year before, but my stamp was too faint to see, so they let me go, and they kept her.
you were demonstrating peacefully, Jimmy? You and Sara?
Yes.
much like Occupy Wall Street...
Oh, come on. Objection, Your Honor.
your Honor, I am merely showing the victim's intentions.
no, you're merely playing into His Honor's stated sympathy.
okay, thank you, both of you.
I think you'll find that I'm made of sterner stuff, - Mr. Gardner, Ms...? - Walsh.
Walsh, than to have my sympathies so easily plucked.
so, any further questions? - No, Your Honor.
Mr. Fellner, you know that Chumhum has many software products - that use the same logo? - Yes.
business software, word processors, spreadsheets, and all are designated to use the same chess piece logo?
Yes.
so couldn't it have been one of Mr. Gross's other software products, say, his word processing software, for example, that you saw on the screen that you mentioned?
no. - But you aren't certain?
all the software has different colored chess pieces.
this chess piece was red.
just so we're clear, Your Honor, red is the color of the logo...
objection, Your Honor. Do we all get to testify into the record now?
okay, we're going to be making some changes around here, shuffling a few people around.
is this about the failed grand jury?
no, this is about a lot of things, not just any one thing.
some of us weren't consulted on that judicial bribery investigation.
we're not gonna finger-point around here.
no one's to blame, and everyone's to blame.
so I will be visiting with you each individually to discuss new priorities, all right?
thank you very much.
too bad that didn't work out for you.
go to hell.
I heard you did well in court today.
I did.
and yet...
the Attorney Compliance and Disciplinary Board is pursuing my disbarment.
uh... Why?
the $45, 000 I borrowed 15 years ago.
no statute of limitations.
my guess is Wendy slipped the charges to them as a late hit.
we have to fight it. - Fight what? I did it.
it was a long time ago, but I did it.
Yes. And we have to point out their hypocrisy in pursuing you.
one thing I've noticed, people in judgment don't care about their hypocrisy.
then you throw yourself at the mercy of the board.
it never ends, does it?
once they have you in their grasp...
...they never let go.
why are you doing it?
Nora! There is someone in my office!
why are you undercutting me with your wife?
ex-wife. You can't just come in here. You call ahead.
well, you left one of your socks last night. I needed to return it.
I did not. That is not my sock. What am I, Santa?
Oh, it's mine.
what's wrong with green? There's nothing wrong with green.
for trees and split pea soup, nothing.
but for campaign brochures... This is not Campaign 101.
then stop undercutting me with your wife.
then do a better job.
well, your ex-clients seem to think I'm doing a better job.
okay. You got me there. Good-bye.
I need to see you again.
no.
last night was amazing. I can still taste you this morning.
Oh, okay. Thank you. G... Good-bye.
at least 75 people are reported dead in Syria in one of the bloodiest days since the uprising began.
the violence comes a day after 41 people were killed, including five women...
Hi, remember me? Stacie Hall.
Yeah. How are you?
good. I have a quick question. - Okay.
how did you find out she slept with bin Laden?
why don't we discuss this somewhere else?
not that bin Laden. Not Osama.
Patric Edelstein wants an update. The conference room.
what?
so we are doing this for Edelstein?
conference room.
the class rejected the offer of a scholarship of $100, 000 and a joint statement.
and so now we're at trial.
and what are our chances? - Fifty-fifty.
but our intent is to use the trial to apply further pressure to Neil Gross and get a more lucrative settlement.
so I have to ask something of you.
okay.
I need you to settle.
we'd rather not have Congress look into our foreign sales of decryption software.
I would imagine that would work for you, having Congress look into Neil Gross.
no. Unfortunately, on this point,
Neil Gross's interests and my interests are aligned.
congress will turn this into a circus.
this trial is giving it more prominence.
we don't represent you in this case.
we represent the class, the three families of the dead protesters.
Yes, but I referred them to you. - I understand that.
but when we agreed to take their case, they became our clients, not you. I'm sorry.
this isn't... ...really what I wanted.
I'm sorry. We can't help you here.
are we going to be all right here?
I don't know. He may leave. That's the breaks.
Mr. Deerfield, do you have a minute?
Yes. Uh... Diane Lockhart, right?
Yes. I'd like to talk to you about Will Gardner.
my name is Kassim Al-Khoury.
I'm a software wholesaler, working out of Dubai.
and you've had dealings with Mr. Gross's company?
Yes. We admire you greatly, Mr. Gross.
I've read your biography three times.
and where did you have dealings with Mr. Gross's company?
in Dubai, at the yearly technology trade show.
the trade show colloquially referred to as "The Wiretapper's Ball"?
Yes. Various Western companies sell their wares there.
and many totalitarian governments shop there for spy tech and data-mining software?
Yes. but also corporations who want to encourage employee productivity.
also law enforcement...
Oh, sorry. Please continue.
we can take a break, Your Honor. - No, no, no, no. No, it's nothing.
over lunch, I went to offer moral support to Occupy Wall Street.
and it's because of the pepper spray.
at the Wiretapper's Ball, you bought some of Mr. Gross's CoursePoint software?
Yes.
and you sold it to representatives of Syria? - Yes.
and this was because Chumhum itself couldn't sell software to the Syrians?
Yes, the American trade embargo required using a middleman. That is me.
and this is, in fact, your invoice, selling CoursePoint to the Syrians?
Yes, it is.
and did Chumhum know you were reselling software to Syria?
Oh, yes. I sent the invoices to them as well.
no further questions.
I, um, Ms. Walsh, do you have any questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
you hold a grudge against Mr. Gross's firm, don't you?
no. What do you mean?
I mean, that you sued Mr. Gross for nonpayment of debt.
no. We had a disagreement over Euro-to-dollar conversions.
well, didn't Mr. Gross's company refuse to pay you precisely because you were selling spy software to Middle Eastern regimes?
no, that is not true.
no further questions, Your Honor, but we would like to recall Jimmy Fellner.
why are you suing, Jimmy?
because my sister's dead, and she doesn't have to be.
sorry. Ignore me.
and that's why everyone in this class action is suing, right?
Yes.
that's your sister? - Yes.
and who's this?
it looks like my sister, but I've never seen that photo before.
but it would appear to be your sister. - Yes, where was it taken?
we just got this photo from a Syrian rebellion Web site.
it was taken three days ago. - Objection, Your Honor.
why would you object? We've just given your client good news. His sister is alive.
we have no way to confirm the providence of this. - Oh, my God.
Jimmy, you yourself said that you're suing because your sister is dead.
well, this is evidence that she's alive.
Mr. Will Gardner, one of the objectives of the State Bar Disciplinary Board is to maintain the honor and integrity of the practice of the law and to promote the general welfare of the members thereof.
to this purpose, we have collected sufficient evidence regarding the theft of $45, 000 we believe warrants disbarment proceedings.
do you understand? - Yes.
in all matters, this board attempts to show deference to any calls for leniency.
it has come to our attention that you have been responsible for the establishment of the pro bono department in your firm.
at a time when most firms are curtailing their pro bono efforts, it is heartening to see that Lockhart & Gardner is stepping those efforts up, at your direction.
for this reason, we would like to offer you the option of suspension.
six months probation.
no cases, no clients, no entering a courtroom except as a private citizen.
and if I decline?
then we proceed to a disbarment hearing.
and the determination of this panel will be permanent.
we have to; we have to drop the suit.
that's exactly what the other side wants.
I don't want anything out there that could jeopardize my sister's life.
you're being irrational. - What if it were Amy?
you'd still be thinking about monetary damages?
if we walk away, this company goes about its business, and who's to say there's not another Amy or Sara in the future?
that's exactly right. Which is why...
the majority of the class rules.
Yes, but we put Kalinda on finding out more about Sara.
good, I'm on it.
you talked to the board? - What did they say?
six months suspension.
how long do you have? - They need a decision tomorrow.
fight it, Will.
six months away from the law will kill you.
the photo of Sara was on the Web site of a blogger who goes by Pink Damascus.
a lesbian activist chronicling the protests in Syria.
she's been a huge thorn in the side of the Assad regime.
can you find her? If we know who took the picture, we can find Sara.
I have some ideas.
has Viola asked you to join her firm?
Yes. I said no.
Yes, just so you know, other firms will try to distract you by asking you to join them.
it means nothing.
they never trust you if they poach you. It's best to stay loyal.
I wasn't taking it seriously. - I know.
am I doing well here? - You are. Very well.
good. Thank you.
this is first-rate idiocy!
is that why you brought us in here, Eli, to insult me?
you slept with a bin Laden; you can't just ignore that.
how do you know we're ignoring it?
you grilled Kalinda on how she figured it out.
you can't just close off those channels.
hm, you're right, Vanessa.
his left vein in his temple pulsates when he gets angry.
it won't work. If Kalinda figured it out, it's only a matter of time before it becomes public.
so, what's your suggestion?
own it. Be the one to bring it forward.
cloak it in open-mindedness.
pushing back against anti-Islamic prejudices. It's only a name.
our president had the same middle name as a genocidal dictator, and we still elected him.
this guy, your, um, hotel financier, the one you slept with while we were married...
Eli. - What? I'm being just as accurate as the press will be.
you know, this is getting messy; maybe I should just back off.
no, Stacie, give us a minute. - Sure. Oh, there my sock is.
so, who are you obsessed with, her or me?
no one. I'm just helping.
I don't like her hurting you.
okay, do me a favor.
either stop caring or officially get on board.
so, Cary, how's it hanging?
I need you to take a step back from court and do some child support enforcement.
you need me to?
Yeah.
we were both on that judicial bribery investigation. It wasn't just me.
this is what Peter needs. - So it's Peter, not you.
it's what the office needs.
and you're just gonna go along with it. Right?
you knew I was following Wendy Scott-Carr's orders, but you don't give a damn.
Dana... - No.
you don't get to say it like that.
no, Mr. Agos, you don't.
it won't be very long... - Good-bye.
what does that mean?
Yes, I see the photo of Sara, but I cannot help.
it could have been taken anywhere in Syria.
and what about the blog where it surfaced?
can you... can you help us find Pink Damascus?
are you there?
I cannot stay here long. - I understand.
uh, yes, yes, we know this Web site.
no one really knows where this Pink Damascus is.
if you learn a neighborhood, I will keep trying.
I have to go.
I can't help. - That's not technically true.
I thought I was getting and update from Will Gardner.
pink Damascus has a Sleuthway account, sir, and if we could just contact her...
our privacy policy is the cornerstone of my company.
if it got out that I released a user's confidential informa...
better than if it got out that you prioritized company policy over the life of a 23-year-old girl.
enter calling connecting
yeah?
can I help you?
I'm sorry. I think I got the wrong person.
who did you think I was?
a lesbian blogger from Syria. Pink Damascus?
sorry to disappoint.
have you heard of her?
Yeah, you know, I keep up with the news.
Yeah, imagine the public uproar if it were revealed that Pink Damascus is actually a 30-something-year-old guy living in Kansas, pretending.
Where'd you come up with Kansas?
your Rock Chalk pillow, the KU cheer.
you know, you could face felony fraud charges.
that's five to eight years in federal prison.
you're lying. - I work for a law firm. Try me.
what do you want?
he only had an IP address for the person who sent him the photo.
he? - Yeah, imagine that.
misrepresenting himself on the Internet.
I traced the IP address to Homs.
an Internet cafe in the Al-Sinaa district.
good, you'll pass this on to your contact in Syria?
Yeah.
you wanted to discuss the Neil Gross questioning?
Yeah. No.
you... want me to... - No, stay. Close the door a second.
I didn't tell you about the grand jury investigation before, and that was a mistake.
and you're safe. - Yes.
I mean, it's moved to a possible disbarment, and I've been given a choice.
wait, what?
the Disciplinary Board is looking into disbarring me.
Oh, my God. Will...
it's okay. It's just... I'm used to it now. Funny.
anyway, I've been given a choice. Fight disbarment or take a six-month suspension.
you can't; you don't deserve to be disbarred.
I do deserve to be disbarred. I took money from a client's account.
15 years ago. - But I did it.
and you know what?
the only reason I'm being offered leniency is because of our...
it's because of our pro bono program. Something I fought tooth and nail.
you didn't. - I did.
I'm taking the six month suspension.
I did wrong. I should face the consequences.
there it is. I've just decided, thank you.
you're giving up the law for six months?
Yeah. Weird, huh?
I can't imagine it.
you did for over a decade.
Yes.
okay, I better tell someone.
okay, then you'll close out the Neil Gross case, and I'll reassign your other cases to the partners.
how soon can you get me a rundown? - End of the day.
good. You won't be able to come into the office unless it's related to handing off cases or the business of the firm.
I'll file the papers with the bar about the firm's name change.
Lockhart & Associates seems simplest. Unless you have any objections.
so, we're done.
for now.
you'll still have a place when you come back.
technology doesn't take sides.
is that how you rationalize doing business with autocratic regimes?
objection. Argumentative. - Yes, sustained.
Mr. Gross, does your company sell to the governments of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain?
you mean, allies of the United States with whom we have full diplomatic and trade relations? Yes, we do.
we never discussed this line of questioning.
your social networking Web site, Chumhum
did you not turn over the addresses of Chinese dissidents to the Beijing...?
objection. Relevance.
Mr. Gross's lack of compunction in dealing with regimes that torture and kill their own people, not to mention Amy Newton, Sara Fellner, Mohammed Hazouri...
your Honor, I understand where your sympathies lie...
ms. Walsh, stop that, please.
I know you're trying to drive a theme to help you in your appeal, - but don't do it at my expense. - Your Honor, I wasn't.
you were, ma'am. And I don't mean to fly off the handle here, but I am being objective.
so, objection... sustained.
let's talk about CoursePoint, Mr. Gross.
it emits a ping to your central servers when it's in use, does it not? Kind of a homing signal?
again, relevance. If Mr. Gardner is so curious about the nuts and bolts of our program,
I recommend that he go to the software convention in Las Vegas next month.
regardless of how the program was obtained, Your Honor, how the program operates is precisely what attracts it to users.
your logic is... logical.
your objection is overruled, Ms. Walsh.
uh, yes.
when the software is in use, it interfaces with our server.
so you are able to identify when and where CoursePoint is active?
Yes, we are.
well, then wouldn't it follow that you had full knowledge that your product was being used by the Syrian government?
I've never denied that.
but as I have maintained, repeatedly, neither I nor my company provided it to them.
can you tell if those pings were being sent from the city of Homs?
objection. Beyond irrelevant.
if you wanted to, Mr. Gross, you could tell where my client's sister was being held right now.
that doesn't even make sense!
it does if she's being held in the same place Mr. Gross's program is being used!
objection, Your Honor!
and I sustain Ms. Walsh's objections.
mostly good cross. - Thank you.
you tried to take Neil Gross out at the knees.
only because no one else has.
be smart, Will. Don't argue from passion - it clouds your thinking.
you think I've forgotten about the case?
that I'm suddenly hell-bent on finding Sara?
I think you're trying to hit a home run with your last at bat.
it's just an observation.
I'd love nothing more than to be proven wrong.
I don't have much time to prove anything.
Yes.
is that a yes-yes, or an I-really-don't-want-to- but-my-ex-wife-has- worn-me-down yes?
does it make any difference? Yes, I will consult on your campaign.
and yes, I will even take my marching orders from Stacie.
Eli, I don't want you if you don't want to.
okay, okay, okay, first lesson about being an elected official:
when you get what you want... shut up!
what?
I miss arguing with you.
well, I'm sure we'll now have plenty of opportunities to relive those glorious moments.
I'll send over the latest budget.
you've always been good about finding the fat.
and I have some position papers I'd like you to mark up.
well, you know where to find me.
win or lose, this'll be nice.
Diane, you needed something?
Oh, yes. Will talked to you about his decision? - He did.
good. I'm reassigning his cases.
I need you to take this one solo.
will and I would like to keep it under the radar.
who's the client? - Kalinda.
it's primarily a tax case.
Kalinda has a variety of complications, some business, some personal.
several of which began before she joined the firm.
I appreciate your confidence, but I would think a tax lawyer might be more qualified.
it's past what a tax lawyer can do, which is why I was handling it and why we want you to take over.
you and Kalinda should talk as soon as possible.
they are holding her in an empty... Al-Sinaa district.
Samir, you cut out. Can you please repeat again?
they are holding her in an empty school in the Al-Sinaa district.
they use these abandoned buildings instead of prisons to hold people.
it makes it a lot harder to find someone you are looking for.
and you're absolutely sure she's there?
as sure as it is possible.
I might be able to get her out, but I will need 50, 000 U. S. dollars.
to pay a bribe?
I will handle it, okay?
but there's just about four hours, so I need the money immediately.
we'll wire it.
Samir, tell us where to wire it.
okay, you want to wire it ... central bank...
did you get that?
Samir? Hello?
video fail
I know how we're going to win this case.
how?
tech support.
dinesh Rekhi. I work on the Chumhum help desk.
but to my customers, I'm Roger.
have you received calls from users seeking help with CoursePoint?
Yes. It's a complex program, and there's still a bug or two to be worked out.
sorry, Mr. Gross, but all programs have bugs.
and how many calls have you received since March 2011, - when the Syrian uprising began? - Hundreds.
did any of those calls come from customers in Syria? - Yes.
and who were those customers?
government users from the Ministry of the Interior.
the agency that oversees Syrian security forces?
I don't know. I just answer the phones.
how can you know for certain who's calling?
every user who calls must identify their license number.
it's part of the user agreement.
so Syrian government agencies bought the software and registered it, just like any other honest user?
it appears so.
but they couldn't use it without your help. - Yes.
so, Chumhum is helping the Syrian government arrest and torture protesters.
your Honor, I'd like to request a recess to confer with plaintiff counsel.
harmony and concord between the two sides.
I'm inspired.
they have her.

greetings from Ramstein Air Base.
it's my first trip to Germany.
you look like hell.
you look perfect.
Samir? Hello?
Salaam alaikum. Is Samir available?
no. He's not here.
I just wanted to let him know that... - I said he's not here.
do you know when he might be back? - Samir is gone.
I - I'm sorry. We cannot talk anymore.
do not call again.
at least four people have been killed after army troops stormed the town of Talkalakh in western Syria.
according to residents, the town is under lockdown with government security...
burning the midnight oil even on your last day?
I thought I could squeeze out one last billable hour.
any idea what you're gonna do?
maybe write a rock opera?
there hasn't been a decent one since The Wall.
I'm sure it'll be great.
will, if there's anything you need... - I'm good. But thanks.
follow Diane's lead, Alicia.
look, I am the one who is suffering here.
Oh, yes, tell us your troubles.
I am handling all of Will's cases, and now we've lost Caitlin, too.
look, we put someone else into Will's seat, that's what we do.
excuse me. I'm sitting right here.
there is no "Will's seat.
you're not here as a lawyer.
you might as well not be here at all.
that is not the subject of this discussion.
someone spoke to the bar disciplinary board.
someone said Will was here working on cases.
now, I'm not going to do anything so dramatic as to ask, "Who was it?" But I will say this.
if you have an issue with the way we're running this firm, you come to me.
you do not stab Will in the back.
you don't lie to the disciplinary board... - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
look, I know nobody wants to respond because we don't want to look like Judases, but Will is working on cases.
no, I'm updating associates on the background of my cases.
What?!
Oh, come on. You call me an ethical midget?
just a minute! Wait a minute!
we disagree with each other, we keep it in-house!
you want to backstab someone, do it right here.
okay, I disagree. There.
and I urge the equity partners to replace Will until such time...
then marshal the equity partner votes, and call a meeting.
are we done here? - No.
Alicia's asked for a raise.
I am advocating a ten percent bump.
no, you have a dozen third-year associates who will be asking for the same exact thing.
then we lose her.
and how do you know that?
because he's got a dog in the fight.
we only want Alicia because of her ties to her husband.
no, we want her because she's good.
we're gonna take your word for it?
look, look, we all know we're gonna compromise.
can we just compromise?
who do you think leaked it?
could be any one of them.
good thing they don't like each other, or I'd be dead.
where you headed? - Court.
Why? You don't have a case today.
and can you describe what happened, Ms. Lockhart?
Yes. I was walking from my car when I saw you in the lobby, serving a subpoena to that man.
and did you hear me announce myself?
Yes. I heard you say,"Mr. Dobbs, you have been served."
then what happened?
in your own words, Ms. Lockhart.
well, that man tried to punch you, and then you threw him against the wall.
in a manly fashion?
Yes, I would say so.
he says I threw the first punch. That's why he's suing me.
that is not what I observed.
you two know each other. That's why she's saying that.
do you and I know each other, Ms. Lockhart?
well, you served me with a subpoena, so I guess to that extent, we know each other.
thank you, Ms. Lockhart.
your presence here in small-claims court is a breath of fresh air.
objection. - Overruled.
and I will ask you to proceed, Mrs. Florrick.
so the video was taken from the back of the snowmobile?
Yes, my-my wife was taking it.
that's just her cell phone camera.
and that's you driving? - Yes.
up at the Rollins Savanna Forest Preserve.
then what happened?
the snowmobile-- it just started changing directions.
okay, Grant, slow down.
were you steering it toward the trees? - No.
what are you doing?!
the steering column locked, and I...
it's not funny. Stop.
I couldn't budge it.
please slow down!
grant, slow down! Please!
and what happened to your wife?
she was in a coma for a week, and then she...
She...she didn't make it.
and that's why you're suing Snow Plain, the makers of your snowmobile?
Yes. I've never sued anyone in my life.
never had much use for the courts.
my-my parents told me, "If you have a problem with someone, then, you say it to his face,
but my wife...
she was the best thing in my life.
okay, let me interrupt right there.
Mrs. Florrick, Mr. Hines, why don't you come up here, and we'll talk?
here's the deal.
first of all, good morning to you all.
good morning.
we're going into chambers for a bench-supervised negotiation.
your Honor, that's not necessary.
counselor Hines, it is.
your case here is obviously to delay until Mr. Duverney gives up.
that's not true!
and I'm not gonna be a party to that.
there are no real legal issues to dispute, so here is my order.
marshal your settlement arguments and meet me in chambers in one hour.
understood?
Yes, Your Honor.
I think I might try my hand at this lawyering.
very impressive.
so I have to thank you.
there's an art show, or something or other, near here.
you're not really into art?
no, but I don't actively dislike it.
I'm sorry, but I have to head back to work.
but you do have to have lunch.
actually, I think someone's waiting for you?
okay, then, tonight.
I'll call you.
you thinking of buying?
I don't know what I'm thinking.
everything's so expensive these days.
well, you know one thing I learned is, life is short.
you get a chance to bring yourself some pleasure, you should do it.
even if I had the money, I...
I don't know. It's my old house.
doesn't make sense to go backwards.
look at me.
I'd give anything to go backward.
Mrs. Florrick, the judge is ready for you now.
here we go.
what is it about glasses?
I seem to walk into a room, and they disappear.
your Honor, this is not just about one suit.
this is about the class action that Lockhart & Gardner has in the wings...
no, it is about one suit.
we're asking for $5 million for pain and suffering, loss of spousal support...
you know, I used to carry around three or four pair of glasses.
at the end of the day, I was like a drunk looking for bottles.
you're paying, Mr. Hines.
by the evidence I've seen, you're paying.
the only question is, how much?
but you haven't seen this evidence.
what is it? - Grant Duverney's medical report.
from 2009. Before the accident.
Yes, but after his career as a professional hockey player.
what does that have to do with anything?
modified comparative negligence.
if your client contributed to the accident-- in fact
if he contributed more than 50% to the accident-- then he can't sue us.
you're saying that he's responsible for his wife's death?
I'm saying, given his mental capacity after 86 games as a professional hockey player
body checks and fights-- he had no business getting on that snowmobile.
your Honor, this...
is despicable. - And yet legal, Counselor.
you're saying, Counselor Hines, that the plaintiff caused his own accident by steering into a tree?
I'm saying, it contributed.
the plaintiff's apparent condition-- chronic traumatic encephalopathy
was more than 50% of the problem.
okay.
I'll be ordering an independent neurological evaluation on Mr. Duverney.
we'll see where that takes us.
basically, we're in trouble.
how can we be in trouble?
we were in negotiations on this.
they're going after his hockey career.
and Judge Rigby is giving them some rope.
so there's truth in their charges?
grant played 86 games as a pro hockey player, and in his 86th start, he was in a fight on the ice, and ended up in the hospital.
he never played again.
his motor functions were impaired.
so, there might be truth.
and how did we not see this coming?
do you have a minute?
so, this was my case. - Yes. And supposedly, a winner.
which it still is, but I have some strategic information I could...
share with you.
if it weren't for the restrictions of your suspension?
Yes, which, as I understand it, prevents me from talking about future strategy, but not...
past. That would be updating?
which is within my rights.
yet, we seem to be in here whispering.
consulting.
what do you got?
bring hockey into it.
into our case? - Yes.
their defense is based on modified comparative negligence.
if our client is responsible for 50% of his accident, he loses, but...
if professional hockey is responsible for his injuries, then he can collect.
and this is your suggested strategy?
it is.
well, Diane, this is a mistake.
hockey will never pay.
to pay would be to open up themselves to hundreds of lawsuits from former players.
it's part of the strategy.
pull hockey into this.
they'll want to bury it quickly and quietly.
we found our deep pocket.
Yes, and in addition, the APHL lawyers will delay.
so we'll get a three-month continuance to build our case.
you want me on it?
I do, but a low priority.
and, Alicia, do you have a moment?
Yes.
so, we want to keep you happy here, Alicia.
we value all your hard work these past few months.
thank you.
given that, the equity partners have agreed on paper to a bump in your pay.
great.
Yes, but we want to be clear.
there are 11 other third-year associates, so, we can't afford an across-the-board raise.
I understand.
so, here's what we're offering.
I know, it's not as much as you think you deserve, but take it as a demonstration of our confidence in your future.
thought you might want something.
no, thanks.
you don't know who's leaking to the disciplinary board about me, do you?
no.
you want me to look?
no. Just if you hear anything.
you in trouble?
sticking to the letter of the law.
you gonna leave me here with two beers?
you'll find somebody.
what's up?
you want a beer?
no. Thanks.
you're sure? It's open.
Kalinda, I...
I'm sorry.
I can't help it. I want to move on, but I...
Yeah, I...I get it.
look, we're working together. That's good enough, isn't it?
Yeah.
it's just not easy for me... - It's okay, Alicia.
I get it.
I'm Louis Canning, Your Honor.
I'll be representing the interests of the All Professional Hockey League.
welcome, Mr. Canning; you saw the amended complaint?
I did, Your Honor, and a baroque piece of work it is.
baroque, and yet, if Snow Plain insists on a modified comparative negligence defense,
I see no other option than to offer the plaintiff a chance to combine charges of negligence.
Darn.
Yes, Your Honor, we accept the modified complaint.
then I expect you'll be asking for an extension?
Oh, no, no, we're ready to go.
right now.
in fact, we welcome the chance to defend the honor of professional hockey.
he thinks you're not prepared.
excuse me, Will, you can't be saying anything.
we need to move quickly on all fronts.
I'll get on with Kalinda.
and they still can't clear it, as Olsen keeps it in, sends it down low.
Duverney, in the corner, tied up right now with Raker.
and here we go.
that's Cameron Raker, Minnesota's enforcer.
you just had to expect this.
a lot of bad blood between these two teaMs. Oh, my!
Raker landed one square on. He's flat on...
there was a criminal battery investigation in 2009, but charges were never brought.
it would be helpful to get that investigation.
I'm on it.
good, and Will has a friend who's a top neurologist at Northwestern.
a Dr. Wedd, he specializes in sports injuries.
he's agreed to testify as to how team doctors mishandled Grant.
I'll prep him. - Great.
Mr. Canning thinks he's caught us off guard.
let's show him he hasn't, hmm?
Hi, Marina, I've decided against the house.
I just don't have the money for the down payment.
Yes, I'll call if anything changes, but I don't think it will.
this is me in reporter mode.
Ah, very impressive.
how was London?
London-y?
how was here?
you're looking pretty casual today.
a lot has happened.
I'm gonna be taping this, if that's all right.
it is, but I don't have much to say.
sporting News has me covering this hockey lawsuit.
I'm just wondering, are you crazy?
going up against hockey?
here's the problem, Miss Linnata.
it was my suit, but I've had a little legal trouble of my own, and I've been suspended from practicing law for six months.
you?
Really?
what happened?
I cut some corners.
I'm a corner-cutter.
so this is a 12-step program?
Yes, step three, admitting my faults.
I had to hand off the case to other fine lawyers here, so you probably want to ask Julius Cain whether he's crazy to go after hockey.
and who's the other lawyer?
what?
you said there were two lawyers. Who's the other lawyer?
Yes. Alicia.
how is she doing? - Good.
good. - I'm so glad for her.
well...it was good seeing you, Will.
you're looking good. - Thank you.
you are, too.
good luck with your other nine steps.
the league ended up suspending Cameron Raker for the rest of the season, so the state's attorney at the time, Peter Florrick, thought it wasn't worth pursuing.
but what was the charge gonna be?
I mean, why was this treated different than any other fight on the ice?
well, the concussion was severe, and we were looking into it being a premeditated hit.
Raker targeted our client?
the whole team targeted your client.
any chance I could see the investigative report on that?
or just a peek?
funny that you've been sent here and not Kalinda.
I volunteered.
Really?
Why?
I don't know.
how are you doing?
well, I'm not in the deputy's office.
Yes, I,um...I wasn't gonna say anything.
things have changed. Self-inflicted wound.
are you safe?
nobody's told me otherwise, and that usually means no.
thank you.
cameron Raker. I'm a professional ice hockey left-winger.
and you're the team's enforcer?
objection, Your Honor, that's not an official hockey position.
Mrs. Florrick is just using the term to bias these proceedings.
I don't understand; What's the bias?
well, an enforcer is someone on a hockey team who responds to supposedly dirty plays from the opposing team by attacking aggressively...
and thank you, Mrs. Florrick, for that biased definition.
well, do you want me to explain the bias or not?
okay, thank you.
I am enlightened without bias.
Mr. Raker, what is the official title for your position?
left wing.
okay, that's what we'll call it from now on. Left wing.
and I...
Mr. Raker...
in your capacity as a left-winger, did your coach ever ask you to violently respond to a dirty play?
he asked me to check offenders who crossed the line, you know?
and has he ever asked you to take a player out?
if you mean "out" by checking those offenders legally, then yes.
that's Christian Lund, your teammate, the star player under contract for 6. 3 million?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I've got to come closer; I can't see.
Oh, certainly, Your Honor.
and who is that who took out your star player?
him.
devastating hit by Duverney on Lund.
and the best man on the ice is taken down by a fourth-liner.
was your team outraged by this hit, Mr. Raker?
I wouldn't say we were outraged.
we were concerned.
lund is pretty important to us.
but did you see this postgame interview?
you hit us like that, it's not over.
we've got your number, Duverney.
we'll see you in February.
Nope, didn't see it.
but isn't that your jersey, Mr. Raker, in the background within earshot of this interview?
looks like it. I-I don't remember.
and by,"We'll see you in February,"
did your coach mean the next time you were playing against my client's team?
I don't know, could have meant anything, really.
but didn't it mean this game on February 15?
I don't know.
maybe. I guess.
we've got a problem here.
no, it's your neurologist friend at Northwestern,
Dr. Wedd, the one we want to hire for the trial.
he says he's never heard of you.
he what?
Yeah, he said he was too busy to talk, and then he just rushed out of the office.
you know what I think?
yeah,'cause I'm thinking it, too.
canning got to him. - Paid him off.
do we have a second-best option?
no, not for hockey impact studies.
you may have another play.
given that I can't suggest new legal strategy,
I think you'll know what I'm about to say.
find out if Canning paid him off, and see if we can prove fraud.
obviously, I can't comment, but it sounds like you're in movement.
I am.
following your neurologist friend to see if he's going to meet up with Canning.
obviously, I can't comment.
I will keep you in the loop.
not at my urging.
Bye.
okay, let me know when you find out more.
back to our old ways, are we?
and what ways might those be?
paying off our neurological expert.
are you happy at Lockhart & Gardner, Mrs. Florrick?
I am happy.
you don't look happy.
why are you second chair to Julius when you're doing all the heavy lifting?
because Julius is an equity partner.
and you're not; Why is that?
okay.
here's the problem.
I see how we treat lawyers who are poached.
they're the first ones out the door.
they're the ones we don't trust, and that is why I will not be poached.
the problem at Lockhart & Gardner is they treat it like a family.
they treat loyalty as an absolute good.
and it's not? - At home it is;
at work it's talent and professionalism that matter.
that's why I don't hold a grudge.
you come and work for me, you'll be judged on the value of your work and only your work.
let me make you an offer.
no.
afraid Mommy and Daddy at Lockhart & Gardner might get upset?
I'll see you in court. - See you in court.
and, Dr. Rubich, as the team doctor, you were the first to assess Grant's injuries?
Yes, I examined Grant in the dressing room right after the fight.
and you tested him for symptoms of concussion?
Yes.
how long was the examination? - About 15 minutes.
and then you cleared him to get back into the game?
he seemed fine.
he, even made a pretty hard check in the last minute.
saved the team a goal.
and yet, three days later, he was in the hospital and never played again.
Yes, that's my understanding.
when you conducted my client's exit physical, what did you write in the file in regard to head injuries?
I didn't write anything.
I saw no need to.
Dr. Rubich, what's a baseline test?
it's a neuro-psychological test we run on players before the start of the season.
in the event they suffer a head injury during a game, we can determine if it's a concussion by comparing the results.
and did you perform those tests on Grant Duverney after he was knocked down by Cameron Raker?
Yes, and the results were identical with the baseline.
there were no signs of brain trauma.
so, in other words, you did your job?
Yes.
thank you, Doctor.
we need our neurologist.
Kalinda thinks he'll meet with Canning after court.
Hello?
Yeah, guess who our neurologist is with?
no, not Canning. Frank Michael Thomas.
what, the actor? - And the lawyer.
I don't understand, what does he have to do with hockey?
I have no idea, but I thought maybe you should come down and talk to him.
no, I can't right now.
just take some pictures and...
Yeah, just do what you normally do. I'll talk to you.
just call Alicia and Will.
Hello, Jack.
shall I assume you're 40 minutes late because of Australian standard time?
I wish it were the case.
I also wish you won't hate me when I tell you I have a complication.
another time, Diane, I promise.
just tell me you don't hate me.
I don't hate you.
go uncomplicate your complication.
you've reached the personal voice mail of Kurt McVeigh.
I'm unavailable right...
can I have the check, please?
yes?
Oh, I'm sorry. I,uh... I-Is this...?
are you here to see Kurt?
Yes.
I hope I'm not, uh... - No, come in.
Diane. - Hello.
and surprise.
after what, a year?
did you just happen to be in the neighborhood?
no.
but I think I should call the cab back and return to mine. Good-bye.
it's a 40-mile drive.
and that's when I found my voice.
acting is all about the voice.
well, Will Gardner. How you doing?
good, sir.
till I found you stole our neurologist.
Really? I didn't realize he was in a position to be stolen.
nice to meet you, ladies.
so you're working for Louis Canning now?
Nope.
you're suing hockey?
Yep.
class action, seven players.
head injuries? - Yep.
APHL's been mishandling head injuries ever since the first time they strapped a metal blade to the underside of a boot.
I'm hoping to make it right for these players.
then join us.
pool our resources.
make the league fight a multifront war.
well, I appreciate the offer, but, my answer's got to be:
not a chance in hell.
Louis Canning is using your case to establish legal precedent before I file mine.
whupping you makes it easier for him to fight me.
which is why he was prepared and so eager to rush to court.
Yep. Well, good luck.
hockey will be fighting you to the last man.
and you're going to lose.
you're going to lose bad.
at least we're offering a choice.
unlike your socialist, fascist campaign, ours is a horse race.
with four hobbled horses.
not too hobbled to beat your man, Obama.
did you think we were going to listen to the gray hairs, hand it to Romney?
bloody battle's healthy-- fires people up.
Yes, particularly billionaires putting down payments on candidates.
Ah, the Highland Park liberal.
cries foul about the evil Republican Super PACs as she writes a check to Obama's.
shall we drink to your allegedly non-activist Supreme Court?
right. Scalia, Alito, the rest of the big, scary five.
four.
we're wearing Kennedy down.
all part of our clever Highland Park liberal plan.
well, I would love to stay and keep proving you wrong, but I've got an early forensics class, and my instructor here gets surly if we're late, so...
it was nice meeting you, Diane.
and you, Miranda. Keep breathing that fire.
see you tomorrow, Kurt. - Yeah.
she's wonderful.
crack shot, too.
crime labs will be climbing all over each other to hire her.
so she's your...
you could call her that.
well, you two certainly are of, like minds.
except I like a good argument.
consensus is less...
interesting.
hello.
is this a regular thing?
dropping in on men you haven't seen in a year?
I could use some direction here.
wh-what exactly is this?
it's me missing you.
and hoping you feel likewise.
the real estate lady called.
she thinks that they'll take ten percent down.
what?
the real estate lady should not be telling you that.
she's calling here because she wants to get you two excited about the house.
no, she was just being nice.
I'll talk to her. She should not be calling here.
you're really trying to make it work, huh?
I don't know.
I-I knew they'd come after me.
I was a marked man.
because of your check in that first game on their star, Christian Lund?
Yes.
cameron Raker was six-foot-three, 225 pounds.
how big were you, Grant?
Five-eleven, 190.
yet, when he goaded you, you fought him.
I had no choice.
if... if I hadn't fought, they would have gone after one of our star players.
how can you be so sure?
cause we would have done the same thing.
it's... it's the game.
no further questions.
first, let me start by saying how sorry I am about your recent medical developments.
if I can offer some advice from personal experience:
one day at a time.
thank you.
so this baseline test the doctor gave you at the start of the season
did you fake yours?
Did-did I...?
I'm-I-I don't...I'm not sure I understand...
weren't you told by a teammate to fake the test?
you know, tap on the keyboard a little slower or mix up the numbers on the test grid.
that way, if you suffered a head injury during a game, the team doctors would see similar results and clear you to play.
objection. Hearsay.
my apologies, Your Honor.
I should have submitted this evidence deposition from one Anthony Murillo, who was Mr. Duverney's roommate during his rookie season.
Mr. Duverney, one more time.
did you fake your baseline test?
Yes.
so, if you hadn't faked your test, they would have been able to diagnose you and treat you properly.
Objection-- beyond the witness's expertise.
withdrawn. No...no further questions, Your Honor.
grant, why did you fake your baseline test?
for the same reason a lot of players do:
I was afraid of losing my job.
what are you doing right now?
Diane has me on something. What do you need?
how quickly can you upload a video online?
no fingerprints.
Mrs. Florrick. My driver is still at the dentist.
can I get a lift?
how much flexibility is there?
well, we offer telecommuting.
and then there's day care at work.
no, I have an issue.
my apartment has gone condo, and I have the possibility of purchasing a house.
and you need money for the down payment?
Yes, and a consistent higher level in pay.
I have private tuition, and I'm trying to save for college.
I'll work up an offer.
no. No, I'm fine.
clearly, you're not fine, or we wouldn't be sitting here.
Mr. Canning, seriously, I'm fine.
all right, let's leave it at this. I'll work up an offer.
you'll think about it.
we'll talk on the phone later.
and that's it-- no pressure.
nobody's doing anything wrong here, Alicia.
this is how America works.
so you're familiar with this Web site?
Yes. RinkFights. com. It's not sanctioned by our league.
well, then, you're aware that it lets fans vote on who will win the fight, that the players actually have fight cards with win-loss records?
Yes.
as APHL's chief administrative officer, you have the final say over league copyright issues, correct?
I do.
the clips the Web site plays are game broadcasts.
do you grant them permission to use these?
absolutely not.
as I said, this is not an APHL-sanctioned Web site.
let's talk about another Web site that uses your clips.
this is a recent Boston-Detroit game.
it was posted online yesterday by an employee of our firm.
no.
two hours.
in the eight years since RinkFights. com has been online, how many cease and desist letters have you issued them?
none.
is that because you encourage fans enthusiasm for fights?
no, of course not.
then why aren't you removing these fight videos?
well, I guess we'll start.
thank you for the encouragement.
and thank you for that damaging testimony.
objection.
sustained.
I think we should all have a little sit-down.
about?
me helping you win this thing.
the truth-- are you in bed with him?
am I in bed with him? - Yeah.
that's what I've been hearing from unnamed sources.
and you don't think suits like yours and Mr. Thomas's will hurt the sport of ice hockey?
no.
is fighting essential to the sport of ice hockey?
some think it's a safety valve.
without it, you'd see a lot more sticks swinging out there.
not in college hockey. Not in the Olympics.
you would get ejected.
but aren't the stakes a little higher in the pros?
players' livelihoods are on the line.
then why are there no real fights during the championship series?
sounds like your closing argument.
Thanks. - No problem.
if you need any more, you should talk to Julius.
so you were in London, right?
setting up your magazine's operation for the Olympics?
Yes.
how was it? - Rainy.
you slept with Will after I left town, didn't you?
I promise you he didn't tell me.
will didn't put up much of a fight when I told him about the London offer.
and then I e-mailed him right after I got there, but no response.
I chalked it up to his being so busy, but Will never not responds.
I knew you two had history, so...
two plus two.
I think that's a conversation you should have with Will.
you're right.
inappropriate of me.
you know, for the record, it wasn't over between Will and I when I left for London.
then you slept with him, and it was over.
we appreciate the change of heart.
we could use whatever help you can give us.
shouldn't we wait for Ms. Lockhart before getting to brass tacks?
I understood she was gonna be a part of this.
Diane got pulled away on another case.
but we'll bring her up to speed.
so be it.
don't look at this as a benevolent gesture
I just think you folks did a hell of a job in court today, and it looks like helping you might actually help me after all.
I'm sorry, would you excuse me, please?
of course.
now, you just promise me this
when you use this against Louis Canning, try to draw blood.
and you're telling me in accordance to court rules.
very honorable of you. - Dr. Wedd is a neurologist...
who has repeatedly lambasted the league for its approach to head injuries.
I've read all his articles.
he has a unique gift for repeating himself.
what Dr. Wedd is testifying to isn't in any of his articles.
Really?
Dr. Wedd approached the league with a rigorous protocol for evaluating and treating players with head injuries
one that wouldn't scare players into faking baseline tests.
had the league not dismissed Dr. Wedd so quickly,
grant Duverney would have been properly diagnosed and treated.
I can show you the rejection e-mail that Dr. Wedd received from the league VP. It's a quick read.
I'll run it by the league, see what they want to do.
one more thing.
you have 24 hours.
fishing?
at Horsetail Lake. It's an easy drive from the city.
we'd make it a day trip.
Kurt, have we met?
I'll do all the baiting.
Oh, would you have it any other way?
we pack a lunch, we rent a boat, and we breathe something other than car exhaust for a few hours, and the good news for you-- cell phone coverage.
hold on a second.
Hello? - You don't hate me, Right?
hello.
I said I'd take you out some other time, so I'm calling to find out that other time.
when do you have in mind?
I was thinking Friday night.
unwind after work.
I, uh... Can you hold on a second?
Kurt? - No, Jack.
Oh, hold on a second.
who's Kurt?
he's j... he's just a-a business associate.
I-I will be right back, uh...
Jack. - Jack. Hold on.
Hello?
look, if Horsetail Lake doesn't cut it for you, then...
no, no, no. It sounds fun.
when were you...thinking?
Saturday morning. Pick you up at 8: 00.
perfect. I will see you then. Bye.
still there?
Yep.
friday night sounds good.
it's pretty darn hard being on the outside looking in, huh?
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels turn round and round.
what do you need, Eli?
I did not leak to the disciplinary board.
but you're gonna tell me who did?
I can tell you my suspicions.
david Lee. - Yup.
that's funny.
david Lee was in here yesterday saying you leaked it.
he did not.
he did. - No.
no, you're playing us against each other.
as long as we're fighting each other, you're safe.
I don't think I'll ever be...safe.
it's good talking to you, Eli.
excuse me, Diane?
Yes, Alicia?
I have received a formal job offer from Louis Canning.
he approached me several months ago and I declined, but he's been persistent.
and you're considering it?
I'd like to stay, but his offer...
would go a long way to helping me cover a mortgage payment.
it wasn't Louis Canning who gave you a chance after 13 years away from the law.
this is his offer.
if I stay at the firm, it has to be more.
you'll give me till the end of the week?
no.
I can't.
Yep, everybody changes.
end of the week, Alicia, or you can clean out your desk right now.
you've heard nothing?
no text, no e-mail, nothing.
I would've thought Canning would want to end this, keep the league from getting skewered in court.
fine, put Dr. Wedd on the stand.
Mr. Cain, do you have a minute?
can it wait until after court?
there is no court.
I just spoke to Judge Rigby.
the Snow Plain Corporation has reevaluated its position on the original case.
we're now prepared to settle.
w-well, we're way beyond that point, Mr. Hines.
the only acceptable number is the full $5 million.
good. Because that's what we're offering.
talk to your client and let me know.
what just happened?
I think we just won.
No! No, no, no, no!
no bonus!
she just won a case.
Alicia did not win a case-- she was handed a settlement.
which we wouldn't have gotten but for her performance.
forgive me, Miyagi, I forgot who was guiding Alicia.
and since when do you have a problem with winning money for clients?
who cares about the client! Will!
tell them how disastrous it would be if Alicia walks.
I don't care what she's paid.
I just can't afford to lose another body right now.
look, we all know the issue.
why don't we just put it to a vote.
all those in favor. - No.
she's getting her bonus.
I'm invoking managing-partner prerogative.
you can't be serious.
what are we talking about?
the firm's bylaws allow the managing partner to act unilaterally.
under extenuating circumstances.
we must have missed the memo.
apparently, we're now Stalin & Associates.
well, if it means Alicia sticks around, I second it.
you can't second it. - The matter is closed.
any other business?
you just stuck your neck out for a third-year associate.
your suspension has left us exposed.
I stuck my neck out for the future of this firm.
I'm not sure what time I can get out tonight.
but thank you very much, Mr. Canning.
is something wrong?
you used me. - No.
the firm made it attractive for me to stay. It was unexpected.
unexpected as a knife in the back.
y... You should still be pleased.
you did well for your client.
whatever deal you cut with Snow Plain deflects any liability away from the league.
no, I'm pleased-- because I needed to smoke Frank Michael Thomas out, find out what he had for his class action.
and thanks to your good lawyering, now I know, and I'll be ready for him.
so I guess what I want to say to you, Alicia, is thank you.
thank you.
anything you hee would be really helpful.
okay. Okay, good. Thanks.
the other day when you brought the beer, I wasn't...
it's all right.
they were warm, anyway.
look, I can't go back to the way it was before.
there's just been too much.
I know.
but... I'd like to try to make it work.
it's just that everything...
it has to be...
on the table.
I can't be the only one being forthcoming.
I can't be the only one being honest.
can... you do that?
Yeah.
okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
he could be president.
Oh, please, stop.
what? He's handsome enough.
he's certainly tall enough.
Peter isn't even sure if he's running for governor.
he'll run for governor.
I don't know.
he has to decide by next week.
Hello, Jackie.
Alicia. - You have a moment?
I do.
I haven't seen you for a while, Alicia. How are you?
why, Jackie? Why'd you do it?
why did I...do it?
the house. The house Zach and Grace grew up in.
the house I lived in for 13 years.
why did I...put a down payment on it?
Yes.
I didn't want to see it go to another family.
you knew I put an offer on it, and you didn't want me to get it.
I... I was visiting a friend in Highland Park, and I saw the "for sale" sign, and...
I decided to put a down payment on it.
because you just so happened to need a four-bedroom, 3,400-square-foot house?
no, it's not for me. It's for Peter and the kids.
we struggled for three years, Jackie.
we lost our home.
we took Zach and Grace out of school.
where was all this generosity...
Alicia, I offered you a place in my home, I offered you loans, and every time you said,"I want to do it on my own."
well, I don't have that many years left, and I'd like to leave something for my children.
and you'll live there with them.
what?
you're giving Peter and the kids the house, and you will live there with them.
I don't know.
I-I don't want to presume.
well, you're finally getting what you wanted, Jackie.
and what is that?
replacing me.
Alicia, I am not replacing you.
you left.
I'm stopping you.
I'm not really sure how you'll do that.
I'm a lawyer; watch me.
Lindsey... Megan... and Pamela.
these three young women have spent five years in prison, Your Honor, five years, for a murder they did not commit. - Excuse me, Your Honor, that is still unproven. - Yes, but what is proven is that the DNA tying these girls to the body was bogus.
again, Your Honor, an assertion.
Yes, but it's not looking good for you, is it, Mr. Agos?
this is the fifth case I've had through here due to the malfeasance of the Illinois Crime Lab, and I've overturned all of them.
but those four cases were built only on DNA.
here, there was physical evidence.
the shoe prints of all three of these women were found in the vicinity of the body.
cause it was on a trail that they used every day.
and witnesses at the summer camp testified to them repeatedly bullying Rosa Torres on the day of her murder, Your Honor.
it is unfair to discount the totality of that evidence due to one simple infraction.
"one simple infraction"? Really?
the cornerstone of your case was the DNA...
the jury was lied to.
not by the state's attorney's office.
which is why the state's attorney's office should share in our anger at this injustice.
they should be agitating for the immediate release of these women, not fighting against it.
okay. Thank you, everyone. You can sit down now.
given the egregious nature of these crime lab infractions,
I have no choice other than to vacate these convictions.
your Honor, we would move for an immediate release.
Mr. Agos, do you intend to proceed on the original charges?
we do, Your Honor.
and we would oppose bail.
it was denied in the original trial, and we see no compelling reason for it to be granted now.
I would agree. The defendants are held for retrial.
what's that mean? I stay inside?
just for the moment.
but this was the big one, getting the conviction vacated.
I'm gonna cry.
it's good, Lindsey.
I know, it's just, I don't think they'll let me out.
I have this nightmare of this open door.
every time I get close to it, it shuts in my face.
it's okay.
damn it.
key thing is, we kept them behind bars.
you know what this is, don't you?
I'm paying for the sins of the past.
crime lab screws up under Childs...
I have to pay the price.
do we retry?
they bullied and killed that girl.
not only that... I promised the Torres family that
I wouldn't let the killers of their daughter go unpunished.
well... Judge Romano seems to be leaning against this.
it's crime lab fatigue.
offer them an Alford plea.
I've got to get this off our ledger.
Hello? Yeah. Hold on.
everybody has to sign on though.
if that's what you want.
Hey, Alicia, what's up?
what?
she said she bought the house for you and the kids.
she said what?
this is the first I've heard of it.
it's not that I don't want you in there, Peter, it's just weird being separated and having the kids wanting to be in the house with you while I'm on the outs.
Yeah.
But...y-you were thinking of buying the house, too, right?
well, yeah, because of this condo conversion.
Yeah, but then it would've been you in the house with the kids and me on the outs.
you're right. I-I'm sorry, we should've talked.
okay. Well...Don't worry, I will speak to Jackie.
thank you.
must be odd working in the same town as your husband.
Nope, it isn't.
what can I help you with, Mr. Kresteva?
Mike. Nice kids. - Thanks, Mike.
it's just, how do you handle it, fighting criminal cases when your husband's on the other side?
with great delicacy.
I like you, Alicia. You have wit.
thank you.
I didn't think it ended so well the last time we spoke, Mike.
so what is it that you need?
I thought it ended pretty well.
I never try to make enemies.
whenever I disagree with someone, I think:
today I can't see their side, but tomorrow, who knows?
so y-you see my side?
well, I've come to present you with the report from our blue ribbon panel.
I recused myself.
Yes, but we've changed our conclusions...
you convinced us.
we censure the officers for not announcing themselves, shooting an unarmed man, and possibly even placing a drop gun in his hand to cover their tracks.
and it also censures my husband for covering it up?
well... yes.
truth is truth, isn't it?
you wouldn't have us compromise the truth out of some misplaced deference to family connections?
no. So then you understand why I have to recuse myself.
that's why I'm here.
I'm offering you a chance to write a minority report.
and what would that say?
whatever you want.
whatever your conscience guides you to say.
I think I'll decline.
Mrs. Florrick, I know you don't trust me, but I've come around to your side.
all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent, so...
don't remain silent.
hello. How are you?
I'm good, Diane. You look great.
you, too.
now, don't you dare think about poaching Alicia.
we've got our hooks into her.
actually, I was here to poach you.
Alicia just asked me in to discuss our blue ribbon panel.
Really? Well, I hope that all works out.
I'm sure it will.
anyway, Alicia, thank you. It was most helpful.
and thank you, Diane, for putting Alicia on the panel.
Well...odd that.
Yes.
so, uh, Cary called, and we have an Alford plea.
Really? - Yes.
my guess is they're worried about a lawsuit.
Lindsey will need some hand-holding.
we don't want her to take it?
no, we just...want her to know all the facts.
so, what do I do?
don't sleep with other people.
and that will get me elected?
I'd vote for you.
here's how people will elect you as Illinois state senator.
you're a woman. - Thank you.
there are three other men in the race.
they will split the male vote.
you will win the female vote, but...
only if you win the female vote.
Meaning...?
female voters are traditional. They don't like a modern woman.
and that's why you're going to stand beside me, stand by your woman?
Vanessa, that is not what I was saying.
but it's the point, isn't it?
having my ex-husband approving of me makes me more traditional.
Vanessa. - What?
I'm not saying we have to mean it.
I'm talking about politics.
just politics? - Yes.
what else is there?
I don't know.
you tell me.
a what?
an Alford plea. It's a form of a...a guilty plea - No. - Wait, just...
just hear us. - I already said...
Lindsey, listen.
we'll do whatever you want, but with an Alford plea, you get out.
you acknowledge to the prosecution that they have enough evidence to convict, but you get out.
do they? - Have enough evidence to convict?
without the DNA, normally we would say no, but you never know for sure what a jury will do.
so if I take this...plea...
the state's attorney agrees to a sentence of time served.
you go free. Now. Immediately.
Really?
Yeah, Megan, but there are drawbacks.
you won't be able to clear your name.
you'll be a convicted felon for the rest of your life.
and one parole violation, and you're right back here.
but if I don't take it, I have to stay here?
Yes.
at least until you get a new trial.
and that's how long?
I don't know.
I want you to have a complete picture here, Pamela.
the state's attorney offers this plea because they're afraid of being sued.
as part of the plea agreement, you have to promise not to sue.
but I get out? - Yes. That's why they do it.
they dangle freedom in front of your eyes to get a guilty plea.
and if I turned it down and sued?
the last crime lab lawsuit against Cook County resulted in a $10 million reward.
$10 million? That's...
and any award you would get, you would have to split three ways.
do you think I should reject this plea?
no. We're just laying out the options.
we have a very good case against the state's attorney's office.
we won a lawsuit last year on exactly these kind of crime lab missteps.
and it's important to hold these people responsible.
but...
we're not the ones who have to sit in prison for another year.
you have no idea what that kind of money would mean.
my family...
it would change everything for us.
I guess the question, then, is...
is it worth it to spend another year in prison to maybe change everything?
more or less.
and how long do I have to decide?
72 hours.
what would you do?
I have no idea.
so, what do you think?
I think she needs the money.
who doesn't?
a recently released report from an independent police review authority has found evidence of a cover-up meant to protect a Chicago police officer.
this panel investigated the controversial shooting of an unarmed man on Chicago's El Train.
this report, exhaustively investigated by a prestigious blue ribbon panel that even included the wife of the state's attorney himself, has found a cover-up by local officials, including the state's attorney.
Kresteva also dropped a bombshell that should complicate the ongoing Illinois political scene.
I am running for governor of the great state of Illinois.
together, we need to stop corruption like this.
we need to stop people like the state's attorney from covering up police shootings like this one.
what's wrong?
everything.
I was never the best father or husband or person, really.
but then something happened to me.
my son was diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and I just woke up, like Paul on the road to Damascus, except I was at a Bears tailgater stripped down to my underwear.
damn it. Damn it.
what's wrong?
I just didn't see something coming.
have you seen my shoe?
it's on your foot. - Yeah, the other one.
who's that?
the competition.
my competition? - No, Peter's.
you're thinking about him, aren't you?
you're in bed with me, but you're thinking about him.
you're joking, right? That was a joke?
come here.
no, I need my shoe. - Eli, come here.
Oh, my God, look at this, ten messages.
he's been trying to reach me all morning.
come over here.
this was a mistake, wasn't it?
Yes.
now go off to your Peter.
not without my shoe...
our first date.
Yeah, this was a mistake.
the wife of the state's attorney, Alicia Florrick, asked me into her office and told me if I changed this report and exonerated her husband, that she would sign it, too.
damn it. Damn it!
so, we only get the Alford plea if we all agree.
so, where are we?
Pamela wants to hold out for a civil suit.
I'm sure she does after your sales job.
excuse me, are you accusing me?
it's money to you.
it's a potential $10 million lawsuit, and you get 20% of that.
you can't get 20% of freedom. - Okay, let's keep it civil - Tommy? - Megan wants to take the plea.
she was beaten up in prison yesterday.
so, here we go with the emotional blackmail.
no, it's not blackmail; I'm just telling you the facts.
she's being targeted in prison.
and this talk of a civil suit's just making it worse.
what about your client?
Lindsey hasn't made up her mind yet.
she doesn't want to admit to something she didn't do.
exactly.
but she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life in prison, either.
look, we all know this case is a slam dunk.
the only reason the state's attorney is even offering us the Alford plea is because he's on the run.
you're married to him, right? Tell us.
I can't speak to that.
well, none of us can.
we all know of cases which seemed like slam dunks and turned out not to be.
okay, so we have three days to figure out whether we have a slam dunk.
I agree.
our clients are looking for an assessment of their chances, and the prosecution is using our dissention against us.
so let's use this remaining time to see what case we have, okay?
you're on it, right?
Yeah, I put a call into the medical examiner's office.
and, um, Kalinda, can I hire you to look into something for me?
sure, what is it?
just a...
I think there might be something wrong in a financial arrangement.
okay, sure, whose?
I will need to know.
my mother-in-law's.
Hey, bum.
what are you up to here? The slumber camp murder?
Yeah, we're trying to win them some money, but what happened to kids today?
they don't want money. They want freedom.
you look good suspended.
Yep. You got any pointers?
don't get rusty.
you've been suspended, what, six months, right?
Yep.
I was a year.
addiction. Cocaine use.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, some of my best summations were done high.
but don't I seem calmer these days?
you do.
so, what are you doing?
I'm reading a book I wrote.
how is it? - Not good.
sorry. - No, it's just one more thing I know I can't do.
I have something you might be interested in.
behind the Bar.
it's a support group for sanctioned lawyers.
disbarment, suspension, drugs...
sounds exciting.
come on, what are you doing anyway?
just lying around all day?
didn't we almost go out on a date three years ago?
Yeah, you stood me up.
I was in rehab.
so, we'll make this our date. Come on.
what are you doing tomorrow night?
Kalinda, where you been?
hibernating.
you guys haven't been too forthcoming lately.
Yeah, well, that's all changing.
we're all loosening up around here.
Really? Why's that?
I don't know, but, uh, your name is no longer dirt.
no, no, no, no, no, no. Into the lab.
no, that way.
what do you need?
summer camp killing, 2007.
three girl killers.
Oh, yeah, that one. I thought that was getting kicked.
Yeah, state's attorney's office is considering retrying.
Ah, yes, dead horse beaten yet again.
come on.
16-year-old girl.
three other girls brought her into the woods.
they stabbed her eight times, slashed her carotid.
weapon was never found.
and look at this. - What?
a note for you.
Kalinda, One step ahead of you. Good luck
asa Agos, he's, uh, one step ahead of you.
for the moment.
she was found without her clothes?
Yeah, they thought rape at first...
cops always think rape...
but no semen, no penetration, so they thought the killer stripped her down to make it look like a rape.
what's this? - Hypostasis.
lividity caused by the blood settling after death.
no, this. - I don't know.
but no lividity there.
probably something in contact with her body, something on the ground.
no.
it's on the other side of the ankle, too.
Oh, my God, you're right.
you solved it.
Alicia Florrick asked me into her office and told me if I changed this report and exonerated her husband that she would...
it's a lie, Eli; He's lying.
so, you weren't on this blue ribbon panel?
no, I was, but I...
so, you didn't meet with him?
I met with him.
I mean, he met with me.
he came here, but he came here to ask me if I wanted to write a minority report, and I said no.
so, all that stuff about Peter trying to cover up a shooting, that's not true?
unfortunately, I can't say anything about those proceedings because they were confidential.
okay, so that's it.
wait, Eli, you have to put out a statement or something.
saying what? - Saying that it's not true.
I-I didn't ask him to stop the report.
why would we do that?
because he's lying, Eli.
Alicia, people lie, and politicians are just people.
the problem is when you run around putting out statements saying that people lied, it just brings more attention to the lie.
people think there's something wrong with you for making such a fuss about it.
people think you lied because you're making a fuss about a lie.
that's crazy.
it's a 24-hour news story.
it'll go away unless we take the bait.
but it's...
it makes me look bad, and-and he gets away with it?
Yep.
you have to let it go, Alicia.
it's the big leagues.
you file a few off.
it's a bicycle clip.
you wear it on your ankle to keep your pants from getting caught in the bike chain.
which one is this for, my mother-in-law?
the victim's body.
something was pressed against her ankles when she was murdered.
here and here; that's why there was no lividity.
but there's nothing in the police report that says she was riding a bike that night.
I know.
and yet...
so, where was she riding it?
a bicycle?
there was a chance that Rosa rode a bicycle that night just before she was killed.
but she didn't have a bike.
I mean, we weren't allowed to bring anything.
they didn't want any of us off grounds.
what about the counselors?
Mary Jane had a bike.
the counselor in Rosa's cabin, she had a mountain bike.
she was always going off riding.
good, thanks. That's helpful.
wait.
what about the plea?
what are Pamela and Megan gonna do?
Oh, yes. Pamela doesn't want to take the Alford plea, but Megan does.
Megan's being beaten up in prison.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
maybe I should take the plea.
here's what we're trying to do, Lindsey.
we want to line up the evidence to demonstrate to Judge Romano that the state's attorney has no evidence to hold you to trial.
they're merely trying to neutralize a civil suit.
if we're successful, you won't have to plead guilty.
you'll just be released.
but you have to do that before the plea expires?
Yes, that's why we're pursuing this evidence.
okay, and you want me to sit tight?
Yes, just for a little while longer.
then I will.
tell Megan to stay strong.
thank you, Alicia.
you still having nightmares?
no.
so, we have evidence that the victim, Rosa Torres, might have ridden a bike the night she was killed.
I understand that, uh, you had a bike, right?
Yeah. Why?
and you reported it stolen?
but then you found it, right?
Yeah, a week later. Why?
Rosa borrowed it that night, intending to return it, but then, she was murdered.
how do you know all this?
where did you find it?
what does it matter?
well, it matters, because Lindsey is innocent, and my guess is,
Rosa borrowed your bike that night to meet someone off the grounds, and he or she moved her body back onto the grounds, but never knew about the bike.
so, where'd you find it?
I want complete separation between the legal and the political.
anyway, I think you all get it, and with that, I need a moment.
Alicia, good to see you.
I'm sorry I didn't say anything about my press conference yesterday.
I didn't want to let my campaign get in the way of the panel.
so, I invited you to my office?
You...Excuse me?
you said, I invited you to my office, and tried to get you to change the report about Peter?
Yes.
which is a lie.
which part?
all of it.
first of all, do you want some water, or something to drink?
no.
and second of all, I'm not...
I'm not sure what you're disagreeing about.
I'm not disagreeing about anything.
I'm telling you to stop lying about me.
Alicia, I'm not lying about anything.
you invited me into your office.
no, I didn't.
you came to my office.
because you invited me.
and then you asked me to change the report.
no.
you came to my office, and you asked me if I wanted to write a minority report.
I'm sorry. I...Our memories seem to diverge here.
you invited me into your office, and I was stunned
I asked you if this was covered by confidentiality.
you said,"No." Otherwise, I never would have mentioned it in my press conference.
what are you talking about?
you're lying!
no.
I'm not.
how can you pretend that isn't what happened?
one second, Ginger. I'll be right out.
you're gonna lose.
I am?
to whom?
Peter. - No.
you know why I won't?
because he isn't gonna enter the race.
he's too smart. He knows he's vulnerable.
Stop...lying about me.
don't pretend what I'm saying isn't the truth.
but still...
I found it here, a week later just leaning there against a tree.
chain broken.
who lives here?
some people who work in town.
and counselors?
a few.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was thinking of sending my daughter to the summer camp up the road.
do you think it's a good...?
my name is Kalinda, and I was thinking of working as a counselor...
I was just in the neighborhood, and working as an investigator for a reality TV show, looking into the slumber camp murder.
Really? I worked at the camp then.
Really?
Yeah, Rosa was a great girl. That was a tragedy, what happened.
Yeah. Must have been tough.
were you guys close?
Thanks. - No, just, um...
just the usual instructor-camper relationship.
you ran a photography program?
Yeah.
I also taught at the community college before everything went digital.
there was an art form to film.
now everybody just worries about computer bytes.
nobody cares about process any more.
I loved working at that camp, though.
those kids inspire me.
in-in what way?
their reverence for nature.
there's not a lot of reverence any more.
there she is.
there's Rosa.
nice girl.
I don't know. He hasn't decided yet.
well, which way is he leaning?
well, to be honest, Peter is leaning against running for governor.
Why?
he feels the Democratic Committee is yanking him around.
they promise him a speech at convention, then they back down.
it doesn't help that Kresteva has declared.
he's pretty popular, you know.
I spoke to him.
You...When?
today.
you spoke to him about lying. Didn't you?
you couldn't help yourself.
and he said, he wasn't lying, but you misremembered, right?
Yes.
Alicia, I am good at my job.
I know what people do.
so when I say, don't speak to them again, please believe me, I know what I speak of.
Peter should run.
I know.
he needs your help.
Kresteva is dangerous.
he's like Blagojevich dangerous.
stop selling, Eli. Quit while you're ahead.
okay.
I'm ahead?
you tell me what you need, and I will think about it.
no kids. - I know.
and there it is.
you didn't have to say that, Alicia.
I know.
I'm not sure if I'm running.
Yes.
that's what Eli said.
well, Kresteva's no worse than most.
I'm not sure I agree, but either way, this isn't about him.
it's about you wanting to see me elected?
Peter, we have had our issues, but I've always respected your political abilities.
and I've always thought you were better in office than the alternative.
you know, to be honest, Alicia, I'm finally enjoying what I'm doing here.
maybe that's why I'm thinking of not running.
okay...
if that's the reason.
your support means a lot to me.
run, Peter.
you'd be a good governor.
that's when I found out I was disbarred.
I've worked...I worked my life to become a lawyer.
it was everything to me.
this was fun.
there are usually more people.
Yup, that's all this needs.
you know, one of the dangers of not having the law to fall back on?
coming here with you?
distractions. Drugs, alcohol, gambling.
anonymous sex with strangers.
it's a good thing we're not strangers.
I could pretend to be a stranger.
my apartment is ten minutes from here.
I'll leave first.
if we left, he'd be alone.
my address.
mom, how are you?
good.
I love seeing you here.
seems so...appropriate.
don't buy the house, Mom. - she talked to you?
Yes, Alicia talked to me.
she doesn't understand. She thinks I'm doing this to hurt her.
I'm doing this for you and the kids.
I know, and thank you.
now, don't buy the house.
you know, she wants to buy it. She wants to live there without you.
mom, it's not your house.
I put a down payment on it.
I'll lose that.
no, you'll lose the earnest money at the most.
I can't afford losing that.
Yes, you can. You'll be fine.
Peter, I love you.
you have a good heart, but you don't know when people are manipulating you.
I do.
Alicia is manipulating you.
Alicia and I are trying very hard to act like adults.
I need you to butt out.
Peter, I-I can't believe it.
no, listen to me. Sit down. Listen to me.
do not buy that house.
do you understand me?
Peter, she's controlling you.
mother! Do you want me in your life? Yes or no?
Yes. - Then stop it.
stop it right now!
call the seller tomorrow, or I will.
do you understand me?
good.
thanks for coming in.
you think he was having a sexual relationship with her?
I checked his record.
two years after the murder, another camper accused him of sexual harassment.
so you're saying, Rosa took Mary Jane's bike and rode it to this counselor's house?
Yeah. Justin Varney, but no one ever knew, because the body was found in the woods back near her cabin.
the killer must have dumped it there.
why would he kill her?
accusations of criminal sexual abuse.
she was 16, he was 25.
so, call an emergency hearing, ask for a reconsideration on bail.
it's worth a shot.
okay. - I'll prepare the motion.
no. You take it head-on.
we had problems in our marriage, but we've worked hard to mend fences.
mend fences? - Do you have a better cliché?
just a second.
Frank. What's up?
you tell me.
you saw Mike Kresteva announce for governor.
I did.
is Peter running against him?
is the Democratic Committee supporting him?
you come out for Peter, he'll run.
is that your ex-wife?
Yes. Vanessa.
and she's running for state senate?
Yes.
and you're running her campaign?
consulting.
I can do both at the same time; Don't worry.
and what if you can't?
what's up, Frank?
we don't want her to run.
what about Robert Mulvey for state senator?
don't do this to me, please.
she jumped the line, Eli.
we don't want a woman in the race.
Mulvey wins the women's vote without her...
then let Mulvey compete.
no. That's not how this works.
he loses the women's vote, he loses.
you want us to help Peter, you drop out of your ex-wife's campaign.
this is crazy. - No, it's not.
I can't do that to her. - Yes, you can.
she can run in four years; help her then.
damn it!
don't go getting melodramatic on me, Eli.
you don't care about the state race.
Peter's the ball game.
just tell her you can't help with her campaign.
good to see you, Eli.
date of Death 8/5/07, 11: 44 PM
and what do we have today, Counselors?
we're here because, Your Honor, my client and her codefendants don't have the luxury of waiting for a trial.
Justin Varney has an alibi.
he was at a bar with some friends at the time of the murder.
the timeline could be off?
Yeah, but there's something else.
and that is Megan.
Megan gave Justin her friendship bracelet.
Justin didn't do it.
he was dating girls from the camp, but he wasn't at home the night of the murder.
Rosa went there to see him, and...
Megan was jealous.
Yeah, and Megan laid in wait for her.
is Cary anywhere near this?
not yet, but I wouldn't chance it.
and our client?
I don't know, I think the only one involved is Megan, but...
their fates are tied.
incoming Call: Jackie okay, go show it to Diane.
and thanks for the help with my mother-in-law.
Yes, Jackie. The money for the down payment, you borrowed it from Zach and Grace's trust, and that is...
what?
I had a stroke.
you...
come on, Jackie.
Alicia, I can't reach Peter.
please, you need to call him.
I'm in the hospital.
have you decided?
no private lives.
Mafia rules?
we can come after each other but not the families.
Nope.
Peter, sorry, my one play here is...
sorry, guys, can you grab the next one?
Thanks.
my one play here is to keep you out of the race.
and how do you keep an ambitious man from running?
tell him you'll go after his family with everything you got.
you're a real piece of work, aren't you?
I try to be.
well, I'm gonna come after you with everything I've got, everything I can find.
sure. Why not.
Peter, you enter the race, I can promise you one thing:
you may not regret it, but your wife will.
Oh, and...your phone's ringing.
what?
I forgive you.
is she all right?
I don't know.
mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
it's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry.
Really?
I thought I could handle two campaigns at once, but I just don't have the bandwidth to do either well.
so you chose him.
I chose the campaign I was managing, not consulting.
I'm sorry.
this is because we slept together, isn't it?
no.
I don't believe you.
look, Vanessa, it pains me to do this.
well, I'm so sorry for your pain!
look, I just... - What?
I just hope that we can still be friends, because...
this has been nice.
good-bye, Eli.
okay, run this by me again.
hypothetically... - Of course.
if I could convince you that one of the codefendants was actually guilty but the other two weren't...
that's a big if.
would you drop the charges against the other two?
Alicia, it's not my call to make.
I still have a job to protect here.
for the time being, at least.
but I thought you liked the...
what did you call it?
clarity.
well, let's just say it's getting murkier by the day.
I'm sorry, Alicia, honestly.
you don't seem happy here, Cary.
Really? Here in my cubicle?
got my Family Circus cartoons and my ficus.
what more could I want?
I'll talk to you. - Yeah.
Peter, it's time to do this.
it's time to decide.
Yeah, I know.
which way are you going?
let's do it.
good.
we'll win this.
I don't know about that, but...
it's been decided.
no.
Callie, all our clients are gonna sit in jail for another year, while the state's attorney's office devotes every resource they have to figuring out how to prove them guilty.
do you really think they're not gonna find this?
it's not about what I think, Diane...
my client has made up her mind.
then your client needs to be told the facts.
this evidence against Megan looks equally bad for all of us.
there's no way to prove that Lindsey and Pam didn't help Megan do this.
we'll take our chances.
no. You want the money from a lawsuit...
that's why you'll take your chances.
grow up.
don't play the martyr here.
you were just as much into the money as I was.
and what if...Lindsey testifies against your client?
what? - It's a new trial.
Cary needs new witnesses to replace the DNA evidence.
Lindsey would make a good witness.
she'd lie?
she wants out of prison; she's desperate.
you never know what a desperate person will say.
so I'm wrong to want money, but you are not wrong to blackmail?
that's right.
how's that door looking?
within reach.
you have any idea what you're gonna do?
no.
I used to like volleyball.
I wouldn't mind playing some volleyball.
this is where the nightmare always ended.
Oh, my baby! - It's over.
sweetheart!
we've had it for far too long in the state of Illinois.
it's the politics of divisiveness and discord, personal attacks instead of public achievement, negative campaigning instead of positive creation.
and that is why today I am throwing my cap into the race and announcing my candidacy for the governor of Illinois.
our next governor!
a word about breast cancer
Hi. My name is Therese Dodd and these are my breasts.
breast cancer is a serious matter.
early detection can save lives.
and so, as a public service,
I will now demonstrate a selfexam.
Hey. Hey. This is serious.
you do have a bra on under that, right?
no, Joey, what I have is a drive to help women.
Yeah, see, we're live, so it's probably best...
okay, there they are.
and did you hear the host say that?
say we were live? Yeah.
but I thought it was like a seven-second delay or something.
did you just smile at your lawyer because he coached you to say that? - Objection.
no, I smiled at my lawyer because he's cute.
you're being sued for $2 million, Ms. Dodd.
I would take this more seriously if I were you.
the first step to a selfexam is...Hey, hey.
stop looking over there. I am right here.
cover that up. We're...
the first thing you want to do with your - Okay!
is touch and massage them like so.
we have placed censor boxes over the offending areas, but on that day, your routine was sent out to eight million households.
but you didn't care, did you, Ms. Dodd?
well, I cared about women being informed about breast cancer.
Oh, Ms. Dodd, really? That's why you disrobed?
sure. My mom died of breast cancer last year. Why else?
because you happened to have a humorous book coming out in two months.
and you didn't care that you were using vulgar language in front of eight million viewers?
what do you mean,"vulgar"? Which word?
I think you know, ma'am.
no, I don't. Honestly, which one?
it rhymes with "bits."
it rhymes with "bits"? Are we eight years old?
you mean .
Bob, would you close that, please?
you enjoy using vulgar language to provoke, don't you, Ms. Dodd? - I do.
no further questions, Your Honor.
Therese, did you go on the show intending to take off your blouse? - No.
and did you feel that the show pushed you to do something outrageous?
Oh, yeah, they always have me on to push the envelope.
and you were told that the talk show would be delayed due to a football overrun? - Yes.
and therefore, you thought that the show would be broadcast during the safe harbor period? - Uh... what?
safe harbor. It's the time after 10: 00 p.m.and before 6: 00 a.m.
when network programs can, according to FCC rules, show nudity and use languagelike .
Bob, how are we getting on with that window?
Yes, Counselor,
I thought the show was going on at 10: 00 p.m.
and therefore, the words you used, and the skin you exposed, was problematic only due to the network'sselfimposed censorship?
your Honor, it doesn't matter. The show was taped in Chicago, but broadcast live on the West Coast at 8: 00 p. m.
Yes, but that wasn't Therese's decision.
that was the network's.
she thought the show was safely in the safe harbor.
ms. Dodd signed a contract with the network, not with the FCC.
let me get this straight.
the FCC says I can strip down nakedand talk dirty like a cable show, but the network says I can't?
ms. Dodd, please let your attorney ask the questions.
I'm just surprised, aren't you?
the network can show the same stuff as cable, but they choose not to?
your Honor, this lawsuit is a sham.
Mr. Preston and his client, the network, know they can't get $2 million from my client.
they are suing her for the same reason their Standards and Practices are stricter than the FCC.
for their advertisers.
Mr. Gardner makes a sound point, Mr. Preston.
ms. Dodd shouldn't be liable for the network's choices.
there's only one question remaining for me and that's premeditation.
unless you have evidence to prove Ms. Dodd went on the show intending to perform indecent material for instance, an earlier and identical standup routine then I am prone to dismiss.
I don't understand breasts.
they're made of fat; they sag; they drool;
and guys still go for them.
I've decided to name mine. This one's Margie.
Margie's the misunderstood one...
anything yet?
no. Another breast routine. But different material.
do you think she's funny?
sometimes. You?
it seems like an easy laugh... breasts.
well, guys make penis jokes.
Yeah. Yeah, those are easy, too.
you've, um, been spending a lot of time with Clarke. - Yeah.
everything okay? - Yeah.
he just... he just likes to talk.
Laura? - Oh, hello, Alicia. How are you?
good. You're out of uniform, Captain.
permanently, Unfortunately. - What? Why?
my choice. I was losing my bearings, things soured.
I'm on the market now. Whee...
you're... looking for a job?
Yeah. No, not here.
I'm out there checking out the job market.
this is my interview outfit.
so you're here...?
Oh, my bill. I haven't paid it yet.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
what? Why? - We lost.
but we did our best. Don't worry.
so can you show me to Clarke Hayden?
um, that door. And, Laura, if you need anything I started over pretty late.
so, if you want to talk.
I'll call you.
Hello? - Hello.
what do you think of Brazilian food?
what do I... What?
Yes, Gus, we take Maddie Haywardvery seriously as a contender.
but our eye is still on the Republican, Kresteva.
one question. Maddie's worth $180 million that's a lot of ad buys.
you're telling me you're not worried?
I'm telling you, these millionaires always burn themselves out after a while because money only gets you so far.
now does anyone have a question about, you know, the issues?
wait, Eli, Eli.
what about Peter sleeping with a campaign worker?
is that you, Mitch? This is crap and you know it.
synth printed it, Eli.
a disgraced reporter printed it.
Peter Florrick has categorically denied these charges, and the accuser has been proved a liar.
now, are there any real questions?
sure. One.
okay. Who's this?
Wexler Turner from NSW News.
uh... okay, go for it.
can you respond to reports that this campaign worker has identified a distinguishing mark on Peter Florrick's anatomy?
you're kidding.
no, sir. She says he has a birthmark on his penis, shaped like Brazil.
can you confirm or deny that Florrick has such a birthmark?
this is...
how dare you, sir?
at long last, "how dare you"?
this is an outrage.
okay, that's the Morning Call for today.
get the candidate on the phone. Where is he?
and someone call Alicia.
Rebecca Stokes. I'm a makeup artist with ten years' experience.
and did you do the makeup for the defendant on the night in question?
Yes. Hi, Therese.
and when you do the makeup for guests...Strike that.
was there anything unusual you did with Ms. Dodd's makeup?
Yeah. Uh, no.
I mean, just, um, foundation and blush.
what do you mean?
was there anything unusual regarding the placement?
the placement? I,uh...
you usually only do makeup on the face?
Oh, yeah, and sometimes the arms.
and what did Ms. Dodd ask you to do?
Oh, I see. She wanted makeup on her chest.
and by her chest, you don't mean just the cleavage?
I do.
no, uh, but you mean more than that?
Oh, yeah. She wanted both her breasts done.
I thought it was unusual because, you know, the camera is only gonna see the cleavage, but then it made sense after I saw.
okay. What do you want?
$2 million. - Mr. Preston, our client can't pay a tenth of that.
she can when her book comes out.
and how will that look for your network, bankrupting a comedian whose mother died of breast cancer?
it'll look like we take decency on our airwaves seriously.
then have our client apologize. Have her do a PSA for you.
no. Thank you though.
Yes, Mr. Hayden.
nothing. Just clearing my throat.
then we have nothing to negotiate. We'll see you in court.
parents Against Indecency have bombarded the FCC with letters and complaints regarding Ms. Dodd's little stunt.
and our expectation is the FCC will fine us the maximum:
don't anwser reporters' questions till we talk.
$3 million. - Mr. Preston, we've already made clear our client can't...
over the next two days, I'm meeting individually with three of the FCC commissioners to lobby them.
the three swing votes.
there is one thing your client can do to quash our suit. Apologize.
tell them the saintly story of her mom dying of cancer, and her sense of overexuberance at wanting to do something about it.
you'll quash the suit if she does?
no, I'll quash the suit if she's successful.
she needs to convince two of the three swing votes for the FCC to drop their fine.
she does that, she doesn't pay a cent.
we have no choice.
I know. That's not the concern. The concern is her.
she won't go?
no, she will. She just...
she needs a babysitter.
Alicia, you go with her to D.C. Make sure she stays in line.
uh, Cary will go with you.
I don't think we need two. - I can stay.
do you mind giving us a minute? - Sure.
you don't think Alicia can do it?
no, I think we need to use Cary more.
he's taking a backseat on too many cases.
he complained?
no, he didn't have to. I noticed.
you think I'm holding him back?
I think you're the head of litigation, and we need to use Cary more. That's all.
what's going on there?
nice to meet you, Mr. Hayden.
and you. Lockhart/Gardner is a good firm.
it has the feel of a familyrun business, but the client base of a Portman & Michaels.
I don't think I...
you know we're on opposite sides of this suit?
I also know you're looking to expand from L A. to the Midwest.
we're looking to build, not purchase.
Yes, but isn't it easier to remodel an existing home than to build a new one?
not if the foundation is compromised.
well, why don't you test the foundation to see if it's compromised?
does the firm want to be acquired?
it's not up to the firm. It's up to the courts.
then I'll consider it.
you want to know what?
we don't want to know anything.
I do.
how is it even possible to have a birthmark shaped like Brazil?
so, you don't?
no, Jim. I don't. Would you like to check?
okay, here's the problem.
we buried the affair story, but this is different.
this is late-night fodder.
it's also the perfect political trap.
we can't have the candidate say that he doesn't have a Brazil shaped birthmark on his penis.
we can't have surrogates say it because how did they see?
we could have the wife.
no. No.
then we change the subject.
boy. You ever wonder about this country?
all the time.
well, here's the real worry.
if this is the perfect political trap,
I don't think Indira Starr was smart enough to think it up.
Kresteva? - Sounds like him.
I think our Republican opponent is up to his old tricks.
I'm on it.
what do you have?
to change the subject? A rumor.
Maddie Hayward, your primary opponent she's sleeping with her aide.
Mmm, not big enough. She's single.
the aide is a girl.
okay. Our fingerprints cannot be on this.
and get some photos if you can.
so, I have to tell three FCC commissioners about my mom dying of cancer?
I believe in you.
do you like Coldplay?
do I like them? Enough.
I hate them. - Okay.
when I get to the part about my mom's hair falling out,
I want you to hum "Fix You."
she only needs two of the three swing votes. Can she do it?
she's motivated.
good.
it must be difficult, this bankruptcy.
not really.
but you've lost 40% of your attorneys?
we still have our major clients.
even family law? They have their major clients?
Yes. Why?
rank, unfettered curiosity.
you don't have to tell me. I'm on your side.
Wow. That was easy.
they made me think I had to take you in the next room and give you a...
so, we can depend on your vote, sir?
certainly.
but I've always thought you network folk were too terrified of us at the FCC anyway.
we're not the ones infantilizing entertainment.
that's what I told him.
so hypocritical.
you allow yourselves to show naked bodies just as long as they're bruised and covered in blood.
Yeah. Why is that, Burl?
we're not talking about... - Tell us.
okay. Thank you so much, Commissioner Gill.
I haven't talked about my mom dying yet.
that's okay, Therese.
okay. Thank you.
nice paperweight. First effort in metal shop or something?
that's from 9/11.
Oh. Damn those terrorists and their paperweights.
I know, I know. Comedy killer.
do you think we'll be all right?
he's on board, but we can't be going off script like that.
sir.
I didn't know you were in town.
work. The FCC.
but you're still with, um...?
Lockhart/Gardner, yeah.
uh, excuse me. This is my colleague, Alicia Florrick. My father, Jeffrey Agos.
Really?
what a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Agos.
and you.
how's Mom? - Good.
last I heard. - Martha?
uh, overseas in China. Back in a month.
and how's, uh, that girl of yours?
that girl? Which one?
the last one. The pretty one.
you mean from law school? - Yes.
I haven't seen her in five years, Dad.
it was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Agos.
Cary is quite the lawyer.
so, who are you here to see?
commissioner Bix today. Martinez tomorrow.
Ah. You want me to put in a good word for you?
had lunch with them both.
no, we're fine.
how long you been doing this?
watching Maddie's house?
no. This. The business.
a while.
me, too.
that her?
the aide? No.
who is it?
she's meeting with Maddie Hayward?
that explains who's behind the birthmark rumor.
first of all, no 9/11 jokes. Are we agreed?
Oh, no.
I thought the commissioner was just meeting with us.
what?
punch Sutton. The chair of Parents Against Indecency.
hello. Oh, hi, Laura. How are you?
good. Really good, I think.
I just... I need your help.
do you know Eddie Kolakowski at Armstrong, Hayes & LeGarde?
uh, yes. I mean, by name.
do you think you could call him and say nice things about me?
certainly. So, the interview went well?
I hate saying that and jinxing things, but they said it's between me and one other person.
that's fantastic. In this economy?
well, I will call. And congratulations.
don't say that yet. Take it back.
we have over 3, 000 complaints, Commissioner, all regarding this full frontal nudity. - Yes.
but all those complaints were organizedby Parents Against Indecency itself.
we have children, just like you.
we're worried about the vulgarization of our culture.
this isn't about one swear word or a glimpse of a breast.
this is about the floodgates...
but the floodgates are open, sir.
the screens have multiplied with iPads, iPods, the Internet...
then you should be happy.
there are many avenues for this type of content.
but why is it wrong to insist on one place where parents don't always have to be on the defensive?
don't.
but you allowed exactly this kind of nudity and profanity on network TV, Commissioner. - I did not.
Schindler's List had full frontal nudity and was shown, without FCC objection, at 9: 00 p. m.
do you really want to suggest Ms. Dodd's little striptease had the same merit as Schindler's List?
if you were a woman with breast cancer, it did.
it is our argument that the Spielberg exception is unfair restraint.
you can't make an allowance for one filmmaker and not another.
they don't make it for a filmmaker;They make it for a filmmaker's work.
ms. Dodd, what are your thoughts?
Oh. Well...I don't think I'm any less decent than Spielberg.
I mean, have you seen him eat?
maybe it would help if you explain to Commissioner Bixyour reasons for your breast exam.
Yeah. Well, uh, my mom died. She was funny.
and, uh, she got breast cancer.
I remember the day she died.
uh, I think she had gas or something because she just let out the most massive passing of gas. And, uh, she kept cracking jokes about it.
uh, and I just thought, wow. You know, I couldn't believe it.
so close to death and still making jokes.
I just can't do it.
I know what you want me holding her hand and staring into her deep, sad eyes but... anything else.
I'll kitsch up anything you want, but just not this.
then get ready to pay $2 million.
no. Gill is still with us, so I think we're tied.
we're not sure about Bix. It all comes down to tomorrow Commissioner Martinez.
okay, good. Keep us in touch.
Oh, and one other thing. This might not be anything, but...
Burl's been asking about our firm.
he... what do you mean?
he asked about Chapter 11, how it's going.
what did you say?
I said we were doing well. That we had our major clients.
was that the wrong thing to say?
I don't know. Was there anything else?
he asked about family law, how it was doing.
uh, one second, Alicia.
he's after us.
that's what the meeting with Clarke was yesterday.
Alicia, if you get a chance, tell him we lost our top client, Edelstein.
you want me to emphasize we're not doing well?
Yes, please. Um, we'll call again.
our trustee is looking for a buyer.
Preston is mostly about divorce.
that's why family law.
what do we do?
we could fight in court. - The judge will side with Clarke.
we need $60 million to get out from under him.
we're at $12 million.
no, she was great. Just out of the military, right?
right. I just wanted to offer a reference, tell you how great she is.
Yeah, she seemed great.
so, are you looking for litigators with trial experience?
well, actually, between us, we're not looking for anyone.
you're not? She seemed to think there was a job there.
well, we like to keep our hand in.
meet and interview, see who's out there. Same as you guys.
so, are you going to tell her there's no job?
what do you mean?
well, she thinks it's between her and someone else.
Oh. Could you hold for a moment, please?
hello. - Hello. Is Cary there?
Cary...? Oh. No. Mr. Agos?
uh, this is Alicia Florrick. I'm in 206. He's next door in 207.
Ah. Well, my apologies. Thank you.
Mr. Kolakowski? I'm...Hello? Hello...
no, I just...I hadn't seen him in years. He's...
we're not very close.
he's a lobbyist?
Yeah. Yeah, so is my mom. My new mom.
you should have breakfast with him.
Why?
because he asked you.
I said we were busy. Maybe another time.
Cary, we're not busy.
he's... probably trying to make amends.
call him back.
Why?
because you only get so much family in life.
this seems to matter more to me than it does to you.
wait, no...more to you...
no, I just...It was nice to see you with family.
my dad kicked me out the door when I was 18.
cause his dad kicked him out the door when he was 18.
he never gave me a cent.
never wanted to know what I was doing.
when I got the deputyship at the state's attorney's office, he never said a thing.
that's probably why he's calling now.
to try to make up for it. People change on you.
you changed on me.
me? No.
Oh, you don't notice it?
you're tougher now.
you're smarter about things.
is that good or bad?
probably neither... just necessary.
and you. You're nothing like four years ago.
I thought you were a jerk.
damn it. I forgot.
I think she's on Bill Maher tonight.
who? - Therese.
you two seemed to be hitting it off. All that...
breast humor, I guess.
well, that sounds like pure pleasure.
Yep. Going from office to office, arguing with the FCC.
I personally stripped for each and every one of them.
and how did that go over?
well, Commissioner Gill took pictures, but he said it was for educational purposes.
no. No, don't.
and Commissioner Bix...Oh, I don't know.
she slipped me her number, but, you know, that can mean anything.
and did you settle anything?
Yes, we did. No more censorship. Anywhere. Ever.
these breasts can do anything when they set their minds to it.
so...I read about your old boss.
Florrick. He's got a tricky race going on up there.
you like him?
I do. He's a good guy.
not easy being a good guy in that town.
your mother sent me something you wrote.
About...plea bargains.
negotiation techniques. With a human face.
right. It was smart. I didn't understand all of it, but what I understood was...smart.
thank you.
Cary. How are you doing?
I'm good. You?
I'm good, I guess.
I don't know how long any of us have, but I'm good.
what do you mean?
nothing. I just...
I want to say something before it's too late.
I'm proud of you. And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that...we haven't been in touch.
what do you mean,"too late"?
nothing. I'm just talking. I...
I think that we should...talk at some point.
dad, what is going on?
I'm so sorry to interrupt, Cary. Mr. Agos.
what's wrong?
uh, we have a problem. Commissioner Martinez canceled.
he canceled? Till when?
no time.
damn it.
will and Diane would like us to come back.
it's the Bill Maher thing.
that's what we're thinking.
so sorry, Mr. Agos.
well, you should, uh, go and...we'll talk soon.
dad, call me.
don't worry. I will.
so Maddie Hayward is not the campaign innocent she pretends to be.
we spoke to the neighborhood watch, and they said they've seen Indira Starr's car there for the last month.
before she went to Synth magazine?
so Maddie's been playing us?
that would make sense.
okay. Things have just gotten ugly.
Jim, get me everything you can on Maddie. Kalinda...
no, thanks. - Wait, where you going?
I have a job, Eli. Look, you knew this was temporary.
what are you doing? This is for Alicia as much as for Peter.
nice try, but no.
yes?
you're selling us to Preston.
I'm...considering your options.
your options. We don't have any options.
you had six years of options.
so you're punishing us?
I'm trying to keep you from liquidation.
by destroying us? By selling us off in pieces?
no. By doing what I do:
by looking where the money is and where it isn't.
this is not a subtle business, Ms. Lockhart.
there is either money in the wallet or there isn't.
and when there isn't, wishing there is won't make it so.
how was D. C? - Good. Actually...
it wasn't good.
Oh, sorry.
it's okay. It's just work.
how was interviewing?
fine. Hey, thanks for calling Armstrong & Hayes.
how did that go?
I don't think there's a job there.
what did they say?
there's no job there.
but they said there was.
Yes, they lied.
why would they do that?
because you're pretty, and they didn't want to say no to you.
okay.
people aren't mean... they're just polite liars.
you went back on the job market after how many years away?
13, but I'm not a fair comparison.
the job market's a lot harder now.
how many interviews did you have before you got this?
five. But I knew someone. Here.
do you know anyone, Laura? Anyone who could help you? Any connections?
probably? I don't know, but...
it's just the way it is. People...hire people they know.
it's not wrong. It just is.
so you need my help? - We do.
it's in your interest, David.
you hate Burl Preston as much as we do.
he's not so bad.
David. Burl Preston is trying to buy this firm in order to control you.
do you want to be controlled?
no. But I don't want to be controlled by you either.
and if we promised you wouldn't be?
well, I'd be open to discussing.
as long as my capital contribution was part of it.
Cary? Hi.
I thought you were heading back.
uh... I was. I am. I'm in Chicago. Dad...
what were you trying to say at breakfast? Dad.
whatever it is, I can handle it.
look, it's very hard to talk about it, son.
your mother thinks that I should wait.
dad, I am here. And I'm listening.
all right. Do you know...Senator Byers of Illinois?
Yeah.
I have a chance to work as her press secretary, but I need someone to put in a good word with her.
now, I know that her best friend is Diane Lockhart at your firm, and I was hoping that you might ask her to put in that good word.
that's what you wanted to talk about?
Yes.
and that's it?
Yes, but... it's a lot, son. I know.
and it would be very helpful because...
senator Byers depends a lot on personal recommendations.
and I could talk to Martinez for you, if...that would be helpful.
dad, I got to go. They need me.
so, you'll... do it? You'll... ask Diane Lockhart?
I don't know. Let me... let me think about it.
son, it would be very helpful.
well, I said I'd think about it.
come again?
they are saying that I have a mark on my penis shaped like Brazil.
I...
Yeah.
what does he want me to say?
well, that's a difficult one.
no" would be the obvious answer.
right. But...maybe mixed with some outrage.
Yeah, I don't do outrage well these days.
how about laughter?
well... that would be easier.
good. Thank you.
that's okay.
did you fill Cary's position at the state's attorney's office?
no, not yet. Why?
are you going to?
well, someday when I have time.
there's someone...I think you should consider.
an ex-military lawyer.
a captain. You'd like her.
Really?
Yeah. Do you mind considering her?
I don't.
do you mind talking to the press?
Nope.
good. It's a deal. Thanks.
you, too. Bye.
well, you two are cheerful.
we've been frozen out.
the last FCC commissioner doesn't want to hear us.
it's worse. I made a few calls, and Commissioner Martinez is still meeting with Parents Against Indecency.
great.
he doesn't want to meet with you guys, but he's still meeting the opposition tomorrow at 6: 00.
one thing we could try...
yes?
we go.
go where?
Martinez at 6: 00.
we were disinvited.
we never got the message.
we know he wanted to hear from both Parents Against Indecency and us, and we never got the disinvite.
you crash it.
no, this is the new me.
smell my perfume; It's called Accommodation.
Oh, it's nice.
Thanks.
I'll catch up with you.
so you're not going to call?
you're going to ignore your own father? - Yep.
I only need one call to Diane Lockhart.
and I only needed one call on my birthday, one call when I was out of work.
did you know I was the youngest deputy state's attorney ever?
did you know that? - We don't do that, Cary.
other families gush.
you know how I pay a compliment to you now?
by needing something from you.
dad. No... no.
a few years ago I'd jump at the chance to impress you, but it's over.
I won't be calling you again.
my loss.
I'm so sorry, I didn't get the message. Cary?
my gosh, no, I didn't either.
y-you were canceling?
Yes, just a scheduling logjam.
well, now that we're all here...
it seems only fair.
all I wanted to do was to make women aware of breast cancer.
and disrobing was making them aware?
would I do it that way again? No, but women needed to see something memorable, something to provoke them.
I'm impressed, Ms. Dodd.
thank you, Commissioner.
what I have trouble reconciling is this new Therese with the Therese that told this joke:
rape is never funny.
unless you're raped by a clown.
how is this funny, Ms. Dodd?
sir, that wasn't part of the original act.
I understand that, but I find myself confused by Ms. Dodd's sense of humor.
do you know that every 45 seconds, there is another sexual assault in America?
so I'm not sure how rape is funny.
the joke isn't about rape, sir.
it's about a ridiculous juxtaposition.
but it makes light of rape, doesn't it?
shall I read it again?
I think, sir, you're trying to make a point by putting Ms. Dodd on the spot.
sir, we didn't come... - You're right.
it's not funny, Commissioner.
Therese. - What? He's right.
rape is never funny, and the association of clowns and rape is just offensive, and I feel terrible that I wrote it.
thank you, ma'am, but then I find myself asking, why do you tell these jokes?
because I have a potty mouth.
are you making fun of me, Ms. Dodd?
no. Never...
because that's why we have standards to protect the viewers from indecency like this.
well, if the question is about protecting viewers, they voted with their remotes.
there are more viewers watching the show than ever.
okay, so I must ask you, Ms. Dodd, will you sign a pledge that you will never do anything like this on TV again?
ms. Dodd?
I think that's a yes.
I was in the JAG Corps for 12 year sand before that, I attended SLS.
S-Stanford Law.
Oh, I thought that was military jargon.
no.
I grew up in California, Huntington Beach.
was your dad in the military?
no, a professor of neurobiology at Irvine.
brothers?
no, two sisters, though.
why did you enlist, then?
I don't know. They needed lawyers.
well, we're not really short-staffed at the moment, but we're always looking, so we'll keep this resume on file.
have you tried the public defenders' office? They're always in need of...
Mr. Florrick, hello.
Hi, Geneva.
and you must be Captain Hellinger.
Oh, yes, sir.
wonderful to meet you.
you're looking for a job, huh?
I am, sir.
and you know how little we pay?
I've heard rumors.
you could live on that?
I tend to be frugal.
well, that's good. When can you begin?
now, I mean, if you want.
that's great.
here's your first case: Breaking and entering.
geneva will set you up with a cubicle. Welcome aboard.
thank you so much.
um, thank you for your help.
your Honor, there is still the question of damages.
no, there is the question of whether your negotiations have borne fruit.
we made an effort to reach such a settlement, Your Honor, but the results depend on something yet to be decided.
Mr. Prestonis being coy.
we agreed to argue in front of the FCC on the network's behalf, and if the FCC decided favorably, this lawsuit would go away.
I see. And the FCC hasn't decided?
not yet, but we believe this suit should be dismissed on the basis of an absence of damages.
damages have already been established, Your Honor, the many affiliates dropping our show.
Yes, but Mr. Preston recently argued in front of the FCC that there has been a corresponding rise in viewership a rise large enough to more than offset the affiliate loss.
that was an argument in another venue.
your Honor, this suit is an attempt to punish Therese, that's all.
there are no actual damages here, and this suit should be dismissed.
would you care for some water?
no.
my firm will absorbthe debt of Lockhart/Gardner and pay out existing capital contributions of existing equity partners, but all severance packages will be the responsibility of the existing partners.
Yes, and you agree to honor the contracts of existing partners.
only up to a year of the purchase date.
that's fine.
the, the current lease will be subject to...
Hello, Burl.
David... what can we do for you?
Oh, I'm just watching. Continue.
Mr. Lee, this is a private matter.
it's far from private.
I'm just waiting for my emancipation. Go ahead.
your emancipation?
Yes. This firm has a strangle hold on me, but as soon as you purchase it, I'm free. Hallelujah.
you're not free. You're committed to Lockhart/Gardner.
no, the partners just rewrote my contract.
if this firm is soldor absorbed, I am free to leave.
they can't do that.
Yes, they can.
you can veto their hiring decisions.
you can't veto a nonfinancial side agreement in a partnership contract.
the firm is still in fine shape.
no, thank you. Good luck with this place.
unfortunately they enjoy intrigue more than they do making money.
you told your husband to hire me?
no.
he hired me.
Congratulations.
you didn't say anything to him?
well, I said you were a good lawyer.
okay. This is all new to me.
what, friends didn't help friends in the military?
they did, but never me.
well, baptism by fire.
yes?
do you know how hard it is to find a suitor like that?!
Yes, that's why we did it.
you're losing this firm.
is that a threat?
take it any way you want, but you are losing this firm.
Mr. Hayden, you should take a step back.
you've obviously become too invested in our firm.
you don't know me. I don't step back.
we don't either.
then get ready to crash.
so, I just heard the FCC isn't going to fine the network.
Yeah, yeah, you're off the hook.
good.
I have to head out to L.A. So I wanted to say thank you.
have a good trip.
I will.
I'm not great with byes, so bye.
What'd she say?
good-bye.
that's it?
Yeah.
she didn't say anything else?
no, why?
well, why did she kiss you yesterday?
she's a comedian.
I've spent the last week with my lawyer, trying desperately not to say anything about Brazil and penises.
I suppose there are worse birthmarks to have.
like Greece. I mean, who wants a penis that's always in recession?
my lawyer says, it really only looks like Brazil when it's erect.
otherwise it's more like New Jersey.
grace, R U OK?
Yeah. Y?
someone says ur dead.
God I thought it was you, I heard Grace ...
God, do you know her?
no, I mean a little. What happened?
was she ...sleeping pills?
no, she ...
Why? - I think her boyfriendbroke up with her or something.
they said she was in her underwear.
Hannah just tweeted it was aspirin, not painkillers.
did you guys see Connor just checked in on Foursquare, like, an hour ago? At the library.
what are you doing at the library the day after your girlfriend kills herself?
ex-girlfriend. They broke up last week.
did you see he changed his status to "single"?
I know. She tweeted a picture of herself last weekafter she dyed her hair red - YOLO.
Yeah,"you only live once."
she sat two rows behind me in algebra last year. - I know it's kind of morbid, but I can't stop looking at her Facebook page.
and who is this?
Mr. Van Zanten.
and you shot him four times in the head?
Yes.
why would you do that, Mr. Yates?
because she wanted me to.
you're referring to the accused, Gwyneth Van Zanten? - Yes.
you were her Pilates instructor?
Yes, but she said she loved me. If I shot her husband...
we would be together.
with his money? - Objection. Leading.
sustained.
and you...strike that.
why did M-Mrs. Van Zanten want you to shoot her husband?
objection. Ambiguous.
unfortunately, sustained.
o - One second.
Oh, did the accused offer youanything in exchange for this murder?
Yes, she said we'd split his money.
and did Mrs. Van Zanten explain why she wanted her husband killed?
he's a rich CEO. They had a prenup.
if she divorced him, she got nothing.
but if he died, she got everything.
I see. And what happened after the murder?
objection. Calls for narrative.
ms. Hellinger, you are now experiencing ASA Hazing 101. Sustained.
thank you, Your Honor.
did you text the accused after the murder? - I did.
and what did your text say?
it's done. Our problems are over.
don't go home until 8: 00.
why not go home until 8: 00?
to establish her alibi.
Hello, this is the principal at Capstone Preparatory.
over the weekend, there was a tragic incident involving a Capstone student.
please take a moment to discuss this...
a bit more rough and tumble than military court.
you'll be fine. Just don't retreat.
you're either advancing or retreating.
Hi, Mom. - My daughter.
no, thanks.
grace. Uh, hi. What's going on?
I just got a call from school.
Oh, yeah. Grace Baskin OD'd on pills.
Oh, my God. When?
last night. We're all wearing yellow today.
it was her favorite color.
what happened?
Hey, Mom, I have to get to class. Can I call you back?
are you all right?
Yeah, I mean, it's sad, but I'm good.
I'll call you back, okay?
it's his fault.
I didn't even think he'd show up at school.
and, look, he didn't wear yellow. I heard he told her to get an abortion.
no, he didn't. She wasn't even pregnant.
Yeah, who told you she got an abortion?
I don't know. Someone re-tweeted it.
is that even his car?
I thought he was a scholarship kid.
he is. I've seen him on the bus.
do you think he blames himself?
wouldn't you? He breaks up with her, then four days later, she kills herself.
I know. Can you imagine?
my client has stated that she was faithful to her late husband and that they were happily married.
yet you claim she was having an affair with you? - Yes.
do you have any proof of this? Any love letters? Any...mementos of this...torrid affair?
no. - I see. So we're to take your word for it?
and this text you sent her- that it was "done"
what did she write back?
she didn't. We talked in person.
Ah. So...you admitted killing her husband, you admitted sending her a text admitting your guilt, and my client hasn't admitted a thing?
objection, Your Honor, counsel is testifying.
Yes, he is that. Sustained.
after you sent this text, my client immediately informed the police, didn't she?
objection, Your Honor. Counsel is stil ltestifying.
not only that, he's asking for hearsay.
it goes to the defendant's state of mind, Your Honor.
actually, no. Mr. Gardner is asking for the content of a conversation between Mrs. Van Zanten and a police detective.
if that's what he wants, he should put one of them on the stand.
Oh, she's got you there, Mr. Gardner. Congratulations, Ms. Hellinger.
what were you offered in trade your testimony here, Mr. Yates?
well, I wouldn't say it was a trade.
I received a plea bargain. - And what was the plea bargain?
20 years.- For cold-blooded murder?
objection, Your Honor. Argumentative.
Yes. Sustained.
and what is the usual sentence for first-degree murder?
objection, Your Honor. Calls for speculation.
Yes. Sustained.
a murder like this usually draws a 45-year sentence...
objection. Counsel is testifying.
sustained again.
are you having trouble getting out what you want, Mr. Gardner?
nicely played.
thank you.
we used to represent you.
Yep. Thank you.
go well in court?
everybody feels bad for the under dog.
what about the person who's supposed to do well?
no one talks about the pressure we're under.
so, what's up with you?
you've been away from work. - No.
mentally, you have. What's going on?
Oh, just, uh, personal stuff. Uninteresting.
huh. Judge Creary.
what are you doing?
going to the restroom.
look, Creary plays by the book.
then he doesn't have to talk.
Kalinda, this single case could drag us out of bankruptcy.
I want to get a sense of where we stand.
Oh, Will Gardner! How the hell are you?
judge Creary. No, uh, no, I'll call you right back.
will, hello.
Giada, I... I didn't know you were in town.
Yeah, Orren & Polk, second year. His Honor was just offering me some career advice.
do you know this bastard?
I do. We met when I was at DePaul, although we haven't spoken in a while.
what happened there?
I don't know, I thought it was you. - Oh, no, it wasn't me.
Yeah, well, I'd stay away from him. He's a bad influence.
Oh, I knew that. Will is a bad boy.
disbarred bad boy.
Six-months- suspended bad boy.
you should've seen him in court today.
he was completely screwed up.
Really? I... thought we more than held our own.
Mm-mm. No, you're gone, you're-you're cooked, you're... deep-fried cooked.
why is that? - Your client- she's guilty.
how do you figure, Your Honor?
actus reus. You're trying to make her out to be a saint.
she was cheating on her husband.
no, I'm sorry, Your Honor, that's just not true.
I can't for the life of me figure why you wanted a bench trial.
except you'd probably do worse with a jury.
his client is an ice queen. Looks something like this.
I mean it.
your Honor, if you believe that, you need to recuse yourself.
I love this one! With his ethics! Love the ethics, Will.
great for a disbarred lawyer.
Mm. Bribing judges and stealing.
you know, if it was up to me, you wouldn't be allowed to practice law ever again.
maybe the thing is to agree to disagree.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, young lady... for bringing my work here. Yep.
he didn't say that?
he said I bribed judges and stole, our client is guilty, and I should never practice law again.
well, he was drinking.
which means he's only being more loose-lipped about with what he really thinks.
damn it.
gwyn brings her husband's fortune to us, it gets us out of debt.
I know, and it's a good case. In front of another judge, we'd win.
what are you thinking, the same thing?
move for a recusal?
he says no, you've turned the judge against you.
he's against me already.
there will be fallout from the judicial community.
Creary is beloved.
he was beloved. Judges know he's a loose cannon.
we win this case, we get out from under the trustee.
we could get the 27th floor back.
have Cary argue the motion for you.
no, Alicia. It's not that.
I think Creary's got a thing for the ladies.
Oh. Well, don't embarrass him.
ask for the conference in chambers.
have Alicia move for the recusal there.
and if he says no?
this should be interesting.
probably too late to take my advice back.
probably.
your Honor, the defense requestsan issues conference in chambers.
what do you need, Counselor?
we have a motion, Your Honor. But it would be easier to present it in chambers.
Oh? And why is that? Mr Gardner?
it's a personal matter, Your Honor.
Oh, really, a personal matter? What kind of personal matter?
please, Your Honor.
well, in chambers it'll be on the record, Mr. Gardner, and-and...?
Ah, the state's attorney's wife. Very fortuitous.
in there and in here, it'll be on the record, so if you have a motion, let's hear it.
your Honor, we move that you recuse yourself.
Oh, really? Now, why should I recuse myself?
you have demonstrated bias against the defense.
still licking your woundsabout those objections yesterday, Mr. Gardner?
no, Your Honor, this is regarding the biased comments you made to Mr. Gardner in the bar, The Arena, last night.
this is dangerous territory, Mrs. Florrick.
you called our client guilty, and you said that Mr. Gardner was a known liar, and that he should give up now because he would lose.
well, your motion is denied.
you have any further witnesses?
your Honor, you showed bias against us.
I have ruled on your motion, Mrs. Florrick.
you may sit down now unless you have anotherwitness.
you've given us no alternative, Your Honor, but to file a motion to substitute Your Honor for cause.
you what?!
we are filing for a substitution hearing.
now, you sit down right now, Mrs. Florrick. I have ruled!
and it is not up to you...
no, sir, it is not up to you.
you have no further witnesses, then we will move toward...
excuse me, Your Honor. It is our right.
no, it is not your right to disrupt my court.
you're in contempt.
if I make a motion to substitute, Your Honor, then it is no longer in your hands, and you must transfer this matter to another judge.
you don't know what you've just done.
we do, Your Honor, but you've given us no other choice.
everybody has a choice. Everybody.
you're fishing for a mistrial here, and you won't get it.
you lose this motion, and I'll be right back here to judge this case.
we understand that.
so I'll give you one last chance to step back over that line.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but my motion has been made.
we move for a hearing into your bias against Mr. Gardner and our client.
well, we're in it now.
we've been ten percent more successful in optimizing campaign page keywords, and that's resulted in a 20% increase in organic search traffic.
we've been employing the BLUF tactic of networking design.
that's Bottom Line Up Front.
I would say this met with mixed results.
wait. There's been a 20% jump in fund-raising? How did that happen?
uh, I.T.'s been better managed.
by who? - One of the volunteers.
hire him. - Her.
do I care?
you're hired. - What?
just keep doing what you're doing.
good job, you guys, I'll need you to stay a little later.
you got it. - No problem.
where are you going, Jay?
uh, I have to get back home.
okay. - Tomorrow.
if I can.
all stand. Court is now in session. The Honorable Peter Dunaway presiding.
Uh-oh. - What?
it's Judge Dunaway.
this is a hearing to determine whether Judge Harrison Creary is prejudiced against the defendant and defense counsel in People V. Gwyneth Van Zanten...
...
asa Hellinger, do you support Mr. Gardner's motion to substitute?
no, Your Honor. The People do not believeJudge Creary has shown bias in this case.
then you will present the evidence against prejudice,
Mr. Gardner's representativewill present the evidence for it.
this hearing is, in effect, a trial within a trial...
your Honor Creary, you don't need to be present at this hearing.
are you here to testify?
uh, no, Your Honor. I don't want to give this mini-persecution any more attention than it needs.
but I do want to face my accusers.
well, that is your right, Your Honor.
uh, Judge Creary's prejudice will be this hearing's one and only issue, rules of evidence will apply, and my ruling will be final.
is that understood by all counselors?
Yes, Your Honor. - Good. Then we will begin.
Hi. I'm Grace.
uh, sorry. Uh, that's my real name.
I'm really sorry about the other Grace.
what do you want?
why aren't you in class?
why aren't you?
cause I saw you come in here.
look, I don't need anything, okay?
we broke up. It was a while ago.
she didn't do it 'cause of me.
you know, you really shouldn't smoke.
you're the politician's daughter, the one caught with a hooker?
he wasn't caught with a hooker.
class is in session. Who's in there?
come out now. Right now!
if you don't want to get in trouble, come out right this minute!
they can't find us here.
I see you in there.
do you need me to deal with this, huh?
all right. All right, bye.
sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Saverese.
Hey, no problem.
about your losing tow truck bid
we can't sue Strickler Automotive, but we can appealon the basis of fraud.
but just to warn you, they're probably going to say you cheated, too.
well, I thought your company was protecting meagainst all that crap.
Yeah. Unfortunately, Strickler's proven quite litigious.
now, there's a chance we may end up in deposition, so I have to ask you a few questions.
you were convicted on a drug charge.
cocaine. Intent to sell.
and how many years were you in?
two. It was Canadians. You know, they've got soft hearts.
and... you're not involved now in drugs?
what's that suit you're wearing?
suit?
Uh...Oh, it's Calvin Klein. Why?
you need a lot of suits like that to work here, do you?
Yeah. Yeah, some.
but you don't wear suits like that when you're out and about?
I mean, on weekends, you don't wear suits like that, do you?
no.
good,'cause then people might think you're gay or something.
Oh... you're not gay, are you? I'm sorry if...
is something... the matter, Mr. Saverese?
what, like you being gay?
I don't mind gay people.
why don't we take this up tomorrow?
Why? Did I offend you?
no. No, I just...I think we should take this up tomorrow when Alicia's back in the office.
sure. Sure.
Yeah. I mean, why not pay for two lawyers, not just one?
Yeah, that's, uh...
that sounds good.
okay.
I was walking to the Bar's resting room when I ran into Judge Creary
did you approach him?
no. I was walking past him, and he called me.
and what did you talk about?
he told me I was losing and that my client was guilty.
actus reus.
a guilty act? - Yes. I told himhe hadn't yet heard all the evidence, and that's when he accused me of being a disbarred lawyer and of bribing judges.
objection. Your Honor, if Judge Creary would like to testify, he is welcome, but he should refrain from editorializing.
excuse me. I think his honor has shown great patience, young lady.
I know what you think, Your Honor.
does that mean you overrule my objection?
the gallery should remain silent.
how did the conversation end with Judge Creary, Mr. Gardner?
he told me, if it was up to him, I would never practice law again.
thank you, no further questions.
Hello, Mr. Gardner. - Hi, Counselor.
you say Judge Creary accused you of being a disbarred lawyer, and that was untrue?
Yes, I was suspended for six months but not permanently disbarred.
Congratulations.
objection. - I'll withdraw that, Counselor.
do you know what the first search result is when you type "Will Gardner"into a Chumhum search engine?
that was a practical joke by an opponent.
would you mind reading what it says there?
do you want 'Will Gardner Disbarred Lawyer'?
but, again, this is a joke.
but you can understand why he might mistake youfor a disbarred lawyer.
the fact that I was arguing in his court might suggest otherwise.
but it's no secret you've had troubles this past year.
you were suspended for stealing money from a client.
is that correct? - Yes, but I replaced it.
judge Crearycalled you a thief and a liar.
can you really say those characterizations are inaccurate?
objection, Your Honor.
the question is whether or not Judge Creary showed biasby making these comments, not whether or not they were true.
sustained.
wow, that's some defense. Our lawyer may be a thief and a liar, but the judge really can't say it.
objection. - Sustained.
no further questions, Your Honor.
I'd like to call Judge Creary to the stand.
he's had a change of heart and would like to testify.
you've heard Mr. Gardner's accusations against you?
I have.
and did you, in fact, call him a thief?
no, I did not.
did you offer your opinions on the current case?
I did not. - Oh, my God, you're lying.
Mr. Gardner, you'll find yourself in contempt.
do you know why Mr. Gardner would be accusing you of this?
well, I can only guess that he had...
he had many objections sustained against him that day and he thought I was biased.
but everything else he said about this...bar encounter is a lie?
Yes.
we need to find a witness from the bar.
Hi. That was nice, getting a call.
I'm sorry, did I stop calling you or you stop calling me?
no, I called you - you just didn't return. Three times.
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm a jerk.
mm, so...how much is this one worth? $80 a glass?
no, four dollars. Things are tough in Spain these days.
Oh, of course. How is the family fortune?
reduced by 70%.
Ouch. Things are not great all over.
no. I read about your firm. And you.
where are you going after this?
where am I going?
I don't know. What about you?
I was gonna go home and read a briefing.
a big long brief about farm subsidies.
sounds like a Thursday night.
light some candles, run a bath, read about the viability of ethanol as a fuel supplement.
how viable is it?
pretty damn viable.
more so than you might think.
that's not bad for four dollars.
Oh, I lied - it's Dominio de Pingus. It's $180 a glass.
I'll count pennies tomorrow.
why aren't you reading your e-mails? I sent you three e- mails today.
I am reading my e-mails.- Just not mine?
well, I always know when it's important, you'll seek me out, and...
here you are.
uh... that one... that one there. Click on it.
and now the attachment. Click on it.
have you been hanging around schools, Eli?
it's not ours.
this is a tracker from the other side.
that always sounds so sci-fi.
Eli... - It's the other campaign. They're looking for vulnerabilities.
she was followed to school?
this campaign has become about family values.
Kresteva has a kid with leukemia - he wants to make it seem that you have a smoker who cuts class.
what is going on with my life?
where are you? We need you over here.
appreciate the opportunity...
it's not about the opportunity. The campaign needs you, Jay.
things are falling apart here, and they're getting angry at me.
I can't work full-time.
what about after school?
did you see anyone follow you to school? - No.
I don't know. I'll call you again.
Hey, n-n-no...This is so creepy.
I was sitting on a bench talking to a friend. What's wrong with that?
who's the friend?
Connor. - Who's Connor?
a boy. - Grace...
I'm not smoking.
I know. I didn't say you were.
these trackers...they will find any opportunity to paint you in a negative light, Grace.
I know. Is that it? Mom...
Zach, could you give us a second?
the girl who...committed suicide
Why? Why did she do it?
I don't know.
she was cutting.
she w...cutting herself?
it's not that weird; a lot of girls do it.
cut themselves? Why? Why would they do that?
I don't know. - Self-hatred?
I... I think it feels good to heal.
you would tell me if there's anything wrong?
I'm not cutting, Mom.
I know. It doesn't have to be that. I just...
I love you, Grace.
I love you, too.
I know. You're a good girl.
so, what do you need, Will?
what do I need? Why do you think I need anything?
that look on your face.
you're beautiful.
Oh, yeah?
the other night with Judge Creary... Oh.
what? No, I thought it was that.
he denied it. It's my word against his. You were there.
so that's why you're here?
no.
but it wouldn't hurt.
this is why I am not gonna do it. - Do what?
testify for you. Creary was just showing off for me and giving you a hard time 'cause we dated.
and you're the one who blew it out of proportion.
he said my client was guilty.
people say a lot of things.
you said that you returned my phone call.
so this is about not returning your calls?
no, this is about not seeing the upside of crossing a judge.
the upside is: it's the truth.
and that's your real goal here?
the truth.
we could subpoena you.
Yeah, you could.
what, you come to tell us how the other half lives?
still a $200 buy-in?
I don't know - might be time to raise it.
so, you happy to be back at your old firm?
Ah, Gardner - he's got it out for me.
yeah? Man, he's got it out for everyone.
Oh, yeah, your boss, he must be pissed.
you still clerking with Creary?
Yeah. He is not happy.
but, well, he hasn't been happy for a while.
Oh, yeah? Why is that, the double shifts?
no, his wife. Well, I guess his ex-wife.
is it fair to consider you a reluctant witness here, Mr. Chapin?
it is fair to consider me both reluctant and really pissed.
because you've been subpoenaed?
Yes. And because I thought I was talking to a friend.
now, you are Judge Creary's law clerk?
Yes. I'm sorry, sir.
don't worry.
after Will Gardner'ssuspension, what did you observe Judge Creary saying about Mr. Gardner?
he called Mr. Gardner a liar and a thief.
and these are the same words that Judge Crearydenied speaking in their recent bar encounter?
objection, Your Honor.
sustained.
to your knowledge,
Mr. Chapin, is Judge Creary the only judge in Cook County who made derogatory comments about Willduring his suspension?
no. Everyone was talking about it.
and all the judges were joking about it, too.
which judges in particular do you recall made comments?
judge John Ferraro? Didn't he recently rule in favor of Will Gardner on a vehicular manslaughter suit?
I believe so.
objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
it's relevant because it proves a judge is fully capable of putting personal feelings about defense counsel aside when deciding a case.
I quite agree. Overruled.
we need to move offof the personal animus strategy.
the key is his prejudging our client's guilt.
well, what about the witness at the bar?
she won't testify.
can't we subpoena her? - I'm not sure she'll tell the truth.
what else did your friend say about Creary?
you mean my ex-friend?
well, since Creary's divorce, he's been struggling with alcohol.
going to AA? - Yes. Why?
are we sure we want to go there?
I don't know. If you go nuclear, don't leave missiles in your silo.
so, are you gonna go to the funeral?
you should go to the funeral.
why are you so interested in her?
what do you mean? I'm not interested in her.
all you want to do is talk about her.
I don't know. I just feel bad.
I thought you didn't know her.
I know, but I could still feel bad.
it's just weird. Her being dead.
it's not weird.
do you believe in God?
no. - Why not?
why is that funny to you?
you're funny.
girls don't come here to... talk about God.
they come in here to have sex?
is that what she did?
the other Grace?
we're not gonna have sex.
I didn't ask you.
you're right.
no.
so that's it?
I'm late to class.
tomorrow?
yeah? Oh, hi.
no, no, that's good.
do you mind looking into Judge Creary's drinking?
okay. Everything okay?
Yeah, my daughter's two steps away from dating Keith Moon, but everything's fine.
look, if you want to go out for a drink or you want to speak, just give me a call, all right, and I'll get onto that.
all right, take care.
who's that?
work. The place where I work.
was it Cary?
it wasn't Cary.
you need to give it a rest on the whole alpha male thing.
yeah?
I don't understand. How can we take a ten percent dive in I. T?
we were in the middle of a reorganization, and we've hit a bump.
what bump?
I lost my volunteers. - Well, get new ones.
no, there was one I needed.
and what happened? - He's in school. He can't work anymore.
are you insane? He's in school and he can't work anymore?
you tell him he has to work.
he's new. He's not very committed...
okay, shut up. Is he here?
where?
Jay, this is Eli Gold. Jay is a new volunteer.
where are you going?
no, kid, you're staying.
Mr. Gold would like to offer you a job.
no, let him go.
damn it.
are you pacing me?
another round, please.
two more beers? Sure.
want me to get her number for you?
do you ever get jealous?
do I get jealous? Yeah, why?
of who?
I don't know. People I'm dating. When they meet someone else.
I'm narcissistic enough to thinkwomen should give up sex altogether after me.
you jealous of someone?
how do you stop being jealous?
you stop caring. Start seeing other people.
like anything, it wears off after a while. - Yeah.
or... you tell the person, "I don't want you to see other people."
but then you have to be ready to back it up.
thank you.
you're welcome.
that's a very genuine "thank you" from you.
I have to go to an AA meeting now.
Hi, thank you. - Welcome.
hello. Welcome. - Hi.
hello. - Hi.
Oh, is this your first time?
at this meeting, yeah. I usually go to the one across town.
that's great. Well, welcome.
thank you. Actually, I'm looking for a friend of mine, Harrison.
do you know if he's coming tonight?
I don't. He's usually here by now.
he's doing well, isn't he?
thank you, Mrs. Vaughn.
do you attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetingswith Judge Harrison Creary?
Mrs. Vaughn?
I do.
what does the judge share with the group at these meetings?
your Honor, this is truly outrageous.
alcoholics Anonymous has a strict code of confidentiality.
Yes, Counselor, unfortunately, AA is not covered by client, patient, or clergy privileges, and answers can be compelled here.
I don't agree with this, but the law is the law.
again, what has the judge shared at these meetings, ma'am?
he recently returned to addictionwhen his wife left him.
this is cruel.
and did he say what happened when he drank?
he blacked out.
therefore, if Judge Creary had indeed prejudged Mrs. Van Zanten for- what did he call it?-her actus reus
and if he said as much to Mr. Gardner at the bar, then due to his blackouts, he might not remember it now?
ms. Hellinger, aren't you going to object?
am I going to...? Yes.
thank you, Your Honor.
sustained. Leading.
no further questions, Your Honor.
I'll keep this short and sweet.
you want to work for your dad's campaign, I won't stop you.
but I can't speak for your mother.
now, if you want some adviceas to how to present it to your mother, I would offer it.
Hey.
who's that? - Connor.
who's Connor? - Grace's friend.
grace. - Mr. Gold. About my mom.
Yes, yes, the best way to present it to your mom is that you're becoming a part of the campaign anyway.
you don't want to hate yourself by making your dad lose when there's a chance you could help your dad win.
okay.
best not to say I was here.
you weren't here.
I am ready to rule.
this trial has been, above all, angering.
I believe the defense- the ostensible defense
at the moment it seems to be the prosecution
they have resorted to rank character assassination.
they have inflictedon Judge Harrison Creary a personal examination that none of us could survive.
they...
they have dug through his confessions.
they have subpoenaed innocent bystanders and forced themto testify.
I am, to be frank, disgusted.
your Honor... - No, sit down.
unfortunately I believe the defense has proven its case.
I have doubts about Judge Creary's memoryof the evening in question.
to be factually correct does not mean to be right.
therefore, I am granting the defense's motion to substitute.
this case will be assigned to a new judge.
next time in front of a jury.
I think you'll want to consider taking a plea first - 25 years?
and why would we do that?
because your client was cheating on her husband. - No.
actus reus - it's not just Latin for "guilty act."
it's an online forum for cheating spouses.
that's why Judge Creary said "actus reus."
before his divorce he visited the forum.
that's when he saw your client's profile.
still doesn't mean she killed him.
you're right, but we're checking the Actus Reus logs, and my guess is, we'll find somebody elseyour client solicited to murder her husband.
or you can take the 25 years.
you know I share an office now.
so? - So I don't think Cary would appreciate you sitting at his desk.
I've just gotten wordthat the trackers are following Zach, too.
Yeah, we knew that.
Yes. I just wanted to let you know that they're involving your children in the campaign.
I knew that, too.
I thought you might considerallowing them to be interviewed.
no.
if Peter loses, you don't want your kids to blame themselves.
Eli, I'm tired. Please just go.
okay. Can't say I didn't try.
I won't.
Oh. Hey, I'm sorry, buddy. Are you all right?
I hope I didn't ruin your suit.
Hey, sorry, sorry.
sorry about that.
Hey, let, let me help you up.
what is that, Calvin Klein?
hello.
I want to help with Dad's campaign.
okay, let's talk.
I can help, and Grace and I are already part of the campaign whether we want to be involved or not.
I don't want to be partof the problem, I want to be part of the solution.
and how do you become part of the solution?
by helping at the campaign office.
I'd work on their computers after school.
it's only a 30-minute drive, and I'd go straight there.
and you'd only work in the campaign office?
Yes, Mom, and I'd still do my homework afterwards, everything, I promise.
should I come back?
no, we're fine.
okay, I'll think about it.
okay.
you will? - I will.
what was that about?
you smell like cigarette smoke.
it's not me.
it's him? - Yeah.
let's go.
come on, come on.
Hey.
can you stop eating those?
what?
well--they just kind of make your dreath
Brian, l'm watching this.
come on, it's just the news.
Yeah, well, l'm watching.
well, that's discouraging.
what?
l guess l should have known when l saw those pajamas.
they're your pajamas.
exactly.
what's wrong with them?
l mean, are we ever gonna have sex again?
Hey, what do you want?
we never see each other, and when we do, it's late, and we haven't talked, and we don't go out, so why don't you at least try acting like you like me defore you
l love you. You know that.
l know, Brian.
you know what? l'm just really tired.
TV: We're going to take you live now to Andrew Solomon, who's in Wilkinsdurg, where a police raid is in progress.
ANDREW: Thank you, Julie.
that's right, l'm standing here at the corner of Dover and Penn avenue, where a dust has just occurred at an oriental massage parlor where allegedly, a lot more than just massages could de purchased.

l need something else.
sure.
l need you to go to the clerk's office and find out if dail has deen set for a woman named Janine Crane.
who is she?
she's a woman who, uh...
the woman l was with when l got arrested.
Hey, Jake.
Hey.
so did you hear adout Masterson?
Yeah. l hear the D. A.'s got an open-and-shut case.
they caught the woman left handed.
come on.
well, look, he hired Hanratty to defend himself.
once again, he's in good hands.
lt's a pretty-- pretty serious matter.
apparently, the woman claims she's innocent.
l'm pretty certain she had a hand in it.
so, Jake, we had a partner's meeting yesterday to discuss your deal.
great.
so you are an income partner.
you--you don't have a vote yet, dut your salary is as we agreed, and your donus will de commensurate to your performance.
OK. So what's the first order of dusiness?

Congratulations.

Yeah.

your image is what we need right now.
someone like you, married with family values, to meet with the press, l mean, to help us through this time.
Alvin has just deen charged, he's not convicted of anything.
moral turpitude clause, it's in his contract.
lt's in yours, as well.

Oh, no, l know, l understand that, l'm just saying
you were hired as associate director of this clinic.
lt's time for you to do that jod.
Lulu. -Hey.
so, this whole Alvin thing's a little crazy, huh?
l think it's stupid, if you ask me.
Really? Why?
Yeah, going to a massage parlor?
you have a prodlem with a man going to a massage parlor?
l have a prodlem with getting up at 3 A. M. to dail Alvin out, and l have a prodlem taking on all of his cases decause he can't control himself.
Yeah.
well, l'll--l'll de in my office.
uh, Nick, you have a shelter hearing at 10: 30.
OK.
l'm sorry to dother you.
no, no, it's no prodlem, l
l just, uh, l've got a lot of work going on right now, so
mayde later.
well, what is it?
can l just
please, uh, l need some help, and l can't talk to anydody at L. S.P. adout it.
OK, why don't you come on in my office?
ls your computer on?
Yeah, why?
uh, can you go on the internet?
punch in " thelovelorn. "
Why?
just punch it in.
ls this some kind of joke?
got it? -Yeah.
OK, scroll down to the dottom.
that's a good picture of you.
click it.
[Sighs] Bardara, l'm sorry.
gosh, that sucks.
Yeah, l used to go to this site, iron city singles, l'd stay late at work 'cause l don't have a computer.
anyway, l met this guy there.
lgnatiusjreilly, you know, from " Confederacy Of Dunces, " which is a great dook, dut another story.
l was myrnaminkoff, and we started chatting, and, l don't know, there was something adout it, having someone to talk to, just talk, without deing judged or stared at.
l just felt like, for the first time in a very, very long time, someone was really listening to me, considering me.
why don't you, uh
how--how long did this go on for?
[Sighs] A few months.
we started chatting.
he asked for my picture after a couple of chats, and l said that l wouldn't give it to him decause l've had experiences with men when they see me.
and l didn't want him to imagine me like l am, l guess.
and then at one point l emailed him.
l told him adout my size.
he said that it was fine, that, uh, he wasn't perfect, either.
so l had my mom take that picture, and l scanned it at work, and then l sent it.
and then last night he emailed me to go to the lovelorn site.
l'm so sorry, Bardara.
l want it down, Jake.
Yeah, well, l don't dlame you, dut, uh, listen, this is a tough case.
l mean, we can argue defamation, dut he's got his rights.
l want it down.
come on, Bryant, come on out.
Damn!
miss Solt, where is this child's counsel?
l'm here, your honor.
he is out of control, Mr. Fallin.
calm him down or you're sanctioned!
Hey, come here, come here.
Ow! Ow!
let go of me!
let go of me! Put me down! -Come here, you.
all right, listen.
you're going to stand here and you're going to de quiet, OK?
judge: What is going on?
what is he doing now?
he's having a convulsion.
James, excuse me, we have 3 families coming in with new cases.
will you take them?
l'm swamped.
[Sighs] We all are.
those...
Hey, everydody.
Lulu, after l meet with Seth, l need to see you.
woman: Social Services, sorry to keep you waiting.
[Sighs] Gosh, Alvin, um, we've deen concerned.
the clinic is going to get through this.
well, adout you.
Seth, this will all clear up.
l'm facing a third degree misdemeanor and they have a weak case.
listen, Alvin, you duilt this place.
you made it what it is. lt's your vision.
you want me out of here?
Alvin, it's not me.
your contract contains a morals clause.
the doard wants to suspend you until this is resolved.
l'm on the doard. Hell, l created the doard.
lf l'm not convicted of a crime, how can the doard argue that l did anything wrong?
you were arrested in a massage parlor.
Alvin, you did something wrong.
no, Seth, l didn't.
ALVlN: Lulu. -Yeah.
l need you to represent Janine Crane.
Why?
social services took her daughter Emily.
they put her in a shelter and they're making noises adout not letting her out.
Ugh. Alvin, you know, Mr. Hallowell said that
this isn't Seth's clinic, it's mine.
listen, she's already a client.
5 years ago, l represented Janine in a shelter hearing.
you don't think this is a conflict?
l've already discussed this with her.
she's waived whatever conflict there might de.
besides, for now, l'm suspended.
LAURlE: He had a seizure.
they took him to Pittsdurgh County.
judge: Where's the mother?
ln prison--she was arrested for drugs 4 weeks ago.
the father's not in the picture.
Where's he deen staying since the mother's arrest?
he's deen staying with his aunt Cheryl for the past couple of months.
she took him in decause the mother would de gone for weeks at a time getting high, dut the aunt can't handle him.
that's why we were in court today.
can the mother make medical decisions for the child?
she's finding recovery challenging.
just last week, they found drugs in her cell.
Mr. Fallin, l need to appoint a medical guardian.
you think you can handle the responsidility?
well, l...
ms. Wilcox said her sister Cheryl could make medical decisions.
Oh, Mr. Fallin will step in as temporary medical guardian.
l'll have my clerk notify you of the new hearing date.
be prepared to fully drief the court on the child's condition.
LULU: lt's pretty simple, Janine.
you win your case, you'll prodadly keep your daughter.
otherwise, she will end up in foster care.
hmm.
l'm assuming that you want to keep Emily.
of course.
all right.
well, they're going to look into your housing situation, so is there anything that l need to know?
adout?
where you live.
um, in an apartment.
adove my dusiness.
Oh, you mean you live right adove the
Yeah.
what?
why do you do this?
Why? -Yeah.
uh...
money. Why else?
l don't know.
l mean, l don't work just for money, so...
well, good for you.
what does that mean?
no college.
no high school, really. No parents, no money.
l mean, l'm not trying to tell you a sod story, dut looking at you, l--l'm guessing somedody out there loves you, helps you.
but, still, l mean, selling, uh
a lot of the men that you see are--are married.
that's not my fault.
what adout their wives?
l can't say it's their fault, either.
lt's...
the way some men are.
lt's just sex, Mrs. Olsen.
lt's not fun.
l don't like it, dut it's something l know how to do.
mommy!
Emily, oh l missed you. l missed you.
they can't release her.
why not?
l mean, Janine hasn't deen convicted of anything yet.
we don't know what's going to happen with the court case, so for now, Emily has to stay in the shelter.
Dr. Wasserman l'm looking for.
Dr. Wasserman, l'm Nick Fallin.
bryant Wilcox, right? You're his medical guardian?
that's right.
his films show no aneurisms, no drain tumors, he's not an epileptic, nothing normally associated with the type of seizure that he suffered, dut the results from his dlood work show a lead level of 85.
ls that high?
anything adove 10 is considered dangerous.
well, uh, how could it get like that?
the projects are full of lead paint that should have deen adated years ago.
the kids eat the paint chips, inhale dust that flakes from the wall.
by the time the parents realize it, their child's already sick.
NlCK: Could it have caused his seizure?
his seizure, his intense hyperactivity, his speech and developmental delay, and neurological damage.
can it de treated?
chelation therapy attempts to drain the lead particles from the dlood.
lt's painful, and only so effective.
Hi.
rememder me from court? My name's Nick.
Dr. WASSERMAN: Bryant likes to hug.
l need a copy of his records.
l'm trying to put together a medical history.
so are we, dut we don't even know if he has a pediatrician, and we can't locate the mother.
we were hoping you'd know where she is.
sure.
can you tell me the name of your son's pediatrician?
some clinic.
the one up on Fordes and Oakland.
took Bryant there.
well, should l just ask your sister Cheryl?
adout Bryant?
she never took him to no doctor.
you took him even when he wasn't living with you?
he's my kid.
do you rememder the name of any of the doctors that treated Bryant?
you need anything like that, you talk to my lawyer.
why would your pudlic defender have a medical record on your son?
not him, my private guy.
Mr. Hansen. -Marc Hansen?
Oh, OK. Thank you.
and me and Mr. Hansen-- we're suing the landlord on account of the lead paint.
when l get out, l get Bryant dack, right?
that's for the court to decide.
bryant Wilcox? Sure.
lead case. Carter Street projects.
a lot of sick kids. How do you know him?
l'm representing him.
his mom's in jail, and l'm placing him.
jail?
nice to let her lawyer know, huh?
but that's the kind of clients you deal with when you do personal injury.
how's dusiness, man? -lt's fine.
you've deen all over the place.
l tried calling you two weeks ago at the new firm, dut the phones forwarded me dack to your Dad's place.
well, we're working together again.
lt's called Fallin and Fallin.
so defore l can find Bryant a home, l need a copy of his medical records.
ls there a chance this kid might need to de placed in some kind of group home?
special needs home, yeah.
that helps your case. Worth more money.
Tara, could you please make a copy of the Bryant Wilcox file?
how's Julie? -Beautiful as ever.
say hello to her for me.
Hey, why don't you come over for dinner
Saturday night, huh, you know?
lt's deen too long. l know she'd love to see you.
Yeah, it'd de great. l'd like to do that.
all right, l'll have Tara messenger a copy of Bryant's meds to you tonight.
all right.
can you--can you send them to legal services?
how much longer you got to do that?
l just came dy to see how things are going with Janine and Emily.
uh, well, Social Services is keeping Emily for now.
you can't get her out?
no. Laurie Solt said no, so...
are you really going to lose your jod over this?
the D. A.'s offering me a deal.
Oh?
l give up Janine, and they reduce my charge to a violation.
great.
well, do it.
well, they're asking me to lie.
Janine and l--it was never adout money.
l never paid her.
Alvin, you know, you work so hard and
and everyone respects you, l don't understand. l mean, why?
why would you go
what's one got to do with the other?
am l any less of a lawyer decause l have a sex life?
no, dut--dut the prostitute is what l'm talking adout.
she may have deen a prostitute, dut she wasn't with me.
lgnatiusjreilly?
who the hell are you?
l'm Jake Straka.
and this is a cease and desist letter.
what?
Myrnaminkoff wants off your wed site.
l expect it to de down dy midnight tonight.
you're the one that told me to come here?
Yeah, that's right.
Where's my money?
you don't get it, dumd ass.
lf you don't take this down, l'm going to sue the crap out of you and your parents, OK?
Oh, really? -Yeah.
Where's my money?
all you're getting is a lawsuit, pal.
this guy posed as a fat chick.
look, guys, this is a legal dispute, OK?
l don't care what it is.
Hey, take it easy.
he's the one that promised us 600 ducks.
Hey, take it easy, OK? Just take it
Ohh!
Hey, l want my money.
OK?
eat this.
l met with lgnatiusjreilly.
so he's not gonna take the pictures down.
OK.
so we're gonna go after him in court.
we are?
l'm gonna hit him with a petition for special injunction, haul him into court today.
on what dasis? -Defamation.
Yeah, dut you said-- -No, the site states that you wanted to have sex with him.
that goes to your character. That is defamation.
so, first we're gonna get him to take the site down, then we're gonna sue him.
lf he doesn't have any money, we go after his assets.
lf he doesn't have any assets, we go after his parents' assets.
his parents?
Yeah, l went to Pitt, too, and l know people.
so l'm getting him thrown out.
he's a college student?
Yeah, l'm sorry, he is.
l'm gonna dury his ass.
l came as soon as l got your message.
uh, this seizure was worse.
he's in a coma.
but he's gonna come out of it, right?
lt's too early to know.
l have a copy of his medical records.
they say that his lead levels kept increasing up until the last month and then leveled off.
well, if they leveled off, that means the exposure prodadly ended.
lf a decision needs to de made adout life support
no. l
no, what?
just no. l
Alvin, come on in.
ALVlN: Listen
Alvin, you don't have
Janine and l have an adult relationship.
clearly.
what l mean is, years ago, after l got divorced, l represented her.
we spent time. We liked each other.
why are you telling me this?
l never paid her, Laurie.
she was not--is not-- the kind of person who deserves to de known just as another
another what?
a prostitute.
then what is she?
she's a kind woman.
a good mother.
she deserves to have her child--with her.
and if she goes to prison?
well, then that's another story.
but until the criminal charges are resolved, why not allow her to have the time she should have with her daughter?
OK.
thank you.
Alvin? -Yeah?
lf you paid for it, so what?
Cynthia Wilcox? -Yeah?
Hi, l'm Nick Fallin. We spoke earlier.
how is he?
um, have you ever had your apartment tested for lead paint?
the Department of Health came through.
and what did they find?
told me it was clean.
OK. ln the time that Bryant was with you, did you ever notice any kind of change in his dehavior?
he was just going dackwards.
forgetting stuff he already knew.
boy couldn't even dress himself anymore.
l have the records of Bryant's dlood tests the weeks leading up to your sister's arrest.
did you take him for those tests?
no. Myriam did all that.
even when she was out dinging, she'd always make sure she'd come dy to take Bryant to the clinic.
she's got her prodlems, dut she's a good mother.
great. Thank you.
Amy, l need a copy of the cases on internet privacy law, OK?
Jake, look, l took a look at these Kessler Kleaner papers that you prepared. Um
OK.
l can't give them to my father.
they're dad?
well, they're not great.
OK, l'll have them done on time.
what are you working on?
uh...
uh, Bardara Ludzinski came dy to see me.
she--she got into this relationship with this guy on the 'net, and he humiliated her, so l'm just trying to get him to take the site down.
do you need a hand with that Kessler case?
no, no. l'm on top of it.
l could take it over. -No.
do you want me to help with the Ludzinski prodlem?
no. This is my thing.
all right.
Amy! Damn it, l need a copy of the case law, OK?
thank you.
for getting them to give Emily dack to me.
you know that might only de temporary?
lf you're convicted-- -l know...
l'm in troudle.
the D. A.
they're pressuring that new girl, Lee, to testify.
they're pressuring me, too.
but l never asked you for money.
Nodody wants to delieve that.
look, Lee's gonna say whatever they want her to say.
she's 19. She's scared.
Janine, she could implicate doth of us.
you're gonna take a deal?
l know our relationship wasn't like they want me to say it was, dut l also know how you make your living, and they're gonna get you for that
with or without my help.
Jake: Henry Lean posted Miss Ludzinski's personal correspondence and photograph on a wedsite under a heading which read, " Check out this fat loser who wants to get it on with me. "
now, this insinuates that Miss Ludzinski is willing to have sex with a complete stranger, and is therefore, under common law, defamation, per se.
how so?
well, a claim that a woman is unchaste is defamatory as a matter of law, and has deen since the 1700s.
Judge...Ahem.
l'm not a lawyer, dut l am pre-law.
we have covered what the First Amendment means.
so, l know that as soon as Miss Ludzinski gave me that material, l was allowed to do whatever l wanted with it.
now, l asked my law professor, and he told me that, uh, she
excuse me.
'Miss Ludzinski has no reasonadle " expectation of privacy.
'lt's deen well estadlished dy the courts already. "
l mean, that's what he told me.
Jake, you did your dest.
my dest?
just got my ass handed me on a platter dy a college student?
well, uh-- -did you ever ask that little
did you ever ask that little
did you ever ask him to not show the letters or the photos to anyone?
l don't rememder.
think, damn it. Did you ever ask him?
l may have.
ls there any correspondence that l haven't seen?
l don't rememder.
l'm gonna sudpoena his computer.
listen, Jake-- -Look, just go dack to work.
check everything that you ever saved.
see if you ever asked him not to show the letters to anyone.
well, l don't think l did.
do it! We can claim dreach of contract.
but, Jake-- -Look, just do it, OK?
l'll come dy later.
l know you've deen feeding Bryant paint chips.
l don't know what you're talking adout.
then explain to me why Bryant's lead levels kept increasing the month defore your incarceration.
well, l don't know.
there was lead all over that damn apartment.
he wasn't living in your apartment that last month.
he was living with your sister, and her apartment is lead-free.
l don't know what you're talking adout.
you would pick Bryant up once a week, and take him to your apartment and feed him paint chips.
a few hours later, you would take a drive to the clinic, and he would get a dlood test.
you're crazy!
l'm gonna go and talk to the D. A.
he didn't say nothing adout no seizures.
who? -The lawyer.
when l took Bryant to the doctor for his start of school check-up, they said he had the lead.
so one of my friends in the duilding said l should go see Mr. Hansen, that he could get us some money.
but Mr. Hansen said that
that my doy's level was too low to de worth his time.
but l could do stuff that could make the case worth a million dollars.
he told you that?
Yeah.
he told all the mothers that.
ALVlN: Hey.
what are you doing here?
just--just working on a case.
you?
snuck in.
after everydody was gone.
didn't feel like sitting around my apartment.
l thought adout you this week.
that night in jail.
l've deen there defore, you know.
getting arrested for protests.
but, uh, when you're in for something personal, it's
scary. -Yeah.
when you were awaiting trial, they offered you a deal, right?
Mm-hmm.
but you didn't take it? -No.
why not?
l didn't do anything wrong.
Hey. -Hi. Oh, thank you.
so?
l can't find anything.
you looked everywhere on the site?
well, l--l never told him he couldn't show anyone else.
you sure you looked?
what adout your hard drive? Did you
Jake, please.
um, l--l don't wanna look at this stuff anymore, OK?
l mean
lie. -No.
no, just say that mayde you have it on
Jake, no. -Look, Bardara, l
l know you mean well.
and these last couple of days, l never imagined that you would feel so strongly...
adout me.
That--that--that you could--- could drop everything and de so, l don't know, passionate?
they--they deat me up.
when l went to see them, they, uh--the kid and his friends-- they
they--they punched me and they threw me on the ground, OK?
l--l am a partner in a law firm now.
and they--they did that.
so what--what l am asking you to do is
let you get even, right?
let you get even.
sorry.
no, l--l just misunderstood.
let it go, Jake, OK?
lf l can, so should you. Just--just let it go.
Hey, man. Have a seat.
get those files l sent you?
Yeah.
Saturday night
Julie has a friend coming in from Philly. Huh.
a very pretty friend.
did you tell your clients to feed their children paint chips?
what are you talking adout?
she told me you wouldn't take her case until her son's lead levels were higher.
her case wasn't worth enough, dut l didn't tell her
she said you told that to all the mothers in the duilding.
Yeah, well...
let's rememder who you're talking with here, Nick,
all right?
this is a crack addict in prison.
come on.
you didn't find it strange that the kid's levels were 4 times higher on the second visit to your office?
l have 37 lead cases, Nick.
l'm not a doctor, OK?
l don't monitor them all.
but you did tell her the case would de worth more with higher lead levels.
why are we even having this conversation, man?
l mean, if this woman is stupid enough to feed her kid lead paint, huh?
lf she's that dumd, anything l say to her could de misconstrued.
Misconstrued?
or was she just following instructions?
l didn't do anything wrong.
Nick, if you make any noise adout this, your client, my client, won't see a dime.
ls that what you want?
l spoke to the D. A.
testify against Hansen and you won't de prosecuted for child aduse.
l--l--l don't know.
they don't care adout you, they care adout Hansen.
and so l gotta--l gotta snitch on all the moms in my project?
Yes.
the ones giving their kids the lead?
Yes.
OK.
there's one more thing.
what's this?
lt's your consent to relinquish parental rights.
what's that mean?
lt means that you will no longer have legal standing as Bryant's mother.
you wanna take my dady away from me?
you gonna do that to my doy?
you know what it's gonna de like for him, growing up without a mother?
Yeah.
[Grunts] Do not disrespect me! Ever!
Hey.
you look very pretty in these pajamas.
but you look a lot detter out of them, huh?
what the hell's wrong with you, Lulu?
l mean, l've deen nice all week, and, we, uh, went out to dinner.
and l called you at the office at least 3 times a day to tell you l love you.
l mean, what else do l have to do?
stop having sex with hookers.
what are you talking adout?
you know what l'm talking adout.
a few weeks defore we got married, you got arrested for solicitation dy an undercover cop in the dar of the grand hotel.
you pled no contest, got a $600 fine and 4 Saturday afternoons at John School.
not extra classes in Columdus--John school.
Lulu-- -Do you think l'm stupid?
l was a clerk, for God's sakes.
l've got friends all over the court system.
Nick told you?
no, dut l know he represented you.
Lulu, listen
you know, l just don't know how you could do that with other women.
hookers.
and then come home to me.
lt's not you.
you're damn right it's not me!
[lronic laugh] lt's you!
lt was a stupid thing l did.
like last-second jitters.
Oh, OK.
so then you only did this once?
Yes.
don't lie to me. -l mean l'm sick.
lt's a sickness. l need help.
shut up! You're not sick!
but, Brian, why-- l mean, what are you
what are you looking for out there?
really, what the hell are you looking for?
should l leave?
no.
l accepted a deal.
l'm sorry to hear that.
two years--l'll de out in 1 2 months.
l'll make sure Emily gets a good placement.
lf it wasn't Lee, it would have deen one of my other employees or one of the customers that were dusted.
l wouldn't have testified against you.
why not?
because...
because you don't pay me money.
Alvin, a few years ago you helped me out with my kid.
every time l had a legal prodlem, l called you.
right.
that's how you paid me.
Jake, l took a look at that work.
lt's very good.
l--l stayed up all night working on it.
l was kind of, like, in the zone.
well, it was worth it.
Kessler's gonna like it a lot.
l know.
what happened with Bardara Ludzinski--that thing?
uh, the kid. l...
l dealt with him.
good.
come on in.
they dropped the charges.
all they wanted was Janine, so it's dehind us.
well, l got a lot of work to do.
Alvin, we're pleased. We're very pleased.
and we have no qualms in you retaining your position as director of the clinic.
thank you.
however, your seat on the doard has deen reassigned.
there was no conviction.
we're not comfortadle.
l founded this clinic.
right, dut you report to the doard.
the dylaws require that a director of the clinic de on the doard.
ln this case, the associate director will have to do.
what?
Mrs. Olsen has deen appointed in your place.
so, you'll still de director of this clinic, dut Lulu will have the vote upstairs.
l'm sorry, Alvin, dut we have donors to think adout.
Dr. WASSERMAN: Mr. Fallin.
Oh, l--hi. l just

Yeah, l know. l got held up at work.

this is how it works at Brabourne.
if you want to exist, you have to be pretty.
you have to be thin.
everyone else is wallpaper.
for years, I was a nobody.
l watched the world from the edges and learned not to dream.
[Wolf whistle]
my best friend, Martin, didn't care.
his philosophy was, take everything you can from them.
he said their greed makes them easy to control.
it made him powerful.
but then the world changed.
get ready, girls.
Mike Steel is single again.
Oh, my God! -Oh, my God!
[Cheers]
Mike Steel. American. The son of a rock star.
the missing part of my soul.
[Whistle blows]
please, get up. Please.
please be okay.
get up.
sorry, mate.
[Grunts]
see why this slob needs to wear body armor.
[Crowd gasps, whistle blows]
it's a homoerotic thing.
all that aggression out here and then all that steam and soap in the showers afterwards.
that's disgusting.
you two! Off!
[cheers and applause]
maybe Geoff will be Mike's new bride.
for your information, he's dating a supermodel called Amber.
for yours, he's not. -You lie.
don't you live here?
haven't you noticed that everyone's a blonde with cherry lip gloss?
there's been an invasion of Amber clones.
I thank God for that.
you're the last woman with a brain in Brabourne.
he's single?
half a brain? Yes.
[Laughs]
Oh, not you too, Liz. Please, don't lose it.
l didn't know.
but he's just a guy like me!
you wouldn't think he was perfect if you knew him.
he shits and farts like the rest of us.
he's just a lot less interesting.
l can't help it.
it's an egg thing.
when l look at Mike, l see the face of an Angel and the soul of a poet.
l need him.
no, no, no, no.
no, you love me.
it's a Martin Taylor fact.
has there been a day in the last five years that we haven't talked?
but you're more like a gay friend than a boyfriend.
but I'm not gay!
Yeah, right! -Yeah, right!
it's the end of term. I've got some grateful exes to call.
and most importantly, l am out of here.
Hello!
there is the small matter of the geography field trip.
Bentley, school gates, Friday. Off to L. A.
Bye. Nice time.
Oh, you are such a jockey.
Stevie will have a shit fit if you don't go.
you think I'm gonna tell him?
I'm gonna lie low in a hotel. He'll never know.
my arse!
the tabloids are gagging for you.
you are having a wet weekend in Wales with no hot water, fish-paste sandwiches, and 10-mile tabs, like it or not.
hmm. That's awful dark, Geoffrey.
I don't want to go either.
we have to ditch. I'm serious.
this could kill me.
well, Frankie's not going.
she saw Willy's on the kit list and nearly had a seizure.
how did she get out of it? -She saw Martin Taylor.
you know what I want.
show me the money.
I need to talk to you.
come.
what's she done this time?
Liz: My hair. It's all gone wrong.
I've messed up.
let me see.
young WOMAN: She may as well give you a tumor. [Laughs]
do you mind?
my course work doesn't write itself, you know.
what is it? -Intensive conditioner.
it should have you sorted in 20 minutes.
what did you use?
peroxide.
where from?
the lab.
Oh, Lizzie.
I thought if I was a blonde like Amber, then...
I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think doing stuff to yourself is gonna make any difference to Mike.
no.
Oh, don't worry about it.
trust me, he's not that wonderful.
[Sighs]
Thanks.
I know you don't have to be nice to me.
don't worry about it.
my life has no meaning.
come in, sit down, make yourself at home.
I love him, and he doesn't even know I exist.
I hate seeing you like this.
Hey, to cheer you up...
I've got chocolate.
Martin, you don't understand. You've never been in love.
you've never had the pain.
Oh, God, l feel like I'm dying.
I can help you.
Really?
really.
welcome to my office.
now, this is a need-to-know operation.
can you do it or not?
no field trip, no parents, no paparazzi.
I can do anything.
and, uh...
I'm adding one to your number.
a kindred spirit.
martin knew the school and our parents always believed each other.
he called it the "unholy alliance."
so if our parents thought we were going to Wales, and the school thought we were going home, they'd never question it.
oy, oy, here come the troops.
[Laughs]
Jesus, you're late!
did anyone see you?
[Baggage rattling]
just back from the Himalayas? -[Laughing]
Liz, Frankie you know. Geoff I'm sure you've heard of.
none of it is true.
except that one about the butter. That's true.
and Mike.
[Geoff sighing]
call me a muppet, but there's nothing here.
I'm not spending all weekend sitting on a tree trunk.
you can't see the wood for the trees.
are you taking the piss?
are you taking the piss, Martin?
I could snap your neck like that, mate.
it's right here. Can't you see it?
you know, you have about 10 seconds to become interesting.
it's right beneath your feet.
Oh, yes.
[Laughing] Oh, yes! Martin!
watch out, ladies.
dude! Ho! You all right?
Hey, I'm coming down. Hang on.
Whoo! -Whoo!
Yee-haw!
shit! -Whoo! Oh, man.
my goodness! -What a fucking thing!
Martin, where did you get the key?
wouldn't you like to know?
and what is this?
you know the old war bunker over there?
this is the escape hatch.
you're so weird, dude.
will you have to close it?
l need fresh air to keep my skin clear.
Oh, right. -Oh, stop!
you don't want to be found, do you?
no, we certainly don't.
nice one. See you later.
you're going in there? -Of course I'm going in there!
see you inside.
the power's on the left. -Yep.
Oh, no. What is that smell?
[Panting]
dude, it looks like a tomb.
And?
and I ain't going in there.
Aw. Like I care what you think.
[Chuckles]
hah...
can't be any worse than Wales, right?
Frankie: Me next.
martin: That's practical, Frankie.
you get that smell? What is that?
[Laughs]
you all right? -What?
you all right? -Yeah.
watch out for that bit.
Oh, man.
Mikey, look at this, man. Check this out.
this is huge!
look at that!
what is that stuff?
[Laughing] Whoa!
ladies, you are gonna love it down here!
tell him to send it up to your room, Frankie.
Frankie: Shut up! You speak out of order.
this way. -All right.
Jesus, it's so dark!
I'm going first.
Oh, God.
you going down? -Yeah.
the ladder stops, mate.
it's cool. It's cool.
Oh! -You need light?
Yeah, carry it down.
Frankie: What is that smell? It's disgusting.
enjoy the Mike Steel experience.
do you think he'll fall in love with me?
just be careful.
Liz, watch the step. -Mate, take a look at the pit.
pass the rucksack.
mind the ledge. It's really narrow.
martin: Are you all right?
Yeah, we're cool. -Close the door.
GEOFF: Bye-bye, Martin.
Bye-bye!
[Door slams]
come on, put the lights on!
Frankie, calm down. -Geoff!
can you put the lights on?!
[Keys jingling]
I don't like it!
Oh, God! Can you find the light switch?
Frankie, calm the fuck down!
Yee-haw! -[All cheering]
would you look at this?!
lights!
what do you think, girls?
Oh, my God!
[Mike screaming]
Ah! Oh, my God!
I shot you in the back, like, six times.
you're dead!
no brakes, but you know
we got a radio.
you're in the way.
you gotta move when we're rocking...
die! Die!
get out of the way!
we wanna wreck the town with the infidel rocket.
get out of the way, everyone!
get out of the way, everybody!
we love and you love us and you know it.
you're gonna die.
we love
we love you, we love you
we love you, we love you.
you mind if I borrowed some water for my pasta?
no, not at all. Do you want to go first?
Yeah, sure. Cheers, L.
it's great. It's got this hole down the middle so it cooks quickly.
have you got a pan I can borrow?
there you go. -Cheers.
what are you having on that?
GEOFF: Uh, nothing.
Ah, pasta nothing.
it's nice. It really nice.
I've got salt. Do you want some?
pasta and salt?
No! Thanks, though.
what are you having then?
I'm not really hungry.
you gotta have something eventually.
didn't really bring anything.
you didn't bring food? -Not " food " food.
what's "not 'food' food"? -Gum.
how do you expect to survive on gum for three days?
it slipped my mind. It just didn't occur to me.
okay, so food slipped your mind?
I've got food.
I've got sausages and beans and noodles.
plenty for everyone. You can have as much as you want.
you have sausages?
do you have tomato sauce?
some. -Ah!
you enjoy your pasta, okay?
I'm having sausages...
with Liz...
tonight.
no. No, thanks. I'm on a diet.
I've got fiber pills to stop me feeling hungry.
yum.
okay, now, wait. It's my turn.
my friend was driving his girlfriend in his Ferrari.
what? Who do you know with a Ferrari?
[Geoff laughing]
Bob and Sally.
Oh, Bob. Bob and who?
[Laughs] -Mike, don't!
really, relax.
Bob and Sally went for a drive, but they ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere.
Bob went out to find some, and Sally was left in the car, so she switched on the radio.
and they said there was this crazy madman on the loose.
she was really tired, and so she fell asleep...
Mike: On the roof of the car.
Bob's head on a stick.
on a hook!
no, this really happened!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Frankie.
okay, I've got one for you.
make you cack your pants.
what?
shut up.
something happens to Martin.
he doesn't come back for us.
told you.
that's sick.
but possible.
don't be stupid.
Geoff, you shouldn't say that. What if you make it happen?
how can I make anything happen to him when I'm down here?
you'll jinx us. -How?
it's tempting fate!
Oh, please! How does that work?
I'm a scientist. I don't believe in fate.
I'm a Scientologist. I'm with Liz.
Oh, yes! -Well, fine!
but if anything happens to Martin, it's Geoff's fault, okay?
if that's what it takes to get you to shut up, then fine.
fine. -Is this the best or what?
[Singing indistinctly]
Dr. HORWOOD: Liz. Liz. What happened on the third day?
don't you want to know what we did?
martin was supposed to let you out, wasn't he?
I don't know.
what don't you know? -I don't know what happened.
come on, you're safe here.
deep breaths. Look at me.
it's the third day. You're all packed and ready to go, right?
what's the time now?
same as when you asked two minutes ago.
it can't be the same time if two minutes have passed, can it?
it's 3: 32, then.
so, then, where is he?
the field trip's supposed to be back in 30 minutes.
I have a driver waiting. This is so...
what if he's been hit by a bus, is in a coma, and can't tell anyone where we are?
Oh, please.
Oh, my God.
what if he's dead?
he's not dead!
I'll call him. What's his number?
no, they don't work down here.
give me your phone. Let me try.
[Cellphone beeps]
you getting anything?
no, nothing. -You know what?
maybe give it a shot up by the door.
does it work?
no, nothing.
you've jinxed us. I knew you would.
this is a wind-up. -No, this is your fault!
you never should have said those things!
you guys!
have you ever thought that maybe the traffic's heavy?
I'm not worried.
all: Help! Help!
[Indistinct shouting]
I'm just trying to help!
GEOFF: What do you think I'm trying to do?!
shut up and let me get on with it!
I was thinking that.
Hey! -Huh?
Hey!
we're gonna wear ourselves out. -What if there's a pipe there?
why don't you have a go?
go on! Have a go!
[sobbing]
[Sighs]
Mike: Okay, they haven't found us.
they know we never went to Wales.
as far as they're concerned, we have a three-day head start, which means they could be covering a three-day radius of the school.
that covers, like, the whole world.
so, what do we do?
we're being held to ransom till Martin says so.
we can't do anything.
don't say that! He could just be ill.
lsn't that right, Lizzie?
I don't know.
but why? Why would he do this to us?!
we're his friends!
are we?
was he really your friend, Frankie?
I know he's not mine.
think about it. I don't know a thing about Martin.
he has no morals, no ethics. Everything's just a game to him.
so this is a game?
that's great. That's fucking wonderful.
Oh, my God, I paid for this.
Yeah, but he's careful. Nothing's left to chance.
right now we're trapped because he wants us trapped.
Why?
I guess we're gonna find out.
Dr. HORWOOD: Liz, look at me.
he didn't come back.
martin didn't come back.
Tom: You cracked her. I knew you would.
after I got your message,
I told the lads, "It's great cheer."
a bloody schoolboy and all.
good job, Doctor.
Thanks, Detective.
the hunt for the kidnapper of the Brabourne teenagers took an unexpected turn today as it was announced that police have arrested a pupil from the school.
the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was located in the Dominican Republic, where it is believed he was on holiday with his family.
I've put together a rough character sketch based on the information we have.
locking the children in suggests we have a sociopathic personality.
he doesn't think what he's done is wrong, thinks he's above the law, better than all of us.
now he's probably creating a very strong alibi.
so, the longer he has to conjure up this fiction, the harder it's going to be to crack.
if you want a confession, you have to act quickly.
so...
when the police arrest Martin, will they put him in a cell?
Dr. HORWOOD: I presume so.
good. I hope they do.
let's see how he likes it.
all right, let's start.
uh, hang on.
okay, I'm ready.
can we talk?
sure. Shall I come over there?
can I get in?
what's up?
can't sleep?
it's about Martin.
I think he's watching us.
I saw a shadow pass the slat.
it could be nothing. I could be wrong.
but I think it might have been him checking up on us.
probably is him.
[Chuckles] It's so funny.
steve sent me here to protect me from the nut jobs at home.
I think I know what Martin's doing.
what?
martin wants me to see that it was stupid of me to like you when I don't even know you.
he wants me to hate you.
we're still down here because he was wrong.
he hates being wrong.
we're stuck down here until he's right.
hold on.
you knew this would happen even before we came down here?
no. Of course not.
but it's the only explanation I can think of.
but what difference does it make?
he likes you, doesn't he?
Yeah. Since we were 1 1.
one of those.
Yeah.
but you...
like me.
Yeah.
sorry.
don't worry about it.
but... how does he know you don't hate me?
I mean, I don't...
I mean, how could he work that out from a split second at the door?
I don't know.
what is it?
what?
is that what I think it is?
Yeah.
are there more?
try that one over there.
which one?
this one.
he's covered the whole place.
Christ! -Mikey, what's going on?
Liz, it's the middle of the night.
what?
[Imitating vomiting]
I'm really worried about her. She needs a doctor.
that's obvious.
I thought you were supposed to be smart.
I bet it's that dirty toilet water that's making her ill.
it's not my fault.
Yes, it is!
this is shit! This is the worst time I've ever had.
I hope I never see you again.
it's not that bad!
no, things are very bad!
am I the only one who can smell the toilet?!
I've been polite, but who left the monster log that we can't fucking flush?!
we're fucked, and... it's all your fucking fault!
why me?
because he's your best friend! -Yeah!
l should have never came down here.
as soon as I saw you, you fucking, geeky, little fucking bitch,
I should have turned the other fucking way!
just stay the fuck away from me, you fucking loser.
you're not so great yourself. -[Imitates vomiting]
you're full of shit!
what are you, anyway?
you're just a face and... hair.
Oh, shut up, you...
fucking cumbag!
we waited and waited, and nothing happened.
but it worked.
the next morning, Mike woke me up, and the door was open.
we were so happy.
we were out.
we all grabbed each other and just stood in the light.
it was over. We'd beaten him.
we'd won.
what Martin didn't realize was that I'd even won Mike.
we ran up as quickly as we could.
Mike gave me a great big hug and he said, "You saved us.
you saved us all."
here we are.
right.
well done.
I told you you'd get through it. How do you feel?
lighter.
last night, I even closed the door, and I didn't panic.
excellent.
you've made a lot of progress.
we've still got a lot of work to do.
Yeah, but you'll get there. It's really good.
I'll see you later.
Yeah, Tom here.
Oh, it's Philippa. -What can I do for you?
listen, she thinks she spent the last week in fucking Disneyland.
I'm sorry. I didn't see it coming.
I'll get a confession out of Martin, no problem.
I mean, how delusional can she be?
so, I suppose you've got fingerprints, then...
or DNA?
cctv footage of me creeping around or a stack of witnesses with 20l20?
do you even have a motive?
a bloody good reason why I should lock up a bunch of socialites and throw away the key, however tempting that might be?
what did you do on the last day of term?
is she deaf?
is she thick?
I mean, can they really keep asking the same question hour after hour?
please.
just so we're clear.
I got up at 7: 00 A. M., as usual.
I cleaned my teeth and had a shit.
I was down at breakfast by 7: 20 A. M., as usual.
the matron ticked me off the list.
I had two slices of cold toast with warm butter and sweet tea, as usual.
I returned to my study and carried my bags to the school minibus at 8: 00 A. M.
and was sat on the minibus by 8: 05.
I sat beside the driver because I wanted to sit on my own.
we left for the station at 8: 30 A. M.
and arrived at a not-unreasonable 8: 45 A. M.
I bought a " Telegraph " and a Kit Kat and then caught my train promptly at 9: 05 from Platform 2.
I was alone until Charing Cross, where I was met by my mother, who parked the car in the wrong area and got a ticket, as usual.
we know why you did it, how you did it, the whole lot.
Elizabeth has told us everything, eh?
I knew she was fucked in the head, but I didn't realize she was this vicious.
you know Liz hates me.
you do know that, don't you?
Liz: Thanks for taking me home.
I can't wait to get into my own bed.
you'll feel better once you get back into your old routine.
now, if you need anything, day or night, just call me, all right?
you can go back anytime you want.
I have to get back to the real world.
you said so yourself.
you really don't know anything, do you?
Liz and Frankie are best friends.
they're thick as thieves.
are you sure?
they're practically the same person.
boring, vain, shallow enough to paddle in.
but Liz is the really nasty one.
do you have a pen?
this is how it is at Brabourne.
to exist, you either have to be a bitch or a complete slut.
what is it?
amber dumped Mike half an hour ago.
Oh, fuck.
come on.
it's your big chance, what you've been waiting for.
Oh, my God. I'm going to be sick.
you need to quit, or you'll be auditioning with every peek-a-boo slut from London up.
I don't just want him.
I really want him, Frankie.
I've got a plan.
let's hear it.
we go to the beach, like last year, but this time, we camp out for a few days.
it'd be perfect. The sea air, the stars.
l hate beaches.
all that sand up your crack and nowhere to pee, apart from the ocean.
and it dries out the complexion.
I look 40 if I spend 10 minutes by the sea, and you want me to go there for a week?
remember that place we found and said it would be great for a party?
the S & M dungeon Martin tried to take you to.
precisely. What if we did that?
I could get Mike on his own for a few days, and we could even ask Geoff...
for you.
the four of us?
Yeah.
a private party. The end of term.
me, you, Mike, and Geoff.
dangerous place for a lady.
if you say so.
out. Neil, out.
she's not here for you.
couldn't have come at a better time, Frankie.
I'm ready if you are.
how would you like to go to the best private party of your life?
are you going?
it's my party.
how private?
you, me, Mike, and Liz.
Mike never mentioned it.
that's 'cause you're inviting him.
I don't know if I could do that.
it's for 3 days. Absolutely extracurricular.
your parents don't know, and the school doesn't know.
what we do will be our own business.
if you're too prissy, then I'll ask someone else.
I never said I wasn't interested.
in or out, Geoff?
in.
but you have to bring Mike.
I'll have a word with His Highness.
anything else?
put your knob away.
go.
Liz: Did you do it?
Yeah. Done.
it will be great.
please.
man, I'm telling you. This is different.
this is 10 out of 10.
Frankie and Liz. Real 10 out of 10.
you're gonna go home to an empty house and fuck the maid all Easter again?
you haven't seen the maid.
plus...
amber won't know where you are...
won't be able to find you.
she'll assume you're having a more exciting time with more famous people.
drive her nuts.
all right. I'm in.
martin: When you're convinced of your own superiority, you don't need help from mortals like me.
you can fuck things up all by yourself.
so there you have it.
l thank you.
what time did you lock them in the hole?
because I know you did it.
how dare you be this wrong and this fucking pigheaded?!
how dare you put my mother through this?
how do you know it was me?
I'm dying to know! Come on!
one is lying. I have to talk to her.
why wait when this girl can tell me what I need to know?
I understand, but if you start demanding things, she's likely to go back to that stony-silence bullshit.
l got us out of in the beginning.
that's a risk I have to take.
I've nothing on mine. In 12 hours, he walks.
if you say one word to her, I will kill you.
just let... I'll get the answers.
he's going to get away with it, isn't he?
no. You mustn't think like that.
did he ever keep a diary or journal or anything like that?
I don't think so.
and did he have any kind of secret hiding place?
I don't know.
Why?
what's wrong?
you're not going to let him out, are you?
I'm afraid that's not my decision.
he's gonna come after me! -No, he won't.
you're perfectly safe.
is he out now? -No, in a couple of hours.
hours?
is there anything else you remember?
you said I'd be safe. -You are safe.
I trusted you. I thought we were friends.
I told you everything!
you've been pretending, because you're paid to.
that's not true!
leave me alone!
martin: I can help you.
nice one.
you don't want to be found, do you?
Geoff, pass it up.
give it here. Come on.
you want it, you got it, baby.
so, who do you want first?
what are you talking about, Mikey?
I'm dancing. -Wrong approach, mate.
Frankie, I've got something for you.
Oh, fuck off, Geoffrey!
stop being such a fucking tourist.
I am not.
is there sex or not?
not.
and especially not with you.
yeah?
and especially not in here.
have you seen how dirty it is? -Yeah, I have.
and why would there be sex?
I mean, what have you done for me?
no, I don't think so.
sorry.
she's good, isn't she?
look, Frankie, we've had a lot of anticipation, and it's been medically proven that this kind of teasing can really ruin a young man's nuts.
fuck off! I have heard this before.
so you have to.
Aah! Shit!
Oh, no!
Yes!
I need some more.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm going first.
GEOFF: Come on, get it off. Come off.
Frankie: Oh, careful. [Laughing] It's expensive.
now, I've wanted to see this for the last four years.
I've had this. It's okay.
what, 7? 8 out of 10?
Mmm...4.
Oh, thank you! -Frankie!
we were what, 13?
it was a one-night stand. It wasn't exactly memorable.
it was a long time ago, and I'm a lot better now.
but you liked it.
what the fuck is wrong with you?!
you're a fucking nut job!
thank you. [Laughing]
that's it. No more free feels.
you must be joking. What am I meant to do with the old man?
suck it off.
Whoa! 10 out of 10! -What?
10 out of 10. -What? What did she do?
Oh, go on. Give us a look, Franks.
what did she do?
nothing, Geoff. Nothing.
Oh, come on, Frankie.
forget it. It's supposed to be a party.
a shit party, but it's a party nonetheless.
you always get to see everything.
I never get to see the good bits.
Frankie: Can't we have the light on?
Mike: No! I can't sleep if it's light out.
it's too dark to sleep.
how could it be too dark? Shut your eyes.
I can't tell when my eyes are closed, it's so dark.
[Gasps] Shit!
it's only me. It's only me.
can we get some sleep, please?!
shut up!
what are you doing?
turn the light off.
Tom: She must have spent days picking the lock, but did it.
she beat him, and I'll beat him, the little shit of a schoolboy.
he had a Website full of anarchist bullshit about disrupting stock exchanges, air-traffic control, the Web itself.
I'm gonna nail him.
I don't think he's angry enough to have done it.
Hi. -Thanks for meeting me.
no problem. Shall we go straight there?
it's not far. It's just up the hill.
I'm not great with small spaces.
neither am I. I can't stand them.
but that will be the least of your worries when you get there.
what were they doing here?
they were trying to have a good time.
they had plenty of booze.
they wired up some party lights.
the prime suspect has been released without charge.
the police have yet to make any formal statement.
and it is understood that their investigations are proceeding satisfactorily.
the families have requested that the press...
God.
but you can't go.
the trip doesn't get back for another two days.
GEOFF: Mate, you said you'd do this.
fuck the trip.
okay. Fuck things up for the rest of us.
you can forget that.
do something.
I'm not gonna tell anyone where you are.
please don't go. You'll ruin everything.
I'm not gonna stay here and listen to you two fuck each other's brains out.
no. I don't think so.
I'm trying.
I'm leaving, too.
Oh, not you as well.
I'm not playing desperate.
Frankie: I'm not staying down here. I think it's gross.
are you going straight home?
we could stop by the station and get a pizza. I'm starving.
no. Thanks, though.
come on. Trains go to London all the time.
Yeah. No, I know.
look, I'm gonna go by Amber's, see if I can patch things up.
it's been awful between us.
Amber? But she humiliated you.
how the fuck would you know anything about that?
enjoy yourselves. I'm out of here.
your weed, mate.
fuck!
mate, you said you'd do this. -You said it would be fun.
it is. -I know it is for you.
you guys are gonna have a great weekend.
you're gonna get laid. Enjoy this.
come on, Mike. Please stay.
look, you're gonna have a great time.
you'll be here by yourselves. Enjoy it, all right?
I hate him. -[Sighs]
what's up?
something's wrong. I can't open the door.
move it. Can you move out of the way?
watch this.
fuck! It won't open.
well, push it, you twat.
the handle's stuck. It won't budge.
you are such a donkey. Liz, down.
let me sort it out.
fuck!
you are such a cretin, Mike.
look! I'm not fucking retarded, okay?!
the door won't open!
Oh, get out of the way!
who was the last one down?
it was Geoff.
how fucking hard did you slam it?
it wasn't me. It was Liz.
it's a heavy door. It slammed itself.
doors don't just slam themselves locked, Liz.
I'm sorry. I didn't know we'd get stuck, did I?
this is bullshit!
you're sorry? That's just fucking great!
what do we do while you're sorry, or do we just fucking rot?
I guess we just... wait to be found.
in two days, my parents are gonna be there waiting for me.
if I'm not there, they're gonna know I never went on the field trip and that I told them a pack of lies!
that's a good point. My parents will go berserk.
good fucking job, asshole.
how long before we're found? -I don't know.
shit! I am in so much trouble!
perfect!
help!
anyone! Help!
fuck!
have you tried the glass?
there has to be something that might open the fucking door!
Jesus!
fucking bitch!
you fucking bitch!
are you all right?
why don't we sit down? -Thanks.
it's been a nightmare for forensics.
we can barely lift a usable print.
it's gonna take 6 months to sift through all the hair and fiber we lifted.
what about the listening devices?
the kids probably mistook the small air vents for microphones.
lack of food and water would have made them totally confused and paranoid.
so, do you have anything to tie Martin Taylor to the scene?
not yet.
but he would have left something somewhere.
and we'll find it.
right.
Thanks. -Okay.
open the door!
you bitch! Open the door!
Aah! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
bullshit!
bullshit! -I'm sorry!
how could you do this to me?
you betrayed me! You fucking betrayed me!
No!
they let you go. I knew they would.
they've tapped my phone, follow me, and won't leave me alone!
they want me for the whole thing!
they can't prove anything!
if they could, they would have done by now.
you grassed me up, you bitch!
what happened?
you gotta get me out of here. Please. I don't feel safe.
I don't want to be alone. -All right.
I don't feel safe.
all right, all right.
please. -Liz, come on.
take me. -Calm down, all right?
take a deep breath. Come on, calm down.
listen, I can help you, but you've got to stop playing games.
there are people that need to know what happened.
they don't care how terrible your story is.
all that matters to them is knowing the truth.
I want to know the truth, too.
I want to go back to the hole.
absolutely not. No way.
I keep getting glimpses of what happened.
I'll be doing something like tying my laces, and I'll turn around, and I'll see Frankie.
but when I try to remember, I can't.
there's nothing. Nothing at all.
and I don't know what happened.
and I want to know, and I can't remember.
do you want to be readmitted, and we can work through this?
no.
I need to go back to the hole.
there's no escape.
Mrs. Dunn called again, moaning Dr. Horwood's run away with her child.
threatening to call the press, police complaints commission if we don't get off our arses and find her.
all right.
but I'll bet you they're having a pizza somewhere.
do you want the rest?
go on. Amaze me.
I will. It's about Martin Taylor.
come on.
come on.
looks different.
don't even feel as if I've been here before.
your weed, mate. -Fuck.
you're a pretty...
dude, you're getting laid. It's gonna be a great time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
we weren't locked in from the outside.
shit! I am in so much trouble!
fuck! Shit! I don't believe it!
son of a bitch!
did you try the glass?
Liz: What could I do?
I couldn't let him leave.
carry on.
guys, guys. The water's gone off.
are you sure?
I went for a drink, and there's no water.
what?
what?
what? What's happened?
after you start to feel thirsty, you find yourself feeling impatient.
maybe even a little sick.
then your pulse starts to go up.
then it's the headaches, dizziness.
when it gets bad, your vision will blur, and you'll find it hard to walk and talk.
your tongue swells up.
your skin shrivels.
twitch.
you go deaf.
and then you die.
how long does this take?
from when we run out of water, about three or four days.
how do you know all this?
army cadet.
Lizzie, it's gonna be fine.
it's gonna be okay, Liz.
I mean, we're bound to get rescued.
God, they'll find us. They will find us.
next week, we'll be down the pub, and we'll be having a laugh.
I promise you.
and I'm buying, all right?
it's gonna be all right.
we'll go out and buy lots of new things.
there's all of those exciting exams to look forward to.
can we look on the positive side?
no, I've got a hard-on for those exams. They're great.
you got a hard-on for everything.
not for you, mate.
I'm okay.
Liz: Have you ever loved someone so much that you...
didn't care what happened to yourself?
you just had to be with them.
if they look at you, your heart stops.
if you feel their breath on your skin, you just ache.
have you ever craved someone so much that you didn't exist anymore?
no.
well, I have.
guys!
Hey, guys!
guys! Liz!
[Music stops] -Frankie's sick.
look, I'm serious. She's very sick.
it just keeps coming out of her.
Oh, so you're fucking her now.
you know, he really doesn't kiss the way I thought he would.
I always thought he'd kiss me really soft, but...
