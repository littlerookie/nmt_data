cnooc and sinopec reported this week that net profits last year were up 29 per cent and 2 per cent respectively, both hitting record highs.
cnooc came back to the united states in recent months as well with joint venture investments in chesapeake energy corp shale projects.
cnooc chairman wang yilin said it was "normal" for the canadian government to extend its review, adding that he expects the deal to be completed by year-end.
cnooc did a similar deal with chesapeake in october for a stake in a shale oil and gas project in texas.
cnooc emerges from this episode with question marks over its credibility.
cnooc expects the deepwater akpo field to begin production by late 2008, and to have a peak output of 175000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.
cnooc fits the classic mould of a large state-owned enterprise seeking to secure natural resources.
cnooc had already promised to list in toronto, retain nexen staff and move its north american headquarters to calgary.
cnooc has acquired more canadian assets since, culminating in last year's purchase of the bankrupt oil sands producer opti canada.
cnooc has also agreed to buy 5% of bg's interests in certain coal-seam gas tenements in queensland's surat basin.
cnooc has been investing aggressively in unconventional oil and gas deposits in north america, signing two multibillion-dollar shale oil deals with chesapeake energy of oklahoma during the past year.
cnooc has set a target to grow its oil-and-gas output by between 6% and 10% annually between 2011 and 2015.
cnooc has showered ottawa with love-bombs to ensure that the deal is a "net benefit" to canada.
cnooc has spoken in the past about the enormous potential of deepwater south china sea, but what the company is doing now is exploration.
cnooc has structured the nexen deal in a way that seeks to maximise its appeal to canadian regulators.
cnooc is braving insecurity and political uncertainty as an insurgency against the interim government continues in mogadishu, the capital.
cnooc is state-controlled, but making calgary its north american hub would give some independence to that part of the business.
cnooc launched its first deep-sea drilling project in the south china sea last month, following domestic pressure on beijing to uphold its territorial claims.
cnooc ltd is cnooc's flagship branch company listed on the new york stock exchange and the stock exchange of hong kong limited.

cnooc's cash offer of$ 27.50 a share represents a 61 per cent premium to nexen's friday closing price in new york.
cnooc's liuhua field, which stopped production after it was damaged by a typhoon last year, resumed production well ahead of schedule in june.
cnooc's opportunities to grow reserves and production domestically are largely limited to the offshore, so it's not surprising that the company is eying the south china sea.
cnooc's plans to deploy its new deepwater rig--hysy 981--to its current location were obviously made prior to the recent flare up between china and the philippines.
cnooc's reserve life at current production levels does not give it that luxury.

cnooc, the chinese offshore oil and gas producer, yesterday said it was unable to capitalise on higher global oil prices in the third quarter as revenues dipped on lower crude oil sales volume.
cnooc, the country's largest offshore producer, inked two deals to develop shale oilfields in the us jointly with chesapeake energy late last year and early this year.
cnooc, which said it respects the decision, nonetheless contends the deposit arrangements are safeguarded by checks and balances and benefit the company and shareholders.
