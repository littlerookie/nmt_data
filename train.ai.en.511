the boj began doing quantitative easing in 2001.
the boj believes that a big cause of japan's persistent deflation is the economy's low potential growth rate and low productivity, which quantitative easing fails to solve.
the boj can start by being more assertive.
the boj can start by being more assertive.
the boj chief told reporters today that cash injections will "continue as needed."
the boj could theoretically buy more government bonds, if it waived its own law limiting purchases to the amount of banknotes in circulation.
the boj engaged in three rounds of qe last year, but the yen kept strengthening.
the boj has made up to y3 trillion available to commercial banks at a rock-bottom 0.1% interest rate.
the boj has said it would review its price goal at a meeting of its policy board next month.
the boj has sold the currency four times since late 2010, under orders from the finance ministry.
the boj hates how low rates encourage the yen-carry trade; it wants to "normalize" rates, i.e., narrow the gap between japan's rates and those of other industrialized countries; and it wants to send a signal to markets that it won't tolerate inflation.
the boj is essentially printing money, a process known as quantitative easing, to flood the japanese financial markets with excess cash to stabilize the economy.
the boj is expected to forecast near-flat growth in gross domestic product for the fiscal year ending in march 2012.
the boj is likely to find itself under pressure to hit an inflation rate of 2 per cent rather than the current 1 per cent objective, bringing it into line with central banks elsewhere.
the boj is seeking 'to avoid future risks of a drop in stock prices that may shrink bank lending activity,' gov. masaaki shirakawa said at a news conference.
the boj is under intense pressure to act after the yen soared to y85 to the dollar, threatening the recovery in japan's exports.
the boj said it would increase the size of its asset-purchasing programme to a total of y80tn ($ 1.02tn) by buying another y10tn of government bonds, with the deadline for those purchases pushed back from june 2013 to the end of 2013.
the boj upgraded its assessment of the economy for the third straight month but warned that the pace of recovery would remain slow until at least the middle of 2010.
the boj was given independence from the finance ministry in the late 1990s.
the boj's discomfort explains why, on tuesday december 1st, it made what analysts considered to be a half-hearted attempt to reflate the japanese economy and weaken the yen.
the boj's foray into qe in 2001 quickly cut short-term rates to zero and is generally thought to have had a small but meaningful downward impact on medium-and long-run interest rates.
the boj's foray into qe in 2001 quickly cut short-term rates to zero and is generally thought to have had a small but meaningful downward impact on medium-and long-run interest rates.
the boj's injection helped pull yields on the country's sovereign debt sharply lower.
the boj's mr nishimura ventures that the downward pressure on prices may be exacerbated by ageing in countries like russia and china, whose entry into the global economy helped fuel the world's recent asset-price boom.
the boj's timorous monetary framework is one reason behind japan's prolonged deflation.
