the intended victim.
we have DNA, Vincent.
skin under Harold Claven's nails,
they're gonna match to you, aren't they?
your brother-in-law.
you killed him, Vincent.
he was dangerous.
to who? You?
to Vivian.
Harold's wife.
and my sister.
I appreciate it.
he was beating her.
so I beat him.
and you beat Kia Rowe.
she didn't do a thing to you.
except catch you by surprise.
wrong place, wrong time, wasn't it?
this is for my sister!
ten nights in a row I watched that tram.
it was always empty on the last run.
she shouldn't have been there.
it was an accident.
something's not right.
Vivian didn't cry.
her husband had just been murdered.
she was as calm as could be.
then I thought she was in shock.
now I know she wasn't.
should I even ask how it's coming?
you can now,'cause it appears that wool is used for everything.
towels, gloves, clothes, hats...
and very frequently, carpets.
I'm sensing you found the connection.
after 12 manua and 16 phone calls to auto mafacturers,
I concluded that our mystery gray fiber isn't even gray.
it's dove. Okay?
that is the new interiorolor option on the 2006 Jaguar XKR.
only been available a few months.
you hit up DMV for a list of registered Jags that fit the criteria?
as we speak.
come on.
boom. - There's a name I recognize.
I'll calahead, make a reservation.
one fiber, from a car that hundreds of other people probably also own?
I hardly think that's enough to indict me for murder.
doesn't matter what you think, because we think you killed FreBayliss, put him in the trunk of your car, then transferred a fiber to the fish when you went back to clean up.
then dumped the body under Bruckner Boulevard.
we saw trace amounts of blood on your car-- it was in plain view.
I'm calling my lawyer.
I'm sure he'll confirm that the interesting thing about circumstantial evince is that you add enough of it together, makes for a very song case.
and what possible reason would I have to kill Fred Bayliss?
we think it was about money.
that's ridiculous.
I have plenty of money. I don't need any more.
no, we don't doubt that.
anybody who flies in sand from his beach house in Hawaii for privileged four-year-olds is definitely in a league of his own.
hell of a gift, but I found it quite odd that you donate a six-figure sandbox to a school your own son doesn't even attend.
my son was not accepted.
we know. But Fred's was. - Yes, because of me-- I did Fred a favor.
wrote a letter, gave his kid a recommendation.
which I'm sure you thought was a win-win situation
put a good word in for his son, he's indebted to you forever.
you come out looking like a prince, 'cause never in a million years did you think his kid would get accepted.
so helping Fred doesn't affect you one way or the other.
but no good deed go unpunished. That favor came back to bite you, didn't it?
his son got in;your son... didn't
even after you lavished e school with your expensive sandbox.
my son deserved to be chosen. Not his.
20 kids this year were accepted.
any one of them could've taken youson's spot.
so why was Fred the recipient of all your anger? What did he do to you?
we do business together.
okay? Fred sells me fish.
that's where we mix.
he lives in his world; I live in mine.
we have different rules, expectations.
he didn't understand that. - Meaning an elite presool is not the place for the son of a middle-class fisherman.
you can't afford that school-- your son doesn't belong there.
Why? Because it embarrasses you?
get out of my face!
put your hands behind your back.
he's just gonna get a high-priced lawyer that'll plead he only wanted what was best for his son.
I know. That's a right-- when he does, I'll be there to testify that Fred Bayliss wanted exactly the same thing.
I'd prefer to keep them on.
I wasn't asking, Mrs. Claven.
take them off.
nasty bruise. What caused it?
not what-- who.
my husband Harold, he punched me.
did you know bruises age in a specific pattern?
first they're red color of the blood under the skin.
after a day or two, they turn a bluish purple.
that fades to green.
and then as they heal, they turn a yellowish brown.
yours is just black.
too black.
wipe it off.
you tricked your brother into killing your husband.
I had no other choice.
what about divorce?
Oh, and lose his pension?
so you took th"death gamble.
right? Isn't that what they call it?
city eloyee dies, spouse is entitled to two-thirds of his pensionable salary?
catch is, he had to die on the job.
otherwise you got nothing.
he drove that tram a long time, and you were never gonna let him retire.
that was my nest egg.
enough to make my horribe life worthwhile.
well, you might have hated your life, Mrs. Claven, but Kia Rowe loved hers, and you took that from her.
new girl's good.
she stands her ground.
she'll fit in well.
watch your backs.
coming through.
move it, move it.
...1010, possible hijack of a medical helicopter, last seen departing hope morial hospital helipad.
delta two responding.
we got a guy down in here, Dan.
Flack, he's alive.
let's get an ambulance out here.
looks like it's just this guy, though, and nothing else.
it's not what I wanted to hear.
search the area, set up a perimeter, and call canine.
we're trying to locate the guy with the key to this scissor lift.
they hung the billboard yesterday.
left the equipment here overnight.
looks like he slammed into the billboard and bounced off the light fixture before he finally landed.
hole in the fabric of his scrubs.
Arearound it is saturated with blood.
guess the guy either works at a hospital or medical center, huh?
gunshot victim.
lividity.
head and arms is pinkish purple.
I'd say this guy's been here a couple of hours.
that'd put him here about 4: 00 o'clock in the morning.
so far tre's nothing to indicate that he was thrown out of one of the windows or off the top of the building.
he wasn't.
air traffic control reported a hijacked medical aircraft, intern and pilot on board.
I think our vic was thrown from a helicopter.
Hey, Mac, we found, the, uh, helicopter.
pilot's alive, but he's unconscious.
I heard a rumor that you found our intern, Ryan Elliot .
Yeah. He's on his way to autopsy now.
did you happen to find anything else?
well, you want to give me a hint exactly you're looking for, Flack?
an igloo cooler with a human liver inside.
so, this wasn't about hijacking a helicopter.
it was about stealing a donor organ.
first business at hand.
prints.
that should help confirm the I. D.On the vic.
hmm.
he was shot only once.
it was a through and through.
very clean, very straight wound.
the bullet moved through the flesh quite easily.
it appears he was trying to turn away.
that slight movement resulted in the tearing of the right ventricle, leading to significant internal bleeding.
our cause of death.
exactly.
size of the permanent wound cavity suggests that the bullet didn't mushroom, so it was some kind of jacketed round.
find that bullet, and it might lead you to your shooter.
Mr. Cooper?
uh, new trench coat.
got it dirtylready.
hmm.
sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Detective Bonasera.
this is Detective Monroe.
can we get you anything?
coffee, water?
no, I'm good, thank you.
Mr. Cooper, we'd like you to tell us everything you know about Lillian Stanwick.
and more importantly, all the details of your last conversation with her.
I tried to explain this to the officers that called me.
I don't know a Lillian Stanwick.
Really?
I checked my client list...
several times.
well, you are an architect.
I'm sure you meet lots of people.
it's hard to keep track.
it's hard to remember.
I never met her.
this is a photo from her driver's license.
I don't know this woman.
it's awfully noisy in here.
let's take this conversation someplace quiet.
detectives, I'm very sorry this woman is dead, but I can't help you.
it'll only take a minute.
keep moving!
Ah, man...!
right through here. Come on. -I didn't do nothing.
this is your business card, right?
looks like it.
we found it in Lillian Stanwick's purse.
dusted it for prints.
what you see here is actually the negative impression of the pattern of the friction ridge on your finger and hers.
see, the prints on the edge of the card belong to our victim.
we confirmed that by printing her corpse.
you handed this card to Lillian Stanwick.
you held it between your middle and index finger, like a clothes pin, and she grabbed it with her index finger and thumb.
you're assuming those prints are mine.
obviously, someone else gave her my business card.
maybe, but can you explain to us why the last phone call she made before she was murdered was to you?
what?
we ran her phone records.
you spoke to Lillian Stanwick for seven minutes last night.
doesn't sound like she dialed the wrong number.
three days ago, you spoke to her for 15.
the week before thatï¼Œ 12 minutes on tuesday, and 22 minutes on friday.
still don't know who she is, Charles?
this is how I first saw her, and I can't forget her.
she's only 22 years old.
see how the spoke from the wheel pierced her neck, Charles?
I'm not answering any more of your questions.
I'm leaving.
wait a second.
a few minutes ago, you didn't know who she was, and suddenly you're in a hurry?
didn't you like our pictures, Charles?
I was told the helicopter was on the roof.
Mr. Rice had been wheeled into pre-op, and ten minutes later,
I was told we weren't getting the liver.
it had been hijacked.
it was shocking.
doctor, do you know this young man?
no, I don't.
he signed for the liver at the donor hospital.
he must be an organ courier.
he works at the other hospital, where the organ was taken from the donor.
it's rare that I meet them.
I'm usually in surgery.
it's proper procedure for a courier to deliver the cooler?
well, it varies. More often than not,
I pick up the donor liver myself.
in other cases,
I've had the pilot of the helicopter walk it right into E. R.
last night, you didn't pick it up? Why not?
my first concern was mr. Rice's ability to undergo major surgery.
I needed to be here.
thank you.
other than your staff, the transplant staff at the donor hospital and air traffic control, who else would know that helicopter was carrying a liver?
well, ifou're considering suspects, detective, the list is endless.
if the donor was a victim of something like an accident, anyone at that scene could assume or possibly know that his organs would be harvested.
our patients and their families wait for a very long time to be selected for a transplant.
their only hope is that someone will step up and volunteer or someone young and healthy who's agreed to donate their organs dies.
they're desperate.
desperate enough to kill for an organ that could be incompatible?
I wish I could point you in the right direction, detective, I really do...
because that liver is only viable for another 12 hours, and my patient may not live that longï¼Œpilot radioed atc from here when he landed and again when he took off.
his destination was the 34th street helipad which is just across the river from where we found the helicopter.
so the flight path didn't appear off course on atc radar.
When'd they know the helicopter was hijacked?
15 minutes after it took off from here.
the pilot was able to enter into a different frequency, which alerted air traffic control that the aircraft had been hijacked.
get a chance to talk to the pilot?
Yeah, I did. He's still a bit rattled.
not too helpful with a description.
he said there were two guys.
one guy held a gun to his head.
looks like blood to me here, boss.
the pattern looks like it's consistent with the vic's gunshot wounds.
so he was shot here.
stop! Don't move!
put the case down now, now!
he turned for some reason.
bullet sliced through his flesh.
fell there.
Yeah. We got lood.
Where's the bullet?
our bad guys pick it up?
couldn't have known the shot was a through-and-through.
the bullet bounced there...
and fell over the edge.
I see something shiny right there, Mac, but I can't tell if it's a bullet, though.
let's find out.
how we going to get it out here?
the midtown fisherman.
A-ha! Gotcha.
that's quite t contraption.
Yeah, it's my own invention.
you got to use real bubble gum.
none of that sugarless stuff.
in the wintertime, I use peanut butter.
gum gets too cold, freezes up.
Hey, I was wondering...
ha! Hold on a sec. I'm working here.
it's got to be a dime.
you can't really tell till you get it up and out into the daylight.
you-you know, I actually pulled a diamond ring out of here two days ago.
Mr. Fisherman, we're in a hurry.
do me a favor: Let us borrow your gadget.
no. Get your own.
please?
you see that?
a little politeness goes a long way.
just... ju, um, take your time, relax.
that's it. That's it.
visualize.
become one with the gum.
okay, that's it.
on the average, how much you make a day, fisherman?
uh, on a good day,$30, maybe $40.
get out of here.
Hey, it's not like I don't work for it.
got it.
Hey, Mac.
are we sure the name on the helicopter manifest was Ryan Elliot ?
Yeah. Signature was also on the paperwork.
signed out at havenview hospital, picked up the cooler and boarded a helicopter headed for hope memorial.
well, I ran our vic's prints to confirm I. D.
Evy medical employee in the state of new york is printed and in a database.
the body we found dangling from that scissor lift was a pediatrics intern named Sean Hovac.
then where is Ryan Elliot ?
why didn't you check in, Ryan?
I never do.
if the hospital needs me, they call me.
I get two days off every nine days.
that time is mine.
you always go out of town?
no, I don't.
you know they're selling organs in China on the internet?
I hear you can make quite a bit of money.
what's the going rate for a liver these days, Ryan?
I had nothing to do with what happened.
my friend was murdered.
a whole bunch of people on the donor recipients' list are running out of time.
if someone was really desperate, they'd pay just about anything for an organ, wouldn't they?
this is crazy.
it's totally crazy.
maybe you knew what the plan was all along and at the last minute got cold feet, huh?
tell us what you know, Ryan.
if Sean was really your friend, you'd want us to get these guys.
there's a man dying right now, and he needs that liver.
you've got one death on your hands.
don't make it two.
I am not involved.
look, I'm going to tell you my story one more time.
my roommate called.
he had knicks tickets on the floor.
I was done with my shift at the hospital and on my way out when the request for the organ courier came in.
there's nothing to it.
it's just a helicopter ride, Sean.
I already signed all the paperwork.
just make this delivery.
nobody's going to ask any questions, and they certainly won't know you're not me.
what if I get caught?
doing what, saving a life?
they don't care who delivers this liver as long as it gets there.
you're cool, right?
Thanks, man. I owe you one.
if I hadn't gone to that game...
it would've been my body you found out there and not Sean's.
simple as that.
captivating, isn't she?
something about her makes me feel so vulnerable.
she had a blood alcohol level just above legal.
I sent a sexual assault kit to DNA.
there was evidence of intercourse.
she was raped?
well, no defensive wounds or vaginal tears.
no signs of a struggle that just means she didn't fight back.
doesn't mean she consented.
there is a possibility she was unconscious.
cause of death was arterial subdural hemorrhage.
very rare.
all arachnoidal artery in the brain is sheared.
the result of a grazing blow to the head.
the bleeng is more rapid and therefore more lethal than the usual subdural hemorrhage.
she definitely passed out.
I dusted the bike wheel for prints.
there s no sign that she had been struck by it.
I guess it's a viable possibility that she fell on top of it.
this isn't adding up.
no struggle, no defensive wounds.
there were no sis at the scene that she had been dragged there or forced.
what was Lillian Stanwick doing in that tunnel?
look, this is the second time I've had to call.
he was supposed to finish painting today, but he didn't show up.
look, you know, I have tenants moving in next week.
No! Are you stening to me?!
I need the painting completed now!
no, last time I checked, it wasn't my job to hunt down your employees.
can't you do your job?!
for crying out loud!
very nice.
Ryan Elliot swears he's not involved.
and you believe him?
Yeah, I do.
money's a powerful motive, Hawkes.
I know, I know, but my gut tells me he's a victim in all this.
you don't spend all that time going to medical school, then mess it all up.
I had nothing to do with what happened.
my friend was murdered.
did Danny get anything from the prints he found inside the helicopter?
no, not a thing.
what about Sean Hovac's clothing?
pe lifted. No foreign trace.
the guys that did this aren't rookies.
they had to know what they were doing, have access to not only the hospital but the roof.
and somebody on the inside had to let them know there waan organ about to be delivered.
well, they murdered Sean Hovac...
...but not Jeb Clayton, the pilot.
maybe the duct tape and head injury were all a ruse and he was in on it.
they needed someone to fly the helicopter, right?
Sean may have been an unexpected casualty.
killing someone wasn't part of the plan.
tracked down the match you got from the bullet.
came from a gun that was used to rob a dry cleaners on the upper east side about a week ago.
you have a suspect?
in custody-- Angie Watson.
but we never recovered the gun.
wasn't on her when she was arrested fleeing the scene.
sounds like we need to have a little talk with miss Watson, see if she remembers where she lost it.
you have very beautiful eyes, you know that?
thank you.
now, why don't you tell me about the night you got collared.
you got a girlfriend?
who'd you give the gun to, Angie?
I've been here before.
some cop or D. A. Gets me to tell them what they need to know, makes a lot of promises on how they're gonna get me out.
a week later, I'm still here in the same kind of trouble.
I was in before I said anything.
we'll wo something out.
would these eyes lie?
I had just left the dry cleaners.
I took off down 64th and maybe halfway down the block,
I tossed the gun in the garbage can.
lot of garbage cans on 64th street.
row of brownstones, gold-plated doorbells, lots of flowers on planters around trees, two red bikes chained together, silver garbage can with a lid.
you had to be moving pretty fast.
and you managed to remember all those details.
or maybe you needed to remember exactly where you tossed it, so you could call your friends and tell them where to pick it up.
who has the gun?
are you kidding me?
I didn't waste my one phone call on those knuckleheads.
they're the reason why I'm here now.
if I was you,
I'd check with the guys at sanitation.
but that's just me.
was the can full or empty?
I remember the sound of the gun hitting the bottom.
no dna results yet.
vaginal samples from Lillian Stanwick's rape kit suggests two profiles other than her own.
so she had intercourse twice that night
possibly once with Charles Cooper and then somebody else.
she know all these people?
all these men.
not one of these cards belongs to a woman.
so maybe she's some kind of a high-end call girl.
I don't think so.
she didn't live her life like that, and I found a pay stub at her apartment.
she was working as a hostess at that trendy restaurant called majorca.
well, you can pick up a lot of business cards at a job like that.
Mm-hmm.
but then, why wouldn't Charles Cooper admit that he gave her the card at the restaurant.
what's the crime in that?
he didn't remember it.
Stella, Lillian Stanwick is hard to forget.
true.
so let's focus on our second guy.
I've narrowed our playing field a bit.
according to her phone records, she spoke to these eight men several times in the past six months.
eliminates all these.
see, what I don't understand is,
I checked her incoming calls, and none of these guys have ever placed a call to lillian, including Charles Cooper.
so she was stalking them?
I thought about that.
but why would you stay on the phone for 20 or 30 minutes with someone who's stalking you?
right.
so now we have nine suspects, including Charles Cooper.
no, actually, we have three.
see, these two were out of town at the time of the murder.
these three have alibis.
and this one, this guy died of natural causes.
he was 87 years old.
leaves us with Charles Cooper, architect, Will graham, veterinarian, and Dwayne Gessner, attorney.
so all we have to do is put one of these three in that alley.
I know Lillian Stanwick, but I've never met her.
I'm not sure exactly how to explain it.
sounds complicated.
why don't you take a deep breath and give it a try.
three months ago, I got a telephone call.
it was a woman.
and she said... -your cat's in my garden.
I don't have a cat;
I told her that.
but she continued to suggest that I did.
why didn't you just hang up?
I don't know.
I don't remember exactly why the conversation continued past that point, but I think we talked ten minutes that first time.
then she called two days later, and she said it.
your cat's in my garden.
couldn't hang up the phone.
we talked 15, 20 minutes.
come on, Will, all that time on the phone, more than one call.
she didn't tell you her name?
no.
I find that hard to believe, Dwayne.
look, I asked several times.
all she ever said was... -what would you like my name to be?
after the first few calls,
I figured it was some unspoken rule.
I was afraid that...
if I pressed it, she'd stop calling.
every time I picked up the phone and said "hello,"
I'd pray the voice on the other side would say...
your cat is in my garden.
what would you two talk about?
me.
I told her things I've never told anyone.
so you'd stay on the phone for 20 minutes at a time for, what, therapy?
okay, yeah, it got sexual.
it was phone sex.
and she was good at it.
she knew what to say.
must have been really hot.
you must have wanted to meet her.
no.
I'm a married man.
I wouldn't cheat on my wife.
in fact, my sex life with my wife was pretty much nonexistent until she started calling.
did you tell anybody?
I was embarrassed.
I was obsessed with some mystery woman on the phone.
if more than three days went by,
I would panic, thinking she was never gonna call again.
do you know how she got your number, Dwayne?
no.
she said... -you gave it to me.
don't you remember?
but I didn't.
I'm pretty good at remembering things like that.
did you ever eat at majorca's?
all the time.
Why?
she work there?
the hostess.
I didn't notice her.
always just phone calls?
just phone calls.
and you were never in that tunnel?
can I look at your coat, Charles?
there it is.
I've seen this before.
you were brushing off this section of your coat when I met you.
just as I thought.
huh.
see, leaves are like fingerprints.
no two are alike.
you were in that tunnel, Charles Cooper.
care to change your story?
okay. All right.
I got fed up with just the phone calls, I wanted more.
Mm-hmm.
I told her to meet me somewhere, anywhere.
ninth street spillway tunnel--how romantic.
she picked it.
close your eyes.
if you open them, I'll leave.
you didn't even look at her?
I stole glimpses.
I didn't want her to go.
I didn't want it to stop.
finally, it did, and I took off.
and I swear to you, she was alive when I left.
you know what?
maybe in all this passion, you just got carried away.
slammed her head against the concrete and left her there unconscious to die.
does that sound about right?
no. No, it doesn't.
Charles, I think it's time for you to get an attorney.
okay, okay. Sorry.
I'll leave you alone.
uh!
very attractive.
the DNA sample from the sex kit of our vic, Lillian Stanwick,"it's a complex mixture of multiple donors."
well, I suggest that you just kick back and relax.
it's going to take Adam quite a while to isolate the priles.
have you ever gotten an anonymous phone call from a woman?
sure. It's happened.
does it turn you on?
Whoa!
slow down there, Montana.
What'd you have in mind?
our vic was having relationships with over 20 men.
all on the phone.
sounds like an addiction.
these guys were really hooked.
and she was just a voice.
they knew nothing about her, not even what she looked like.
this's a fantasy.
uncomplicated means of sexual arousal.
you get a little somethin'-somethin'
you don't have to pay for dinner.
how can anybody be satisfied with just that?
I find it hard to believe that one of these guys is not our killer-slash-rapist.
phone sex doesn't fit the profile of a rapist.
because rape is about control, not sex?
right. And your vic was the one initiating the phone calls, right?
okay, so she was in control, not these guys.
so it's a possibility that Lillian Stanwick was raped by a total stranger.
possible.
that's what I'm talking about.
all right, we got a hit.
that's from a xenon headlight.
it's covered with the same series of numbers.
tiny discs are sprayed onto the lens of the headlamps in the form of a liquid adhesive.
Datadot technology.
every disc is laser etched with an I. D. Number.
certain car dealerships started adding datadots to headlights because they were being stolen so often.
this isn't just any number.
it's the vehicle identification number of a mercedes benz.
our getaway car was a mercedes e-55 registered to dr. Jennifer goss, 525 64th street.
upper east side.
I'm catching this one.
row of brownstones.
two red bikes chained together.
silver garbage can with a lid.
gold-plated doorbells.
lots of flowers and planters around trees.
it's okay.
it'll be okay, I promise.
I love you.
this is our address.
get out of the way!
look out!
don't move.
don't even think about it.
you've got to let me go.
the men I hired.
they're holding the liver hostage.
they've asked for a ransom or they'll destroy it.
please. Please.
please help me.
my wife will die.
Dr. Beaumont, you have the right to remain silent.
use it.
whoa.
how you doing?
what? What happened?
Adam finished the DNA profile.
one is a match to Charles Cooper.
so he's our guy?
no.
once he separated the profiles and analyzed the peak heights, he determined that Charles Cooper's semen was more degraded than the other sample.
which means Charles was first to have intercourse with her, not the last.
we can't put our other two guys in the tunnel.
so, we still have a second, unknown male.
we're back to where we started.
no.
there was a match in the database to the second profile.
I can't believe it.
son of a bitch is back.
we did everything right 18 months ago, and this guy was acquitted because she wouldn't testify.
and now Regina Moore is asking for a miracle based on paint thinner and gut instinct.
did he do it?
without a doubt.
D. J. Prattas painting this apartment.
he attacked Lillian Stanwick, and that's why he didn't show up for work.
I should have put it all together.
Stella, you couldn't have known.
no, it's pratt's M. O.
he paints apartments.
that's when he chooses his prey, and then he stalks them.
he watched Lillian Stanwick come and go.
and then he followed her.
and he watched her and Charles Cooper in that tunnel.
he waited for Cooper to leave...
who's there?
...and then he raped her.
Oh, please god...
get off of me.
let go of me.
at the hospital, when you said there was a life you needed to save, you weren't talking about Ed Rice.
I'm a transplant surgeon, detective.
there should be no reason that I can't save my own wife.
you know what stands in the way?
a list.
my wife has to wait until her name is at the top of the list.
and you don't like that rule.
no, I don't.
I've saved so many other lives,
I shouldn't have to wait.
you've got to find that liver, and you, uh, you got to get it to Jennifer.
that was your plan.
you knew a liver that was compatible with mr. Rice's would be a match to your wife, so you hired those thugs to hijack the helicopter.
I thought of a thousand ways to do it diffently, detective.
but sometimes you get a sign.
you know, it's a...
an opportunity presents itself.
I know a lot of people, detective.
a lot of people owe me favors.
if I provide the gun and the vehicle and the cash, it would be taken care of.
Dr. Steiner to icu.
Dr. Steiner to icu.
this kid lost his life.
no one was supposed to get hurt.
but he did, and things got complicated, so they held the liver for more money.
and suddenly, whose life are you saving now?
what about Ed Rice?
top of the recipients' list.
liver was a perfect match, and he's been waiting for over a year and a half.
he didn't deserve that organ.
he's an alcoholic.
he chose to destroy his body, disrespect something that is so precious.
and you decide who lives and who dies?
I just wanted to save Jennifer.
I wanted my wife to live.
now you've left her to die alone.
you know you had something, dr. Beaumont, something that some of us who've suddenly lost a loved one never had time.
time to make the most of what was left.
that's what's precious.
Hey.
how'd it go?
DNA came through with a positive I. D. On a suspect.
well, that's good, right?
it's D. J. Prattï¼Œ Aiden's rape suspect.
we lock him up?
no.
the only thing we could prove is that he had sexual intercourse with our vic.
that's not good enough, Stella.
I promised Aiden we'd get him.
just do me a favor, huh?
catch this guy for Regina.
I will.
this folder...
will be right here on my desk till we get him.
I'm not breaking that promise.
we're taking D. J. Pratt down for murder.
look out! Get out of the way! Move!
hold on!
here we go. Stop! Hold on!
son of a bitch!
later, day trader! - Maybe next time!
wear your water wings!
Oh, my god.
I need a little more slack. Give me a little more.
all right, that's good.
all right!
mac, are you seeing this?
Yeah.
a mermaid, why not?
no throwing this one back.
this one's a keeper.
I thought the mermaid parade wasn't for another month.
the what? - Mermaid parade.
the annual whacko-fest held every june down in coney island. Kicks off the summer.
got a homicide on 88th and columbus.
Lindsay, you and danny stay with the body. Let us know if you need anything.
you see a view like this?
huh? Beats the wheat fields, no?
have you ever even seen a wheat field?
what's to see? It's just wheat.
that's not pretty. What do we got?
single gunshot wound to the eye.
how you holding up?
I'm okay.
this type of precision, I'm guessing close range.
bottom of the stairs, maybe.
I'd say the shooter was waiting for him. But where?
as far as the neighbors know, mark jeffries was a model citizen.
normal job, normal guy, helped old ladies with their packages.
I'll check to see if he was a boy scout, too.
any witnesses?
not a lot of pedestrian traffic up here, mac.
that's my husband! That's mark!
Oh, my god, it's mark!
slow down, ma'am. - That's my husband.
whoa, whoa, whoa! - That man is my husband!
Oh, god.
I hate that part. It's like being back in the morgue again.
take a deep breath.
it's hard to walk up and see that.
No!
No! That's my husband! What happened to mark?!
let me through. Let me through.
what happened?!
it's okay, baby. Shh, it's okay. It's okay.
well, I think that answers the boy scout question.
there's no trace under her fingernails.
doesn't look like she was in the water long.
seaweed could have kept her from being completely submerged.
no obvious signs of blunt or sharp force trauma.
petechial hemorrhaging.
she was strangled. - Yeah.
so whoever did this, did it the old fashioned way
with his bare hands.
I'm gonna go see if someone filed a missing persons.
you can handle the rest without me? -Yeah.
we're a committed threesome.
and how exactly does that work?
well, you know how most couples are monogamous? We're trinogamous.
Trinogamous?
Yeah. We act like a married couple, only there's three of us.
so you all live here together?
and sleep together and have sex together.
all the normal things.
and how long have you been in this committed threesome?
a year and a half, formally.
formally?
we had a commitment ceremony.
I now pronounce you husband and wife...
and wife.
where were you coming from when you arrived at home this morning?
I had breakfast with a friend
and where was laura?
at the grocery store. I was gone maybe 20 minutes.
here's my card.
contact you as soon as we know something.
okay.
come here, sweetheart.
think we need to look a little further into their arrangement.
I'm not sure i can take much more.
were you able to rule out drowning as C. O.D?
no water in the lungs, petechial hemorrhaging, bruising around the neck.
your mermaid was killed on dry land.
can you estimate how long she was in the water?
usually with prolonged immersion,
no water in the lungs, petechial hemorrhaging, bruising around the neck.
the absence of any skin detachment suggests she wasn't in the water more than eight hours, give or take.
so, overnight.
doesn't look like she traveled far either. No drag marks, scrapes, cuts.
no postmortem injuries consistent with being at the mercy of the east river's current.
so she was dumped close to where we found her.
Mm. I prepared a sexual assault kit, just in case, but the water likely diluted any evidence.
the only thing i did find...
was unique scarring and calluses on both of her hands.
they appear old, difficult to tell where she got them.
rawhide braiding.
I'm sorry?
weaving together untanned hides to make reins for horses or lassos to herd cattle.
the friction and the pressure of the leather cuts you up pretty good.
my dad taught me when I was ten.
you think danny calls me montana 'cause I'm a 49ers fan?
he calls you that 'cause he's got a crush on you.
so your victim traveled far after all.
Jane doe's a country girl.
who did you write that check to, sir?
her name was sara butler.
she's dead? - Murdered.
what was the check for, mr. White?
I, uh,
I hired her to sing. Last night was...
I-I'm sorry, she was murdered? How?
no, no, no."Last night was...
my daughter's birthday.
she turned eight-- I threw a party for her on the corporate boat, a slumber party.
somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight someone's thinking of me...
Sara was part of the entertainment.
my daughter loves mermaids.
why sara?
a friend gave me her number, said that she'd be perfect.
we found $100 in her dress.
her bag with all her clothes, fell off the boat, sank like a rock.
I felt bad, I had already written the check, so I just gave her an extra hundred.
and she walked home wearing mermaid clothes?
I offered her my coat, but she said she didn't live far and she'd be fine.
where do you keep the boat? -Just off the fulton ferry.
can you tell me what happened to her?
I'll sum it up or you. She was on your boat, you gave her an extra $100 because you "felt bad,"her bag is conveniently missing, and she wound up dead in the river not far from where you were docked.
Mr. White, we're gonna need to take a look at your boat.
may have hired sara for more than just her singing.
normally, I would say that mr. Jeffries was the luckiest man on the planet, but given the circumstances...
Wow. It's badly deformed.
that's odd, considering the depth of penetration.
Yeah. I didn't have to dig very far. The bullet didn't strike any hard tissue.
which means it wasn't traveling at a high velocity.
probably shot from a great distance.
your shooter had pretty good aim.
you ever have a threesome?
it's not as glorious as you might imagine.
it's complicated dealing with the different personalities.
and, hey, sometimes, you're just not in the mood, if you know what I mean.
it's hard enough explaining that to one woman, let alone two.
and then there'S... - sid.
anything else?
Oh. Just some trace on don juan's right fingers.
I'll send a sample to the lab. -Okay.
there were these two vivacious young ladies. Of course, I was much younger than I am now.
Sid, I got to go. I got to go.
Hey, what are you looking at?
the bullet retrieved from mark jeffries.
the sum of one land and groove impression is 0. 165 inches.
consistent with a . 32 automatic. - Yeah.
good, so now we know what kind of gun we're looking for.
it shouldn't be that deformed.
now, the bullet penetrated our vic's eye, but didn't hit the bone.
implies it hit an intermediary target.
but there was no evidence of that at the scene, hawkes.
well, then...
our bullet transformed in mid-air.
for the last time, paul, this was found in your bed, on your boat, along with semen and vaginal fluid, both of which are being tested while we speak.
way I see it, the extra $100 wasn't because sara lost her bag.
you were getting a little mermaid on the side. Am I right?
no. I'm a married man.
okay. So we'll get a dna sample from your wife.
all right, all right, all right...
listen.
the semen in the bed is mine. Your tests will prove that.
all right.
but I wasn't with sara. Your tests should prove that, too.
now is the part where you give me a name. That girl was 19 years old.
I'm begging you not to tell my wife.
I was with leslie shields during the party.
she was one of the parents on the boat.
while your little girl is blowing out candles, you're in the other room cheating on your wife, not one of my better moments, I agree.
no, and it still doesn't tell me how sara's sequin got in your bed.
I let her get dressed in the stateroom. I don't know, it must have fallen off.
I never touched sara butler.
I swear.
our lovely threesome didn't start out that way.
mark jeffries was legally married to elle jeffries three years ago.
Laura was an add-on.
okay, so our vic and elle were married for about a year, and the sex got routine. They added laura to spice things up.
look at this.
l didn't think this case could get more interesting, but it does.
five years ago, laura shot her boyfriend in self-defense.
D. A. Chose not to prosecute her.
she kill him? -Shot him right in the chest.
she pulled the trigger once before, maybe the second time was easier.
let's go see what laura has to say.
coming?
Yeah. Yeah.
are you looking for laura or elle?
and you are?
uh, kevin davis;I'm a friend of the family.
elle said she and you were having breakfast yesterday morning when mark was shot.
I make a mean eggs benedict.
detectives.
uh, we were just about to take off.
that's okay, you should take care of this. I'll call you later.
it's actually laura wise, isn't it? You and mark weren't legally married.
but mark and elle were.
when I met them, they were married a year. So?
did you ever pressure mark to get a divorce?
what? -I'm sure he treated you differently.
you weren't his lawfully-wedded wife, and it's perfectly natural for him to pay more attention to elle.
what are you implying?
that I killed my husband over a marriage license?
we're gonna need to test your hands for gunshot residue.
you're out of your mind. Both of you can go to hell.
Oh... laura! If you didn't do it, you should have no problem with the test.
you're not doing anything to me. I can't believe this.
that's why you're here, to accuse me of murder?
wouldn't be the first time you've been accused of murder.
what did you say?
five years ago, you shot and killed your boyfriend.
it was self-defense--the district attorney didn't go forward with the case.
Oh, even so, you pulled the trigger once. I'll bet you had no trouble doing it again.
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! - How dare you!
you know what you just did-- you assaulted an officer, laura.
you understand what that means? It means we can test your hands now. Get her out of here,
nice going, mac. How'd you know she was gonna slap you?
I didn't, I just thought she'd give me a little punch in the arm.
he would have killed me.
my ex-boyfriend.
if I didn't shoot him, he would have killed me.
I believe you.
no, you don'T. It's all right, I don't expect you to understand.
Laura, trust me.
I know what people you love are capable of doing.
you probably think I'm crazy, don't you?
a committed threesome, commitment ceremony...
life can get monotonous, so you add a little adventure, mix it up.
you're wasting your time, detective.
no, laura, I don't think i'm wasting my time.
you just tested positive for gunshot residue.
this isn't happening.
so you got any idea who did this to my girl?
not yet, no.
I always told her the city is no place for a montana girl.
did sara have a boyfriend or anybody she was having troubles with?
I wouldn't know.
when was the last time you spoke with her?
I haven't spoken to sara in over a year.
Why?
I'm sorry.
Sara had this dream...
being in new york, being a singer.
you know, I told her it was a pipe dream.
one day, she comes to me, she says...
she says,"daddy I'm doing it.
I'm going to new york. "You know what I said to her?
you walk out that door, there's no coming home.
that's the last thing I said to my daughter.
you didn't have any contact after that?
it was...
she'd call and talk to her mom.
at the end of every call, my wife would say,"I will.
I-I knew she was saying...
tell daddy I love him.
talk about regret. -Yeah.
what's the story with the dna?
turns out that paul white told flack the truth.
DNA from the boat doesn't match sara.
and it's plausible that the sequins we found in the bed fell off when she was changing, you know?
so what do we have left?
you're looking at it.
Where's the sequin you found in paul's bed?
sequins fell off this thread.
this was the only sequin we found on the bed, right?
that's it.
so all the sequins had fallen off this thread.
but the others are out there. Maybe they can point us to where sara was attacked.
she was killed right here.
Hello, james vackner.
his palm print was on the hair comb.
score. Public intoxication, menacing, assault three, on parole for assault two.
his violence keeps escalating.
looks like he skipped assault one and went straight to murder.
let's check it out.
I got a rap sheet,
I'm on parole--I got the perfect resume, am I right?
I fit the profile.
what do you say we get this over with and you just lock me up?
tell me where you were two nights ago.
I was working. Then I walked home.
through the park?
why do I get the feeling if l answer that question, I'm gonna be in big trouble?
you know what? You're alreadyin big trouble, okay? We found your print on a hair comb, mr. Vackner.
Yeah, okay, I was walking.
I see this thing, it looks like a gold bracelet or something in the grass.
so I pick it up. You know, maybe it's worth something.
turns out to be nothing, so I drop it.
there's a problem with that story.
you see, it's a unique print, okay? It's not your run-of-the-mill thumbprint.
your palm touched that hair comb.
that doesn't happen just from picking it up, james.
look, I picked the thing up. Obviously, my palm touched it.
and the hits just keep on coming.
that's coming out of your pay, vackner!
you wear those boots to work every day? Yeah, the whole getup.
are we done?
Hey, jose, I ain't paying for nothing! It wasn't my fault.
Yeah.
we're done.
you think there's a large enough sample here from vackner's boot?
shouldn't take much.
I found the tiniest bit of tree bark in the sample.
tree dna. Insane, huh?
match the sample from his boots to the soil at the crime scene, and we can put vackner's boots in the dirt impression.
and vackner himself at the scene of the crime.
and we got him.
GSR pattern on laura's hands was strange. I've never seen anything like it before.
the only residue l found ran along her pinkie line, and then down her wrist.
same pattern, along the pinkie line of both hands.
I've never seen that before either. But it's enough for a warrant.
grab a . 32 and see if you can reconstruct the pattern.
Hawkes and I will check out the vic's apartment. Maybe laura was stupid and hid the gun.
all right. I'll meet you back here-All right.
detective taylor.
counselor. You start returning phone calls?
I've been busy. -So I've heard.
my client, mr. Pratt, says he's being harassed by someone in your department.
DJ pratt is a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation, but I don't have anyone assigned to surveillance at this time.
so you're saying my client's making this up? -Your client's a rapist, counselor.
DJ pratt. Detective burn, crime scene investigator.
I know who you are.
you've turned this into a personal vendetta, haven't you?
it's not a vendetta, it's my job.
let me remind you of something, detective.
you've already gone down this road twice before. Both times, you hit a dead end.
first case, your victim wouldn't testify. Second, you had no evidence.
you know what they say about third times.
I'm filing a civilian complaint of malicious prosecution.
you do that. Are we done?
for now. - Good.
get the hell out of my building.
welcome to the house of trinogamy.
Wow. I got to admit this is not what I expected.
I'll bite. What were you expecting?
I don't know.
lava lamps, weird tapestries, a robo-spanker, maybe a couple of big...
all right, all right. I'm sorry I asked.
check the kitchen. We're looking for a . 32 automatic.
Hey, mac, there's three of everything.
except for the tub.
that's an odd chair for this room.
I got nothing.
if laura's the shooter, she didn't keep the gun.
I got something.
apparently, mark liked to watch.
or possibly someone else.
maybe this threesome wasn't all that committed.
Hey, mac.
I tried to recreate the gunshot residue pattern on laura's hands, and it was impossible.
so it was secondary transfer. She still must have handled the gun.
I thought so, too, and then I started thinking, she hit your chest with a closed fist.
whoa, whoa, hey! - How dare you!
you want to test my shirt, don't you?
swab away.
no gsr. I'm sorry.
if there were residue along her pinkie lines, it would have transferred to you.
so she didn't have gsr on her hands when she hit me, but when you tested her at the precinct, she did.
where was she in between?
positive for gsr.
who was in this car before laura jeffries?
only had one arrest.
guy named laurence jackson.
What'd you pick him up on?
shooting by the railway yard.
he was cuffed just like laura was.
and that's when it transferred from his hands to the seat, and the seat to her hands.
Laura isn't our shooter.
she never even handled the gun.
Thanks, hendershot.
Hawkes. What do you got?
all right, thanks.
semen recovered from mark jeffries' bedroom
two donors. One on the bed, which belongs to mark jeffries, one next to the chair.
so our threesome is actually a foursome.
we found semen on the carpet in the bedroom that doesn't belong to mark jeffries.
who's the second donor?
it's the pinch hitter'S.
pinch hitter?
we thought we needed to add another level to the relationship, so we asked a friend to join us.
and you call him the pinch hitter because...
because he doesn't get to play unless we call him to the plate.
he just sits there and watches.
we liked being watched.
even we get bored in bed sometimes.
so kevin davis is the pinch hitter.
okay, so he's not allowed to touch you, but clearly the same rule doesn't apply to himself.
as long as he didn't cross the line.
maybe kevin got a little tired of watching.
all you got to do is press here.
gun. Right hip.
Mr. Davis?
detective taylor. What can i do for you?
is there a problem? -No. There's no problem, sir.
we'd like to ask you some questions, but we'd feel more comfortable if you weren't armed.
I have a license to carry this.
may I?
Yeah.
it's nine millimeter.
vic was shot with a 32. Is this the only gun you own, sir?
wait a minute. You think I shot mark?
we know your role in the happy threesome, kevin.
must be frustrating to sit on the sidelines like that.
if mark's out of the picture, you get called up from the minors, right?
I didn't want mark out of the picture, okay? I just...
it was a matter of time before one of the girls approached me.
it turned out to be elle.
elle was seeing you on the side?
I wouldn't say seeing. It happened once.
couple of days ago, she knocked on my door, said she couldn't stop thinking about me.
we did our thing, then again the next day, and that was that.
the others find out?
elle made me promise not to tell mark or laura, so I didn'T.
why ruin a good thing, right?
right.
and for the record, that is the only gun I own.
remind me to switch banks.
the suspense is killing me. What happened with, uh, james vackner's pants?
pants-- he washed 'em, the mutt.
you're kidding me. So not even trace amounts of soil on the knees?
nada, but i got something better.
tell me. - Oil.
consistent with the oil that leaked from the water taxi.
so we place him at the dump site.
found drop-sized stains in the cuff of his work pants.
so what's next? -Arrest james vackner.
it's time for some answers.
why sara?
that's her name, sara.
why her?
you know, let me show you something.
see, these items...
right here, james?
what they do is, they tell us a story. Each one of them.
a story that ends with the death of a beautiful young girl at your hands.
she was an easy target, wasn't she?
she probably never knew you were behind her.
and I bet you it didn't take much to force that little girl to the ground, did it?
that look familiar?
then when it was all over, you dumped her body in the river.
so it goes.
why'd you do it, james?
why sara?
Hey, mac, what does that look like to you?
Oh, it's the . 32 slug pulled from the vic.
Yeah. I analyzed the lead. It had trace amounts of copper.
it was jacketed?
the sum of one land and groove on a . 32 slug is 0. 165 inches.
add a copper jacket-- 0. 17 inches.
making it a nine millimeter bullet consistent with kevin davis's firearm.
exactly. The round must have passed through something, stripping the copper jacket before entering the victim.
we need to find that copper jacket.
I don't see anything the bullet could have passed through.
we need to widen our scope.
increase the number of possible obstructions.
all right, even if the shooter wasn't lined up with the front door...
Hey, mac! Stella!
Hey, you guys, you're gonna want to see this.
looks like gunshot residue.
and blood.
shooter was right here.
collect samples and get them to trace.
if the shooter was there, what did the bullet pass through?
well, bullets are more fragile than you think.
it doesn't take much to strip the jacket.
metal, wood.
Hawkes, you said that the, uh...
the vic had newspaper ink on his fingers?
Yeah.
all five fingers, right hand.
even paper could do it.
ripped from the headlines.
do you know what "limp wrist" is in police jargon, elle?
a totally different meaning in your world, I'm sure.
it's when a person doesn't have the strength to keep a gun from kicking.
the blast overpowers the wrist, causing it to move erratically.
you have a limp wrist, elle.
that's it? That's what you've got?
look. Well, we've got your blood.
on the wall where you fired the gun.
it's over.
your only access to a gun was kevin davis, so you went to his apartment, seduced him, and stole his gun.
next morning you waited across the street until mark came out.
then you went back to kevin's, and as he was preparing his famous eggs benedict, you returned the gun unnoticed.
what did mark do to deserve a bullet to the head?
I was always second.
when the three of us were in bed, mark always had sex with laura first.
you have no idea how much it hurt to know that I wasn't something new anymore.
I became an afterthought.
why not just leave?
cut your losses?
I loved him.
and when I told him how I felt, he laughed.
said I was being stupid.
told me to get over it.
well, I was going to make sure he never laughed again.
and now I'm over it.
you okay?
Yeah.
just, uh, finishing up some stuff.
nice work on the butler case. Danny said you did a great job.
Thanks.
he also said you were struggling a bit with this one.
it's natural to want to know why.
to understand the whole story.
well, what if you don't get any answers?
sometimes bad things happen to good people, and you don't get to know why.
that doesn't work for me.
not gonna lie to you. It's hard. It eats at you.
we rarely have all the answers, lindsay.
I still lose sleep over the ones that got away.
I want to know why.
why did you do it?
why sara?
you came all the way down here for that?
these are the, uh, dna results from all the open rape cases in the city.
none of them come back to D. J. Pratt.
but there are five cases where the evidence was either degraded or non-existent.
one has a similar M. O.
maybe pratt, but...maybe not.
you can leave those. Thanks, adam. Good night.
you're gonna catch this guy.
I know it.
good night. -Good night.
here's what I know.
employees were just showing up for work when our perp enters the bank cowboy style.
you expect me to believe you didn't kill him?
I didn't, this man was dead before I got here.
the bank was already robbed once today.
and the vic could be a casualty from that heist.
makes your suspect one of the unluckiest mooks on the planet.
you, you can't walk me out there.
they'll kill my family.
they tied my wife and daughter up and said that if I don't do what they told me, they'd kill them.
who's they?
it came back to a Derrick James.
black male, 35 years old.
he spent three years in Iraq doing private security.
help me, please.
they're coming out.
hold your fire!
the story about your family
it was all a lie, wasn't it?
aviation Three to Central.
show me on a continued 60 search-and-rescue for Detective Mac Taylor.
central to Aviation Three. 10-4.
let's make another pass over Williamsburg.
how long ago was that?
did they see Mac in the car?
okay, okay, we're going to head in that direction.
Thanks, Flack. Surveillance cameras on the GW Bridge spotted our car going west into Fort Lee.
let's go.
okay, here we go.
stop, stop!
my na-- my name is Mac Taylor.
I'm a crime scene investigator with the NYPD.
I'm injured.
I need a phone. Do you have a phone?
please.
I need your help.
okay, okay, but you have to stay out there.
let's check the FDR again.
they've got to be here somewhere.
okay, here we go.
I can't hear you.
hello.
Hello?
where are you?
Jersey City.
uh, the backside of the Statue of Liberty.
freedom Way.
okay, I'm heading there.
he's in Jersey.
notify the state PD to get to Freedom Way.
see if you can get a Jersey City official to talk to us.
it all began very early this morning as a bank robbery.
hostages were taken, and among them a New York City crime scene investigator.
Julie, we believe an NYPD investigator was forced to escort the bank robbery suspect out of the city.
hold on, Steve.
they just pulled a body out of the water.
you feeling any pain?
headache.
dizziness.
vision's a little blurry; it comes and goes.
symptoms of a minor concussion.
what are my chances of getting you on that helicopter and taken to the nearest hospital?
I tried that already.
the vic we pulled out of the car is Derrick James.
that's our prime suspect in the murders of the bank manager and his wife.
and he's not the guy you left the bank with, Mac.
do you have any idea what happened to the guy who took you hostage?
hold your fire! Stand by perimeter!
he calls himself Joe.
we were in the car.
just pull off the road up here.
do it!
last thing I remember is pulling myself out of the water.
you think Joe's a floater?
I'm thinking Joe's a fugitive.
divers haven't found anything that suggests there's another body out there.
well, once we process the car and we get our vic back to autopsy, maybe it'll fill in some blanks.
bad news on that front.
this scene's out of our jurisdiction.
Jersey Brass will only allow us to take crime scene photos.
mac was in that car.
it's an NYPD vehicle.
and it's in New Jersey.
they get the body, the car, and before you ask, they want no part of a joint investigation.
look, I don't like it either, but it's proper protocol.
they'll keep us informed, and they'll give us all the information they can.
so what are we supposed to do?
go back into the city and thumb through photos and wait?
no.
this guy robbed a bank, held people hostage, and killed a man.
he's out there somewhere and we're going to find him.
are you kidding me, Mac?
mac, what are you doing here?
you suffered a concussion.
that's not something to take lightly.
a man tried to kill me.
I'm not going to sit home and sip soup.
this lab's priority is finding Joe.
if your headache gets worse or you start to feel even a little nauseous you got to let me know.
all right? Hawkes.
who processed the robbery scene at the bank?
we got two teams there right now.
I want any evidence found in that bank back to this lab ASAP for analysis.
of course. That was Jersey PD.
there was minimal trace evidence found in the unmarked car, and most of it was compromised by the water.
that may have been our best and last chance of IDing this Joe character.
maybe not.
I pressed my knee against the band radio.
I keyed the mic.
NYPD Communications should have a recording of everything.
I'm gonna hit the showers. Hawkes, you pull the tape.
maybe Joe said something that I don't remember, anything that might lead us somewhere.
I'm on it. Danny, stay on top of the bank.
all right.
I downloaded all the data I received from the New Jersey Coroner's Office on Derrick James.
now, as you can see, the fatal gunshot injury is here
close contact.
apparently, the bullet lodged behind the eye.
I examined your crime scene photos.
notice the angle of the shot.
abraded skin around the entry wound, and the gun's upside down, as if he shot himself.
bam.
and that's just one of my many odd discoveries.
there's tearing of the tissue lining the esophagus.
it happened within hours of his death.
any idea what he ate?
stomach contents only reveal our vic to be a vegetarian.
he also suffered a deflated lung, broken ribs, and there's an incision there above the navel.
an incision? That sounds deliberate.
the tissue around the area lacks the characteristics of a simple stab wound, and there was also evidence of sawing.
the New Jersey coroner says that these particular injuries were inflicted postmortem.
Yes, after his death, and the fracture of the ribs as well as the punctured lung are consistent with the Heimlich maneuver.
who tries to save a dead man from choking?
you were shot, Mac.
there are no injuries on my body consistent with a gunshot wound.
there is a rifling mark on this bullet.
it was definitely discharged from a gun.
and this hole in your shirt, there are abrasion marks around it.
it's proof.
somebody shot you.
what I don't understand is why the bullet only got so far as to pierce the fabric, and then it stopped.
I can only think of the basic tenets of physics.
eventually, everything runs out of energy.
divine intervention, maybe?
God's a scientist, Lindsay.
okay, so we need a point of friction.
the passenger side window.
the bullet must have traveled through this window, tumbled and struck me here.
the impact could have slowed its momentum.
maybe something was wrong with the load.
it could have been old.
a round of ammunition has a shelf life just like a can of soup.
there's also the fabric of your shirt.
the elasticity of the material would have created a trampoline effect.
slowed the bullet because it stretched.
if I were you, I'd buy a few more of those shirts.
you know something, Lindsay.
Joe wasn't trying to drown me.
he pushed the car into the water to hide the bodies.
mine and Derrick James.
Joe thinks I'm dead.
all units, check for an open mic.
check for an open mic.
this was all a lie.
your family's not in danger.
there is no family.
I had to get out of there, man.
what now?
what do you care?
just shut up and drive.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
what do you care?
just shut up and drive.
that's a phone number.
Hey, Mac.
I think this might be the thing that gets us a little closer to Joe.
a little girl's hair clip?
Stella photographed it on the backseat of the unmarked car.
now, we don't escort children in those kinds of vehicles.
no detective assigned to that car had children.
they clean these cars every single night.
I don't think it came from you.
and Derrick James was never in the backseat.
so that leaves Joe.
called Jersey, water damaged most of the biologicals in the car.
but they found a hair in the teeth of the barrette.
I got a partial profile hit in CODIS.
and it's a match to the biologicals lifted from the phone Joe used in the bank.
yo, and I can still see the media.
getting out of here.
shared Alleles at all Loci.
and the DNA is female.
it's his daughter.
if we find Joe's family, we'll find him.
I think he's back in New York City.
you know something we don't?
I analyzed the tire impressions from the scene and determined the wheel base at approximately 101 inches.
now, based on the paint on the fender that Stella photographed at the scene, we're looking for a Pontiac G8,
dodge Charger or Ford Mustang.
those three makes and models are our best start.
I'm missing the part where that puts Joe in Manhattan.
right.
I used the tire's 3-D profile to calculate the weight of these cars in relation to the depth of the tire impressions from the scene.
I'm guessing that Derrick James met Joe at Freedom Way to split the money from the bank robbery.
Where's the money? The money.
only, I'm thinking the money was never in the car.
check this out.
the depth of the tire impressions of the car that Derrick drove to the field would have been much deeper if there was two million dollars in that vehicle.
so maybe that's why Joe killed Derrick.
he didn't bring the cash.
why did Derrick show up at all?
why didn't he just take the money and run?
Joe was the only one who could put Derrick at the bank robbery, because those surveillance cameras were disabled.
so Derrick must have met up with Joe to kill him.
take Joe out of the picture, and he's scot-free.
all right, so if we go with your theory, Adam, the money from the robbery is still in Manhattan.
so we find the money, we find Joe.
Hey, Mac.
my analysis of the recording from the unmarked band led me to Derrick James's phone number.
Joe was calling him from the car, letting him know he was on his way to the rendezvous location.
and I tracked down paper on Derrick's phone, got a phone number on Joe.
a phone number, great.
where are you?
not in the morgue.
that's right, Joe.
it's Mac Taylor; I'm still alive.
so why don't you put an end to all this and tell me where you are?
I can't, can't go to jail.
this can only end two ways, and jail is your best option.
that is up to me, not, uh, not you.
there's no place you can hide, Joe.
I'm coming to get you.
not enough time to triangulate.
we got nothing. No, we did get something.
when Joe answered the phone, he was expecting someone else.
Yeah, we just sent out a photo of Joe.
check your e-mail, check your fax machines.
listen to me.
if anybody looks like he could be this guy's cousin,
I want him questioned.
Yeah, Dempsey, sorry about that.
listen, chances are he's gonna dump that car.
so do me a favor, tow any make or model that even remotely resembles what we're looking for. Thanks.
Hey, Flack, you got a second? Yeah, Adam. What's up?
uh, I just need your help with something.
um, you got a place I can plug in?
Yeah.
I ran with the theory that Joe came back into the city, which means he could have returned using the Holland or Lincoln Tunnels or by bridge.
all of which have surveillance cameras.
specifically, in payment zones intended to capture the plate numbers of those who don't pay.
I focused on all traffic heading east the first hour after the bank robbery.
and I isolated all cars that were a match for our wheel base, and found this.
this is Joe at the tollbooth.
he dropped a coin. Perfect.
using digital facial points,
I confirmed the profileto be a match to the photo that you have of Joe from the bank.
that's him.
we got a plate? Bogus plates.
but we did get a VIN number when he opened the door to pick up the coin. Good.
What'd NYSPIN give us?
well, the car doesn't belong to Joe.
who's it belong to?
you sure about this?
Yeah, I ran it three times.
do Mac and Stella know?
no. I-I came to you first.
okay.
I got this one.
okay, well, I-I got to tell them.
give me two hours.
how you doing? You okay?
long day.
you got anything?
I got a case-to-case hit on a bank robbery from six years ago.
fingerprints are a match to Joe.
no surveillances, there were no witnesses, no guns, nobody was hurt, no activity since then.
no location on Derrick James's address.
just got a P. O. box so far that leads us to a bunch of fake numbers.
but I'm thinking he's the one who shot you.
bullet fragment you found in your shirt is a match to what Jersey pulled from inside Derrick's head.
that confirms the fact that Joe's the shooter.
but it doesn't match the bullet that ricocheted off the ceiling at the bank robbery, which was from Joe's gun.
well, he could have easily taken Derrick's gun.
I thought about that.
Sid and Stella said that the muzzle imprint on Derrick's face was upside down.
so if Joe fired the gun, he would've been holding it like this.
more than likely, the bullet would not have traveled upward toward the eye.
I'd say Derrick fired at you first.
the bullet shatters the glass, Joe's his next target, they struggle for the gun.
you be Joe.
I come at you, grab my wrist.
points the muzzle of the gun back towards Derrick's face and boom.
that explains the upside down muzzle print, right?
so he's our shooter.
doesn't make Joe any less dangerous, Danny.
the only reason he didn't shoot me is because he thought I was already dead.
right.
I wish I could think of something he said or did in that bank that would help us, something that would tell us who he really is.
my kit.
at the bank.
there was dirt on the sole of his shoe.
Danny, where's my kit?
pardon me.
you still a lager guy?
I'm on the clock. Thanks, Sam.
bummer.
Where's your car?
what?
Where's your car?
uh, I loaned it to a friend of mine.
excuse me.
Lauren got a last name?
what's the problem?
I need to talk to her.
well, I don't have her number on me.
and, uh,
I left my phone at home.
which I'm starting to get the impression probably has about six messages from you.
where does she live, Sam?
she lives in the Twenties.
somewhere between Third and Lex I think.
you're telling me you loaned your car to some girl you don't even know where she lives?
Yeah. That's what I'm telling you.
look, I know her place by sight.
pizza joint, lighting store.
look, she's a friend.
she needed a car. So I loaned her mine.
don, what's going on?
listen to me.
you'd better not be involved in this, okay?
cause I'm not bailing you out this time and neither is Dad.
involved in what?
I found something very interesting on your kit, Mac.
organic plant material on the hinge.
I sense a demonstration coming.
if you could just touch the plant.
Oh.
it sensitive to touch.
this is what I found on your kit.
it's soil and root from a pantropical weed called mimosa pudica.
Joe transferred it when he kicked my kit.
active bacteria in the ground soil sample indicate that it's fresh.
so it couldn't have been on Joe's shoe very long before the transfer.
must've been someplace he went before he hit the bank.
Yeah. That's the problem.
someplace, out there in New York City.
I'll find it.
I did something.
um, look you-you made it very clear in the past that no information is ever to be released to anyone without your knowledge.
and, well, I-I needed
I-I told, um.
okay.
the car that we're looking for is a red Charger.
and it's registered to Flack's sister, Samantha.
and I told him before I told you, but I'm telling you now.
you should've told me then.
Yeah, but it's his sister.
you know, I mean, I would have told you if it was your sister.
do you have a sister?
Adam. Sorry.
what I'm saying is...
I made a choice that I would make again.
but I did not mean to disrespect you in any way.
I'll be right there.
that went well. Yeah.
found it a half an hour ago.
fits the description Adam gave of the possible vehicle.
and the VIN number matches what he pulled from the tollbooth photos.
and it's your sister's car.
she loaned it to a Lauren Salinas.
I got no answer at Lauren's apartment.
and her super wasn't in either.
open it.
pop the trunk.
Hey, Mac.
this could be Lauren.
I'm a crime scene investigator with the NYPD.
I need a phone.
okay, okay, but you have to stay out there.
I used her phone. What?
when I got out of the water, at Freedom Way.
she gave me her cell phone.
this woman came to my rescue.
Yeah, that's her.
that's Lauren.
I can't believe she's dead.
all right, Samantha, I need you to tell me everything.
everything that you know about her.
she was a regular at the bar.
she loved to party.
we had a lot of laughs together.
aside from that, I really don't know that much about her.
if you didn't know that much about her, why would you lend her your car?
I'm a generous person.
okay, she said it was only gonna be for a few days.
her car was in the shop, and, anyways, I can walk to work.
I tried to help somebody out, okay?
did she mention anything about coming into money?
moving?
buying any expensive items like that?
no.
she mention anything about having a husband, or a boyfriend?
Yeah, she had a steady guy but I never met him.
you ever see her with this guy right there?
no.
how about...
how about him?
no. No.
do you think these guys killed Lauren?
that's what we're trying to find out.
Hey.
you're not gonna tell Dad about this, right?
I-I don't want him to worry.
you know how he gets.
he will not stay off my ass if he hears about this.
let me give you a ride home.
come on, Don.
please.
just promise me you're not gonna tell him.
hey baby, how you been?
you all jammed up?
okay, pal, that's enough.
I was just being friendly, man, that's all.
go be friendly over there.
you know, I can handle my own life.
what? What?
take a look at that guy.
that guy's in your life?
that's the kind of scum you hang out with?
what's wrong with you? What are you thinking?
I'm thinking that I don't need you passing judgment on me.
I'm sorry that I embarrass you.
that's not true.
I just...
you just wish I was a little more like you?
I'll find my own damn ride.
it clear our victim's COD is exsanguination.
looks like Miss Salinas was stabbed.
but there was also respiratory straining with fluid in the lungs, which would indicate drowning.
or torture.
there's bruising on the wrists.
suggests she was bound.
the victim could have been forced under flowing water.
which would explain the evidence of near drowning.
where are you?
this has got to be who Joe was expecting when I called.
she's the other person involved.
there's no place you can hide, Joe.
I'm coming to get you.
where is it?
the money?
she's part of the bank robbery.
she was looking for them.
she wasn't on that road by accident.
and when Joe got to her, he was after information.
tell me what the key opens, Lauren?
Where's my money?
you tell me and I'll make this stop.
so chances are Lauren told Joe exactly what he wanted to know.
only if she knew.
these old deserted rail tracks hold a lot of secrets.
we're only looking for one.
trace amounts of decayed wood in the soil that Lindsay collected from your kit, are consistent with track cross ties of the 1930s and this location.
so this plant has got to be here somewhere.
there we go.
mimosa pudica.
someone's been digging in this soil.
licenses and passports.
all with different names and his picture.
looks like Joe had a trip planned.
or he's ready to skip into another life and become someone else.
he knows sooner or later, we'll find out where he lives.
he can't go home.
maybe he hasn't found the money yet.
I mean, if he had, he would have grabbed this stuff and left town.
I'm gonna get a plain clothes team to sit on this location.
he's got to come back and get this stuff at some point.
detective Taylor.
Hey, Mac, you guys are good.
but I knew you were good when you got me out of that bank.
but now you raised things up a notch.
so, you still don't have the money, huh?
well, I'll get it, and I'll get it before you get me.
Hawkes, see if you can get a trace on Mac's cell.
is it all worth it, Joe?
what's that little girl of yours gonna think about her daddy?
we found her barrette in the car.
daddy, hold on to my barrette.
don't lose it, okay?
I got it, sweetheart.
she's gonna spend her weekends visiting you in prison.
I'm doing this thing for her so she can be away from all this.
so your family doesn't have to find out who you really are?
do they call you Joe?
or is it Eric Johnson,
Doug Anderson, Michael Peterson?
who are you to them?
you son of a bitch, man.
you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
what happened? Derrick pull you back in?
after the bank job, Derrick's plan was to double-cross you?
then you killed him, and then you killed his girlfriend.
I didn't kill his girlfriend, man.
that was an accident.
Yeah, that was an accident.
come on, show yourself.
let's do this face-to-face.
Oh, come on.
I'm smarter than that.
well, you're still here, Joe.
you can't be that smart.
did you get it?
what've we go?
all right. No.
too short.
son of a bitch is watching us.
this is our last passport.
let's see what we get with this one.
here we go.
I got a UV-sensitive watermark in the shape of an eagle.
Yeah.
this one's the real deal.
all right, well, that makes all these others counterfeit.
that's our guy.
that's Joe's real name.
I'll run it through every criminal database.
Hey, Danny.
just got a hit to Lauren Salinas's fingerprints.
she was a teller at the bank.
she called in sick the day of the robbery.
well, this confirms that she was the inside woman, and she was involved in the bank heist from the beginning.
okay, wait.
Jersey crime lab trace report on Derrick James.
steel and nickel filings were recovered from Derrick's throat lacerations.
begs the question, what's made of steel and nickel that was so important that Joe had to dig it out of Derrick's gut?
how about a key?
I just logged the bank manager's key ring from the crime scene.
derrick and Joe's prints were on them.
the keys were numbered in order, and there was one missing-- number nine.
Where's the money?
derrick swallowed the key.
that explains the nickel in the scratch marks we found in his throat.
when Joe finds out he's getting double-crossed, he decides to go digging for the key.
which could mean that the money never left the bank.
derrick hid it there.
it makes sense, but why kill Lauren Salinas?
Lauren was his only link to the money, and I'm assuming if he got that information from her...
he's going back to the bank to make a withdrawal.
detective, here's the key you requested.
thank you.
he was here.
Hey, what are you doing up here?
NYPD! Freeze!
call for backup!
detective's in danger. We need backup.
what did you do?
Freeze!
stop, damn it!
Joe's real name is Ethan Scott.
using his authentic passport, we pulled his Social Security number.
tax records link him to a wife and daughter,
Allison and Emma Scott.
he's lived with them in Manhattan for the past eight years.
Yeah, a loft near the High Line.
Flack and the unis canvassed it.
looks like they cleared out, and Emma wasn't in school today.
they're on the run.
notified the Port Authority.
all airports.
we've got the bridges and tunnels covered, too.
and Ethan's photo will run in the late editions of the papers.
what about the money?
I put an alert out on the serial numbers.
I got some calls.
the cash was used to purchase tickets at Grand Central Station,
washington Bus Terminal, and the Staten Island Ferry.
all afternoon departures.
cash was also used to rent a couple cars from three different agencies.
he's trying to confuse us by using the stolen cash to establish decoys.
well, if that's the case, maybe he's not leaving town at all.
just wants us to think that he is.
or he already jumped a cab out of town.
I got a hit on a credit card purchase by his wife, Allison Scott, three train tickets to Toronto, Canada.
purchase and departure point-- Poughkeepsie, New York.
the train leaves in two hours.
three tickets. He's meeting them there.
I'm gonna get this photo to local P. D. get some officers on the trains.
no. No wait.
if Joe thinks this is a game, fine.
we'll keep it going.
but this time, we're gonna play by my rules.
Amtrack Empire Service to Pennyslvania now arriving on Track 4.
next stop...
he'll be here soon, sweetheart.
Mrs. Scott?
Yes. Can I help you?
I'm Detective Bonasera.
I need to speak with you.
here you go. Thank you.
okay, thank you.
what is this about?
your husband's been involved in a bank robbery.
he took a police officer hostage, and he's committed murder.
I'm sorry, but you've got the wrong guy.
Ethan wouldn't do that.
no, we have the right guy, we have evidence, and we are going to arrest him.
no.
no, no, you have made some kind of big mistake.
Ethan is a good man.
we need your help.
your cooperation will assure his safety.
we don't want to see your husband hurt.
Hey!
Hey, baby.
you still running around in circles, Detective?
you ready to give yourself up?
you know something. I'm going to miss hearing your voice.
those empty threats and false bravado.
this isn't over, Ethan.
well, where I stand, it is.
well, I think Allison and Emma might think differently.
Oh. Good for you.
I knew you'd figured out who I was.
just a matter of time.
but I'm gonna say-- I did expect a little bit more from you.
cause yesterday, when you walked into that bank and started getting down to business,
I wasn't so sure I was gonna get away.
you were right.
you're under arrest for the murder of Derrick James, Lauren Salinas, the kidnapping andattempted murder of a crime scene investigator, armed robbery, grand theft auto, assault and battery...
...but most of all... for pissing me off.
baby, you're worth every dollar, every nickel, every penny.
I'm begging you, shut up.
so...
michael Jones. Oxford, class of '98,
Rhodes scholar, Nobel Peace Prize winner,
time magazine's man of the year.
he ran drugs from Beach 14th to Beach 20th.
should have stayed home.
should have stayed home?
I should have stayed home.
a lot of glass.
a lot of work.
this is precisely why your mother tells you to wear clean underwear.
why does anybody need their mother to tell them that?
is everybody running around wearing dirty underwear?
help me turn him over.
it's board game money.
don't ask me why, but Smokes McGee here was counting out stacks of tens, 100s and 500s while catching up on reruns of Heckle and Jeckle.
more of a Tom and Jerry fan myself.
mighty Mouse, enough said.
that there is your murder weapon.
it was still warm when I got here.
pretty cold-blooded.
a knock on the door.
vic goes to answer.
must have been expecting someone.
but when he opens it...
game over.
looks like he had money to burn.
the marijuana joint's rolled with one of the board game bills.
only there's no board game.
this paper's too thin.
this was intentionally designed as rolling paper.
doesn't appear he was killed for the drugs.
clearly he pissed someone off.
perp did his business, didn't care about leaving the gun.
you know, four out of five doctors surveyed actually recommend smoking a doobie while having an asthma attack.
you got a name?
the apartment belongs to a Michael Jones.
this, however, is not Michael Jones.
the neighbors know him only as Scooby.
Scooby?
Dooby-Doo.
so, where is Michael Jones?
probably up at the haunted house pulling the mask off of Old Man Withers.
I'll track him down.
I know it was gonna be a late night, but I suggest coffee.
Yeah, found them in the vic's pocket.
best guess is Ecstasy.
probably dealing, based on the amount.
sounds about right.
the girls sitting with the vic said that he was the go-to guy, although they all swear they say no to drugs.
right, and they all swear they didn't see the shooter's face?
too dark and too fast.
the two sitting on this end said they saw a guy at a blue hoodie at a table over there.
they were about to do a round of drinks when...
he dropped the gun?
that's what they said.
some pill popping whack job split with the murder weapon.
how do you know the person who has it pops pills?
how do you know he doesn't?
because he's a she, and I am clean as a whistle.
who's got it on me?
nobody.
one of the girls saw it get kicked under one of the tables.
so, the night's not a total bust.
but I still have to deal with this.
perp's DNA and fingerprints could be right in front of us.
it's moments like this that I love that I'm not a lab rat.
he's got semen trace on the boxers.
I've had some bad sex, but nothing that would warrant killing the guy.
very little blood.
no spatter.
he was dumped, probably from the car that was parked right here.
so, where is our primary crime scene?
I think the car was our primary crime scene.
there's, uh, blood on the glass.
so, killed in the car and tossed on the curb.
shooter was outside the car.
look at this.
hackle marks.
now, the perpendicular end is always opposite the side of impact.
and based on the curvature of the glass, our shooter approached from the outside.
so, who took off in the car?
was it, um, the paper airplanes or-or the dancing?
it was the dancing, wasn't it?
I mean, I don't have to dance, and look, I know I say,"What up?" a lot, and I'll definitely limit the number of times that I say it, but you just need to tell me, boss, what I need to do and what I don't need to do, and I'll do it or I won't do it, you know,'cause this...
Adam, Adam, take a breath.
what are you talking about?
you-you don't know?
know what?
um... you're letting me go.
in a month. I...
I got one month left.
so, you don't... you don't happen to know anyone that's looking for a...
dedicated yet quirky yet, uh, devastatingly handsome lab geek, do you?
cause I...
this isn't about your job performance, Adam.
I knew there would be cuts.
you're just the low man on the totem pole carved by people trying to justify their jobs.
for what it's worth, sir, it, um...
it means a lot knowing that the decision didn't come from you.
you're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of this.
go back to work.
three bodies, all killed on the same night at virtually the same time.
and COD on all three is a complete mystery.
you serious?
well, they all seem to have this strange hole in their face that, prior to their being dead, didn't exist.
the bullets did them in, but they weren't concerned about living too long anyhow.
drug abuse?
you name it, it was in their systems.
Uh...ecstasy, barbiturates, cocaine, THC, meth.
this one had THC, PCP and albuterol, strangely.
we found an inhaler at the scene.
but he's not asthmatic.
his lungs are far from healthy, but no indication of asthma.
anything to chase?
well, these four marks are only a few days old.
stun gun burns.
maybe the killer graduated from stun guns to real guns.
that's a good guess.
Dr. Hammerback.
hmm, prints came back on all three.
this one had ID-- Michael Jones.
Yeah.
that was the name of the listed owner of the loft where that guy was killed.
Luther Stanton, and...this guy here
wow, he's got a great name.
you know him?
I know all three.
opening statements were supposed to begin promptly at 9: 00, people.
I see 12 jurors, I see one DA, and I see three defense attorneys, but I think we're missing some people.
care to enlighten me, Counsel?
your Honor, our clients...
I might be able to help with that, Your Honor.
detective Taylor, you know the whereabouts of the three defendants?
they're at the morgue.
all three defendants were gunned down last night around the same time at separate locations.
if we weren't looking at three different shooters,
I'd accuse you of trying to protect your undefeated record.
my case was rock solid.
well, you're damn right it was.
I collected the evidence.
even without the murder weapons, I was able to connect all three to the shooting.
it was retaliation, if you ask me.
when you kill a big player in the drug game, you've got to know people will be coming for you.
I thought these guys would plead out within a month.
here we are a year later.
must have thought they had a case.
Stanton, Labranche, and Jones were going down and they knew it.
week before trial, they tried to make a deal.
said they had good information on a pusher with a couple of bodies attached to him.
you get a name?
didn't get that far.
told them putting three drug dealing murderers back on the street in exchange for one defied logic.
what was their response to that?
they wanted to know what "defied" meant.
it's possible the guy they wanted to rat out got wind of it, decided to take them out before his name became a topic of interest.
maybe.
their statements to their attorneys are no longer privileged.
one of them might be willing to give me a name.
who's my best bet?
try Jake Donovan, Michael Jones' lawyer.
he's always been straight with me.
yo.
DNA and fingerprints?
you're a genius.
no sweat.
uh, how many more you got of these?
just five... large boxes.
awesome.
uh... just out of curiosity, what are you gonna be doing during this?
bang, bang.
I never get to play with guns.
you'll have to excuse the mess.
we just had the place fumigated.
clearly, they did a bang-up job.
but I guess it's just as well.
we come from the same species, right?
what? You don't like lawyer jokes?
I don't like lawyers.
right, and you're here because you want to give Michael Jones' eulogy or, uh, maybe you want to send flowers to the funeral.
marijuana plant would actually be more appropriate.
the DA tells me you were looking to deal?
Michael, Duckens, and Luther thought about giving up a name.
Yeah, thought about it.
Natalie Greer shot that down...
could have closed a couple more homicides maybe.
you willing to part with that name?
are you serious?
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.
I know you represent scumbag homicidal drug dealers and the scumbag homicidal drug dealers they rat on.
I'm giving you a chance to do the right thing here.
and, uh, doing the right thing is, uh, signing my own death warrant?
what do they say about a thousand dead lawyers under the sea?
a great start?
what?
you don't like lawyer jokes?
is this how you always try to get information out of somebody?
no, usually I'm a lot less charming.
Petrix Derosier.
operates between Beach 21st and Beach 30th in Far Rockaway.
sometimes even scumbag lawyers have a heart.
just don't tell anybody.
you live by the gun, you die by the gun.
literally, my friend.
what's up?
I ran the bullets from the murder weapons recovered at the loft and the nightclub.
they were used to commit a homicide a year ago.
you got a hit to the case the vics were on trial for-- the Manny Sky case?
they were killed with the same guns that they shot Manny Sky with.
the guns were never recovered.
find the third one, two to one it was also used to kill Manny Sky.
what's the deal with your funny money?
the value of the fake dollar just went up.
check this out.
whoa, what do we got? An opiate?
oxycodone.
hundreds are laced with crystal meth and the five hundy-- PCP and albuterol -
when rolled with marijuana, provides varying degrees of an extra high.
weed isn't enough?
what's the deal with the albuterol?
it's commonly used in asthma inhalers, opens up the lungs.
adding it to PCP maximizes the intake and the hallucination.
where do they come up with this crap?
Ah...Far Rockaway.
they're called high rollers.
sold by a new crew, run by a mope named Petrix Derosier.
mac turned me on to him after he spoke to one of the vics' lawyers.
apparently, the vics were going to give Petrix up to the DA.
the funny money is his new cash cow.
what are we looking at-- a war here?
I mean, what are the vics doing with his product?
let's go ask him.
all right.
goon number one, goon number two.
how you doing there, big guy?
Hey, Petrix.
little far from Rockaway, huh?
moving on up?
well, now, if it ain't the murder police and the cleaning crew.
you boys are always nice enough to clean up after we do what we got to do.
it's just a matter of time before you're mopping up floors at Rikers, Petrix.
no doubt.
you guys are able to find a fingerprint on the tip of a needle nowadays.
something tells me you haven't quite found what you're looking for, or else I'd be wearing them shackles over there.
so, what, you want to play Red light/Green light or is there something else?
there is, as a matter of fact.
you got change of a hundred?
listen.
officers, if you needed a bump, you should have come directly to me.
I'll give you the cheap suit discount.
Oh, what happened?
watch yourself. Yeah, give us a reason.
all right, it's all right.
relax. Relax.
see, Linus and Lump over there don't have the same sense of humor I got.
apparently not.
so what you got there?
you guys doing buy-and-busts now?
Nah, I found a stack of them over at Michael Jones' place.
Luther Stanton was actually counting them out right before he took a bullet to the head.
Jones, Stanton, Labranche-- they got Beach 14 to 20, you got 21 to 30.
everything's peaceful.
they jack some of your new product, put it on the street.
suddenly things ain't so peaceful anymore.
you and your girlfriends here go and take them out, right?
solid motive, no?
you guys got it all figured out now, huh?
actually, no, I don't.
see, the three of them were killed with their own guns.
so where'd you get the guns, Petrix?
pay y'all too much money.
Yeah.
nobody jacks my stuff, you hear me?
don't you read The Wall Street Journal?
three stooges who have what you got because there was speculation of a merger.
you, uh, were going to do business with them?
so what does that say? If you can't shoot them, join them?
the fact is: their murder cost me money.
I'm not pleased about that.
now, if that's all, Officer, I got some new investors to meet with.
y'all take care.
so what do you think?
nightclub, Mercedes, loft.
I'd like to be able to put him at one of the scenes.
do you really think that we wouldn't run the plates of a homicide victim and put a bulletin out on the car?
bitch, I don't know nothing abouno Duckens or Clickins.
it's Duckens Labranche, and you call me bitch one more time,
I'll make sure that your pimp knows that you're turning tricks without his knowledge.
now, Duckens Labranche-- you're driving his car.
gave it to me.
he gave you his $150, 000 Mercedes?
I'm that good, bit...Detective.
did he give it to you before or after he got shot in the head?
did he get shot in the head?
after.
it was his last dying wish.
what was I gonna do, not obey his last dying wish?
not if you're the one who told him to make it.
let me guess.
he gave you this, too.
I never seen that before.
y'all planted that.
what about the blood on your bra?
plant that, also?
we're gonna take your clothes in, and get that blood tested, Vivian, and we all know who it's gonna come back to.
you were driving his car with the murder weapon inside of it, and you got his blood on...
all right, all right. Damn!
all I know is, you're looking for some guy in a blue hoodie.
it was all I could see from my...position.
you couldn't tell at all what his skin color was-- black, white?
no. It happened too fast. I freaked out.
I thought about calling 911, but that Mercedes is a nice payday.
besides, he's lucky someone came and shot his ass before I put 100 bullets in him like Sonny Bono.
you mean Sonny Corleone.
whatever.
Cluckens was gonna stiff me.
all he had in his wallet were play money.
what did you do with it?
tossed it.
what am I gonna do with that?
it's useless.
get her out of here.
come on.
no, Chief, I haven't forgotten who I'm talking to.
I'm not interested in your bureaucratic chain of command.
I run this division, you hear me?
and decisions affecting my personnel, affecting the lives of people who work their ass off for me...
get back to work.
will be brought to my attention before they're made!
I'm quite certain I've worked hard enough and saved your ass enough to earn that privilege.
let me guess. Sinclair?
if he thinks he can just let people go without talking to me first, he's seriously mistaken.
he's the Chief of Detectives, Mac.
he could let you go if he wanted to.
whose side are you on, Stella?!
okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. Let's go back.
I don't even know what the hell this is all about.
city's making cuts.
our people are taking a hit.
Adam and six other lab techs.
sacrifices shouldn't be made in the manpower.
where then?
Sinclair said if I can find another $200, 000 in the budget, no one has to go.
what if we hold off on those automated DNA stations we ordered until after this budget thing blows over?
you're kidding me, right?
I mean, we've been waiting for over a year for those.
what Adam brings to the lab is worth waiting another six months.
they do ten times the work overnight.
it would take us a week.
come on, Mac.
you said yourself, the way they analyze DNA in masses-- I mean...
they can get a rapist off the street a day or two faster.
that means, a day or two that he doesn't rape another victim.
Yeah, yeah, and how many rapists can Adam help catch in the six months we wait?
how many murderers has he helped put away since he first started here?
fingerprints, hairs, fibers.
not to mention his expertise in computer-related investigations.
I'll take Adam every time.
he works his ass off.
losing him could hurt the city even more.
you think I don't know that?
I love Adam, Mac!
but passing on those automated work stations -
that keeps our lab a year behind in the technology.
let's say we wait.
who's to say Sinclair will actually pay for them in six months?
I don't think you have a choice here.
mac, you have a minute?
unless you're asking for money.
the gun we recovered from the Mercedes was also used in the Manny Sky homicide, just like the others.
we're looking for new evidence now, Lindsay.
somebody used that gun to kill Duckens Labranche.
well, I wasn't able to get any prints off the gun, but you know what they say?
when life hands you lemons...
limonene.
citrus terpene from fruit rinds.
I found significant traces of it on the grip and the barrel.
it's used in various cosmetics, cleaning solvents, even biofuel, so maybe we can link one of those uses to our perp.
we better.
ready to be shocked?
at this point, Stella, I'm not sure that's possible.
the barb wounds on Labranche's neck were caused by something like this.
it fires a wireless charge with four barbs.
packs a 1, 500 volt punch for up to 20 seconds.
believe it or not, that's not the most shocking part.
see, whoever used this on Duckens Labranche probably wasn't walking around with something this big, so I looked it up on line, and they sell handheld stun gun versions.
after going through customer sales lists for the last year,
I came up with this name you might find interesting.
Yeah. She was scheduled to testify against our victims.
that's not possible.
Why?
because I told her she wouldn't have to.
you saw something, and we need your help catching these guys.
they laughed after they shot that man.
they stood over him, and they laughed.
good, Maggie.
what can you tell me about them?
if I tell you, I'll be a witness.
I can see that that doesn't happen.
if we find these guys, and I collect enough evidence, you won't have to take the stand.
not what you were expecting, huh, Detective?
when did this happen?
a week ago.
after I got the subpoena.
I'm on my way.
well, you'll just have to wait and see, but you're gonna like it, trust me.
it's my specialty.
okay. I love you. Bye-bye.
listen to me very carefully.
I'm gonna make this clear as I know how.
you get on that witness stand, you die.
you hear me?
just in case you think I'm playing...
we gonna leave you with a little reminder.
thankfully, I started carrying a stun gun.
let's get out of here.
God knows what I would have looked like if they'd have kept going.
clearly, your word doesn't mean much, Detective.
so much for promising her she wouldn't have to testify.
Kevin... don't.
do you guys even care?
do you realize what it means to ask someone to be a witness?
my sister put her life on the line so you could close a case.
if we find these guys, and I collect enough evidence, you won't have to take the stand.
you promise me?
I promise.
make that promise to all your witnesses?
when I asked you to tell me what you knew a year ago,
I was trying to protect you, Maggie.
if you didn't talk to me, the DA would have subpoenaed you anyway, and by that time, it would have been too late.
part of my job is allowing the evidence I collect to speak for the living, as well as the dead.
you're lucky she's not dead.
enough, Kevin.
my brothers aren't quite as forgiving as I am.
based on what I collected after speaking to you, there was no reason for you to testify.
take that up with the DA.
you can bet on that.
I still would have testified, you know, even after this.
I wasn't scared anymore.
but they got what they deserved.
Maggie... I'm sorry, truly.
Yeah.
counselor, what the hell happened in the Manny Sky case?
why did you subpoena Maggie Hall?
she was a witness, you know that.
I collected enough evidence to keep her off the stand and put those bastards away for a very long time.
the evidence was suppressed.
what do you mean, suppressed.
Why?
don't worry.
nothing to do with your team.
well, I'm sure it didn't.
who screwed up?
it's not completely clear.
chain of custody issues.
someone removed the evidence from the property clerk without signing it out.
you can't be serious.
you know was well as I do these things happen.
with budget cuts, fewer employees-- things just fall through the cracks.
including peoples' faith in the system.
why are you so worked up over this?
Maggie Hall was not supposed to testify.
mac, she was a witness.
she made a statement.
the prospect of her being called by the prosecution shouldn't be surprising to you.
I promised her.
I promised she wouldn't have to take the stand.
why would you do that?
because if I didn't, you wouldn't have had a case.
I collected that evidence based on statements she made to me.
I promised her, damn it!
Yeah, well, don't get pissed at me for making a promise you knew you couldn't keep.
Petrix Derosier had more motive for killing Stanton, Jones and Labranche than we actual have for still being here.
I agree with you, Detective, but Derosier has been public enemy number one at the DEA for the past eight months.
you haven't put a case together in eight months?
we're thinking long term.
I mean, Derosier's big, but we're after all his connections as well, so...
we're using all the gadgets.
we've had Petrix and his crew under 24-hour wire surveillance, and cell phone tower records have helped us track their individual positions.
so you're saying they have an electronic alibi.
Petrix and his men could've easily passed their phones off to someone else.
we thought so, too.
well, you tell our friends in Brazil if they want a piece of the action, they should quit watching turtles lay eggs on the beach and get their asses on a plane.
we've got confirmed voice recognition for Petrix and his entire crew.
so Petrix is dirty, but clean.
that still leaves us Luther Stanton, Duckens Labranche, Michael Jones -
three defendants murdered on the eve of their trial.
if this wasn't about a drug war, then why the hell were these guys killed?
here's a twist.
remember the limonene trace I got on the gun that Stella found?
it turns out that one of Maggie Hall's brothers stocks fruit at a supermarket.
which brother? - Kevin Hall.
he works at a produce warehouse on the West Side Highway.
strong motive.
two more at home just like him.
three brothers, three shooters.
three victims.
maybe Maggie's brothers turned murder into a family affair.
look, all I'm saying is, if that was your sister who got cut up like that, the bodies of the guys who did it, they'd be unrecognizable.
you kidding me? You wouldn't find the bodies.
exactly.
and that's what the jury members are going to say about these guys.
Yeah, but come on, straight-up acquittal?
I give the jury a little more credit for following the law.
it's not even going to go that far.
I mean, the right play would be to cop a plea, man one, no life on the back end, they're guaranteed to get out at some point.
we're going to need more if the DA wants to leverage a plea.
your guy's not talking either?
he's got plenty to say, just not about the homicides.
these guys look good for it, but...
how did they get ahold of the three guns the vics' used to commit the homicide they were on trial for?
there's no trace of these guys at any of the scenes.
we got motive up the wazoo, but I mean, they were good.
they covered their tracks like they did it before.
mac, what if it was your sister?
I'd kill 'em.
okay, Mac, nobody at the bar where Michael Jones was killed remember seeing any of Maggie's brothers.
bartenders, bouncers-- they weren't scanning IDs.
recanvassing of the Tribeca loft didn't get us anything.
none of the neighbors recognized the photographs.
alibis?
as you know, they're not talking so we can't confirm or deny whatever story they plan on concocting, but I was able to verify that all three were not working that night.
and there were no phone calls from their home phone lines within an hour of the shootings.
cell phones?
multiple calls between all three brothers up to two hours before the shootings.
all right, both of you get in touch with Anti-crime.
find out if any of their informants remembers one of the brothers trying to buy a piece.
I want to know how they got the vics' guns.
all right.
Adam, give me something.
I need to put one of Maggie's brothers at the nightclub.
I'm working as fast as I can, boss.
half of these bottles need to be reconstructed in order to get a print off them, and as far as DNA goes, um, well, to be honest with you, those robots wouldn't really help.
these are all completed?
Yeah, I'm running them through AFIS as we speak.
if you get a hit, call me immediately.
Absolutely.
what they did to Maggie pushed you over the edge.
and you weren't going to let them get away with it.
sometimes, even scumbag lawyers have a heart.
nine times out of ten, I feel like jumping across this table and ringing the person's neck, you know.
I have to admit, right now I'm torn.
I almost feel like buying you a beer.
I'm just throwing this out there, but killing your clients can't be good for business.
right?
I mean, how do you expect to get referrals?
you and your co-counsel met back in 2001 working at Legal Aid.
city attorneys are required to be fingerprinted.
those prints are still on record.
they're also on a shot glass that we found on the table next to Michael Jones' body.
I'm guessing you had to steel your nerves.
the guns...
when the print came back to you, I kept asking myself how you got hold of the murder weapon.
then it hit me.
they gave them to you.
handing the gun to an attorney was the safest place.
Jake Donovan couldn't reveal that he had it, it's privileged information, so he shoved it in a drawer.
but when his office was fumigated the other day, we found trace amounts of a pesticide containing limonene on one of the guns -
the gun they gave to you.
these are your phone records.
every day for the past two weeks you called your client at 8: 00 a. m. presumably to remind him to get his ass out of bed and get to court.
but the day the trial started, you didn't call.
now I wonder why that is.
every other case was about some dope dealer killing some dope fiend or...
someone getting killed over whose corner was whose.
so when they said don't worry about a witness or that witness disappeared,
I never gave it a second thought.
one less crackhead on the streets looking to rob some old lady for a fix.
Yeah, b-but that girl...
you talk the other two into it?
I didn't have to talk anybody into anything.
she was still going to testify.
did you know that?
she was going to do the right thing.
I suppose a confession is too much to ask for?
I may have a heart, I'm not stupid, Detective.
you know what the great thing about all this is?
right now there's a young, cocky, naive lawyer, just like I was, and I'll work the system and I'll get off.
I'll walk.
can you honestly tell me I shouldn't?
yo, boss.
Danny, what's up?
I put in for that vacation next month.
that's right-- the trip to Costa Rica.
Yeah, Costa Rica.
well, it fell through, so you can put me back on the schedule, all right?
all right, I'll do that.
just let me know when you want to take the time.
all right. Thanks.
Hey.
remember that wedding in Italy I told you about in March?
girlfriend from college?
very good.
well, they decided to postpone. So...
you want back on the schedule?
Yeah.
no problem.
Thanks.
Hey, Mac...
hold on.
don't tell me-- trip to San Francisco in January?
Yeah, turns out San Francisco is closed in January.
strangest thing.
get out of here.
go home.
I should've known you'd orchestrate something like this.
it's only temporary.
everybody giving up a week of paid vacation for Adam buys him a little time.
the department doesn't just transfer vacation days.
how did you do it?
I have a friend at the union who has a friend in the city council who has a friend, who has a friend.
Yeah, well, you're a good friend, Stella Bonasera.
and don't you forget that.
so what about Buenos Aires?
would've been a good trip.
you know, I know this nice little Argentinean restaurant down the block that might due.
great. You buying?
6 months ago, Providence, Rhode Island, Philip, I tried, i'm so sorry, I'll love you.
Oh, God!
Carrie, no!
double lattes, hot and ready.
Hey, what do you do, sugar in this?
or yellow?
I have a better idea for a wakeup call.
coffee's gonna get cold.
shut up.
that's my phone, isn't it?
damn it!
better get that.
don't make me cuff your other hand.
that's good work, Detective.
I got to get it, okay?
Yeah, go ahead.
sure. Send it.
what is it?
homicide around the corner.
some guy e-mailed a photo to the precinct tip line.
headquarters is forwarding it to me now.
you got to go.
Yeah, huh?
his name's Marshall Baxter.
he works here at the theater's vocal studio.
picture and address were e-mailed to the precinct's anonymous tip line.
traced the IP address to an internet cafe on the Upper West Side.
got a uni headed over there now.
looks like he took a bullet to the chest.
no stippling or GSR around the wound.
medium range.
no sign of a gun.
what kind of killer photographs his crime and then e-mails it to the cops?
a showoff.
someone who thinks he's smarter than us.
we're about to prove him wrong.
86 degrees.
puts TOD roughly eight hours ago.
right around midnight.
did you get anything?
no prints in the door handle.
looks like someone threw a punch right into this wall.
no bruises or lacerations on our vic's hands.
killer took the photo from right about here.
Hey, Mac, this is James Copeland.
he's the director of the theater.
said something happened?
what the hell? That's Marshall.
well, hang on a second there, bud.
this is my theater.
might be your theater, but it's my crime scene.
Marshall Baxter was our voice coach, and he also used that rehearsal space for private lessons.
who was here last night around midnight?
uh, nobody.
we did a rehearsal of Don Giovanni, 7:00 to 10: 00.
theater was empty by 11: 00.
where were you?
at a party with some of our actors.
got home around 2: 00.
bruise on your hand looks recent.
did you get that at the party?
maybe you took a shot at the wall.
come on, James. Don't make me ask twice.
okay.
Baxter parked in my spot every single day.
my spot.
with my name on it.
so you dropped by to give him a general reminder.
I tried to be reasonable with the guy.
it just got a little out of hand.
you're parked in my spot again.
move your car, or I'm gonna get a tow truck to do it for you.
you touch my car, you're gonna be parking in handicapped.
well, who could blame you?
a parking spot in this city's worth killing for.
true, but I didn't kill him.
we'll need a list of Baxter's clients and everyone who works here.
Hey, nobody here did this.
who's gonna shoot somebody in a theater?
did you ever hear of a guy named John Wilkes Booth?
Hey, uh, the police located the computer and keyboard from the Internet cafe on the Upper West Side where the photo was sent from.
find anything we can use? Prints? DNA?
too many donors to isolate a single profile.
could be why the killer e-mailed the photo from a public place.
that's smart, right?
Oh, I-I...I'm sorry.
I didn't mean, like-like he's smart smart.
I mean, like, he's...he's dumb and smart and...
look at the distortion fingerprint on the photo, see if you can figure out what kind of camera took it.
smart. Uh, s-smart.
the dirt we found at the crime scene-- Lapilli tephra.
volcanic ash?
from somewhere in the South Pacific.
which means it probably wasn't tracked in on the killer's shoes.
Yeah, and it wasn't his hair we found on the victim's shirt, either.
it's from a Himalayan yak.
used to make rugs, blankets, brushes.
volcanic ash and yak hair.
could be looking at someone in the import/export business or works in a museum, or who knows what else.
I'll be right there.
Marshall Baxter's COD was exsanguination due to a puncture in the aortic arch, and it appears our killer removed the bullet.
looks like he dug it out with some kind of sharp instrument.
why remove the bullet but leave all that other trace behind?
there's something else.
based on your TOD at the scene, Sheldon, he should be out of rigor by now, but as you can see, he's not.
so, then, the body must have been exposed to cold postmortem?
crime scene was room temp when we got there, no A/C.
is it possible your reading was off? No offense.
Sid, I double-checked.
liver temp put him at 86 degrees.
there was no error.
okay.
there's another option.
somehow, someone deliberately lowered the body temp of our vic.
Hey, Brooklyn Bruisers, what do the asphalt trace, and motor oil have in common?
they all are found in the game of bike polo.
okay.
same as regular polo, except they ride bikes instead of horses.
they put these cards in the spokes to identify who they are on the court.
what's with the number on the back?
I'm thinking that may be a link between bike polo and murder.
give it a ring.
hello.
welcome to the Rejection Call Line.
the reason you're hearing this recorded greeting is because the person who gave you this phone number wants nothing to do with you.
to speak with a specialist who will guide you through this hard time of heartache and pain, press 1.
okay. The Rejection Call Line?
hell of a way to give somebody the slip, huh?
Yeah. I guess our vic asked out the wrong girl.
I'm not so sure it was our vic who got the brush-off.
a team photo of the Brooklyn Bruisers.
there's no Marshall Baxter in sight.
then who's #2?
uh, we'd like to borrow him for a second.
sure.
this is him.
Nope, never seen him.
how about this?
this spoke card belong to you?
I don't, uh... no, I don't... I don't think so.
you don't seem so sure about that,#2.
Yeah, we found this in a murder victim's pocket.
look, I've never seen that guy, and I don't have a clue how he got my spoke card, okay?
you just said that wasn't your spoke card.
you know, maybe we should take him in.
no, no, just-just wait. Just give me a second.
look, I've seen this girl around campus.
chelsea University.
the other day, I see her on the street. I ask her for her number.
she writes it on the back of my spoke card.
but I never called her-- I swear. - Whatever.
no, babe. I swear I never called her
might want to buy her some flowers.
okay, but what does all this have to do with the man in the photo?
after she gave me her number, that guy in the picture comes running at me from across the street.
he rips the card from my hand and starts yelling at me to stay away from his girlfriend.
stay the hell away from my girlfriend.
that girl-- what's her name?
I don't know her last name.
look, all I know is that she goes to Chelsea University and she's hot.
what do you want from me?
all right, Romeo.
if you see her, you tell her we're looking for her.
no, as a matter of fact, why don't you give her my number?
based on theateral chromatic aberration, the e-mail photo was taken with a Blackberry.
now, if I had the phone in front of me, I could tell if the photo was taken with it.
without it...not so much.
that the breakdown on the ceramic chip we found at the crime scene?
Yeah, found trace elements of rubidium, strontium, and zirconium.
looks like you got a lot of background CO2 on that calibration curve.
Yeah, but it's not the ceramic piece itself.
it's the ambient air trapped inside the vial.
the CO2 levels at the crime scene were elevated somehow.
dry ice.
that's what did it.
high levels of CO2, plus a decrease in body temperature, could be caused by dry ice.
Yeah, I,uh... yeah.
dry ice.
well, that would certainly explain why rigor was prolonged.
and why Sheldon's TOD was off.
and best of all, it would explain these little red discolorations I found on Baxter's chest.
first glance, I thought dermatitis.
now I'm thinking contact burns.
one of science's many ironies.
ice can burn.
using dry ice, how long would it take to lower body temp from 98 to 86 degrees?
all right, with roughly 25 pounds packed around the core, I would say less than three hours.
and in that time, the ice would have sublimated into gas, leaving no sign it was ever there.
so, our killer wanted us to think the time of death was earlier than it actually was.
that's why he tipped us off with the anonymous photo and address.
he wanted to be sure we'd find the body before the effects wore off.
removing the bullet from the body, manipulating body temperature.
why go through all that trouble?
we could be looking at someone with a background in forensics, someone who'd know enough to be able to manipulate the crime scene.
what does that say about the yak hair, the volcanic ash, and the ceramic chip?
that we can't trust them.
could have all been left behind deliberately for us to find.
all right, if that's true, how are we going to determine which evidence is real and what was planted?
we can start by asking ourselves "What, if anything, do all these things have in common?
what connects them?
I think I know the connection.
it's me.
I was a guest lecturer at a forensics class at Chelsea University about two months ago.
I used examples from past cases to show what it is we do.
and those examples have been duplicated in the Baxter murder.
every single one of them.
it's all here in my syllabus.
here you go.
this, animal hair, and this, geological matter, and this, inorganic compounds.
now, I think the empty wallet was also staged to make it look like a robbery.
well, that eliminates everything we collected at the crime scene.
that's exactly the point.
the evidence was designed to send us on a wild goose chase.
and that leaves us with nothing we can be sure of.
remember the mummy we discovered in the Varick Building?
we believe it's Pauline Rayburn.
clothing fits the description of the last thing she was wearing before she went missing over three weeks ago.
killer positioned her next to the AC, which created the artificial environment that mummified her.
right.
now, I used that case to show how environmental elements can alter our estimation of TOD.
as you can see, fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and ventilation can all affect the body's natural rate of decomposition.
and Sara Jackson, the model we found impaled at the Soho Regency Hotel.
we found a camel hair on her thigh.
camel hair?
what are camel hairs doing on our vic's thigh?
so, the camel hair we found on this victim's thigh came from a photographic lens brush, which led us to suspect a photographer.
there's more: Lauren Redgrave was murdered because her neighbor wanted her apartment.
well, he put arsenic in her tea.
but that's not how we put him at the scene.
it was meteorite dust.
I used that example to show how even the most out-of-context trace can break a case.
but it's always a race against time.
we have to identify the context and origin of the evidence before we identify the suspect.
the longer it takes to name a suspect...
the harder it is to find him.
Stella, check the records at Chelsea University.
see if you can find a connection between Marshall Baxter and one of your students.
you know, the bike polo guy said that Baxter had a girlfriend at Chelsea University.
Odessa.
I don't know her last name.
right.
if she was one of your students, she just moved to the top of the suspect list.
Sheldon, swing by Baxter's apartment.
look through his personal effects.
maybe you can make a connection that way.
okay.
Danny, we'll stay with the evidence we have.
yeah,'cause even if it was planted, he had to get it from somewhere.
we know he used large quantities of dry ice.
I'll start there.
okay.
Mr. Copeland, who else has access to the dry ice?
dry ice?
the thing that makes that white smoky stuff.
I know this may be out of your wheelhouse, but we're doing a little opera by Mozart.
it's called Don Giovanni.
now, there's a scene in that that requires fog.
watch the attitude, Mr. Copeland.
the cemetery scene with Commendatore.
look, I'll admit it.
I-I didn't care for Marshall.
he was a stubborn, moody, self-centered hack.
nobody here liked him.
why do you keep coming back to me?
because you punched a hole in his wall; you were here the night of the murder;
and you had access to the crime scene.
now, I know it's out of your wheelhouse, but to us, that makes you a suspect.
I already told you I was at a party.
we now have evidence that Baxter was murdered several hours later than we originally thought.
where were you at 5: 00 in the morning?
nursing a hangover from that party.
can anyone verify that?
Yeah, my cat.
that wouldn't happen to be a Blackberry, would it?
Yeah, why?
cause someone took a photo of our vic after they put a bullet in him.
maybe that someone was you.
that's insane.
I hope you have someone changing Fluffy's litter box, 'cause if you're lying, you'll be going away for a while.
I got you a copy of your class roster.
I don't see anyone named Odessa on it.
doesn't mean she didn't take the class.
a lot of students audit without even bothering to register.
I keep trying to remember the faces, and I just can't.
it's all such a blur.
well, if it's any consolation, I have been doing this...for over 30 years.
you never remember the faces.
Well...maybe a few.
it's just so disturbing to think that someone would attend one of my lectures just to learn how to get away with murder.
what students take away from a class is up to them, Stella.
you cannot blame yourself.
you are a gifted teacher.
that's why I convinced you to do the lecture in the first place, remember?
I should really let you go.
looks like Baxter was a real packrat.
you think this is bad, you should see Adam's place.
maybe there's something here that can tell us why somebody wanted him dead.
phone bill...
receipts, mail.
you find something?
maybe.
all these photos are the same two women.
looks of things, I don't think they knew they were being photographed.
more like surveillance photos.
like they were being watched.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
could be Marshall Baxter's a stalker.
and these could be his victims.
I'll run 'em through NCIC, see if anyone filed a complaint.
all right.
well, you were right.
Baxter was arrested four years ago in Providence, Rhode Island for aggravated assault.
sounds like stalking to me.
Ah, he got slapped with five days of community service and a restraining order.
and that didn't seem to slow him down.
he was arrested again a week later for criminal contempt in the first degree.
okay, so he must have violated the restraining order.
and for that, the judge gave him eight days in jail.
eight days. Hell of a deterrent.
problem is although stalking may be a crime, the things stalkers do are perfectly legal.
you know, there's no laws against taking pictures, sending e-mails, or using the phone.
Yeah, but it's just wrong.
people have the right to walk down the street and feel safe.
Hey, I spend every day of my life trying to fix that.
I know.
we put away the bad guys, but what about the victims?
who fixes them?
my ex-girlfriend, Kiera-- perfect example.
she was raped.
and afterwards, everything changed.
she was afraid, cautious.
she lost a part of herself.
and then I lost her.
sorry about that.
we know who filed the complaint against Baxter?
no, not yet. I gotta call in to Providence PD.
I'm just waiting to hear back on a name.
let me know as soon as you hear something.
Yeah.
her name's Carrie Langdon.
she filed a restraining order against Baxter four years ago in Rhode Island.
could she have been one of Stella's forensics students?
she's not our killer, Mac.
Carrie committed suicide about six months ago.
it's not a total wash, though.
according to Rhode Island police, her brother recently filed a lawsuit against them.
for failure to protect.
he blames them for his sister's suicide.
Carrie! No!
maybe he decided to finish what the law couldn't.
providence, Rhode Island back
but maybe it'll change the system.
protect other women.
Mr. Langdon, I'm sorry.
I know that your sister's suicide must be a terrible weight to bear.
I don't think of it as suicide.
I think of it as murder.
Carrie might have jumped off the ledge, but Marshall Baxter put her there.
according to this restraining order, Baxter began stalking your sister four years ago.
Carrie took a voice lesson from him.
an somehow in his twisted mind, that meant she was his girlfriend.
I convinced her to file that.
thought it would scare him off.
but I was wrong.
it made it worse.
he started threatening her.
she was terrified to go outside, to answer her phone.
and how long that go on for?
two yes.
and then one day.
it suddenly stopped.
it was like a miracle.
he was gone.
Carrie could breathe again.
she could live her life without having to look over her shoulder.
that's what I thought anyway.
till she jumped.
Carrie! No!
she never recovered from the stalking.
the cops claimed they couldn't arrest Baxter until he committed an act of violence.
an act of violence?
what do you call destroying someone's soul?
some would call it motive.
I wondered why you came all the way up here from New York City to discuss a suicide.
I thought about killing Baxter.
I admit it.
didn't have the guts, I guess.
then you won't mind telling me where you were last night?
at a restaurant opening here in Providence.
spent the night at my girlfriend's.
did you ever take a class or attend a lecture at Chelsea University in New York?
we're done here.
I haven't set foot inside a school since Carried graduated five years ago.
now, if you're going to arrest me go ahead; otherwise you can contact my attorney.
Mr. Langdon...
I am truly sorry for your loss.
I have a sister, too, so.
don't ever take that for granted.
okay, thanks.
that was Adam.
James Copeland's Blackberry did not take the photo that was e-mailed to the tip line.
he's off the hook.
along with all the students that registered for my lecture.
I tracked down all 19 of them.
I take it you couldn't tie any of them to Baxter.
not one, but I did find something else.
Manhattan Natural History Museum.
Elsea University.
this catalog have something to do with your forensics lecture?
indirectly, yes.
uh... turn to page 32.
museum gift shop sells souvenirs of volcanic ash from Hawaii.
keep going.
gold ceramic bowls from Thailand.
just like the ceramic chip we found.
any chance the museum also has Life-size a Himalayan animal exhibit?
with real hair.
Angell's on her way there now.
she's going to go to talk to some of the museum employees and check into recent credit card purchases.
we've got evidence from the four corners of the world, and all the killer had to do was go up to 77th Street to get it.
doc. - Yo.
Boston PD just called.
a woman up there named Dana Melton filed a restraining order against Baxter.
was she at Stella's class?
uh, wasn't registered, but Boston's trying to locate her now.
but in the meantime, we can log on to their Web site and download the case file, and an MP3 of her statement.
sounds like they got everything but the chowder.
here we go.
she filed the first restraining order two years ago.
click on her audio file there upper right-hand corner.
when I was 17, I won a radio contest for a song I wrote in high school.
I got a demo CD, had some labels interested in me.
then about two years ago,
I took a few voice lessons from Marshall Baxter, and it all fell apart.
he started sending me letters, postcards, e-mails, calling me.
seven to 80 times a day.
can you imagine living like that?
no. Sounds like Carrie Langdon's story.
Carrie took a voice lesson from him.
hetarted threatening her.
she was terrified to go outside, to answer her phone.
hopefully this one has a different ending.
Yeah.
let see what else we got.
I've seen her picture fore.
hold on a minute.
is this the same woman?
the hair's different, but the eyes, the nose, the face looks like the same woman to me.
if it is the same woman, she just became a person of interest.
we got an address?
ston PD can't track her down and I can't find her in Social Security or any one of our regular databases.
not on any mailing lists, no credit cards.
she was being stalked.
she probably didn't want to be found.
I don't blame her.
I mean, being hunted like that, someone watching your every move.
this Baxter's a sick pup.
I spoke to Carrie Langdon's brother.
he said that she met Baxter once, and he was convinced that she was his girlfriend.
Hey, that's funny,'cause the bike polo player said Baxter referred to Odessa in that same way.
as his girlfriend.
you stay the hell away from my girlfriend.
this will only take a second.
last time you guys said that it cost me my girlfriend.
this is a homicide investigation, not a dating service.
see this girl? Do you recognize her?
Yeah, that's Odessa.
you're sure about that?
positive.
all right, we need you to tell us everything you know about her.
there's not much to tell. I barely know her.
okay, do you know what classes she was taking at Chelsea?
I have no clue.
did she ever say where she lived, job, anything?
no.
look, I remember her saying something about a singing gig once.
didn't say where.
look, guys, can I go now? I got a match.
Yeah. Go ahead.
he follows me everywhere.
won't leave me alone.
I go to the bookste.
he's there.
I go out to lunch with my friends; he's, he's at the next table.
last week I came home and he was in front of my apartment.
I even had to quit my job 'cause he kept following me there.
Gavin Skidmore confirmed that Dana Melton and Odessa are the same person.
please tell me you can do something.
anything, please, I...
what is that?
it's Melton's taped statement to Boston PD.
play it again.
please tell me you can do something.
anything, please, I...
I don't know how to stop him.
I know that voice.
when you walk into a crime scene, how can you tell what evidence to process?
good question.
you should certainly process anything that looks out of place or things that are close to the victim's body.
now, sometimes evidence can point you towards the wrong killer or no killer at all.
it's Odessa.
you sure?
Yeah, I mean, call her Dana, Odessa, whatever.
I recognize her voice.
she was in my class.
she must have audited the course.
so Dana Melton changed her name to Odessa and moved from Boston to Manhattan to start a new life.
Baxter followed her here, started stalking her again, but this time, instead of turning to law enforcement for help, she took matters into her own hands.
she killed him.
and I taught her how.
we distributed her photo to every airport, train station, and bus terminal, but I think we have enough to start with right here.
mac, we got nothing but a Dana Melton in Boston who became an Odessa in New York and a bunch of whacked-out evidence.
we have to stop looking at Marshall Baxter as a victim and start seeing him as a perp.
lucky for us, he was a pack rat, so let's start with the receipts and paperwork we found in his apartment.
Baxter was staing Odessa, which means he went where she went.
all right, so we use Baxter's receipts to create a geographical profile of his movements.
which hopefully leads us to Odessa herself.
we know he lived in Chelsea.
anything outside that area could be his stalking zone.
we already have a few known variables.
we know that Odessa took Stella's course at Chelsea University.
that's 86th and Amsterdam.
internet cafe at 73rd and Columbus, where she e-mailed the photo.
here's something.
looks like Baxter had lunch twice last week at Tresoro Cafe, which is on 95th and West End.
it's nowhere near his home.
follow the hunter, find the prey.
Odessa Shaw-- been living here going on a year.
keeps to herself mostly.
said some loony was stalking her.
she ever have any trouble with him here?
we got a doorman 24/7.
they get paid to head off that kind of trouble.
Odessa. NYPD.
Dana Melton, open up.
she paid extra for these deadbolts.
well, I can't say that I like what she's done with the place.
when did she move out?
I didn't know she did.
come to think of it, her mail's been piling up.
let's go.
I'll go talk to the doorman.
junk mail, local newspapers, restaurant menus.
did you find her?
her apartment is cleaned out, no forwarding address.
here's a bank statement and something from her dry cleaners maybe.
no, the bank's got to be closed by now.
as a valued customer, save ten percent on your next visit.
dry cleaners may still be open; I'm gonna head over there.
see if Flack got anything from the doorman on your way out.
okay.
mac, you better take a look at these.
they tell me you're afraid of me.
how can that be? I would never hurt you, Dana.
I'll never let you go.
you think you have a new life?
you won't have it much longer if you keep ignoring me.
that's a promise.
15 and counting.
here's another one.
you're not running away from me again.
I saw you with those moving boxes today.
moving boxes.
if we're lucky, the box company may have moved her as well.
could give us an address.
nearest one's around 74th and Broadway.
you are mine, bitch, and that's final.
nobody has the right to do this to another person, nobody.
let's swing by that box company.
what do you think our chances are she's still in the city?
she was smart enough to move out of her apartment before she killed Baxter.
probably smart enough to leave town as well.
part of me hopes so.
Sheldon, sometimes the line isn't as clear as we'd like it to be, but it's still there, and Odessa crossed it.
she had a choice.
Yeah. Suicide or murder.
mac, come take a look at this flyer.
one of the photos in Baxter's apartment was taken right outside this building.
live music nightly.
the bike polo player said Odessa had a singing gig somewhere.
Jersey.
what happens now?
I think you know the answer to that.
you could just let me walk out of here, please.
you don't know what I've been through.
I was so scared.
I tried to start over to change everything.
I know you don't understand, not really.
I do understand, Dana.
I understand it all, but I have to arrest you anyway.
it's the toughest part of my job.
I thought I did everything right.
you came very close.
you had a good teacher.
you left no prints, no DNA, no witnesses.
just circumstantial evidence.
in fact, without a formal confession, it will be very hard to win a conviction.
let's go.
a man just attacked me in my office.
no, I'm... I'm fine.
you need to call my attorney and get over here quick.
he's dead.
he's gone.
so Dunbrook, you didn't see anyone take the body?
detective, I told you no.
I'm telling you, one minute he's there, the next... I don't know.
what about a description?
hair color, eye color?
did you see anything before he went out the window?
he was a white guy, medium build... about your size.
I don't know. It's hard to remember the details when somebody's trying to kill you.
Dunbrook... you're telling us you threw a man out the window and didn't see anything?
isn't this a little below your pay grade, Taylor?
wasting all your valuable time on a simple breaking and entering?
what's next?
a mugging?
purse snatching?
if it involves a potential homicide, sure.
you're saying this is a simple B & E, and I'm not seeing the evidence of that.
well, I walk in my door, the guy comes out of nowhere.
he attacks me and... it ended badly.
Flack said there were no reports of anyone running, walking, limping or even crawling away from the scene.
a guy falls 20 stories onto a public street and no one saw anything?
it's the middle of the night, Financial District-- it's a ghost town.
so far, seems Dunbrook's our only witness.
it looks like we've got brain matter.
so given the height of the fall, force of the impact, diameter of the spatter, there's no way the vic could have survived.
so where is he?
a man falls 20 stories, walks away.
boy, that'd make a good headline, sell a lot of newspapers.
media Mogul Pushes Him might sell more.
state of the art biometric system cost half a mil to put in.
still, someone gets in and almost kills my dad.
how long have you been head of security?
five years.
we've never had anyone try to break in before.
maybe this wast a break-in.
what do you mean?
you said this biometric lock system works on fingerprint recognition, right?
so maybe the guy who got into your father's office was already in your system.
Connor, would you tell these people this isn't necessary?
dad, please.
press down firmly.
do you have any idea who'd want to kill you?
well, Taylor, I own 18 publications, four television stations, a few city blocks -
it's hard to get in my position without pissing some people off.
any recent threats?
Yeah.
but let me ask you a question and tell me the truth.
what are you really doing here?
what, are you looking for a P. R. bump or a little raise in salary, rank?
did your attacker say anything to you?
no. He was the silent, violent type.
mac, well, it looks like the only prints on the biometric lock are Mr. Dunbrook's.
it's my office.
no foreign prints?
no, nothing.
no streaks or oil on the lock indicating it's been wiped down, but the weird thing is, it smelled like strawberries.
you eat anything on the way in?
toast?
fruit?
caviar on a jelly doughnut, maybe?
no.
Mr. Dunbrook... we need to know who was programmed into your biometric lock system.
I'm sure my son told you, that's confidential information.
so, I'm sorry, Detective, but you're out of luck.
you're claiming somebody tried to kill you.
why not cooperate with our investigation instead of obstructing it?
I've given you my prints, my DNA, my time.
but I'm a newspaper man.
my father has sources to protect.
that include whoever took the body?
come on, Taylor.
I'm the innocent man here.
an innocent man calls 911 first.
you called your son, and then your lawyer.
we only have your prints on the biometric lock.
there's no evidence that anybody else touched it.
so, that leads me to believe that the man who went out the window entered this office with you.
a discussion turned into an argument.
and ultimately, you gave him a different view of the city.
those are hazy facts, at best.
I'd check them out before I ran with that story.
you don't have to worry about that.
we will.
got a couple of teeth.
a bicuspid...
incisor.
our vic probably hit chin first, force knocked them right out.
now, the blood over here is inconsistent with the spatter pattern.
there is a slight tread mark.
possibly from the toe of shoes.
it's an odd angle, though.
it's as if somebody tapped our vic's bloody feet onto the sidewalk.
first piece of evidence that someone removed the body; but why?
maybe our vic's identity incriminated his accomplice.
I-I just...I don't see any drag marks, footprints -
there's no evidence to indicate somebody else was here.
Yeah, but there's got to be.
officer Liu?
you okay?
Yeah, yeah, hold on. You got to wait for it.
for what?
a polar bear in the middle of New York City.
global warming's worse than I thought.
it's trash bag art.
basically, people create all kinds of creatures--dogs, giraffes...
they tie them to the subway grates and passing trains fill them with life.
this... print here...
could be evidence of our accomplice.
maybe.
car could have driven up, got into the backseat, opened the passenger door, but as he dragged the body, got caught up on the bag, leaving the bloody print, loaded the body, and then drove off.
you know what they say.
one man's trash is another person's art.
or another woman's evidence.
so I hear our only witness is a polar bear?
Yeah, a very uncooperative polar bear.
this hand print is fragmented.
fingerprints are smudged.
it's going to take a little time.
so it looks like the attack weapon, no prints.
but I did find traces of sucrose on the handle.
sugar, huh?
what else you got?
well, we got a biometric lock that smells like strawberries.
I don't know, maybe Dunbrook pissed off a pastry chef?
maybe. Because nothing in this case adds up.
we've got a guy who gets into an ultra-secure building, bypasses a biometric lock and attacks Dunbrook with nothing more than a tool you can get at a hardware store.
well, maybe the box cutter was for something else.
the subpoena came through for the information on Dunbrook's biometric lock system.
now correct me if I'm wrong here, but the attacker who hit the pavement and went missing, we know that was a guy, right?
DNA confirmed male.
okay, because according to the lock's electronic record, the last person to enter Dunbrook's office five minutes before he did...
was a woman.
that can't be right.
there were no prints on that lock other than Dunbrook's.
it wasn't wiped down prior to him touching it.
and man or woman, it's not possible to access the lock without leaving any prints behind.
it is if you're Ann Steele.
Ann had access to people a lot more powerful than me.
her business card said she was a consultant.
you sure we have the right woman?
Ann Steele, 35 years old-- fix the problems for the rich and famous.
and she was murdered seven months ago.
this is Harbor Division India-Alpha-Five-Niner.
we've recovered the body in the vicinity of Pier 40.
we'll be touching down momentarily.
Hey, Harbor Division Police called it in.
I think this might be the guy that attacked Dunbrook.
injuries are consistent with a significant fall.
no chance he's a jumper-- maybe from a bridge?
I don't think so.
glass fragments most likely came from him crashing through a window.
the facial injuries suggest he collided with something hard.
subway grate.
looks like he hit face-first.
this type of trauma indicates that he may have been slightly vertical when he fell.
since most dead bodies fall horizontally, he was must likely alive when he went through the window.
supports Dunbrook's version of the events.
suspect fell through the window during the struggle.
somebody did a pretty thorough job searching his clothes.
I take it we didn't get an I. D. on him?
pockets were already turned out when he was pulled from the water.
don't expect to get anything from fingerprints.
take a look.
it looks like his fingertips were snipped off.
whoever dumped him definitely wanted his I. D. to remain a mystery.
facial reconstruction will take some time, but I brought the vic's last meal.
it was ingested very close to T. O.D.
that could help us determine where he was before he broke into Dunbrook's office.
Yeah, I'm not sure what they're made of, but they did give off a distinct strawberry scent.
Danny mentioned smelling the same scent at Dunbrook's office.
maybe some type of candy?
I see ridge detail there.
what kind of candy has a fingerprint?
you found Ann Steele's fingerprints in the vic's stomach?
our attacker's last meal was made up of gelatin, sugar and strawberry flavor.
all you'd need to do is get a good set of Ann Steele's prints, create a 3-D mold...
pour in the gelatin, let it harden and voila, an all-access pass.
the chemical makeup of the gelatin would allow the intruder's body heat to seep through, but prevent any oils or epithelials from being left behind.
right, plus the sugar prints wouldn't have left any discernible ridge detail on the glass.
and once the attacker gained access, he ate the evidence.
that explains why Danny smelled strawberry on the biometric locks and found sugar on the box cutter and how a dead woman opened that door.
seems to support Dunbrook's story that somebody broke into his office.
the question is, where'd find Ann Steele's fingerprints to make a mold in the first place?
here you go. - Thanks.
what is it?
Flack red-flagged Dunbrook's financials.
Ann Steele used to be on his payroll.
okay, that makes sense.
she's a fixer, and Dunbrook's the type to pay someone like Steele.
maybe she was working with him to shut down somebody he had a problem with.
or that person had a problem with Dunbrook and Steele never had a chance to finish her job.
the chief.
good luck.
I would like Taylor removed from the case.
Mr. Dunbrook, I guarantee you there's no vendetta here.
well, he's digging into my bank accounts, my personal investments.
I mean, hell... I mean, he's treating me like I'm a suspect.
if that were the case, we'd all be having this conversation downstairs in interrogation.
isn't it true, Taylor, that, uh...
you just don't like anybody who' got more power than you do?
what I don't like is someone who thinks he can buy the department with a $20 million donation.
mac, no one buys anything here.
now watch what you imply about the department.
especially when it's not true.
we're not for sale.
well, somebody breaks into my office and they try to kill me.
now what part of that reality suggests that I'm anything other than a victim?
why don't we start with the part you left out?
your relationship with Ann Steele.
what does she have to do with this case?
her prints were used to access his security system.
and the fact that she's dead is a little curious.
well, Steele sometimes worked for me as a consultant.
I guess, her... her identity wasn't removed from the security system, I suppose.
look... a dead body was taken from the streets.
now I am no detective, but that probably means there's somebody still out there that wants to kill me.
so why don't you stop harassing me and spend a little more time trying to solve the case?
tread lightly on this one.
the city and the mayor aren't my problem.
solving this case is.
what's going on, Mac?
everything I've seen on this case points to self-defense.
Dunbrook isn't cooperating with the investigation.
it's his word against a dead man's.
look, I don't like the game any more than you do, but we're still going to play it.
you find something that sets off that man, make sure I'm in the loop.
last night, a man whose identity has yet to be determined tried to kill me in my office.
his accomplice, who is still at large, removed the body from the scene.
I'll take your questions.
Mr. Dunbrook, what about that body?
you have anything to do with its disappearance?
no. I have no idea what happened to the man who attacked me.
the police have made this case a priority, and I can sense their presence at every turn.
is that because you bought them with $20 million?
well, that was a donation I made to the city on behalf of its residents, my neighbors.
I don't expect, nor do I warrant, any special consideration regardless of my special relationship with the mayor.
everybody down, now!
which way?!
get down!
get down!
you hit?
no, I'm fine.
secure that building across the street.
get down.
I told you I'm okay.
I'm okay, everybody.
it's all right.
you still think I have something to hide?
I think you're a lucky man.
do your job.
bullet's a . 38.
it's pretty damaged.
may be able to find some usable stria.
any word from Flack?
Yeah. He's checking surveillance and running plates.
it's very strange-- nobody saw the shooter.
or convenient.
mac, Dunbrook may have thrown somebody out the window, but he certainly didn't shoot at himself.
I know, but my gut tells me he's hiding something.
whatever his involvement, there's a very real possibility that whoever took that body may still want Dunbrook dead.
we need I. D. on our vic.
mac, I finally managed to put together the bloody prints Stella found on the polar bear.
and I ran it.
you sure this is right?
Yeah, the guy who took the body from the crime scene's FBI.
Hawkes, stop what you're doing and let me see what you have right now.
I've seen him before.
I've seen both these guys before.
this guy, the guy Dunbrook threw out his window...
he's FBI, too.
agents Walsh and Johnson approached me at the armored car heist six months ago.
they wanted to know about Ann Steele's flash drive.
well, you obviously know something I don't about what's going on here, so now that you've scooped me out of a crime scene, why don't you tell me what the hell that is?
the drive contained some extremely sensitive information about some very important people, some at the highest levels of government.
but you knew that.
Steele was killed over the information on that drive.
when it was in our possession, I got a look at it.
I can think of a few tabloid editors who'd kill for it, too.
sexual allegations, bribery, blackmail.
you name it, Steele was into it.
when we recovered the drive, it went into the property warehouse and was stolen.
and the theft of the flash drive was an inside job.
vin Cross, a property clerk, took it.
and then he turned up dead.
.38 slug in his forehead.
Ann Steel's flash drive nowhere to be found.
Walsh and Johnson were across the street surveilling Cross' murder investigation.
the FBI has the resources to get a hold of Ann Steele's prints and to engineer them out of gelatin, but why would they illegally break into Dunbrook's office and attack him?
the box cutter.
like you said, Danny, maybe it was for something else.
I don't think Walsh went into Dunbrook's office to attack him.
he and Johnson were looking for something;
the same thing they were looking for when they picked me up.
Ann Steele's flash drive.
why did the FBI think Dunbrook had it?
and why do they want it?
let's ask them.
I have evidence that Agent Walsh broke into Robert Dunbrook's office and attacked him.
after Walsh fell to his death,
I believe his partner, Agent Johnson, removed his body from the crime scene, and then cut off his fingertips to prevent a positive I. D.
you want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
well, that all sounds like speculation to me, Detective.
Oh, except for one thing.
agent Walsh is in our morgue.
Where's Johnson?
I don't know.
and I can't speak to why those agents were in Mr. Dunbrook's office.
you guys investigating Dunbrook?
do you have evidence that he took Ann Steele's flash drive?
this is the first I've heard of a flash drive.
and I don't know anything about Ann Steele.
whatever Walsh and Johnson were doing, it wasn't official FBI business.
they were fired six months ago.
Why?
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
one of your agents is dead.
another one could have taken a shot at Robert Dunbrook.
former agents.
you useless son of a bitch.
you're protecting yourself.
I'm gonna find out what those two agents have to do with my case, and if I happen to expose whatever the FBI is trying to hide...
that's on you.
you get anything from the bullet I found at the press confence?
no, it's too damaged.
no way to run it through IBIS.
what about Johnson's location?
Flack's got two unis on his house and an APB out on his car.
you still think that Walsh and Johnson went after Dunbrook to get the flash drive?
Yeah, but why would Dunbrook want it?
mac, I went back and I tried to remember everything I could from Ann Steele's flash drive.
then I cross-referenced that info against the stories that were published in Dunbrook's paper The New York Ledger.
mac, there were seven stories that matched.
Dunbrook knew what Ann Steele kept on that drive.
dirt on the rich and famous, politicians, government.
it's an invaluable source to a newspaperman.
the only problem is these stories don't prove that Dunbrook is in possession of the drive.
for all we know, he could have bought the information from Ann Steele when she was alive.
it's possible.
but look at the dates.
all these stories were published after Steele and Cross were killed.
so Dunbrook could have paid whoever stole the drive for the information, or he's in possession of the drive himself.
he was the only witness to what happened in his office.
and maybe he discovered that Walsh was looking for the drive.
how'd you get in my office?
the flash drive.
give it to me or I'll tell everybody you have it.
I want you to get the hell out of my office.
we could be looking at Dunbrook for manslaughter.
and if he does have possession of the drive, he may have had something to do with the murder of the property clerk, Kevin Cross.
Dunbrook could be behind this whole story.
Hey, what you got there?
the future of Dunbrook Media.
I recovered this at the crime scene in Dunbrook's office.
the LCD is like an electronic billboard.
you can have three advertisements where you only normally could have one.
a real moneymaker, you know?
so I pulled the evidence from the Kevin Cross file, our property clerk.
now, he was shot with a Smith & Wesson . 38 Special.
and look at the trace we collected from his wound.
battery acid, polyethylene, black dye, titanium dioxide.
there's about a thousand uses for this stuff.
make it a thousand and one.
it's also used in electronic ink technology.
e-ink for short.
Dunbrook's company's been doing the tech on this magazine cover for the last year.
the LCD contains microcapsules, okay, that are filled with charged particles of either black dye or titanium oxide.
now, the trace that we collected from Kevin Cross' bullet wound's an exact match to the E-Ink I pulled from my test copy.
I mean, how it got out of the magazine and onto Cross, I have no idea.
what if our killer used the magazine to hide the gun?
then the bullet grazed it just before it went into Cross.
and that's how the E-Ink trace transferred.
I don't buy Dunbrook as the shooter.
I mean, he'd definitely have somebody doing his dirty work for him.
unless it was personal.
let's say that Cross stole the flash drive for Dunbrook.
then he went to him for more money.
Dunbrook refused, so Cross threatened to rat him out.
the flash drive is the connection to all of this.
we need to find it.
trace from magazines?
newspaper articles?
you don't have enough evidence, and I think you know that.
we've gotten warrants with less. I think you know that.
not for Robert Dunbrook.
Mac... I trust you, but we need more.
talk to the DA.
put me in front of a sympathetic judge, and I'll do the rest.
look, the judge could be my uncle.
my forituncle.
by the time that warrant gets to his bench, someone will have already whispered in his ear.
that's called corruption.
call it whatever you like.
it's been going on in this town for a hundred years and will continue for another hundred.
now, we get one shot at a guy like Dunbrook.
you miss, it could mean both of our careers.
Hey, heard the Chief was a little stingy with the search warrant.
he needs more.
sounds like subtext for "play it safe.
I'm not gonna wait around while Sinclair decides his next political maneuver.
you looking for more connects between Dunbrook and the flash drive?
no, I'm looking for trace evidence.
the kind that won't fit in a petri dish.
okay, articles about Dunbrook's taxes, investment, business deals.
you're thinking Dunbrook may have made some small mistake and maybe some media source other than his own paper picked up on it?
there's more than one way to hook a fish.
they got Al Capone on tax evasion.
son of Sam was brought in on a parking ticket.
if we can't get Dunbrook on murder yet, we'll find something else to arrest him for.
mac, we already pulled his financials.
we didn't find anything suspicious.
on paper, the guy looks clean.
Dunbrook's reaction when he was shot at during his little press conference has been bothering me.
I was right next to him when the shot went off.
Dunbrook didn't even seem afraid or even surprised.
it wasn't an act, Hawkes.
no, he just stood up like some kind of king or god.
spoke to "the masses" as if no matter what happened, he wouldn't be brought down.
get down!
I told you I'm okay.
I'm okay, everybody!
the guy thinks he's untouchable.
keep working on this for me. See what you can find.
sure.
where are you going?
fishing.
so, what, did I get too many cops back to work?
are you so bored the only thing you got left to do is to stick me with an unsolved murder?
Ann Steele's flash dive was a valuable source of information and the man who attacked you, Agent Walsh, thought you had it.
what went down in your office wasn't a case of self-defense, it was aase of self-preservation.
don't know anything about a flash drive or...
was it "secret information"?
your headlines suggest otherwise.
where is it?
I don't know what you're talking about, Taylor.
but I'd invite you to look around if it would reassure you, but I see you came here empty-handed.
you got no warrant.
you killed a man to keep your secret quiet.
keep tap dancing, Taylor.
you're going to help me sell papers.
NYPD Harasses Benefactor,"NYPD Invades Privacy...
now, you get the hell out of my office, or I'll throw you out myself.
will I be going through the door or the window?
afternoon, Mr. Dunbrook.
a warrant to, uh, search the premises.
now, if you'll excuse us...
a Smith & Wesson . 38 Special.
just what I was looking for.
Dunbrook claims he was out of town at the time Cross was killed.
but so far, it's just his word.
what did you get on the gun?
degraded DNA.
I ran it against Dunbrook's reference sample.
it's a match.
what about ballistics?
that's where it gets a little weird.
Dunbrook's gun is the same make as our murder weapon -
a Smith & Wesson . 38 Special.
but the stria on the test fire bullet doesn't match the bullet that we pulled from Cross' body.
I know there's a connection here, I just have to find a way to prove it.
got it.
they found the missing FBI agent.
toll booth picked up Johnson's car headed across the Verrazano.
couple of my guys gave chase, but backed off once he headed for the expressway.
he asked for you.
can I talk to him?
agent Johnson, it's Detective Taylor.
we had to do it. We had no choice.
I don't understand.
the flash drive. Taylor, you remember.
the flash drive has everything.
but me and Walsh, we were set up.
sir, we need to get him out of the vehicle right now.
Deteive Taylor.
you're a little late if you want to talk to Johnson.
he died while they were pulling him out of the car.
I heard.
what's this?
it's what I couldn't give you before.
the truth.
a year ago, Walsh and Johnson were building a case against Steagle Tech for insider trading.
looks like they had enough for a trial, but before they could finalize their investigation, they became the focus of one.
well, it says here that a paper trail surfaced, suggesting that Walsh and Johnson had been falsifying documents.
they were fired.
and as a result, their credibility was destroyed and the case against Steagle dropped.
I'm thinking that Ann Steele was the one who manufactured the paper trail.
those agents must have known that Dunbrook had Steele's flash drive, went after it to clear their names.
Dunbrook wouldn't give it up.
instead, he got into a struggle and Walsh went out the window.
so he was just collateral damage.
just like the property clerk.
Dunbrook thought he could play us from the very beginning.
he thought he could buy this town...
and his own brand of justice along with it.
now he's got us cornered.
it's time to fight back.
what are you thinking?
I'm going to make sure Walsh and Johnson didn't die in vain.
so, someone scraped the barrel of Dunbrook's gun after shooting Kevin Cross.
it damaged the rifling.
makes a ballistics match difficult.
someone was thinking ahead. Smart.
now, I was a little smarter.
see, whatever tool was used, it didn't reach the back of the barrel.
so I made an imprint to match the undamaged stria in the barrel of Dunbrook's gun...
created a slug from that section of the gun, then compared it to the bullet that killed Kevin Cross.
and they were a match.
the bullet that killed Kevin Cross was fired from Dunbrook's gun.
we have got him.
not quite.
Flack just called.
Dunbrook's alibi checks out.
the night of Cross' murder, he was at Yale's New Media Symposium, speaking.
over 100 witnesses.
how's that possible?
the only DNA we've got on the gun is Dunbrook's.
so, how is Dunbrook's DNA not his DNA?
you need to take a closer look at the low level DNA on the gun, using miniSTRs which will allow us to amplify smaller loci.
making it possible to analyze more detail from the sample.
samples share common alleles at each locus.
we were looking at the wrong Dunbrook.
it's his son's DNA.
they're taking him now.
well, that's why I've got you on retainer, Counselor.
I want you to fix this.
Connor, you don't say a word. Not a word. You hear me?
step back, Mr. Dunbrook.
what, are you giving me orders?
he is. Back off.
anything on the flash drive?
no.
we searched Connor. Searched his apartment.
came up empty.
we got him on the murder of Kevin Cross.
you got nothing.
I got your son committing murder so you could sell papers.
and you're lucky I'm not pulling you in for obstruction.
that shot at the press conference? You set that up.
had Connor create a little diversion.
you wanted us to believe someone was after you.
Where's your proof?
you haven't got any.
people believe what they read, Taylor.
and after I'm done with you, you know what they're gonna know about you?
they're gonna know what you really are.
a lab rat with a little chip on his shoulder.
trust me, you are not equipped to win this war.
the Mayor can't save your son.
neither can your money.
at least you got what you wanted... tomorrow's headline.
500. Do I hear 520? $520, 000.
do I hear 540?
come on, ladies and gentlemen, have you ever seen anything like it?
not only unique but also patriotic.
and we have 540.
$580, 000 from the bidder on the phone.
can I get 600? Six to the lady.
620, anyone? $620, 000.
can I get 640? 640?
640, anyone?
ladies and gentlemen, it's your last chance at 640.
all right, 620, going once.
620 going twice.
wait, do I see 640 in back?
Oh, my God, he's bleeding!
Oh, my God.
looks like a gunshot wound to the stomach.
our vic's name is Xander Green.
he worked at the auction house as an appraiser for the last three years.
I want everyone who attended the auction tested for GSR.
that might be tough, Mac.
after our boy took a face plant and expired, half the guests hit the road, thinking this might be some kind of robbery.
what about witnesses?
anyone hear a gunshot?
everyone I spoke to said this room was in a feeding frenzy.
the only thing they heard was the sound of some rich guy getting ready to dump 600 large on a necklace.
on a piece of jewelry?
guess some people are recession-proof.
either that or they don't read the financial news because this was a full house and the bids started at a hundred grand.
so the auction house stood to make a killing.
they're not the only ones.
got a cell phone with an outgoing call in progress.
hello.
this is Detective Mac Taylor. Anyone there?
how long has it en active?
48 minutes.
okay,'cause according to witnesses, our vic dropped about 40 minutes ago.
so the call was made right around the shooting; means there may be a witness who heard something.
Flack, reach out to the phone company.
see who this number belongs to.
what do you got?
blood trail.
directionality indicates that our vic came from somewhere down there.
Danny, in here.
I got spatter.
looks like blood.
I think we just found our primary crime scene.
what do you think it is?
no idea.
here, look.
eight dots forming a rhombus.
I suppose it could be a prison tattoo with some sort of secret message.
we already ran him. He had no criminal history.
eight dots had to mean something to him.
if he's an astronomy buff, the dots could represent the eight planets, though to me, there will always be nine.
I was very fond of Pluto.
what else you got?
timothy Leary claimed there were eight circuits of consciousness.
I was referring to your autopsy findings, Sid.
you had some questions.
uh, that I do.
wound characteristics indicate he was shot at close range with this.
nine mil.
full metal jacket.
jacketed rounds are designed to pierce armor.
this bullet should have gone clean through our vic, but it didn't even make it halfway.
I know, it doesn't make any sense.
this entry wound is also larger than it shod be.
which brings me to question number two.
the vic was also stabbed in the same location that he was shot.
what do you make of that?
two perps-- one with a gun, one with a knife?
or maybe one perp who felt the need for a little overkill.
either weapon could have caused COD by exsanguination.
it's this type of causality dilemma that has stumped philosophers for years.
which came first-- the chicken or the egg?
or in this case, the knife or the gun?
all right, thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Doc.
you okay?
my uncle Frank had heart attack. He's dead.
I'm sorry, buddy.
I just talked to him on Sunday.
he was talking about hisummer visit. He comes every July.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I remember. You guys were tight.
you know, when I graduated from med school, my uncle Frank made thisign and he put it on his front lawn, and it said: "This is the home of the very proud uncle of Dr. Sheldon Hawkes.
funeral's day after tomorrow.
all right, well, you know what?
don't worry about anything, all right?
I got your back.
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry, buddy.
all right.
I appreciate you picking up some of the slack when Hawkes goes out of town.
Oh, yeah, well, I'm in between girlfriends at the moment, so I got a lot of time on my hands.
Oh, rry, that's too much information.
so how we doing on that nine-millimeter Sid pulled from our vic?
ran it through ballistics, and the rifling characteristics are consistent with a German Luger, but this is where it gets weird.
okay, the bullet's core was steel.
most bullets have a lead core.
well, our bullet's old school, all right, manufactured in the early 1940s by a company called Deutsche Waffen-und Munitionsfabriken.
that could explain why the bullet didn't penetrate further into our vic.
gunpowder deteriorates over time...
especially when the ammo's not properly stored.
so if the bullet's old, maybe we should be looking for an old gun.
what do you have so far?
the 48 minute call you found in progress originating from the vic's phone around TOD went to voice mail, so Flack subpoenaed the phone records and we got a recording.
what are you doing here?
that's our vic-- I ran a voice comparison to his outgoing message and I got a match.
the rest gets interesting.
what the hell is that?
what do you think you're doing?
and the rest is just reactions, chaos, us showing up.
got a cell phone with an outgoing call in progress.
how long has it been active?
that's pretty much it.
nothing audio-wise on our shooter.
what about the person who received the call?
you ready for this?
you're going to love it.
everyone's favorite Neo-Nazi.
turns out Xander called him twice before the call you just heard, and according to the phone records, he answered both of those calls.
so maybe he was a witness.
it doesn't add up.
I mean, a guy who works on Madison Avenue associating with a low-life skinhead?
maybe it's less an association and more an affiliation.
Danny, pull up those pictures that Sid took of the vic's tattoo.
yo, what are you doing here?
thought you were on your way to Michigan.
flight's delayed three hours. Figured work would help me take my mind off things.
where you headed?
I'm headed to interview a potential witnes
mind if I tag along?
actually, I don't know if you want to do that.
Why? What's up?
it's Michael Elgers.
so he's a racist. That's his problem, not mine.
can I help you?
we'd like to talk to you about Xander Green.
I wasn't talking to you.
Oh, don't be stupid.
you see who we are.
how do I know Nation of Islam over there didn't steal his ID?
what did I just say?
I got work to do, pigs, so make it fast.
talk to Xander Green recently?
I don't know no Xander Green.
then why'd he call you three times yesterday?
are you saying I'm a liar?
bet your ass I am.
first you come into my shop uninvited and then you insult me?
you better watch your mouth.
you better back off.
don't make me put an arm on you.
I'm done talking to you.
and you-- you got some dice coming in here.
next time you do, you show a little respect.
get over here. You're under arrest for harassment.
come on, man, it's not like I strung him up in a tree.
I want a lawyer.
I want to win the lotto.
that cannoli-eating punk assaulted me.
I hear different.
I hear you resisted arrest.
ask the negro what happened.
sorry, pal, I don't speak ignorant.
but I tell you what...
what a scumbag.
Yeah, we knew that going in.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
you gave him exactly what he wanted, Danny, and that piece of garbage isn't worth it.
he resisted arrest.
I know that, but I'm not the one who needs convincing, and Internal Affairs is just the first stop.
if the ACLU gets wind of this, they're going to have a field day.
we got a skinhead claiming police brutality, and the only witness is yours truly, an African-American.
geez, I know how it looks.
there's no way I was gonna let him get away with what he did.
Danny, guys like Elgers, they like to push buttons.
doing nothing might have sent a stronger message.
so you took e high road. Is that it?
Oh, come on, man. Look... I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think all of this happened for a reason, okay?
Elgers surfacing today as a witness, today of all days, and my plane getting delayed, and you and I going to question him together.
maybe this is my Uncle Frank testing me to see if I learned something from him.
my uncle was in Memphis the day Dr. King was assassinated.
couldn't have been more than ten years old.
and... his whole life, he was on the front lines of racism and he never let it intimidate him.
that's why I couldn't let Elgers g not today.
not today.
I got a plane to catch.
all right. All right.
you're a lawyer?
try again.
another pig.
what, did you guys run out of welfare recipients to protect, so you got to hassle me?
I already said I'm done talking.
then, shut up.
my name is MaTaylor. I'm a detective.
I run the New York Crime Lab.
earlier today, you assaulted one of my men.
what the hell happened to this country?
back in the day, you and me, we'd never be having this conversation.
back in the day, I would have shot your racist ass.
Oh, so you're super white man, is that it?
niggers, zipperheads, little queer faggots.
you save them all.
except crackers like you.
between jobs, you just sit on a stoop all day bitching about people who've actually done something with their lives.
do you think I need some fancy job or diploma to tell me I'm somebody?
any beaner can get an education in this country.
I'm fourth generation American.
that's all the success I need.
that don't mean a man can't ask for more from time to time.
now, get me my lawyer,'cause that chucker-loving punk with a badge assaulted me, and he's got to pay.
you'll get your lawyer.
just know this cuts both ways.
there's still that harassment charge against you.
there's no law against spitting on an animal.
for some, that might be true.
they'd be back on the street by now.
for you, that charge carries quite a bit of weight.
what the hell are you talking about?
the two years you owe New York State... if I decide to push a parole violation.
even without the diploma, I imagine you see where this is going.
what do you want from me?
I want to know about your relationship with Xander Green.
there's no "bromance," if that's what you mean.
Xander's a friend.
was-- he's dead.
well, if Xander's dead, I had nothing to do with it.
you weren't approached as a suspect.
then, why am I here, besides a crap harassment charge?
yesterday, Xander called you three times.
the first two times, you picked up.
the third time, it went to voice mail.
you want to tell me about that?
that fool used to ass dial me all the time.
I thought he was trying to reach me, but then I realized what was going on, so the third call, I just let it go to voice mail.
you hear anything on the first two calls you picked up?
I didn't hang with it very long, but I thought I heard Xander arguing with somebody.
any idea who?
uh, he mentioned some kike named Ari... or Abe... Abraham-- I-I don't know.
Abraham. Call me Abraham.
according to Felix Marshall, the auction house, you were a guest at their auction yesterday?
Yes, I was there.
well, a witness heard your name mentioned during an altercation with an appraiser, Xander Green.
Xander Green is a ganef, a thief.
he told me he would appraise the piece of jewelry I was selling for more than it was worth.
I am not interested in cheating anyone.
keep your mouth shut.
I'll make you very rich.
you can ask him yourself, but I imagine he'll deny our conversation for fear of losing his job.
I'm afraid he no longer has to worry about that.
Xander Green was murdered yesterday during the auction.
abraham, tell me about the rest of your night.
detective, I wish I could help you, but I left after the preview.
you didn't stay around to see how much your piece sold for?
the item I gave Mr. Green to sell... belonged to my late wife.
it was her most prized possession.
she loved wearing it.
I could not bear to see it go to some stranger.
Mr. Klein, why did you sell it if it meant so much to you?
I see you wear a watch.
most people today, they don't see the need.
they have clocks and everything else right on their cell phones.
what I do, there isn't much use for it anymore.
but that doesn't stop my son, David.
he wanted to be close to me, so he asked me to teach him.
and now what does he have?
in five years, this place will be gone.
what happens to David and his family then?
I didn't want to part with it...
but... my wife's jewel yesterday...
sold... for over $300, 000 without cheating anyone.
that money will help when the time comes.
Oh, very good work.
good, good, good.
David, say hello to Detective Mac Taylor.
everything all right?
it's nothing, nothing.
uh, David, be sure and finish cleaning Mr. Polanski's pocket watch.
okay, Pop.
my boy.
how did you get those scratches?
these scratches?
after our conversation, Mr. Green tried to throw me out of his office.
would you, uh, mind if I photograph them?
of course not.
can you pull up your sleeve, please?
like that?
I was in Auschwitz.
it was a very long timago.
did Mr. Green ever share any of his anti-Semitic views?
I never told Mr. Green I was Jewish.
I don't find it necessary to advertise that.
maybe it was the camp that changed things.
when I came to this country, I had no desire to be a religious man.
but my son makes up for both of us.
he says,"Pop... we must remember.
I say... sometimes, it's better to forget.
here you go, Mac.
go for it.
you're right.
wound pattern's identical.
weapon like this could be what killed Xander.
you ever seen anything like it?
19th century naval officers were known to carry flintlocks with bayonets and the British had the Webley revolver.
there was also this nasty looking pistol called the Apache.
combination gun, knife and knuckle-duster.
french gangs used to use it in the early 1900s.
only we're looking for an old Luger with a bayonet affixed to the bottom of the barrel.
apparently, there we some Nazis who liked to make their own.
and since our ammo dates back to the 1940s...
our neo-Nazi could've been killed with an old Nazi weapon.
irony.
if it is our murder weapon, rules out the possibility of two perps.
also answers the chicken and the egg question.
and why one of the tears in the wound was so big.
the blade came first.
that is some seriously sadistic behavior, right?
I mean, why not just shoot him and be done with it?
on my way.
somebody just broke into the vic's apartment.
coincidence?
could be our killer.
whatever he was looking for just might be our motive.
Hey, guys.
so, the neighbor came home, saw that the door broken, knew that the vic was dead, called 911.
intruder must've heard her,'cause then he ran.
place doesn't look tossed.
maybe our guy ran out of time.
or maybe he knew where to find whate was looking for.
Flack... Take a look at this wear mark.
someone moved the bookcase.
often.
we just found our closet Nazi's closet.
take this.
please tell me those aren't what I think they are.
all this stuff's from the Holocaust, isn't it?
Xander was celebrating their genocide.
I just got a hit off one of the prints I lifted off the broken door lock.
that was fast.
he just got released.
obviously, he misses us.
stop!
what part of "freeze" don't you understand?
I told you. I didn't touch Xander Green. We were friends.
yeah? Let's go!
Hey, boss.
you gotta see this.
one of these could be our murder weapon.
men's leather shoes, size nine, taken in Treblinka.
child's doll, fair condition. Found buried with bodies in Dachau. $6, 500"?
they're auctioning off items belonging to victims of the Holocaust.
that's why Elgers tried to get into Xander's secret closet.
I think we just found our motive.
so, Elgers killed Xander to steal his collection and to sell it to the highest bidder.
case closed.
so, you say you found these items hidden in your murder victim's apartment?
along with a lamp shade that DNA confirms was made of human skin.
comprised of various tattoos that were sewn together?
the commandant of Buchenwald, hisife, would order Jews to line up naked, and when she saw a tattoo she liked, she had the skin removed and tanned to be made into lamp shades for her home.
two years ago I heard about one that was traded on the black market for over $10, 000.
that's why I' requested that the NYPD make this a priority.
they'll find the buyers and sellers, make the appropriate arrests.
whatever items might be recovered, perhaps there's a waywe can get them back to the families.
six million were killed, Detective.
and only 900, 000 survived.
I'm afraid the odds of finding family are slim.
but we have spent the past two decades taping testimonials of Holocaust survivors.
let's see if Esther Schnitzler is referenced in one of those.
how do you know about Buchenwald?
my father mentioned it when I was a kid.
he was an army man. 6th Armored Division.
he said he helped liberate the camp in 1945.
didn't say much more than that, so, I went to the library.
looks like there's several mentions of an Esther Schnitzler in an interview with her cousin, Hannah.
when we first got to the camp, we were marched to an area where they shaved our heads, took our clothes.
on the way there, there was a big ditch... filled with bodies.
that's where I saw Esther.
she'd been shot in the head.
nearby was her husband, children... all dead.
I remember thinking, that can't be them.
Esther arranged to escape.
there was a young German boy, a neighbor.
Klaus Braun was his name.
and he told Esther that he could help her and her family get out of Germany.
Oh, for a price.
but back then, the Nazis, they... they took everything.
only thing Esther had left was a brooch.
she managed to hide it.
so beautiful.
diamonds.
get in and stay quiet stay quiet thank you we have to hurry it will be day soon do you have it?
God watch over you for this
the boy... was going to drive them to the border and from there, Esther and her family would escape on foot.
only he didn't drive them to the border.
he took them to Auschwitz.
Klaus' father was SS and Klaus was Hitler-Jugend.
like father, like son.
back then, one could make good money turning Jews over to the Nazis.
I'm afraid that's all there is.
and I guess this is all that's left of that woman's cousin.
is it possible to get a copy of the testimonial?
it'll help the DA when the case goes to court.
of course.
here you go.
Thanks.
Mr. Lesnick, I appreciate your time.
I'll be in touch.
detective, what you've done here today, by pledging to hp us, we call that a mitzvah.
an act of human kindness.
thank you.
how did it go with Internal Affairs?
two week suspension. No pay.
department's got no problem bending me over to do right by this murdering bigot.
we live in a litigious society, Danny.
right or wrong, everybody's got rights.
the upside to this suspension is though,
I get to spend time with my new wife before our little bambina arrives.
that's a good idea.
I'll be here when you get back.
you always are.
Thanks.
I don't like that look. What is it?
we're back at square one.
Adam tried to assemble the murder weapon from what we g at Elgers' place and nothing.
he tried every permutation.
maybe Elgers got rid of it.
Flack ran Elgers' alibi for the time that Xander Green was killed.
it checked out.
our skinhead was across town at TOD.
so, he's not the killer.
what about the witnesses you interviewed?
according to them, the last person to see Xander alive was a model named Cody King.
and before you ask, her alibi checks out.
she was at the auction when Xander was shot.
wait a minute.
enlarge that again.
I've seen this piece of jewelry before.
it's the same piece.
Where's that inventory list the auction house gave us?
I want to know who it belonged to.
uh, it says Abraham Klein.
he consigned the brooch.
what is it?
in 1942, that brooch was given to a boy named Klaus Braun.
he was a member of Hitler Youth.
then how did a Jewish clockmaker get it?
abraham Klein is Klaus Braun.
listen, Detective, I...
we found this journal in Xander Green's house.
it belonged to a Holocaust victim named Esther Schnitzler. You remember her?
I'm sorry, Detective, I don't.
well, you may have tried to forget, but you know who I'm talking about.
I know no one by that name.
so many died.
but how many at your hands... Braun?
what are you talking about?
you seem to have me confused with someone else.
who is Braun?
that's him.
that's Klaus Braun.
his father Ernst was an engineer, helped build the crematoria at Auschwitz.
very efficient.
30 trays, three bodies a tray.
could turn 90 corpses to ash at a time.
Xander Green recognized this brooch from Esther's journal when you brought it to him, didn't he?
didn't he?
but Xander didn't turn you in to the authorities. Why not?
did he try to blackmail you, is that it?
trying to get you to share some of the brooch money?
you couldn't risk someone like Xander knowing your secret, so you killed him.
no. No! You're wrong!
I did no such thing.
this is you-- Klaus Braun-- in 1942, in your hometown of Strausberg, Germany.
in 1942, I was living in the Warsaw Ghetto.
you're lying.
from 1941 till 1943, you were a member of Hitler Youth, a paramilitary organization of the Hitler party assigned to round up Jews trying to escape the Final Solution.
when we enlarged this photo, we found the murder weapon you used to kill Xander Green.
detectives are on their way to your house right now with a warrant.
I guarantee you, we will find that weapon.
detective!
I have done nothing wrong!
how can I be a Nazi when I have this?
this is proof!
I'm sure you remember him.
he and a few assistants tattooed every prisoner in Auschwitz from mid -'42 until the war ended.
this... is their work.
the handwriting on your arm doesn't match.
bet if I take a sample of this ink, it won't come back as Koh-I-Noor, the brand used at the camps.
you did this tattoo yourself.
that's ridiculous.
I am a Jew!
you saw my son, David. He is a Jew!
because he thought you were!
and that God had saved you!
he was probably so grateful that you had survived the atrocities of the Holocaust.
what he didn't know, is that you helped perpetrate them.
you lied to your family. Your friends.
but you had no choice, did you?
after the war, you had to go into hiding.
and so you pretended to be what you despise the most so you could get into this country and elude discovery and capture!
and it worked for almost 60 years.
until you sold this brooch.
and then something intervened.
fate. Karma.
personally, I like to think it was God.
I don't know why you think these things.
enough!
enough.
this is over, Braun.
it's over.
my name is Abraham Klein!
your name is Klaus Braun.
don't bother denying it!
there are men from the Israeli government here to verify your identity.
you have something to say, Braun?
do you have something to say?!
we should have killed them all.
thought you might want to see this
I was sleeping on the floor.
I don't know for how many days and when he woke me, I got scared.
I thought he was one of the camp soldiers.
the SS all knew the war was ending, and they tried to eliminate as many Jews as they could.
but there was something different about this man standing over me.
I could see it in his eyes.
and his uniform.
he was an American.
so young.
I could tell the sight of me was too much.
I was bald, maybe 80 pounds, but this man, he was careful not to look as horrified as I'm sure he was.
he wanted me to come with him, but my legs wouldn't move.
I was too weak, so... he carried me... out of the barracks.
and he gave me his jacket, something to eat.
a Hershey bar.
I took one bite and that was all my empty stomach could handle.
but nothing has ever tasted better.
his goodness... put back a little of the faith I had lost.
my grandchildren... put back the rest.
and what was his name?
private McCanna Boyd Taylor.
do you know what yahrzeit is, Detective?
tell me.
it's the anniversary of a death of a relative.
Esther's is not for two weeks.
and usually we light these candles in mourning, but this time, it will be in celebration.
perhaps there's someone you want to honor?
my father.
amein.
Hello! You have reached...
willow. - And Tommy.
please leave a message.
Hey, guys. I know you're probably asleep.
I just wanted to let you know that I landed safe and sound and I'm on my way to the hotel to get some rest before the big board meeting tomorrow.
so if everything goes okay, it should only take a couple of hours, and you can expect me home for spaghetti night.
all right, see you guys then. Love you.
drive 1. 6 miles, then make a left towards Henry Hudson Parkway.
in 200 feet, make a right turn.
you have reached your destination.
you can't be serious.
great.
Hello?
Hello? Is anyone there?
can I get some help, please?
on-board Safety. Can I help you?
Yeah, um, I think I'm lost.
I could use some directions to midtown Manhattan, please.
where are you? - I don't know.
I saw a sign earlier that said 183 Street and, um, there a place here called Jack & Sam's Storage.
you're on South Clover.
that's a very bad neighborhood.
you shouldn't be there.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm calling you.
so, if you could please just get me the hell out of here, that would be great.
no need to get angry, Mr. Dexter.
how did you know my name?
thank you for calling On-Board Safety.
wait! Wait! Aren't you going to help me?
no.
Hello?
come on. Come on.
Hello? Hello? Please help me.
please!
Hey, babe, hey. Hey, can you look at me?
Hey, I'm here. Where's the ambulance?
okay, you're going to be all right.
Hey, Mac. I didn't hear you pull up.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
when was the last time you slept?
I'm fine. We're over here.
our vic's name is Aaron Dexter.
trash collector making rounds spotted the body and called it in.
looks like a robbery gone south.
what makes you think robbery?
just a hunch.
at least they left us the body.
okay, Mac. Single small caliber GSW to the chest area.
stippling around the entry makes it a close shot.
defensive wounds on the arms.
lividity hasn't set in.
which would make the TOD approximately six hours ago.
which means whoever jacked this guy had to have worked fast.
and had a crew to handle the ghetto pit stop.
these jokers even took the dash.
we had to use the VIN stamp on the frame rail to get an ID.
vehicle belongs to Olympus Rents.
according to their main office, Aaron Dexter picked up the car last night around JFK.
so he's not local. - No. According to his reservation, he is the CEO of GMI Health Network, which is a Medicare company out of Philly.
city of Brotherly Love.
so, let's see who in New York didn't offer Mr. Dexter any love.
freeze it.
zoom in.
close and sharp as you can get.
the best you can do? - I've already tweaked the resolution.
unfortunately, the surveillance cameras located near the crime scene are low quality analog.
pretty craptastic. I'm surprised we even got that much.
there's no way we're going to be able to run this through facial recognition.
faces? You want faces? I got faces. Just not of the shooter.
well, then who do you have?
a new species of Dermestidae beetles.
only these guys are a lot bigger and they walk around on two legs.
it's unbelievable. You got-- what
20 dirtbags running through this crime scene and not one of them calls in a dead body?
just like the Dermestidae beetle, they're too preoccupied with gorging themselves.
and now their greed is going to put them in jail.
run their faces.
I want to squash some of these bugs.
so, Willie, how much you get for that GPS you lifted last night?
GPS? - You know, the little satellite deal.
tells you how to get from one place to the next.
I know what a GPS is, thin man.
it's an "aconym" for Global Positioning Satellite.
Aconym"?
Oh, you like that, huh? - I do.
Yeah, Big Willie's, uh, smart like that. Abbreviations and whatnot.
like sonar.
stands for Sound Navigation and Ranging.
or PIN-- Personal Identification Number.
that's very impressive. How about this one? TYAIJ.
that stands for Throw Your Ass In Jail.
which is exactly what I'm going to do if you don't tell me what went down last night.
afraid I don't have an answer for you on that FAQ, my brother.
but if I hear anything on your gunslinger, I'll give you a holler.
Yeah, I'm sure you will.
now, if you don't mind, IMOH.
I got some video I want to show you before you take off.
don't tell me. You need a little help with your Twittering?
you got your own personal YouTube channel?
something like that. But better.
Ooh, who's that?
that's you, my brother, at my crime scene with a GPS between your sticky little fingers.
all right. Let's get something straight. That car was just sitting there.
like low hanging fruit.
all I'm saying is the white boy was chalk ready when I got there. - Right.
and you could have called it in, done your civic duty, but you opted for the cash and prizes, which makes you a candidate for some jail time, Willie, my man.
Oh, this is such BS, man. How do you steal from a dead guy?
sorry I'm late. The sitter was stuck in traffic.
Whitesnake, huh?
baby threw up on everything else.
so, what is all this?
Flack got one of the suspects to turn on his peeps.
NYPD rounded them up as well as all the evidence they stole.
so this all came from the rental car the vic was driving?
right. And since we know the killer made contact with this door, I'm running prints.
Hey, looks like three of your prints got hits.
Yeah, but which one's our shooter?
well, we could use the car door as a scale.
create a ratio and then determine the height of the shooter.
see if it matches one of these three jokers.
54 inches.
so, the height of our shooter is 1. 36 times the height of the door.
so, that's about 70 inches.
and that puts our shooter at about five foot, ten.
well, that rules out these two mutts. They're both over six feet.
Yeah. They may have helped strip the car.
but this guy... Junior Mosley, he's five-nine.
makes him look good for the murder.
NYPD! Mosley, get down on the ground!
hold it right there!
let me take it out first!
I'm afraid I can't let you do that. - Why not?
this syringe is evidence of drug use.
we're going to have to document it where we found it.
now one for the jackass of the year award.
how's the foot?
I had to get a tetanus shot because of you.
when you get out of jail, you should file a complaint.
jail-- for what?
what do you have to say?
whoever shot this, should have considered using a filter.
there's no color in my man's face.
you done? - Are you?
I'm just getting started.
you recognize this wallet?
Nope.
it belonged to our murder victim, Aaron Dexter.
and we found it in your apartment.
and that ain't all.
ballistics matched it to the bullet we pulled out of Aaron's body.
here's how it adds up: Your prints were at the scene, your gun was used to kill Aaron Dexter.
simple math, Junior.
that fool had no business being on that corner.
and then he starts calling attention to himself.
you got worried he'd draw the attention of the cops and put an end to your profitable evening.
the wallet also tells me you saw a crime of opportunity.
a way to subsidize a slow night.
when Aaron didn't roll over and play dead, you decided to make it happen for real.
the street's a jungle.
got to do what you got to do to survive.
the man you killed had a wife, two kids.
yeah? Well, so do I.
now both of you will never see them again.
Hey, Mac.
what's up?
when I spoke to our vic's wife, she told me that her husband wasn't too familiar with Manhattan.
and according to the voice mail he left after his plane landed, he was headed for his hotel in Midtown.
maybe he took a wrong turn or someone gave him the wrong directions.
or something. - Right, take a look.
I couldn't figure out what he was doing in the Bronx, so I had Adam process the GPS system that Willie stole from the car.
turns out that the address that Aaron put into the GPS was for a luxury hotel in Midtown.
but he ended up in the Bronx.
what, the GPS gave him the wrong directions?
exactly, but it wasn't just a computer glitch.
someone spoofed Aaron's GPS and created a false signal.
and according to the manufacturer, one of the differential ground stations was compromised shortly after he rented the car.
someone hacked it.
not just someone.
some super hacker, and it is the best I've ever seen.
he also hit the microprocessors under the hood of Aaron's rental.
so I ran a diagnostics on the car's computer, and it turns out the signal pirate went in through the stolen vehicle recovery system.
he was able to worm his way around, remotely shutting down the engine.
which means once our vic realized where he was, he couldn't drive away.
so this hacker purposely lured our victim to the worst neighborhood in New York, crippled his car...
and perhaps got what he wished for.
there you go. - Looks great.
thank you. - You're welcome.
something wrong? Jeff? Are you okay?
call 911! Jeff? Are you okay?
it's okay, it's okay. Just...
can somebody help me? Please!
is anyone here a doctor?
Hello? Can you hear me? Is anyone there?
what is your emergency?
one of our customers just collapsed. We need an ambulance.
Hello?
is your customer having trouble breathing?
Yes.
neck swelling? - Yes.
so your customer's in need of medical attention?
Yes, yes! Please hurry!
can you tell me, is Dr. Evans turning blue?
I think... Wait, how do you know his name?
ma'am, I just need you to answer my question.
is Dr. Evans turning blue?
Yes, he can't breathe.
good.
Yeah, I understand. Right.
all right, thanks, Doc.
Where's the vic?
he's over at Trinity General.
just got off the phone with one of the doctors.
they've got him on life support.
the hospital's calling it anaphylactic shock.
what's the crime?
accessory to murder.
how do you figure?
well, the waitress who called 911 says that the person she spoke to never notified an ambulance.
did you check with dispatch?
I did, and they said they never received the call.
but according to the phone records, a 911 call was, in fact, made from this location.
someone hijacked the call.
waitress also said that the person she spoke to identified the vic by name, without her ever giving that information.
she give us a voice description?
she did. It was a male, raspy like that of a heavy smoker.
lots of breathing between words.
also, our waitress swears that she put in the order exactly the way the vic specified
without peanut dressing.
hold the peanut dressing.
I'll have honey mustard instead. - Okay.
allergies.
but the chef who made the salad said that information was never relayed to his order screen.
someone hacked the 911 call, maybe someone hacked the order as well.
that's Big Brother, Mac.
is that even possible?
what are you thinking?
someone hacked Aaron Dexter's GPS and sent him into a dangerous neighborhood.
now someone tampers with Dr. Evan's order, which triggers a life-threatening allergy.
so our two cyber attacks are connected.
our suspect's using technology as a murder weapon.
Hey, Stella, I think I may have found a connection between our two victims.
our anaphylactic shock vic, Dr, Evans, he's an oncologist at St. Sebastian's Hospital, which is owned by GMI Health Network where Aaron Dexter is the CEO.
well, GMI Health owns about a dozen hospitals on the east coast.
we're talking thousands of employees-- any one of which could be our computer-savvy psycho.
so our two victims both worked for the same health care company.
maybe a coincidence, maybe not.
Lindsay, break it down. Correlation science.
see if we can find a stronger connection between our two vics.
if we find one, we might just be able to find out who wanted to hurt them.
Yeah, I'm on it.
Hey, um, I heard that Danny's making improvement?
Yeah, he's got limited movement in his toes.
it's not much, but the doctors say it's a really good sign.
good. Well, I've got my fingers crossed.
Thanks, Stell.
Yeah, hand me the red one. - Excuse me.
do you have authorization for this?
Yeah, it's signed at the bottom of the first page.
why, is there a problem?
what's going on?
did you order the installation of surveillance cameras in the lab? - No.
well, according to this e-mail memo you did.
it's got your electronic signature.
so if you didn't order them, who did?
our suspect. - Why?
he wants to see how our investigation is progressing.
okay, take it down now.
no, no, wait. Are you done? - Almost.
leave it up.
what are you thinking?
if he wants to watch us, let's use it to our advantage.
hello.
mac Taylor? - Yeah.
head of the New York Crime Lab? - That's right.
you served in the Gulf War, and then joined NYPD after a distinguished military career.
Adam, I need you to put a trace on an incoming call to Mac's line.
okay.
I seem to be at a, uh, disadvantage.
you know a lot about me, but I don't know anything about you.
that's the point, Detective.
so what do I call you?
grave Digger.
you think that's funny?
you killed one man, put another on life support today.
well, how unfortunate for them. - And for you.
why is that?
because when I catch you, you're going to spend the rest of your life in jail.
you don't sound well.
and you sound frustrated.
it'll pass. It always does.
he's on a cell.
but the signal's been bounced all over the city.
what about the security camera? Can you trace the feed?
the same thing-- he's piggybacking the transmissions.
this guy's good.
so why don't you save everybody a lot of trouble and tell me where you are.
Oh, where's the sport in that, Detective?
look, clearly, you think Mr. Dexter and Mr. Evans wronged you in some way.
not just Mr. Evans and Mr. Dexter.
who else?
I'm not gonna play that game with you, Detective Taylor.
then what do you want?
I want to talk about your father.
my father?
your father was McCanna Boyd Taylor.
served in the army during World War II, then worked as a machinist on the South Side of Chicago.
tell me how he died.
how did he die, Detective?
my father had cancer.
no, no, no, be precise, Detective.
it was small-cell lung cancer.
that's right.
it must have been very difficult for you.
it was hard on all of us.
but mostly for you, I imagine.
I have that profile the Times did on you a few years back.
in it, you mention your father was your hero, the reason you joined the military and eventually went into law enforcement.
what about you?
you're not well, are you?
is that why you're using the Internet?
are you incapacitated in some way?
your hero spent the last eight months of his life in bed on a feeding tube.
not a very dignified way to end a life, don't you think?
I think I'm running out of patience.
then I guess we're done for now.
but don't worry.
you'll be hearing from me again very soon.
until then, you think about your father.
I want to talk about your father.
tell me how he died. It was small-cell lung cancer.
not a very dignified way to end a life, don't you think?
you think about your father.
mom, I'm home.
how is he?
he's good.
he's been asking for you all day.
how much time do you have left?
enough.
look, why don't you just turn yourself in?
that's what you want, isn't it?
what I want is for you to tell my story.
so that's what this is about?
is that why you chose me?
no, I didn't choose you, Detective.
fate brought us together when I read your story.
if you think I'm gonna relate to what you did, you're wrong.
no, not so fast, Detective.
then give me something to make me understand.
Oh, in time, Detective, in time.
unfortunately, you don't have any.
let me help you.
no, it's too late for that.
you of all people should know that.
Dr. Evans was your oncologist, wasn't he?
and the hospital you were treated at was run by Aaron Dexter.
very good.
surely, you don't blame them for your cancer.
I blame genetics.
something you yourself should consider when making long-term plans.
so, cancer was in your family.
who had it, your mother, father?
I have to go now, Detective.
I imagine in a few hours you're going to want to talk to me again.
no, wait, wait, don't hang up.
Hey, I reached out to the oncology department at St. Sebastian's.
here is a list of the patients that Dr. Evans was taking care of.
what's wrong?
he's going after someone else.
mac, I think we got something.
all right, so we know on both attacks the Grave Digger infiltrated the systems using a sophisticated worm program.
there was no way to trace it to an IP address, but we were able to isolate his digital fingerprint.
a man's wireless was bouncing off a couple different servers.
but we overlaid the digital fingerprint from both attacks and we got one match.
in each attack, Grave Digger used different servers, never using the same one twice except in this location: 7892 40th Street.
it's a cyber security firm called ProspectiveData.
and we're thinking since he's got mad computer skills...
he could be working there.
here is a list of their current employees.
and here's a list of Dr. Evans' cancer patients.
let's see if there's a match.
Victor Benton. He's Grave Digger.
says here Benton worked on the government's GPS program ten years ago.
they launched the global navigation satellites and created the GPS network.
explains where he gets his skillage from.
track him down. Hawkes.
what do you mean you can't find him?
well, according to ProspectiveData, Victor Benton was on medical leave for the last year, and when his health benefits ran out, he moved and left no forwarding address.
it's safe to say that if he was in the final stages of cancer that he's not mobile.
so we got a killer that can't move from his bed that we can't find.
we might be able to locate who he's targeting next.
according to the hospital records, there were only two people who ever treated Victor Benton while he was a patient there:
Dr. Evans and a medical technician by the name of Lisa Kim.
now, Kim stopped administering chemotherapy two months ago when Aaron Dexter shut down the oncology department because of budget cuts.
until then, patients who didn't have insurance were being treated for free.
so, in Benton's eyes, when they cut that treatment, they signed his death warrant.
now Benton wants to make them pay.
Hi, Pam.
Hello?
I need some help. I-I'm stuck in the elevator.
Hello?
talk to me, Adam.
according to the on-duty nurse, Lisa Kim left the hospital about ten minutes ago, and she never checked out.
Hello?
uh, is anyone there? Can you hear me?
I'm stuck in an elevator!
what floor are you on?
the... The 20th.
that's very high, Lisa.
Victor? Is that you?
Hey, Mac, no one's seen her leave the building.
elevator's not working. We got an elevator malfunction here.
you know what's going on?
all right, I'm looking at the main access control for the hospital elevators.
looks like there's been a cyber security violation from the outside.
it's Benton.
Yeah, he's got the whole system jammed up, and an elevator holding on the 20th floor.
Benton's hijacked the elevator.
he's holding Kim on the 20th floor-- we're going up.
Victor, what's going on?
we can't bypass the system, Mac.
keep trying.
come on, guys. There's got to be something we can do.
how do you feel, Lisa? Shut in?
I remember you telling me about your fear of enclosed spaces.
how they made you feel...
like you were suffocating.
let me out of here! Please? Please!
no one can hear you.
people working, somebody? Somebody, please! Somebody!
no, not anymore.
they're all gone.
you're lying. You're lying. Help!
this floor is being painted later tonight.
didn't you get the memo I sent?
I can't breathe! I can't breathe.
I'm so sorry about that, Lisa.
please... Please...
you want me to help you?
you want me to save your life.
why would I do that, Lisa?
I'm sorry.
I didn't have a choice.
Apologies-- that's all I ever heard from you and Dr. Evans.
you knew me.
you knew what I was going through.
you could have found a way to help me...
but you didn't.
we weren't allowed to.
we weren't allowed to. - Right. Right.
the corporation...
isn't in the charity business, hm?
they made that...
quite clear to me. Every time I...
spoke to someone, they said the same thing:
I'm sorry, Mr. Benton.
I wish I could help you, Mr. Benton.
I wish...
we didn't have to take your bed, Mr. Benton.
if your insurance hadn't...run out, "we could do something for you, "Mr. Benton.
we wished you the best, "Mr. Benton.
thank you for calling.
miss Kim? - Miss Kim?
here! Here!
we need something to leverage it open.
miss Kim?
I'm Detective Taylor from the New York Crime Lab.
I'm gonna get you out of there.
hold on. - Mac.
miss Kim.
Mac! It's moving! Come on!
come on.
you all right?
we found Victor Benton. - How?
Benton was too busy terrorizing Lisa Kim to realize he left his flank exposed.
so I pulled out the old Trojan horse, ran a back trace and got an I. P.address.
and I got a street address for you, too-- it's in Brooklyn.
call Flack, tell him to meet us on site with backup.
silent approach-- I don't want Benton to know we're coming.
I tried your office, but they said you were out.
you're not the only case I'm working on.
it would be...
if you hadn't spoiled my plans.
what would putting Lisa Kim in the morgue accomplish?
she needed to feel...
what it's like...
to be helpless and forgotten.
she suffers from severe claustrophobia.
she could've died in that elevator.
that's what happens when one doesn't get the help they need.
you remember when your father...
needed help, don't you?
and he got it.
well, I wasn't given that option.
you won't get sympathy from me.
you have a problem with the health care system-- you found three scapegoats.
don't you see... Detective?
that's the lesson here.
I needed to... put Lisa Kim, Aaron Dexter and Dr. Evans in my shoes...
to make them understand.
you have a message, write your congressman.
Where'd you say you were?
I didn't.
he knows we're coming. - Yeah.
Flack, get an ambulance.
seven, eight... - Come on.
you should have let me die.
maybe I should have.
now the city has to keep you alive, cause you're entitled to a fair trial.
don't worry, I won't make it that far.
Oh, come on...
do you think I wanted to kill people...
to get the treatment I needed?
I told you, you're not gonna get any sympathy from me.
I don't want your sympathy, Detective.
then you understand, if your father hadn't been given chemotherapy, he would have died a lot earlier than he did.
my father wasn't a rich man.
so the help he got in his final days, it wasn't much.
but unlike you...
he didn't blame everyone for his fate.
he knew he was dying, and he took comfort in the fact that it was his time.
my father died courageously, with his family around him, looking up to him.
but I'm certain, Detective...
if he hadn't gotten the treatment... he needed...
you... would've done whatever had to be done...
in order to see him live...another day, even it meant breaking the law.
you would have done that to honor your father.
you think you know me because you read a few stories?
you have no idea who I am.
but I know who you are.
you're a coward.
I put guys like you away every day.
that's how I honor my father.
When'd you get in?
a few hours ago.
the Silver Star.
damn. You did good, son.
thank you, sir.
so, what does Claire think about you considering plans to...
retire from the Corps?
she, uh, says it's my decision, but I think she'd be happy to...
settle down someplace and have me home for a while.
you stay close to her, son.
she's a good woman.
Yes, sir.
your mother tells me you got offered that job in New York.
what are you gonna do?
I'm not sure.
new York City Police Department's the best in the country.
you've had your war, son.
take the job. - Dad...
Claire's from New York, hm?
she has family there.
you're gonna need their help when...
babies start coming.
whoa, Dad.
we just got married, Dad.
and I was thinking that maybe I'd...
if I do retire, maybe I'd move back to Chicago for a while.
no, son.
there's no need for you to be here.
I've had a good life.
you need to live yours.
dad... - You've served... your country, Mac.
pick up the phone.
make the call. Take the job.
promise me...
you'll make the call.
I promise.
drop the ax! Drop the ax, man.
don't do this!
drop the ax now!
Freeze! Do not take another step! Do you hear me?
get down on the ground!
do it!
drop the ax, man!
uniform found the key in his pocket. Belongs to this hotel.
he making any statements? - No.
that's where he got the ax. He was completely out of his mind.
they had to transport him back to the precinct in a body bag.
No! No!
let me out!
stop!
no cuts or wounds? - None.
he was definitely wearing somebody else's blood.
what the hell happened in here?
Clowns?!
that's what you're going with-- clowns?
that's your official story?
they were trying to kill me.
Oh, so they're the "homicidal on the inside" kind of clowns.
well, hang on a second, while I put out an APB for two guys with frizzy pink hair and big red noses!
they stuck a gun in my mouth.
open your mouth.
do it!
open your mouth!
open it!
this gun?
this gun, James? This is a water gun filled with tequila.
now what do you have to say about that? - I don't know...
you don't know.
that's the last thing that I remember.
what drugs are you on, James? What'd you take?
I didn't take anything.
all right, enough, enough with the lying. Enough!
we have your driver's license, James.
we know that you were up there celebrating your 21st birthday with your friends.
things got out of control, and so what happened?
I remember... I remember...
I was underwater.
swimming with seahorses...
and... a-and... starfish.
mark. Ask Mark.
mark's dead.
they're all dead, James.
you hacked your friends to death.
now tell me why.
I'm cold.
it's really cold in here.
I wanna... I wanna go home.
can I go home now?
he's clearly on something.
dilated pupils, cold sweats, tremors.
most likely LSD or some other psychotropic drug.
explains why he was swinging the ax at cars and didn't respond to the officers on the street.
he was hallucinating.
drop the ax!
depending on the dose, the effects could last anywhere between six and 12 hours.
he has moments of lucidity, but he could go in and out of hallucinations during that time.
let's see.
he's a physics major at Chelsea University and a member of the Manhattan Physics Club.
kid's no dummy. - Strange.
a kid like this, no record, clean as a whistle.
James's phone?
Yeah.
got 11 missed calls from a Sara.
girlfriend?
and one call from his mother.
James, it's your dad and I. Happy birthday! I hope you're having fun.
happy birthday, son.
put the books down. Go out and have a drink.
got out and have ten drinks.
don't tell him that!
don't have ten drinks, sweetheart.
we'll be home Friday. We love you so much.
and say hello to Sara for us.
happy birthday, son.
happy birthday, James.
what's up?
she was first.
angle of the wound suggests the ax came down from above.
but it was clean.
so if one of the others were first, there would be a castoff pattern on the ceiling.
it's hard to say who was next.
well, this guy's hand... is on top of the other guy's leg.
so, he goes down, James hits him in the back multiple times, causing this blood spatter on the wall and the bathroom door.
and this guy gets hit; his arm falls on top.
all right, so, two, three.
maybe. There's nothing to rule out her as number two.
right. - So, three, four.
horizontal wound.
the ax came straight back.
right, and boom, causing that castoff pattern on the wall.
there's a break in the pattern-- a void.
so who was standing here when she was killed?
there's no castoff pattern on the shirts of any of our vics.
someone else was right here.
this is crazy!
James never did a drug in his life.
well, that's why we asked you to come down here, Sara.
maybe fill in some of the blanks?
none of this makes any sense.
two of the victims were Mark Turner and Daniel Vaughn. You know them?
Yes, they're his best friends.
how about them?
do you know who these girls are?
no?
they didn't go to school with you and James
I don't think so.
did you know James was going out last night?
Yeah.
mark and Daniel set it up.
it was his 21st birthday. You weren't supposed to be with him?
James never made a big deal out of his birthday.
last year, he spent it in a library.
said he was... celebrating with Einstein.
James is a science buff, huh? - Yeah.
I can relate.
I was gonna throw a party for him.
he made me promise not to.
mark and Daniel said they weren't taking no for an answer.
James... he isn't a party guy.
he... He's kind of a wallflower, you know?
he just sits back and watches everyone else have fun.
I don't care, though.
I-I love that he's not one of those fraternity-type guys, you know?
no. No, get away from me!
get away! - Wait. Calm down.
what's gonna happen to him?
I wish I had a good answer for that, Sara.
so he was telling the truth.
he was kidnapped by two clowns.
found a hair in each of the masks, and they came back to the two male vics.
the clowns were his buddies.
are you serious?
not funny, guys.
happy birthday, man.
happy birthday, bro.
I thought he was hallucinating.
so what happened after the jig was up?
I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine, brother.
Hey, Doc.
so Sid printed the vics. Got an I. D. on our two girls.
names are Jackie Wright and Lacey Deshane.
both have priors for drug possession.
they go to school with our suspect?
Nah, I don't think they seem like the school type.
the only detention they've seen is probably Manhattan's House of Detention.
tox also confirmed LSD in our two male vics.
but not the girls.
so they were partying pretty hard.
I've heard of people having a bad trip, but something set this kid off.
Yeah. Or his accomplice.
you have any theories on who created the void in the wall?
nothing. I sent blood swatches to DNA.
unknown stain on Mark's shirt, and... trace amounts of shampoo on James' jeans.
shampoo.
now, this guy needs to come down off the LSD and give up the other person in the room.
this might tell us.
this is James' shirt-- unis found it on the stairwell at the hotel.
nice.
you see? No corresponding castoff patterns across here.
Yeah, so he didn't create the void.
it would confirm that James was holding the ax.
Yeah, but I don't see any medium-velocity blood spatter-- not on his shirt or his jeans.
and these are close-contact ax wounds.
if James were the killer, there would be some blood spatter evidence on him.
so he didn't create the void, and he wasn't swinging that ax.
what the hell was he doing when his friends were being massacred?
Oh, no, you didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.
Hey, Adam.
how far have you got?
uh, well, I have a prelim sequence of events based on the crime scene photos and DNA results.
run it.
okay.
okay. So, we know Jackie Wright was our first vic.
angle of the wound and no castoff pattern on the ceiling.
now...
mark Turner either tried to bum-rush the killer or make a run for the door, but he took a shot in the back, went down and the killer hit him a couple more times.
causing the blood spatter on the bathroom door.
now, the other guy, Daniel Vaughn, probably tried to step in.
not wise, because he takes a hit to the chest, goes down, landing on top of Mark.
how do you know for sure these guys are number two and three?
cause the DNA results came back from the girl's shirt, and there was blood from all three of the other vics on her.
so everyone's blood was on the ax before she got hit.
listen, Danny, was the bathroom door slightly open like this when you got there?
Yep. Nobody touched anything.
Adam, go back to the second victim.
highlight the door.
right.
look-- no blood is on the edge of the door.
now, with a pattern like that, blood would have definitely gotten on the edge, unless...
unless it was closed.
exactly.
James said he remembered swimming with the seahorses and the starfish.
and he had traces of shampoo on his jeans.
James isn't our killer.
he was tripping in the bathroom.
I didn't kill my friends.
I know you didn't, James. I know it.
what's happening to me?
you took LSD.
no. No. No. No. I...
listen to me, James.
you're experiencing hallucinations, heightened anxiety, intense paranoia.
I wouldn't have done that.
I-I-I... Your friends took it, too.
it was your 21st birthday.
you were probably doing a lot of things you hadn't done before.
I'm going to take your handcuffs off, okay?
just relax. You trust me?
I understand you're a man of science.
studying physics. - Quantum physics.
that's heavy stuff.
your girlfriend told me you're writing a paper about the unified field theory.
you talked to Sara?
where is she? Can I see her?
maybe in a little bit.
how long am I going to feel like this?
I need your help, James.
I need you to try to focus.
remember everything from last night.
I don't know.
there's just... pieces.
every piece, no matter how little, is important.
who are the two girls?
you remember them? - No.
where did you go after you got back to the hotel?
a bar, a club?
no... No. I remember... walking out of the bathroom.
seeing them.
No!
I don't know what happened.
why are you asking me these questions?
I want to go home.
why can't I just go...?
why can't I just go home?
James, I know you're scared.
but we're going to get through this.
the two of us, okay? You and me.
you don't have to answer anything you don't want to.
we'll just take it slow.
try to figure this out together.
okay, the two male vics, Mark and Daniel, bring James to the Tribeca Grand Hotel for his 21st birthday.
and there's drinking and drugs.
this was going to be a night that they only vaguely remember.
as far as the two female vics, Jackie and Lacey were not their friends.
and the hotel manager said that the girls did not check in with them.
so the guys either met them at some point that night and they all went back to the hotel to continue the party.
right, or they were the party.
hired to, uh, blow out the birthday boy's candle.
right, okay. All the blood at the scene belongs to our victims.
and the same goes for the blood on the ax.
now, we know that someone other than James used it.
Hawkes, try laser micro-dissection.
see if we can separate the blood from any skin cells that might have been left behind on the handle.
what else do we have?
I'm still waiting on DNA from the bite mark on James' calf.
you tell me he doesn't remember that?
he doesn't remember anything at the moment.
so we're going to have to piece together his night with whatever evidence we have.
all right, well, here's what I got.
mark and Daniel checked into the hotel at 6: 00 p. m.
I'm guessing they left, got James, got back to the room somewhere around 7: 30.
they ordered room service at 7: 40.
ATM records show withdrawals from all of them at the bank right next to the hotel at 8: 00.
after that, no credit or debit card transactions.
so wherever they went, they paid cash.
and none of them made any calls from their cell phones.
we couldn't retrieve any text messages because whoever we're looking for crushed their phones.
but I was able to salvage a photo taken of one of them.
this was taken at 8: 45 last night.
these guys know how to party or what?
I mean, what, they organize a Golden Girls reunion?
are any of our vics related to one of them?
no, I checked. - Checked where?
Wesleyshire House.
it's an assisted living facility.
and none of the vics had any relatives there.
all right, so what were they doing there?
and the next number is O-71.
sweetest boys you'll ever meet.
I beg to differ.
Helen nearly kicked the bucket when she kissed that boy on the cheek.
so you're saying that they came here to play bingo?
well, this one-- I think his name was Mark-- said they were doing research for a documentary about nursing homes.
Yeah, I don't think they were here to do, uh... - I'm not stupid, sonny.
we don't get many youngsters visiting around here, so why not have some fun, right?
you're going down, Mary.
I'm coming to get ya.
bring it on, hot shot.
did I mention I was state champion three years running?
I beg to differ.
Bingo!
what I tell ya, sister?
you don't mess with these skills.
bingo.
bingo has been called.
how much did he win?
25000
and the next number is B-3.- What...?
25 grand?
this ain't your grandmother's bingo game.
we play high stakes.
spices things up.
and he kept the money? - We insisted.
I beg to differ.
they won it fair and square.
so, yes, I insisted.
well, obviously, we didn't find that kind of money at the hotel room.
no. That could be our motive.
is that all, gentlemen?
cause I can think of better things to do than sit here all day with you two.
I beg to differ.
Hey, Stell.
just completed laser micro-dissection on the ax, and I found some epithelials.
now, it'll take a little while, but if we're lucky, they belong to someone other than James.
okay, well, I just got another piece of the puzzle.
DNA came back from the bite mark on James' calf.
someone in the system?
priors for assault and resisting arrest.
apparently, he put two officers on their back when they tried to arrest him for drinking in public.
wait a second. Is this right?
says he's three-foot, nine.
he took down two officers?
and bit one of them.
do we know where to find this guy?
the probation officer gave us a work address.
Danny and Flack are headed over there now.
Yeah!
I'm gonna do a little dance around your pathetic, lifeless body.
my manager's gonna shove a folding chair under the ropes.
the ref's gonna try to stop me.
boom! I hit the referee with the chair, and then you.
blood, blood, blood... Now the ref is gonna come through just in time to see me pin you.
the crowd goes wild.
who the hell are you?
no, no, no, no, no.
you're not locking me up for this.
they asked for it.
all right, so I get a little carried away, take things too far.
who was with you?
no one. It was just me.
there was someone else in there.
I only work solo.
why'd you do it? - Why do you think?
for the money.
you bet your ass money. - How much money you get?
a grand. - A grand?
you did this for a grand?
Yeah. It was the easiest money I ever made.
what are you talking about? - What are you talking about?
we're talking about a quadruple homicide that apparently you committed last night.
that I committed? - Yeah. That's what it sounds like.
last night?
and we got your DNA on one of our vic's legs to prove it.
these guys are dead?
Hey, I didn't kill no one.
these two jokers came in last night, gave me $1, 000 to bring their buddy, the birthday guy, into the ring.
we put on one hell of a show.
they had fun, I had fun, and they left.
alive.
okay, uh, were they, uh... were they high?
on drugs?
no, I don't think so.
what about these two girls? Were they with them?
no. It was just the three of them.
all right.
go fight.
all right, that's another piece, but where do the girls come in?
and where'd they get the drugs?
I want to help.
I really do.
and I didn't take LSD.
you don't believe me, do you?
well, I believe you don't remember taking LSD.
you and I probably have a lot in common.
never had a desire to be the life of the party, unable to just let go.
I think your buddies just wanted you to loosen up, take a moment to let the world happen to you.
it definitely happened to me.
why can't I remember?
just relax. It'll come in time.
and what if it doesn't?
why don't you tell me about your, uh... your studies?
tell me about that paper you're writing.
an Open Letter to Albert Einstein.
I hate to break it to you, James, but Einstein's dead.
not his ideas.
einstein believed that everything in the universe is predictable.
until Niels Bohr proved him wrong at the atomic level.
protons, electrons flying around a nucleus in a completely random fashion.
he said that God... - "I can't believe God plays dice with the universe.
that phrase comes to mind often in my field.
there have been times in my life where I wish everything was as predictable as you say, but I think you'll find the world's a far more interesting place...
what are you doin'? Huh?
it's me. It's me. It's Mac.
I rode a bull. - You what?
a bull.
you tell me. Tell me what you remember.
I rode a bull.
it didn't have a face.
I remember.
okay. Okay. A bull.
well, there's only two in the city.
the other one's in Brooklyn.
Danny already spoke to the bartender out there, so, no... no, our vics weren't there.
Yeah, will do.
okay. How's it going?
wait... Let me guess.
Cosmo or... an appletini.
let me guess.
long Island, maybe Dix Hills.
my manager makes us talk like that.
got a question for you.
remember these guys?
Yeah. From last night.
they were, uh, big spenders, flashing a lot of cash.
they were, uh... They were really funny.
they got really wasted.
this guy here actually took on Pedro.
who's Pedro?
rode him to level four.
pretty good for a city boy.
you remember about what time they came in?
maybe 12: 15.
any of them seem high?
I don't think so.
neither were the, uh, girls they were with.
what girls?
there were these two girls. They, uh... they ordered a round of shots for everyone.
come to think of it, they might have put a little something extra in three of the shots.
so, were these guys pretty liquored up before they met the girls, or...?
they didn't meet the girls here. They all walked in together.
thanks for your time. - My pleasure... cowboy.
stell? - Where are we?
they hooked up with the girls some time between 12: 00 and 12: 15 a. m. which is a small window, considering they had to take a cab from the wrestling thing up to the bar.
but to be honest with you, I don't know where we are.
get a hold of Danny. Have him meet me at the cab depot on 40th.
cab depot?
remember the unknown trace on our vics' shirts?
it's antifreeze.
Plus, Sid told us that one of the vics had a bruise on his shoulder from a seat belt.
I'm thinking they got into an accident, and it wasn't just a fender-bender.
we're looking for a pretty banged-up cab.
all right, let me know what you find.
strangest thing.
came out of nowhere.
the lamppost?
the lamppost came out of nowhere? - Right.
they have a tendency to do that when you're driving up on the sidewalk.
this is what I'm saying.
Mr. Gordon, you never reported the car accident.
is there a reason for that?
I'm reporting it to you now.
look, do you remember these guys?
you dropped them off at a bar over on Ludlow last night.
something like that.
something like that.
you remember these girls? Were they with them?
I'm losing my patience here, Gerald.
tell us what you know, or I'm gonna lock you up for reckless driving.
you-you can't do that.- Watch us.
no, no, I mean, you can't because, uh, I wasn't the one driving.
get outta here.
just go!
they gave me a hundred bucks to drive the cab and... another $1, 500 for the damage.
$1, 600 to flush your medallion down the toilet?
this is what I'm saying.
good man, Gerald.
he's got security cameras in here.
I can't believe I wrestled a midget!
little person. God!
I can't believe I wrestled a little person.
pick up these girls.
no, no.
relax, Gerald, you're off duty.
freeze it right there.
let's see if they match.
that's Lacey Deshane.
and that's Jackie Wright.
so they just randomly picked up these girls last night?
looks that way.
man, that's some bad luck. Of all the cabs.
where you headed?
wherever you guys are going.
get in. - All right.
what's up?
what do you say we hit... - Just drive!
okay. Those girls didn't know what they were in for.
well, they knew enough to slip the guys some LSD.
most likely to get their hands on the cash.
can you go back to where the cab first pulls over?
right there.
Jackie puts something in her purse.
how close can you get?
let's see.
that looks like a gun.
they came from right here. Something happened up in that apartment.
uh, all right, I'll start.
me and my partner here are recruiting on behalf of the NYPD.
looking for a couple of good guys to do some undercover work.
you know, inconspicuous types who blend in.
we think you got what it takes. You interested?
let 'em in.
what you two want?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where're my manners at?
why don't you boys have a seat?
that looks like a gunshot wound.
you all right there, chief?
it ain't nothin'.
mama said there'd be days like this.
tell us about Jackie Wright and Lacey Deshane.
ain't them bitches dead?
Yeah, what do you know about that?
same as you, I suppose.
I got eyes and ears all over this city.
some crazy bastard went all Paul Bunyan on them girls.
so that makes you Babe the Blue Ox.
they left this building last night. We know that Jackie was carrying a gun.
now why would that be?
I don't know.
bad parenting, maybe?
she should know better than to play with guns.
Yeah, you're quite the role model.
Hey, check this out, Sipowicz.
I had nothing but love for them girls. Huh?
I put money in their pockets, food in their mouths.
so it's a crying shame what happened.
when I heard you arrested someone, I was a happy man.
but see, now, I'm thinking... Things has changed.
that boy a witness?
all right.
I'm done with you two.
now get your asses out of my house.
Danny: His name's Rufus Knox.
drug dealer, twitchy son of a bitch.
what's his connection to the girls?
they worked for him selling drugs in an underground nightclub.
Rufus also bailed them out on their last two arrests.
okay, so the relationship goes south, the girls put a bullet in his face and then take off.
right when James and his buddies drive by in the cab.
without a witness, it's all circumstantial.
nothing circumstantial about this: Laser micro-dissection identified the epithelials on the ax handle.
DNA belongs to Rufus Knox. Already called the DA for a warrant.
bingo. - All right, let's move.
move, move, move!
there's no one here.
it's just me, I swear.
we're all clear.
nothing.
where is he? Where is he?!
get down! Get down!
you think I'm pissing around here, huh?
you punk-ass kid!
don't you move a hair on your head!
don't do it, James. Don't do it, son.
listen to the nice police officer, kid.
girls... you some crazy-ass bitches.
Yeah, you want out, huh?
Oh, well, you want out, well, you got it!
you were there.
you killed my friends.
put the gun down, James.
you don't want to do this. Trust me, son.
I'm gon' tell ya-- this gon' be good.
lower the gun! Lower the gun.
on your knees. On your knees!
hands behind your head. Do it!
turn around. Turn around!
she's scared out of her mind, but she's talking.
apparently our two female vics wanted out of the drug business.
I just want to start over, you know?
I got a friend that lives out in California.
do yourself a favor just shut your mouth!
after all I done for you.
you just want out.
just like that.
you know, I'm starting to get the distinct feeling here that I'm a little underappreciated.
one of Rufus' girls spotted them going into the hotel with James and their friends.
James' friends were collateral damage.
Yeah. Well, he would've been, too, if he hadn't been in the bathroom.
Rufus wasn't leaving any witnesses.
the timing on this thing is unbelievable.
driving up in the cab just as the girls ran out of the apartment.
the sequence of events, I mean, what are the odds?
worlds colliding.
how you feeling?
guilty.
like... this is all my fault.
my best friends are all dead because of me.
that's not true, James.
this is life. It throws things at you.
some good, some bad.
no one could have predicted what happened, not even if you're Albert Einstein.
so what do I do now?
you've been through a major trauma.
it's gonna be tough.
so don't pretend to have all the answers.
you talk to people.
you're feeling something, you reach out.
depend on the people who love you.
you'll be all right.
Hey, Mom, hey, Dad.
Oh, baby... - God, I missed you.
Oh, I'm so dang happy. Let's go home.
Hey.
it's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
are you all right?
hungry, I bet, huh?
Freeze!
NYPD!
this is Detective Bonasera. I need backup.
in pursuit of a subject vehicle.
suspect is headed north on Amsterdam Avenue at 97th.
it's a small pickup truck, silver in color, tailgate missing, right rear light is broken.
new York license plate AQT543.
give me your hand.
come on, damn it!
we have to do this together.
whatever it is, it looks serious.
waiting for the results of an autopsy.
been hovering outside of Sid's office until he finally banished me.
we pick up a case I don't know about?
how many business cards do you hand out a week to friends and family of victims and say, "If you need anything, give me a call?
countless.
marina Garito called me every Monday at 8: 00 sharp, without fail, for three years.
always asking the same question.
wanting to know if there were any new leads in her brother's case.
her brother was murdered?
Luke Garito was eight years old when he went missing 15 years ago.
he was presumed dead.
marina was relentless in her search for answers.
calling with potential leads, names of possible suspects.
last Monday, she left me a message.
said she was close to the biggest break in the case yet.
I have no idea what she meant, 'cause I was, uh...
I was too busy to get back to her.
last night, she was rushed to Trinity General Hospital.
gunshot wound, dead on arrival.
I completed my autopsy of Marina Garito.
she committed suicide.
what?
Sid, that's just not possible.
self-inflicted gunshot wound.
was there any bruising, or defensive injuries suggesting a struggle?
no.
what about gunshot residue?
sem picked up trace amounts of GSR on our victim's right hand.
it's consistent with her handedness and the location of the wound on the body.
there's got to be another explanation for this.
I'm sorry, Stella, but there's nothing here that hints at foul play.
was suicide the preliminary determination of the officers at the scene?
Yes. And my postmortem examination of the victim confirms it.
I believe the crime report mentions that they found a note.
so, that's it? Case closed?
it's not my call.
Oh, come on, Sid. You and I both know that once suicide is suggested, proper protocol of a homicide investigation, both at the scene and with the body, is dismissed.
things get overlooked.
SID: Well, that may be the case in the field, but certainly not here in the medical examiner's office.
this young woman had reason to live.
she would not have done this.
SID: I've seen hundreds of cases with the very same set of circumstances, and I've arrived at the exact same result.
maybe this time you're wrong.
all right... No, I'm sorry.
if there is one thing I am sure of, it's that Marina Garito did not kill herself.
this was murder.
don't take it personally, Sid.
Stella worked through the night.
she's tired.
we're both disappointed, I suppose.
disappointed?
that we didn't get any answers for Marina about her brother.
it's been three years since Stella entered
our hope was that it would match a John Doe that came in somewhere, but time after time, nothing, we never got a hit.
then last night, Marina's body was brought in.
so I called Stella.
and her suicide made you think she gave up?
on us, yeah.
this all feels more tragic because Luke and Marina were twins.
you know, and they say there's a bond.
I wish there was something more
I could have done for her, for them.
it's been almost 15 years since Luke disappeared.
but each morning I wake up,
I don't think about it being another day that
I haven't seen my brother.
for me, it's another day closer to him coming home.
of course sometimes, it's hard to remain optimistic.
reality sets in, and I could see the possibility that he's actually dead.
it makes it easier, because it helps me erase the image that Luke is...
sitting somewhere, alone, waiting, wondering, "Where haven't they come to get me?
where are they?
it's strange.
when I do let myself imagine that we find him,
I have my arms around him, but, uh, he's still an eight-year-old boy.
I hope he's okay.
we've got to find something that at least shows motive.
right, and we can't do that without access to Marina's apartment.
and Mac needs cause to secure it as a crime scene.
Yeah. We need evidence to get the evidence.
well, what about the fact that women rarely commit suicide with guns?
their method is usually overdose or poison.
you want to guess what the DA's going to say to that?
you know, the odds are definitely stacked against us, Stell.
I've read the police report.
there was as suicide letter sent to her family and friends.
it's time I end it all. Free myself.
this is the only way I know how.
leaving here is my only option.
this is all typed on a computer, Hawkes.
anybody could have written it.
marina closed bank accounts, paid her bills.
she made a large cash contribution to charity.
all signs of a plan to attempt suicide.
I mean, not to mention, her prints were on the gun we recovered from the scene.
well, the killer could have put the gun in her hands.
Stella, I'm all for women's intuition and gut instinct, but what is it, exactly, that makes you think
marina Garito didn't take her own life?
she wasn't finished, Lindsay.
she hadn't found her brother yet.
they were eight years old when he went missing.
when I met her, she was 21.
she was dedicated to finding him.
she had notebooks with names, places, questions, possible witnesses.
I remember her face, the look in her eyes when she first came to me for help.
excuse me.
Hi. I don't exactly know how to do this, but my brother is missing, and, uh, I have his hat.
and I've been told that it might help.
you're going to have to file a missing persons report.
uh, this might take a while.
so, I'm sorry, but if you just have a seat...
how long has your brother been missing?
12 years.
what's your name?
okay, Marina. Let's see what we can do.
thank you.
and every Monday after that, she would call me.
and there was always this determination and hope in her voice.
she wasn't going to stop until she got answers.
maybe after all this time, she lost that hope.
she surrendered.
no. I don't believe Marina Garito gave up.
I'd, uh, be more than happy to help you.
you look a little lost.
Oh, no. I was told to wait right by the elevator.
the lost look is me just taking this all in.
I've never seen a crime lab before.
you know, I could give you a tour, uh, show you some epithelials under the microscope.
seen plenty of epithelials, but thank you.
Ah. Biologist?
doctor. Dermatologist?
emergency room. Single?
cute.
boss.
Hey, Aubrey. Hi.
I've got some work to do here.
your call was a pleasant surprise.
come on in to my office.
I have to admit, it was a little, uh, selfish on my part.
I really wanted to see the crime lab.
so I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and bring these down myself.
what are these?
a young woman came into emergency last night.
I figured you needed her clothing for your investigation.
usually somebody comes by from the precinct, but nobody showed.
her death was determined a suicide.
investigation's been closed.
Really?
sounds like you have another opinion, Doctor.
uh, no.
no. I'm way out of my league here, so...
huh. Okay.
well... Yeah, there you go.
I-I didn't mean to bother you, so... Okay.
it was really good to see you, Mac.
let me just mention cadaveric spasm.
instantaneous rigor.
you moonlight as a pathologist?
no.
just got back from Afghanistan.
I was working as a doctor in the Air Force Reserves.
Really?
Yeah.
looks like you know something about that yourself.
cadaveric spasm?
Yeah. Occasionally, I would notice a soldier's hand that was clinched with nothing inside.
the rigor marks the last activity of the victim and is usually associated with a violent death.
the soldiers' clenched hands were trying to hold on to their weapon.
Yes.
last night, I noticed Marina Garito's left hand was tightly clenched the same way.
clear!
you're sure it was her left hand?
Yeah.
mac, this is the first sign that suggests that Marina may have struggled or resisted.
now, the reason Sid didn't see it is because by the time he received the body from the hospital, rigor had broken.
it doesn't rule out suicide.
Sid's GSR result still puts the gun in Marina's right hand.
but it gives us cause to investigate.
Yes, it does.
all right.
now, cadaveric spasm captures their last attempt to grasp onto something to save themselves.
I believe that's exactly what happened with Marina.
she reached out to grab onto something, to clench something.
the question is what?
and why?
child's BODY FOUND: NOT Luke Garito
crime SCENE INVESTIGATION Detective Stella Bonasera
no witnesses.
most of Marina's neighbors were either sleeping or not at home.
one guy thought he heard a ruckus, called the police, but never bothered getting off his couch to check things out.
possible signs of a struggle.
you're not buying it?
a gunshot wound to the stomach's pretty effective, but not instantly fatal, right?
let's say Marina fires the gun...
...and she knocks all this stuff over as she stumbles across the floor to try to get to her phone to call for help.
cause we both know, most suicide attempts fail because the victims regret the act the moment they commit to it.
or...
marina was struggling with the shooter for the gun.
it discharges.
he marks her prints on the gun, flees.
she's still conscious.
so she struggles over to get her cell phone and call for help.
either way, it could be the cell phone that her left hand was clutching, and she fell unconscious before she was able to make the call, but...
there are no signs of forced entry, Stella.
so it was someone she knew.
a hamburger and fries is not exactly a last meal.
FLACK: Are you kidding me?
these are from the Shake Shack.
all right, I get it.
more evidence supports suicide than murder.
you think I'm trying too hard?
we all have a Marina Garito, Stella.
John Brennan calls the station house once a month, and anyone who answers the phone gets a story about how his wife was murdered, and the man who's responsible is still out there.
and it breaks your heart, because you don't have any answers for him.
but what can you do?
tell me. On those Mondays when you got those calls, after you hung up the phone, what did you do?
you can't do much.
because you're chasing bad guys who are out there right now, and the evidence on those old cases gets cold and the witnesses don't remember half of what they used to, and...
you're right. But I just can't stop thinking that I should have done more to help her find her brother.
you took her calls every Monday.
that's a lot.
humor me.
let's search the place before we head out.
sure.
Thanks.
FLACK: Nothing out here screams breaking and entering.
I'm going down the fire escape.
Hey, Flack! I'm on him!
FLACK: I'm on it!
FLACK: I got him!
it's Flack. I need backup at the Westside Rec Center.
what the hell? Oh, my God.
Freeze!
Dr. Burcham to Room 101.
MARINA: My mother was crying.
there was so much noise, so many people.
my stepfather was talking to the police.
he remembered the sound of an ice cream truck.
my brother's bike was on the stoop, but he wasn't.
and the hardest part of it all...
that I looked exactly like him.
twins.
I was a constant reminder of what had happened, of who was missing.
and I hated my face.
my mother died, a year later.
all right, I'm gonna write you a prescription for the pain.
thank you.
hey.- hey
she's gonna be fine.
Thanks.
before you even think about it, I am not going on sick leave.
didn't cross my mind.
I do want you to take it easy, though.
the man who attacked you, you're sure it was Tony Dirisa?
Absolutely.
it was Marina's stepfather.
description of Dirisa just went out on Teletype.
all commands have been notified: airports, bus terminals, train stations.
plus we're sitting on his job and all his regular haunts.
well, despite all that's happened, we still don't have proof that Marina's death was murder and not suicide.
she was murdered because she found the answer.
that's what she meant when she said she was getting close.
she found her brother's killer, and her brother's killer found her.
I put my money on Dirisa.
he was a person of interest when Luke Garito went missing, but there wasn't enough evidence to even arrest them.
well, there was a reason why he was in that apartment.
I think the answer to that is floating in a blue tile pool.
HAWKES: Vesicles just underneath the skin. You're sure?
positive. Common with acute irritant contact dermatitis.
more specifically, a metal allergy.
suggests she came into contact with something she was allergic to just prior to death.
confirms my findings.
I swabbed the palm of Marina's hand and found very small traces of nickel.
which would cause this type eczematous reaction.
possibly a clue to what she was gripping in her left hand.
Sid, you called me down here to confirm your discovery of a rash?
I'm a little cautious after this morning, Sheldon.
I feel better with a second opinion.
I would've concluded suicide same as you.
you don't know that for sure.
experience is a curse sometimes.
things start to get routine, and at the first sign of an answer, you leap in a familiar direction without asking, "Is there another possibility?
the forensic clues at a scene and on the victim's body tells us what path to take in an autopsy.
that's something we don't dictate.
if a victim's found with ligature marks on the neck, we're not considering poisoning as cause of death.
you taught me that.
I know.
I just feel bad.
we're not always right, but it's not always because we're wrong.
Hey, how's Stella?
tough as ever.
good.
this French fry is not a French fry.
type MATCH
Hey, what do you got?
it's foam.
the French fry I collected at the scene?
it's morphology is a match to polyurethane;
everyday furniture foam.
the French fry is foam.
and the rest of them?
greasy French fries.
HAWKES: GSR. I swabbed that from the terminal surface of the foam fry.
foam and GSR. - Foam and GSR.
it's possible...
what?
GSR is gunshot residue.
if what I'm thinking is right, it would explain everything.
I'll get Mac and Stella.
you get Adam, tell him to bring his pillow.
where we going? Reconstruction.
what are you thinking?
you'll find out!
and there you go.
ross: That looks exactly like a French fry.
when the bullet perforated the soft material of the pillow, it punched out a piece of foam.
the bullet was forcing what was in front of it out.
right. And when the heat from the bullet made initial contact it left these dark edges, leaving behind GSR, making it look like a French fry.
which explains why the first on the scene never found it.
HAWKES: Right.
BONASERA: It looked exactly like the other food in the apartment- that's what I thought it was.
we've just proven Marina's suicide was murder.
Really?
I-I don't get it.
how did we do that?
the French fry...
the foam slice found in Marina's living room is proof that a pillow was used as a silencer.
anyone who's committing suicide isn't concerned with muffling the sound of a gun.
which proves that Marina did not kill herself.
all right, that leaves us with Tony Dirisa.
okay, I'm with you all the way up until the Tony Dirisa part.
the pillow I collected at the pool didn't have a bullet hole in it.
it's the psychology of guilt, Adam.
Tony Dirisa shot Marina and used a pillow as a silencer.
the whole French fry thing. Right.
and then he took that pillow with him when he fled the scene.
okay, makes sense; he doesn't want to leave the evidence.
LINDSAY: But then he started to overthink things.
a guilty conscience needs no accuser.
Tony Dirisa went back to the apartment to get this pillow, not because it had a bullet hole in it;
because it didn't.
he thought it would seem weird that the sofa had one pillow, and somehow we'd be on to him.
his biggest mistake was going back.
if he hadn't, we might never have connected him to the French fry.
okay, we're done. We got him.
BONASERA: No.
we can only prove that he took the pillow.
we need to put Tony Dirisa in that apartment and put that gun in his hand.
what the hell just happened?
I'm not liking the body language.
the bullet that Sid extracted from Marina Garito is definitely from this gun.
it's the same gun that the guys from the 37th recovered from her apartment.
but no connection to Dirisa?
no. I was hoping to match the DNA on the weapon to Dirisa's blood????
but it was wiped down pretty good.
I did, however, get a case-to-case hit on the bullet's striae.
this gun was used a week ago in a bodega robbery, and a bullet was pulled from the wall.
they get a description of the shooter?
asian-american male between the age of 17 to 20.
so a kid robs a bodega, and then sold or discarded the gun, and somehow Tony Dirisa ended up with it?
Mm-hmm. Now, look, I know this is kind of a long shot, but I can chase this, boss, okay?
we get the surveillance footage from the bodega, hopefully ID the kid, he gets a little nervous 'cause he now thinks he's connected to a gun that just killed a woman, he flips, we ID the guy that he just sold the gun to.
well, if it's Tony Dirisa, great.
if it's not, you're chasing every place the gun's been in the last week.
could be three people, could be 20.
I think we're running out of time, Adam.
Dirisa's gotta be nervous.
he knows we know it's him.
the next logical step would be to get out of town, and we got to find him before he does.
I need a witness.
what is this?
uh... a swatch of fabric.
I saw those in Marina's apartment.
she as a designer for her stepfather's textile company.
right. Looks normal, yeah?
Yeah.
does it feel normal?
Yes. Yes. All right.
well, now grab the other end with these.
okay, you ready?
what are we doing?
just give it a second.
and boom.
what the hell was that?
the answer.
Marina's hand was clenched around this piece of fabric.
it's imported from Italy to one specific textile distributor here in the city,
Dirisa Textile.
okay, you guys are gonna have to get to the razzle-dazzle part 'cause I'm not seeing anything we can make an arrest on.
it's memory textile.
external stimulus, like temperature, cause the fabric to change shape.
Danny: And it first reacted to the heat from the light table.
it's made out of equal parts nickel and titanium.
Nitinol, which is an alloy known for its unique properties of super elasticity and shape memory.
and Hawke said that Sid found a rash on Marina's hand.
it was an allergic reaction to nickel.
it's from this swatch of fabric.
but Marina wasn't holding anything at the scene or at the hospital. ,
Yes, she was they just didn't see it because Marina's body temperature warmed the swatch and it retracted.
it was hidden under the folds of her fingers.
postmortem, her body temperature significantly dropped, causing the fabric to uncoil, flatten and easily slip through her fingers.
probably in the ambulance or in the gurney, which is why it was included in the collection of her clothes.
so Marina clenched this fabric in her fist because she knew she held the clue to her killer's identity.
MARINA: Tony married my mom when we were five.
he loved her a lot.
but you could tell that kids were a big adjustment.
young MARINA: Ready or not, here I come.
how many times I got to tell you to put that bike away.
MARINA: He tried really hard.
he took care of me.
he and Luke...
it was tough for them.
I... I don't think he meant to do it.
you're not my dad!
get over here. Let me go!
let go! Not your father, huh?
stop it!
my arm! Ah!
Oh, Luke. Luke, I'm sorry. Luke?
MARINA: I stayed in there for a while, hoping this-this isn't real, and I was wondering who's going to take care of me.
: what will happen to me if I tell the truth?
and would my mom love me anymore if they both went away?
no one asked me what happened.
so I just forgot.
what's going on?
one of Flack's CI's just got an emergency request for some forged documents- passport and ID.
sounds like Tony Dirisa's getting out of town.
Yep. And Flack and I are going to go help him through security.
MARINA: "Detective Bonasera, "I want to thank you for all that you've done "in trying to help me find my brother.
finally, I can put this all to rest now.
I know what happened.
I know who did it.
I knew all along.
repressed memory- that's what they call it.
I was in college and someone asked me about my missing brother.
and he said why had nothing been done.
so I got angry, and I started to ask my own questions.
talked to investigators, looked for answers.
two weeks ago...
I went back there.
back to the house where we lived.
and I remembered it all.
is this where you pointed the gun right before you shot her, huh?
or was it here? Hey, let go of me.
take it easy, Mr. Dirisa, all right?
you've got the right to remain silent.
it was an accident. You got to believe me. What happened?
pillow got in the way and the gun accidentally went off?
you've got the right to an attorney.
want to hear this now or on the ride over?
if you cannot find an attorney...
all by herself, she figured it out.
the timeline, the conflicting witness accounts, the-the ice cream truck that never existed.
she confided in you.
told you everything she knew every step of the way.
Tony: We both wanted answers.
BONASERA: Oh, sure you did.
only you wanted to know what she knew.
how close Marina was getting to learning the truth.
I would never do anything to hurt Marina.
you panicked.
just like you did when you killed Luke.
did she look at you differently, Tony?
is that what it was?
I didn't kill her.
Yes, you did.
only what you didn't know, what we all didn't know, was that Marina had ended her commitment to search for Luke.
she was finally letting it all go.
she was letting you go.
the e-mail to her friends was mistaken as a suicide note only because she was found dead.
listen to her words.
it's time I end it all.
bonasera & MARINA: "Free myself.
and this is the only way I know how.
MARINA: "Leaving here is my only option.
bonasera & MARINA: Tony, we're both free.
she knew it was you.
you panicked for nothing.
you killed her for nothing.
she was letting you go.
Hey, Sid.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
no, you were right.
and I got defensive because I thought, what if she's right?
it reminds me that
I may be a little off my game.
I'm getting old.
you are wise, my friend.
: if only.
I got a letter in the mail today from Marina.
yeah?
said she was moving to Boston.
Mr. Brennan?
man: Yeah. Who is this?
Hey, it's Detective Don Flack.
how you doing?
I'm fine. What can I help you with?
well, I was hoping that you and I could get together.
you know something about my wife?
no, sir, I don't have any answers, but I'm sure as hell hoping that you and I can find some.
Really? Wow, Detective, it has been a long time.
Yeah, it has been a long time.
MARINA: Three years after the day it all happened,
I was 11...
and I remember coming home thinking that he's here.
he's back.
he's here. Luke.
I was sure he was hiding in our secret place.
young MARINA: Ready or not, here I come.
but he wasn't.
and I remembered him telling me that one day he's going to hide in a place that I would never find him.
but I did. I did find him.
this is Officer Henderson! I'm in pursuit of Shane Casey!
he's going across. Where the hell is Aviation?!
this guy's insane!
you have no idea!
Hey, it's over, man.
just stay there! We'll get someone over to you!
pilot Hang on! Assistance is on the way.
come ON
Flack, he's still trying to get away!
come ON
Flack, what the hell are you doing?
he's not worth it! Let him go!
you're under arrest, you crazy son of a bitch!
they're holding Shane Casey at the DA's office?
usual theatrics.
the DA and the commissioner want a perp walk.
parade him in front of the world to show that Batman's got nothing on them.
what's your sign?
Hey. I'm talking to you.
what's your sign? Aries.
Aries.
okay, here we go.
with the sun aligned with Jupiter and behind Pluto...
it's best you not bend over for the soap later today, but think positive, love can be found in the strangest places.
see, chin up. It ain't all bad.
then again...
Shane Casey's killed, like, what, six people?
intelligence is always trumped by an opportunity to make the front page.
you have a cigarette?
what, you on crack? You can't smoke in here.
what are you, a little bitch?
did you just call me a little bitch?
I just called you a little bitch.
you really are as crazy as they say you are.
guilty.
Yeah, all right.
what the hell.
here. Smoke up, sonny
they actually asked if we wanted in on the perp walk.
Oh, they know us so well.
I'd be happier escorting him to a Pris
NYPD. Move! Move!
back up!
I'll put a bullet in her head, I swear to God!
I don't have a clean shot.
you shoot her, we'll drop you before she hits the ground, Shane.
don't do it.
called in a level three mobilization.
Manhattan task force is setting up a perimeter, closing streets-- excuse me and evacuating some buildings.
plus we got extra patrol in the subways.
you want car stops at bridges and tunnels?
no, no, he's not leaving the city.
what makes you say that?
he made his way from Pennsylvania to here, the whole time wanting to be seen.
he's got unfinished business.
we need to track down where he's been.
okay, where do you want to start?
with him.
what do you want from me, Flack?
it's like I told you.
I'm standing on the corner when I see the guy.
he's staring right at me.
I'm thinking, you got to be kidding me.
that's the guy.
he gives me one of these stupid grins, he books, I chase after him, I call it in.
five minutes later, you're right behind me.
Casey's just walking down the street?
Yeah. FLACK: And, what, he's wearing a shirt that says, "I just escaped from Pennsylvania State Prison, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt"?
listen to me, Nicky, we're not Internal Affairs, all right?
we don't care where you were.
we want to know where Shane was.
what were you doing on the corner?
I was meeting a CI.
what's his name?
I can't tell you that.
at your usual meeting spot?
I can't tell you that either.
you call him, or did he call you?
I'm not at liberty to say.
look, I'm going to make this real easy for you.
you're going to tell me where you were and when this went down or I'm going to subpoena your phone records, prove there was no call from any CI, and make sure you're washing cars over at the motor pool.
you at liberty to say now?
I was at the Old Cash Bar.
place over on 38th?
the one with all the bills on the wall? Yeah.
look, I've been, you know...seeing the bartender there.
I was on duty.
I know I wasn't supposed to be there, but I wasn't drinking.
Oh, man!
we were just talking, when, all of a sudden, this girl comes up to me...
excuse me-- Officer?
...says there's a guy in the back playing darts who looks like the guy who's been all over the news during the prison riots.
Shane CASEY ARRESTED AGAIN "Shane Casey had been on the run since his escape from prison "approximately one month ago.
the fugitive was serving life without parole "after murdering four people.
apparently the killing spree started "when his brother Ian Casey "hung himself in his jail cell "after being convicted of murder in 2006.
Ian Casey allegedly robbed a bar, killing the bartender.
allegedly? No, no, he killed the guy.
you want to know what tomorrow's headline's going to be?
woman allegedly kills her husband for not helping with the laundry.
come on, we were supposed to leave an hour ago.
you see how your mommy talks to me?
I'm pretty sure the beach isn't going anywhere, is it?
think you'd get away with that?
killing you? Yeah.
Absolutely.
you're that confident with your crime scene cleanup skills?
Oh, who said I would clean up anything?
Oh, of course, you wouldn't leave anything behind, right?
no, I would leave everything behind, including me.
I wouldn't flee. Self-defense.
she's going with self-defense.
you were in here folding laundry.
I came in with Lucy to tell you I was leaving you.
leaving me.
the love was gone.
we'd stopped having sex when your impotence problem, and your temper, became too much for me to handle.
so I said good-bye and I turned, and you grabbed me from behind.
it was awful.
I mean, he'd gotten angry before, but never like that, Officer.
the rage in his eyes...
he started choking me.
and I was gasping for air.
and I grabbed the vase and I hit him over the head with it.
I'd be out of the precinct by noon.
I'm genuinely frightened.
I don't want to go on this vacation.
pack.
I'm going to check in with work one more time.
Hey, babe, you see my police academy T-shirt?
it's in there somewhere.
I remember putting it in the dryer.
mac, hey, it's Lindsay.
we were just checking in...
what?
you are kidding. What?
is this a joke? I wish it was.
the geniuses at the top put him in a room with one officer and no bars on the windows.
Oh, brilliant.
so what now?
getting caught was definitely a mistake, but most everything Shane Casey does is deliberate, including being seen.
we're looking into where he was last night.
all right, well, look, we're still here.
do you want us to come in?
no, no, we're fine here.
you two have earned a few days off.
okay, Mac.
do us a favor and catch this guy, okay?
you got it.
he's out.
Hey, they got it covered.
don't worry about it.
let's... Let's get out of town.
okay?
are you ready?
the bartender I was talking to isn't in today.
okay, thanks.
you were right.
he wanted us to know he was here.
but why?
what's he trying to tell us?
did the girl tell you if he was sitting anywhere in particular?
she said he was by the video game earlier, but by the time she grabbed me, he was already gone.
he was right there.
I swear. It was him.
he's been all over the news.
he's gone now.
no, there he is. That's the guy.
that's the same skull that Shane Casey printed on those T-shirts, remember?
that's Shane's inmate number.
he's not done.
what's with the Shane Casey guy, you know?
if he's got something to say, just say it.
we gotta figure out all these clues and riddles and crap.
I mean, what if we couldn't figure it out?
be, like, "Hey, beats me, Stella.
you want to get a coffee?
then what would he do?
I don't think it's that complicated, Adam.
he wants us to figure it out.
the last time he printed coded messages on T-shirts.
that's his game.
he does it to stall us.
it took a while, but Mac figured out it was about his brother's wrongful conviction.
which we were able to prove wasn't a wrongful conviction.
your brother was in this bar.
he was standing right there. He shot the bartender.
I don't want to hear any more of your lies!
here's the most glaring difference.
the serial number has been replaced with symbols.
now, no idea what it means.
hold on.
I've got something.
I'm pretty sure that's on every dollar bill.
it is, but not in this order.
it's supposed to be "e pluribus unum, which means "from many, one.
but in Shane Casey's bill it means "from one, many.
I don't get it. You?
not yet, but we need to figure it out soon.
when Shane Casey goes to work, somebody always pays a price.
Hey, what are you doing? I liked that song.
no, we want to rock out.
right, Luce?
yeah?
exactly. You're outvoted.
whatever.
20 more minutes to paradise.
rock on!
remember that guy? Ethan Ganz.
Shane Casey's former cell mate.
he's got multiple fraud convictions, identity theft using telephone company equipment to eavesdrop on people's conversations.
I figured if he was helping Shane then, he's probably helping him now.
you run him for an address?
I did. His place was empty. Neighbors say they haven't seen him in days.
keep looking. He's our only connection to Casey.
maybe he knows where he is.
any other leads?
too many. Anybody and everybody who sees a Caucasian male with medium-length brown hair is calling it in to the tip line.
what about the bill Shane left in the bar?
Stella, Hawkes and Adam are working it.
keep me posted on Ganz.
all right, the answer has to be in these symbols.
he used numerology in the past, but that doesn't seem to apply here.
the only number we have is four, which represents "creation" in numerology.
I'd say we're overthinking it, that there's a more literal translation, but percentage... parentheses... slash?
well, maybe the two slashes indicate a birth date.
that would fit with "creation.
so, 2004 or 1904?
that means the symbols represent numbers.
Yeah.
okay. Sorry, Adam.
Really?
so maybe the symbols correspond to numbers on the keyboard.
percentage is five. Okay.
closed parentheses is a zero.
okay.
forward slash is a question mark, which doesn't fit, so that would stay the same, Mm-hmm, confirming your date theory.
the exclamation point is a one.
pound a three.
doesn't make any sense.
what if he changed it up on us...and four corresponds to a symbol?
Yeah, the four is a dollar sign.
so it would be 50...
slash, 13, slash...
...dollar sign.
still not seeing it, Stell.
Yeah, me neither.
50, 50... 50 States?
13 colonies?
50 stars.
13 stripes.
it's the American flag.
Yes. It's The American Way.
check this out.
I searched "dollar sign
and "American flag, " and I got this.
the American Way by Emmett Vaughan.
Casey's running with the theme of "dollars.
the bill was folded into a picture frame.
Yeah, and it's currently being housed at the Manhattan Museum of Art.
if we're right, Shane's got something waiting for us there.
...survey traces the career of a Thai-American...
it's among the earliest of his silk screenings, dating back to 1962.
judging from its placement in your museum, I take it it's worth more than just face value?
slightly. At an estimated $43 million.
we do have a strict "You break it, you buy it" policy.
well, don't worry. We'll be very gentle.
you seeing anything? Nope, not yet.
Casey wrote on his bill, "Out of one, many.
get a load of this.
Hey, I've got something.
right here, the words above the pyramid.
now, the real dollar bill says " annuit coeptis.
God has favored our undertakings.
Laquem means "noose.
and nemus is "tree.
all right, Professor, tell me what in the world is Casey trying to tell us now?
okay, hold on a second.
I want to take a picture.
in the car?
we're a hundred yards from the ocean!
I told my mom I'd take a lot of pictures.
besides, relax.
we're not on a shift. We're on vacation.
what? I can just see you when you're 60.
come on! We're only a hundred yards from the ocean!
you know, this is our first family vacation.
someday, you're gonna be really glad I took these pictures.
I am glad right now.
come on.
washington Square Park was not listed as one of Ethan Ganz's hangouts.
sorry. I couldn't resist.
parks Department employee called it in.
he found him around dawn.
this tree is symbolic.
it's called the " Hangman's Tree.
traitors and thieves were hanged from it during the Revolutionary War.
maybe Casey thought Ganz betrayed him somehow.
now he's got a code of ethics?
okay.
that's Danny's company from the police academy.
Yeah, I saw him wearing that T-shirt in the gym the other day.
how the hell did he get his hands on Danny's clothes?
same way He got his hands on this.
this isn't about Ganz at all, is it?
Shane Casey has other plans.
he's after Danny.
Danny and Lindsay didn't say much about their plans, Flack.
we're still trying to find any sort of specific travel itinerary, but all we know for sure is they're headed towards Long Island.
well, I've sent photos with descriptions to both East and South Hampton PDs.
they've already put an alarm out.
any hits on credit cards? No.
but Danny's more like me that way; he'd rather pay cash than pay bills.
I doubt he'll use one unless he has to.
what about their cell phones?
he left his at home.
but we're still trying to triangulate Lindsay's, not to mention voice mails and text messages.
the trouble is, though, Flack, once you get up along the coast, the coverage gets really spotty.
all this technology for catching crooks at our fingertips, and we can't seem to use it to track down two of our own.
I got more bad news, Flack.
we found Shane Casey's prints on one of the building's basement laundry machines.
so he stole Danny's clothes himself.
right. We also found evidence of recent access to a telephone junction box in a building utility room.
picked up Ethan Ganz's prints there.
Hey, it's official. I just booked our trip.
yeah? The same place we talked about?
Mm-hmm. Three days, two nights.
nice.
can you just do me one more favor, though?
what's that?
make sure you pack the blue bikini.
the place we're staying is amazing.
I just checked it out on line.
okay, so, if Ganz was tapping their phone lines, that means he and Shane probably know a hell of a lot more about where Danny and Lindsay are than we do.
Oh, my God, how good does this feel?
not too shabby.
remind me again why we cram ourselves into an overpriced two-bedroom in the city?
you don't like a view of the building next door?
what's the matter?
seriously. Smell that ocean!
I think I smell fish and chips.
I'm hungry. Come on.
excuse me. How you doin'?
Lucy, did you see that birdy up there?
look, look, look, look. Look.
look at all those birdies up there.
do you see them? Mommy... Mommy...
come on. What do you want?
uh, nothing. We're gonna go down to the beach. - Mommy!
now you want to go to the beach? All right.
look over there, look. Left, left, left.
there's a spot.
Yeah, there's a spot...
this big, empty...
Oh, my goodness. All right.
we'll put a blanket down.
how about you put... ? did you bring the towels?
Yep.
any luck reaching Danny and Lindsay?
I've left half a dozen message myself.
and Adam's scouring every inch of their apartment for any info he can find on exactly where they've gone.
Sid, please tell us you got something.
uh, well, I sent Danny's clothes to Layout, in case they can yield any clues.
meanwhile, take a look at this.
note the petechial hemorrhaging of Ethan Ganz's eyes.
bluish tint to the skin.
asphyxiation.
the man did have a noose around his neck, Sid.
Yes, but I also couldn't help noticing there were no rope fibers on his hands, fingernail marks near his throat or secondary ligature patterns of any kind.
so he had no defensive wounds customarily found when a hanging victim struggles to remove the noose.
not one. However, I did find this on the back of his head.
small contusion. Looks like blunt-force trauma, in the shape of a ball-peen hammer maybe?
with a wooden handle, judging by the abrasions I also discovered in his throat.
so he was hit with a hammer, and then choked with it.
so which one killed him?
neither. That was the crab's job.
what?
after I noticed the throat abrasions, I spotted some kind of tracheal obstruction under the fluoroscope...
it was too deep to tweeze from his mouth, so I dove in the other way.
and let's just say it turned outto be quite a fishing expedition.
what is this?
limulus Polyphemus.
the horseshoe crab, if I had to hazard a guess.
I used to step on those in the Hamptons when I was a kid. Hurt like a son of a...
Casey must have surprised Ganz from behind with a blow to the head.
then he stuffed this down his throat while he was unconscious.
and he never came around. I don't get it.
Ethan Ganz had to be the last friend Shane Casey had in this world.
why the hell would he kill him?
because he served his purpose.
and Danny's the endgame.
annuit COEPTIS
MEUS FIDES ERUM PALLIUM
is this Queen Lucy's castle?
Hey, psst. Hmm...
Hey. What?
want to make some dough?
what is this, a Shell game?
get that out of there.
what did Daddy do?
what's Daddy doing?
Oh, whoops.
you know, if we want to get up to the lighthouse before sunset, maybe we should get going.
sounds good.
what do you say, Your Majesty, huh?
shall we storm the castle and tear down the lighthouse?
ready? Come on, sweetie.
let's go, Lucy.
first of all, our crab dollar's signatures are all wrong.
instead of the correct Treasury Department officials, he's written the names William Kidd and Jacob Hand.
that's Captain Kidd, right?
right-- the 18th century pirate who plundered and pillaged his way down the entire Eastern seaboard.
what about the other name?
nothing on Jacob Hand yet, or the significance of the altered numbers.
1796, maybe?
could be a date.
looks like he also changed the pyramid on the back of the bill to a lighthouse.
Yeah. I've already checked.
there's 19 of these on Long Island from Coney to Montauk.
I'm going to run an image search on this one now.
but there's one more thing, Mac.
the Latin inscription beneath it should read, "New order for the ages.
instead it reads, "meus fides erum pallium.
that's "my belief was stolen.
Yeah.
what's Casey's motive here, Mac?
I mean, is he... is he trying to tell us something, or his he just playing with us?
I wish I knew.
either way, we're running out of time.
look at the lighthouse, Luce.
look at that, Lucy.
that is so cool.
here, hold on.
I'm getting a picture of you two.
...really tall! Whoa,
I thought we said we weren't bringing our cell phones.
we did, and I haven't used it once, but my camera battery just died, so... ready?
Oh, that is so cute.
I'm sending that on.
that is...
Hey.
whoa, whoa, I got something.
Lindsay's phone just popped up on the grid.
searching triangulation coordinates.
looks like they're somewhere along the Southern shore.
okay, we're locked on.
they're in Amagansett. There's a lighthouse there.
the Amagansett Point Light built in 1796.
jacob Hand was its first operator.
captain Kidd?
supposedly buried treasure in its base.
so one kept the light...
while the other hid in the shadows.
contact local PD, get on the horn, to the U. S. Coast Guard.
tell them we're on our way.
Taylor Detectives en route from 34th heliport to Long Island.
you ready, Luce? Here we go.
Hello!
earth to Messers.
this is ground control to Messer family.
we having fun yet?
Oh, man, you remember me, don't you, Danny?
and who is this, the little missus?
Hi. Shane Casey.
nice work.
and who's is this little ball of sunshine?
what do you want from us, Casey?
I don't want anything from them.
get out of here.
go to hell.
okay.
you two can join him.
babe, take her and go.
Danny... Take her and go.
please, I...
I love you.
I love you. I love you.
go...
Bye.
Yeah, right there.
pilot Coast Guard 623, on approach to Amagansett Lighthouse.
going in.
I'll meet you there.
let's go.
I've been waiting for this, Messer.
all right.
here I am.
obviously, you knew I would be.
so, what is it that you want?
shut up!
what do you want? What do I want?
to shoot the frickin' messenger!
you all right? Yeah.
Oh, man.
sounds like the cavalry's here.
too bad they won't be able to stop me from killing you.
now, why would you want to do something like that?
Oh, please.
don't tell me you already forgot about my brother.
your brother?
it was a robbery gone bad.
he offed a bartender, and then he...offed himself in prison because he couldn't live with what he did.
and you know why?!
cause he couldn't live with life's two most important lessons.
what are those?
what? Guilt...is a useless emotion. Yeah?
okay.
Yeah, what else?
ignorance is bliss, my friend.
something that you pretty much screwed all to hell for me.
how is that, man?
how is that? My brother...was all I had, okay?
I mean, man, he was the closest thing that I had to a hero!
and you know what?
you know what?
thinking he was innocent, going after all those... people that put him away
it felt good!
it felt sexy!
and then you and all your friends at the Science Club had to go and ruin it for me.
that's right.
you hear me, Messer?
look, I told you then, and I will tell you again:
your brother is a murderer, just like you.
that's right!
and you put me away, just like him!
guess what?
I wasn't like Ian.
I can live with what I've done!
the only thing I can't live with is knowing that your smug ass was out here pretending to be a good guy.
all right.
and that's why you escaped from prison?
I went through a lot...a lot...
...to shut you up.
do what you gotta do, you sick son of a bitch! Do it!
now!
sick bastard!
hold on to me.
don't worry, Messer.
I will.
have they found his body yet?
the Coast Guard's sweeping the area as we speak, but they don't hold out much hope.
the tide was high, and that point's pretty treacherous.
drift patterns could carry his body anywhere from Fire Island to Jersey Shore.
Yeah, well, whatever it takes to finish up Shane Casey once and for all.
Yeah, you got that right.
you talk to Lindsay?
Yeah. They were too worked-up to stay.
figured they'd catch a train back into the city and sleep the rest of the week off in the confines of their apartment.
that's not the vacation they had in mind.
no, but at least they have each other.
home, sweet home.
Yeah.
she go down all right?
Yup.
she definitely needed a nap.
she's not the only one.
I take it all back.
what's that?
everything I said about our apartment.
I don't ever want to leave here again.
it's fine with me.
that's what pizza delivery's for.
I'm not sure how much longer we can keep doing this.
I'm tired of feeling like I've lost you.
I'm right here.
I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere.
you promise?
I promise.
here I come, baby. Here I come.
hello.
Oh, my God.
this is Officer Henderson! I'm in pursuit of Shane Casey!
he's going across. Where the hell is Aviation?!
this guy's insane!
you have no idea!
Hey, it's over, man.
just stay there! We'll get someone over to you!
hang on! Assistance is on the way.
Flack, he's still trying to get away!
Flack, what the hell are you doing?
he's not worth it! Let him go!
you're under arrest, you crazy son of a bitch!
they're holding Shane Casey at the DA's office?
usual theatrics.
the DA and the commissioner want a perp walk.
parade him in front of the world to show that Batman's got nothing on them.
what's your sign?
I'm talking to you. What's your sign?
Aries. - Aries.
okay, here we go.
with the sun aligned with Jupiter and behind Pluto...
it's best you not bend over for the soap later today, but think positive, love can be found in the strangest places.
see, chin up. It ain't all bad.
then again...
Shane Casey's killed, like, what, six people?
intelligence is always trumped by an opportunity to make the front page.
you have a cigarette?
what, you on crack? You can't smoke in here.
what are you, a little bitch?
did you just call me a little bitch?
I just called you a little bitch.
you really are as crazy as they say you are.
guilty.
Yeah, all right.
what the hell.
here.
smoke up, sonny
they actually asked if we wanted in on the perp walk.
Oh, they know us so well. I'd be happier escorting him to a Pris
NYPD. Move! Move!
back up!
I'll put a bullet in her head, I swear to God!
I don't have a clean shot.
you shoot her, we'll drop you before she hits the ground, Shane.
don't do it.
called in a level three mobilization.
Manhattan task force is setting up a perimeter, closing streets-- excuse me--and evacuating some buildings.
plus we got extra patrol in the subways.
you want car stops at bridges and tunnels?
no, no, he's not leaving the city.
what makes you say that?
he made his way from Pennsylvania to here, the whole time wanting to be seen.
he's got unfinished business. We need to track down where he's been.
okay, where do you want to start?
with him.
what do you want from me, Flack?
it's like I told you. I'm standing on the corner when I see the guy.
he's staring right at me.
I'm thinking, you got to be kidding me.
that's the guy.
he gives me one of these stupid grins, he books, I chase after him,
I call it in.
five minutes later, you're right behind me.
Casey's just walking down the street?
Yeah.
and, what, he's wearing a shirtthat says,"I just escaped from Pennsylvania State Prison, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt"?
listen to me, Nicky, we're not Internal Affairs, all right?
we don't care where you were.
we want to know where Shane was.
what were you doing on the corner?
I was meeting a CI. - What's his name?
I can't tell you that. - At your usual meeting spot?
I can't tell you that either.
you call him, or did he call you?
I'm not at liberty to say.
look, I'm going to make this real easy for you.
you're going to tell me where you were and when this went down or I'm going to subpoena your phone records, prove there was no call from any CI, and make sure you're washing cars over at the motor pool.
you at liberty to say now?
I was at the Old Cash Bar.
place over on 38th?
the one with all the bills on the wall? - Yeah.
look, I've been, you know...
seeing the bartender there.
I was on duty. I know I wasn't supposed to be there, but I wasn't drinking.
Oh, man!
we were just talking, when, all of a sudden, this girl comes up to me...
excuse me-- Officer?
...says there's a guy in the back playing darts who looks like the guy who's been all over the news during the prison riots.
Shane Casey had been on the run since his escape from prison "approximately one month ago.
the fugitive was serving life without parole "after murdering four people.
apparently the killing spree started "when his brother Ian Casey "hung himself in his jail cell "after being convicted of murder in 2006.
Ian Casey allegedly robbed a bar, killing the bartender.
allegedly? No, no, he killed the guy.
you want to know what tomorrow's headline's going to be?
woman allegedly kills her husband for not helping with the laundry.
come on, we were supposed to leave an hour ago.
you see how your mommy talks to me?
I'm pretty sure the beach isn't going anywhere, is it?
think you'd get away with that?
killing you? - Yeah.
Absolutely.
you're that confident with your crime scene cleanup skills?
Oh, who said I would clean up anything?
Oh, of course, you wouldn't leave anything behind, right?
no, I would leave everything behind, including me.
I wouldn't flee.
self-defense.
she's going with self-defense.
you were in here folding laundry. I came in with Lucy to tell you I was leaving you.
leaving me.
the love was gone.
we'd stopped having sex when your impotence problem, and your temper, became too much for me to handle.
so I said good-bye and I turned, and you grabbed me from behind.
it was awful.
I mean, he'd gotten angry before, but never like that, Officer.
the rage in his eyes...
he started choking me.
and I was gasping for air.
and I grabbed the vase and I hit him over the head with it.
I'd be out of the precinct by noon.
I'm genuinely frightened. I don't want to go on this vacation.
pack.
I'm going to check in with work one more time.
Hey, babe, you see my police academy T-shirt?
it's in there somewhere. I remember putting it in the dryer.
mac, hey, it's Lindsay. We were just checking in...
what?
you are kidding. - What?
Shane Casey. Is this a joke?
I wish it was. The geniuses at the top put him in a room with one officer and no bars on the windows.
Oh, brilliant. So what now?
getting caught was definitely a mistake, but most everything Shane Casey does is deliberate, including being seen
we're looking into where he was last night.
all right, well, look, we're still here. Do you want us to come in?
no, no, we're fine here. You two have earned a few days off.
okay, Mac.
do us a favor and catch this guy, okay?
you got it.
he's out.
Hey, they got it covered. Don't worry about it.
let's... Let's get out of town.
okay?
are you ready?
the bartender I was talking to isn't in today.
okay, thanks.
you were right.
he wanted us to know he was here.
but why?
what's he trying to tell us?
did the girl tell you if he was sitting anywhere in particular?
she said he was by the video game earlier, but by the time she grabbed me, he was already gone.
he was right there.
I swear. It was him.
he's been all over the news.
he's gone now.
no, there he is. That's the guy.
that's the same skull that Shane Casey printed on those T-shirts, remember?
that's Shane's inmate number.
he's not done.
what's with the Shane Casey guy, you know?
if he's got something to say, just say it.
we gotta figure out all these clues and riddles and crap.
I mean, what if we couldn't figure it out?
be, like,"Hey, beats me, Stella. You want to get a coffee?
then what would he do?
I don't think it's that complicated, Adam.
he wants us to figure it out.
the last time he printed coded messages on T-shirts. That's his game.
he does it to stall us.
it took a while, but Mac figured out it was about his brother's wrongful conviction.
which we were able to prove wasn't a wrongful conviction.
your brother was in this bar. He was standing right there. He shot the bartender.
I don't want to hear any more of your lies!
here's the most glaring difference.
the serial number has been replaced with symbols.
now, no idea what it means.
hold on. I've got something.
I'm pretty sure that's on every dollar bill.
it is, but not in this order.
it's supposed to be "e pluribus unum,
which means "from many, one.
but in Shane Casey's bill it means "from one, many.
I don't get it. You?
not yet, but we need to figure it out soon.
when Shane Casey goes to work, somebody always pays a price.
Hey, what are you doing? I liked that song.
no, we want to rock out.
right, Luce? Yeah?
exactly. You're outvoted. - Whatever.
20 more minutes to paradise.
rock on!
remember that guy? - Ethan Ganz.
Shane Casey's former cell mate.
he's got multiple fraud convictions, identity theft using telephone company equipment to eavesdrop on people's conversations.
I figured if he was helping Shane then, he's probably helping him now.
you run him for an address? - I did. His place was empty.
neighbors say they haven't seen him in days.
keep looking. He's our only connection to Casey. Maybe he knows where he is. Any other leads?
too many.
anybody and everybody who sees a Caucasian male with medium-length brown hair is calling it in to the tip line.
what about the bill Shane left in the bar?
Stella, Hawkes and Adam are working it.
keep me posted on Ganz.
all right, the answer has to be in these symbols.
he used numerology in the past, but that doesn't seem to apply here.
the only number we have is four, which represents "creation" in numerology.
I'd say we're overthinking it, that there's a more literal translation, but percentage... parentheses... slash?
well, maybe the two slashes indicate a birth date.
that would fit with "creation.
so, 2004 or 1904?
that means the symbols represent numbers.
Yeah.
okay. Sorry, Adam.
Really?
so maybe the symbols correspond to numbers on the keyboard.
percentage is five. - Okay.
closed parentheses is a zero. - Okay.
forward slash is a question mark, which doesn't fit, so that would stay the same, Mm-hmm.
confirming your date theory.
the exclamation point is a one.
pound a three.
doesn't make any sense.
what if he changed it up on us...
and four corresponds to a symbol?
Yeah, the four is a dollar sign. So it would be 50...
slash, 13, slash...
...dollar sign.
still not seeing it, Stell.
Yeah, me neither.
50 States?
13 colonies?
50 stars. - 13 stripes.
it's the American flag. - Yes.
it's The American Way.
check this out. I searched "dollar sign
and "American flag," and I got this.
the American Way by Emmett Vaughan.
Casey's running with the theme of "dollars.
the bill was folded into a picture frame.
Yeah, and it's currently being housed at the Manhattan Museum of Art.
if we're right, Shane's got something waiting for us there.
...survey traces the career of a Thai-American...
it's among the earliest of his silk screenings, dating back to 1962.
judging from its placement in your museum, I take it it's worth more than just face value?
slightly. At an estimated $43 million.
we do have a strict "You break it, you buy it" policy.
well, don't worry. We'll be very gentle.
you seeing anything?
Nope, not yet.
Casey wrote on his bill, "Out of one, many.
get a load of this.
Hey, I've got something.
right here, the words above the pyramid.
Laquem Nemus"?
now, the real dollar bill says " annuit coeptis.
God has favored our undertakings.
Laquem means "noose.
and nemus is "tree." - All right, Professor, tell me what in the world is Casey trying to tell us now?
okay, hold on a second. I want to take a picture.
in the car?
we're a hundred yards from the ocean!
I told my mom I'd take a lot of pictures.
besides, relax. We're not on a shift. We're on vacation.
what? - I can just see you when you're 60.
come on! We're only a hundred yards from the ocean!
you know, this is our first family vacation.
someday, you're gonna be really glad I took these pictures.
I am glad right now.
come on.
washington Square Park was not listed as one of Ethan Ganz's hangouts.
sorry. I couldn't resist.
parks Department employee called it in. He found him around dawn.
this tree is symbolic.
it's called the " Hangman's Tree.
traitors and thieves were hanged from it during the Revolutionary War.
maybe Casey thought Ganz betrayed him somehow.
that guy's, like, five nuggets short of a Happy Meal.
now he's got a code of ethics?
okay.
98-06."That's Danny's company from the police academy.
Yeah, I saw him wearing that T-shirt in the gym the other day.
how the hell did he get his hands on Danny's clothes?
same way he got his hands on this.
this isn't about Ganz at all, is it?
Shane Casey has other plans.
he's after Danny.
Danny and Lindsay didn't say much about their plans, Flack.
we're still trying to find any sort of specific travel itinerary, but all we know for sure is they're headed towards Long Island.
well, I've sent photos with descriptions to both East and South Hampton PDs.
they've already put an alarm out.
any hits on credit cards? - No.
but Danny's more like me that way;he'd rather pay cash than pay bills.
I doubt he'll use one unless he has to.
what about their cell phones?
he left his at home.
but we're still trying to triangulate Lindsay's, not to mention voice mails and text messages.
the trouble is, though, Flack, once you get up along the coast, the coverage gets really spotty.
all this technology for catching crooks at our fingertips, and we can't seem to use it to track down two of our own.
I got more bad news, Flack.
we found Shane Casey's prints on one of the building's basement laundry machines.
so he stole Danny's clothes himself.
right. We also found evidence of recent access to a telephone junction box in a building utility room.
picked up Ethan Ganz's prints there.
Hey, it's official. I just booked our trip.
yeah? The same place we talked about?
three days, two nights. - Nice.
can you just do me one more favor, though?
what's that? - Make sure you pack the blue bikini.
the place we're staying is amazing. I just checked it out on line.
okay, so, if Ganz was tapping their phone lines, that means he and Shane probably know a hell of a lot more about where Danny and Lindsay are than we do.
Oh, my God, how good does this feel?
not too shabby.
remind me again why we cram ourselves into an overpriced two-bedroom in the city?
you don't like a view of the building next door? What's the matter?
seriously. Smell that ocean!
I think I smell fish and chips. I'm hungry. Come on.
excuse me. How you doin'?
Lucy, did you see that birdy up there?
look, look, look, look. Look. Look at all those birdies up there.
do you see them? - Mommy... Mommy...
come on. What do you want? Uh, nothing. We're gonna goUh, nothing. We're gonna go - Mommy! - down to the beach.
now you want to go to the beach? All right. Look over there, look. Left, left, left.
there's a spot. - Yeah, there's a spot...
this big, empty...
Oh, my goodness. All right.
we'll put a blanket down.
how about you put... ? did you bring the towels? - Yep.
any luck reaching Danny and Lindsay?
I've left half a dozen message myself.
and Adam's scouring every inch of their apartment for any info he can find on exactly where they've gone.
Sid, please tell us you got something.
uh, well, I sent Danny's clothes to Layout, in case they can yield any clues.
meanwhile, take a look at this.
note the petechial hemorrhaging of Ethan Ganz's eyes.
bluish tint to the skin. - Asphyxiation.
the man did have a noose around his neck, Sid.
Yes, but I also couldn't help noticing there were no rope fibers on his hands, fingernail marks near his throat or secondary ligature patterns of any kind.
so he had no defensive wounds customarily found when a hanging victim struggles to remove the noose.
not one. However,
I did find this on the back of his head.
small contusion. Looks like blunt-force trauma, in the shape of a ball-peen hammer maybe?
with a wooden handle, judging by the abrasions
I also discovered in his throat.
so he was hit with a hammer, and then choked with it.
so which one killed him?
neither. That was the crab's job. - What?
after I noticed the throat abrasions,
I spotted some kind of tracheal obstruction under the fluoroscope...
it was too deep to tweeze from his mouth, so I dove in the other way.
and let's just say it turned out to be quite a fishing expedition.
what is this?
limulus Polyphemus.
the horseshoe crab, if I had to hazard a guess.
I used to step on those in the Hamptons when I was a kid. Hurt like a son of a...
Casey must have surprised Ganz from behind with a blow to the head.
then he stuffed this down his throat while he was unconscious.
and he never came around.
I don't get it. Ethan Ganz had to be the last friend Shane Casey had in this world.
why the hell would he kill him?
because he served his purpose.
and Danny's the endgame.
is this Queen Lucy's castle?
what? - Want to make some dough?
what is this, a Shell game?
get that out of there.
what did Daddy do?
what's Daddy doing?
you know, if we want to get up to the lighthouse before sunset, maybe we should get going.
sounds good. What do you say, Your Majesty, huh?
shall we storm the castle and tear down the lighthouse?
ready? - Come on, sweetie.
let's go, Lucy.
first of all, our crab dollar's signatures are all wrong.
instead of the correct Treasury Department officials, he's written the names William Kidd and Jacob Hand.
that's Captain Kidd, right?
right-- the 18th century pirate who plundered and pillaged his way down the entire Eastern seaboard.
what about the other name?
nothing on Jacob Hand yet, or the significance of the altered numbers.
1796, maybe?
could be a date.
hmm. Looks like he also changed the pyramid on the back of the bill to a lighthouse.
Yeah. I've already checked. There's 19 of these on Long Island from Coney to Montauk.
I'm going to run an image search on this one now.
but there's one more thing, Mac.
the Latin inscription beneath it should read, - "New order for the ages." - Instead it reads,"meus fides erum pallium.
that's "my belief was stolen.
Yeah. What's Casey's motive here, Mac?
I mean, is he... is he trying to tell us something, or his he just playing with us?
I wish I knew. Either way, we're running out of time.
look at the lighthouse, Luce. - Look at that, Lucy.
that is so cool. Here, hold on. I'm getting a picture of you two.
I thought we said we weren't bringing our cell phones.
we did, and I haven't used it once, but my camera battery just died, so... ready?
Oh, that is so cute.
I'm sending that on.
that is...
whoa, whoa, I got something.
Lindsay's phone just popped up on the grid.
searching triangulation coordinates.
looks like they're somewhere along the Southern shore.
okay, we're locked on.
they're in Amagansett. - There's a lighthouse there.
the Amagansett Point Light built in 1796.
jacob Hand was its first operator.
captain Kidd?
supposedly buried treasure in its base.
so one kept the light... - While the other hid in the shadows.
contact local PD, get on the horn, to the U. S. Coast Guard.
tell them we're on our way.
Taylor Detectives en route from 34th heliport to Long Island.
T-minus ten seconds and counting to liftoff. You ready, Luce? Here we go.
Hello!
earth to Messers.
this is ground control to Messer family.
we having fun yet?
Oh, man, you remember me, don't you, Danny?
and who is this, the little missus?
Hi. Shane Casey.
nice work.
and who's is this little ball of sunshine?
what do you want from us, Casey?
I don't want anything from them.
get out of here.
go to hell.
okay.
you two can join him.
babe, take her and go.
Danny... - Take her and go.
please, I...
I love you. - I love you. I love you.
go...
Bye.
Yeah, right there.
coast Guard 623, on approach to Amagansett Lighthouse.
going in. - I'll meet you there.
let's go.
I've been waiting for this, Messer.
all right. Here I am.
obviously, you knew I would be.
so, what is it that you want?
shut up!
what do you want? - What do I want?
to shoot the frickin' messenger!
you all right? - Yeah.
Oh, man.
sounds like the cavalry's here.
too bad they won't be able to stop me from killing you.
now, why would you want to do something like that?
Oh, please. Don't tell me you already forgot about my brother.
your brother?
it was a robbery gone bad.
he offed a bartender, and then he...offed himself in prison because he couldn't live with what he did.
and you know why?!'Cause he couldn't live with life's two most important lessons.
what are those?
what? Guilt...is a useless emotion.
yeah? Okay. Yeah, what else?
ignorance is bliss, my friend.
something that you pretty much screwed all to hell for me.
how is that, man? How is that?
my brother...
was all I had, okay?
I mean, man, he was the closest thing that I had to a hero!
and you know what?
you know what? Thinking he was innocent, going after all those... people that put him away
it felt good!
it felt sexy!
and then you and all your friends at the Science Club had to go and ruin it for me.
that's right.
you hear me, Messer?
huh?
look, I told you then, and I will tell you again:
your brother is a murderer, just like you.
that's right! And you put me away, just like him!
guess what? I wasn't like Ian.
I can live with what I've done!
the only thing I can't live with is knowing that your smug ass was out here pretending to be a good guy.
all right. And that's why you escaped from prison?
I went through a lot...
a lot...
...to shut you up.
do what you gotta do, you sick son of a bitch! Do it!
now!
sick bastard!
hold on to me.
don't worry, Messer.
I will.
have they found his body yet?
the Coast Guard's sweeping the area as we speak, but they don't hold out much hope.
the tide was high, and that point's pretty treacherous.
drift patterns could carry his body anywhere from Fire Island to Jersey Shore.
Yeah, well, whatever it takes to finish up Shane Casey once and for all.
Yeah, you got that right. You talk to Lindsay?
Yeah. They were too worked-up to stay.
figured they'd catch a train back into the city and sleep the rest of the week off in the confines of their apartment.
that's not the vacation they had in mind.
no, but at least they have each other.
home, sweet home. - Yeah.
she go down all right?
Yup.
she definitely needed a nap.
she's not the only one.
I take it all back.
what's that?
everything I said about our apartment.
I don't ever want to leave here again.
it's fine with me.
that's what pizza delivery's for.
I'm not sure how much longer we can keep doing this.
I'm tired of feeling like I've lost you.
I'm right here.
I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere.
you promise?
I promise.
here I come, baby. Here I come.
hello.
Oh, my God.
not bad, not bad.
for my sixth birthday, my old man got me a pair of tube socks.
you scared the hell out of me.
what are you doing here? The party doesn't start for another hour.
no, no, no!
Maria, call the cops.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Gino!
No! Gino!
shooter's in a clown outfit. He went in the alley.
we'll take the suspect. Hey, stop!
Where's the victim? In here, in the back, on the floor.
Freeze! NYPD!
don't move! Freeze!
put your hands on your head!
hands on your head! I didn't do anything.
get down on the ground! Down on the ground!
on your knees! Now all the way down! I didn't do anything!
you got a weapon on you? No!
get your hands on your head! You got him?
I pat you down, I'm going to find a weapon?
no. You got the gun on you?
Frank. I got nothing.
what the hell? Frank.
Frank! What?!
Frank, what the hell is going on?
all right, buddy, you can take a seat. Thank you.
don't say anything.
it's just better if you don't say anything.
the victim's inside? The owner.
Gino Cressida. It's his son's sixth birthday.
witnesses say a clown just walked in and wasted him.
and when you showed up, the arresting officers had these guys detained?
Yeah. Now, some of these costumes are way off, but more than half of them match the description witnesses gave of the shooter they saw walk across the street and disappear down the alley.
so one of these clowns might actually be our killer.
if you squirt me with that thing, I will shoot you, right here in front of everybody, you understand me? All right.
talk. Look, it was posted online.
it said show up at the corner of Sullivan and Davis at exactly 11: 00 wearing a clown outfit, you get 500 bucks.
500 bucks? Yeah.
just show up and stand on the corner?
Nah, it said something about distributing flyers.
witnesses tell me you look exactly like the clown who walked into the bakery.
that's 'cause the ad had a photo attached to it.
said there was an extra 50 in it if you came looking exactly like it.
don't go anywhere; I'm not done with you.
Hey, look, is there some kind of stipend here for cooperating?
I mean, this outfit put me back a hundred.
sit down.
Hi, Flack.
who shoots the owner of a bakery?
I mean, really!
and at his kid's birthday party?
single gunshot wound to the chest.
shooter dropped the gun, walked out the front door.
we're looking into phone records.
one of my guys found these in a Dumpster five blocks from here.
looks like we're rounding up clowns out there for no good reason.
got to hand it to this guy-- putting out that ad so he could blend in with the clowns?
pretty smart.
what's our first move? Leave the cannolis and take the gun.
the bullet shattered into multiple fragments, so once Sid extracts them,
I'm gonna have to reconstruct the bullet and then run it through IBIS.
if it's that badly damaged, we may not be able to get reliable stria to make a comparison. Yeah.
I'll do my best, but it's definitely gonna take a little time.
you download the CT data of the wound path?
Yeah.
then there's a faster way.
TAYLOR: Wound tracks don't match up.
so that's not our murder weapon.
I don't get it-- whose gun is it, and why was it at the scene?
well, it's possible the shooter used a different gun, then dropped this one to put us off his track.
Mm. So, I'm still gonna need to extract the fragments and reconstruct the bullet.
that's a lot of fragments. I imagine it is.
so, what do you say, you gonna skip lunch, help me out?
Nope. I get to be the boss this week.
I'm on it.
so, our clown's shoes were covered in dust.
TAYLOR: They were found in a Dumpster.
Yeah, but this was a very particular mixture of dust.
contained a significant amount of carbon and flecks of bone.
I extracted DNA; it came back human, female.
hmm. Looks consistent with talc or ash.
it also contained concrete.
so, what do we have, a burned body that was also buried?
run DNA through CODIS Missing Persons, see if there's a connection. All right.
you know what, one more thing
do you wear sneakers inside clown shoes?
are you seriously asking me that question?
what, no good? What the hell do I know about clowns?
look, I'm a bright man, Danny, but I'm afraid I can't help you with that one.
Hey. Jo, do you wear sneakers inside clown shoes?
I don't know-- I don't own any.
clown shoes? Sneakers.
Danny, get out of here. Get me some answers.
this case is getting stranger by the second.
trace I found on our victim's shirt: cyanide.
our killer clown tried to poison the vic before he shot him?
virtually nothing's adding up so far.
HAWKES: Clown, bakery owner, mystery gun at the crime scene, cyanide...
and Danny just found female DNA.
Hawkes, do you wear sneakers inside clown shoes?
don't you start.
how do you know I'm calling from the crime lab?
I-I... Do you not have caller I. D. sir?
o... Okay, well, listen, perhaps my...
fine. You got me, okay?
I work at the New York City Crime Lab, but I moonlight as a criminal specializing in clown identity theft.
and my next caper, okay, is gonna be to defraud the entire clown industry as Jumbles the Clown.
Hello?
you hung up on me. You... youhung up on me.
I hate clowns. He hung up on me.
I see that. Yeah.
who exactly hung up on you? The New York Clown Registry.
all right. Start from the beginning.
okay.
the vic's phone records could not tell me who he hired as a clown for the kid's birthday party.
okay? So I went online, to the ad the killer posted and I scanned the photo, ran an image search, and I came up empty. However,
I discovered that there's a New York Clown Registry.
like, they register their faces, actually. It's a trademark thing.
so we match the makeup to the registered face, and we get an I. D. Yeah.
okay. But Anal McGillicuddy, he will not give me this guy's information until I get a subpoena, okay?
so now I got to do all this... Adam. Adam.
Yeah. Relax. Relax.
okay. I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.
lay off the caffeine.
I want to meet the guy who blows the yolk out of these things.
I wonder what he does on the weekend.
do you not appreciate the attention to detail associated with this kind of craftsmanship?
Yep.
there's a hole.
they put one at each end and then they just suck the yolk right out of those things.
mama and Aunt Evelyn had it down to a science.
they would just paint the most glorious eggs.
they were beautiful.
okay. How cute is he? Look at that hair.
this is our guy.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just trying to see what...
each individual egg is meticulously hand-painted to match the likeness of our members.
a very time-consuming process.
a process best left undisturbed, particularly by the oils on your fingertips.
you don't walk into the MoMA and poke the Picassos, do you?
anal McGillicuddy.
I beg your pardon?
I believe you talked to one of my employees.
detective Mac Taylor. New York Crime Lab.
Oh, yes. Wonderful.
I see you have all the charm of your subordinate.
and I see you have... Okay.
I think we have gotten off on the wrong foot here.
can we start over?
I am Detective Danville.
we're looking for... Save it, Kentucky.
Adam Ross faxed over the subpoena five minutes ago.
I suppose he anticipated your lack of persuasive skills.
you're not very nice for someone who works at a clown registry.
not all clowns are happy.
the name and the address of the man that you're looking for are in here.
kindly show yourselves out when you're done.
Stan Ridgeway. 1023 Sutton Avenue.
the last time we did this, didn't really work out for us.
he's a clown, Flack. He registered his face.
I'm just saying, the last time we were in this position, six bullets came through the door.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't keep his balloon gun loaded.
why are you standing off to the side, then?
I'm a little scared.
Stan Ridgeway? NYPD!
you okay?
RIDGEWAY: Oh, God. You tell me.
head's pounding like he split it open with a cannon.
it's nothing that a Band-Aid and a beer won't fix.
did you get a good look at the guy? Uh, yeah.
uh, dark hair, dark eyes, clean-shaven.
uh, jeans and a-a blue shirt.
that's kind of generic, Stan.
anything about him stick out?
Yeah, the barrel of his gun.
he had it pointed right between my eyes.
that door jamb looks pretty solid. So how did he get in?
look, I opened the door, okay? He said he had a delivery.
he needed a signature.
I got a delivery. Somebody's got to sign.
RIDGEWAY: Oh, my God. What the hell?
turn around. Down on your knees. Okay. Okay. Okay.
don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot me! Shut up!
son of a bitch even asked me how much money I was gonna make today.
200 bucks or so. 250 with tip?
just please don't kill me.
please. No.
no. No. No! No!
when I came to, he was gone, and so was my clown suit.
look, he took my hair and my nose, too.
I need those back.
okay? They were specially made.
they're very expensive.
one of a kind.
all right. We'll see what we can do.
in the meantime, let's get you some ice.
lunchtime.
that was fast.
mama, I'm not interested.
because the last time you set me up on a blind date,
I had to handcuff the guy within 20 minutes.
I do not have control issues. Jo!
mama, I'm at work. I have to call you back later.
Bye.
I got a hit in AFIS on the prints that Danny lifted from the makeup.
I think I found our killer clown.
Oh, I keep telling Mac he needs to give you a raise, and he won't listen to me.
Renton's only arrest was a fare beat eight years ago?
doesn't quite fit the profile of a cold-blooded killer.
according to the officer's report,
Renton lost his wallet, had no money, jumped the turnstile at the subway station, got arrested, and his prints have just been on file ever since. And that's it?
no burglary, no assault?
not even a public disturbance, and he get up this morning, dresses like a clown and kills a man?
Gino Cressida's murder was premeditated.
you don't just wake up one morning and plan all that.
you're sure about the match on AFIS?
Yeah. 15 points of comparison.
definitely Renton's print. There was something else that was odd.
okay, he hasn't had a license in five years.
don't need one in New York City.
okay, but at the same time, he got rid of his credit card, moved from his only known address in Queens, quit his job, and doesn't exist in any database where you could find anything on anybody.
so I did a quick date check.
it's like he started to disappear from his own life all in the same day.
all in the same day?
all in the same day.
it's a possibility.
thank you, Adam.
did they contact you? "They"?
the FBI.
we're expecting a call?
well, they usually get their panties in a wad when we start getting in their business.
and we've done that?
well, AFIS got us the match off of the print that Danny recovered from Stan Ridgeway's makeup.
the name is Bobby Renton.
he's gonna be tough to track down, 'cause Bobby hasn't existed for the past five years.
well, if he was in jail, there'd be a record of it.
if he was dead, there'd be documentation.
but there's been no report that he's missing.
so you think he's part of the FBI's witness protection program.
exactly.
cause I... know the FBI.
and I also know this overconfident agent who just got off the elevator. He's right over there.
overconfident? What, you worked together?
slept together.
my ex-husband.
you're leaving?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure you're aware, Detective, that our system alerts the FBI to any inquiries made about our protected cooperatives.
your lab's AFIS hit was flagged.
so you want to tell me what your interest in Bobby Renton is?
we're looking for him.
well, he's a protected witness in a secure location outside of the state of New York.
agent Josephson, we believe he's back in New York.
in fact, he's in Manhattan, and he's a prime suspect in a murder investigation.
you seem pretty sure about that. We connected his prints to the crime.
well, maybe you want to run those prints a second time, Detective. Double check.
you think we got this wrong?
murder is definitely not in Bobby Renton's wheelhouse.
so, yeah, I think you got the wrong guy.
I imagine it'd be embarrassing for the Bureau to find out a witness wasn't where he was supposed to be, living unprotected, or worse, involved in a crime the NYPD knows more about than the FBI.
trust me, this is not about the Bureau's ego.
in fact, his protection was a request from the NYPD.
he's an informant for you guys, not us.
this was a favor for Detective Don Flack.
Bobby Renton? You sure about that?
Danny recovered his print from Stan Ridgeway's apartment.
so that puts him in Stan's place, but it doesn't make him a killer.
he took Ridgeway's clothes, Don, dressed as a clown and killed Gino Cressida. Let's bring Stan in.
see if he can pick Bobby out of a six-pack.
I'm missing something here.
you, the FBI-- nobody buys this guy as a killer, but the evidence points right at him.
Bobby was a good guy, Mac.
he wasn't some thug who flipped to try to make a deal and get a government-paid ticket out of Queens.
he testified against three PCP dealers who put a bullet in his friend's head.
he was a decent guy. Did the right thing.
and now you're telling me he's back and he's a killer?
that's the way it looks, Don.
these guys are gonna come after me, you know that.
we'll protect you.
how? I got friends in the FBI.
they'll set you up. Witness protection?
no, man, I'm not gonna get involved in all that.
I told you who did it. That's all you need.
no, no, no. We need a witness, Bobby.
that's you.
what about Ainsley? We'll protect her, too.
drug dealers like the Foleys don't stop unless they're made to stop.
you saw them walk him out of the bar that night.
they killed your friend, and they're laughing about it.
don't let them get away with that.
I don't know. I just don't know.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
I got to go.
listen, Bobby... I got to go.
I saw you run out.
I had work to do.
you've been avoiding my phone calls.
I've been busy, Russ.
and we've exchanged at least five text messages over the last eight months.
I think that's plenty.
Jo, do you realize this is the first time
I've seen you since you moved to New York?
that's not true. I saw you at Tyler's.
Yeah, you saw me, and I saw the back of your head as you left the room.
what? You look great.
what was the reason we separated? Divorced.
because you wanted me to be a housewife, and I wanted a career.
we're completely incompatible.
you know what? My first clue should have been you insisted I take your last name.
Jo Josephson. Please.
I just wanted the guys to know you were mine.
another problem-- ownership issues.
if I say you're right and I'm sorry, will you have dinner with me?
no.
you didn't have to come all the way over here to deliver that message to Mac.
you could have just called. But then I wouldn't get to see you.
Jo, the bullet fragments are a match...
sorry. I'll come back. No, no, no.
we're all good. He's an FBI agent.
Lindsay, ex-husband. Ex-husband, Lindsay.
nice to meet you.
you, too. We've heard nothing... about you.
bullet fragments. Uh, yeah.
uh, 3-D software reassembled the bullet fragments that we pulled from Gino Cressida.
I was able to...
realign the striae.
I got a match to a bullet that was pulled from a man killed two days ago in Memphis.
so the same gun was used to kill both men.
and possibly the same shooter.
Bobby Renton was in witness protection in Memphis.
crime scene photos of Elmo Vidivic and the preliminary autopsy report from Memphis PD indicate three gunshot wounds.
one to each knee, and one to the chest.
the latter being the cause of death.
laceration, multiple bruising to the face.
Vidivic was tortured.
who sent you here to kill me? Nobody sent me.
try again.
you didn't come to Memphis to sightsee.
okay. All right.
it was Gino Cressida.
Renton was clearly looking for the name of the man who arranged the hit.
RUSS: Gino Cressida. Does that make sense to anyone?
why would a baker who makes the best cannoli in New York want to kill Bobby Renton?
RUSS: There's no intel on Cressida in our files, no apparent connection to this case or the suspects Bobby Renton testified against five years ago.
Cressida's background's clean. Husband, father.
owns the family bakery which he inherited from his mother.
HAWKES: Maybe Bobby Renton got the name wrong, or Vidivic gave him any name he could think of.
TAYLOR: You don't kill two men the way Renton did without being sure.
I still can't believe he did it. Yeah.
Russ, was Bobby cooperating on any other cases that were still going to trial?
not with us.
he disappeared into witness protection.
that was the last the NYPD heard of him. Yeah.
well, somebody wanted Renton dead.
his identity and location were compromised, and a professional was sent all the way to Memphis to take care of him.
we're missing a connection here.
we got every resource the commissioner would authorize looking for Bobby Renton. No sign of him.
so he's fled the city. Only if he's walking.
we got eyes on the piers, the bus terminals, the airports, train stations.
not to mention checkpoints on every major road out of the city.
if taking out Gino Cressida was the reason he returned to New York, then Bobby's done the job he came to do.
why is he still here?
cause he still has unfinished business.
so what happens now? Do I get to pick my new name?
choose where I'm gonna live? When do I stop being me?
day after tomorrow.
the FBI will put you up in a safe house until then.
you can't go home.
I'll swing by and grab some of your stuff and bring Ainsley to wherever you're...
you didn't tell her? What for?
that's your girl, man.
come on. You got to tell her.
Why? So I can ruin her life, too?
make her move away from her family and friends?
she's five months pregnant, Flack.
I can't do that.
I chose to do this, not her.
so you're not even gonna say good-bye?
it's easier this way.
no.
if they come after me, then so be it.
but if she came, and they hurt her and my kid?
I couldn't live with that.
I know your head is probably spinning, but believe me, you did the right thing.
can you do me a favor?
tell Ainsley I...
never mind. Let's... Let's get out of here.
HAWKES: Hey, Mac, just received the tox report on our victim in Memphis.
traces of ether were found in Elmo Vidivic's lungs.
now, at our crime scene here in New York,
I found cyanide on Gino Cressida's clothing.
cyanide and ether. That's PCP.
Yeah, it could prove that they knew each other, were together or something.
now, Renton testified against the Foley brothers. They dealt PCP, right?
well, that's a leap, Sheldon.
there are a lot of uses for cyanide and ether, and we have no definitive proof that either one of these men were in the same place at the same time prior to their deaths.
thought you might say that.
which means you came here with an answer?
I ran a utility usage check on Gino Cressida's bakery.
wattage was off the charts.
compared to similar structures in the area, their kilowatt hours show 50 times more usage.
mac, I know it's a bakery, but they ain't baking that many bagels.
Cressida's is a front for a PCP lab.
Cressida was supplying the Foley brothers.
I was hoping you'd walk me out.
leaving so soon?
Yeah, the FBI's work is done here.
we have no jurisdiction over the murder investigation.
leaving the hard part to the NYPD?
and I thought our separation was amicable.
divorce.
Hey, Mac seems like a nice guy.
he is.
any reason I should be jealous?
Oh, baby, I love that.
we're gonna hang it on the fridge right when we get home.
waitress: More coffee?
thank you. Sure.
what can I get you?
has Bobby gotten in touch with you?
we have a special on the pastrami.
we're all out of apple pie. And I highly recommend the fish and chips.
Oh, come on, Ainsley. Don't play games with me.
he's in trouble.
do you want something to eat or no?
what kind of trouble?
have you seen him?
no. If you have, you got to tell me.
I said, no. Manny, I'm on break!
Yeah, go ahead.
so, Bobby's back in New York?
looks that way.
he okay?
no.
he's not hurt.
he's just done something stupid.
really stupid.
look, he may come to see you.
if he does, please call me?
you got a lot of nerve, you know that?
listen to me. Listen to you?
what, are you kidding me?
listen to you. That's what got us in this mess in the first place.
you convincing Bobby to snitch on those guys.
he trusted you. We both did.
I am never gonna be that stupid again.
take your card. I'm not helping you.
and you know what? If Bobby does call me, you will be the absolute last person I tell.
he left to protect you.
Yeah, well, you got what you wanted.
so what's it matter, huh? I'm sorry.
baby, I'll be right over by the counter if you need me.
order's up. Chicken and waffles.
I knew there had to be a deeper connection.
what do you got? Connection between who?
Gino Cressida and the Foley brothers.
he was supplying them with PCP, right? Clearly looks that way.
but to hire a hit man to hunt down Bobby Renton, there had to be a more personal connection.
Gino Cressida is the godfather of one of the Foley brothers.
that's more than enough motive.
so somebody must have spotted Bobby in Memphis.
Cressida got word and sent Vidivic to kill him.
revenge for his godson's conviction.
looks that way.
either of you hear from Flack since this afternoon? No. No.
I've left a few messages. This case is personal for him.
that's what I'm afraid of.
Yes, yes, yes! EDNA, I love you.
is there another woman in your life?
this is the magnification of the dust collected from the clown's clothes and Stan's apartment.
and on the other side is a match from EDNA.
I had female bone, ash and concrete, and I couldn't put it all together.
until EDNA came to your rescue.
don't be jealous. I was thinking we were looking at the remains of a burned body, another one of Renton's victims, but the degree of thermal destruction was so great that it would take a significant amount of heat.
high heat, bone, ash-- cremation.
Yeah, exactly.
I thought you said there were traces of concrete.
there used to be a crematorium that offers a burial at sea, okay?
they mix your remains with concrete and lower them into the ocean to promote coral reef growth.
okay, so how did the ash and the concrete transfer to Renton?
he must have picked up the ash in the abandoned crematorium...
...and transferred it to the clown suit.
the crematorium was in Brooklyn.
it's been closed for six years.
it's got to be where Renton's hiding out.
we need to let Mac know, and send units.
it's Flack. I'm here.
Bobby, come on. I got your signal.
you brought me all the way out here.
glad you could make it, Don.
put the gun down, Bobby.
I'm already facing life in prison, man.
killing a cop?
what's that, double life?
Hey, back up, man.
back up.
you don't want to do this, Bobby.
Yeah, I didn't want to testify, either-- you remember that?
what was it you said?
Oh, "Be a hero, Bobby.
do the right thing." What did that get me, huh?
you made promises you couldn't keep, Flack.
come on, lower the gun.
take another step, man, I'll kill you.
you know the worst part, Flack?
what's that?
28 years I lived in that neighborhood and I managed to stay out of trouble.
one conversation with you, and I get shipped off to Memphis.
can't even get a decent slice of pizza. You saved lives, Bobby.
you know that. But I lost mine!
it wasn't worth it, man.
every day looking over my shoulder, wondering when they'd come.
and they did; they did come.
so I had to end it.
I've never even laid eyes on my own son.
protection? No, this might as well have been jail.
this is what happens when you do what's right?
Yeah.
thieves get rich.
saints get shot.
and God doesn't always answer your prayers.
so instead of thinking about what's owed you...
think about your little boy.
think about Ainsley.
you can still have a life, Bobby.
you shot a hit man and the guy who sent him after you.
there's a real chance you could still get out of jail and be a father to your son.
if you pull that trigger...
that does not happen.
don't do this.
Bobby, stop! Come on!
it's over, Bobby.
you were MIA for a while there.
Yeah. I needed a little time to wrestle with the demons.
you okay?
five years ago when Bobby flipped on those guys,
I got a big pat on the back, felt really good.
it does not feel really good right now.
well, it's tough asking a witness to testify, and especially in a case like that.
but we do more than ask.
we're taught to persuade, right?
get the bad guy off the street, close the case.
you get caught up in that, and it's easy to lose sight of the sacrifices that some people have to make.
it's a necessary evil, Don.
without witnesses being brave enough to testify, where would we be?
and for what it's worth, you didn't talk Renton into testifying
deep down... he knew what he had to do.
listen, I'm gonna take him over to Central Booking myself.
sure.
thank you.
I got him, guys.
Thanks. Let's go.
what do I do now?
go ahead.
ten minutes.
not bad, not bad.
for my sixth birthday, my old man got me a pair of tube socks.
you scared the hell out of me.
what are you doing here?
the party doesn't start for another hour.
no, no, no!
Maria, call the cops.
shooter's in a clown outfit. He went in the alley.
we'll take the suspect.
Hey, stop!
Where's the victim? - In here, in the back, on the floor.
Freeze! NYPD!
don't move! Freeze!
put your hands on your head!
hands on your head! - I didn't do anything.
get down on the ground!
down on the ground! On your knees! Now all the way down!
I didn't do anything!
you got a weapon on you? - No!
get your hands on your head!
you got him?
I pat you down, I'm going to find a weapon? - No.
you got the gun on you?
Frank. - I got nothing.
what the hell?
Frank! - What?!
Frank, what the hell is going on?
all right, buddy, you can take a seat.
thank you.
don't say anything.
it's just better if you don't say anything.
the victim's inside?
the owner. Gino Cressida.
it's his son's sixth birthday.
witnesses say a clown just walked in and wasted him.
and when you showed up, the arresting officers had these guys detained?
Yeah.
now, some of these costumes are way off, but more than half of them match the description witnesses gave of the shooter they saw walk across the street and disappear down the alley.
so one of these clowns might actually be our killer.
if you squirt me with that thing, I will shoot you, right here in front of everybody, you understand me?
all right.
talk.
look, it was posted online.
it said show up at the corner of Sullivan and Davis at exactly 11: 00 wearing a clown outfit, you get 500 bucks.
500 bucks? - Yeah.
just show up and stand on the corner?
Nah, it said something about distributing flyers.
witnesses tell me you look exactly like the clown who walked into the bakery.
that's 'cause the ad had a photo attached to it.
said there was an extra 50 in it if you came looking exactly like it.
don't go anywhere; I'm not done with you.
Hey, look, is there some kind of stipend here for cooperating?
I mean, this outfit put me back a hundred.
sit down.
Hi, Flack.
who shoots the owner of a bakery? I mean, really!
and at his kid's birthday party?
single gunshot wound to the chest.
shooter dropped the gun, walked out the front door.
sounds like a hit.
did we get the name of the clown he hired for the party?
wife said the vic took care of it. We're looking into phone records.
one of my guys found these in a Dumpster five blocks from here.
looks like we're rounding up clowns out there for no good reason.
got to hand it to this guy - putting out that ad so he could blend in with the clowns?
pretty smart.
what's our first move?
leave the cannolis and take the gun.
the bullet shattered into multiple fragments, so once Sid extracts them, I'm gonna have to reconstruct the bullet and then run it through IBIS.
if it's that badly damaged, we may not be able to get reliable stria to make a comparison.
Yeah. I'll do my best, but it's definitely gonna take a little time.
you download the CT data of the wound path?
Yeah.
then there's a faster way.
wound tracks don't match up.
so that's not our murder weapon.
I don't get it - whose gun is it, and why was it at the scene?
well, it's possible the shooter used a different gun, then dropped this one to put us off his track.
so, I'm still gonna need to extract the fragments and reconstruct the bullet.
that's a lot of fragments.
I imagine it is.
so, what do you say, you gonna skip lunch, help me out?
Nope. I get to be the boss this week.
I'm on it.
Hey, Mac.
so, our clown's shoes were covered in dust.
they were found in a Dumpster.
Yeah, but this was a very particular mixture of dust.
contained a significant amount of carbon and flecks of bone.
I extracted DNA; it came back human, female.
looks consistent with talc or ash.
it also contained concrete.
so, what do we have, a burned body that was also buried?
run DNA through CODIS Missing Persons, see if there's a connection.
all right.
you know what, one more thing - do you wear sneakers inside clown shoes?
are you seriously asking me that question?
what, no good? What the hell do I know about clowns?
look, I'm a bright man, Danny, but I'm afraid I can't help you with that one.
Jo, do you wear sneakers inside clown shoes?
I don't know - I don't own any.
clown shoes? - Sneakers.
Danny, get out of here. Get me some answers.
this case is getting stranger by the second.
trace I found on our victim's shirt: cyanide.
our killer clown tried to poison the vic before he shot him?
virtually nothing's adding up so far.
clown, bakery owner, mystery gun at the crime scene, cyanide...
and Danny just found female DNA.
Hawkes, do you wear sneakers inside clown shoes?
don't you start.
how do you know I'm calling from the crime lab?
I- I...Do you not have caller I. D. sir?
o... Okay, well, listen, perhaps my...
fine. You got me, okay?
I work at the New York City Crime Lab, but I moonlight as a criminal specializing in clown identity theft.
and my next caper, okay, is gonna be to defraud the entire clown industry as Jumbles the Clown.
Hello?
you hung up on me. You... you hung up on me.
I hate clowns.
he hung up on me.
I see that. - Yeah.
who exactly hung up on you?
the New York Clown Registry.
all right. Start from the beginning.
okay.
the victim's phone records could not tell me who he hired as a clown for the kid's birthday party. Okay?
so I went online, to the ad the killer posted and I scanned the photo, ran an image search, and I came up empty.
however, I discovered that there's a New York Clown Registry.
like, they register their faces, actually.
it's a trademark thing.
so we match the makeup to the registered face, and we get an I. D.
Yeah. Okay.
but Anal McGillicuddy, he will not give me this guy's information until I get a subpoena, okay?
so now I got to do all this...
Adam. Adam. - Yeah.
relax. Relax.
okay. I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.
lay off the caffeine.
I want to meet the guy who blows the yolk out of these things.
I wonder what he does on the weekend.
do you not appreciate the attention to detail associated with this kind of craftsmanship?
Yep. There's a hole.
they put one at each end and then they just suck the yolk right out of those things.
mama and Aunt Evelyn had it down to a science.
they would just paint the most glorious eggs. They were beautiful.
okay. How cute is he? Look at that hair.
this is our guy.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just trying to see what...
each individual egg is meticulously hand-painted to match the likeness of our members.
a very time-consuming process.
a process best left undisturbed, particularly by the oils on your fingertips.
you don't walk into the MoMA and poke the Picassos, do you?
I beg your pardon?
I believe you talked to one of my employees.
detective Mac Taylor. New York Crime Lab.
Oh, yes. Wonderful.
I see you have all the charm of your subordinate.
and I see you have...
okay. I think we have gotten off on the wrong foot here.
can we start over?
I am Detective Danville. We're looking for...
save it, Kentucky.
Adam Ross faxed over the subpoena five minutes ago.
I suppose he anticipated your lack of persuasive skills.
you're not very nice for someone who works at a clown registry.
not all clowns are happy.
the name and the address of the man that you're looking for are in here.
kindly show yourselves out when you're done.
Stan Ridgeway. 1023 Sutton Avenue.
the last time we did this, didn't really work out for us.
he's a clown, Flack. He registered his face.
I'm just saying, the last time we were in this position, six bullets came through the door.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't keep his balloon gun loaded.
why are you standing off to the side, then?
I'm a little scared.
Stan Ridgeway? NYPD!
you okay? - Oh, God. You tell me.
head's pounding like he split it open with a cannon.
it's nothing that a Band-Aid and a beer won't fix.
did you get a good look at the guy?
uh, yeah. Uh, dark hair, dark eyes, clean-shaven. Uh, jeans and a-a blue shirt.
that's kind of generic, Stan. Anything about him stick out?
Yeah, the barrel of his gun. He had it pointed right between my eyes.
that door jamb looks pretty solid. So how did he get in?
look, I opened the door, okay?
he said he had a delivery. He needed a signature.
I got a delivery. Somebody's got to sign.
Oh, my God. What the hell?
turn around. Down on your knees.
okay. Okay. Okay. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
don't shoot me! - Shut up!
son of a bitch even asked me how much money I was gonna make today.
200 bucks or so. 250 with tip?
just please don't kill me.
please.
no. No. No. No! No!
when I came to, he was gone, and so was my clown suit.
look, he took my hair and my nose, too. I need those back. Okay?
they were specially made. They're very expensive. One of a kind.
all right. We'll see what we can do.
in the meantime, let's get you some ice.
lunchtime.
that was fast.
mama, I'm not interested.
because the last time you set me up on a blind date, I had to handcuff the guy within 20 minutes.
I do not have control issues.
mama, I'm at work. I have to call you back later.
Bye.
I got a hit in AFIS on the prints that Danny lifted from the makeup.
I think I found our killer clown. Bobby Renton.
Oh, I keep telling Mac he needs to give you a raise, and he won't listen to me.
Renton's only arrest was a fare beat eight years ago?
doesn't quite fit the profile of a cold-blooded killer.
according to the officer's report, Renton lost his wallet, had no money, jumped the turnstile at the subway station, got arrested, and his prints have just been on file ever since.
and that's it? No burglary, no assault?
not even a public disturbance, and he get up this morning, dresses like a clown and kills a man?
Gino Cressida's murder was premeditated.
you don't just wake up one morning and plan all that.
you're sure about the match on AFIS?
Yeah. 15 points of comparison.
definitely Renton's print.
there was something else that was odd. Okay, he hasn't had a license in five years.
don't need one in New York City.
okay, but at the same time, he got rid of his credit card, moved from his only known address in Queens, quit his job, and doesn't exist in any database where you could find anything on anybody.
so I did a quick date check.
it's like he started to disappear from his own life all in the same day.
all in the same day?
all in the same day. It's a possibility.
thank you, Adam.
did they contact you?
they? - The FBI.
we're expecting a call?
well, they usually get their panties in a wad when we start getting in their business.
and we've done that?
well, AFIS got us the match off of the print that Danny recovered from Stan Ridgeway's makeup.
the name is Bobby Renton.
he's gonna be tough to track down,'cause Bobby hasn't existed for the past five years.
well, if he was in jail, there'd be a record of it.
if he was dead, there'd be documentation.
but there's been no report that he's missing.
so you think he's part of the FBI's witness protection program.
exactly. 'Cause I...know the FBI.
and I also know this overconfident agent who just got off the elevator.
overconfident? What, you worked together?
slept together.
my ex-husband.
you're leaving? - Oh, yeah.
I'm sure you're aware, Detective, that our system alerts the FBI to any inquiries made about our protected cooperatives.
your lab's AFIS hit was flagged.
so you want to tell me what your interest in Bobby Renton is?
we're looking for him.
well, he's a protected witness in a secure location outside of the state of New York.
agent Josephson, we believe he's back in New York.
in fact, he's in Manhattan, and he's a prime suspect in a murder investigation.
you seem pretty sure about that.
we connected his prints to the crime.
well, maybe you want to run those prints a second time, Detective.
double check.
you think we got this wrong?
murder is definitely not in Bobby Renton's wheelhouse.
so, yeah, I think you got the wrong guy.
I imagine it'd be embarrassing for the Bureau to find out a witness wasn't where he was supposed to be, living unprotected, or worse, involved in a crime the NYPD knows more about than the FBI.
trust me, this is not about the Bureau's ego.
in fact, his protection was a request from the NYPD.
he's an informant for you guys, not us.
this was a favor for Detective Don Flack.
you sure about that?
Danny recovered his print from Stan Ridgeway's apartment.
so that puts him in Stan's place, but it doesn't make him a killer.
he took Ridgeway's clothes, Don, dressed as a clown and killed Gino Cressida.
let's bring Stan in.
see if he can pick Bobby out of a six-pack.
I'm missing something here.
you, the FBI- nobody buys this guy as a killer, but the evidence points right at him.
Bobby was a good guy, Mac.
he wasn't some thug who flipped to try to make a deal and get a government-paid ticket out of Queens.
he testified against three PCP dealers who put a bullet in his friend's head.
he was a decent guy. Did the right thing.
and now you're telling me he's back and he's a killer?
that's the way it looks, Don.
these guys are gonna come after me, you know that.
we'll protect you. - How?
I got friends in the FBI. They'll set you up.
witness protection?
no, man, I'm not gonna get involved in all that.
I told you who did it. That's all you need.
no, no, no. We need a witness, Bobby.
that's you.
what about Ainsley? - We'll protect her, too.
Bobby, drug dealers like the Foleys don't stop unless they're made to stop.
you saw them walk him out of the bar that night.
they killed your friend, and they're laughing about it.
don't let them get away with that.
I don't know. I just don't know.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
I got to go. - Listen, Bobby...
I got to go. - Bobby!
I saw you run out.
I had work to do.
you've been avoiding my phone calls.
I've been busy, Russ.
and we've exchanged at least five text messages over the last eight months.
I think that's plenty.
Jo, do you realize this is the first time I've seen you since you moved to New York?
that's not true. I saw you at Tyler's.
Yeah, you saw me, and I saw the back of your head as you left the room.
what?
you look great.
what was the reason we separated? - Divorced.
because you wanted me to be a housewife, and I wanted a career.
we're completely incompatible.
you know what? My first clue should have been you insisted I take your last name.
I just wanted the guys to know you were mine.
another problem - ownership issues.
if I say you're right and I'm sorry, will you have dinner with me?
no.
you didn't have to come all the way over here to deliver that message to Mac.
you could have just called.
but then I wouldn't get to see you.
Jo, the bullet fragments are a match...
sorry. I'll come back.
no, no, no. We're all good.
he's an FBI agent.
Lindsay, ex-husband. Ex-husband, Lindsay.
nice to meet you. - You, too.
we've heard nothing...about you.
bullet fragments.
uh, yeah. Uh, 3-D software reassembled the bullet fragments that we pulled from Gino Cressida.
I was able to...realign the striae.
I got a match to a bullet that was pulled from a man killed two days ago in Memphis.
so the same gun was used to kill both men.
and possibly the same shooter.
Bobby Renton was in witness protection in Memphis.
crime scene photos of Elmo Vidivic and the preliminary autopsy report from Memphis PD indicate three gunshot wounds.
one to each knee, and one to the chest.
the latter being the cause of death.
laceration, multiple bruising to the face.
Vidivic was tortured.
who sent you here to kill me?
nobody sent me.
try again.
you didn't come to Memphis to sightsee.
all right. It was Gino Cressida.
Renton was clearly looking for the name of the man who arranged the hit.
does that make sense to anyone?
why would a baker who makes the best cannoli in New York want to kill Bobby Renton?
there's no intel on Cressida in our files, no apparent connection to this case or the suspects Bobby Renton testified against five years ago.
Cressida's background's clean.
husband, father.
owns the family bakery which he inherited from his mother.
maybe Bobby Renton got the name wrong, or Vidivic gave him any name he could think of.
you don't kill two men the way Renton did without being sure.
I still can't believe he did it.
Yeah.
Russ, was Bobby cooperating on any other cases that were still going to trial?
not with us.
he disappeared into witness protection.
that was the last the NYPD heard of him.
well, somebody wanted Renton dead.
his identity and location were compromised, and a professional was sent all the way to Memphis to take care of him.
we're missing a connection here.
we got every resource the commissioner would authorize looking for Bobby Renton.
no sign of him.
so he's fled the city.
only if he's walking.
we got eyes on the piers, the bus terminals, the airports, train stations.
not to mention checkpoints on every major road out of the city.
if taking out Gino Cressida was the reason he returned to New York, then Bobby's done the job he came to do.
why is he still here?
cause he still has unfinished business.
so what happens now?
do I get to pick my new name?
choose where I'm gonna live?
when do I stop being me?
day after tomorrow.
the FBI will put you up in a safe house until then.
you can't go home.
I'll swing by and grab some of your stuff and bring Ainsley to wherever you're...
you didn't tell her?
what for?
that's your girl, man. Come on.
you got to tell her.
Why? So I can ruin her life, too?
make her move away from her family and friends?
she's five months pregnant, Flack.
I can't do that.
I chose to do this, not her.
so you're not even gonna say good-bye?
it's easier this way.
no.
if they come after me, then so be it.
but if she came, and they hurt her and my kid?
I couldn't live with that.
I know your head is probably spinning, but believe me, you did the right thing.
can you do me a favor?
tell Ainsley I...
never mind. Let's... Let's get out of here.
Hey, Mac, just received the tox report on our victim in Memphis.
traces of ether were found in Elmo Vidivic's lungs.
now, at our crime scene here in New York, I found cyanide on Gino Cressida's clothing.
cyanide and ether. That's PCP.
Yeah, it could prove that they knew each other, were together or something.
now, Renton testified against the Foley brothers.
they dealt PCP, right?
well, that's a leap, Sheldon.
there are a lot of uses for cyanide and ether, and we have no definitive proof that either one of these men were in the same place at the same time prior to their deaths.
thought you might say that.
which means you came here with an answer?
I ran a utility usage check on Gino Cressida's bakery.
wattage was off the charts.
compared to similar structures in the area, their kilowatt hours show 50 times more usage.
mac, I know it's a bakery, but they ain't baking that many bagels.
Cressida's is a front for a PCP lab.
Cressida was supplying the Foley brothers.
I was hoping you'd walk me out.
leaving so soon?
Yeah, the FBI's work is done here. We have no jurisdiction over the murder investigation.
leaving the hard part to the NYPD?
and I thought our separation was amicable.
divorce.
Hey, Mac seems like a nice guy.
he is.
any reason I should be jealous?
Oh, baby, I love that.
we're gonna hang it on the fridge right when we get home.
more coffee?
thank you. Sure.
what can I get you?
has Bobby gotten in touch with you?
we have a special on the pastrami. We're all out of apple pie.
and I highly recommend the fish and chips.
Oh, come on, Ainsley. Don't play games with me.
he's in trouble.
do you want something to eat or no?
what kind of trouble?
have you seen him? - No.
if you have, you got to tell me. - I said, no.
Manny, I'm on break!
Yeah, go ahead.
so, Bobby's back in New York?
looks that way.
he okay? - No.
he's not hurt. He's just done something stupid. Really stupid.
look, he may come to see you.
if he does, please call me?
you got a lot of nerve, you know that?
listen to me. - Listen to you?
what, are you kidding me? Listen to you.
that's what got us in this mess in the first place.
you convincing Bobby to snitch on those guys. He trusted you.
we both did.
I am never gonna be that stupid again.
take your card. I'm not helping you.
and you know what? If Bobby does call me, you will be the absolute last person I tell.
he left to protect you.
Yeah, well, you got what you wanted.
so what's it matter, huh?
I'm sorry.
baby, I'll be right over by the counter if you need me.
order's up. Chicken and waffles.
I knew there had to be a deeper connection.
what do you got? Connection between who?
Gino Cressida and the Foley brothers.
he was supplying them with PCP, right?
clearly looks that way.
but to hire a hit man to hunt down Bobby Renton, there had to be a more personal connection.
Gino Cressida is the godfather of one of the Foley brothers.
that's more than enough motive.
so somebody must have spotted Bobby in Memphis.
Cressida got word and sent Vidivic to kill him.
revenge for his godson's conviction.
looks that way.
either of you hear from Flack since this afternoon? - No. No.
I've left a few messages.
this case is personal for him.
that's what I'm afraid of.
Yes, yes, yes! EDNA, I love you.
is there another woman in your life?
this is the magnification of the dust collected from the clown's clothes and Stan's apartment.
and on the other side is a match from EDNA.
I had female bone, ash and concrete, and I couldn't put it all together.
until EDNA came to your rescue.
don't be jealous.
I was thinking we were looking at the remains of a burned body, another one of Renton's victims, but the degree of thermal destruction was so great that it would take a significant amount of heat.
high heat, bone, ash - cremation.
Yeah, exactly.
I thought you said there were traces of concrete.
there used to be a crematorium that offers a burial at sea, okay?
they mix your remains with concrete and lower them into the ocean to promote coral reef growth.
okay, so how did the ash and the concrete transfer to Renton?
he must have picked up the ash in the abandoned crematorium...
and transferred it to the clown suit.
the crematorium was in Brooklyn.
it's been closed for six years.
it's got to be where Renton's hiding out.
we need to let Mac know, and send units.
bobby?! It's Flack.
I'm here.
Bobby, come on. I got your signal.
you brought me all the way out here.
glad you could make it, Don.
put the gun down, Bobby.
I'm already facing life in prison, man.
killing a cop?
what's that, double life?
Hey, back up, man.
back up.
you don't want to do this, Bobby.
Yeah, I didn't want to testify, either - you remember that?
what was it you said?
Oh, " Be a hero, Bobby. Do the right thing."
what did that get me, huh?
you made promises you couldn't keep, Flack.
come on, lower the gun.
take another step, man, I'll kill you.
you know the worst part, Flack?
what's that?
28 years I lived in that neighborhood and I managed to stay out of trouble.
one conversation with you, and I get shipped off to Memphis.
can't even get a decent slice of pizza.
you saved lives, Bobby. You know that.
but I lost mine!
it wasn't worth it, man.
every day looking over my shoulder, wondering when they'd come.
and they did; they did come.
so I had to end it.
I've never even laid eyes on my own son.
protection?
no, this might as well have been jail.
this is what happens when you do what's right?
Yeah.
thieves get rich. Saints get shot.
and God doesn't always answer your prayers.
so instead of thinking about what's owed you...
think about your little boy.
think about Ainsley.
you can still have a life, Bobby.
you shot a hit man and the guy who sent him after you.
there's a real chance you could still get out of jail and be a father to your son.
if you pull that trigger...that does not happen.
don't do this.
Bobby, stop! Come on!
it's over, Bobby.
you were MIA for a while there.
Yeah. I needed a little time to wrestle with the demons.
you okay?
five years ago when Bobby flipped on those guys, I got a big pat on the back, felt really good.
it does not feel really good right now.
well, it's tough asking a witness to testify, and especially in a case like that.
but we do more than ask.
we're taught to persuade, right?
get the bad guy off the street, close the case.
you get caught up in that, and it's easy to lose sight of the sacrifices that some people have to make.
it's a necessary evil, Don.
without witnesses being brave enough to testify, where would we be?
and for what it's worth, you didn't talk Renton into testifying - deep down...
he knew what he had to do.
listen, I'm gonna take him over to Central Booking myself.
sure.
thank you.
I got him, guys. Thanks.
let's go.
what do I do now?
go ahead.
ten minutes.
your, uh, best single malt.
neat, please.
buy you a drink?
sure.
you're beautiful.
hiker found her.
no witnesses, no calls to 911, no missing persons matching her description.
marbling and the level of decomp tells me she's been dead at least 36 hours.
we had one like this on the other side of the park eight months ago.
that's right, we did.
Macy Martinez. She was stabbed, strangled and dumped.
it's still unsolved.
F. I. T.
class of 2011.
she was carried to this spot, not dragged.
that path right there leads to a road that cuts through the park.
easy access.
so what wrong turn did she take to wind up here?
sometimes evil finds you... on the road you take to avoid it.
discoloration and wilting is consistent with your time of death at 24: 36 hours.
two deep puncture wounds just above the heart.
Sid found the same distinct hilt marks in Autopsy on the Macy Martinez case.
manual strangulation with the left hand.
he's the same guy. No doubt about it.
what do you got?
I know what you're going to say.
it's not the way it looks. I'm fine.
it's exactly the way it looks.
that's the same suit you had on yesterday, if not the day before.
you haven't even been home in two days.
this isn't the first time one case has rolled over into another.
I'll be fine.
when's the last time you had something to eat?
I don't want to hear about that trail mix from the vending machine last night.
it was a granola bar.
you promised me you were going to go home and get some sleep.
I was working on some cases. I dozed off on the couch.
then this came in.
boss of the crime lab or not, you're no good to anyone if you're running on fumes.
look, I am not walking out of a homicide investigation.
no, Don is driving you out.
yo.
it's all been arranged.
you're going to go home and get a couple hours' sleep.
and if you're lucky, a toothbrush and a shower might make it feel like eight.
don can't just leave.
sure I can. I'm on my way back to the precinct, anyway.
your place is on the way.
Sid will be expecting me in Autopsy.
it's covered. Your work is done here, Mac Taylor.
don's gonna take you to that diner you love for breakfast, and then take you home and tuck you in.
will he be giving me milk and cookies and singing a lullaby?
the lullaby thing's a little weird.
but milk and cookies could happen.
let's go.
one sec, guys.
that's pretty impressive you got Mac to go home. He's not used to being told what to do.
no, he's not.
expensive lingerie.
Manicure... pedicure recently done, very meticulous.
dressed to impress. Probably a night out on the town, huh?
in the Martinez case, the victim left the club with an older guy the night before she was found.
that stamp is from the Countess Club.
you know, this diner is one of the last places in the city you can still get an egg cream.
so no more milk and cookies?
coach Ryan.
Hey, Mac Taylor. How the hell are you?
good, good.
can I still count on you for the Widows and Orphans event this year?
already in my calendar.
Hey, you fellas know Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum?
sure, Mike. - How're you doing?
Hey, Mike. - How're you doing?
look, I gotta tell you, Great job pickin' up Cromartie and getting Revis into camp, but if you ask me, I think you blew it on the Woodhead thing.
you solve every crime?
that's a good point.
but three words on the draft: Baylor, pass rusher.
everybody's an expert.
mac, I'll be in touch.
all right, Coach.
good seeing you. - Good to see you.
nice to meet you. - Okay, good to see you.
take care. - Take care.
what's the matter with you?
let's go get a snack.
what?
nothing.
I was just thinking.
whoever came up with the formula that every dog year is seven human years?
I don't know.
where the hell did that question come from?
what, do I look that tired?
yeah... kinda do.
but think about it.
all the stuff we deal with, the murder and the mayhem, staying up for two or three nights at a time trying to sort it all out.
how many years do these cases take off our expiration dates?
our expiration dates?
large coffee to go.
and a map that actually makes sense.
where you headed?
it's, uh, first time back in the city in a while.
thought I might go down and check out Lady Liberty, if I can just figure out where the hell I'm going.
come here. I'll show you.
sorry, brother.
Hey, no worries.
all right, here's where we are.
what you want to do is you want to walk over to Broadway, grab the 1 or the 9 train, take it all the way downtown to South Ferry
it's the last stop.
you can hop on the Staten Island Ferry down there.
get a great view of the statue, don't have to get off the boat, and it's free.
here's your coffee, sir.
here you go. Keep it.
Thanks. Appreciate it, man.
you guys have a good day.
two years.
every year as a cop is two human years.
thank you. - Have a good one.
no, no, no. I'm buying.
get out of here. - No, it's mine. I got it.
you're a good man, Mac Taylor.
I had my wallet when we walked in. - You sure?
Yeah, yeah. I checked when we got out of the car. It was in my jacket pocket.
well, you're tired, maybe you left it -
no, I definitely had my wallet.
Ooh, nice work, Miss Messer. Yes.
the training videos, the lectures. It's all finally starting to sink in.
the student has become the teacher.
what are you doing?
it's called improvisation.
Yeah, I-I started taking a theatre class.
I could use a little improv on these.
see that weird circular pattern on the sole of the shoe?
nothing in our database resembles it.
well, I could enhance the tread marks in the photos.
maybe that will help fill in some of the voids in the mold.
that would be smashing.
okay. All right, thanks.
Bye.
I knew it wouldn't be here.
it was worth a shot.
I got uniforms searching storm drains and trash cans for a five-block radius in every direction.
my police I. D.'s deactivated, my credit cards have been flagged.
precinct's putting together photos of picks who match the description.
I should have seen it coming.
he must have reached into your jacket pocket when he was leaning over, showing me the map.
this brazen son of a bitch.
he looked right at my shield. He knew we were cops.
Hey, Jo? - Yeah.
so, our vic's name is Patricia Kelly. She was a senior at F. I. T.
she texted her roommate from the Countess Club around 11: 00, night before last, and said that she met a great guy, and that she wouldn't be coming home.
Yeah, and the roommate started to get worried when she couldn't get ahold of Patricia all day yesterday.
in fact, she went to the precinct this morning to file a missing persons report.
what about the purple trace underneath Patricia's fingernails?
it's a very rare and expensive paint made from dye extracted from sea snails.
Tyrian Purple.
I worked my share of art heist cases at the Bureau.
do you know an ounce of that dye is worth more than a pound of gold?
well, it's not used in any contemporary artwork, so we're talking museum pieces and fine art collections.
no way Patricia's getting near a painting like that in a museum.
Yeah, that's why I'm thinking, however she picked it up, she must have had access to someone's private art collection.
right, which would definitely narrow it down a bit.
so I compiled a list of prominent art collectors in Manhattan.
now, it's not perfect, but it's a start.
y'all are so good.
you know it.
Larry "The Jammer" Burns?
he was arrested on a DUI charge in Manhattan last year.
Oh, please tell me he doesn't have anything to do with these two murders.
he doesn't, but his limited edition sneakers do.
those odd circles on the bottom of the killer's shoes-- They were actually fingerprints.
the Jammer's? - Yup.
but they're emblazoned into the sole of every pair of his Elite edition sneakers.
there were only 500 pair made, and they coast about a thousand bucks apiece.
so, how long do you think it'll take to compile a list of these 500 proud owners?
come on. Who do you think you're dealing with here?
what up? It's already done.
okay. Let's cross reference your list with this list Hawkes made of prominent art collectors.
all right.
here we go.
bingo.
Charles Martin. NYPD.
it's clear.
we're all clear over here.
print powder.
that's very strange.
it looks like... someone sprayed Leuco Crystal Violet in here, looking for evidence of blood.
what the hell's going on?
thinking that Patricia Kelly was murdered in this apartment, and the crime scene's already been processed.
doorman says Martin left sometime early yesterday morning and drove upstate to a business conference.
well, whoever broke in and processed this place used yellow print powder, VMEX swabs and Leuco Crystal Violet.
definitely not NYPD Crime Scene.
well, whoever it was had a basic knowledge of crime scene investigation.
basic knowledge. Kind of like the Feds.
heard that, Messer.
no, no, no. I did some checking.
it's not the Feds, and it's not our guys.
no one's taking responsibility.
well, then who was it, and what were they looking for?
I got tool marks.
this lock was definitely compromised with a pick set, so whoever it was didn't have a key.
found the source of Tyrian Purple.
what, do you have a portable GCMS up there?
no, you don't need one. Poor man's process.
Tyrian Purple turns blue when it's exposed to water.
so the paint under Patricia's fingernails came from her touching his piece of art.
so, basically, Martin kills Patricia Kelly, then cleans up, then dumps her body in the park on his way upstate.
and while he's gone, somebody breaks in and processes the place?
Albany PD said that Martin spent the night, but checked out of his hotel room early this morning before they could get over there and grab him.
let's hope he comes right back here.
there's an alarm out for him.
I'll have a couple teams watching this place around the clock.
Charlie boy shows his face, he's ours.
what the hell are you doing here?
how'd you get up to this floor?
I brought him up.
he found your wallet on the sidewalk near the diner.
I thought you might want to thank him.
it's all there. Even the money.
can't say I didn't think about taking it.
things are pretty tight.
who the hell are you, and what do you want?
where I come from, somebody returns a wallet you lost, you say thank you.
I didn't lose it.
you lifted it out of my jacket, you son of a bitch.
is that right, Detective?
you saw me take it?
I need two uniform officers, Mac Taylor's office, ASAP.
who are you?
I don't much care for the way you're asking.
look at that.
there's only a couple bucks in there, but you're welcome to it if you like.
released from prison a week ago.
get this trash out of my building.
it doesn't feel right just letting him walk out of here.
we don't have enough to arrest him, but I know he took my wallet.
who is Raymond Harris? What does he want?
I'm not sure.
we gonna do this, man?
I think we're cool.
we gonna get out of here, man.
all right.
all right, let's go.
you guys forget something?
all right.
so, I guess you never lose that cop thing after you retire, huh?
it's a curse.
always looking for the bad guys, and we forget to see the good ones.
when was the last... - St. Paddy's Day parade, three years ago.
Yeah.
parades and funerals.
shouldn't be the only time we see each other, Mac.
what's on your mind?
you remember this guy? Raymond Harris?
I locked him up.
we did... in '94.
a warrant on a Lower East Side stash house. Drugs, guns, money.
judge gave him 17 years.
he was released a week ago.
I've run into him a couple of times.
he threaten you?
not exactly, but he picked my pocket right here in this diner, and then he showed up in my office to return the wallet.
I hope you collared his ass.
I didn't actually see him take it.
and when he returned it... everything was still inside.
and he didn't say what it was about?
couple of months after we locked him up, I had a prisoner escort to Rikers.
Harris passed by intake, hooked on to some other prisoners.
you know what you did, man!
knock it off, Harris.
you know what you did!
just keep it moving.
he said it with such conviction.
I believe he thinks he was wronged somehow.
was your informant legit?
the warrant was good, right? There was no
honestly, I resent your questioning my integrity.
and whatever his beef is, it seems to be with you.
look, I don't know what this guy's problem is, but if he came at me, he might come at you.
I have a lot of respect for you, Bill.
we just had a different way of doing things, that's all.
promise me you'll keep your eyes open?
32 years in the monkey suit-- My eyes are always open.
how we doing on the evidence?
there's plenty here to prove that Patricia Kelly was killed in that apartment.
it had been cleaned up, but I found traces of her blood in the carpet fibers and also on the ceiling.
Yeah, she was one of the last cases Stella was working on, and there's evidence that also connects her to Martin's apartment.
this sample is from gravitational blood drops that I found on the bed frame.
they looked like they'd been there for a while.
DNA was a match to Macy Martinez.
she was killed in that apartment, too.
looks like Charles Martin is building quite a violent resume for himself.
Yeah, and it might be worse than we think.
there's evidence that there was another woman there other than Patricia and Macy.
I found a blonde hair in the sofa.
DNA's not in the system.
maybe she's still alive.
or maybe we just haven't found her body.
let's hope for the former.
so, our mystery crime scene investigator probably wore gloves while he was processing the inside, but he forgot something on the outside.
he probably rang the bell to see if anyone was home before he broke in.
got a print.
came back to Mark Fields.
he's a cop?
used to be-- He was fired in 2007 for perjury.
he's a private investigator now.
so why did he process the scene? What was he looking for?
maybe it's not a question of what but of who.
Mr. Fields, we have a missing woman that we're very concerned for her safety.
and right now, you've got a big fat burglary charge hanging over your head.
how far we take your case through the system depends on your level of cooperation.
I found this in your, uh, briefcase inside your car, along with some maps, phone, surveillance photos, financial records.
so why don't you tell us about Christina Marino.
who is she, huh? Why are you following her?
she walked out on her husband Vinny. He's a friend of mine.
he asked me to look into it, find her, bring her back.
Vinny said start with Charles Martin. They were good friends.
so you think she was having an affair with Charles Martin?
I don't know.
but Vinny did keep her on a pretty tight leash.
what were you hoping to find in the apartment?
some sign of Christina.
her phone was shut off; she stopped using her charge cards.
I went in there looking for a suitcase, clothes, an extra toothbrush-- There was nothing.
I smelled a heavy dose of bleach coming from the bedroom.
now, I don't have to tell you guys what that might mean.
so I took a closer look.
all right, well, the blood in the bedroom and the hinge lift you pulled off the coffee table, that belonged to a woman named Patricia Kelly, and she was murdered in that apartment just a couple days ago.
I thought for sure that was Christina's blood in there.
look, I was gonna tell you guys...
just do me a favor, save that for your lawyer.
right now, what I'm interested is finding Christina.
was there anything else in that apartment that might help us find her?
no. That's it.
I swear to God.
Mr. Marino, your wife, did you have any idea that she was gonna leave you?
no...
it was like a sucker punch to the stomach.
you think she's dead, don't you?
there's no evidence of that.
the best we can do is hope that Christina is somewhere safe trying to sort this all out.
he showed up a little while ago.
he went up the back stairwell from the parking garage.
stakeout team chased him up to the roof.
come on, Mr. Martin, step back over the ledge.
any sign of Christina Marino?
no, but I'm hoping this guy can help us out with that before he jumps.
he's not gonna jump.
the only reason he's up on that ledge is because he was chased there.
he just has nowhere else to go.
you take one more step, I'm gonna make a mess in the street down there.
get back.
I'll be right back.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
have a little chat with Mr. Martin.
get back! I said get back!
relax, Mr. Martin.
I'm not gonna try to make you come down from here.
I figure if you're determined to end your life, you're gonna do it no matter what I have to say.
I just wanted to know if you can tell me where Christina Marino is.
you think I'm stupid?
you didn't climb out on this ledge to ask me about Christina.
Oh, I'm here for Macy and Patricia, too, but we both know where they are.
it's Christina I'm worried about now.
I would never do anything to hurt Christina.
I know you don't want to jump-- You're much too fond of yourself for that.
why don't you step back over this ledge and we can chat about Christina on solid ground.
I don't have a lot of options, Detective.
either I jump or I spend the rest of my life in prison.
you don't have to decide that now.
Lord, I've got a dozen great ways you can kill yourself in jail if you change your mind.
let's go.
keep your hands where we can see them.
Hey, good work. You all right?
Yeah, I'm just... it's a little adrenaline rush. Maybe too many cups of tea.
I'm not denying she was here.
so then you can understand why we might be a bit concerned for her safety.
look, Christina was my friend.
two weeks ago, she called me, asked me to meet her at the coffee shop.
when I got there, she was sitting in the corner with this ridiculous... leopard-skin suitcase.
she'd just left her husband.
she wanted to stay with me for a few days.
how long did she stay?
about a week.
she left a few days ago, said she needed to be alone.
said she was gonna get a room in some hotel downtown.
I think she felt like she was imposing.
I guess she was.
because it didn't take long for you to get Patricia Kelly up here and kill her.
then why did you offer to buy me a drink?
it's the first of the hoops you'll try and force me to jump through before we end up going back to my penthouse and making love.
well, if it's any consolation, Detective,
I can assure you that both Patricia and Macy's last moments were filled with pleasure.
you mean up until the moment that you strangled and stabbed them both?
that part of it was my pleasure.
it's an impulse.
I don't expect you to understand.
no, I get it.
it's like the impulse I'm having right now to smash your face in and throw you out that window.
why should we believe you didn't kill Christina?
what you don't understand about Christina is she wasn't like those other women.
she wasn't angling for anything. Those other women were takers.
just like me.
and I think that you know enough about people like me to know I didn't kill her.
any information on Christina Marino's whereabouts?
call me as soon as you're done with the interrogation.
mac, hope I'm not interrupting something.
no, no. Not at all. What's up?
well, I felt kind of bad-- I thought we left off on a sour note.
uh, look, I had no right to accuse you of anything. I was out of line.
now, don't start sounding like a pansy on me, Mac.
I want to put your mind at ease.
I don't have the actual Harris folders, but...
these are some of my personal copies of the paperwork.
bill, this really isn't necessary.
I'm just as curious as you about this dude.
any answers in here?
well, that's just it. Everything we did was textbook.
well, right now, Raymond Harris's perception is his reality.
he's walking around with a chip on his shoulder, and only he knows what it's about.
Yeah.
that makes him dangerous.
what's done is done.
let it go.
Charles Martin proudly admits to murdering two women, so he has no reason to deny killing Christina Marino.
I believe him.
I'm not inclined to give a serial killer the benefit of the doubt, but Christina doesn't seem to fit his victim profile.
well, he had the means and opportunity but no motive.
until we have evidence that she was murdered, we have to assume she's alive.
Hey, Mac, you might want to keep that on.
Christina Marino's cell phone bills show one of her last calls was to a boutique hotel in SoHo four days ago.
Danny and Lindsay are on their way there now.
do Not Disturb" sign was on the door when we got here.
concierge said Christina checked in three days ago.
he hasn't seen her since.
right, she paid for five nights.
clerk at the front desk said that a man called down yesterday requesting no maid service.
probably the same person that broke in, confronted her in the doorway, and then slashed her throat.
let me in, you tramp! - What are you doing?
just get out of here, leave me alone.
arterial spurts... from the left side of the neck.
she was moving.
it looks like she collapsed over here and was beaten, causing the medium velocity spatter.
there was something up against that wall right there.
it's not in this room anymore.
it was a suitcase.
these clothes are resting on top of the blood pool.
they were pulled out of the suitcase after she was killed.
that's how he got her out of here without being seen.
he stuffed her in the suitcase.
when I got there she was sitting in the corner with this ridiculous leopard skin suitcase.
a leopard skin suitcase.
we're no longer looking for a missing woman. We're looking for a missing body.
messy and spontaneous. That's not Charles Martin's style.
so, then, who killed her? Who else even knew she was here?
the husband-- Vincent Marino.
did you have any idea that she was going to leave you?
it was like a sucker punch to the stomach.
he would know about the call to the hotel and he had motive.
Yeah, all right, so how do we go at Vincent Marino without a body?
by acting like we have one.
let's make this simple. We know you killed Christina.
this is outrageous.
I won't sit here and listen to you accuse me like this.
we found Christina's body, Mr. Marino.
now we need you to tell us why you butchered her like that.
only a severed carotid makes that pattern on a wall.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
you've got your facts wrong.
Oh, yeah?
let me see if I got this part right, then.
you cut the left side of Christina's throat in the doorway.
look. - No, no, no.
look at it, Vincent, look at what you did. You did this.
blood was spraying all over the place.
you chased her across the room.
no, s-stop saying that.
you beat her when she was lying on the floor defenseless and dying.
then you dumped her clothes all over the room and stuffed her in her own suitcase.
this leopard skin suitcase.
you zipped it up, rolled it out to your car, and dumped her like a bag of trash.
I gave her everything she could ever want.
everything I did was for her, nothing for me.
all I asked for was, was love, respect.
she told me she hated me.
I begged her to stay.
I begged her to come home like...
I begged her like some fool.
what's the significance of where we found her?
why there?
it's, uh, it's where we met-- Prospect Park.
the first time I saw her, I thought she was this perfect thing, you know, standing there at the edge of the pond, pulling her hair back into a ponytail.
I put her right back where I found her.
mark Fields had no idea that Marino would use the information on that hotel to go there and kill Christina.
I don't think Marino would've caved unless he believed we have the body.
you owe me $70 for this leopard print suitcase, by the way.
you know what?
if Mark Fields doesn't break into Charles Martin's apartment looking for Christina, we probably never solve her murder.
gas company.
who's that?
they call him Wild Bill Hunt. He was my first partner.
don Flack.
pleasure.
what are you doing here, Bill?
seeing you made me think about the guys. I thought I'd drop by and say hello.
maybe poke around a little in the Raymond Harris case file?
I don't think Mr. Harris will be bothering us anymore.
should I expect a body to turn up?
no.
I just had a little chat with him.
I know what you mean by a little chat. You shouldn't have done that.
something tells me you can be very persuasive.
I definitely think I got my point across.
bill... Harris isn't going to scare easy.
I could see it in his eyes.
trust me, he's scared.
you should have left it alone, Bill.
careful, my man. You look like you're falling in love.
Oh, yeah. Indahouse. That's what I'm talking about!
no, seriously. Look around.
every guy in here is drooling over her, and she's only got eyes for you.
thank you.
excuse me, Officer.
sergeant.
sorry, Sergeant. I'm looking for Danny Messer.
he's my husband. At least I think he is.
I haven't seen him in days.
you trying to break my heart?
get an I. D?
michael Schaefer, 21-year-old Brooklyn City College student.
what about the girl? - She found the body.
claims that she and the vic left the club she was playing last night and came back to the apartment.
probably thought it was the luckiest night of his life.
unfortunately, it was also his last.
Hey, stranger. So you're back.
it's official.
I talked to Sinclair yesterday.
retirement papers have already been pulled.
great. That's great news. Welcome back.
Oh, hey, Mac. We missed you.
see, I told you he'd be back.
you did? You didn't say that.
Yeah, I did. I said he'd be back.
I said that, but whatever.
Yeah, no, I said you'd be back.
all right, all right. Are you two done?
we have a dead body here that needs to be processed.
obvious signs of forced entry.
probably gonna want to pheno these shards of glass.
there's, uh, no usable prints, and, uh...
uh, are you working the crime scene or me?
Nah, go ahead. Do your thing.
I'll just go check on the canvass.
he misses all this. - Yeah.
why don't you take a deep breath?
relax, all right?
okay.
do you remember hearing anything? Any yelling? An argument?
someone trying to break in?
no. No, just a gunshot. I came out of Michael's room, and I...
I found him on the f-floor.
I-I tried to... hold his head up.
I didn't... I didn't know what to do. I'm sorry.
that's all right.
I just... I can't believe this is happening.
I...CAN'T believe he's dead.
she found him; called it in.
the victim live here alone?
roommate's name is Josh Herman.
apparently they've been best friends since grade school.
was he here at the time of the shooting?
not sure. We're still trying to track him down.
defensive bruising on the arms.
here.
stellate tearing around the wound.
victim struggled with his attacker before being shot at close range.
we, we know robbery wasn't a motive.
so what was?
I was asleep in Michael's room when it happened.
Oh, my God. Michael. Michael.
just take your time. I know this must be hard for you.
how long did you know Michael?
only a few weeks.
we met at the... the music store where I work.
he was with his roommate Josh.
sure, they formed later, but the Pistols captured the image.
the sex, the drugs, the rock and roll.
not the rock and roll. That's where you're wrong.
but sure, they had the music.
no doubt about it, but the punk sound didn't start with them.
title goes to the Kinks. 1964.
actually, you're both right.
image and sound are equally important.
of course, that also makes you both wrong.
so was the first punk band, then?
easy. The Ramones.
first to incorporate the sound and the image.
she's right.
founded right here in Forest Hills, Queens, 1974.
before the Sex Pistols.
are you any good?
sound a lot better coming off a set of strings like that, but, um...
Yeah, I know how to get it on.
Miranda, there's a guy in the back that could use a little help.
sure.
sounds like the two of you really hit it off.
did Michael and Josh have any problems?
no.
you know, they were like brothers, you know.
we found close to $300 in 20s on the floor next to Michael's body.
did he owe anybody any money that you know of?
no. I mean, if anything, it was the opposite.
he... he seemed like he was doing pretty well.
I can't believe you have this song.
get out. You bought the Gibson?
I thought you said you didn't play.
well, it's not for me; it's for you.
what?
Michael, seriously?
Ah, it's... it's okay. I wanted to do it.
Hey, look, it doesn't have to mean anything if you don't want it to.
no.
no, Michael, it... it does.
it means everything.
that's quite an expensive gift from someone you just met.
he didn't even have to do it.
I was already falling for him.
he was so different from all the guys I'm used to.
he was... sweet, genuine. Honest.
I can't imagine how anyone would want to hurt him.
Tyler, I'm your mama.
I meddle. That's what I do.
so what's up with the new roommate? What happened to the old one?
pleasure doing business with you. - Yeah.
anybody ever tell you that money cannot buy you happiness?
Ah, you want to bet?
okay, never mind. I'll talk to you at lunch. Bye.
okay, what was that all about?
what? - Sheldon, money.
Hawkes had him pegged coming back November 30 or earlier.
which means you must have had him coming back after November 30.
uh, kind of, yeah. - What do you mean, kind of?
uh, kind of, as in... um, never.
you mean you thought Mac Taylor was never coming back to this crime lab?
how come you didn't let me in on this bet?
I'd have cleaned up on all you fools.
any word from Flack on the whereabouts of the vic's roommate?
Josh Herman? Still in the wind.
you thinking he had something to do with it?
well, possible suspect.
hopefully not another victim.
they were roommates.
if he did have something to do with it, I'm not sure why he'd have to break the window.
well, we're sending the photos and physical description to the media, so I'll keep you posted.
no "Good to see you, Mac? " Uh,"Welcome back to the lab"?
nothing?
I never thought you were gone in the first place.
now, there's a sight for sore eyes.
it's good to be back, Sid.
so, what's it like? - What is what like?
on the outside.
you made it, man-- you were free.
what did that feel like?
it felt good. I'm very happy with what I accomplished.
but yet, here you are, back inside.
it means you're institutionalized. You realize that, don't you?
these walls are funny, you know?
first you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em, and pretty soon, you start to depend on 'em.
I, uh, confirmed your suspicions regarding the victim's defensive bruising and the close-contact nature of the gunshot wounds.
there was a struggle.
Yes, but on further examination of the body,
I found a small entrance wound close to the victim's armpit.
so, what we thought at the scene was a close-contact entrance wound was really an exit wound.
means there's still a bullet at the crime scene.
I also found a dark smudge on the side of the victim's face.
took a sample, sent it upstairs.
and what was that you were working on?
a piece of skin.
found it attached to the victim's clothing.
is that some kind of reptile or a fish?
Yes, you're correct.
it's from a reptile.
it's good to be back.
now, this, I missed.
Hey, boss.
welcome back.
you want to tell me what's going on here?
okay, well...I was processing Miranda's shirt for blood.
I found microscopic tears in the fabric.
could've caught her clothing on something.
the fray pattern should suggest whether or not it was snagged.
in addition to it being snagged, I also found evidence that suggests that it was cut.
now, all the tests that I've run-- with the wire brush, sandpaper, knife, scissors-
have all resulted in either fraying or cutting...
but not both.
till now.
t-shirt was cut by broken window glass -
looks like Miranda was lying about how she got into Michael's apartment last night.
I wasn't lying.
I was... I was covered in Michael's blood. He was still lying there dead.
I guess I...
I don't...I don't know, I guess I just forgot.
you forgot you broke in to your boyfriend's apartment, where he was later murdered while you were conveniently asleep in his back bedroom, is that right?
I was in shock. I-I wasn't thinking straight.
about the break-in or about the murder?
you think I broke in to Michael's apartment, shot him, ran off to hide the gun somewhere, then came back into his apartment and smeared blood all over myself and called 911?
is that it? - I don't know, is that it?
Oh, you're twisted.
sit down.
I said, sit down.
you know, I listened to a couple of your songs, saw a couple performances online, and you have a theme going of anger, frustration... emptiness.
did something happen to you when you were younger?
did you happen to lose someone? Someone close?
I'd like to leave.
mother? Father? Sibling, maybe?
are we done?
no, we're not done. Tell me what happened last night, Miranda.
I didn't kill him!
we both know you broke into his apartment; I have evidence to prove it.
so tell me what happened.
michael lost his keys at the club.
I can't believe this-- I think I lost my keys.
sorry.
hold on.
uh, okay, uh, where are you going?
fire escape.
wait-- what are you doing? This is dangerous.
what are you doing?
okay, yeah...I didn't think of that one.
what about his roommate Josh? Where was he?
he said he was gonna crash at a friend's place-- I don't have a name.
you could've told me all this before, you know.
Yeah, yeah, well, I didn't, okay?
look... I'm sorry, I just...
I didn't think you'd believe me. I've gotten in trouble before.
shoplifting... fake I. D.-- nothing that forecasts murder.
but I could be wrong.
it was my dad who died.
car accident. I was, um... I was 16.
he, uh... he would've liked Michael.
my father.
he would've approved.
we like her for it?
not sure.
everything she's saying is supported by the evidence.
where are we on the roommate?
I checked with Brooklyn City College, where Josh is a student.
he was a no-show at all his classes today.
I tried tracking him through his financials-- there was no recent ATM or credit card activity.
but he does have just over 12 grand in a savings account.
where does a college kid like him get money like that?
I could think of a few ways, none of which are legal.
also, I spoke to a number of witnesses at the nightclub who saw Michael and Josh together.
apparently, they were having quite a time-- especially Josh.
he was throwing around all kinds of money, buying everybody at the bar drinks.
clearly, things took a turn for the worse.
we got alarms out on him?
all five boroughs.
expand it to the Tri-state area.
let's find him.
you got it.
Hey, Mac-- results on the smudge Sid collected from the victim's face.
ink, glass cleaner, mineral oil... auto degreaser.
Yeah. I'm not sure what it means, either.
this, however, might be helpful.
its primary use is as a tattoo aftercare lotion.
I don't recall Sid saying our victim had a tattoo.
could mean our victim's roommate Josh Herman recently got one, though.
you get the name of the tattoo parlor this lotion came from?
Mac... you haven't been gone so long that we've forgotten how to do this.
Flack's on his way there now.
that's a good choice: yin and yang.
thing is, right now you're thinking yin; when you're 50 years old, you'll probably be thinking yang.
Yeah, I remember him.
he was in here a couple of days ago.
Yeah, kind of hard to forget that guy, actually.
I haven't done one of these in a while.
you ever look inside the mouth of one?
insane teeth. Rows of them, razor-sharp.
they could rip a person to shreds if they wanted to.
Oh, and get this. They're the only animal other than humans to have sex for pleasure.
a dolphin?
that's what he wanted on his back permanently?
I hear you, man.
I do my best to steer people's decisions so they won't regret it later, but this kid was determined.
kept telling me how smart dolphins are, how the military trains them to attack warships, crazy stuff like that.
what's a tattoo that size go for?
uh, that one ran a little over a grand.
a thousand bucks for Flipper?
200 bucks an hour. What could I say?
so you guys spent some time together. You talk about anything else?
not really. The guy wouldn't shut up about dolphins.
Oh, and his friends.
kept going on and on about how his best buddy got some new girl and how it was screwing up their friendship.
you know, if I had to guess, it was his obsession with dolphins that created that divide.
not the girl.
listen, if he happens to come back in for a, uh, starfish tattoo, let's say, do me a favor and give me a buzz.
Yeah.
Tyler, before I hear about the new roommate, what happened to the old one?
I had to kill him.
I asked him who his favorite player on the Knicks was, he said Woody Allen.
see, that's funny. I like him.
well, then you live with him.
anyways, just... irreconcilable differences, you know?
he was different... and I don't like to reconcile.
so, what's wrong with the new roommate-- Alex? - Nothing.
then why the meeting before the meeting?
well, I need you to cosign on the new lease agreement for me.
Oh, I see.
you don't want your overprotective mom to embarrass you in front of your new friend, is that it?
no, Mom, we've been friends for five months.
okay? Now, will you please just sign it?
absolutely not. Not until I meet him, anyway.
Why?
because I want to know who my son is moving in with, that's why.
I see. You don't trust my judgment.
Oh, I trust you. It's just this Alex...Kirkland person.
what's his major, anyway?
art. I know. Scary, right?
all right, I guarantee you his mother right now is saying, "Who's this Tyler kid? I want to meet him."
I highly doubt that.
look, I'm sure he's great. I just want to meet him first.
what up?
Adam, how many college roommates did you have?
uh, whew... okay.
let's see, first, there was Todd, but that ended with the whole atomic cat eye incident.
atomic cat eye incident?
Yeah, you know, when, like, someone drinks too much, and they pass out, and you, like, sneak up and...
I don't really want to know. Just ballpark it for me.
uh... 12, I guess.
12 roommates?!
any of 'em ever get arrested?
Todd, and it was for public indecency.
Why? What's up?
Tyler's moving in with a new roommate.
Oh, man! You broke the Mom code and looked him up?
well, I didn't get any specifics. The juvie record's sealed.
trespassing and criminal mischief.
looks like you guys got something in common.
I'm just concerned.
do you have something for me? - I do.
comparative microscopic analysis results from EDNA.
snakeskin?
no indication our vic or his roommate had snakes for pets.
well, somewhere along the line, our vic had a run-in with a boa constrictor.
pigmentation is a little... - Off.
unnatural, even.
I'm all over it.
Oh, and by the way, the whole Tyler roommate thing-- it's gonna be fine.
you know, usually people with priors never commit crimes within a five-mile radius of where they live.
Oh, get out of here.
mac, what would you say if I told you I could quadruple your money?
you trying to talk me back into retirement?
I'd say, it sounds too good to be true, not to mention illegal.
Oh, it's definitely illegal.
you got five bucks on you?
five bucks?
this better be good.
all right, you've got ink, auto degreaser, mineral oil, and glass cleaner, okay?
all four components were detected in a smudge that Sid collected off Michael's body, right?
watch this.
a little bit of...
paper's the real thing.
giving it the right feel. Thickness, texture.
detection pen would work, too.
the watermark and the security strip are wrong, but...
well, it's for a five, not a 20, but at least it's there.
people don't scrutinize twenties the same way as they do hundreds, so it would be easy to pass off.
this could explain why all the twenties were left behind at the crime scene.
whoever the killer is must have known the bills were fake.
now we know the real reason for Michael's murder.
counterfeit cash.
yo, just spoke to Flack.
the apartment search turn up anything?
Yep-- auto degreaser, ink jet printer, scanner, glass cleaner, hair dryer -
everything you need for printing counterfeit money.
well, the problem is, everything you just listed is also a regular household item, easily explained away.
everything but the scanned image of the $20 bill that was found on the hard drive of Josh's computer.
I want everything brought back to the lab and processed for prints.
Michael's or anyone else's hands were on that equipment, I want to know about it.
at this point, all the evidence suggests the counterfeit money was being printed by the victim's roommate, Josh Herman.
that explains where all of Josh's money came from.
could also explain why he's still in the wind. We just don't know if he's the killer, or another victim.
according to Flack, all the witnesses at the club saw Josh throwing a lot of money around.
money which we now know was counterfeit.
michael could have found out what Josh was doing and confronted him back at the apartment.
things went from bad to worse.
according to Miranda, Josh was never at the apartment last night.
what about his roommate Josh? Where was he?
he said he was gonna crash at a friend's place. I-I don't have a name.
and since we don't know who that friend is, that story can't be verified until we find Josh.
jpegs of the counterfeit cash we've recovered have been sent to the Secret Service.
they're combing through data, compiling lists of New York City merchants where Josh may have spent some of the money.
wherever he passed the bills before, he might go back and try again.
could Josh and Michael's argument have been over the girl, Miranda?
so who was the first punk band then?
easy. The Ramones.
first to incorporate the sound and the image.
she's right.
we're looking into that, as well.
isn't it possible Josh fled the city?
possible, but not likely.
Flack reached out to Josh's parents, friends, everyone else we could come up with, but no sign of him yet.
what about the vic's cell phone?
missing. No signal.
killer must have taken it, shut it down.
what about surveillance? - Already in place.
we also have photos and a description of both Josh and his money out to every bus station, train station and airport within a 100-mile radius of this city.
if this kid tries to run to buy as much as a pack of gum, we're gonna hear about it.
not bad. - You think?
Yeah. Thought-provoking, interesting color scheme, detailed shading.
impressive.
let you in on a little secret?
I used to do this when I was younger.
Really? - Yeah.
you, Dr. Sheldon Hawkes?
Oh, it just feels like a lifetime ago, but, oh, yeah.
who's the artist?
I don't know yet. Haven't met him.
whoever he is, he's pretty good.
Yeah. Right.
all right, well, that sounds like it might be him.
when was this?
okay. Thank you.
doesn't look like the work of a professional.
the media photos are paying off. Crime Stoppers just got another Josh sighting.
he's still in the city.
secret Service getting in on this?
Yep. They gave us 12 locations where Josh's bills have turned up for the past two months.
12-- that's a lot of bad bills. What's he buying?
you name it-- uh, cigars, booze, jewelry... clothing-- a lot of Adidas track suits.
who is he, Run DMC?
all right. Not what I was expecting.
look, honey, I can't get out of here. Can lunch wait, like, an hour?
scheduled break, babe. You know that. It's now or never, sweetheart.
are you mad? - Yeah...I am mad, but not at you. At, uh, Run DMC over here.
felony lunch-jacking. I'll make sure they add it to his list of charges.
crime Lab. Messer.
are you sure?
okay. Thanks.
secret Service.
some of Josh's bills turned up at a First Federation branch in the Village.
they traced the deposit back to Randy's Rock Shop.
it's the same place the vic's girlfriend works.
it's also where Michael bought the guitar.
careful with it.
and no Skynyrd.
if I hear "Sweet Home Alabama" one more time, I swear, I'm gonna sell this place.
you have a problem with Alabama?
she's from the South. Maybe we should start over.
I understand some counterfeit bills were traced to a deposit you made the other day?
Yeah. Bank just called to notify me about it.
remember selling a '59 Gibson recently?
Yeah. It was a great stick.
expensive stick.
wait-- was that the kid that passed me the fake bills?
Yeah. That's him. That's the kid.
21-year-old kid comes in here, dumps two grand cash on a guitar, you don't find that strange?
no. I mean, he's a nice kid.
he hangs out with one the girls I got working here for me.
where were you last night at 2: 00 a. m?
Why?
what's this about?
Michael's dead. Murdered.
and you think this has something to do with me?
we're not saying that. Just want to know where you were last night.
well, I was at home... in bed, asleep.
anyone who can verify that?
no.
wait. Wait-Wait a second. What are you doing there?
what are you writing down there?
it's a pretty nice shop you got here. Guessing the rent must be kind of steep.
what's that supposed to mean?
listen, I feel bad about what happened to that kid, all right?
I mean, nobody's supposed to die over, what, a couple hundred bucks?
but I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree. I had nothing to do with it.
and to be honest with you, if I was to deposit some money that I had no idea was fake, that doesn't exactly say I'm guilty of anything.
so if you'll excuse me, I got rent to make.
he's right-- we've got motive, means, and opportunity, but we don't have proof.
and even if Randy did kill Michael, why is Josh the one who's still in the wind?
another question is, why would Michael knowingly spend some of his fake bills on a gift for his girlfriend at the same place where she works?
well, maybe he didn't realize it was fake in the first place.
I looked over all the Secret Service case reports that Lindsay put together.
the only time counterfeit bills were passed by someone fitting Michael's description was at Randy's Rock Shop.
all the other times the bills turned up, it was Josh, working alone.
and with all the purchases Josh made, there is a very good chance he passed some of the bills at the wrong place, ripping off the wrong guy.
killer went to the apartment looking for Josh. Michael was there instead, got in the way.
collateral damage.
with the killer still out there, this could mean that Josh isn't running from the police.
he's running for his life.
ran the snakeskin recovered from Michael's body through every spectroscopic instrument we got.
and you found out what the unnatural pigmentation is from?
Yeah, it's a complicated mixture of methylacylates and phenyl ketones.
acrylic paint on snakeskin?
strange thing is, the mixture crystallizes with exposure to UV light.
acrylic paint, when combined with UV hardening compounds, is sometimes used in gel fingernail polish.
listen, I feel bad about what happened to that kid, all right?
I mean, nobody's supposed to die over, what, a couple hundred bucks?
Randy Davis, music store guy-- his fingernails were painted black.
okay, so maybe a piece of his fingernail polish chipped off during a struggle with Michael.
Yeah.
Randy Davis' confidence was just a little too confident.
okay, so what are you thinking?
Randy lied.
he must have made a drop at the bank, not realizing some of the counterfeit bills were in his deposit.
that was Danny.
one of his patrol officers just collared a dealer who had some of our fake bills on him.
said he got 'em from a guy matching Josh Herman's description.
Josh's best friend was murdered and he's out buying drugs?
he wasn't buying drugs.
he was buying a gun.
28, there you go, man.
later, man. Thank you.
can never be too sure these days.
what, we got a problem?
Yeah. We got a problem.
W-W-Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy, man.
put down the gun, man, let's talk about this. I'm sure we can work something out.
michael was my best friend. - Look, I didn't mean to hurt Michael.
stop moving. - Put the gun down and let's talk about it, okay?
I said stop moving.
michael told me it was you on the phone before you shot him, before you killed him.
okay, look, man, I'm telling you the truth, man, I didn't know the money was fake.
someone gave it to me. - Who gave it to you?
just give me a couple days; I'll get you your money.
I need my money now.
you know what? Here, call him, call him right now.
get him down here.
call him. - Okay.
just get him over here.
Hey, Josh, it's me.
Yeah, tell him to get down here. Tell him.
record store guy-- he knows. Run, Josh, run!
don't come home, don't come back, don't come home!
shut up. - Don't, run!
michael had no idea the money was fake.
he was innocent in all of this, and you killed him.
it was an accident. The gun just went off, all right?
do you realize what your money did, man?
look at this. You see that?
this is from Jimmy.
works for the bookie that I owe six grand to.
he came down here and pimp-slapped me with his nine for trying to pass $1, 200 in counterfeit-- your counterfeit.
I wasn't trying to kill nobody, man. I was just trying to get my money back.
NYPD! Drop it!
I said drop it!
keep your hands in the air.
what?
put the gun down, Josh.
I can't let him get away with this.
killing this man isn't going to change anything.
put the gun down!
Oh, I didn't-- he pulled the gun on me, man.
is this the gun you used for the murder?
you know what I'd call this? Proof.
I didn't pull the trigger. It was an accident.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you know, you may want to invest in some nail polish remover before you get where you're going.
this is going to be interesting.
mom, hi.
so... I would like you to meet Alex.
your new roommate-- nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
you didn't tell me she was a very attractive girl.
he didn't say you were unattractive-- he just didn't say you were a girl.
woman-- very attractive woman.
thank you.
I'm not buying it. You found her picture on the Internet, didn't you?
no.
or one of your police databases.
it's not like I intentionally went and looked her up.
I just happened to stumble across some stuff-- your beautiful artwork, which I'd love to hear more about.
I'm starving-- why don't we get a table?
Yeah. After you.
thank you.
cute. - Mom, she's a roommate-- strictly a roommate.
I knew if I told Michael the money was fake, he wouldn't take it.
he was always the good kid.
made the right decisions, always on the straight and narrow...
so I made up a lie.
there it is, there it is, there it is.
Touchdown!
nice catch.
three in a row. Want to go again?
Oh, no, I can't. I am meeting up with Miranda.
what, you think she's into you? You gonna give her the moves this time?
maybe.
God, I really like this girl.
I-- you know, I just don't want to rush it and blow it, you know?
Hey, uh, you remember that guitar she said she wanted?
whoa, where'd you get all that?
moving mad rock, yo.
okay, come on, really.
Nah, I've been pulling extra shifts at the deli.
look, it-it's no big deal, it's just a few hundred bucks.
consider it a loan. You pay me back whenever.
okay, all right. All right.
Thanks, buddy.
it was stupid.
don't know what I was thinking.
if I could go back and change it all, I would.
michael was my best friend.
I just wanted to help him out, get him the girl he wanted, that's all.
I'm trying to sympathize with you here, Josh-- really, I am -
but what I can't get past is that you willingly dragged your best friend into this.
you want to act stupid, break the law? Fine, go ahead, do it.
just do us all a favor-- leave the innocent people out of it.
Sarge! Hey, Sarge!
we got an officer down.
we need a bus over here at 34th and Lexington. Hurry. - Copy that.
Sarge? Sarge, you all right?
Sarge, you okay?
I had to do it. He pulled a gun.
I had no choice.
don't move.
all right...tell me...
tell me what happened -- off the record -- so I know.
they jumped us. Three of 'em did it.
Yeah, that guy on the ground hit you with a bottle. We started fighting.
is that the guy from the bar? - Yeah. Yeah.
all right, so where's the other two?
we chased them around the corner, but we lost them.
Cooper says this guy had a weapon.
Yeah. Yeah, nickel-plated . 38, maybe.
he fired at her, she returned fire, took him down.
had to do it, right?
all right, so you guys are saying that this guy right here had a gun and he took a shot at Lauren.
Yeah. Yeah.
Where's his gun?
you're saying that three guys jumped you when you left the bar.
Yeah. Guy on the ground pulled a gun and fired one shot, and he went down.
you see what happened to the gun?
he had it when I shot him.
did one of the other men take the gun when they fled?
the guy on the ground pulled the gun.
officer Cooper fired one shot. He went down.
I understand that part, Officer. I'm asking about his friends.
guy on the ground pulled a gun.
Yeah, and Officer Cooper fired one shot; I got that.
then you got enough to fill out your report.
you know the drill.
I'm not saying another word till my rep gets here.
run me through it, Danny.
the guy in the white shirt, he's a sloppy drunk.
I'm gonna crack him in the head if he says one more word to me.
this was the victim? - Yeah.
he got aggressive with Cooper.
she said, you know, she told him to back off.
I'm not causing any trouble, okay?
I just want to buy the lady a drink.
come on.
Hey, the girl's not thirsty.
he was reluctant to leave.
come on, man. Stop it.
so I showed him the door.
you identify yourself as a policeman?
no, Mac, I mean, the guy was wasted -- I show him my shield, it makes things worse.
the guy was a jerk.
and I didn't give it a second thought...
till a few hours later.
next thing I know, I'm looking up into the sky, my off-duty piece is in Cooper's hand, and this guy is dead.
why did Officer Cooper have your weapon?
I was the only one carrying.
it was three men that jumped you? - That's right, three of them.
Foley and Cates, they start fighting with them.
vic pulls out a nickel-plated revolver.
well, you didn't see that, Danny -- you were unconscious.
that's what my people are saying.
they've already made their statements. - Right.
I see what this is. It's an officer-involved shooting, talking three-ring circus
those cops are the main attraction, right?
not just them.
you're their supervisor. You were in the bar.
somebody got shot. The gun is missing.
bosses will want someone to answer.
you're the one with the stripes, Danny.
get ready.
GSR field test came back positive.
means the victim had a gun.
maybe.
officer Cooper told Danny that she checked the victim's vitals after shooting him.
maybe the GSR transferred from her hands to his.
there's no other evidence here that backs up those cops' story.
they all had their stories straight.
just like they rehearsed it. - Makes sense.
they'll be under so much scrutiny, one little detail's off and they're all screwed.
have the vic's I. D. Pete Miller.
his business card says he's a housepainter. No criminal record.
that's not exactly the profile of a guy who brings a gun to a bar fight.
canvassed the area to see if the gun got dumped. Nothing.
plus we got no witnesses other than the cops who saw the shooting go down, and the dead guy's friends who are in the wind.
someone must have heard shots. - Yeah. Except they heard one shot.
so we got no witnesses, no gun.
there's four off-duty cops and a dead civilian.
don't worry, don't worry. It's just a little cut. Little cut.
let me see.
Danny, there's still glass in your head.
we should get a sample to Mac.
mac already got a sample. You're off the clock.
look, let me take you to the hospital.
I'm fine, babe.
I got to stay here for them.
there's nothing you can do for them now, honey, except maybe bleed all over them.
she's right, Sergeant Messer. Can't mess around with a head injury.
I'm Lieutenant Adler, Internal Affairs.
how you doing? It's not -- it's not a head injury.
great. Then you won't mind answering a few questions.
actually, he does mind. We're on our way to the E. R.
you're not going to make me pull rank here, are you?
you know you got to talk to me. - Look, Lieutenant...
according to regulations, he has 24 hours before he can be compelled to make a statement.
so he can talk to you then.
I removed several shards of glass from the palm of the victim's left hand.
appears to be consistent with the glass the EMTs pulled from Danny's head.
I did a full tox screening, too.
blood alcohol level was . 19.
the bartender at Rattigans said the victim only ordered one drink, and was already visibly impaired.
means he did his drinking someplace else.
to be thorough, I checked the stomach contents.
found these.
some kind of stones?
they're carved in perfect cubes.
perhaps he ingested them wherever he was before Rattigans.
I'll bring them back to the lab.
what you're taught at the academy.
fire in bursts of twos and threes.
yet here we have a single gunshot wound to the chest, almost perfectly placed.
bullet lodged in the heart.
could mean Officer Cooper kept cool. Took an opportunity.
lucky shot in an unlucky situation.
of course, he may not have had a gun at all, Mac.
in which case, she fired by mistake and killed an unarmed man.
Hey, Adam. - Hey, Linds.
you ever dance with the green fairy?
I can't help you, Adam.
I'm talking about absinthe.
it's the 19th century version of magic mushrooms.
do you know why they call it the green fairy?
because it's made with wormwood, and it contains thujone.
it's a narcotic, and I found it all over Pete Miller's shirt.
it causes hallucinations and, you know, maybe that's what was up with our vic.
I really can't say.
might explain why a guy with no criminal record goes out and gets a gun.
now, this... I can't make heads or tails of.
it's some kind of fiber.
at first, I thought hair, but its thickness is way under 50 micrometers.
Oh, so it's too thin to be human hair, so what, fur maybe?
Adam, what do you get when you have a sergeant involved in a shooting, his wife who works in the crime lab and an IAB investigation?
conflict of interest.
I'm... Oh, I'm sorry. I...
is he okay? - Oh, yeah, he's fine.
he's got a couple stitches in his head.
he's gonna give a statement to Internal Affairs.
all right, well, you tell him that we're all thinking about him.
I will. Thanks, Adam.
tell Edna I said hello.
got the elemental breakdown on the GSR from the victim's hand.
residue matched the gun Officer Cooper fired.
that confirms it was transferred from her hand to the victim's.
Yeah, but that's not all.
I found more gunshot residue on the upper part of the victim's hand, and all over the left arm of his shirt, sleeve to shoulder.
the elemental composition is different.
so, there were two guns.
Pete Miller used one of them. Friends must have taken it when they fled.
Flack's trying to track 'em down, but all he has is the cops' descriptions to go by.
no luck so far.
there's one thing I bet the friends didn't take when they ran.
the bullet Pete fired.
let's try over there, don't you think?
Yeah, right over there down the street.
since we don't have the gun, this may be able to show us the direction of the bullet.
Hey, check it out.
you may have been better coming in here with your wife.
she was more on the ball than any union rep I've ever dealt with.
let's begin with the, uh, fight at the bar.
it wasn't a fight.
kid was out of line. I showed him the door.
Ah, the victim we're talking about.
and by showing him the door, you mean dragging him by the neck?
Yeah, he was a disturbance.
Yeah, a disturbance to Officer Cooper.
no one else complained.
couple hours later, you leave the bar. - Yeah.
couple guys come out of nowhere.
one of them assaults me with a bottle, which when broken qualifies as a deadly weapon.
right. What happened next?
it was a brawl.
cates and Foley were fighting these three guys.
must have been getting their asses kicked for you to draw down on the victim with Sergeant Messer's weapon.
well, I drew down because the victim was brandishing a gun.
he was dead before he hit the ground.
so, why did Officer Cooper use your weapon?
I tell my guys to keep their off-duty pieces at home when they go to the bar.
but you were armed.
Yeah, I wasn't drinking.
and thank God I had my gun. Otherwise, we might be investigating a cop murder.
bartender tells us you were running a tab last night.
pints of beer, shots of whiskey, tequila.
lieutenant, like I said, I wasn't drinking.
so it was your officers who imbibed all that liquor?
two beers. I stopped a couple hours before we left.
what about Sergeant Messer? What do you think about him?
as a boss?
he's excellent.
officer Cooper -- she's smart, she's got instincts.
I think she'll be a good cop.
well, she speaks highly of you, as well. Says you're a great boss.
let's review your choices last night.
you went out drinking with your patrolmen, you brought a loaded weapon into a crowded bar, got into an altercation with a patron.
ended up the night half-unconscious on the pavement as one of your officers shot the patron to death with your own weapon.
you seem capable, Sergeant Messer.
things you did in that lab... way over my head.
but as a boss, you're way over yours.
how's this?
increase the angle a little.
okay.
all right, that's about the angle the bullet bounced off the sign in reconstruction.
okay, locked in.
Hey, I got something.
found our missing bullet.
now all we got to do is find the gun.
yo, googly eyes, come on!
you got to have decent aim with saucers like those!
Hey, how about you, big mama? Waddle on over here for me.
Oh, I'm kidding, baby. I come from love.
Oh, Mr. Doom and Gloom.
you look confused. What, I'm talking too fast for you?
Yeah, let me slow it down.
I can see right through you, and it's depressing me.
Oh, don't get angry, get even. Five dollars -- that's all it takes.
let it all out.
Hey, even a sad sack like you can get lucky once.
star and proprietor of Get the Geek.
this guy insults you, you pay him five bucks, get a chance to shoot him with a paintball gun.
well, clearly, the shooter didn't understand the rules of the game.
he shot him with a real gun.
could we at least get a description?
sketch artist is sitting with the witnesses right now.
get the Geek, huh?
I bet he told his mother he was in show business.
how was Danny's interview with IAB?
uh, he said it went fine.
good.
Yeah, one friend to another, Sheldon -- how's the case looking?
between you and me, we found a bullet that confirms Pete Miller had a gun.
did you get the gun?
ran it through IBIS. No hits.
but still, we'll get it, Lindsay.
don't look so happy. - No, that's good. It's good.
if you find the gun, it will clear Officer Cooper.
clears them all.
well, not necessarily. I mean, even if you close this case today, it's still an embarrassment for the department.
they're still gonna want to point the finger at somebody.
for what?
you have any idea how many administrative regulations there are, Sheldon?
I do, 'cause I stayed up all night reading about 'em.
look, Lindsay, I know you're worried, okay?
but we're scientists, and there's no empirical evidence to suggest Internal Affairs is on a witch hunt.
well, I hope you're right.
I got good news and bad news, Sheldon.
good news is, this fiber looks like something Adam pulled off Pete Miller's clothing.
what's the bad news?
it means I can't work this case anymore.
the bullet Sid pulled from the Rockaway victim is a match to the bullet found at last night's crime scene.
it's the same gun.
confirms Officer Cooper's story that Pete Miller pulled a gun on her.
she shot him, one of his friends ran off with it.
Danny and the other cops positively identified the sketch of the Rockaway suspect as one of their attackers.
why keep a gun that's already been connected to a shooting?
if he gets picked up with it, he's done.
Adam found traces of absinthe on Pete Miller's shirt.
maybe our suspect is still running around with the green fairy.
we're talking about a suspect who walked up to a random stranger and blew him away.
but he's got a loaded gun.
how you doing? How you holding up?
all right.
my PBA rep says we're in a good position to avoid any charges.
that's good, Coop, that's good, but I wasn't talking about the charges.
right.
I'm okay.
don't feel anything, really.
well, you're gonna.
I did the right thing.
the guy had a gun.
I shouldn't feel bad.
well, how you should feel doesn't really play into it.
when you, uh, take a life, no matter how justified, it messes you up.
you're gonna want talk to someone about it.
you want to talk to someone who's been there.
it's good.
Cooper, come over here.
Yeah, just hold on a sec, guys.
Cooper, now.
go ahead. Talk to you later.
Yeah.
Leo said we got to stay away from him.
Yeah, I know.
come on. - All right.
detective Taylor?
hear we have some movement on our missing gun.
it was used in a Far Rockaway homicide a few hours ago.
suspect shot an innocent bystander.
but you didn't retrieve the gun?
not yet.
we both know that gun is out there. We know it was used outside the bar last night.
is there any question this was a good shoot?
you think I'm wasting my time?
I think you're focused on Sergeant Messer and I'm wondering who's whispering in your ear about him.
look, I approach my investigations the same way you do, Detective.
I look at the facts and the evidence.
there's no grand conspiracy here.
I'm not one of those cops who's down on Internal Affairs, but I'd be naive not to see that politics are behind this investigation.
well, should I just ignore the part Sergeant Messer played in last night's incident?
no, but you also shouldn't hang him out to dry.
well, you've known him a long time.
what do you think about him?
Danny's a good cop.
you haven't always felt that way.
subway shooting Messer was involved in a few years back?
a cop was killed.
Yeah, just one highlight from his personnel file.
just say he's had an interesting career.
it wasn't Danny who fired his weapon last night.
look, I got 20 witnesses from that bar who saw Sergeant Messer get in a fight with Pete Miller.
I got no evidence of the victim's friends and no gun.
I told you I would find the gun.
Yeah, you want to help those cops and your friend? You got to do better.
you got to put that gun in Pete Miller's hand.
all right...
what do these have in common? - Nymph flies.
what, how did you know that?
daddy used to take me fishing all the time.
nymph flies were designed to sink in the water and attract the fish that all the other fish want to eat for lunch.
rooster feathers.
what, am I the only one that doesn't know about this?
do you know that they're genetically bred to look this way?
I mean, their fibers are so fine that I mistook it for a hair.
I mean, take a look at this --- the red and the gold.
resembles the trace we found on Pete Miller's shirt and from the suspect at Far Rockaway.
it's a proprietary Spey hackle grown at Wickfield Farms upstate.
now, they produce only 100 of these roosters with this type of coloring a year.
they must keep very good records.
well, looks like I'm going on a fishing expedition.
do that again.
uh, okay.
looks like I'm going on a fishing expedition.
according to your statement, Pete Miller aimed a . 38 at you, fired once.
show me how he held the gun.
what's the point here, Detective?
the point is, your client's lying.
what are you talking about?
when you fire a gun, Officer Cooper, it emits microscopic particles.
Yeah, gunshot residue.
the particles land on the shooter's hand, arm, clothing.
according to your lab and a field test at the crime scene, there was GSR on the victim's hand as well as the left arm of his shirt.
well, that's the problem.
the pattern of the residue is from the cuff to the shoulder.
there's no GSR on the victim's wrist or forearm.
so?
so when you lift your arm to fire a gun, your shirt slides back.
Pete Miller didn't fire the gun.
he was standing next to the guy who did.
it was an accident.
I was aiming for the shooter. It was a good shoot.
don't say anything else.
if it was a good shoot, you wouldn't have lied about how it went down.
I wanted to tell the truth.
then why didn't you?
I was told not to. - By who?
it wasn't his fault. He was trying to protect me.
who told you to lie?
sergeant Messer.
we got the video surveillance from Rattigans. You want to take a look?
I don't know about you, but, uh, to me...
you and Officer Cooper look very close.
and, um, this part here, too -- again, just to me, that doesn't look like you throwing a drunk out of a bar.
that looks like a fight over a girl.
why do you have me back here?
to talk about your relationship with Officer Cooper.
she's my driver.
according to your other officers, you've taken her under your wing.
spending a little extra time getting to know her...
I mean, I'm married.
yet at the end of your shift, you don't go home.
you go out with Officer Cooper. - Yeah, and two other cops.
there's rules against dating a subordinate.
are you kidding me?
just... just ask me the question. Go ahead.
are you having an affair with Officer Cooper?
why don't you take a walk? - That's not a no.
well, I'm done answering your questions. Thank you.
sit down, Sergeant.
this isn't a criminal investigation. This is an Internal Affairs investigation.
I'm your superior, and you're compelled to answer all my questions, even the ones you don't like.
Pete Miller -- that kid -- he was inappropriate in that bar, okay?
here, I'll sit down.
and my relationship with Officer Cooper is not.
yet later that night you get in a fight and this man -- this unarmed man -- is killed.
she saw a gun.
but she shot the wrong man, and then she lied about it.
I don't know why she did that.
because you told her to.
you came to that night, realized this dead man on the ground was unarmed, shot by an officer that you may or may not be sleeping with.
it looked bad, it had to look better, so you told her to lie about it.
it's not true.
I'm done with the personal questions.
the ones I'm about to ask, I can't compel you to answer.
in fact, I'm gonna inform you of your rights.
Hey, what does this look like to you?
the stones Sid pulled from Pete Miller's stomach.
found traces of cinnamon, peppermint and absinthe.
which Adam also found on Pete Miller's shirt.
so Pete had two friends with him when they attacked Danny and the other cops.
and one of them is our shooter from Far Rockaway.
and by all accounts, they were as drunk as Pete was.
okay, so maybe they were drinking absinthe earlier in the evening.
Yes. If we can just figure out where, it could lead us to the Rockaway suspect.
shooting vic came into Queen of Mercy E. R. this morning.
class characteristics of the round removed from the wound is a match to the missing gun.
so our Rockaway shooter struck again.
on my way to the subway this morning, out of nowhere, someone shoots me.
must have been a stray.
didn't call 911?
I only live a couple blocks away.
so what, you hopped here?
E. R. doc said you lost 20% of your blood volume when you were admitted.
wound like yours, slow bleeder.
probably took hours to lose that kind of blood.
they can't tell you that. That's my private medical records.
this is not a kidney stone we're talking about.
all gunshot wounds get reported to the police.
you weren't shot this morning. You were shot two nights ago.
after your involvement in a brawl outside Rattigans.
a cop was shot at that night.
you can talk to us now, or we can have you transferred to the medical ward at Rikers.
where I guarantee you the nurses are not as cute.
Pete and I grew up together. He always had my back.
blah, blah, blah. What were you doing at that bar?
Pete called. He said some jackass was giving him trouble at the bar.
it's not even a question, I'm there for my friend.
you went looking for a fight.
a fistfight. Blow off a little steam.
I didn't know that lunatic would bring a gun.
who, Pete?
I don't know his last name. Pete worked with him.
they were out drinking earlier that night.
Travis got into an argument with his girl. She dumped him.
so he was itching to mix it up.
except when the fists start flying, Travis just stands there.
next thing you know, shots are fired, and I'm hauling ass up the street with Travis right behind me.
so much for your good friend, Pete.
I didn't know he wasn't behind us till we were ten blocks away.
Where's Pete?
didn't make it.
did he get hurt? We got to go back and get him.
that's not happening.
he told me to keep my mouth shut or he'd kill me.
by the look in his eye, I believed him.
our suspect's name is Travis Moss.
he worked with Pete Miller as a housepainter, but hasn't had a job in months.
according to Ray James, he got dumped by his girlfriend, too.
and now he's used that gun three times in two days.
Yeah, first time, fired wild outside the bar. Second time, shot Ray James in the leg.
third time, he killed a man.
he going for number four?
landlord says he hadn't been home in a couple of days.
we pulled his financials.
credit cards are all maxed out.
he got 72 cents in the bank account.
all factors suggest he has nothing to lose.
far Rockaway shooting was yesterday. He hasn't made a move since.
if he was looking for a random victim, he would have struck again by now.
what if he's holding out for someone specific?
someone he's got a beef with.
travis's girlfriend broke up with him a few hours before the fight in the bar.
what do we know about this woman?
all we know -- her name is Crystal, and she's some kind of dancer.
mac, can I talk to you? - Yeah.
I just found out they're putting Danny on modified assignment.
it's part of procedure, Lindsay. It doesn't mean anything.
but there's going to be a hearing, and maybe even criminal charges.
this is like a natural disaster, Mac.
you see it coming, and you can't do anything to stop it.
Yeah, I know it feels like that now, but there's a long road to go before anything's decided here.
Danny's career is on the line, and I don't even know why.
he didn't do anything wrong.
I know.
so what are we going to do about it?
spoke to Wickfield Farms.
their entire line of Speckle Hackles went to one buyer this year, and it wasn't a tackle shop.
it's a boutique that specializes in custom clothing for dancers.
I'm listening.
this boutique gets a lot of business from a place called Latrec.
all right, it's some kind of -- mmm -- high-end strip club.
it's not a strip club, Adam; it's a burlesque club.
whatever it is, uh, they got in trouble last year from the liquor authority.
accused of putting illegal absinthe in specialty cocktails.
maybe that's where Pete and Travis drank before they came to Rattigans.
seems a little upscale for a couple of unemployed housepainters.
unless they get the benefits of the employee discount.
Oh, my.
they weren't there for the atmosphere.
they were there for Travis's girlfriend, Crystal.
give it up for Mercedes.
and now coming to the stage is the magnificent Crystal.
drop the gun, Travis!
put the gun down!
drop it now!
drop it!
turn around.
it's hard to pull a weapon on someone, right? Squeeze that trigger?
I'm sorry. If you're a reporter, I got nothing to say.
you know what else is hard? Sharing a squad car with somebody every day and stabbing him in the back when he had yours.
who are you?
I'm Lindsay Messer.
I can't talk to you. - No, it can't be easy actually facing me.
no, I'm telling you that we can't speak. - I mean, you know what you're doing affects my family, but it's much easier when we're out of sight.
I'm not supposed to have any interaction... - Like saying you're in a relationship with my husband.
Hey, that's not true. - I know it's not true.
I don't even know why they're suggesting that.
so you're only comfortable with some of the lies?
I'm not lying.
so Danny told you to say that Pete Miller was holding the gun?
not in so many words. - How many words does it take?
suggested...
it... it was how he put things.
what things?
I don't have to explain myself to you.
no, you don't. You know why? I get this.
this is self-preservation, plain and simple.
no, you don't understand... - No, you think about this, Lauren.
if the roles were reversed and Danny was in your shoes, you really think that he'd be looking out for number one?
none of this was my choice.
from the moment that I pulled that trigger, it was all out of my hands.
I always wanted to tell the truth.
so look me in the eye, Lauren. Right now.
it's just the two of us.
tell me that Danny Messer told you to lie.
what are you doing here?
thought maybe you could use some support.
it's no big deal. He's going to come in.
give him my weapon, give him my shield.
temporarily. You'll get them back.
Yeah, if... if I'm cleared.
can't believe this, Mac.
you know, I figured I could be a good boss, to guide these cops, help them avoid the mistakes I made.
the last time you dealt with Internal Affairs, I called you into my office.
you remember?
Yeah, I remember.
they decided not to investigate me on the shooting in the subway, thanks to you.
you brought me into your office, you ripped me a new one for my recklessness-- which I deserved.
you're not the same cop as then. You've grown.
you're an excellent boss, Danny.
if you were my sergeant, I'd follow you anywhere, and that's what I intend to tell Adler when he walks in here.
detective Taylor. Sergeant Messer.
all right. How do we do this? Here, in your office, what?
we don't do it at all.
officer Cooper just retracted her statement.
she took full responsibility for lying about who had the gun outside the bar.
you're cleared, Sergeant Messer.
what about Cooper?
well, she's done.
so are Cates and Foley if you're interested -- terminated.
but you can return to normal duty. Effective immediately.
good luck. - Thank you.
I can, uh... return to normal duty.
you're not relieved.
of... I mean, of course I am. I am.
but I can't stop thinking, Mac, how I treated these cops like they were my family, and they didn't think twice about throwing me to the wolves.
I've been doing this job way too long.
I got to work with people I can trust.
two weeks later - Just finished with Chief Sinclair. - And?
that's it. It's done.
no more Sergeant Messer.
just a... plain old detective.
does that mean I don't have to salute you in the morning anymore?
I still need you to do that.
you feel all right?
I mean, it wasn't easy giving up the stripes, you know.
it's the right move, Danny.
this is where I belong.
John Curtis raped another woman.
he's in New York.
the victim walked into Flack's precinct, he took the report and then he recognized Curtis as your old D. C. rape case.
who was she, the victim?
her name is Ali Rand.
I remember you telling me how, in D. C. your colleague made a mistake in the first round of DNA testing and then destroyed the documentation.
you don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna screw this up.
I know how important this is to you.
this case eats away at me.
Serena Matthews, the senator's daughter...you were innocent of that, right?
your DNA was planted on her underwear?
I was acquitted.
you didn't think she'd report it, so you told her your name.
I got nothing to say about this.
you want to railroad me, talk to my lawyer.
what are we gonna do?
calm down. Just calm down, okay?
it was an accident.
we should just go to the police.
are you crazy? He's your ex-boyfriend.
people saw me threaten him at the party.
he came at you!
you were defending yourself!
I'll go with you.
and tell them what?
that-that he attacked me? That I was defending myself?
you think they're gonna believe somebody like me?
I'll tell them what happened.
get back here!
criminal court judge assassinated in front of a sequestered jury, right under the nose of a half a dozen cops.
brazen son of a bitch.
jury asked to come out to take a look at the crime scene the same time of night as the original murder.
this is Judge Vinny Corsica, huh?
he was presiding over the Victor Markov trial.
triple murder in front of this bakery a year ago.
he's like the Sammy the Bull of Russian organized crime.
that's why we got a dozen bodies on him.
looks like it just went to a baker's dozen.
shooter was kind enough to leave two casings behind.
the round I pulled out of the window...smashed beyond recognition, probably useless.
I recovered four casings from the detective's gun.
the witnesses all had him firing a four-round burst in rapid succession.
from that distance, this is a pretty tight grouping.
looks like you're missing a bullet.
I'm thinking maybe it's in our ride-by shooter.
witnesses said the bicycle went down the alley.
maybe there's a blood trail.
Hey, so what do you think of this fancy getaway vehicle?
doesn't exactly seem like the expected mode of travel for a Russian hit man.
well, the judge had a 24/7 protection detail cause of death threats, street was closed off to cars, so this was a good way of getting close enough to shoot him.
guess it was no secret he was visiting the crime scene tonight.
it was all over the news.
I'm missing a bullet. I'm thinking maybe it's in our shooter.
if you're looking for a blood trail, you're not gonna find one.
the only description we have is of a guy on a bike with a hoodie and a backpack.
not one of those people on the street could I. D. the shooter.
this broken glass is from a car headlight.
maybe the guy who was driving the car that hit this bike man.
as the mayor and commissioner have already stated, the assassination of a Criminal Court judge is an attack on our system of justice, and will not stand.
we'll use every resource available to track down those people responsible and make sure they know how powerful our system of justice is.
detective Taylor, do you believe Victor Markov ordered the hit?
I'm not going to throw Mr. Markov's name around till we've had time to analyze the evidence.
I can tell you that we will be looking into all of Judge Corsica's cases.
are you saying Mr. Markov may not be behind it?
no, I'm saying, uh, let us investigate so that we can give you some answers based on fact, not speculation. That's all for now. We got a lot of work to do.
detective, can you give us an update on John Curtis, the D. C. rapist?
uh, he'll be in court tomorrow morning for a preliminary hearing.
what about the evidence?
do you think you have a good case?
this is an ongoing investigation.
you know I can't discuss the evidence.
any comment on your number two, Jo Danville, dropping the ball on the original D. C. rape case?
the FBI lab tech who mishandled the evidence blew the case.
as for Jo Danville, I'll take her courage and integrity over official misconduct every time.
has she been excluded from the New York case because of political pressure from Senator Matthews?
the decisions I make have nothing to do with political pressure from anyone.
I do what's best for the case.
and what's best in this case is Jo Danville sits this one out.
John Curtis, you got a visitor.
what are you doing here?
you know you can't talk to me without my attorney.
you won't need your attorney for what I have to say.
well, I'm pretty sure this isn't a social visit.
so what?
did you come here to gloat?
I wish I could gloat.
I wish I could take great pleasure in seeing you sit here in this cell.
but that would be at the expense of Ali Rand and the horrible way you made her suffer.
my pleasure will have to wait until I hear the guilty verdict read at your trial.
I wouldn't be so quick to convict me...just yet.
you were a free man.
makes me sick to my stomach to think that my integrity and my conviction gave you that second chance.
I came here to make you a promise.
you will not walk away this time.
I think you're gonna be disappointed, sweetheart.
I don't think this is gonna turn out the way you want it to.
Oh... the people I work with are very good at what they do.
there'll be no mistakes this time.
I'll make a promise to you.
you put that bitch on the stand, your case will fall apart faster than your career did in the FBI.
don't count on Ali Rand.
I'll see you in court, Mr. Curtis.
nothing's ever easy.
I've seen you put a slug together with less.
that must have caused some serious damage.
the bullet hit the sixth rib on the right side, sending fragments in three different directions.
this one ruptured the aorta, killing him almost instantly.
this one, in the kidney, though nonfatal, is most revealing.
in examining the judge's kidney, I discovered something very surprising.
take a look at this tissue sample.
calcium oxalate crystals?
in both kidneys.
he ingested antifreeze?
how long ago?
his medical records say he missed a couple of days of work with a bout of food poisoning three weeks ago.
I'm betting his symptoms were caused by ingesting ethylene glycol.
so this shooting wasn't the first attempt on Judge Corsica's life.
someone tried to poison him.
attempted poisoning with antifreeze is simple and is easily mixed in with a sweet drink, but it doesn't exactly scream Russian assassin.
polonium or ricin, maybe.
I never heard of a Russian hit man doing a drive-by on a bicycle.
I'm betting the poisoning and the shooting are related.
we have the bullet that killed the judge, now find me the gun and the man that fired it.
done.
he'll come in and talk to you guys.
mac, this is Senator Matthews.
senator.
I apologize if I kept you waiting.
this is his daughter Serena.
hello.
I saw your press conference this morning.
the assassination of a judge is no small thing.
you've got a lot on your plate.
hope it's not too much.
always have a lot on my plate.
that's the nature of the business.
detective Messer's men pulled off the Corsica case to handle the Curtis investigation.
I've seen this animal walk away from what he's done once before.
I will not tolerate any dragging of the feet on this.
no one in this lab knows how to drag their feet.
this is an active investigation and will be treated with the same priority as any other.
Lindsay can update you, but we won't be able to give you any specifics that could compromise the investigation.
well, I can tell you that our victim's story is corroborated by the preliminary evidence.
she was drugged, taken to a hotel, and then beaten and raped, in much the same manner as your daughter and the other women in the Washington DC cases.
how is she doing?
as well as can be expected.
but, like you, she's very brave and she's eager to testify.
I don't want her anywhere near this thing.
I already made that call.
but I want you to know it has nothing to do with Jo Danville's abilities.
if my daughter were attacked, I'd want her investigating the case.
look who it is.
where you been?
visiting an old friend. Catch me up.
all right. I pulled some partial prints off the bike.
nothing usable. But I found food residue on the basket.
so I'm gonna guess that it was used to make food deliveries before it was used to do the ride-by.
Also...the paint transfer on the bike came from a Gray 2011 Audi A4 or A6.
Flack's got his guys running around to the body shops in the area, see if anyone came in with front end damage this morning.
okay, you've been busy.
if Victor Markov is behind this, his hit man got a little sloppy.
I reassembled the bullet fragments Sid pulled out of the judge.
baikal IJ-70, the Russian equivalent of our . 45.
we don't see too many of these come in through the lab.
or the 9. 1 millimeter round it fires.
I got no hit in IBIS, and the serial number on the gun is not in any of our databases.
that'd mean it was brought in straight from Russia.
so how is that sloppy?
well, I pulled a print off one of the casings left at the scene.
ex-russian military. U. S. citizen.
been in the country for eight years.
no apparent ties to Victor Markov.
he works as a translator for an insurance company.
probably a front for his real job.
we're about to find out.
I got a home address in Brighton Beach.
Flack's paying Mr. Barshay a visit now.
Vitale Barshay, NYPD!
Flack, we have a vehicle approaching!
get your hands where I can see 'em!
Barshay, get out with your hands up!
get 'em out of the car!
we're gonna need Crime Scene.
just got back from a ten-day trip to Disney World.
wife says they had the place cleaned the day after they left.
cleaning lady has the key.
Yeah, I'm getting nothing.
in addition to the place being cleaned, I'm pretty sure our guy wore gloves.
Mr. Barshay said he kept a gun, some cash and other valuables in the safe.
he swears that he and his wife were the only ones who knew it was here.
that safe was well-hidden.
took some know-how to break into it.
this isn't some neighborhood kid.
we're looking for an experienced burglar.
hard to buy a professional thief moonlighting as a hit man.
he may have fenced a stolen gun.
that gun might lead to our killer.
Hey, guys, look what I found.
he's got something.
somebody left a doggie bag in the trash bin outside.
if that's what I think that is, don't open that in here.
it's not that kind of doggie bag, Flack.
you said that they had the place cleaned the day after they left, right?
found some crumbs on the table.
I'm thinking somebody made themselves, yeah, a snack.
no mold or microbial activity.
hasn't been in there more than a couple days.
that rules out the Barshays and the cleaning lady.
let's hope it gets us one step closer to the guy who put a bullet in the judge.
Hey, what are you doing up here, kid?
just picking up the final lab results for the Ali Rand rape case.
how's that going? - Good.
I just want to go over everything one last time before the hearing tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises up there on the stand.
no, you're going to be good.
Thanks.
these aren't like cop cars anymore, they're like spaceships.
Yep.
this one was part of the escort out at the crime scene last night.
it's got three cameras mounted on the light rack.
it takes 3, 000 plate images per hour.
Yeah, the plates get run through the criminal database and the images are stored in the hard drive, and if we're lucky, that Audi we're looking for had its picture taken before the shooting went down last night.
the Audi I matched to the bike may be in this computer.
Serena, what are you doing here?
my father's upstairs in the D. A.'s office throwing his weight around.
I was hoping I'd have a chance to talk to you.
I wanted to apologize.
you don't owe me an apology.
no, I...I do.
please just hear me out.
you know, for a while, I was angry at what you did.
it took me some time to get past that and realize how difficult it must have been for you, as a woman, and as a mom, to watch that monster walk away from what he did to me.
not about me, Serena.
it is about you. It's not fair that your life was turned upside-down because of it.
my father is an emotional guy.
he had no right to force you out of the FBI.
you know, I'm not so sure I wouldn't have done exactly what your dad did on behalf of one of my own children.
I don't regret my actions.
I do regret that my actions set John Curtis free and what that did to you and your dad but...
I don't, I don't sleep nights any more since he was let go.
I know that it's stupid and irrational, but I just have this fear that he's going to come after me again.
it's not stupid.
you suffered a traumatic experience.
it is highly unlikely that he will come anywhere near you.
I came because I need to see it.
I need to be in that courtroom and see him in handcuffs being taken off to jail.
Serena... What are you doing?
we're meeting the mayor for dinner. We gotta go.
Thanks, Jo.
take care of yourself.
quite a young lady you've got there.
Yes, she is.
okay, what do we know?
might have a line on the murder weapon.
Hawkes is trying to get a usable DNA profile off the sandwich we recovered from the burglary scene.
wait a second, the guy who broke in the house made a sandwich?
what?
your little visit to Mr. Curtis wasn't a very good idea.
I hope you got whatever it was you had to say off your chest.
I did.
thanks for not making a big deal about it.
Hey, I found that gray Audi that hit the bike, and I'll tell you, this is no accidental hit and run.
this guy is no witness.
one of Markov's goons rented that gray Audi two weeks ago.
collars for assault, possession of a weapon.
that car picked up three parking tickets in the last two days on the same block on the West Side.
unis found the car sitting there and they're waiting on us to come over.
well, you better get out there.
here we go.
all right, that's Danshov.
get your hands on the car now!
Hey, what's going on? - Put your hands on the car now!
now, hands on the car!
put your hands on the car now!
what's going on? You boys want to go for a ride with me?
what is this here? - Don't move. Shut up!
how you doing, Pavel?
not so good.
looks like I got another parking ticket.
I think that's gonna be the least of your problems.
everything all right, Jo?
Yeah, everything's great.
you said the bike was used for deliveries, so I'd imagine driving around the city, you'd get a bunch of flats.
right, and-and in order to fix those flats, you'd have to patch the inner tube, which may leave a print behind.
Jo...I don't care what everybody says around here, you're good.
well, let's see how good you are. Do your thing and get me a good print.
tell me about the guy on the bike.
he is a bad driver.
so you don't deny hitting him?
well, I was drinking a cup of coffee.
I looked away for a second, and then, boom!
I heard shots.
I took off down 7th, and halfway down the block, ka-boom.
he got up, and ran off.
did you get a good look at his face?
I got a good look at my fender.
and you had nothing to do with those shots that were fired?
a dead judge is bad for business.
a crooked judge is much better.
so you were just out there following the judge, trying to dig up dirt on him so your boss could blackmail him?
blackmail him?
I prefer "negotiate with him." And let's say, your friend the judge...
he might not be so squeaking clean as you think.
Squeaky. Squeaky clean.
what do you mean?
well, he makes salary of $175, 000.
he has condo on Park Avenue, house in the Hamptons and Key West.
he eats at Stradello's Steakhouse four nights a week.
has driver on call.
two daughters at Ivy League university, and a wife who doesn't work but loves to shop.
so if we believe Danshov, he was out there trying to dig up dirt on Corsica, to affect the outcome of the trial by blackmailing him.
Yep. And Danshov hinted there might be some dirt.
if that's true, it could help explain Corsica's extravagant lifestyle.
I'll take a closer look at the judge's finances.
this might not be about Markov at all.
take a look at all of his cases, too.
he put a lot of people away for a very long time.
there could be an old grudge.
so I got a beautiful three-dimensional plastic print off the patch on the inner tube.
and a hit in AFIS to go along with it.
he's 22 years old, he's been in and out of jail for the last eight years.
he's got one felony assault, at age 15.
and since then, drug possession weed, mostly discon, and resisting arrest.
not exactly the resume of a killer.
a print on a bike that might be stolen isn't enough for a search warrant.
no active bench warrants. In fact, no arrests in the past year.
parole says he's been holding a steady job as a busboy delivery man at Stradello's Steakhouse.
Danshov told me that Corsica was a regular at that same place.
that would give Albertson an opportunity to poison the judge.
and when that didn't work, he shot him...
but why?
could be a connection to one of Albertson's past convictions.
Otherwise...why would he want the judge dead?
let's go ask Nick Albertson.
all units to 34th Street and Grand.
Flack, he's coming your way!
hold it right there!
down!
I know this may not be the best time, but is the porterhouse as good here as everybody says it is?
so, Nick...your bike was found lying in the street around the corner from where the judge was murdered, around the time the judge was murdered, by a guy on a bicycle who looks just like you.
Oh, you got me.
I'm the guy who was riding his bike down 7th last night and got hit by a car.
so tell me...what kind of time am I looking at? - You done?
look, whatever you think I did, you got the wrong guy.
wrong guys don't run.
I don't like cops.
they come through the door looking for me, I run.
I think you had a good reason to run.
you're leaving out the part of your story where you killed the judge in front of that bakery last night.
you want to hear an amazing coincidence?
this is crazy.
judge Corsica was a regular at the steakhouse you work at.
we got a lot of regular customers.
but this one ate there a few weeks back, got sick, thought it was food poisoning.
it turns out somebody spiked his drink with antifreeze.
I don't know nothing about that.
why did you do it, Nick?
why did you want the judge dead?
okay. I give up.
it was that cheap cologne.
that's what did it...
I mean, I couldn't take it anymore.
every time, busing that guy's table with that same horrible stench.
you think this is a joke?
I think this whole thing is a joke.
So...you were out there last night.
but you didn't do nothing.
you didn't shoot nobody, you didn't see or hear anybody shoot anybody.
that's your story?
that's what you're going with, Nick?
that's what I'm going with.
Danshov was parked here.
with a perfect line of sight to the crime scene...here.
all the witnesses have the shooter coming this way, firing the shots...
and then heading down Majestic Alley.
but Albertson says he was coming in the opposite direction, turned south on 7th, and was struck when he jumped through two parked cars, right here.
and the driver's side of Danshov's fender confirms that.
but if Albertson came down this alley, after shooting the judge, dumped out onto 7th, then...
how'd he get hit on the driver's side?
but he didn't.
none of this makes sense.
eight years ago, Judge Corsica was hearing Juvenile Court cases.
he sentenced Nick Albertson on that shoplifting charge when he was just 14.
a shoplifting arrest from that far back seems like a stretch for a motive.
it was listed on his rap sheet, it's listed in our NYPD computer system...
it is not listed in the Criminal Court computer system.
someone erased it.
I had to go down to the basement of the courthouse, and pull the original paper file.
kid stole a pack of gum from a bodega?
it was his first offense.
prosecutor recommends two weeks of community service.
so why would Corsica sentence Nick to three months at Forest Brook Juvenile Camp?
Nick Albertson was the lookout at the bodega.
this...Is Tommy Hill.
he was the co-defendant in the shoplifting case.
like Nick, no prior arrest, his prosecutor recommended community service.
he got six months at Forest Brook.
his case wasn't in the court computer, either, was it?
you are catching on fast.
there's something so much bigger here at play, Mac, than a couple of harsh sentences handed out, because in 2003, a couple of weeks before these kids were supposed to go to Forest Brook, the place was in financial ruin.
so this guy, James Nelson, swoops in and buys it on the cheap.
most of these camps are privately owned, for-profit operations.
the state pays a fee for every kid sent there.
Yes, a very generous fee.
so for the two years after Nelson buys it,
judge Corsica sends twice as many kids to Forest Brook than any other Juvenile Court judge.
more kids, more money.
so your theory is, Corsica gets kickbacks to boost enrollment at Forest Brook on behalf of James Nelson.
there's no record of any of these cases in the Criminal Court computer system.
somebody was trying to cover their tracks.
an appointment to the Criminal Court would mean a thorough vetting of Corsica's entire judicial career.
Nick Albertson should have never gone to a place like Forest Brook.
and it turns out a lot of other kids suffered the same fate.
gives him motive.
but how would a kid like Nick get access to those records, and that kind of information?
you rang?
Yes, I did.
I was able to extract a usable profile from the remnants of the sandwich...
it isn't perfect, and some of the thresholds are questionable...
but I think we have our burglar.
you didn't just find our burglar, Sheldon, I think you just found our killer.
don't do anything stupid, all right?
don't move. Don't move.
got him? - Yeah, I got him.
what do we got?
bullet hole...
bullet impact mark...
burglary starter kit...
gun...
Lindsay's missing bullet.
and our murder weapon.
Mr. Hill, you've been through the system before; you know how this works.
save your breath, pal.
I did it.
I put a bullet in that son of a bitch, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
how did you know, Tommy? How'd you find out what the judge did to you and Nick?
I got Tommy a job at the steakhouse a few weeks ago.
busing tables, doing deliveries...
I was trying to help him.
right.
it was his second night.
the judge was a regular, and...
I'd bused his tables before, but this was the first time I saw Nelson.
nelson is the warden from Forest Brook.
and they were together at the same table.
you got something on your mind, son?
no, sir. I just...
thought you looked like someone.
I look like someone what?
nothing.
it was my mistake.
well, then, wipe that stupid look off your face, and go tell the waitress this gentleman needs another Manhattan.
Yes, sir.
Nick came into the kitchen and told me, so I went to see for myself.
you know who that little piece of garbage is, now.
come on, think.
how the hell would I know the busboy?
he helped you pay for that boat you have sitting at the marina.
well, that narrows it down to a couple of thousand kids.
Nick Albertson. Real pretty mother.
she hired the attorney that was snooping around his case when we first started out, remember?
I mean, she almost blew up the whole thing.
Oh, yeah. How the hell could I forget that?
it cost us 1, 500 bucks to get that ambulance chaser to go away.
that was money well spent.
made us much more careful who we do our business with.
we always knew something was up.
but once Tommy heard those guys talking, it didn't take a genius to figure out what they were doing at Forest Brook.
so you and Tommy went to get a little payback.
I couldn't let it go.
Nick wanted to go to the cops. I laughed at him. I told him it was crazy.
I mean, who are the cops gonna believe?
couple guys like us...
or a judge?
so you poured antifreeze into his drink?
I didn't even know what the hell I was doing.
I just heard it could kill him if he drank it.
then when that failed, you decided to shoot him.
Nick... he tried to talk me out of it.
he really did.
even came to my place to try to stop me.
you cannot do this!
let go of me, Nick.
come on, man, this is my chance.
that son of a bitch is gonna be out there like a sitting duck.
then let it go, Tommy, okay?
he's gonna have a whole bunch of protection, and you're just gonna get yourself killed.
Tommy, you do not have to do this.
I said let go!
I tried to get there. Okay? I tried to stop him.
I was coming down 45th and I saw the flashes and I heard the shots.
I saw him go down the alley, and I went down 7th to try to catch up with him.
you know what happens to good kids in a place like Forest Brook?
they turn bad real fast, or they get eaten alive.
when the judge remanded me to Forest Brook,
I looked around the courtroom to see if there was another Nick Albertson.
I was waiting for someone to stand up and say there'd been some mistake.
but... nobody did. So, I went away...
three months.
and I get in a fight over my sneakers, and I mess a kid up, and they call it assault.
I got 12 more months.
I had a good life.
I just made the JV baseball team.
I was gonna be the starting shortstop.
I had a new glove sitting on my dresser.
and all that was taken away from me.
it's too late for me! I'm too, I'm too far gone!
but that man stole my life away from me.
I think it's only fair that I took his!
you don't get to make that choice.
there's a system of justice.
what's gonna happen to that bastard Nelson?
cause I would've got him too.
the police commissioner is expected to step to the podium at any moment.
sources within the NYPD are reporting two men have been arrested in connection with the shooting death of Judge Vincent Corsica.
the suspects have been identified as Brooklyn residents Nicholas Albertson and Thomas Hill, both 22 years old.
James Nelson! NYPD! Open up!
...of Russian organized crime figure Victor Markov and may date back to Mr. Corsica's days as a Juvenile Court judge.
one of the witnesses interviewed at the sc...
Mr. Nelson, it's the police.
open the door.
go!
what's up?
Hey, I need your help, Don.
I need to talk to Ali Rand again.
I have some concerns about the hearing tomorrow.
what kind of concerns?
like, character stuff, because of the escort thing?
no, science stuff.
her tox report came back, and she had GHB in her system.
the date rape drug.
that's what this guy does, right?
right, but...
the levels of GHB in her blood are not consistent with the timeline that she told me.
so, what, you're saying you think it might be a problem that she doesn't remember what time she got raped?
she was drugged.
and beat up pretty bad.
I'm saying I need to talk to her again.
why are we doing this again?
I already told you everything that happened.
is something wrong?
you don't believe me, do you?
I knew this was gonna happen. I'm so stupid.
calm down, Ali. I believe you, okay?
I just have a few questions I need to ask you to clear something up before the hearing tomorrow, okay?
of course. I'm sorry.
it's really important that you tell us the truth.
you can't leave out even the smallest detail. Do you understand?
do you use drugs, prescription or otherwise?
uh, I-I drink mostly, I smoke weed every now and then, but that's it.
and have you ever tried a drug called GHB?
isn't that what John Curtis put in my drink?
Yes, but I mean other than that.
no. Never.
and did you have anything at all to eat or drink between the time you woke up from the attack and the time you came into the precinct to report it?
no. I had a bottle of water from a newsstand.
you're sure about what time you started feeling drugged at the bar?
Yes. I'm positive.
I know what time I was there.
okay. Thank you, Ali.
that's it? You don't have to ask me anything else?
is everything okay?
everything's fine.
you take care of yourself, okay?
I'll see you at the hearing tomorrow.
are you sure?
I'll see you tomorrow.
think she's lying about the drugs?
it's not what I think, it's what the science says.
what are you going to do about the hearing tomorrow?
I'm gonna tell the truth.
based on what she just told us, the levels of GHB in her blood...
they're not improbable.
they're impossible.
so, based on the cognitive state of the victim before, during and after the alleged attack, what quantity of GHB would you estimate she ingested?
well, it's not exact, but I would say approximately 100 milligrams.
your reports indicate you collected blood samples from Miss R and ten hours after she alleges the defendant drugged her.
that's correct.
and what levels of GHB do your reports indicate were present in her system at that time?
two milligrams per kilogram.
am I correct when I say that a 100 milligram dose of GHB is eliminated from the blood within about four to six hours?
Yes.
am I also correct to say that half the amount of GHB is eliminated from the blood every 30 minutes?
the half-life of GHB is generally 30 minutes.
then, based on that math, what amount of GHB would Miss Rand have ingested for a two-milligrams- per-kilogram concentration to remain in her system ten hours after the alleged incident?
1, 000 milligrams.
1, 000 milligrams.
that's ten times the dosage you described.
please tell the court the expected dose-related effect on a person who's ingested 1, 000 milligrams of GHB.
death. - Death?
so either your test is wrong, your report is wrong, or Miss Rand is wrong and is lying about when she was drugged, or even if she was drugged because, as we can all see, she is most certainly still alive.
your Honor.
thank you, Detective Messer.
Mr. Curtis, please stand.
the purpose of this preliminary hearing today was to determine if there is probable cause for the State to continue with the case pending against you.
and based on the evidence we've heard from the witnesses here this morning, it is my opinion that there is more than sufficient evidence to merit those charges.
the defense request for a dismissal of all charges is denied.
unfortunately, some of the testimony we've heard here this morning is cause for concern, and raises grave questions as to the credibility of the victim.
I find these discrepancies troubling enough that I have been moved to grant defense counsel's request for a reduced bail from $500, 000 down to the sum of $25, 000.
this court is adjourned.
we'll see everyone back here on the eighth of January.
John Curtis raped another woman.
he's in New York.
the victim walked into Flack's precinct, he took the report, and then he recognized Curtis as your old DC rape case.
who was she, the victim?
in DC, your colleague made a mistake in the first round of DNA testing and then destroyed the documentation, when you knew thatJohn Curtis was your guy.
Serena Matthews, the senator's daughter.
your DNA was planted on her underwear?
I was acquitted.
I came here to make you a promise.
you will not walk away this time.
you put that bitch on the stand, your case'll fall apart faster than your career did in the FBI.
you don't believe me, do you?
please tell the court the expected dose-related effect on a person who's ingested 1, 000 milligrams of GHB.
death.
so either your test is wrong, or Miss Rand is lying.
48 hours earlier
Mr. Curtis, please stand.
some of the testimony we've heard here today is cause for concern and raises serious questions as to the credibility of the victim.
I have been moved to grant defense counsel's request for a reduced bail down to the sum of $25, 000.
this court is adjourned.
we'll see everyone back here on the eighth of January.
late-breaking news today as John Curtis, the man commonly referred to as the "DC Rapist," will be releasedon $25, 000 bail.
this dramatic turn of events occurred after the judge heard surprising testimony from the New York Crime Lab suggesting levels of GHB in the alleged victim's system were inconsistentwith her statements.
there's no word yet as to whether the Manhattan D. A. will pursue the case further.
what happened?
Serena, it's okay.
that girl Lindsay who works with you...
I thought she was on our side.
she had to tell the truth.
the truth is that Curtis raped that girl and... they just let him go.
again.
all this means is that he's been released on bail. There's a difference.
not to me.
we're gonna get him.
how can you possibly say that?
because there are a lot of good people who still want to see this guy behind bars.
what, your associate on the stand up there? You?
I have seen John Curtis walk out of a courtroom, a free man, twice.
both times you were there.
I'm not involved in this case, Senator, as you know.
and yet, somehow it fell apart.
dad, let's just go.
my daughter already paid her price. Nothing can change that.
this is about all the other daughters that had to suffer since you let Curtis go the first time.
come on.
3 years ago washingto dc
senator Matthews, I'm Jo Danville. This is my associate.
Frank Waters, FBI Crime Lab.
Yes, I know. I requested you.
can you tell us what happened? We've been told very little.
my daughter, uh, was attacked tonight.
she came home beaten, half drugged.
you take her to the hospital?
of course not. There can't be any press, no news conferences.
my daughter has got to be protected.
that's why I avoided the DC police.
Where's your daughter now?
they're here.
look what he did to my little girl.
you know you can't be doing that.
you shouldn't even be within ten feet of that evidence.
John Curtis is posting bail as we speak.
I can't sit back and watch this case fall apart.
the case isn't yours, Jo. It's Lindsay's.
she'll be the one to go back over the evidence. And you should get some distance.
you know John Curtis is not just another bad guy to me.
I can't pretend this is business as usual.
Yeah, I get that, it's personal. All the more reason why you should step away.
nobody knows this guy better than me.
I spent 11 months in DC on this case. Of course it's personal.
but you know I can help this case.
why don't you look over the evidence from the DC rapes.
could be a detail that'll help us here.
thank you.
Danny works with you. You don't process anything.
nothing where your signature shows up, - so you can't be subpoenaed.
deal.
whatever you find, find it fast.
the only thing keeping this case alive is Ali's statement.
you said I was gonna be safe. But that maniac is back out there.
who do you think he's pissed at right now, the crime lab?
look, Ali, you just need to take a breath here.
they're calling me a liar in the newspaper, a whore.
I told you not to read the papers.
the D. A. is doubting my statements now.
well, there are inconsistencies.
so you think I'm lying, too.
the levels of GHB in your system suggest that Curtis gave you a lethal dose.
you should be dead. Can you explain that?
I don't know; I'm not a scientist.
but without the physical evidence of you being drugged, all we have is your testimony.
forget it.
I'm not doing this anymore-- I'm dropping the charges.
let's be clear about something.
there is no dropping these charges. Okay?
you can't un-ring this bell.
you cannot force me to testify.
no. But the D. A. can, and he will.
you're in this, Ali.
okay, thanks for checking.
all right, so this is everything the FBI forwarded us on the DC rape cases.
not much here to look at.
Curtis was careful.
used cash buying them drinks, used condoms when he raped them, he used hotels so maids cleaned the sheets-- no evidence.
we only ever loosely connected him - to four attacks.
right. The senator's daughter was the only one ever to cooperate.
Serena, I wanted to tell you what we're gonna do, so there are no surprises.
I'm gonna take some photographs, then I'm gonna do an examination with what we call a sexual assault kit, and ask you a couple of questions.
is that okay?
Frank, can I get that camera?
okay, there's gonna be a flash.
Frank, do you mind stepping out for a moment?
I'm sorry. It's just I'm so embarrassed.
there's no reason to be.
if I hadn't been drinking when this whole...
Serena, listen to me. This is not your fault.
not your fault.
I remember his face.
if you find him, then... then I can identify him for you.
good. Good.
Hey, Jo?
your cell phone's ringing.
mac, I retested the swab from the cut on Ali Rand's cheek, only this time I ran an immunochemical test.
determining the age of the wounds Ali sustained during the rape.
right. I figured if we couldn't nail John Curtis on the GHB...
we could confirm that the beating took place when Ali and Curtis were together in the hotel.
right. Unfortunately, it proved the opposite.
John Curtis left Ali Rand in that hotel eight hours before my examination.
but according to the P-selection to E-selection ratios, those wounds were sustained only a couple of hours before I took the swab.
ali didn't just lie about the GHB, she lied about when she was beaten, too.
mac, she's lying about everything.
thank you.
saw you at the courthouse yesterday.
I saw you, too.
you looked busy-- Senator Matthews.
Yeah, like old times, huh?
did you go to the hearing?
didn't work out the way I thought.
how are you, Frank?
I'm fine.
yeah?
working in the private sector-- Rothwell Laboratories.
you like it?
it's a job.
what about Sally, the boys?
they're in Indiana.
I didn't know.
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in two years.
I'm truly sorry for what happened to you, Frank.
by "what happened to me," you mean when you fired me from the FBI?
okay, is that why you asked me to breakfast?
because if you think I regret the decision I made, you're mistaken.
no, no, no, I didn't think you'd change your mind.
you made a mistake processing Curtis's DNA and tried to cover it up.
I-I'm not here to argue.
I have thought about this long and hard, I really have.
when I came to the courthouse, I wanted to speak with you,
I wanted to...let you know I understand.
okay, thank you.
but then I watched Curtis get away with it again, and all the things I wanted to say to make amends got stuck in my throat.
I'm not gonna sit here and let you blame me for what you did.
I don't, Jo.
look, it took me a long time to figure it out, but I messed up and I own it.
if that's really the way you feel, I'm glad for you.
Yeah, but what I do blame you for is not letting it go.
why didn't you just ignore my mistake?
I had a responsibility, Frank.
to Serena, to the other victims.
if you'd just put your personal ethics to the side one time, none of this would be happening now.
clearly you still don't understand what happened two years ago, and there's no point rehashing the past.
you're right, it was a mistake calling you.
it won't happen again.
got a homicide in Central Park-- female, mid-20s, apparent victim of assault.
who called it in?
couple from Iowa, in town to see Spider-Man on Broadway, after a walk in the park.
odds were pretty good they were going to see a dead body either way.
she was putting on a pretty good show herself.
I aged the cut under her eye from the rape.
she might have done it to herself.
well, she didn't do this to herself.
this looks like a postcard
I mean, except for the dead body, of course, but the rest of it, wow, look at it.
total postcard.
wish you were here.
shut up and help me roll her.
blunt-force trauma to the head.
caved part of her skull in. Multiple blows?
it's hard to say.
I don't see any spatter.
it could have been just one shot. It depends what she was hit with.
this.
there's blood on it.
Oh, that'd do it.
so she was killed here. It wasn't a dump job.
it's probably not premeditated, right?
I mean, it'd be strange if someone planned to kill her with a rock.
you never know.
perp might have been following her. Could have snuck up behind her and, bang, lights out.
the result of a heated argument.
unsatisfied customer.
what? She's a call girl.
don't make me sorry I brought you out here.
if she really did fabricate the rape story, there's definitely one guy who would want to confront her.
and John Curtis just got released on bail.
2 years ago washington dc
we, the jury, find the defendant, John Curtis, not guilty of rape in the first degree.
Mr. Curtis, having been found not guilty of these charges, you are free to go.
okay.
he say anything yet? - Not about Ali Rand.
I don't get it.
why would he agree to come in and then not be willing to talk?
he's willing to talk, just not to me.
he specifically requested you.
this is Detective Jo Danville.
we're at the 12th Precinct. In the room with me is John Curtis.
this interview is being recorded - for the purpose of...
this isn't an interview. - Excuse me?
this isn't an interview.
I asked you here.
if anything, I'm interviewing you, but I'd prefer to call it a discussion.
nevertheless, the camera is here to record the...
to make sure I don't falsely claim something happened?
I mean, I can understand that.
I might leave here and go beat the hell out of myself and then come back and claim police brutality.
I hope you appreciate the irony here, you know, considering that you were so eager to believe-Ali was her name?
well, against my better judgment and even more so, against my lawyer's wishes,
I'll tell you this: I did have sex with her.
but I didn't rape her.
and why would she lie about that?
money. If not mine, the hotel's.
civil suit would be very lucrative.
where were you last night? - Where were you last night?
I don't find this amusing. - It's not meant to be.
and I'll tell you why I ask.
because I'd like to know what your alibi is for Ali's time of death.
the way I see it, you have more motive to kill Ali than I do.
I mean, you were so close, you could taste it.
you had a victim who suffered increased violence, who had GHB in her system and just enough memory to remember my name.
you were so close to being able to lay your head down on your pillow and forget me forever, but your star witness turned out to be a fraud, so you let Ali Rand know just how you felt about that.
send me a copy of that, would you?
I want to replay the look on your face.
Hey, Sid, have you ever seen someone punch herself in the face?
uh, no. Are you going to punch yourself in the face?
uh, let me try that again.
have you ever had a victim on your table who's exhibited self-inflicted punch wounds to the face?
uh, well, I've pretty much seen it all, but no,
I have not come across anyone who has successfully punched herself to death. Why?
could the old bruises on her face and the cut under her eye from the rape -
could those have been self-inflicted?
Mm... she seems pretty tough, but I would guess not.
it comes down to simple physics, really. F = M x A.
force equals mass times acceleration.
so you don't think she could have generated enough force?
not to sustain bruises like these or the laceration under her eye.
ultimately, her fist alone doesn't contain enough mass.
she would have to put her entire weight behind the punch to do this kind of damage.
so, in your medical opinion, somebody else punched Ali?
Yes, someone else punched her.
so she had an accomplice.
and whoever killed her, I'm thinking he hit her with something that left this behind.
Oh, check this out.
okay, what am I looking at? - Dermal denticles.
shark skin?
this is the trace from Ali Rand's coat?
Yeah. Weird, right?
unless her being a call girl is just a front for her real job as a pharmaceutical rep.
I'm not following.
I wasn't either, but I started looking into its uses, and there's this drug company that has been experimenting with protein in shark skin, developing these time-release gelatin capsules.
all right, collagen is extracted from the shark skin and then used to coat a cluster of individual microcapsules.
all right, the person ingests the pill, the outer layer is exposed to the stomach acids.
it dissolves, releasing the drug into the system.
and then the next layer is exposed and releases a second dose of the drug.
allowing a sustained release of the drug over time, by only taking one pill.
pretty cool, huh?
why use shark skin?
shark skin collagen has a higher degree of blocking damaging UV rays.
so the pills have a longer shelf life.
but this is before being ground up to coat a capsule.
did Lindsay ever mention Ali having a connection to a pharmaceutical company?
rothwell Laboratories?!
working in the private sector-- Rothwell Laboratories.
it's Frank Waters.
Frank Waters. NYPD.
how well did you say you knew this guy?
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I know Curtis is guilty.
where are you, Frank?
if I could go back...
just go back and undo what I did.
why don't we talk about it, Frank? Let's just sit down and talk about it.
tell me where you are.
that son of a bitch.
I know there are more. - More what, Frank?
it's my fault.
your intentions were good.
they were. I know that.
all I wanted was for him to go away so he could never do it again.
I'm sorry, Jo.
no, no, no! Frank!
just spoke to Jo.
she's heading back to the M. E.'s office with Frank's body.
our buddy Frankie-- he never met a piece of paper he didn't like.
I guess they didn't teach organization at Quantico, huh?
this isn't just sloppiness. It's obsession.
Yeah. I mean, he's got tons of surveillance photos of Curtis, he's got credit card receipts from all the hotel bars he went to.
Frank had a lot of time on his hands.
Flack talked to Frank's employer. He's been calling in sick two, three times a week.
maybe he was taking his work home with him.
this kitchen's set up like a makeshift chem lab.
plus we got empty containers of metal polish, drain cleaner and camp fuel.
all of which can be used to make GHB.
you think Frank was working with Ali to set up Curtis for rape?
he wanted Curtis to pay after making that mistake in DC.
tracked him all over New York.
and then what? He hires Ali to proposition Curtis in public?
sure. Whips up the GHB right here in the kitchen.
ali could have come here before going to the precinct.
he doses her, then beats her to make it look right, and sends her off to the precinct to make a complaint.
something doesn't make sense. I mean, Frank worked at the FBI crime lab for years.
so how did he get the GHB levels so wrong?
ali could have accidentally taken a wrong amount.
I mean, there are a number of things that could have gone sideways.
and when they did, Frank got worried Ali would give him up.
so, he confronts her at the park.
what did you tell them? - Nothing. I'm done with this.
and made sure she'd stay quiet.
2 years ago fbi crime lab washington dc
tiger Woods, look out.
got my own clubs. Close the door, Frank.
Uh-oh. Someone in trouble?
I spent all night with this; couldn't sleep. I was just sick to my stomach.
you missed a marker on John Curtis's DNA profile.
no. The DNA's a match. All 13 loci.
you got my report.
Yeah, I got it, March 3.
I signed off on it, and you testified to it in court.
and then I found this, dated March 2.
the first time you tested John Curtis's DNA when you missed a marker.
where did you get that?
from the printer queue in the lab. I assume you destroyed the original.
look, Jo, I made a mistake.
it's not just a mistake, Frank. You know I have to alert the defense.
Oh, you do that, this whole case could blow up.
you've given me no choice.
he was a friend of yours?
used to be close. Yeah.
how is it possible to misjudge a person so?
I trusted this man.
and now he's suspected of murder.
Yeah, and I can't wrap my head around that.
well...I haven't found any physical evidence that directly connects Frank to Ali Rand's murder, but I did find this.
irritation on the right hand and several fingertips.
looks like chemical burns.
I found similarly inflamed tissue on the inside of his nostrils.
sent samples up to the lab.
you know, supposedly, Frank was making GHB in the apartment.
suggests he wasn't wearing gloves or a respirator.
also supports the theory that he was helping Ali set up John Curtis.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Yeah, me, too, Sid.
Hey, Mac, one of the patrolmen retrieved Frank Waters' cell phone a few feet from where he killed himself.
damaged in the collision.
were you able to retrieve any phone messages or e-mails?
I can do better than that.
I transferred the memory card to my tablet.
found a conversation between Frank and Ali the day she died.
what are you, a cop or something? - Yeah, I used to be, sort of. I worked on the John Curtis case in DC.
you did a hell of a job. - Yeah, well, so did you.
I was in court today.
if you're gonna dose yourself with GHB, you better figure out the right levels.
you're crazy. - Yeah, maybe.
and I'm precise. And so is the New York Crime Lab.
right now, they are pulling apart every detail of your story.
if you're lying about anything else, they'll know.
get away from me. - I'm right, aren't I? You tried to frame him.
let go of me now.
you know, you made it almost impossible for anyone else to step forward?
the scrutiny they'd face?
just let me go.
when was this recorded?
about an hour before she was killed.
why would he record this conversation?
it's like he was collecting evidence, trying to prove that Ali set Curtis up.
well, doesn't exonerate Frank from the murder, but it changes our theory.
clearly, he wasn't involved in the setup, but he could have followed Ali to the park... killed her out of anger?
Oh, it's possible.
but if Frank wasn't involved in framing Curtis, what was he doing with all that surveillance, and why was he making GHB?
so, the metal polish and drain cleaner we found in Frank's apartment didn't belong to him.
we found John Curtis's fingerprints all over those containers.
how did Frank get them?
he was following Curtis's movements.
took a photo of Curtis getting rid of a large trash bag.
hoping to establish Curtis was making his own GHB.
Yeah, Frank was a busy man.
I sorted through all the other surveillance photos of Curtis and hundreds of credit card receipts.
we got Curtis hitting six or seven different hotels every weekend for the past two months.
and the credit card receipts?
all from the same hotels. All belonging to female customers, dating as far back as six months ago.
Frank figured out what nights Curtis frequented the hotel bars, then collected data on the women who were there.
he was looking for another victim who hadn't come forward.
he'd have to track dozens of different women based only on their credit card information.
Frank was always stubbornly determined.
and that's how he got this.
that's Curtis's car.
I found a tape lift attached to the back of the photo, and it had a single hair on it.
you run it for DNA yet?
Yeah, but no hit in CODIS.
maybe there doesn't have to be.
a batting coach would tell you to swing from the hips, but that's a good follow-through, though.
what do you know about rare wood? - Not much.
I'm guessing this has to do with the splinter Sid removed from Ali's head wound.
it's Pink lvory.
it's one of the three rarest varieties on the planet.
it's grown almost entirely in Southern Africa, and it's the sovereign tree of the Zulu Nation.
should I put a BOLO out on the Zulu royal family? - Not yet.
the traditional weapon from Southern Africa is called a knob kerrie.
it's a cross between a club and a walking stick.
similar to the Shillelagh in Ireland. Considered a gentleman's weapon.
right. The handle is rounded, so I thought it might have caused the circular bruising on Ali's temple, so I'm testing them to see if I can match the shape of the bruise.
although, it's a little conspicuous to be walking around New York with it.
not if it's out of plain sight.
detective Taylor.
uh, come on in.
I hope this house call means you've got some good news on the John Curtis case.
I'm not here about John Curtis.
I'm here about Ali Rand's murder.
Serena, would you excuse us one minute?
I come here out of respect for you and what you've accomplished in your life.
I was also wondering where that umbrella of yours is.
the one you carry in your briefcase.
mac, this is Senator Matthews.
what does this have to do with that woman's murder?
your umbrella was one of two weapons used to kill her.
so now...now I'm a suspect in a... in the murder of a woman that I-I don't even know.
last year, you took some high-profile trips-- Miami, Aspen, two-week junket in Europe.
Yeah, it's all Senate business.
according to her financial records, Ali was in Miami, Aspen and Europe at the same time.
same hotels, too.
I'm insulted at the innuendo.
how much did you pay her?
I'm a United States Senator.
how much did you pay her to frame John Curtis for rape?
Yes, add that to my-my list of felonies. I'm going to ask you to leave now.
and I'll come back with a warrant for you to produce that unique umbrella.
and while you're thinking of excuses for how it disappeared, your face will replace John Curtis on the news.
they won't be talking about the DC Rapist anymore.
what would you do, Detective?
if your daughter was violated the way mine was.
he was gonna rape again, unless someone took the initiative.
and so you hired Ali to trap him.
Oh, God, I should've just gunned him down myself.
ali picked up Curtis at the hotel. Afterwards, she and I met at her place.
ready?
she assured me she could handle the scrutiny of a high-profile investigation.
then the case began to unravel.
cause she started panicking. She'd call me every few minutes.
I told her we can't have any contact until the trial is concluded, but she insisted on meeting.
and that's when you decided she was a loose end?
the only thing that mattered to me was seeing John Curtis pay his debt.
I wanted to help you, but they know I'm lying now.
Hey, Ali, Ali, we are so close.
if you stop now, Curtis is gonna do it again.
it's not my problem.
no, hey, don't... don't walk away from me, damn it. Come on.
I was desperate.
detective Danville?
Yeah, she's, uh, right over there.
Amanda Tanner? - Yeah.
I'm Jo Danville, Detective. I spoke to you on the phone.
Yeah.
thank you for coming down here.
can you tell me what this is about?
maybe we should go to a room where it's a little more private.
well, I have to be somewhere, so can you just tell me why I'm here?
we need to talk about John Curtis.
I don't know who that is.
you were at the Rapid Lounge, three weeks ago, on Spring Street, right?
he... spilled your drink, maybe offered to buy you a new one?
we left the bar after, um, about an hour, and, uh...
he drove me back to my place.
normally, I wouldn't, I mean...
we just met, but...
I'm not here to judge you, Amanda. I just need to understand what happened.
I asked him up, and, uh...
he opened a bottle of wine, and we were just talking.
I started to feel... the room started...
you blacked out?
I woke up the next morning and...
I was naked...
and my wrists... they were all red.
and... and I looked in the mirror and I saw my face.
it's okay.
how did you find me?
from a hair in John Curtis's car.
we cross-referenced it to hotel credit card receipts and DMV photos, which led us to you.
I mean, I had the sheets and the wine and the clothes and everything, but...
I just couldn't...
do you still have those things-- the clothes you were wearing, the wine glass?
would you mind if we went back to your place and I got those things from you?
it's very important.
great apartment. Got a lot of light.
Yeah. I'm moving, though. I just can't stay here, you know?
Oh, this is great.
there's enough residue left that might contain the GHB.
the clothes are in my bedroom closet. I'll be right back.
okay.
have you thought about seeing a therapist?
might help to talk to someone about what happened.
Yeah, I thought about it. I just, I think I need some time, you know?
I understand.
what about your parents, have you told them?
do they live in the city?
get up. Come on.
get up!
beg me not to kill you.
come on, I want to hear you say it.
never.
Attagirl.
you never did know when to give up, did you?
you know how some experts say that sick people...
people like me, you know, that ultimately, we want to be caught?
that the mistakes we make are intentional.
or that we stray from some particular course of action because we like the risk?
those experts are morons.
I have no intention of being caught.
this... was not intentional.
you got too close, Jo.
can I call you Jo?
no bullets.
come on. Come on, you can do it.
there you go.
you know how most gun accidents happen and people end up shooting themselves?
bang.
you got me. You finally got me.
they always forget the one in the chamber.
NYPD, NYPD, NYPD...
NYPD 4,
FDNY 3.
don't look so smug. It ain't over yet.
Ah, let's see, osso bucco in a nice red wine sauce, - porcini mushrooms... - Uh-uh.
and you wonder why the public likes us better.
you guys are - so cocky. - Oh, come on, Curtis.
your boys have won the last five. I'm tired of buying you dinner.
damn it!
firemen tie the score...
NYPD 4, FDNY 4.
come on!
Hey, get your head in the game, kid. You're better than that.
are you kidding me? Who just got nailed in the corner over there, all right?
get the puck along the boards! - Just keep your skates up against the post.
you learn that in peewee league. - Hey, hey, hey, shut up, the two of you. We are not losing this game.
we got two minutes left. Danny, I need you strong on the forecheck.
Adam, nothing gets past you. Focus, baby. Focus.
let's go, boys.
Hey, Flack, that last goal was for your mother. This next one's for your sister.
my sister died six months ago, jackass.
no. Bro, I didn't know. - She's not dead, you idiot.
mention my family again, I'll punch you in the mouth.
so, how you been? You feeling all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
the last six months have felt like five years, but it's good to be back.
I appreciate you coming by the hospital every week.
that meant a lot. - Ah. Least I could do.
well, how's Christine? Please tell me you haven't screwed that up.
no, no.
it's great. She's great. Mary and the kids?
I screwed that up years ago.
but she loves me. What can I say?
come on! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here!
cinema quoi cinema, I'd have to say Manhattan. - No!
Yes. - No way, absolutely not. Annie Hall.
Annie Hall over Manhattan any day of the week. - Well, Manhattan has a classic style and a Gershwin score.
Nah, it's black and white. - No, but it's just... You just prefer a more unconventional form of storytelling.
I guess I'm just more of a conventional guy.
nothing about you is conventional, Sid.
Messer, you suck!
Hey, you want to come down here and say that?
all right, all right, all right.
Annie Hall, for sure.
come on! Get him!
Go...!
that's the game!
FDNY wins, 5 to 4.
Oh, really? Come on! Let's go.
let's go! Come on!
come on! Come on!
come on. You want more?
well, I guess there's no truth to the rumor the departments hate each other.
il Mulino. 8: 00.
I'm ordering dessert.
10-75, 10-75. Fire at 3237th Avenue.
all available trucks in the area.
commercial building, occupants unknown.
10-47, police response for crowd control.
323, that's just down the block.
everybody, back up! Back up now! Back up!
everybody, get back!
get back! Get across the street. Let's go! Back up!
let's go! Let's move! There may be someone trapped in there!
Joe, you and Kevin take this floor.
do a primary search for anybody trapped.
you don't see anyone, you get out immediately, you hear me?
is there anybody in here?!
bang on the floor if you can hear me!
captain! There's no one on this end.
may our hearts be always ready if we should be summoned before our Eternal Chief in the midst of our labors.
through our ministrations to our suffering fellowmen, we dedicate our lives humbly to Your praise and glory.
in joy or sorrow, we ask only that You may be pleased with our service, that when the Last Alarm shall have sounded for us, we may receive our eternal assignment with You.
Amen.
present arms.
order arms.
nice and slow. One step at a time.
you okay? You need to take a break?
I can't remember what happened.
the thing. I- I can't picture it in my head. At all.
mac, it's totally normal for you not to remember. - I...
went to the, uh...
Mac. - No, no. I want...
I want to know. I walked into the...
pharmacy. - Pharmacy, yeah.
that's it. That's all I can remember.
there was a guy robbing the store for drugs.
you shot him, but you didn't know he had a girl outside helping him.
she came in, and she shot you in the back.
you don't have to do this, you know...
come here every day.
nice and slow, one step at a time.
Ugh, I hate you seeing me like this.
well, you better get used to it.
cause I'm not going anywhere.
Mac. He's there right now.
two unis posted at the scene just saw him go in.
they have the perimeter secured. He's not going anywhere.
they only sent two of you?
how disappointing.
so, this is the guy we've been keeping our eye on since the fire.
they collared him back in, like...
97. They say he was responsible for ten fires, but they could only pin the last one on him.
he gets out 15 years later and torches the same building?
I know arson's tough to prove, but he didn't leave anything behind - at the first nine fires? - Nothing that linked back to him.
they didn't even have an ID on him until the tenth fire. - How'd they grab him?
he ran back inside the burning building when he realized someone was still inside.
come on, please. Come on, please don't...
please, please!
uniforms rolled up on him giving CPR to the vic, but it was too late.
the guy who died, the fireman, he was a friend of yours?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry he died.
Yeah, you're so sorry you went back to the scene during his funeral.
you couldn't even let us have that.
you're right. That was poor timing on my part.
I'm sorry. I apologize. - Two weeks.
you get paroled, it takes you all of two weeks to get right back at it.
I didn't do this.
do you really think I would be stupid enough to hit the same building twice?
your signature is all over it, Leonard. Same thing each time.
so don't sit there and tell me you had nothing to do with this.
1992, '93, '95.
buildings on Hudson, 8th, and Prince.
it was never proven I had anything to do with those fires.
you use wax paper and dryer sheets to spread the fire through the hallways.
we found the same residue at this scene.
1994. Corner of Thompson and Spring.
you don't have anything to link me to that fire.
fire gel running up the walls at each scene.
and wouldn't you know it, we found residue from fire gel at this 7th Avenue fire.
disabled sprinkler system.
you cut the chain to the OS&Y valve...
every fire you're believed to be associated with.
Believed..."
being the operative word. - Look, don't sit there and insult me by saying you didn't do this!
how'd you light the fires, Leonard?
some kind of time-delay device, huh? How'd you do it?
I'm not gonna conjure fire from thin air, Detective.
put 'em down.
do you smoke?
no.
drink?
I trust you've never experimented with heroin or crystal meth?
addiction. That's what it is, an addiction.
only there's no chemical in my bloodstream weaving its way through my body.
the poison coursing through my veins is psychological.
and the antidote can't be found in a bottle of pills.
trust me: many doctors have tried.
I don't want to do what I do, Detective.
every day, every hour,
I battle with my mind.
don't do it.
don't do it. Don't do it.
and I've won that battle for the last 15 years.
Yeah, I'm-I'm confused. You waiting for some kind of applause here?
you want me to cry? What?
let's talk honestly, shall we, Detective?
we both know you can't prove I did anything.
otherwise you would have arrested me days ago.
you waited to see if I would go to the scene.
which you did.
why would I do that?
must have known you'd have people watching the place. My parole officer knows where I'm staying.
I knew I would be arrested within minutes, so why go back?
because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.
someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.
and you might know who that someone is?
I'm offering my services.
as a... arson investigator...
if you will.
to help figure out wh-who set the fire, based on the case evidence.
but I have to study the scene. I have to go back to it 'cause I'm the only one who knows what to look for.
don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it"?
the only reason this wackadoo hasn't set a fire in the last 15 years - is because he's been locked up. - What do we have to lose?
if he's lying, he incriminates himself in the process.
arrogance... it's always the criminal's Achilles' heel.
all right, so, when we found you, what were you looking for, Leonard?
this.
it's the ignition point.
Yeah, great, genius. That was a tough one.
can I lock his ass up now, please?
did you find anything here? Either inside or next to the hole in the floor?
one of my investigators found some kind of melted metal.
about the size of a dime?
what was it, Leonard? - Have I not earned your respect enough to not treat me like one of your project thugs?
you don't have even one ounce of my respect.
which is precisely why I'm not gonna tell you what it was.
you'll use it against me. - All right, look.
you're gonna have to do better than that,
Leonard. I'm still overtaken with emotion over your "I have just as much incentive to solve this as you do" speech, so come on.
well, whoever did this did their homework, I will give them that.
wax paper.
dryer sheets.
I may have used them, but they don't necessarily link back to me.
melted metal is part of a time-delay device.
it's an ingredient in a compact and simple chain of reactions that would allow the arsonist to get out of the building before it ignited.
I employed the technique...
once, - and that's all I'm gonna give you on that. - That's it?
we brought you out here for that?
Yeah. This was very helpful.
perhaps not to you, but it was to me.
what's on your mind, Mac?
I'm having trouble...
remembering things. - What kind of things?
like... things like this.
I know what it does,
I know how to use it, but I ca... I can't tell you what it's called.
I can't recall the names of certain foods, colors.
I know the difference between them, but...
sometimes I...
I can't name them. - You're suffering from what's called anomic aphasia.
when you were shot, it appears that for a time, your brain was deprived of an adequate supply of oxygen.
it's likely that this caused damage to a particular area of your brain.
we'll have to do more tests to determine the extent of it.
I'd rather no one else know.
of course.
how long do you think it'll last? - Some cases are temporary.
it diminishes and even disappears with time and therapy.
many times, I'm afraid, the condition is permanent.
I've got the mayor, the commissioner and half the fire department calling for answers. This better be good.
good" is definitely not the word I would use, but you should see this before you return any calls.
Triethylaluminum. It's highly pyrophoric.
it ignites immediately upon exposure to air.
used as an additive for rocket propellants.
water.
you want to do the honors?
wow, it's even more flammable when introduced to water.
Yeah. It gets worse.
the trace we found in the room where Curtis Smith died...
it's rubber from balloons. We found several of these on the floor.
there were also...
metal eyelets were on the wall, running all the way up to the ceiling, where this piece of wood was rigged.
it was a trip wire.
he knew the FDNY would rush in.
it was a trap designed to kill a firefighter.
Adam, you've been at this how long?
Oh, I'd say about, uh, three, four years now.
well, he has to be in the crowd.
arsonists are sick people.
they disregard risk to thumb their nose at authority, and they love to watch their work.
maybe he doesn't. I mean, look at Johnny Depp.
he doesn't watch any of his movies.
show me what you got. - All right.
a lot of people in the crowd with criminal records.
dirty dozen. Everything from public urination to fraudulent accosting, also known as running a...
three-card monte game. Huh, but...
nothing comes even close to arson.
you, uh, ever been fraudulently accosted, Jo?
I had this friend Pete who was fraudulently accosted, yeah.
this girl picked him up at the, uh, Drunken Dog Tavern.
Yeah, turned out she was a dude.
what up?
that's way out in Brooklyn. They would've never responded to this fire.
Adam, run this guy through the software. - The firefighter?
do it.
okay.
criminal Impersonation?
this guy's not even a fireman.
five years. That's all I can do.
I'm begging you, please. I- I can't do more than five years.
I... just if you could help me out, I-I...
slow down. We'll get to that.
we don't need to discuss that right now; Just have a seat and we'll talk about what happened.
I can't do more than five years.
Marshall Hilson. - Yes, sir.
applied to the FDNY in 2001. Rejected.
applied to the Yonkers Fire Department 2002.
rejected.
applied to seven fire departments on Long Island.
rejected. All on the basis of psychological issues.
I'm not crazy. - No one's saying you're crazy.
they are.
they say I am.
does that piss you off?
make you feel like you want to get back at them?
let's talk about what happened.
it wasn't supposed to go that way.
you wanted to be a hero. Set a fire.
then, be a first responder. - It got out of control.
it killed my friend. - What?
come on. Let's not draw this out, Marshall.
no, no, no, no, wait a minute. You said somebody got killed.
who got killed?
nobody got killed. - Curtis Smith.
captain Curtis Smith, you son of a bitch.
the one the other day? On 7th Avenue?
you think I did that?
I wouldn't do that.
I would never intentionally harm a fellow firefighter.
you're not a firefighter, Marshall. - It was an abandoned car.
it was on the side of the road. Two wheels were missing.
it was just supposed to be a easy, simple thing.
there were gas cans in the trunk. I thought I could handle it, but it...
don't move. - Five years.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it. You can't do more than five years.
I got it.
Leonard's in the wind.
what about the guys we posted at his apartment?
they watched him go in and then they watched him go out.
he called a plumbing company and swapped outfits when the guy showed.
what's up with this guy?
he's a waste of time. The guy's touched in the head.
he's just a buff.
not smart enough to have pulled this off. - Leonard's playing with us.
you saw him at the scene. This "addiction," as he calls it?
it's still inside him.
you know, well, I guess I'm just hoping that after all these years he's learned to control those impulses.
all units, all units:
1075 in progress at 1528th Street, commercial building...
got the suspect, Leonard Brooks.
Leonard Brooks found on site, and taken by the fire department.
captain says hi.
enough. That's enough. - You want some?
back up.
help him out. Come on.
what the hell's going on?
he was just standing there when we pulled up, looking all proud or something.
well, he don't look proud now, does he? - Are you kidding me?
you don't get to do that. You don't even know what happened.
that was in his pocket. That's all I need to know.
Oh, by the way, there was another booby trap in that building.
you know, if it wasn't for those sprinkler systems, we'd be going to another funeral.
did Brooks say anything before you started hitting him? - Yeah, he did.
he wanted to know why he was allowed to walk around the streets after killing my captain.
your captain was my friend.
you don't get to beat a man down just because you think he had something to do with Smitty's death.
you see that fire right there?
that's what happens when cops don't take care of business.
come here.
what the hell are you doing?
I'm taking care of business.
you're under arrest for assault and resisting arrest.
don't move!
copy that. On my way up. - Belt's on the rig.
that's good. Right there.
were the sprinklers on - when the first truck got here? - What?
the sprinklers. You said they were on. Were they on when the first truck got here?
Yes, yes, yes, they were on. - Thank you.
yo. - Yeah?
put him in the car. - You can't be serious.
you grab that other mook over there. He goes too.
take them back to the house, put them in the cells, wait for me there to get there.
you still think Leonard had nothing to do with these fires?
there should be plenty of evidence left inside to tell us one way or another.
if he was involved, why stick around? - To watch.
or maybe it's what you said: It's arrogance. He thinks he's smarter than everybody else.
you okay? - Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, it's gonna be all right.
this valve is normally locked in the on position.
someone broke the lock and turned the system off.
then, after the fire started and before FDNY got here, someone turned it back on.
what, you think Leonard suddenly grew a conscience?
maybe he had one all along.
so, uh, I ran all the prints from the scene.
now, except for a couple of Leonard's prints on the sprinkler valve outside the building, found nothing in AFIS.
vent tubing was used to help the fire travel from room to room.
they were filled with fire gel.
same ignition method, same materials used, same choreography as the other fires.
no prints of value inside the glove.
but all hope is not lost.
as you always have to use a gloveless hand to put on the first glove.
I'm hoping that this sewing kit can get us somewhere; it's nothing fancy.
it's pretty much standard issue at a lot of hotels.
but I did find it really close to the ignition point and I'm hoping if I can ID this partial logo, I could maybe get us a location that connects us to our arsonist.
also, I found a sewing needle near the ignition point, which is consistent with the melted steel we found at the other fires.
now, we just have to figure out how you use a needle to start a fire.
I think your cake's done.
it's looking like got a few good prints there.
let's hope it's the icing on the case.
Really? - Oh, that's pathetic.
eh, I kind of liked it.
Mr. Brooks, do you remember how you were injured?
a couple of firemen kicked my ass for no apparent reason.
do you remember how you got here? - Back of an ambulance.
I got nothing to say, so stay the hell away from me.
what was the address of the fire doing in your pocket?
somebody slipped it under the door of my place.
who?
I'm guessing the same person who killed your friend the fireman and tried to burn down that building.
Yeah, okay. What were you doing there? - Same thing as you.
hoping to run into the person who's been setting these fires.
there's 1528th Street in Brooklyn; there's also one in Manhattan and Queens.
but you knew it was the one in Brooklyn. How'd you know that, Leonard?
was that the address of the next fire you intended to set
very nice, Detective. Excellent police work.
you should ask for a raise. But let me correct you.
because I wasn't stopped.
if I didn't go back to save that woman, you wouldn't even know my name.
who else knew about that address? Who else did you tell?
well, that's the $64, 000 question, isn't it?
now, if you'll excuse me, I'm done answering your questions.
you better hope you're half as smart as you think you are because when you slip,
I'm gonna be there to kick you the rest of the way down the stairs.
he had to have told someone about that address.
been in prison for the last 15 years.
may have been someone he met on the inside.
don't tell me you're buying that crap about a fire fairy slipping a note under his door.
well, someone turned those sprinklers back on.
why would he put out his own fire?
maybe there's more than one person involved.
just saw you called. - We got a hit off some prints on the latex gloves we found at the scene, and they don't belong to Leonard Brooks.
Eva Mason, arrests for arson in Pennsylvania.
on parole, absconded a couple of weeks ago. Active parole warrant.
you think her and Leonard were working together? - Maybe.
she visited him in prison a few times about seven or eight years ago.
interviewed him on three separate occasions and wrote several letters after that.
she was a psychology major, doing a research study on arsonists and pyromaniacs.
three interviews? Probably got to know him pretty well.
we have a location on her? - Yeah, Lindsay ID'd the logo on that sewing kit.
kit came from the River Peak Motel on the West Side.
she got a room around the time she went AWOL from Pennsylvania.
Jo is hitting the door with ESU as we speak.
do it.
clear.
clear. - Clear!
what the...?
this girl was definitely, uh, the president of his fan club.
odorless, colorless liquid.
if I had to guess, I'd say glycerin.
these must be all the components she used to build her ignition devices.
same ones Brook used to set his fires.
Oh, my. This is a live feed.
she was watching him.
don't turn on the light.
what the hell took you so long?
is that her?
go! Get in the chair!
mac, get over to Brooks' place as fast as you can.
Eva Mason's not working with him. She's gonna kill him.
don't you lie to me!
I'll put this bullet right in your face.
the news said you were cooperating with the police.
I didn't want to believe it, but then I saw you out there.
why would you do that?! Why would you turn those sprinklers - back on?!
I-I wanted to stop you, to save you from the life I had!
it's 15 years spent in a filthy prison cell surrounded by animals!
it's okay to feel these things; You don't have to act on them.
there are people that can help you. - Help me?
Yeah. - Save me?
I did this for you! - Okay.
I waited for you.
I wanted to show you; I wanted you to be proud of me.
what the hell are you talking about? I don't even know you.
don't you ever say that to me!
you know me! You're the only one that knows me, because you're just like me.
fire is the only thing you think about.
the way it looks, the way it smells, the way it moves... those were your words!
that's what you said! That's what you told me!
I s-said that, but I-I... never tried to hurt people.
don't tell me you didn't fantasize about it.
you just didn't have the balls to do it!
I didn't tell the police about you. - Shut up!
if I wanted to hurt you...
don't you lie to me!
you went with them back in the building where the fireman died; I saw you!
I needed to know that it was you!
shut up!
you're just like them, and you need to die just like them!
and the last thing you see...
will be the thing you love most.
where is she?!
this was all that was left of your property,
I'm sorry.
guess when you don't have much, you don't have much to lose.
potassium permanganate...
mixed with water becomes an astringent antiseptic.
but mixed with glycerin...
and exposed to oxygen, it strips electrons from the glycerin so violently that it creates a flame.
takes about 30 seconds for the reaction to occur.
we found these materials in Eva Mason's motel room.
I didn't get many visitors in those 15 years.
I guess I boasted a bit too much when I did.
well, Eva Mason listened very well.
she was a bright, charming, well-adjusted young woman all those years ago.
a student drawn to the subject matter.
nothing like the person who killed your friend.
I guess I was naive to think I could save her from a life in prison.
it's where she belonged.
I know you still have those feelings, Leonard.
you don't have to give in to them.
you don't have to go back there.
everything that's happen the last few days, maybe you can put it behind you.
start over. - It's too late for that, Detective.
I'm never gonna have the house and the wife with the two kids, the dog and the white picket fence.
my past will always follow me.
as it should.
I do still... I have the urges every day, and I don't want to go back to that place.
but... as long as I can't be arrested for my thoughts, I won't.
thank you for treating me like a human being.
we don't know any other way.
Hey, I know it's been a rough couple of weeks and I don't want to sound selfish, but I'm having withdrawals.
for six months I'm with you practically 16 hours a day, and now, lately, it'd be easier to get an audience with the pope.
Yeah, but the pope isn't taking you to your favorite place for dinner.
thank you.
or... giving you these.
what are these for?
I don't think I ever officially thanked you for taking care of me.
there is no gift or words...
that could ever come close to saying how much it meant having you there by my side through those six months.
every single day your smile and your love just pushed me to work harder, and you...
you lifted my spirits.
so.
two dozen roses...
one for every week you took care of me.
all right, enough of the mushy stuff.
let's go and eat. I'm starving.
you know I have favorite places all over the city. Which one are we going to?
well, you know, the one with the, uh, the dish that you like.
Oh, let's see, that narrows it down to about 50 places?
you know...
th-the one with the, uh, stuff.
the one with the chef who, uh, you always ask him what the recipe is and he always leaves out one ingredient.
Oh, Piccolo! The truffle rigatoni with vegetable and sausage!
Yes. - Wow, you made that difficult.
do I win a prize?
well, I think it's hanging off your arm.
okay, bring her down.
bring her down.
our vic is Ellen White, 19 years old.
she was originally from Kansas. Has no family locally to speak of.
her classmate, Alexa Holdman, discovered her when she was practicing one of those twirly things.
a pirouette?
like I said, a twirly thing.
any idea how she got up there?
looks like the killer used the theater's pulley system.
Alexa Holdman seems pretty together for someone who just found her friend murdered.
they weren't friends.
Ellen was Alexa's understudy, and that was the extent of their relationship.
petechial hemorrhaging.
C. O.D.'s most likely asphyxiation.
you needed an exam for that? She was hung up by a rope.
we're not sure the rope killed her.
a ligature mark and bruising.
no ecchymosis present.
most likely made postmortem.
this bruising is more consistent with being choked to death.
discoloration and swelling indicates it was made antemortem.
all right, I may not be the owner of a wonderful white lab coat, but it sounds to me like you're saying somebody strangled her, then strung her up.
why hang somebody who's already dead?
I don't know, Mac.
Alexa Holdman finds her talented understudy dead, doesn't seem the least bit upset about it.
I know it's a clich? but understudies do go on to become stars, so maybe Ellen's was shining a bit too bright for Alexa's liking.
Danny confirmed the pulley system was used to hang the body, a task even a 90-pound ballerina could pull off.
that's an interesting theory. There's only one problem.
Hawkes said Ellen's death was around 6: 00 p. m.
now, I just spoke to the dancers and the director of the show.
anyone who's a possible suspect was in rehearsal from 5: 00 until 8: 00, including the very icy Alexa Holdman.
how about Ellen? She ever make it there?
she left to use the bathroom around 5: 30 and never came back.
no one thought to go looking for her?
apparently, breaks were pretty common for Ellen. Sometimes she'd come back, sometimes no.
no one else was in the...the, uh...
building? No.
the dancers and the director had the place to themselves.
janitors don't get here till 10: 00, which is 15 minutes from now.
well, the victim didn't hang herself.
someone was here who wasn't supposed to be.
find out who that was.
I'm sorry I didn't... I didn't return your calls.
I didn't know what to say.
I understand why you're angry with me, Christine.
I'm not angry.
um... hurt, uh, confused... a little embarrassed.
I realized I'd been acting like a teenage girl, you know?
butterflies in my stomach 'cause I'm so excited to see you, fighting the urge to text message every minute...
making a lot more of this than... than what it is, so I'm going to take a step back.
no, I don't want you to do that.
Yeah, well, if that's true, then why don't you tell me what's wrong?
why are you shutting me out of whatever it is that you're going through?
that's not what I'm doing. This isn't... about us.
Oh, okay. I get it.
it's none of my business.
that's not what I'm saying.
mac, the problem is that you are not saying anything.
you... you make me very happy. I'm just... struggling with...
you can tell me.
you know, all those nights that I sat by your bedside in the hospital, it wasn't because I felt some obligation.
I was where I wanted to be.
I sat there day after day, praying... because I wanted...
I needed you to recover.
mac, you can trust me.
I can't... I can't remember things.
since the shooting, I... my... mem-memory is...
it's the little things, mostly, like colors, names of colors, foods, little... every-everyday objects.
I just... I thought I could work through it on my own, but I just keep forgetting things.
they call it aphasia.
I keep seeing all these doctors, and they... they tell me it could, uh...
it could go away, or this could be how I am.
why didn't you share this with me, Mac?
never mind. I asked a question I already know the answer to.
you know, one of the most endearing things about you is your pride.
but it's also your weakness.
and I-I have to decide if I can live with that.
okay.
a dancer, more than any other human being, dies two deaths.
Martha Graham said that.
though, obviously, she didn't have our victim in mind when she said it.
then cause of death was asphyxiation by manual strangulation.
the ligature mark was made postmortem.
Yes.
I also found esophageal scarring and enamel loss.
so she was bulimic. Common in dancers.
but not my only discovery.
those weren't made by the killer.
self-mutilation. Or, as the cool kids call it...
cutting.
from the look of these scars, going on over a year now.
well, our killer may have known about her issues and wanted us to think it was a suicide.
bruising suggests her killer went straight at her.
but I didn't find any defensive marks on her hands.
well, if that's the case, Ellen may have known her killer.
Hey, never get Lucy a cell phone.
she's only five, Doc.
I mean, never ever.
I went through Ellen White's cell.
there were 500 texts from this week alone.
anything out of the ordinary?
no, just a lot of "IMHO"s and "FTW"s.
the girl moves to New York a year ago. Has no close friends in town.
texts her boyfriend in Kansas daily.
I can't seem to find a reason anyone would want her dead.
well, I found black trace on the rope.
came back a mixture of saltpeter, charcoal and sulfur.
all components of black powder.
as in the type of gun powder used during the Civil War?
before the Civil War, actually.
so, how does gunpowder from an antique gun end up on the rope of our hanging victim?
Messer, you got to do me a favor and tell your wife to back off, okay?
cause I didn't do it.
okay, and I don't like being accused of things I didn't do when I didn't do it because I didn't do it, okay?
that make any sense to you?
Yeah, he didn't do it.
Hey, babe, what'd you do to Adam?
don't think that you two aren't suspects.
what happened to your eyes?
you know, I think I'm a pretty nice person.
levelheaded, patient, as is evidenced by the man I've taken as my husband.
God knows how you do it.
somebody decided,"Hey, she's an easy target.
let's play lab prank on Lindsay because she's... what, weak?
whoever did this is going down.
and you think Adam did it?
well, I think so, but I haven't had a chance to process the microscope yet, so until I do, everybody's a suspect. Okay?
I don't think I need to remind you two that your fingerprints and your DNA are in our reference files.
all this is very fascinating, and I personally can't wait to find out who did it, but...
I'm slightly more interested in this antique gun gallery. Murder case?
Yeah.
Jane Doe shot in Hell's Kitchen 24 hours ago.
the gun used to kill her discharged a loading paper that's used in front-loading guns of the antique variety.
what are you looking for?
a zigzagging wound pattern indicated in Sid's autopsy report.
we reconstructed the fragments.
the bullet was a. 26 caliber pellet.
the powder burns on the victim's clothing would indicate that the shooter was approximately ten feet away.
that brings out the color in your eyes.
thank you.
any luck?
I think number two's a winner.
closely mimics the wound pattern that Sid found on his CT scan.
the Allen & Thurber pepperbox revolver.
it's manufactured in 1830.
pre-civil War.
you find traces of black powder GSR on your victim?
Yeah. Why?
cause I found black powder on the rope that was used to hang Ellen White.
GSR from the gun that killed our Jane Doe matched GSR from the rope that hung our ballerina.
doesn't make sense.
no, it doesn't.
nothing about these two murders suggests serial killer.
the women have nothing in common: job, description, social circles.
two completely different methods of murder.
and no signature left by their attacker.
still, the evidence suggests that whoever shot our Jane Doe strangled Ellen White.
keep moving. Keep moving!
please... - Shut up. Back up.
Freeze! Put the weapon down!
young lady, come towards me. Come towards me.
back away from the weapon. Put your hands behind your head.
patrol picked him up holding a girl at gunpoint.
same gun used to kill the Jane Doe in Hell's Kitchen.
you like shooting young girls with old guns?
I never shot anybody.
of course not. You're a good guy.
let's see. Sam Cross, 25 years old.
highlights include: assault, armed robbery and burglary.
so, tell me, what made you graduate to murder?
whoa, wait a minute. Murder?
look, I didn't kill these girls. Okay?
I'm just a stickup guy. I never graduated to nothing.
I can't imagine why.
this is a very compelling performance, Sam, but the fact is we found you with the gun you used to kill this woman right here.
you shot her in Hell's Kitchen.
any of this coming back to you?
what we can't figure out, though, is:
why did you hang Ellen White? Why not just shoot her, too?
who the hell is Ellen White?
look... that's not even my gun - I found the damn thing.
that's the lame-ass story you're gonna go with?
Yeah, it's the truth, actually.
look, I've been trying to go straight. Okay?
I got a job at a, uh, gym in Hell's Kitchen, but the owner just couldn't stop...busting my balls, so I quit.
I decided to hit this little bar I know on my way home, and, uh, she was dead when I found her.
so, why didn't you call the cops?
with my record? No. Hell, no.
look... I searched for a wallet.
I- I found none, so... I mean, I did take some jewelry.
look, it's not like she was going to need it. Okay?
and that's when I saw it. It was just... lying there.
lying. That's an interesting word choice.
Yeah, well, you know what? A free piece comes your way and you take it.
you ever visit the Manhattan Conservatory of Dance?
maybe last night?
last night?
I was with a lady friend, yeah.
so you can actually call her and ask her about that.
just make sure her husband's not around when you do.
we any closer to I. D.'ing our Jane Doe?
not yet. The tox results just came back.
there was a blend of chemicals in her system consistent with those found in antidepressants, but in a combination I've never seen before.
could be a cocktail.
Yeah.
I have a call in to a pharmaceutical company. Maybe they can help.
how's your search for the lab prankster going?
fine.
finally had a chance to process the crime scene this morning.
tested positive for methylene blue.
that's not going to narrow your list of suspects.
we all have access to that.
I also found something else.
okay... I think I see it.
Oh, it's there.
just not sure exactly what it is yet.
but I'll figure it out.
when I do, I'll be that much closer to exacting my revenge.
remind me never to get on your bad side.
is this a bad time?
no.
it meant a lot, you, um, opening up to me last night.
I wish it wasn't so hard for me.
Yeah, I know that.
but I want you to always feel you can come to me, be honest with me, no matter how hard it is.
I'm tougher than you think.
I know how tough you are.
I want to help you, Mac.
Hey, I got the...
sorry. Hey, Christine.
I can come back. - I- I was just leaving.
What...?
Oh, don't ask. It's a long story.
I got punked.
somebody thought it'd be funny to dye her eyes...
blue. I see!
it takes a few days to wear off. I know I look... ridiculous.
no, no. Not-not at all.
I'll call you later.
so... any word on Flack and Lovato's suspect?
they're still trying to track down his alibi.
but you're not convinced it's him?
doesn't makes sense.
he's a stickup man.
and even if he did kill our Jane Doe, why kill Ellen White in such a... theatrical way?
well, maybe if we knew who our Jane Doe was, we could establish a connection.
Sid found a drug in her system called Trihoxiphil.
I'd never heard of it before, so I did some digging.
it's an antidepressant, and it's currently in the human trial phase of FDA approval.
so how'd she get access to it?
I called the drug company.
they're currently working with a select group of psychiatrists nationwide, four of whom are in New York City.
you reach out to them? - Yes.
and only one of them has a patient whose description matches our Jane Doe.
her name is Lisa.
she's been a patient of mine since she was 16.
who did this to her?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
did she ever mention the name Sam Cross to you?
not that I recall.
is he the man responsible?
we're still trying to determine that.
right now, we just need to know as much about her as you can tell us.
did she mention anything in therapy?
anything that could aid us in the investigation?
I saw her just this week. Everything seemed fine.
what were you treating her for?
she suffered from bipolar disorder.
but our work together, plus this new trial drug, she'd never been better.
what about her home life? Did she live with family, a boyfriend?
she lived by herself.
Lisa came from a very privileged background, but...
she never wanted any help from her family.
as far as a boyfriend, she didn't have one - she was very guarded when it came to men.
I can check my notes from our last few sessions together.
it's possible I overlooked something.
that'd be very helpful.
Dr. Emerson.
did Lisa ever mention the name Ellen White to you?
Lisa Weston and Ellen White were both patients of Dr. Carly Emerson.
so, where's the doctor now?
she's back at her office gathering notes and files on both of the victims.
Flack and Lovato are meeting her there.
okay, so how does Sam Cross figure into all this?
he doesn't. His alibi checks out.
so, why is somebody targeting this doctor's patients?
tracked the seller of the antique revolver, and it wasn't easy because it was made back when the dinosaurs were roaming the earth.
ran the serial number.
now, problem was, you don't need a permit to buy and sell guns that were manufactured before 1899, so there was no record of the gun in any database.
however, after some masterful Internet sleuthing by moi,
I was able to track down the gun to the seller.
it was bought online two weeks ago by Dr. Carly Emerson, the psychiatrist of our two victims.
Dr. Emerson!
Dr. Emerson! NYPD!
clear.
she's gone.
maybe she never went back at all.
well, it looks to me like she was here.
I got Polaroids of Ellen White, the rope used to hang her and the Conservatory of Dance.
the victim, the weapon and the location. Got it.
so, what do you make of that?
someone's playing a game with us.
Mrs. White.
Conservatory.
with a rope.
Lisa Weston had red hair, and she was killed in Hell's Kitchen with a revolver.
Mrs. Scarlet in the kitchen with the revolver.
holy crap.
it's Clue.
six suspects. Nine rooms. Six murder weapons.
324 possibilities to deduce the killer.
Dr. Emerson may have bought the revolver, but I'm having a hard time believing she's a killer.
science would tend to disagree.
polaroids Flack recovered from the doctor's office had only one set of prints on them - hers.
but she's a doctor, well-respected in the community. She has no criminal record.
why, all of a sudden, would she start killing her patients? And like this?
right now, the why isn't as important as who's next.
four remaining suspects in the game, meaning four more potential victims.
we have an APB out on Dr. Emerson.
Danny and Lindsay are reaching out to her patients, but Ellen White's the only one whose name matches characters from Clue.
Lisa Weston did have scarlet-colored hair.
so, if it's not their name, it's something specific to them that connects to the game.
I'm guessing that pattern's going to follow.
to catch our killer, we're going to have to play the game with them.
so, according to the rules,
scarlet always moves first, followed clockwise by Colonel Mustard, then White and so on.
well, if our killer is following the order of players in the game, what happened to Mustard?
maybe the rules don't matter.
locations haven't been spot-on.
or there's a body out there that we don't know about.
I'll check the missing persons reports as well as the morgues for any unidentified DOAs.
scarlet, Mustard, White.
if the killings are going in order, Mr. Green would be next.
maybe we need to be focusing on her male patients.
vic's name is Shane Simmons. He's 19.
he was a patient of Dr. Emerson's for two years.
he had a full ride to Stanford on a golf scholarship, but he never went.
doc's files said it was too much pressure for him.
body's on a green, killed with a candlestick.
Yeah, I was trying to figure that out - what's the location?
the ballroom.
well, I'll give the doctor this - she's clever.
Thanks.
we got a pretty lengthy blood trail.
he was attacked somewhere else and dragged here.
employee found a set of keys still in the door handle, and the door was unlocked.
our vic was probably attacked when he came out to lock up last night.
and the laceration from the candlestick is on the back of his head, so he was hit from behind.
kid never saw it coming.
What'd you find out?
Simmons been working here for about six months.
he takes classes at Hunter during the day and comes here at night to work the late shift.
what time does the place close?
10: 00, but whoever locks up has to stay here long enough to get the course ready for the next morning.
emerson might have known his routine, that he'd be alone.
no witnesses. Just like the other vics.
except it's not like the other two vics.
how do you mean? - Our vic's a male.
now, we all like Emerson for this, and I buy her taking a shot at Scarlet and hanging White, but I don't know many women her size who could drag a dude his size from where he was attacked all the way across this course to that green over there.
she may have had someone helping her.
seriously, babe, how long you planning on wearing those sunglasses?
till I don't look like I'm a member of the Blue Man Group.
did you figure out what made those markings in Ballistics?
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I did.
so, whoever stained the microscope is a detective.
Adam and Hawkes don't have detective shields.
probably could take Mac out of the equation because, you know, joke is not really a part of his vocabulary.
you know, that just leaves you with Ms. Danville.
and you.
me?
think I would pull that kind of prank on... on my own wife?
let me see your badge.
you want to see my badge? - Yeah, let me see your badge.
what do you want to see my badge for?
let me see it. Give it to me.
all right, no stain. I'm looking for a blue stain.
I'm innocent.
you could have rubbed it off.
Oh, my God.
Lucy is going to be so jealous.
how does a whisker from a giant snow leopard in the Central Park Zoo end up on a dead body halfway across town?
I'm the primary zookeeper for the snow leopards.
so, does anyone else interact with them?
they can be temperamental animals.
anybody gets in that cage without proper training, that's when limbs start getting ripped off.
you recognize this guy?
no.
what about her?
doesn't look familiar. What is this all about?
we found a whisker from one of your, uh, snow leopards at a murder scene this morning.
you think one of my cats killed someone?
Mr. Hull, where were you last night?
me? I was here most of the night.
I've been staying late. One of my leopards is sick.
what time, uh, did you leave?
about 10: 00. Drove home, got a few hours of sleep and came back at 4: 00.
stop anywhere along the way?
no. Why are you asking me this?
do you mind if we take a look at your car?
I don't have it anymore.
I mean... I know that sounds suspicious.
I rented it. It's a Go Ride.
I pick it up when I need it, and I drop it off when I'm done.
what time did you drop it off?
uh, 10: 15. I don't know.
check with the company. They keep records.
Thanks.
somebody could have driven the car after him.
his name's Steve Davis.
he's been a patient of Dr. Emerson's since he was 13 years old.
what was he seeing her for?
OCD and depression.
so we subpoenaed Emerson's case files.
according to Davis's file, she stopped treating him two months ago.
what ended the relationship?
kid fell in love with her.
right, so she referred him to another colleague, but he never made an appointment.
says here he was taking escitalopram for the last six years.
Yeah, but not currently.
insurance company says that he hasn't filled that prescription in two months.
so he's off his meds.
turns out Davis rented the car from 11: 00 p. m. to 2: 00 a. m.
GPS coordinates put the car at Pier 25m 11ro f: 30 to 12: 45, right around the time our vic was killed.
and when we tracked down the Go Ride...
blood was a match to our victim, Shane Simmons - Mr. Green, killed with the candlestick.
NYPD! Open up!
all right.
we got a live one in here!
Where's Davis now? - I don't know.
did he say anything? Indicate who his next target may be?
he was over by the board, he rolled the dice, he said he had to finish the game.
mac, Jo, you guys need to check this out.
the first three murders are laid out on this board.
white with the rope in the conservatory, Scarlet with the revolver in the kitchen,
there's a knife in the library, but no token.
he's going after Plum.
the dice is rolled to five, you move Plum's piece...
goes right into the library.
between the public libraries, the schools and the loony-tune imagination this guy has, how the hell are we supposed to know who's next?
this might help.
looks like Davis was keeping a detailed schedule on all his victims.
there one for Plum?
it reads like a class schedule.
american Revolution, 10: 00 a. m.; Spanish-American War, 12: 00 p. m.;
and another American Revolution at 4: 00 p. m.
students don't repeat classes in the same day.
they don't, but professors do.
plum could be a real professor.
my fianc? s a professor at Chelsea University. That's his schedule.
Jo and I will take the front.
we'll start in the back, sweep forward.
come on.
all right, go.
let's go.
let me see your hands! Stand up!
turn around.
get out of here. Go, go.
building's clear. No sign of either of them.
I just got off the phone with the professor's T. A.
has not seen or heard from him since his last class ended.
that was 45 minutes ago.
maybe he took him off campus.
I don't think so.
we know Davis followed his victims, kept tabs on their schedule
scarlet in her neighborhood, White at dance, Green at work.
so it makes sense that they'd still be here.
then what are we missing?
Hastings Library, opened March 21, 1963.
but Chelsea University was founded in the late 1800s.
this wasn't the first library.
pull up the original map of the university.
got it.
we're looking for the location of the library.
looks like it used to be on the south side of the campus.
which is now a science building - Lawrence Hall.
drop the knife, Davis!
need a medic at Lawrence Hall right away.
okay, give me your hand.
right here.
police! Look out!
mac Taylor in the lounge with the Glock.
you just couldn't help yourself, could you?
I- I-I need to see Dr. Emerson.
Oh, you will, in court behind a stand as she's testifying against you for murdering three of her patients and nearly killing her fianc?
he's alive?
luckily.
you were in love with her.
that's why you went after him.
that's why she stopped seeing you.
did you get my letters?
I'm afraid that's what we need to talk about.
I- I meant every word of it.
okay, I'm-I'm not going to deny my feelings anymore.
I love you.
I think you're confusing your feelings for me.
no. I've never been more sure of anything.
my whole life, you're the only one who has ever given a damn about me.
you know that's not true; your parents love you.
no, they don't... they don't love me.
my mother loves her vacation home, and my father loves his French whores.
they don't... they don't love me.
Steve, I need you to understand, I don't have the same feelings for you.
I care for you, but as I do for all my patients, which is quite a great deal.
and you have a boyfriend.
Yes, and I know that one day you'll find someone who loves you like you deserve.
no, no, she... she turned her back on me, is what she did.
just like my parents, first sign of trouble and she just tossed me aside to become some other doctor's problem.
and Clue- how'd that figure in?
I thought you might like to play a game.
have a little fun while we get to know one another, break the ice.
you can choose whichever game you like.
she was Mrs. Peacock...
and I was Colonel Mustard.
what about her patients?
how'd you go about choosing them?
I broke into her office and I went through her files.
I picked three perfect patients, I followed them, I...
I learned their schedule.
I wanted to hurt her the way that she hurt me
by taking away the things that she loved most, but more than anything...
I wanted her to know that it was me doing it.
what- are you getting off?
you getting on?
you got some hot date I don't know about?
Yeah, taking my wife out to dinner tonight.
Oh, what's the occasion?
you don't need an occasion to take your wife out to dinner, do you?
it was you.
I knew it.
I said it was you.
Adam was supposed to be in Ballistics, not you, and...
well, why didn't you just tell me?
I don't know. I was going to tell you.
we were at the zoo, and you seemed so pissed, and we had to catch the killer, so I didn't.
so it was Messer in Ballistics.
with methylene blue.
can you forgive me?
it's almost gone.
this better be some dinner.
Hey, I thought we were meeting at your place.
I have something I need to say to you, and I didn't want it to wait.
I love you, Christine.
aren't you going to...
cleaning crew found him about an hour ago.
principal's on his way in now.
what was he doing here on a Saturday?
the SATs were this morning.
best guess, he was studying late last night, someone locked up without knowing he was here.
kid doesn't come home and his parents don't report it?
who knows what his home life was like?
blunt and sharp force trauma.
here's your murder weapon right here.
whatever happened, it's safe to say our perp didn't have much of a plan.
and our vic's was snuffed out.
no to the Post, no to the Daily News.
I'll have a comment when there's something to comment on.
those in the vic's backpack?
Yeah. Dextroamphetamines.
vic might have suffered from ADHD.
did have an I. D.though. Wallet was in the vic's backpack.
uh, Luke Stevenson, 81294.
what's the address?
1013 Kings Row, Brooklyn.
got called to a scene around 8: 00 last night.
when I got home, his door was closed.
I assumed he was asleep.
I knew he had the S. A.T. this morning.
I'm so sorry, Frank.
I can call your ex-wife.
no, I'll tell her.
she should hear it from me.
I don't understand.
he was such a good kid, you know?
you met him.
he never did anything wrong. Not a damn thing.
we don't know much right now, Frank. Is there anything you can tell me?
I don't know.
a week ago, his friend Nate, Nate Paulson, he OD'd mixing prescription meds with alcohol.
it was rough on Luke. But he seemed okay. We talked about it.
what kind of meds?
I don't know.
did Luke have ADHD?
attention deficit? No.
why are you asking me?
we found a bag of pills in his backpack. Dextroamphetamines.
they're used to treat... - I know what they're used for.
Luke didn't have ADHD.
is it possible he could have taken his friend's death harder than you think?
maybe he was having trouble dealing with...
they weren't his. - Frank.
they weren't his.
what... what are you telling me? That he was using them to get high?
that's not what I'm saying.
he was what?
that he was, uh, some drug addict, and I didn't even know about it?
Frank, just listen to me. That's not what I'm saying.
I don't know that.
kids use this stuff for all kinds of reasons. To study longer.
focus better on their exams.
with the S. A.T.'s coming up and college applications, he could have just been stressed, and...
no. No way.
not my boy.
Hey, it's me.
I figured you might still be sleeping.
red-eye probably knocked you out, huh?
I just wanted to hear your voice and see if you're doing all right.
you don't want to get into it, I know. I just thought...
I don't know what I thought. I just want to know that you're okay.
so call me back if you feel like talking, please.
say hey to your dad for me. All right?
I love you.
you ready?
I haven't even eaten yet.
eat in the truck.
come on, sleepyhead. Let's go.
okay, okay, okay.
I testified for Frank on numerous homicides. He would always talk about him.
always so proud of how he was doing.
he tried my first case on the job.
Luke was only a year old.
okay.
uh, nothing particularly unique to report, I'm afraid.
C. O.D. is as expected. Blunt and sharp force trauma to the head.
multiple blows, which suggests some kind of rage, perhaps.
I extracted a shard of the mug that lodged in the wound tract, among other, smaller pieces.
toxicology was completely clean.
uh, the same could not be said... - Hang on.
tox showed nothing?
no foreign substances detected.
but I pulled the autopsy report for Nate Paulson, like you asked.
he had in excess of 400 milligrams of dextroamphetamine in his system.
plus a blood alcohol level of. 24.
how long does dextroamphetamine stay in the system?
uh, the half-life is about, uh, ten hours, so depending on the amount taken and diet and metabolism, it would still be present anywhere from three to four days after ingestion.
something's not right. Luke had dextro in his backpack.
he was probably up all week, studying for the S. A.T.'s.
he was cramming for it when he was killed.
that's exactly when he would have the stuff in his system, so...
if he was using the pills as a study drug, why aren't they in his system?
I hate to say it, but if he was in possession of it but not using it...
he was selling it.
but where was he getting it from?
Hawkes, you have the plastic bag of dextro recovered from Luke's backpack?
Yeah, it's right here, Mac.
drop what you're doing. I need you to print the bag.
you got it.
he goes to our vic's school.
Frank was right.
the drugs weren't Luke's.
damn, kid.
do a wash, my man.
cab drivers smell better than this.
satisfied? You've gone through both my lockers.
can... can you just tell me what you're looking for?
I think you know what we're looking for.
actually, I don't, so can you please just tell me? Because I'm a little scared here.
obviously, this has something to do with Luke.
harvard would be lucky to have someone as smart as you.
what can you tell us about these?
Wh-where did... where did you find those? - Luke's backpack.
I thought it might have been him.
he-he stole those. From my locker.
you dealing, too?
he steal your stash? You guys get into an argument? Things get out of hand?
I take dextro and you jump to me dealing?
I'm not a drug dealer, sir. I - I have a prescription for those.
why were they in a plastic bag?
I'm not exactly looking to advertise that I have ADHD.
I - I don't... I don't need to be carrying a prescription bottle around school.
we know there's bad blood between you and Luke.
as recently as yesterday morning.
Luke, I saw you.
you were copying off my exam.
now, you know, if you get caught, it's my ass, too.
Hey, listen to me. I mean, if our answers are too similar...
get the hell out of my face, man.
what's wrong with you?
Hey, hey, break it up.
that's enough! That's enough, I said!
one of you better tell me what this is about.
and when Mr. Connors broke it up...
I mean, I could have ratted on him right there, but I didn't.
I kept my mouth shut. I considered Luke a friend.
can I go?
I mean, I'm already late for practice.
kid's pretty smooth. He's got an answer for everything.
too smooth.
see if his parents can confirm the prescriptions and subpoena his phone records.
get them to Adam.
if he's clean, I want to be able to tell Frank that we looked at everything.
rooster tail, huh?
worked when I was a kid.
I'm guessing the trout haven't wised up any.
any chance I can convince you to keep what you catch?
you know, pan-seared with a little garlic... - No.
what are you doing here, Linds?
what do you mean? You brought me out here.
no, home. What are you doing home?
what, you think I shouldn't have come?
come on. I love seeing you. You know that.
just wondering what you think you can accomplish by being here.
what do you mean, accomplish?
the way you feel about him.
the things you got going on inside of you.
you're still going to feel those same things tomorrow.
maybe.
is that why you brought me out here?
I just want to protect you, is all.
that's all any father wants.
boy, I tried, but you can't protect your daughter from everything.
eventually, the day comes when you have to pick her up off the ground after she skins her knee and tell her everything's going to be all right.
or wipe away the tears after some boy breaks her heart.
find the words to tell her her mother's gone.
but that's life.
I couldn't teach you everything, and you wouldn't even let me.
you have your own way of doing things, but...
I'm not that little girl anymore, Dad.
I haven't been for a long time.
and I know you're proud of me, but I know that you wish I didn't do what I do.
or see the things I see.
that innocence was gone a long time ago.
and I don't regret the choices that I've made, and I don't regret seeing the things I've seen.
you're an impressive young woman, Lindsay.
but you grew up so fast.
what I'm trying to say is, haven't you seen enough?
Oh, let me guess.
life is not measured by the breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away.
that's close. It's actually,"Where my party, p-party, party, p-party people at?
it's Nelly.
that would have been my second guess.
what's up with her?
blonde hair Hawkes recovered from the pocket watch. I ran it for DNA, but no hit.
however, it's, uh, badly damaged.
it's severely dry, had a split cortex, and also has a slight green tinge.
so, you're thinking it belonged to a swimmer.
exactly.
found traces of chlorine, copper, iron and manganese, all of which are found in a swimming pool.
the length and color are consistent with Melanie Rogers.
along with five other girls on the swim team, but only one of them was dating Nate Paulson.
the kid who OD'd on dextro and alcohol.
boom.
impressive last 50 meters.
Thanks.
I'm Jo Danville, crime lab. This is Detective Flack.
sorry to hear about your boyfriend, Nate.
Yeah.
and now, with what's happened to Luke, I bet it's been pretty rough.
I've had better weeks.
luckily, I have this to keep my mind off of it.
well, I'm going to need your mind to think about it just for a few more moments.
sorry. We found over 400 milligrams of dextro in Nate's system after he passed away.
he didn't pass away. He OD'd.
did you know he was taking it?
he was addicted to it.
one minute he was happy, the next depressed.
we fought about practically everything.
he wasn't the same person as when we first started dating.
do you know where he was getting it?
he was getting it from Luke, wasn't he?
did you blame Luke for Nate's overdose?
we have evidence that puts you at the crime scene, Melanie.
things get out of hand?
you're emotional. You blame him for Nate.
hit him in the head with the coffee mug.
you guys are sick. You know that?
I went to the library to see if Luke was all right.
he took Nate's death pretty hard. The watch was Nate's.
his grandfather gave it to him.
he carried it with him everywhere.
I thought Luke would want it.
I haven't even done anything yet.
how long has it been? - This thing stinks.
Lucy, how long has it been?
I don't know, like, five minutes.
that should be good. Right?
I - I don't know.
you didn't have a potato without these things growing out of it? Look.
who has the lighter? - What do you need a lighter for?
to sterilize the needle. - This is a bad idea.
I don't like this one bit.
Caroline, what are you doing?
I'm looking out. I'm keeping a lookout.
my mom and dad aren't even home. I told you that.
okay, good. Now give me the rubbing alcohol.
rubbing alcohol, too?
I just have to get the rust off of it.
Rust?! What the hell?!
I'm kidding. You just don't want it to get infected.
okay, Lucy. Hold the potato behind her ear.
one, two...
Fred goes to the video store on Broadway.
Fred, you are a moron. Online video, dude.
he buys three videos for $25." God, you're killing me.
this was $15 more than twice what he paid for a box of Goobers.
I would go with Raisinets, but whatever.
how much were the Goobers?
first of all, five bucks for chocolate covered peanuts?
second, isn't this kid in, like AP Calculus?
yo, you hear from Lindsay? - No.
what's all this?
uh, Billy Wharton's phone records. Text messages, actually.
uh, I didn't find any contact between him and Luke.
these are all basic algebra problems.
so, they're all like this? Solve for x, solve for y, two trains leave Grand Central?
Yeah, everything is fairly innocuous.
no sexting, nothing. It's pretty disappointing.
I would keep digging, because Mac's not done with this kid.
bet you're not loving the fact that you're the one with the surgeon's hands around here, are you?
don't get me started. What's up?
find anything in Luke's backpack that's related to basic algebra?
you know, word problems or anything like that?
no, not that I can think of.
uh, his notebooks are right there, if you want to take a look.
I need a coffee, huh?
you good? - Yeah, I'm good.
don't worry about it. Thanks.
Hey, Mac, you've got to read this.
check it out, right here.
open letter to the Times.
I am a student at Vernon Academy.
"I feel compelled to bring to light an epidemic "that is plaguing the school that I have attended since I was in kindergarten.
it involves the abuse of dextroamphetamines.
"I lost a close friend as a result of this, and it is incumbent upon...
it cuts off there.
so Luke wasn't selling the drugs.
he was going to blow the whistle.
he looks nervous.
he should be.
Luke was going public with the dextro abuse.
that's what the fight in the hallway was about, wasn't it?
he made the story up about Luke cheating off of him.
Luke confronts him, maybe gives him one last out to quit dealing.
Billy tells him to piss off.
this isn't just some casual lunch.
if Billy supplied these kids with dextro, and Luke was going to go public with the names, they all had a lot to lose.
I'll make sure I get their names.
is that Frank?
that's Frank.
what the hell are you doing, Frank?
this isn't good.
I'm going.
you want to tell me what you're doing here?
that son of a bitch killed my son.
we don't know that.
you hear me? We don't know that.
what's in your pocket? - Nothing.
take your hand out of your pocket.
listen to me, we don't even have proof that Billy was dealing.
Yes, we do.
I subpoenaed Billy's psychiatric records.
you don't have probable cause to do that, Frank.
judge Spencer owed me a favor.
Billy goes to four different psychiatrists.
he fakes the symptoms for ADHD, then he gets a prescription for dextroamphetamines from all of them.
that's where he gets the stuff from. Two of them he doesn't even...
I don't want to hear this.
judge Spencer owed you a favor?
what are you doing, Frank? Listen to yourself.
he killed Luke.
you're not only jeopardizing the investigation, you're risking your job.
now let us do what we do.
if Billy did this, we'll catch him.
the right way - no favors.
don't make me go to your bosses. Now, go home.
I'll call you later.
okay, ready? Pretend to make out with your latest crush.
Oh, Dillon. Oh, Dillon.
wait, Dillon?
Yeah. What's wrong with Dillon? He's cute.
he's got weird teeth- they're all crooked. - So?
and he wears all black. I think he's goth or something.
Ooh, you like bad boys, don't you?
maybe. Cowboys are boring.
you're up.
red. - R- E-D.
green. - G- R-E-E-N.
four.
truth. What was the last dream you had?
are you serious? That's so lame.
no, I want to hear this.
okay. You were all in it.
I dreamed that we were all seniors and we all had our driver's licenses.
linds, you had a convertible Trans Am.
a Trans Am? Ford F250, please.
and we all drove down to the reservoir to our spot.
we all had our acceptance letters, you know, for colleges.
and we opened them up...and we all got into different schools.
Oh, Caroline.
what the hell, Caroline?
your last dream, she said, not your last nightmare.
we're all applying to one school, and that's it.
and everyone's getting in. And everyone's going.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm requesting a transfer to NSA. - Approved.
I think I did it, Jo. - What exactly did you do?
I cracked his code.
whose code? - Billy's.
his phone was filled with these algebra problems sent to him by other students.
they're way too easy to be actual questions from students that are this smart.
Ugh, I was never very good at these.
the questions are a request for dextroamphetamines.
and the answer is how many they want?
so, Billy is dealing.
Yeah, and the details are all here. Check this out.
Jack goes to the driving range.
means the deal is going to go down at the driving range, most likely Chelsea Piers.
buys a bucket of 312 balls.
I mean nobody buys a bucket of 312 balls. Your arm would fall off.
so, the deal is going to go down at 3: 12.
if Jack hits 78 balls in an hour, how many hours will it take for him to hit all 312?
okay, well, all right. So, the answer... don't tell me.
the answer is 312 divided by 78.
four. - There you go.
that means this person wants four pills.
but how do you know who the person is?
well, this one was sent by...
you lied to me, Melanie.
I didn't lie.
you let us believe that Luke was supplying students with dextroamphetamines when you knew all along it was Billy who was selling.
it's not just Billy.
I can name 20 people, right now, that sell the stuff.
it's so easy to get.
most of them have legitimate prescriptions or they just go into a shrink, stare out the window, and say they're having a hard time focusing in school.
why are you taking it? Such a smart girl.
because it works.
b - pluses don't cut it anymore.
not when you're trying to get into the top schools.
dextro makes you focus, study longer. It works.
like it worked for Nate?
if you got caught, you were jeopardizing your whole future.
everything you'd worked so hard for.
you had a lot to lose if Luke went public and named names.
I didn't kill Luke. - Then who did?
all I know is Billy said he would take care of it.
I'm not seeing him, Adam. You've got to help me out here, man.
you should be right on top of him.
well, maybe that's the problem. I'm right on top of him, he's on street level.
that I can't help you with. But the signal indicates...
I got him.
yo!
heads up.
stop! Police!
heads up! Heads up!
look out!
that's it. It's over. That's it!
that one. I'd go to that one.
the really bright one straight ahead.
that's the North Star.
you know because the Big Dipper points to it. See?
do you think you'll ever leave here?
Montana? And go where?
Yeah, I don't know. Anywhere.
no. I like it here.
I will. One day.
I like how big it is out there.
you heading over?
Yeah.
well, you know where I stand on this, but...
you're my daughter, and I love you.
if you want me to go with you... I'll go with you.
I love you, too, Dad.
I've got to do this on my own.
so how are things going with Dr. Renway?
or Dr. Overbrook. Or...
Dr. Parkston. Or Dr. Gleeson.
selling dextroamphetamines is a felony, Billy, and you're looking at I don't even know how many counts.
but I'm guessing Harvard will not be impressed with your entrepreneurial skills.
you sold to Nate Paulson, didn't you?
didn't matter how much he wanted, or how out of control his addiction was, you just kept selling to him.
and Luke blamed you for his death, that's what the fight was about, wasn't it?
he told you he was going to bthlow e whistle.
but you nipped that in the bud, huh?
you found him in the library.
let me guess: you want a lawyer.
no. I want to trade.
trade? Trade what?
Mr. Connors.
what are you doing with these?
we use them as study aids.
I mean, to focus, to stay up late. Not to get high or anything.
we?
half the school uses them. Your, your champion debate guys.
the prized pupils at the front of the class.
ever wonder how all those B-pluses turn to A's?
so, now what?
nothing. Get out of here.
you were able to pull those off the murder weapon?
Yeah. Infrared images.
there were too many cracks to see a usable print with powder.
but as you can see, even with infrared, there's too much separation and breaks within key points.
it would never hold up in court.
how are you with Photoshop?
build the missing ridges and print it out for me.
maybe we won't need it to hold up in court.
the one who got away.
a lot of nerve showing up here.
I'm guessing you've got something to say, so why don't you have a seat, huh?
how much money did you get out of the cash register that day?
how much?
I want to know how much those lives were worth to you.
this is going to be a disappointing little discussion.
for both of us.
you were at the trial.
you heard me then, hear me now.
it wasn't me.
you I. D.'d the wrong guy.
right.
Yeah, I read your appeals.
they're all based on the unreliability of a single eyewitness.
16 years go by, you waltz into that courtroom and point your finger at me? Please.
I feel sorry for you.
I do.
why did you come here?
what is it that you want, huh?
absolution?
you want this off your conscience?
you came to the wrong place, little girl.
all these years.
all the appeals.
all the denials.
what if we argue this? What if we argue that?
you still can't state the simple truth.
you've had quite a year, Mr. Connors.
2011 Teacher of the Year.
and awards for excellence from New York universities honoring high school teachers.
one for $5, 000.
coach of the debate team champions.
some would think you deserve a raise.
the administration did.
I've been very fortunate, yes. But it also was a lot of hard work.
I'm sure it was.
I don't doubt that you're a damn fine teacher.
but you have a responsibility that transcends good grades and churning out Ivy League students.
you have a responsibility to safeguard the welfare of the kids who walk these halls.
I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at.
Oh, I think you do.
we had a chat with Billy Wharton.
Luke. What has gotten into you, son?
what the hell was that all about?
he knows. - Knows what?
that I sell my stuff. He says it's gone too far.
he's going to go public, to the Times or something.
what exactly did he say? - I don't know.
but you better fix it.
because if I go down, you're going down with me.
you couldn't afford to let Luke go to the media with his story.
I didn't touch Luke.
no. But you did touch this.
I just wanted him to consider how many lives would be affected if he went forward with this.
Luke, consider what you're doing, son.
don't call me "son.
Billy told me that you know. - It's more complicated than that.
no. No, it isn't.
you should have said something a long time ago.
and I should have said something.
they'll fire me. I'll lose my job.
I have a family. A daughter.
you should have thought about that before.
I'm begging you, son. Don't do this.
I've been at this school for 12 years.
I've known you since you were in kindergarten.
think of the other students. The futures that are at stake.
what about Nate? What about his future?
I have to live the rest of my life with the guilt of... of not saying anything.
and so should you.
don't pretend you're concerned about your students.
the only future you were concerned about was your own.
I'm sorry.
Daniel Katums, do you have any last words?
I'm sorry for what I've done.
you messed with the wrong guy.
get off me.
no... move, man!
the curse of building 913.
and Everett Harrington Wentworth.
I never believe urban legends, but this one I'm buying.
our vic is the 37th bizarre death connected to this address since Wentworth himself jumped from the penthouse in 1929.
they say the building was cursed on that very day.
Wentworth lost all his money in the crash of the market.
distraught, he leapt to his death.
his beloved girlfriend, Wilma Ashton...a stunning blonde...
watched his fatal leap, then killed herself.
she was found lying in a pool of her own blood.
many believe their ghosts roam the floors.
anything paranormal, or otherwise, upstairs?
I had a couple unis look around for a beautiful blonde, but no luck.
the penthouse apartment is used as a haunted tourist attraction during the day, and a club at night.
it closes around 2: 00 a. m.employees finish locking up about 3: 00, 3:30.
Hey, Sid, how come they only ever call you out to the really strange ones?
they... didn't call me.
uh, this is one I was not going to miss.
witnesses on the ground report that our vic fell from above.
the heard a roar, looked up, saw him mid-plunge.
this cabdriver parked here to get a cup of coffee.
luckily, he missed all the excitement.
no idea where exactly our victim was when he fell?
no, but I'm collecting surveillance from all the cameras in the vicinity and inside the building.
1920s attire. A leather mask.
in tribute, uh, Wentworth was the Gatsby of his time.
uh, made his fortune in leather goods.
he was scarred from a disease.
allergy to the sun, I believe.
covered his face with intricately-designed leather masks.
so our victim was fascinated with Wentworth's story and decided to commit suicide the exact same way?
or, he was drunk at the steam punk party, decided he needed some fresh air, woops, accident, not a suicide?
I've already eliminated both those options.
it's murder.
laceration of the carotid artery.
and, no protruding glass or metal to suggest it happened from the impact.
and I wouldn't give up your search for that beautiful blonde, Flack.
lipstick kiss.
my guess is she's alive and well.
and could be our killer.
well, uh, blunt force trauma resulting in a fissure fracture of the skull, and possibly the fracture of every other bone in his body.
is there any evidence that our killer pushed him after he stabbed him?
well, with the victim in this condition, it'll be difficult to tell if there was any kind of a...struggle.
what? What is it?
well, look at his face.
he doesn't look like he fought the fall.
he could've been disoriented as a result of the stabbing, lost consciousness, then, he just fell.
you can tell all that by just looking at him?
well, it's not based on any published scientific research, just something over the years that I've learned to see in the victims that have been on my autopsy table.
reminds me of Evelyn McHale.
she was only 23 years old.
in 1947, she jumped to her death from the observation deck of the Empire State Building.
landed on top of a limousine.
she was clutching her pearl necklace when they found her.
Oh, is that that famous picture from Life magazine?
Yes, uh, they called it "the most beautiful suicide
in the photo, she looked so peaceful.
Lindsay, are you okay?
Why?
you just look a little piqued.
no, I'm fine.
I got a little, uh, info on our vic.
he dresses as Everett Wentworth and takes pictures with the tourists and the club patrons.
anybody want to come in? Anybody? Anybody?
you guys? Hey, come on in.
well, that could explain the lipstick on his cheek.
he got a name?
that seems to be the hard part.
guys at the security desk know him as Jason... just Jason...
so they sent me upstairs to the folks who run the tours and nightclub, and they know him as Jake, no last name.
and, until ten minutes ago, everybody thought he worked for the building.
so, we got nothing.
we got no paperwork, no background info, no permit. No identity.
so our Everett Wentworth is a John Doe.
anything on the prints from Sid's ten card, Adam?
no hits in AFIS. The vic is still a John Doe.
what's all this?
Ah, this stuff was found inside the hidden pocket on the vic's jacket.
our vic was a pickpocket.
loser.
look, I-I-I I'm sorry, that's inappropriate and unprofessional; I'm not supposed to have an opinion, but, that guy was out there taking pictures with tourists, innocent tourists, while he was stealing from them.
pictures, pictures. You two want to take a pic?
Yeah.
ready?
good? One, two, three.
thank you. See you, guys.
Bye.
wallets, watches, jewelry, phones. Loser, okay?
and he was getting away with it.
or maybe not.
maybe that's what got him killed, Adam.
turn on all these phones, track them to their owners.
cross-reference any info you get with registered guests in hotels.
see if any of the jewelry or watches have serial numbers.
look for I. D.'s in the wallets.
check to see if anything was reported stolen.
as of right now, every one of these people is a suspect.
and start with whoever owns this phone.
I want a name and address as soon as possible.
I know it's you and I'm coming after you!
I'm here to pick up shirts for my son. It's under Jo Danville.
thank you.
those are a little bright. Are you trying to stop traffic?
you're right, I should just go with something safe.
well, you should always try it on first.
make sure it looks good with your eyes.
why are you following me?
uh, I'm not following you.
you were at the coffee shop 15 minutes ago.
you ordered herbal tea, completely gave you away.
15 minutes before that, you were at a bus stop right in front of my apartment.
um, pleasant coincidence?
no.
what's your name?
I suppose any other woman my age would be flattered, assuming that she's got the attention of a very attractive younger man.
but I'm a little bit smarter than that.
you should know that I am a first-grade detective, a sworn federal marshal, former FBI agent, which makes me highly suspicious and acutely observant.
so, once again, you want to tell me why you're following me?
um... I'm not sure what to say.
I'm carrying a gun.
all right.
I'll tell you if we can go someplace quiet. But public.
and you promise not to shoot me.
deal.
looks like our vic fractured every bone in his body.
thoracic and pelvic injuries suggest that our victim fell from a distance of more than 18 meters, but less than 30.
that's somewhere between the sixth and tenth floors of the building.
was he dead before the fall?
he was dead before the impact. He drowned, so to speak.
blood from the lacerated artery flooded his lungs on the flight down.
exactly.
I collected trace from the neck wound. A powdery black substance.
and several black flecks.
hopefully, analysis of these will get us somewhere, along with trace I collected from the clothing.
the wound track help determine the type of knife used?
it was very odd.
no hilt mark was evident, and the tissue is jagged at the surface as well as within the wound.
suggests the murder weapon has an uneven blade, if it has a blade at all.
and that wasn't my only discovery.
this was in the victim's mouth.
it looks like a page of newspaper.
a message from the killer?
I know it's you, I'm coming after you"?
this is your phone, right?
well... yeah. I threatened him, but I wanted to send a clear message to whoever it was that stole it, that I wanted it back.
where were you last night, Calvin, around 1: 00 in the morning?
I can't remember.
Really?
you know, uh... where this surveillance footage was taken?
no, I don't.
do you know what elevator that is?
I'm guessing the elevator in my hotel. - That's a bad guess.
this is surveillance footage of your mug heading up the elevator to a nightclub- at Building 913.
around 1: 00 a. m. Were you looking for revenge?
no, I was...I was looking for a girl. All right?
I met her a couple nights ago, we hit it off, we agreed to meet at the club.
only I didn't have my phone to find out she stood me up. Okay?
Yeah, I was a little pissed, and I sent that message.
but what law is there that says a guy can't be a little peeved?
did he just say "peeved"? - Peeved.
that little masked man was pestering me on the street and it really ticked me off.
it's got to be when he lifted my phone.
and what'd you do about it? - Nothing.
you know what, Calvin? You've got to tune into a couple cop shows.
these days, there's surveillance cameras all over the city.
take a look at that.
Hey, man, get back.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
just go.
I can't believe this.
okay. Yeah. I got mad, but I didn't kill nobody.
there's only one problem, Calvin. We have a dead guy.
and we have footage of you going up that elevator, - but not down.
I took the stairs. There were too many people waiting in line, it would've taken forever.
you took the stairs 94 floors?
burned off the booze, man.
you're in shape, huh?
got anybody who can back that story up?
look... I came to New York to have a good time. Okay?
I leave tomorrow.
I have no phone, my hotel stinks, and I didn't have any fun, if you know what I mean.
besides, like I said before, I didn't kill nobody.
it's very clear to me that I'm the victim here.
I've been trying to meet you for a long time.
that part's accomplished.
I don't really even know where to start.
beginning, I guess.
I was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
roll Tide! I'm from Alabama.
I went to undergrad in Tuscaloosa.
but you know that, don't you?
did we meet before? - No.
do we have mutual friends? - No. Not exactly.
eight years ago, I was diagnosed with a heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
um, it was very hard for my heart to pump blood and I was extremely sick.
well, you look very healthy now.
that's because three years after my condition was discovered, on September 13, I was given a donor heart.
a very successful transplant.
an incredible match, and a healthy donor.
that was you? - Yes.
you got her heart? - Yes.
and I've been trying to find out who she was, and what she was like.
I didn't mean to follow you today.
your office said you weren't in, and you were coming out of your apartment,
I...didn't exactly know how to approach you.
just... trying to get up the nerve, I guess.
and now I'm hoping I haven't made a big, giant selfish mistake.
you have my sister's heart.
I'm sorry.
is it hot in here?
it's like the vent's not blowing or something.
I mean, it's warm in here, right?
Really?
sequins.
we gotta check every floor?
no, no. We're not gonna check every floor.
if you'd do your homework and read the reports, Adam,
Sid's autopsy suggests that our vic fell somewhere between the sixth and tenth floors.
you didn't read Sid's autopsy.
Nah, I didn't read it. But Mac filled me in.
that's how I do it.
let's go.
looks like this floor's the one.
blood on the glass.
on the wall here.
this could be our primary crime scene.
how tall's our vic?
there's a void here. All right.
the arterial spray suggests that the attacker was facing him.
the attacker slices his throat, blood spatter goes all over the killer, on the back of the door.
and the void suggests that the attacker and the vic are roughly the same height.
so the stabbing happened here.
the blood trail indicates that our victim moved in this direction.
then he staggered over to the edge, and...yeow...
I know. I mean, but the blood pool is right here.
so he dropped here. Nowhere near the edge.
I've got partial footprints all the way to the door from the blood pool.
they're not our vic's. So they got to be our killer's.
but why would the killer come all the way back here after he stabbed him?
he wanted to make sure he's dead.
or... he wanted to leave a message.
the vic tried to stay alive, Adam.
he got to his feet.
he had no idea he was close to the edge.
that's no way to go.
Hey, Jo.
thank you.
I never stopped to think about who got Leanne's heart.
I was just so preoccupied with my anger toward the guy that hit her.
drunk driver. It was raining.
I was in Virginia at the time.
then Mama called.
mama, what is it?
Jo, it's Leanne.
you got to come home, honey. She's not gonna make it.
Jo, you got to come home.
she was gone before I even made it out of my driveway.
wow, we were just all so consumed with grief, and all the while your family, thrilled that Leanne was a match.
she saved my life.
how did you find me?
how did you know I was her sister? How did you know Leanne was your donor?
I kind of put two and two together.
a nurse said that there was a car accident.
the heart came from a woman.
I knew the date, September 13. It was even a Friday.
and, uh, I knew how quickly they had to transport the heart from the donor to the recipient.
so you searched the newspapers, looking for accidents.
you must have known before now.
I did.
how do you walk up to someone and say to them that you have the heart of someone they lost, someone they loved?
what do you do, Grant? - I'm a professor.
joined the faculty at Memphis University. I teach physics.
are you married?
no. Got engaged once.
I got cold feet.
leanne never married. Never even made it to the church.
daddy was so mad; he'd spent all his money.
she was right. That guy was a creep.
are you a good man, Grant?
I think so.
when you woke up from the transplant surgery, what was the first thing that you remember?
a bright warm light.
and then a woman's smiling face.
your mama.
no.
it was a face I didn't know, and now that I see you, I think it was your sister.
Hey, are you okay? - Who, me?
Yeah, you. - Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
you looked a little, um... - Perplexed.
well, that's not the word I was going to use, but...
well, the crumpled paper that Sid found in the victim's mouth, it came from the Chelsea Voice Weekly.
so that's all I've got, uh, but I'm hoping to make a connection to our victim, that can lead us to our killer.
so I probably shouldn't be standing around here chatting with you, you know what I mean?
okay. You need help?
no. No. No.
Hey, you owe me ten bucks.
I just saw Lindsay.
no, she didn't say anything. I just know I'm right.
I know I am.
no, Christine, I'm not going to come right out and ask her.
what kind of proof?
all right. I'll get you proof.
we still on for dinner tomorrow night?
great.
I love you, too.
Bye.
you cooking something or should I say burning something in here, Sheldon?
what do you get if you combine carbon, polymer, fatty acids and chicle?
let's see. Polymer is some kind of plastic.
fatty acids could be almost anything, but based on the smell in here, I'm guessing it's a kind of food.
the carbon is associated with fire, chicle is gum.
we're gonna be here all day if I try guessing exactly where you're headed here.
it's our murder weapon.
plastic, fatty acids, and gum? That doesn't sound too dangerous.
those were all components that were detected in the trace Sid collected from the victim's stab wound.
trace left by the knife.
which would suggest the knife was man-made.
Mm-hmm, and it was created by first using an AA battery and a foil gum wrapper.
the creation of a spark.
Ah, the gum wrapper was the source of our chicle.
you attach the foil side to the battery's positive and negative charge at the same time, you get a spark that starts a fire.
exactly.
the question is why would someone need to start a fire that way?
well, most likely someone who didn't have access to matches or a lighter.
both easily accessible unless...
you're in a prison cell. - Yeah.
the murder weapon was a handmade shank.
and I believe I know the recipe.
a pile of corn chips represents the fatty acids.
start a spark, ignite a napkin or toilet paper.
the oils in the chip serve as a slow burning fuel source.
the burn is the carbon.
the black soot trace found in the wound.
polymer is a plastic.
a plastic fork or toothbrush.
in our case, the killer used a coffee cup to-go lid.
the black flecks Sid found in the wound.
molded over heat in the shape of the blade.
submerge it in water, it instantly hardens.
file it down, repeat the process and you have a murder weapon.
all of these are items that are accessible to inmates.
our killer is an ex-con.
and hell-bent on revenge.
mac, I give up. I surrender.
I have nowhere else to turn.
what did Danny do now?
no, this time it's work.
the crumpled piece of paper that Sid found in our victim's mouth...
front page.
chelsea Voice Weekly. February 6, 2011.
right, so the big question is what's the significance, right?
there's an article about art.
there's an article about a music festival, a Valentine's Day benefit.
none of it has anything to do with our victim.
of course, he's still a John Doe, so I could be staring at the answer and I wouldn't know it.
Oh, we were staring at it and didn't even know it.
that's exactly what I just said.
we assumed the phones inside the hidden pocket of the suit jacket were taken from tourists.
