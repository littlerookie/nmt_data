cylindrical weapon, about an inch in diameter.
consistent with a pipe?
Yeah. In fact, check this out.
thread pattern's consistent with the end of a pipe.
he's got no defense wounds.
Yeah. My guess, he never woke up.
CAVALIERE: You're not fooling me, kid.
the second I laid eyes on you, I knew how it went down.
you took a pipe from the backyard, you went into Ty's bedroom, and while he was sleeping, you beat his brains to a pulp.
now, what the hell's wrong with you, kid?
your little other is dead.
what did he ever do to you?
now, don't look at him. He can't help you.
nobody can help you. You're going to prison.
at 14, that means life.
I'm talking to you, you little...!
detective...
can I have a word with you outside, please?
we don't have enough evidence to suggest that that boy killed his brother.
what are you getting at?
I'm saying I'm not sure if threatening him is the right tactic right now.
I found no blood on his clothes.
the screen door could have been the point oentry.
I mean, have you considered asking him what he heard or-or saw before you just put the full court press on him?
I don't tell you how to collect the evidence.
no, you don't. Look, there's no disrespect here, okay?
we're all on the same team.
then get to the lab and get me something that I can use.
Hey.
Hey. Call me a geek, but background subtraction application software is the bomb.
only geeks still say "the bomb."
but it you ask me, geeks should be revered.
OK. Um, the technology's pretty new.
okay, check it out.
so the fingerprint is blood-red--that's the shade we use for the color identifier.
and now the preprogrammed algorithm is just removing all the other colors from the fabric, and we're left with just the print. It's...
mind if I watch?
voyeur, huh?
I like that.
geek.
Wow. Yeah.
right.
scan this into I-AFIS, and here we go.
got yourself a hit.
Jesse Acheson. 38.
multiple convictions, cocaine possession, intent to sell.
in and out of prison for the past... seven years.
was he in or out on May 12, 1999?
out.
what about last night?
released six months ago. Living in Henderson.
geeks rule.
woman: Who is it?
Las Vegas Police.
we're looking for Jesse Acheson.
Hey, look, my husband hasn't used since he got out of the joint, so whatever you think he did, you're wrong.
do you know where he is?
no idea.
well, your marriage is just full of romance, huh?
may we come in?
Nah, I don't think so.
just one more question.
do you happen to know where he was last night?
no. I, uh, I haven't seen him in days.
thank you.
that was fun.
you guys get in your cars, drive around the block.
pick me up in five minutes.
we'll be close.
Jesse, cops were just here.
what the hell's going on?
no, I didn't tell them where you are!
I don't know where the hell you are!
when are you coming home?
damn you!
the shoe impression outside Ty's window matches the brother's.
Yeah, I got a hair off of Ty's T-shirt.
also consistent with Matt.
either of which could be related to the murder or just a result of two brothers living together.
Yeah.
uh, blue fibers.
got them off the vic's T-shirt.
nobody in the family was wearing anything blue.
no, but you know, could be from a blanket, a carpet, towel.
I'll take them to Trace.
Hey, I am concerned that Detective Cavaliere's moving ahead of Forensics on this one.
he can move as fast as wants.
the D. A. won't file without the physical evidence.
right now, we got nothing.
Sandra Acheson called her husband at exactly 3: 03 p. m. today.
I secured a 2703-D court order for the number she was calling.
it was a cell phone.
I contacted the cell phone company and found out that Jesse answered his phone near Tower 8, phase West.
given the signal strength, he was within two blocks of the tower.
his wife said that she hasn't seen him in several days, so I had Homicide check registration at all the hotels within the yellow area.
he is booked at the Tangiers.
well done.
get this, the rapist's semen came back positive for cocaine.
we don't usually run a panel for semen, Greg.
I know that, but given our suspect's priors for blow, I had a tech run an immunoassay specific to the drug.
Wow. You guys are rendering me obsolete.
so, Jesse gets coked up, he commits the crime, he drives down to the Strip and he checks into the Tangiers.
the Gift Show's in town.
there aren't any vacancies on the Strip.
well, his wife said that she hadn't seen him in a few days.
maybe he's back in the game again, selling coke to out-of-town businessmen from the comfort and security of his hotel room.
so, he takes a break from his job, rapes and kills the vic at another hotel, and then goes back to work?
even cokeheads need a diversion now and then.
Hi, Stokes. Solve the case?
I'm getting there.
nothing definitive as of yet, which means you can't hold Matt Hawkins for longer than his 24 hours.
Really? Well, you know, uh...
I got a signed confession.
Really? Mm-hmm.
sort of kicks the crap out of your "evidence," now, doesn't it?
he confessed? Signed. Check.
did you beat it out of him?
no, I used science, kind of like you guys.
mm, how's that?
I put him on a Computer Voice Stress Analyzer.
on I caught him lying, he gave it right up.
that device has been discredited for years.
well, check their Web site.
it's still used in 1, 400 state and local agencies.
well, not in Las Vegas.
or anywhere else in this state.
say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession?
he didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.
long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.
he tell you why he did it?
no, but he will.
Hey, listen, Stokes, thanks for trying to help, but we got him.
okay.
so, I just got back from the Tangiers.
the GM won't let us into Jesse Acheson's room without a search warrant, and the judge denied our request.
I'll talk to the judge.
I'll bring Acheson in for questioning, I guess.
could you just keep him under surveillance for now, let Greg tag along with your guy?
we might learn something.
sure, I'll get him a bag of donuts.
I was testifying today.
I ran into the D. A.
he filled me in on your case.
looks like Matt Hawkins' confession is gonna stand up in court.
suspects are tricked into confessing all the time, but I'm telling you, Cavaliere intimidated that boy.
man, he would've signed anything.
so you think he's innocent?
could be. I checked the crime stats for the Hawkins neighborhood.
there's been a rash of nuisance calls.
sounds like a suspect.
I'm gonna go back out there, see if the Hawkins know anything about it.
need some help?
you got that kind of time?
I'll meet you in the car.
Thanks, Warrick.
woman: You expect me to invade Mr. Acheson's privacy based upon a five-year-old fingerprint that was manipulated on a computer?
it wasn't manipulated-- it was processed.
that's what we do. Try getting that one past a defense attorney.
it's one thing to send a print through AFIS;
it's another thing to use a "background subtraction algorithm" to isolate the print from a bedspread.
it's not my fault that the courts lag behind our technology.
Gil, I'm sympathetic to your request, but if I grant a warrant based upon this print, and the print is later thrown out of court, then everything you find as a result of it would be excluded, and your pattern rapist could be back on the street.
give me something else-- I'll be happy to grant you a warrant.
your Honor, I need the warrant in order to find something else.
you'll find another way.
kind of like bird-watching, ain't it?
I wouldn't know.
you bored?
I'm bored.
so, I got a question.
I hear the killer completely wiped down the crime scene.
so why do you think he left his semen behind?
could've worn a condom.
well, before committing a crime, a typical serial rapist will often masturbate to his perfect rape-murder fantasy.
didn't wear a condom then, didn't want to wear one during the act.
besides, the DNA isn't on file.
it wasn't much of a risk.
litterbug.
CSIs don't mind the bugs.
if the DNA on this cup matches the seminal DNA, Grissom won't need a warrant.
we'll be making an arrest.
we're not unfit parents.
please, we just want to speak with our son.
we called the detective, but no one will tell us anything.
right now your son's under investigation.
what? Yeah, the detective asked him if he wanted a parent or advocate present at the interrogation.
he's 14 years old, so it's his right to say no.
but he's just a kid.
I mean, he just lost his brother.
YVONNE: Matt's sensitive.
he doesn't handle stress well.
if we-we-we could just talk to him.
he may need a change of clothes.
were those his clothes in the washer?
Yeah.
OK, we'll see what we can do about getting him something to wear. In the meantime, if you could just answer the question.
you want to know about that homeless guy?
Yeah. He's nuts.
he-he scared the boys once or twice, but...
how did he scare them?
ty saw him writing something on the window.
was it "Brat"?
Yeah.
I chased him away.
cleaned off the window.
that would explain the shoe impressions outside the bedroom window.
you're thinking that that guy had something to do with what happened?
well, that's what we're trying to find out.
Oh, God. I knew we should've called the cops.
when was the last time that you saw him?
martin: I jog through that park every evening.
um, he's got this, uh... makeshift tent thing set up by the playground.
what? Hey! Stop it! Come on!
get up! Let me... let me go!
let go of me! Stop it!
Hey, what's your name? What?
tell the gentlemen your name.
Walter! My name is Walter!
Walter, that's a nice blue sweater.
Where'd you get it?
what? I said I like your sweater-- where'd you get it?
it's mine! Oh, it's yours?
Yes, this is my sweater!
whose blood is it on your sweater, Walter?
we're gonna give you a nice warm place sleep tonight, partner.
stokes: Suspicion of murder.
WALTER: No! No!
easy with the sweater.
it's evidence.
so, I processed the DNA from the coffee cup, and it turns out that there were two contributions on the lip, which means that your coffee shop recycles, and not in the good way.
gross.
bad news is that neither of the contributions is consistent with the semen that was recovered from the crime scene.
if Acheson didn't rape Sue Stein, what is his print doing on the bedspread?
well, I certainly didn't kill anyone, and...
I do not know how my fingerprint got there.
we don't think.
we simply want to know how your fingerprint ended up at a murder scene five years ago.
look, Jesse, we appreciate you coming down here voluntarily, but if you clam up, we're gonna have to file an obstruction of justice charge, and that's not good... for you.
let's make it easy on yourself.
what were you doing in Sue Stein's hotel room?
you won't believe me.
brass: Try us.
I did go to see Sue that night.
sue.
come on, girl, wake up.
you just took off?
you didn't bother to report a murder?
ma'am, I... I got a record, and I was on probation.
if I'd done all of that, I'd have been...suspect numero uno.
brass: All right, let's cut to the chase.
you were there to sell her blow, right?
I don't need a lawyer, right?
I mean, it's off the record?
we're just having a little chat here.
that's why she left the door unlocked.
we'd been doing it that way for years.
whenever Sue came to town, I always took care of her.
I'm really sorry.
she was my friend.
I wish I could be more help.
Stokes. Hey, man.
what the hell are you doing?
are you trying to screw with my case? I'm just following the evidence, and it led me to another suspect.
I think you're gonna want to talk to him in the interest of justice.
what, are you trying to help the defense now?
you know any good defense is gonna bring up a "rush to judgment" here. Come on!
Chris, you put another interviewed suspect on your list.
it shows due diligence.
let's go.
your sweater's been analyzed, Walter.
found bloodstains from a murdered boy on it.
it's not my sweater.
you already told me it was yours.
finders keepers.
it wasn't always mine, though.
where did you find it? On a bench.
by the basketball courts.
I was cold.
Hey, man...
if you're lying...
I'm not lying.
I'm not lying!
so when did you find it?
yesterday.
no, um, a few days ago.
I don't remember.
put him in lockup-- maybe it'll help his memory.
I got a signed confession.
you got a bum in a bloody sweater.
what are you gonna do about it?
Hey, Catherine. Yeah?
DNA finished up with the blue sweater and I processed it.
anything probative?
I ran it under the UV light and out popped one of those invisible dry cleaner ID stamps, you know?
yeah?
I called the dry cleaner, they gave me a name.
Mr. Hawkins, is that your sweater?
Yeah...it looks like my sweater.
Where'd you find it?
did you give it away?
no, but I haven't seen it in a while, though. Why?
it's got Ty's blood on it.
do I need a lawyer?
that's your call, sir.
you called me?
Yeah, Mia sent me that wad of hair that you pulled out of the hotel drain.
it's coated in bleach.
I'm think the killer must've poured the stuff down the drain.
really compromised the trace.
that's it? A compromised wad of hair?
no, I called you to discuss the bleach.
the hairy wad smelled a bit woodsy to me, which is odd, considering it should only smell like bleach.
you sniffed it?
that disgust you?
no, actually, it's the first time you've ever done anything to impress me.
anyway, um, I analyzed the bleach.
it contains a cedar additive.
thought you'd want to know.
Thanks, David.
sure, Gil.
man: I'm more than happy to help you in any way I can in your investigation.
I got your phone call about the scent of our bleach.
I figured you should to talk to Lucy.
Lucy is our head of housekeeping.
the guests sometimes complained about the bleach smell after we cleaned the bathrooms.
a few years ago,
I started adding cedar chips to the bottles.
makes it smell better.
Lucy, who else has access to your bleach?
just the maids.
are they all female?
Yes.
you park your carts in the hallway when you clean the room, so anyone could have swiped a bottle of bleach, right?
LUCY: No. We've had problems with theft, towels mainly, but now our maids take their carts into the rooms.
those your kids?
Yeah.
two eldest are at UNLV.
and the baby? Jake.
Jake is, uh, six months old.
is that your second wife?
Mm-hmm.
so you must have had your vasectomy reversed.
why are we talking about my vasectomy?
you also have access to the bleach, so you won't mind if I take a DNA sample.
look.
if word leaks out that you took my DNA and I'm a murder suspect,
I will never work in hospitality again.
I'm sorry, the answer's no.
anything else?
we'll be in touch.
so we've got three suspects, three scenarios.
Yeah, Matt could have worn his Dad's sweater when he killed Ty.
dumped it in the park during the night, where Walter found it.
or Dad could have worn it and dumped it in the park.
or this sweater could have accidentally been left in the park, and Walter, the homeless guy, could have picked it up and worn it when he entered the house through the screen door and killed Ty.
but none of the evidence goes to motive.
not our problem at the moment.
let's just stay focused on the sweater.
it's tied to the victim and this scene.
we need to tie it to the killer.
Hey, how tall would you say Matt Hawkins?
about five feet, why?
dad is... 6'2."
what about Walter?
Mmm... 5'10." About Nick's height.
what you getting at?
meet me in the garage in half an hour.
grissom: Mr. Michaels, in my work over the last 25 years, I've come to understand the kind of person who's a rapist-killer.
is that an accusation?
well, a woman was murdered in your client's hotel.
he has a right to hear our theory.
the killer is clearly a psychopath.
he's killed more than once.
I'm sure that before his first rape and murder he fantasized about it for years.
quiet! Quiet!
during that time, he engaged in behavioral tryouts.
stalking women and attempting to coerce them sexually, each time moving closer and closer to the actual event.
shut up!
I believe that after you consummated your first attack, you felt excitement greater than you anticipated.
your only regret was that she died too quickly.
but you took solace in the knowledge that, uh, you could do it again.
in fact, your subsequent victim had similar characteristics to your first victim.
No! No! No!
shut up! Shut up!
this is a waste of time.
you see, what differentiates a psychopath from a "heat of the moment" killer is forethought.
and you thought about this for a long time.
thank you for the fascinating seminar, but you have no evidence, so we are free to go.
actually, I have some evidence.
what is this? What's going on?
Mr. Michaels?
she can't... You can't do that.
do what?
no, I know my rights.
Hey, shh.
the bitch broke into my car.
I don't remember seeing a warrant, Ms. Sidle.
I don't have a warrant.
I was following a hunch.
well, then you just set my client free.
on the contrary.
WESTERN Airlines issues this exact type of "wheelie" to all its flight attendants.
since Martha's wheelie wasn't in the hotel room, we thought maybe the killer took it as a souvenir.
this particular suit case...
...is not Martha's wheelie.
grissom: And now that we know where to find it, and we have your client on tape, I bet you we'll get a warrant.
thank you.
Catherine: Okay, Warrick, you are approximately the height of Martin Hawkins.
Nick, you and the homeless dude are about the same, and Judy, you're close to Matt.
the table is the same height as Ty's bed-- 43 and half inches from the floor to the top of the mattress.
the white sweaters, which you all look so adorable in, are the same fabric as the bloody one.
the pipes are the same diameter as the wounds on Ty's face.
I want each of you to take a whack at our victim.
just like Chuckie Cheese.
whack-a-mole.
uh, spatter up.
your sweater-- killer.
like I told him, I did it.
you want a medal for figuring out what I already said?
CAVALIERE: You never told me why.
Why's it matter, anyways?
go ahead.
dad.
I want to know why.
dad... Why?
damn it.
ty looked up to you.
he... he loved you.
he told. He told everyone!
that you wet the bed?
shut up!
dad... I'm sorry. I...
Oh, Matthew...
Hey.
you owe me an apology.
I'm sorry...
Theresa hit a streak
what's going on out here?
well, anonymous 9-1-1 caller reported body parts in this area.
I rolled and found this.
tasty.
have any idea how long it's going to take you to get this stuff out of here?
I can't move the, uh ...
the "body" until the coroner releases the scene.
it's a busy night.
it's probably gonna take a while, man.
great.
Hey, you mind if I step away for a second?
I need to get some fresher air.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, take your time.
want some gum?
no, thank you.
well, that's peculiar.
think!
did you see anybody else in the area?
I didn't see anything, sir.
I mean, I only took my eyes off him for a couple seconds ...
you're not supposed to take your eyes off him ever.
he's been gone maybe twenty-five minutes.
I got some white fibers on Nick's vest.
smells like alcohol.
why'd you bag that?
I didn't.
it's the wrong color tape.
no initials on the seal.
that's not Nick's evidence.
maybe it's a message.
two heads are better than one.
spatter patterns are a match.
one bullet, two victims.
no, no, no, no.
Grissom, that isn't possible.
I sampled every square inch of that scene, and there was only one DNA type on the bloodstains.
how 'bout that?
our mystery vics are identical twins.
twins?
well, that's different.
technically, it's the same.
what's this?
I just got it.
it's a certificate of honorary ownership of Trigger, "The Smartest Horse in the Movies, issued by Roy Rogers to the Children of America.
Roy felt that the children of America were the true owners of Trigger, so any kid that would write him, he'd send 'em one of those.
and where did you get it?
the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum, which used to be in Victorville, California, and is now in Branson, Missouri.
Roy Rogers, the cowboy?
king of the cowboys.
I wrote to him when I was four.
he sent me one of those.
I lost it, so I thought I'd replace it.
and then you thought you would frame it.
Yeah.
the object of the game is to be the first one to make it to Uncle Jesse's farm without running into Roscoe.
now, there's two ways to do that.
you can either take the dirt road or the highway.
dirt road is slower because you can only roll with one dice, but it's safe because you don't run into any of the Hazzard cards that you would find on the highway, right?
but when you are on the highway, you get to roll two dice, which makes you go faster.
pretend I'm gonna take the highway, so I'm gonna move General Lee eight spaces.
I hit a Hazzard card.
now, Hazzardcards you don't want.
Cooter splashes mud on your windshield.
you lose one turn, all right?
think you got it?
I think I got it.
all right, cool.
all right, well,
I've never been one to take the path of leastresistance, so I'm going for the dirt road.
one dice.
you know, far be it from me to wax nostalgic, but, uh,
I kind of miss the old Greg.
ugly t-shirts, goofy hair, semi-pornographic magazines ...
Yeah, well, at least I had a style to change.
take a Duke card.
what's a Duke card?
Duke cards are good.
you want one of those 'cause it gets you through the dirt road a lot faster.
okay, so Duke cards, good;
Hazzard cards, bad.
correct.
you jumped over a pile of rocks.
move five extra spaces.
nice. - Yeah-hoo.
Oh, and by the way, uh ...
this is just the work me.
you haven't had the full David Hodges experience.
I think I'm having it right now.
Aw, come on, you can't unfund me now.
I ... I'm committed to presenting the paper at SWAFS next month.
if it means that much to you, pay your own way.
show a little dedication to your discipline.
Oh, yeah.
tragically, my banking account isn't as dedicated as I am.
one word: Plastic.
wait.
how 'bout you kick me a little overtime under the table, huh?
over my dead body.
have you been to Grissom's office?
you think the City of Las Vegas pays for his etymology library, his insect collection, his shrunken head collection?
no.
take initiative.
people notice.
... So I took my girl to that Ultimate Fight Championship on Saturday night.
Oh, yeah, yeah, down over at the, uh, Spur?
Yeah.
almost ended up getting into a smackdown of my own.
no way.
you almost got into a beef?
you know, Tina doesn't like me carrying a gun.
I play down the fact that I'm a cop when I'm with her anyway.
Yeah, yeah, you play the scientist card.
you're a "copologist."
we're standing out in front of the hotel, making out and this guy walks up to me, gets in my face, and asks me how she is.
no, he didn't.
so?
I tell him to get lost.
he says, "Make me."
so I took a step forward and out of nowhere his big, fat bodyguard, looking like wimpy from Popeye, walks up and starts to close in on me.
so, this is out in front of the hotel?
it was at the valet parking, which might as well be in Arizona, it's so far away from the lobby.
this fat boy is looking like he's obviously carrying some sort of weapon.
and I'm standing there naked as a porn star with my girl.
did you tell them you're a "cop"?
they didn't seem to care.
one of the guys sounded Russian, like he was wanna-be Mafia.
fat boy was obviously his bodyguard.
so, uh, you know,
I wasn't physically afraid of the guys, but something was kind of sinister about them.
they were provoking me, but they weren't making a move.
it was almost like they were waiting for me to make a move.
say if I smacked big-mouth, fat boy would've came over and stabbed me or something.
even fat boy was vibing me not to take the bait.
so what happened?
well, valet finally brought Tina's car up.
so, I maneuver her around these guys and I put her in her car, and I turn my back to them and let 'em talk this smack.
I'm calming Tina down.
tell her everything is fine.
she drives off and I walk away.
I called Tina later on and I tell her, uh, you know, if she got any problem with me being a cop, she needs to get over it, 'cause now I'm packing.
Yeah. Yeah.
What'd you do on Sunday?
scoured the hotel looking for these punks.
Oh, my two favorite guys.
so, I've got an assault at Stripperama and a trash run at Flamingo and Koval.
I'm too busy to play favorites, so duke it out.
Duke it out.
boy! Better flip a coin.
I'll hurt you.
Yeah, you better flip that coin.
call it in the air.
heads.
have fun at the trash run.
you know, I'd do two out of three, but you got a gambling problem.
no, hey, you know what?
you keep this.
it's bad luck.
dumpster's clean.
no apparent blood or body parts.
take a look at this.
this seems contrived to me.
the blood pool is too perfect.
there's no splatter.
like somebody placed these entrails.
a lure.
to grab Nick.
get this stuff to the doc.
look, I'm ...I'm really sorry I didn't get here sooner.
maybe if I had ...
we're going to get him back, David.
I want you to know, as far as I'm concerned, lab's only got one case tonight.
same for the rest of the department.
Thanks, Conrad.
Hey.
what do you need me to do?
that's it, boy.
here you go. Here you go.
that's it. Whatcha got.
here you go.
they've lost the scent.
might be as far as it goes.
Yeah, there was some sort of large vehicle here.
well, there are a lot of intestines here, but no appendix, which made sense when I saw this.
a cecum.
dog entrails. - Yeah.
that's not going to help.
I'm sorry.
has Nick's family been informed?
no, that would be my job.
I swabbed the seal for epithelials, but there were no prints on the outside of the bag.
what about Nick's camera?
no fingerprints.
there were some photographs, mostly generals.
there were a few detail shots of entrails and trash.
but no lucky grabs of anybody else at the scene.
I don't think we're gonna get lucky with this guy.
he knows how to work clean.
Grissom, I pulled all of Nick's active and recent cases.
I want to know anyone who had a grudge against him.
civilian complaints, death threats ... - Got it.
there was a guy a couple of years ago that stalked him.
he may be back.
I remember.
top of the pile.
I'm using your track and wheelbase measurements plus or minus five percent to account for rain-shadowing and or drying effects.
all right, print it out.
I need you to bring up the traffic cameras in a three-block radius between Flamingo and Koval in the last 24 hours.
we only buffer the video for the past few hours.
I can take you back as far as 10: 37 P. M.
that's good enough.
our guy was taken around 11: 00.
scan forward.
we're looking for a big truck.
how about that one?
looks like a Suburban.
it's on the list.
whoa, he's really moving.
wait a minute.
that one, the big Ford.
follow it.
the Expedition truck left the area around 11: 15.
definitely in a hurry.
took a right off Koval onto Tropicana, crossed Las Vegas Boulevard onto 215 east.
and then it drove off the grid.
at least we have a general direction.
great, so Nick could be anywhere from Green Valley to Seven Hills to Arizona.
assuming he was in that truck.
well, according to Hodges, the white fibers on Nick's vest were cotton with traces of ether ...
ether? - Yeah.
that's old school.
Yeah, stuff is volatile.
flammable.
outside of meth cooks, no one uses it anymore.
people use what they know.
all right, so, where are we on possible suspects?
so far, none of Nick's active or recent cases stands out.
and his old stalker's still bend bars.
maybe it's a random act.
well, that's possible.
because whoever staged the crime scene couldn't have known that Nick was going to respond.
Yeah, it was just bad luck he did.
Sara, what about the coffee cup?
no DNA or prints on the cup or in the bag.
don't touch the edge of it!
you got to sign ...
security! Security!
get your freakin' hands off me, man!
hold still. Hold still.
Hey, I told you, you got to sign for that!
what are you doing, Hodges?
guy comes in here with a package with no return address.
you're violating my rights!
I want a lawyer!
shut up.
way the guy was pawing that envelope,
I figure I better get it away from him before he wipes off all the trace.
it's about Nick.
let me do this.
Hi, CSI guy.
you wondering why you're here?
because you followed the evidence.
because that's what CSIs do.
so breathe quick, breathe slow, put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.
any way you like, you're going to die here.
okay.
son of a bitch.
he's screwing with us.
I don't think he knows we can see him.
how can we be sure it's a live feed?
we've got to assume that it is.
the space in that box looks like 2x2x6, which would be 24 cubic feet.
that would hold approximately 600 liters of air.
if you figure half a liter per breath.
slow breathing ...
maybe 12 breaths per minute.
panic breathing would be, what, twice that much.
well, if the math is right, he's got about an hour and 15 minutes of air left in that box.
but if they're going to keep him alive for 12 hours, it must mean that he's got an additional air supply.
we lost the feed.
looks like a live feed to me.
I say we keep the light on.
I'm gonna get right to it, because time is of the essence here.
Where'd you get that package, bud?
I'd like to advise my client.
careful how you answer that, son.
this man here's slicker than a snake in the curly green grass.
he's right, so you better be careful.
I got called out to a pickup on Viking Circle.
w-when I got there,
I didn't talk to an actual person.
I just found an abandoned package with some cash taped to it.
how much cash?
that's confidential business 'tween me and this herebuckaroo.
easy, boots.
I'm gonna need those bills.
it was a hundred bucks.
if you want it back, you're gonna have to ask Steve Wynn.
what's the address?
code four.
code four.
Yeah, the address was a waste of time.
nothing here but a fat drunk and a bad smell.
the guy probably picked the house at random, 'cause he knew we'd chase it.
any news on the web cam location?
Archie's trying to narrow it down.
the feed stays active for two minutes every time you press the "WATCH" button.
but I got to go.
I got people to see. - Okay.
everybody, I have some bad news.
uh, a little while ago,
I spoke with the mayor directly.
the City of Las Vegas is not going to finance a ransom.
it's-it's against department policy to negotiate with terrorists.
no exceptions.
Mrs. Stokes,
your honor. Mrs. Stokes.
I'm, uh, sorry that we're meeting under these circumstances.
have you been able to make contact with the animals who took my son?
no, we haven't yet, but ...
they should be contacting us in roughly four hours.
we were able to rustle up $20, 000 cash.
our bank's prepared to wire another $100, 000.
now, we can sell the cars.
we can hock the ranch ...
we can make the number, but it's gonna take at least another day.
judge Stokes ... - Can we give them ...
the money we have now, try to buy more time?
I don't think that will help.
there's got to be something we can do.
you've already done it by coming here, - by showing your support ... - We're not here to show support.
we're here to get Nick home.
we're not sure who has your son ...
or why.
well ...
what the hell do you know?
very little.
let's just cut to the gist.
what proof do you have that my boy's still alive?
what the hell you got yourself into?
if the mayor wants a briefing, tell him I'll give him one after the press conference so I don't have to brief him twice, okay?
set it up.
sir.
tell me you found him so I can tell the sheriff when his plane lands.
I wish I could.
listen, I've been looking over my budget.
there are a number of things we can do within the lab itself to raise the ransom.
there's no way
not even a situation like this
that's going to make the sheriff cut back on services to our taxpayers.
we wouldn't have to.
I'm proposing we eliminate all overtime on lab work except for priority cases, stop hiring based on attrition, reassign existing personnel based on peak staffing needs.
over the next fiscal year, that should clear at least a million.
assuming any of those measures actually saves money, which isn't really the issue here, is it?
I'll take the heat.
you want to do something for your people?
get 'em ready for a funeral.
you should have seen this town in the early '70s.
gamblers were kings.
Yeah, not the same anymore.
showgirls were showgirls.
everybody knew your name in those days.
you could dress up in drag, huh?
me, dress up in drag?
who do you think you're talking to,
that's good.
anyway, we had a good time in those days, you know?
you could walk down the streets in this town 15, 20 years ago with 50, 000 bucks stacked on the top of your head in singles, and nobody would bother you.
except this guy.
he would bother you.
it's either your money or it's my money.
I gave you that line.
it's bad enough you're on top of that casino saying, "come into my place."
that's the other guy -- the richer one.
take it easy.
easy? What do you mean easy?
you talking about yourself?
or her?
I'll tell you, if she's easy,
I've got my whole day planned.
you ought to come and see my show, Tony.
I invited Jack Nicholson;
he said,"I'd rather stick needles in my eyes."
what do you think of that?
weren't we in the Vikings together?
Oh, I remember it well, Tony.
that's the best Burt Lancaster I ever heard.
Oh, miss, I like my coffee with cream and sugar, and I want you to give the r-r-really big check to really big Sam over here.
Sam, I need to talk to you.
he's already got someone to talk to, ma'am.
zip it, sweetheart.
everyone, I'd like for you to meet my daughter, Catherine.
well, you can cancel the coffee.
excuse us for a minute, all right? - Certainly.
one of my guys is in trouble.
he's been kidnapped.
I need a million dollars in cash.
large bills.
and I need it now.
let me guess, Mugs.
the department won't pay the ransom.
no.
why should I?
considering the problems that you've had with the law, you could use some good publicity.
do I look like a man that needs publicity?
if you're coming to me like a cop with a tin cup in your hand, the answer is no.
I'm not here as a cop.
then ask me like you were my daughter.
I got the money.
from where?
where do you think?
Catherine, if the press finds out about this, it'll look like Sam Braun bribed the lab.
he's a casino owner.
a leader of industry.
never convicted of any crime.
and right now,
I don't care about the integrity of the lab at the moment.
I care about Nick.
Yeah, well, so do I, but nonetheless ...
well, you're sitting here like Jack Handy with your deep thoughts, staring at a coffee cup.
you got a better plan,
I'm all ears.
all right.
but I make the drop.
you're hands off.
that's my money. - You can't be seen anywhere near this money.
it was given to the lab anonymously.
Agreed?
agreed.
Las Vegas Crime Lab.
through the door.
pretty quiet outside.
almost sounds like you came alone.
I've got your money.
put it down.
slide it over.
you're telling me there's a million dollars in here.
Yes.
along with some cute little booby traps?
which is it
a tracer, a dye pack?
normally, you'd be 100% right, but this time, you're 100% wrong.
we want Nick back, no tricks.
this looks real.
it is real.
where is Nick?
you know, I was under the impression it was against departmental policy to negotiate with terrorists.
are you a terrorist?
depends.
are you terrified?
look, I really don't want to talk to you.
where is my guy?
Oh, so ...
he is 'your guy', huh?
Yes, he is.
where is he buried?
are you two close?
that's none of your business.
what does Nick Stokes mean to you?
how do you feel when you see him in that coffin?
does your soul die every time you push that button?
how do you feel, knowing that there's nothing you can do to get him out of that hell?
helpless ...
useless ...
impotent?
good.
welcome to my world.
uh, if I were you,
I'd back up a little.
pupils are even.
he blew himself up and left us with nothing.
sir, are you experiencing any ringing in your ears?
we got the kidnapper's truck.
nevada tags: 374-Robert-Charlie-David.
run the plate.
that's the wrong box, Greg.
well, pick one.
there's three.
that one right there.
give me a break.
I haven't done this before.
all right, let's go over it again.
the diagnostic unit gets attachedto that black box, which gives us the mileage of his last trip.
like an airplane.
that gives us the radius for the search area. - Right.
got it.
twenty-three miles.
we know he was heading east on the 215.
I'll get a map.
somebody bag this money, please?
don't get any funny ideas, either.
what I had to do to get this money and for what.
there's no ID on him.
I got a thumb.
how's he doing?
hard to say.
about the same, I guess.
I'm gonna get some coffee.
Yeah.
enough ...
enough with the damn light!
no.
the fan's connected ...
the fan's connected to the light.
no.
what are you doing, Nicky?
what are you doing, Nicky?
don't do it, Nicky!
you son of a bitch!
you're still alive.
the light and the fan must have been running off the same battery.
well, at least Nicky's keeping it together.
that's good.
what about the web cam trace?
signal's running through an anonymizer.
different ISP each time we click the button.
but I think I've got a handle on the pattern.
I'm getting closer.
I got something off your thumb.
so when you struck out on prints,
I ran DNA through CODIS, hoping maybe the guy was in the system off an open case or a prior felony.
I got no straight-up match, but ...
... but you got a moderate stringency match for a Kelly Gordon.
Yeah, seven alleles in common, and based on the age,
I'd say it was his daughter.
good work, Mia.
Kelly Gordon is currently in state prison serving year three of a five-year sentence for accessory to murder.
that's the same place where the messenger picked up the package.
it wasn't random.
Hey, baby, let's go.
Hiya.
neither was the Styrofoam cup.
so at trial, you testified that you went with your boyfriend to visit a buddy of his.
and when you went in the house, your boyfriend blew the guy away.
he wasn't my boyfriend.
I knew the guy two weeks.
why am I here?
a Styrofoam cup with your DNA on it was found in that house.
you claimed you dropped it running for your life.
my word against a cup, and the next five years,
I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cellmate.
you're not reopening my case.
what do you want?
your father took it pretty hard.
he was an aerospace engineer, right?
good with explosives?
so, this is about my dad?
you know, we had your visitor's log.
your father stopped coming to see you six weeks into your sentence.
seeing your daughter turned into some ...
hood rat's lesbian sex slave can be rather emotional.
why did he come see you last week?
did you know what he was planning to do?
I don't know.
what did he do?
he kidnapped a friend of mine.
a CSI.
and then he blew himself up.
tried to take some cops with him.
how many did he get?
Hey, we're all still here.
Nick is still missing.
who's Nick?
the CSI is still missing.
do you know where he is?
that's pretty funny
you guys not being able to find something.
Yeah, look, if you cooperate, we can get your sentence reduced.
you know what I used to do before this?
back when I was alive?
I used to grow things.
outside.
I was studying horticulture.
flowers.
my cellmate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's Day.
want to smell it?
I hope your friend dies.
Hey, I found a trigger wire.
maybe ...
once we reassemble all the components, we'll be able to tell where the bomb came from.
maybe that ... - Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe.
maybe if we count up all the damn "maybes,
maybe Nick will be alive!
you know what I'm saying?!
was that necessary?
never mind my clothes.
look at the evidence.
damn.
sorry, Greg.
I'll go talk to him.
Hey, Warrick, hey.
Hey, how you holding up?
I'm not.
I know.
I just can't help thinking that could have been me in that box, you know?
we flipped a coin for that trash run.
Hey, Nick is not inside a box because of the flip of a coin.
if that was me, - I would have ... - Hey, you know what?
I know you.
I don't believe that.
okay?
no. You're wrong.
I wouldn't have lasted this far.
Catherine, if something happens to Nick, if we don't bring him back in one piece...
Hey, guys, come here.
I found something.
look at this.
there's something underneath there.
Oh, got an edge right here.
all right.
another over here.
Greg, get some crowbars.
do you think Nick could be under here?
I don't know, man.
it would have to be at least six feet long.
Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise, and who's to say he didn't ...
he could be.
I'm in here!
I hit something.
the air.
it's Plexiglas.
Hey, I'm right here!
Nick! Hold on there, buddy!
it's a dog.
it's a dog.
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Oh, my God.
my name is Nick Stokes.
if anybody finds this tape, turn it in to the Las Vegas ...
PD.
there should be a reward.
mom ... ...
well, this is a lousy way to say good-bye, but it's all I've got.
I love you.
you raised me right ...
and I'm going to miss you.
as for the rest of you guys,
I know you did the best you could to find me.
no, you never did, Nick.
he's going into convulsions.
he's losing it.
what's going on?
what is -- ?
wait a minute.
ants.
my God, he's being eaten alive.
that's it, Nicky.
stay still.
they won't bite.
as much.
this has got to be a prototype.
it was probably built to test how long he could keep somebody alive inside.
now, what are those?
I don't know.
all right, based on this battery and what's running off of it, and the fact that we kept the damn light on for as long as we did,
I figure Nick's got another ninety minutes left, now.
Oh, come on, pal.
Yeah.
that's it.
come on.
little more.
keep coming.
show me what you're made of.
come on, buddy.
gotcha!
solenopsis invicta.
they're fire ants, very rare in Nevada.
they don't like our soil.
the only places you find them around Vegas are in plant and tree nurseries.
there's eleven nurseries in the greater Las Vegas area.
okay, I've got the web cam trace down to here.
and the data from the black box in Walter Gordon's truck gave us a 23-mile travel radius.
okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area.
here and here.
wait, wait. Wait, wait.
the daughter, worked with plants.
hold on. Hold on.
you guys,
Nick is here.
you said on the phone you had a fire ant mound.
where is it?
people usually prefer to stay away from it.
all right, look.
fan out.
look for loose soil.
anything that might've been dug up recently.
that's the whole place.
right down there.
let's go! Right now.
He-e-ey!
I'm picking up the web cam transmitter.
this is it!
I found it!
it's here.
I found it!
this is it!
Nick! Nick, we're here. Hang on!
it's a damn shame they didn't get to him sooner.
I sure will miss him.
you know, David, I've seen fire ant bites in my time, but never anything like this.
do you think he suffered?
do I think he suffered?
Yes.
definitely.
all right.
on three.
uno ...
Tres!
would you care to do the "y" incision? when the locals take the town ...
well, "Y" not?
mind your hands and feet.
Yes.
he won't be needing this anymore.
nice.
lung.
so, Doctor.
how did my son die?
anaphylactic shock?
no, no, he didn't live long enough for that.
cod was asphyxiation.
Oh.
when the blood oxygen drops to less than 16% and the CO2 builds up, there's a rapid loss of consciousness.
death within minutes with no disfiguring physical findings.
he'll look great at the funeral.
Oh, yes.
his mother will appreciate that.
good.
your son had a good heart.
Oh, my God.
no, no, no, no.
I hit something.
we got you, Nicky!
Hey!
Hey!
we got you, man!
Hey, Nicky!
Hey, hold on there.
Hey, put that down.
put that down.
put that down.
we got you.
we're gonna get you out of here.
hang in there.
Oh, my God.
we need that fire extinguisher!
give me that fire extinguisher.
these ants are getting at him, man.
short bursts, Greg.
don't suffocate him!
hang on, buddy. Hang on.
almost had him.
get the paramedics!
hang on. Hang on.
we'll kill those ants, okay?
you listen to me.
Yeah.
Yeah. Hey, boss ...
we found him.
we're getting him out now.
that's great. Wai-wait.
don't-don't hang up.
just-just listen.
what? What?
those dimples on the bottom of the prototype.
GCMS found traces of semtex on each one.
you got to be kidding me. - One, two, three.
everyone out of the hole.
that box is ready to explode!
are you kidding?
get out of there now!
I'm not leaving without Nick.
there are charges under the box!
I'm not leaving here without him.
Warrick, Catherine's right.
get out of the hole now.
I know what we're gonna do.
just trust me.
help!
we need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now, and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it.
can you hear me?
it's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay?
listen to me.
put your hand on my hand.
good.
now listen.
there may be explosives under the box.
They'reprobably set on pressure switches.
we need to equalize your body weight before we can pull you out, okay?
nod your head if you understand me.
okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe to equalize his weight.
I need a rope and a caribiner.
you got it.
all right, Pancho, we're gonna open the lid and get you out, but I need you to stay lying down.
okay?
or else you'll blow us all up.
you understand that? - Yeah, yeah.
do you promise?
Pancho, say, "I promise."
I promise.
bring it over.
this way!
don't move.
I got you. I got you.
lay still. Lay still.
it's okay. It's okay.
okay, okay.
all right, bring that over.
okay, Pancho,
I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath.
now!
ready? Go!
I want my guys back.
you the one?
Yeah.
Yeah, back at you.
what do you want me to say?
I'm sorry?
no, you didn't do anything to me.
and what your dad did,
I ... I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much.
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
pick it up.
in a few years ...
when you get out of here ...
don't take it with you.
that's it?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
we're done.
that's it.
that's it.
I don't understand.
why am I here?
miss Hollis, you've been assaulted.
who...? I...
you don't know who did this?
what was the last thing you remember?
I don't know.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
okay, this isn't right.
why isn't this right? Why don't I look right?
Christina, it's okay. -No, it's not okay.
it's not okay.
why don't I look right? I don't underst...
why are they st... why are they staring at me?
stop looking at me!
nurse, get in here!
it's okay. It's okay. -Don't stare at me...
I did a wet mount from a vaginal swab and got 4-plus motile sperm present.
so she was raped within the last few hours.
no condom means he's not in the system or he doesn't care if he gets caught.
guys like this, they keep doing it.
excuse me, detective. Can I ask you a question?
detective.
you try something like that again and you're gone.
I don't a give a damn what the sheriff says.
we never put anyone on screen without a signed release.
you invaded her privacy at her most vulnerable moment.
I am trying to give the crime a face.
Yeah, well, we're going to lose an hour waiting for her to calm down.
that's on you.
I apologize. It won't happen again.
look, can I just ask you what you've got there?
it's a sexual assault evidence kit and blood sample.
I've seen date rape victims in similar dissociative states.
we're going to run a tox screen, see if she was drugged.
you were a csi, right? -Yeah.
and now you're a detective.
so which side of the fence do you prefer?
it's the same side.
candles burned down.
a bouquet in the trash.
flowers and candles sure seems like a date.
some date.
there's a void in the wax.
some kind of white flaky substance.
this looks like blood, but...
I think it's nail polish.
Hey, how's it going?
according to your supervisor, you were doing maintenance work on the 11th floor at 5: 00 A. M.
what were you fixing at 5: 00 in the morning?
I was just clocking a little overtime.
management said they wanted a few extra coats of paint on three, seven and 11.
got to keep everything nice a nd pretty for the tenants.
you know, the security guy didn't see you on his camera.
why is that?
Yeah, well, that guy doesn't see much.
service elevator's out.
we have to use the stairs.
God forbid the tenants ever have to look at one of us.
you got a master key to all the apartments?
Yeah.
but we only go in if a tenant specifically asks us to fix something.
you ever fix anything for Christina Hollis?
no. Never.
you're running a little low on duct tape, my man.
Yeah.
it's holding up half the building.
two pieces of duct tape, both have been swabbed for dna and fingerprinted.
Grissom wants you to compare adhesives.
he's looking for a match.
okay.
that'll take a laser ablation test.
that's good.
Why's that good?
well, laser ablation is both visual and dramatic.
are you looking for the video crew right now?
I would think that they would be looking for me.
relax, man, the show's only an hour long.
laser ablation takes, like, six.
Yeah, but when they cut it together, it'll only take 30 seconds.
ran laser ablation on the duct tape samples.
not a match.
so she wasn't tied up with the maintenance man's tape.
what about the rest of the trace?
white powder was primarily biological, so I kicked it back to dna.
it did contain some glassy particles.
might be industrial diamonds.
and the yellow reflective flakes?
my next priority.
that's a waste of film.
the victim came out of her apartment around 5: 00 A. M.
so I've been working my way back from then.
in the previous seven hours, 37 people came and went from the 11th floor, 21 of them male.
so the assailant could be any one of them...
assuming that our guy didn't take the stairs which, of course, aren't monitored.
okay, now, here:
this guy got off on the vic's floor at 10: 32 P. M.
there's no footage of him coming back down.
and check this out.
he brought flowers. How romantic.
but I don't think this was a first date.
guy had his own key.
so he could've been with the victim the whole night.
pull the best image of his face you can, -and get a printout to brass. -I'm on it
ms. Willows, hold on a second.
all you have is a guy's face.
how do you figure out who he is?
good question.
so what have you found so far?
I lifted two identifiable prints off the bouquet wrapper.
how do you know they belong to the suspect?
we don't, but one matched a print found on the duct tape, right here, used to tape up the victim.
unfortunately, that print's not in our database.
so your suspect doesn't have a record?
apparently not, no.
well, how do you find a guy who's not in the system?
you just got to get creative, you know?
I mean, the flowers...
came from a small shop off-strip.
took the suspect's image to the clerk, showed it to him.
he gave me a credit card receipt.
from that receipt, I got a name.
that name gave me a driver's license.
Dwight reynolds.
police are bringing him in now.
great, okay. -Clear and concise, thank you.
Thanks. Yeah, well, we have to do it in court all the time.
if you can't explain it to a jury, then the bad guy usually walks, and we don't like it when the bad guy walks.
unit picked him up at the double down.
he was plastered.
What'd he blow? -One nine.
that's almost enough to wash away your sins.
well, we're going to have wait until he sobers up.
no, no, let's not wait, let's move on this.
I think we got a chance.
look, why don't you come in there with me?
maybe pop a few buttons?
no, seriously.
see how he reacts.
if he tries too hard not to look, it could be a guilty conscience?
Yeah, maybe, something like that.
if he is the guy, and we interview him now, anything he says could be thrown out of court.
it's worth a try.
what do you think?
let's go.
how's it going?
did you know a christina hollis?
Yeah, we used to date.
you seen her recently?
no.
then how come we found your prints on some flowers at her place?
I dropped some flowers off...
but I didn't see her when I did.
you had a key? -Yeah.
she likes me to come over sometimes, you know?
help her move stuff.
Oh, come on, what really happened?
you went over to move some stuff, and she wasn't in the mood, is that it?
I told you--I didn't see her.
she was playing barry white.
everybody knows what that means.
I guess it wasn't my night. -You're lying!
we found the flowers inside her apartment, in the trash, and you didn't use the elevator to leave.
I was pissed.
I tried to walk it off.
I figured 11 flights down, it's better than a cold shower.
Christina hollis was tied up and brutally assaulted in her apartment last night.
what?
and you were there.
is she...? -She's alive and talking.
last night?
the guy who with her was...
was doing that to her?
I could've stopped it.
so the powder that you found on the bedroom floor was actually keratinized skin cells.
they belong to the vic, and morphology suggests that they're probably from her cuticles.
cuticles?
nail polish, diamond particles...
maybe she was giving herself a mani and pedi before the assault.
I don't know about you, but if I could afford to live in an apartment like that,
I'd be in a spa every week.
Yeah, I hear you there. Thank you.
Wendy ran the semen, no hits in codis.
Yeah, the, ex-boyfriend didn't match any of the prints on the duct tape, either.
SAE found oral, vaginal and anal smears positive for semen.
degraded and intact sperm suggests multiple deposits.
which means that he probably raped her on and off, for a long time.
Yeah, well, tox came back--lorazepam in the vic's blood.
I didn't find any prescription bottles in her apartment.
no, nor did I.
lorazepam is a hypnotic sedative, and I know in high doses, it causes acute amnesia.
maybe that's what he was counting on to cover his tracks.
well, it usually takes an hour for a drug like that to kick in.
how did he subdue her in the meantime?
low-profile entry, sedatives, duct tape
I mean, if he's not a serial, he will be soon.
Hey, there, gorgeous.
I'm going to be running with the trace from the victim's apartment.
would you mind bringing me up to speed?
certainly.
take your time.
did you page us?
no.
according to the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, the glossy red drop you found on the footboard was...
nail polish.
well, that's not unusual in a woman's apartment.
what is far more intriguing is the reflective yellow flakes.
follow me to the fourier transform infrared microscope.
Hodges, what's wrong with you? -Nothing.
guys... stay with the girl.
as you can see, the flakes are fluorescent reflective lenses bonded to an aramid backing by a special polymer layer.
and it's used exclusively in the reflective trim of firemen's turnouts.
you're telling me there was a firefighter in the victim's bedroom.
Thanks. Thanks, hodges.
anytime.
Yeah, all right, okay, let 'em roll.
but you're buyingthe lobster. -Yeah, right.
see, one of the guys gets on tv, that guy has to buy lobster for the whole company, you know?
these guys eat well
lobster thermidor! Check it out.
so, according to dispatch, you responded to an alarm at the omni condos last night?
Yeah, at 6: 58 P. M.
we were on scene in about four minutes.
three smoke bombs on three different floors, three pains in my ass.
there's no major damage, just paint and wallpaper.
we were there about a half hour.
What'd the arson guys find?
they didn't find much.
the smoke bombs were made out of soda cans.
kids, internet, you do the math.
it's all in your lab.
Really? What for?
a couple guys from the day shift were gonna compare 'em to those bombs we found a couple of weeks ago.
what are you talking about?
apartment building over on paradise.
smoke bombs started a fire, one woman died.
we still don't have a suspect in that.
were you on the scene?
I saw it after.
smoke bomb was too close to the wall, the whole place...
which of your guys were up on the 11th floor at the omni?
I don't know.
I'd have to ask around. Why?
a woman was raped last night.
you think one of my guys did it? -I'm not saying that, but we found some evidence that a fireman was near her bed.
you came here to accuse my guys of this in front of the camera?
no, no, no. Settle down, settle down...
the hell I will.
no wonder they call you brass, because you really got a set.
come on, sparky...-Excuse me, gentlemen.
captain, which of your guys...
wears a yellow reflective stripe on their turnouts?
nobody, department's color is orange.
the reflective flake we found in christina hollis' apartment was yellow.
then you're not looking for a las vegas fireman.
according to surveillance, the victim came home at 6: 19 P. M.
and the firemen were in her building at approximately 7: 00.
they took the stairs, so we don't have them on this camera.
now take a look at this...
888
well, he certainly looks the part.
he touched the door with his bare hands.
might get prints.
the time code says 6: 36 P. M.
but the alarm went out at 6: 58.
that's 22 minutes later.
what kind of fireman comes before the fire?
someone who knows it's coming.
Mr. Grissom, we may have missed that.
could you say it one more time for camera?
you ever hear the saying, "only the dumb ones get caught?
yeah...
but we catch the smart ones, too.
and this guy's definitely smart.
he lights smoke bombs on three different floors so as not to call attention to his target.
victim sees the smoke, sees him, and opens the door.
fire department, open up.
I mean, who wouldn't trust a fireman, right?
it takes a lot of courage to do this.
thank you.
and if you change your mind about the camera, -all you have to do is say so-- -no one ever has to see this.
no, I want him to see it. He'll watch it in jail.
okay, so, you said you were beginning to remember what happened?
Yeah, a little.
can you tell me what he looked like?
no, not really.
it's mostly, just feelings.
feelings.
of what?
I know he raped me.
what I remember most...
it was, he...
he kept...
he kept touching my feet.
he kept touching my feet.
a foot fetish is a visual pathology.
the suspect would have had to be close enough to the vic to see her toes and then get aroused.
we live in a desert, gil.
you want to see a woman's bare feet, all you have to do is look down.
door in the parking structure was like the arm of a slot machine:
smudge city.
anything useful from the janitor?
Yeah, he gave us a full description.
said he looked like a fireman.
well, between ebay, uniform shops, and national manufacturers, there's about a hundred different places .
that you can buy yellow-striped turnouts
maybe he was a fireman in another city.
maybe.
what's that?
when I was at the firehouse, all of the air tanks were rigged with the valves on the bottom, like this one.
but our guy... his valve is on top.
a real fireman probably wouldn't make that mistake.
his air line isn't even rigged to his mask.
it's rigged to a second mask on his side.
maybe he put something in the tank to subdue her.
he used lorazepam.
eventually.
but this guy was somehow able to get her from the door to the bed without a struggle.
I bet he used nitrous oxide.
that stuff will knock you out real fast.
and it's undetectable in the blood after a few minutes.
pretty easy to come by.
and it would explain the valve on top.
it's liquid under pressure.
it would spill if it were upside down.
all you need is a driver's license and a deposit for the tank.
if this guy bought nitrous from a local distributor, there's definitely a record.
check it out.
come on, Tina.
like, I'm the only one working doubles here.
Oh, so it's my fault that we have strange schedules.
great. Go out with your friends.
I'm sure you'll be seeing Robert again tonight, too, huh?
you know what?
it's fine.
I got to go. Have a fun time.
this a bad time?
no. Great time.
what can I do for you?
what are you working on?
I'm examining smoke bombs recovered from, the victim's condo, and comparing them to smoke bombs from an arson case a couple of weeks ago.
how do you know which is which?
I mean, how do you tell them apart?
well, so far, I've only opened up one item from each case.
csis, when we work a case, we take extensive notes at the scene, and photos of each item.
and, they're very similar, I know.
but, based on the construction and the components,
I'd say these two bombs were made by the same person.
so I guess this is a slow day at the morgue.
you can't really predict this job.
today it's like this, tomorrow it's a bus accident.
so I am here.
Albert. -Yeah?
did you find the blood sample I called you about?
female arson fatality. C.O. D. is smoke inhalation.
partial tox came back carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide.
I need a test for lorazepam.
blood's on its way to tox.
you recall any other sexual assault victims that tested positive for lorazepam?
nothing comes to mind, but I'll check my files, confer with toxicology.
Thanks. -Yeah.
a slow day is a good day.
these people lived on the same floor as the female arson fatality from two weeks ago.
tox on the arson victim came back negative for lorazepam.
so maybe she wasn't the target.
ms. Sidle, is this what you guys call a "fishing expedition"?
we call this following a lead.
forgive me, but it's not very much of a lead.
what's that supposed to mean?
well, this case is even colder than the one you're on.
you'd almost be better off if you had a new rape victim and a fresh scene.
that might be true, but that is definitely not the outcome that we're looking for.
I didn't really know the girl who died.
I still can't believe what happened.
it's just awful.
tell me what you remember.
I was alone in my apartment saturday night.
hello. What's new, right?
I was reading or something.
and then, suddenly, there was someone pounding on my door.
can you describe what he looked like?
well, he was fireman.
I mean, he was wearing a mask.
it all happened pretty quick.
Why?
we're looking for a rapist who masquerades as a fireman.
he uses smoke bombs to get his victims to open their doors.
he knocked on my door.
are you saying you think he was going to rape me?
it's possible.
you know, I was pretty freaked.
when he was standing there in front of me...
just before he left,
I swear, for a second, it felt like he wasn't going to let me go.
turnouts were a dead end.
and there's nothing to track off of the smoke bombs.
I've got hundreds of names of people who purchased nitrous oxide in the last six months.
what? You got to narrow that down.
that is narrowed down.
okay. Our rapist is a foot fetishist.
that's what gets him off.
he has to see his victim's feet somewhere.
if we can figure out where, maybe we can find him.
what do the victims have in common?
Christina Hollis, African American, single.
lives and works at the omni.
she lives on the 11th floor, so there's no real way for a peeper to see in.
and she uses the gym, but not the pool.
Stephanie daniels lives across town.
Caucasian. Also single.
no gym membership, but she does use the pool at her apartment complex regularly.
there's a couple of adjacent buildings.
it's possible that somebody could see into her place with a telescope, but she has shades and curtains.
I kind of doubt it.
so they have nothing in common.
sure, they do.
they both have feet.
we may have a third victim who may also be our first victim.
Tara weathers.
last month, she claimed she was drugged in a bar and woke up in her apartment with her toes freshly painted.
they did a tox on her at the time.
found lorazepam in her system.
well, she does have nice feet.
and the nail polish looks like a similar shade to christina hollis'.
Yeah. So the pattern starts a month ago.
our guy drugs tara weathers in a bar, takes her to her apartment, paints her toes, leaves.
two weeks later, he steps it up.
poses as a firefighter, places smoke bombs in an apartment building, only things don't work out the way that he planned.
the building catches fire, and he runs.
he waits a couple more weeks, he does it again, but this time he goes all the way.
Yeah. And now he's escalating.
where does he go from here?
Tara weathers?
I'm jim brass, las vegas police.
this is catherine willows from the crime lab.
what do you want?
well, we're here to ask you about the incident you reported to the police last month.
the nail polish thing?
Yeah, the nail polish thing.
you guys said I should consider myself lucky, that there was no real crime anyway.
well, we may have been wrong about that.
I knew it, that's what I tried to tell you the first time.
the guy who drugged you is a rapist and a murderer, and we're looking to stop him before he does it again.
are you serious? -Very.
we're trying to understand what you have in common with the other victims that might lead us to him.
now he has a foot fetish.
he's into feet.
is there any way that he could've... seen your feet?
I-I... I don't know.
where do you buy your shoes?
all over.
do you go to a gym? -No, not really.
pool? -No, never. I burn easily.
I'm a legal secretary, I don't get out much.
my work starts early and it goes late.
the firm is so conservative, we're not even allowed to wear open-toed shoes.
I notice that you do yoga. -Yeah.
where? -Out on the balcony.
it's practically the only fresh air I get.
anybody in those apartments has a clear view of her bare feet.
so how'd you get the warrant?
the tenant's name was on the nitrous oxide list.
Las vegas police.
open up, we have a warrant.
open up, police.
open it.
let's go.
no, no, no, you're not going in there, no.
can you please take this in, it's a flashlight cam.
it'll record anything you point it at.
Thanks.
all clear.
Thanks.
OK, get in.
zoom.
zoom.
perfect view of tara's balcony.
yoga flyers from all over town.
guy's got everything he needs for a pedicure.
Hey, check this out.
God bless the internet.
fireman's air tank case.
Where's the tank?
Yeah, this is brass.
I want to put a broadcast out on richard mcqueen.
candle wax.
stay down!
Las vegas P. D!
Las vegas P. D.Break it up!
break it up!
what the hell's going on here? -Smoke bombs.
we caught this creep sneaking away. My guys tried to stop him.
she wouldn't let me touch her feet. -Get him out of here.
you should see what he did?
women are four times more likely than men to be the victims of a sex-related murder.
and men are ten times more likely than women to be the murderer.
it's just the way it is.
is that your daughter?
Oh, yeah, these are old pictures.
she's a teenager now.
with all the things you see on this job, do you ever worry about her?
are you kidding?
I keep a vial of her blood in my freezer.
like as a dna sample in case you need to identify her?
well...
one thing you learn doing this job is that bad things happen to people who never expect it...
every day.
Yeah, we got a confession.
he didn't choose women's feet, women's feet chose him.
he lit candles, he played music, he thought he was on a date.
but did he explain, you know, why he did it?
Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.
his mother was a hooker, she put him under the bed when she did her business, her feet dangled over the edge of the bed.
he watched her feet, they were perfect.
you know, I don't know if it's true.
what about the fireman thing?
I don't know,
I guess he wanted to be a fireman when he grew up.
didn't you?
look, juries love explanations, they want it nice and neat.
they don't want to know we live in a random world, they want meaning. It's that simple.
so how do you cope with a day like today?
what do you do?
what do you want me to tell you, that I go home,
I get drunk, I go to a bar,
I stay out all night, I don't sleep...?
that's not the truth. You know what happens?
I take care of myself, I sleep very well.
how well did you sleep after you learned you killed that fellow officer in that shootout last year?
is this... is that... is this what this is about?
who've you been talking to?
what, you come here with your camera and you roll a little film and...
what, you think you know what it's like to be a cop?
you?
you're all done. You're all done with this.
get out of here.
the truth is if there isn't any evidence, we have nowhere to go.
so you feel you did the best you could?
Yes, I do.
do you think forensic shows are just teaching the criminals how to get away with crimes?
everyone learns from science.
it all depends on how you use the knowledge.
keep going, go inside for a close-up.
a truck driver making a delivery found him.
T.O.D?
about two or three hours ago.
neck contusion.
looks like he went down fighting.
any ID?
just this.
Palermo room key.
nice clothes.
well, they do make the man.
he's got some kind of transfer on his pants.
Yeah, and on his shirt.
so what's a guy dressed for a party with a key to this hotel doing out here?
I don't know.
but the party's over.
got smudges that look like white paint up here.
similar to the trace on the vic's clothes.
same down here.
so whatever it is, it must have been wet.
I don't see any wet paint signs up here either.
two performances nightly of Palermo's fabulous show, "the girls of India."
now on display at Palermo jewelers-- diamonds at romanoff'S.
the room is registered to a Jeffrey Powell of Van Nuys, California.
he check in with anybody?
no. The reservation was for one person.
he checked in yesterday, paid with a corporate credit card.
do you remember the name of the company?
we're going to need access to all of the surveillance footage from tonight, all right?
you got it. - Okay.
two glasses. Think our vic got lucky?
Oh, yeah.
he got lucky, all right.
he got lucky with a blonde.
jeans...
full of holes.
must have been wearing them a long time.
either that or he just bought them an paid a fortune.
I remember my first time to Vegas.
I got one of these-- guide to blackjack.
everybody dreams of hitting it big out here, don't they?
Yeah, well, if that ever ends you can kiss Vegas good-bye.
we have a winner.
jackpot.
Ooh, Sasan.
cost him more than all of his other clothes put together.
there's some kind of blue powder trace on the pocket.
Nicky, take this.
california driver's license.
company credit card.
amateur speedway association card.
guy liked fast cars.
except he was driving a Toyota.
no cash.
this sounds like a classic trick roll.
I cannot lose tonight!
kid from out of town on a lucky streak
he's an easy mark.
get him up to the room...
loosen him up...
jump him and dump him.
mom was right
always wear clean ones. Because you never know what could happen.
what do you think that is?
why don't you take a whiff?
why am I always the guy who has to sniff the shorts?
cause it's your job.
you do it.
red wine.
it's not on his pants.
what about the shirt?
no.
so he must have changed after the mess.
Oh, I already went through his pockets.
of course, I was double-gloved.
clothes are brand new.
looks like a callus.
there's a long-haired blonde.
Yeah, I've been watching this for a while now.
time stamped 10: 52 P. M.
he entered his room a couple of minutes later.
manager said the last time he used his card key was 10: 54 P. M.
we look forward about an hour...
Jeff leaves his room alone.
he doesn't have a jacket on.
he's probably not going too far.
so he gets off the elevator, goes into the casino, and nine minutes later, same blonde goes down in the elevator.
grab that.
print that.
after the vic gets off the elevator,
I lose him in the casino crowd for about 15 minutes.
how do you lose him? Aren't there a hundred cameras in there?
and at four hours of video each, that's 400 hours of video I got to go through.
the vic was found at the loading dock off the shopping arcade.
he's heading for the arcade here.
that's the last time I've got him on camera.
there's no surveillance in the arcade hall.
only in the individual stores.
freeze that.
enhance that bag.
the vic was wearing a Sasan jacket.
there's a Sasan boutique in the arcade.
I'm going shopping.
but you were working last night.
Yeah, we've been short-handed.
do you, uh, do you recognize either one of these people?
no. Sorry.
how about this?
recognize that?
sure. That's from the new spring line.
the leather's like skin. It's incredible.
show me that picture again.
now I remember.
he bought a whole outfit.
even wanted underwear.
we don't sell underwear.
credit card receipt, anything like that?
he paid cash. He was flashing a wad.
buy anything for her?
nothing. She didn't need anything.
looked perfect. Was making my job real easy.
that guy would have bought anything she wanted him to, Mr. Stokes.
thank you.
I found extensive contusion involving the anterior aspect of the neck with hemorrhage in all the strap muscles.
the thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid cartilages are all multiply fractured.
the hyoid bone is fractured as well.
the blunt-force trauma to the neck?
Yeah. Cod is asphyxiation due to obstruction of the airway.
took a few minutes to die.
any idea of the source of the BFT?
well, I enhanced the contusion on the neck using UV photography.
looks like there's a defined edge on the weapon.
Yeah, that could be anything.
how about prelim tox results?
well, tox detected methamphetamine, sildenafil and oxycodone.
stimulant, erection and a painkiller.
party in a pill.
where was that on my wedding night?
does this couple look familiar?
sweet red Ferrari. F-360 spyder.
when did you see them?
last night-- I brought the car when they left.
around 8: 15. They're gone a couple hours. The car-pfft-was amazing.
did they happen to tell you where they were going?
no.
do you know what time they got back to the hotel?
uh, a little after 10: 00. The guy gave me a Benjamin.
I kept an eye out on that baby,
I didn't want any of these other maniacs putting their paws on it.
what about the girl? You ever seen her before?
I don't think so.
she strike you as a working girl?
I'll say this, if she was hooking, then she was top shelf, just like that car.
I felt kind of like that Garage guy in Ferris Bueller's day off?
you know, he likes the car so much, he takes it out for a spin for, like, the whole day.
not that I'd ever do that.
of course not.
whoa, look, I had nothing to do with the damage on that car.
I mean, it was pristine before they took it out.
they were in an accident?
how bad?
look, any scratch on that beauty is a tragedy.
and this was, like, a dent.
you know what? They looked like they didn't even care.
anything else I can do for you?
Thanks. - Lenny.
Lenny andretti. No relation.
the trace for your vic's jacket pocket was primarily talc.
blue baby powder?
no.
take a look.
birefringent crystals.
pretty.
what are they?
it's a mixture of silica and axolite, two abrasives.
but when found with talc, it suggests only one use.
and that would be?
in 1897, William Spinks received a patent for what came to be known as "spinks billiard chalk.
you may be surprised to know that cue-tip chalk does not contain chalk at all, it is a mixture of axolite and silica.
the abrasives give grip to the tip when it hits the ball.
stop trying to make that sound dirty.
out vic had a callus on his hand.
don't.
which means that he was probably playing a lot of pool.
where do you go in this town to shoot stick with a hot blonde and a Ferrari?
there's at least a half a dozen of these high-end pool halls in vegas.
the word on the street is a lot of out-of-town money comes through here.
well, it's closer to palermo, it's a good place to start.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
have these two been in lately?
no.
it's pretty dark in here, wouldn't recognize my own mom if she came in.
it wasn't so dark you couldn't count your vig from that game over there.
it's not illegal to bet on a pool game in Nevada.
but it is illegal for the house to take a cut without a gaming license.
I don't see one on the wall.
that's because nothing like that's going on here.
so, if we asked everyone in here, no one would say that you're taking a piece of the action?
let me take another look.
sure. Knock yourself out.
I never seen the guy.
girl's kind of a regular here. Name's Heidi.
so, I guess your eyes do get used to the dark.
you know where we can find this heidi?
Oh, man...
you know, I don't see that license anywhere.
look, here's what we're going to do.
get on the phone. Call Heidi.
tell her a distinguished gentleman has just come in with a large wad of cash looking for some action.
that'd be me.
Heidi Wolff?
how you doing? I'm Jim Brass, Las Legas police.
can I talk to you for a minute?
about what?
do you know this guy?
no.
apparently, you think I do.
Oh, I know you do.
you want to tell me how he turned up dead?
closed captioning of this program is brought
and he was alive when he left me.
Oh. He left you?
Yeah.
believe it or not.
look.
he was getting kind of weird on me.
Hey.
where you going?
don't worry, I'll be right back.
you know, I think I may just have to fall in love with you.
so I put on my clothes and I got out of there.
I was looking for fun, not a lifetime commitment.
is that what you call fun?
rolling a guy, taking his money?
I didn't take his money.
Heidi, Heidi, ho.
look, we know jeff was waving around a large wedge of cash.
and the money was gone when we found him.
you're an expensive date, Heidi.
I'm a professional gambler.
probably the only one in vegas who declares every dollar.
you can check my tax returns.
we checked the hotel sheets.
we had sex.
is that against the law?
no. - No.
we won some money shooting pool. Is that against the law?
no.
you gave him drugs. Is that against the law?
Yeah.
look, here's the way I see it breaking down.
you left the room nine minutes after he did.
you went downstairs.
you checked with your partner.
you killed the kid, you took the cash, end of story.
let's get this straight.
he was a sweet kid and I'm sorry he's dead, but I had nothing to do with it.
and I'm done talking.
according to the DMV, of the 12 Ferrari f-360 Spyders registered in vegas, only three are red.
two of them are privately owned, and a rental company has the third.
since the vic owns a toyota in L. A. And heidi wolff drives a beetle...
you figured this would be a good place to start.
welcome to extravagant auto.
robert Rhoda.
if what you're dreaming about's on four wheels, I can get it for you.
actually, we're looking for a red Ferrari Spyder.
the lady likes fast cars.
and I just happen to have one.
but it got into a little fender-bender, so it's going to take a day or so to get it fixed.
we'll take it as is.
looks like paint transferon the left rear quarter.
clear coat's been peeled front-to-back.
which means the Ferrari was the faster vehicle.
the Ferrari is always the faster vehicle.
nice dent to the front bumper.
you're looking at $15, 000 of damage there.
who rented it?
can't help you with that.
our customer records are confidential.
in any case, we're not making a police report about the damage.
no need to, we're impounding it.
what?
looks like the interior's been cleaned.
I'll call auto transport and have them tow it back to the lot.
Mr. Rhoda, what are you doing?
I'm documenting my loss.
I'm filing for crime victim compensation.
Grissom?
Hodges confirmed the paint transfer on the Ferrari is a black acrylic enamel.
that doesn't narrow it down much.
well, it gets better. It's a GM paint, with traces of fiberglass reinforced plastic.
which means, we're looking for a black Corvette.
I'll have Brass put out a broadcast.
Nick Ran the vic's credit card.
Sheritown, Inc." Is based in L. A. Run by a guy named mick sheridan.
I'm going to meet him at the P. D.
Mick Sheridan the movie producer?
I grew up watching his action blockbusters
car chases, ninjas, cyborg death machines.
we used to make body armor out of tinfoil, and re-enact the scenes all over the neighborhood.
what about you, you were a green beret kid? Secret agent?
I'm not telling. And stay away from my tinfoil.
I'm sick about this.
of all kids.
Jeff.
I can't stop crying.
you want something to drink?
Oh, thanks, uh...
small pellegrino, room temperature.
Mr. Sheridan, can you tell us anything about this girl?
I don't know her. Jeff must have met her here.
I loved him like a son.
smart. Hard-working.
I hired him right out of law school.
what kind of work did he do for you?
an assistant.
he wanted to learn the movie business from the bottom up, like I did.
Oh, right, you used to be an actor.
Yeah.
but I had a nasty habit-- I wanted to eat regularly.
and didn't want to work as a waiter to do it.
did Jeff have any nasty habits?
we found several different drugs in his bloodstream.
what was Jeff doing in Las Vegas?
about a month ago, when he was making copies of my divorce settlement, he spotted a provision that my wife's lawyer had rephrased.
my lawyers had missed it.
he saved me millions of dollars.
so to thank him, I gave him a vacation.
you give him any cash?
couple hundred bucks, corporate credit card.
told him to have fun.
fun, huh?
Yeah.
I'll be regretting that for the rest of my life.
I guess the broadcast paid off. Black 'vette.
parking enforcement found it abandoned off durango near russell.
right between the pool hall and the Palermo?
Yup.
this would have been impossible to drive away.
Yeah.
bummer.
please tell me there's something more to this guys and cars thing beside the obvious penis extension metaphors.
so you want me to lie?
red paint transfer.
I'll get a sample to Hodges.
see if he can match it to the Ferrari.
it's a rental.
extravagant automobiles?
no. Zenith?
Yeah, night to be in the car rental business.
driver's name is randy bolen. Local address.
let's go talk to him.
Randy Bolen.
misdemeanor possession, assault, "Felony possession for sales...
you can't help but break the law, can you?
what's with the forehead?
well, you got that bruise somehow.
want me to add leaving the scene of an accident to the list?
it was a fender bender. Not my fault.
sure about that?
Yeah.
because your car and the Ferrari were both rented.
so what? It's a coincidence.
you're a local. Why did you need to rent a car?
I can't afford one all the time, so I rent one when I can.
what were you doing all night before your fender bender?
what was I doing? I was shooting pool.
place called the... the Cue-T.
how'd you play? Did you win any money?
you know, you win some, you lose some.
I guess that would be lose some. How much?
ten grand.
that's a lot of money for a guy like you.
I've had worse nights.
Yeah, I'm sure you have.
you're having one now.
these the guys you played?
Yeah.
now, there's a coincidence, because they were in the Ferrari, which makes you a very sore loser.
okay.
so I rubbed him a little. It was a stupid thing to do.
not as stupid as killing him.
what, that kid-- he's dead?
Yeah.
I want a lawyer.
according to his record, Randy Bolen used to be a professional stunt driver.
must not have been a very good one.
he teaches at that track off Boulder highway where middle
aged guys get to act out their grand prix fantasies.
okay. A guy like that gets beat by a punk kid on the street, it's gonna be an assault on his manhood.
he's got a temper.
okay. I'll see if I can place him at the hotel. I'll let you know.
Hey, arch. - Hey.
surveillance footage from the Palermo?
Yeah.
I just found something really interesting.
that's the blonde from the elevator.
there she is again.
and here's Jeff Powell.
this is where his evening begins, when he meets her for the first time.
she didn't look too happy.
Yeah.
keep watching when she points at something.
keep your eyes on her wine.
you think that was on purpose?
well, sure looks that way. Take a look at this.
girl was loaded.
it's safe to say she wasn't after him for his money.
Hey.
Hey.
warrants came through on the rental agreements.
Jeff powell went a little crazy with his corporate card and rented the Ferrari himself?
no. Heidi Wolff rented it.
the reservation was held in her name by a company called caprice unlimited.
this is where it gets interesting.
caprice unlimited also rented randy bolen's Corvette.
what kind of business is it?
all I know so far is that they're unlisted.
well, nothing's entirely unlisted these days.
anything is possible.
sounds like a sex business.
what are you going to say?
uh, something other than, "a guy is dead, and it looks like you're involved.
you've reached caprice unlimited.
leave a message;we shall call you.
not taking calls.
let's see if they're making any.
Triangulation's consistent.
caprice unlimited made the calls from this address.
according to the building owner, caprice is only renting it for two days.
no, not quite.
Oh, yes. Perfect.
you two, go get your costumes and find out what's expected of you.
why don't you wait for me inside?
I'm sorry.
this is a private residence.
my name is gil grissom, this is Sara Sidle. We're with the crime lab.
Anthony Caprice.
there's no crime here.
that was a job interview.
over $150, 000 has been spent on this event.
it's for several golf club salesman. They're from Kansas city.
japanese formality will mesh very nicely with their inherent midwestern restraint.
their idealized woman
submissive, but in control
becomes the geisha.
I get it.
you're one of those companies that stages fantasies, right?
everything appears real, but it's all been worked out in advance?
these scenarios take weeks to craft.
I learn everything about my client's wants and his desires, all without him even knowing.
secret longings
they have A...a kind of electricity.
they're often much more visible than we would want them to be.
and, uh, Jeff Powell's evening
the girl, the car, the billiards
all paid for by mick sheridan?
never heard of him.
who did pay?
a benefactor.
wishes to remain anonymous.
somebody rich who likes to manipulate people probably.
everybody likes to be in control.
you don't have to be rich to want that.
if you're so law-abiding, why did Heidi Wolff and Randy Bolen lie to the police about what happened?
did you tell them to do that?
all my employees have a very strict non-disclosure agreement that they have to sign, although, I'd never expect them to lie to the police.
maybe you just asked them the wrong questions.
here's a copy of Mr. Powell's scenario.
every event that they talked about was meticulously planned in advance and timed down to the minute.
and his murder?
tragic.
but it's not in my script.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hot tub to calibrate.
Oh.
and may all your dreams come true.
that's the first time that the tower yanked back my gulfstream on takeoff.
no kidding.
well, there's always a first for everything. We can talk in here.
something wrong with your office?
no.
you seem to have bad luck with the people who work for you.
if that's a joke, it's in pretty poor taste.
three years ago, you were busted with an eight ball of cocaine in your luggage.
you claimed that your personal assistant had planted it.
that's because he did. The charges against me were dropped.
the poor kid had a serious problem. I got him into a program.
understand he's doing better now.
I hear you bought him a car to shut him up and take the rap.
the media spins every...
the media.
we found an ounce of cocaine in Jeff Powell's personal effects.
he was buying drugs for you.
I don't do drugs.
and I had no idea that jeff had a drug problem.
last time, you bought a car, this time, an elaborate fantasy to shut him up.
problem is, he's dead.
and that makes you responsible.
captain Brass...
you've seen too many of my movies.
I'd like to call my attorney now.
the script for Jeeff's fantasy starts with heidi and randy renting the cars at 6: 00 P. M.
then it says randy drives the corvette to the Cue-T and waits.
and Heidi takes the Ferrari.
finds jeff at the Palermo bar.
her instructions were:"Act upset.
make up story about abusive high roller boyfriend.
allow Jeff to offer comfort.
sorry. I'm really okay.
no, I'm not.
anything I can do for you?
it's my damn boyfriend.
any guy would help a beautiful woman in distress, right?
some guys are intimidated by beauty or fear rejection.
evidently, caprice knew Jeff Well enough to know he'd want to help her.
Heidi's next instructions were:"Repay subject's kindness by buying drink.
which she then accidentally spills on his clothes.
insists on buying him a new outfit, one that he couldn't afford on his own.
everything was scripted down to the minute
the clothes, the car.
Sheridan told caprice that Jeff had been shooting pool since he was a kid.
so betting on and winning a big money game was probably just part of the fantasy.
Yeah, and he was a Nascar Fan.
so the whole staged car chase, narrow getaway was everything he dreamed about.
as was the partying in his hotel room. And the sex.
not quite.
according to the script, "your employment ends with the good-night kiss.
you are not requested to perform, "nor compensated for,"any activity you initiate beyond this point.
should nature take its course, you are on your own.
so the staged fantasy ended at Jeff's hotel room.
which means he was off script when he was killed.
I don't get it.
after a night like that, I would have felt like superman.
why leave the girl?
the victim got to the shopping arcade 15 minutes after he got off the elevator.
it's not that long a walk. I need to know what he was doing during that time.
there's your guy.
whatever he's reacting to is off camera.
somewhere in the direction of the Baccarat tables.
when the blonde came up to the vic in the bar the first time, she pointed in that same direction.
what's going on over there?
he's playing solo with the dealer.
that's ten or 20, 000 a hand. Guy's a whale.
your vic's really going at him.
you know, Heidi was only supposed to tell a story about a high roller boyfriend.
maybe she actually picked somebody out.
what are you doing?
I've been looking at video three days solid now.
my butt fell asleep.
wait a second.
I've seen those guys behind him somewhere else.
hang on.
Jeff went from the casino to shopping arcade, and right behind him, it's them.
same guys.
well, call me Ishmael.
Why?
you need to read more, Arch.
Jeff was a winner at everything he tried that night.
and he was falling in love.
which can make a guy do some pretty stupid things.
so anytime more than $10, 000 hits the table, the casino's required to I. D. The player.
which may help us harpoon a whale.
Yep.
what's the occasion?
we're investigating the death of the young man on the casino's loading dock.
are you familiar with this guy?
that's Dennis Kim.
flies in four, five times a year from seoul to play baccarat.
very generous player.
we reserve a table exclusively for him while he's in town.
he still in town?
Yeah.
he's at his table right now.
player has two.
Mr. Kim, we need to speak with you for a moment.
yes?
do you recognize this man?
Why?
he's dead.
just before he died, he was talking to you.
Oh, yes, I remember him.
he was shouting about some girl.
hey you!
Hey! Guess what?
Heidi, she doesn't need you or your money anymore, man.
that's right. Because she has everything she needs now
love and respect.
so you go ahead and play your little card game. All right?
cause you the playa.
but I'm the man.
the man.
crazy boy.
did you guys see where he went?
well, we're gonna need to take those shoes.
white paint.
and if I don't permit this?
we'll just hold your men until we get a warrant.
the bodyguards dragged Jeff through the service corridor.
between the drugs and the confidence, he must've put up quite a fight.
Hey!
most likely, he was still alive when they left.
they probably thought they just had taught him a lesson.
they did: Don't confuse fantasy with reality.
well, hush money or not, you have to admit that whole fantasy night thing was a pretty cool gift from a very generous boss.
Greg, don't you have a birthday coming up?
why, yes, Sara, I do.
I'm thinking ear-shredding rock, a beautiful model, boatloads of sushi and latex.
eh, that was last year.
I think fantasies are best kept private.
Hey.
want to know why Jeff left the girl and went downstairs?
okay.
this was dropped off at the Palermo.
manager sent it over.
nice rocks.
Jeff must have spent the ten g's he won playing pool on it.
gift wrapped, never picked it up.
Yeah, there was a jewelry store right across from the service corridor entrance.
most I ever spent on a girl.
most I ever held in my hand at one time.
you know, the biggest fantasy in Vegas is that everything here happens by chance.
nothing here happens by chance.
the odds are set before you get off the plane.
you know, I'd settle for a birthday breakfast.
now that is a fantasy.
Catherine, layout room, right away!
Gil, where's the fire?
it's been sitting in my office for the last four weeks.
But...we caught the miniature serial killer; he confessed.
Yeah, I watched him blew his brains out.
but I think the package was postmarked after he killed himself.
so maybe he arranged to have it sent postmortem.
the three other murders, the miniature was left at the scene.
this one was addressed to me.
so, now it's personal?
the victim appears to be a Caucasian female with lots of books.
it could be an office, somebody's living room...
or a modern hotel lobby.
when I was gone, did anybody work a scene like this?
No...at least not on our shift.
I'll check with days and swing, and see if anybody caught a case that matches.
never mind.
why not?
take a look at the early edition.
saturday, February 17, 2007
it's dated the day after tomorrow.
this murder hasn't happened yet.
I was born in 1946 in Ames, Iowa.
my life's been hard, but I don't complain.
I never expected better.
I'm good with my hands.
I make things.
I fix things.
I'm a handyman.
that's what I am.
I'm not the sociable type.
I-I know that.
you spend any amount of time around people, you get your heart broke -- treachery, hypocrisy...
the promise of love.
a man has a right to an honest day's pay.
me, I service the machinery of death so that people can eat.
if that makes me evil, then so be it.
the miniature killer murdered three people over a period of roughly six months.
Ernie Dell was either directly or indirectly related to all of them.
what's with the bloody dolls?
we're not sure.
there's a different perspective of that same image in all of the miniatures.
we're thinking it could be some kind of signature.
look into the mouth of a person and you'll find lies wriggling there like maggots waiting to grow wings.
the world has...has gone mad.
a man could kill from sunup to sunset, and still his work would never be done.
remember the blue paint killers?
maybe Ernie Dell had a partner.
like an apprentice, an accomplice, something like that.
or a disciple.
you guys make models when you were kids?
tanks and airplanes.
classic cars.
these miniatures are obsessively precise, half-inch scale models of the crime scenes.
they probably took weeks of focused effort to create.
I don't think the killer's into team sports.
Izzy Delancy...he was a rock star.
you know, famous brings out the nut jobs.
maybe we're just looking at a copycat.
the miniatures were never released to the press.
no photos, nothing.
you can't copy what you can't see.
other people had access to those files.
maybe it was a cop.
or somebody in the lab.
it's been known to happen.
Yeah, so, Ernie Dell takes the rap for three murders, and then eats a . 38. Why?
I think he was trying to protect someone
someone that he cared a lot about.
prints and DNA are going over the package and wrapping paper.
they won't find anything.
return address was an empty lot.
any clue as to who the victim is?
no, I even went through her little purse.
well, she's not wearing a wedding ring.
she's probably single.
her eyes appear to be bloodshot.
petechial hemorrhaging?
grissom: Look at this.
blue smudges on the pillow.
blue mascara on the victim.
our vic gets comfortable, grabs a little shut-eye...
and never wakes up.
she's going to be smothered.
it would seem so.
another body found.
if you interpret this headline literally, the doll is the victim.
that's different than the others.
methods change.
killers evolve.
what?
Keppler said something like that once.
he did come down on the right side.
these books are all arranged by subject matter: Art, religion, science...
the victim is apparently well-educated.
that's from the Izzy Delancy miniature.
what's it doing here?
I don't know.
grissom: There's something on the surface.
looks like brush strokes.
you
you were wrong.
Hey, Sara, I heard we got another miniature.
is that true?
Yeah, it's like Ernie Dell was covering for someone.
no kidding?
Hey, you were the one who checked for next of kin after his suicide, right?
sop.
snail mail, email, bank accounts, police records, google.
all I got was he's a widower.
received his wife's social security benefits.
he had to be connected to somebody.
it's kind of early for court.
finally rescheduled my deposition for the civil suit.
you know, Demitrius James' family is suing the city for 3.5 million.
that's going to be a long deposition.
home movies.
Hey, boss.
we're ordering out for breakfast.
you have a cat, don't you, Hodges?
Mr. K. Kobayashi - Maru.
it's in reference to...
do you ever take him out of the house?
my little Kobe?
no way.
Vegas is coyote country.
so if this is a house cat, then this must be somebody's home.
tsk, tsk.
looks like he's been in the milk.
Yeah. Maybe the victim has as well.
the previous murders have all involved the victim's habits and routines.
so maybe this time, it's a little something extra in her afternoon tea.
so they're going to be poisoned.
she lays down for her usual nap, the cat sneaks a sip, and neither one ever wakes up again.
it doesn't matter how she dies if we can't figure out who she is or where she is.
well, you can't figure that out on an empty stomach.
if you don't like this restaurant, there's plenty of others to choose from.
I choose these two.
we're looking for a building whose exterior looks exactly like this.
talk to me.
so what are we looking at, Rick?
we've got a modernist structure with cement beams steel rails, frosted glass.
something like that.
probably, but whatever it is, it should match exactly.
the killer's hyper-specific.
well, maybe that'll work in our favor.
even if we find a match, we could already be too late.
let's check it out.
Nick Stokes, lvpd.
we're looking for a woman that lives in this building.
she looks like this.
have you ever seen her?
that looks like a doll.
Yeah, well, it's actually a death threat.
time is of the essence here.
can you help us out? Anyone in the building look like this?
no. - She's got a cat.
well, that narrows it down to about a hundred tenants.
that's her home.
1106. That's Ms. Tallman's place.
ms. Tallman?
Las Vegas police.
you need to open your door, please.
ms. Tallman?
open and stand clear.
please, ma'am, calm down.
we're with the crime lab.
this isn't a lab.
this is my home.
you must be confused.
no, we're not confused.
we're here for your protection.
ms. Tallman...
Dr. Tallman. Dr. Tallman...
I need you to take a look at this.
did you make this for me?
that's very sweet.
it's a death threat.
who would want to kill me?
doctor, do you normally take a nap around the same time every day covering your face and eyes with the pillow?
Yes, at 4: 00 P. M.
I...I have tea and cookies every day when I wake up.
have you been watching me?
no, miss, no, but we think someone else has.
doctor, your life is in danger.
we need you to get dressed and come with us, please.
am I in trouble?
no, ma'am. No, not anymore.
this officer will help you get your things, okay?
no, no, no.
I'll go get my things.
I want you to know that you young men are refreshingly polite.
thank you.
is she on something?
she may have already been poisoned.
we'll get her to the hospital.
we should collect blood for tox.
and any open food or drink.
Hey, go on, shoo!
the killer did plan every detail.
except for us showing up.
that's got to be Ernie Dell's wife.
quite the bash.
they must love kids.
is that Ernie's son?
there's no record of a son, but it sure looks like it.
sidle: One, two, three, four, five birthday candles in 1988
would make him around 24 now.
don't look like a very happy birthday.
did you get the boy's name?
cake never made it on camera.
how about audio?
it sucks.
80s video cam with built-in, non-directional mic, pulls in nothing but wind and train noise.
so let's process it.
this is processed.
we ran tox on Ms. Tallman's blood as well as her milk and cookies.
she was negative on everything from pharmaceuticals and illicits, to herbicides, pesticides and heavy metals.
you sure she was going to be poisoned?
no, but I'm pretty sure she was scheduled to die today.
in each of the previous cases, the killer was at the scene to commit the murder.
so maybe he was planning to show up at the condo.
well, it'd be kind of rude not to greet him, don't you think?
I'm ready for my close-up.
definitely beats walking the beat.
feed's good.
officer Kamen, how's your read?
time to go to sleep.
all units, this is Brass.
maintain a low profile.
that means I don't want to see a uniform within three blocks of this place, okay?
where you headed?
eleven.
Oh, sorry. Ten.
go on up.
hold the elevator.
what floor?
eleven.
someone's coming up.
white male with a suitcase.
we got a possible.
LVPD. Up against the wall.
what?
she said hands against the wall.
what's your business here, sir?
nothing.
I mean, this is my sister's place.
I'm Peyton Tallman.
Where's Barbara? Did something happen to her?
this officer will explain everything to your satisfaction.
get him out of here.
what?
Peyton Tallman's id checks out.
and I kind of doubt the killer's going to make a miniature crime scene of his own sister's house.
and we have nothing to link him to the other three murders?
he wants to see his sister.
I'll let you know how that goes down.
okay.
Thanks.
okay, that's it.
killer's not gonna show.
let's call it a night.
all right, I know you must be exhausted from your brutal day in the field, but it's time to go.
officer Kamen?
she's pale.
no sign of trauma.
Cod'll have to wait till autopsy.
sorry.
not as sorry as I am.
but the sooner we get done here, the sooner we can all go home.
Why? So my little tripper can run out to greet me?
I'm sorry about your cat, ma'am.
we lost an officer.
how much did you love her?
barbara, please.
when my guys went to your house, they said you were a little out of it, but you're thinking clearly now, right?
well, having your home invaded can be a little bracing.
captain, how can we help?
can you tell me why anyone would want to kill you?
no.
but you can.
well, Barbara was a highly regarded psychotherapist.
is. That hasn't changed.
is or was?
I'm retired.
you seem a little young to be retired.
I got tired of it.
can you tell me why one of her patients would want to kill her?
no.
well, no, it's-it's possible. She, um...
she counseled a lot of at-risk adults, halfway house kids, pro bono.
I also treated suburban sexual dysfunction for $300 an hour.
she helped a lot of people.
did you work out of your home?
for the last few years.
treat any sociopaths?
that's not a term for which there's any diagnostic criteria.
you're not looking for one of my patients.
well, maybe I am.
maybe I'm looking for a 20-something-year-old male, last name of Dell.
won't say.
she can't say.
it's doctor-patient confidentiality.
but you're retired.
well, you know where I live.
are you done yet?
no, we're not done yet.
at least, I'm not done yet.
all right, look, let's start again, all right?
let's...
maybe we started off on the wrong foot, all right?
look, I'm asking you as a professional, as a psychotherapist, please...
help me out here.
okay?
tell me...
what am I looking for?
repetition...
attention to detail indicates obsessive-compulsive disorder.
obvious antisocial personality.
uh, yeah, four bodies
I'd call that antisocial.
most murderers lack impulse control, inability to plan ahead, but...
this one's different.
different how?
he conceives murder...
visualizes it.
then he takes all that horror that he's imagined.
he compresses it into these little rooms.
these models literally indicate repressed rage.
and when you start taking that apart, all that rage comes flying out...
and you will have let the monster out of the box.
stop hovering, Hodges.
you're in or you're out.
in.
so, she wasn't poisoned, huh?
no.
hand me a scalpel.
tweezers.
nice lungs.
Yeah, Gil, got a good idea on cod for your asphyxiated officer.
internal organ color nailed it on both the autopsy and necropsy as...
carbon monoxide poisoning.
you know, nobody likes when you do that.
so, how did co get into the room?
that I don't know.
the timer goes off, activating the motor, which closes the flue and drops powdered charcoal onto the flames, producing carbon monoxide.
fumes have nowhere to go but out into the apartment, into officer Kamen.
and the cat.
you know, this timer was geared to run for weeks.
it could have easily been put in place a month ago.
that's why the killer felt safe enough to send me the miniature.
he never intended to be at the scene.
there was no danger of being caught.
Hey, Sara, check this out.
I was digging through Mannleigh Chicken's employee health insurance records...
45 million Americans without health coverage, and a chicken slaughterhouse provides medical benefits?
Izzy Delancy's animal rights PSA forced the company to clean up its act in all departments.
anyway, Ernie Dell had one dependent listed:
a son.
unbelievable.
Yeah, the man loved his trains.
Lionel changed his name to Mitchell Douglas after he turned 18, and get this.
he did time in a halfway house after getting busted for fentanyl.
which connects him to the fentanyl-dealing sexagenarian, Penny Garden.
Where's young Dell now?
my name is Mitch Douglas.
I'm Sara Sidle.
I'm with the crime lab.
I was wondering if you knew this woman.
she used to sell fentanyl.
want me to pee in a cup?
what about this guy?
he's dead, too.
he was found face down in a chicken stun bath in a place your dad used to work.
he worked a lot of places.
I met a lot of people.
did you know Izzy Delancy?
Yeah.
his music sucks.
what do all these stiffs got to do with me?
what was your relationship like with your father?
before or after he blew his brains out?
let's start with...
before.
you ever step in a pile of crap, but you're wearing boots, so you can't just scrape it off.
you got to dig it out with a stick, but even that doesn't work, so you just end up tossing the boots in the trash?
it was kind of like that.
and after?
much better.
you gonna arrest me?
we're just talking.
I'm not.
did you know officer Kamen?
no.
me, neither.
I was watching her die, and I didn't even realize it.
look, Sofia, there weren't any carbon monoxide sensors in the apartment, so no one could have known.
and in fact, if I hadn't have gone away, we'd have had another month to work with;
you'd have never been in that position.
it doesn't make you feel any better either, does it?
you know, the scene's been released.
ms. Tallman was pretty insistent.
we offered to leave a uniform with her, but she wasn't having it.
so, what are you looking for?
the miniature's complete.
it's not perfect, though.
officer Kamen was not the intended victim.
well, she was dressed like her.
she died in the right position.
so did the cat.
I'm still not sure it's perfect enough.
Yeah.
okay.
now, it's perfect.
it's Deja vu all over again.
not entirely.
there's some kind of liquid.
it looks like it fell and splashes on the floor...
and the body...
and it looks like...
the ear.
this could be the source.
killer returns to...
complete the miniature the old-fashioned way.
and things get a little messy.
but in the end...
he puts everything right back where it belongs.
what happened to my sister was not just some isolated tragedy.
there have been four other murders, four deaths which could have been prevented had the public been warned by the people sworn to protect us.
Barbara Tallman was the latest victim of a serial killer...
the lvpd has known about for months.
what do they call him?
they call him "the miniature killer,"
because he makes little models of his victims posed in the places where they die.
I feel for the guy, but he just made our job a lot harder.
it was inevitable.
with each murder, the amount of information that could leak rose exponentially.
I'm a private person, but if this prevents just one tragedy, then it's worth it.
trace report on the second crime scene or...
or should I say second murder?
crime scene is the same.
haven't finished processing all the samples, but the water from the vase is consistent with the water found on the victim's clothing.
there's chlorine bleach in the samples.
why put bleach in vase water?
I knew you'd ask that.
I had this girlfriend who was a florist...
the one with the water retention problem.
you remembered.
anyway...
she said that if you add a few drops of bleach to your water, it kills bacteria, and gives your flowers a nice long life, but add too much...
the flowers die.
we may have caught a break on Barbara Tallman.
she did pro bono work at Lionel Dell's halfway house.
okay, so maybe I met her. So what?
so, she's dead.
that's four stiffs associated with you, Lionel.
five, if you count Ernie.
I don't.
you know, you keep saying that you hated your dad, but I'm not buying it.
you go through your life alone.
you're good with your hands.
you have weird hobbies.
you make little things.
and when that gets tricky...
you call your father.
maybe Ernie didn't know you were a killer.
police start poking around, asking questions, showing him pictures.
and when Ernie sees these...
he knows exactly what his little boy's become.
to the rest of the world, a monster, but to him...
just a little boy knocking over his birthday cake.
so he confesses to crimes you committed, shoots himself in the head;
it's a dead end for us.
new start for you.
if only.
let me tell you about Ernie.
what he cared about in this life was...
his wife, his trains, and his kids.
in that order.
kids?
you're an only child.
again, if only.
if you're looking for a love connection, then...
then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.
what are you talking about?
Fosters.
my parents had, like...dozens.
they'd come and go, some before I was born.
my mom loved kids.
dad loved mom.
I guess as soon as I came around...
the love ran out.
and then mom dies...
the kids leave...
and Ernie's left with me.
Ernie didn't take a bullet for me.
but it's a beautiful thought.
I pulled these fibers out of her nasal passages.
they appear to be consistent with the sofa pillow cushion at the scene.
cod was asphyxiation.
now...
what is wrong with this brain?
other than the fact that it's out of its skull?
Pigmentation's unusual.
bingo...
or keno or whatever you prefer.
pronounced lack of pigmentation near the midbrain, along with...
clearly diminished substantia nigra.
she had Parkinson's.
Nick and Warrick did say that she was a little...
spacey when they met her, but they didn't mention any shaking.
her disease was advanced.
she was on some pretty heavy meds.
would they have shown up on a poison tox panel?
no, but those kinds of medications can cause abnormal thinking and behavior.
takes somebody with a very strong will to keep it hidden.
how'd it go with the sheriff?
media's all over him.
which means he's all over the undersheriff, who's all over Ecklie, who's blaming me for not going public with the Izzy Delancy miniature like he told me to.
I got the final trace report on the bleach water that spilled at the scene, but...
the fluid in the ear was biological.
water and proteins.
Lipocalin, lactoferrin, lysozyme.
tears.
the victim was crying?
the smudges are from the pillow.
there were no tear tracks.
I don't think the victim was crying.
I think the killer was.
when you cry, your tears sometimes can pick up skin cells from your cheek.
the DNA in your tears that were found on your sister's body prove that you were there.
I imagine it was the hardest thing you've ever done.
but you did it.
you should've seen Barbara when she was young.
she was fierce.
and fearless.
she protected me.
she was the smartest, the funniest, best friend I could ask for in life.
the Parkinson's just robbed her of everything.
she'd take medication;
she'd go away.
she'd get off medication.
she'd become lucid again, only in agony.
she wanted to die in her own home.
there's no...
assisted suicide protection in Nevada.
she said this was the perfect opportunity.
she could get what she wanted, and...
everyone would blame the miniature killer.
I understand.
you're under arrest.
we reran the footage several times to get a head count.
assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's 13 of them.
at this birthday party?
Yeah.
Lionel only remembered the first names, and only a few of those.
getting the DHS records is going to be tough.
judges hate giving them out unless we can demonstrate a pressing need...
and even then, they're spotty.
and a lot of a foster kids change their names when they age out.
Ernie Dell confessed and killed himself to protect someone that he loved.
and that someone has murdered five people.
have a seat.
how's the arm?
fractured in two places.
Gil, Conrad again.
um... Message number three.
call me back please.
it's feeling better? - Yeah.
good.
so, you must know where he is.
actually, I don't.
Really?
okay, um...
look, I don't want to play any games here.
this is as difficult for me as it is for you.
so let's just, uh, get this over with, shall we?
okay then, uh, this is an administrative inquiry.
you and your supervisor were in direct violation of lab policy...
are.
are in direct violation of lab policy which states that members of the same forensic team may not engage in a romantic relationship.
so when did you and supervisor Grissom begin your relationship?
we've always had a relationship.
I mean when did you become intimate?
two years ago.
I think it was a Sunday.
sagebrush valley high school.
the cobras.
he looks like he could still be in high school.
boy, football's gotten a lot more brutal since my playing days.
Yeah, where's the rest of him, still on the field?
there's no high school football fields around here anyway.
what do you think, Grissom?
Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.
blood pool tells me the helmet must've been here for a while.
vehicle tire rolled through it.
helmet has black abrasions on it consistent with being hit by a tire.
probably got pinballed down the road.
I checked with traffic.
no reports of any traffic accidents near here.
uh, Holstein's getting an absentee list from the high school.
head's over there.
blood trail leads up from here.
we follow the blood.
he say anything about what's happening with Sara?
no.
Hey, did Sara ever say anything to you about her and Grissom?
not in so many words.
so you knew about the two of them?
Yeah.
Hey!
Where's the uniform?
if he's not a player, what's with the helmet?
maybe he's a rabid fan.
there were all kinds of high school games last night.
Where's his hand?
got to be around here somewhere.
the hand-- where did you find it?
20 yards away, two hours later.
David, he doesn't look prepped.
what's taking so long?
I can't get the helmet off.
I better get this ten-card to mandy right away.
hold it.
his face looks like hamburger.
I found the same blck powder on his clothes.
Hey, mandy.
I got a ten-card on our john doe.
well, let's see if it matches the safe-kit that Holstein brought in.
only have one more kid unaccounted for at that high school.
Hey, if you had a kid, would you collect a safe-kit on them?
why not?
it's better to be prepared.
think of it as a cheap insurance policy.
it's just a print card, a cheek swab and a photo.
then go to bed every night hoping you don't have to use it.
well, there's a match.
your john doe is Vincent Bartley. - Yeah?
Yeah.
okay, good.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
well, nothing.
I mean, it was dark. - It was really dark.
one minute we're married, and the next...
you know what? Good for you.
divorces should be like band-aids, one quick yank and done.
you think?
Oh, what do I know?
Eddie and I stayed together way too long.
every decision was an act of congress.
it's the end of an era, ladies and gentlemen.
Hampton huxley, publisher of hux magazine -
where boys became men, and men became more manly-- has died.
that magazine got me through vietnam.
Oh, that would explains the lookers out front.
they were kitties.
Yes, kitties, indeed.
he was dining with a couple of them when he bought the farm.
miss summer and miss winter, I believe.
every male in the phillips family gets a lifetime subscription to hux for his bar mitzvah.
I guess my sons will have to settle for a cross pen.
I'm sure the magazine will go on without him, Dave.
what are we looking at?
puncture wound.
no abrasion ring.
but I can reapproximate the skin.
so it's probably not a gunshot.
stabbing?
maybe.
right through the temple, into the brain.
be lights out in seconds.
it's a crowded restaurant.
somebody must have seen something.
not exactly.
welcome to the latest fad.
dining in the dark.
waiters are blind.
no one sees anything.
piece of cake, huh?
dining should be an experience, like opera or art.
it should feed the soul as well as the belly.
you should smell it, touch it and let it rest on your tongue.
I'm selling sensuality here.
I encourage eating with your hands.
texture is crucial.
the salty, meaty flesh of lobster drenched in creamy, clarified french butter.
the pulpy seeded flesh, and firm skin of a fresh fig dipped in honey.
the tongue understands four major taste groups
salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and has over 10, 000 taste buds, each with a direct connection to the pleasure center of the brain, triggering endorphins.
the anticipation and the release of eating good food is chemically quite similar to getting high on drugs.
and apparently just as dangerous.
so tell me what happened.
I don't know.
each one of the waiters has one of those clickers.
if there's an emergency, the houselights come up and a red light goes off in the kitchen.
are you okay?
call 9-1-1.
Oh, so you didn't see anything?
I'm in the kitchen.
I have two sittings a night, at 7: 00 and 10: 00, average 25 heads, ten courses per.
I have no time to pee.
april was here...
and huxley was here.
okay.
got blood on the chair.
blood on the tablecloth.
blood drops on the floor, leading away from hux's chair.
stab him. Extract the weapon.
drip, drip, drip.
and they end here.
near Ms. Shasta.
Shasta mccloud-- big "m," little "c," big "c," plus "loud."
on TV, they never show anyone bleeding from a heart attack.
is that what you think happened?
well, yeah. I mean, all that prevalis and diet soda.
I just figured...
april, shh!
he was an animal until the day he died, sir.
wait a minute.
what did happen?
Well-well, you're the one with blood on you.
maybe you can tell me.
I thought he just fell asleep like he always does at the end of meals.
come on!
wake up, Huxey.
wake up, Huxey.
wake up, Huxey-hux.
come on, it's time to go.
meow, meow!
meow, meow!
waiter! Emergency!
April? April, what's wrong?! - Call 9-1-1! Help!
April! April! - Michael here.
code red!
help!
help us!
okay. Um, look, I'm going to need to take your sweater.
Yeah, like I haven't heard that one before.
no. No, I don't mean right now.
no, I mean, I...I'll need to take it before I go.
you know, later, when I, when I leave, I have to take your sweater then.
Mr. Bartley?
Matt.
I'm Vincent's brother.
I'm...Nick. Stokes.
you don't need to say it.
I knew when the detective asked me for that safe-kit that it was going to be Vinnie.
shouldn't I be talking to your parents?
don't have any parents.
mom skipped out when we were little, and dad died a couple years ago.
it's just the two of us.
your brother wasn't on the football team, but when we found him, he was wearing a football helmet.
why is that?
it was my old helmet.
is that how you got injured?
no.
it was the last day of spring break, and...
I was wasted.
like a dumb-ass, I dove into the tangiers wave pool headfirst.
fractured my T-1 vertebra.
so why the helmet?
well, I was a pretty good football player.
he was proud of that.
that and my dad's dragon belt.
he got it when he was in the service.
Vinnie wears it every day.
it's just something that he has to hold onto...to deal with.
Yeah.
you know, one of these could've been the murder weapon.
it's approximate in size and shape.
and everybody had one.
well, something dripped over here that is not blood.
well, could've been whatever food was on the skewers.
als will pick up anything that's fatty or dairy-based.
could you turn off the lights for a second?
I'm sorry, but this is a stupid idea for a restaurant.
I need to see what I'm eating.
I can see just fine.
where are you?
Hi. - Hi.
night vision goggles?
Yeah, someone left these behind.
kind of defeats the purpose of dining in the dark.
unless you don't come here for the food.
Mr. Nivens.
are these yours?
I'll take that as a "yes.
wait, wait...I didn't kill anyone.
then why would your bring military-grade, night vision goggles to the restaurant?
a hunch.
sweetheart, you want to try some of my steak?
no, thanks.
I'm all good.
always be suspicious when your wife wants to dine in the dark with another couple.
you brought night vision goggles to spy on me during dinner?
damn right.
millions of tires wear out ever year.
you ever wonder where all that rubber dust goes?
no, I don't.
the black powder trace you found in your victim's clothing was tire rubber.
it's not surprising. We found the body on the side of the highway.
of course you would expect that.
however, I did find some very interesting type of rubber.
okay, Hodges, dazzle me.
truck tires have 27% isoprene and 14% neoprene.
that's what makes them so hard.
passenger tires have a lower isoprene-to-neoprene ratio, but they also have silica for fuel economy and wet traction.
go-cart tires, or "slicks," to those in the know, have much higher levels of carbon black and oil, resulting in extremely high traction.
guess I better get my go-cart on.
you know, just so you know, I'm a bit of go-cart enthusiast myself.
Oh, uh...that's awesome.
have you seen this guy before?
day before yesterday.
day before that, and the day before that.
Oh, man, did he get in trouble?
are these the race stats?
you keep record of them?
Yeah, all in here.
people ask for them every day like they're some sort of trophy.
could you print out vincent bartley's trophy from the last time he was here?
Yeah. But I'm not getting him in trouble, am I?
no. No, not really.
you know, when I was a kid, we used to make these things out of lunch trays and old lawn mower engines.
when I was kid, I used to make bombs, little bombs.
Oh."Vinnie Vroom."
won all three of his races.
beat out a guy named "Hot Rod."
Vinnie ran circles around him.
Yes. Yes.
Yes, is that all you got?
is that all you got?
Rodney went from being a-rod to being no-rod.
Hey, there he is, right there.
Aw, come on.
Hey, if you guys want to race, then you guys have to wear dresses, huh?
get your skill up, all right.
I need some competition here.
hot Rod!
get out of the truck!
get out of the truck now!
get out of the truck now!
nothing says "I'm guilty" like running from the cops, dumb-ass.
give me his wallet.
we're with the vegas crime lab, Mr. Banks.
Hey, I didn't do nothing.
you got quite a mess here, Rod.
mind if I take a look?
Where'd you get that belt?
I don't know. - Where?
I don't know.
blood.
looks like things just got a lot hotter for you, Rod.
all skewers accounted for, none of them bloody.
we've got a high-profile dead guy in a locked-room situation, with 16 diners and three blind waiters.
give me something.
how about a band-aid with petals?
it's not a band-aid.
it's a nipple flower.
what's it doing at a table with four guys?
can I go to the bathroom? Please, please, please?!
again? - Yes, sir.
okay. What's so funny?
we slipped a laxative in his beer in the dark.
it's his sixth trip to the can.
it's freakin' hilarious.
what are you guys, like 12 years old?
Oh, hey, hey, curly.
how come you're so pretty in pink?
breast exam.
you know doctors without boundaries, if you know what I mean.
you guys, come here.
it's total darkness.
there's two kitties. That's four...
they're all up for grabs!
I'm going on a mission of mercy.
who is that?
stop it.
save it for later.
what are you talking about?
that's not you, Hux?
somebody's touching me!
sweet mother.
guys, they're real-- both of them!
waiter? Waiter, we have a problem over here.
Yeah, I lead Mr. Manducci back to his seat.
he and his brothers had had quite a bit to drink.
so it was the blind leading the drunk, huh?
I could do it with my eyes closed.
well, did you, did you hear anything unusual?
no. Everyone seemed to be having a good time.
until the woman in the fuzzy dress shrieked.
I found Mr. Huxley slumped forward.
checked for a pulse, and he didn't have one, so I turned on the emergency lights.
then she really screamed.
is she pretty?
she had a pretty girl scream.
Oh, man.
she's a huxley kitty.
she's gorgeous.
Hey, uh...
let me ask you something.
did you wash your hands?
force of habit; I'm sorry. Waiter.
okay, we're going to have to take your prints, okay?
sure.
we're going to walk, straight ahead.
looks like there was some kind of struggle.
sticky.
what do you think it is?
honey?
the detective needs to ask us some questions.
Hi, Nanci Katz.
soon to be Ellis.
I'm Jim Brass.
so, what happened, Nanci?
Oh, um...ask him.
Oh, uh, well, I-I thought it would be romantic...
I have not ever tasted a fig this juicy.
Oh, they're so good.
it's like they're, it's like, it's better than the newtons.
it's so much better.
Oh, god!
baby, are you okay?
Yeah, um...
what happened? - Yeah.
uh...a thing...I'm, uh, okay.
it's Michael here.
is everyone all right?
Oh, uh, yeah.
Michael, I'm just...
I'm trying to get something going here.
Oh, no problem, sir. I'll leave you two alone.
okay.
uh, baby, where's your...
ever since I met you, i've known I wanted to ask you this question.
would you be my wife?
will you marry me?
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
I can't even see it, but it feels big.
the ring, I mean.
sure, yeah.
Congratulations.
so how'd you bump your noggin?
it was dark; nobody, could see.
I wanted to say yes.
loud and clear.
there's a lot of metal under those tables.
there really is, yeah.
way too much.
it's not safe.
I bet.
losing the race was just the beginning.
then, you killed him, cut his body up.
and dumped it on the side of the road.
whoa, man.
I swear I didn't kill anybody.
or I didn't cut anybody up or dump 'em.
all I did was ask him for a rematch...
off the track, where it really counts.
so your statement is he just spontaneously lost his head?
Yeah.
you know, one minute, he's staring at me.
the next, I look back, and the headless horseman is driving his cart.
and then what happened?
so why you just didn't ditch the carts?
Christin, that...
that girl at the track, she let us sneak out with them.
you know, my life was turning into a horror movie -
I didn't want to bring her in on it.
you've been dodging me; it's time to talk.
Gil, nobody wants to hear about your love life less than I do,
but since you didn't handle this right, I have to take a formal statement.
should've been a conversation between friends.
I mean, we could've fnd some way around this.
Catherine could have done Sara's evaluations.
why didn't you just tell me?
we didn't want you to know.
don't most women like the world to know they're dating someone?
where do you get your information about women, Conrad?
okay, so, when did you two, you know?
nine years ago.
you know what?
you two need to get your stories straight.
there's road gravel embedded in all these tires.
Yeah, but no visible blood on that one.
got a worn area on this front bumper.
some brown trace.
same goes for the rear of that one.
well, if it turns out to be leather, it would confirm hot Rod's story that he towed the second cart back using Vinnie's belt.
got what looks like...blood on this wheel well.
this is the victim's cart.
must have been movin' when his head popped off.
well, another one for the scrapbk.
OO boy, he looks different without hair.
never knew he wore a toupee.
Oh, uh, it had something sticky on it, so I bagged it for trace.
but if you want, we could put it back on for the photo op.
no, that's okay; let's get to cutting.
embedded horizontally in the parenchyma of the right temporal lobe is a linear, silver-toned, metal tube that tapers to a point.
and in this case, David, the pen may be mightier than the sword.
okay.
okay, that pen's not mine.
Yeah. Nice try, sweetheart.
excuse me.
can I be lucy logic for a bit?
first of all, that purse is designer.
there's no way I'm ruining it with ink.
second of all, I know where my bread is buttered.
hux was my meal tick --kill him, go hungry.
unless you're in the will.
kitties don't get in the will.
besides, if I had touched that thing, wouldn't I have ink on my hands?
whoever did it ditched the pen in my bag.
it was on the back of my chair the whole time.
it could have been anyone.
what about the guy who assaulted me?
Shasta: Look, if you really want a suspect, you need to check out little miss chef lady.
little miss chef lady?
why is that? - Hello.
duh, she's... Winter issue?
1995.0
you certainly weren't hiding anything back then. Hmm?
ms. Sanchez, according to your fellow kitties, you and Huxley had a falling out.
it's curious that you didn't mention that.
I didn't mention it, because it's ancient history.
12 years ago, a misogynist told me I should eat less.
and today, I now have a hot restaurant on the strip and two contracts for spots in L. A.and chicago.
"food seduction" is a best-seller.
I think I won that battle already.
so, did you and Huxley speak to each other last night?
his reservation was booked under a pseudonym.
I didn't even know he was there.
Mr. Brass, do you know why I started my restaurant?
no. Tell me.
because I fell in love with a blind man.
he would turn off the lights and feed me.
when you deprive one sense, other senses are heightened.
my only focus was on my tongue.
it was brilliant.
and then he died.
and this restaurant is an homage to him.
to our love affair.
how nice for you.
I don't mean to be crude, but a murder is, quite frankly, bad for business.
Hey. - Hey.
so, huxley had honey on his hairpiece, ink in his brain and blood all over.
there were three people who had honey on their hands:
the frisky couple and Michael.
two people who had blood on their clothing: April and Michael.
and there was a total of five people moving around the room:
two Manducci brothers and all three waiters.
now, that's a lot of lists for Michael to turn up on.
he does work there, so there's reason for it, but...
well, there's no reason for this.
Michael's print in ink, on a napkin.
what would he have against Huxley?
his prints hit back to an old work card.
the guy used to be a chef.
a blind chef? - He lost his sight a few years back.
but before that, guess who was his sous-chef?
the man knew his way around a kitchen, "and his way into my heart."
michael would spend hours teaching me, feeding me... Loving me.
so, you're the dead guy?
she seduces me, steals my recipes, my ideas, my investors.
and then she hires me as a freaking waiter.
night after night, I listen to her tell stories of the tragic love affair, of the poor, dead blind guy.
last night, I finally confronted her.
I deserve a piece of the action.
at $200 a head, you're clearing at least $1, 000 in tips at night.
that's a lot of action for a blind man.
I made you.
you're fired. We're done.
but why kill Huxley? Why not just her?
I'm blind. She's not.
but in that dining room, everybody else is blind, too.
and when Huxley walked in with his kitties, it was like a sign from the gods.
I knew I could destroy her and the restaurant.
I waited till the oyster course.
the shells clanging, and slurping, the "oohing," the "aahing,
I knewt it would cover any noise I was going to make.
I wanted her rotting in jail, eating bologna sandwiches.
if you wanted to frame Pippa, why did you plant the pen in Shasta's purse?
I tell everyone to put their purses and jackets on the back of the chairs, so I knew exactly where her purse was.
old cat frames young kitty.
kind of perfect.
we found high velocity blood spatter inside the rear wheel well of the victim's cart, which means he lost his head at high speed.
so how did hot Rod decapitate Vinnie while racing down a highway at 60 miles an hour?
maybe he didn't.
well, people's heads just don't fly off for no reason.
maybe we should check the scene for some wires or branches, or something he could've run into.
if it would've happened that way, we would've found trace from whatever did it.
the only trace in the neck and arm wounds was rubber from truck tires.
which was present on both sides of his wounds but not on his clothing.
there were blown out tire fragments all over the road.
but we found his body off the road.
there shouldn't be any transfer from truck tires.
unless...
what's going on here?
we're trying to determine whether a steel-belted truck tire can decapitate a kid driving a go-cart.
I thought that was an urban myth.
myths, legends, tall tales-- they all come from something real.
if that go-cart was going 60 miles an hour drafting a truck going the same speed, and that truck blows a tire sending a two-pound projectile into the driver's neck...
the combined speed of impact would be 120 miles an hour.
which is about... 962 foot-pounds of energy.
all right, let's go, fellas.
come on, Conrad. There's always room for Jell-O.
it's expensive Jell-O.
I love this.
well, it worked.
see if we can't reuse some of that.
when did you tell ecklie we got involved?
two years ago.
Why? What did you tell him?
nine years ago.
the forensic academy conference?
Yeah.
you, uh, had too many questions about anthropology for some reason.
well, I was stalling.
I was trying to get the nerve to ask you to dinner.
you had a ponytail.
I'm going to move to swing.
we talked about this.
I know that you said that you would do it, but I don't want to do that to the team.
besides... I am sure that I could use more daylight in my life.
we should go.
Yeah.
you, uh, you want a ride?
wish I could.
what about you, Ricky Bobby?
no, thanks, I like to watch.
okay.
you should go. - Yeah?
Yeah, you should go.
okay.
www. Ydy. Com proudly presents
you were at the strip club on official business earlier in the day, but then you went back on your own time later?
I already told you, yes.
and that's when you met the victim?
I first met Candy in the parking lot the strip club.
later on, I talked to her inside.
approximately how much money did you spend getting to know the victim?
300 bucks, but that was because it was part of an investigation.
and that would be the investigation the Undersheriff told you to drop? - Yes...
you still on the modafinil and the zolpidem?
no, I'm off them.
did you take them yesterday?
so, today is the first day of the rest of your life, hmm?
dispatch said body at a dump.
Yeah, this is definitely not the city dump.
kids were out here drinking beer, found the dead dogs.
patrol unit came, responded and found the female DB.
looks like animal bites on her arms and legs.
no purse or ID on her.
okay, Dave, let's see what we got.
whatever bit her must have been at it for a while.
Yeah, maybe.
but I doubt they tied her up and beat her.
check out the contusions, ligature marks.
disposing of animals like this is illegal.
whoever dumped the vic must have known about the site from dumping dogs.
Yup.
it looks like he's moving up the food chain.
Hey.
Hey, could you do me a favor?
um, bring me one of the swabs?
sure.
what's up?
there's some white trace on the soles of her feet.
you were at the scene.
did you happen to notice any white material that might have transferred?
maybe. I can't say for sure.
I mean, there were dead dogs and trash all over the place.
excuse me.
would you help me remove her dress? - Sure.
let's just roll her.
that look like a needle mark?
I'll send samples to Tox.
so, in the course of developing this informant, you took her to a motel and had sex with her?
that part was personal.
CSI Brown, in your mind, is there any distinction between personal and official?
have you guys bothered to call the motel?
I checked in with a credit card.
I checked out around 5: 00.
I called a cab.
talk to the cab driver.
when I woke up, Candy was gone.
when I got back to the cb to pick up my car, she was dead.
No!
listen to me.
I did not kill her.
but I know damn well who did.
Lou Gedda to see you, Captain.
what's this?
candy's mother's phone number.
her parents have already been notified.
candy wrote it down for me last night just before she died.
that's why she came back to the club after her shift.
her mother was pressuring her to quit.
candy wanted me to call her, give her the talk.
it's exotic dancing, not stripping.
show business.
did you make the call?
I don't get involved in family business, but I thought it might help your investigation.
how's this going to help me?
how should I know?
I'm just trying to be a good citizen.
Hey, Doc. - Hey.
I heard your band killed last night.
Really? Who'd you hear that from?
my wife's second cousin.
works in the mayor's office for the budget and finance director.
he was at the country club.
grooved to your moldy oldies all night.
they're classics.
sorry.
so, uh, people were talking about me?
what did I do?
I know her. Her name's Elizabeth Rodriguez.
she and her husband Felix were honored last night by the Nevada Enterprise Association.
humanitarians of the Year.
they opened that outreach center in the Alphabets.
they were dancing right in front of me.
she and Felix were very philanthropic.
I admired both of them.
did they leave the party together?
no. He left first.
do you remember what time that was?
sometime between "Louie Louie" and "You Really Got Me."
could you be more specific, Doc?
well, it was just before the end of our third set.
we broke at 10: 00.
just before that
and she stayed?
for a little while.
I didn't see her after that.
guess it was around 10: 30.
and the kids called in the dead dogs around 2: 00.
so, that's a three-and-a-half-hour window.
I'll talk to the husband.
I'll keep you posted.
thank you.
can you tell me anything about these bites?
definitely perimortem.
right around time of death.
so, it's unlikely it's coyotes.
no.
are you going to be okay with this one?
I'm just not used to seeing them alive.
you went home without your wife. Why?
I hate dry chicken and small talk.
and more than anything, I hate dancing.
so, I went home, and I passed out on the couch.
next thing I know, you guys are banging on my front door.
Where's Liz?
do you always leave your wife on the dance floor?
Liz is out every night at some charitable function, saving the world.
we have a deal.
if I make an appearance, I get to duck out early.
you know what? I've done my time. I think I'm going home.
all right, well, don't wait up for me.
and I'll miss you.
look, if you don't tell me what's going on, I'll need to talk to my lawyer.
your wife was murdered last night.
Mr. Rodriguez, this is CSI Sanders.
he's here to take your fingerprints and your clothes.
please stand up.
what?
Mr. Rodriguez, stand up.
I want to see my wife.
when we're finished here, we'll talk about it.
stand up, please.
I didn't kill her.
I loved my wife.
driven him home.
I have to trust the people I work with, Jim.
look, Warrick's a loose cannon. We both know that.
he was in Gedda's strip club...
he was off the clock.
conducting his own police investigation.
he's very passionate about this case.
Yeah, passionate enough to sleep with the vic who ended up dead in his car.
look, I know Warrick didn't have anything to do with it, but he needs to back off.
guys like Lou Gedda - - they don't skip on murder and extortion by being lucky.
what does that mean?
you think Gedda's got "friends "inside the department?
well, unlike Warrick, I don't make accusations until I have proof.
Hey, Grissom.
did you talk to IA yet?
Yeah. They cleared me.
they didn't seem to have much interest in Gedda.
that's because it wasn't about Gedda.
it was about you.
it's everything to do with Gedda.
sending me a message.
murders an innocent young girl because I got too close to them.
I want this case, Gris.
I hope you know that's not gonna happen.
you're in the rotation as of tomorrow, so go home.
the white flaky trace on your victim's feet was permethrin, an insect repellent, also used in flea dips.
she was found with a bunch of dead dogs.
what about the husband's tux?
no flea dip, no dog hairs, no blood.
just a little bit of champagne and some underarm deodorant.
you just exonerated our only suspect.
so how crazy was last night?
you. Me. Dinner?
I thought the Syrah was quite nice.
Yes, and thank you for offering to split the check.
my date really appreciated it.
Oh, no problem.
let it be known, that I am nothing if not a gentleman.
why were you at a restaurant like Nob Hillby yourself anyway?
the Golden Rule.
always treat yourself the way you would like others to treat you.
that's not exactly the rule.
what are you working on?
the Elizabeth Rodriguez homicide.
she had bite marks on her with saliva in them, and the saliva turned out to be canine, and anytime a dog is impounded in a criminal case, its DNA is collected and profiled.
it's just like CODIS.
DODIS.
anyway most of the cases in the database are gang-related.
but I figured, well, it's worth a shot.
well, that'll look good on the old Grissom point meter.
it's protocol.
I'm just saying, be careful: no one likes a kiss-ass.
Really?
Hey, Nick, have you seen Catherine?
Yeah, she got another call-out.
we're a little bit shorthanded right now. What's up?
the canine DNA database got a hit on the saliva.
it's a pit bull named Hannibal.
confiscated during a drug raid at a gang house three months ago.
and then held at Del Santos Kennel until he was released to his owner, Gino Aquino.
a member of the D Street Killers.
rodriguez Outreach Center is on D Street.
well, you do good work in that neighborhood, and you're bound to piss off the DSKs.
maybe enough to want her dead.
go see everyone's ID.
fine, do your cop thing and don't tell me nuthin'.
go ahead, look around all you want.
keep an eye on him.
my dog ain't here.
you arrested him with me a couple months ago.
I never got him back.
well, Mr. Aquino
look, you or any of your homies hang out at the Rodriguez Outreach Center?
Yeah, right. A bunch of rich people trying to feel good about themselves.
they should just give us the money.
I thought you said your dog's been gone for a couple months now.
Yeah, check the police report.
then why do you have a bowl of fresh water for him out in the shed?
in case he comes back.
and the leashes?
I'm still in mourning.
what about the treadmill?
you crazy? I bought that for her.
do I need to tap my defender?
tell him to meet you downtown.
so I'm offering a $100, 000 reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of my wife's killer.
I will not rest until the murderer is caught and brought to justice.
I know government employees aren't eligible for reward money, but I think we should at least get a small percentage.
it's called your salary.
what have you got?
possible COD on Elizabeth Rodriguez.
overdose.
phenytoin and pentobarbital.
an anti-epileptic and a sedative hypnotic?
in combination, they're used to euthanize animals.
dog bites, mass dog grave, euthanizing solution.
well, those drugs are controlled substances, so their sales should be registered.
already put together a list of the buyers in the Las Vegas area.
del Santos Kennel.
Yeah, Nicky, where are you?
she was friends with the owner.
she bankrolled the place.
her old man's rich.
we need to see your controlled substances;
any records you have on a confiscated dog named Hannibal;
and I'll have to print everyone who works here.
all right, no problem.
the owner's got the key to the cabinet.
his name's Steve Card. He's just down the hall.
anybody else have access?
uh, no, I have the only key.
are you a licensed veteririan?
vet tech.
Oh, I didn't realize that techs were allowed to perform surgeries.
not on live animals, but once the dog dies I can harvest the organs.
I sell the hearts to research labs doing heartworm studies.
it's a rescue kennel.
most the dogs who come in are problematic, aggressive.
most don't make it out.
Mr. Card, I'm going to have to ask you to step outside so I can take your statement.
what do you think that is?
I don't know.
but the pattern on these restraints is consistent to ligature marks on the victim.
I found a hidden camera pointing right at it.
it's an awful lot of blood.
long red hairs.
I don't think these came from a dog.
wait, what is he being arrested for?
murder.
who got murdered?
Mrs. Rodriguez.
do you have any idea what that contraption's used for in the back storage room there?
um, I'm not allowed back there.
I just pick up the poop and walk the dogs.
it says here you released the dog back to its owner, but Mr. Aquino claims he never got Hannibal back.
that's not true.
I was here when he picked Hannibal up.
how many dogs you got here?
like 47 right now.
I'm gonna need to collect saliva samples from all of them.
most of these guys are pretty jacked up.
Ooh, yeah, looks like he's been in a few fights.
Yeah, most of them have.
you can go ahead. He's not gonna bother you.
must get pretty tough working here, huh?
Yeah, you try to make a difference.
I spent some time in a cage, so I know what it's like.
Yeah, you're a good boy.
you're a good boy.
it's okay, boy. It's okay.
you got any print results from off my car?
should I be talking to you?
Yeah, I've been cleared.
well, no, actually all I got so far are your prints.
wait, I got something.
I know that guy.
his name is Richard Dorsey.
you know, you keep pursuing this, you're going to end up suspended.
dorsey's prints were found inside my car under the broken window.
well, that's consistent with him putting the body in your car.
Grissom, he's a homeless guy.
he lives in the alley behind the strip club.
don't you get it? He's Gedda's fall guy.
this is a frame job.
okay, I'll have Brass check it out.
you stay out of it, though.
we've got the victim's blood and hair at your kennel.
she died of an overdose of the same drugs that were found in a medicine cabinet that only you had access to.
if I were you, I'd save my money and start talking.
are you acting as his lawyer now?
Mr. Card, I found this hidden camera in the exam room.
Where's the receiver?
I don't know anything about this.
did you forget about the camera when you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez?
I didn't kill Lizzie. She was my business partner.
I'm advising you to stop talking.
it's not your ass.
I'm a victim here.
how do you figure?
it was on the morning news that Lizzie was dead.
and when I came into work...
so instead of calling the police, you cleaned up the crime scene.
that makes you an accessory.
he was afraid for his life.
nobody cheats the D Street Killers out of 50 Gs and lives.
you cheated them out of $50, 000?
not me.
Lizzie.
we banked 50 Gs.
I bet Gino's getting sick of losing.
it never fails.
when I fight a dog, I fight to win.
Lizzie was the #1 dog fighter in all of Vegas.
that drove Gino nuts 'cause he was like this close to knocking her off the top spot.
you seriously want us to believe that Mrs. Rodriguez, humanitarian of the year, was into dog fighting?
Oh, she was no Mother Theresa.
but, see, she'd still be alive if she wasn't a dirty dog fighter.
that rub, it made the other dog sick.
gee, I hate to see the sport tainted like that.
why do you think she gave money to my rescue kennel?
she didn't even like dogs, but fighting them, that was in her blood.
passed down from her daddy who taught her the whole family business.
Okay...what is this?
it's a...it's a breeding stand.
the sport has a high mortality rate, and, uh, combative bitches won't breed without a fight.
so we have to tie them down to consummate the act.
the victim was tied to that stand.
that's sick.
my client's willing to give you everything.
what's "everything"?
my client cleaned up the scene, but he didn't dispose of the evidence.
we can also give you Gino Aquino.
LVPD! Police! Freeze!
hands in the air!
I give up! I give up!
on ground, now!
Freeze!
don't even think about it.
let me guess. dog?
Hey, what's going to happen to all these dogs now?
they'll have to be put down.
law says they're dangerous.
and the people who turn them into killers, they just get away with a slap on the wrist, huh?
it's not illegal to train them to fight.
well, it should be.
get away from my house.
sorry.
all these guys know Dorsey.
this is where he lives.
Hey, Mitch.
that's him.
richard Dorsey, time to wake up.
you're under arrest.
meathead.
no weapons.
he's clean.
all right,
pulled this bullet out of Mr. Aquino's shoulder.
it looks like a. 25 caliber.
that's friendly fire.
Thanks, Doc.
my arm ain't never gonna work right again.
I'm gonna sue your asses.
no, no, no, it was a . 25 caliber slug they pulled out of you.
it means it was one of your boys.
it was probably some cop's backup.
Yeah, that's probably it.
Gino.
we have witness who says you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez because she cheated you out of 50 Gs.
let me guess: you been talking to Steve Card.
little screamer.
that finger's pointing the other way.
Lizzie had cojones.
I loved that woman.
I respected her.
you never cross Lizzie, she'll cut 'em off.
but Card, he thought he had that immunity idol 'cause he worked for her.
you cheating little bitch. You been doing this all night?
if I ever catch you cheating again, I will feed your heart to that dog.
that last fight wasn't on the up.
next dog's not right either. You forfeit.
without her, he was nobody.
she was a bad bitch.
that's your motive.
anything else you need help with?
tell me about all the dead dogs I found down the Silverado Wash.
were you the one that tortured them?
made them fight?
when they died, were you the one that threw them out with the trash?
was that you?
I thought this was about Lizzi
one way or another, Gi, you're not going to see the streets for quite a while.
you know, there are two things a jury can't stand:
people who abuse kids and people who abuse animals.
classic he said/ he said.
steve Card was the only one with access to the drugs and he admitted to cleaning up the crime scene.
there's no forced entry at the kennel.
he has no alibi.
and why would he give us all of Elizabeth's personal effects?
you know, I'm starting to get the feeling guy's not really all that smart.
he has a good lawyer.
realized that we were onto his client and wanted to throw us off the scent.
well, maybe Gino's telling the truth.
problem is, we don't have enough evidence to convict either one of them.
one pair of woman's shoes, size 7, silver.
swabbed a blood sample from the instep of the right shoe, sent it to DNA.
one woman's handbag, also silver.
contents include one tube of Superla Red lipstick #36...
one mirrored compact...
one set of keys holdings.
four - - no, five keys - - one Mercedes key, one Schlage brass key.
steve Card was lying when he said he was the only one with the key to the drug cabinet.
Elizabeth had one, too.
means the killer could have used her key.
got a print.
Hey.
we, uh, we can't really talk to him yet.
he's still waiting for his lawyer.
he's waiting for me. - Hmm?
he's confidential informant.
the DA's investigating Steve Card, Gino Aquino, Elizabeth Rodriguez, everybody associated with the dogfighting ring.
so you knew about this?
knowing about it and proving it are two different things.
okay.
okay, so what's this guy's story?
same old - - he...
used to ride with the D-Streeters, shot his old man when he was 15, did four years in juvie, got out, tried to turn his life around.
we busted him 18 months ago for possession and assault.
he cut a deal.
so he's got a history of violence.
you think he killed Mrs. Rodriguez?
it took me over a year to get him inside that dogfighting ring.
I'm reserving judgment.
I did the best that I could.
I'm sure you did, Tommy.
and I told you what they were doing to those dogs and I gave you all the tapes.
it wasn't enough.
we needed to see the dogs fighting; that's the felony.
but they had the fights in different places.
I mean, she never told me where they were, s-so...
Tommy, did you kill Elizabeth Rodriguez?
I, I could understand if you did.
a whole lot of people that would say she had it coming.
you know, I've been on the streets...in juvie.
I've seen people do some bad things to each other, but those dogs, like...
you can beat their brains in and, like, a minute later they come up to you just wagging their tails.
I know, man. That's how they are.
I always had dogs growing up.
did you?
no, I never had a pet. My mom was allergic.
no, but you really cared about those dogs at the kennel.
now, I know.
I saw the way you treated them.
do you know how they train them?
they'd run them till they dropped.
they'd strengthen their jaws.
then, they would feed them little dogs, sometimes cats...
just to give them the taste of blood.
and I showed you what she did and you did nothing to stop her.
no. No, but you did.
didn't you?
she was fighting dogs. All right, she was...
she was killing dogs in the ring for money week after week.
and the city decides to give her an award?
I gave her what she really deserved.
at least I had the decency to euthanize her before I threw her to the dogs.
well, you don't look like a guy who just got a confession.
Oh... something's still bugging me.
if Mr. Rodriguez hadn't left the party, Elizabeth might still be alive.
you think he would have gone to the kennel with her?
I don't know, but he received a phone call from somebody that night that made him leave his wife.
check the phone records.
Mr. Rodriguez.
detective Vega, Mr. Stokes.
did you catch the man who killed my wife?
Yes, sir.
we have him in custody now.
Hey, witnesses at the party said that you received a phone call the night of the murder and then you just left.
we know that phone call was from Tommy Halpert.
What'd you two talk about?
Tommy said if I didn't speak to my wife that night, he would.
speak to your wife about what?
the dogfighting.
he showed me the tapes.
what did Elizabeth say when you confronted her?
I didn't.
so you just left her there, knowing that Tommy was going to come after her?
violence begets violence.
is that all?
you let this happen.
you did.
Hey, you still with me, Richard?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
remember her?
she worked at Pigalle.
they all look the same to me.
no, they don't. There's blondes, brunettes, B-cups, D-cups.
how about a cup of coffee, huh?
Hey, you got a cigarette I could bum off you?
it's bad for your health. How about a diet soda?
diet? No. No diet.
I need the ups.
where did you get this?
Where's the soda?
Hey, it's a two-way street, Richard.
you answer the questions, we'll get you a soda.
Yeah. Uh...I found it.
that's it. I found it.
no, you didn't.
I didn't?
damn.
okay. Uh, yeah, I stole it.
that's right. I stole it.
give me my purse! Give me my purse!
help!
somebody!
I needed money.
then what happened?
I got high.
then what? - I got high again.
then what? Did you kill her?
we found her purse and the bloody murder weapon in the place where you were sleeping.
we found her dead body inside this car.
why'd you pick that car, Richard?
I don't know what you mean.
we found your fingerprint inside the car.
no, that wasn't me.
Tha-tha-that w...that was them.
who's them?
I c... I can't talk no more.
come on. Tell the truth. - Get him out of here.
not you. - Tell the truth.
this is all your fault.
we'll take care of you. We'll get you into rehab. Come on.
there is no truth! - Tell the truth!
there is no truth!
Hey!
as of right now, you're suspended for two weeks.
Grissom, you and I both know that Gedda killed that girl and pinned it on that bum.
they gave him drugs, got him high, and planted the evidence.
you just got to give me a chance to prove it.
you've had all your chances.
you take the suspension or you're fired.
Hey. I got an update for you.
he got suspended.
good work.
Lou Gedda is getting away with murders.
Warrick is a loose cannon, He was in Gedda's strip club, - conducting his own police investigation. - What do you want?
everything.
No!
I did not kill her.
Grissom, you and I both know that Gedda killed that girl.
you take this suspention, or you are fired.
guys like Lou Gedda, they don't skip on murder or extortion by being lucky.
I got an update for you. - Good work.
crime scene at the funeral.
can't get much deader than this.
liver temp certainly couldn't.
he is being dead more the 24 hours
any indication what he died from?
no, not a sign of trauma.
I spoke with Mrs. Bell, she has no idea who the other DB from the casket is.
okay, thanks.
that has got to be the biggest casket I've ever seen.
this is the Alvis model.
we are a fat country, Nick. Here is our proof.
you don't think they come out the factory room for two though.
no, the extra compartment is custom addition.
this board is what seperated the two bodies.
top guy was just too heavy.
maybe it's the scandle to save money.
mortuary is obligated to bury indigents of no charge.
maybe save a burial plot by burying John Doe with John Smith.
go ahead, man, put him in a van, how dare you.
stay here. - Guys, I'm just a coroner assistant.
caught you , you are not going nowhere, man.
hold down, hold down now fellas, he is just doing his job.
Mr. Bell is our first priority.
we are gonna have him back here as soon as we can.
OK, you guys go help with the funeral band too?
Yeah, buy another casket?
cause that was donated by the community.
we'll pay for a new casket. - We will?
Oh, man, this is disgrace right now, man.
Hey, whoever put that other body in the casket is the one you should be angry with.
not us. Let us do our job.
we'll put him in jail.
this isn't right, man.
just go ahead and don't move yourself in.
stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
please, just...let my husband through. Please.
you are the mortician
you are the one putting bodies into coffins
so what, you have a two-for-one sale?
who is the extra stiff?
you don't want to say anything, that's fine
I'll just shut down the mortuary
maybe I'll book you on suspicion of murder
for all I know, you killed the guy before you stuffed him in the coffin
lawyer
you're under arrest
got to admit it's a pretty clever way to dispose of a body
who is gonna look under somebody else's tombstone
well, it's not exactly a new technique
in the 1920's, Joe Bonanno used to dispose his hits in a double decker coffin
what is this? More research for your mob book?
I hope you are not starting to admire those slugs
I don't admire them. But I'm grateful
for what?
well, my book is done
I have meetings with three different publishers in LA
and I fly out the day after tomorrow
I heard you were in here - Need any help? - Not really
I've already collected trace off the body. I'm almost done with the coffin here
chaparral High football coach, ah?
Hey, by the way, how much do I owe you
I don't know, Warrick, don't worry about it.
I always pay my debts. This should cover.
what exactly about the Chaparral High state champs reminded you to pay me.
football always reminds me money.
this is not football season.
it's baseball but I don't bet baseball.
pure paycheck, babe.
hey Doc, you figure out what killed this guy yet?
Yeah, found some petechiae consistent with suffocation
Yeah, this should do it.
you okay?
Yeah, I know this guy.
or I knew him. He was a PI.
you just saved yourself some work.
his prints will be in the system.
Thanks.
we were in patrol together twenty some-odd years ago.
class cop.
you sure we are talking about the same guy?
I mean this guy got a list of complaints going up for right.
until about the day he retired, at age 33.
Vegas was a different town back then.
you ruffled feathers, you got the boot.
I...But soliciting prostitutes, extorting businese man and insurnce fraud.
kind of looks like he deserves to get the boot.
Lenny always said the complaints were trumped up.
this file, doesn't change the way we treat this case.
Lenny was a cop. Cops are a priority.
I want every man you got on this.
either this guy is a neat freak, or he's got one hell of a cleaning lady.
left his computer, that helps.
Hey, Nick, is there a trash can under that desk?
Yeah.
is there a liner in it? - Yeah, why?
there is no liner in this one.
and the paper shredder has been emptied.
looks like somebody cleaned up after they cleaned up.
this care is as clean as a whistle.
the floor mat's still damp.
I think it has just been detailed.
what if the killer used the victim's car to transport the body?
he drives the victim's own vehicle back to the funeral home.
stuffs the body and double deckered coffin, hits a car wash comes back, cleans out the office, and leaves us the keys.
it's pretty considerate.
or very smart.
how did you get this number?
is this some kind of a joke?
what the hell do you want?
should I bring my own shovel?
get anything off that computer?
no, hard drive's been wiped clean.
what about the shredder?
nothing but a couple of strips from a folder and a few receipts.
but I got a court order on Mr. Harper's email accounts.
he had quite a few.
one that handled mostly family stuff. One that handled new customers.
and a work account.
the work account have online backup systom.
that's what I'm in now.
so you basically got everything that was on his computer?
I even have stuff he erased.
there's a file in here you might think is interesting.
P. I.'s like to use a lot of audio and visual surveillance.
insurance policy.
this one was even taping his own meetings.
Really?
all right, so it's March 17, 2008. Meeting with Client #333.
this is from inside his Escalade, yesterday.
she did it with a cop. I spit on her, she deserve what she got.
this's as close to a confession as you ever gonna get.
I'm gonna bury that guy Lenny, I'm gonna bury you.
Warrick couldn't investigate Gedda himself so he had the PI to do it for him.
Archie tracked down thousands of photos, sound byte files, videos.
everything is connected to Lou Gedda.
I thing Gedda caught Harper to spying on him, killed him, and had the mortician put the body in the double-decker casket.
this is Waccick Brown. Leave your name and number
Warrick, call me, now.
anybody hears from him, I want to know.
you got it.
where the hell have you been?
Grissom, I got to talk to you.
where are you. - Pigalle.
what are you thinking.
I don't know. I don't know.
you don't...you don't know what?
I don't know what I did here. I don't know what happened, - I just woke up... - Police!
drop the gun! Drop the gun!
warrick? - On the ground! Now!
I'm a CSI!
drop the gun!
Grissom, I...I don't know what happened.
local merchant heard gun shots, called 911.
I responded code 3 with back up.
there was no one else in the buliding.
Thanks. Listen, could you give us just a minute?
what happened?
I don't know. My head is throbbing.
is that your gun? - Yeah.
are those your cuffs?
I guess so.
we need to get you a lawyer.
Grissom. - Don't say another word.
Jim... - Just get on your feet.
listen to me. I don't know what happened.
it's for your own good.
keep your mouth shot 'till we get to the station.
you couldn't just let it go.
the 419 went out as as officer involved no details.
we got here as quick as we could.
what the hell happened?
Gedda is dead.
put your kits away. Day shift will be processing the scene.
ia is taking the case from now on.
turn around.
hands up, I'll check for GSR.
get a lawyer. - I don't want one.
this isn't going away, Warrick.
48 hours they're gonna charge you.
I wouldn't know what to tell a lawyer anyway.
I'm have to take your cloth.
sign here.
OK, thank you very much.
were you just talking to IA? - Yes.
What'd you tell'em?
I'm not supposed to talk about it, I signed an admonishment.
I don't care. What did you say?
I said that i saw Warrick sitting in Grissom's office in the dark.
so what?
so he got a phone call, and he got rude pissed at the person he was talking to.
so what?
then he was found a hour later in a pool of Gedda's blood.
you don't know what happened in there.
look, Nick, All I did was tell the truth as I saw it.
it's what we are supposed to do, right?
I don't remember what happened.
is that what you are going going with? Really?
that's what the truth is.
OK, for the record then.
are you claiming memory lost from possible concussion or the hysterical amnesia following a traumatic incident.
like I told you, I just don't remember what happened.
you remember hiring Lenny Harper to investigate Lou Gedda?
in violation of direct orders? - Yeah.
you think Gedda was responsable?
I'd bet on it.
I've heard that about you.
is that why you went to Pigalle?
I went to Pigalle because Gedda called me.
your coworkers corroborate a call, so we pulled your cell records.
came from a disposable phone which meas it could come from anybody.
no, it came from Lou Gedda.
I suppose that's possible.
we do seem be jogging your memory. Let's keep that ball rolling, what happened next?
I went down there. - Alone?
Yes.
unarmed?
no.
Gedda, you called me.
next thing I remember...
I don't remember anything that happened out there.
uh...you left out the best part.
I guess that's the ...amnesia.
you want me to fill inthe blank?
your gun...
with blood, tissue and hair at the scene.
your handcuffs on the vic.
you... covered in blood.
you went to pigalle to get revenge by giving lou gedda a taste of his own medicine.
you're a csi.
what's the evidence telling you?
the evidence is...
the evidence is suggesting that I did it.
okay.
you think this is some kind of a joke, eh?
you think this is a joke, right? - You're making a mistake.
I don't know what happened. - You're digging a hole.
you understand what I'm saying?
I don't know what happened! - Let go of my jack.
okay, the rods are in place according to the autopsy report.
Gil, we're processing warrick's case evidence.
you shouldn't even be in here.
I'd like to see the files.
well, they're not done yet. We're still finalizing our conclusions.
Yeah, but if I could see the raw test data, I could draw my own conclusions.
I'll get you copies of the reports.
you'll have them in a couple of hours. - Thanks.
excuse me, detective.
may I have a few minutes with csi brown?
Why?
I'm a friend.
well, he sure needs one of those.
be my guest. - Thank you.
how you holding up?
that depends.
do you think I did it?
I can't discuss the case.
Yeah.
I don't know, I think I'd just feel a lot better if I had a change of clothes.
I hate being dressed like a convict.
I'll take care of it.
stay strong.
we're not through yet.
okay, um... let's... let's back up a little bit.
you get involved with a pretty young thing.
you go away to do your business. She winds up dead.
you ever think about that?
I think about joanna every day.
there's not a day that goes by I don't think about her.
no, I'm sorry.
I was talking about holly gribbs.
you remember holly, don't you?
rookie csi you left alone at a crime scene eight years ago to go place bets for a crooked judge.
suspect came back and shot her.
I remember.
poor innocent girl just trying to do her job.
she winds up dead because of you.
that has nothing to do with this.
do two points make a straight line? It's a pattern of behavior.
reckless, obsessive, compulsive, self-destructive behavior.
twenty Four Year Old Pigalle Blvd. Stripper Found Slain in Parking Lot.
what are you doing here?
I just stopped by to get warrick a change of clothes.
all right, take something out of the drawers-- nothing laid out or in the laundry.
detective: You get holly killed, then you get joanna killed.
you just can't take any more, so you kill gedda.
that's how a jury's going to see it.
there's nothing I can do about that.
sure there is.
look, lou gedda was a slime ball.
that's common knowledge.
nobody's going to miss him.
in fact, the world is arguably a better place without him.
and so if I just admit to killing him, they'll take it easy on me, and you're just trying to help me out, right?
you know how many times I used that on a suspect?
don't waste your game, pal.
okay. You're a betting man.
given the circumstances, what do you think your odds are right now?
I want a lawyer.
there were numerous high-velocity blood stains on the front of csi warrick brown's shirt.
seven of these stains were typed using 13 str loci.
all samples match blood collected from lou gedda at autopsy...
the five expended cartridge cases recovered at pigalle boulevard were all fired in warrick brown's service pistol...
the bullets recovered at autopsy and from the barber's chair were fired from the same firearm, as well...
robbins: Based on the clotting of the facial lacerations and development of the bruises on the victim's arms and wrists...
it appears he was bound and beaten at least an hour prior to death...
okay, if this were any other suspect, what would be our conclusion?
that he did it.
which is what warrick told internal affairs.
he confessed?
no, but he didn't deny it.
he says he can't remember.
we've all heard that one before.
what's that supposed to mean?
it's not supposed to mean anything. We're just talking.
we can't just sit her and watch him go down.
Willows: We're not going to.
he's asked for an attorney.
we'll get him a shark.
the only thing the jury's going to see is a rogue cop with a vendetta.
I've been there before.
they're going to crucify him.
Hey, guys, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you need to see this.
there was chloroform in lougedda's blood and tissue.
chloroform gets metabolized in the body pretty quickly, and it's excreted by breathing.
Gedda must have been killed soon after he was dosed.
Warrick went in there with a gun.
why would he use chloroform if he was going to shoot him?
maybe to subdue him into the barber's chair.
so he intended to torture him?
no, not warrick. No way.
you know, chloroform exposure can result in short term amnesia.
Warrick says he can't remember anything after going into gedda's office.
Where's the tox on warrick?
his blood wasn't drawn.
why not?
the arrest report didn't note any intoxication at the scene.
I guess nobody saw any reason to do it.
well, now there's a reason.
here, put this on. - Okay.
Henry did a comprehensive drug test for chloroform, along with a head space run for volatiles and solvents.
everything cameback negative.
half-life of chloroformin a human being is about 1. 5 hours.
it's virtually undetectablein seven to ten hours.
we drew the blood too late.
it's still possiblewarrick was dosed. We just can't prove it.
Nick, come here. Take a look at his shirt.
see the voids in the blood spatter around the armpits.
stokes: Fabric must have been folded when the blood was deposited.
looks like he had something under his arms.
grab hodges from behind--under the armpits.
turn around.
dead weight, hodges. Slump down. Let him hold you up.
okay, nick... raise his right arm. Pretend he's gota gun in his hand.
it's possible.
I mean, if warrick were unconscious or semiconscious, he would have had to have been supported.
well, based on the high-velocity spatter on the shirt, the shooter would have had to be within three feet of gedda when he fired.
take off the shirt.
Thanks.
similar voidin the spatter pattern.
stokes: It's consistent, but not conclusive.
there's probably a dozen different ways to explain those voids.
doesn't rule warrick out as the shooter.
but it gives an alternative explanation of the evidence.
and if we're right... warrick was framed.
I talked to a detective at organized crime.
he's sending over alist of all the people that wanted gedda dead.
it's a long list.
cross-reference it to anyof warrick's convictions who might have itout for him.
maybe somebody's trying to kill two birdswith one stone.
okay, I'm on it.
any unknown contributors from the blood at the scene?
no. They're all coming back to the vic.
Wendy and I are workingas fast as we can.
we're striking out.
there's no new evidence from the scene that points to any additional suspects.
you got something?
handcuffs?
take a look at the ligature marks.
the width of the rails on warrick's cuffs are three millimeters narrower than the ligature marks.
the ligature marks on gedda didn't come from warrick's cuffs.
so somebody switchedthe handcuffs after gedda was dead?
brass always suspected that there was a mole in the department that worked for gedda.
I bet we're looking for a cop.
a P. I. Investigating gedda gets killed...
then gedda gets killed...
maybe this dirty copdid them both.
Yeah, but we can't prove it, 'cause we're not allowedto investigate gedda's murder.
we're still investigatingthe P. I.
if the cases are linked, we solve one, we solve the other.
do your client and this department a favor-- make a deal.
the district attorney said he might consider manslaughter.
I can't do that.
are you telling me you're innocent?
because I. A.Said those words never crossed your lips.
are you charging me?
not yet.
but in about five hours, it's gonna be first-degree murder.
we got the link.
tox confirmed traces of chloroform in the P. I.'s body.
had to have been the same guy who killed gedda.
well, that helps.
okay. We got evidence logs and police files from both scenes, but if a cop left trace at either murder scene, we'd just write it off to normal investigator contamination.
Yeah.
after he killed his victims, he could've even stayed and handled the scene, made sure that he hadn't missed anything.
day shift found prints from three officers at gedda's office.
well, all three were assigned to the scene.
Mandy I. D.'s fingerprints from five officers at the mortuary.
okay, but only four signed the log.
the unexplained print...
belongs to...
officer daniel pritchard.
his fingerprint was found... on the casket.
how does hisfingerprint get on the casket if he wasn'tat the mortuary?
I'm sorry, captain. No one's seen pritchardsince day before yesterday.
open it.
no cuffs.
maybe we don't need them.
mckeen: So it's all on pritchard.
is this gonna hold up in court?
it will.
you know what the defenseis gonna say, right?
who better than a csi to makea murder look like a frame?
he was framed.
and I'll prove it.
listen, grissom, um...
I'm so sorryabout all this. - Warrick.
Yeah.
you were framed.
framed?
by who?
Gedda has a molein the department.
I'm ready to talk.
he's on the way.
Gedda! You called me?
a cop?
we think thathe had him kill lenny harper, probably joanna krumsky, as well.
then why wouldhe kill gedda?
who knows?
old mobsters... crooked cops. It's a long history.
I don't know. I mean... come on, grissom.
Gedda's been killingand barbecuing people for 25 years.
it'd take more than a beat cop to get over on that fat bastard.
there's got to be somebodyhigher up than that.
probably.
but pritchard's all we got for now.
he's in custody? - Not yet.
Hey, everything can't go our way.
the D. A.'S gonna drop the charges.
but there's still the question of administrative violations.
so ecklie and i are recommending to the undersheriff that you be suspended and demoted but not terminated.
I still have a job?
well...the undersheriff says he has to think about it, but he just wantsto make you sweat.
I've sweated enough, man.
I imagine.
thank you.
Thanks. Thank you.
come on. Brass is gonna process you out.
Thanks, Jim
don't ever forget how lucky you are.
let's go.
but at least mine was withlana turner, not aaron spelling.
that's pretty lame, I know.
this just reminds me, what does it take to get them to serve turkey baconin this place?
turkey bacon's not gonna make the food any better here.
Yeah, well, fortunately we don't come here for the food.
no.
well, as far as I'm concerned, there's no place I'd rather be.
anything else?
see you next time? - Thanks.
you still there? This one right here. - Yeah
I'll take this.
well, thank you, warrick.
grissom: Okay. I'm going home.
Yeah, me, too.
get some sleep tonight. - Oh, yeah.
thanks for breakfast. - You got it, man.
- See you at the lab.
if you ever need anybodyto talk to, you know how to get a hold of me, huh?
Yeah. Thanks.
see you then.
well... it's just you and me, serpico.
let's get a beer. - Oh, no.
come on. You'rea free man now.
this free man needsa free shower. I think, uh... you need to, uh...
take a hard look at that redhead.
you know, I might just do that. - Yeah. You need to.
I'm really glad you're okay.
thanks - I'll call you later. - All right.
I wanted to join you for dinner.
I'm sorry we missed you. - Yeah, well.
I just wanted to congratulate you in person.
you sure made a believer out of me. - Thanks.
look, uh...
I don't want to fire you.
I just need to know that you'rethrough running the streets on your ownlooking for bad guys.
look ...
I'm done being a roguein the streets, you know?
but there'S... there's one son of a bitch still out there.
and I promise you, we're gonna get him.
well... grissom taught you well.
I like to think so.
you never give up. - No.
that's what makes youa great csi.
he's got my purse!
call the cops, call 911.
my phone was in the purse.
ma'am, excuse me, I need to use your phone.
lady...
lady?
I got here as fast as I could.
my DFO in Anthem took longer to clear than I expected, but that's what happens when you don't have enough bodies to cover the bodies.
she forget to fall down?
lividity's fixed in her ankles and feet.
suggests she died in this position.
I don't know if you saw the weather report last night, but there was dry lighting in this area.
a low voltage strike...
could have caused her arm muscles to contract around the pole.
and then what?
cadaveric spasms in her shoulder and hand keeps the body in position until rigor sets in?
it's just a theory.
I'll tell Robbins to look for signs of electrocution.
Hi, guys. The callout was a 419. Where's the body?
ask her.
excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am?
Nick can't help us.
he just got a call out at the Monte Carlo.
in other words, we're pulling another double.
why should today be any different?
there's no burn marks on the arm or hand where she was touching the pole.
well, there's no scoring or blackening on the dome, either.
no indication of a lightning strike.
the bulb's burned out. Maybe there's a short in the wiring.
liver temp's 98, but ambient's pushing a hundred.
so the body could have warmed up after death? No T.O.D.
sorry.
Rigor's starting to break.
I'll take her prints.
her phone looks new.
hasn't even been personalized yet.
who was she talking to?
moviefone.
she carrying I. D?
she's not carrying anything.
well, if someone was going to rob her, why not take the whole purse?
why waste time emptying the contents?
so, lucky us-- the lamppost lady's fingerprints are in the system.
she has a record?
it's not that system. It's the health care providers database.
name's Carla Peretti. She's an LPN at Desert Palm.
captain Brass is running background. - Good.
where is everyone? - They're in the break room waiting.
waiting for what? - For you.
I know you got the memo; I put it on your desk.
my name's Patricia Alwick.
I'm a peer counselor for the Police Employees Assistance Program.
I deal primarily with law enforcement, which means I know that none of you wants to listen to me, so I'll keep it short.
with the death of Warrick Brown, you've lost a colleague and a friend.
I'm here to help you through it.
our conversations will be informal and confidential.
are the sessions mandatory?
no. No, they're not, but keep this in mind.
right now, you might feel okay and that you can handle things fine on your own, but sometimes, if you're not looking, grief can sneak up and bite you.
I've been doing this a long time. I know what I'm talking about.
ms. Alwick will be up in room 4-E.
if you'd like to make an appointment, call her at extension 2922.
all right, guys, we're done. Thanks for coming.
what, no gun? - Sorry.
well, maybe later, then.
Thanks.
hello.
would you like to make an appointment?
no. I'm new here. Hence the new guy manuals.
excuse me.
you know, joing an established team, particularly under these circumstances
it's not going to be easy for you.
do you think I should quit?
it may not be easy on your colleagues, either.
well, there's nothing I can do about that.
of course there is. I'm happy to discuss...
look, I'm-- this is day one.
I don't know these people, they don't know me.
you seem a bit defensive.
don't do that, okay? - Do what?
you seem a bit defensive.
both my parents are shrinks. I don't do the talk.
both your parents are psychiatrists.
interesting. - Interesting.
are you Riley Adams?
Yeah, that's me.
I'm Gil Grissom, your supervisor. We're very busy.
would you come with me, please? - Yeah.
good luck.
another transit patron called it in.
he was pissed the guy was taking up the whole bench, so he tried to shove him over, which didn't work too well, him being dead at the time.
Hey, everybody.
Oh, hi, I'm David. - Riley.
he's all yours.
no wallet.
no cash or keys either.
body's in full rigor. - Roll him.
I saw that...
and I'm not ever going to forget it.
what does lividity tell you?
that he was lying here when he died.
how do you know that?
cause I'm a CSI level two.
and this is part of your proficiency evaluation.
Yeah, but it's pass-fail.
lividity's fixed along the posterior aspect.
pressure marks are consistent with the bench slats.
do we know how long he's been here?
bus driver's certain the guy wasn't here an hour and a half ago when he made his previous stop.
you see any problem with that?
Yeah, full rigor takes 12 to 24 hours to set.
and if he's been here less than 90 minutes, how does he end up in full rigor?
well, he looks like he was on a run.
maybe he had a heart attack and went into spontaneous rigor.
intense physical activity rapidly depletes muscle fibers of ATP, which gives them the energy they need to contract.
if there's not enough ATP at the time of death, the muscles can lock up and immediately go into rigor.
what's bugging you?
this is the second case of rapid-onset rigor mortis we've had in the last 24 hours.
that's pretty weird.
even for Vegas.
brass checked Carla Peretti's apartment.
no forced entry or any signs of disturbance.
she was last seen alive leaving Desert Palm Hospital at the end of her shift.
anybody know where she was going?
well, apparently, it could have been a lot of places. She was working a bunch of jobs on the side
model, club dancer, convention booth babe.
you know, typical Vegas pretty girl stuff.
autopsy report. Cause of death: cardiac arrest.
that's coroner speak for "I can't explain what killed her."
Yeah.
no signs of conductivity burns, no evidence of nuclear streaming in the tissue.
there's no indications of electrocution whatsoever.
there's other ways for the muscles to seize up.
you know, maybe she was epileptic.
mm, sorry, no epilepsy drugs in her system.
people go off their meds all the time. That's how they get seizures.
uh, she had no medical history of epilepsy.
but the disease doesn't leave any physical record in the body.
the tox panel ruled out poisons and O. D.'s.
she had a small amount of zolpidem in her system, but that stuff's in most over-the-counter sleep aids these days.
it's nothing that would kill her.
no organ damage. No disease,no trauma.
this was a perfectly healthy young woman.
Yeah, till she dropped dead... without dropping.
well, I always thought it was cool that teeth fluoresced, but veneers didn't.
how'd you get them?
somebody bet me that I couldn't jump into a lake with a rope swing in my mouth.
and that pulled the teeth out? - No.
but it sure did hurt my neck.
on the way home, I hit a fire hydrant.
and you bumped the steering wheel with your mouth.
no, I was on my bike at the time.
I flew over the hydrant and smashed into the crossbar of a chain link fence.
with your mouth. - My shoulder.
broke my clavicle.
okay, then how'd you lose the teeth?
this one was a root canal.
and this one-- I, uh... I was in college.
I woke up one morning, and it was gone. I don't know what happened to it.
pardon the latex.
okay. What do we got?
uh, somebody who liked to party.
prelim tox showed traces of meth, E and heroin in his system.
doesn't sound like someone who would go for a run at midnight.
I doubt this guy could've run a hundred feet without stopping to rest.
he had pulmonary edema.
fluid's backed up in the lungs. Sometimes suggests drug abuse.
is that C. O. D. ?
I doubt it. The edema wasn't acute.
far as I can tell, C. O. D. is cardiac arrest.
same as the lady in the park.
Yeah, which brings us to something interesting.
the victim's liver.
note the slight reddish and pinkish coloration.
very similar to Carla Peretti.
assuming the cases are connected, the condition of the victims' livers might suggest an alternate C. O. D.
gaseous asphyxiation.
I'll have Hodges do a blood gas assay.
we walked the photo of the jogger around the local methadone clinic and got lucky.
name's Harley Soon. He has a sheet.
drug abuse, solicitation, some other petty stuff.
juvie record, too, but that's sealed.
thank you, Detective. - No problem.
you doing a headspace assay?
Yes, which is, I believe, your job.
where have you been?
I was just, uh... nowhere.
you want me to finish up?
I'm almost done.
hold on a second. - What?
you added the liberating agent.
Yes.
you added the sulfuric.
you skipped over the sodium dithionite?
Yes, I think I did.
I think I must have done it with all of these.
it's probably better to redo the whole assay.
um, listen, I can get it.
should have been doing it to begin with.
don't worry about it. I know it's been a long day.
every day's a long day.
I have to go. Thank you.
5: 30 a. m. I don't pick up "those people," if you know what I'm saying.
I don't care how nicely-dressed they are.
that's illegal.
Yeah, which is why I stopped and told him to hop in, but he just stood there like that, stock still.
creeped me out, I don't mind telling you.
you're gonna love this.
I've heard of dying with your boots on, but, uh, this is ridiculous.
businessman with an empty briefcase.
no wallet or I. D. Consistent with the other vics.
we got a serial killer, Greg, and he's working at a pace of one body per day.
great. Something to look forward to tomorrow.
Damn! This thing is heavy.
he's got lead in the sole of his shoe.
must be what was keeping him on his feet.
there's a coating of dust on here.
his fingernails have been recently trimmed, but they're filthy at the beds.
and he's got dirt in his ears.
his feet and ankles are all scabbed and crusty and his toenails are growing back into his toes.
this guy's been cleaned up, but I'll bet you he lived on the street.
Yep. Head lice. They're all dead.
good. I hate those little bastards.
so we've got three victims, all stripped of their identities.
a homeless guy dressed like a businessman, a hustler druggie dressed like a runner, and a nurse...dressed like herself.
what do they have in common?
tox found traces of zolpidem in all three.
other than that, we're comparing all the trace evidence from the victims' clothing and personal effects, but so far, nothing probative.
PD is circulating photos of the businessman around shelters and soup kitchens in the area, but there's no I. D. yet.
this girl's an LPN.
maybe her hospital's the connection.
according to Harley Soon's medical records, he was never treated at Desert Palm.
well, Carla Peretti is the one victim who had a mainstream life.
that means e-mails, phone calls, documents.
if there's anything that connects these people, the way to find it is through her.
looks like she was an art student.
the naughty drawer. - What?
nurses always get the good stuff.
take it, you're aware of the lab's random drug testing policy?
Oh, yeah. I've got a bottle of clean urine in my locker, just in case.
I'm kidding.
good one.
here, I'll bag it.
check this out.
an original of Carla.
bizarre. She looks kind of... - Dead?
Yeah, a little.
what's that say? J... Skaggs?
never heard of him.
me, neither.
I bet somebody has.
what do you know.
he's a local.
who are you? - Homicide.
this might look good in my living room.
you can't afford it.
your arm down, and wake up. Wake up!
what do you want?
do you know Carla Peretti? - Who?
Oh, yeah... yeah, she was one of my models. She's a lovely girl.
it's a cheap imitation of my work.
well, you'll have to take it up with the coroner, because she's dead for real.
I'm sorry to hear that. - You paint these guys?
no. Never saw those guys before in my life.
you know, Harley Soon used to crash at a buddy's apartment in the neighborhood.
relax.
and he seems to be kind of your type.
so maybe you, uh...
maybe you bumped into him at the grocery store or something.
I don't go out. I don't shop. I don't bump.
but you do paint dead people.
I paint people who look dead, and you would weep if you knew how much I make doing that.
if you haven't noticed, our culture seems to be obsessed with sex and death.
I've noticed.
let me save you some time, cause I know what's on your mind.
I don't kill my models. I don't even bang them much anymore.
occasionally, of course, but...
Oh, I find not with the same gusto and verve as in days gone by.
you bang Carla Peretti?
I'm not doing women.
mind if I look around?
I'd like to paint you nude.
I don't do nude.
where would I pin the badge? - Exactly.
ms. Alwick.
Dr. Grissom.
were you looking for me?
no, just getting some more tea.
I was hoping we might get a chance to chat.
I'm right in the middle of a case.
I know, I understand that you're dealing with a lot, but, um, if you do find the time...
thank you, I appreciate that.
this, uh, may be outside your field of expertise, but...
lately, I've been having some problems with Hank.
Oh, hi, Patricia.
nice to see you again, David.
the headspace assay came back and showed levels of carbon monoxide in all the vics, as well as the dead lice on the businessman's head.
excuse me.
mostly simple hydrocarbons and sulfur dioxide, along with the carbon monoxide.
that's consistent with gasoline engine exhaust.
Yeah, and since the lice on the homeless guy died, it suggests that he was completely surrounded by exhaust fumes, not suffocated with a mask or a tube.
or locked in a sealed car, for that matter there wouldn't have been enough room to pose them.
lividity says the victims died in the positions in which they were discovered.
so, what does that mean, that the killer is using some sort of gas chamber?
I think so.
he lures someone back to his place, slips them a sedative, then redresses and positions the bodies inside a sealed container.
waits for the carbon monoxide to go to work.
once the bodies are in full rigor, he's got about ten hours to place them and have them discovered.
we know the recipe, let's find the cook.
I believe I just sighted Aeronautes saxatalis.
Aeronautes saxatalis, the white-throated swift.
they hardly ever range this far south this time of year.
the elderly couple was suffering from Alzheimer's.
they were on a little field trip from their assisted care facility day before yesterday.
staff didn't even realize they were missing till bed check.
what, no surveillance cameras on the bird-watching path?
no, but the unis did turn up a crackhead who said he saw an average-height white male in a white panel van near the trail, about an hour before dawn.
caught in their quotidian routines, these haunting figures, frozen in time, seem to mock the mundane blandness that screams silently beneath the sizzle of Sin City.
what is this?
local art blog.
our psycho is the hot topic.
they call him the "Mannekiller."
perhaps, finally, by using the flesh of human beings to replicate the flesh of human beings...
this madman who moves silently among us has crossed art's final frontier.
this is Langston Weller, signing off from mindscanvas. com.
this site's been getting hammered.
check out the comments.
you're a one-man argument against free speech.
this is murder, pure and simple, and you're a moron.
Hitler was right-- kill the artists first.
at least nobody's buying this crap.
vibrant images "of life culled from the raw stuff of death."
these are works of art.
apparently, there are some who share this aesthetic.
the dust found inside the businessman's shoes was actually undyed jute fibers.
the same fibers were also found on tape lifts from the other vic's clothes.
killer's probably covering his vics in woven jute,
i.e. burlap-- at some point during the process.
Thanks, Greg.
you bet.
Dr. Grissom, may I have a word with you?
Yes, of course.
come in.
I wonder why it is that you hold what I do in such obvious contempt.
excuse me?
the last time we spoke, you mentioned that you were having problems with Hank.
now, out of concern for you and because I take my job very seriously, I started asking around
and was met by a mixture of bafflement and smirks by most of your staff, until David Hodges took pity on me and informed me that Hank was your dog.
I apologize.
it was a serious question.
Oh, really?
for the last few weeks, my dog's been listless.
barely eats.
and I just, uh, wondered if you thought it was possible that pets could take on the emotions of their owners.
well...
companion animals were bred to respond to human beings.
at some level, I do believe that they resonate with what their owners are feeling.
so, what are you feeling?
I've just been...
a little distracted lately.
uh, having a hard time focusing on the details.
that's normal.
not for me.
I wondered, uh, if you knew, typically, how long this lasts.
there's no typical.
days, weeks, sometimes years.
the important thing is to acknowledge it.
but you do have to talk about it.
and if not with me, then with somebody else.
and soon.
Jim, got something?
Yeah, Harley Soon's juvie record.
I got the court administrator to unseal it.
he was arrested five years ago in a drug raid on a party at the art studio of Jerzy Skaggs.
so, how do you like my studio?
this is ridiculous.
no, what's ridiculous is you denying that you knew Harley Soon.
party was five years ago.
the kid was 16 at the time.
you should have been busted for that, too.
listen to me-- everybody who was anybody came to my parties.
and many like yourself, who are nobody at all.
you know, I just...I can't remember everybody who came to my parties.
all right, so you reconnected with Harley Soon...
and you're connected with Carla Peretti.
a lot of people you know are turning up dead.
you're telling me these are actual dead people?
come on, it's been all over the news.
I don't...I don't watch TV.
and I only use the Internet to make money.
man, that is wild.
death just mocking life.
are you done?
you know, these look familiar.
Yeah, I bet they do.
no, no, no, no, not the...not the people, the poses.
Somebody...somebody showed me drawings like these, months ago.
these people remind me of those wretched sketches.
excuse me, Mr. Skaggs.
if I could have a moment, would you mind taking a quick look at these?
I can't stand looking at inferior art.
it just...
it sears into my consciousness like bad Mexican food.
who was he?
no, I don't remember, but he was, you know, babbling about some insipid municipal sculpture competition he was hoping to win.
Open...to the public.
Oh, okay, so he was an artist.
no, he was some kind of contractor, subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, sub-sub-subcontractor.
I think my...my studio was, uh, being renovated, and it was...you know, it was a big job.
there was lots of...lots of manual...labor involved.
I need a name.
he was a laborer-- why would I know his name?
because you hired him.
I didn't hire him.
one of those contractors hired him.
and no, I don't remember his name.
I...I barely remember your name.
what is your name?
eight months ago, the city sponsored a competition to create a series of bronze lifelike statues for its parks and public spaces.
Las Vegas: for the rest of your life."
Yeah, and all the applications were submitted digitally.
this is what the Parks Department sent over.
Hey, take a look at this one.
it's a submission from an Arthur Blisterman.
look at this.
jackpot, huh?
the rules stated that...
the sculpture should recreate the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity that make the city so vibrant and alive.
this guy was following them to the letter.
Yeah, except that he was substituting bronze with human flesh.
guys, there's a, uh, sculpture number six here.
we only found five bodies.
Oh, God.
he's not done.
so we got Blisterman's house staked out.
the neighbors haven't seen him for weeks.
now, the guy's unmarried, got no criminal record.
he's an independent plumbing contractor, so he makes his own schedule, and he's not answering his phone.
no, he has a white panel van.
we got a broadcast out.
he's got to have some kind of work space or studio, somewhere he can come and go unnoticed.
look, there's nothing on record.
we've released a picture, we've notified the schools and Child Services to be on alert.
right now, that's all we can do.
why do you think people make art?
self-expression.
Yeah, but I think also to...
provoke or elicit a reaction.
maybe the killer's into the controversy of it.
I think one of these blog posters might be our guy.
maybe.
click on that photo link.
what?
there's no yellow tape.
no bystanders.
no crime scene.
let me the check the metadata.
this photo was taken at 5: 49 a. m.
the body wasn't reported till after 7: 00.
I guess our "artist" couldn't resist a snapshot of his first installation.
"anonymous" is Blisterman.
how much trouble am I in?
well, that remains to be seen.
but the way I see it, you encouraged a serial killer to kill on your blog.
I did no such thing. Did I?
we'll leave that up to a jury of your peers.
I swear to God, I didn't want to hurt anybody.
I didn't do anything.
except shooting your mouth off.
sometimes that's all it takes.
look, right now, you're going to do exactly what I tell you to.
of course.
what do you want me to do?
the killer's been posting to your blog from different IP addresses around town.
so, you're gonna go on this computer, get on your blog, and post another reply to Mr. Anonymous.
you're going to get him to respond and when he does, you're going to keep him talking until our people can run an IP trace route and find out where he is now,
you understand?
no.
just start typing.
right.
what do you want me to say?
just tell him he's a genius, all right?
tell him that, uh, Michelangelo's got nothing on him.
whatever, just think of something.
come on. Come on!
right.
I'll be right back.
keep typing.
ma'am?
my boy, my Charlie.
he's only nine years old.
he didn't come home from school today.
we had a fight this morning and I thought that he was at his dad's house--we're divorced
and then the school told me about some kind of alert that was happening.
right. Do you have any idea where he might be going?
no, no.
okay...
detective Vartann, I got him.
I got him talking.
LVPD!
please remain calm.
I'd like everybody to stay right where they are.
Where's the kid?
what kid?
get up!
get him out of here.
what-what kid?
Hey, hey! Hey!
I didn't do anything.
come on!
there was tan dust on the guy's hands like the other vics.
burlap fibers.
does it help?
I don't know.
Blisterman didn't put himself in a burlap sack.
you know, maybe these fibers are environmental.
like they're present in whatever space he's keeping his victims in.
you know, there's a lot of converted warehouses and industrial properties near this library.
if Blisterman already has the kid, he'd probably stay close to home.
we've got city plans for the area around the library.
maps, building usage permits...
okay, check every structure, every single one.
he's willing to talk, but only to someone who "understands his work."
I'm ready to slap him around.
I figured you could show some restraint.
I'll try.
Mr. Blisterman.
can you please turn the monitor so I can see it?
could you tighten up the frame up a little?
the composition is...
it's a bit weak.
thank you.
look...I'm here to talk about the child.
I'm happy to talk.
I like to talk, but I want my words to be heard the way I speak them.
I want the world to see the words coming from my lips, so there can be no misinterpretation.
nobody's going to misinterpret anything you say.
but if you don't start cooperating...
don't, don't...rush me.
I want to talk about what I want to talk about, and I don't want... to be rushed, please.
that's the trouble with modern life, it's too much urgency.
it's too much speed.
now I'm sweaty.
do you have a handkerchief?
thank you.
aesthetics have always been very important to me.
life wouldn't be worth living without beauty.
it's what makes us human.
what about the people you've murdered?
they were human.
Yeah, but...
they were nothing until I de them extraordinary.
how about the child?
has he become "extraordinary"?
I have been alone my entire life.
I have tried and tried to achieve some recognition for my work, and I have been repeatedly and cruelly ignored.
and this has made me feel very...bad...about myself.
you're going to be put to death if you don't help us.
I'm not scared of dying.
I just don't want to be forgotten.
I think I found it.
487 Franklyn Street.
it's a warehouse, formerly deeded to a company that manufactured natural fiber bags and shipping materials.
go. I'll call it in.
I want something of who I was left behind so people will speak my name, and know who I was, after I'm gone.
believe me.
no one will ever forget you.
you've made it.
you're a legend.
if I tell you where the boy is, you're going to turn the camera off, and then...
I'll be sad.
I won't turn the camera off.
I'm sorry.
without the boy, the piece is incomplete.
487...Franklyn Street.
you're far too late to save him.
anyway...
I got what I wanted.
you'll rember me.
won't you?
what the hell is that?
sounds like a motor.
take that hall.
all right, yeah, I got him.
patrol, this is CSI Sanders.
we need paramedics.
breathe! Breathe!
Hey, it's okay.
the call did say 419 at Choozy's Chicken.
not him.
him.
Oh, careful, guys. It's real slippery back here.
manager Bob Graham, Salt Lake City, Utah. Had a whopping $42 in his wallet.
make that $62.
who found him?
well, a patrol car went by and saw the broken window around 12: 15 A. M.
place closes at 11: 00 P. M. so a call went out to the night manager, Kiwi Long.
floor's covered in oil.
probably from the fryer.
it does look a bit low.
and it's still on.
looks like somebody interrupted closing time.
I have a backpack here.
vic has multiple lacerations, contusions and fractures.
all confined to his face and skull.
razor's still wet.
a little personal hygiene at the dish sink? Yum.
a pair of jeans.
men's.
too small to be the victim's.
this stuff's got to be an employee's.
somebody's using this place as a motel.
maybe Big Bob caught them checking in and things went very wrong.
if Backpack Dude had a key, then why use the mascot as a battering ram?
I'm Choozy Chicken, the chicken of choice, but you can just call me delicious!
maybe he can tell us.
registers are empty.
robbery?
not sure.
you know, back in high school, I used to work at a fast food place.
we would put the cash in a drop safe and leave the registers open to show that there wasn't anything to steal.
I'm gonna go check the manager's office.
you find something, Ray?
will you kill the overhead fluorescents, please? - Yeah.
drag marks.
starting from the fryer...leading to the back door, diminishing as they go.
possible second victim?
possibly.
and the blood... tell you anything special?
tails on the blood drops establish directionality.
but these tails indicate that the blood is going into the kitchen.
drag marks lead outside.
oil out, blood in. Good observation.
can't be full of oil if it's full of body.
nothing.
this drum doesn't belong to Choozy's Chicken.
it says,"Mr. Hu's Mandarin Kitchen."
what, do you eat a lot of Chinese or something?
I wrote a journal article about dengue fever.
most of the research was in Mandarin.
Oh, well, that's good. Then, you and Mr. Hu will have a lot to discuss.
my Mandarin's a little... a little rusty.
skid marks.
somebody was in a hurry.
scuff marks on the pole.
I have something.
mirror.
looks like transfer.
looks like the killer and whoever he was dragging made a not-so-clean getaway.
I'm Kiwi Long, manager on call.
captain Jim Brass.
mister -- Captain Brass, I don't know why the alarm didn't go off.
I - I was supposed to close last night, but I've been having some trouble with my son's babysitter.
Bob said that he was going to cover for me, and he's a regional manager, so I figured the place was in good hands.
Oh, my God, that could have been me last night.
who else, uh, closed up last night?
she's one of my best employees -- really responsible.
I'm going to need to get in touch with her.
I already called her. It went to voicemail.
something must be wrong. She always takes my call.
okay, uh, who else has the combination to the drop safe?
only me and Bob.
it's the day I got my promotion, the day my son was born, and the day we got our cat Zoey-Omega.
so... 23-31-12.
okay, I - I'm gonna need all your surveillance.
Oh, you have to call corporate. It goes straight to them.
some clips ended up on YouTube that were, um, unflattering to the franchise.
not on my watch, but, um, ever since, all the surveillance cameras are wired to a digital feed in the manager's office.
I'm gonna need contact information for all your employees, both former and current. Okay?
Oh, are you going to be contacting Bob's next of kin, or should I?
because... I don't know who they are.
the husband's blood alcohol level is through the roof.
the wife's dead in the bedroom.
mailman tried to deliver this when he found them.
nice house to lose.
Mr. Tucker's a mortgage broker.
his wife's a real estate agent, so they probably got first pick.
there's no sign of forced entry, but the place is a sty.
Yeah, looks like he's been living on the couch.
thready pulse. BP's 90 over 60. He's wasted.
he's gonna need a stomach pump. - I'm good. I'm good.
Rigor's begun to set.
and her liver temp is 93 degrees, which means she's been dead three to five hours.
you want to bet that that's about the time the husband started drinking?
okay, I'm on my way to the hospital to get his statement.
I'll get back to you.
looks like some kind of a struggle.
Yeah. But it wasn't a fair fight.
she was handcuffed.
which under the right circumstances can be fun.
you got a C. O.D. there, Dave?
undetermined.
Catherine, I apologize for the overshare.
thank you for the overshare.
whoa, you have your hands full.
uh, yeah. Just put your stuff down over there.
Thanks. I'm, uh, I'm still trying to get organized.
trying to figure out when's a good time to eat lunch.
lunch -- which, I just turned into... a biohazard.
your vic had quite a night.
Ante-mortem, fractured cheek bones, broken nose.
and I have some sort of a...
circular trauma to the cerebellum.
I think he might have gotten whacked in the head with a "wet floor" sign.
No!
so much for safety in the workplace.
this is your C. O.D.
high-speed impact to the base of the skull, at the atlanto-occipital junction, dislodged the C-1 vertebrae, severing the spinal cord.
hit, fall, kick. Who knows?
but death swift and certain.
Stokes. Really.
Thanks. We'll pay him a visit.
Mandy got a hit off of the side-view mirror.
he's a former Choozy's Chicken employee who's already in the system for assaulting dear old Bob here.
let's go check him out.
okay. - Thanks, Doc.
uh, you can just leave it. Come back later for it.
thank you.
where were you last night, Max?
here. Studying.
can anyone confirm that?
sure. 32 other frat brothers.
we were all here. Studying.
this side-view mirror is from your truck.
we found it last night at the Choozy's Chicken on Tropicana.
Hey, maybe we should take all 32 brothers downtown, what do you think?
why not? - Yeah?
okay. Okay.
look, um, the damage was an accident.
it was supposed to be a smooth operation. You know?
tie him up, throw him the truck, bring him back here.
but he fell, and he was too heavy to lift.
and I was working with a new crew.
so, I guess I miscalculated.
I talked to my dad, he said he'd pay.
you can't buy your way out of this one.
you've already assaulted him once.
were you trying to finish what you started?
what the hell?
how does it feel to be my chicken bitch?
Oh, where you going? - Come on, fatty!
you embarrassed me.
forgot friendliness.
and service.
that's why people choose Choozy's.
no, no, I was there last night, but I didn't run into Bob.
I didn't see anybody. The place was closed.
come on, Max. Your record kind of speaks for itself here, man.
look, that guy was an asshat.
that assault charge is bogus.
ask anybody who was there.
the dude went berserk on me-- it was self-defense.
is that what got you fired?
Oh, no, I wasn't fired. I just quit. I only took the job for recon.
recon?
Choozy's Chicken was the only one I didn't have.
good-looking couple.
you could blind yourself on these incisors. Ting!
looks like we have a runner.
didn't know that wine had electrolytes.
they say it's good for your heart.
Yeah, a lot of good it did her.
now we know how they got those whites so pearly.
home from a run.
more than halfway through an afternoon cocktail.
they haven't been getting along, he's drunk, - and he won't take no for an answer. - No!
romantic.
I do like the extra money working at Choozy's gives me, but mainly, you got to keep busy when you're my age.
sure. Sure you do.
can I just get you to keep your fingers straight?
dude, I can't lose this job or my dad's gonna take my car away.
well, if you didn't do anything wrong, you don't have anything to worry about.
well, Jackson's always doing something wrong.
I can't believe this is all over Bob.
probably choked stuffing Choozy's down his pie hole.
Jabrone.
you just didn't like him 'cause he wouldn't let you throw ice cubes in the fryer.
it's the best thing about the job, Marge.
okay, has anybody seen Elizabeth Martin or Gary Comstock?
no, I haven't seen either of them.
Ooh, Gary. Gary, could you give me a ride home?
dude, shut up, okay? He's just a nice guy.
Yeah, for a homeless junkie.
look who's talking.
you're, like, one spliff away from rehab, moron.
thousands in the safe.
a stack of loose cash, and only $200 missing?
that's not much of a robbery.
well, it could be. Elizabeth Martin was closing up with Big Bob last night.
I ran down her address from her license.
I mean, it's Ann Elizabeth Martin.
she's a Seven Hills desperate housewife with 2. 5 kids and a Nordic silver SUV and a recurring victim of identity theft.
little lie, big lie?
could be an illegal.
someone with priors.
maybe Bob caught her with her hand in the cookie jar.
excuse me, Captain Brass. - Wendy.
um, we just finished getting the fingerprints and DNA from all the Choozy's Chicken employees, but there were two no-shows: Elizabeth Martin and Gary Comstock.
now, I actually got a CODIS hit from one of them 'cause the epithelials from the razor came back to Gary.
in the system for felony drug charges?
last-known address was a rehab center?
I called it, but they said they hadn't seen him in six weeks.
Yeah, that's because he's living out of a backpack at Choozy's.
well, easy to do when you have a friend with a key to the back door.
so, Gary's on crack time.
he comes back there to crash.
only Bob's still there, catches him in the act, and all hell breaks loose.
what are you doing here, Gary?
well, where's Elizabeth?
probably in an oil drum somewhere.
no honor among thieves.
okay, but wouldn't a drug addict grab up all the loose cash?
anything come back on the SAE kit?
negative.
no sign of sexual activity, forced or consensual.
so he cuffed her to the bedpost in her underwear, but they didn't have sex.
excuse me. I just wanted to get my kit.
how's business with Choozy's Chicken?
a little confusing. How's your case going?
a bit confusing. You, uh, want to stick around?
Yes, I would.
what do we have, Doctor?
did this woman have a highly stressful job? - Why?
gastric ulcer. Pretty advanced.
Thanks. - Sure. Here.
death by Smurf?
have you ever seen anything like this? - Nope.
minty.
fresh.
shouldn't that be in an evidence bag?
that's not the one from Choozy's Chicken. I took that out of our bathroom.
but first I'm going to give you the bad news.
that bloody handprint on the countertop that was all smudgy?
I got a useable index fingerprint off of that, but it's not a match to anyone, including Gary.
measures about ten inches from the tip of the middle finger to the wrist, which is quite large for a guy and it's huge for a woman.
so we're looking for a guy whodoesn'twork at Choozy's?
right. - Damn. Okay.
then I got a lot of incidental prints on the sign, all of which were eliminated to the employees.
however, there was a set of prints that got my attention.
eight fingertips on one side of the sign, two thumbprints on the other.
that is an attacking grip. - Right.
and I found a matching fingerprint for that on Elizabeth Martin's register receipt.
but I can't say for sure it's hers.
so I need to see Elizabeth.
or, um, one of her fingers.
you're sick, Mandy.
so it says here that that blood drop that I collected from the manager's office is menstrual blood.
it's weird, right?
and weirder still, it's not even Kiwi's.
according to this, it's not any of the female employees.
well, I don't have an exemplar for Elizabeth Martin, so we can't exclude her.
pants off in the manager's office during that time of the month?
assault?
no blood smears, no semen, no torn clothing.
it didn't look like a rape scene.
maybe it was consensual. - With Bob?
or Gary. - Or both.
love triangles can be deadly.
don't I know it.
that was... well said.
the owner of the restaurant is upset because his drums keep getting stolen, and he's not getting his energy rebate.
I didn't know restaurants got rebates for recycling.
that's why he has security cameras pointing straight at his drums.
well, lucky for us, we have Mr. Hu's footage.
now, this is just after midnight, same night your guy was killed at Choozy's.
sweet ride, huh?
Chevy Corvair.
take one, leave an empty.
at least our barrel bandits recycle.
can you get a read off the license plate? - Yeah.
this is Timothy Rand's vehicle.
you know, I missed the whole hippie thing.
I was too busy in Southeast Asia keeping my head down and my feet dry.
I'm surprised you didn't drop a little acid or smoke a little T.
well, things did get a little wild.
I'm Silver.
police. I'm Brass.
and this is Ray Langston from the Crime Lab.
is Timothy around?
Oh, yeah, he's in his workshop. Here, follow me.
can you feel that?
feel what?
high ratio of positive to negative ions.
unfriendly air.
but you can't let it bring you down.
scientifically proven.
the Santa Anas, the Siroccos.
you know what I'm talking about.
I know why you're here, but this is not a crime, man.
they put this valuable resource out with the trash!
some restaurants are, you know, pouring it down storm drains, or dumping it in the desert.
only to be deep fried and wind up as plaque in our arteries, it is this, biodiesel.
it only cost me 200 bucks to convert my van!
you know what I'm saying? One man can...
make a difference!
look, this planet is our mother, and we're all her children.
that's right, baby.
Where'd you get the Choozy Chicken barrel?
the one on, uh, Tropicana.
I always return them.
I just haven't processed this one yet.
well, congratulations. It's a boy.
David, you have the touch of a surgeon.
thank you.
looks like there's a blood stain on the boxers. I'm going to need to get those to DNA.
will do.
ante-mortem abrasions on the second and third knuckle.
could be from busting up Bob's face.
extensive third degree burns here.
I'm gonna need to, uh, take a look inside his mouth.
go ahead.
there are full thickness burns on all exposed surfaces of his face.
there's damage to the nares and nasal mucosa.
so his breathing was compromised.
that's your C. O.D.
asphyxia due to inhalation of hot oil.
prints just confirmed I. D.
it's Gary Comstock.
tox panel came back clean.
so he wasn't using anymore.
the man had a second chance at life.
till he was murdered.
Nope. Any news on blue goo?
the blue goo was toothpaste.
approximately 12 ounces worth.
equivalent to two full tubes.
Yeah, we collected a couple of empties in the trash at the house.
I'll compare them.
is it possible to O. D. on toothpaste?
definitely, if it's fluoride toothpaste.
each tube comes with a warning
if swallowed, please contact the Poison Control Center immediately.
never had a cavity.
no joke.
how much fluoride would it take kill a person?
depends on the person.
uh, female victim, 110 pounds.
with a pre-existing stomach ulcer.
which means it would get into her system faster.
the P. T.D. -- "Probably Toxic Dose"
is five milligrams per kilogram of body weight.
a regular tube of toothpaste -- you're talking 170 grams, 25 percent of which is fluoride, so...
170 times... . 25 is 425...
she's 50 kilograms. Yeah. So...
she would need 250 milligrams for it to be toxic.
and if there's 425 milligrams in one tube...
so one tube would do it.
assuming she absorbed it all and didn't throw it up.
well, then, for sure, two tubes would get the job done.
she would experience what I like to call a catastrophic symptom train.
wicked muscle spasms would give way to...
decreased heart rate, lowered blood pressure, decreased respiration and, eventually, death.
death by toothpaste.
you know, I got something else.
I found trace amounts of diphenhydramine hydrochloride in her tox panel.
maybe she had allergies.
someone slipped it to her.
I analyzed her wine. It was cheap a California merlot with an antihistamine mickey.
Why?
well, diphenhydramine hydrochloride is both a soporific and an antiemetic.
it makes you sleepy and it keeps you from puking.
paramedics found this in your pocket.
it's the key to the handcuffs that we took off your wife.
we checked your Pay-Per-View selections.
you've been watching a lot of bondage porn lately.
strap Daddy. Silk Cuffs OneandTwo.
what happened to my wife?
Scott, there's not enough booze in this town to make you forget murder.
fluoride poisoning?
are you kidding me with this?
no. See I'm thinking you're a mortgage broker.
your business is in the crapper.
the bank is trying to foreclose on your house and your wife had a very nice insurance policy.
nice enough for you to pay off all those debts.
you see where I'm going, Scott?
look, I'll admit things weren't that great between Melinda and I. Okay?
she blamed me for losing the house and... everything else.
but those handcuffs are from better times.
we hadn't had sex in months.
we, uh, checked your medical records.
you have receding gums.
so what? Who cares about my gums?
well, you use a special, high fluoride toothpaste.
we found your prints all over these.
Yeah. Before Melinda became a real estate agent, she was a dental hygienist.
we had boxes of that stuff lying around.
free samples. We both used it.
look, if I had tried to cram toothpaste down Melinda's throat she would have kicked me in the cubes.
Hey, Ray.
did your "Barrel Boy" wear glasses?
not according to his D. M.V. record.
but Big Bob did.
halt. You can't bring food in here.
not my rules.
I found this in the fryer oil.
along with two metal screws, which was the giveaway.
cheap plastic frames and lenses.
these don't look like French fries.
that's because those are bits of Gary.
and what were these?
once upon a time, those were $180.
how do we know that?
all right, what am I looking at here?
you are looking at a plastic security strip.
it's embedded in all U. S.bank notes.
supposedly to prevent counterfeiting.
although I've heard that they can be read by satellites, so the "Man" knows how much money's in your pocket.
and we still can't find Bin Laden.
nine plastic strips.
nine twenties -- $180.
plus the 20 we found in the dead manager's pocket.
so all the missing money from Choozy's Chicken is accounted for.
which means there was no robbery.
we've got evidence that isn't telling us the whole story.
so... let's walk through this again. Shall we?
Bob was on the floor here.
there were oil drag marks leading from the kitchen to the Dumpster.
and we now know that Gary was dragged outside and put into an oil drum.
there was also a blood trail leading in from the Dumpster as well as blood stains on Gary's boxer shorts.
now, DNA confirms that both samples were "Dead Bob's" blood.
Bob bled on Gary dragging him out, and then bled on the ground when he walked back in.
but did Bob kill Gary?
or was there another assailant?
all right. I'll be Gary.
you be Big Dead Bob.
seriously. - Yeah.
seriously. Okay.
we struggle. - We struggle.
you shove my face in the oil.
that could explain...
how Bob's glasses ended up in the fryer.
as well as the missing $200 that could've slipped out of his shirt pocket.
let's do it again.
look at your left hand.
you're using it as leverage.
if Bob pushed Gary into the fryer, the handprint we collected would be Bob's.
but it's not.
well, the evidence can't be wrong...
but we could be.
what you doing?
I need to see for myself the volume of 340 grams of toothpaste.
you know, unencumbered by a tube it is an awful lot.
join in. I used to do this as a kid.
now we get paid for doing it.
even with an anti-emetic, how would you force this much toothpaste down someone's throat?
excuse me for interrupting arts and crafts,
Ah, it's an experiment.
well, maybe for you.
the toothpaste that Mrs. Tucker ingested contained a bleaching agent.
the tubes you collected didn't.
there were two empty tubes of toothpaste in their bedroom, but it's not the toothpaste that killed her.
arts and crafts are over. Gotta go back to the house.
their life in garbage.
and no toothpaste.
nothing on the ground or in the planter.
shoe rubber.
the gate was locked. Homeowner's about 80.
once I asked loudly enough, she gave us permission to search without a warrant.
fluoride toothpaste with bleach.
okay, you know what, no more shotgun approach.
you need to start prioritizing your latents.
no, no, I'm only interested in one print, the handprint.
okay, but I already put that through the database.
well, we're having a little disparity between context and the evidence.
what are you asking me?
is it possible the print got distorted?
well, you can only distort prints with pressure or body weight.
well, we do now think that the surface print was left during a struggle, and Bob Graham was a big boy, so can you run that index finger for me again?
Yeah, okay. - Thank you.
it's a reversal.
there must have been enough pressure to invert the print.
I'm sorry, I missed it. Okay. Right.
do you see how these appear to be ridges, but there is no sweat glands?
which is because those are furrows.
it's a match. I'm sorry.
it's okay, you're human. Stokes.
Hey, Nicky, I got Elizabeth Martin from her canceled payroll checks.
the bank gave me her address.
so she's alive. - Oh, yeah.
did her record kick back any priors?
no record. Immigration got wind of it.
they scooped up her whole family.
she's an illegal working here on a fake I. D.
she's in Interrogation now. I'll let you know how it turns out.
all right.
hello.
I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police. - Okay.
let's start with an easy question.
what's your real name?
okay, Rosa Gonzales...
tell me what happened at Choozy's Chicken the other night.
I didn't mean to kill him.
you wanted to see me?
your drop bag was short.
I checked it twice.
you want me to call the police, huh?
I'm gonna have to do a strip search.
he made me take off all my clothes.
did he assault you? Touch you?
he put his hands on me.
No!
what the hell is this?
what are you doing here, Gary?
I'm not the issue here, Bob.
then what happened?
I got dressed. I could hear them fighting.
I went out into the kitchen.
stop it!
get out of here! What the hell are you doing, Bob?
I ran.
but I swear to the Virgin herself, I was just trying to help Gary.
hitting him with the sign isn't what killed him.
so I can go home?
miss Gonzales, you see the immigration agent outside with your family.
they tell me that you're in this country illegally.
I grew up here. I work. I take care of my family.
I believe you, I do, but it's not my call.
well, we've exhausted every suspect, and we still don't know who killed Bob.
well, at this point, it's a locked room mystery.
after all that we've been through, how can you guys eat that?
power of suggestion.
and because I can't help myself. They're good.
it's 'cause they put crack in the fries.
what if the room is the suspect?
according to his insurance records, Bob had twenty-eighty vision.
without his glasses, he was practically blind.
Elizabeth gave him a pretty good whack to the cerebellum, which can affect equilibrium.
add those factors to a slippery floor...
it's a case of blind justice.
so when I'm filling out the paperwork, who do I list on the suspect line?
there is no suspect. It was an accident.
the DNA from inside the latex gloves was... You ready for this?
Scott Tucker? - Related... by marriage.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. It was suicide?
Yeah. With a nice, big frame around it.
otherwise, why not just pop the diphenhydramine?
why spike the wine?
well, maybe she was trying to frame her husband for attempted murder, hoping for a poisoning, not a death.
doubtful. I mean, she was a hygienist.
if that were the case, she would've just stopped at one tube.
Henry did say that there was about an hour between ingestion and her death.
plenty of time to set up the husband.
she goes outside, she...
climbs the fence, she ditches the evidence in the neighbor's trash, and then...
cuffs herself to the bed and then waits to dies?
what could you possibly have done to make your wife hate you so much?
we used to be an amazing team actually.
she'd find the client the house, I'd get them financing. Everyone was happy.
but I always told her -- don't get too friendly;
these are clients, they're not friends.
but she goes to all the parties.
all the barbeques, all the fund-raisers.
so, when the NINJA loans flipped over, and the banks kicked them out of their homes because they couldn't afford to make their payments, well, they called us, screaming like it was our fault, and I blamed her.
if she hadn't gotten all buddy-buddy with them in the first place, they never would have crossed that line.
that's when the marriage went belly-up.
we couldn't look each other in the face after that.
I thought she was weak, and she wanted me to feel bad because I didn't feel worse.
I never thought she'd kill herself, though.
tried to kill me a couple of times.
couldn't sell the house, couldn't afford to get a divorce.
I can't believe that bitch set me up.
figured it's better than nothing till they find you something.
you could put a desk in there.
it's perfect.
I should check with Catherine first.
I already did.
all right. Thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome.
I think I'll be right at home here.
happy Birthday, Nicky. - Happy Birthday, Nick.
your favorite.
Oh, wow, thanks.
here you are.
didn't know if you were a stripe or solid man.
I told him to let it ride on paisley.
you can wear it to your next arson scene.
fair enough, thanks.
Hey, you know, Pancake Hutch has a free breakfast on your birthday.
my treat.
uh, not tonight. Maybe another time.
they know you're lying when you try it any other night.
guilty. You've done it, too.
okay. Got it.
a place called Park Pines Motel.
I'll take it.
but... Uh, what about your cake?
save me a piece. Thanks.
so the victim is a 16-year-old girl who lives on the premises.
she's the daughter of Mark and Nicole Jones, who run the motel.
you remember them?
so...
all I can tell you is that our daughter was there...
I knew her.
Yeah, well, I'm going to, uh... I'm going to go knock on some doors.
so what happened?
365 Days Ago - What's your name? - Haley.
what's yours? - Nick.
so what happened?
well, Haley, that's what I have to figure out.
how far into decomp is he?
he isn't.
look, it's a fresh wound to the back of the head.
the body's still warm.
it's the immaculate decomposition.
the manager heard a gunshot. Called it in.
vic's ID says Harry Steadwell.
one round fired from Dirty Harry's revolver.
well, he wasn't shot.
is he the registered guest?
I found a room key in his pocket, but no luggage or belongings in the room.
but he brought his own garage door opener?
is this his? - Yeah.
all right, I'll go talk to the manager.
I don't mind stepping out.
looks like the dresser gave him the hair cut.
you know, if he fell back from sitting in the chair, he wouldn't have had enough momentum to whack his head this hard.
unless he was...
standing on it.
that could be a bullet hole.
Hey, Dave? You might want to...
God!
no. No, that didn't happen.
sorry, brother. - Oh, my God!
Hey, friend? Got five bucks for a cup of coffee?
five bucks?
venti half-caf latte, couple biscotti.
you know, it's a fair price.
Oh, sorry, bud.
you'll be back. Cops are always here.
every night, manager'd be banging on that door. Cops are here! Cops are here!
last manager took off a week ago without notice.
the new guy started today, so the office is a mess.
here he is.
here you go.
what do you got for me?
checked into room seven last Thursday; paid for one night.
there's no record of him checking out.
all right, I need to get into the crawl space above room seven.
does every room have an access panel?
beats me. I just got here.
look, uh, you're welcome to check.
thank you.
Thanks. - Sure.
let me know what I can do. - Okay.
I just spent two hours testifying about decapitation by blown tire.
then I realized something.
happy Birthday, pal.
you figure it out yet?
no. No, not yet, Haley.
you can tell me. I'm not scared of that stuff.
I can see that.
Haley, leave the man alone!
if it were up to her, I'd be locked in my room all day.
but I told her, forensics is just science, you know?
it's what you go to school for and...
but you don't look like my Chem teacher.
Thanks. I think.
you, uh, do know the crime scene's in the next room?
I always look for the yellow tape.
there's something dead up there, Greg.
and it's big, heavy and smells awful.
one of us has got to go up there and get it.
you know what? It's your birthday.
I'm keeping that gift card.
what?
I think I found your Big Drip.
looks like he, uh, crawled in the same way I did.
always die downstairs.
same address as the motel.
I think we just found that missing manager.
that is a lot of green.
and a little grey.
it's got to be insulation.
found the same stuff in the crawl space.
in a No-Tell like Park Pines, ceiling's a favorite spot to stash your goodies.
Hey, the, uh, prints on the remote were all Dale Durney, the dead manager.
FYI, the batteries are dead.
and the prints on the money's rubber band are Dale Durney and Harry Steadwell.
well, we know Dale pocketed it.
Harry probably stashed it.
why would he leave it there for a week?
it wasn't by choice.
Harry got arrested the same day he checked into the motel for violating an ex's restraining order.
got released from this morning.
so he goes back to the motel.
Yeah, to retrieve his money.
and then... what? He shoots the man who swiped his cash?
even though the dude's been dead for...?
about a week.
judging by the presence of first and second instar maggots.
decomp appears to have been accelerated by extreme heat and the lack of airflow in the crawl space.
recovered a bullet from the right iliopsoas muscle.
no evidence of hemorrhage in the abdominal cavity.
no bleeding in the muscle or intestinal walls.
so wound occurred after he was dead.
what about C.O.D?
well, it turns out his fortune can be read from his palms.
silvery wounds. I excised samples of flesh for histology.
under magnification, the samples showed streaming of nuclei consistent with electrical burns.
C. O.D. is cardiac arrest. Electrocution.
he was in the crawl space, so maybe he came in contact with exposed wiring.
I found the receiver to that remote control.
can you tell what it's for?
Yeah, it's wired to the access panel above you.
I killed the circuit.
there's a layer of metal sandwiched in the middle here.
it's like my eighth grade science fair project.
a homemade electromagnet.
wire wraps around an iron rod.
current runs through it, creating a magnetic field. Genius.
guy who lives here said that the manager, Dale, was beating on room seven's door every night, saying the cops were coming.
don't remember many call outs.
me, either.
I think it was a setup.
a week ago, Harry Steadwell checks into room seven with $10K, dirty money.
cops in the lot! Cops!
what Harry doesn't know is that Manager Dale's got a plan to profit off guys like Harry.
he turns on his electromagnetic lock.
Harry can't get his money. Gives up and leaves.
so, Dale goes to see what goodies had Harry all fired up.
but he can't get the panel open.
the batteries in his remote are dead.
so he hustles up and over to reap his harvest, notices the panel's a little off, thinks it's a casualty of Harry's pounding.
the real casualty is the frayed wire inside the panel.
and the crawl space is hot.
Dale's got sweaty palms, and sweat is a great electrolyte.
a week later, Harry gets sprung from the clink, comes back to get his money.
but why did he shoot the dead guy?
I don't think he knew Dale was up there, man.
the panel was still magnetized.
maybe he was using his gun to bang it open.
it got magnetized, and shot by accident.
Mr. Jones.
got a few numbers of the crime scene cleanup people.
decomp can be a little bit harder to get out of the carpet than you think.
Thanks.
boy, she makes friends fast.
Nah, Bree and her have been friends for a while.
she didn't have to switch schools when we moved.
well, that's good. Take care now. - Yeah.
Hey, thanks for those numbers. - Yeah, you got it, man.
Hey, buddy-- you still want that cup of coffee?
hell, yeah.
there you go. Happy Birthday.
it's not my birthday. Thanks, man.
240 Days Ago t know what they did to me.
they?
that whole family-- they're weird. Like obsessed.
aren't you friends with Haley?
was. I-I guess.
but then she and her mom started giving me the creeps.
Mrs. Jones would just stare at me.
and when Haley showed up in home room with her hair exactly like me a few weeks ago, that was it, I was done.
so, Bree, what happened?
I turned 16 tonight.
everyone threw this bonfire for me.
it was tons of fun.
and then the world went all weird.
I don't remember anything until I woke up here-- in Haley's living room.
my pants off.
where was Haley's father?
standing over me.
get off me! Get off me!
we were here. We were asleep. Mark heard something.
Bree was in the living room and just ran out.
I have no idea what she was even doing here.
Mr. Jones, I'm, uh, I'm going to need to collect your underwear.
no, no. You can, uh, leave that door open, if you don't mind.
I swear to you, I was sleeping.
I heard something. I...
I came here and I saw Bree and she just... just took off.
what was she doing here? - She has a key.
my wife gave it to her. Told her she could hang here anytime she wants.
her parents, they... they work.
they're not around at, so...
she's my daughter's best friend.
all right.
why don't you put on some clothes.
you're going to need to come with us-- give your statement.
I just need a little more information.
Hey, Jim. - Yeah.
this SUV over here's got mud all over the tires.
you might want to find out whose it is.
it's the Jones'.
okay, so tell me again-- where we you all tonight?
uh, we were here. We stayed in all night.
so the car just drove itself to the bonfire? Is that what happened?
it was me, I went. - What?
I knew what was going to be going on there tonight.
and that's why I didn't want you to go. So I went there and I took some pictures, - so that you could see what I'm talking about... - Did people see you?
Haley, it... - Unbelievable!
I hate you! I hate you! - Okay, Officer Mitchell, Officer Mitchell, why don't you take Haley and buy her a soda on us, okay?
you got it. Miss, let's take a walk.
so what, you grabbed your camera and said you were talking pictures for the yearbook?
I'm going to need to see that camera.
can you tell me who's in this photo from last night?
these guys are all baseball players.
Bryan Rupert and Cole Maliska were my boyfriends.
Dave Henkel is. And Trey Gallo wants to be.
though some people have been saying he already is.
and what about this one?
he was there?
no, this creep should not have been anywhere near my party's galaxy.
at school, even when I don't see him following me, I can smell the Sharpie on his fingernails.
I reported him for stalking last semester.
there's paperwork and everything.
so if you weren't invited to Bree's birthday party, why'd you go?
I was looking for someone.
that'd be Bree, right? - Epic fail, sir.
no, I can't stand Bree Lindale, her Neanderthal harem, or the ozone of suck that lingers around them all.
well, according your school disciplinary report you were stalking her.
I was not stalking Bree Lindale.
I was stalking Haley Jones. - Zack.
who always follows Bree around.
Haley's the one that I went to go see at the party.
Zack... - Dad, she's the hottest girl at school.
cause I can tell there's a vicious bad girl inside just waiting to claw its way out.
and as soon as it does, I'm gonna be there to rope it up and take it to homecoming.
anyway, she wasn't even there, so I just left.
okay, that's all he's got to say. That's it. Come on.
sure. We're gonna need a DNA sample.
absolutely not.
my son-client will not be offering any...
all right, all right, look, look, I heard what happened to Bree, and until Pops here gets me my birthday Beemer I'm rolling ten-speed.
I don't think I took her anywhere on my bike.
I got your message. What's going on?
well, um...
you know the snapshots of the bonfire Nicole Jones took? - Yeah.
well, I checked the camera's memory drive.
discovered some recently-deleted photos.
they're all of Bree Lindale.
but not one of her own daughter.
why don't you tell us about these photos from your camera?
I had a daughter.
you mean another daughter?
Melissa.
she died when she was an infant. It was before Haley was born.
when Haley became friends with Bree, I couldn't help seeing that...
Bree looked just like Melissa.
but I thought you just said she died when she was a baby.
I can see it in her eyes.
it's what Melissa would have looked like if she had grown up.
so that's why you went to Bree's birthday party to take photos of her.
I let myself pretend, just... for a moment that Bree is Melissa.
she isn't dead.
then why did you, uh, delete her photos?
I was worried that Haley would find them.
we've never told Haley about Melissa.
do you have any idea what it's like to lose a daughter?
when I was driving away from at party Bree was drinking with those boys.
did you-- did you even talk to the boys?
tox from Bree Lindale.
positive for GHB in her blood.
date rape drug.
Yes, but Wendy said to tell you the S. A.E. came back negative for penetration.
however, there were epithelials of an unknown male in the region.
by region, do you mean the pubic region?
because the trace on Bree Lindale's "down there place" came back as Neatsfoot oil and hydrotreated paraffinic petroleum distillates.
Neatsfoot oil?
used to use that to treat our mitts in Pony League.
much as I'm intrigued by this bizarre equestrian competition of which you speak, the compound's actually a consumer product sold to condition baseball gloves.
what's up, you need to swab me again?
no, no, the first swab gave us what we needed.
a warrant to search your vehicle while you were at batting practice.
where we found...
your GHB.
my trainer gave me that.
what about Bree Lindale? - What about her?
she's my girlfriend.
I want you to listen to me now.
I know she was with you.
now, if you want me to match the muddy shoe impressions all over your passenger side floor mat to her, I will.
you're 18, man. You'll go to jail.
I didn't do anything.
you didn't drug her? - Come on.
you didn't assault her?
I didn't get the chance to do anything.
I never do with Bree.
she keeps saying that she's saving herself.
but half the dugout's been saying that Trey Gallo, the pitcher, he's been hittin' it.
they even had a motel room.
are you okay?
what's wrong? Do you want to go?
figured no point in letting that room go to waste.
especially if Trey paid for it.
and that GHB-- that stuff barely worked.
what are you doing? Get off of me!
what are you doing?
Bree, wait.
surveillance cameras picked you up walking down Fremont.
the motel's only a couple blocks from there.
you jumped out of Dave Henkel's truck.
then what happened?
I was kinda freaked and I didn't want to deal with getting home.
so you just crashed there?
the Joneses didn't drug you or kidnap you?
no.
then what did Mr. Jones do to you?
tell her what he did to you, Bree.
he didn't do anything.
I just didn't want Haley to think we were friends again.
like I was there for a slumber party or something.
so your boyfriend drugs you, attempts to rape you, and you're willing to let your friend's family take the rap?
Haley is not my friend.
Hey, Crime Scene, check me out.
90 days clean, just me and Lady Caffeine.
Yeah, lookin' good.
always, man.
Flossin'!
Hi, Haley.
parents around?
okay.
well, I brought back your mom's camera, couple other things here, so...
well, sorry to, uh, sorry to interrupt you.
you want to see something?
and the hits just keep coming.
don't worry about that.
blow it off.
you don't get it, do you?
my life is over!
manager's daughter found the body when she came in to clean the room.
check-in records have her listed as Tanya Carrow, Arizona driver's license number.
manager's wife confirmed she checked in last night.
and she's only 32.
long years, though.
just got released from Arizona state pen.
nine years on a narco rap.
lot of priors before that, mostly drugs.
foam around the mouth.
clothes are damp from sweat.
both indicate overdose.
Where's all her stuff?
there isn't any.
she could have just checked in to use.
then where's the paraphernalia?
flushed the evidence before the high killed her?
Hey, Nick, I hear you're putting together a college fund for Warrick's son?
thank you, David.
appreciate it.
so what's with the shattered lamp?
she could have knocked it over during her OD seizure.
or there was someone else in here with her.
they could have used together, had a fight.
could have grabbed Tanya's stuff and bailed.
Oh, God!
maybe they heard something.
I'm on it.
from the Lime Crab.
the Crab Lime.
no, I am from the Crime Lab.
were you here last night, sir?
Hey, sweetheart, firecracker wants to know if we were here last night.
Oh, yeah, we were here, all right.
we were here, over there and back there and everywhere till my lumbar went out.
that's lumbar, mind you, not lumber.
okay, that's...
thank you.
sir, were you taping last night?
Oh, yeah, live at 11: 00, 12: 00 and 1: 00.
all right, so I'll work on amplifying and isolating the background noises from the neighboring room.
and I'll try to scrub my mental tape deck of the rest.
the frequency range for a live human voice is much broader than what comes out of a crappy motel TV-set speaker.
how many voices?
two, from what I can tell.
and judging from the pitch they're both female.
well, can you tell ifhey're arguing or what?
they're pretty loud.
they'd have to be to get through the walls, even thin ones.
I'm afraid we don't know much at all.
we know the cause of death was multiple organ failure due to oral ingestion of methamphetamine.
a lot more than a recreational dose.
my colleagues tell me there was meone else in the room.
possibly a fight.
but as far as what else happened to your daughter, we really don't know.
I'm sorry, Mr.Carrow.
I know you deserve more answers.
no, I don't.
you know, you think it's gonna be easy.
even with her mom dead and you busting your ass working every day, small town like Eagar, Arizona, you figure, you know, what do you got to do to keep her out of trouble?
by 16, she was already gone: drugs and juvie.
it's lost.
it's a long ride up here.
I realize that's probably about the most time I'd ever spent on her.
hadn't really talked for ten years.
so, no, I...
I don't know what she and the world owed each other, but, uh...
I don't deserve any answers.
okay, here's what we got.
the victim is a 16-year-old girl who lives here on the premises.
she's the daughter of Mark and Nicole Jones who run the motel.
you remember them, don't you?
I knew her.
she was stabbed in the chest.
Nick, looks like a single wound.
Yeah, close kill like this, the killer's prably covered with blood.
so, the girl's parents were inside the apartment when this happened.
the didn't hear anything.
they came out and found her like this, but we have a suspect.
the victim broke up with her boyfriend yesterday.
things got ugly, officers responded, so we're bringing him in now.
I heard this one was personal for you.
Hey, Nick, I found this in her pocket.
same hairstyle, not the same gir though.
I'll spiral out, see if I can find the weapon.
okay.
a few months ago, she came to me and she said that she had a vision.
that's what she called it, a miraculous vision of her destiny.
and she said that she was going to embrace that destiny today.
she just told me about it yesterday.
so she dumped you for St. Peter.
I'm gonna ask you again.
where were you tonight?
I don't, I don't...
we're going to need a, uh, a promise of immunity before my client reveals his alibi to you.
I'll mention it to the DA.
he is not saying anything until we've been legally assured against prosecution.
I was in Reno.
and I was-- I was ere slinging crystal.
I was dealing drugs.
that's what I do.
and Haley, she helped me.
but if that's why she didn't want to be with me anymore, why I wasn't "fit for her destiny...
I would have changed.
she didn't use drugs.
I didn't have to.
I would have done whatever she wanted.
now, the photo you found in the victim's pocket...
I asked Archie to blow it up.
well, at first we thought this girl and her baby were in a park.
you see the barbed wire?
it's not a park.
it's a prison.
white Sands Youth Detention Center, Arizona.
you see the logo on the guy's jacket?
any idea when this was taken?
Yes.
Archie dated the Polaroid stock by batch number, narrowed it down to 1993.
now, the foliage here suggests summer, so we checked the facility's records.
three Caucasian inmates gave birth that summer.
one of those babies had the same birth date as Haley Jones.
so Haley was adopted.
what's her name, the birth mother?
overdosed at the Park Pines back in November.
she went and found her daughter.
mark and Nicole Jones denied knowing her.
they might be telling the truth if it was a blind adoption.
pull my other leg and it plays "Jingle Bells.
Hi, uh, my name is Tanya.
remember me?
um, I'm not here to make trouble.
I was just wondering if I could see my daughter. I
we had Tanya's juvie record unsealed.
she was 16 years old.
she was babysitting your daughter.
we would never have left Melissa with her if we had known that she was...
getting high?
we...we were just going to the movies, and we had asked Tanya if she would give Melissa a bath before she put her down.
she left her in the tub.
she drowned.
okay, so Tanya's in juvie.
she finds out she's pregnant.
and that's when we get this call that...
she wants to make amends.
a life for a life.
Haley for Melissa?
so, 16 years later, she shows up, wants to see Haley, who doesn't even know she's adopted.
what do you do?
I gave her a room.
she never checked out, so what happened?
Nicole went to see her that night.
she went to her room and, um...
she told Tanya that she would never, ever see Haley.
they fought.
Tanya agreed that, um... she'd leave.
I kinda figured the disappointment...
I guess that's what made Tanya kill herself.
are you sure she killed herself?
no coffee breaks right now, my man.
yeah?
I'm moving, into a dorm.
got a student loan.
w. L.V. U.Hospitality Studies.
Oh, a few months ago, I saw something.
Mrs. Jones came out of room eight with two coffee cups.
I thought it was strange she went all the way over there to toss them.
I could smell the meth.
the next morning you were here and that woman in room eight...
she was dead.
I didn't tell you about it at the time becae I figured you wouldn't believe somebody like me.
the old me.
I found this under the mattress.
it was an accident.
I was in the office. Haley came in.
with that hair.
I told her it looked disgusting and that she would have to dye it back, or I'd cut it off.
so she stormed out.
I grabbed the scissors.
you were just trying to give her a haircut?
I was just trying to scare her a little, to finally get her to do something that I wanted for once.
you dye it back or I swear to God, I will cut it myself.
leave me alone!
you little bitch!
I hate you!
I've always hated
why didn't you call 911?
I don't know.
she was dead when she hit the ground.
I panicked.
her hair, huh?
it wasn't just the hair.
it was everything.
it was the mouth, the attitude, her boyfriend...
she was just always trying to get to me.
the hair...the hairstyle, it was just one more thing.
something that I would hate.
Yeah, because it made her look exactly like Tanya.
that is her real mother, right?
the one that killed your daughter.
and who you killed four months ago.
she was an addict. She killed herself.
we talked to Haley's boyfriend.
he told us about the stash of meth Haley was holding for him.
it was hidden in her room.
and when it went missing, they figured, you found it, flushed it.
but you didn't flush it, did you, Mrs. Jones?
Zack volunteered a sample of the meth, and we matched it to the drugs that were found in Tanya's stomach the night she died.
and I have an eyewitness that saw you toss two coffee cups into the dumpster that night.
one of which was laced with meth.
how did you get her to drink it, Nicole?
was it a peace offering?
she had no right to just show up.
so you killed her. - No.
Yeah.
and when you saw that Haley looked exactly like Tanya at 16, you killed her again.
I never wanted her.
mark brought her into our home.
I had a daughter.
she was murdered.
so I'm supposed to let the ghost of that murderer live with me?
sleep in the next room?
you all right?
she didn't have to die, Ray.
you're right. She didn't have to die.
you aren't beating yourself up about this, are you?
if I could have figured out what was going on in Tanya Carrow's murder sooner, then Nicole Jones would've been locked up.
Haley would still be alive.
I knew you were a fellow masochist.
tell me what your favorite form of self-flagellation is.
tell you what I like to do.
get on the Internet.
go to a Web site, movie site.
find my favorite movie of the moment.
and then I like to read all e comments telling me why I'm wrong and have such terrible taste.
and when I really can't sleep,
I like to sculpt orchids because it's one thing that will silence the voices in my head.
tonight, there's only one voice.
and she keeps asking me what happened.
what happened?
what happened is a young girl died because of events that were set in motion long before she was ever born.
it doesn't make it feel any better, does it?
you know, Nick?
everyone keeps telling me what this job isn't.
it doesn't have to be this way.
just listen to reason.
I have no use for reason... puny human!
the Selbachian ship is almost within range.
and this vessel shall be the instrument of my revenge.
turn your weapon systems over to me now, or I will kill one of your crew every 2. 5 Earth minutes, beginning with the female.
commander?
it's going to be all right.
all stations secure from general quarters.
a pleasure working with you, Yeoman. As always.
we're talking about a piece of television history.
and it can all be yours for just $750.
do I look like an idiot to you?
that's nice!
fourth
welcome, Whatifitconners.
a special encore presentation of "Astro Quest":
redux will begin in Room 21-B in just a few minutes.
nice uniform.
you're Yeoman Malloy.
you have a microprobe.
I can't believe this.
you're a Questor?
I think Astro Quest is the greatest science fiction show of all time.
I'm a Commander Bishop fan myself.
who isn't?
why Malloy?
I loved her. I mean, I know that she was completely underwritten, but she was the only female biochemist on TV and I liked her spunk.
do you think that, um, I got the collar right?
cause I think on the show that it might've been a little more, um, swoopy.
you... It looks perfect.
Thanks.
can I see that?
that's great.
I don't speak Vellikon.
what did you say?
security to Room 21-B immediately. - Oh, my God, Jon?
security, 21-B immediately... - Jon?
we need medical personnel in 21-B. - Jon?
medical personnel in 21-B. - Jon? Jon? Wake up!
what is the matter with you?
Oh, my God. Speak to me! Jon?
Jon? - Excuse me.
wake up! Wake up! - Please, everyone stay calm and stay back.
we're with the Crime Lab. - Ma'am, don't touch anything. Don't...
Jon! - Please, come with me.
Jon. - Come with me. Come with me.
brass. - Yeah, it's Hodges.
who?
from Trace, we have a situation at the "What if it" con.
the What if it-what? How'd you get this number?
I cloned Grissom's cell phone on a work-related matter.
that's not important now. We have a situation.
it's one of the exhibitors. - Could you be more specific?
he's dead, Jim.
jonathan Danson, 36, from Chowchilla, California.
about 42 bucks and a couple of credit cards.
so, it probably wasn't a robbery.
bloody nose, scratches on the face.
this guy's been in a fight or something.
you know, if there was a struggle it'd be really hard to tell on a set like this.
liver temp was 89. 7 degrees.
he probably died between midnight and 3: 00 a. m.
so, between then and now there's probably been a few thousand people with access to this booth.
you're going to need a lot of tape lifts.
and swabs.
or... I could run a vacuum cleaner over the whole scene, get exemplars from all these folks and keep you two knuckleheads busy for the next few months.
how'd that be?
do me a favor: beam yourselves back to the lab and let us do our job, please.
okay. - Thank you.
nice outfit. - I just can't believe it.
I mean, this-this project was Jonathan's dream.
we were so close.
so close to what?
he spent five years on this pilot.
it's a remake of the original "Astro Quest."
an executive from Paramount approached us about it
turning it into a full-on series for the CW.
Oh, yeah, really? No kidding.
produced by Jonathan Danson and Melinda Carver.
so, do you have a financial interest in the project?
well, yeah, I financed it.
so, what happens to the rights with Jonathan out of the picture?
they revert to me, I guess.
what are you getting at?
exactly what you think I am.
a guy in a red shirt dies at the beginning of most "Astro Quest" episodes.
I remember.
come on in.
Thanks. - Take a look.
perimortem bruise on the neck.
and a...
right-angled laceration at the base of the nostrils.
the skin appears to be split, not cut.
there's metallic trace in the wound.
you and Wendy always go to "What if it" con together?
actually, it was our first.
pleasure working with you, Yeoman. As always.
tell me something, Commander.
were you scared?
I wasn't before.
but I am now.
but you're my commanding officer.
I'm also a man.
with a man's needs.
if you only knew how many nights I lay awake dreaming of a moment like this.
I can guess.
Hodges, you forgot this. GCMS, chop-chop.
my name is Jonathan Danson, and I'm here to set you free.
free from a vision of an antiseptic future filled with...
with heroes and heroines who are always steadfast and well-adjusted and altruistic.
when was this taken?
last night, special preview event.
anything interesting happens at a sci-fi convention, it's online somewhere about five seconds later.
like most of you, I grew up with "Astro Quest."
every Thursday night my dad would gather the family around our TV to watch the latest episode.
I loved it.
but the older I got, the more the mythology began to eat away at my soul.
I couldn't measure up to the brave crew of that perfect ship.
I wasn't handsome, courageous, strong.
I was weak, petty, self-destructive.
and I hated myself for it. But then...
one night... it hit me like a... like a bolt of lightning.
I looked around the bar at the other frightened, sad people and I...
and I said to myself,"Do you see an Artemis Bishop here?
do you see one at work? - What's this?
he's showing Redux. - Uh, in your apartment building or on the street?
people, look around you.
do you see an Artemis Bishop anywhere?
of course not.
because he's a fictional construct.
a phantom who whispers, "You are not enough."
well, I am here to show you who we really are.
ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Astro Quest: Redux.
I swear to God I'm gonna do her!
Garth, you know me. Just stand down.
I don't know anything anymore!
I'm gonna do her. I swear I'm gonna do her!
commander... - Okay, Sally, everything's gonna be all right.
nothing's ever gonna be all right again! Do you see that?
and now, you're gonna do what I want, too.
you suck. You don't have the...
do you get it?
we're not gonna watch that crap! Get outta here!
so let me get this straight.
some nerd takes a cheesy,'60s sci-fi show and turns it into something a little bit more realistic
minus the spaceship, of course
and the other nerds get pissed off enough that they beat him up and kill him over it?
well... people don't like it when you mess with their heroes.
you got something, Riley?
no sign of blood.
I doubt it's the murder weapon.
are we going to have to figure out how many Dumpsters 3, 000 people can fill in three days?
boy, I hope not.
I got a... whole lot of geek love on the command chair.
isn't that nice for them?
I just found A/V central.
DVD player, sound gear.
and the vic's laptop.
there's a DVD in the player.
according to Article 13 of the Planetary Alliance Charter, we find Jonathan Danson guilty of high treason.
this wasn't part of the presentation.
and the penalty is...
please! No! I'm sorry!
I won't ever do it again!
don't kill me, please!
I got to start watching this show.
SiC Semper Tradi torae. Death to traitors.
yeah?
uh, Catherine, um, hypothetically, if I knew of someone in the lab having a relationship...
what kind of a relationship?
personal. Affectionate. - Romantic?
okay.
um, hypothetically, if I knew of someone in the lab having a romantic relationship...
would I be obligated to report them?
Yes. To Ecklie.
and, hypothetically, would they suffer consequences?
are they hypothetically on the same shift? - Yes.
Supervisor-subordinate? - No.
well, one of them would have to change shifts, but other than that, they should be fine.
just tell them to report it to Ecklie and to go for it.
life's too short, right?
so what's a college professor doing taping the debut of "Astro Quest: Redux" in a science fiction convention?
I was there with my crew.
I'm making a documentary on the gestalt constructs of sci-fi mytho-cultures.
Really? Have a seat. - Thank you.
I wanted to talk to you about your video.
the crowd didn't seem to like Danson's new take on their old mythology.
Danson was a provocateur.
I actually loved his boldness. But he was playing with fire.
you believe one of these people killed him?
would you believe it?
to its fans, Astro Questis more than just a television show.
it's a religion. When he screened his Redux, that was the sci-fi equivalent of Martin Luther nailing his "95 Thes
to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg.
that's keeping it in perspective.
people kill each other all the time over belief systems, mr. Sanders.
or perhaps you're not familiar with the Middle East.
C. O.D. was cerebral hemorrhage due to blunt-force trauma.
sharp blow to the nasal bone snapped the nasofrontal suture, driving it into the frontal sinus, where a secondary fracture penetrated the frontal lobe.
instant unconsciousness.
he was dead within minutes.
any idea what hit him?
something angular, silver-colored. We haven't found the murder weapon yet.
uh, David, would you finish stitching him up, please?
I'm not a seamstress. I'm a coroner's investigator, damn it.
he's been doing that all day.
he's riffing Corpsman Scully's one-liners from "Astro Quest."
didn't watch it much.
because you're not a couch potato. You're a medical examiner, damn it.
well, he was obviously in some kind of struggle.
what do you make of this contusion here?
it's on a pressure point.
maybe someone attempted a sleeper hold.
you mean like a Sethlan submission claw? That's real?
well, you tell me.
okay!
there was something odd in the stomach contents.
take a whiff.
what are these, um, vermiform chunks of meat?
those are Vellikon skullworms, which would of course explain the Tijillian ale.
it's "Astro Quest" food.
some of the bars and restaurants around the convention do that sort of stuff for the conventioneers.
that hurt. - Good.
his name is Jonathan Danson. You recognize him?
Yeah. Yeah, he was in here that night.
and he wasn't a happy camper.
he'd been alone at the bar knocking back drinks when this "Astro Quest" girl comes up.
Yeah, another Vapor, please.
he started jocking her pretty hard.
no, thank you.
no? - Could you please let go of me now? Please.
her friends didn't like that.
sir, you just need to let go of my commander.
everything will be okay. Sir, please. - Let go!
Hey, stop that! - You have no respect!
get him!
first off, we abhor violence.
that's the first thing wrong with your entire show!
Yeah, now-- see how it feels?
I'm not down with violence.
so I put an end to it.
any of those people in these photos?
Yeah, these three right here.
you didn't happen to get any names, did you?
no. Sorry. After the fight they all split.
well, there's nothing worse than a bunch of drunk conventioneers.
must be hard enough to sling drinks without making you play dress-up.
how do you like this makeup?
got it on my second tour of Afghanistan.
these "Astro Questors," they believe in a future where human beings, they transcend their differences.
I wouldn't mind living in a world like that.
Yeah, me either.
you better be careful. That thing gave me a nasty little shock.
well, of course it did. This is the...
compliance yoke from "The Slavers of Sirenodon."
it's a classic. - I know, right?
so, the commander and his crew are basically forced into hard labor, right? By the planet's...
disembodied rulers. - Disembodied, yeah.
and they make everybody wear one of these things around their necks.
Yeah, and if they don't follow orders, then they get zapped with this paralyzing pain.
Hodges! You don't have gloves on. It hasn't been processed.
sorry. - Don't make me use this.
what, if anything else, did you do growing up?
sneer if you wish, but science fiction has been the inspiration for many great technological breakthroughs.
I'm not knocking it. I love sci-fi.
you know, specially that talking horse show. That was one of my favorites.
"Mr. Ed"? - Yeah.
Yeah. That's not science fiction.
sure, it is. It postulates an alternate universe in which horses evolve a larynx.
no. See, that's fantasy.
no, fantasy is anything that travels faster than the speed of light, Hodges.
which is why if Albert Einstein were alive today, he'd slap your face.
I wasn't born to be a slave.
is this what we're supposed to do for the rest of our lives?
Yes.
the supervisors assign us the tasks we are to perform.
yours is to collect carbonite rocks.
mine is to ensure that you collect carbonite rocks.
I'm sick of picking up rocks!
rest if you wish.
what I wish...
is to be free.
on my planet we choose where we go, what to do, who to love.
what is... love?
on my planet, love is the single most important thing that can happen between sentient beings.
Oh, you mean mating.
when the time comes to increase the staff, my supervisor will approve a mate for me.
wouldn't you like to choose your own mate?
wouldn't you like that?
such talk is not permitted in the workplace.
wouldn't you like...just once...
to choose for yourself?
No!
No!
Catherine said it would be all right.
that Ecklie wouldn't have any problem with it.
Hey, Hodges.
No!
yes?
I got work hits off both sets of those prints from that DVD, and they are locals.
well, sort of. They're from Pahrump.
how do you do, ma'am?
I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
we're looking for Lionel Rose and Steuben Lorenz.
they're upstairs.
where else?
mom, not now. I told you we're debriefing.
red alert.
Yeah, we made it.
it was a joke.
of course, humor is subjective.
so, when Jonathan Danson found you sabotaging his life's work, did he subjectively kick your ass?
what the hell are you guys doing here?
what...
don't touch that!
no, no, that's not true.
he kicked our asses before, at the bar.
you see, I adopted a Gandhi-esque strategy of passive resistance to force the aggressor to recognize the immorality of his actions, while Lionel attempted to avoid confrontation like an inferior male baboon who presents his rump for the dominant male to mount.
unfortunately...
Danson proved ignorant of baboon body language.
we-we didn't even go to the convention hall that night.
we sent her: Risa.
I didn't think it was a good idea.
I mean, she's always been really unstable.
did you deliver thpayload?
Yeah, I guess, but there were...complications.
complications, like what?
did someone see you?
if you did anything to compromise the safety of this crew...
there is no crew!
this isn't a spaceship!
I'm done playing your stupid games.
where do we find her?
I have no idea.
she's always been quite unstable.
I just got the results back from the command chair, and it's the victim, plus an unknown female, so we're closing in.
great.
Hey, also, I was thinking that maybe after shift, it would be kind of fun to have a little "Astro Quest" mini-marathon.
like maybe "Yesterday's Tomorrow," parts 1, 2,and 3?
Oh, yes.
it's great.
Yeah, count me in.
good.
Hey, uh, I'll even spring for pizza if it's not too much of a crowd.
well, two is not much of a crowd, really, so...
you mean just you and me?
Yeah.
you, me, the Blu-Ray DVD box set and a brand-new plasma TV.
over at your place?
Yeah. That's where I keep my TV.
okay, sounds good.
Yeah, it will be.
have you ever actually seen one?
I mean, have you ever actually seen one...in the flesh?
a Tijillian concubine.
Feral...
carnal...
voracious.
I'd say she was worth a change in shift.
wouldn't you?
you're on fire.
Hodges, you're on fire!
what happened?
I was checking the unknown's solubility in acetone, when I guess it caught on fire.
my mind wandered.
that's been happening a lot lately, Hodges.
what's going on with you?
there's nothing going on.
this is a crime lab, not some Tijillian casbah.
excuse me?
you, me, a DVD...I don't think it's going to help us catch a killer.
are you actually trying to blame all this on me?
not in so many words.
okay, you know what?
I asked you to come over and watch a DVD-- that's it
so if you're having some fantasies about me dressed up in a tinfoil bikini, dancing around in a casbah on a strange alien planet, then...good.
good?
Yes, good, 'cause it means you're not as oblivious as everyone around here seems to think you are.
but the fact is, if you can't handle the way...
if you can't handle the way that those fantasies make you feel, don't turn all that around and blame me when you screw up.
don't worry about it. It's not gonna happen again.
well, that's not the only thing that's not gonna happen.
fine. - Fine.
Yeah, she, uh, wandered into the bar a couple hours ago.
totally strung out.
right.
put a little caffeine in her, a little conversation, and she was willing to come in and do the right thing.
Okay...thanks.
no problem. Hey, you know, um...
they were giving these away at the convention.
you should check it out.
you might like it.
Thanks.
miss Parvess?
my name is Nick Stokes.
I'm with the crime lab.
I really appreciate you...coming down here to talk with me.
okay, I'm going to make this real easy for you.
I know that Jonathan Danson harassed you in the bar.
and I know you were in the booth that night planting your pals' DVD.
I also found evidence of sexual activity on the command chair.
now, listen.
if he assaulted you in any way and you fought back, that's self-defense.
you know that, right?
it wasn't self-defense.
I liked his show.
I think he must have been able to sense that when he saw me at the bar.
I used to be just like you.
tormented by impulses I thought were dirty.
desires that have no place in a squeaky-clean universe.
let go of me. - Let go of yourself.
stop trying to be something you're not, and the guilt that's eating you alive will fall away.
let me set you free.
he took me...to an incredible place.
no preconceptions or judgments.
Just...pure impulse and...raw instincts.
he showed me who I really was.
he even gave me his cell phone number.
he said he was going to take me to Cabo.
well, I'd say that confirms at least part of her story.
where did you get this?
found it on the vic's laptop.
he has quite a collection.
and that's Melinda Carver, his producer.
that's about seven hours before Risa, just before the VIP premiere of his show.
it's good to be the commander.
so, what's the point?
the point is that you didn't tell me that you were banging the dead guy.
that had nothing to do with this.
and you didn't tell me you emptied out your 401 and gave all the money to Danson.
we checked his bank records.
he needed it to complete the project.
right. He's beenompleting a lot of projects lately.
and according to the GPS tags on those photographs, he's been working his mojo at most major sci-fi conventions in America.
he's a busy guy.
I knew about the other women, because Jon told me about them.
we had, uh, an open relationship.
Look...Jon was an extremely...complicated human being.
he was trying to expose the hypocrisy of a sick society.
he was a real artist, and that's all that mattered to me, not who he was poking in that chair.
that's a nice speech.
I'm done talking to you.
and that's a nice purse.
I'm gonna have to hang on to that.
check it for blood.
be my guest.
the weird thing about these photos is the camera angle and the background never change.
which means there must be a hidden camera on the set somewhere?
may I? - Yeah.
every shot, the victim's hand is on that button.
it must be some kind of trigger.
you didn't notice a camera?
no, I didn't, but, I mean, they make them pretty small these days.
some of them even have built-in memory.
in other words, if we find it, we may have a photo of our killer.
the background in the photo is this point here.
the beam needs to line up with the left arm of the chair.
bring it up a bit.
a little bit more.
perfect.
the camera should be somewhere along this beam.
I don't see any camera here.
maybe Danson had a voyeur buddy take the sex pics.
hmm, from the same exact angle every time?
I think I've got it.
got what?
the metallic trace from the victim's wound.
okay, give me a second.
does this remind you of anything?
Yes.
right? - Yes.
it's Hodges and Wendy.
what do you got?
Yeah, uh, we know what killed Danson.
it's in the helm.
okay, I'm going to put you on speaker.
now, it's, it's in the what?
it's the console that's directly opposite the command chair.
there's a retractable viewer inside.
it's from the show.
looks like some kind of piston system.
Yeah, th-there should be a control for it someplace.
it's called a targeting scanner.
I think we have it.
we also have a digital sex camera.
and blood, 90-degree angle.
silver metal paint and a bloody fingerprint.
nice work, people.
see you back at the lab.
nice work, Hodges.
you, too, Simms.
is she mad at you again?
why don't you two just get it over with?
you've been dancing around it for years.
just tell her how you feel.
tell her what, Mr. Andrews?
that I'd never be able to give myself to her fully?
because I've made a commitment...to this lab.
the pursuit of justice.
do you think it's easy?
in the dead of night,
I can't help but wonder what it'd be like to savor the pleasures of ordinary men.
moonlit dinners.
murmured endearments.
the caress of a woman's soft skin.
long, languid walks on the beach.
but you hate the beach.
it's understandable, I guess, considering your complexion.
what?
it's good that you're politically active because if you weren't, you wouldn't have been arrested at that sit-in at Global Media six years ago.
caught in the web of the combine.
that's a reference to "One Fl..."
Yeah, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." I know.
and I also know that you didn't mean to kill Jonathan Danson.
I know that.
it happened.
but this is your one chance to get out in front of it, so tell me what happened.
just tell me the truth, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.
I will.
jonathan Danson took my media semiotics course.
he was a good student.
I heard about his project and thought it would be perfect material for my documentary.
but then I saw Redux.
I'm gonna do her! I swear I'm gonna do her!
I gave a lecture once, deconstructing "Astro Quest" as an example.
jonathan had integrated all of my conceits into his fictional construct.
he stole your idea.
he didn't ask for permission.
he, he didn't even acknowledge me in the credits.
you want credit?
now, why would I give you that?
because they're my ideas.
whatever happened to "Nobody can own an idea"?
let me tell you something. Ideas are a dime a dozen.
if you want to make them into art, it takes drive, vision, creativity.
Hey, I have created...
what? Hyperintellectual diarrhea?
go back to writing theory papers for the six other people in your department who read them.
I've got a TV show to make.
you! You!
let me go!
not until you cool down.
you gonna be cool?
Yes.
20 years devoted to media theory.
talk about a wasted life.
you see the irony, don't you?
jon attempted to deconstruct Astro Quest's iconography, and he was killed by one of the signifiers he sought to subvert.
Derrida, Derrida would have called that...
an epistemological dichotomy?
I just call it second-degree murder.
anybody up for a little "Astro Quest"?
Oh, no, not tonight.
Thanks, though.
all right.
break room in five.
let's go.
uh, no, thanks.
enjoy.
a Dollop of Apocalypse.
Oh, that's the one where they find this planet where, um, amphibians are the dominant species, and they worship Peyton Place as a sacred text.
it's classic.
w- Wait, the amphibians can read and they choose that?
there's a reason for it.
you'll see.
I don't speak Vellikon.
What'd you say?
we were made for each other
anytime you're ready, Ecklie.
you will leave me...now?
the lab needs me.
you have needs of your own, as do I.
maybe someday our needs will coincide.
I hope so.
until then...
someday.
Mr. and Mrs. Decomp?
till death do they centrifuge.
Yeah, I do know how to read a calendar.
I know when you're due in court.
I just have a backlog of my own here.
well, when Riley left, it just kind of took us all by surprise.
she just left us with a hundred open cases, and we're shorthanded.
but I'll get to yours as soon as I can.
what is this for?
I am training myself to...
identify different knife wounds.
do you know how much ballistics gel costs?
don't worry. I'm gonna melt it down and reuse it.
you've had quite the busy summer.
advanced Non-Invasive Tissue Imaging." "Raman Microspectroscopy.
you're already two courses over your training allotment for the whole year.
Yes, which is why I paid for them myself, and...
took my vacation time... to do them.
I know. I like the attitude.
you're now officially a CSI-2. Congratulations.
well, this one'll put you off driving for a while.
we've got one fatality, and another circling the drain.
the driver of the SUV's from L. A.-- prior DUI.
why the red flag?
Yeah, it's a lot of press for a traffic accident.
they're here for her.
Oh, man! That's Olivia Hamilton.
the actress? - Yeah.
I just saw her in that pool hustler movie with Robert Downey, Jr.
I liked her.
No! No! Move! Move! Olivia!
Olivia! No! I have to see her!
no traffic cameras.
typical for this part of town.
what is it, Ray?
pulverized rubber. Tire dust.
the driver of the SUV kept his foot on the gas after he crashed into the other vehicle.
we got a pulse. This is one lucky son of a gun.
let's get him out of here stat.
looks we may have an eyewitness.
that should add to the circus.
doesn't really matter what he has to say.
everything we need to know...
is right here in front of us.
I'm still learning. About myself, my craft.
I guess with every new role, I try and stretch myself a little bit more because...
I think the minute you stop learning... you're dead.
there's no scoring and no horizontal scrape marks on her car.
Hey, come on, people! Stay back! - Back behind the line!
and there are none on the bumper of the SUV, so...
she was stopped when he hit her.
these yaw marks indicate a gradual turn through the intersection.
there's no fresh braking marks, man.
this SUV didn't even try to stop.
maybe he passed out, lost control of the vehicle.
if he did that, then how'd he keep his foot on the gas?
busy morning.
we've got a possible 420 at a weekly on...
boulder Highway. Greg, you take it.
are you serious?
you're sending me on a trash run to a fleabag motel?
what's the problem? - Why me?
I mean, there are people here with less seniority.
present and accounted for. - It's all right.
I'm happy to do it. - No, no, that's not the point, Ray.
when your supervisor assigns you a case, you don't whine about it, you take it; he knows that.
who asked you? - Nick, I need you over here.
you know better than that.
Greg, why don't you go around the other side of the vehicle. - Fine.
captain, I'm Tom O'Neill. I handle Denny's security when he's here in the States.
I know who you are.
you mind waiting outside?
actually, I'd prefer to stay with my client.
it won't take long.
so, uh, Denny...
looks like you hit it pretty hard at the club last night.
you want something for that hangover?
coffee, water, or anything?
you want to tell me what Olivia was doing on that road at 4: 00 in the morning?
she was on her way to the set.
she was making a movie.
I see.
Olivia and I, we've been together, it would've been a year this weekend.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.
you know, if there's something we can do...
you can put a bullet in the head of the guy who killed her.
Mr. Ocampo, let me give you some advice, okay?
your father owns a casino.
he probably has a lot of enemies, so do yourself a favor:
don't make statements like that in public.
it'll only come back to hurt you.
the film world is reeling from the untimely death of Olivia Hamilton.
her life was cut short by a car crash early this morning.
it happened on an otherwise empty street, and the lack of eyewitnesses is slowing down the police investigation.
one cannot overestimate...
it sucks, doesn't it? - Yeah.
no wallet, no I. D.
was probably robbed after the murder.
he's been dead two days, minimum.
half the department gets to work a dead hot movie star in front of the national media, but we end up on the wrong side of town in a scumbag incubator that's good for at least a couple of these every week, - wasting our time on a... - On what?
whoever would do this is worth getting off the street.
don't you think? - Yeah. Definitely.
sorry.
seven Hills Mortuary?
Yep, this one's yours.
that's quite the ghoulish hobby you got there, Doc.
I'm quite the ghoul.
she had a bit part in a Sex and the City I saw.
even then, I could tell she was going to be a star.
well, now, she'll never grow old.
C. O.D. was internal hemorrhage from a transection of the descending aorta.
classic for a side impact.
tox? - Preliminary's clean. She was pregnant.
fetus measured 19 millimeters. Eighth week.
that's long enough for her to know. Thank you.
it's just not fair.
a loser like that taking the life of a talented young woman.
I'd be stunned if his BAC came back under point one.
I could smell the booze on his clothes.
is he going to make it?
Ah, he's not dead yet, which is a minor miracle in itself.
his C-2 vertebra was crushed.
hangman's fracture.
classic hyperextension injury.
paramedics said he wasn't wearing his safety belt.
so the airbag probably hit the side of his face, twisting the neck.
and somehow the drunk manages to survive.
heard from some uniforms that you guys had a little dust-up at the scene.
it was just a spirited debate among colleagues.
my team's very passionate about their work.
Yeah, they're also understaffed and have been for a while, which is why I'm adding another CSI to your shift.
Ugh, Conrad. I don't have time to train anybody new.
don't worry. This one's been around the block. You're going to get along just fine.
richard Wilkes had a blood alcohol level of point one-eight;
he also had GHB in his system to the tune of 60 milligrams per liter.
guy obviously liked to party.
copy that.
think it's safe to say his judgment was impaired.
this could be the culprit. Henry...
find out what that is for me, please.
according to the SMDs, Wilkes traveled 3. 2 miles from his last engine stop.
now, how do you drive that far, that wasted, and still stay on the road?
individual tolerances vary.
just ask Keith Richards.
want to take a look at this? - Yes.
dearest Richard, thank you for your letter. "It was so sweet and so real.
love, always, Olivia.
this wasn't some random drunk accidentally slamming into a famous actress.
he was stalking her.
the same information was on Richard Wilkes' computer.
we think he hacked into the film company's virtual production office.
he knew where she was gonna be and when she was gonna be there.
in other words, he ambushed her.
maybe. There are some inconsistencies.
like what?
the duct tape, the rope, the knife we found
all these things suggest that Wilkes was thinking to kidnap Olivia, that he wanted to possess her.
his crashing his car into hers without wearing a seat belt makes it seem like he was suicidal.
the man was intoxicated.
well, celebrity stalkers who kill are driven by an overwhelming desire to achieve fame by murdering someone who's famous.
if he killed himself at the same time as Olivia, he would've missed his chance to bask in the limelight.
all right, look, guys, I got a press conference in an hour, and I'd rather not say something I'll have to backtrack on later on.
did Wilkes intentionally kill Olivia Hamilton?
I'd say so. - I doubt it.
maybe you should cancel the press conference.
well, looks like we got someone who can clear things up.
Richard... Hey, Richard.
my name is Jim Brass. I'm a detective.
do you know why you're here?
I killed Olivia.
Yeah, you did. How'd that happen?
we spoke with the people Olivia works with.
they said you went by the set the day before, asking to see her.
she got you booted off the set.
so you get mad and... you went to an intersection where you knew she would be.
she rolls up, stops at a light.
love always... Olivia.
what?
her letter. She loved herself.
Yeah, right.
this angle is looking straight down Bridger.
unfortunately, the crash site itself is obscured, but I figured, you know, see what we can see.
and where did this come from?
a patrolman noticed a camera on a warehouse about a quarter-mile from the intersection.
okay, this is about the time the accident was reported to 911.
I'll roll it back.
Dr. Langston, these just came for you.
shooting Review Board? - Yeah.
they cleared me.
good. Kill or be killed, Ray.
it's a terrible situation to be in, man. Don't let it bother you.
it hasn't been bothering me.
and that's what's been bothering me.
that's Olivia's car.
that's her, all right. I'll roll it forward.
now she's approaching the intersection at Hasbrook.
damn, if that camera were just a couple feet higher, we could see the crash.
light turns red, she stops at the intersection.
that puts the crash time at 3: 27 a. m.
yeah... but look at all the lights on Bridger.
they're all green, except for hers. - So?
so I know that street pretty well.
those traffic signals are synced.
her light should be green, like the rest of them.
what's the white light on the traffic signal?
that's a confirmation light for a traffic signal preemption.
looks like somebody overrode the normal timing, forcing Olivia's light to turn red.
making her a sitting duck.
Tom O'Neill, Guardian of the Stars?
david Hodges. Uh, w-we met at Lavo.
the CineVegas after-party.
you were parting the seas for Tarantino.
actually, it was, uh, outside of Lavo. I couldn't get past the rope.
next time, you flash this.
that'll get you inside. - Thanks.
always glad to help a brother in blue.
where are we at with Wilkes?
Oh, uh, yeah, he confessed.
but we're not sold on it. Something just doesn't add up.
Denny, you okay?
gentlemen. They're ready downstairs.
sorry, we are really backed up.
the only way anybody could change Olivia's traffic light is with an infrared emitter.
LVPD and fire department emitters are coded for identification.
uncoded emitters are against the law.
D. O.T. records confirm that at 3: 27 a. m., an uncoded MIRT infrared emitter preempted the signal at Bridger and Hasbrook.
if Wilkes was using an illegal emitter, why didn't we find it in his car or at the scene?
what are you thinking, Ray?
I'll tell you if I can prove it.
are you a reporter?
I'm from the crime lab.
I heard there are a lot of reporters out there.
they're all here to talk to me, you know?
everybody wants to talk to me now.
they've even been bothering the poor nurses.
I feel so exploited.
they're not interested in discovering who I really am.
they just want to make money off me.
I watched a segment on TV ...
your O2 sat is very low, Mr. Wilkes.
now you're in perfectly good hands. I am a doctor.
I mean, I was a doctor until I was forced out of my profession.
it was one of those angel of death things, you know?
you see, no one really understood the real me.
would you close your eyes for me?
and try to relax. - Oh, wait a minute.
this will be over in just a moment.
als revealed subcutaneous bruising on Wilkes' torso.
looks like a seat belt injury.
first responder said he wasn't wearing a seat belt.
I know. Look, the bruising runs from his right shoulder to his left hip.
that means Wilkes was in the passenger seat.
he wasn't driving the car.
the real driver crashes into Olivia Hamilton, killing her.
I don't think the crash broke Wilkes' neck.
I think the killer moved a drugged-out Wilkes behind the wheel, then snapped his neck.
killer leaves the scene.
the headline is, "Stalker Kills Actress.
which suggests that the killer knew that Wilkes was a stalker.
well, he certainly picked the right nut job.
even though Wilkes survived, he still confessed to the crime.
can Wilkes corroborate any of this?
Oh, he won't. He's too happy being the new Mark David Chapman.
I really hope you're referring to Richard Wilkes.
I wasn't.
Where'd they get this from? - I don't know. You tell me.
I don't know. - It's your job to know, Catherine.
nobody in this lab should be talking to anybody in the media about an open investigation, let alone one of this profile.
Hey, take it easy, Ecklie. I'm sure she's not the leak.
I can defend myself. - This is a discipline problem, Catherine.
just get a grip on your people.
I'm beginning to think Riley was right about you.
what is that supposed to mean?
you didn't read her exit interview. I put it on your desk.
what? - Just read it.
uh, hi, guys. This a bad time?
nice to meet you, and I look forward to working with you.
Thanks. Me, too.
I'll see you later, yeah? - Yeah.
so let's grab a bite after the shift. - Okay.
what are you doing here?
you tired of being happy and married?
no, Grissom is guest-lecturing at the Sorbonne while we're waiting for our research grant to get funded, and Ecklie called;
he said the team was down a man and he wondered if I could recommend anyone.
and you know, as much as I love Paris, and my French is actually pretty good right now,
I realized I miss you guys.
well, we miss you, too.
so, uh, how's the world treating you?
Oh, you know, still being treated like the lab tech with the crazy hair.
there poor
it has ten percent of the FDA's daily requirement for vitamin C.
if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.
Hodges, who did you blab to?
nobody in the media, but I did mention something to Tom O'Neill.
but only in passing and implicitly in confidence.
I would point out that I had not been explicitly forbidden from discussing the case with law enforcement community.
uh, memo from my supervisor to that effect would have been helpful, not that I'm blaming you.
don't ever do anything like that ever again. - Thank you.
I know Richard Wilkes stayed here. You remember him?
uh, you know, I guess I recognize him.
you know, he looks like a lot of guys that stay here.
sir, please, it's important. Think a little bit harder.
are you sure you didn't see him with anybody else?
no. All I can say for sure is that he checked out two nights ago around midnight.
paid cash. - All right, thanks.
eye-in-the-sky guys delivered some surveillance video.
good. 'Cause the manager confirmed Wilkes stayed here, but that's about it.
Hey, looks like he managed to make himself a friend.
is that...
that's Tom O'Neill.
talking to Olivia Hamilton's stalker a little over three hours before she died.
it's funny he didn't manage to mention that to anybody.
little lie, big lie. What if O'Neill was the driver?
if O'Neill was driving, then how come he didn't get so much as a scratch from the airbag opening up in his face?
well, rolling the dice. That's a, that's a different way to grieve.
he has the right to grieve any way he wants.
now if there's any more questions... - Actually, I have questions for you.
sure, no problem. Hang in there, kid.
did you know that Olivia was pregnant?
Yes. - You didn't mention that before.
it's none of your business.
we spoke to Olivia's production office, and they told us that you would ride to the set with her nearly every morning.
why not that morning?
I wish I had.
I was gonna give her this.
when I heard about the incident on Olivia's set, I put a tail on Wilkes.
I found where he was staying.
Olivia Hamilton wasn't your client.
a threat to her was a threat to Denny.
so I went and had a little chat with Wilkes.
if you don't leave Olivia Hamilton alone,
I'm gonna go to that aerospace plant where you polish the floors and I'm gonna show Mr. Segal.
that's right. I know your boss's name.
I'll show Mr. Segal my card, and I'll tell him to fire you.
he'll ask me why.
and I'll say because you're a stalker and a psycho.
and then he'll fire you.
then I'll go to my cop friends, and I'll get a restraining order.
and when you violate it-- because sooner or later you will
I'm gonna throw your ass in jail.
I impressed him with my sincerity, and he agreed to leave town.
I walked him back to his room.
I helped him pack, and I put him in his car and I followed him to the I-15 on-ramp.
watched him get back on the road to L. A.
apparently not for long.
you can understand why I didn't tell you all this before.
no, I understand. You lean on a guy, the guy flips out, kills your client's girlfriend.
that can't look good on your resum?
I-I couldn't afford the hit. I got six hungry bookies to feed.
Oh, yeah, sure.
what's in the bag?
workout stuff. I was at the gym.
11: 30 at night?
crazy hours I pull, you grab a little cardio whenever you can.
well, let's just see if that's true.
I assume you had a warrant for that?
Oh, sure, we're professionals.
Mr. O'Neill, I have to say that your hotel suite was very impressive.
the Ocampo family clearly values your services.
now why are you carrying around this helmet?
I use that for a tactical driving course I teach.
and can you tell me what that white powdery substance is?
we are testing it, of course.
here's my prediction.
it's airbag dust.
tactical driving, you bump into things. Airbags go off.
they also go off when you ram a young woman's car and crush her to death.
now, maybe Denny loved Olivia. I don't know.
but I bet his father in Macao didn't.
not with Denny's record.
another pregnant bimbo, another multimillion-dollar settlement.
Mr. Ocampo, who pays your salary, who finances your...
flamboyant.
lifestyle, I think he asked you to find a more cost-effective way of dealing with the situation, and so you did.
too bad for you Wilkes already confessed.
I want a lawyer.
Hodges confirmed that the dust we found in the helmet was airbag talc.
which only puts O'Neill in half of all cars with airbags.
he's guilty, Catherine.
okay, how are we gonna prove it?
I don't know yet, but we will.
I like his attitude.
reminds you of you?
I checked companies that sell Murray emitters against O'Neill's credit card statements.
no joy. He could have his own emitter. The old ones aren't coded.
so what's next?
Sara, I know that you walked into some fireworks in the break room.
what, Ecklie? Please.
no, I just read Riley's exit interview.
she had some harsh things to say about my leadership;
that the team's fractured;
that it lacks cohesion because of me because of my managerial style.
I don't know. I-I admit it.
I admit that things are different since Grissom left.
well... it's like...
when a great baseball team loses its clean-up hitter, suddenly everybody's swinging for the fences and nobody's playing small ball.
you're using a baseball analogy.
apparently, part of being married is attempting to share in your spouse's interests.
okay. That's a weird side of you.
I know.
look, you still have a lot of great players and some new talent.
maybe you just need to reshuffle your lineup.
english, please.
you are a great CSI, Catherine, and you know how to manage your team.
the only thing Grissom had that you don't...
is you.
Oh, God.
Hello? Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, hey, stop!
what the hell is going on here?
security!
security!
you okay? - You okay?
on you feet.
settle down!
the doctor said both of our people are stable.
good.
okay, I got the van's plate number out on broadcast and Ecklie's handling the press.
any idea who they were?
well, they're not morticians, no matter what their IDs say, and these...
are Russian mob tattoos.
which means we're going to get a lot more out of him than we will out of any of the survivors.
the IDs looked legit so the security guard let them in through the loading dock.
they snatched the body. When they tried to leave the same way they came in, they found the doors blocked by a double-parked truck.
so they found another way out, okay.
but why risk breaking into a lab filled with cops to steal Olivia Hamilton's body?
they didn't take Olivia Hamilton.
they took my bum? But we don't even know who he is.
well, clearly they do.
Hey, guys, you're not going to believe this.
the DNA from your John Doe just came back with a parental match to an open case.
that bum is Olivia Hamilton's father.
all units be advised, suspect vehicle in the lab break-in was recovered on Westcroft Drive at mile marker 214, Mount Charleston.
Oh, no. This doesn't look good.
well, so much for Olivia Hamilton's father.
it might not be him.
you, uh, care to rethink that?
according to James Hamilton's medical records, he was a diagnosed schizophrenic prone to violent outbursts.
Olivia Hamilton was his only child, and she did the best she could taking care of him, but he was in and out of institutions and on and off the streets for years.
now from what I can tell, their relationship was never made public.
it's a minor miracle she was able to keep it out of the tabs.
that might have been about to change.
we found these shots on O'Neill's camera.
recovered JPEGs from the SD card.
they were taken in front of the weekly where James Hamilton was living two days before Olivia Hamilton's death.
we got O'Neill's financials.
like we figured, Denny's father, Mr. Moneybags from Macau, pays his salary.
one week ago, O'Neill receives an unusually large deposit
a hundred grand-- wired from an Asian bank.
maybe paying him to break up Denny's latest romance.
O'neill shadows Olivia, trying to dig up some dirt.
follows her to the weekly where she meets up with this very strange old man.
he could be a drug dealer. Who knows?
but it looks like the perfect material to incite a break-up.
so he takes a couple shots of them. - But he's curious.
so he goes to the room to talk to the guy and see what the story is.
Hamilton freaks out.
they fight and O'Neill ends up killing him.
now O'Neill's a murderer-- under stress.
and a delusional stalker provides him with the perfect way to get Olivia out of Denny's life permanently.
it's reasonable. But it's just speculation.
we can't nail O'Neill for either death.
the only reason O'Neill would risk stealing the body is if he believed it could somehow implicate him, which means there has to be evidence on the body or in the body.
James Hamilton swallowed something when O'Neill beat him to death.
Greg found clothing fibers in his teeth.
we're looking for this cufflink.
if O'Neill knew what happened, why not take the body right then and there?
he didn't know, not until he came here and saw James Hamilton's body.
we've been separating metals and inorganics. So...
here, this may be it.
we got him.
Las Vegas Police have arrested Tom O'Neill, a bodyguard often seen protecting the biggest celebrities, including Denny Ocampo.
funny thing is, the father's death was probably an accident.
but Olivia was premeditated.
irritates me that we weren't able to get him for that.
but you know what? We know what he did and so does he, and he can spend the next 20 years of his life dreaming of his perfect crime.
think of it like busting Al Capone for tax evasion.
how did you now he was going to be hungry?
it doesn't really matter.
they go after crickets no matter what.
I think the chirping annoys them.
that's not my spider, dude.
Seriously? - Seriously.
is that... Little Stevie?
Oh, he's been missing for years.
I'll have to let Sara know so she can tell her...
husband. - Husband.
Hey, Nicky. - Yeah.
you got a sec? - Yeah.
what's up?
Oh, something that's long overdue.
I don't tell you enough, Nicky, but I couldn't do this job without you.
okay. Love you too, Catherine.
I am promoting you.
you are now assistant supervisor on grave.
all right. Thanks.
please have these FI reviews on my desk by tomorrow night.
what's up, Doc?
well, just business as usual, I'm delighted to say.
this gentleman has been in the cooler for a couple days.
joseph Bigelow. No known address.
apparently, spent most of his time downtown in the streets.
no signs of trauma.
my guess is his ticker probably decided to call it quits.
what the hell is that?
I was hoping you'd tell me.
killer forgot we're in a drought.
what the hell is that?
well, this didn't occur naturally.
Oh, what tipped you off?
the two half hitches and a bow?
no, the fact that the small intestine is tied around the spleen.
it's red and green and looks like a Christmas present.
all right, the case was in backlog pending autopsy.
joseph Bigelow was found in an alley off of Charleston and Avert.
there were no signs of foul play.
typical dead bum case. Autopsy was pro forma.
I've heard that name before.
well, I bet you've never seen this before.
okay. Not so typical dead bum case. Is that C. O.D?
no, blood vessels are occluded.
he died of natural causes.
myocardial infarct due to atherosclerosis.
I'd have a heart attack, too, if someone did that to me.
intestines show no vital tissue reaction.
no signs of peritonitis.
he was mutilated postmortem.
so, he died, then someone cut into him and gift-wrapped his guts?
only he wasn't cut into.
there are no visible incisions on his body.
one thing's for sure. He didn't do this to himself.
can't I just go? I want to get out of here.
just want ask a few questions, all right? Just a few questions. Okay?
I just want to go home.
how did you know Ryan Lester?
he-he was my boss. - He was your boss. What kind of work do you do?
entertainment. - Entertainment.
so, did you and Ryan have a relationship outside of work?
we hooked up a few times. - Okay...
but that... that was a long time ago. At least a couple of weeks.
all right, so tell me what happened.
I was taking a hot shower. I was gonna go home and study.
Ryan. Not funny. - What?
get out.
the view is "def" better from this angle.
okay, so he got in the shower with you with his clothes on?
Yeah, he was freaky like that.
and there was no fight? There was no struggle?
I've learned to deal with Ryan's "assitude,
as long as I get a fat check at the end of the week.
all right, keep going. What else?
I went into the bedroom to get changed.
Ryan? The power's out again.
I thought he fell or something, so I went in to check on him.
help! Somebody help! Help! Stop!
stop, please help! Help! - Are you all right?
easy, easy... - And if... if that guy hadn't seen me...
then I'd probably be dead, too.
well, you're lucky. You're okay.
now, the CSI is going to want to take your clothes.
you're okay with that, right? - Yeah.
okay, now just wait right here. Stay right there.
uh, Mr. Wincroft?
Wincroft, yes. - Wincroft, right.
okay, so, the CSI's gonna want to take your clothes, too.
you're all right with that, right? - Oh, yeah.
you're the one who called 911?
uh, yeah, I'm the Neighborhood Watch captain.
here, let me give you these. - No, no, no. Keep your shirt on, captain.
we're gonna do it down at the station.
Hey, give me some light here, will you?
Hey, somebody turned the power off.
I think I might've pulled a partial off the main breaker.
I'm turning the power back on now.
what is going on in here?
sorry I'm late.
the freezer is still on the fritz from when those ROC goons tore up the place.
it's not like we can hang a "closed" sign on the door or anything.
Hey, what kind of a house has a sign-in board, man?
I don't know. Where am I going?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry, Super Dave. Follow me.
end of the hallway.
I wonder if the bedroom across the hall has a Webcam, too.
uh, I'm pretty sure it does.
how would you know something like that?
Nick, could I tell you something personal?
maybe.
Mrs. Phillips and I occasionally enjoy a little...
live stimulation to get us in the mood.
what I'm saying is, uh, I'm intimately familiar with this particular bedroom.
I subscribe to the Web site.
well, try and maintain your objectivity.
of course.
after you. - David. I missed your face.
Aw, it's good to see you. - How's your wife?
good. Great. Why? What have you heard?
the, um, back door is broken.
it's probably the killer's entrance and exit point.
looks like a men's size ten to 12.
there's not much detail in these impressions.
not much? There's no detail. It's kind of weird, actually.
maybe his shoes had smooth soles.
or maybe he was doing what we do.
which means he planned this out. - Great.
Hey, guys. We've got a single laceration here, left to right.
sliced the carotid-jugular complex.
this guy didn't cut too deep.
just deep enough, actually.
efficient.
you're in a room, no doors, no windows. How do you get out?
same way you got in.
mm, I heard it this way.
you're in a room with no doors, no windows, there's a chain saw and a table. How do you get out?
I give up.
you cut the table in half with the chain saw.
two halves make a... - "Hole.
out you go. - Brother.
well, whoever did this had to get in and out through a "hole.
well, think it was a natural opening or did he make one?
either way, he had to use an endoscope or a laparoscope.
well... here at the navel, that could be a laparoscopic opening.
Oh, yeah.
internally...
the incision is open, but externally, it's fused.
I don't see any sutures, so probably used surgical glue.
whoever did this had to have access to medical equipment.
a doctor, med student, surgical nurse.
this isn't medicine.
so, I hear you're the Neighborhood Watch captain, is that right?
Yeah. Well, since the I've had to really step up my patrols.
you know, the banks nowadays-- they're selling, and renting out these houses to anyone who has a dime.
Yeah, tell me about it. I got the same problem in my neighborhood.
obviously, I could've done a better job, being that someone was killed.
well, the girl wasn't. She claims you saved her life.
well, I do my best. You know, I pick up my flashlight the minute I come home from work.
good man. Here, have a seat.
Oh, sure.
so, tell me, how well did you know Ryan Lester?
not really. Uh, I mean, I've seen him coming and going.
you know, the Greene family owned that house before him-- good friends
until they lost their jobs and had to foreclose.
Yeah, man, everybody's feeling it.
I'm so underwater in my house, I should be wearing scuba gear in there, you know what I mean?
and neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods anymore. - Yeah.
you know, we even got a peeper in our neighborhood.
Really? - Yeah.
I mean, I haven't seen him yet, but a few of the neighbors, you know, that are left, they said they saw him lurking around.
do you think, uh, anybody could give me description?
well, the minute I get something, you're my first call.
can you hold out your index finger for me, please?
info:
why is your print on the circuit breaker at Ryan's house?
because I'm always turning it back on.
I told that cop earlier-- the lights are always going out.
with all the Webcams, curling irons, and blow-dryers, the thing overloads.
can you hold out your hands for me?
Ryan's too cheap to call an electrician.
did you touch the switch last night?
no. I don't do anything at night except go to my car.
there's a Peeping Tom in the neighborhood.
have you seen him? - No. If I had, he'd have my Mace in his face.
Ryan said he's seen him running from the house.
did Ryan happen to tell you what this peeper looked like?
you ever seen Marilyn Manson?
so, I've been scanning through this Webcam footage for the past couple hours.
it's a tough job. - I manage.
by the way, congrats on your new gig, supervisor.
you deserve it.
Thanks, Greg.
so, the, uh, Webcam girls turn off their cameras at the end of their shift.
so Marnie's camera was off when Ryan bit it.
check this out.
the curtains moved.
I don't see any hands. So, unless it was the AC, what is it? A ghost?
looks like there's something behind the curtain, covering the windows.
probably to keep the light out.
and anybody from looking in. - Not so sure about that.
maybe it is a ghost.
ray. I remember how I know this Bigelow guy.
years ago, I used to catch this lounge act at the Riv.
Joey-- "Joe Joe" Bigelow was always there.
sitting in the back with his dirty tux on, playing air piano to every tune.
the rumor is that he...
he really did play piano for Dean Martin.
all the old-timers knew him.
every day,
Joe Joe would walk from the Nugget to the Mandalay and back again.
just looking for some ivories to tickle, chasing the dream.
I guess he hadn't heard that live piano players went the way of the dollar martini.
well, my point is, is that he was on the streets, sleeping in different alleys, but always within spitting distance of the Strip.
here's Las Vegas Boulevard.
here's where the body was found. - So?
Joe Joe was a Strip snob.
he wouldn't be caught dead west of the 15.
but he was caught dead there.
which suggests that that is where his surgeon works or lives.
it also suggests that... he didn't know Joey.
and that he selected him at random.
now, looks like the peeper jimmied the window open.
cut himself a handy little flap in the cardboard.
Yeah, so he could see the ladies in action.
closed... never really noticed it.
but open... I can see everything.
there's some white trace around the peephole.
kind of looks like makeup.
Marnie Bennett said that the peeper looked like Marilyn Manson.
he wears a lot of makeup.
I'll swab it.
Hey, now what do you see? - Nothing.
he would've had to...
move the curtains to the side to enjoy the show.
which is what we saw on the Webcam.
the old wire hanger through the peephole trick. - Yeah.
and I have a pretty good idea where this old wire hanger came from.
Hey, Jim, this is Charlie-05.
I need a warrant for Diamond Star Cleaners, please, sir.
this is the only household in the development that uses Diamond Star Cleaners.
faith Mason? - Yes.
ma'am, is there anyone else inside?
what's this about?
it's a warrant to search your house.
uh, my son is upstairs. I'll get him.
no, no. That's all right, Mrs. Mason. We'll get him. What's his name?
Craig. - Craig. Okay.
come on, Sara.
Craig! Las Vegas Police.
Craig! Get up! Las Vegas Police!
Craig, come on, buddy! Time to wake up!
don't touch me. - Las Vegas Police. We need you to step outside.
you aren't the police.
Yeah, that's all right, we brought one with us. Get your ass up.
I said get up!
jeepers creepers.
does anybody believe in sunlight in this neighborhood?
Hey, Sara. Ten and a halves.
same size as the shoe impressions at the scene.
I have seen this mask before.
is it from a horror movie or something?
this job is a horror movie.
I don't even watch them anymore.
I think we're in the right place.
what is it? - It's, um...
satanists have been known to collect dead crows, to keep the smell of death around them.
how do you know that? Grissom?
Ozzy Osbourne. I loved Black Sabbath. For a summer.
well, in that case, I guess we're lucky the head's still on it.
Sara. Did Ozzy, uh, say anything about collecting dead bodies?
scary masks. Rubber hands. Arts and crafts.
what's this kid's name again?
as in Judge Mason? Aka Paul Millander.
you're never going to believe who Judge Mason's fingerprints match.
his real name is Paul Millander.
he's a serial killer with a split personality.
this is our best-seller-- even used my own hand for the mold.
I'd like you to meet our son Craig.
you'll be safe now.
Craig Mason is Paul Millander's adopted son.
son of Millander.
nature or nurture-- you choose.
either way, this kid Mason's a freak.
and not very cooperative.
the only thing he hates worse than cops is CSIs.
he even mentioned Grissom's name a few times.
well, then I won't mention that I'm Mrs. Grissom.
Oh, you took his last name? - Uh, no.
uh, turns out we do not have a murder weapon.
according to Wendy, the blood on Craig's straightedge does not belong to Ryan Lester.
well, maybe there was more than one knife.
I'll call Canine, have them meet them at the scene. - Thank you.
my son didn't do anything wrong.
Mrs. Mason, I am only here to collect evidence.
I married a judge.
Craig's father was a judge, not a serial killer.
this is not about Craig's father.
you know damn well it is.
Craig shouldn't be punished for Paul Millander's sins.
I can assure you he will only be punished if he has broken the law.
now, if you'll please excuse me.
I need your clothes and a DNA sample.
look, don't force me to do this the hard way. Can you sit up, please?
I know you've had a hard childhood, and you've probably been scrutinized at every school that you've been to, and to you, I'm just another one of those people who wants to put you under a microscope, but...
just shut up and take my DNA.
Where's he goin'? This is the Mason house. - I don't know!
get that dog back. Get that dog back. Clear it, Mitch.
his throat's slit just like Ryan Lester's.
dried blood, fixed lividity.
been here at least 24 hours.
code four. You're going to want to see this.
the plot thickens.
porn house, drug house.
millander house in between.
they must throw one hell of a block party.
a drug dealer named Kilo, 25.
I compared his neck wound to Ryan Lester's.
they're virtually identical.
both incised wounds about an inch deep.
result of an extremely sharp, thin blade.
but there's something additional with Mr. Kilo.
parallel abrasions on both sides of the incision.
murder weapon was probably a utility knife or box cutter.
if the same weapon was used on both victims, then why didn't we find similar abrasions on Ryan Lester here?
might be a matter of pressure.
killer pressed harder on Mr. Kilo.
he jammed the body of the weapon right up against his neck.
T. O.D.'s?
both men were killed between 10: 00 p. m. and 2: 00 a. m.
I can't tell you who was first.
well, either way, we've got ourselves a spree killer.
this afternoon while investigators were at the scene of the Ryan Lester homicide, a police dog lead them to a second murder victim located several houses down.
police have a suspect in custody related to the murder of Ryan Lester, who was attacked and killed in his own home last night.
officials have not confirmed a connection between the two murders.
and police are asking the public to please contact the Las Vegas Police Department with any...
where are you taking him?
CCDC. Uh, we have evidence placing your son at the scene of the first murder.
for the moment, we're holding him under NRS-200. 603
it's peeping.
did you really do that?
did you look into other people's homes?
Yeah. But I didn't kill anyone.
I was just looking at the girls. That's why they do it.
I just wasn't paying.
mom, just bail me out, okay?
mom? Mom, you-you believe me, don't you?
mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, I didn't do it!
your son's going to need a lawyer.
I'm learning when I can't find you, I should look down here.
this is very difficult.
it's like attempting to tie a cherry stem into a knot with your tongue.
I can do that... after a few drinks.
our Dr. Jekyll has some remarkable surgical skills.
Dr. Jekyll?
whoever mutilated Mr. Bigelow.
what remarkable surgeon steals a dead man off the streets, practices on him, and then dumps him in an alley?
no surgeon I ever met.
you did get permission from the family to use this body for research?
not necessary. Take a look.
I'm hosting a luau later. - Well, don't invite Sara.
and before you put on your grass skirt and put pinkie on a spit, I need you in Layout.
Nick and Sara need some fresh eyes on the Mason case.
okay... Come on, come on, come on...
DNA has come up empty.
there's no sign of either victim on Craig Mason's clothes or shoes.
I did notice some scars on his arms.
I think he was using the straight razor to cut himself.
Hodges analyzed the white trace that was found around the peephole at the Webcam house, and it was a match to Craig's corpse makeup.
so we can put him at the house, but not in the house.
and we have nothing so far that puts him at the drug dealer's house.
we keep looking. His mother hasn't bailed him out yet.
I don't think she's going to.
she had that look in her eye that maybe he did it.
it is classic escalation. From peeper to murderer.
he's a teenager.
there were attractive women coming in and out of that house all the time.
it doesn't seem that sinister to me.
besides, he didn't murder the person that he was peeping.
maybe he saw Ryan Lester as competition.
you know, Lester was intimate with Marnie.
Craig could only watch her from a distance.
all right, say that's true. Then what about the second victim, Cliff Kilo?
extensive criminal record. It's mostly drug related.
why would Mason murder a drug dealer?
did he have drugs in his system? - No. Tox panel came back clean.
and it wasn't about money. I mean, there was cash all over the house.
all right, if...Craig wasn't a ghoul, and if his father hadn't come after Grissom, would you be considering him at all?
and whose hand is this?
it's Millander's. Used his own hand to make the mold.
all right, did Paul Millander's thumbs and forefingers have a congenital malformation?
no.
then this isn't his hand.
Hello, Craig.
my name is Ray. I work at the crime lab.
can I see your hands?
please?
good. Just a moment. Let me just document them.
I'm gonna need your help with a little experiment.
why would I help the crime lab?
who said you'd be helping the crime lab?
you're going to help yourself.
see, Craig, you and I have something in common.
we both have fathers who killed people.
your father was a serial killer? - No. He was a soldier in the Korean War.
he even got a Bronze Star for his work.
that's different. - No, it's not.
see, after the war was over, my father continued to fight.
every once in a while, he would go out to a bar.
not so much to drink, but to pick fights?
I remember one day, he came home, he was very excited.
had a black eye and a fat lip.
was bragging about how he had knocked somebody out.
said he hit the man so hard, the paramedics had to peel him off the floor.
said it was the most fun he'd ever had.
why don't you come over here and cut his throat, Craig? - What?
come on, cut his throat.
don't hold back.
show me how much you're not like your father.
we got a warrant for Craig Mason's medical records. You were right.
he was born with a congenital malformation.
he made a mold of his own hand? Like father, like son.
well, both neck wounds were uniform.
left to right, slightly downward. Take a look at Jell-O Man.
cut's uneven. Shallow. It's almost vertical.
he could have done that on purpose.
well, his anomaly makes it virtually impossible for him to hold a box cutter properly.
I watched him. That was the best he could do.
okay. So, if Craig didn't kill them, who did?
you guys got any evidence outstanding?
Diane, tell the mayor I'm on my way.
you know, I just had to make a little pit stop at the crime lab.
Yeah. Yeah, all right. Thank you.
what do you need, Ray? Crooked?
what are you doing? - Thank you.
you know how hard these things are to tie?
got your text. What's up?
what do you see?
a guy who likes having his picture taken?
he's wearing a bow tie.
Oh, right. When we found the body, he wasn't wearing a tie.
there's no bow tie on the body, not anywhere on the body.
not even in the pockets.
a man who wears a tuxedo every day doesn't forget his bow tie.
so what? Someone took it?
his bow tie's missing.
his intestines are tied into a bow.
that can't be a coincidence.
I think Dr. Jekyll took it as a souvenir.
a souvenir? That's what serial killers do.
Joe Joe died of natural causes.
I have a bad feeling that this is not the last time we're going to see Dr. Jekyll.
and I think next time, he's not gonna be content starting with a dead body.
if Marnie embraced Harvey, then the blood on his shirt would be secondary transfer.
but on Harvey's shirt, there's an additional blood pattern here, across the shoulder, but not on Marnie's.
which means it can't be secondary transfer.
shoulder area, large, discreet drops in a single line.
that is arterial spurt.
Las Vegas Police!
Mr. Wincroft, I need you to step outside.
we have a warrant to search your house.
captain Brass.
here to make sure the neighborhood's safe?
gun!
okay, okay. Harvey, put the gun on the ground.
you know how many times I've called you guys, calling for help?
how many times you told me you couldn't do anything until a crime was committed?
look, next time, you ask for me.
you tell them you want to speak to Jim Brass.
so this Ryan, he buys the Greenes' house for five bucks, then he starts selling Webcam sex out of it.
my daughter's seven.
to see that on her way to school?
okay, call it in-- man with a gun, potential hostage situation.
check around the back. I need you to stay clear.
Jim, we gotta get that family out of there.
Hey, I want to ask you something. Come here.
you know how much money you owe on your house? - What?
you said you could go scuba diving in your house.
Yeah, yeah, uh... I don't know. About 300 grand.
why don't you talk to me, Harvey? - Why don't you take a step back? We're having a conversation.
all right. Okay.
okay, Harvey, I-I'll talk to you, man. What is it?
you know, I own this house outright.
25 years of lifting heavy boxes for World-Send.
I put every cent I made into this house.
you know, I don't have a retirement fund or a life savings.
this house... is all we have.
where I come from, that's the American Dream.
well, my American Dream became kind of a prison, didn't it?
Hey, wait a minute now, Harvey. We're...
we're talking here, remember?
answer me this: Why did you buy this house in the first place?
for my family.
then why are you putting your family in danger?
please, put the gun down. - I told you to stay back!
come on, Harvey. If you love them, let them go.
sweetheart, Daddy needs you to go with the nice man, okay?
daddy, please, no.
just go, okay. - No...
it's okay, honey. I got you. I got you, come on. - No, Daddy, please.
go! - No.
I said go! - Come on. I got you, baby.
it's okay. I got you, baby.
I'll take care of her, Harvey.
why don't you put the gun down and let her mom go, too?
come on, Harvey!
no, Harvey... Don't-don't-don't do it. Don't.
don't do it, Harvey.
don't do it.
I just wanted to protect my family.
soon as you're processed out, you're free to go.
if we made you feel like you were paying for your father's crimes,
I'm sorry.
you know, I never even met Mr. Millander.
yet, I'm more like a Millander than a Mason.
you probably wonder how that happened.
it has crossed my mind.
you see, my father, Doug Mason, took me to the Halloweird warehouse once a month.
he told me that the owner, Mr. Millander, was his friend.
and in there, my father played with me just like any father would play with his son.
Millander's costumes were toys to me.
and I told my father, every time we went, to tell this Mr. Millander that he was a genius.
and then, one day, it all stopped.
I lost both my father...
and my idol.
making masks and rubber hands is my way of keeping the connection alive.
is my mom here to pick me up?
I can give you a lift.
let's go.
see, Craig, you and I have something in common.
we both have fathers who killed people.
your father was a serial killer?
no, he was a soldier in the Korean War.
he even got a Bronze Star for his work.
that's different. - No, it's not.
see, after the war was over, my father continued to fight.
every once in a while, he would go out to a bar.
not so much to drink but to pick fights.
I remember one day he came home, he was very excited.
had a black eye and a fat lip.
he was bragging about how he had knocked somebody out.
he said he hit the man so hard the paramedics had to peel him off the floor.
said it was the most fun he'd ever had.
why don't you come over here and cut his throat, Craig? - What?
come on, cut his throat.
show me how much you're not like your father.
victim's name is Trevor Beck.
Caucasian male, age 17.
five foot, 11.
154 pounds.
senior at sagebrush valley high.
appears to be well nourished and in overall good health,
without any abnormal skin coloring or pigmentation.
there are several light abrasions and contusions on the knuckles of his right hand,
consistent with a recent scuffle.
but there do not appear to be any external wounds consistent with severe trauma.
internal organs appear healthy.
no signs of trauma or disease.
heart muscle is free of scarring and necrosis.
and there's no evidence of any cardiac event.
healthy young men like this
don't simply drop dead for no reason.
I concur, which is why I am still looking.
that is one massive cerebral edema.
the meninges don't appear to be discolored or inflamed,
so I think we can safely rule out meningitis.
did he suffer any blows to the head?
there's no evidence of any injuries to support that.
according to the police report,
he was shoved at school this morning and collapsed.
and even if he sustained a blow during the altercation,
that's not nearly enough time to cause this much swelling.
and what does that leave us with?
drugs? Toxins?
or a prior injury we don't know about.
not yet.
Mrs. Beck, please sit down.
okay. Okay.
just-just a few things I have to ask you, all right?
was trevor injured recently?
Injured"? How?
you know, uh... A bang in the head.
even a little bump? Anything?
no. No, I mean, not that I know of.
brass: No? Was he complaining of, uh, headaches
or blurred vision, nausea-- anything like that?
I-- you mean, he's been a little grumpy lately.
I mean, this morning, he couldn't find his car keys,
and he... He threw a fit.
and then, he realized he'd left them in the car.
but, um, I think that's just 'cause he's,
he's not getting enough sleep, you know?
he's... He's a teenager.
sure. Sure.
sure, we all do that. I understand.
was he in a fight recently?
Trevor doesn't fight.
he's a, um... He was a good kid.
well, even good kids have bad days.
did somebody do something to trevor...
that, that killed him? We can't say anything definitive.
we're just looking at possibilities.
but it would be helpful to have a diary of trevor's comings and goings in the last week.
that would be good.
how do you know anything about a kid at his age? I...
brass: Well, we could ask his friends.
you know, maybe they could help.
Mrs. Beck: He didn't have a lot of friends.
you know, when trevor wasn't doing his schoolwork,
he was, he was working on his car.
you know, he always said that he was going to be an artist.
I mean, I thought that would be like a, you know, a painter or sculptor or something, you know?
not a gearhead.
but he said that a car was art that could move.
he started seeing a girl.
Cindy. About a week ago.
she came home with him last night.
yeah? What time was that?
let's see, they went up to trevor's room about 9: 00.
but, um, there was no sleeping over, so she left
about, uh, 11: 00, I think.
but I-I didn't see her go.
do you have her phone number?
no. I don't.
it's okay. It's all right.
we can find that. That's easy for us.
if you want Cindy,
well, too bad,'cause you can't have her.
you don't look nearly busy enough.
well, thank you.
it is my gift to look relaxed while doing many things.
unlike Hodges,
who has the ability to look overwhelmed
while really doing nothing at all.
I'm waiting on an a. G. Waiver on a cell phone for... Willows: Cindy warner.
it just came through. Start "relaxing.
you got it. Okay.
you know, I heard the victim's brain kind of exploded in his head.
kind of.
what does this girl have to do with that? No one's seen her since the night before trevor beck died.
she lives with her brother,
a construction worker out of town on a job.
I sent some unis over to their apartment
for a welfare check and she wasn't there.
I mean, her boyfriend drops dead in front of the whole school,
and she's nowhere to be found.
that qualifies as suspicious to me.
Oh, okay. Her cell is registered and active at a tower on washington boulevard between oak and maple.
sagebrush valley high.
well, it is a school day.
according to the office,
Cindy was not in her homeroom this morning.
well, according to my daughter,
some kids just go to school to hang out.
never set foot in a classroom.
Oh, I have her schedule.
I will beat the bushes and see what turns up.
Bye.
sorry? This is Cindy warner's locker.
yeah and mine. We share.
Oh, uh, well, I'm Sara Sidle.
I'm with the crime lab. What's your name?
I'm going to need to get in there, renata.
like the teachers say "no expectation of privacy.
so did Cindy do something wrong?
have you seen her today? No.
I mean, not since the other night.
actually, before what happened with trevor.
and I've been texting her like crazy
and Cindy's my biff.
we always talk before bed.
she text you back?
and you're not worried about her at all?
of course I'm worried about her.
her boyfriend, like, died.
but I mean, half the school went home after that
and I figured Cindy did, too.
she just wasn't ready to talk.
and I can't even imagine how she was feeling.
you think cindy Ran away or something?
we don't know.
well, I'm going to be late for class.
Oh, uh, no problem. Go ahead.
but, um, could you do me a favor?
if Cindy does get in touch with you, could you call me please? Sure.
Thanks.
what are you doing here? I called impound for this.
Yeah, they're still sorting out
a multi-car pileup on the 15.
thought I'd save them some trouble.
take care of this one in the field.
nobody mentioned it was electric.
so?
so this is a 1958 porsche speedster.
so?
so, it's a classic.
James Dean had one of these.
putting an electric motor in this is sacrilegious.
not to polar bears.
did you process the interior?
no, no, not yet.
looks like we've got some more blasphemy here. Yeah.
I saw that fresh yellow paint scrape passenger's side door.
already collected for trace. Hmm.
you know, these evs have diagnostic modules up the wazoo. They log range, speed, acceleration,state of charge-- all that stuff.
well, I guess the electric motor's good for us, too.
phenelzine.
antidepressant.
sadly, very popular with the high school set.
got a pink cell here.
Cindy Warner's phone.
they say the only way to get a teenage girl away from her cell phone is to pry it from her cold, dead hand.
well, whoever "they" are, let's hope they're wrong.
Nah, man.
it's after 3: 00.
I'm not a truant. Oh...
wouldn't that be your lucky day?
I'm a homicide detective, man.
how'd you get that shiner?
this'll help.
looks pretty self-explanatory.
boy, I don't know what's going on today,
but everybody's giving me attitude. Hey, you know what?
I'm the victim, man.
you're not the victim when the guy who did that, 17 hours later, ended up dead.
the gentleman in question died at school.
probably bored to death.
so what was your beef with trevor? No beef, man.
amateur got in my face.
I let him slide. A tough guy like you
didn't hit back? Come on.
let who's ever up decide.
you know, for such a man of peace,
you have a funny way of showing it.
you know what I think happened?
I think it all had to do with Cindy Warner.
I'm perplexed.
an educated guy like you?
come on.
Cindy used to be my lady.
then she started keeping his passenger seat warm.
but you never know when history's going to repeat itself - that's the way I saw it.
the way I see it is, uh, you get in a fight with Trevor to win Cindy back, and then Trevor kicked your ass.
17 hours later, he ends up dead and cindy goes missing.
she's missing?
Yeah.
where is she?
if we knew where she was, she wouldn't be missing.
now, where did you go after Trevor decked you?
back here.
look, I swear. Ask my boss.
I was helping with inventory.
when was the last you saw Cindy?
you're looking at it.
stokes: It looks like his brain stem has been jammed into his spine.
essentially it has.
it's a rare condition known as chiari malformation.
it's a deformity of the skull
that displaces the cerebellum and the brain stem into the spinal canal.
most people don't even realize they have it
until they've experienced some kind of trauma
or vigorous neck flexion.
like a blow to the head? Exactly.
if that happens, the condition creates swelling,
edema, resulting in massive intracranial pressure.
the headaches can be excruciating. Willows: According to the mother,Trevor had been irritable.
and wasn't sleeping very well.
it's got to be hard to sleep when your brain's
blowing up in your skull like that, huh?
Trevor was also taking antidepressants, mao inhibitors.
I know they spike blood pressure,
but wouldn't they have worsened the swelling?
Langston: Definitely.
the existing chiari, the antidepressants,
and whatever struck his head,
all combined to create an acute hypertensive crisis
a perfect storm.
so whoever gave him the drugs
was also contributing to his death.
Yes. Willows: We still don't know what hit him or who or where it happened.
well, the diagnostic modules in trevor's franken-porsche
did give us a little something there.
on the night before his last drive from home to school, Trevor drove about 14 miles in the course of an hour and a half without turning his engine off.
that's seven miles out, seven miles back...
seven mile search radius.
and just before he made that trip
is the last time that cindy warner was seen.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
guys, she's pretty messed up.
and it's not just from the tree.
compound fractures of both shins.
a lot of internal injuries.
and her uniform is missing
the skirt, which could suggest sexual assault.
possible body dump.
you know, I haven't seen any blood in the vicinity
or footprints, other than ours.
or any sign of a struggle.
no, if this is a body dump,
and trevor's death was some sort of twisted karmic retribution,
then why didn't he try to hide the body any better than this?
there's no tire treads coming off the road,
no signs of another vehicle even being out here,
much less another person.
it's like she just fell from the sky.
what do you think?
kids head out to the desert for a little sneaky-touchy.
things start getting hot and heavy,
clothing is removed...
then things go terribly, terribly wrong.
definitely wrong.
that is not what happened.
do you see how the tibia is snapped clean?
the x-ray shows the posterior is beveled.
this is a pedestrian fracture.
she was hit by a car.
david said that there was no evidence of that at the scene.
maybe not in the immediate vicinity of the body,
but if you take a car traveling at highway speed
and hit someone just right a girl this size and this weight
she could fly the length of a football field.
we need to widen our search.
there were yaw marks up and down the road,
but no clear tread marks, so I obliquely photographed
areas where I thought tread marks might be
by using a light source at different angles,
different contrast...
each angle revealed portions of otherwise invisible treads.
by layering the shots, I was able to come up with a complete set of tread mark impressions.
very impressive, smarty-pants.
two distinct sets.
both originating in the same general vicinity...
here.
the yellow scrapes and blood on the road appear to be from Cindy's point of impact, which was roughly 1, 300 feet from the starting point.
we found her body 300 feet from where she was hit.
two cars, dead of night,
a girl on a lonely stretch of quarte r-mile straightaway.
this was a drag race.
with Cindy at the finish line in every sense of the word.
the treads on the left are
a thin five-bar tire that's consistent
with the ones on trevor's car.
the treads on the right
are from his mystery opponent.
they're 17-inch, goodyear eagles
with a wheel width of approximately 70 inches.
stokes: A lot of cars on the road today that fit that description.
Hodges was able to I. D. The yellow flakes in Cindy's wounds and the point of impact.
it's flatz uranium number two.
and it is the same paint as the yellow scrape that we found on Trevor's door. Okay, so...
the two cars race, one swipes the other.
the yellow car loses control and takes out cindy.
that would explain why there was no damage to the front-end of trevor's car.
so we're looking for a yellow street racer in las vegas? Great.
that should narrow it down to just a few hundred suspects.
well, maybe trevor's drug dealer can help us out with that.
I tracked the lot number on the phenelzine pack you found.
it's from a local pharmacy. I called the owner.
his son works as a stock boy
and he goes to Trevor's school.
a drug dealer?
me?
do I look like Tony montoya to you?
damn it, Rishi, stop messing around.
that's good advice.
we know that you're dealing.
I never took any cash from trevor.
we were in auto shop together.
he was like a genius, and I have this mental blockage when it comes to things mechanical,
so I exchanged my goods for his services.
tutoring.
all this and you're failing auto shop, too?
that's right, dad!
I'm never going to be an engineer.
strip me of my Indian.
the night before he died...
who was Trevor racing?
no one. Come on.
I'm telling you, Trevor wasn't a racer.
tell the police the truth!
he wasn't a racer!
not as far I know.
that car was like his baby. Well, racing is what a car like that is built for.
we know that Trevor was out in the desert drag racing a yellow car, which killed cindy warner.
do you know somebody with a yellow car?
I don't think you're aware of what's going on here.
the pills that you gave Trevor helped kill him.
no-no-no, he... He asked me for the painkillers.
but that stuff's addictive, so I gave him the uppers.
which are controlled substances.
trafficking them is a felony.
Hey, I'm still a minor.
but your father isn't.
he's responsible for those medications.
and if he's found criminally liable,
he could lose his store.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
rishi, what have you done?
the yellow car...
it's got to be a demon.
they're a gang. Their color's yellow. That's all I know.
I swear.
I'm sorry, dad.
I'm sorry.
brass: The demons have been around for awhile.
they're a legitimate car club, but they've diversified
into distribution of narcotics, chop shops, protection rackets-- things like that.
well, we can't exactly round up every demon in town who's driving a yellow car, can we?
well, maybe we don't have to.
I know where a lot of demons are going to hang out tonight.
street rumble"? That's catchy.
brass says the department sets this thing up to keep racers off the streets.
ten dollars buys anyone into a race,
and it's all legal.
well, it looks like it's working.
Yeah, it does, actually.
well, at least one day a week anyway.
here we go. Check it out.
pretty nice ride you got here.
17-inch rims?
Ooh, look at that.
the lady can appreciate the finer things in life.
nissan 350z.
this is a race car.
you can't keep it caged up. You got to let a canary sing.
ask sergeant jenkins.
this is the ride that beat his ass here last week.
bumper looks a little beat up, though.
this baby's pristine.
you know officer o'malley?
got smoked two weeks ago on las vegas...
on the track.
your old crown vic's just no matchup.
Hey, no disrespect, but any scratches get on that shine,
there's going to be problems, man.
no, there's not.
besides, I was just admiring the color. Weren't you, Sara?
the color is nice. What is it?
uh, flatz uranium number two?
don't know.
is this your car?
I'm watching it for a friend.
what's this about? What's your friend's name?
don't know.
you don't know the guy's name,
but he lets you baby-sit his car? Why is that?
what can I say? I got a trustworthy face.
no, you don't. We're looking for a yellow car in connection with a murder.
Johnnie! We got a runner!
stop, lvpd! Stop now!
step aside! Please!
LVPD! Stop!
get out of the way!
sidle: Back it up! Get down on the ground!
now! Get down. Get your arm back.
get down!
back it up!
maybe in your car you would've had a chance.
you're under arrest. Get him up.
let's go.
what is it, Greg?
I was just thinking about the time I went joyriding.
you? Really?
I was 12.
my papa olaf bought a red 280-zx.
man, it was love at first sight.
and I have no idea what made me think I could get away with it.
but when papa o went down for his afternoon nap,
I swiped the keys and took it for a spin.
Where'd you go?
around the block-- twice.
and when I was rolling it back into the driveway,
I almost ran over my foot.
Papa olaf woke up, had no idea.
he never found out.
Hmm... You're a little car thief.
Yeah, guess I am.
so, listen, Miyamoto lawyered up.
but according to the guys in the gang unit,
he's been involved in stuff like this before.
he got busted in a chop shop raid last summer,
but since he was a juvee,
and not principally involved, they turned him loose.
I'm pretty sure he's involved in this, too.
well, unfortunately, his car isn't.
well, his wheel width matches,
so do the tires.
and Hodges confirmed the paint - flatz uranium number two.
that may be so,
but while at the crime scene,
I collected broken glass associated with the impact.
it turned out to be headlight glass.
these headlights are plastic.
there is no way that this glass came from that car.
is that Trevor?
looks like he was more of a racer than people thought.
where did you get to this?
well, that photo was on Cindy's phone.
it was taken at the winner's circle
of street rumble, so I searched their site
and this came up. It's from nine days ago.
Willows: Check out that paint job on the other car.
yellow flames.
how much do you want to bet it's flatz uranium number two?
Ouch.
he got whiplashed in that spinout.
that's probably what setoff his chiari.
which means that his death was probably an accident.
Yeah.
wait a minute.
that is Renata Clarke.
Cindy Warner's best friend.
so, Trevor smokes Renata in an organized race.
maybe the desert was a rematch.
all right, you hear that light ticking sound?
that's the hot solid lifter cam.
the valves need adjusting.
shut it down. See, if you listen,
your car will tell you everything.
there's no guesswork.
unlike your girlfriend, she'll tell you exactly what she means, but you have to listen, because if you don't, your car's just a noisy heap of metal.
so take care of those valves. Okay, gus.
Hi. Can I help you?
hi there. Mr. Davis? Yes.
we're with the crime lab.
I understand that you're Renata's legal guardian.
I am. I'm her uncle and her shop teacher.
we're going to need to take a look at her car.
sure. Uh, yeah, it's right over here,
only it's not for sale.
Renata? Come on out.
uh, these people want to take a look at the car.
what's this all about, Gus?
I don't know.
no signs of blood spatter or body damage.
even the tires look clean.
but the headlights are glass.
well, the wheel width is right.
there's no way we're off base on this.
maybe we're not.
check it out.
yellow paint overspray.
this area's been recently repaired and repainted.
what are you looking for?
where were you the night that Cindy went missing?
um, I went to giant burger to meet up with some friends for dinner.
when the fries got cold, I came home.
studied calc and fell asleep on my textbook.
true story.
what were you calling Cindy about at 1: 00 in the morning?
around midnight, I woke up, ink on my face and everything.
I watched the gossip girl I dvr'd
and called Cindy to go over the pertinent details.
did you made plans to meet up?
meet up"?
there's no meeting up.
Cindy and I talk every night.
this is nothing out of the ordinary.
wait.
you couldn't possibly think I was there when Cindy...
when Cindy what? You think I killed her?
Cindy was my best friend!
I would never hurt her!
Never! Renata.
what's this all about?
evidence consistent with this car was collected at a crime scene, Mr. Davis.
this vehicle will now be impounded.
impound? What? Because of some stupid measuring tape?
you can't take it!
you can't let them take my car! You don't actually have a choice in the matter.
okay. Fine. Look.
she was at home.
I was with her.
and we're done talking.
okay, you guys are looking for fibers, blood, hair-- any transfer that would confirm
this is the vehicle that struck and killed Cindy Warner, okay?
the suspect hides the murder weapon in plain sight,
in her auto shop class.
that's pretty sophisticated for a high school girl. Right.
she's definitely more sophisticated than the ones you chat with on the twilight message boards.
wait, wait.
so, I'm guessing that about
a million grubby teenagers probably
pawed their way all around this thing.
so how exactly do we put Renata behind the wheel when cindy was killed?
by going over it with a fine-tooth comb.
if we can rule out other drivers,
then we can build a pretty good case. Right.
what if the other driver was wearing gloves?
helping or hindering, Wendy, which one's it going to be?
I am helping.
Attagirl. Thanks.
what do you got there?
kids. Gross.
sidle: There are only two ways to get to the drag where Cindy was killed.
one is an exit off the 95. Mm-hmm.
and the other's a turn off blue diamond road,
which is the way to get there from henderson.
and where both Trevor and Renata live.
is there a traffic camera or video surveillance
at the blue diamond intersection? I am just going to check that out.
good. Pds doing their part.
somebody's bound to get lucky.
this is a 1933 Ford Roadster.
it was involved in a street race that resulted in the death of a teenage girl.
now, we have reason to believe that the street gang known
as the demons aided the driver
by chopping the parts of this car
immediately after the incident.
now, the gang unit has supplied you with a list of the known demon chop shops,
several of which are fronted by legitimate businesses.
now, the job is to locate and recover any and all parts from this vehicle.
and when you do so, give CSI a call.
Cindy warner's sweater made quite the impression on the hood of renata's car.
there was so much kinetic energy transferred in the collision that when the fabric came into contact with the hood, it actually deformed the clear coat and the paint.
after that, she takes the car to the demons
who replace the parts and paint everything to match.
and she pretends the whole thing didn't happen.
were there any other prints
besides hers on the steering wheel?
no. No, we got her as good as we can.
you know, there's one thing that I still don't get.
so, Renata loses to trevor in a legal, organized race,
and then a week later, they have a rematch at an illegal drag in the desert.
why not just wait until the next rumble?
racer mentality runs in her family.
her guardian was on the stock car circuit in the '70s.
made a bit of a name for himself.
back then, guys used to build their own cars
and race them for pink slips.
he obviously passed the bug on to Renata.
uh, guys, we got a problem.
these were taken by a traffic camera
on blue diamond road the night of Cindy's death.
stokes: That's Trevor's porsche
with Renata behind the wheel.
that doesn't make any sense.
it blows up our whole theory.
Trevor wasn't in the desert.
it wasn't a rematch.
so then what -- he let Renata borrow his car
to... What?
race who?
her car was already there.
we're missing something.
okay, but what?
I think I know.
want a piece of gum?
piece of gum, Gus?
we know you didn't race Trevor in the desert, Renata.
finally. It was starting to feel like harassment.
you were racing each other.
we found a wad of chewing gum stuck on the back of the steering wheel of Renata's car.
I know you're a fan of Chuck Yeager's. So am I.
Chuck used to snag a stick of beeman
from his mechanic before he did a test flight.
and then he'd take the gum, right?
and he'd place it right on the cockpit.
so it'd be there on his safe return home.
and I guess that in your racing days, you'd leave
a wad of gum on the steering wheel?
just like chuck.
well, once we match
your dna to that chewing gum,
it's like the checkered flag for us.
so, I chew gum.
Renata and I work together
on that car all the time.
that doesn't prove anything.
the morning that Trevor died,
he couldn't find his car keys,
but he said found them later inside his car.
so I think that you got your bff Cindy to steal the car and bring it out the desert
so you could race it.
and after cindy got killed,
you drove the car back into Trevor's house
and left the keys inside the car.
he...
we, we didn't mean to... We didn't do anything.
and we're leaving.
no, you're not leaving. Well, wait a minute.
actually, you can leave.
but you're going to stay.
you're under arrest.
cuff her. Read her her rights.
charge is felony murder. She were there.
you want to give her a hug, buddy, now's a good time.
no, wait. N-now stop! Renata: It's okay, Gus.
I'm going to be okay. No.
don't.
it's my fault. Don't!
it was my fault.
what the hell happened out there?
that guy's never raced a day in his life
and he beat you?! His car runs like it's on jet fuel. There's no beating that.
you were slow on your gear changes.
if you had the guts of a real racer
you would've beat him! His car is better than ours, Gus.
get over it!
I saw trevor's little toaster all the time in class.
it's not about what's under the hood.
and I had to show Renata that what matters most is the heart behind the wheel.
Cindy was dating Trevor.
I got Renata to convince Cindy to steal trevor's car.
so I could prove my point.
I don't know what came over me.
I just never liked to lose to anyone.
Cindy! Get in the car! Get in the car!
No! We have to find her!
all right, I will, but I want you out of here.
take Trevor's car back and go home.
I tried.
I tried to find her, but I couldn't.
but I felt that hit.
there was nothing I could do for her.
I gave that Miyamoto kid 500 bucks
to make the car like new overnight.
this is on me.
no.
it was my fault.
if I hadn't had Cindy steal Trevor's car,
she never would have been out there in the first place.
you did.
she was.
who won?
Willows: Brass said the d. A.'s
going to charge them both.
stokes: There you go-- two lives ruined,
two dead kids and for what?
so some old-time race car driver could show off?
it's a shame.
when you're young, you think you're immortal.
and when you get older,
you just want to remember how that felt.
driving crazy fast on an open road.
we're not getting that old, are we?
good night, Nicky.
good night, Catherine. I'll see you tomorrow.
you guys, ready?
seven. Yes!
pay it. Pay it.
I already ejected the guest from the show.
you don't need to do anything.
just send him down.
tell him to meet me at the front desk.
what's your floor, honey?
17
who gets thrown out of a lingerie show in Vegas?
I mean, what is the point of having live girls if you can't touch them?
I flew all the way from Omaha.
Hi. - Hey.
well, everybody's getting lucky tonight.
too close.
Where's the setup?
it's in here.
our first suspect, Everett Edwards, decided to bring the party back to the room.
had to get our guys out of there fast.
I passed Greg and Archie in the hall.
they got out of there just in time.
but they didn't finish.
wow, look at this place.
Oh. No bathroom cam.
here's the second suspect, Bellermine Quisk.
these two guys are the biggest suppliers of Ecstasy in the Southwest.
when did they get here?
Everett checked in around 2: 00.
bell, about an hour ago.
since then, it's been all booze and hookers.
well, there's no chemicals or apparatus visible.
probably still in the luggage.
bathroom cam malfunctioned.
tell her we can get a lipstick cam in the tissue box.
just need a little time.
did you hear that? - Yeah.
but I think the boys are in for the night.
okay.
I'll send Archie back to the lab.
I'm gonna stick around in case you need me.
Thanks.
so you get to kick it with the babes in the casino, and I get Hodges at the lab.
Yup.
sorry.
Catherine, I think I got a dead body here.
uh, there's a-a woman down.
Archie, where exactly are you?
the loading dock.
her head's bleeding. Uh...
okay, listen to me. This is what you're going to do.
stay with the body, don't let anybody come or go, and don't touch anything.
got it.
I don't believe this.
we got a 419 down at the loading dock.
well... we can't have a big police presence here.
I'll call it in.
the last thing we need tonight is a crime scene.
her name was Sasha Katsaros.
she was one of our event planners.
outstanding employee.
you know, everybody loved her.
she'd always got that extra mile.
what kind of security do you have in the, uh, employee areas, Mr. Thomas?
call me Finn, please. - Sure.
well, no cameras, but, uh, access is restricted to employees, key card only.
we're gonna need a list of all the employees who were on duty tonight.
Absolutely.
did you see or speak to Miss Katsaros at any point today?
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, the last timeI saw her was at 10: 00 p. m.
all right, Finn, can you tell me, uh, who she was going that extra mile for?
Yes.
his name is Lon Rose.
he's hosting a private lingerie show in the casino.
and I should mention that Sasha sometimes brought angry guests back here to calm them down.
Thanks.
I want everyone behind the crime tape until we finish processing the scene.
anything you need, you know where to find me. - Thank you.
dried blood on the stairs.
it looks like she took a tumble.
Archie said her bodywas still warm?
head of security said he saw her at 10: 00 p. m.
Archie called Catherine at 11: 15.
that gives us a 75-minute window for time of death.
Hey.
he's looking kind of green.
how you doing, man?
first DB's the hardest.
neck feels broken.
she's got a four plus one on the left fore arm.
Yeah, same thing on the other arm.
thumbs on the inside, fingers on the outside.
stop!
whoever grabbed her was facing her.
Hey. I, uh, told Archieto go to the lab and check in his clothes and then head to the station and give his statement.
he's, uh, a little shook up, but he'll be okay.
he did have one unusual observation.
David, can you please confirm if the vic has, uh... gone commando?
sure.
no underwear.
why was he looking up her skirt to begin with?
he was just being thorough.
the killer might have taken the panties as a souvenir, which means this wasn't an accident.
okay.
be sure and collect an SAE kit, huh, Super?
I know. Just make sure that no one enters the casino with vests, radios or uniforms.
we can't have any mistakes.
copy that. How's the stakeout going?
well, so far, it's like watching bad porn.
all right, talk to you later.
keep me in the loop, Nicky. - Will do.
I just don't get these two idiots.
they're born into money.
they graduated good schools. Their daddies paid for it all.
sounds like you've got an issue with rich people.
no.
I got an issue with rich kids killing poor kids.
these guys were in Tahoe last week.
they were peddling bunny tabslaced with DXM.
cough suppressant.
causes hallucinations, inhibits sweating, raises body temperature.
you add E and a hot dance party, you got yourself a heart attack before you're old enough to vote.
and with their background, they probably didn't cut the E to save money.
trying to distinguish their product, make it a stronger trip.
and Bell, his profileis even more disturbing.
this kid, he gets off on anything taboo.
he is a crazy bastard.
and what makes you guys think they cook in hotels?
Tahoe PD found an empty can of ether and some broken glassware in their hotel room, but that's not enough to bust them.
so we got to catch them in the act?
just... not that act.
nothing on surveillance.
did you find anything in the vic's files?
Yes. She noted an incident with an angry guest at the lingerie show, but no details.
well, it's a private show.
there has to be a guest list.
let's get a name.
how do you want to do this?
how do you want to do this?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Cheerleaders are my weakness. - I noticed.
let's find the host of this shindig.
divide and conquer.
Yeah.
excuse me, ma'am.
Hi.
Hi.
do you know where I could find a guy named Lon Rose?
it's Brenda.
Brenda? Okay.
I haven't seen him in a while.
no? Mm-mm.
okay.
what do you think about these?
I slept in them all night.
I don't know what to think, to be honest with you.
I'll take them.
you looking for sweet or sour?
sweet or sour?
well, you must be. Have I got the perfect model for you.
you must be Lon Rose. - Yes.
Hi.
I haven't seen you before.
you find us online?
no, my name's Langston.
I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.
I need to speak with you, Mr. Rose, about, uh, a woman named Sasha Katsaros.
you gotta be kidding me.
Pudder called you guys?
ms. Katsaros was only doing her job.
Mr. Pudder was out of line.
and who is Mr. Pudder?
a buyer.
see, he started pawing one of the models and when he wouldn't stop, I asked Sasha to eject him.
he tried to sneak back in,
I sent him downstairs to her and she took care of it.
Hey. Hey.
you open it, you own it, pal.
Yeah, I see you.
uh, I'm happy to talk to you all night.
just, uh, let me take care of business.
very well. - Okay.
Hey, check it out.
two grand for a pair of underwear.
can you believe that?
why would you want to vacuum pack panties?
well, the vacuum process removes oxygen, which preserves the shelf life and quality of things.
but that's typically food.
by any other name..." Get it?
would smell as sweet." Oh!
thank you. - You're welcome.
he just turned down the AC.
must be getting ready to cook.
dude...
girl won't quit snoring.
you don't pay hookers for sex, buddy, you pay them to leave.
get her out of here.
we got a situation. Somebody's at the door.
both suspects have at least one gun each.
looks like Everett has a . 357.
and Bell is packing a Colt . 45.
copy that. It's a room service waiter pushing a cart.
looks legit.
more room service?
I forgot, yeah.
you can order online here.
I was craving cheese burgers, man.
don't let him in the room.
we needed more ice anyway.
should I bring it in?
Yeah, I got this.
hurry up, we got beans to cook.
this isn't a freaking vacation.
that's confirmation.
you want a coffee?
back in college the girls would always complain about their underwear being stolen from the laundry room.
it does give a whole new meaning to the term "panty raid.
you know, I spent a lot of time in Japan.
they actually have, um, vending machines filled with used panties.
vending machines?
Seriously?
I've seen them.
okay, all right, so, this guy, Lon Rose, hosts a fetish show for men - who enjoy the scent of women's used underwear? - Right.
and because his clients are so hardcore, he vacuum packs them because it's all about that first whiff.
look, we smell with our brains, not our noses.
every time we inhale through our nostrils, air enters the nasal cavity which contains millions of olfactory receptor neurons, and when scent molecules lock into the cilia, it creates an electrical signal that tells the brain how to interpret the smell.
we follow our noses. Exactly.
odors help us choose our mates, impacts our sex drive, alters our hormone levels, even triggers memories.
for example, any time I smell nail polish,
I think about my first girlfriend, Michelle.
Clint Pudder was arrested.
they picked up Pudder.
Mr. Pudder, you've got quite a collection of women's panties in your hotel room.
did you buy all those at the show?
Yes. And I would've bought more.
that's why I came to Vegas.
well, you must've been angry when Sasha Katsaros kicked you out.
she had no right.
Yeah, is that why you killed her?
I don't know what you're talking about.
someone killed Sasha Katsaros, Mr. Pudder.
whoever did it took her panties.
you better hope we don't find her underwear in your little collection.
I would never go to a loading dock.
those places smell horrible.
and anyway, Miss K... not my type.
so, what is your, um, your type?
well...
when it comes to the, uh, chamber of Venus,
I have a very sophisticated palate.
you know, a woman's aroma is...
it's complex, you know?
and when all of the conditions are just right there's nothing to compare.
look, why don't you just talk to that charlatan Lon Rose?
he'll tell you.
I only bought off of one model.
after all the money I dropped on her last year, I slipped a pair off of her last night-- I'd earned it.
can you tell us what you did after you had been ejected for the second time?
he dropped off the merchandise around 11: 00 and I blissed out in my room for the rest of the night.
holed up in your hotel room with a bunch of women's panties is not an alibi.
if you'd ever tried it, you'd know it was.
we're gonna need a sample of your fingerprints and your DNA.
right hand, please.
is that thing clean?
I hope so.
sticks.
okay, it's show time.
just get the stuff we need for now.
how long does it take to make Ecstasy?
well, let's see.
we could go shoot some craps, play a little blackjack, have a long lunch, go shopping.
or you could take me to the new Cirque show.
maybe dinner.
and... maybe about halfway done.
you're not a cheap date.
not anymore.
no.
seriously, it all depends on the recipe and the, uh, skill of the cook.
well, it's noon now.
intel says that it's a surge that starts at 10: 00, they just don't know where.
I'm assuming surge is another term for a rave?
the underground scene uses different terms.
surge is slang for an inside party.
a "doof" is outside.
surge because of the feeling you get from E, but "doof"?
doof, it's the sound that the bass makes when there are no walls to reverberate off of.
you know,"doof, doof, doof, doof." - Yeah, I get it.
is that a text from your daughter?
Lindsey wants to visit a friend at USC.
I said no way, and she just won't drop it.
she graduates this year, right?
well, you'll miss the fights some day.
Yeah, I know.
I even miss my son's horrible techno music.
you've never talked about your son.
um, Jake.
he just, uh, turned 21.
Yeah, my ex got custody, but, uh, he was a handful, so he ended up living with me for high school.
I always thought that I was...
you know, better alone, you know?
but I miss having someone to come home to.
just wanted you to know.
my uncle was obsessed with the smell of chocolate chip cookies.
one day my aunt came home and found him with his head in the oven, thought he was committing suicide.
she realized at that instant the secret to a happy marriage
fresh-baked cookies every day.
you're really kind of freaky, Doc.
coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment.
you're welcome.
I found a contusion on her back and, uh, a couple of fractured ribs.
it's a partial shoe impression.
david found a corresponding mark on her jacket.
no distinguishing features.
hmm. So, our victim was grabbed and then kicked.
let me go! Oh.
that would explain the broken neck and the, uh, scalp lacerations.
vascular birthmark shaped like a strawberry.
you know, in Arabic they're called Wiham.
that translates to "wishes, and believed to be a sign of a mother's unfulfilled dreams.
Hey. - Hey.
so, I just finished analyzing your victim's SAE kit. Yeah?
I found one plus spermatozoa, but no indication of trauma.
okay. She had sex, but she wasn't raped.
right. - We know whose it is?
Yeah. It was an unknown male.
it wasn't Pudder.
is that the bra she was wearing when she died?
Yeah.
I don't think Pudder took her panties.
based on what?
based on the fact that I didn't receive any black underwear like that with pink satin trim in any of the lingerie that was retrieved from Pudder's room.
and...?
okay, stay with me.
that right there is an Amatore bra.
now, it's really nice, it's really expensive, and if a woman buys a bra like that, then one, she always buys the matching underwear, and two, she wears them together as a set.
it's a thing.
maybe it was in the wash.
Yeah. No. She would never put underwear like that in a washing machine.
why not? - Just trust me.
I'm an expert.
so Bell just brought in more ice.
they're probably bathing the condensate.
it's the most dangerous part.
if I'm right, they just completed the Wacker oxidation stage to keep the temperature down.
the chemical reaction is exothermic, it gives off a lot of heat.
from this point on, they've got to keep the mixture below 40 degrees Celsius at all times.
or what? It goes bad?
no.
it explodes.
how you holding up?
finding that woman's body was pretty intense.
but...
you know, these bodies here are making that memory fade pretty fast.
it's all right, Archie. It gets easier.
I've been going over Rose's sales for the last 24 hours.
quite an inventory.
let me tell you, this is one recession-proof industry.
enlarge and enhance this photo for me.
I want a look at her clavicle. - Yeah.
our victim had a strawberry-shaped birthmark.
that is Sasha Katsaros.
Oh, I... I thought she worked at the hotel.
apparently, she wasn't making enough money at her day job.
I'll see you guys tomorrow, okay?
Mr. Rose?
there's been a development in Sasha Katsaros' case.
Oh, good news.
you caught the guy.
we're circling him.
why didn't you tell us that Sasha was one of your models?
well, you didn't ask.
you didn't think that's important in a murder investigation?
look, she, uh, made me promise.
she loved her job here at the hotel.
that's... that's why she never did live modeling.
that's her table, isn't it?
Yeah.
my biggest seller.
guys went crazy over her scent.
you guys think my business is for undersexed husbands or losers who can't get any?
Yeah, something like that, yeah.
well, I might have thought that, too, if I hadn't met Sasha.
you see, she was my inspiration for starting the business.
I fell in love with the way she smelled.
well, her killer liked her smell, too.
so much so that he took a pair of her panties as a souvenir.
this is for you.
there's an officer outside who will escort you downtown.
Yeah, we're just going to sniff around, if you don't mind.
Sasha gave them to me yesterday.
Sasha, darling, they can't get enough.
I need more product.
well, I can't go home. I'm working.
well, what about the ones you're wearing?
I could sell those as fresh.
get a premium.
look, I swear I didn't kill Sasha. I loved her.
we're going to need a sample of your DNA.
you think I had sex with her?
did you? I would never have sex with Sasha.
that'd be like scribbling on the Mona Lisa.
it would kill my business.
and these-- turns out they're worthless.
Yeah, well, they're not yours anymore; they're ours now.
give them to me.
sex changes a woman's body chemistry, which alters the fragrance.
look, she should've known better.
but the nose knows.
no, no, no, no, l-listen to me.
I don't... no, no, I don't care how big her boobs are. I...
Oh, I'm so tired of white chicks. Um...
give me... give me an Asian chick.
no, you know what?
I want... - No more hookers.
we've got to finish. We only got three hours.
EV, you've got to relax.
we're the sole suppliers for this event.
we don't deliver, they don't roll.
dude, what's going to happen if we're five minutes late?
you on a suicide mission, Bell?
we ruin this guy's surge, we're dead.
he won't care how rich your daddy is. - Hey, no.
Hey, uh-uh. Don't talk to me like that, okay?
you owe me. I'm the one that got us out of the mess in Tahoe, pal.
you're the one that got us in the mess... - Oh, come on, no.
don't put that on me, all right? You cooked the beans.
you're the one that screwed up the ratio.
yeah,'cause you lied to me about what you put... - Shut up.
shut up, Ev. Shut up, or I will shoot you.
if that's room service, I'm going to shoot you.
who's at the door?
they are friends of mine.
it is a private sale.
get rid of them.
I paid for the room, so just back off.
you are looking good.
how you doing, baby?
who are you? You the BF?
we need a hook-up.
well...
she's obviously trippin' balls, so you're out of luck.
we're, uh, we'y yet.
I can feel your energy, Belly.
it's, like, ice cream.
I love your soul.
get off her, man.
Oh, my God, this is amazing.
get up, Jill. - This is like the softest thing on Earth.
now!
come on, Jill. - Hey!
you're not going anywhere, except hell.
all right, we got a possible 444 developing here.
entry team stand by.
Hey, buddy, you looking for these?
Yeah.
but first I'm going to kill your boy here.
Oh, you gotta know, I'm not going to let that happen.
besides, we start shooting, whole place goes boom.
take them. On the house.
Ooh, I'll take them.
grab your lady and bounce.
babe.
do you guys want to come?
get out.
or not.
okay, stand down, stand down.
as soon as you can, grab the male and female.
the guy's armed. He's got a revolver inside his jacket.
hold them until I get there.
we only got a couple more hours. Let's go.
Hey, uh, you want me to send one of my guys up here, keep you company?
I'll leave the radio.
Wendy. - Hmm?
here's Lon Rose's exemplar.
I need you to compare it to the male contribution found in the victim's SAE kit.
okay.
and... victim's underwear.
I was right. - Yes.
you were. Thanks for the insight.
Hey, Nick. - Yeah?
you're going to want to see this.
I was reviewing the victim's key card history for you.
according to the hotel's security card database, somebody's currently using it.
that's impossible. Sasha's key card is still in evidence.
let me see that thing.
didn't see that coming.
just wrapped up.
we didn't get anything from the boyfriend, but we did get a location for the surge from the Etard girl, Jill.
it's an abandoned building just west of Red Rock.
I've been to parties there.
well, I used to be down with PLUR.
it's an acronym for "Peace, Love, Unity, Respect."
it's like the, uh, rave motto.
anyways, it was a long time ago, but I know the scene.
you pass your drug tests?
of course.
consider yourself recruited.
okay, the surveillance team that's in place at the casino
they'll follow Everett and Bell when they leave.
I'll keep the backup units at a distance.
do you want to pick them up before they get to the party, or after they distribute?
no, I want them for distribution to minors.
give the DA something rock solid to deal with, something they can't skate on. All set?
I'll head back upstairs.
Mr. Thomas.
Oh, hey.
gentlemen, can I help you?
Yeah, I hope so.
Sasha's key card is still active.
what, you mean somebody's using it?
probably her killer.
but, you see, the thing is we already found a card in her jacket.
may I see your key card, please?
Yes, absolutely.
uh, you know what?
I, uh, I think I left it at my desk.
this is embarrassing.
I'll be right back. - No, no, no, no, no.
we'll just check your pockets right here.
how do you explain that, Mr. Thomas?
look, when I met Sasha, I knew she was special.
hell, after the third date, I wanted to marry her.
then she booked that... that lingerie job.
it made me sick to think of her sharing herself with all those...
perverts.
so we had it out, she promised to quit.
she lied. - Wait a minute.
you're going to choose a bunch of perverts over me?
they're not perverts.
they're fans-- they're my fans.
you shouldn't be jealous.
are you kidding me here?
look, Finn, if you can't accept my lifestyle, we're over.
wait, wait a minute. What is wrong with you?!
you don't know Sasha. You don't understand.
she was everything to me.
I couldn't live without her.
no, Mr. Thomas, you couldn't let her live without you.
let's go.
are they finished?
they've been in the bathroom for over an hour.
there's no more ice coming in.
it's almost 10: 00.
here we go. - We've got movement.
okay, let's lay 'em out.
final step in the process-- brand your goods.
all right, they're leaving the room. Both suspects are armed.
let me know when they hit the lobby.
I'm going to need a uni with me when I disable and process the lab.
you're looking at him.
suspects are at the valet.
game on. Let's not lose them.
suspects' vehicle is leaving the front entrance, turning north on Las Vegas Boulevard.
I'm in the number one position.
units three and four, stand by to take over.
turning east on Flamingo.
well, there's open chemicals and spilled chemicals.
I don't know what they are.
you're not suited up, Lou.
stay in the living room.
okay, I'll search for finished product.
suspects are two blocks from the warehouse.
uc officers and Sanders are in position.
we've got Sanders inside with three officers.
when I get a text, I'll give the word.
black-and-whites move up, and standby units move in.
one for you, pretty lady...
and for you.
how's it going?
slow.
bell, let's go, man.
I'm good. - No, come on, let's go.
Hey, uh, can I get another roll?
I lost the other one.
Thanks, man.
don't move.
don't even twitch, or this will be your last party.
stay right there.
you're under arrest.
let's go, pal. The party's over.
what's the 20 on Bell?
he was back there a minute ago, but he's gone.
Hey, they arrested Everett.
they're still searching for Bell in the crowd.
almost done.
the chemicals are sealed and secure, HazMat's on their way, and we'll need to pack up those suitcases and take them with us.
okay, you got it.
Adam 2-2, copy that.
we are currently in the back alleyway of the Diamond Dust.
no, dude, I snuck out a side door.
Yeah.
no, the cop... the cops don't... they don't know where I am.
I don't know what happened to Ev.
just... just come get me.
just-just come get me...- Confirm suspects are in custody.
we do not have the second suspect in custody.
repeat, we do not have the second suspect in custody.
copy that. Confirm that the suspect is still at large.
any available units to Diamond Dust Hotel.
...1-2, yeah, stand by and we'll check with the watch commander in your area.
cabaret what's going on outside.
man, this town floods at the drop of a hat.
water's almost up to the street.
we're lucky he got tangled up in the bars.
kid could be spilled out in the desert by now.
Yeah, but we could still lose him if the water starts to drop.
cuff his wrist to the gate.
I'll go down below when it's safe and get him out of there.
good call.
Hey, Catherine.
didn't expect to see you out here. You like the rain?
I was in the area.
he was obviously trying to claw his way out. Any I. D?
no, no I. D.but I can't exactly check his pockets right now.
this is technically off school property, but he looks young enough to be a student.
we're still trying to contact the principal now.
he's certainly had his hands full this semester.
Oh, yeah, that's right, Lindsey goes to school here, doesn't she?
Yeah, she had a late rehearsal.
actually, I was here to pick her up.
Hey.
Lindsey, honey.
are you okay?
do you know that boy?
Yeah. It's Sean Becker.
he goes to school here.
was he a friend? - No.
look, Mom, I know this is going to sound bad, but... he's not going to be missed.
I think I've bumped into every piece of dog poop and used condom in the city of Las Vegas.
Aw, David, suck it up.
there he is.
Yep, he's dead.
David, you think you have a hard job?
well, Officer, I am the one who has to haul him out of here.
unlock the cuffs. - Got it.
okay, get under his pit.
gently. Gently.
all right.
got him? Good. Okay.
the only way to get something as big a body into the drain system is through an access point on the line.
this is the first one upstream.
it looks like there's a service platform down there.
feeling lucky?
well, it is Vegas.
after you.
you know, the city's got like 350 miles of storm drain running under it.
I've heard there's probably a thousand homeless living down here.
high ground spots like this must be prime real estate.
this is the same design that kid had tattooed on his hand.
maybe this was his hangout.
it's close to the school.
good place to catch a buzz between classes.
could have been huffing out the storm and puffing up a storm.
passed out and rolled into the drink.
Yeah, that's possible.
you know, this spot's beginning to look more like a Klan house than a clubhouse.
numerous perimortem abrasions.
small puncture wounds.
all consistent with tumbling through debris filled water.
that...
is a white supremacist tattoo.
knuckles thickened, discolored.
this boy was no stranger to using his fists.
Dr. Langston, I think you should take a look.
there's no writing on the back, and nothing to indicate who or where...
at least, not as far as I can tell.
a racist carrying a picture of two young black girls.
could be targets.
assuming they're not already victims.
so Lindsey has told me a little bit about Sean Becker.
what can you tell me?
same crap, different iteration.
abusive father... used to disappear for long periods of time.
until he finally came out of the closet, left Sean's mother for another man.
the mother was already unstable, so the father's departure just knocked her into a psychiatric institution.
that kid was filled with hate.
blacks, Jews, gays.
well, I'm going to need his disciplinary files, and I'll need to talk to his friends.
that would be Daryl Johnson and Karl Hart.
but good luck finding them.
I suspended them both when I kicked Sean out.
well, just give me their info...we'll find them.
Oh, man.
Billy Tinker... that's the boy that was killed in the hit-and-run two months ago.
the gay student. There isn't a kid in this school who thinks his death was a accident.
half of them think Sean did it.
do you?
you're the cop, you tell me.
as far as I know, it's still an open case.
well...
after Billy was killed, a bunch of students formed a gay and lesbian defense league.
fights broke out all over the place.
so I organized Tolerance Week to help defuse things.
Sean and his pals always seemed to be around the action, so...
just one more thing.
do you recognize these girls?
they're not students here. I've never seen them before.
okay, let me get this straight...
you'd rather do the legwork on a next-of-kin notification...
you'd rather do that than slog around in the sewer looking for evidence?
I mean, that-that is not the down and dirty Sara Sidle I used to know.
I like to know where haters come from.
maybe you'll get your chance.
may I help you?
can I get you some tea?
no, thank you.
no, no, no, thank you.
um, so you're Sean Becker's guardian, is that right?
Yes, it is.
Mrs. Becker, please sit down.
sit down.
I have some bad news.
Sean's dead.
his body was found in a storm drain near the high school.
I'm sorry to tell you this.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
we're sorry for your loss.
ma'am...
we need to take a look around Sean's room.
would that be okay with you?
Oh, of course, of course.
it's...
it's the first room on the right.
when Sean comes back,
I'm sure he'll be happy to show you around.
now, now, now, Mrs. Becker...
you understand what I'm telling you, right?
you know?
Sean's not coming back.
he's... he's dead.
he's, uh...
he's with Jesus.
he's with Jesus.
how did that happen?
that's what we're here to find out.
well, then, we'll just have to wait for Sean to get back.
he'll certainly be able to shed some light on... on, um...
uh... It's okay. It's okay.
can I get you some tea?
that'd be great.
the grandmother's non compos mentis.
she has serious short-term memory loss.
probably Alzheimer's.
I called up Social Services.
they're coming out here to do an evaluation.
what do you got?
well, it's not at all what I expected.
heidegger, Nietzsche.
seems like he was whip smart.
and fascinated with killing.
the mural that the guys found in the storm drain, it's definitely this kid's work.
well, Hitler started as a painter, too.
bones fractured and never properly reset.
this young man's body was a road map of violence inflicted and meted out.
live fast, die you, and leave a not-so-good-looking corpse.
prelim tox is in.
Sean Becker was clean.
if he was into drugs, he wasn't high the night he drowned.
he didn't drown.
no foam cone, perinasal sinuses are negative for water.
then what killed him?
I knew you would ask that.
take a look.
one of the exterior puncture wounds extended into the lung.
the size of the clot suggests roughly two liters of blood loss.
that's definitely the C. O.D.
wound is cylindrical, roughly three inches deep and about an eighth of an inch wide.
x marks the spot. My guess would be Phillips-head screwdriver?
mine, too.
a racist gets stabbed before he can drown.
a lot of people would call that justice.
we still have to call it murder.
didn't you say were going to keep checking these access points until we found something?
till we found something useful, yeah.
well, I think this qualifies.
same color fibers as the vic's jacket.
I think this might be the dump site.
my turn, right?
Yeah, your turn.
okay.
well, what do you know?
Langston said we might be looking for one of these.
killer must have dropped it in with the body.
kid washes downstream, weapon sinks and gets caught up.
I think we got lucky here, buddy.
Yeah, kinda.
that thing's been sitting in rushing storm water.
we'll be lucky if we get DNA or prints.
Ah, I'm an optimist.
that's quite a road map.
it's a lot violence for such a short life.
some people turn their anger inward: depression, self-mutilation, suicide.
Sean Becker tended to turn his outward.
now, based on the bruise coloration, the most recently sustained injuries, before the night of the murder, are these: displaced knee, torso and facial bruising approximately three days earlier.
the high school sent us his disciplinary files.
something stood out.
hmm, fight at school three days ago with another student:
so you think what started there ended with a screwdriver to Sean Becker's lung?
Catherine's at the school now.
no no no stop!
this is a play about the last days before the end of the world!
the song is a romantic dream of a pure and orderly future purged of the filth and decadence represented by the cabaret life.
it is a song sung by beautiful children who will soon turn into monsters, leaving corpses spread across the length and breadth of Europe!
next time you're going to do it like you got genocide on your minds.
take five.
Catherine, nice to see you.
Lindsey, your, uh, mother's here.
Oh, actually, I'm here in an official capacity.
I need to see Ian Wentworth.
it's about Sean Becker.
why am I not surprised?
I'll get him.
mom, what's going on?
Ian couldn't have had anything to do with Sean's death.
Linds... - I know Ian.
are you giving me information or your opinion?
this is business.
stay out of it.
fine.
three days ago, you got into a fight with Sean Becker.
what happened?
it wasn't much of a fight.
okay.
I'm sure he was there planning some kind of mayhem to ruin the play:
tomatoes or hand grenades.
with someone like that, who knows?
I just wanted to put him on notice.
what are you doing here? - Nothing.
just checking out the play.
Yeah, right.
get the hell out of my way.
what are you looking for, fear?
like what you saw in Billy Tinker when you got him in your headlights?
screw you!
you like bashing gays?!
well, I fight back!
in other words, you started it.
Sean threw the first punch. I defended myself in a way I'm sure he thought I couldn't.
I... I'm not gonna lie to you, Miss Willows.
I'm glad he's dead.
it's like someone finally gave him the lifetime achievement award he so richly deserved.
but I didn't kill him.
I was in dress rehearsal that night with about 50 other people who'll swear to it...
including Lindsey.
a common Phillips-head screwdriver with a cracked wooden handle.
available at over a hundred hardware stores in town.
it's consistent with the shape of the wound.
Yeah, but unfortunately, we didn't recover any blood or prints off of it.
I swabbed for epithelials. We're still waiting for DNA.
take a look at these bruises on his torso and his face.
they're more than three days old.
yellowish brown.
that's seven- to ten-days old.
maybe they were from the same altercation.
that's what I'm thinking.
this fracture of the ulna would have hurt like hell.
you'd think he would have at least gone to an ER, had it checked out.
there's nothing in his medical records.
there's nothing in the school file.
someone did this to him.
Hey, Catherine.
what are you doing here?
just something I realized I probably should have mentioned before.
what's on your mind, Phil?
well, uh...
I guess this is what it feels like when I call someone into my office.
Phil, this is a homicide investigation.
if you know something...
uh... someone roughed up the school janitor last week.
he came in one morning bruised and limping.
did he say it was Sean Becker?
I asked him. He wouldn't say, but I... I knew it in my gut.
Sean and his crew had been on a real tear.
why didn't this janitor file a police report?
laurent Senyabou's a very private man.
he didn't want to invite any more trouble.
lord knows, he's seen enough of it to last several lifetimes.
excuse me.
laurent Senyabou?
Ye-yes?
I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
I'd like to ask you some questions about the alleged assault last week.
please, I'd rather not.
you seem nervous. Are you okay?
where I come from, the government and the police are not forces with which one wishes to get involved.
please, I am okay.
now if you don't mind, I have a lot of work to finish.
no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Laurent, look, in this country, the police protect their citizens.
so I can't do my job unless you help me.
did Sean Becker assault you? - No.
you don't understand.
when I heard about his death, it saddened me.
well, that's a first.
so far, you're the only one.
Sean was there when I was attacked.
Oh, no!
but he was not the one who attacked me.
S'up, homie?
how you doing, huh?!
Oh, come on, you little monkey.
Hey, hey, hey.
come on, boy.
Sean Becker was a stone-cold racist with a history of violence.
I mean, why would a kid like that put himself on the line for you?
we had become friends.
that's a tough one for me to understand, you know.
it's no secret I survived the genocide in my home country of Rwanda.
an event as meaningless to most students here as... Latin is to a bush hog.
but one day, Sean showed up at my door.
Hey.
what do you want?
I want to know more.
about what?
you.
your life.
I admit, he frightened me at first.
he had a reputation for cruelty.
but I soon realized Sean Becker was a truly intelligent young man.
he could see that the future which awaited him would be bleak unless he learned to contain the anger which consumed him.
so I told him about what I had experienced.
in my town of Gitambo, the entire village took refuge in a church because we knew the next morning we would be killed.
so we sent an envoy with a letter to our priest, begging him to intercede with the authorities, to spare our lives.
the envoy returned with the letter, stating only, "Get your spiritual affairs in order.
God wants you to die.
what did you do?
we prayed and awaited the end.
why didn't you pick up a knife or a club and strike back?
we had no weapons...
then you should have gouged out their eyes with your fingers!
you should have ripped out their throats with your teeth.
it would've made no difference.
I told him about how hatred begets only hatred, and that, in the end, all one is left with is loss, diminishment and death.
the next morning, the Hutu militia tossed grenades into the church.
those who could fled outside, but only to be hacked with machetes and left to die slowly.
some, myself included, slipped into a forest and escaped.
but I never saw my family again.
he came around often after that, always in secret.
and we discussed many things.
is that a picture of you and your family?
you know, God works in mysterious ways, Detective Brass.
in Rwanda, he took everything from me.
but in my new country, he granted me a new family.
do you recognize them?
they were my sisters.
this is Eliane.
she was studying to become a nurse.
and this is Grace, the baby.
silly girl.
she was always laughing for reasons known only to herself.
I think perhaps he had fallen a bit in love with them.
he asked me if he could copy the photo.
I didn't see why not.
do you think Sean's friends knew about your friendship with him?
I don't know.
but if so, it would have been very dangerous for Sean.
the big dumb one's Daryl Johnson.
little dumb one's Karl Hart.
they look wasted.
found them huffing spray paint,
green Valley Park, with the girl.
well, my guys are waiting in the rooms for them.
let's go, big boy.
okay. You don't have to talk if you don't want to.
but if you're smart, you will write down everything that happened that night.
in your own words.
so at least we have your side of the story.
you want a layer?
it says "lawyer," dude.
don't you know how to read?
so I hear that gold gives you the best buzz.
is that right?
Yeah, nothing but the best for us, bro.
so why don't you tell me about the altercation that you and Karl and Sean Becker got into with the school janitor last week.
Oh, right.
that.
uh... Sean and Karl, they were gonna kick this, um,
african-american dude's ass.
but then I stepped in and said, you know, "Seeing as this is Tolerance Week and all, why don't we try a little tolerance for a change?
you know?
try and see things from the point of view of the brother.
right?
but they just kept on wailing on him.
so, I mean...
the janitor says that you were the one that attacked him.
those banana-eaters can't tell white people apart.
I'm gonna kick his ass when I get out of here.
well, you're not going anywhere just yet, tough guy.
when I cut your friends a deal and they flip on you, which they will, you're gonna find yourself locked up in the county jail for assault.
but you know what, I'm gonna do you a favor, since you like to whup so much ass.
I'm gonna have the warden put you in with some African-Americans so that they can give you an up-close and personal lesson on race relations.
I saw you there that night outside the storm drain, Molly.
if you know anything about what happened to Sean, you need to tell me.
I killed Sean.
what do you mean?
Sean had been acting weird lately.
he was pulling away from me, disappearing a lot.
I thought he was cheating on me.
so I followed him.
ten years ago, in the small East African country of Rwanda, 800, 000 people were slaughtered by their own government.
virtually the entire world turned away.
it was so weird.
he was being so secretive.
so I followed him again the next day.
and it got even weirder.
that janitor was, like, touching him.
I had this just sick feeling that Sean was, like, getting it on with the colored guy.
I told Daryl and Karl, and they didn't believe me.
so they decided to test Sean's loyalty.
what's going on, little man?
how you doing, huh?! - Hey, hey, hey.
let's blow, man. This guy ain't worth it.
Hey, chillax, bro. We're just trying to have a good time, all right?
aren't we?
Hey, hey. I said cut it out, bro.
this guy mops the floors, cleans the toilets.
he's one Negro who knows his place.
let's go.
don't think, Daryl!
it's not your gift!
you just do what I tell you to do!
Daryl called Sean a race traitor.
he said he was gonna kill him.
the only thing we have on Karl andor Daryl is Molly's statement.
but then she eventually told me that she didn't actually witness the murder.
well, even if the two dummies ended up killing Sean in retribution, we're not getting anything out of them.
they both "layered up.
well, they all had access to the storm drain where the body was found.
and no surprise, the murder weapon came back negative for epithelials.
so much for optimism.
I do believe that the body evidence corroborates the janitor's statement.
Sean was protecting him.
the facial bruising is consistent with Daryl's blow to Sean's mouth.
the ulnar fracture is a classic defensive wound.
Sean warding off Daryl's attack.
sounds like Sean was really trying to change his life.
probably what got him killed.
it's always easier to, uh, embrace hatred than it is to leave it behind.
and we still don't have a shred of evidence to prove who killed him.
those files are confidential, Lindsey you know that.
you're lucky your mother didn't catch you.
I know. Sorry.
something wrong?
not really.
not really what?
it's just...
it seems like Sean had a really rough life.
I was thinking I could've been a little nicer to him.
a couple days ago, he tried to talk to me.
Hey, Lindsey.
your mom is, like, a cop or a CSI or something like that, right?
so? - I was just curious.
um, how exactly does one go about accessing fingerprint databases?
Why? You want to know if you're already in the system?
why would Sean be interested in fingerprints?
he was hitting on me.
obviously.
I think he even had a little crush on me.
graphite
born in 1968.
believed to have risen to a position of leadership in the Hutu Power Movement.
wanted for crimes against humanity related to the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
fugitive since 1995. Whereabouts unknown.
until now.
in the spring of 1994, 800, 000 Rwandans were murdered by their neighbors and friends.
4, 000 of those souls live in a village called Gitambo.
when the killing was over, only 22 of them had survived.
laurent Senyabou does not exist.
his real name is Matthew Babajide.
he was not only a participant, but one of the chief architects of the massacre at Gitambo.
this is from testimony given to the Rwandan Commission on High Crimes.
Babajide threw the first grenades into the church, "and for the next three days, his machete "and those of his men rose and fell "with monotonous regularity.
he performed his task in a way "that would prolong the suffering of his victims.
at night, his men would play music on the radio "and drink themselves into a stupor, "as hyenas emboldened by the smell of blood "wandered into the village "and ate the flesh not only of the dead, but also of the dying.
captain Brass.
I need you to come to the station with me...
Mr. Babajide.
wait a minute, that's-that's not his name.
you have the wrong man. - Daddy...
Laurent, tell him. - Daddy!
stay with your mother. - Daddy!
Papa will be back, yeah?
daddy!
if that's true, Matthew Babajide has killed more people than all the murderers this team has ever brought to justice combined.
we notified the State Department, which coordinates with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
they confirm Babajide's identity, and they're arranging for extradition.
it'd be nice if we could add Sean Becker to his tally.
you like him for it?
Yes.
Yes, just speculation for now, but we believe that Sean Becker inadvertently discovered the janitor's true identity.
Sean couldn't be certain it was him, so he tried to prove it by lifting one of Laurent's fingerprints.
unfortunately, he had no way of running the print.
he decides to confront Laurent nonetheless, assuming that the truth will reveal itself based on the reaction.
and Laurent stabs Sean with a screwdriver in a panic to protect his secret.
in other words, we've got the murder weapon.
we just can't put it in his hands.
you stabbed Sean Becker with a screwdriver.
so what happened, you get in a fight?
Sean found out who you really were and confronted you?
you lied to me.
preach peace?
you're entire life is a lie.
you're no better than anybody else.
Sean, what are you talking about?
you think that is me?
what about them?
did you simply kill them too, or did you rape them first?
Sean... - How about I take these to the cops?
we'll see what's true and what's not.
that's not what happened.
what, he didn't find out who you were?
no. I-I-I mean...
Yes.
but I never meant to hurt him.
it was an accident.
that's really semantics.
you threw his body in a storm drain, and Sean Becker was probably still alive when you did it.
who are they?
I have no idea.
I knew when I fled Rwanda to create my new future,
I would have to create a new past as well.
I found the photo in a pile of bones picked clean by scavengers, bleached in the sun.
Sean was going to track them down, wasn't he?
for you... his friend.
out of love.
for once in his life to do something good.
for the past 15 years,
I've tried to make amends for what I've done.
I never expected God to forgive me, but I thought, if I could save this one boy, this one soul,
I could save a part of myself as well.
I never meant to hurt him.
you're just a criminal on the run.
so what's it to you to kill another kid?
Oh, I tell you...
lucky is the man who never has to confront what he is truly capable of.
No! Stop, please!
don't stop.
you know that the speed limit is not a suggestion, right?
you gonna give me a ticket, copper?
used to bring Lindsey up here.
mount Charleston always has been a hot spot for skiers and hikers and...
now murderers.
you can see the terror in his eyes.
this man knew he was going to die.
this is a serious blood pool.
he was alive when his head was chopped off.
still tacky.
fresh kill.
so the park ranger said he thought he heard wolves howling, but they're not native to the area, so he came down here to check it out.
looks like his body's been posed.
could be some kind of a cult killing.
satanic rituals are often performed in a natural setting like this, but this...fence is a poor altar.
if this was a ritualistic killing, there would be some...sign.
blood moon.
in the Book of Revelations, it was considered to be a precursor to the end of days.
well, it certainly was for this poor guy.
no tire tracks, no footprints.
I can't even see my own.
he's not dressed for hiking.
he had to get out here some way.
well, there's no ID on him.
where is the bug man when you need him?
I'm right here, buddy.
what is that?
that is a long-horned beetle.
Nick, there's something else in his mouth, and it's not moving.
hair.
maybe he got a piece of his attacker.
guys, I'm gonna need some bigger tools.
Yeah, okay.
I've got some ligature marks on his wrist.
you check the other one, will you?
Yeah, same thing over here.
but these patterns are inconsistent with this barbed wire.
stop, please stop!
looks like somebody brought chains to the party.
do you see these abrasions and cuts here in the chest?
they appear to have been made by the barbed wire.
so, our victim ran into the barbed - wire fence, and then...our killer... turned him around.
killer wanted to look him in the eye.
it would have made the killer feel very powerful.
hang on, now, Super Dave. You just gonna chop him up?
Oh, Dr. Robbins said that he wanted the head with the pike, and the body with the fence.
I'll take the saw.
I'll grab the head? - Yep. Ready?
okay. It's like trying to get meat off a shish kebab.
you all right? - Yeah. Yeah.
give me a hand, David.
the post went through the trachea, soft palate, and all the way into the brain.
heads or tails?
I'll take heads.
Lizzie Borden got an axe and gave her mother 40 whacks.
contrary to the poem, Lizzie Borden gave her parents a total of 29 whacks.
in this case, we won't know the number of whacks or the type of weapon that did the whacking until we boil off the flesh and examine the tool marks.
he has got symmetrical scars on both palms.
that would support the theory that we're dealing with some kind of cult.
bloodletting is a common practice.
abrasions are deep.
he struggled.
it's a powerful thing, the will to live.
well, so is the will to kill.
looks like more than a dozen chop marks.
the water's beading.
lotions and massage oils make water run off the skin like this.
Yeah. This man has very little body hair.
he's been waxed.
from head to toe.
and... everywhere in-between.
doesn't seem to be any hair regrowth.
this was done recently.
the thing about wax is... it likes to stick around.
I'll get this to Hodges.
Hey. I ran our Vic's prints through AFIS.
he's not in the system, and no one matching his description has been reported missing.
well, if he's a tourist, it could be that no one knows he's gone yet.
I got his photo out to all the hotels, so maybe somebody will recognize him.
you know, uh, last night...Was...
really great.
we gotta do that more often.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me?
what did you just say?
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm serious.
I'd like to make dinner for you every night.
maybe a little breakfast in bed, if you're good.
that sounds nice.
I... I'll talk to you later.
Yeah.
I always imagined Wendy and me moving in together.
cuddling on the couch. Watching the Iron Chef.
battle Garbanzo Bean was our favorite.
do you have something for me?
olive oil, Rosemary, and a little lemon juice.
salad dressing.
Yeah, you throw in a balsamic, and you have a vinaigrette, but in this case...
it's the ingredients in the wax that was used on your victim for his extensive man-scaping.
double ouch.
I used to go to the Anubis Spa.
they had this sugar-based wax which is similar to what they used in ancient Egypt.
so an olive oil-based wax...
I'm guessing the Mediterranean Hotel?
so the hotel spa confirmed that Michael Wilson had a full-body wax there three days ago.
should be the room up here, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it's right here.
front desk recognized the photograph that Vartann's been shopping around.
said that Wilson came in from San Diego and he's here for some kind of convention.
obvious signs of a struggle.
it would be pretty hard to take someone out of a hotel room against their will without getting caught on camera, right?
I'll pull surveillance.
looks like Mr. Wilson was here for a special occasion.
yeah?
today and for all eternity... I dedicate my soul to you.
I love you, too, honey.
they're wedding vows.
he was getting married.
found a yellow contact lens.
that's an unusual color.
victim wasn't wearing contacts.
a Celtic love knot.
it's where, uh, the expression "tying the knot" came from, you know.
I got a couple of receipts here.
one for flowers, one for a cake, and according to this, they're supposed to be delivered to the Unity Room of this hotel on the seventh.
the wedding's today.
you wouldn't happen to have any garlic on you, would you?
no, I'm fresh out.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Julie, we just have a few more questions.
hasn't she been through enough?
I'm going to put a stop to this.
your kind clearly have no right to badger her like this.
our kind?
Mr. Stewart, a young man has been brutally murdered.
we have every right to be here.
and as far as I'm concerned, you can drop the act. - The act?
uh, yesterday afternoon... when we rehearsed the ceremony.
so roughly 24 hours ago.
they didn't want to see each other before the wedding.
it's tradition.
we embrace the... the principles and the morals of centuries past.
not like the present, where you drive through a chapel and Elvis will hand you a license.
as to Michael's state of mind last night... did he seem agitated, or... unsettled?
no. Michael was about to marry the love of his life.
I've never seen anyone so happy.
Ethan. You're the best man, right?
right.
so you were in charge of the bachelor party?
bachelor party?
Yeah, did you guys party like a rap star last night, or what?
we simply dined.
then Michael went back to his room to work on his vows and meditate.
vampires meditate?
a true vampiric state can only be achieved through discipline and self-control.
self-control wasn't exercised in Michael's hotel room.
the place was completely trashed.
this is all my fault.
I was the one who wanted to get married at the convention.
where they let anyone in.
all of our friends were going to be here, anyway.
I wanted them to see how happy we were.
let's go back to where they let everyone in. Who's "everyone"?
this is a Covens and Clans convention.
vampires, and... unfortunately werewolves.
Mr. Stewart...
may I see your hand, please?
miss Crenshaw?
we found the same scar on Michael's palms.
in the movies, vampires thirst for blood.
Well...we're not sanguinarians.
for us, blood is a... a symbol of the life force that flows through us.
we shed our blood in ceremonies to bind one another together.
whoever killed Michael put a stake in my heart, too.
this has Van Helsing written all over it.
the vampire slayer?
I thought he just staked them through the heart.
the staking was just to keep them in their coffins.
if you really want to kill a vampire, you have to cut off his head.
only this guy wasn't a real vampire.
well, someone thought so.
you know, a few years ago, in Romania, a family dug up their dead relative because they thought he was a vampire.
they ripped out his heart, burned it, mixed the ashes with water, and then drank it.
Seriously?
and, much like you, the Romanian police didn't believe in vampires, so they charged the family with abusing a corpse.
served three years in prison.
but the townspeople thought they were heroes.
individual stria match.
a single tool made all these cuts.
depth impressions range from one-to-three-eighths of an inch, indicating varying degrees of force.
the killer used a curved, heavy-headed blade, most likely an axe or a hatchet.
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Arch.
well, so much for our abduction theory.
surveillance confirmed that Michael Wilson left the hotel at midnight by himself.
there had to be some kind of altercation.
you did see his room.
Yeah, whoever started it probably finished it at Mount Charleston.
what do you think?
creepy.
Yeah. I do feel powerful.
I feel... you know, dangerous.
I think maybe the reason these people dress up like these creatures is to help them embrace their dark side.
Yeah, yeah, no, I get it. You kinda scared me for a minute there.
same contact lens as the one that we found in Michael Wilson's room.
they've sold 500 of these at this convention in the last two days.
well, great. That's impossible to trace.
we'd better hope DNA comes through.
Yeah.
cool eyes.
mom! I need your credit card.
I think you just turned another one over to the dark side.
that's nice... nice...
remember, you're undead.
so you think it's the neck biting, the bloodsucking, or the carnal sex that's the appeal?
it's probably all of the above.
once you mate, it's for life.
you know, if it's worth, uh, living for...
it's also worth dying for.
wiccans... bring your best spells and potions to the sharing circle, when the hour strikes...
that's quite an arsenal.
I didn't realize that vampires and werewolves needed weapons.
Oh, they don't. You do.
back to work, honey. Don't flirt with the dogs.
it's slay or be slayed out there.
so have you ever used one of these weapons to, uh, slay a vampire yourself?
if these blades could talk.
no, but seriously, can I tell you guys something?
I'm a direct descendant of the great Van Helsing. - Really?
Yeah. So... Ridding the world of monsters is in my blood.
I've seen the evil they can do.
killing machines, really. No conscience, no mercy.
so what kind of weapon would you recommend to, say, decapitate a vampire?
Ooh, I like how you think.
I would go with the TransVlad 5000.
top o' the line.
stainless steel, leather-wrapped handle,
and how much does that set you back?
well, for you young slayers, I could do...450 bucks.
Yeah. Kinda steep. That's a little pricey.
well, why don't you let me slash the price?!
$425, just for today.
we were thinking of something more along the lines of the axe or hatchet family?
I get it.
you guys are on some kind of budget.
you're not yanking my chain here. You're not wasting my time?
cause I might have to... decapitate you!
I'm just kidding.
honey, can you get me the wood axe?
if he doesn't die, he'll-he'll have to get a tetanus shot.
no, but seriously, this might do the trick on your entry-level blood junkies, but, uh, no guarantees.
and... No returns.
heavy head, curved blade about five inches long.
how many of these have you sold?
none. People usually go for the crossbows, or the... or the scimitars.
they don't go for something you could get at Home Depot.
we'll take it. - We'll take it.
Oh, man.
sorry.
that's okay, this shirt was begging for it.
recreating the event, I see.
analyzing tool marks and blood spatter.
according to Doc Robbins, Michael Wilson was struck no less than 18 times.
how many you up to? - About 11.
I keep trying to hit the same place twice, but every time I miss,
I have to start over again, and my hand is killing me.
want to let me give it a whack?
all right.
you know my papa used to say the great thing about wood once when you chop it, and once when you burn it.
that's my five, your 11, that makes 16.
I think we shaved a couple off the killer's total.
come take a look at this with me, will you?
the victim was struck from all sides.
that's very difficult to do with a guy who's chained to a fence.
that would mean the killer hopped the fence, so he could take shots from the other side.
why do that?
we just proved you can get the job done standing in the same spot.
maybe he didn't know that.
there is another possibility.
maybe he wasn't alone.
that's a hair we found in your victim's mouth.
scale patterns are mosaic. It's not human.
I ran it against this exemplar.
canis lupus.
wolf hair? - Or, maybe... werewolf.
I have been doing extensive research.
according to the legend, vampires enslaved werewolves during the Trajanic War.
werewolves revolted, and they've been mortal enemies ever since.
like Cain and Abel.
romulus and Remus.
Tom and Jerry. I get it.
there were a lot of werewolves at that convention.
but as scientists, we know that wannabe werewolves cannot physically transform themselves into wolves.
so, where did this hair come from?
perhaps one of them has a four-legged companion.
they say that people look like their dogs.
Greg's running canine CODIS right now.
thank you.
um, out of curiosity... uh, will you and Detective Vartann be sharing your house or his?
really none of your business.
I had love in my grasp, and I let it slip through my fingers, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself.
it's a terrible thing to wake up to every day.
I'll... keep that in mind.
your wolf's in the system.
his name's Timber.
hmm, how original.
he was entered into canine CODIS two years ago, when his owner assaulted someone in front of the Tangiers.
timber, here, joined in on the fight.
wolves don't normally attack humans. Blame the owner, not the wolf.
who's the owner?
Kurt Francis. He's also in the system.
multiple assaults, drunk and disorderly, DUI...
he's registered at the convention.
he's the leader of a werewolf pack.
well, we're looking for multiple attackers.
wolves do hunt in packs.
maybe werewolves do, too.
get your glasses up. Come on. Come on.
looks like we need another round.
who's buying another round? - Yo, yo, check her out.
sorry, guys...
that is a nice piece of meat.
you're right, Kurtis. Sweet!
how about it, honey? How about a lap dance?
where you going? Come on!
No! Get your hands off of me!
come on! Ah!
you're hurting me!
get your hands off of her.
what do you think you're doing with that stick, old man?
relax, relax, relax. Everybody be cool now.
be cool now, boys.
move it along, old man.
what is that?
is that wolf hair?
back up!
back up!
back up!
the hold I have you in is called a lateral vascular hold.
the discomfort you're feeling is my forefinger and thumb constricting your airway, cutting off the oxygen to your brain.
you should pass out right about...now.
why don't one of you take this chains off me and give me my vest back?
well, you can't have it back.
you know, when I was a kid, we had a dog, and when he died we never once considered turning him into a jacket.
eh, never.
timber was a loyal member of the pack.
I wanted to keep him with me.
we found some of Timber's hair in the teeth of a murder victim, Michael Wilson.
who?
he was at your convention... he was of the vampire persuasion.
well, I don't hang with parasites.
well, you should think about it.
I mean, you have a lot in common.
you're in the same movies.
you know, there's a creature in the Philippines called an Aswang.
a what? - Aswang.
it's a half-breed.
half vampire, half werewolf.
we are nothing like those bloodsuckers.
there's a reason why they hide in the dark, you know?
act like the elite.
pretend to be, uh... refined.
you see, us animals... we're honest.
we follow our instincts.
we give in to our urges.
like the urge to kill.
we found a contact lens in Michael Wilson's hotel room.
the DNA says it's yours.
I think you're taking this mortal enemy thing a little too far.
now, where were you two nights ago?
I don't remember.
there was a full moon, and I shifted.
you shifted?
when there's a full moon, I'm not as strong,
I can't control it.
can you remember where you were when the sun came up?
I was in my car.
where was your car?
Self-Park garage at the Mediterranean, level three.
good dog.
this car is a gas guzzler.
you'd think a wolf would be more environmentally conscious.
I think I know why Kurt Francis couldn't remember what happened last night.
that pooch has been hitting the hooch.
it's not the moonlight that turns them into a beast, it's the moonshine.
got some dog collars.
similar pattern to the ligature marks.
it's probable that Kurt and his pack used these to restrain Michael Wilson.
there's spatter on the passenger door.
positive for blood.
the truck might have been parked near the fence when they were killing Michael.
well, there's blood in the window well, too.
a lot of it.
the window must have been open.
then why isn't there any blood inside the truck, on the seats?
what is that smell?
vomit.
is that really what we're gonna talk about right now, man? I'm eating.
well, you're always eating.
you were saying?
the blood on Kurt Francis's truck came back to the Vic.
but mixed in with it were traces of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid.
digestive enzymes.
Yeah, someone drank Michael Wilson's blood and then puked it out the window.
Yeah, Kurt Francis.
no. It did not come back to Kurt Francis.
of course... a vampire.
if we accept the mythology, werewolves don't drink blood, vampires do.
so, what was a vampire doing in Kurt Francis's truck?
don't they hate each other?
I can't tell you why they were carpooling, but I can tell you that the vampire we're looking for is sick.
Hodges found traces of hematin and mesoporphyrin in the vomit.
both of those are used to treat porphyria.
it's a blood disorder; it's also known as the "vampire disease."
well, you know, we had a case about ten years ago where the killer had porphyria. Remember?
she chopped up her victims and turned them into protein shakes.
I'm sorry, man.
it's all right.
so we're not just looking for a vampire poser.
we're looking for a sanguinarian.
by sharing our blood with Michael, he takes a part of each of us into the next world.
it's one in life, one in death.
it's how we honor our dead.
well, may a stranger offer a few words?
uh, no, actually.
thank you. Thank you.
michael lived and died as... a vampire.
a being hated for centuries.
hatred is born of fear, fear of things we don't understand.
in medieval times, for example, when someone saw a blooded corp with blood running from it's mouth, they believed it was a vampire such as yourselves.
science now teaches us that that's just part of the decomposition process.
it's simply gasses purging fluids from the body through the nose and from the mouth.
this is highly inappropriate at a memorial service.
you know, you're right, Thomas.
this is a somber occasion, Dr. Ray.
maybe we should lighten things up a little bit.
maybe we should.
what does it say in the Good Book, Nick?
let there be light.
science has a way of revealing other truths about vampires.
like... your acute sensitivity to sunlight.
it's actually a symptom of a medical condition called porphyria.
Even...brief exposure to sunlight can cause your skin to...burn...and blister.
the great thing about science is that it always sheds light on the subject.
I didn't kill Michael.
when I found him, he was already dead.
so you thought, why let all that good blood go to waste?
you know, I take offense to that.
you said yourself that your coven doesn't drink blood.
no, we don't.
I made an exception for Michael.
Why?
because I wanted his soul to live on through me.
they lured him to the mountain.
I tried to get there in time to save him, but I was too late.
yeah? Who's "they"?
wolves.
they had their noses open that night.
you know, there's only one problem with your story, Thomas.
you hitched a ride back to town with the leader of the wolf pack.
the evidence tells us that you and Kurt Francis killed Michael together.
see, the thing about drinking human blood is, our bodies lack the enzymes to break it down properly.
it induces vomiting.
I understand why the werewolves would want Michael dead, but why would he turn against one of his own?
maybe Michael lost faith.
maybe Michael started to see you
a frustrated Web site designer from London.
or maybe it was about the girl.
you wanted her all to yourself, didn't you?
I want a lawyer.
the yellow contact lens puts Kurt Francis in Michael Wilson's hotel room.
Michael's blood in Kurt's car puts him at the crime scene along with Thomas Stewart.
but without the murder weapon, we can't prove that either of them killed Michael.
right. But when Nick and I hacked off Jell-O Man's head, we were covered with blood.
so if Kurt and Thomas hacked off Michael's head...
the clothes should prove it.
they should.
you know, there should be a lot more blood than this.
could be castoff from simply being at the scene.
all it proves is that Kurt and Thomas were there.
well, at the least, they were there.
if they only took one or two swings, that could account for the lack of blood.
he was hit with an axe at least 18 times, so whether they were just there or they took a couple of swings, it means that someone else took the rest of the swings.
Yeah. Yeah, another wolf.
or another vampire.
I admit that a black cloak does lend a gentleman a certain kind of mysterious allure.
there's just one drawback...
it drags along the ground and collects plenty of trace.
what did you find, David?
alpine rock butterweed.
it's a flowering herb that only grows above 2, 500 feet on Mount Charleston along the South loop trail.
we didn't find any of this stuff at the crime scene.
makes me wonder what else is up there.
we know that Michael was running from his attackers.
we know that the chase ended at the fence.
where did it begin?
did you know that a 12-letter word for "across the woods" is "Transylvania"?
is that you, Grissom?
shut up.
I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him that either.
no, you don't think so?
I don't.
after all this time.
that's a shame.
all right, here you go.
I'll see you at 2, 500.
if you can keep up.
alpine rock butterweed.
big fat tire treads, consistent with Kurt's gas guzzler of a truck.
got something here.
dirt's been disturbed.
another piece.
I know this guy.
that's Kurt Francis.
I can beat that. - Yeah?
I think somebody tried to bury the hatchet.
this photo was taken at last year's convention.
do you recognize the werewolf standing next to Kurt Francis?
how about now?
he was part of Kurt's wolf pack?
looks that way.
I think Michael was a wolf who fell for a vampire, but the only way he could have her was to become a vampire himself and hope that nobody recognized him from last year's convention.
well, someone obviously recognized him and that someone was Kurt Francis.
he followed Michael to his room, he confronted him, and he got in his face.
once a werewolf, always a werewolf, Michael.
we were brothers. You betrayed us for one of them!
my guess is that Kurt went looking for Thomas to let him know that there was a traitor in his midst.
and for one night and one night only, they joined forces to kill a common enemy.
fluorescein green.
enhances contrast in latent blood.
excellent choice.
thank you.
the handle's been wiped clean, but they didn't get all the blood.
there's some patterns in the wood.
I think I've seen this before.
look at this.
this is the test axe that Nick and I used on Jell-O Man.
see the pattern?
similar markings. - Right.
but not the same.
they came from this.
my, uh, my wedding ring made a pattern in blood on the handle.
Kurt Francis wears a ring that has a wolf insignia.
that doesn't look like a wolf to me.
that's a beautiful engagement ring.
thank you.
it's designed to fit your wedding band, yes?
may I?
and the two halves become one.
michael and I liked the symbolism.
the idea that we'd be together forever.
well, we like symbols, too.
they have a way of making an impression, especially in blood.
when you were swinging that axe at Michael's head again and again, his blood seeped onto the handle of the axe, and your ring left behind an unusual pattern.
you got his blood all over you, on your clothes, in your hair.
CSIs are searching your hotel room right now.
even if you washed your clothes, even if you took a shower, they'll find evidence of his blood there.
michael never told you that he used to be a werewolf, did he?
no.
how did you find out?
thomas told Michael and me to meet him at Mount Charleston for a pre-wedding ritual.
as soon as we got there, I knew something was wrong.
thomas ordered Michael to hand over his contacts and his fangs.
what are they doing here?
michael ran and they ran after him, and by the time I caught up, they had chained Michael to a fence.
stop! Let me go!
do something, help him.
show her.
don't, stop!
your beloved used to be a werewolf.
michael said he'd seen me at the convention last year.
said he knew we were destined to be together.
so he changed who he was because he loved you.
love built on a lie isn't love.
you can't be someone you're not.
he wasn't one of us.
and that didn't sit well with anyone. Did it?
traitors must die.
Julie, I love you. It doesn't matter what side I'm on!
he's not on any side.
he's not one of us, he's never been one of us, and he's not even one of them.
now, you align yourself to this man, that makes you no better than him.
we're all watching, Julie.
choose.
Julie. Julie, this is all make-believe.
vampires, werewolves.
none of this is real.
my love for you... that's what's real.
we can just walk away from all this.
do you really love me?
Yes, with all my heart, I love you.
that was your mistake.
you can't be you and love me.
no, stop, don't, no!
if you agree to testify against Thomas Stewart and Kurt Francis, you may be able to avoid the death penalty.
I killed Michael.
maybe the, uh, werewolf and vampire can work out a peace treaty while they're sharing a cell.
and Julie Crenshaw will be spending her honeymoon behind bars.
so much for love.
well, there's still hope for the rest of us, I hope.
you never did give me an answer.
okay.
look, if you don't want to move in together, you know, I understand.
I think that what we have now is pretty awesome.
and I just fear that if we were to move in together, we're going to start to argue about who forgot to unload the dishwasher, all kinds of crap like that.
besides, we're both armed.
it could end badly.
Yeah, but, uh...
I'm willing to risk it.
I'm not.
can't we just enjoy what we've got now?
Yeah. I'll take it.
man, I saw this movie when I was about seven.
freaked me out. - Really?
Yeah, that particular Nosferatu... just... scared me to death.
you know, people invented stories about werewolves and vampires to explain the evil in the world.
couldn't believe that people were capable of such terrible violence.
sometimes I can't even believe it myself.
but I suppose if there were no evil in the world, we'd be out of a job.
speak of the devil.
triple homicide at the Tangiers.
let's go hunt some monsters.
the truck was headed to the landfill.
when it passed through the security gate, the guard noticed a suspicious ooze leaking out of the back, so he notified the driver.
the driver jumped out, checked it out and called us.
what is the code for suspicious ooze?
6-6-6.
well, at least the primordial variety-- the stuff of creation, Heaven and Hell.
Yeah, I'll take "Hell" for $500, please, Alex.
is this, your, uh,"ooze"? - Yep.
shut it down!
shut it down!
looks like blood.
smells like blood.
okay. Open it up.
possible body parts.
looks like it's been put through a cheese grater.
this is some kind of hardcore shredding, boys.
cafe Perka.
cappuccino machine.
I was thinking about buying one of these.
piece of a steel-belted radial?
bicycle bell.
guess the rest of the bicycle's in there somewhere.
what do you make of that?
credit card?
looks like it used to be a credit card.
a chopped-up rubber tire, a coffee maker, and a cheese-grated body-- if that's what this is.
not something you see every day.
here's looking at you, kid.
well, that's one way to clear a paper jam.
prototype failed.
it jammed before it made it to market.
the business made us destroy it.
you guys said something about body parts?
Yeah. We found some in a truck headed for the landfill.
it was mixed in with a lot of shredded stuff, much like what comes out of your machine.
truck's manifest led us here.
got to be some mistake.
company sends us all kinds of material to shred.
electronics, appliances, apparel, prototypes, rejects, recalls.
Hey, somebody has to lose the Super Bowl, right?
all those hats and t-shirts-- "We're Number One!
this is where they turn out to be number two.
does that include bodies?
no. We don't shred people.
maybe someone fell in.
well, we've got cameras everywhere. Not to mention OSHA.
someone so much as gets a paper cut, gotta shut down.
you're gonna have to shut it down right now, boss.
we need to take a look at it.
we want to talk to everybody who worked that night shift.
plus we're going to need to see what your "eyes" saw.
you guys got a warrant?
Hey, got one right here.
you can, uh, shred it when we're done.
except for the big stuff, most clients send their material in padlocked bins.
they fill them up at their offices, arrange secure transport, we take care of the rest.
that's it; that's the whole graveyard shift.
like I said, no one fell in.
well, maybe they didn't have to.
padlocked bins, secure transport...
if I was going to get rid of a body, seems like a good way to go.
all this came from the one truck with the body parts?
Yeah. Looks like we're in for a long day.
did you really sign up for this?
Yeah, as my recent brush with T-Rex confirms, the exhilaration of field work is the only thing that gets me out of my head.
still got Wendy on your mind, huh?
Yeah.
believe me, I get it.
two ships passing-- takes a while for the fog to clear.
I know what you need, H.
good night out on the town. - Yeah.
when?
all right, guys, we got paper, plastic, metal, yuck...
let's call it, shall we?
I got "yuck."
Oh, Lady Catherine.
always a delight.
somebody's in a good mood.
well, I enjoy a good puzzle now and again, and this one is grade "A."
you seem in a good mood, yourself.
you have a... certain glow.
Hodges opened his big mouth.
detective Vartann's a good man.
can we, uh... get to the goo?
I, uh, sent representative samples to DNA.
we'll see what we get.
obviously, the body's too mangled to determine much.
weight of the parts suggests that we're looking at only one unfortunate soul.
I took a tissue sample.
put your nose down the scope. I'll give you a tour.
tissue's autolyzed, with a lack of nuclear detail.
presence of saprophytic bacteria started the decomp.
our victim was DBS.
dbs? - Dead Before Shred.
time of death's approximately 36 to 48 hours before the indignity of this dice and slice.
C.O.D?
well, a portion of the cranial bone shows a hint of a beveled edge.
are you thinking entry wound?
more than thinking. I also found this.
bullet frag.
it stuck around.
Greg found bullet fragments in the grind from the shredder.
we'll run everything through ballistics, see what we find.
nevada Department of Corrections Ely State Prison, 17213 Lindale Avenue Ely, NV 89301.
thinking of you XO nate
everything all right?
Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
you been swimming?
Oh, uh, shower.
we just went through a truckload of garbage and dead body.
I, um... I still smell, don't I?
you don't want an answer to that.
found a credit card-- well, a piece of one.
very similar to the one that you pulled out of the trash last night, am I right?
looks like it.
there were several in the shredder mix, and these were more finely diced than the others, and Hodges thought that it merited a closer look.
is he, uh, running it through trace?
Yeah.
you sure you're all right?
fine.
you, uh... dropped your bean.
DNA on our D. B. came back.
confirms one source. No hits in CODIS.
so far, all we have is an unidentified white male.
well, we knew I. D. on this guy wasn't going to be easy.
he's in a thousand pieces.
pieces may be all that we need as long as they're the right ones.
I ran trace on the credit card shards that G and I found in the shredder mix.
they were bathed in high concentrations of hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride.
stomach acid.
along with magnesium, potassium, beta carotene, zinc and some essence of Mercenaria mercenaria.
spit it out, H.
quahog clams.
apparently, the shards were part of a not-so-delightful Manhattan clam chowder.
so what you're saying is, our victim ate his credit cards?
or someone made him eat them.
it's like straight out of an old Mob movie.
you can't pay up, so eat up.
bullet in the head for dessert.
well, we didn't find enough pieces to reconstruct the name and number as it appears on the card, but we may not have to, because... we have this.
the magnetic stripe.
cardholder's name and number is encoded repeatedly, along the length of the stripe.
Yeah, all we need is a section of it.
our victim's last supper may tell us who he is.
no way!
you know this guy?
well, yeah, if it's the Larry LaMotte.
haven't you've seen his online ads?
how much would you pay "for peace of mind?
protect your identity with I. D.Preserve.
he owns a credit protection service.
for a monthly fee, they help protect your identity.
I just signed up last month.
since when do you worry about identity theft?
every aspect of our life has been reduced to binary code, Nick.
all we are is zeroes and ones.
easy pickins.
my name is Larry LaMotte, and I want to ask you a question.
how much would you pay for peace of mind?
well, the next few minutes may answer that question and...
it may change your life.
so, we checked Larry LaMotte's house.
no one home, and all his calls went to voicemail.
that's not a good sign.
good morning, gentlemen.
how can I help you?
I'm Detective James Brass, Las Vegas Police.
this is Dr. Ray Langston from the crime lab.
we're looking for Larry LaMotte.
Oh, I'm sorry. He's not available.
may I ask what this is concerning?
and you are?
Elaine Travers. I'm his executive assistant.
gentlemen, I'm Julius Kaplan. I'm Mr. LaMotte's Head of Security.
is there a problem?
no, no problem, Julius.
we think your boss may be dead, so we need to ask a few questions.
there must be some misunderstanding.
Mr. LaMotte is on vacation.
where?
at an undisclosed location, where, unfortunately, he can't be reached.
I'll say.
it's okay, Julius. I can handle this.
who are you?
I'm Larry LaMotte.
my name is Larry LaMotte, and I want to ask you a question.
how much would you pay for...
you're Larry LaMotte? - Yes. Now, did I hear you gentlemen correctly?
I'm dead?
you look younger on TV.
better-looking, too, right?
marketing 101.
you got something to sell, hey, get someone pretty to sell it, right?
and who is the man in front of the camera?
Wesley. Works in the mailroom.
Yeah, he can't string two sentences together, but put a script in front of him, suddenly, he's Brando.
so, gentlemen, what about this dead thing?
well, as I was, uh, telling Mr. Kaplan, we found a body shot in the head.
someone had force-fed him credit cards.
the credit cards were in your name.
my name?! - Yeah.
uh, I-I don't understand.
have your credit cards been lost or stolen?
did you know that every 79 seconds, someone has their identity stolen?
it can take years, thousands of dollars to get your good name back.
Mr. LaMotte, if someone has stolen your identity, and that person has ended up dead, that raises some serious questions for us.
like what?
well, if someone stole your identity, it can't be good for business.
I'm the victim here, Detective.
our company has thousands of subscribers.
corporate clients who depend on us to protect their data, their intellectual property.
this company made $120 million last year.
in other words, why would we risk all that in order to go after some penny-ante credit card thief?
well, that raises the possibility that whoever murdered our victim thinks they killed the real Larry LaMotte.
do you have any enemies, Larry?
thousands.
like you, I make it my mission to stop criminals.
you wear a badge, I wear the trust of every client who pays $19 a month to make sure that I'm watching.
it'd be a lot easier if you just got us a list.
the officers would like to take a look at our offenders files.
and please get two subscription packages ready.
don't worry. Our brothers in law enforcement get a discount.
Larry LaMotte had a lot of enemies, but they're all his clients.
Yeah, I see a couple of thousand have filed consumer complaints.
Yeah, subscribers claimed that instead of protecting their identities, the company stole them.
credit card numbers found their way to Nigeria.
and we know what happens in Nigeria doesn't stay in Nigeria.
I. D.-Preserve passed it off as "an unfortunate security breach.
but one guy didn't buy that excuse.
lee Devries, 34. Machinist.
he drove a truck right through the window of I. D.-Preserve.
starts waving a gun around, demanding face-time with Larry LaMotte.
six months in County.
he got out four weeks ago.
his first job out of the joint-- working at a temp agency that supplies workers to the shredder company.
sounds like somebody worth talking to.
I'll call Brass.
Nicky? - Yeah.
were you planning on telling me that, uh, you stopped seeing the departmental shrink?
Oh, I didn't think it was a big deal.
I went my mandatory two times.
I thought that we talked about this.
we did. I went.
that's it? You're done?
look, I've been getting in the gym, I've been eating right, getting good sleep.
healthy body, healthy mind, right?
I can't sit in a room and talk about how I feel from one minute to the next.
it's just not my thing.
sure about that?
positive.
so, Lee, where you been the last 72 hours?
run into Larry LaMotte by any chance?
I'm gonna make this simple.
have you put any bodies into any shredders lately?
all right, stand up. Stand up! Stand up!
back up. Back up.
sit over there.
all right, look...I'm going to be you.
a more cooperative you.
all right, Detective, all right. I'll tell you what happened.
now you know that I ran into Larry LaMotte.
you know my history with him.
I got jammed up, and I got arrested.
but as luck would have it, I got a second chance at him.
I gathered up that bastard, right?
I jammed credit cards down his throat.
I took out my gun, I popped a cap right in his brain, and I took that mess that used to be Larry LaMotte, and you know what?
I didn't know what to do with it, so, I put it in-in the shredder at my work.
that was the end of Larry LaMotte. Done.
questions?
I don't know what you're talking about.
that's not a question.
the guy destroyed my life.
I signed up with I. D.-Preserve 'cause I was scared somebody was going to steal my identity.
and the next thing I know, I got loans taken out in my name, I got mortgages, I got debts I can't even begin to pay.
hell, they even repossessed my truck right there in that scumbag's window.
you got an alibi?
six of 'em.
thanks to Larry LaMotte, there's a half dozen guys running around out there saying they're me.
you running the credit card we found in the D. B.'s stomach? - Yeah.
on the computer in the bullpen.
those are my numbers on my computer.
I'm checking my purchases.
ever since that whole I. D.-Preserve thing went shady, I got a little paranoid.
there are plenty of legit companies doing this, but...
I can't believe that I trusted those guys.
Yeah. It's like that friend that you meet in science camp, and you find that you have all the same interests, and you like to go to all the same movies, and do all the same things, and then one day, he offers to give you a haircut.
and you need one, so you figure, why not?
and then he starts showing you this sketchbook, and swears that he's done nude drawings of all his friends.
it's not the same.
Oh, of course not, no. I'm... I'm sorry, G. I'm just feelin' ya.
so, is this, uh, bullet fragment telling you a story?
once upon a time, a cranium met a nine-by-19 millimeter Parabellum round.
the end.
I found this other fragment in the mix.
it's tarnished, encased in fibrous tissue.
looks old.
the fragments from the bullet that went through Shredder Guy's head show polygonal rifling, consistent with a Glock.
now, this other fragment has conventional rifling.
so, the older fragment is from a different gun.
right, but could still come from the same victim.
how?
a previous incident.
it shows signs of encapsulation.
over time, the body's defense mechanism encapsulates the frag in tissue to protect against infection.
so far, we have nothing to identify our shredder guy.
maybe this shred of evidence will help.
it's at least worth a good cleaning.
so we sorted through the shredded items in the load with our dead body, and discovered something.
most of it can be traced back to one place.
let me guess: I. D.-Preserve.
so, I'm thinking, maybe the body is in one of these bins that I. D.-Preserve uses to send stuff to the shredder.
and maybe our friend Larry LaMotte's hands aren't so clean.
well, I bet that he would say that when these bins left his office, there was no body inside.
which is why I did some checking.
I. D.-Preserve uses a subcontractor to handle transport of its bins.
guess who runs that company?
Larry LaMotte's head of security.
let's light 'em up.
Oh, that's a lot of blood.
I think we just found our smoking bin.
I traced the credit card from our victim's stomach.
card was mailed to a P. O. box in Gallup, New Mexico.
which I'm guessing was under a phony name and address.
still, sounds like we found where our identity thief's from.
guy's pulling an old-school fraud.
new school stuff is way more high-tech.
I, uh, pulled the purchase records for our man from Gallup.
he bought a ticket here to Vegas. Once in town, he made a series of small-time purchases.
lucky for us, he wasn't shy.
maybe now our shredder guy has a face.
I'm running facial recognition, usual databases: military, DMV.
Langston and I just found blood in one of the bins from I. D.-Preserve.
it is a match to Shredder Guy.
we can't touch Larry LaMotte, but we can go after the man who touched the bins.
Julius Kaplan! Las Vegas Police!
we got a body.
end of the line for Julius Kaplan.
we found where Shredder Guy had his last meal.
maybe who served it up to him, too.
I got a feeling our friend here did some bad in the world.
maybe somebody conjured up some payback.
liver temp is 78. 5.
puts time of death at approximately 5: 00 p. m.
nice place, huh?
value just dropped another ten percent.
single shot, back to front.
slight upward trajectory.
round exited out the front.
fly ball to left...
going... going...
caught at the warning track.
a baseball reference. Charming.
blame Grissom.
looks like a . 45 auto.
six lands and grooves, left-handed twist.
consistent with a Colt pistol.
stellate tearing around the entry. Could be soot.
maybe some partially-burned black powder in the wound track.
contact wound.
killer put the gun right up to his head.
high-velocity spatter.
there's an odd void in the pattern.
Hey, who wants a beer?
I do. - I do.
our host has a fridge full in his kill room.
also found this Glock, and that's consistent with the gun that killed Shredder Guy.
what about Julius here?
well, the bullet that went through Kaplan's head says it's a different gun that killed him.
the neighbors across the street have a surveillance camera.
we might get lucky.
I think I just found our void.
looks like a match to me.
there's no sign of forced entry.
guy's sitting by the pool. Killer brings him a beer.
gets close enough to put a gun to his head.
kaplan knew his killer.
sure did.
seeing as this is a courtesy interview, uh, I assume counsel is not necessary, but, uh, I would like a record of the conversation.
make sure you take down every word.
Yes. Yes, sir.
I take it you've heard the news about your Head of Security, Julius Kaplan?
Yes, I have. And I am deeply saddened.
he was a good man.
he was hard worker. He was a stand-up guy.
well, not at the end.
as a matter of fact, not at the beginning, either, actually.
no, no. But I get the feeling that you knew about that.
so, we ran some prints.
your head of security, Julius Kaplan-- whose real name, by the way, is Julius Kirsch, also known as Julius Child.
and he got that nickname because he used to be a Mob collector who would make dinner for his victims.
but he would always add an extra ingredient, you know.
ground-up casino chips, a chopped-up credit card.
needless to say, I'm shocked.
we were also able to put a face to our mystery man from the shredder.
never seen him before.
he was dumped into a shredder from one of your shred bins.
well, I wouldn't know anything about that.
as you know, Julius dealt with the shredding company.
that's convenient.
gentlemen, I lost the same friend today twice.
obviously, Julius wasn't the man that I thought he was.
now, whatever wrongs he did-- that's on him.
I take this as a learning experience.
you know, it's like I say in my seminars.
assuming someone's name is easy.
assuming control of your life-- that's hard.
I'm checking the surveillance cam footage Nick got from the neighbor who's across the street from Larry LaMotte's security guy.
good news is, even though the camera's angled away so we can't see the driver, we do have an image of a car leaving the scene around the time of Julius' murder.
the bad news is that another car's passing at the same time, which obscures our view.
it's not a lot to work with, but I might be able to work a little magic.
stay with it. - Yeah.
ballistics confirms that the Glock I found on top of the can of clams was the gun that killed Shredder Guy.
Oh, we liked the French Chef for the deed.
no, Sara called that one right. It just wasn't the gun that killed Julius.
that was a Colt . 45 pistol. And that gun has a history.
slug matches a robbery/shooting in Reno six years ago?
Yeah, some guy was found in a Dumpster, barely alive.
paramedics rushed him to the E. R.
72 hours later, he just walks out of the hospital, vanishes.
John Doe.
so, Reno P. D. sent over the cold case file.
here is his shirt from the E. R.
these frags have some fuzz on them. Nobody's perfect.
kind of looks like a Chia Pet.
cartridge case from the shooting.
weren't able to pull a print, though, huh?
no, the only good thing about a case going cold is that technology has a chance to catch up.
might get something now.
okay, so we've got two shootings, six years apart.
Julius Kaplan and a John Doe in an alley shot with a Colt pistol.
there's got to be a connection somehow.
let's clean up these frags, see what we get.
all right, let me get this straight.
a partial bullet fragment from a previous injury lodged inside Shredder Guy is a perfect match to a round found in a John Doe six years ago?
shredder Guy and John Doe are the same person-- were the same person.
six years ago, Shredder Guy is shot in the alley, robbed and left for dead.
yet, he survives, skips town and disappears.
flash forward six years.
shredder Guy returns here to Vegas with Larry LaMotte's stolen identity.
but bad news for him, he runs into Julius Kaplan... who cooks him a special meal.
and then kills him with a Glock.
then someone kills Julius Kaplan, using the same Colt pistol that shot Shredder Guy six years ago in the alley.
two crimes, same shooter?
could be.
it doesn't make sense, Catherine.
shredder Guy had a credit card in Larry LaMotte's name sent to him in New Mexico, where he was living.
so, why would an identity thief come all the way to Vegas to commit fraud in Larry LaMotte's backyard?
right.
maybe he just wanted a free trip to Vegas on Larry's dime.
maybe he wanted Larry LaMotte to know he was in town.
either way, something else is going on.
I mean, Julius Kaplan said it himself. "Why kill a penny-ante thief?
he's not worth the risk.
well, he might be, if the thief is threatening to bring down the entire I. D.-Preserve empire.
facial recognition got a hit on Shredder Guy.
DMV in Florida had a ten-year-old driver's license on file.
check out the name.
shredder Guy is Larry LaMotte?
the real Larry LaMotte.
well, if he's Larry LaMotte, then who's Larry LaMotte?
see this cartridge case?
we pulled a six-year-old print off it.
it has all the personal information we need to identify you.
you have a very impressive CV.
burglary, fraud, and identity theft.
goodbye, Larry LaMotte. Hello, Arlo Karden.
Arlo Karden doesn't have the same ring to it, I'll give you that.
we searched your house.
guess what we found.
a Colt pistol.
the print on that cartridge casing puts you in an alley six years ago with, given his penchant for credit card fraud,
I'm guessing your old partner in crime. The real Larry LaMotte.
you thought you'd killed him.
you thought it was safe to use his name. Good name.
not in the system, like yours.
we, uh... searched your phone records.
you received calls from a prepaid cell, in Gallup, New Mexico.
I-I can just imagine, you know, the real Larry, you know, watching TV, and seeing some geezer making money off his name.
so he gets on the Internet, does a little search of the profiles of big-time CEOs, and then up pops a picture: You.
Larry called you up, offered you "peace of mind" for a price.
but you don't pay retail, so you get Julius Kaplan to get you a discount.
which only leaves one loose end.
here you go.
I didn't kill anyone.
Larry said he wanted five million dollars.
Yeah, yeah, we were partners back in the day.
hell, I figured after all that time, I mean, I... I owed him.
so I gave him the money.
I instructed Julius to deliver the cash.
after that, well...I think we all know what happened.
Yeah, everybody always blames the dead guy.
I'm not the same guy in that alley.
not anymore.
a man can change.
as far as that gun goes, that doesn't prove anything.
I got workers.
I got people coming in and out of that house all day long.
and as far as six years ago goes, my attorney informs me that, in the state of Nevada, the statute of limitations on assault, even with a gun, is two years.
Yeah, I shot Larry LaMotte.
I stole his name. I left him for dead.
but I only killed him once.
I checked with the bank. Arlo may be telling the truth, at least about one thing.
he made a withdrawal four days ago, five million in cash.
so, what, you think he's trying to pay off the real Larry?
Oh, it's possible.
maybe "Julius Child" went off-recipe and whacked the real Larry to keep the five mill for himself.
it would give Arlo motive to kill him. He wanted his money back.
well, one problem: We searched Arlo's house, Julius's house, I.D.-Preserve.
Where's the five million?
Oh, hey, Cath...I got something.
I used Digital Frame Averaging to process the surveillance footage we got from the neighbor across the street from Julius Kaplan's house.
program got us a partial plate.
car was rented two days ago by one Mr. Lee Devries.
that's the guy that drove his truck through the window of I. D.-Preserve.
guess he got a little payback.
brass sent units to Lee Devries' place. He wasn't there.
he didn't show up for work, either.
the neighbor said that he was visiting his girlfriend in Henderson.
well, if he's got a briefcase with five million dollars in it, he's heading to Mexico.
Yeah, Jim.
a patrol just spotted Devries's rental car.
heading south?
got it.
lee Devries! Las Vegas Police!
Devries, get out of the car!
step away from the car.
information is currency. That's what they say.
and you turned it into cold, hard cash.
the all-knowing executive assistant.
knows every phone call, every meeting, every e-mail, every intimate detail of the boss's life.
you knew the real Larry.
you knew about the blackmail.
you knew about your boss withdrawing five million bucks.
you even knew about "Julius Child" and his skills in the kitchen.
saw an opportunity for a little quid pro quo.
the thing about the "quo" is, it's a lot sweeter when you don't have to share.
he was a pig. Just like my boss.
and the "quid pro quo" started a long time ago.
except then, it was about holding on to my job.
honey, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
honey, can you pick up my dry cleaning?
sweetheart, can you come by my place tonight?" "I need a little help with something.
you used your boss's gun.
we spoke with Lee Devries. He confirms someone accessed one of his accounts.
you used his identity to rent a getaway car that you planned to dump at the border.
and with five million dollars missing, well... naturally, we'd be looking for Devries and not for you.
and thanks to I. D.-Preserve, you had all his credit card information.
easy peasy.
like you said, I know every detail about my boss's life.
his business, too.
he ruined a lot of lives.
people who trusted him, like Devries.
a little justice for all of them has got to be worth something.
information's currency, right?
Elaine Travers pled out, gave up her boss.
with all those defrauded clients, he's looking at identity theft times a thousand.
Larry Arlo, whoever the hell he is, he's not going to be getting much peace of mind over the next 12 years.
his fellow inmates better keep their hands in their pockets.
Hey, you out of here?
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna grab a beer or ten.
you want to join me?
I don't think so.
you sure? We can talk about our feelings.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't live in Kyrgyzstan, I've never even been to Kyrgyzstan, so how could I spend $1, 200 on snacks and a yurt?
it's unfortunate.
I mean, not only Greg's identity theft issues, but, uh, our man-date.
it's been postponed.
your mandate?
no, no, no. Not a mandate. It's a man-date.
it was actually Greg's idea.
um, we... meet at the same time every week, so that I can put Wendy behind me.
you know, so, uh, you look... very nice.
Thanks.
do you have plans?
Yeah.
well. Okay.
Hey, did you get a haircut?
uh, no. Why?
did, um... Did Greg happen to mention something, or...
no.
I mean, he might have mentioned something about a science camp.
but you know how people talk.
I could show you mine, but I think that might be inappropriate.
you hardly notice them.
scars?
of course... some scars heal faster than others.
I got a letter from Nate Haskell the other day.
he wanted to let me know that, uh, he was thinking about me.
the kidney bean?
Yeah.
don't let him get into your head, Ray.
well, he's already in there.
everything that happens to us, the good and the bad, is part of us.
took me a long time to realize that, uh...
it doesn't have to define who we are, We get to decide that.
good night, Dr. Ray.
good night, Sarah.
Hey, Nick.
Hey, there he is!
where are you heading?
well, if I don't go to the gym now, I won't go at all.
you feeling obligated to leave Doc Robbins a good-looking corpse?
Yeah, something like that.
Hey, you got a big day in court today, don't you?
Yeah. Nate Haskell.
putting my game face on.
well... I'd tell you to give him hell, but ths probably where he's going anyway.
good luck.
Thanks.
your Honor, I've spent the last three days in this courtroom trying to control myself, which has not been easy, I assure you.
the media has tried to portray me as some sort of monster, some seven-headed beast who sprang from a smoking pit to spread death across the land.
but here I sit, caged, before you, a man like any other man, with only one head, with two hands, and with a troubled heart.
objection.
is there a point here, Your Honor?
Mr. Haskell, I advise you to let your attorney do the talking.
but I object to that, Your Honor.
the jury needs to see the real Nate Haskell;
the vulnerable little boy who was sadistically abused by an alcoholic father.
for the record... that traumatized child still trembles in me.
I know there's some in this courtroom who can relate to my torment.
unfortunately, Your Honor, my attorney is not one of them.
you know, he doesn't even like me. - Your Honor!
the court has appointed him.
but I, I would like to un-appoint him.
see how he shies away from me. How can I trust him?
the only one who can speak for Nate Haskell is Nate Haskell.
Mr. Haskell. Are you asking to represent yourself?
I believe the legal term is pro per, Your Honor.
for the record, I think you're making a mistake.
but... so ordered.
let the record show that Mr. Haskell is now proceeding pro per.
but, I warn you, Mr. Haskell, there will be no delays in this trial.
Oh, excellent, Your Honor. Excellent.
I say...
let's get it on.
Stokes.
you said you wanted to be my friend.
Yeah, who's this?
you said you wouldn't let the cops kill my brother.
and then you empty your gun into him?
I should just let you die, like you did Alex.
how'd you get my number?
wait, they're coming. I gotta go.
whatever you do, don't go home.
control, this is Charlie 0-5 Stokes.
I'm at 922 Rose Avenue.
you, uh, better get the bomb squad out here.
code three.
frag grenade in a can.
pretty simple booby-trap.
kill zone up to five meters.
all right, Stokes.
back up, slowly.
might be more surprises.
I hope not.
I'm already eight lives down... if you know what I mean.
I hear you, brother.
right this way.
get off me! I'm all right.
no sign of forced entry. But we'll play it safe.
we'll sweep the rest of the house for any more explosives.
okay! I safetied the device.
I'll blow it and I'll send you what's left.
don't forget the trip-wire knot.
I'll send it in the package.
you can bronze it for Stokes.
along with this piece of his wall.
thus always to tyrants.
slogan for every whack job.
they came to my house!
that kid has my private number!
I tell you what - if they're looking for a fight, they found one.
I'm not afraid to die. Let's see if they are.
Nick, come on now. - I'm serious!
I know you're serious. Just dial it down. Come on.
did you see anything?
I don't know. There was a maroon van.
with, uh, uh, an extended cab on the roof- you know? -I didn't think anything of it.
neighbors saw that same van; it's gone.
you think they were sitting in that van, waiting for me to blow up?
you said that Jason McCann called you?
Yeah, I mean, I think that kid saved my life.
Nick, that kid should be in jail. He helped blow up a police funeral. Come on.
Yeah, the D. A. couldn't make the case back then.
now, all of a sudden, you've got a bomb that shows up on your doorstep, and he calls you... just in time.
no, it's no coincidence. Hail his ass in to PD.
thank you, Dr. Langston.
no further questions.
well, Ray, shall we... go back to the moment I stabbed you?
will you describe for the court and me...
how it felt...... when I plunged my shank into your kidney?
Objection! Irrelevant.
defense is indulging in gratuitous sadism.
question goes to state of mind, Your Honor, which is key to my defense.
overruled.
I'll allow it, for now.
well, Ray, how did it feel? - Painful.
can you be more specific? More...poetic?
you're a published writer, Ray.
describe the sensation when my shank first pierced your skin.
sharp. White-hot.
and after that... what did you feel?
lightheaded. Very lightheaded.
and as you laid down then, and your life was draining away, you gazed into my eyes.
what did you feel then, Ray? - Disbelief.
that's a thought. Give me a feeling.
fear.
what? - Fear.
you felt what? - I was afraid I was going to die.
Yes. A perfectly normal human reaction to a horrific experience.
Objection! - Sustained.
the defendant will confine himself to questioning the witness.
boring, but fine.
when I look at you, when I see the anguish I caused you, I feel... nothing.
Objection! Defense is testifying!
don't you think I want to feel something, Ray?
the emotions that a normal human being feels?
look at that: Steady, calm, emotionless.
that's just not right!
your Honor! This is outrageous.
sustained.
strike the defendant's last statement. The jury is instructed to disregard it.
no further questions, Your Honor.
bomber used a Z-type bowline on the grenade?
makes him a lefty.
most people don't tie anything more complicated than their shoes.
less than 15% of the population are lefties.
he added a half hitch to the end.
you know, it's weird.
it's the same signature that Alex McCann used on the bombs at the police funeral, and he's dead.
well, we know he wasn't acting alone.
what about his brother Jason? Maybe he's a lefty?
let's check LIMS.
doesn't say.
well, we're bringing him in.
I'm going to call Nick, and tell him to get his autograph, and maybe we'll get lucky.
it's a pretty nasty bruise. How'd you get that?
I fell.
I want to thank you for calling me when you did, or I wouldn't be here right now.
that took a lot of guts.
I'm sure there are some people out there who didn't appreciate it.
probably the same people who... put a grenade in my yard.
you give me a name... and I can help you.
I can't. They will kill me.
Dr. Huxbee.
just the guy I wanted to talk to.
I'm Jason McCann's legal guardian. I heard you pulled him out of school.
is he under arrest? - No.
then he's coming with me.
let's have a little chat first.
we have nothing to talk about.
Oh, you'd be surprised.
come on.
Oh, I saw Jason when he came in. Pretty nasty shiner the kid has.
so what happened?
he mouthed off, so you laid a little old-fashioned discipline on him?
Jason fell... skateboarding.
Yeah. Sure.
I checked out your file.
before you got your PhD in political theory, you were in the Coast Guard.
must have tied a few bowline hitches back then, huh?
is that where you learned to make bombs?
I told you before, I'm opposed to violence.
right. You just make them, you don't plant them.
that's too dangerous, too much shrapnel in the air.
do I need to call my attorney?
I came for Jason.
just sign this release.
then you can go back to your public speaking engagements where you trash this country that gives you the freedom to spew all your crap.
I know you're between a rock and a hard place here, but I'll protect you.
like you protected my brother, right?
Hey, your brother didn't give me a choice, man.
you think that makes it hurt any less?
let's go.
Hey, you still have my number.
he seems scared, but I can't read him, Jim.
you shot his brother. Why would he want to save your life?
grenade fragments had a story to tell.
found trace amounts of benzyl benzoate.
well, that's an acetone; it's not in grenades. - Exactly.
so if Nick's grenade were military issue, it would have been filled with Comp-B.
Acetone- that's one of the ingredients in triacetone- triperoxide, TATP.
that's the same explosive that Jason McCann's brother used to make pipe bombs.
so somebody is filling empty grenades instead of pipes.
well, you can buy empty grenades as commemoratives and fill them with any boom you want.
remember how Huxbee was bragging about living off the grid and ditching his plastic and all that?
well, looks like some bank made him an offer for a low-interest credit card even he couldn't refuse.
guy's become a shopaholic.
retail therapy can be very effective in relieving that Armageddon stress.
well, Huxbee's not buying a lot of sterno and camo, but he did buy serious quantities of acetone and pool acid.
maybe he was looking to start his own Armageddon.
thanks for coming.
Yeah, I hope we're not wasting your time here, Kip.
you kidding? I live for this.
so, Dr. Huxbee's old landlord didn't agree with his politics, so he booted him out of the old meeting hall, and Huxbee signed a new lease here.
credit cards, leases - gets the Doc back on the grid.
we got an R. O. on this truck?
Yeah, it's Huxbee's - so he must be inside.
LVPD. We have a warrant.
Huxbee? We need to talk.
got some blood here.
it's Huxbee.
he's dead.
guy just sprung Jason McCann from PD; now he's dead?
Where's Jason?
know, this scene looks a little too familiar.
dead body in the middle of a room?
body's wired. - Are you kidding me?
I don't see any explosives.
Oh, crap.
that can't be good.
you think?
what is it with you?
you some kind of a bomb magnet?
all right, guys, let's get out of here.
the whole place might be rigged.
retrace your steps.
hang on.
what is that? Looks like some kind of sensor.
Yeah.
you're not gonna like this.
one door in, one door out.
we're not going anywhere.
control, KA-135.
we have a bomb at 3027 Rosemont Boulevard.
control, ...
radio's dead. - What?
phone, too. - Seriously?
must be jamming the signals.
fantastic. We're on our own.
well... come on, man, you're the rock star here.
time to start playing, bud. Let's go.
Photo-sensor chip under the DB armed the bombs and lasers.
we break any of those beams, that much C-4 is gonna take us all out.
we got to diffuse this bad boy.
we? - Yeah.
how are we going to get to it?
I'm still working on it.
keyless car entry receiver circuit.
fob transmitters probably connected to the lasers.
that clock says 14 minutes?
that's a lifetime.
to disarm it, or is that just what we've got left?
both.
Dr. Corey, two weeks ago you brought a mobile MRI machine to Ely State Prison to conduct a test on me.
Yes. I...scanned your brain while you were shown a series of crime photographs.
describe the photos.
they were graphic, uh, extremely violent.
images of mutilated and dismembered bodies.
what happens, Doctor, to the average person's brain when they're shown such images?
this... is the orbital cortex.
it governs, uh, moral decision making, aggression, impulse control.
it's lit up like a Christmas tree. It's so beautiful, Doctor.
well, it's because it's being stimulated.
clearly, the, uh, subject was deeply disturbed by the images.
and how does this compare to a scan of... my orbital cortex?
well... as you can see, yours is pitch black; there is no activity.
your orbital cortex is profoundly impaired.
doctor, do you know what caused this... this defect?
you possess a genetic mutation: the Monoamine Oxidase A, or MAO-A gene.
otherwise known as the warrior gene, for its association with aggression.
doctor, what is the significance of this warrior gene for someone like me?
well, according to numerous studies, if you suffered severe childhood abuse and possessed this gene, it increases your chances of committing a violent crime by... four hundred percent.
doctor, you complete me, or at least you complete my understanding of me.
objection. - I know, counsel is testifying.
sustained, sustained.
Mr. Haskell, I've given you a lot of leeway because you're pro per, but if you try to do my job again, I will hold you in contempt.
so, Dr. Corey, it is your expert opinion that I cannot be held responsible for my actions, for any of them?
that is correct.
so it is true what they say, that I am a monster, but a monster made of biology beyond my control.
so convicting me of attempted murder would be like convicting a blind man of being unable to see.
who's the real victim here?!
Mr. Haskell!
who's the real victim?
bomb out of reach, clock facing us - they want us to see how much time we have left, force our hand.
Yeah, that's 'cause they're watching us.
they want to see us sweat.
Yeah, here we go.
they've been a step ahead of us this whole time.
Yep.
well... they want to play with lasers, I'll give them lasers.
all right, guys, ideas?
well, we can't go through the beams, so maybe we go over them.
Yeah, there's plenty of pallets and lumber.
Yeah. Yeah, enough to build a stairway to Heaven.
No!
you don't want to be next.
that goes for you, too, Stokes.
nine-mil cartridges set into the wood. Nails as firing pins.
very smart.
Yeah, smarter than me.
all right, you're good along that line.
it's bad, isn't it?
he may have nicked an artery.
I'm gonna apply some pressure.
it's gonna hurt.
sorry.
God, I hate it when you're right.
we want to get out here, we better start stacking.
all right, you guys go for it. I'm gonna stay with Lou.
careful what you pick up.
Yeah, copy that.
you should find more compassion in your heart for Nate.
the man has a disease.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I see.
did Nate give you that pendant? - Yes.
I wonder if you understand the significance of it.
Oh, Nate's a very spiritual man.
I was referring to his first two victims, Joel Steiner and Tiffany Cohen.
they both wore identical Stars of David.
they were two young people very much in love, just starting out in life, when he kidnapped them, murdered Joel, so that he could rape and torture Tiffany at his leisure.
well, you heard that expert; he's not responsible for his actions.
besides, the love of a good woman can change any man.
now, why don't you tell that to the seven women that we found buried under his floorboards?
join the prayer circle.
I see you've met the Brides of Haskell.
they're all wearing identical Stars of David.
well, serial killers have groupies, Ray.
well, they may not be the only ones listening to this psychobabble.
you should have seen the jury listening to his expert witness, this Dr. Corey.
Haskell's going to try and use the MAO-A defense to get all of his convictions overturned, Jim.
that's a long shot, Ray.
you heard of Willie Sutton, bank robber, right?
right. Sentenced to over 100 years.
studied civil rights law in jail.
got all of his convictions overturned.
he died a free man.
captain Brass?
ready for testimony.
okay, my turn on the hot seat.
see you later.
Hey, stay with me.
we're gonna get you out of here. We're all gonna get out of here.
all right, Kip. Once you're in, you're in.
you ready, wild man?
if I were you, I'd stick that landing, bud.
you're good.
all right.
clock's ticking.
big capacitors.
just a come-on.
you know, I don't think Huxbee or Jason McCann pulled this off.
you might want to find some shelter.
all we got is plywood. That's no good against C-4?
it can't hurt.
all right. I'll be right back.
we got to get him to cover.
can you sit up for me, Lou?
I got it.
piece of cake.
stay strong, Lou.
Ah, hell. - What? What?
mercury switch.
that doesn't sound good.
Anti-tampering device.
works on gravity.
normally I'd cut the main power, but this baby's got a collapsing circuit.
translation?
I cut the power lead, it triggers the bomb.
I've got to cut these two conductors separately, make sure the wires don't touch.
all right.
you get to cover.
hell, no, man. I'm staying right here with you.
Ah, you're the wild man.
less than a minute.
plenty of time.
45 seconds.
first cut.
second cut.
it stopped.
I hate to disappoint you, Stokes, but you're not dying today.
Damn! Good job.
let's get him to a hospital.
you're my hero, man.
he got it. He got it. We're good. We're good, Lou.
come here. It's all right
get down!
over here.
I got three people down.
one female in a CSI vest.
requesting two additional paramedics.
it's okay. We're gonna get you out of here.
one of my victims has life-threatening injuries.
so Nick and Catherine are all right?
and what about Vartann?
good. Listen, Greg, get the name of his attending for me so I can follow up after.
Oh, um, batter up. Got to go.
thanks for letting me know.
so, as a medical doctor, what is your opinion about Dr. Corey's theory that individuals with the MAO-A gene are predisposed to violence?
it is my opinion that it is utter nonsense.
sure, there have been several studies that claim that there's a link between the MAO-A gene and violent behavior, but there are just as many studies that dispute those findings.
Dr. Corey's conclusions are not neuroscience.
they're neuropathology.
could you give us an example?
alcoholics are genetically predisposed to alcoholism, which is a known disease, but we don't give drunks a pass if they decide to get behind the wheel of a vehicle and kill people.
the law is interested in whether or not a person understands the difference between right and wrong, and the defendant knows the difference between right and wrong.
he takes pleasure in committing sadistic crimes that he knows are against the law.
the fact that he has tried to cover up those crimes is evidence of his consciousness of guilt.
no further questions, Your Honor.
I have nothing but questions.
Dr. Langston, are you a psychiatrist? - No.
a neurologist? - No.
a geneticist? - No. My field is research pathology.
then you have no expertise in this area at all, correct? - No.
no? You mean yes.
you just testified to a complete lack of credentials.
so, on what would you base any expertise?
personal experience.
like you, I was abused by an alcoholic father as a child, and, like you, I have the MAO-A gene.
DNA isn't destiny.
we're all responsible for our own actions.
I share the same gene with you, Nate, but I've never murdered anyone.
I take satisfaction in bringing justice to victims, not killing them and torturing them.
which is the only way that you can feel any connection to another human being.
don't you think that was a little below the belt, Ray?
welcome back.
the doctors patched you up. You're going to be okay.
but Kip didn't make it.
did we get them?
we will.
thanks... for being here.
where else would I be?
you get some rest.
I'll be back.
okay.
how's he doing?
good, I think.
how you doing?
I'm still in one piece.
Yeah, you should probably get checked out anyway.
that's usually my line.
Hey, you're always taking care of me.
how about I take care of you for a change?
okay.
Thanks, Nicky.
sometime between being bludgeoned and the postmortem blast injuries,Huxbee managed to get himself shot in the head.
single GSW, execution style.
were you able to recover the bullet?
nine millimeter hollow-point.
ballistics sent over a report.
gunshot was overkill.
blunt force trauma was the cause of death.
ibis hit.
the same gun was used in a break-in at a National Guard armory in Salt Lake nine months ago.
what did they take?
couple of M-9s...
20 pounds of C-4.
you know, the armory is not our only link to the military.
I ran the serial number on the camera from the warehouse.
it was purchased two years ago at an Army PX in Black Rock Arsenal, Virginia.
the buyer paid cash.
maybe at the PX in Virginia, but not at Meyer's Hardware Store in North Las Vegas.
I just ran Huxbee's recent credit card purchases.
guess who swiped his plastic.
that's definitely Jason McCann on the left.
using Huxbee's card, or a card he took out in his name.
to buy bomb-making materials.
okay, so, Mr. Non-Violence loses his temper, gives Jason the back of his hand.
explains Jason's bruise in P. D.
then Huxbee springs him, tells Jason that he's a threat to their movement.
it's got to stop.
so Jason decides Huxbee's got to stop.
breathing, that is.
we know that he didn't make the bomb alone.
let's push in on this guy.
army field jacket.
to wear a jacket Thin with his name on it?
ugh Let's check him against all personnel at Black Rock Arsenal for the last two years.
Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict?
we have, Your Honor.
in the case of Nathaniel Haskell, Case Number 20433, Clark County Criminal Court.
as to the count of attempted murder, the jury finds the defendant guilty.
it's an injustice.
the whole world is watching.
sentencing will be on February 28.
this court is now adjourned.
well done.
thanks to you.
so, Greg was able to I. D. the guy in the hardware store with Jason McCann.
his name is Timothy Johnson.
specialty 89 Delta?
that's explosive ordinance disposal.
Yeah. And a less-than-honorable discharge two years ago.
according to Nevada DMV, he owns a maroon Chevy van.
Jason's been playing me this whole time.
calling me, acting like he's trying to save my life was just bait to get me,
Catherine and Vartann in that building at the same time, so he could blow us all to smithereens.
and Kip's the one who paid for it.
you know, it was all three who took his brother down.
Damn! How could I not see that, Sara?
now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw the tripwire.
that's the important thing.
you know what I want to know?
is Jason pulling the strings, or is someone else pulling his strings?
well, we thought it was Huxbee.
it's got to be this dude, Johnson.
well, we got to find them; they still have a lot of C-4.
okay, what about that DMV address?
it's no good. Greg ran it.
the guy used an abandoned house; it's the end of the line.
maybe not.
kids and their phones.
that dumb-ass called me.
I think he deserves a call back, don't you?
Hello? - Hey, Jason.
it's Nick Stokes. How's it going?
bet you weren't expecting to hear from me, were you?
no, actually, I wasn't.
maybe we should just continue our conversation right now, what do you think?
I mean, we were interrupted. I think we have a lot to talk about, don't you?
come on, talk to me, you little punk.
I don't think he likes you anymore.
Oh, he's gonna like me a lot less, believe me.
I got the cell tower.
CT-16, south receiver, 22 miles west of Searchlight.
not too many people out there.
probably not a lot of maroon vans, either.
captain Brass, Air One here.
got a visual?
affirmative.
maroon van, two WMA's matching suspect's description.
hang back. Maintain visual.
this is Charlie-O-five. What's their position, Air One?
just turning west onto State Route 164.
Hey, they're headed for California, Jim.
we take 95 south, we can cut them off.
just try to keep up.
the last cage on the left.
thank you.
Hi, Ray.
You...were magnificent on the witness stand.
that MAO-A revelation of yours...delightfully unexpected.
you know, a good lawyer never asks a question that he doesn't have the answer to.
beware the sin of pride, Ray.
but I feel it was a positive experience, because now I feel even closer to you.
discovering we share more than just your kidney.
do you have chills, Ray?
no. Steady. Calm.
question, though.
how long have you known that you were an MAO-A gene carrier?
you heard Dr. Corey, Ray - months, maybe... maybe longer.
no, you must have known before your first kill.
my first human kill.
you talk about a good excuse to start having some fun, huh?
Oh, Ray... it's like a mirror with you.
it's like playing with myself, only... better.
so, how long have you known?
ray, you know my job history and that I never, ever had one in my life.
so I had to have income.
blood donations, sperm bank, the odd psychological research study -those cute grad students, they pay good money.
the first studies on the MAO-A gene didn't happen until the 1970s.
how did you know, Nate?
I wanted to be the first kid on my block to have one, Ray, so I could blame everything on my father.
I just prayed to God to bring me one of those genes, Ray.
you can't alter your DNA. You either have the gene or you don't.
trust me, Ray... if you want something bad enough, you can will it to happen.
look at those women; they fight over me, Ray.
it's cause I will it.
you're really giving yourself a little bit too much credit.
no, I'm a chick magnet, Ray, and you know that.
you're a magnet for the walking wounded.
look at you in this cage. You're pathetic.
whatever.
you know what I dream of more than sex, Ray?
what?
freedom.
I bet you do.
you've killed 14 people.
there's no gene that's gonna magically make you free, not for that.
power of positive thinking, Ray.
and I'm very positive.
I thought you were smarter than your brother, huh?
but you had to make it personal.
it's always been personal.
they killed my brother; now they're gonna pay.
well, you think you're the only guy who lost someone?
I've had more friends bleed out in my arms in the middle of a damn sandbox than I can count, but at least I know what I'm fighting for - real freedom.
stop talking to me like I am some kid.
I brought you in!
I taught you everything, you little punk!
not just how to make bombs but how to bring this freedom fight home, stay alive, live to fight another day and not go strength against strength and take on the whole damn LVPD.
you're just gonna get us killed, kid.
I'm not afraid.
stop the car. Stop the car!
what are you doing? Run it!
shut the hell up.
Johnson! McCann! Get out of the car!
I'm not dying today.
don't quit on me.
throw your weapons out the window, and step out of the car now.
got no choice. Look at all those guns.
shut up!
you're surrounded! Get out of the car!
I'll give up, but only to Stokes.
don't even think about it.
Yeah, I'm right here. So give up.
I want to talk to you.
we'll talk. Get out of there!
Jase, look at me. Live to fight another day, remember?
get out.
I'm coming out!
get your hands on your head, turn around and get down on your knees!
get down on your knees!
McCann, get out of the car!
throw the weapon out!
hands on your head!
get down on your knees!
he's wired! He's got a bomb!
he's lying! There's no bomb! Look!
don't shoot! Don't shoot!
No!
hold your fire.
I need to see Nate Haskell. I need to see him right away.
okay.
Hey, Haskell?
your buddy's...
what the...
Hey, inmate, get up.
show us your wrist band.
he switched them.
so where is he?
a minimum-security van just left about ten minutes ago.
Nate! Now we can finally...
let's take my car.
Oh, your hands are so cold.
Oh, we'll fix that.
let's get out of here! Come on!
come on.
you see an address?
man, I don't even see any houses.
I didn't know they had this much farmland outside of Vegas.
welcome to Nessus.
half a dozen slot machines, one blackjack table and manure...lots and lots of manure.
I can't see it, but I can sure smell it.
Nick, I'm telling you, we passed the crime scene.
no, no, just keep going. I've had plenty of 419s out here.
what's up with this GPS?
holy cow!
you know, you kill one of those in India, you spend six months in jail.
control, this is Langston.
we're lost.
what took you guys so long? You hit a cow or something?
better not. They're 1, 600 bucks apiece.
and they don't milk when they're riled.
Where's the body?
I'll show you.
watch your step there.
farmer went camping at the Virgin River.
came back tonight to feed the cows, and saw this.
Ah, manure with hint of decomp.
well, it's definitely got legs, but no hands.
first generation, third instar larvae.
been dead 96-plus hours.
white female adult.
that's not all we have.
killers sometimes remove the head and hands to avoid identification.
don't usually dump 'em with the body.
I don't think this is her hand.
it's too thick. The ridges are wide.
tells me it was a male.
Yeah, so's this.
we're gonna have to go through this whole haystack, see if we can find the rest of them.
it's easier than looking for needles.
What?! Yeah, be right there.
sorry, Nick, gotta go.
Hey, where you going?!
we're gonna have to search this whole farm!
think you just lost your ride.
I'll handle it.
I know you're starting to question your commitment to your job, Ray.
and I don't think I'm the only one.
your friend Haskell surfaced.
I thought I left you enough bread crumbs to follow.
did I need to make a video, Ray?
I'm getting tired of doing all the work in the relationship.
and, you know, when I feel unwanted, bad things happen.
maybe you're just afraid to catch me.
maybe you don't like looking in the mirror, Ray.
maybe you don't like what you see.
maybe you don' 't like looking in the mirror, Ray.
where did you get this?
Vivian Tinsdale's parents.
Vivian Tinsdale. One of Haskell's brides.
Yeah. You walked in at the end of the movie.
you need to see the opening.
please, Daddy, I'm sorry, but you're the only one who can save me.
daddy, he's done things to me!
and the things he says he's gonna do...
please, Daddy, whatever he wants, just pay him!
when did they get this?
four days ago.
she's probably already dead.
Mr. Tinsdale, it took you four days to come forward with this video?
who are you? - Ray Langston.
I've been investigating Nate Haskell for two years.
why didn't you come forward sooner?
well, my computer marked Vivian's e-mails as spam.
I didn't see them until last night.
that's still 24 hours ago.
officer, we haven't spoken to Vivian in years.
she's a stranger to us.
now she's asking for our help.
so you're saying you don't care?
listen, my daughter is mentally ill. She's a sociopath and a pathological liar.
how do you explain the bruises on her face?
well, I assume they're self-inflicted.
so you're saying the video's a scam?
I'm saying that the only time we ever hear from our daughter is when she's asking for money.
she's not getting another dime.
you have the video. My husband and I are going to go.
look, that video and your daughter are our only link we have to an escaped serial killer.
if you're right and Vivian is only interested in money, you'll get a call from Haskell.
when that call comes, we need to be there.
we all want the same thing: we don't want Nate Haskell to kill your daughter.
or anyone else.
now please help us.
Hey, Nick.
please, don't ask me if I need a hand.
actually, I was gonna tell you you smell like a Porta Potti.
thank you, sir.
obvious sharp-force trauma.
crushed and cut carpals.
skin on the anterior aspect of the wrist looks like it's been pulled and snapped from the forearm.
my guess is the killer got a little happy with a hand ax.
so you think this guy was alive when his hands waved good-bye to the rest of his body?
well, no contusions around the cut.
postmortem hack job.
go ahead and print.
no, these fingers are too dehydrated.
I'm gonna have to PVS them.
if you compare his hand to her wrist, there are similar crushing and cutting injuries to the radius and ulna.
same tool, same killer.
video camera's clock and GPS were turned off.
no metadata.
no way to tell when or where it was shot.
mm, the video was e-mailed to the Tinsdales. You should be able to trace that.
working on it.
Haskell bounced it around the Web a half-dozen times.
well! Deputy Chief Curtis.
the shield looks good on you.
congrats on the promotion.
Thanks, Archie.
you must be Ray Langston. Sofia Curtis.
nice to meet you.
just got the nod from the sheriff to head up the Haskell task force.
FYI, I'm calling in the feds.
that might not be the best move.
we've had sightings of Haskell from Bangor to San Diego.
we got reason to believe he's crossed state lines.
that makes it federal.
what about the video? The Tinsdales live here in Vegas.
why demand a ransom and then not stick around to collect it?
Haskell made no specific demand for money.
so, even if it's not about money, it's about the Tinsdales.
that connects him to Vegas.
we both know how this works.
the lab will still process the evidence. You're not relinquishing control.
this video is the first solid lead we've had in months.
unless you got proof that Haskell's still in state, I'm making the call.
got it.
Haskell must be getting some I. T. support.
he uploaded the video from a open Wi-Fi hot spot near the Vegas Motor Speedway.
I know him. I knew I was right.
you got lucky today.
police officers at the Tinsdale house just intercepted a call from Haskell.
I got him on the line now. Run a trace.
Yes, sir, running it now.
Avery, pencils ready? Just give me a second.
now, you really should be better prepared for this kind of thing, Avery.
I hope you're not stalling so my good friend Ray Langston can trace this.
maybe I should hang up right now.
no, don't. I'm here.
Provenzi Park, 5:30, bench by the playground. No cops.
you hear that, Ray?
"no user information." Disposable phone.
he's probably disposed of it already.
shout-out from Haskell.
the man does like sticking it to you.
all right, 5:30. That gives us two hours.
well, thank you for showering.
well, I didn't necessarily do it for you, but you're welcome.
got a C. O.D. Yet?
no. I don't even have a head.
torso's fairly fit, rules out most natural causes.
can anything else help us get an I. D. On her?
appendectomy scar.
cervix shows no prior pregnancies, no tattoos, no implants, but small scar on the abdomen could be from liposuction.
left femur has an old radial fracture.
slight calcification. Early to mid-30s.
woman in her 30's, appendectomy, lipo and a busted leg.
all you need now is a name.
I just got a hit off one of the hands. Came back to a Graham Kole.
Greg DMV'd him, got an address. It's a doctor's office.
plastic surgeon with his hands cut off, huh?
maybe he messed up some psycho hooker's boob job.
Yeah, what kind of a surgeon works out of a strip mall next to a taco joint?
well, we got a warrant.
we do, don't we?
there's the head, neck, arms and rest of Dr. Kole.
two blood pools...
two victims.
good chance this is our primary.
Mr. Tinsdale. Mr. Tinsdale, if you can hear me, please cough.
okay, we're good.
I don't think it's his cell phone.
tell him to answer it.
Mr. Tinsdale, please find that phone and answer it.
hold it up to your right ear so I can record the caller's voice in your earpiece.
Hello?
the other ear. The right ear. Tell him the right ear.
what's he doing?
Mr. Tinsdale, switch sides, please. Your other ear.
wait a minute. You're breaking up.
Yeah, there, I can hear you.
too bad we can't.
that wasn't the deal.
I did what you asked.
Where's Vivian? I want to talk to her right now.
Yes, I see it.
it's the pink one?
Yes, I have it.
all right, I understand.
well, happy big birthday, baby. He better hope that's not a bomb.
he's being directed.
scan the park.
turn to the woman by the playground.
I think she's got eyes on Tinsdale.
Archie, give me a better look.
Damn! That's Tina Vincent!
it's a bride!
he spotted us. Suspect now on foot, running southbound.
LVPD! Down on the ground! Now!
she's gone!
out of the way!
where is he?!
Where's Nate?
where is he?!
ray! Hey, Ray!
where is he?
what were you doing in the park, Tina?
what do people do in parks?
walk dogs. Walk themselves.
I find it very...soothing.
I find it very coincidental given your relationship with Nate Haskell.
relationship? No.
I admire him.
I admire his courage because he's clearly a victim of the justice system that is bent on persecuting him for crimes he could not commit.
you were present at his recent trial along with Vivian Tinsdale what's your relationship with her?
she disgusts me.
and I think she's a bad influence on Nate.
it sounds like you've seen Vivian and Nate recently.
my client didn't say that. Don't put words in her mouth.
I couldn't if I tried.
where is Nate Haskell now? Where's Vivian?
are you aware that she's been kidnapped?
my client's told you what she knows.
last I checked, a walk in the park is not a crime.
but a cop beating up on an innocent civilian is.
I'll be in touch.
Oh, your prisons couldn't hold Nate.
he willed himself to be free.
tell Ray Langston he'll never catch him... not until Nate wills it.
where is Hodges?
uh, he's moving out of his mother's place... finally.
I'm not sure who's more traumatized.
is, uh, is that the package from the park?
I heard Haskell. Left you a present.
it's evidence.
I assume it's been X-rayed?
Yes, the Bomb Squad scanned it. I just checked it for trace.
I need to print it. Where's Mandy?
uh, Denver. Conference.
you're in luck. I've worked in every forensic discipline except QD.
too many paper cuts.
let me help you. You do the box, I'll do the tape.
ray, the size says probably male.
he left it dead center.
exquisite ridge detail.
sloppy, sloppy.
not sloppy. Intentional.
it's Haskell's way of signing the package. Run it anyway.
do you recognize this man?
Yeah, I sure as hell do.
Where'd you get that?
who is he?
that's Jack. That's Jack York.
it was Vivian's first husband.
this was in the box you gave me.
you have any idea why Nate Haskell wanted you to give me this photograph?
no, I don't.
tell us about Jack York.
well, he was just one in a long line of men that took advantage of Vivian.
except this one she married.
only lasted a few months.
where is he? We'd like to talk to him.
well, I can't help you. He took off.
I mean, Jack was bad news. He didn't love Vivian, only her money.
that day in the park, what did you and Haskell talk about?
well, I could only hear about half of what he was saying.
that wasn't the deal! I did what you asked. Where's Vivian?
sounds like you two had a conversation.
he was yelling at me, making demands. Most of it was about you.
"that wasn't the deal." That sounds like it was about you, pal.
I told you what I know.
he made no demands for ransom? He gave you no instructions?
we have a warrant for your computer, bank records, cell phone and credit cards.
we're going to take a very long look at everything in your life.
this blood's dry and flaky.
it's days old.
matches the time line of the maggots I found on the bodies.
no bone chips, no bone fragments.
not enough blood to suggest dismemberment.
they might have been killed here, but they were probably cut up somewhere else.
small blood trace. Looks like he just stripped these off.
you know, I think Dr. Kole might have been seeing a patient right before he became one of these blood pools.
got a chart.
medical sticker's been ripped off.
it's empty.
maybe the patient had something to do with this.
okay, so, the patient kills the doctor and the nurse?
if the doctor was working on someone with the nurse by his side, this second blood pool's probably hers.
and the spider trajectory points back to the doorway, and not to the patient.
maybe the shooter.
a little groggy, huh? - You're looking good.
Hey, what are you doing here?
bullet... looks like a nine mill.
I don't see any cartridge casings.
well, one of the victims was definitely shot. There's tissue on the bullet.
through and through.
we need to get this back to the lab, see if the tissue on the bullet matches the hands or the torso.
uh, Ms. Kole?
I'm CSI Stokes. I'm very sorry for your loss.
boy, is my life starting to look up.
I need to get your fingerprints.
if you can get past these, be my guest.
we'll see what we can do. Why don't you have a seat for me?
by the way, I didn't kill my crappy husband.
well, if you didn't kill your crappy husband, who do you think did?
did you know that Vegas is the fugitive capital of the world?
I didn't know that. - Yeah.
right hand, please.
and, uh, Graham did a few, um, faces, if you know what I mean.
I get it.
do you? - Yeah. Please.
so, when was the last time that you saw Graham?
when he told me to turn my vibrator down.
he didn't speak to me for weeks.
it was a Monday, so it must have been about five days ago.
and when he didn't come home, how come you just didn't call the police?
because I knew where he was.
he was either at the Wynn or the Encore.
and why would he stay at a hotel if he's got a house here in town?
because he doesn't have a vibrator.
and he would be bringing home the real thing.
and then I would be up all night long listening to nothing but, "Oh! Oh, God. Oh, Graham, you're the best."
Oh, gosh, there's nobody like you.
guys like fake.
some guys do. - Oh, okay.
and do you have any idea who this affair might have been with?
Nursey Newtox.
you know what you need to do? - Tell me.
you need to put up "Wanted" Posters of a girl who looks just like me... minus 20 years...
with a touch of silicon, a dash of collagen, rhino, Botox and lipo, and the perkiest double-D's you've seen this side of the Hoover Dam.
and this nurse, does she have a name? - Teagan.
I mean, who has a name like Teagan? Right?
give me a break.
I got a name on Kole's nurse.
I ran her through the DMV. I'm heading over there right now.
should be able to pull some exemplars for DNA.
you all right, bud?
the bullet that we found at Kole's office is a match to the gun used during Haskell's escape.
whoa, wait a minute.
now, that gun was fired by one of Haskell's brides.
and if the gun was at Kole's office, one of the brides was there.
and the brides go... where Haskell goes.
if Haskell was at that office, do you think there's a chance he had some plastic surgery, changed his face?
and killed the doctor and his nurse to cover his tracks.
if we're right about this, Haskell could be just another face in the crowd.
which means we don't know who we're looking for anymore.
here's what we have: Haskell's out there, and he may have a new face.
well, the new face is a game changer.
I'm sick of this guy. He's like the Joker in Batman.
except without the laughs.
we have no hard evidence that puts Haskell at the plastic surgeon's.
that may be wishful thinking.
ballistics only puts a gun, used by one of Haskell's brides, at the scene.
after the trial, I saw all of Haskell's brides, including Tina, in the parking lot.
the only ones that weren't there were Robin and Vivian.
well, we know it wasn't Robin that talked to Kole, because she was popped during the escape.
most likely by Vivian after she shot the four prison guards.
if Vivian is Bonnie to Haskell's Clyde, why is Haskell holding her for ransom?
he's not.
the timeline's wrong.
while Daddy's getting a video of his little girl begging for her life, Vivian is off killing the doctor and the nurse.
so Haskell and Vivian are working together.
there was no kidnapping.
so why the dog-and-pony show at the park?
I don't know, but it must have something to do with Haskell sending me this photograph of Vivian's ex.
well, Tinsdale knows, but he's not talking.
Hey, Archie.
be right there.
we may not need Tinsdale.
what have you got, Archie?
Yeah, well, Tinsdale didn't help us out at the park, but his computer is helping us out plenty.
that video file he brought in wasn't the first message he got from Haskell.
you got to be kidding me. - Nope.
I pulled this off of deep memory. Must've thought he deleted it.
when did this video file come in? - One week before the one he showed us.
put it up, put it up, put it up.
I'm sorry I can't get a better image quality here.
you have been so generous with me already, Avery, giving me your daughter.
she is such a fragile flower.
and we both know why.
she's told me some secrets.
very naughty, Avery.
yet the more I hear about you, the more I like you. You're my kind of guy.
but not everyone is as open-minded as I am, Avery, so you're gonna have to open your wallet.
it's so tawdry to talk about amounts, but how about $2 million?
that's it.
now we know why Haskell made no ransom demand and why Tinsdale showed no real interest in getting his daughter back.
this is all about blackmail.
Haskell had already been paid.
secrets between father and daughter.
clearly, Vivian's bad taste in men started early.
if Tinsdale wanted to hide his dirty little secret, why would he come forward?
because Haskell forced him to.
I pulled Tinsdale's bank records.
he withdrew $2 million, in cash, five days ago.
told the bank manager it was for some offshore investment deal.
he lied to us.
he just bought Haskell $2 million worth of freedom, the son of a bitch.
I know where you're going, Ray.
don't try to stop me, Catherine!
okay, then go ahead. You'll be doing exactly what Haskell wants you to do.
Haskell sent you Jack York's photo for a reason.
York disappeared right after he married Vivian.
he came between father and daughter.
maybe Tinsdale killed him.
Vivian knew about it.
she told Haskell.
this is a game.
this is a dance between you and Haskell.
Haskell isn't talking to Tinsdale on the video.
he's talking to you.
catch me if you can. Well, he wants to play...
what do you want me to do, boss?
you don't do this alone.
we go after Haskell together.
Mrs. Tinsdale, are you all right? What happened?
my husband's in the study.
he's dead.
.38 special.
so, you think it's suicide or an assist from the wife?
I'm checking both for GSR.
contact wound.
single exit to the back of the head.
the pattern on the wall is consistent with an upward angle.
bullet exited the head and entered the wall.
the blood on Mrs. Tinsdale is probably transfer from embracing him.
well, why kill himself now? He already paid Haskell $2 million for his silence.
take a look around. Maybe Haskell wanted more money.
didn't we take his computer, Jim?
he bought himself a new one.
looks like new video.
Avery, I know we had a deal. I really appreciate the money.
financial security in... in midlife is so important.
but, Avery, the... the home movies that Vivian has shown me... not the... family trip to Washington.
the other one.
you know, I'm not a... fan of the police or the church, but what you did was a sin.
so I do have to file-share it with my friends in uniform. I have no choice.
Oh, and, Ray... there is a moral to this story.
it wasn't his fault.
he didn't want it.
excuse me?
she came to him.
Vivian... was a child.
you were her mother. It was your job to protect her.
do you think it's strange that I gave birth to the true bride of my husband?
did you, uh, you got the DNA results?
are you sure you got all the body parts that were out at that farm?
I'm sure I'm not gonna like what you're about to tell me.
well, the major blood pool from Kole's office matches exemplars from Dr. Kole.
okay.
the secondary blood pool plus the tissue from the bullet you pulled out of the wall is a match to the nurse.
go on.
the DNA from the nurse is not a match to your torso.
but if that torso isn't the nurse, then who is it?
and what's it doing in a haystack with the doctor's hands?
good question.
okay, at least tell me the patient on the tape was Haskell.
well... - Oh, come on, man, you're killing me.
the blood was definitely male, but not in the system. And not Haskell.
so it's possible we're looking for another victim.
and more parts, too.
let's get back out to that farm.
looking for more body parts? Thought you already did that.
no, actually, we'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind, Mr. Thorpe.
sure.
do you recognize this man? - No.
what about her? - Sorry, no.
well, do you recognize any of these people? Show him the rest of 'em.
don't know this one.
but this other pretty girl, that's my cousin's daughter Tina.
you're related to Tina Vincent?
she's Irma's sister's fourth daughter.
wild one. Wild in the eye.
she's been staying out here for a bit.
what's this about?
what about this man? He's a friend of Tina's.
can't say for sure.
but one day this fella showed up, kind of squirrelly, and they started shacking up.
the guy was in a car accident; face was bandaged.
could be him.
and do you know where Tina and this squirrelly guy are shacking up?
the old house across the road.
tire tracks. DRY! Wide tread.
yellow paint over there says low clearance.
high-end sports car.
driver left in a hurry.
not using much juice.
no water flow.
electronics gear.
think we just found where those videos came from.
I can see you. - What do you mean?
inside, on the monitor.
found a minivan around back. It's clean.
backup's still ten minutes out. What do you want to do?
let's get it on.
let me take it, Nick.
you hear that?
it's music.
smell that?
it's decomp.
snap, crackle, maggot.
that's Bach's cello solo in G.
I studied the cello; it's a beautiful piece. Man, that's just not right.
talk about "Not right."
well, we hit the jackpot.
found the rest of Dr. Kole, his nurse, what was left of Vivian Tinsdale, and a bonus body.
that the I. D? - Yeah.
Calvin Frost, white male, San Diego address.
he rented an exotic car on the Strip a week ago... yellow Porsche.
never returned it.
so where's the car now?
we're still looking for it.
but the blood on the gloves in the doctor's office came back as a match to Frost.
which makes him Dr. Kole's last patient.
I found Calvin Frost's chart.
new patient. First visit... day of the murders.
says that he tripped and took a header in the men's room at the Orpheus, and Kole stitched him up.
so he had the bad luck of being on the table when Haskell and Vivian showed up, making him collateral damage.
we thought the chart that we found on the floor belonged to the guy on the table, so if I'm holding Frost's file, whose empty chart did we find?
Haskell's.
he killed the doctor and the nurse and probably took his records to cover his tracks.
well, I'll print Frost's chart and see who put it back into the cabinet.
well, if we find Haskell's fingerprints, that means he was still in Vegas four or five days ago.
welcome to the chop shop...
body parts here, bodies across the hall.
David, I'd like to see Vivian's hands, please.
well, I got two lefts and a right.
now, Dr. Robbins used tool marks to determine which hands were Vivian's.
I used nail polish.
Vivian is wearing Fuchsia Flare.
positive for lead.
Vivian fired a gun shortly before she was killed.
doc.
I know you're anxious for answers.
Dr. Kole took a nine - mil in the chest.
nurse had a nine-mil perforate her head. There's your through and through.
what about Calvin Frost here?
like Vivian Tinsdale, he was shot in the head.
T. O.D?
all four victims were killed within hours of each other, four to five days ago.
you didn't feel a thing, did you?
thank God.
Hey, what are you doing?
so, the evidence says that Vivian was our shooter, but we have no evidence that Calvin Frost was killed at the office.
if they're going to kill him anyway, why not shoot him there?
maybe Haskell and Vivian needed someone to help them carry the bodies.
so they drove out to the house, shot Frost, and then commenced to choppin'?
then someone used the same gun to shoot Vivian and then began chopping her up.
haskell?
chopping up bodies and leaving the job unfinished?
leaving parts in a haystack and then the rest in a bathtub?
whatever Haskell is, he's not disorganized. That's not his M. O.
Tina...
Tina. She was his connection to the farm, she was his eyes at the park.
she's his new number one.
Hey, Catherine.
I traced the serial numbers from the electronics at the farmhouse.
all purchased by Tina Vincent, and here's the kicker...
I pulled the metadata off her video camera's SD card.
all those videos Haskell sent to Tinsdale...
all recorded on the same day eight weeks ago, specifically on the day after Haskell escaped.
he's been playing us this whole time.
I printed Frost's chart.
Tina Vincent was all over it, yet we didn't find a single Haskell print in that entire office.
doesn't mean he wasn't there, just not lately.
well, we do know that both Tina and Vivian were at the scene.
Vivian's dead and Tina Vincent's in the wind.
we won't find her or Haskell, not looking here.
they're not in Vegas.
the video, the ransom demand, the park, the murders at Dr. Kole's...
they were all intended to make us think that Haskell was still here in Vegas.
and now you think he isn't?
eight weeks ago, Haskell escaped from custody with Vivian's help.
then he went to Dr. Kole's for plastic surgery.
then he and Tina started making movies of Vivian in the old house to send to Daddy.
Nate was careful to stay in the background. He didn't want us to know that he'd changed his face.
then he sent the two brides to kill the doctor and the nurse.
they removed his chart but not before they kidnapped the patient on the table, took his car, his clothes, and the two bodies, brought them back to the house where they murdered him.
and that's when bride turned on bride.
then Tina murdered Vivian.
now Tina starts to chop up the bodies.
she disperses the body parts sloppily, scattering them, not unlike her scattered mind.
two days later, Tina shows up in a park to keep an eye on Mr. Tinsdale.
then she disappears.
Haskell and Tina... they're both fugitives.
traveling as a couple draws less attention.
so Haskell's got a new face, $2 million, trades in his old bride for a younger one and gets a new car in the deal.
plastic surgery, cash, bimbo, Porsche.
well, if he's not in Vegas, I can think of another place he might fit in.
we need to call LAPD.
isn't she just heavenly?
I think so.
she's my wife.
really!
you're a very lucky man.
to BE CONTINUED
baked Brie and raspberry preserves.
it's a delight for the eye and the palate.
well, my wife doesn't just shine onstage.
I told you, the best restaurants in L. A. couldn't hold a candle to Gloria.
Oh, Phil. He has a much higher opinion of my cooking than I do.
no, it really, it's so, so sweet of you guys to invite us over.
since Will and I moved to town, we've... had a hard time meeting people.
well, you just haven't met the right ones.
I'll say.
another drink - you have to allow a guest to do something.
Oh, hell, it's not a school night, huh?
I don't have to drive.
thank you. - Thanks.
Oh, I must... I might have to skip the wine at dinner. I mean...
Oh, that's a beautiful ring.
thank you.
Phil has great taste.
tell me, Gloria, how did you meet your husband?
Oh, God, it's one of those crazy stories.
um... blind date, and somewhere midway through the evening,
Phil and I realized that we weren't the ones the host was trying to set up.
I meant Ray. How did you meet Ray?
who... who the hell are you?
ray. Cops found a body. John Doe.
looks like his work. They're holding the crime scene.
where?
l. A.
detective Sosa?
who's asking?
Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. This is Ray Langston.
thank you for calling us.
I didn't call you - S. I.D. did.
ask me, you people just wasted a trip.
Hey, Brody!
Vegas is here.
Willows. Langston. Enjoy.
welcome to L. A.
another hour and I'd had to get some bread.
do you always eat at your crime scenes?
always keep some in my kit.
especially if I know I'm going to be sharing.
they do like peanut butter.
and they really loved him.
sorry, buddy, you're evidence.
excuse me.
significant animal predation.
little guy was hungry.
T. O.D.? - 48 to 72 hours ago.
here.
looks like 12 sharp-force injuries.
all postmortem.
we got word to be on the lookout for Nate Haskell.
that's why I called you guys.
I went over Sosa's head.
please tell me I'm not going to lose mine.
well, the last DJK murder victim had ten postmortem stab wounds.
if it's Haskell, he skipped ahead.
Nah, Haskell considers me to be his 11th victim, even though he didn't get to stick me 11 times.
well, thanks for holding the crime scene, Brody.
we're going to need to turn him.
excuse me, you Ray? - Yes. And you are?
I'm the guy who's going to marry your wife.
all clear.
I'll call in S. I.D.
ray, I-I don't think that you should be here.
let's see, uh... I can have a car take you downtown.
Hello! That's evidence!
ray, what are you doing?
Willoughby observatory you never forget your first gloria in excelsis deo
condo security company gave us access to the surveillance files.
the time stamp here is 8: 37.
metadata says it's from three nights ago.
I got Gloria and Phil coming home, but somebody else leaving... in their car.
well, there's no sign of Gloria and Phil.
my vote's for the trunk.
Greg, can you get us a better look?
Tina Vincent. - Who?
latest bride of Haskell.
is there a passenger?
this angle's not helping us. Maybe this will.
see if I can lose the fun house.
it's him. It's Haskell.
I thought you said he changed his face?
we were wrong.
guess I was wrong about that wasted trip, huh?
Greg, LAPD has given us their full cooperation.
get traffic cam footage from three nights ago. See if you can follow the car.
copy that.
you have my cooperation.
don't forget, it's still my city.
he gained their trust, Catherine. He was here.
we'll find him, Ray.
and we'll find Gloria.
three days and three nights of Heaven on Earth.
and then... just Heaven.
Haskell's words.
it's what he does with his victims.
it's already been 72 hours.
that means she's already gone.
we'll see what the evidence says.
I don't think I can do this, boss.
I'll call Sara.
I'll have a car take you back to the airport.
Thanks.
let's talk about something you enjoyed - your first kill.
you never forget your first, but I think that's a little intimate for this stage of our relationship.
tell us your definition of fun.
fun is taking something away from somebody.
Oh, Ray... there is a moral to this story.
officer, would you mind pulling up over here? - Sir?
there's a bar over here. I want to have a drink before I get on the plane.
flight's in a half-hour.
there's a flight to Vegas every hour. I'll take the next one.
look, you're welcome to join me.
I'm on duty... sir.
I'll wait for you out front.
Hey, it's Ray.
I know you're working.
I didn't expect you to answer, but, uh... you're the only one I can talk to.
the only person who I think will truly understand this.
at least, I hope you'll understand when I've done what I have to do.
you know, we all make choices... live with the consequences.
the only person I have ever loved... is dead.
and now... there's only one thing left for me to do.
good-bye, Al.
there's residue on the glass. They were drugged.
if Haskell's up to his old tricks, it's probably Salvia divinorum.
I'll have the L. A. lab run it.
did you meet S. I.D. Brody? - Yeah.
she seems familiar.
so, I found blood in the shower. Looks like Haskell cleaned up.
I have yet to process his gift.
I'll give S. I.D. a hand.
okay.
does this look like high-velocity blood spatter to you?
Yes, it does.
coroner's report said Phil Baker was strangled with a ligature - probably his own tie.
blunt-force trauma to the head, 12 postmortem stab wounds- I don't see all that causing this.
gunshots maybe?
Tina Vincent popped two people in Vegas.
I'm hoping that we don't have to add Gloria to the list.
you hear that?
what?
Megaselia scalaris.
little buggers corrupted our crime scene.
no gunshot.
they painted the wall.
So...Haskell's M. O.: kill the man, dump the body, take the woman alive.
blood and tissue.
postmortem stab wounds, anyone?
the flies weren't the only artists in this room.
Phil Baker was struck in the head, then strangled.
stabbed postmortem.
the blood was the paint, the body the brush.
dragged him around, created a Picasso.
you're thinking that all this blood came from just one source.
Haskell wanted Langston to feel the horror of what happened in this room.
he wanted to get inside his head.
your boy Sanders helped us track down the Bakers' car.
dumped in K-Town, blood in the trunk.
but no Gloria?
way ahead of you.
I got guys searching the park and all around the observatory.
but you may need a search party yourself.
ray Langston ditched his escort to the airport.
and this morning's little "bull in a china shop" act says he's dangerous.
tell me he's not armed.
I don't want any serial numbers.
Hey, I run a respectable joint here.
is that respectable enough for you?
I also need a laptop.
gates or Jobs?
let me take a look in the back.
I'm throwing in a holster for free.
that do it for you?
how much for the laptop?
five more bills.
sold.
no negotiating? Well, I like that.
Hey, Willoughby Observatory - it's the best view in town.
Nicky, I need you in L. A.
I can't find Ray. He's not answering his phone.
Yeah, I know. He called the doc. He didn't sound real good.
it sounds like he's in a dark place.
well, he's here somewhere. We got to find him.
all right. I'm on my way.
I'll find his ass.
we opened up Gloria's social network page.
found she'd been tagged in a friend's photo.
we now know where Gloria and Phil met Haskell and Tina.
it was a benefit concert four nights ago.
Gloria was the main attraction.
Gloria and Phil invited Haskell and Tina for drinks the next night.
is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
another of Haskell's riddles, maybe?
well, the postcard that was left at the crime scene had a picture of Willoughby Canyon and Observatory on it.
so what's he trying to say? - I don't know.
maybe it has something to do with this guy Willoughby or some kind of L. A. lore or history.
Oh, don't look at me. I... always did better in science.
you know, we do know somebody who's into both.
Willoughby J. Willoughby was a wealthy L. A. benefactor who made his fortune in shipping.
but the bulk of his profits were thought to have come from money-laundering.
explains the benefactor part.
trying to clean up his act.
Yeah, well, it didn't last.
cause in 1943, he shot his wife in the head during an argument.
attack on his wife.
I think I'm starting to get the joke.
the postcard, the ring,"Gloria in Excelsis Deo.
Haskell wanted Ray to come out and play.
so... some kind of an invitation.
except we're the ones who are gonna crash the party.
Greg, I want to know everything there is to know about Willoughby J. Willoughby.
work your magic.
do my best.
you know why I'm here.
I drove straight from the airport to S. I.D.,checked in.
Sara told me you'd be here.
detective Sosa, this is CSI Nick Stokes.
Hey, man.
anybody left in Vegas to catch crooks?
Yeah, there's still a couple of us.
so, what's going on here?
got a call. Shots fired.
units responded, found a Caucasian female.
who is she?
somebody worked her over pretty good.
looks like she might've gotten a couple of licks in, though.
nine-mil.
one in the leg, one in the head, and a whole lot of ugly in between.
I used to work Narco - whoever did this wanted information.
or he was just a sadistic bastard.
excuse me, what do you two think you're doing?
gonna process the scene.
look, I'm all about cooperating, but I'd prefer to have my people handle this.
look, Detective Sosa, this is still a DJK case.
you find Ray Langston yet?
maybe he found her.
it's Stokes, right?
Yeah.
at Ivpdcsi. com?
Yeah.
forgot something.
Thanks.
I just figured it out - you're Conrad's daughter.
before the divorce.
last time I saw you, you were just a kid.
so you don't go by Ecklie.
I took my stepdad's last name.
I'll catch you guys later.
I like her style.
I processed Tina Vincent's room.
prints I lifted place three people there - Nate Haskell, Tina Vincent...
and CSI Raymond Langston.
you want to explain that to me?
I can't.
I got enough trouble chasing down the bad guys; I don't need to be chasing the good ones, too.
look, we don't know what happened in that room.
Yeah, we do.
someone tortured that girl till they got what they wanted, then they put a bullet through her head.
now, I'm gonna ask you again: does Ray Langston carry?
no.
what about blood evidence?
I found blood on the doorknob and on the vic's ring, along with epithelials under her fingernails.
consistent with a struggle.
DNA comes back to an unknown African-American male.
you run it against CSI Langston?
I would have, but... he wasn't in the system.
how is that possible? Man's a CSI.
submission is voluntary.
great.
so if I ever want to kill someone, I'll just transfer to Vegas.
ray's not a murderer.
no? - No.
he's definitely a suspect.
how did you find me?
I'm part hound dog.
I pinged your cell, traced it back to a tower near Dodger Stadium, then checked out all the motels one cut above fleabag.
it was really pretty easy.
when did you start carrying a gun again?
you need to go home, Nick. You're not taking me back.
I'm not here to take you back; I'm here to help you out.
Haskell wants me. All right?
he doesn't want you.
Tina Vincent's dead.
now, I know you didn't kill her... but you need to tell me what happened.
Haskell wanted me to find her.
where is he, Tina?
you want to hurt me?
you're going to tell me what I want to know.
and did she? - No.
all she would said is that Nate wanted me to have that.
said the blood on it was Gloria's.
it used every ounce of my strength not to hurt her.
well, Haskell came back after you left and he put a real good hurting on her for you.
you do realize what he's doing, don't you?
Yes, yes, he's isolating me.
he's making you a fugitive. He's cutting you off from everyone and everything.
and believe me, if it was this easy for me to find you, LAPD won't have a problem.
take a look at this.
I found this at Tina Vincent's crime scene.
you never forget your first.
same ticket, same message.
what is he saying?
this sick bastard is leaving us a bread crumb trail.
all we have to do is figure out where it leads.
I can't exactly call the lab now, can I?
I can.
how we doing, Greg?
ask him about Langston.
I found the manufacturer of the tickets.
ask him about Langston.
running the numbers through the company's database right now.
will you ask him? Shut up.
what?
um, sorry. I wasn't talking to you.
uh, Nick, yeah, it's me.
um, I heard the news, and, uh, while I can empathize with Ray,
I feel I must express my concern that his Dirty Harry style antics of late can only reflect badly on the team.
Hodges, put Greg back on the phone.
Yeah, will do. Just tell me, is there any news from Ray?
no. But when I find him, you'll be the first to know.
give me that.
all right, I think I got something.
according to this, the tickets were delivered to L. A.
part of a shipment to the Santa Monica Pier.
the carousel.
you never forget your first.
what are you talking about?
my first date with Gloria was on a carousel in Baltimore.
how would Haskell know something like that?
we may be walking into something here.
you got my back, right?
always.
this isn't our first date, Ray.
it's just our first without a chaperone.
get your hands up.
no fair.
you're under arrest, you son of a bitch.
Yeah.
where is he?
I got the other side.
outside, Ray.
Haskell, hold it right there.
drop the gun!
I'm a CSI, in pursuit of a suspect.
look, I don't care who the hell you are - drop the gun!
you're making a big mistake. Listen to me!
no, you listen!
drop the gun, get on your knees and put your hands behind your head!
do it, now!
I'm not getting on my knees.
don't move! Drop the gun!
listen to him, Ray.
it can't end like this, Ray.
Oh, I know how you feel, Ray, but if you pull that trigger now, you'll kill more than me.
two people die, Ray!
she's still alive!
Gloria's still alive, Ray!
drop the gun, now!
Nate Haskell is responsible for the deaths of over 25 people, including four law enforcement officers in Las Vegas.
and last night he damn near took the life of one of my men.
so how come he didn't take yours?
I can't answer that.
that's a load of crap.
Where'd you get the gun?
I took it from an assailant who attempted to mug me in MacArthur Park.
my intention was to turn it in.
you know something... you're lucky Officer Davies was wearing a vest...
and that the slug we took out of it was a match to the bullet that killed Tina Vincent.
but you knew where to find her.
and you knew where to find Haskell.
now, I don't care if you're inside his head, or he's inside yours.
you know what's going on here.
you got a choice.
you talk to me, or I'm putting your ass on a plane back to Vegas myself.
am I being charged with a crime?
I'll be the one to get him on the plane.
you know, if it was up to me, I'd send you all home.
but then, I got a problem - Haskell drops another body and it's my ass in the sling 'cause I'm the moron who sent the Haskell experts back to Vegas.
so no free airfare then?
how about no more surprises?
I'll meet you back at S. I.D.
I'll go check in with Morgan.
I told you to find him, Nicky.
I did find him.
I should've known.
you had to have his back, had to cowboy up on some vigilante mission.
I mean, I get him, but you have no excuse.
so are you sending me home, now, too?
Oh, I'd like to, but I can't, because I need you here.
and, luckily, LAPD is giving you a second chance.
Ray... you're going back to Vegas.
do I have to post a guard at your door?
no, that won't be necessary.
we'll get him.
smooth, polished surface. It looks like beach sand.
recovered from Tina Vincent's room.
well, that makes sense - Haskell was at the pier, he spent some time at the beach.
found more than just beach sand.
I think he's been spending time somewhere else.
put your nose down that one.
Nesosilicates, garnet.
there's chips of paint in the mix.
this sand is from construction.
Sandblasting, maybe.
plenty of that downtown, at least until the economy hit the skids.
maybe Haskell's squatting.
or it's where he left Gloria's body.
the rings of a tree will give up its history.
blast the paint off the side of a building, layers are going to tell you the same story.
time for a little chip and dip.
Hey, Ray.
thanks for coming to get me.
well, Catherine didn't give me much choice.
but I would've been here anyway.
what's going on?
Haskell could've killed me, he didn't.
Yeah, well, maybe he didn't want to kill you.
he just... wants to keep hurting you.
can we go back to the office for a while?
you're on leave, Ray. You think that's a good idea?
I don't know. You think it's a good idea for me to just go home and sit in an empty house?
come on.
the trace that we thought was sand in Tina Vincent's room turned out to be commercial sandblasting.
found paint chips in the mix. Gave us a profile of the building.
you're thinking if we find the building, we may find Haskell.
base layer had traces of concrete. Suggests it's industrial.
12 layers?
damn. You figure buildings get a new coat of paint every six to eight years.
place is old.
but the sandblasting suggests it's under renovation, at least at some point recently.
chemical composition of the paint indicated epoxy formulations - maintenance paint used in railings, fire doors...
so, what, we're talking about a school, hospital, or government building?
narrows it down.
let's have LAPD pull building and demolition permits over the last three years.
we'll start there.
nice work, Morgan.
Yeah, thanks.
access denied.
Yeah, you're probably thinking virus, but, uh, it's Willows.
Catherine pulled my privileges?
I'm sure it's just temporary.
you're damn right it's only temporary 'cause you're going to give me your passcode right now.
no, I can't do that.
or I'm going to go all Dirty Harry on you.
you were listening.
I'm going to do this one time.
born 1895, died 1963.
shipping magnate,"Willoughby donated thousands of acres of land to the city of Los Angeles.
what's going on?
you can be part of the problem or part of the solution.
solution.
back to Willoughby J. Willoughby, huh?
thought we left him behind with Tina Vincent at The Penwick.
we did. Not so sure about Haskell, though.
man shoots his wife in the head, kills her.
I mean, there's got to be... some deeper meaning.
he didn't kill her.
she survived?
Yes.
is that significant? - Yes.
tell me more about the crime.
LAPD faxed me copies of the old case files.
apparently, Willoughby was a bigamist.
Willoughby J. Willoughby - a name so nice, he married twice.
Willoughby's second wife Audrey was from Las Vegas.
the night of the shooting, Wife Number One- Sylvia- surprised Willoughby and Wife Number Two during a tryst at The Penwick.
one thing led to another, and Willoughby shot Wife Number One.
so Wife Number Two witnessed the crime?
along with her seven-year-old son, who was staying in the adjoining room.
and that seven-year-old boy is Nate Haskell.
if Nate Haskell were 75 years old.
what was the boy's name?
wife Number One survives.
do we know what happened to Wife Number Two?
according to court records, uh, Audrey Willoughby, two years following the shooting, was committed to a psychiatric facility - St. Collette's Hospital in L. A.
the boy was placed into the custody of his uncle, and that's pretty much where the trail ends.
wife died the same year the hospital closed in the mid-1980s.
is there a problem?
Catherine said that Haskell might be hiding out in an industrial building, maybe a hospital.
one from around the same era...undergoing renovations.
construction delays plague st. colette project
I've, uh, got to call Catherine.
David. - Yeah.
would you mind getting us some coffee?
Absolutely.
thank you.
Mr. Thorpe, do you know where Tina and this squirrelly guy are shacking up?
the old house across the road.
she's still alive!
Gloria's still alive, Ray!
Hello, Nate.
show Detective Sosa responding code three to St. Collette's Hospital with Las Vegas CSI, requesting additional backup.
made you look
Mr. Thorpe.
help me.
please.
Mr. Thorpe, where's your son?
where is he?
please... help.
Charlie-07, Langston.
request immediate backup and paramedics to my location - the old Thorpe farm.
code three.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
welcome home, Ray.
welcome home.
to be continued
Hey, it's Carrot Top. Welcome aboard the inner casino tram system.
this takes you from the Palermo hotel all the way down to the Mediterranean hotel.
this is the best way to get from hotel to hotel.
just take the tram. It's easy, it's smart, too.
it's like 150 degrees outside in the shade.
it's like 4: 00 a. m.and you're like... " I think my heart's...
don't spend all your kids' college funds at one hotel.
spread the wealth, you know. Put a little bit everywhere.
drinking, gambling, smoking, prostitution.
bring the kids. It's great.
and when you're in Vegas, go see a movie, maybe go shopping. Go check out a show, but save room for carrot cake!
looks like we're at our destination.
remember, go explore the wonders of the mediterranean.
remember, in Vegas, anything can happen.
Hey, next time we break in a new supervisor,
I'm in Hawaii, toes in the sand, drink in my hand.
and I won't be looking at bugs.
have fun in there.
Aloha, stranger. - Aloha.
did you have a good training session? - Yeah, you know, three weeks of sand, surf and scarabs.
well, I hope you got some rest, 'cause it's looking like a serious tower-caper.
Oh, yeah? Whose tower, the sheriff or the mayor's?
both. - Mm, I'm excited.
well, good. Shootout at the LV corral.
two dead, three injured.
whoa, I thought you said two dead.
I did.
well, wh-what's, what's going on? Should I be worried about something here?
welcome back.
you must be Stokes.
Yeah. Yeah, you, uh...
you must be contaminating the crime scene.
no, no, no. I already cleared the area.
give me a hand, will ya? - Yeah.
thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, uh, D.B. Russell. New guy.
D. B... Really?
right. Crazy.
platform surveillance.
party at the Palermo.
hangover at the Mediterranean.
time stamp.
wow, the whole ride only lasted 73 seconds.
that's about as long as it took you to size me up.
which is not bad, 'cause he's still working on it.
am I right?
what are you doing here, little buddy?
EMTs said the wounded mom's face was covered in ants.
spilled Mai Tai right where she went down.
explains the ant face, but how'd they get here?
these are red harvesters.
Pogonomyrmex Barbatus.
they're really the showgirls of the ant kingdom.
they're perfect for things like...
ant farms. - Yeah.
that would explain the sand.
the kid must have had it and dropped it.
six years old... seeing all of this.
what's the, uh, what's the cowboy telling us, suit?
a single gunshot wound to the chest.
not a lot of blood. Game over in seconds.
his right hand tested positive for GSR.
the security guard had a . 357.
so the Beretta belongs to the cowboy.
and let me take a look at this.
two shots fired.
how did baseball Jersey do?
well, there's a lot of blood, but it looks like a single shot near the liver.
it's a really awkward angle.
a crossfire hit, maybe. Bled out.
thank you, suit.
thomas Finnerty. Locust Valley, New York.
no cash. Credit cards still here.
what is all this stuff?
it's slimy. It's like the tram puked.
the rust pattern on the thing up here looks exactly the Centaurus constellation.
how cool is that. Huh.
and that looks like a ricochet.
maybe.
Russell. Okay, where?
I just finished up my shift at the Palermo.
minding my own business. I hear a shot.
I look up. The guy in the cowboy hat's got a gun.
so, I took a deep breath, went by the book.
how many rounds did you fire? - Two or three.
they tell me you didn't know this guy, right?
no, I didn't know him. What I know is, he pulled a nine mil in a crowd.
Yeah, I didn't hear anything. I was in the car in front; It was quiet.
did you see anyone or anything odd on the Palermo platform?
no. I'd lost my rent in Keno, so I was a bit dazed.
I heard people died.
the sheriff will be making a statement soon.
thank you for your time.
his first mistake was playing keno.
