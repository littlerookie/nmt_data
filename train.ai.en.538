he argued that all learning is a trial-and-error process that resembles biological evolution.
he argued that all matter was infinitely divisible.
he argued that any technology capable of shifting the orbit of an asteroid could potentially be turned into a weapon, and he grimly predicted that the danger from man-made impacts would then grossly outweigh that from natural ones.

he argued that diseases were dynamic processes.
he argued that focusing on killing or slowing the spread of cancerous cells was not enough.

he argues for the purpose of argue only because he likes argue.
he argues further that the regime called officially for the elimination of both minorities.
he argues instead that aging is a disease--one that can be cured if it's approached as "an engineering problem."

he argues that bismarck's misogyny stemmed from his childhood when he found himself in a triangle between his cold, intelligent and ambitious mother, whom he disliked, and his weak, kindly father.
he argues that by standardising loan-approval techniques and using technology to keep track of disbursements, sks can keep trimming its costs and reduce the 28.3% annual interest rate it currently charges clients.
he argues that by the time some of them had chosen one candidate for state governor and two each for senator and federal deputy-all identified by number, and with in some cases hordes of candidates to choose between-quite a few had unknowingly spoilt their vote or lost track of what they are doing entirely.
he argues that carbon credits merely assuage our guilt while we carry on polluting and emissions continue to rise.

today, some researchers say that posttraumatic growth is far more common than long-term posttraumatic stress disorder.

he argues the job should be handed over to a bipartisan task force.
