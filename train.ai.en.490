scher said german companies expect to be treated equally in the chinese market, that technology transfer should be strictly voluntary, and that protection of intellectual-property rights should be strengthened, according to a siemens spokesman.
Scher, executive board chairman of siemens, and zhang xiaoqiang, the ndrc vice-chairman, is seen by the company as a decisive step in its engagement with china, although a company spokesman declined to estimate the size of future investments.
Scherbo is the first gymnast to win the award.
scherer and his colleagues, who included population geneticist matthew hurles of the wellcome trust sanger institute in cambridge, england, followed up with a higher-resolution cnv study in 2006, which analyzed dna from 270 individuals and identified an average of 47 copy number variations per person.
schering would be the surviving company, but would then change its name to merck, be 68% owned by existing merck investors, and be run by richard clark, merck chief executive.
