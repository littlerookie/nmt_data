can you at least tell me the connection to this case?
it goes to fairness, Mr. Mathis.
we go after the lowest economic demographic in our society to fight our wars.
these kids are risking their lives out of financial duress.
they have-- - I'm sorry, Ms. Schmidt.
this is an entirely different issue.
this witness is disallowed.
your honor, I would like you to understand the context of this
no. We're gonna stay on issue.
now if you've got a witness who can talk out this case
or the doctrine itself, I'll listen.
otherwise, this witness is disallowed.
now who else do you have?
Yes, I would like to hear from the doctor
who treated my client's brother.
defense stipulated that he committed an avoidable error rising to the level of malpractice.
I'd like to hear from him all the same since
there's no point here from the doctor
your honor, certainly you're allowed to be horrified
by the facts in this case.
the doctor is disallowed.
in order to fully appreciate this doctrine
and its capricious Application,
your honor needs to hear test
Oh, wait a minute.
you've--you've wastede enough of my time already.
I'd like to hear summations from counsel
in this court tomorrow at 10: 00 a. m.
and then I'll rule.
in the meantime, I'd like to see counsel in my chambers.
well...
it, um, uh, might be... best
if this conversation were-- were private.
mom, whatever it is, I'm gonna tell Fiona.
she's my soul mate.
okay.
well...
the thing is, Henry...
tell him.
well, Henry, hello. Welcome.
this is a little bit about your birth father, actually.
did he croak? - no. No, no, no.
well, we have no way of knowing one way or another
since we have no idea who he even is.
Fiona's born down a baby too
it's one of the first things we bonded over.
Yes, in fact, you're not just sperm-donor babies.
but you both come from the same sperm bank, actually.
Really?
cool. You see? We're so much alike.
M-more alike than you might imagine.
it's possible... you came from the same sperm donor.
what do you mean?
well...
you may have...
the same birth father.
the odds are against it, of course,
but there's a wee chance that...
is...
your half sister.
that--it can't be.
I-I--I'm sure it isn't, but, uh, um, it might be.
how can we know...for sure?
well... That's the thing.
uh, we... can't.
we're trying, but so far...
we can't.
I have been informed
that counsel has been wagering on this case.
is that true?
that is absolutely false.
Mr. Shore...
what about you? - me?
I've been informed
that you and Denny Crane have a side bet for $50, 000.
is that true?
well... - Alan?
proceeds go to the troops.
I never bet on baseball, and I bet we'd win here,
so it's not as if I'm throwing anything here.
but a senior partner in your firm
Denny and I have these little side bets all the time.
it's not like... That answer remotely helped me.
I lied about that actually.
Denny and I don't bet all the time.
I never bet. I just... Lie.
my therapist recommends that I lie to get past the...
gambling problem.
well, I'm recommending you for disbarment
as soon as this case is through.
all right. Summation, 10: 00 a. m. tomorrow.
you told the judge? - what?
about our bet. You told the judge.
I did no such thing.
well, he knows, Denny. How would he know?
don't ask me.
you never said anything to anybody?
well, I-I might have mentioned it to the clerk in passing.
I don't believe it. - Calm down.
you sabotaged a case of this firm
so you could win a bet? You sabotaged me.
keep your voice down. - I will not keep my voice down.
you sold me out. I'm up for disbarment now.
you might be, too. - I'll make a few calls.
Denny, we wagered on a case.
do you have any idea how unethical that is?
well, it's not like we bet on baseball.
you did this to me, to your best friend.
winning a bet is... My god.
she looks mad.
of all the things you have done...
never mind the illegality of it,
the insensitivity...
a soldier lost his life.
Shirley-- - there is no excuse, Alan.
I wasn't about to offer any.
it was stupid. We never should have done it.
if I thought it would have any bearing on the case, I never ...
of course it has bearing.
the judge now takes our case much less seriously bec
which was obviously Denny's plan,
which is why he told the clerk.
Oh, sure. Sell me out.
you sold me out. You betrayed me.
you both betred me
and this firm and the client.
you sicken me, both of you.
maybe I shouldn't have told.
maybe?
you risked everything.
our friendship, our trust, our nights on the balcony
you put a stupid bet before it all.
I mean--you know what? I don't care.
I'm done. We're done.
Alan. - I can't even look at you.
so this isn't any kind of in vitro facility or
no, your honor. It's simply a bank.
people buy and sell sperm.
and do people buy and sell a lot of it,
or has the weakened american dollar taken its toll there as well?
your honor, I certainly hope you're not finding humor in this.
the consequences here are potentially dire.
look, the odds of two people from the same donor meeting are
not preposterous.
many donors donate buckets of sperm over time.
in fact, with designer babies and genetic engineering
being the new must-have for wealthy families,
many prospective parents go looking for
that athletic good-looking man with the ivy league degree.
there are some donors
who have sired more offspring than secretariat.
it's only a matter of time
before two people from the same seed hook up.
crown cryobank follows the guidelines recommended by
the american society for reproductive medicine
to specifically guard against the possibility of consanguinity.
but it can happen.
looking at these two kids, you can see the possibility.
your honor, if I may,
we limit the number of live births per donor
to 25 per population of 800, 000.
but you have no means of actually tracking that number.
there's no obligation for the women to tell you
the resultslt of the purchased sperm once it leaves the depot.
we have binding contracts with our donors.
but if you talk to adopt children?
they will tell you there is a need.
even the--the ones raised by loving adoptive families,
there is a fundamental,
perhaps even primal need,
to know who and where they came from.
and these contracts say, "no, sorry, sperm donors" privacy counts more.
that's wrong.
parents have always treated children like chattel,
like acquisitions, but this...
the U K. passed a law
ending the practice of donating sperm anonymously.
fertility clinics started to dry up.
some have no sperm at all.
desperate parents lose out.
all right.
I think I know the arguments.
Yes, son?
I just want to say, judge,
nobody ever consulted me.
now if I want to know Where I came from,
who my birth father is,
does cancer run in the family,
are there any other diseases I might be more likely to get,
do I have any brothers or sisters,
is there anybody else out there who looks like me
I don't get to know any of that
because before I was born, some people entered into a contract.
I'm sorry.
go tell someone who's inrested.
I'm working on my summation.
Alan, I-- - get out.
you don't do something like...
sorry isn't good enough.
I'm slipping.
what would ever possess me to
I mean, I do crazy things,
but I-I always know what I'm doing.
my judgment on this was...
I know I'm slipping.
I'm so, so sorry.
for me to have done this to the person I love most is...
what's happening to me?
nothing's happening to you.
Yes, it is.
I'm not sure.
maybe I shouldn't practice anymore.
look, don't overreact.
I told the clerk of a sitting judge
we had a bet on the case.
if I'm going down, I--I'm not taking you down with me.
it's time I quit.
if you quit work, Denny,
your brain will shrivel up to the size of a small raisin,
and you surely will die.
have you bvefeeling other symptoms lately?
sometimes I feel a little foggy
and I don't seem to always get things.
for example? - Obama.
another example.
the patriots losing to the giants.
you're covering.
the idea of not having you
you will never not have me.
you said we were done.
I was angry, Denny.
I'll get by it.
our friendship will survive an act of poor judgment.
Really? - Really.
if you want to call off the bet
I have no inrest in doing that.
I plan on winng.
double it? - Done.
don't tell.
I won't.
thank you, Alan.
you forgive, I forget-- We make a good team.
Yes. We're a very good team.
all right.
look, when I grew up,
it was relatively rare to meet a person who was adopted.
today adoption is commonplace,
as are multicultural families.
genealogy is almost considered irrelevant.
but it is relevant.
people do want to know their genetic history,
whether it is for medical reasons
or just, well, to feel complete
as one adopted friend recently told me.
I agree with Mr. Espenson.
we cannot allow a contract to usurp the autonomy of the child.
the current laws are anything but current,
and they need to be reexamined.
in the meantime, I am not ordering the defendant
to tell the plaintiff the identity of his biological father.
but i am ordering you to tell him
if he and his girlfriend
come from the me sperm donorrm
you have my ruling. We are adjourned.
so what happens now?
well, we at least find out if you two are related.
how long will that take?
I would think we'd know today.
good work, Jerry. I'm very impressed.
it isn't just the undue economic burden on the government, your honor,
though that alone would be crippling.
but the subject requires the military hospitals to discovery?
that could result in the free trade of military secrets.
it could compromise military discipline.
representative Duncan Hunter,
a member of the house armed services committee
and a former fighter pilot-- Consider what he said
the feres doctrine represents A reasonable approach "to ensuring that litigation Does not interfere "with the objectives and readiness Our nation's military.
you know, and think of it?
do we really want our Military personnel bogged down
in depositions and motions while we're trying to fight a war?
and finally, your honor?
military hospitals tend to deal with high volume,
and as Mr. Shore noted, many catastrophic wounds.
we want these kids getting treatment.
the last thing we need is for doctors to be balking out of fear of getting sued.
if you take away this immunity,
the reality is, you'll lose doctors,
and our kids won't get the medical treatment
they've earned and deserve.
lawyers love to sue.
it's what we do. It's how we heat our pools.
but sometimes...
we have to put our country first.
and failing that,
how about you put our troops first?
Ah.
it's surprising to have to explain
the rudiments of our legal system to opposing counsel,
but I am not suing anyone.
my client is suing because his brother, a soldier, was killed by a military hospital.
by the way, there are no pools being heated here.
I don't have one, and as for my client,
he should be so lucky to have a house, let alone a pool.
although I'm sure he'd prefer to have his brother.
private richard canfield was in the fort wayne military hospital
getting basic follow-up treatment for wounds sustained in iraq,
wounds he was healing from nicely.
he began to have trouble breathing due to
an adverse reaction to medicine he was mistakenly given.
the doctor then inserted a breathing tube incorrectly
and proceedeproc pump ai p Into his stomach.
by the time they figured out their mistake 15 minutes later,
private canfield had severe brain damage.
three days later, he died.
none of this is in dispute.
had this same malpractice happened to me or you,
our estates would receive million-dollar settlements.
but because private Canfield was a soldier not a nickel.
apparently, we can all live with that.
this feres doctrine is as unfair as it is patently ludicrous.
there is no danger of revealing military secrets.
discovery would only go to medical records.
and frankly, I am mystified
as to how this could possibly affect military discipline.
would the troops suddenly stop saluting
or begin marching in crooked lines?
and as for the supposed burden On the government,
you've gotta be kidding me.
what about private Canfield's horrific ordeal?
not to mention the obvious fact
that while our government will undoubtedly survive,
private Canfield did not.
I would say to you, your honor,
these are our kids who are dying.
but it's not really our kids, is it?
not for the most part.
it's the poor people's kids.
and the dirty little secret,
some might say windfall,
of our record poverty and disparity of wealth
is that we've got plenty of poor people with kids to fight our wars.
I'm sorry, but I'm offended by that.
are you, really?
how about a republican presidential candidate
who opposes educational benefits for g. i.s
so as not to encourage troops to leave the military?
keep their options limited. Does that offend you?
how about all the war profiteering by the rich?
how about the fact
that while an army sergeant gets an annual salary of $70, 000,
private security guards hired by blackwater and dyncorp
get $400, 000 to $500, 000,
does that offend you?
all kinds of wonderful, lucrative deals can happen in war,
but for the g. i.s, we've got the feres doctrine,
which means when a g. i. Is killed by hospital negligence
or even deliberately by a doctor, not a nickel.
how can this not shock our national conscience?
the media gives it little if any shrift.
Mr. Mathis clearly doesn't care.
and me? Hell, I even placed a bet on the case.
how can it be that we don't... much care?
maybe because it's not our kids who are dying.
it's the poor people's.
Yes. Yes, that's fine. I'll wait.
I'm on hold.
they have the answer?
it seems so.
it's going to be fine.
I read a study.
people are attracted to other people who look like them.
it's not unusual for us to resemble each other.
Yes. Thank you.
well?
you have the same sperm donor.
I'm sorry.
this isn't fair.
I'm so sorry.
all rise.
be seated.
I'm allowing the plaintiff's case to stand.
your honor, the precedent set by the Feres doctrine
the Feres doctrine is no longer applicable in today's world.
well, in that case, the remedy is the legislature.
I disagree, counselor.
this doctrine unfairly victimizes the poor.
there are far more rich people registered to vote than poor people.
this will never get fixed by an electable legislature, never.
your honor--- I'm allowing the case to stand.
we are adjourned.
well...
what does this mean?
it means for now, you still get to sue.
hopefully we can settle it quickly.
thank you.
I'll schedule a meeting with opposing counsel,
and we'll see where it goes.
I'll let you know.
Shirley, I apologize again for any embarrassment that
okay.
she'll forgive us.
it sounds like she's already halfway there.
what makes you say that?
well, Shirley has no trouble expressing her displeasure.
but when she says nothing or walks away in silence,
it's like she's saying, "I'm still angry, but I'll forgive you."
will you...
really forgive me?
I did already.
I can't believe
I actually said that to the clerk.
promise me something
when I do something crazy, you'll tell me.
okay, let's start with doubling the bet.
Oh, right. Yeah.
at least tell me it's going to a good cause, like a hooker.
it's going to the troops. Remember?
Oh, right, yes. I feel better now.
you okay, Denny?
Oh, yeah.
you really yelled at me.
I just lost my temper.
I'm over it.
you know what's long overdue?
you and me on a road trip.
a road trip.
maybe we should go to rome,
or the balcony on the other side of the building.
Yeah, I've got it. A dude ranch.
a dude ranch?
it's horses and--and sheep and fresh air and...
sheep.
let's go west, to the wild west.
I don't really like horses.
how can you not like horses?
you just leave it to me.
I'll make all the arrangements.
we'll have campfires and marshmallows and tents
and... Sheep.
me and you and...
fresh air would do us both good.
that is what we need.
thank you...
for being...
thank you.
I don't think you're slipping, Denny.
I really don't.
okay.
Oh, I'm in trouble now.
Yes.
what's with me?
I killed a man.
I bludgeoned him with his own skillet.
there are only two "get out ojail free" cards in the game, and you've used them both up.
you know what you are?
a hoot.
with a capital "H." That's what you are.
my friend-- - I am not your friend.
you and me on a road trip...
a dude ranch. - A dude ranch?
it's horses and sheep.
we'll have campfires and marshmallows and tents and...
all right. Be honest.
have you ever ridden a horse before?
of course I have. How?
you look a little stiff.
you know what? Don't worry about me, denny. I've ridden plenty， just like riding a bike-- never forget.
when have you ridden a horse? - When I was a kid.
where? - At a party.
a pony? - No.
I don't know.
his name was thunderclap.
he had a hat with holes cut out for his ears.
all right, look, we can't do this. - Why not?
because this is a serious dude ranch, dude.
we got a rodeo followed by a 3-day ride and no ritz-carltons along the way.
what's your point?
my point is, this is obviously the first time you've ever mounted a proper horse.
I know how to ride just fine. Don't worry about me.
well, this is what I call a small world, that's what this is.
look at you, al... - oh, jeez.
snuggling up to your horse like two peas in a pod.
am I right, denny? Whoo-ee! Ride 'em, cowboy.
to each his own, that's what I say.
who is this guy?
Melvin palmer. I don't believe we've actually met. A pleasure.
I am a big fan. Al and I go way back, that's what we do.
Hey, we need to be bunkies, that's what we need to do.
home on the range, where the deer, the antelope and the three of us play.
this is gonna be a hoot.
I want to go home.
I asked for alan.
he's out of state. You get me.
what did you do?
well, I was a victim of terrible malpractice if you must know.
and I took issue with the doctor.
you took issue with the doctor how?
I blew him up.
I didn't mean to.
I only meant to set fire to his office.
how would I know he'd run back inside?
so basically, you committed murder.
well, aren't you a defendant's dream?
God, catherine.
listen, honey, the doctor didn't die.
in fact, he was only barely hurt.
uh, so I'm only charged with attempted murder.
I'm sure you'll do fine, but you won't be as good as alan.
why don't you tell me what went down?
what exactly was his malpractice?
well, I have some kidney issues, and I became anemic.
the doctor put me on a drug that caused me to have a small heart attack.
I'm fine now, but I could've died.
then I come to find out this doctor is taking kickbacks from the maker of the drug.
that's when I decided to torch his office and inadvertently blew him up.
I've already been arraigned, so you needn't bother with the trivial.
let's just go to trial.
and I'd like a speedy one.
after all, I'm old. As are you, dear.
she handled her own arraignment.
Evideny, she's gotten quite comfortable with the judicial process.
what will be your defense, revenge?
temporary insanity.
it's my only choice. Plus, she is nuts.
Katie. I need you to do some checking for me on a doctor.
also, I need a little background on a drug called "axelogen."
okay. - And then there's A...
I'm terribly sorry. My computer calendar is off.
it indicated halloween was today. I apologize.
I'm headed home to change. It won't happen ain.
balls, balls, balls.
I get one of those damn little smartphones 'cause supposedly, they do everything， such as music, daily planner, e-mail, text-- but ask it to keep track of the damn date?
I guess that's too much. You like my outfit?
it's not halloween, and I would have to be seen by shirley and sack.
balls, balls, balls!
if it's any consolation, I think you look lovely.
it's not funny.
Carl. - Bo.
Jerry, you've made rather a point of saying that is is the year that you will make partner.
there are many ways of getting that job done, Jerry.
prancing around the office as little bo peep is not one of the better ones.
won't happen a in.
uh, this is a-a very grown-up place, jerry.
Halloween is a kids' thing.
I actually arrived before the fire department.
and, sir, what possessed you to enter the building?
well, the fire looked fairly small when I got there.
and I thought I could rescue my files.
and the woman who set this fire, she was your patient?
Yes.
and what were you treating her for?
she has some kidney disease for which she gets occasional dialysis treatments.
she was suffering from some anemia, so I put her on axelogen.
and that was for the anemia?
Yes. At first, it worked quite well.
she then suffered the heart attack.
that was unfortunate, but it was also unforeseeable.
sometimes there are side effects that you just can't anticipate, especially with these new drugs.
sweet. Are you my mount?
what did you just say?
I'm at a dude ranch, dude. It's not like I can be choosy.
besides, all the sheep are spoken for. I checked.
excuse me. This is my wife here.
Really? Okay. You must want me.
what's going on here?
what's going on is that this man is making a sexual advance on my wife.
she is nasty. - Excuse me?
in a slutty sort of way.
Oh, my god. - I paid a lot of money for this vacation.
and I'm trying to show her a good time.
did you hear this?
did you hear what this disgusting person just said to my wife?
go get your horse.
fine.
my god. What a thing.
what a thing.
it's terrible to have a heart attack.
have you had one?
not yet.
something I wouldn't wish on anybody.
Catherine, at the time the drug was considered safe.
by who? The manufacturer and him.
and he was on the take.
objection. - Sustained.
Oh, do you realize, doctors also get rebates?
that's in addition to the little stipend under the table.
objection.
nothing is done under the table.
how do the rebates work, Catherine? If you know.
well, the doctor buys the drug directly from the pharmaceutical company.
they give a rebate based on the amount the doctor purchases.
then the doctor sells it to the patient-- no discount to reflect the rebate and is reimbursed by either medicare or private insurance.
so he's making a cash windfall every time he prescribes the drug.
the fix is in.
objection. - Sustained.
these doctors are bought and paid for.
strike that.
and sometimes, so are the judges.
Oh, not you, of course.
the other campers voted to send you both home.
what? Why? - Why?
because he made an unwanted sexual advance on my wife.
not in the spirit of things.
now many of us paid a lot of money for a wonderful escape, the trip of a lifetime.
irene didn't seem to mind.
did you hear what he just said? - Sir
you, don't talk to me. - What did I do?
he's just a hoot, that's what he is.
he's a troublemaker-- not in the spirit.
listen, it's not that I wouldn't love to leave this flea-infested paradise.
by the way, the brochure never said the ranch included him.
hooter.
Oh, my god. He fondled my buttocks. - What?
now listen, I'm gonna give the two of you one last warning.
you play by my rules, or I send you packing.
I paid a lot of money for an experience of a lifetime here.
Denny, you promised this would be fun.
I'm having fun.
this is a blast, that's what this is... hoot.
so tell me, carl, do you have halloween plans?
Oh, that's right. It's a kids' thing.
were you always... how you are now, carl?
how I am now?
you know, so proper and... behaved and...
and what? Go ahead. Take your best shot. I'm a big boy.
you're not, actually.
I'd say you're a big grown-up.
it's a pity.
Oh, I wish you'd waited till I got back, shirley.
well, make sure you talk to the drug rep from the pharmaceutical company.
you--you might even want to put him on the stand.
excuse me. No phone calls allowed.
I have an emergency at the office.
we all have our offices. We all have our little crises.
do you see any of us on a phone?
he's not in the spirit again.
could you just go off and work with your dialect coach?
did you hear that?
what a thing. - Oh, leave him alone, ian.
what, are you taking his side?
you promised you wouldn't be getting upset.
well, now her vacation's ruined.
I don't know why you put up with him, Irene.
nobody was talking to you.
you've done nothing but talk about me.
because you've done nothing but cause trouble.
you're an extra. You don't get to talk.
Oh, my god.
what kind of example is that, shooting a gun?
that's a terrible example to set.
Oh, my god.
again!
I've about had it with you. You understand?
why does nobody like me?
I like you, bunkie.
you just stick close to me for the rest of the trip.
my god. That one's a homosexual.
supposed to be the trip of a lifetime, and now we have a homosexual.
it's a "don't ask, don't tell" dude ranch.
surely you knew that, Ian.
the one in the middle's a masher, you're rude, and he's gay, and all three are from boston.
all right, buddy. I'm gon' take you out behind this...
I'm calling it like I see it.
I think she felt so violated after the heart attack and angry that she went into a mild dissociative state.
what does that mean?
it means, basically, that she snapped.
she was so blinded by rage and fear, she lost herself.
in my opinion, she was not capable of forming a mental intent.
are you getting paid for this testimony?
objection. - Overruled.
are you getting paid?
I'm compensated for my services, yes.
how much for today?
so she snapped, lit a fire, but now she's sane again. Is that about it?
I believe she's sane again, yes.
got it.
well, I met her accidentally in st. Paul, minnesota and it tore me up every time I hear that drawl, southern drawl then I heard my dream went back downstream cavorting in davenport and I followed you, big river, when you called well, I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry and I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky and the tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river and I'm gonna sit right here till I die michael, row your boat ashore hallelujah michael, row your boat ashore hallelujah sister, help to trim the sails hallelujah sister, help to trim the sails...
I can't believe you got me into this.
me? It was your idea.
my idea was to take a trip, not do this.
adjust your attitude.
look.
I think Irene likes me.
all right!
okay, Ian, you got a request?
Yes, um, could you please put the cigar out, please?
you know, it causes cancer, and--and I
I'm here for a wonderful vacation escape, not cancer.
it keeps the bugs away.
if only it worked on pests，that's a put-down.
Ian, for god-- - no, no, never mind, Irene.
that was a total put-down.
Oh, come on. It was just a... - oh, come on, mr. Smart mouth.
put your foot down, man.
everybody, quiet!
damn it. This is supposed to be a joyful sing-alg where we all bond.
I have a problem. These aren't even cowboy songs.
I paid a lot of money for the experience of a lifetime, too.
I expected to hear cowboy songs.
how about "surrey with the fringe on top" Or "sweet betsy from pike"?
"Michael, row your boat ashore" is a religious song with a nautical theme for the kids.
next we'll have irene here singing in tongues.
excuse me?
I don't want my wife's name out of your dirty mouth.
would you please...
Hey, I got a cowboy song.
pass me that guitar, sport.
you know, I am a get-along kind of guy, that's what I am.
and in the spirit of us all gettin' along re, I'm gonna dedicate this little number to my buddies Alan and Denny.
as I walked out in the streets of laredo. one day, I spied a young cowboy all dressed in white linen wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy. I see by your outfit that you are one, too. We see by your outfits that you are both cowboys if we get some outfits we can be cowboys, too. They're making fun of us.
I heard it. That was a smothers brothers' bit.
you know, I didn't like that song.
we went to a lot of trouble to get just the right outfits, and we quite like them.
that song wasn't in the spirit, Melvin.
well, good buddy, most hats don't come with on/off buttons.
turn your hats on, al, Denny. Let the group see.
there's nothing wrong with a hat that can be used as a light source in case of emergency.
no dou. Turn on. Let us have a look.
what?
they're just jealous.
come on, Denny. Let's go back to the tent.
do you think there are mountain lions out or wolves there?
could be.
Denny, I really want to go home. Can we please go home in the morning?
it's our first day. - I don't care.
I don't like pooping in the woods.
I may have wiped myself with poison oak.
and I don't like the group.
it reminds me of when I was little and kids were mean.
I was bullied as a child, you know?
Alan, I gotta tell you something, and I don't want you to take it personally.
promise me you won't take it personally.
okay, what?
I-I have an erection.
it has nothing to do with you personally. I swear.
I've had it all day, ever since I took the viagra thinking it was my hay fever pills.
and I think I got one of those priapism things.
that can be dangerous. - I know.
what if the group finds out?
Alan, would you take a look? Because...
absolutely not.
Alan-- - no.
well, what am I gonna do?
Plus, I gotta pee, which is almost impossible when we are going home first thing in the morning.
what was that?
something's out there.
Hello?
Hello?
go out and look. - you go.
no, you have to pee anyway.
there. It's just a sheep.
are they vicious, the wild ones?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna go try and pee. - Hurry.
you see this guy this guy's in love with you get back in this tent.
what?
don't even think of it. Just... get back here.
I think she loves me. - Never mind.
that's me, in college.
and... here, here.
that's me in high school. I was wild.
my parents thought I was a problem, all right?
I was plenty wild.
my goodness. Who is this person?
so don't pity me.
I was once very much a kid.
I never meant to imply that you weren't.
I was simply pitying the fact that you no longer are.
they say we were happiest as children, and those most happy in adulthood are the ones who never let die the child within.
there are plenty of proper lawyers who dress up on halloween or who wear hula skirts in Hawaii.
Denny and Alan are off somewhere pretending to be cowboys.
but that sort of nonsense doesn't work for carl sack.
that's not him.
perhaps someone he used to be, but not anymore.
most certainly not.
don't take it personally, Carl.
Oh, how can I not, shirley?
it wasn't a professional criticism. It was personal.
actually, I wouldn't mind a professional critique once in a while, but...
well, personally, I consider myself. professional.
What--don't bite your lip. I don't like it when you bite your lip.
how about I bite yours?
Oh, you're handling me now. - Yes, I am.
in the office. - I know.
I'm not a fuddy-duddy.
Yes, you are, a little one.
it doesn't matter. I like fuddy-duddies.
and hey, should mccain get in, we'd actually have a fuddy-duddy in chief.
Elmer fuddy-duddy.
let's go to dinner. - I can't.
I have to work on my closing.
lord knows what I'm gonna say.
she practically blew up her doctor.
you sound a little dismissive.
well, if you knew this crazy catherine piper...
did I ever tell you how my mother died?
new blood thinner medication, which, when combined with aspirin, caused her to bleed out through an ulcer.
turns out her doctor, who escribed the medication, was a paid consultant for the drug company.
but you don't think doctors are on the take, do you?
I think they prescribe drugs they think are safe.
but, I mean, let's face it, with the rising malpractice premiums, lower H. M.O. Reimbursements, many doctors can't even afford to practice these days without pharmaceutical consulting grants.
and with those grants，it comes a loss of objectivity.
did this doctor at least tell this crazy catherine piper that he was on the drug company's payroll?
no.
hello. Denny! Denny!
where are you?
I'm trapped.
you gotta come and help me.
trapped? Where? What's going on?
in hoberman's tent. I came to visit Irene.
what?
I fell asleep after that. Now Irene's gone.
but Ian's passed out on top of me.
I can't move.
you've gotta be kidding me.
get over here and help get me free before he wakes up.
Where's Irene?
I don't know. Just get over here. Hurry.
which tent are you... never mind.
I think I know.
Oh my god.
see if you can get his leg off.
Where's Irene?
would you forget about Irene?
hurry. - Don't rush me.
get his arm.
this won't be easy.
I still don't understand. Where exactly was Irene?
she went out to pee.
then Ian came in drunk, crashed.
let's get outta here.Maybe we can get back in time for halloween.
we could go as cowboys.
and where do you think you're goin'?
we're getting the hell outta dodge.
what's with the rifle?
you have to marry Irene or the sheep or the captain of the hockey team.
you think you're funny.
I paid a lot of money for the trip of a lifetime.
well, you certainly got that, didn't you, ian?
in addition to being head of this dude ranch, I'm a volunteer constable sheriff.
good for you.
I'm placing you under arrest.
arrest? - For what?
adultery is a crime in the state of utah, as is fornication out of wedlock.
very funny.
you have the right to remain silent-- - you must be joking.
and you're under arrest, too.
me? For what?
conspiracy to commit adultery, aiding and abetting an adulterer and a fornicator.
now you have the experience of a lifetime, don't you, mr. Boston, mr. Red sox fan, mr. Aider and abetter from the evil red sox nation?
all right. That does it.
Oh, for god. - Ian!
it's a--it's a tranq gun. He'll sleep it off.
put down your weapon now, sir.
whether the doctor made a mistake or not, that doesn't give her the right to set fire to his office.
Oh, sure. They put up a hired gun expert to claim that she was temporarily insane.
"dissociative state," couldn't distinguish right from wrong, not capable of forming mental intent
all the technical buzzwords to allow you to free a sweet old lady.
but you all know what happened.
she got mad... and got even.
you know the death grip the pharmaceutical industry has on this country.
they've infiltrated the F.D.A.
a study showed that 90% of all F. D.A. Advisory meetings had at least one person with ties to big pharmaceutical, and then there's congress.
big pharma gave members of congress $70 million since 1990.
so who does that leave us with but our doctors?
and even they're being bought.
between consulting fees and rebates, doctors get hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and oh my god, look what's happening.
drugs are being prescribed like candy.
a famed harvard psychiatrist helped fuel the recent boom in antipsychotics for kids.
it turns out he personally took over $1. 6 million from drugmakers over the past seven years.
um, he also failed to report this income to the university, by the way.
how can this be?
we have no regulations, no disclosure procedures in place.
nothing to ensure that we the patients can know whether our doctor is on the take.
how can this be?
Catherine piper had a heart attack.
she almost died.
an unsafe drug was rushed to the market.
it was prescribed by her own physician, perhaps because he had a financial incentive to do so.
she nearly died.
when you go back to that room, I want you to try to imagine what it's like suffer a heart attack, to be lying on your kitchen floor with no one around, thinking, this is it.
it may not even be possible to imagine that. But then she found out that the person she perhaps trusted the most did this to her.
it made her crazy.
wouldn't it you?
you have a paper bag over your head.
I do.
could you tell me why?
I was looking to crawl under a big rock.
there were none available.
the reason you wanted to crawl under a big rock?
I passed three partners today who called me nurse.
a fourth referred to me as the peepster.
evidently I was seen dressed for halloween prematurely.
and this is tragic?
yes,it is if one wants to make partner and if those same partners were to catch a glance of you with a paper bag on your head?
the damage is done.
Jerry, take the bag off.
you'll likely breathe in your own carbon dioxide. It's not healthy.
take it off.
do you know what happens to lawyers who make partner, Jerry?
they become locked in, lifers.
I'm not sure that's something you want.
Plus, there's rumors concerning the firm's financial health.
we represent a lot of mortgage lenders.
partners don't just get the fruits. They get all the liabilities.
it's just, for seven years, I've chased this particular carrot.
didn't get it. Now I'm up again.
if I blow it-- - this is that important?
Yes.
well, if my opinion counts for anything, I...
I thought you made a rfectly fab lady peep.
what's wrong?
they were arrested.
who? - Denny and Alan.
for what?
Ah, it seems Denny committed adultery, which evidently can be prosecuted in...
I don't know what alan did. They're being arraigned in the morning.
can't they go to a stupid dude ranch without get...
boy, you just find everything funny these days.
I'm--I'm sorry. I don't know what happened there.
Yes, you do. Denny did something crazy.
last week, he bet on a case.
the week before that, he had his penis hooked up to a monitor.
it was cock-a-doodle-doing in a courtroom.
I mean, it's just one thing after another.
and I'm not being elmer fuddy, shirley.
the man is losing his mind.
we all know it. We laugh it off. We say, "isn't the mad cow cute"?
at what point does it stop being funny?
at what point do we all admit the man needs help?
case number 4-2-1-2.
state of utah vs. Denny crane on the charge of adultery, conspiracy to commit
alan shore for the defendant, your honor.
we waive reading, and plead not guilty and ask for immediate extradition to the commonwealth of massachusetts or any jurisdiction where the criminal justice code isn't written in the good book.
hold on. Wait a sec.
he's a defendant, too, judge.
Yes, I am, your honor.
Mr. Crane would be your adulterer and fornicator.
I would be your aider and abetter.
I'm not quite sure how Irene escaped charges since adulterating and fornicating is traditionally done in tandem.
Mr. Shore, defendants do not speak in my courtroom.
so that little right to confront one's accuser?
how's that done, on the web?
if you cannot afford counsel, one will
I can. I'm rich.
actually, Denny and I flew here private.
we can afford the best attorneys and sometimes judges that money can buy.
I'll represent myself, and let me just toss out as an ice breaker, utah is not the state that wants to prosecute adultery.
while it may technically be a crime, so's polygamy, which you don't prosecute.
I'm sure I'll get letters for saying so, but you don't.
I seem to be getting a lot of gavel whacks. Is it just me?
your own attorney general, uh, went on record as saying you lack the resources to go after all the polygamists.
let's face it, you've got a lot of them.
not a judgment. Personally, I'm a fan. So's denny.
he's had six wives. Is it six or seven?
the former head of "now" in utah I love that the national organization of women actuallyas a chapter in utah.
anyway, she said the antipolygamy law has become as irrelevant as the spitting-on-the-sidewalk ordinance.
now I know how we all love to spit in utah.
you look like a lougie hacker from way back.
send those letters.
I even find polygamy funny, just a little these loser guys with all these women, the hairdos.
unfortunately, in many cases, there's child abuse involved.
whack away, but if you're going to ignore child abusers and come after me for aiding and abetting adultery, well, all I can say is, take your shot.
please. I beg you. Take your shot.
Mr. Shore, are you threatening the good state of utah?
you're a quick study. I can see why they made you judge. That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm ready to take on the state, mr. Constable with the rifle there, and you and everyone you're maro. Ed t let the fun begin.
Oh, it will be fun, but first, I don't let people represent themselves in my courtroom, so the first thing we're going to do is get you an independent lawyer.
judge, I'll represent the hoot brothers.
Oh, no. I'm not gonna be defended by him or any other clown
I was there, judge.
I could be a witness, in fact-- your call.
but either way, I could tell you a few things about Mr. Shore and Mr. Crane.
shall we go to chambers?
let's go.
wait a second. If you're gonna have an ex-parte meeting, we have a right to be present.
fine. But you keep your mouth absolutely shut.
one word, and you're out.
what the hell are you doing?
just do as the judge says, Al.
for once in your life, let me do the talk in.
first of all, I don't know
first of all, you don't talk.
not a peep, or you go to jail.
let's hear it.
judge, I'm gonna be honest. I don't like this man.
the old guy I kind of enjoy.
he's just an old fart who should be retired to stud. But him?
I'll tell you what, I'm from texas, and in texas, if somebody messes with a man's wife, you shoot him.
hell, he steps on your property, you shoot him.
well, let me tell you something, this guy, he wants to stand trial here.
that's why he was baiting you like that.
he gets his jollies out of playing david against goliath, that's what he does.
but the thing is he wields one hell of a slingshot.
he took on the entire supreme court, insulted every one of 'em, and he won his case to boot.
this man can make some serious noise in a courtroom, and let's face it, none of us wants to see a big flap here, do we?
prosecuting for adultery?
nobody does that, not even texas.
you certainly don't want to be doing that here, not with the polygamy thing going on.
polygamy is illegal in utah, and not practiced by the majority...
but it goes on, judge. It goes on.
and like he said, often with underage girls.
now utah's a fine state-- fresh air, fine people, orrin hatch
you got it all. But this polygamy thing...
he's dying to get his day in your court.
don't make his day, judge.
don't give this son of a bitch what he wants.
boot his girlie ass outta here.
otherwise you'll be spoon-feeding him the soapbox of a lifetime.
look at the way he's drooling already.
so's the old guy, but that's the mad cow.
I'm dismissing the charges.
too bad, Al.
and I'm banning the both of you from utah for life.
what? I got rezzies at deer valley. I'mlready booked.
you'll be booked in here if you don't shut your mouth!
get out of here, both of you!
I never want to see you again.
they weren't out very long.
do you think they considered me sane?
if only they could know you like I do.
I don't think I could handle prison, Shirley.
I hear the fights in the yard can get pretty rough.
stiff upper lip, Catherine.
will the defendant please rise?
madam foreperson, has the jury reached a unanimous verdict?
we have, your honor.
in the matter of "the commonwealth of massachusetts "vs. Catherine piper, on the charge of attempted murder and arson, "we find the defendant catherine piper not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service.
you are dismissed. This court is adjourned.
thank god they bought it.
well, I guess prison's gonna have to wait.
well, until your next crime.
Oh, thank you, Shirley.
you've been almost like a big sister to me.
I--I'm touched.
Melvin palmer--of all people to get us off.
I now have to feel indebted to him. Can you imagine...
Ah, he's a good guy. - Good guy?
I like him. - How can you possible
Oh, my god.
okay. Let's hear it.
you are so sexy.
so are you. - Thank you, Denny.
we're off to a party. - Really?
I thought maybe carl was taking you to his favorite club.
very funny.
I'm not kidding, Carl. After a few days on a dude ranch, you actually look good to me.
don't you agree, denny?
what the hell? - Denny!
what is wrong with you?
good god! Are you all right?
I think he bit me. - What?
will you ever change?
I feel a little gypped.
that whole trip was just... unsatisfying.
how so?
I don't know.
maybe it was the stark contrast between that magnificent scenery and those awful ranching people.
well, at least you and I got to spend some time together.
Oh, please. You only had eyes for barnyard animals.
Denny, you think I was too rough on utah, playing the polygamy card?
it was cheap, but hey, they came after us first.
we have to take another trip. This one didn't count.
they were wrong about our outfits.
we were hot. - We're always hot.
Irene... loved me. Could you tell?
Ian didn't. - No.
the best sex to be had is with the irenes of the world. Do you know that?
I didn't, actually. - Oh, yeah.
see, the thing is, women who look like that make love like it's the last sex they'll ever have 'cause it very well could be.
what?
nothing, just absorbing your latest pearl.
you know, you look at the ians and the melvin palmers...
most men are so starved for male friendship.
we're blessed, Denny.
of course we are, and I'll bet we're the only ones who shared the same sleeping bag.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry about the erection.
I'm over it.
we really are the best couple I know.
and we only get better.
we do.
we do.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see you there.
how may I help you?
uh, I'm looking for, uh, Carl Sack.
I'm Carl Sack.
you're Carl Sack?
at your service. Full service.
um, I've seen photographs of Mr. Sack and
I look shorter in person, and fatter and
Hello, Denny.
I'm Carl Sack.
he's got the mad cow. It makes him think he's Carl...
I'm Jenny Pratt. - Yes.
um, let's go to my office. - Okay.
there were a dozen eyewitnesses, and they all tell the same story.
Dwayne Willis was brought in a little before 9: 00 P. M.
they strapped him down on the table and hooked up the two I.V.S, one in each arm.
the first drug is supposed to render the condemned man unconscious.
it didn't.
it was now 10 past 9: 00.
the drugs had been going into him for nearly ten minutes.
that's when officer Holt started getting worried.
more time goes by.
Willis has been hooked up to the drip for 20 minutes now.
he's still conscious.
an argument breaks out.
the tech wants to pull the I.V.S out and try again.
another guard says no, just irease the dosage.
then Willis starts thrashing around.
his chest is heaving.
he is gasping, choking. It's horrifying.
and Holt says, "do something...."
but nobody knows what to do.
Willis has been hooked up for a half-hour now.
he not even unconscious.
he's gagging and thrashing, and that's when Holt just snapped.
I don't know!
he oiredne round into Willis' head.
Willis died instantly.
he's charged with murder two, but the D. A. is willing to knock it down to manslaughter, only Holt won't take the deal.
ms. Pratt-- - Jenny.
there must be many lawyers in Virginia who could do this.
Yeah, I need an advocate who can speak forcefully against the death penalty itself.
Jenny, whatever one's feelings are on the death penalty...for it.
it's moot here. Your client...carried out a death sentence, albeit in a unique fashion.
but the legal issue is also unique.
I mean, is it even possible to murder a man who's being executed?
double homicide. Happens all the time.
a double homicide is when two people are killed, Denny.
what's your point?
listen, Jenny, I'm not ...
Carl, Virginia is a swing state, and I've always wanted to swing.
Denny. - Carl, we need to bond.
hell, man, this is our last season.
if there's one thing I've learned in life, it's never, ever say no to a road trip.
I just couldn't watch him suffer anymore.
if I had to do it over again, I'd do the same thing.
you only fired the one shot?
Yes.
we could go with defense of others, but since you went into the room to participate in executing the man, - I don't think that I--- - didn't go in to torture him.
another approach, uh, would be a version of diminished capacity.
you were overcome with compassion in virginia?
moreover, your years of witnessing executions could have taken a mental toll.
I'm not arguing that.
um, how about... simple temporary insanity?
you saw a man suffering. You snapped.
no, I knew exactly what I did while I was doing it.
I'd do it again.
we don't have a lot to go with here.
I won't say I was insane.
you want us to just cut him loose?
you make it sound as if he's strung up somewhere.
let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Mr. Sack, uh, you're a stranger here.
I knew it. They plan to play the stranger card.
aren't we all brothers, my friend?
this is a very serious matter.
Yes, it is.
so I thought perhaps we could be serious for a second.
you don't mean to tell a jury of your fellow Virginians that shooting a man the commonwealth was in the process of killing was murder or manslaughter or in fact any crime at all?
it was a crime, according to the law.
understood, but a D. A. has discretion whether to charge, do they not?
good ones do. - Well, he looks good.
he looks great. - Best I've seen.
me, too. - Look...
I am not dismissing the charges.
he is going on trial for murder.
you're not my brother anymore, which I believe leaves me free to have sex with your sister.
we try to make our cases fun.
I can't thank you enough for seeing me, Alan.
please.
so I hear you've become quite the busy man these days, huh?
big lawyer.
a celebrity of sorts? - oh, well, no.
well, you look great. - Thank you.
Yeah. You know, I always figured you to age fat and bald.
well, I was lucky enough to stave off the evil that so ages men.
which is?
marriage.
what's up, Martha?
well, unfortunately, I was fired from my job. Yeah.
a very good job, I might add.
I was district sales manager for a software company, in line to become regional sales manager.
now I know that this may be hard to prove, but I think I got fired because I voted for John Mccain.
my boss and I, we got into this big fight over the election.
and as soon as I told him who I voted for, he just got this look of disgust on his face, as...not entiresi dismilar to the expression on your face at the moment.
but anyway, uh, so he fired me.
did he, uh, give you a reason?
no. No, they don't have to give a reason anymore.
they're advised by their labor lawyers not to.
but I know it was because I voted for Mccain.
I can feel it in my bones, Alan.
and the prisoner started gasping for breath and moving around on the table.
is that uncommon?
it's happened before.
no two lethal injections ever seem to go exactly the same way.
there was a lot of screaming and yelling.
officer Holt became very... upset.
then he suddenly pulled out his gun and shot the prisoner in the head.
are you familiar with the case Emmett V. Johnson?
I've heard of it.
something like lethal injection is cruel and barbaric.
something like.
according to briefs filed in that case, Virginia's method in particular carries a greater risk of inflicting pain than the method used in Kentucky, which the supreme court approved.
our methods are substantially the same.
the briefing includes evidence that members of the death team, including,
I assume, you, don't understand how the drugs work, don't know how to properly administer an I.V.S。
and don't know how to correctly observe the inmate during the execution to determine if anything is going wrong.
that's--that's an argument in a lawsuit.
there's another argument on the other side. Why don't you read that?
Oh, I'm re there is.
are you aware that a prominent medical society has found Virginia's method of execution unacceptable?
I know doctors have an issue with the death penalty in general, so it wouldn surprise me if some physicians' group said that.
neither would I, except the group I'm referring to happens to be the American Veterinary Medical Association.
some vets have banned your lethal injection protocol because the method Virginia uses on humans is considered too barbaric to be used on cats and dogs.
objection.
the A.V.M. A. has said that their report was misinterpreted.
sustained.
Mr. Sack, this case is not about the legitimacy of the death penalty.
and if that's where you're coming from, you can tuck in your little tail and head on back to Massachusetts.
your honor, I'm very proud of my home state， home of the red sox, the patriots, mitt.
we take our laws here in Virginia very seriously, sir, do you take this case seriously? Show of hands.
because, you know, it is a bit silly. - Objection.
there's a man on trial here for trying to kill somebody the state was already killing.
if anything, my client accomplishedhe death penalty.
Mr. Sack, the legitimacy of which I certainly would never question, particularly in Virginia.
your honor! - Mr. Sack, oh, how about torture? Are we for that?
I'm warning you. - Because this man was being tortured.
that's why my client pulled the trigger... - Objection, your honor!
order. Order! Order!
get control of the room, will you, judge?
bailiff.
blank. What's his problem?
how'd you even get the gun in the courtroom?
Oh, please. - Denny...
what are you doing?
will you relax?
like I said, firstly, it was blank, secondly...this is Virginia.
my approval rating went up in that room.
I'm a hero to those people.
I couldn't be more popular if I got kids to smoke cigarettes.
Carl, don't leave me here. I can't swing in here.
Alan's way more fun.
I appreciate you making the time to see me.
Oh, sure. Well, actually, my lawyer told me not to see you, but I never listen to him anyway.
no, you certainly didn't bother to consult with him before firing Martha.
nice try.
why did you fire her, Mr. Feldcamp?
it wasn't working out.
how so?
Oh, hard to say. You know, as an employer, you sometimes get a feel for an employee, and with martha, hard worker, but she was never gonna make the next step, and in this company, you either move up or you move out.
Martha's of the impression that you fired her because she voted for john Mccain in the election.
she's mistaken.
look, I voted for mccain, all right?
Martha simply wasn't working out.
there must be a reason you didn't think she was working out.
if I have to depose you to force an answer, I can do so, but you seem to be rather forthcoming. Why not just tell me now?
okay.
she's stupid.
and as for evidence of her stupidity?
Oh, god, I could cite many.
cite one.
she voted for Mccain.
you said you voted for him.
Yeah, I did.
I voted for him because I like his policies on nuclear energy, because I believed he'd make a better commander in chief in times of war, because I trusted his experience.
but Martha voted for Mccain because she found Sarah Palin spunky.
so you admit you fired her because of who she voted for.
no, I fired her because she is stupid.
look, I got a bad feeling about her, you know?
it's plain and simple.
I'm starting to get a bad feeling about you.
well, then it's lucky for me that you're not my boss.
look, are we done?
no, I'm afraid we're not done.
rather, it seems we're just beginning.
look, Mr. Shore, I fire people all the time, and some of them go on to sue me.
this is an at-will employment here. It's my will.
so if you want to file a lawsuit, just join the club.
Oh, I'm not a member of any club, I assure you.
I tend to stick out. I don't mind. It makes me more memorable.
you'll remember me, Mr. Feldcamp.
Yeah, don't let the door hit yoon the way out.
first is sodium thiopental, which is a barbiturate.
next comes pancuronium bromide, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the diaphragm and thus stops breathing.
then potassium chloride is injected, and that stops the heart.
but that's not what happened here.
not exactly.
what did happen?
well, the technician who started the I.V.S on the prisoner missed the vein in one arm, and in the other arm, he stuck the needle through the prisoner's vein and into his muscle tissue.
do you know of other botched executions using the lethal injection method?
there have been too many to list.
this is something that should be done by doctors, but doctors refuse to do it on ethical grounds.
but I mean, to be fair, in most instances where lethal injection is used, the condemned man just sort of drifts off to sleep without incident.
it's more likely that the paralytic agent simply prevents prisoners from communicating.
in fact, they could be suffocating, suffering excruciating pain during the procedure.
they're just unable to scream.
how many of these so-called botched executions occurred in Virginia?
one.
and the supreme court has approved the method of lethal injection used in the commonwealth of virginia?
and we know they're such sticklers.
Mr. Sack, I will hold you in contempt.
and the supreme court has not approved prison guards shooting condemned prisoners in the head, have they?
has anybody asked them?
went wrong here. That's not the point.
I will repeat, the question here is, do we simply give prison guards the right to just whip out their guns and blast away?
well, thank you, your honor, for framing the issue in such a neutral and impartial way.
why do you need my help?
well, I don't probably.
it's just Denny's out of town and...
will you give up, ever?
I have no one to share privoue thghts with tonight on the balcony.
Shirley, the man Feldcamp-- the unfettered, smug arrogance, he could almost make rudy Giuliani seem humbl, come on. It'll be fun.
he really fired her because of how she voted?
well, he's claiming it's stupidity, but yes, I think he did.
and what exactly would my role be?
why do you say it with such distrust?
because I can smell a dog on the sniff.
don't be ridiculous.
you're almost old enough to be my mother or one of my mother's friends...
the one who used to sunbathe naked by the pool.
so you want to march into court tomorrow, the two of us side by side, and fight for a woman who who voted for John Mccain.
he all but admitted to me, your honor, that he fired her because she voted for John Mccain.
he made no such admission.
the basis was her stupidity.
Yes, and the evidence of that was her vote.
look, they got into a big political debate three days before，during which, the plaintiff further displayed a complete lack of intellect, - which prompted my client-- - because she didn't share your client's political point of view.
my client voted for Mccain.
your honor, my client is a republican who was happy with Ms. Headly's vote, but nonetheless, could not ignore that she was...
well, dumb.
how dare you? - Ms. Headly.
he just called me dumb and stupid. - Ms. Headly.
Mr. Davidson, as I read the affidavit, it does seem like she was fired for her political opinions.
free speech is not a right in the workplace.
people are hired for their opinions and perceived intellect.
that's why we have interviews, to determine whether we like what comes out of their mouths.
listen, the fact is, this woman did get hired, and then she was discharged for exactly as you say, your honor, her political opinion.
all right, I want to hear Ms. Headly on the stand, and I want to hear exactly how this went down. Let's go.
it seemed like...
I don't know, like...like it had gone past the point of torture even.
I-I just... I couldn't watch him suffer anymore.
so I, um... I took him out.
did you stop to think, sir, that you were breaking the law by...
no, no, no, no, no. All I could see w-was a person suffering, just way beyond the point of... it was inhumane.
somebody had to do something.
I yelled at the others, but they just stood there, so...
it just wasn't right.
you decided all by yourself to take a human life.
no, the--the man was dying anyway.
I made the decision to be humane about it.
I see.
I've prosecuted two doctors who made the same decision.
they had terminal patients in agony, so they decided to hasten their deaths.
in fact, I believe your family faced a similar situation.
you had an aunt who was dying of ovarian cancer. Am I right?
Yes.
and there were those in your family who wanted to put her on a morphine drip to speed things up because she was suffering so. Is that true?
Yes.
what was your position there? Do you remember?
I was against it.
you thought it was murder, didn't you?
you told your mother and the doctor, "only god gets to make that call."
do you now amend that to god and correctional officers?
we got into this huge argument on nuclear energy.
I'm against, and he's for it.
now that argument somehow got replaced by some brouhaha on the war.
I'm against it, and he's for it.
and that segued into taxes, and he doesn't think he should have to pay any, - and I said to him that if he-- - so you had a lot of olitical differences?
Yes. Yes.
well, then the very next day, after I did inform him that I voted for Mccain, he called me a complete idiot.
uh, Mr. Feldcamp called you an idiot?
a complete one.
and then what happened?
well, not long after that, he walked into my office and he fired me.
have you ever had any yearly reviews with respect to your employment with Mr. Feldcamp?
Yes.
how'd they go?
okay.
he said I could perform better and he said sales could be higher.
but in this economy? Come on. You know that. It's bad everywhere.
I mean, it's, like, the number one problem in this country right now.
so you consider the economy to be the number one problem in the country?
Yes, I do.
if I may ask, how does John Mccain's economic policy differ from Barack Obama's?
taxes...
and, um...
well, I'm not exactly sure what else, to be honest.
well, if you consider it to be the number one problem in the country.
look, even despite how they all say they'll be different, they all do the same thing once they get elected.
come on. You know that.
you were an ardent hillary clinton supporter, were you not?
Yes, I was, proudly.
and according to your coworkers, you crossed over to Mccain primarily because of Sarah Palin.
Yes.
because her policies were consistent with Hillary's?
because I was impressed with her.
and because she strikes me as a real American, which is what this country needs.
and you liked her spunk.
and the country needs spunk, too, yes.
I don't have a good feeling on this one, Denny.
virginia is not being nice to me.
a little constructive criticism?
okay. - You're not very good.
thanks for keeping it constructive.
well, you're making this a referendum on the death penalty.
you gotta get it through that liberal, democrat skull.
americans love the death penalty.
we do?
Yeah, especially these parts.
hillary and Obama, you know those pinko-heads couldn't really be pro-death penalty, but they claim they are, and in fact, almost everyone who runs for president miraculously is for the death penalty.
Why? Cause this is the U. S. A. Death penalty rules.
flip the switch, ready, aim, fire, turn up the gas.
it's who we are as a people.
hell, you--you heard it at the republican convention.
kill, baby, kill.
it's our mantra, Carl.
I thought republicans were pro-life.
that's for babies. Criminals we kill.
you're going about this ass backwards.
the argument you want to make to the jury is this
that, uh, uh, Willis guy he wasn't dying the way he was supposed to.
after receiving the injection, the bastard refused to choke out.
so our client finished him off.
job done, game over, bang.
Preston Holt, American hero.
kill, baby, kill.
do you think... Martha and Sarah and Joe the...
is he an electrician?
plumber, unlicensed.
are-- are they the real Americans?
not necessarily. I think that's what this election just proved, that real Americans aren't just rural and white.
the portrait of real Americans s been redrawn in this election.
real Americans are of all ages, races, ethnicities.
they live in cities and apartments as well as...
farms. I...
we have a president-elect who fits into no category or demographic whatsoever other than he's an American.
God, I wept that night.
did you?
no, I just... watched and watched and...
didn't want the night to end.
I already miss Sarah Palin, though.
she was fun while she lasted.
I hope they let her keep the wardrobe.
I still have to say, though, as heartened as I am by the election and by America...
what?
Martha's a little bit of an idiot.
Shirley, almost 47% of this country didn't vote for Obama, perhaps because they disagreed with him on the issues, which is fine.
but some, no doubt, because they thought he was muslim with terrorists on his speed dial, and others because th-they were convinced he was not only socialt, but even worse, a bad bowler, and others still because they simply loved those cream-colored jackets Sarah may have to give back.
but there's one thing all those idiots have in common.
what?
they still get to vote.
what?
sorry.
just looking at you under a gently lit sky with...sharing the same oral fixation denny and I...
is it a little game, Alan, or--or are you really sexually attracted to me?
I'm sexually attracted to you.
I'm in my 60s.
well, first of all, you're beautiful.
and second, your intellect is... dazzling.
and third, I've seen the naked pictures of you.
Oh, right.
let's not discuss the cheerleader outfit.
so if I...
if I want to go there, you'd go there?
in a second.
Oh, if only obama had picked you as vice president...what a world we'd have then.
look... I can see the defendant's point.
the man was dying anyway.
what's the big deal? Well...
what about the doctor or the hospice worker who wants to speed the death of that cancer patient dying in agony?
or what about the nurses who opt to withhold treatment from those severely retarded infants who only face a lifetime of misery?
we don't go down that path.
we don't start measuring the quality of people's lives to decide whether or nothey live.
the defendant took the law into his own hands and murdered somebody.
nobody gets the right to do that.
whether the person is on death row, whether a person has a day le to live, an hour or even a minute...
you don't get to shoot somebody.
that's the law.
that's the law...because of a presumed sanctity of human life?
that sanctity was off the tab here.
the life was being exuted by the state.
uh, forgive me, but you know what I think is really going on is this man doesn't like capital punishment, and he's trying to bring scrun upoit.
it's the only possible explanation.
if he can get you to say this execution was wrong, well, that's one step from saying, "gee, maybe executions are wrong."
that's ridiculous.
more ridiculous than accusing a man of murdering someone who was being executed?
let's not kid ourselves.
there are those out there trying to get rid of capital punishment.
and I would suspect they have to be tricky because they know the people are overwhelmingly for it.
we the people know the death penalty is one of the things that makes America...well, America.
not many countries have it, you know?
We're--we're the only westernized country left.
and it's not easy being in the company of Iraq, China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Sudan.
and I'll admit, the reasons for abolishing capital punishment are compelling.
it costs us hundreds of millions of dollars, up to six times more than life imprisonment.
it doesn't seem to deter crime.
murder rates are actually lower in non-death-penalty states.
it's well-known.
canada's homicide rate fell 40% after they abolished the death penalty.
we botch executions a lot.
medical evidence now shows that even when they go off without a hitch, the executed suffer perhaps excruciating pain.
there are many reasons to do away with capital punishment.
but we don't because, let's face it, the death penalty?
it's who we are as a people.
we're an eye-for-an-eye kind of nation, and we don't d have to apologize for it.
listen, if somebody killed my son...
we believe in executing murderers. It's... justice.
the only thing my client did here was carry out the state's mission.
it makes no sense to be prosecuting him.
the only conceivable explanation is that this man is insidiously trying to bring scrutiny on the death penalty because he secretly... is against it.
no, look, as I said to her lawyer over there, I like Martha headly.
nice lady.
but my god, sales is about selling, it's about relating to people.
she doesn't even read the newspaper.
well, George Bush doesn't read the paper.
I'd never hire George Bush.
would anybody?
and yet you voted for John Mccain, who supports...
no, no, no, no, no. This is not about politics.
this is about being smart or not smart, and she is the latter.
but, Mr. Feldcamp, to be fair, you're basing your conclusion on her political opinion.
no, what I'm saying is that whatever your opinion is about anything, at least be able to defend it, and failing that, arculate it.
Martha's never been the brightest bulb in the tanning booth, but when she talks politics, I, you know, I just cringe.
I go, how can I have a person like that working for me?
well, guess what. My company. I don't have to.
do you make all your employees defend their political beliefs?
not all my employees launch into them.
but had she defended hers better, she might
look, look, look, for 16 months, she just went prancing around talking Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, and then she railed against Obama's inexperience all throughout the primaries, and then out comes some moose hunter from Alaska.
she knows nothing about Sarah Palin or about John Mccain.
what does that say about her?
Sarah? - No.
Hillary? - Her!
what does it say about a person who n be so arbitrar so fickle?
and this is about stuff she actually felt strongly about.
I'll tell you what it says. She is an idiot.
you know, let somebody else hire her. I don't think it'll be you.
how dare you let him go off on mlike that in a courtroom.
I didn't let him go off.
Yes, you did.
he was bellowing that I was an idiot, and you just sat there, and so did you...of all people.
now wait. What's that supposed to mean?
it means that it was blatant sexism.
and I expected more from a person of your caliber.
now hold on here.
is that the kind of lawyer you are?
is that the kind of woman?
honey, the sexist in all this is you.
me? - Yeah.
you claim to be a staunch Hillary Clinton su ter.
you walked into that booth and voted against everything hill ands for, and why?
because the republicans added to their ticket someone they referred to at the convention as "the hot chick."
so you just sit quiet and let me get brutalized on the stand
I sat there for two reasons.
first, there was no valid objection to be made.
and second?
you are an idiot.
at-will employment means exactly that, your honor.
at the employer's will.
certainly, we can't fire anybody for race or ethnicity.
but, well, intellect or a person's lack of it?
bosses fire people all the time for that.
but, Mr. Davidson, fire someone for their political opinion is still...
your honor, if I may, that's one way to look at this.
the other way--are we saying that stupidity can never be grounds for discharge when it's cloaked in political content?
he's the boss. It's his company.
so as long as he stays within the law, he gets to hire and fire who he wants.
the unassailable right to vote is the core principle of any democracy.
and people have the right to cast their ballot for whomever they want for good reasons or for bad reasons or for no reason at all.
let's face it, your honor, we as a nation are horribly uninfmed when it comes to politics.
approximately one-thd of the people in this country, people of voting age, couldn't tell you the name of our current vice president.
now admittedly, some of us like to block it out, but even so, only two in five adult Americans know we have three branches of government.
and Mr. Feldcamp expects his employees to actually know the political issues of the day?
well, today our news programs consist solely of sensational headlines and sound bites.
people forgo newspaper for the internet, where instead of relying on credentialed journalists, they turn to these bloggers，sort of entry-level life-forms that intellectlly have yet to emerge from the primordial ooze.
this is how we've gotten the elected officials we've gotten.
we've never really cared about issues. Come on.
we're more concerned with how Hillary looks in a pantsuit or whether Barack can bowl.
we don't always go for the best or the brightest.
we elect the guy we'd most like to have a beer with or the gal we'd most like to feel up in the back of the car.
now I certainly wouldn't pick my airline pilot that way or my accountant or doctor, but for my president, so often, it's, "give me the blue-collar, lunch-bucket, good ol' boy who fits in best at the pancake breakfast.
the problem with Mr. Feldcamp, and forgive me,
I hesitate to say this about anybody, but he's an elitist.
objection.
I realize that's much worse than being called stupid.
Mr. Shore, let's stay on message.
the message is, we vote for who we like.
it's as simple as that.
we don't need to have a reason.
it's as simple as that. The founding fathers did not form a meritocracy.
this is a democracy.
we can be as stupid as we choose.
we're Aamericans. We're as simple as that.
all right. Look... I don't like it.
but just as we don't get into why a person voted the way he or she did, nor do we get into why a boss terminates somebody in an at-will.
whoa, whoa, wait. It sounds like I'm losing.
your motion for an injunctive relief is denied.
if she wants to sue for lost wages, I can't stop her.
but we're done here. We are adjourned.
I'm sorry, Martha.
you didn't try hard enough.
that's what happened.
I'll be suing you next.
I never liked you.
she seemed much more fun in high scho.
Oh, well.
Shirley, in anticipation of winning, I booked a little celebration dinner at the Ritz.
the restaurant that comes equipped with private rooms should we have too much celebratory wine.
Shneley, o's life is a sum of his or her experiences.
okay, Alan.
with Denny's permission.
what? Why do you need...
because I do.
till then... I'll be waiting.
has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, your honor.
how say you?
in the matter of the commonwealth of Virginia "vs. Preston Holt on the charge of murder in the second degree, "we find the defendant not guilty."
the court thanks you for your service.
the defendant is free to go. We are adjourned.
thank you, Mr. Sack. - Uh, you're welcome.
I wasn't exactly sure of your strategy there, but...
not to worry. Neither was I.
thank you, Mr. Crane.
you're welcome, son.
do you think it's odd that when running for office, having an ivy league education is considered a liability?
no. - You dot?
no, a Harvard grad took us into Vietnam, a Yale grad bought us Iraq.
we've learned our lesson.
Denny... between you and me, do we really think he made it through Yale?
with a little help.
Denny, there's...
something a little...well, delicate I've been meaning to discuss.
what?
well, they say as a man...ages, he eventually sits alone with nothing but his memories.
I'm concerned that...
well, with the...mad cow, y-you could possibly be robbed of your memories in the end.
and what a horrible thing, not being able to even recollect the things...that brought you your most profound joy.
making love to Shirley...
how sad if one day...you weren't able to remember all the...wonders of Shirley, how she...smelled, how she tasted, how...
I was thinking...
if that day ever came, and you no longer...
it would be great if I could tell you about it to help you remember.
maybe I should make love th Shirley once, - just so I'd know-- - you're pathetic.
exploiting my mad cow just so you could get in the sack with Shirley?
all right.
I can't believe you just did that.
waltzing me down mad cow lane where there's no memory lane just so you...
all right.
here's where your logic failed, Alan.
first of all, I'll never be alone because I got you.
secondly, I could never forget what it was like to bwith Shirley because there was a magic there that no man could ever forget.
in fact, there's a chance that it'll be the last memory I'll have in the end.
it could be the only thing I'll talk about in the end.
all day long...
every day...
I'll tell you about it.
I'll tell you...
how we moved together as one one night on the beach in nantucket...
how her breasts were as soft and as pure as a baby's behind.
you really are cruel.
Yes, I am.
cruel enough to shoot you if you so much as look at Shirley.
I need a new woman to objectify.
what do you think of Sarah Palin?
Oh, those pouty lips...and the--those down-to-earth, slutty good looks...
I've got two things to say about Sarah Palin...
right here, right now.
you think we're sexist?
why do you ask that?
just wondering aloud.
what about Shirley and Sarah... together?
there's a ticket.
who wouldn't vote for that?
what the hell is this?
it says the firm is going broke.
the firm is going broke? - Did I know this and forget?
you're in the early stages of alzheimer's.
we're not talking about precursors anymore.
there's a drug called dimebolin. Something like that.
you can't have it. It's not F. D.A. Approved.
even a dying patient has no constitutional right to experimental treatment.
so now what?
we go to the state supreme court. - They said no.
any appeal?
well, to the U. S.Supreme court.
will you marry me?
I would love to marry you.
we're going back to the supreme court!
supreme court! - Supreme court!
Ah, what's up?
all I know is they've reached a tentative deal, and they need us to sign off before
we merged? - Evidently. We'll know more in a second.
where are we going? - 28th floor.
they're all waiting. - Who?
Wh-where's-- where's Edwin?
doesn't he have to sign off?
I'm told he was called.
what does this mean to us, or specifically, me?
I don't know the details, Denny.
let's just hear what they have to say.
what the hell is this?
Shirley Schmidt and Denny Crane, I'd like you to meet Hyung Lee and Zhu Chang.
hello. - They're all chinese.
Denny, Mr. Chang is the C. E.O. Of the Tsu Chang international group.
they've recently acquired Finlay Cravette, a law firm you know well.
they are now expanding to acquire Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
what are you talking about?
I thought we were merging with Finlay.
Yes, Finlay is now really tsu international.
any of you yahoos speak english?
I speak english, Mr. Crane.
Oh, good for you.
who are these guys?
Denny, your abrupt litigation style is legendary.
you need not put it on display.
are you telling me we're being bought out by the chinese?
uh, the good news is, they intend p on kee most of the attorneys here, so as transitions go
Yeah, I've seen their transitions in tibet.
I'm not a fan.
we're not selling out to a bunch of commies.
Denny-- - how dare you?
what, you're not a bunch of commies? You're not getting my firm.
what? What? War talk? Bring it on.
Oh, really?
I think I managed to smooth things over.
this deal...
Paul, why didn't you tell me who you were negotiating with?
it's an extremely reputable group, Shirley, not to mention liquid, which in this economy it's chinese.
do you know how many businesses in this country are owned and operated by
we don't have to be one of them.
we don't have any other bidders.
we have about three weeks before we can't make payroll
Paul...this firm is my legacy.
my name is on the plaque.
and I don't have to remind you of China's track record in human rights.
you're talking about the government.
this is a private company.
there have to be alternatives.
there aren't.
what?
what's the address?
okay. Thank you.
Denny's been arrested.
what?
it's 1: 00 in the morning.
Shirley Schmidt and Paul lewiston. We represent Denny Crane. Where is he?
the den.
what happened?
he broke in and sexually assaulted the woman who resides here.
what sexually assaued her?
he climbed into her bed while she was sleeping.
she broke free, called us.
Denny. - I called Alan. Couldn't get him.
Denny, wh-- what have you done?
well, this is just a misunderstanding.
this is, uh, Penelope Kimball's house.
she's a friend, a neighbor.
we have a kinda flirty relationship.
I-I thought I'd give her a christmas surprise.
I surprised her too much, I guess.
you climbed into her bed?
well, I thought she'd like it.
we have a kind of chemistry.
not anymore, you don'T.
well, couldn't I just a-apologize to her and go home?
I don't think it's going to be that easy.
you' being charged with breaking and entering and sexual assault.
Oh, please.
who do I make the check out to?
Denny, you are in serious trouble here.
are you kidding me?
Oh, please. Everybody's overreacting.
overreacting?
you broke into a woman's house in the middle of the night, climbing into her bed naked?
well, I do that all the time.
Denny-- - look, I didn't break in.
the kitchen door was open. She's a friend.
and as for being naked-- I-I thought I was saving a little time.
look, the last time she and I spoke, we talked about christmas and the gifts and the economy, and I said, "this year, I'm going as the little drummer boy. Instead of presents, I'm gonna show up and play my little instrument."
and she said, "oh, I'd like that."
and I mistook that for an invitation of sorts. Sorry.
Denny, we are schedule to go before the supreme court on friday.
Alan, we got bigger problems than that.
what?
we're being b-- we are being bought out by the chinese.
what are you talking about?
it's very hush-hush, but I'm telling you, a chinese company has reached an agreement in principle to buy us.
this place, last night, was crawling with chinese.
ho Chi Minh city, I kid you not.
why would a chinese company want to buy an american law firm?
they're buying everything.
they're taking over.
listen, h-how could you have not been kept in the loop on this?
I was told they were a pant company of Finlay.
hai d no idea...
Carl, I want to stop it.
well, can we?
the only think I can think of is an injunction, trying to block it on public policy grounds.
public policy?
well, it can't be a good thing for chinese corporations to be scooping up american law firms.
it's definitely not good for us.
well, all in all, we picked a really bad week to get married.
ms. Schmidt, I'm Penelope Kimball.
we didn't actually get to meet last night.
no, I--th--Carl Sack, this is Penelope Kimball.
she was the victim of Denny's-- Last night. Please sit.
you know, I feel really, really terrible about all of this.
well, we all do.
um, Denny's maintaining it was some sort of misunderstanding.
is that... possible?
Denny didn't seem to understand anything last night.
what do you mean?
he seemed extremely disoriented and confused.
it--it wasn't...
it didn't seem like an assault of any kind so much as...
he seemed really, really confused, like...
he didn't really know where he was.
that's ridiculous.
I was in Penelope Kimball's bed looking to play my instrument.
she's a very sexy lady. You should be glad I didn't climb into yours.
Denny, there's no point in lying to us.
I am not.
Denny, look at me.
tell me what happened last night.
I told you already.
I don't know what happened.
all of a sudden, the police were there.
I was in the wrong house...
and I wasn't wearing anything.
I don't know what happened.
I remember being upset at home. I-I couldn't sleep.
I was so worried about the communist invasion.
next thing... I'm naked...
and I'm talking to police officers.
I don't even remember talking to Penelope.
I want that drug.
we go to the supreme court on friday.
the question becomes, if they refused to hear almost exactly the same case before, why are they suddenly doing so now?
I don't know.
it's a bit daunting, being in a room with them, even when they're just cutout posters.
W hoare we doing?
well, there's no constitutional right to experimental treatment.
we're gonna have to locate authority elsewhere.
what about right to privacy? Can we extend by analysis?
you can, but it's been tried before and rejected.
medical self-defense?
also tried with marijuana for medicinal purposes, also rejected.
what have you got?
we're still looking.
Alan, there are rumors about the firm being sold.
I don't have time for rumors right now, Jerry.
look, Shirley, no one likes it.
why can't you get a line of credit to make payroll?
line of credit? Have you been living on this planet? Credit?
we have assets into the millions.
and liabilities in the tens of millions.
so you just make a deal with the devil? That's the way you
they are not the devil. - Yes, they are.
what, because they're chinese? - Yes.
you're a bigot.
I'm entitled to my opinion.
I realize I wouldn't be if I were in China.
you are out of line.
Paul, if this merger goes through, I will
you can make your case to the partners.
I will take my name off the firm, Paul.
your name is firm property. You do not own it.
I'll go to court. - Fine.
I'll wave to you from the other side.
thanks for having my back, Carl.
Shirley, dear, if you expect to have any success with either the partners or in court, you're gonna have to check your prejudice at the door.
I have no problem with the chinese people or chinese-americans, but the government, which a lot ofhese companies are
Yes, you know what? I think you should check your anger at the door, too.
I spoke to the D. A. And they're dropping the charges against you.
how did you do that?
well, it wasn't difficult, really.
Penelope also spoke to them, so...
deep down, that woman wants me.
do not go there tonight.
thank you, Alan.
Alan, I want to ask you something, and, uh, you may think this is crazy, but I want you to think about it.
okay.
will you marry me?
I-I-I know the sex is lousy, but...
it's legal in massachusetts-- same-sex marriage
and there are going to be decisions ahead, medical decisions, that a suse...gets to make if I should become
Denny, you can stipulate that in a living will or by proxy.
we don't need to get married.
there are other reasons.
last night, I-I climbed into a neighbor's bed, and I shot a few chinese, although I don't apologize for that.
how many times have I been arrested?
a lot.
and the odds on my getting arrested again for who knows what, uh...
I need to be able to tell you things.
but you can always-- - no, let--let me finish first.
although I know you'd resist, the police could subpoena you and try and force you to reveal whatever I tell you.
I'd never
you'd could be held in contempt if you refuse.
you could end up in jail.
on the other hand, if you had spousal privilege...
I could talk to you without worrying about you incriminating yourself later
Denny. - For my peace of mind...
what little piece I have left.
let's be serious.
and I can transfer property to you without paying gift tax.
and since the rate is 100%
Denny, what we've got now is so great.
why... ruin it with marriage?
who knows how long I have left?
you have a long time left.
we're going to the supreme court, and we're getting you that drug.
Seymore? - Aye.
Zinberg? - Aye.
Kennedy? - Aye.
Underwood? - Aye.
Evans? - Aye.
Smith? - Nay.
Xavier? - Aye.
Espenson? - nay.
Adams? - Aye.
Reid? - NaY.
Thomason? - Aye.
sack? - Nay.
Schmidt? - Nay.
okay... we've got 21 ayes and 6 nays.
the nays have it.
the motion to approve the merger
the nays have it.
the merger has been approved.
I'll get an injunction.
we can get injunctions on our own, Shirley.
take your shot, Paul.
Shirley, there are many ways to go out.
on your ass isn't one of the better ones.
you might keep that in mind, Paul.
Denny. Come on.
you for this merger, Carl?
no, but this is a bit of a duress sale.
we don't want assistants and secretaries losing their homes.
God forbid you should have to sell your gulfstream.
Shirley going to court? - She is.
I'm coming with.
well-- - my name is on the door, too.
understood, but we have to present a rational front.
give it to me.
okay. Thank you.
am I not supposed to see you before the big day?
you're not the groom.
still time.
I'm coming with you to fight the chinese.
Oh, no, d--oh, no, no. - Shirley...
my absence will be conspicuous.
and much appreciated by all, since-- - I won't shoot anybody.
I--I'll keep my clothes on. I'll...
well, I won't shoot anybody.
Denny, I can't take the risk.
Shirley, I'll behave.
I belong at your side.
I'm a name partner.
God, you're beautiful.
thank you.
I'm going to pack my trial bag.
Yes! Yes!
don't tell me. You love Katie.
a federal case in newark recently granted a plaintiff the right to use an experimtal drug.
it's the most recent case on point.
I found it. Katie helped.
it's not binding, but it could explain why the supreme court agreed to hear us.
a new case?
I found it. Katie helped.
new case. I found it.
wait a second.
you're here representing Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
and you're here...also representing Crane, Poole & Schmidt, and I would remind the court, I'm schmidt.
your honor, the partnership voted overwhelmingly to approve this merger.
is itlawful.
it is pursuant to a valid partnership agreement entered into by Ms. Schmidt.
and it is against public policy.
Why?
to have a business acquired by chinese interests?
you're a little late on the protest wagon if that's what you're talking about.
your honor, it is one thing for them to acquire manufacturing and software companies.
it's quite another to allow them to have a death grip on our law firms, which death grip?
which are in the business of safeguarding our individual liberties
Hey, counsel. - This does not scare you?
shame on you. - Hold on. The law is the law.
if the chinese buy companies here, well, they have to play by our rules.
and if they don't want to play by our rules, what more effective, insidious way to circumvent our laws than to gain control of america's law firms?
your honor, this is just outrageous.
y maI finish?
china is a lovely country.
I've alws wanted to visit their... walls.
but the idea of China coming here is terrifying. I'm sorry.
their record on human rights is atrocious.
they do not support freedom of speech, freedom of religion.
the do support Sudan, which enables them to contribute to the genocide in darfur.
they turn a blind eye to female infanticide.
they force abortion. They practice torture.
china's economy will overtake ours.
that's not even a question.
they have so much money invested here now...
uh, add to that the devaluation of our dollar, they practically own us already.
their goal is to become a civilizational power, and they have the wealth to achieve that.
let them buy up all our lawyers...
and watch out.
I do not want to fall into their hands.
and by the way, it is folly to think we will control them with our laws.
it is ludicrous to think we'll be tough on their human rights violations because we haven't been.
and why? because they own us.
as hillary clinton said, "how do you get tough with your banker?"
I...
I understand that the united states may end up workinfor China one day.
I get that. It's a new world order.
but... as far as law firms go...
my name is on this one.
my life's work has been to build up...
let them start with someone else's firm.
did he rule?
after lunch.
and suppose we lose? Has anybody made it clear how the firm might change?
well, Paul lewiston says it won't. Shirley's convinced otherwise.
Jerry was hopping around.
said he found a new case on point.
there was a recent federal court ruling in support of giving experimental drugs.
district court, so it won't be binding, but it'll help.
I'm also presently trying to get you into one of the clinical trials Dimebolin, but I'm not confident of that, Denny.
have you given any morehought to my idea?
what idea?
marrying you.
we're committed to each other.
let's make it legal.
I-I... I didn't mean to get emotional. It's just...
maybe it's a bad sign that my personal legacy is so ed to my profession instead of...
I hardly ever talk to my daughter.
I don't to my sister.
we could always start a family.
Shirley, are you the least bit excited about getting married?
well, of course I am. Why would you ask that?
I-I mean, most brides are obsessed with their wedding.
well, please, I've had too many of them.
I-I didn't mean for it to sound that way.
do youant to postpone the ceremony?
no, no. Let's just get it over with before I
Hey, I definitely didn't mean for that to sound that way.
you know, this is where I get insecure and I want to ruback to new york.
Hey, I want to mry you more than anything, and I don't want to delay it a single second.
in all of this madness...don't let my love for you get lost, okay?
okay.
Judas priest. Again with the kissing. Is this for my benefit?
no, Denny, it's for mine. Do you need something?
do we have a ruling yet?
no, not yet. We're still wa
the judge ruled.
your injunction was denied.
the merger is valid.
look, Shirley, none of us wanted this to happen.
but we have responsibilities to others.
and like it or not, this firm is bigger than all of us.
obviously, your remarks abo China are deeply disturbing.
in a time when China is embracing capitalism and American ideals, we expected to be welcomed more graciously.
Mr. Chang, uh, the dirty little secret on China...is the capitalism you so embrace consists primarily of state-owned enterprises many of these companies, including this one, are not really all that private.
they are often tied to your government.
there's nothing American about that ideal.
many of your banks today are owned by your government.
our hope is that you would remain with Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
we now have deep concerns over whether you will you serve our interests with fidelity.
if you feel you cannot, we would appreciate you acting with honor and submitting your resignation.
you'll have my resignation by the end of business.
uh, since we're being honorable, would you do me the courtesy of removing my good name from these walls?
bitch.
you quit?
C-Carl, I-I just can't do this. - No.
first of all, you never make this kind of decision when you're emotional.
and second, Shirley, there are a lot of people around here who now more than ever are going to be looking to you for reassurance.
this is not how a leader reacts.
you can lead. - No, I can't.
I don't enjoy the kind of loyalty you do here.
we certainly don't want Denny in charge.
do not be submitting your resignation, at least not yet.
Oh, gee. It's Laurel and Hardy.
ms. Schmidt, you have been very rude to us.
we will t respond in kind.
Mr. Sack, may we meet with you, please?
I would submit there are four factors the court must look at. First, you don't get to tell us what we must do. Sorry. Start again.
Jerry, which justice are you playing?
I was kind of a composite. - Okay.
I would like the court to consider four factors in determining whether my client qualifies for the compassion exction to the ban on experimental drugs
you've come to the supreme court looking for compassion?
boy, did you walk into the wrong room, I tell ya.
Jerry, they won't do that.
can you lose the cigarette and play it straight?
this is kind of an important case.
what's going on?
am I already dead?
effective as of january 1st, the litigation department of Crane, Poole & Schmidt is being replaced.
what are you talking about?
we've all been fired?
"fired" is such an ugly word, Alan.
an accurate one, but...
I am sorry. This is no doubt because I antagonized them.
fired? All of us?
even me? - Especially you.
they fed you twice.
we've been dead before, then suddenly...like from the planet mars, life.
we could just start a new firm, but ankly, I don't think I have the energy or the will.
never surrender, Shirley, especio ly ta bunch of commies.
it's not about surrendering, Denny, it's just that it's time for me to marry a man I love and start a real life.
I-I mean him.
look, if you could permit an old lady to peddle some advice
whatever you do next, make sure it's something you love.
a life, professional or personal, without passion...
y-you're dead.
this can be the start of a good thing.
I just don't do well with good-byes.
look, we are going to come through this, and we will do that by focusing on what's immediately ahead of us.
for me, that's my wedding, which is saturday at st. Christopher'S.
you are all, of course, invited.
we're keeping it fairly small.
that's rushing it, isn't it? You just got engaged.
I'm knocked up, Denny.
kidding. Kidding.
as for the four of you, you must concentrate all your focus and energy on the supreme court argument.
how do you stand?
I found a new case on point. Katie helped.
there is precedent for allowing an experimental drug.
Alan? You're very quiet.
I'll be ready by friday.
what are you thinking about?
I think we should fire them.
excuse me? - Our new bosses.
it's not right that they fired us. I think we should fire them.
I know you're good, but exactly how would that work?
get us a meeting.
now look, I know there's a lot riding on this meeting, but I want everyone to just take a deep breath and stay calm.
alan can handle it. Can't you, Alan?
Larry storch played agarn, right?
on "f troop," yes.
what's "f troop"? - I loved "f troop.
dear lord.
greetings, our chinese carpetbaggers.
I'm told it's customary to bow.
that's the japanese. - Greetings. Good to see you.
Yes, hello. Good to see you. Greetings. Yes.
Oh, love the tie. Greetings. Yes. Hello. greetings. Yes.
okay, this concludes the bowing and kowtowing portion of the presentation.
I'm told we need an interpreter.
who would that be?
actually, Mr. Shore, almost everybody here can understand English.
and since this is a unilateral presentation, why don't you just talk?
excellent. We didn't allow time for you to speak anyway.
I'm having second thoughts about that tie, though.
Oh, good. He does understand. So... where to begin?
how about welcome to Crane, Poole & Schmidt?
I'm raid you're all fired. Nothing personal.
you seem like fine folk-- love the discipline, the 10, 000 drummers
but it's not working out, so sorry, out you go. Single file, please. Move along. Bye-bye.
Mr. Shore, we now own the firm.
well, that doesn't much matter, mister...
Lee. - Lee, yes.
this is america, and in america, it all comes down to who the jury likes better.
and I don't think an american jury will side with a communist, do you?
juries typically frown on oppressors, even when they're capitalists, so the idea of China on what grounds could you possibly prevail?
grounds? Who cares about grounds?
cases always come down to who the jury likes better.
did I not just say this? I think I did.
so anyway, meet the group.
we're a fine, very likeable group, infectious smiles-- smile, group
and best of all, bad for you, we're very good.
did you check out our win-loss record?
good for us, bad for you.
more importantly, did you note the kinds of cases that we argue week to week?
typically preposterous, mostly unwinnable on their face, and yet, we win them whether we have grounds or not.
must be the smiles. Smile, group.
and here, we actually do have grounds.
for you to summarily hmidtcan an entire litigation department, a successful one no less, because well, because I guess you don't like us, it seems arbitrary, capricious, actionable, winnable of all things.
it doesn't really seem fair, es it, for us to have both the merits and the smiles?
smile, group. But we do.
a wrongful discharge subject to compensatory and punitive damages could be lots and lots of money, not to mention, think of the fall-out here at the firm.
you see, we're not just good litigators, we're popular
again, could be the smiles-- and you firing us, well, that would be a terrible, terrible way to introduce yourselves.
I mean, uh, Denny Crane, Shirley Schmidt-- you must be joking.
I-I know how the chinese love to kid, like with the, uh, the tanks in the square, the monks in tibet or--or daughters.
uh, but you could have a mass exodus of lawyers long before we even get to trial, which we will, of course, get to just the same, and when we do, take caution.
here's a little tip--we americans love to trade on fear.
fear sells. Fear works.
the fear I'll be trading on is China-- communist China taking our jobs, first over there, then over here.
where you once were passive investors, now you want active control.
that scares Americans-- active communists, made in China, seeking control.
Ooh, scary!
one last thoht, we're giant slayers here.
it's what we do.
be it the united states govement, big pharmaceutical, big tobacco, big oil
it never gets old.
and just when it seemed we were fresh out of bigs, along came you, China, the ster child for big.
to parade you in front of an american jury...
well, here's your out-- we'll agree not to fire you, not to sue, on one condition.
we stay, and we stay in charge.
do what you want with corporate or tax.
but in litigation, we run the show.
it's our party. Stay out of our way, we'll stay out of yours. That is the deal.
I'm not sure you got the desired effect there, al.
my father used to say, after watching the bruins with bobby orr, it just wasn't the same after.
I think I'll feel that way about watching Alan Shore practice law.
there will never be anyone, ever, like him.
if we break up...
do I need to reach for the oil can?
we still on for dinner?
Yes.
this'll be, like, our third date, Jerry.
hello. Welcome. Hello.
relax. We don't need to kiss.
they have decided to reinstate us.
evidently, they agree it would send a bad message to summarily broom us.
which means they probably just plan to do it more gradually.
perhaps.
they are bringing in somebody new to oversee the litigation department.
who? - I don't know.
but for now, more life from mars, I guess.
well, do we even want it, Shirley?
we could now leave on our own terms.
well...
right now, let's concentrate on the supreme court...
and my wedding, and we'll take it from there.
thank you, Alan.
you. you are really something.
usually, when women tell me that, it's to get inside my
see you tomorrow.
feels good to say that.
how are you doing?
better days. Worse, too.
so we live again.
for now.
hell of a speech, Alan.
I even listened this time.
to all of it? - Don't be ridiculous.
Denny, I've been thinking about what Shirley said, loving life, loving your job.
we've always done both.
but will we under this new regime?
if I could do anything, I think it would be to open my own legal aid firm.
what the hell is that?
well, basically, it's a firm where you give your services away for free.
what's the point?
Denny, in this economy, those are gonna be the first services cut-- legal aid to the poor.
do you think...that I might like poor people?
I've never taken the time to know one.
Oh, they can be very nice once you get to know them.
the problem is funding it.
Plus, I must admit, I enjoy having money to travel and fish, eat well.
you know where this discussion is headed, don't you?
where?
straight to the altar.
Alan... I have more money than god, unless he timed the market.
but I can't give it to you 'cause the government will take half with the gift tax, and I can't die and leave it to you 'cause of the estate tax.
don't get me started.
if you were my spouse, I could give it, I could leave it to you.
what's mine is yours, and the government can't touch it.
Oh, for that matter, you could open a business or start a foundation
in which case, you can't use it for incidentals like travel, fishing.
and the way you go after the government...
they already audit you.
they'll find a way to nail you for commingling or malfeasance or whatever.
the cleanest, simplest, most efficient transfer of property...is marriage.
plus all those other reasons-- medical, spousal privilege...immunity.
it's beyond ridiculous, even for us.
I've always wanted to remarry before I die.
Really? Why?
I just have.
and like it or not...
you're the man I love.
think of all the...
uh, what do you call them, poor people? - YeS.
think of all the poor people you can help, allocating my wealth to them, not the...iraq war or the...wall street bailout.
take my hand, Alan.
take my money.
I always thought if I were to get married again, it would be for...love and romance.
you love me. Romance never lasts. Money can.
okay, Denny. I will marry you.
Really? - Why not?
I suppose it had to come to this.
it'll be great.
Yes, it will.
like jumping a shark.
Hey, how about we do it on the dock of nimmo bay?
perfect.
a salmon in one hand...
me in the other.
let no man tear asunder.
this could be a television series.
on a new network. - One that cares.
alan shore and Denny Crane-- husband and mad cow.
make sure as you stand that you face each other.
it's a pet peeve of mine when couples look like they're
they're going off in different directions even during the ceremony.
okay, then. Now you're going to be giving her away.
and you're obviously the groom.
and that would make you the je Rabbi. Rabbi. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, my god.
I certainly hope you will accept my apology.
may I be really honest, father?
I'm not happy at all with this unio Rabbi?
there's a very old joke-- you know what they call the child of a jew and a christian?
here we go. - A christian.
assimilation. See? Didn't I tell you?
father. - Excuse me?
do you know the most oppressed religion in america today?
christianity. - hear, hear.
it's christmastime.
you know, christmas has become verboten.
you can't even say the word.
interesting. He speaks german.
what? - Rabbi.
maybe we should all start over.
I'd like to know what you meant by that.
well, it's nothing personal.
I just have a little peeve over how the catholic church turned its back on the holocaust.
I love it. A holy war.
at great risk to america, I might add. - Father.
much of the violence directed at our country stems om our support of israel, support which is surely as disproportiona
since israel probably doesn't even need to exist anymore.
Ooh, that should seal it.
did you actually just say israel shouldn't exist? - Rabbi...
come on, Rabbi.
I mean, it was created as a refuge, a safe haven for jews.
it was ugly. The Rabbi stormed out.
the priest refused to give Shirley the use of the church.
why were you rehearsing on a wednesday? Don't those things u
because I'm going to be at the supreme court on friday...
filling a drug prescription.
check out the harelip on that clerk.
Denny, do not say anything offensive. Y, let's just get this done without incident.
may I help you?
Yes, we'd like to ply for a moustache-- a m-marriage license.
you two are getting married?
is there a reason we shouldn't?
other than maybe you and i should get together? - Denny...
we plan an open-door marriage. My card.
you're heterosexual. Are you heterosexual?
is that a problem?
he completes me.
you're getting married? - Is that wrong?
well, yes. - why?
well, it's a sham, Alan. - It is not a sham.
Yes, it is no different than two people who aren't really in love with each other marrying for a green card.
first of all, I love Denny. I believe he loves me.
and there's no requirement that a couple be in love.
in fact, given the current divorce rate, one might say the most insidious problem with marriage is that people make life-altering decisions while in love.
it's a drug, a toxic one at that, and scientifically proven to wear off.
what's toxic is your cynicism.
I think your little scheme is dishonest.
you've been a little testy of late. Do all brides get ornery?
I am-- - uh, you know, let's just move on, shall we?
as you know, the sale of the firm to tsu international has been finalized.
a new head of litigation is expected to be appointed, ostensibly to watchdog us
I suddenly like the new direction of the firm.
um, I have aocument for Mr. Shore and Mr. Crane?
I'll take it. Thank you.
you've gotta be kidding me.
what is it?
it's notice of an injunction proceeding seeking to stop Denny and me from getting married.
what?
that city hall clerk must have ratted us out.
who's filing?
the Massachusetts chapter of the gay and lesbian league.
excuse me? - Of all the hypocrisy.
Katie, pull up whatever law you can on same-sex marriage.
Jerry and I will stay focused on the supreme court case.
as if we haven't got enough to do.
are we done here?
we have one more item.
the new managent has decided to change the name of the firm.
to what?
let me just preface this by saying that personally,
I want my name off the firm...so...
to what?
I simply don't understand...the logic.
your name has such recognition value.
I've destroyed it, haven't I, my name?
no, you haven't.
you know... half the stuff I do, the...nonsense with the sex and...
it's to appear colorful and larger than life, to--to distract people...
from how truly small I've become.
I'm not about to let you sulk and ruin my wedding day.
we'll open our own firm. We don't need them.
we'll overturn it.
the supreme court will never side with the chinese on this. No way.
Denny, we're going to the supreme court to get the drug.
I know that. I'm just saying...
well?
he now says that he might marry us, but not in the church, which is, of course, what I wanted most.
all right. So we find another church.
uh, Carl, d-did you think it was really the smartest idea to bring in that particular Rabbi?
what do you mean? - Well, he's a flaming bigot.
I mean, the catholics are responsible for the holocaust?
he didn't say they were responsible.
he said they turned their backs, which is true.
can we discuss the priest's little gem?
israel doesn't need to exist?
well, that's a political argument.
political? - Yes, and many people have expressed it.
palestinians living in israel will soon outnumber the jews.
the idea of it continuing as a jewish state
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
well, uh, certainly, you've heard it before.
not from you.
I'm not supporting the idea
Oh, t , buyou're defending a priest who is...
please do not raise your voice at me. - Supporting it, and you're calling the Rabbi a bigot?
Yeah, a big one. - Really?
first the chinese. Now the jews. Who's next?
you. Get out. - Oh, with pleasure.
so basically, this marriage is a about money?
Dgjue, I would guess a lot of marriages are.
if you trace the institution to its origins, you'll discover that marriage had its roots in economics.
not love, money. - I find it offensive.
Why? - I'll tell you why.
speaking as a gay man, we have had to fight long and hard for this right.
we have suffered ridicule, hatred, gay bashing.
you're preaching to the all-boys choir. We're with you on that.
no, you're making a mockery of it by-- - we're doing no such thing.
you're blatant heterosexuals. - So what?
are you proposing a rule that every couple be sexually active or procreational?
cause that one's been used against you.
your honor, this is exactly what the religious right and conservative movements have been warning of.
if we allow same-sex marriage, what next?
well, this is what's next.
you will see people exploiting same-sex unions to circumvent
you hypocrite. - All right.
he's suggesting we go into some kind of discovery as to why two people want to marry, the very kind of invasive legislation
this does seem a bit cynical.
you are basically wanting to marry Denny Crane to skirt tax laws.
your honor, in this day and age, the preservation of wealth is paramount.
and I'm sorry, before I see Mr. Crane's money go to fund I-immoral wars or less moral government bailouts, I'd rather see it go to me.
the plans I have for it are far more philanthropic.
and by the way, I love him, okay?
I love the man. He loves me. We're partners.
to say that we cannot get married because we don't have sex is, uh, just as preposterous and bigoted as banning marriage based on who a person chooses to have sex with.
he will be fueling the fire to pass a constitutional ban against
you're the one stoking the embers.
for what it's worth, this isn't just about money.
there are medical reasons.
he happens to be suffering from an incuble illness
you can do that by proxy.
he doesn't want to.
he wants a partner, a legal spouse. - Why?
that's his prerogative, his privacy.
do you seek to invade that, too?
all right. I have heard the arguments.
let me take an hour, and I will decide.
you have no idea what you'll be stirring up.
all right.
is she not beautiful? - Who is she?
opposing counsel. She's arguing for the government.
flying in from tennessee. It's all good, Alan.
she's hot, and doctors say blood flow in any direction is good for my brain.
are you packed? 'Cause we're going straight from court to the airport.
will you stop nagging me? We're not married yet.
just get packed.
this is crazy.
neither of usare very religious people.
we've never even talked about it before.
why are we letting this nonsense stand in our way?
well, most people don't talk about religion, and it doesn't enter into our daily lives, but it is nevertheless a value, and it's obvious that you and I have different values, Carl.
religion's not a value. Spirituality? Yes.
belief in god? Okay. But religion itself?
it's a discipline, one that pretends to be about love, family and charity, too often is a vehicle of hatred and war.
Yeah, well, it's stirring up a little war right now between you and me.
and it really pisses me off that it is politically incorrect to celebrate christmas, but you get all your y
yom kippur, rosh hashanah, hanukkah, passover.
my god, you have a gazillion of them.
little bit of good news.
the... dreaded monster that they're bringing in to oversee litigation?
do we know who it is? - We do.
me.
for whatever reason, I seem to have their trust.
well, that-- that is good news.
Yes.
is there bad news?
Shirley, I don't think I can save Denny.
well, then it's a moot point, fighting for me or Alan or Carl, probably Jerry, maybe Katie.
if you talked to the others-- - I won'T.
Shirley, come on. We've got to face it that Denny
could get better.
if he gets this drug-- it is showing a lot of promise
Denny could improve.
all right, look, I do find th union to be primarily based on mey.
I also agree with Mr. Pinnard
this is the exact kind of exploitation the christian right and others feared.
but I also recognize, people marry for all sorts of reasons.
it's not the government's place to ask why.
Mr. Pinnard, there are many gays who marry heterosexuals.
also gays who marry gays of the opposite sex because they want to start a family, be co-parents-- nothing to do with romantic love.
I hardly think you believe the government should step in and stop that.
same-sex unions are legal in massachusetts.
your motion for an injunction isenied.
we'll go directly from D. C.
we're gonna need somebody from massachusetts to perform the ceremony.
your honor, by any chance do you like to fish?
you can keep the others if you feel it is warranted, but Denny Crane absolutely must go.
the lawyers here are extremely loyal to him.
it doesn't matter. The man is mentally unbAlanced.
he's a danger to himself and others and cannot be allowed to stay.
I will tell you this right now-- I would not want to risk losing Alan Shore.
Mr. Shore needs to be reined in.
we understand he is a brilliant attorney, but he is undisciplined...
and also needs overseeing.
we are not afraid to lose him if we must, in time.
Denny, shouldn't we just go up to the room? We've got a big day tomorrow.
not to mention, I don't want to look puffy on my wedding day.
let's get a nightcap. It'll settle our nerves.
I hear hillary comes here. - Denny, she d
I just want to meet her once before you and I
you know, I think she'd like me.
I have a feeling about us.
you and Hillary? - Yeah.
we're b-- - what?
that's her. - Hillary?
uh, wonder girl from tennessee. She's at the bar.
bet she's staying at the same hotel.
wh-what are you doing?
if I could make her see me as a human being, she'll have mercy on our case tomorrow.
but she won't see you as a human being.
you'll reveal yourself to be the animal that you are.
Oh, give me some credit, will you, please?
you know, I--I'm going up to the room. I've got too much to go over
I'll see you up there.
Denny, don't say anything to that woman that she could use against us tomorrow.
I won't.
double scotch.
Mitch shoemaker. Hello.
it'd be a pleasure to meet you, Mitch, if I had time. Unfortunately, I don't.
Thanks. Whatever she's drinking. - She's not.
look, I'm not hitting on you.
I'm old enough to be your grandfather.
in fact, you remind me of my granddaughter.
have you got a grandpa? Is he in good health?
a lot of them aren't.
Mitch, uh...
can I call you Mitch? 'Cause you look more like a Denny to me.
how'd you know?
you're very famous.
well, I won't bore you with my usual nonsense.
you seem like a very nice young lady.
I have, um, alzheimer's disease.
you're not alone.
over five million americans do, including my own grandmother.
so y-you know.
how can you, uh, take the position you're taking if--if you know?
I would think you'd want your grandmother to have dimebolin.
have you heard the data? It--it helps with cognition, memory.
could be a lifesaver.
and it's only completed two trials.
there's still a lot of testing that needs to be done.
what stage is she in, your grandma?
3
then she's lucid enough to know what you'll be arguing tomorrow.
I'm not going to discuss my family with you, Mr. Crane.
what I can tell you...
there's a very human face on every oneof those five million people, including you.
and tomorrow, I'll be fighting for all of them, including you.
good night, Mr. Crane.
we'll see you in the great hall.
all persons having businessbefore the honorable...
do you think they remember us? - The supreme court the united states...
how could they not?
are admonished to draw near and give their attention... - look at ginsburg.
for the cour sis nowitting. - Does the woman not want me?
God save the united states and this honorable court. - The woman's in heat.
Clarence looks like he wants you, too, Denny.
check out scalia. Cheery mcchuckles.
alito looks glad to see us.
God, it's good to be back.
all right, Ms. Brooks, let's start with you.
thank you, Mr. Chief justice.
may it please the court, the right of the terminally ill to use experimental drugs is nowhere guaranteed in our constitution.
so what?
does every right have to be bestowed by the constitution?
certainly not, your honor, but in the absence of any law or legislative intent, which provides
come on, counsel.
if this man is dying of an incurable disease, why not give him the unapproved drug?
who does it hurt?
first of all, Mr. Crane is not necessarily terminal. He's
you know something about alzheimer's we don't?
I know the disease can take unpredictable courses, particularly when it comes to progression.
and all with the same ending.
the F. D.A. Bans experimental drug use with good reason, because this does not just involve the individual patient.
if untested drugs are suddenly made available, people will forgo entering into clinical drug trials.
promising drugs might not be studied, and therefore, never reach the market. That hurts
over five million people have alzheimer's.
something tells me we'd have plenty of subjects for clinical trials.
with all due respect, justice Scalia, if people can simply buy the drug, they won't choose to enter into a clinical study where they could risk getting a placebo.
why shouldn't a person have a right to medical self-defense?
this court rejected that right in
in marijuana cases where there were other trements avaible.
we let women abort viable fetuses to protect their own lives.
a person may shootn attack dead in self-defense.
shouldn't this man be able to take a drug to save himself, uh, especially, if, uh, it's his only hope?
no.
first of all, dying people are willing to assume any risk, including taking dangerous, untested drugs, which could kill them sooner.
but again, what's the downside
the downside is clinical trials get shortchanged, interfered with.
my grandmother has alzheimer's.
she's one of those five million people.
she sits at home waiting for a cure, desperate for F. D.A. Approval, we've seen how pharmaceutical companies work.
it's not about finding cures so much as it is finding markets, selling.
if they get to peddle promising but untested drugs, we all know they'll do it.
drugs that engender false hopes, ones with higher profit margins if they get to skip the testing.
investors will pump their money into snake oils that dress up well.
this is not a scrupulous industry, your honor.
they most certainly don't deserve a pass on clinical trails, and that is what will effectively happen if untested drugs okare ayed by this court.
this woman is good.
would you forgive a bridezilla going a little nuts during her wedding week?
I'm sorry, Carl.
I wanted to get married in a church.
I wanted everything to be so perfect because I'm marrying the greatest man I have ever known and loved and...
do you still want me?
of course I want you.
if--if you want to raise the kids jewish, I'm okay with that.
even with all the gazillions of holidays?
the only thing I really care about-- I-I do want to celebrate christmas
but there's one thing I really care about, and that is getting to spend the rest of my life with you.
so if you want to elope, let's do it.
I talked to Denny.
he and Alan have a judge, and they're flying up to he proposes we join, make it a joint ceremony.
maybe we should.
Oh, yes!
I had my heart set on a church, but failing that, a fishing lodge.
it's not just a fishing lodge, I'm told.
Shirley, we could be married by this time saturday.
you've certainly come a long way, Mr. Fuddy-duddy.
Oh, darling, who knows how much longer we'll all be together?
a road trip could be fun.
we already have a problem in this country of rushing unsafe drugs to the market--it's epidemic.
and as soon as we allow patients, especially the desperate ones, to exempt drugs from testing, it is going to get exponentially worse.
fewer people will be saved. Rather, more will die.
science trumped by false hope and permissive advertising and
ms. Brooks, the red light habeen on for some time.
if I could just add-- - no. You've exceeded your limit.
I think you should get a little band to play people off, you know, like the oscars or the emmys.
just a thought.
let's be clear on a few things.
this time, you will conduct yourself in a manner befitting this court.
you will address only the issues before this court and ilt dera yourself with a spiraling rant that serves no purpose other than...
what is that?
I'm very sorry.
I have a-a tendency to not, uh, tice the ltle red light, uh, so I programmed my tie to also alert me when I've been talking too long.
evidently, my tie thinks that you have. Though personally, I turn it off. Right now.
Yes, sir.
we go way back.
okay, Mr. Shore, your time is starting right now.
use it wisely.
thank you, Mr. Chief justice.
let me begin by extending a special greeting to justice Thomas. Justice Thomas.
still the chatty cathy. Okay. Where to begin.
that's because most ofthe case law doesn't support us.
but let's be honest, this court isn't that big on precedent anyway, am I right?
I mean, we've had 200 years of the supreme court.
not one found a constitutional right to bear arms, but you happen to like guns, so what the hell?
established case law also, uh, tells us that torture and denial of due process are bad, but evidently, you favor both, so in the guantnamo case, the big never mind.
you people throw out precedent with the morning trash here.
Mr. Shore, I'm curious.
that I didn't know.
what could possibly possess you to want to come in here and be cocky?
do you think this helps your client?
actually, uh, the reason I am a little cocky is because my client, Denny Crane, is the little guy here, and the supreme court of the united states has always, always stood up for the little guy, as they did for oliver brown, a black man who fought for his third-grade daughter to be able to go to t same elemenry school as her best friend, who was white.
though, of course, this particular supreme court has gutted brown vs. Board of education because precedent, as we said, who needs it?
but counsel, I gave you an express directive to stick to this case.
Yes, getting to it, your honor.
uh, you see, I happen to know the little guy is due in this court.
that's why I'm confident.
the little guy has been taking such a beating of late in this room, I just know he's due.
Oh, you think the little guy loses out with us?
don't you?
come on--enron, the makers of medical devices
the tobacco industry has done very well here.
this court heard seven antitrust cases in its first two terms and decided all of them in favor of big corporate defendants.
and, of course, the biggest player on the block, the government, always seems to win.
and then on the other end of that particular seesaw, down there stuck in the mud, we have the losers-- the criminal defendants.
forget it. My god.
just last month, you turned down a stay of execution for a georgia man even though seven of the nine prosecution witnesses recanted.
I guess you just couldn't be bothered with his innocence.
maybe it was a friday, and you had plans.
anytime you want to weigh in, justice thomas, just give me a little wave.
counsel, I have plans. Today.
I have a flight booked at 1: 00 for a vacation which I have looked forward to for a long, long time.
and I will make that flight, counsel, which means as soon as that red light blinks
Yes, your honor, I promise you'll be out of here and on vation in a jiffy.
a-and speaking for all americans, I give you permission to stay away for as long as you like.
but first, there's this matter of the little guy.
he's here in your courtroom, and he's due for a win.
my...
client has alzheimer's.
I know what you're probably thinking, and you're right.
Denny Crane is hardly a little guy.
he's the very biggest.
he is rich, he's famous, he is one of the giants of our profession.
but that isn't really what makes him so...
it's his enormous, foolish heart.
it's his boundless generosity.
Denny has a sense of wonder and innocence like a child with all of the world before him.
he has that capacity for sheer joy that most of us somehow lose along the road to adulthood.
if I could yank that horrible disease out of his body,
I would fight it and I would win.
I would use every ounce of my strength and I would win if I could...
but I can't.
my besfriend is dying of an incurable disease that will rob him of himself before it finally robs him of his life, and I'm sorry,
I don't give a damn what the case law says.
the law...
Y-- you simply cannot look a dying man in the eye and say you don't get the right to try to save yourself.
the law cannot possibly say that, and if it does, it needs to change right now, today.
today.
our problem, Mr. Shore, we have to safeguard the masses.
our rulings don't reach people one person at a time.
but why can't they?
make this ruling apply only to Denny Crane if you choose to.
just make it.
your honor, deeply embedded in this court, in so many of its holdings, is the individual's autonomy and personal dignity.
so tell me, please. Explain to me how that can apply here.
because all I can see is that the indecency of a disease that cripples the body as it rots the brain can only be exceeded by the inhumanity of knowing there's a drug that could help and not letting him have it.
contrary to the public's pception, I think, when asked, most judges and lawyers would say the reason they first went to law school was simply to help people.
this man I love, my friend, desperately needs your help.
I beg the nine of you to look within yourselves and revisit that question.
why did you go to law school?
why did you want to sit up there and wear that robe?
because today, this experimental drug isn't really Denny Crane's last, best hope.
you are. You are.
you know, this is ridiculous.
Yes, and we wouldn't want it any other way.
there it is. Nimmo bay.
don't they get snow? - Indian summer.
all right, let's not waste time.
I don't want to honeymoon with the salmon.
heaven on earth.
Ah, let's send out for some scotch.
nothing younger than 25 years.
are there bears here?
isn't this the time of year they look to fatten up?
this really is beautiful.
I'm afraid of it, but it's beautiful.
what are you afraid of?
Oh, you name it--the water, the woods... Canada.
stop it.
this is your vacation?
Oh, look, he brought his hunting buddy.
Where's the secret service?
your honor, this is fate. You must admit.
don't talk to me. - I won't. I promise.
if I could just ask you one little thing...
I mean, it can't be ex parte. We're on a dock.
could you look any sillier? I know you can.
but have you had an opportunity to think about that little favor I sought to curry in court?
it's just that I'm dying to know.
Denny is, actually.
on monday, the court will issue a one-line memo granting you the use of the experimental drug.
you mean it? I'm cured.
I could just hug you. May I?
I'll have you jailed.
your honor, I truly-- I-I don't know what to say.
I feel--may I call you nino?
because you may not.
I've always heard you were a compassionate man. Now I know it.
I came up here to fish.
if you'll excuse me.
uh, your honor, one last thing.
uh, Denny and I came up here to be married.
I-I know you want to get to the river, and we did bring a judge of our own, but--but the possibility of an upgrade...
I at least have to ask.
we're gonna make this really fast.
which is what we want. If I may say
no, you may not.
do you all take your respective parties to be your lawfully wedded partners, to love, honor and obey till death do you part?
uh, your honor, thatight be a little faster than we thought
do you want me to do this? - we do.
I now pronounce you-- - no, wait.
we were saying "we do" to the question do we want you to do it.
Mr. Shore, the coho are jumping at seymour falls.
your honor, this is our wedding day.
join hands.
are you gonna be serious about this? Because if not
Alan, I've never been more serious about anything in my entire life.
okay, let's go.
do you, Carl and Denny respectively, take Shirley and Alan respectively, to be your lawfully wedded partners, to love, honor and obey
and cherish. Especially cherish.
and cherish...
till death do you part?
I do.
I do.
and do you, Shirley and Alan respectively, take Carl and Denny respectively, to be your lawfully wedded partners, to love, honor, obey and cherish till death do you part?
I do.
I do.
you all understand what it means to be married?
this is a sacred thing.
the commitment to love one another, to be there for each other matter what...
do you really all get that?
we get it, your honor.
look at me.
by the powers vested in me as justice of the supre court and by the powers of the commonwealth of massachusetts
I can't speak for Canada
I now wife...
and you husband and husband.
what god has brought together, let no man and no court tear asunder.
you may kiss the bride.
Oh, uh, one-- one at a time.
Alan, you first.
Denny, gently.
and now Carl... my husband.
good luck to you all. - thank you, your honor.
thank you so much, your honor. - Thank you, justice.
I love you, man.
I love you, too, Denny.
Oh, Shirley.
may I have my wedding dance with you?
it's just that I've always dreamed of dancing with you in this dress, looking exactly the way you do.
Denny, don't you think Carl should get this dance?
let him grab the next one.
he's got you forever. I-I just, uh...
you really are a good sport, Carl.
I'm a good sport?
Alan, has it sunk in yet... who you're married to?
uh, judge? - Why not?
long day.
but a good one.
it was wonderful. A spectacular day.
what couples they made.
Yes, they did.
thank you, Jerry, for being my charming date.
and canada was great. - Beautiful.
I'm not afraid of it anymore.
and how great is that? - Yeah.
to conquer one's fear of a foreign country.
great day. - Fab.
let's not make ourselves dizzy.
now... I feel dizzy.
somebody's been here. - Who?
I don't know, but clearly somebody.
probably staff celebrating our wedding.
they could've cleaned up.
you're not gonna be a neatreak, are you?
don't start with me.
I tell you, Alan...
I woke up this morning, I thought the end was near, but this drug...
I can feel the fog lifting just thinking about it.
we're married. - can you believe it?
we will face ridicule, Denny, abuse.
don't be fooled.
it's all worth it.
I love ya.
I love you, too.
you know, I was watching you dance with Shirley, and for a second,
I thought you were having one of your moments...
where you actually believed you and she were...
had one of those moments yesterday.
you thought she was your wife?
no, I thought you were my son.
proud moment for a dad, I'll tell you that...having you as my son.
that's something.
are we gonna stay with this firm, or are we gonna open a new one?
we don't have to decide tonight.
let's just sit here like an old married couple.
you know, I was a little hurt you danced with Shirley instead of
here we go. - I'm just saying.
come on. - We did get married.
I think a little attention is in order before your eye starts roving.
you wanted a dance? - I did.
let's do it now. - No, the moment has passed.
no, it hasn'T. We're here now. We're in the moment.
I don't want a mercy dance.
is this the way it's gonna be?
Alan... our wedding dance.
don't try anything funny, and I want to lead. - Why should you
you got to lead with Shirley. It's my turn. Just dance.
you're leading. - I'm not.
well, then quit shoving me around.
if you plan to dominate me in this marriage, let's undo it right now.
Oh, well, that's "till death do us part" commitment.
I can call scalia right now-- - you want to undo it now.
just be quiet.
seize the moment.
it's our wedding night.
it's our wedding night.
I can't help you get through this if you wont tell me what it is Walt did.
A. - Two men are coming to kill you.
come again. - Two men ambushed Hank.
there tattoos indicate an affiliation with the drug cartel.
you knew my brother when I was with the DEA.
I investigate everyone I do business.
I am sleeping with my boss and I don't know why.
b
what's up partner?
this is my replacement?
in the litlle village where I was born, life moved at a slower pace...
yet felt all the richer for it.
there, my two uncles were known far and wide for their delicious cooking.
they seasoned their zesty chicken using only the freshest herbs and spices.
people called them "Los Pollos Hermanos"-- the Chicken Brothers.
today, we carry on their tradition in a manner that would make my uncle proud.
the finest ingredients are brought together with loving care...
then slow-cooked to perfection.
Yes, the old ways are still best at Los Pollos Hermanos.
but don't take my word for it.
one taste and you'll know.
Jesus, seriously.
better over than under.
over by a pound and a half.
I thought you were all, like, precise.
whatever. We'll just save it out till next week.
no. We ship it as-is.
what are we, running a charity?
come on, man, we're gonna take it out.
leave it.
one batch, one ship.
stop complicating things.
why are you purposely giving him free meth?
these bitches are bleeding us enough already.
you are paid extraordinarily well.
why can't you just appreciate that?
Hey, I been crunching numbers, all right?
Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
Yeah, I've been crunching numbers, and I don't gotta be a mathematician to figure out that this deal you made is bullshit.
we both earn.
I know...a million and a half each.
what's he getting?
say he's wholesaling at 40 large a pound.
that's probably high.
high.
uh, what, for our stuff?
that's what I was getting.
all right, look, say he's getting 40 a pound.
all right? 200 pounds a week for three months.
and, like, what happens at the end of the three months?
look, what-- whatever.
200 pounds a week for three months.
that's 2400 pounds.
2400 times 40, 000 is-- and I swear to God, I double-checked this, like, 10 times.
96 million dollars. - 96 million dollars.
all right? 96 million. 96 to our three.
that is messed up, yo.
that is so messed up.
Fairness-wise, I can't even.
Jesse, you are now a millionaire, and you're complaining?
what world do you live in?
one where the dudes who are actually doing all the work ain't getting fisted.
what is going on with you lately?
what's happened to you?
hang on, can't we just-- Hey, we got to hash this out.
Hey, what's more important than money?
these things they laughingly call pillows,
I would not give them to prison inmates.
you want me to go ask for another?
no. Just remind me to bring his from home.
they're not moving his legs enough.
Hey, everybody.
Oh... Hi, Marie.
is it okay if-- if I visit?
Yeah.
his color looks good.
Gomie, is that you?
Hey, buddy. Yeah, it's me.
that's you, Gomie?
Yeah, Hank.
I'm right here.
come here.
closer.
what is it?
closer.
asshole.
man, he got you good.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm glad to see you still have your twisted sense of humor.
Hey, check this out.
I got something that'll make you feel better.
I've been keeping an eye on that blue meth of yours.
six, seven weeks, nothing.
then all of a sudden, boom.
it's popping up everywhere.
look at the new locations.
texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.
even right here in town.
a teener here and there, you know, strictly street-level amounts.
man, it's crazy.
how exactly is that supposed to make me feel better?
beuse you were right.
you're the only one that saw this coming.
well, three cheers for me.
this thing doesn't do a damned thing.
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.
it's been an hour, right?
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.
okay. I'll go find somebody.
Hey, no more shop talk.
sorry.
I didn't see it coming.
what?
damn right you did.
no, I didn't see shit.
day late and a dollar short, as usual.
the only reason I'm... even breathing...is I got a warning call.
a warning call? What do you mean?
one minute before they attacked me, somebody called my cell and told me to expect it.
a voice scrambler.
it could have been anybody.
Marie's got my phone somewhere, if you want to run the incoming.
not that you're going to learn anything worth knowing.
I don't get it.
cartel hit?
who would have called to warn you?
I don't know.
Aw, Jesus.
come on already.
hang on.
Skyler, I had nothing to do.
are we safe? - Yes.
are you safe?
Absolutely.
what about you?
face looks better.
how's it all going? Anything you want to tell us about?
what, like my interesting life?
one day pretty much bleeds into the next.
been working a lot.
I got a job.
job is good.
it's in a Laundromat.
it's totally corporate.
corporate Laundromat.
it's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape. My boss is a dick.
the owner? Super dick.
I'm not worthy or whatever to meet him, but I guess everybody's scared of the dude.
the place is full of dead-eyed douche-bags, the hours suck, and nobody knows what's going on, so...
sounds kind of Kafkaesque. - Yeah.
totally Kafkaesque.
majorly.
Ooh, from the U. S.attorney in Santa Fe.
very nice.
we've got all these nice tulips and baby's breath.
this is chrysanthemum. That looks like chrysanthemum.
look at these Hank. Aren't they beautiful?
beautiful.
look at the size of this basket.
it's got so many goodies in it.
look, chocolate-covered pretzels and cheese sticks and some some fancy designer olives.
you had me at cheese sticks.
Mmm, you're going to have to fight me for those, Hank.
get well, and best wishes from Ted Beneke and all the folks at Beneke Fabricators.
wow, he gives you all this time off, and now this?
get me a job there.
I know. He's great.
boss hall of fame.
I don't see anything here from Kleinman.
they're going to have to get on the stick.
how's everybody doing today?
good. We're good.
how are you? - I'm very good.
Hi, Hank.
just going to do a quick peripheral response, all right?
see where we're at.
moment of truth, huh?
Yeah. I wouldn't call it that.
all right, let's just take a look here.
all right.
all right, I want you to tell me if you can feel this.
all right.
how about this?
okay.
how about now?
do that one again, would you?
right there?
Yeah, yeah, I feel it. A tingle.
okay, on a scale of one to ten, ten being your normal level of feeling and one being no feeling at all.
Oh, I don't know.
a four?
okay, four. Okay.
and how about there?
Yeah.
um, a six.
okay, good.
and here?
Yeah, still there. A little less.
a three. - Okay.
all right, good.
thank you very much, Hank. Good, good.
so this is good news, right?
Oh, yeah, definitely.
it looks like some nerve function is returning.
Oh, thank God.
all right, so when do we get him walking again?
Marie, it's important that we manage our expectations.
we're talking about months of very hard work, and even then the odds, they're not great.
but you can't know for sure.
no.
when does he start physical therapy?
we've sent the paperwork to your insurance.
it's high priority.
we should have pre-authorization the next few days.
certainly by early next week.
next week?
no, that's not going to do it.
I've looked into this.
the sooner physical therapy begins, the better his chances are.
he needs daily sessions.
isn't that right? - Well...
actually, your plan's treatment program covers four sessions a week.
actually, she asked the doctor.
Plan-wise, four sessions a week is fairly typical.
and the therapists in your network are mostly fine.
mostly fine? Okay. There's a ringing endorsement.
look, if Hank had more physical therapy, with better therapists, wouldn't it be more likely he would walk?
it's very hard to say, Marie.
is the health plan's way medically justifiable?
sure.
is it absolutely optimal?
you know, screw it.
I'm going to make sure he gets what he needs, and they can just reimburse me later.
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
really, I do.
but my best advice is stay in the network.
don't go out of pocket.
physical therapy is just the beginning.
we're talking nursing care, modifications to your home, occupational therapy, medical equipment.
it could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
so what?
we're just supposed to compromise on his care?
well, if you don't follow the insurance company's procedures, they may never pay you back.
I've seen patients and their families go bankrupt, waiting to be reimbursed.
who is the best physical therapist that you know?
I can give you some names.
but they're not likely to be on your plan.
to hell with the plan.
Yeah, there he is.
finally.
I went ahead and started without you.
ladies, this is Jesse-san.
he's in for the full treatment.
kick off your shoes. Lay back.
Exfoliate.
maybe later.
so, where's the maestro? Out parking the mini-van?
what do I look like, his shadow? Who cares where he's at?
what am I doing here?
well, I was going to have you two flip a coin, but since the genius can't be bothered, today's your lucky day.
look around, kiddo.
it's all yours.
what?
this?
Yeah.
you are now the owner of this fine establishment.
for free?
free? Ladies, cover your ears.
no, not free.
look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean, highly profitable--at least potentially local institution, looked upon with favor by the Chamber of Commerce.
better Business Bureau.
at $312, 000, it's a steal.
312, 000?
don't you get it?
on the outside, it's a nail salon, right?
on the inside, it's the best money laundry a growing boy could ask for.
wait, wait. Wait.
ladies, thank you.
thank you. Good job.
come back here. Sit. Come on.
humor me here for a second.
now, you know you need to launder your money, right?
do you understand the basics of it?
placement, layering, integration?
I ain't buying no damn nail salon, so just forget it.
you want to stay out of jail, don't you?
you want to keep your money and your freedom.
because I got three little letters for you. IRS.
if they can get Capone, they can get you.
Hey, look.
here's you, right? Pink, Pinkman. Get it?
okay, here's your cash.
you're out on the town.
you're partying hearty.
you're knocking boots with the chickie babes.
Oh, who's this?
it's the tax man.
and he's looking at you.
what does he see?
he sees a young fellow with a big, fancy house, unlimited cash supply, and no job.
now what is the conclusion the tax man makes?
I'm a drug dealer.
wrong. Million times worse.
you're a tax cheat.
what do they do?
they take every penny, and you go in the can for felony tax evasion.
what was your mistake?
you didn't launder your money.
now, you give me your money.
that's called placement.
hand me that little thinGod bin.
this is the nail salon, right?
I take your dirty money and I slip it into the salon's nice, clean cash flow.
that's called layering.
final step, integration.
the revenues from the salon go to the owner.
that's you.
your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice, clean, taxable income, brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business.
so you want me to buy this place so I can pay taxes.
I'm a criminal, yo.
Yeah, and if you want to stay a criminal and not become, say, a convict, then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.
right, so you can get your 5%.
no, that's 17%.
I heard you say 5%.
you said it right in front of me.
that was for your partner.
it's privileges of seniority and all.
but for you, it's the usual. 17%, and that's a bargain.
Hey, what, you-- Hey, listen to
come on, I'm talking to you about your future here.
listen to reason.
how is your brother-in-law?
he'll live.
good.
I'm glad.
Walter, you seem troubled.
how can I help you?
I asked to see you in order to... clear the air.
there are some issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us, and I think it's in our best interest to lay the cards on the table.
that's the best way to do business.
my brother-in-law, moments before he was attacked someone called to warn him.
I believe that same person was protecting me.
those two men, the assassins-- I believe I was their prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law.
because of this intervention, I am alive.
and yet I think that this person was playing a much deeper game.
he made that phone call because he wanted a shootout, not a silent assassination.
in one stroke he bloodied both sides, set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest.
if this man had his own source of product on this side of the border he would have the market to himself.
the rewards would be... enormous.
we're both adults.
I can't pretend I don't know that person is you.
I want there to be no confusion.
I know I owe you my life.
and more than that, I respect the strategy.
in your position, I wouldn't done the same.
one issue which troubles me.
I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends.
what would you like to happen?
you know why I do this.
I want security for my family.
then you have it.
three million for three month.
that was our agreement.
extended annually, twelve million a year.
call it fifteen.
open-ended.
would that be agreeable?
part of the reason we talk about what gets us riled up, in our daily lives is to help each other put a finger on what our relapse triggers might be, head off our disease before it comes back.
so... anyone?
free license to bitch and moan.
how often do you get that?
Jesse, last time you seemed pretty down about your job at the Laundromat.
let me ask you something.
if you had the chance to do anything you wanted, what would you do?
make more green, man, a lot more.
forget about money. Assume you have all you want.
um... I don't know.
I guess I would make something.
like what?
not that it even matters, but... work with my hands, I guess.
building things, like... carpentry or brick laying or something?
I took this vo-tech class in high school, wood working.
because it was just a big Jesus--, but this one time I had this teacher name of, uh... Mr. Pike.
I guess he was, like, a Marine or something before he got old.
he was hard of hearing.
my project for his class was to make this wooden box, you know, like a small-- just like a-- like a box, you know, to put stuff in.
so I wanted to get the thing done just as fast as possible.
I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester, and he couldn't flunk me as long as I, you know, made the thing.
so I finished it in a couple days.
it looked pretty lame, but it worked, you know, for putting stuff in or whatnot.
so when I showed it to Mr. Pike for my grade, he looked at it and said, "Is that the best you can do?"
at first I thought to myself,"Hell, yeah, bitch."
now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys.
I don't know.
maybe it was the way he said it, but... it was, like, he wasn't exactly saying it sucked.
he was just asking me honestly,"Is that all you got?
and for some reason I thought to myself,"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.
I made another, then another, and by the end of the semester, by, like, box number five, I had built this thing.
you should've seen it. It was insane.
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian Walnut with inlaid Zebrawood.
it was fitted with pegs, no screws.
I sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass.
then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark.
it even smelled good.
you know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was-- It was perfect.
what happened to the box?
I, um-- I gave it to my mom.
nice.
you know what I'm going to say, don't you?
it's never too late.
they have art co-ops that offer classes, adult extension program at the university.
you know, I didn't give the box to my mom.
I traded it for an ounce of weed.
he's a hero. You don't deny coverage to a hero.
they'll say they're not denying coverage.
no, no, I'm agreeing with you, but I went through all this with Walt.
you'll burn through your savings, and then what?
well, you two managed, right?
you said yourself that Elliot and Gretchen's money didn't cover everything.
Jesus, I've got to get back.
what? No.
no, no, no, you should rest.
look, why don't you go in and take a long bath I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
I want to be there in case he wakes up.
with all they're giving him, he'll sleep till morning.
Hey, Sky.
Hey. Wha-- What are you doing here?
well, I just thought I'd stop by to see how you're holding up.
is this a bad time, or...
Hi. - Hi.
uh, Marie, this is Ted, my boss.
Oh, you're Ted.
I've heard so much about you.
thank you for your gift basket.
that was really thoughtful.
it was. It was really nice. Thank you, Ted.
cheese sticks. - Cheese sticks.
well, you're welcome.
you know, we care about Skyler so much that naturally that extends to the whole family.
are you coming in?
Oh, yeah, you should.
I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
Thanks. - Okay.
we were just having some wine. Would you like a glass?
no. No, thanks.
I'm just on my way home. I just thought I'd you know, I-- I am really beat.
I think I'm going to take that bath.
it was nice to meet you, Ted, and thank you again.
nice to meet you, too, Marie.
please give my best wishes to your husband.
I will.
thanks for stopping by, but it's actually not the best time for a visit, so can we just talk for a minute?
I know you need to be with your family, but I haven't heard from you in days I left messages.
I'm so sorry. You gave me all that time off, and I really should've.
that's not my point. I-- I care about you. That's all.
Ted, I...It's just this whole thing with Hank has been one non-stop horror show, you know, so...
well, I-- I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
thank you.
um, but I really do need you to...
okay? - Okay.
Skyler, I've got to say your sister seeing me here--I mean...So what?
I'm divorced. You're divorced. So what?
okay, let's talk about it later, Ted, okay?
is there some reasonfor sec? Because.
later. Ted, not now.
Skyler, just tell me... - You really want to do this now?
are you really going to make me do this right now?
Yeah, you're right.
bad idea to come here.
Ted, I'm-- I'll see you in a day or two.
back at the office.
take as much time as you want.
I can't believe you had to crush the RV.
must've been, like... depressing.
for real. That's a stone loss.
no one misses it more than me.
free to cook anytime, anywhere.
no quotas, no one to answer to.
what's the point of being an outlaw when you've got responsibilities?
darth Vader had responsibilities.
he was responsible for the Death Star.
true that. Two of them bitches.
just saying. Devil's advocate.
I've got to pay taxes now?
what the hell's up with that? That's messed up, yo. That's Kafkaesque.
church. - Right.
let's kick it back into gear.
let's start slinging again.
let's dot. Life's too short. That's what I say.
hell, yeah, bitches. We don't need no RV.
alls we need is a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles...
Nah, nah, nah, no shake 'n bake. Where's your self-respect? Come on.
yo, maybe it ain't top shelf, but we could at least move it.
still kind of dry out there. Let's-- It'll sell on the street.
who says we sell on the street?
maybe I know a whole new market.
maybe alls we need is the meth.
what's the yield?
the yield. Come on.
uh... 201. 8.
I see a couple new faces.
anybody want to introduce themselves?
don't all speak at once.
so my name's Brandon.
okay, Brandon.
you want to tell us something about yourself?
well, why I'm here-- it's just one thing.
it's meth.
it's bad.
thought I had it kicked a couple times, you know, but then... Jesus.
this new version of it hit the streets and... wow.
not that blue stuff.
Oh, sorry, I didn't raise my hand.
no, go ahead. This is what we do.
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.
you had it, to Yeah, bro.
I wish I never even heard of it.
it was like lighting my whole head on fire.
Yeah, stuff will burn you down.
only reason I have a hope in hell is because it's long gone.
that's the shame of it.
Nah, come on, man. Don't tell me that.
I hear it's back in town.
stay strong, brother. Stay strong.
it's gonna be okay.
I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.
I will go to 48 Hours.
I will go to Nightline.
I don't even know if there is a Nightline anymore. It doesn't matter.
they will all take it, and they will run with it because he is a hero, and he is not going to be in a wheelchair at 43.
Jesus.
Marie, I know Skyler's already told you this, but if there's every anything that you need, anything at all...
it's good to have you here.
both of you.
I just wish there was... something more that we could do.
we can always pay their bills.
please, it's tens of thousands of dollars.
we have the money, more than enough. Walt earned it.
I think Marie should know the truth.
Skyler, I really don't think this is a good idea. I think that he earned it gambling.
Walt and I, uh-- We've had our problems lately. You know that.
and, uh... what it all came down to really was... money.
pure and simple.
when Walt was diagnosed, it, um-- It changed him.
looking back, I don't think I ever really understood what it was that he was going through.
it was more than facing death.
it was knowing that he was going to leave behind... nothing.
and so that's how this all started.
for better or worse, he wanted to provide, and so...
he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how.
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen paid for your treatment.
Yeah, I thought so, too, but the truth is he never took their money, not a dime.
he was too proud to take what he considered to be charity.
isn't that right?
so he put his mindo it and-- Well, you know how Walt is.
he's-- He's a problem solver, and he read books, and he did a whole bunch of research, and he came up with... this system.
a system?
a system for counting cards in Blackjack.
W-what do you mean, like Rain Man?
well, I don't pretend to understand, you know, all the details, but he was convinced that if you put enough money into it, he'd have a, um, uh-- God, what is it?
a statistical edge?
so he-- Every spare minute, Walt was at some card table somewhere, and at first he went to the casinos, but then he realized that but then he realized that the casinos report your winnings to the IRS, and if it gets reported, your family might find out, and if you do not want your family to find out, then you find another place to gamble, like an illegal, backroom game.
you remember all those long walks that Walt used to take, all that time he used to spend away from home?
I guess for a couple months there you were sort of leading a double life, weren't you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, your-- your fugue state, was that some sort of cover?
no. No.
he did not fake that, Marie.
the night that Walt disappeared... he los$14, 000.
it was his pension fund, our savings, basically every last dime we had to our name, gone.
he couldn't live with it.
he was suicidal.
but you have to try to understand that as soon as he got out of the hospital, he went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.
how could you do that to her, Walt?
anyway, this system of his... he finally got it to work.
so all this is to say we have the money.
no more gambling.
but we have the money.
how... much money?
it's in the seven figures.
Oh, God. Holy Mary, Mother of God.
what can I say?
I did very well.
Marie... you will take our money.
use it to take care of Hank.
please.
Marie, let us help.
does Walt, Jr. know about this?
absolutely not, and I need to keep it th way, and Hank...okay
Hank's got enough on his mind right now, so can we just please keep this between us?
Yeah. Yeah, I--Yeah, I--I just--I need to.
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.
how did you come up with that?
I mean, where-- where did you possibly.
I learned from the best.
somehow something tells me that Hank is here because of you.
and I'm not forgetting that.
son of a
I'm not leaving.
Walt, I'm not leaving.
Oh, my God.
I can hear your cell phone ringing!
this is ridiculous. I can't...
uh, what is going on with you?
I've left you, like, 23 messages.
And?
And?
we need to talk about the car wash.
you know, Skyler, now is not a good time for me, okay?
can we talk about this later?
no, okay? We can't.
why are you do...
Oh, Jesus.
what happened?
nothing. I just bumped it. That's all.
okay, I'm-- I'm coming in.
okay, exactly what happened?
it's complicated, and I don't wish to discuss it.
it's none of your concern.
are you in danger?
Walt, I need you to look me in the eye and tell me right now, are you in danger?
you know what?
let's just say that I have a hell of a lot more on my mind right now than thinking about buying a d--- car wash.
okay.
so if you could just please...
okay. Then we go to the police.
what?
we tell them everything
that you're a drug dealer afraid for your safety, and the safety of your family.
...and you need help.
what choice is there, Walt?
what choice?
if you're in danger
...then it would be absolutely
stop, stop, stop.
you keep saying that word "Danger"
danger. - But you just said
no, and I have never used that word.
I said things were complicated, and then you flew off the handle.
Yeah, I flew off the handle when I saw that, okay?
Where'd that come from? Hmm?
a fall in the shower?
uh, this is just so passive-aggressive, you know? I...
Passive-aggressive? Are you...
I go two days without returning your phone calls, two days, and I have one minor little incident, and now you're telling me to
I should turn myself in to the police, for God's sake.
a minor little incident? - Yes.
what minor little incident?
I had an argument with a co-worker.
okay?
And?
I had an argument.
we were in this bar, and we were discussing a particular business strategy, and it got heated and out of control, and he hit me-- once.
and I didn't retaliate because he's a much older man.
and that's it.
you were in a bar fight?
Yes, Skyler,
I was in a bar fight.
so you're okay?
Really?
Yes. I'm okay.
and I think in the end it may have been a good thing, actually, because we were able to clear the air and, you know, mutual respect.
so
frozen peas.
what?
it's the best thing for the swelling.
Oh, it's not really swollen.
it's
no peas.
you don't even have ice.
I will get peas. I will get ice.
peas and ice. I'm writing it down.
I need you to...
promise me that - if things do get dangerous... - Skyler.
promise me.
Absolutely.
so
car wash.
honey. John.
Hi, there. Can I answer any questions?
Yes.
any chance of a top-off?
Oh, I think we can help you out there.
so what do you think?
Oh. Very nice. Very open.
Oh. I agree. It flows.
a whole lot of natural light.
uh, Michael Kilbourne.
Tori Costner.
it's nice to meet you.
well, three bedrooms, one and a half baths, on just under half an acre.
that's a non-attached casita out in back, permit usable as office or guest suite.
plank wood floors.
central heat and air.
I see you're married.
no. Divorced, Very recent.
old habits.
Oh. I'm sorry.
any children?
Yes. As a matter of fact, a little boy.
Oh. How old?
uh, he turned 4 in May.
he's a Gemini. Would love this yard.
Oh, well, plenty of space for a jungle gym, and the neighborhood preschool is fantastic.
Oh, well, I think Eli is going to be home-schooled.
Oh, well, great.
not for religious reasons or anything.
I just want to make sure that he's getting enough attention.
he'll still go to summer camp and whatnot, you know, play dates.
I don't want him to be socially awkward.
Oh, no. Makes a lot of sense.
he tests very highly
96 percentile
but that whole right brain, left brain
you want those in balance.
you said the casita has plumbing?
I will go out with clay, so I need access to running water.
well, it's pipe fitted for a quarter bath, so make a perfect studio.
this could work.
that's the doctor's plan to get her patients at ease, if you know what I mean.
but, nurse, I'm not one
Hello! I'm back!
Hank?
Yeah.
I had to go to three different places to get the moisturizer that you like, but I got that, and I got your Shiner Bock and your chips, and I couldn't resist.
the Complete Encyclopedia to Fantasy Football.
look, it has all the latest rankings.
Marie, I said Chee-tos, not Fritos.
w-wait. Uh
I must have said Chee-tos, like, ten times.
you need me to write it down for you?
no, and I don't need you to be mean about it, either, Mr. Grumpy.
well, I'm just saying, you know.
I said Chee-tos. Ch-Ch-Ch sound, virtually impossible to confuse Chee-tos with Fritos, it seems to me.
where are you going?
uh, back to the store, I guess.
here.
and the draft's not for two months, so this is useless.
can you believe it?
what?
what? This.
well, you always thought this place could be bugged.
now we know.
Yeah, well, I don't like it.
it's a violation of the work space.
Yeah, I guess.
want to do something?
do something? Like what?
Go-karts?
Go-karts? What
Yeah, there's a track down by the Coliseum.
it's pretty fun.
no.
actually, I have
I have a meeting, so
all right. Whatever.
rain check?
Yeah, Sure.
how you doing?
good.
yeah?
you okay?
is there, uh, anything we should talk about?
how's your eye?
Yeah, it's fine.
anything we should talk about?
for what it's worth...
getting the shit kicked out of you...
not to say you, uh, you get used to it, but...
you do kind of get used to it.
two words-- nail salon.
it's perfect for money laundering.
it's a high volume cash-preferred business with a discreet work force.
I mean, nobody does "Mister, me know nothing"
better than Mrs. Mookjaiaporn and her gals.
Mr. Goodman
saul, please. Now, for the lady of the house
drum roll, please
how about a lifetime supply of French manicures and enzyme peels?
Ah, yeah. Go ahead, pinch yourself.
we're not buying a nail salon, Mr. Goodman.
we're getting the car wash.
I'm sorry. Am I missing something here?
I mean, didn't you already try that?
Yeah. I mean, Walt told me that you, uh, took a run at this Bogdan character, and he wrestled you into submission with his eyebrows.
10 million, that was the asking price, right?
apparently, he upped it to 20.
ha ho! Nice negotiating.
Yeah. I-- Hey, you bombed. It happens.
you were smart to call me.
now-- Uh, you just sit back, relax, and let a professional take over.
who is that?
that's for me. Excuse me.
what do you want? I'm in a meeting.
why didn't you think of that before?
it's not my
I'm in a meeting.
can Huell use your bathroom?
Huell?
uh, sure. The top of the stairs.
he'll be quick.
it's a stomach thing.
so where were we?
professionalism.
Yeah. Um, so the guy won't sell, he won't sell.
I don't accept that.
I don't accept that he won't sell.
I-- I think he just lacks the proper...
motivation.
motivation. Oh. Uh, as in "Motivation" motivation?
I mean, just so we're on the same page here.
you're saying we make him an offer he can't refuse?
nothing so dramatic as that, no.
motivation.
attitude adjustment.
this one, she's a keeper.
well, an audit can be highly motivating.
I know a gal over at Tax and Revenue.
you give her ten minutes on this Bogdan fella's books, she'll have his sky raining frogs.
no, we don't want to draw any unwanted tax attention.
we don't want them looking at us after Bogdan sells.
all right. How about an I. C.E. raid?
you know he's got illegals working over there.
I mean, he just has to.
we are not getting a bunch of poor innocent people in trouble, no.
Yeah. And also, you're going to need them after you take over.
Hey. How about terrorism?
Oh, Agent Hoover, I got to tell you, "I've seen some real Islamic comings and goings over there at the car wash.
Yeah, I mean guys in turbans pulling up in vans and stuff like that. Ha ha!
saul, Bogdan is Romanian.
okay, well, we're... we're just spitballing here, so...
okay, there's always...
you got a real nice place here.
a shame if something happened to it.
that angle.
what are you talking about?
violence?
attitude adjustment.
Oh, no. That? No.
that is not at all what I meant.
I... We do not do that.
that's not who we are, right?
Yeah. No. No.
no, she... she's right.
look, do I need to state the obvious?
I mean, there's got to be dozens of car washes in this area.
who says it has to be this one?
I do.
I say it has to.
Why?
I just do.
G...
well, that clears things up.
I don't like him... Bogdan.
he was condescending to me, rude about you, and I do not like him.
simple as that.
Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do, but, uh, in this business, and Walt can back me up on this, the number 1 rule is...
don't take things personally.
what do you... What do you mean, rude about me?
something along the lines of...
you weren't man enough to face him yourself.
what?
that you had to send your woman to do your business for you.
okay, uh, speaking as your lawyer,
I'm going to go on record and say this is a bad idea.
now, I advise against...
it's this one.
okay. So, uh...
all we have to do is think of a nonviolent, unsuspicious way to purchase the car wash that... that... that protects the innocent and doesn't cost $20 million.
don't everybody speak at once.
Hi.
can I answer any questions?
Oh. Spoons.
Yes. The owner is quite the collector.
aren't they something?
one for each of the 50 states.
uh, Puerto Rico is technically a territory.
you know, maybe they were thinking...
some day.
uh, so no basement.
no basement. Sorry.
that's a problem. My brother's in the Peace Corps, and won't be back for 18 months, and I said I'd hang on to his furniture.
well, if you're looking for storage space, there's an attic area that's sizeable.
Oh. Huh. Well, an attic might be even better, as long as it's dry.
let's take a tour. - Okay.
actually, I have a handout for you.
it has all the information.
I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way.
Charlotte Blattner.
so nice to meet you, Charlotte.
you, too.
so I just told him point-blank...
you're my husband, and I love you.
but you're 53 years old.
this job has just gotten too stressful and difficult, and it's time to quit.
and, miracle of miracles, he listened.
still, what a fascinating career that must have been for him.
it was. I mean,
nasa was like a second family to us, but, you know, it was time for a new adventure, so, between his pension and the income I bring in from hand modeling, we're, you know, comfortable.
uh, when were these floors redone?
two years ago, and the counters are brand new.
I can tell. Travertine.
hmm. Nice.
any children?
no.
I don't really want kids.
is that horrible for me to say, do you think?
not at all. Not everyone has to have children.
hmm. You should talk to my husband.
uh, garbage disposal?
check it out.
score, yo.
I really love your home.
well, thank you, Mimi.
it has a... very European feel.
you think?
Oh, I lived in London for years, so yeah, this feels familiar.
where in London?
I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.
right downtown.
but we were almost never there.
my husband is an illustrator, so we traveled a lot...
Paris, Italy, Denmark.
it was before the kids were in school, so it was easy to pick up and go.
that was before my youngest, Lucy, was diagnosed with endocarditis.
Oh, my.
gosh, is that, uh
it's a bacterial infection of the heart valves.
it's-- Yeah, it can be
Mmm. That's terrible.
is she all right?
your daughter.
is she okay?
Yes. Th-Thank you.
um, the doctor's put her on a prosthetic valve, so she's... Lucy's fine.
running and walking, riding horses.
well, thank goodness.
Yeah. We're...very lucky.
excuse me. Miss?
very nice. Thank you!
I just called the police.
okay, then.
I know you stole that spoon.
what spoon? What are you talking about?
you're a thief.
excuse me? - And a liar, making stories up about yourself. What's wrong with you?
no. What's the matter with you, lady?
you better just back off, okay?
my husband is a DEA agent.
I thought he was an astronaut or an illustrator.
you better get your crazy lies straight.
you know what, fatty?
you are so lucky that I am late for an appointment.
you're not going anywhere.
let go of my purse.
let go! - Not until the police get here.
let go of it! Let it go!
let it go!
let it...go!
you are in big trouble.
Yeah.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
just sl
slow down. Start from the
you
you're where?
why the f
why are you
are you seriously doing this to me again?
Jesus, just stop
would you stop crying?
I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight.
where do they got you?
so good news. The officer spoke to the homeowners, and they're not going to press charges.
good. I won't, either.
okay, then, so we're good to go.
you ready?
Marie, you want to go home?
Marie?
Yes, it's Skyler White calling for Saul Goodman, please.
Yes, it is important.
thank you.
sorry. Same as before.
but this is not right.
you cannot shut me down. You cannot do this.
Mr. Wolynetz, I've checked your waste water inside and out.
I've checked your runoff gutters, and now out here more contaminants
ammonia, acetone, benzene, nitrobenzene.
no, no, no. This is a mistake.
where is Gary? He will tell you my soap is very good, very green.
no, your soap is not the issue.
it's your filtration system.
at the very least, you'll need to retrofit.
but if you're leeching into the ground water, which is looking like a real possibility here, you're going to need to replace your system entirely.
replace? Do you know how much cost that is?
200000
look, I understand it's a hardship.
if you like, we can give you a list of approved vendors.
if you get going immediately, your down time shouldn't be any more than four or five weeks.
okay. So sorry. You're right.
from now on, we will be extra careful and, uh, clean.
no more pollution, okay?
yes? - No, I'm sorry.
the state requires you to suspend all commercial activity until these levels reach the mandated minimums.
where is usual man? Where is Gary?
he got transferred to Las Cruces.
if you'd like to file an appeal, you can contact
I have done nothing wrong.
tell me, why you shut me down?
what laws did I break?
what laws? Several.
tell me exact specific laws, or I refuse.
specific? - Right now.
the
tell me exact
the specific laws... - What laws?
hold on, okay?
hold on. Hold on.
wait, wait, wait.
okay. Okay.
the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act of 1978,
section 74, Chapter 4,
part 13 states, "Whenever the disposal of solid waste or hazardous waste presents
...an imminent or substantial endangerment, the offender may be fined not more than $5, 000 each day in which the violation occurs.
all right. Okay.
now the...
okay, baby.
all right. The EPA can cite him under the Toxic Substances, Control Act of 1976, U. S. Code Title 15, Chapter 53 , Subchapter 1Section 2606.
satisfied?
was that specific enough for you?
all done with lunch?
hmm.
you hardly touched this.
I'm not hungry.
I'm leaving the rice pudding.
I'm not hungry, Marie.
so don't eat it.
Hey, Marie. How you doing?
I-- I'm okay. Is there a problem?
no, no. Everything's fine.
I'm here for Hank, actually.
Oh. You're so sweet.
Hank will be thrilled.
sweetie, you have a visitor.
Ah, Jesus. What now?
she rob a bank?
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Oh, well, can't complain, you know.
every day a little better.
that's good. You're looking good.
Yeah, well, handsome was never the hard part.
come on in. Grab a seat.
Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.
listen, uh...
thanks again for the other day.
you know, this-- this whole thing, it's, uh, it's been hard on her.
forget it. Glad to help.
so, rock collecting?
they're minerals. Yeah.
uh, it's cataloging them
sort them, label them.
um, it's actually a lot of work.
yeah? No, it looks like it.
so, what's up?
well, actually, I could use your help on something.
homicide, possibly drug-related.
you want my help on the case?
what am I, Ironside?
no. But you're a drug cop who knows the local talent, and you're a pal I just did a favor for, so let me pick your brain a second.
you ever come across a guy by the name of Gale Boetticher?
no.
someone came along and shot him in the face.
okay.
no signs of forced entry, no signs of robbery.
okay, so it's a crime of passion.
Where's the drug angle?
we found a notebook at his place.
I made a copy for you in case you're interested.
looks like it pertains to some kind of methamphetamine superlab.
it's filled with scientific formulas and chemical purchase lists... drawings, pages and pages of this stuff.
it looks big time, but I'm no authority, so I wonder if you might take a look.
come on, Tim, seriously.
what is this, some kind of a charity thing?
I thought your expertise could be useful here.
I'm lying here like, uh, third base, living from bowel movement to bowel movement.
I'm not even useful to myself.
want my advice?
take this to Steve Gomez.
he'll help you out.
I give this to Steve Gomez, and all of a sudden it becomes a DEA case.
what good does that do me?
if you could just take a look, tell me what I got here,
I'd really appreciate it.
whatever.
Thanks, man.
you take it easy.
that's what I do.
well, it was a good try.
here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.
Oh, you're great.
so...
nail Salon sounded promising.
what do you think?
I think we wait.
wait.
Skyler, it has been five hours.
he'll call.
Ahem. Just wait.
just wait.
look.
it was a good idea. It was a great idea.
but it didn't work.
so why don't we simply chalk it up as a learning
white residence.
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.
am I still interested?
well, I-- I think that depends.
Yes, 879 was the original offer, but that seems high to me now.
now I'm offering 800.
no, no, no. No, no. Don't do that.
Why? - Don't do that.
well, because you're an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz.
you were rude to me and disrespectful towards my husband.
Skyler-- - And furthermore,
I've met with quite a number of sellers, and the market seems much softer than I thought.
so 800.
you are talking crazy. 800?
you are a very, very crazy lady.
well, I understand that you're disappointed, but that is my final offer.
I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.
goodbye.
what are you doing?
I'm negotiating.
Why?
because I want to pay less.
$79, 000 less?
who cares? Do you know how much I make in a day?
Yeah, but that's the very reason we need to negotiate.
we don't want to arouse suspicion by not trying to get a good deal.
look, I get the logic. I do.
but you just went too far with it.
you're calling him names?
I didn't call him names.
I said he was unpleasant.
well, he's not calling you back.
I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked.
Yeah, I do.
no way. Sorry. No.
it's time to move on, ok?
I'm going to call Saul.
Where's my phone?
no.
what? - No, just...
what for?
wait, wait.
for
Oh, my God.
hello.
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.
no one's really paying attention to where these things are.
I mean, there's got to be thousands of them all over the world and on boats coming right for us.
and put on inside an ice cream truck, drive it into San Francisco.
I'm not even that scared of burning up in cannibalism.
to me the things that-- thing that worries me is-- is getting trampled or-- or shoved up against a chain link fence because if you really think about it, if you were against a chain link fence and you've got a-- a lot
I mean a lot of people trying to escape, pushing hard enough forward.
it's not a joke. You're going to get squeezed right through the chain links like Pla-Doh or some kind of soft meat.
uh, and this is inevitable, okay?
and there's nothing you or me or anyone can do about it.
and if the fence posts are stuck deep
really deep with the cement way down inside the ground, then it's definitely happening to you.
blood on the wall.
Yeah. Bitch.
somebody got shot. Somebody probably got shot.
like soft meat, man, right through
being squeezed through there like soft meat.
like soft meat, right through the chain.
right through the-- Right through the chain.
it's-- It's inevitable. Just
money!
Ohh, nice.
to...
clean cars and clean money.
hear, hear.
you see?
I told you we'd get it.
did you?
seriously, that was really great work.
it's impressive.
thank you.
and Saul finally came through.
well, I mean, he found the guy, right?
well, yes, he found the guy, but I told him what to do and what to say.
you're right. That's the hard part.
but yes, Saul was, uh... finally useful.
throw him a bone.
Oh, my God.
this is truly amazing.
Yes, well, it better be at $320 a bottle.
what?
Cuvee Pol Roget Sir Winston Churchill.
apparently, it was his favorite champagne, so they just named it after him.
how did you pay for it?
what do you mean?
Ah. No. Cash. I paid cash.
no, I'm-- I'm asking how did you, Walter White, an unemployed schoolteacher, pay for it?
how do you explain it?
Skyler, no one saw me.
whoever sold it to you did, and that's not the point.
the point is we're broke, remember?
I mean, I'm waiting for your unemployment check to come so I can pay the phone bill.
I asked for an extension from the power company.
Why? Because on paper, we have no money.
you are completely overreacting.
I'm not apologizing for wanting to celebrate in some small way.
I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt.
I'm asking you to be smart.
I bought one bottle of champagne, one single bottle, Skyler.
I paid cash. That's it.
that's all it takes, okay?
I mean, look at Watergate.
one... One little piece of duct tape -left in a door -Oh, my G--.
...brought down the President of the United States.
what, I'm Nixon now?
no, what I'm saying is the devil is in the details, okay?
one little mistake, one slip-up in our story, that could ruin us.
fine.
got to destroy the evidence.
when I look at this-- this image that is part of the record,
I am very concerned about what sort of distraction that can be, whether it's from any sort of signage but especially a signage that's changing every five seconds.
thank you.
any other questions?
we have a motion and a second on the floor to grant the appeal.
all those in favor, raise your hand and say yes.
yes is for the affirmative.
those opposed?
there's five no's, and that motion fails.
I would like to make a motion to uphold the decision and the findings of the EBC and the Lupo.
we have a motion and a second by Councilor Cooke. Any questions?
I see none. All those in favor, signify by saying yes to deny the appeal.
all those in favor, signify by saying yes.
that's five in the affirmative.
all those opposed, say no.
there's four in the negative.
that passes.
rinse.
it spilled.
sorry.
draw the curtain.
now get the hurt stick.
sorry to ruin the romance, fellas, but your med transpo was approved, Bagwell.
well, it's about damn time.
let's take a walk, boy.
Bagwell, Theodore, cleared for transport.
keep a candle burning for me, Pretty.
it makes me sick.
what, your breath or your face?
my uncle fought for this country.
the V. A. still ain't got him a decent prosthetic.
and some piece of crap con's getting an upgrade.
well, boo-hoo for your Uncle Stumpy.
but I need a new paw, boss.
check mine out.
it's cracking like the Liberty Bell.
everyone all right?
Oh, n... This one's on me, boy.
let's just say... if your girl sends you a crotch shot on your cell phone, don't try to return the favor while driving, know what I'm saying?
boss is going to have my ass.
easy there, cool breeze.
I got two dead bodies in that truck, and I can easily go for the trifecta.
Hey, I don't want a problem.
problem's all you got right now.
now if you want to cut your losses, you dribble out of them there duds and nude up tout suite.
don't be stupid, stupid. I got a gun.
and you got a son.
it's up to you how this all goes down.
Raymond, I have to take issue with the driving accommodations.
Lead-foot Larry was doing 90 on the FDR. I would rather not die...
a virgin?
...in a fiery crash.
today we're driving fast, we're moving fast.
no grab ass, no messing around. Get up, no sitting.
we have a bona fide professional runner on our hands.
he's already broken out of two prisons.
one in the U. S.and one in Panama.
fresh out of the gate-- less than two hours on his feet.
where the hell's Jules?
Jules? - Right here. sorry.
this one's really heavy.
okay, okay, okay, I have it, I'll do it.
there you go.
Bagwell? Theodore Bagwell.
part of the Fox River Eight that escaped a few years back.
theodore Bagwell? T-Bag?
his prison tag is T-Bag?
no, no, no, no. Don't laugh.
this guy is an incredible melange of sociopathic and psychopathic personality traits.
on a psycho tip, his crimes can be really well planned out. Like the breakouts, for example.
but then he'll turn sociopath and just kill somebody at the drop of a hat, leaving tons evidence behind.
he's incredibly smart and charming and he can appear completely normal, but, of course, he was originally incarcerated for raping and killing a bunch of teenagers.
not necessarily in that order.
how lovely.
I've read everything I can on this guy.
I've always wondered what it would be like to sit down with him face-to-face and analyze him.
well, when we catch him, you can get his autograph.
they found what in the guard's neck?
a piece of T-Bag's prosthetic hand.
he sharpened it into a shank and then sank it into the first guard's neck.
we're chasing a cripple?
okay, he was cuffed to another inmate during the Fox River Eight escape.
then one of his fellow cons took an ax to T-Bag's hand so that they could ditch him
and they leave him there to bleed out. But he survives.
we cannot underestimate this guy.
D. O.C. sent the phone logs from Fox River.
Bagwell wasn't popular. Only two calls recently. But they still have the recordings.
one was to a former inmate named Cabe Green who now lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
it's me.
Hey. Just wondering if you got me my birthday present.
almost.
well, let me know when it's wrapped and ready,'cause I'm excited, son.
gotta run. Ciao, ciao.
second call was a week later to the prison pay phone bank.
Bagwell said hello, other side hung up.
birthday present's a screen.
his birthday was five months before the call was made.
when cons are planning something, they talk in code.
birthday present probably means help breaking out.
the hang-up phone call was a signal.
like, if I make a phone call on this pay phone on this date, the plan's on.
it's bullshit they can record our calls on the inside like that.
you want more prisoner rights, vote Democrat.
Oh, wait, you can't vote, right? So shut up.
yo, this ain't Rocky, Zancanelli.
italians don't beat up black men in the real world, so...
I'll put you to sleep, little man.
yo, I'm right here.
Hey, hey, this isn't the time to prove how hard you are, okay?
right now there are people working, taking their kids to school, who have no idea their paths are going to cross with Bagwell.
no idea they might actually end up dying 'cause we didn't get there fast enough.
and you should know better.
matter of fact, you know what?
you and your best friend go to Fort Wayne and see Cabe.
Erica and Lloyd, we're gong to Illinois.
clear.
I told you, I don't know where he is or where he's going.
we listened to the call.
we know all about the little birthday present you had planned for him.
his birthday was months ago.
I missed Theodore's birthday so I owed him a gift, that's it.
we're friends.
the kind of friend that pushes your head down in the pillow?
I can't help you. And I've done nothing wrong, so go.
you have no right to be here.
he called Bagwell "Theodore. " Boy's still following lockup rules.
punk can't call his daddy by his prison tag.
he's still under Bagwell's control.
whatever he knows, he ain't never gonna give it up.
driver took two bullets. One more went through the windshield.
prison guards traditionally carry Glock 17s with a 12-round clip.
Bagwell's got nine more shots.
Mr. Pace, Deputy Charlie DuChamp. Thank you for coming back out here.
the bastard threatened me and my son. I want him caught.
it's a miracle we're not dead.
it's not a miracle, really.
it's an example of Bagwell's advance cognitive dissonance.
he does these evil things all the time, but he convinces himself that he's not evil with these random acts of kindness, you know?
on his last breakout, he violently kidnaps his ex-girlfriend and her children, and then he just sets them free in an act of mercy, you know.
he knows he's bad, but he thinks can be good.
understand he took your clothes?
some whack job with a fake hand and a bloody gash on his head comes at you with a gun, I give him what he wants.
so he's hurt?
Yeah, yeah, uh, just above his left eyebrow.
Lloyd, have Julianne update the alarm to include Bagwell's injury.
ray, what do you got?
not much.
Cabe's clearly involved with Bagwell, but we can't figure out how he helped him escape.
maybe he didn't help him escape. Maybe he helped him after the escape.
when my dad and I used to chase skips, they'd have their boys drop care packages for them.
bags with cash, food, anything.
Jules, are you conferenced in?
I'm here.
run the toll activity for Cabe Green's Indiana EZ pass-- 0804NJS.
Cabe drove into Illinois a week ago.
the same day that hang-up call was made to Bagwell.
see? Told you.
second call was the signal the package was in place.
what, you want a gold star now?
Where'd that second call come from?
uh, pay phone s in Madison, Illinois, about 20 miles east of Fox River.
that's minutes away.
let's go.
you say "let's go" all the time. I wanted to say it once.
it felt-- it felt good to say.
just get in the car, Lloyd.
nobody matching T-Bag's description ever checked in over there.
well, then if he called from here, odds are the present's here.
he'd want his stash easy to access.
Yeah, but not visible enough for him to be seen getting into it.
exactly, but secluded enough that somebody wouldn't just stumble across it.
uh... mailbox?
too much foot traffic.
under the motel sign?
it's too close to the road. Let's fan out.
Charlie, come look at this.
that's probably just trash.
a freshly-dug hole with a box that was clearly just inside of it?
I thought you were some sort of child prodigy.
okay, so there's cologne, nail clippers.
how much you wanna bet if we run this, we'll get DNA that matches Bagwell's?
cardboard and some pins? It's probably a new shirt.
container's cracked.
water and mealworms ruined this money, but guess what
these are Canadian dollars.
Julianne, get an alarm to all Canadian border crossings.
tell 'em, Bagwell's cleaned himself up; he's dressed nice, but he's low on funds and he's still injured.
all right, so Bagwell's two pressing wants right now are transportation and first aid.
and without those, he can't get very far.
two birds...
meet one stone.
hit on him in Illinois.
you think he could've gotten past the roadblocks?
at this point, let's assume he did.
now we know he's heading east because he hid his stash east of the prison.
could be going to Toledo, right near Lake Erie.
a short boat ride from a smuggler, and he's in Canada.
then that's where the girl must be,'cause Captain Hook didn't just change clothes, he gussied up. Trimmed his nails, splashed on some stinkwater.
top two reasons a man breaks outta prison: women and women.
T-Bag's lookin' to live up to his nickname, if you know what I'm saying.
gross.
I don't get it. - Seriously
t-bag is an abbreviation for "Theodore Bagwell."
damn, man, come here.
Lloyd said that last time he escaped, he went after an ex-girlfriend.
a Mrs. Hollander. She's already under protective custody.
what are you talking about? The whole thing?
sorry.
it's off-putting to envision that happening.
it doesn't mean he couldn't have a new sweetheart.
he's a slick son of a bitch.
too hot.
too cold.
okay, innovation, that's what this nation is about.
that not only enhances the quality of our lives, but also simplifies it.
the lightbulb, the refrigerator, and now the Roll Away Bed.
I'll take 12!
I'm sorry.
Oh, you scared me.
I just, I... I couldn't help but overhear your speech, and I think it's fantastic.
Really? I-I'm so nervous.
I have to talk at a seminar tomorrow, and I'm not good at it.
you're right about that.
you're great at it.
tell me more about the Roll Away Bed.
now, come on. Don't be shy now.
well, with just four decorative blocks to lift your existing bed and one mattress on wheels, you can double your room occupancy just like that.

Oh, let me help you. - No, no, no, no, no, I got this, Ms. Plum.
as you can tell from my melon, I may be accident-prone, but I'm not helpless.
let me just right the ship here.
if I, uh, if I let my old war wound stand in my way, well,
I'd only have one Zippy Burger, now wouldn't I?
well, you are something else.
you have no idea.
an Illinois ambulance was found ditched on the side of the road in Brushy Prairie, Indiana.
both EMTs were dead, one had his hand cut off.
gotta be our guy. He knew an ambulance with the cherries spinnin' would fly right through a roadblock.
he cut off somebody else's hand? Are you kidding me?
the man is engaged in Grand Attribute Projection, you guys.
do you know how rare that is?
he is subconsciously trying to put the things he hates most about himself onto other people.
no, he's looking to leave the country.
Jules, call Special Operations.
get another plane on it.
Oh, and another great thing about the Roll Away Bed-- it's hypo-allergenic.
thank you so much for taking me back to my hotel, Brett.
my pleasure, Candy Cane.
I may've had too much to drink, but it'll be dawn soon, and... if you want, you can come back to my room.
you can try out a Roll Away Bed.
Oh, Candace, I do appreciate the offer, but there's only one woman I'm interested in seeing right now.
what are you doing?
roll away, dear Candace.
roll away.
narcotics are missing.
why did he even dump the van?
it's not like you can even see the bodies stacked up in the back from outside.
no gas. Meat wagons have their own fueling facility.
an out-of-state ambulance at a gas station would draw too much attention.
he's a smart little bastard.
those the personal effects?
Yeah. Cash is gone.
I mean, what could he have gotten these guys for, a hundred bucks?
can't get far on that.
Hey, yo, one of these bags gonna have a cell phone.
no one spends all day in a car without a phone.
even crackheads got cell phones. I'd check into that.
Jules, run the phone records of any cell registered to an Arthur Bradshaw.
he's one of our dead EMTs.
local police say each EMT was shot once in the head.
body count four, seven rounds left.
he might do lot more damage.
he definitely could do a lot more damage.
a call was placed with the deceased EMT's phone after their bodies were found.
I texted Charlie the number Bagwell called.
got it.
Hi. You've reached Lorraine.
leave a message and I'll call you when I can. Later.
guarantee you that's the woman he got all dressed up for.
we just gotta follow the tail trail, and that'll take us right to T-Bag.
might be the woman on the machine, or there could be another woman Bagwell was meeting.
who?
the one he pushed out of a moving car.
hit just came in. She was found on the side of a state route.
amazingly, the survivor was able to I. D.him.
she's at a hospital not far away.
okay. Ray, you and Lloyd go to the hospital.
the rest of us, we'll go check out Lorraine from the answering machine.
did you notify the next of kin? - not yet.
well, do it,'cause there's family waiting for somebody that's not coming home tonight.
yeah?
Hi, I'm Henry Pope.
I'd like to talk to you about the exciting world of franchising.
what's your name, friend? - Wayne Garrett.
listen, we just got home and we're tired, so...
who's at the door, baby?
it's nobody, Lorraine. I'll be there right there.
actually, Wayne, payback's at the door.
he said there was a woman he wanted to see, then he pushed me out.
did he say anything else?
no. He took something.
a ring.
he needs money to get outta the country.
convention center was just a few miles away from where he ran outta gas.
in a suit, he could blend in; he saw an opportunity.
it's just bad luck, Ms. Plum.
he might try to pawn the ring.
I don't care. It's costume. Worth nothing.
doctors say he drugged me.
you're lucky he did; it made you limber and able to withstand the impact.
that and the fact that he pushed you down a snowy embankment.
he was so nice to me.
I really thought he liked me.
this guy has killed four people since he's escaped-- that we know about.
I know it sounds sick, but you're probably still alive today 'cause he did like you.
open up. U. S.Marshals!
Damn!
homeboy looks like a Swiss Army knife.
duchamp. - It's me.
Bagwell confirmed to Candace Plum that he's going after a woman.
I know.
think he already found her.
all right, we're on our way.
look at the pain he was put through; the torture, the degradation.
Bagwell had his fun before he shot this guy.
Yeah, he also pee'd on him.
nasty.
he was mad that this guy stole his sweet Lorraine.
he wanted him to suffer. This was a very, very personal killing.
two more rounds. He still has five left.
and look what he can do with knives.
she still has her jewelry on.
he took a ring from a woman he turned into a tumbleweed.
why steal jewelry from one person but not the other?
he wrote something down.
you been watching too many Law & Order eps, Raymond.
hold on a second.
he left this pen on top of this notebook.
maybe he leaned on it when he wrote.
there's indentations. Can you give me that cleaner?
see, that's some Charlie Chan shit right there, Ray Ray.
Jules, get on NCIC and run the nickname Tenpence Bryan, see if you come up with anything.
if it's important enough for him to write it down, then maybe that's where Bagwell's headed next.
raging Bull?
see? It's these boxing movies that make white folk think boxing is still their sport.
anybody since polio was cured?
got a hit. - On the nickname?
no, on Bagwell.
guy fitting his description was seen racing through Bryan, Ohio, only two towns over from where you are now, in a green Skylark.
I checked DMV records; Lorraine Rome, your female DOA, owns a green Skylark.
hold on a second. Did you just say Bryan, Ohio?
okay, check all the streets named "Pence" and "Bryan" "Pence Road,"
pence Boulevard Pence Avenue?
and I know what your next question is.
there is a Ten Pence Avenue rented by a Rodney Johnson.
okay, call the local PD and wait for them here.
ray, we gotta follow up on this.
Damn!
nice to meet you, Rodney Johnson.
time to feel as much pain as you've caused.
missed him. Damn it!
blood on the wall.
done the math.
we got one guy with one hand who's killed six people in less than one day.
we've never dealt with somebody like this before.
who tears the corner off a calendar before the month's over?
there's the part with the address on it.
this is where he's heading.
my foot's stuck! I can't move!
get a move on, boy! Pick up those feet!
please, man, I don't even know what I did to you! Please!
it's not what you did to me, Rodney.
Bagwell, freeze!
help me, please!
get him outta there! I'm going after Bagwell!
help me, please!
it's busted!
I can't hold on! I can't hold on!
hold on!
we've been keeping track of your ammo, Bagwell!
you got one shot left in the clip!
help me, please. - Grab my hand.
Charlie, get down here, or this guy's gonna die.
Charlie, if you don't get over here right now,
I can't hold on! Please!
Oh, God!
help! Help!
No! No!
Yeah, I hired Rodney about a month ago.
doesn't talk much, decent worker.
that's why I don't hire family men.
survivor claims would put my premiums through the roof.
how sensitive.
did Johnson ever mention the name Theodore Bagwell?
Ah, doesn't ring a bell, but, uh, like I said, Rodney was only here for a month.
check with his last employer. He was there a couple of years.
who was that?
uh... Willis County Nursing Home.
the one thing I do remember him talking about was how much he hated that place.
look, uh, I gotta go help the accident investigator now.
Hey, Jules.
Rodney Johnson worked at Willis County Nursing home.
so did Wayne Garrett. I saw an I. D.badge at his apartment.
into it.
now, Bagwell wasn't after any girl.
he was after these two guys for some reason.
run Willis County Nursing Home.
okay, uh... nothing unusual about the nursing home.
no citations, nothing remarkable about the employee or patient lists.
what do you think about that?
I think Charlie and I have to go check out this nursing home. Thanks.
why couldn't I wait back in the lobby with Shea and Erica?
because you're a doctor, and you speak hospital talk.
this is not a hospital, okay?
this is a pickup bar for the Grim Reaper, and everybody's putting out, all right?
you guys, I'm totally putting my mom into one of these places.
you must be the marshals. I got your message.
I'm Susan Dannon, the home's director.
deputy DuChamp, this is Deputy Zancanelli.
I still can't believe the news about Wayne and Rod.
any information on them-- even if you think is minor-- could be important.
didn't really know them that well.
they were fine workers, but they quit.
job just wasn't the right fit.
that's a lie. - Excuse me?
the workup we did on both these guys shows a failure to graduate high school, with very limited work experience, so scrubbing bedpans and changing sheets is about the best they could hope for.
there's no way they quit because it didn't fit.
I won't stand here and be called a liar.
okay, liar, but you just backed up a bit when you said that.
that's a physical avoidance marker.
it's a sign of someone who's not telling the truth.
look, lady, I just saw a guy get turned into chowder today.
so get straight with us, or I'll have to cuff you and drag you out of this raisin ranch.
Oh, this is a small town, and people need this hospital, and we can't afford any fines.
you're trying my patience.
nothing was ever proven. They were accusations.
it's irresponsible for me to talk about it if...
ray. Bracelets.
hands behind your back.
Hey! Okay. Please. Please.
Wayne and Rod were suspected of... inappropriate...
physical contact with a mentally-challenged, geriatric patient.
maybe even stole some of her jewelry.
it was a horrible set of circumstances.
She-she had dementia and cancer. Was in and out of consciousness.
She-she couldn't even defend herself.
how did you find out about this?
luckily, she was lucid enough to tell a supervisor.
Wayne and Rod were fired immediately, and charges would have been filed if the patient hadn't slipped into a comatose state.
without her testimony, the case was closed.
and what happened to the lady?
she had been shipped up here from Alabama when her last known viable relatives died.
I went out of my own pocket, transferred Mrs. Bagwell to St. Victoria's, a small state hospital in New Jersey.
I did not want that woman to spend the last of her remaining days inside the facility that failed to protect her.
did you just say Mrs. Bagwell? - Yes. Why?
thank you very much.
those guys were Granny Grabbers?
if I knew, I would never have tried to get him out of the rock crusher.
Hey, somebody messes with your family, you do what you got to do to make it right.
does that include all the innocent people that T-Bag hurt to get to Garrett and Johnson?
okay, here's the thing.
the woman we just talked to said that Mrs. Bagwell might have had some jewelry stolen from her, in addition to the other indignations that she suffered.
now, uh, the reason Bagwell didn't take any jewelry from Lorraine, after he killed her, was that he already had the replacement ring
it was the costume jewelry that he took from Candace before he pushed her out of the car.
you see, this is why Bagwell is so fascinating.
he pushes a woman out of a moving car, but not before he gets a ring for his mother, which he clearly intends to give to her in person, before she dies, which is going to be very soon.
him going to see her is a big risk.
but he is going, okay? Why else would he get all cleaned up?
he wants to look respectable the last time he sees the woman who brought him into this world.
I tell you, T-Bag is going to see his mama.
ay, you guys, go around back. Ray and I will head down this way.
remember, be careful. He still has one round left.
excuse me, darlin'.
I'm here to see Audrey Bagwell.
I'm sorry, sir. Visiting hours are over. All the patients are asleep.
I'll be quiet as a church mouse.
I'm sorry, sir. You're going to have to come back tomorrow.
sweetheart, there ain't no tomorrow. Not for me.
or you. Now, you listen to me, Nightingale.
you find my mama's room number or you're gonna wind up in a bed right next to her, understand?
point and click. Point and click.
hurry the hell up.
right here. 209.
Hey! Stop right there!
ray, he's going out the south stairwell.
u. S.Marshals. Listen. Put the hospital on lockdown.
cut off all exits and elevators. Do it.
one round left.
he's on the other side of the hospital!
east wing. He's running down the East Wing.
mama!
mama! Mama! Mama!
let me look at her. Let me look at her! Let me look at her!
you have no idea what they did to her.
let me look at her! Let me see her!
get his arm. Get his arm. I got his other arm.
you want to calm down?
you want to calm down?
we got you. Cuff him. We're good.
you got him? Yeah.
she hears my voice.
mama... Come on. Let's go.
she didn't do anything wrong.
she's the victim.
you're nothin' but a disease.
and if it was up to me, I'd stick that stump up yo ass.
but your mother didn't do nothing wrong. Come on.
in my pocket. Please.
make it quick.
I got 'em, Mama.
I got 'em.
now... I won't be seeing you in Heaven...
...but you enjoy it for the both of us, okay?
all right.
you like Floyd Patterson?
man could box. - How 'bout Tyson?
man could hit.
both trained by Gus D'Amato. Suck it.
those who can't do, teach.
you might want to get your zoot suit on. Van to Maybelle'll be here soon.
Yeah, before I catch that ride, I,uh, I almost took a 22-caliber tattoo right here today.
okay? I'm doing this to get to my daughter faster, not the cemetery.
so if the cases keep being like this, this "one month off" thing needs to get jacked up.
this whole "one month off" thing is all you're ever gonna get.
there's no renegotiations. This week it was a killer.
next week, it'll be a rapist. The week after that, who knows.
at least the coffee's free.
transpo will be here for him in 30 minutes.
Lowery better do something or he's gonna miss his chance.
are you a doctor?
cause you've got the arrogance of a white coat.
I'm an MD.
and a PhD.
you got more letters than the alphabet. Good for you.
you here to analyze me, Doc?
fix me up before I go back to the animal factory?
ask me some probing questions? Find out how I go tick-tock?
you want to know if I kill with ease because my daddy raped his retarded sister and I got spit out, slightly more useful than the afterbirth?
or maybe it's 'cause I didn't make captain of the gridiron gang.
never had a Cherry Valance of my own.
or maybe 'cause of the bookworm queens, who later grow up to be PhMD's, stared down their noses at me so much I thought the sun was a big, old snotball.
or maybe it's 'cause when I watch a man die at my hand,
I finally feel Theodore Bagwell matters more than all those gnat's asses in the world.
because I know, dear, kind doctor, that in that moment, nothing matters more in that soon-to-be-dead man's eyes than I!
because I...
I am his gatekeeper to life or death.
well?
is it that menagerie of misery that makes me so special a case study, Doc?
is it?
you know it's not, Theodore.
when we started this case...
...I thought I was going to get some great insight into why you are the way you are
a look into a complex psyche, a glimpse into the neurological map of a madman that could show some light on some bigger truths, that could maybe help other sick people one day.
as I got up-close and personal with you, and your handiwork, I found a truth.
it was a small one, though.
as unexciting as it may sound, some machines just come out of the factory broken.
you're a broken machine.
rinse.
it spilled.
sorry.
draw the curtain.
now get the hurt stick.
sorry to ruin the romance, fellas, but your med transpo was approved, Bagwell.
well, it's about damn time.
let's take a walk, boy.
Bagwell, Theodore, cleared for transport.
keep a candle burning for me, Pretty.
it makes me sick.
what, your breath or your face?
my uncle fought for this country.
the V. A. still ain't got him a decent prosthetic.
and some piece of crap con's getting an upgrade.
well, boo-hoo for your Uncle Stumpy.
but I need a new paw, boss.
check mine out.
it's cracking like the Liberty Bell.
everyone all right?
Oh, n... This one's on me, boy.
let's just say... if your girl sends you a crotch shot on your cell phone, don't try to return the favor while driving, know what I'm saying?
boss is going to have my ass.
easy there, cool breeze.
I got two dead bodies in that truck, and I can easily go for the trifecta.
Hey, I don't want a problem.
problem's all you got right now.
now if you want to cut your losses, you dribble out of them there duds and nude up tout suite.
don't be stupid, stupid. I got a gun.
and you got a son.
it's up to you how this all goes down.
Raymond, I have to take issue with the driving accommodations.
Lead-foot Larry was doing 90 on the FDR. I would rather not die...
a virgin?
...in a fiery crash.
today we're driving fast, we're moving fast.
no grab ass, no messing around. Get up, no sitting.
we have a bona fide professional runner on our hands.
he's already broken out of two prisons.
one in the U. S.and one in Panama.
fresh out of the gate-- less than two hours on his feet.
where the hell's Jules?
Jules? - Right here. sorry.
this one's really heavy.
okay, okay, okay, I have it, I'll do it.
there you go.
Bagwell? Theodore Bagwell.
part of the Fox River Eight that escaped a few years back.
theodore Bagwell? T-Bag?
his prison tag is T-Bag?
no, no, no, no. Don't laugh.
this guy is an incredible melange of sociopathic and psychopathic personality traits.
on a psycho tip, his crimes can be really well planned out. Like the breakouts, for example.
but then he'll turn sociopath and just kill somebody at the drop of a hat, leaving tons evidence behind.
he's incredibly smart and charming and he can appear completely normal, but, of course, he was originally incarcerated for raping and killing a bunch of teenagers.
not necessarily in that order.
how lovely.
I've read everything I can on this guy.
I've always wondered what it would be like to sit down with him face-to-face and analyze him.
well, when we catch him, you can get his autograph.
they found what in the guard's neck?
a piece of T-Bag's prosthetic hand.
he sharpened it into a shank and then sank it into the first guard's neck.
we're chasing a cripple?
okay, he was cuffed to another inmate during the Fox River Eight escape.
then one of his fellow cons took an ax to T-Bag's hand so that they could ditch him
and they leave him there to bleed out. But he survives.
we cannot underestimate this guy.
D. O.C. sent the phone logs from Fox River.
Bagwell wasn't popular. Only two calls recently. But they still have the recordings.
one was to a former inmate named Cabe Green who now lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
it's me.
Hey. Just wondering if you got me my birthday present.
almost.
well, let me know when it's wrapped and ready,'cause I'm excited, son.
gotta run. Ciao, ciao.
second call was a week later to the prison pay phone bank.
Bagwell said hello, other side hung up.
birthday present's a screen.
his birthday was five months before the call was made.
when cons are planning something, they talk in code.
birthday present probably means help breaking out.
the hang-up phone call was a signal.
like, if I make a phone call on this pay phone on this date, the plan's on.
it's bullshit they can record our calls on the inside like that.
you want more prisoner rights, vote Democrat.
Oh, wait, you can't vote, right? So shut up.
yo, this ain't Rocky, Zancanelli.
italians don't beat up black men in the real world, so...
I'll put you to sleep, little man.
yo, I'm right here.
Hey, hey, this isn't the time to prove how hard you are, okay?
right now there are people working, taking their kids to school, who have no idea their paths are going to cross with Bagwell.
no idea they might actually end up dying 'cause we didn't get there fast enough.
and you should know better.
matter of fact, you know what?
you and your best friend go to Fort Wayne and see Cabe.
Erica and Lloyd, we're gong to Illinois.
clear.
I told you, I don't know where he is or where he's going.
we listened to the call.
we know all about the little birthday present you had planned for him.
his birthday was months ago.
I missed Theodore's birthday so I owed him a gift, that's it.
we're friends.
the kind of friend that pushes your head down in the pillow?
I can't help you. And I've done nothing wrong, so go.
you have no right to be here.
he called Bagwell "Theodore. " Boy's still following lockup rules.
punk can't call his daddy by his prison tag.
he's still under Bagwell's control.
whatever he knows, he ain't never gonna give it up.
driver took two bullets. One more went through the windshield.
prison guards traditionally carry Glock 17s with a 12-round clip.
Bagwell's got nine more shots.
Mr. Pace, Deputy Charlie DuChamp. Thank you for coming back out here.
the bastard threatened me and my son. I want him caught.
it's a miracle we're not dead.
it's not a miracle, really.
it's an example of Bagwell's advance cognitive dissonance.
he does these evil things all the time, but he convinces himself that he's not evil with these random acts of kindness, you know?
on his last breakout, he violently kidnaps his ex-girlfriend and her children, and then he just sets them free in an act of mercy, you know.
he knows he's bad, but he thinks can be good.
understand he took your clothes?
some whack job with a fake hand and a bloody gash on his head comes at you with a gun, I give him what he wants.
so he's hurt?
Yeah, yeah, uh, just above his left eyebrow.
Lloyd, have Julianne update the alarm to include Bagwell's injury.
ray, what do you got?
not much.
Cabe's clearly involved with Bagwell, but we can't figure out how he helped him escape.
maybe he didn't help him escape. Maybe he helped him after the escape.
when my dad and I used to chase skips, they'd have their boys drop care packages for them.
bags with cash, food, anything.
Jules, are you conferenced in?
I'm here.
run the toll activity for Cabe Green's Indiana EZ pass-- 0804NJS.
Cabe drove into Illinois a week ago.
the same day that hang-up call was made to Bagwell.
see? Told you.
second call was the signal the package was in place.
what, you want a gold star now?
Where'd that second call come from?
uh, pay phone s in Madison, Illinois, about 20 miles east of Fox River.
that's minutes away.
let's go.
you say "let's go" all the time. I wanted to say it once.
it felt-- it felt good to say.
just get in the car, Lloyd.
nobody matching T-Bag's description ever checked in over there.
well, then if he called from here, odds are the present's here.
he'd want his stash easy to access.
Yeah, but not visible enough for him to be seen getting into it.
exactly, but secluded enough that somebody wouldn't just stumble across it.
uh... mailbox?
too much foot traffic.
under the motel sign?
it's too close to the road. Let's fan out.
Charlie, come look at this.
that's probably just trash.
a freshly-dug hole with a box that was clearly just inside of it?
I thought you were some sort of child prodigy.
okay, so there's cologne, nail clippers.
how much you wanna bet if we run this, we'll get DNA that matches Bagwell's?
cardboard and some pins? It's probably a new shirt.
container's cracked.
water and mealworms ruined this money, but guess what
these are Canadian dollars.
Julianne, get an alarm to all Canadian border crossings.
tell 'em, Bagwell's cleaned himself up; he's dressed nice, but he's low on funds and he's still injured.
all right, so Bagwell's two pressing wants right now are transportation and first aid.
and without those, he can't get very far.
two birds...
meet one stone.
hit on him in Illinois.
you think he could've gotten past the roadblocks?
at this point, let's assume he did.
now we know he's heading east because he hid his stash east of the prison.
could be going to Toledo, right near Lake Erie.
a short boat ride from a smuggler, and he's in Canada.
then that's where the girl must be,'cause Captain Hook didn't just change clothes, he gussied up. Trimmed his nails, splashed on some stinkwater.
top two reasons a man breaks outta prison: women and women.
T-Bag's lookin' to live up to his nickname, if you know what I'm saying.
gross.
I don't get it. - Seriously
t-bag is an abbreviation for "Theodore Bagwell."
damn, man, come here.
Lloyd said that last time he escaped, he went after an ex-girlfriend.
a Mrs. Hollander. She's already under protective custody.
what are you talking about? The whole thing?
sorry.
it's off-putting to envision that happening.
it doesn't mean he couldn't have a new sweetheart.
he's a slick son of a bitch.
too hot.
too cold.
okay, innovation, that's what this nation is about.
that not only enhances the quality of our lives, but also simplifies it.
the lightbulb, the refrigerator, and now the Roll Away Bed.
I'll take 12!
I'm sorry.
Oh, you scared me.
I just, I... I couldn't help but overhear your speech, and I think it's fantastic.
Really? I-I'm so nervous.
I have to talk at a seminar tomorrow, and I'm not good at it.
you're right about that.
you're great at it.
tell me more about the Roll Away Bed.
now, come on. Don't be shy now.
well, with just four decorative blocks to lift your existing bed and one mattress on wheels, you can double your room occupancy just like that.
now that's a woman who believes in her product. Brett Benson.
proud owner of two Zippy Burger franchises.
Candace Plum. - As in "sweet as a"?
let's drink to entrepreneurial spirit.
Oh, let me help you. - No, no, no, no, no, I got this, Ms. Plum.
as you can tell from my melon, I may be accident-prone, but I'm not helpless.
let me just right the ship here.
if I, uh, if I let my old war wound stand in my way, well,
I'd only have one Zippy Burger, now wouldn't I?
well, you are something else.
you have no idea.
an Illinois ambulance was found ditched on the side of the road in Brushy Prairie, Indiana.
both EMTs were dead, one had his hand cut off.
gotta be our guy. He knew an ambulance with the cherries spinnin' would fly right through a roadblock.
he cut off somebody else's hand? Are you kidding me?
the man is engaged in Grand Attribute Projection, you guys.
do you know how rare that is?
he is subconsciously trying to put the things he hates most about himself onto other people.
no, he's looking to leave the country.
Jules, call Special Operations.
get another plane on it.
Oh, and another great thing about the Roll Away Bed-- it's hypo-allergenic.
thank you so much for taking me back to my hotel, Brett.
my pleasure, Candy Cane.
I may've had too much to drink, but it'll be dawn soon, and... if you want, you can come back to my room.
you can try out a Roll Away Bed.
Oh, Candace, I do appreciate the offer, but there's only one woman I'm interested in seeing right now.
what are you doing?
roll away, dear Candace.
roll away.
narcotics are missing.
why did he even dump the van?
it's not like you can even see the bodies stacked up in the back from outside.
no gas. Meat wagons have their own fueling facility.
an out-of-state ambulance at a gas station would draw too much attention.
he's a smart little bastard.
those the personal effects?
Yeah. Cash is gone.
I mean, what could he have gotten these guys for, a hundred bucks?
can't get far on that.
Hey, yo, one of these bags gonna have a cell phone.
no one spends all day in a car without a phone.
even crackheads got cell phones. I'd check into that.
Jules, run the phone records of any cell registered to an Arthur Bradshaw.
he's one of our dead EMTs.
local police say each EMT was shot once in the head.
body count four, seven rounds left.
he might do lot more damage.
he definitely could do a lot more damage.
a call was placed with the deceased EMT's phone after their bodies were found.
I texted Charlie the number Bagwell called.
got it.
Hi. You've reached Lorraine.
leave a message and I'll call you when I can. Later.
guarantee you that's the woman he got all dressed up for.
we just gotta follow the tail trail, and that'll take us right to T-Bag.
might be the woman on the machine, or there could be another woman Bagwell was meeting.
who?
the one he pushed out of a moving car.
hit just came in. She was found on the side of a state route.
amazingly, the survivor was able to I. D.him.
she's at a hospital not far away.
okay. Ray, you and Lloyd go to the hospital.
the rest of us, we'll go check out Lorraine from the answering machine.
did you notify the next of kin? - not yet.
well, do it,'cause there's family waiting for somebody that's not coming home tonight.
yeah?
Hi, I'm Henry Pope.
I'd like to talk to you about the exciting world of franchising.
what's your name, friend? - Wayne Garrett.
listen, we just got home and we're tired, so...
who's at the door, baby?
it's nobody, Lorraine. I'll be there right there.
actually, Wayne, payback's at the door.
he said there was a woman he wanted to see, then he pushed me out.
did he say anything else?
no. He took something.
a ring.
he needs money to get outta the country.
convention center was just a few miles away from where he ran outta gas.
in a suit, he could blend in; he saw an opportunity.
it's just bad luck, Ms. Plum.
he might try to pawn the ring.
I don't care. It's costume. Worth nothing.
doctors say he drugged me.
you're lucky he did; it made you limber and able to withstand the impact.
that and the fact that he pushed you down a snowy embankment.
he was so nice to me.
I really thought he liked me.
this guy has killed four people since he's escaped-- that we know about.
I know it sounds sick, but you're probably still alive today 'cause he did like you.
open up. U. S.Marshals!
Damn!
homeboy looks like a Swiss Army knife.
duchamp. - It's me.
Bagwell confirmed to Candace Plum that he's going after a woman.
I know.
think he already found her.
all right, we're on our way.
look at the pain he was put through; the torture, the degradation.
Bagwell had his fun before he shot this guy.
Yeah, he also pee'd on him.
nasty.
he was mad that this guy stole his sweet Lorraine.
he wanted him to suffer. This was a very, very personal killing.
two more rounds. He still has five left.
and look what he can do with knives.
she still has her jewelry on.
he took a ring from a woman he turned into a tumbleweed.
why steal jewelry from one person but not the other?
he wrote something down.
you been watching too many Law & Order eps, Raymond.
hold on a second.
he left this pen on top of this notebook.
maybe he leaned on it when he wrote.
there's indentations. Can you give me that cleaner?
see, that's some Charlie Chan shit right there, Ray Ray.
Jules, get on NCIC and run the nickname Tenpence Bryan, see if you come up with anything.
if it's important enough for him to write it down, then maybe that's where Bagwell's headed next.
raging Bull?
see? It's these boxing movies that make white folk think boxing is still their sport.
anybody since polio was cured?
got a hit. - On the nickname?
no, on Bagwell.
guy fitting his description was seen racing through Bryan, Ohio, only two towns over from where you are now, in a green Skylark.
I checked DMV records; Lorraine Rome, your female DOA, owns a green Skylark.
hold on a second. Did you just say Bryan, Ohio?
okay, check all the streets named "Pence" and "Bryan" "Pence Road,"
pence Boulevard Pence Avenue?
and I know what your next question is.
there is a Ten Pence Avenue rented by a Rodney Johnson.
okay, call the local PD and wait for them here.
ray, we gotta follow up on this.
Damn!
nice to meet you, Rodney Johnson.
time to feel as much pain as you've caused.
missed him. Damn it!
blood on the wall.
done the math.
we got one guy with one hand who's killed six people in less than one day.
we've never dealt with somebody like this before.
who tears the corner off a calendar before the month's over?
there's the part with the address on it.
this is where he's heading.
my foot's stuck! I can't move!
get a move on, boy! Pick up those feet!
please, man, I don't even know what I did to you! Please!
it's not what you did to me, Rodney.
Bagwell, freeze!
help me, please!
get him outta there! I'm going after Bagwell!
help me, please!
it's busted!
I can't hold on! I can't hold on!
hold on!
we've been keeping track of your ammo, Bagwell!
you got one shot left in the clip!
help me, please. - Grab my hand.
Charlie, get down here, or this guy's gonna die.
Charlie, if you don't get over here right now,
I can't hold on! Please!
Oh, God!
help! Help!
No! No!
Yeah, I hired Rodney about a month ago.
doesn't talk much, decent worker.
that's why I don't hire family men.
survivor claims would put my premiums through the roof.
how sensitive.
did Johnson ever mention the name Theodore Bagwell?
Ah, doesn't ring a bell, but, uh, like I said, Rodney was only here for a month.
check with his last employer. He was there a couple of years.
who was that?
uh... Willis County Nursing Home.
the one thing I do remember him talking about was how much he hated that place.
look, uh, I gotta go help the accident investigator now.
Hey, Jules.
Rodney Johnson worked at Willis County Nursing home.
so did Wayne Garrett. I saw an I. D.badge at his apartment.
into it.
now, Bagwell wasn't after any girl.
he was after these two guys for some reason.
run Willis County Nursing Home.
okay, uh... nothing unusual about the nursing home.
no citations, nothing remarkable about the employee or patient lists.
what do you think about that?
I think Charlie and I have to go check out this nursing home. Thanks.
why couldn't I wait back in the lobby with Shea and Erica?
because you're a doctor, and you speak hospital talk.
this is not a hospital, okay?
this is a pickup bar for the Grim Reaper, and everybody's putting out, all right?
you guys, I'm totally putting my mom into one of these places.
you must be the marshals. I got your message.
I'm Susan Dannon, the home's director.
deputy DuChamp, this is Deputy Zancanelli.
I still can't believe the news about Wayne and Rod.
any information on them-- even if you think is minor-- could be important.
didn't really know them that well.
they were fine workers, but they quit.
job just wasn't the right fit.
that's a lie. - Excuse me?
the workup we did on both these guys shows a failure to graduate high school, with very limited work experience, so scrubbing bedpans and changing sheets is about the best they could hope for.
there's no way they quit because it didn't fit.
I won't stand here and be called a liar.
okay, liar, but you just backed up a bit when you said that.
that's a physical avoidance marker.
it's a sign of someone who's not telling the truth.
look, lady, I just saw a guy get turned into chowder today.
so get straight with us, or I'll have to cuff you and drag you out of this raisin ranch.
Oh, this is a small town, and people need this hospital, and we can't afford any fines.
you're trying my patience.
nothing was ever proven. They were accusations.
it's irresponsible for me to talk about it if...
ray. Bracelets.
hands behind your back.
Hey! Okay. Please. Please.
Wayne and Rod were suspected of... inappropriate...
physical contact with a mentally-challenged, geriatric patient.
maybe even stole some of her jewelry.
it was a horrible set of circumstances.
She-she had dementia and cancer. Was in and out of consciousness.
She-she couldn't even defend herself.
how did you find out about this?
luckily, she was lucid enough to tell a supervisor.
Wayne and Rod were fired immediately, and charges would have been filed if the patient hadn't slipped into a comatose state.
without her testimony, the case was closed.
and what happened to the lady?
she had been shipped up here from Alabama when her last known viable relatives died.
I went out of my own pocket, transferred Mrs. Bagwell to St. Victoria's, a small state hospital in New Jersey.
I did not want that woman to spend the last of her remaining days inside the facility that failed to protect her.
did you just say Mrs. Bagwell? - Yes. Why?
thank you very much.
those guys were Granny Grabbers?
if I knew, I would never have tried to get him out of the rock crusher.
Hey, somebody messes with your family, you do what you got to do to make it right.
does that include all the innocent people that T-Bag hurt to get to Garrett and Johnson?
okay, here's the thing.
the woman we just talked to said that Mrs. Bagwell might have had some jewelry stolen from her, in addition to the other indignations that she suffered.
now, uh, the reason Bagwell didn't take any jewelry from Lorraine, after he killed her, was that he already had the replacement ring
it was the costume jewelry that he took from Candace before he pushed her out of the car.
you see, this is why Bagwell is so fascinating.
he pushes a woman out of a moving car, but not before he gets a ring for his mother, which he clearly intends to give to her in person, before she dies, which is going to be very soon.
him going to see her is a big risk.
but he is going, okay? Why else would he get all cleaned up?
he wants to look respectable the last time he sees the woman who brought him into this world.
I tell you, T-Bag is going to see his mama.
ay, you guys, go around back. Ray and I will head down this way.
remember, be careful. He still has one round left.
excuse me, darlin'.
I'm here to see Audrey Bagwell.
I'm sorry, sir. Visiting hours are over. All the patients are asleep.
I'll be quiet as a church mouse.
I'm sorry, sir. You're going to have to come back tomorrow.
sweetheart, there ain't no tomorrow. Not for me.
or you. Now, you listen to me, Nightingale.
you find my mama's room number or you're gonna wind up in a bed right next to her, understand?
point and click. Point and click.
hurry the hell up.
right here. 209.
Hey! Stop right there!
ray, he's going out the south stairwell.
u. S.Marshals. Listen. Put the hospital on lockdown.
cut off all exits and elevators. Do it.
one round left.
he's on the other side of the hospital!
east wing. He's running down the East Wing.
mama!
mama! Mama! Mama!
let me look at her. Let me look at her! Let me look at her!
you have no idea what they did to her.
let me look at her! Let me see her!
get his arm. Get his arm. I got his other arm.
you want to calm down?
you want to calm down?
we got you. Cuff him. We're good.
you got him? Yeah.
she hears my voice.
mama... Come on. Let's go.
she didn't do anything wrong.
she's the victim.
you're nothin' but a disease.
and if it was up to me, I'd stick that stump up yo ass.
but your mother didn't do nothing wrong. Come on.
in my pocket. Please.
make it quick.
I got 'em, Mama.
I got 'em.
now... I won't be seeing you in Heaven...
...but you enjoy it for the both of us, okay?
all right.
you like Floyd Patterson?
man could box. - How 'bout Tyson?
man could hit.
both trained by Gus D'Amato. Suck it.
those who can't do, teach.
you might want to get your zoot suit on. Van to Maybelle'll be here soon.
Yeah, before I catch that ride, I,uh, I almost took a 22-caliber tattoo right here today.
okay? I'm doing this to get to my daughter faster, not the cemetery.
so if the cases keep being like this, this "one month off" thing needs to get jacked up.
this whole "one month off" thing is all you're ever gonna get.
there's no renegotiations. This week it was a killer.
next week, it'll be a rapist. The week after that, who knows.
at least the coffee's free.
transpo will be here for him in 30 minutes.
Lowery better do something or he's gonna miss his chance.
are you a doctor?
cause you've got the arrogance of a white coat.
I'm an MD.
and a PhD.
you got more letters than the alphabet. Good for you.
you here to analyze me, Doc?
fix me up before I go back to the animal factory?
ask me some probing questions? Find out how I go tick-tock?
you want to know if I kill with ease because my daddy raped his retarded sister and I got spit out, slightly more useful than the afterbirth?
or maybe it's 'cause I didn't make captain of the gridiron gang.
never had a Cherry Valance of my own.
or maybe 'cause of the bookworm queens, who later grow up to be PhMD's, stared down their noses at me so much I thought the sun was a big, old snotball.
or maybe it's 'cause when I watch a man die at my hand,
I finally feel Theodore Bagwell matters more than all those gnat's asses in the world.
because I know, dear, kind doctor, that in that moment, nothing matters more in that soon-to-be-dead man's eyes than I!
because I...
I am his gatekeeper to life or death.
well?
is it that menagerie of misery that makes me so special a case study, Doc?
is it?
you know it's not, Theodore.
when we started this case...
...I thought I was going to get some great insight into why you are the way you are
a look into a complex psyche, a glimpse into the neurological map of a madman that could show some light on some bigger truths, that could maybe help other sick people one day.
as I got up-close and personal with you, and your handiwork, I found a truth.
it was a small one, though.
as unexciting as it may sound, some machines just come out of the factory broken.
you're a broken machine.
open on 12.
open on 12.
did you get it?
at first, I was nervous, then I figured, what can they do to me?
I can't get in trouble for stealin' flour from the kitchen.
you can't steal from yourself, man.
our state government spends a total of 6. 4% of total tax revenues on prisons.
that's $1. 6 billion a year.
now... look around you.
you tell me somebody's not skimming off the top.
they steal from us.
I'm going to miss your wisdom, Christian.
good luck tomorrow, patriot.
you keep fighting the fight, patriot.
mailing threatening letters to a government official is a serious offense.
plead guilty now and we'll recommend six months.
I have to go to the bathroom.
how about an answer first?
any prisoner not afforded access to a bathroom facility has had his substantive due process rights, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, violated DeShantey v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services.
unbelievable.
cuffs stay on. Clean up's your problem.
let's go. They're waiting.
just wrapping it up, boss.
come on, Beaumont, pinch it off.
Beaumont, you hear me?
lockdown! Lockdown! We have full lockdown!
listen up, cons. Christian Beaumont
he used a light bulb filled with flour and match heads doused in alcohol to bolt the county court house where he was facing charges for mailing threatening letters to the county land assessor.
sent them right from his prison cell.
everyone thought he was stupid.
but his plan all along was to find a less secure location, so he could make his move.
Beaumont-- where, uh, where have I heard that name before?
cause four years ago, the government seized his family farm to build a highway.
he refused to leave.
when Federal agents came to get him, he just started firing.
standoff lasted two days.
killed one, wounded three.
and that's not to mention the two court officers that he dropped this morning.
I remember this guy. Dude's like a folk hero for crazy crackers.
um, Charlie, your wife's on line one.
could you tell her I'll call her back, please?
um, can he all you back?
okay.
uh, she just wants you to know that your salsa lesson was canceled.
didn't know you were a dancer, man.
are you strictly salsa, or do you also lambada?
cause I gotta tell you, that dance is forbidden.
moving on. Mother: Carol. Deceased. Father: Ellis. Alive.
the father seems to share the same anti-government bent as his son, and when junior got incarcerated, he joined an extremist group called the Patriot Front.
you mean as in,"These patriots are going to sit"on our front porch with shot guns if we see anybody that walk by who don't look like us?
these people just use racial pride to cover up racist hate.
couldn't agree with you more. Can't stand those groups.
patriot Front, Black Panthers.
the point is, dummies, Beaumont could have support on the outside.
hello. I'm Dr. Lockwood
christian Beaumont's incarceration psychiatrist.
thank you for coming by, Doctor.
we'll be in there.
the three of you go talk to Beaumont's family. Lloyd, you're with me.
christian has severe rage disorder and acute persecution complex.
it was exacerbated by what he feels was an unlawful government seizure of his family's land.
simply put, he's a very angry man.
what's your protocol? Meds, cognitive therapy?
he refused medication. Once a week-- strict Freudian analysis.
Freudian analysis? Wow.
is this 1950? After sessions, do you take him to the sweet shoppe for a malted, or...
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm sorry, too. I'm Lloyd Lowery. Harvard class of '93.
harvard med school class of '97. I'm the resident psychiatrist here.
where did you matriculate? - The University of Illinois.
Oh, state school.
Charlie: Look, I'm sorry.
we're just looking for anything that will give us some insight into the man.
the Anarchist Diaries.
christian was particularly fond of the author, Carl Huntz, who was executed by the Federal government for killing a district court judge.
the guy's a martyr to the anti-government crowd.
you let Beaumont have this book?
as I stated, the man suffers from a persecution complex.
if I, as a government employee, denied him reading material...
he's an amateur. - Tone it down, Lowery!
I'm sorry, Charlie.
he doesn't want to deny a very angry mana handbook on violence and uprising, because he'd rather have him on his couch with a box of tissues, talking about penis envy.
you know, I think I'm done here.
by the way, Dr. Lowery, I am aware of who you are, but...
I won't be spoken down to by a person who doesn't even have his medical license anymore.
Charlie, I couldn't keep quiet any longer.
you didn't keep quiet at all, Lloyd.
I mean, I bring you in there for your expertise and you piss all over the guy?
you have one use to me here-- that's it.
guess what happens when you stop providing that.
dig up everything you can on that author, please.
Lockwood's a hack. You want to know what makes Beaumont tick?
you look at his family.
okay, who do you think cultivated his persecution complex?
that's why I'm glad that my father wasn't in my life.
men screw up boys.
you're not close with your dad?
lars Lowery? No, not really. I haven't seen him in about 30 years.
Oh. Well, as my mother explains-- there's extenuating circumstances.
he lives in Holland. And he's a pretty wealthy and important guy, so he wasn't readily available for Little League.
we might have an issue here.
the ten-year anniversary of Huntz's execution is the 15th of this month.
that's tomorrow. - Yes...
Yes, people with Beaumont's pathology love dates.
they are the fence posts upon which unstable ideological flags are flown.
like McVeigh's attack on the anniversary of the Waco siege.
we already know that Beaumont's good with explosives.
do you think he could be planning some kind of attack for the anniversary?
well, if he is, it makes sense he started mailing those letters out eight months ago.
he knew it would take a while to get a court date and he got out just under the wire.
you with the Marshals?
Oh, yeah, you got that look.
the same look people had that took our farm.
left us with this prime half acre.
what are you doing on my land?
Where's Christian?
haven't seen him.
wouldn't tell you if I did.
well, let's start off with this. What are these patches here?
flag Day fireworks.
you heard of Flag Day?
if the grand wizard's having a picnic, maybe I'll pull up a chair.
you want to break bread with me, old man?
this is not fireworks. More like explosives.
Hey, Fourth Amendment.
you can't even come back up in here without probable cause.
plain sight rule.
your Honor, the incriminating evidence was clearly visible from the highway.
you can see those burn marks from over there?
I ate a lot of carrots.
nickel shavings. Someone cut off handcuffs.
you got no right to be in my shed.
I'm going to sue you for everything you've got.
send the papers to my summer home.
Where's your hacksaw?
it's gone missing.
you didn't use it to saw off your son's handcuffs?
how about we ask you again-- this time at the Marshals office.
let's do that.
that way I can file a report about the saw, which has clearly been stolen.
and file a complaint against you for illegal search and seizure.
now...
get off the little bit of property I have left.
because we both know you got no basis to arrest me.
you'll never touch me-- or my son.
44 cents for a stamp, huh?
Hey, you name one private company that can raise its prices every year while the service gets worse.
whatever, right?
I'm just trying to mail a letter, bro.
Yeah, by all means, bro.
you have a good day.
officer: Please, stay behind the tape.
screen captures from the security cameras.
the images are fed real time to the central office, so they're preserved.
we got him leaving that package next to a desk and then taking off before the explosion.
he hit a Federal institution.
they took his property, he'll take theirs.
I've seen work done like this before.
ammonium nitrate extracted from fertilizer.
I mean, materials like this, you need a license for it.
Jules, get me a list of all licensed dealers of regulated fertilizer in the area.
on it.
What're you thinkin'?
I'm thinking Beaumont could've hit a number of Federal properties
national parks, military recruitment centers-- but he picked a post office.
that in order to cripple the enemy, you first have to kill their method of communication.
Yeah, but it's just a small post office.
Yeah, but it's symbolic. I think Beaumont was honoring Huntz.
and if he's that determined to celebrate this man, then he's definitely not gonna let tomorrow's anniversary of his execution go unnoticed.
so he's not through here?
this might be just the warm-up.
Charlie DuChamp, U.S. Marshals.
we're here to talk to you about your fertilizer.
can't right now. It's the busy season. A lot of people buying.
anybody by the name of Christian Beaumont?
I don't know names.
well, his father has crates in his shed with your company's logo on it.
Yeah, well, I sell to lot of people.
Hey, right here.
Oh, my goodness, I think this is because you're brown.
Charlie, he will not look at you because you are brown.
Hey, check this out
every week,"ten bags, ten bags, 12 bags, ten bags.
how come all of a sudden this guy's gotta have 50 bags"no later than the 14th"?
and I only count ten here. Where're the other 40?
plain Sight Rule. See, Ray? I'm learning.
Aw, look how much he hates you, Shea. Oh, this is fascinating stuff.
40 bags of fertilizer? That's enough to take down a skyscraper.
Erica, any fertilizer out back?
been looking. Nothing so far.
Hey, you can't send Marshals behind my shop.
you're supposed to report any purchases.
people buy two, three bags at a time.
I don't have to report quantities that small.
I've violated no law. You can't arrest me.
look, I don't care who you are or what you believe in.
if you gave Christian Beaumont fertilizer to make bombs, we will nail you for murder same as him.
maybe somebody who looks like you stole it.
ray, I'll take care of it.
you take orders from him? It's an upside-down world.
next thing you know, dogs'll be walkin' people.
ray! - I wish I'd done it.
you're in trouble now, pigs.
it's gonna jump off early in the morning, so we get a full day of news coverage.
you'll link our sites to the major network?
Yeah, they'll be linked like sausages, my man.
all our brothers will hear the news almost before it happens.
the Marshals came by. They were asking about you.
maybe you should just...
take a beat, huh? - What?
Why?
after everything they took from us?
Carl Huntz wouldn't back down. Neither would Mom.
I ain't sayin', for one second, you should do anything but send the message that needs to be sent.
you bring them to their knees, Christian.
you do it in a way where you come home to me.
you're all I got left. - I'm willing to die for the cause, Dad.
I'm not afraid.
they're the ones who should be afraid now.
did you get a name? - Yeah.
McCalister, what can you do with the name Charlie DuChamp?
I installed computers for the government for 15 years.
what do you want me to do with it?
this book is just a series of violent ramblings. There's no way to know where he's gonna strike.
well, anger needs focus, and if that fraud therapist is correct, then Beaumont's focus would be the taking of his property.
Jules, tell Federal Protective Services to alert government buildings that deal with property rights: HUD, land surveyors, anything that you can think of.
I been trying. The computers are acting funny today.
just got this from Director Knox. The feed store guy filed an assault complaint.
now we so much as tail the guy, we're getting sued.
the guy needed a beating.
he sued us? Ah...what a dick.
so glad you punched him, you violent Italian.
see, man? You're always sayin' racist stuff.
so how come you don't like it when the guy we're chasin' do it?
no, no, no, I say racial stuff, not racist stuff. I merely state facts.
a racist is an idiot because to believe that one group is genetically superior to another is scientifically baseless.
cultural superiority, on the other hand...
see? Racist.
how much you want to bet that you dance better than me?
I state facts.
listen, baby, can you not leave personal messages for me with Julianne.
well, the only way I can get through to you lately is through Julianne.
no... That's a little passive/aggressive.
did you learn that from Lloyd?
Hey, did you order anything?
we just received a package. With no return address.
no, Marisol, don't pick it up!
what? Why?
baby, please, drop it and run! Marisol, please!
Marisol, drop it and run, please! Marisol!
here ya go.
can I talk to you for a sec?
I'll be back, okay?
she's gonna need 20 stitches. How you doing?
how you holding up?
fine.
look, if she wasn't on the phone with you, if she wasn't running away when it detonated
this is scary stuff.
it's okay for you to be feelin' this a little bit.
ray, I'm fine, okay?
look, we don't have a lot of time. If our theory is right about Beaumont, the 15th is tomorrow.
I'm gonna take her to the hospital, make sure she's okay, and then I'm getting back to work.
besides, you don't need to be worrying about me right now.
you need to be thinking about your own family.
julianne said the computers have been acting funny. We were hacked.
the personnel files have been breached. If they got to my data, then...
Teresa! Teresa, hey, baby, it's Daddy! Are you here?
Ray... - Where's my kid?
our kid is upstairs doing her homework.
she's probably got the earbuds in. Hey, Teresa, get down here! Pack a bag!
No! The judge said no visitation till you're out of that halfway
there's a runner, Christina, and he's dangerous, and he might have information on my family, like where they live...
dad?
go pack a bag; you and Mom are going over to Grandma's house.
no, we're not gonna pick up and go anywhere until I know exactly
I swear to God, Christina, this is not the time to play "Bust Ray's Stones"!
go pack a bag. - Teresa, Everything okay?
he says there's some criminal that could pose a danger.
does. Does pose a danger.
I'm taking my kid out of here until things cool off.
well, we appreciate your concern, Ray, but we have an arrangement:
you call before you come over. I'm sure the halfway house has a phone.
you appreciate my concern? That is my kid, not yours!
you open your mouth again, I will duct tape you to the front tree, paint a bull's-eye on your chest and give the runner this address myself.
five seconds, Chrissy.
you can leave with her, or I carry her outta here myself.
we'll pack light.
still a Jet fan?
Yeah. - Jets suck.
okay, yes, sir, I'll tell them. Bye.
um, that was Director Knox.
seems Beaumont may have gotten access to more than just Marshals info on our system.
if you're saying what I think you're saying,
I'm about to blow up bigger than that post office.
HQ said that your files were vulnerable, but there's no evidence
there wasn't supposed to be any file on us!
part of the deal was that this task force was put together on the QT
that's what they told us. And now you're gonna tell me this
take it easy. It's not her fault.
you protecting your little girlfriend now?
she's one of them. - What? No?
I mean, yes, yes, I will defend her from your diatribe, but she is not my girlfriend. You're not my girlfriend.
Hey, Ray, do you have any idea what would've happened to me if it gets out that Shea Daniels is working with cops?
ray, I've got a kid. Could Beaumont know who we are?
put your minds at ease. You're criminal scumbags, just like him.
Beaumont doesn't care about you. He cares about real cops.
Oh, and by the way-- Charlie's wife is fine. Thanks for asking.
shea: Oh, this is still bullshit.
I don't know why Shea would say something so ridiculous. Girlfriend and...
it... It's okay.
uh, you can use my phone if you want to warn your mother.
just to be safe.
well, she, she has Tai Chi every Wednesday, so I'm pretty sure she can defend herself adequately, but thanks.
actually, maybe I should call my dad, too. You know, just to be safe.
do you think you could track him down with your computer?
Yeah, sure. I'm sure I can find something.
Thanks.
what are you doing here? - Working.
Yeah, but your wife... - Is healing.
and Beaumont is planning. He's not getting any rest, and neither am I.
Oh! They're doing it again!
they're hacking us right now. Look, look, see the screen's completely locked up
can you trace where it's coming from?
not exactly.
but I might be able to find out who's on right now.
okay, I'm reversing the signal. And gotcha, bitch!
sorry.
he's hacking us through a protected server that's hosting a Web site honoring Carl Huntz.
a Huntz site-- why didn't we look into this?
there's over 3, 000 of them.
okay, the site is registered to a George McCalister. Running background.
he used to install computers for the city of Newark. Got a government photo ID.
there's a pre-service memorial rally for Huntz in Bergen County in an hour.
I doubt our friend would miss that party.
there is a line of freedom that each and every one of us draws in the sand.
and our Federal-- I'm sorry, imperialist-- government crosses that line each and every day.
look at the statistics, people. You'll know what I'm talking about.
we are here to honor a man who fought for our rights as individuals each and every day of his life.
Mr. Carl Huntz is that man!
he fought for our rights! Let's take back our land! It's our land, not their land!
stand up and say,"Enough. " Mr. Carl Huntz, patriot, teacher, prophet.
he only not wrote The Anarchist Diary, he has the guts...
that's right!
the government officials "Don't publish that book, " they told him,"It's too controversial.
but he looked those people in the eye, and you know what he said? "The hell with you!
and when they told him,"We're gonna hold you responsible for the revolt...
no shame in feelin' her, man.
julianne got the naughty librarian thing goin' on.
LLOYD: Step the back off.
you probably don't even know what a librarian looks like, right?
Ohdamn! White girl's fast.
nice hit.
Charlie: So where's Beaumont?
I don't have to talk to you.
you're just a cog in the outlaw government's wheel.
he's a cog. I'm not even a cop.
that's why I punched your friend in the face this morning.
I can do things like that. It's a perk.
when's the last time you unzippered a man's fly?
other than my own? That would be never.
me, too.
but I'm not above fishin' for whatever crud-infested junk you got down there.
we're gonna have a weenie roast.
we know your type. Only tough when there's a computer to hide behind.
hand me that, Charlie.
he's got a bunker in Willard's Woods by some hay bales. It's off 91 near Crandon Lakes.
Hey.
what? I'm already getting sued.
here you go.
lars Lowery's number. - 614? That doesn't sound like Holland.
Columbus, Ohio.
you know, psychologists talk about confirmation bias
you tell yourself a lie, and then you ignore all of the facts that contradict it.
I've been doing that for 30 years.
I mean, know that every single thing my mother tells me about this man is a fabrication, but I confirm what I know to be false by clinging to every piece of plausibility presented by someone trying to protect me.
and it's so pathetic not wanting to know the truth.
shea: Hey, Professor, Charlie and Ray are downstairs. We gotta move. Let's go.
but you know what?
today, I gonna do it.
so thank you, Julianne.
Charlie: Don't see any power lines.
get the flashlights.
LLOYD: So, are we just gonna walk around forever?
shut up, Lloyd.
that's a pretty big pile of leaves.
christian Beaumont, come out with your hands up.
christian Beaumont, come out with your hands up.
I got your six.
we found the mother lode.
hold up, hold on.
it's a tripwire.
Charlie? - Yeah?
don't move, don't move. - Huh?
this is not good, Ray.
whatever you do, don't move a muscle.
holy shit!
at the rate this thing's blinking, they'll never get here in time.
Charlie, I'm making a run for it. - No, don't move!
you move your foot, we all die.
you all go! Except you, Lloyd.
excuse me?
if he's protecting this place with explosives, then there must be something important here.
just get in here and grab everything you can.
Charlie, I don't think I can withstand a bomb blastany better than, like, Shea or something.
you're the thinnest. You can squeeze by.
Erica is skinnier than me.
I'm not gonna bring another woman next to a bomb, all right?
now go. Do it! The rest of you-- go!
what if there's other booby traps around there, Charlie?
don't touch 'em. Go!
excuse me.
watch it. Be careful!
you know what you're doin'?
first EOD company, Seventh Battalion.
easy, easy. You're shaking it.
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.
come on, man. - Sorry.
be careful. - I'm sorry.
Oh, damn! He's shootin' at us! Get back inside!
ERICA: We're taking fire out here!
I need both of your guns!
what do you think, I'm gonna steal your gun? We gettin' shot at!
is that light blinking faster? - It's not. Just, just...
keep your cool. - You're fast as hell.
I'll lay down cover, you run to the car, start the engine.
he's gonna think you're trying to drive us out of here, and then...
I'll loop around and take him out-- I got it.
okay, on three: One, two, three!
excuse me.
keep the light on it, Ray. - Yeah, yeah.
shea: Cracker got, like, ten magazines.
ZANCANELLI: It's going faster.
shut up and let me concentrate.
Hey, Lloyd, if there's a break in gunfire, grab those boxes and run like hell, all right?
you wouldn't say that if we weren't running out of time.
shut up. - Get out of here.
we're fine, Ray.
Charlie... - Yeah?
if things go bad... - It's all right, all right?
I know what to tell your kid. - No, no, no, she knows I love her.
if things go bad, don't tell anybody I touched that guy's penis.
what? What did you say?
Charlie: All right, okay, look-- I'm gonna go behind that fridge.
there should ba canister of liquid nitrogen over there for the freezer.
I'll use it to freeze the detonator.
that should buy us a little bit of time when you move your foot, all right?
I'm not goin' anywhere.
be right back.
Hey, come on. Get out of here, man. - It's too heavy.
just go!
just go!
come on, man!
okay, okay, come on. Come on, Lloyd.
put your back into it. You put your back into it!
okay, one, two...
shea: Sit back down, Gomer.
okay, careful, Lloyd. - Yeah.
Charlie, I think the gunfire stopped. - Then go.
good luck, you guys.
you done this before?
I saw it on a movie once.
what movie?
space Balls. - Oh, that's funny.
you get him?
Crafty-ass redneck got away.
okay, someone should drive up to the bunker just in case they have to get out of there fast.
I drive away from bombs, not toward 'em.
that's a sound policy. Yeah.
a'ight, fine, fine. I'll do it. You got a kid.
Yeah, and I'd like to have kids, so you, you do it.
and when this freezes, it should buy us a little bit more time when we move your foot, all right?
okay, it's blinking slower. Should be working.
let's go!
you ready?
now!
Charlie: Punch it! Go! Go! Go!
looked like that was a whole lot of mess about nothing. Absolutely
you were sayin'?
Ugh, I've been looking all night.
with only a partial blueprint, I'm not going to be able to find a match for this building.
another copy of his favorite book.
fertilizer research and anti-government pamphlets.
pictures of his mother, letters to his mother...
okay, find out everything you can about this woman, and we'll know what Beaumont's next target is.
spell it out, Lloyd? - Look...
this book's his bible, right?
then he goes and he puts a make shift pocket in the back, where he can hold photos of him and Mommy covering his whole life.
he's got birthday cards in here, graduation cards
this thing is a shrine to his mother.
Carol Beaumont worked as a secretary at the Fish and Wildlife Service.
fired one month after Beaumont went to prison, no employment record after that.
six months later, died of a heart attack.
Yahtzee.
okay, look, this woman sees her only son arrested, prosecuted and then convicted by the Federal government.
and then the Feds, because they can't have the mother of a militia folk hero working in one of their offices, even as a secretary, they can her ass.
so the stress of losing her son, you can draw a straight line from emotional distress to cardiovascular risk.
she kicks the bucket.
and then Beaumont, who's too much of a coward to take the blame himself...
...blames the government. - Yeah.
fish and Wild life office is in downtown Newark.
make the call, Jules. Have them evacuate the building immediately.
officer: All right! Let's go!
Charlie: Excuse me. Pardon me.
banks from bomb squad said the building's been evacuated. No signs of Beaumont.
he wouldn't have gotten what he wanted anyway.
no parking garage, barricades
federal buildings are designed to withstand an attack. We were wrong.
I'm not wrong. No, he's going to pay tribute to his hero Huntz today, and he's going to do it by avenging his mother. I'm telling you.
Hey, now I'm not saying I once stole from a rival banger by sawing through the wall in the apartment next to him, but sometimes, you gotta take the side route.
top of that building looks a hell of a lot like the blueprint that Lloyd tore down.
underground parking, no barricades.
he hits a building that big, he doesn't only take out the Fed building, he takes out the whole block.
it's 9: 00 a. m. We can't evacuate all these people in time.
we got to find that bomb. Banks!
that's the building. That's it.
look for anything big enough to hold fertilizer in it-- a camper, a van...
a truck that has LaFontaine Feed on the side of it-- let's go!
you guys earned your combat pay today. Stay here.
A-4 level is clear! Moving up!
B-4 level is clear! Moving up.
we've got movement in the south stairwell.
Charlie, he's headed down the south stairwell. That's by you.
Charlie: Stop!
stop! Where's the bomb?
I refuse to recognize the authority of the United States government or any employee therein.
Where's the bomb, Beaumont?
I refuse to recognize the authority of the United States government, or any employee therein!
tell me.
I said tell me.
you don't mind dying, that's fine, but your father-- I'm going to take him into the woods and I'm going to hurt him real bad before I kill him.
and that'll be both your parents' deaths you have on your hands.
my father would be proud to die for the cause.
I'm never going to tell you where the bomb is.
so what are you going to do? You going to stay with me here?
you going to die with me? Boy?
this is the Bomb Squad. We found the truck.
bomb's set to blow in an hour. Should take 40 minutes to defuse. Evacuate, now.
all right, grab the son of a bitch. Come on, let's go.
Charlie, let's go.
you came after my wife.
come on, Charlie, this is not you! This is not what you do.
you know nothing about me, Ray. We got your bomb, boy.
so now you're not going to die for the cause anymore.
but you are going to die for messing with the wrong man's wife.
ZANCANELLI: Charlie, come on. Put the gun down.
you ready to see your dome split?
Charlie, come on. Put the gun down!
please.
Charlie! Charlie, put the gun down!
Hello? - Hi.
is this Lars Lowery? - Speaking.
who is this?
look, I want you to listen to me.
this job can be stressful.
one day, you will break down, if you don't find the balance.
like you did?
when you lost your marriage, and badge? - 'Cause I never found the balance.
go home to your wife. I'll take care of the cons.
Hey, uh...
ray wants everyone to go downstairs with him.
did you talk to your father? - Number didn't work.
well, uh, my bad.
though I have heard that there is a large Dutch population in Columbus.
so...
even if he had lived there at some point, it does confirm your mother's story.
Yeah, you know, I think I heard that, too.
actually, I think I read it in the Times.
well, I'm kind of spent, so I'm not going to go down to Turro's.
okay. - But I'll probably see you soon.
take care, Lloyd.
ZANCANELLI: Here's the deal. Maybelle thinks you're on your way back.
anyone asks, traffic was a bitch. Eat up, animals.
wow, pizza. After we just saved your ass from getting blown up.
what do I got to do to get a steak, give you CPR?
then don't eat it, then.
that's not why I did this. I know prison food sucks.
how 'bout a beer to wash it down?
that's a good idea. Big guy, one beer, three waters.
Oh, that's cold, man.
try to be a nice guy and you get your hump busted.
is it, is it that hard to say thank you?
where come from, you don't get thank-you for doing your job.
good work today.
good work.
guard: Keep it moving!
guard: Hey, Jansen, quit messing around.
keep 'em coming, McCann.
bon app tit, slim.
yo, what the hell?
time of death: 10: 17.
day, do me a favor. Call potter's field.
tell them we need special accommodationfor a large corpse?
hop to it, ladies.
nurse, get this man a cold compress.
Oh, you're going to earnyour two cents an hour today, boys.
he's got to be 500 pounds, easy.
watch the shackles, fellas. Lift with the legs.
it won't open.
one, two, three.
one, two, three...
holy shit!
easy, sonny.
let's jack him up, man.
keys, padre.
get him in the car.
yo, McCann! Take us with you! - Move it.
get in there, Ferris.
take us with you, man. Come on, man. Don't leave us.
so long, fellas.
Aw, come on!
lucky break for them that Chub Rock kicked the bucket.
ZANCANELLI: It's not luck. After the escape, they took another look at fat man.
ran a tox screen. McCa worked on the chow line.
he put something in this guy's food. Perchlorethylene.
that's a poison, it's found in household cleaners.
day worked in the infirmary where the DOA was boxed up.
I mean, who knows how long they've been planning this.
what were they in for?
um, McCann for felony robbery.
he would pose as atraveling salesman, gain permission to enter the home, then rob his victims at gunpoint.
and relatively speaking, Day was a lightweight.
he stole a car on a dare, allegedly.
the owner of the car, an elderly man, who Day yanked out of the driver's seat, had a heart attack and croaked.
felony murder. 25 years.
Lifelines? - Jules?
McCann grew up in Tallahassee.
orphaned at 13 when his parents died in a car accident.
kicked around foster care after that, no family left.
uh, Day's parents retired to Scottsdale.
marshals from the field office in Phoenix are paying a visit to see if they know anything.
but Day has a sister, Janice, who works at a design firm here in the city.
okay. Ray. You and Shea go talk to the sister.
Shea, am I boring you?
a new restaurant opened up down the block.
red Awning Steak House. It's a coupon for a free dinner.
for our neighbors to come see why we're a cut--""cut" underlined-- "above the rest.
that dinner includes a... steak? Like a...
real steak withall the fixings?
Yeah. I will fight for this.
fine by me. - May I see that, please?
I ain't joking, I haven't had a steak dinner in five years.
I will hit you for a filet mignon.
you will get nothing and like it.
right now there's a State Corrections Officerby the name of Dirk Ferris who's being held hostage by two fugitiveswho happen to have killed someone.
no time for grab-ass.
you never read Zig Ziglar?
zig Ziglar, Ray?
Motivation's like bathing, you gotta do it every day.
all right.
whichever one of you three animalsdoes the best on this caper, gets the steak dinner.
that's all I needed to hear. - I'm on it.
it's a bet. Let's go, then.
Janice Day? We're with the U. S. Marshals, we called on the way here.
if you can make an appointment. Thanks.
are you aware that your brother broke outof Cayuga Penitentiary earlier today?
I am. You can set up a time with my assistanteffrey.
I'm pretty sure I'm free early next week. Thanks.
what's your problem?
glad you asked.
you see, when I spoke to the prosecutors about how my brother stealing a car when he was 18didn't warrant 25 years, no one listened.
and when I told the warden he was having a hard timein prison, he didn't do a damn thing.
so everyone in law enforcement, which would include you two idiots, can line up and kiss my ass.
now, make an appointment or I'm calling security.
you want me to put you in cuffs for obstructing justice, and march you out of here in front of all your colleagues?
you would. - You're damn right.
your brother and the other guyhe busted out of prison with took a guard hostage.
so you're going to have to work throughwhatever hurt feelings you have and provide us with some information.
I don't know where he is. He hasn't contacted me.
you know, I hope you never catch him.
you said he was having a hard time in prison?
that's right. - Meaning...?
he said bigger prisoners were taking his stuff.
stuff? Like, as in, the personal area on your body that you don't want anyone messing around with?
look, I saw the intake photo of your brother when he was 18.
in the joint, there's... an appetite for guys who look like him.
now, I'm not clowning on him, and I'm not trying tobe disrespectful, but I've seen it happen in prison, and it ain't cool.
if he does something to that guard before we find him, he's going to have an even tougher timewhen he goes back in, because every guard will knowhe messed with one of their own.
so actually, you should want to help us find your brother.
Oliver would never hurt another person. Despite what's been done to him.
did he ever tell you he was sexually assaulted?
I could see the shame in his eyes.
something had been taken from him.
he just wasn't the same person anymore.
these are McCann and Day's possessions. Have at it.
I got it.
give me one.
Hey, Erica, listen, when they need somebody to, like, I don't know, run really, really fast, I'll totally defer to you, but when you'retalking about discerning psychological traits through personal possessions - I got it.
no, these things are hard to come by, and I like mine rare.
so that was Ray. Day's sister said Day was getting punked in prison.
were you aware of this?
Yeah, he came in young and tender.
I didn't like his odds. But a pretty boy like that... what can we do about it?
okay. So if he was assaulted in prison, and let's assume repeatedly, he's probably be suffering from some complexpost-traumatic stress disorder.
so this guy is a wild card.
how about McCann-- did he have a repof being a predator or another punk?
I don't know. He was only with usfor eight months, kept to himself.
were they cellies?
guard: No. They were only on the same tier for McCann's first two months, and then McCann was transferred to a different cell block.
after that, they would've had zero chance of crossing paths.
ATM hit on Dirk Ferris' bank card.
five minutes ago, at a convenience store in Binghamton.
okay, have the store pullthe security video, and notify local PD.
also have Ray and Shea meet us there. Let's go.
Hey. Bring Dirk home, okay? He's a friend of mine.
what the hell did you do?
he deserved it.
all right, listen to me. I'm not going to let youblow this for us, all right?
I mean, it's bad enoughI only got $80 out of this guy's account.
but the security guard around the corner, he gave me the stink-eye.
for all I know, he took down the plate number. We gotta be smart.
unless you want to go back to prison, huh? Is that what you want...
is that what you want? - Of course not.
good.
good.
Hey, you had the plan for, uh, for getting us out, and for that I owe you.
and, uh, there's $100, 000 out there waiting for us, right?
Yeah.
well, you'll never get it without me.
flying under the radar, not getting caught, that's what I bring to the table.
now I'll get us to the stash, just like I said I would, but, uh, you gotta get it together.
you got to listen to me. - All right.
all right, let's go.
being nonviolent.
either we find them or we find more bodies. We got to figure this thing out.
security guard from across the streetthought he heard a gunshot.
he walked over, saw the preacher's car pull upand then peel the hell out.
other than that, he's got nothing.
they tortured this guy.
there's three shell casings on the groundand one of them would have done the job.
two sets of footprints. Looks like McCann and Day are still together.
that would indicate some kind of relationship.
a Siegfried and Roy type?
what do you mean, are those dudes gay?
no, probably something more unbalanced, like maybe McCann's the daddy and Day follows his orders, you know.
as for the guard, I would put my money on Day, 'cause after what he's been through in prisonhe capable of anything.
if Day's being turned out by McCann, then why is he still running with him?
victims of prolonged abuse sometimes become dependenton their captors, and they're reduced to an infantile state.
well, maybe the guy who worked in the infirmary and the guy who worked in the kitchen thought they both could help each other escape.
listen, enough with the theories. Let's find these guys.
Hey, check this out.
d" for Day?
it's got to be.
Lloyd called it.
that doesn't earn him the steak, right?
look, Knox is already up my ass wondering why there are two escaped felons killing a correctional officer instead of being taken to prison by us.
I don't want to hear about a steak dinner.
why would he leave his initials? Who does he think he is, Zorro?
well, that's how you mark your bitch in prison, with a tattoo or a brand.
there's three things you got to know if you're going to make money selling door-to-door.
number one is you got to look good.
all right, the customer's staring at youthrough a keyhole, so you got to make an impression. Put your jacket on.
why don't we just rob a liquor store or something?
cause home invasion is a one-stop shop.
we get food, money, wheels--clothes that don't come out of a church donation box. Damn tie's stained.
plus we can get you on a computerso you can track down this Terry Miller.
all right.
the second thing isyou got to be confident in your product, okay?
you're selling something the customer can't live without.
what are we selling? - Doesn't matter. Today it's vacuums.
nobody wants to buy that thing. - They just need to open the door.
what are you going to do with your half of the hundred grand?
head up to Alaska.
get a fishing boat.
when I was a kid, I played baseballin a traveling team.
I was 12 years old playing with 15-year-olds.
and, uh, my dad used to drive me all overtaking me to tournaments.
the first thing I'm going to do...
catch a ball game in Florida.
you said there were three things a salesman has to know. Appearance, confidence-- that's two things.
what's the third thing?
this is the third thing.
girlie mags?
Yeah. McCann had a lot of them stashed away in his cell.
so much for your gay theory, Shea.
don't mean nothing.
I've seen guys go in with a wife and kids, come out gayer than a clambake.
uh, one odd thing though. Columbus by Derek Haas.
a novel about an international assassin.
they both checked it out of the prison library, multiple times.
passing messages through the library card. - Find me something.
no mention of a jailbreak in the book. But after what happened today in prison, maybe he was looking for pointerson how to defend himself.
there are way easier ways to cover your ass in prison.
like?
you know those tuna packetsthey sell in the commissary?
at nighttime, you take that stuff, you smear it all over your body, okay?
then you don't shower for three months.
the smell would make an attacker throw up instantly.
and you also have to sit alone at chowand talk to yourself like you're a crazy person. "Hey.
Hey. "Hey. What? I'll kill you. "Shut up.
so you were that dude. - Hell yeah, I was.
house? What-what... what house? Where?
I have no freaking idea.
but now that I've cracked their little secret decoder ring, I am going to find out...
Oh, I just got a hit on the old man's car.
when it rains, it pours, baby.
one second, Gary.
Yeah, Charlie, we got a location.
just outside a small town in Upstate New York called...
why we stopping here for?
cause either our boys got lucky, and when their car died, someone passed themout on that road and they jacked 'em...
or they hoofed it in to civilization.
all right. Split up. Everyone take a store.
yo. For the record, what she said was obvious.
no way that should count towards the thing I can't mention.
the delicious, perfectly seasoned, 14-ounce... thing I can't mention.
afternoon. Charlie DuChamp, U.S. Marshals.
I'm looking for these two men. Have you seen them?
no.
well, they're looking to steal a ride.
can you check to see if your car is still parked outside?
I walk to work. Look, I'm sorry, but we're closing, sir, so if you could please just exit the store the way you came in.
how about...I leave you my number, and if you happen to see anything, then just give me a call.
take care.
they're in the pharmacy. You two cover the back.
with what, my good looks? - I'll do it.
thanks for the help, Shea.
okay, he left. All right, open the register. Come on.
move. Let's go. Let's go.
cop!
my heart!
ZANCANELLI: Charlie, you okay?
let's go.
move the car, or I drop his brains on the floor.
move it!
get him in the car. Keys.
give me your keys!
they took the keys.
couldn't get a plate. - I'll call it in.
okay. Okay. So...
it's all about going for the money for them.
cause, right here, it says,"It's all about getting the money from the house.
we just need to know where the damn house is. You know?
okay. That was the Marshals' geek squad.
they found a searchon the old man's computer for a Terry Miller.
great. So that's... that's where they're going.
Yeah.
except there are 4, 500 Terry Millersin the United States.
pharmacist's car was a newer model--2005 or better.
can you narrow it down at all?
next time, I'll try to geta better look when I'm getting shot.
it was a whitemid-size SUV, okay?
give us a minute.
believe this guy?
you need to relax.
relax? We lost the runners and gained a hostage.
why the hell should I relax, Ray?
because your pump is going to explode.
three inches higher, and that bullet hits a major artery in your thigh and I'm making a phone call to your wife.
it just grazed me, Ray. And these heart episodes are rare, okay?
I'm fine. Just mind your business.
we were in a firefight, and my partner was useless. This is my business.
keep your mouth shut. You want everybody to hear?
just do your job or find yourself another one.
EMT said to use this and go home.
but I assume you're only going to follow half of that advice.
officer: I just got a call.
pharmacist and his car were founddumped behind a big box store.
pharmacist was tied up, but he's fine.
big box means big parking lot. They switched up their rides.
well, there's hundreds of cars in a parking lot that size, man.
it'll take us hours to find the make and model.
more needle-in-a-haystack bullshit.
Hey, Jules.
McCann and Day were using the computerto search the name Terry Miller.
uh, I found a recent home sale to a Mr. Terry Paul Miller just 15 miles from where you are now.
he's done time for drug possession.
maybe he and our runners crossed paths in the system.
Lloyd cracked the code, and there is constant reference to a house.
that could be the house.
all right. Thanks, Jules.
what do you got? The needle.
you ready?
Yeah.
damn it, I hate dogs.
you're scared of dogs? - I didn't say I was scared.
I said I hate them. Big ones bite.
Terry Miller, U.S. Marshals.
what do you want?
I want you to open the damn door. - Put the dog away.
TERRY: Why? What's going on?
I don't like this. He's stalling. He could be looking for a weapon.
somebody split out the back.
ready? - Yep.
u. S. Marshals.
get your hand out of that jar! - Take it easy, man.
get your hand out of the jar! Get that dog back!
Marley, chill the hell out, man. - I will shoot you, Marley.
get your hand out of the jar!
think I just earned a steak dinner.
ZANCANELLI: All right, I'm going to countto three. If you don't release whatever weapon you got in that jar,
I will kill this dog. One.
two.
Yeah. - Um, Ray?
I kind of made a mistake.
what kind of mistake, Julianne?
I gave you the wrong Terry Miller.
Seriously?
listen. Lloyd finished the code, and "the house" stands for Kellen Stackhouse,
day's former cellie in prison. Had a rep as a sexual predator.
ZANCANELLI: Get to the point, Julianne.
the Terry Miller you wantwas Stackhouse's prison pen pal. Now they're engaged.
they live together 20 miles south of there.
uh, sorry for the confusion. Hope I haven't caused any problems.
this here was a big mistake.
why wouldn't you take your hand out of the jar? You could have been killed.
weed? - I was scared.
on behalf of the United States Marshals we, uh, we apologize for any inconveniencethat we may have caused, all right?
go ahead andenjoy your marijna as if we were never here.
you're not going to have any problems.
dude had wheels. Is it just me, or are white people getting faster?
what?
Yeah. It's me.
day: Imagine how hurt I waswhen I hear in the yard that you're getting married.
my invitation must've gotten lost in the mail.
the boys inside couldn't believe it.
the House found some sweet, forgivingChristian woman to take him in.
now he's going to be living the good life.
so on your wedding night, you gonna holdyour bride down by the back of her neck?
you tell the ushers to bring cigarettesand cash so that they could take turns on her, too?
what?
this? This is just a warm-up.
you should see what I did to that pig of a guardyou grafted so you could trade me out in the storage room.
listen, Day, you don't want to do this.
this isn't you. - This isn't me?
you made me.
and this is all I am now. - Get that thing away from me!
this is for your protection. This is to make people knowthat you belong to me!
Hey. I can't find it anywhere.
just keep looking. There's no place else to look!
all right, I emptied every drawer, closet. I tore up all the floorboards, man. There's nothing.
whoa, whoa, what is it you want? Huh?
I can help you find it. Then you can go. - Shut up!
look, we want the money.
where the hell's the money your rich little girlfriend's got?
we keep around a grand. It's under the TV in the bedroom.
just... just take it.
a-a grand? No, no, we want the money. All right?
we know, we know that your little, uh, prison pen pal's got a stash, man. Where...?
the money you were telling Day about, where is it? The hundred grand!
she's a lab technician. STACKHOUSE: She inherited this house.
we got no money here, all right? I swear!
you lied to me?
there was never any Alaska for you, was there? There was no fishing boat.
this was all just aboutgetting revenge on Stackhouse.
you lied so I'd help you escape.
well, I had a place to go back to.
you're going to shoot me, shoot me.
I had a plan, too, and I am going to stick with it.
ray, you take the back.
you two cover the sides in case someone tries to bolt.
Hey, don't you pass out on me! We're just getting started.
how am I supposed to get by on a grand? Huh, Day?
do you have... Do you have any idea how bad you screwed me?
I'm taking the car, I'm getting out of here.
you move, you die.
where the hell is Day? Is he in the house? Any hostages in there? Huh?
gun! - I'm gonna kill him!
then I'll kill you!
you gotta help me, man. - Shut up!
take it easy. All right? Take it easy.
Shea, put McCann in the car. Erica, go with him. Ray, you got a bead?
got him.
you shoot, I will shoot. - Take it easy.
nobody's shooting anyone tonight. All right?
I'm gonna kill him right here. - Charlie, I got a shot.
not yet, Ray.
we know what you went through on the inside, but you're the guy with the gun right now. Put it down.
he deserves to die! - That's not your call to make, Oliver.
Yes, it is! My first night in prison, he told me that if I fought back, he would make it worse.
he traded me for smokes, for foodfor five and a half years, every single day.
if it's not my call, then whose is it? Huh?
what? Now he gets to live happily ever after, after he turned me into an animal?
Oliver, wait. No one can make you something that you're not, but if you pull that trigger, then it's on you.
No!
get her out of here. - Kellen?
Shea, grab her. Hold her back.
listen to me. I got something to say. This man is not who you think he is.
I can take him, Charlie. - Wait a second.
when I got to prison, he preyed on me, tortured me emotionally, sexually...
I was 18 years old. I just wanted to take a car for a joyride.
I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
this belongs to you?
no. That never belonged to me.
it's not true, honey.
nice. Back in time for din-din. Raymond, shall we?
what makes you think you're gettin' it?
I cracked the code that cracked the case.
so soon I will be cracking lobster tailsas I enjoy my surf and turf.
back it up, Professor. Anyone can sitin a warm office all day and read books.
I jumped off the Dumpster like Jimmy "Superfly" Snukaand tackled a dude today.
he was a pothead.
Yeah, but we thought he was legit when I went after him.
guy was baked. Lloyd could have taken him down.
see, that was uncalled for. What?
what pothead? - The pothead house you sent us to.
maybe you was rippin' off a few bong hits yourself.
all right, Charlie should get this.
he went Lawrence Taylor on a guy, even with a bum leg.
but I did promise it to a con, and when I asked for backup at the pharmacy, it was Erica who got behind e wheel in two seconds.
Thanks, Ray.
shocker. You give it to the person with the most boobs.
no. "Better is the dinner of herbs, where the love is, than that of a stalled ox, and hatred therewith.
I actually read that on the back of a tea bagabout ten years ago, and it stuck.
you're a vegetarian? - Yeah.
Oh, damn. Just...
Yeah. I'm a vegetarian who likes to win. Suck it.
all right, losers. Get dressed. I'm taking youback to the joint.
that ain't right.
she ripped it twice, man.
I can run the animals back to Maybelleif you want to go home and rest.
you know, Day just wanted to be 18 again, like, before...
before any of this ever happened to him.
the cons just would like to have a mealat a restaurant, like they used to.
and you don't admit it, but you wish you had your family back.
I wish my heart workedlike it did back when I was a kid.
McCann just wanted to go backto when his parents were alive and life was good.
but you know what the truth is, Ray?
there ain't no going back, man.
ain't no going back.
you know damn well who did this.
Yeah. Bummer. Now clean it up.
you just can't let those bastards do this to you.
Yeah, well, there's three of them and one of me.
Yeah, well, you go in hard, you surprise them, huh?
you could take these humps!
you make the first move, and once you do, you draw 'em in, I use this.
you really gonna back me up?
you'd do the same for me, huh?
last call for...
last call for...
the commissary will be closing in ten minutes.
I got your back.
lock it down! Lock it down!
backup! Someone call for backup!
lock it down! Lock it down!
you bastard!
let's go, let's go.
Snitch" is with a "T," by the way.
convicts, on the ground! Hands in the air!
convicts, on the ground! Hands in the air!
if that door ain't open in two seconds, you're on your own.
let's go. Let's go.
you sure you brought everything?
come on. Move your ass!
this... this better hold.
baby, I am so proud of you.
helping out the U. S. Marshals, not in a million years did I think...
Hey, you're getting out early because of it. That's all I care about.
no, you're right. You're right.
so, the people you're working with, they're nice?
I guess they're all right, for cops.
and the other informants?
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't no informant.
baby, I didn't mean it like that.
I haven't given them dick on anyone I used to run with.
they just bounce stuff off me, that's all.
Shea, you're the same man that I've always known. Nothing has changed.
if anything, I love you more now, because you're doing what's right by us.
baby, when we're together again, we're gonna be free and clear-- no more running. We can't go back to that.
Hey, you smell good.
I wish we could be alone.
you don't even want to know what you go throughto get into one of them conjugal trailers.
no way I'm having any C. O. take a rubber glove to you.
Daniels, no excessive contact! Daniels!
I want you, baby.
let me figure something out.
my man.
Daniels, transpo van is here.
Andre Brennan. Escaped while his cellie basically started a riot.
started it as a distraction?
we'll never know. His cellie's dead.
how'd he escape?
they don't know. Warden's doing an investigation.
well, he was in for tax evasion, but has been a suspected associate of the Bad Elvises.
anyone?
a ring of international jewelry thieves. Never caught.
correct.
they're known for sophisticated methods, advanced materials, coded communications, and they are violent.
jewelry store in Brussels two years ago-- heist gone wrong.
security guards never stood a chance.
Interpol never pinned it on him, but we know he was the mastermind.
wait, can we go back? Bad Elvises
could they do no better for a name?
they were given the nameby the press after a heist where they all wore ridiculous pompadour wigs.
that's no excuse.
now Breakout Kings, that's a name that got ring to it.
breakout Kings"? Is that what they're calling us?
I love it.
we're not called Breakout Kings. - Why not?
cause we're not breaking out of anything.
you know what? Don't worry about it.
Hello, blue eyes. Come to mama.
he's got a Park Avenue address, a boat, a Bentley Flyer! Whoa!
he was living the high life.
must've been thieving for a long timebefore they caught him.
you guys want alone time with the files orare you ready to do some work?
I don't know, Ray. Have you seen the folderon this guy's conjugal visitors? It's amazing.
Shea, would I be correct, in referringto this gentleman as a playa with mad game, yo?
Yeah, back in the '80s.
check this out. This just came from the warden's office.
a tip of a copied keyfound inside the lock in the visitors' area.
what the hell's that made out of?
plastic. Melted-down toothbrush, most likely.
he got that copy from somebody.
I'd be talking to trustees and guards, see who knew him.
take a trip to the prison.
Charlie. - Yeah.
uh, think we could talkabout me getting some alone time with my girl?
anything else you need? Candlelight, bubble bath?
come on, man, I'm just looking for a little time.
you are getting time, Shea. Time off your sentence.
other than that, you get nothing. Do your job.
Jules, on our way there, run every trustee. I want to see anybody that's had contact with him.
also pull his visitation log. Andre's up to something. I want to know what.
that's some bad luck, huh?
the key breaks off in the lock, we would've never looked into you.
lots of trustees like me are around keys, boss.
hate to break it to you, but you're gonna have to keep looking.
how many trustees have wivesthat make nine dollars an hour folding laundry and go out and a brand-new Escalade, cash?
she got taken onthe upholstery and leather insurance.
you never get that.
I told her two days ago to siton the money for a year, and she goes outand buys an Escalade?
now, Fuente, why don't you just tell us everything you know.
then we won't have to go after your wifefor aiding and abetting, and as a conspirator in the escape.
I'll kill her. I'm seriously gonna kill her.
now!
Andre gave me 25 grand to make a copy of a key.
come on. The rig cost more than 25K.
I told Andre I needed another week, and he just about blew a gasket.
he said he needed to be out by this morning, and he'd double my price.
why the hurry?
I don't know. His wheels were always turning, you know?
where is he headed? Where is he going?
probably female-related.
you should have sawsome of the tomatoes that were coming to visit him.
it was like a Victoria's Secret catalog. I mean, I'd say,"Andre, who's that knockout?
I don't know how he did it.
he is well-endowed. I guarantee it.
JULIANNE: How can you tell?
I mean, I-I don't, I don't care. It's just, you know, you said that... Ray. Yes! I'm here.
he's confident, yet calm.
he doesn't need to resort to all the nonsenseguys do that need to compensate.
he knows what he's got. Look at that expression. It's, like,"Whatever.
I don't need to make a big deal out of it. You know why?
because I'm packing.
all that from a mug shot. - Yes.
it's a sub symptom of immediate gratification where in Andre gets high from vicious cycles of spending.
and he spends 'cause he's a walking id, and he steals 'cause he can't not spend.
he's incapable of laying low, which is good news for us.
um, there is a dead man on the floor.
I bet Andre killed him. - No shit.
ray, I'm gonna need you and Erica to go check out a car.
these are safecracking tools. Andre and his boys are planning a job-- soon.
Kate: This is great. We should just tie some tin cans onto the bumper and bring a little more attention to ourselves.
what do they know, hmm? That we're planning to do a job?
it's a big city, Kate. We're fine.
anyone want to bail, now's the time to do so, but your cut will beexactly zero percent, which I'll assumewould be my share had I not returned.
you kidding? I've been waiting my whole lifefor a score this big.
what's her name? - You don't know her.
let me guess.
she's young and pretty and naive, and believes everything you tell her.
I'm sorry, Kate. I thought I'd said it enough times, but apparently I haven't:
get your damn head in the game.
this is the last job. I'm done after this.
agreed.
this isn't some smash-and-grab outfit.
these guys are looking to take out some high tech alarms.
Yeah, okay. I'll wait for you to get here.
Erica, come here.
stand in front of me, act like you're talking to me. Do it!
what do you want me to talk about? - Anything. Just do it.
Shea said he mentioned to you how it wouldn't hurt if we got a little conjugal time.
I just really think it would help clear everyone's head. I know it would mine.
damn, you are mungry. - I'm mamished.
take it up with Charlie. - I'd rather take it up with you.
I got him. - He made us.
Jules, put an alarm out on a black SUVheading up Eighth Av with limo tints.
I only got half the plate. Son of a bitch!
DOA was Douglas Acadia. No priors. Unmarried.
you cross match him with Andre?
Yes, and Kate Lavin. No connections.
contact Major Case Squad at NYPD. Have them send over the M. O. files on the Bad Elvises.
already did. Clerk I spoke with said they would sent it over as soon as they got approval from their sergeant.
call Bill Clark there, tell him that Ray Zancanelli saidto send it over already.
if Kate was a Bad Elvis, then maybe some of his other conjugalswere hooked up?
find out. I want to know everything about every womanwho went to go see him in prison.
fugitive Task Force.
may I ask who's calling?
uh, hold one second.
Charlie? - Yeah.
Andre Brennan for you.
what does his voice sound like?
cr me de menthe.
Andre Brennan. Good to meet you.
we'll meet in person soon. - I'd love that.
especially if it was to work out a deal.
what are you offering?
my cohorts. I'll assumeyou'll know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, minus a dead guy we found in the suite. How many does that leave?
three others.
not to sound too trite, but, uh, I'm ready for a change that doesn't involve incarceration, or being a fugitive.
okay. Where can we meet?
no, no, no, no. See, I'd need the deal up front.
I walk for my testimony. Witness Protection.
look, I'm notwith the D. A.'s Office. I catch fugitives, Andre, butonce you're in our custody,
I promise youI can introduce you to a very helpful...
I don't like hanging up on people abruptly, so I'm telling you right now that I'm hanging up.
some girls may find that act charming. I want to knock this guy's teeth out.
ndre's location, Jules. Have they started the back trace yet?
Yeah.
well, then, what's taking this long? They know the call was terminatedfrom your office line.
why can't they just isolate it?
it's not that easy, because there are several phone outlets in the office, and then they're rerouted through headquarters.
so what's the ETA that they gave you? - Minutes.
how many? - Five to ten.
but that was five minutes ago, so five.
already have one dead body on our hands. I'd prefer not to have another.
I am completely with you on that.
who are you on the line with, a tech or a supervisor?
cause if it's a tech, then I'm gonna want you to put me on the line with the ESU Chief Inspector himself.
Charlie, can you please relax? I can do my job.
you know, that Andre guy-- he's such smug bastard.
he thinks he's gonna call meat my office and run game on me?
I'll see what song he's singing when I slapthe bracelets on his ass.
okay. Thank you very much.
all right, he called from a pay phoneat Mercer and Grand.
okay. Have Lloyd meet me at the car.
Yeah, this guy's real slick. Calls us from a pay phone? Doesn't expect us to trace it? Come on, man.
Hey, can we get, like, traffic photosor some kind of satellite imagery? Some kind of technology?
just stick to head-shrinking, Lloyd.
leave the electronic surveillance to the ESU. - I'm must saying.
maybe he was picking up more cigars?
he wouldn't call us from a traceable phoneright outside of one of his hangouts.
he's not that stupid. Trust me.
Lloyd, when you, a known problem gambler, were finally apprehended, Yeah?
where did we find you? - A casino.
exactly. - All right.
Charlie: This is Andre's stash. The Bad Elvises communicate through cigar boxes.
we're looking for the box with the skunk cigars. Get to it.
not this one. It's silky smooth.
Oh, my God, yes, you are full-bodied.
and how about you?
no, you are way too earthy to be a dud, aren't you?
Yeah, you got, you got a bit of cedar in you, don't you, you little scamp?
Lloyd. - How about...
okay, Grandpa slippers right here.
friday at 9: 00.
three hours. We got three hours to figure this thing out. Do you recognize that?
it's modern expressionism.
the subject matter can range from celestial to bestialto excretional.
okay, I'm going to close my eyes and count to five.
maybe thatlovely cedar-smelling cigar fell on the ground, and you could find it and put it back in the box?
five. Wow. Look at that.
Yeah, it's weird.
let's go, convict.
it's an alligator eating a bird.
looks like floating puke to me.
all right, Jules, thanks. Yeah, as soon as they can.
she sent an image of the paintingover to the Major Case Squad.
they're trying to find somebody to I. D.
or we could hit up the gallery party scenein the meatpacking district. Someone might recognize it.
Yeah. Maybe Andre will be there, so you can throw yourself at him.
withdrawn. Here's what we need to do you guys, okay?
we need to just close our eyes like this and imaginewhat the picture could be, because Josef Albers, a very famous abstract painter
he said,"You only see truth through closed eyes. "I think he was right.
does anybody else have their eyes closed right now?
no.
there's one more of Andre's girls we should be talking to. Heather Storrow.
says here she visited Andre three times in prison, but didn't stay for the conjugal.
then why would she concern us?
all that schooling, and the Chairmanof Psychiatry doesn't know jack about women.
maybe all of these women are Bad Elvises, maybe none of them are, and maybeAndre and lovely little Heather were a couple on the outside.
okay, now I'm following you. The Madonna whore of it all.
wherein a man courts a woman with the qualitiesof his mother, hoping to fulfillunmet intimacy needs from childhood.
but then soon, that woman is viewed as a mother--a Madonna figure - and thus, is notsexually attractive.
Hey, Shell? Shelly, I feel like we ordered that pizza, like, 30 minutes ago. Thanks.
so this guy reserves his sexualityfor these dirty women, aka whores, and is thus in the quandary of not being ableto love a woman who satisfies him sexually, and not being able to sexually satisfy a woman who he loves.
roughly. - Been there.
okay, so then, boom, this Heather chick is his Madonna.
I mean, all the more reason he would spare her the humiliation of the latex glove treatmentfrom a state employee.
look, she lives, like, two minutes away. It's worth a shot.
Shea might be onto something. I'll call her in.
bring me up a couple of slices. - Yeah, I'll come with.
seriously. Interviews? Ten years experience. You? Zero.
what the hell, man. It was my idea. I'm just trying to help you out, brah.
I mean, you want me in the game, right, Charlie?
go.
Heather, right? - Yes.
ray Zancanelli.
you know what, man? You can go ahead and start. I'll just, um... I'll just listen in.
this way.
Oh, damn. I left the file downstairs. Be right back.
Oh, baby, you're so bad.
Shea Daniels, baby. - Oh, yeah!
Charlie: Do a search for famous shipwreck paintings.
it's called "Storm on the Sea" by MauroIacobelli.
it's a painting at the Geller Museum in Midtown. - Let's go.
35 seconds. Mark.
light sensors. Clear.
heat detectors disabled. Check the vault keypad.
got it.
I loved Andre beforeI knew he was... a criminal, I guess.
when he got arrested, my world got turned upside down.
so your visits to the prison...
was to make sure I didn't love him anymore.
he is not a bad man.
I mean, not paying your taxes doesn't make you a monster.
you're right. But what if I told you he was a suspect in a murder?
no. - I'm afraid so.
tapping into their system.
you're all set.
bar secure.
decoupling the magnets.
what the hell's going on? I had to take the stairs.
yo, the damn thing got stuck, man.
listen, there's two things I don't like, Charlie-- snakesand claustrophobic places.
Hey, man, get that joint fixed, man, or you got nothing coming from me.
Oh, I've got nothing coming? - Bismarck Jewelry Collection.
it arrived from Germany yesterday, and it's at the Geller Museum.
okay, I'll go get Ray. Get the others downstairs.
didn't even get a chance to get that file downstairs.
fly's open.
I miss my girl, okay?
I can't believe it.
that's not the man I know.
all I can say is, you're better off. This guy's bad news.
I know.
well, now I do, anyway.
ray, it's a wrap. We figured out the thing.
well, thank you for coming in.
you can let yourself out, but don't beat yourself up. You deserve better than that scumbag.
it's about the Bismarck Collection. - Put your guns away.
it's only the primary alarm. We've already confirmed there's been no security breach.
I'm telling you, the jewels.
I don't think so. Look.
security has been with it round the clock since it landed.
what the hell?
magnetic fields intact. We're good to go.
we're in.
we have a sophisticated alarm system.
it's obviously working well. All it took was the primary alarm to scare them off.
what really happened? - It was preprogrammed.
the alarm could have been set months ago.
all right, so let me get this straight. They set off the primary alarm system.
they do it on purpose, and they don't rob the place.
this entire thing was a diversion. Half the cops in Manhattan are distracted right now.
Jules, I want information on every alarmthat went off in the city tonight.
JULIANNE: Looking. Okay, Erickson Menswear in Little Tokyo.
abc Liquor on Bleecker Street.
high-end places, Jules.
here we go: Schulman and Sons Diamond Wholesalers. It's on 47th Street.
they got into everything. - How much did they get?
between nine and ten million. That's just from the vault.
for what I paid for that system, when it goes off, you should have been here in minutes.
whoever you were expecting, I'm guessing they were at the Geller.
Oh, I could care less about the Geller.
all right, pal, you said what you had to say-- we get it.
they targeted something else over here.
what's, uh... What's missing from this case?
a pearl necklace. Not worth much compared to the diamonds in there.
these guys are so bad-ass, they got more than they can carry.
leaving behind diamonds. Hell of a score, man. Hell of a score.
glad you're impressed.
who is this guy?
shall I reiterate my walking id theory?
Andre will not, in fact, be skipping town alone.
He'lbe taking a girl with himfor whom he can buy things and impress.
and in this case, one who likes pearls.
Oh, man. - What?
he's a murderer and a thief, and he's going to keep doing both because he's good at it.
you know something, Heather.
you're not the kind of personwho's going to let somebody like Andre get away.
are you?
he just called.
begging me to meet him and, um, run away together.
meet him where?
he's really a murderer?
crime scene photos are in the car-- what do you want to see?
the bullet hole in the guy's chest, or the exit wound by the shoulder blade?
no, no.
where is he?
he told me to meet him at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in a half hour and wait for him there.
there you go.
keep the pack.
they bought it. Great job.
Andre, this is craziness.
not for much longer. Were you followed?
no, I-I took a cab, and then the subway, and thenI walked around the block, like youaid.
sweetheart... that's the last time I'm gonna ask you to lie.
Andre, they said horrible things about you.
of course they did. Who are you gonna believe, me or them?
you. - Of course you are.
you ready?
for your faith in me, baby.
what now?
buenos Aires. You're gonna love it. It's like Paris.
we'll leave tomorrow. I just got to buy us a little time.
how are you, Charlie?
how do you think?
I want to take your offer. I'm done running.
good. Where are you?
I have to take care of a couple things first.
I'll meet you at the Viand coffee shop-- 61stand Park, tomorrow morning, 9:00 a. m.
this means a lot to me, Andre, so much so that I'm getting misty-eyedjust thinking about it.
do me a favor-- can you ask your girlfriend Heather if I could borrow a tissue from her purse?
tissues. Did they give you tissues?
I don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
what's up, Andre?
you got two seconds to lower the window.
I told you we'd meet again.
step out of the car for me.
this is what we call a bird dog-- a tracking device. Get out of the car.
put your hands on the hood.
take a seat.
see, what did I tell you girls?
you pull back the curtainjust a little bit, and the wizard--not so wizardly, right?
seriously, though, man, how do you do it with all the women?
he is so much better looking in his photos. Don't you think so, Jules?
Yeah, oh, yeah, better in the photos.
they'll be coming by to pick you up in a half hour, Andre.
they're not Cohibas.
the champagne's only ten bucks, but we know howto celebrate as much as the next guy.
bus terminal? Really, Andre, a guy like you? Not a guy like you.
that's where you blew it. Self-persistent-- what do you call it, Lloyd?
Oh, Persistent Ego Aggrandizing disorder.
Douchebag-itis, basically.
Cheers. - Cheers.
who's first?
Yeah.
may I come in? - Sure.
what's up?
I don't appreciate the situationthat I'm in because of you.
I am putting my job on the lineby not telling Charlie.
well, did he ask if you saw anything?
no, no, no, that's not-- that's not the point.
look, I know that everyone here kind of knowsabout my personal issues, and maybe because of that, you think that I'm some kind of pushover.
look, look, look, it ain't even like that.
listen, I just needed some time with my girl.
I've been locked up for a long time.
so have I.
after I washed out of the academy, I lived with my mom for three years, doing telemarketing.
I never left the house.
I thought that was going to bethe rest of my life until Ray called me for this job.
you want to get out of prison? So do I.
this is my chance to get my life back, as much as it is yours.
so do not mistake my illness for weakness.
and don't put me in that position again, because, if you do, I will tell Charlie.
I don't care who you are.
I can't wait six years.
look, maybe next time you're on work release...
there's another way.
but, baby, we'd be fugitives again.
we'd be together.
that's all that matters.
this is for you.
you know damn well who did this.
Yeah. Bummer. Now clean it up.
you just can't let those bastards do this to you.
Yeah, well, there's three of them and one of me.
Yeah, well, you go in hard, you surprise them, huh?
you could take these humps!
you make the first move, and once you do, you draw 'em in, I use this.
you really gonna back me up?
you'd do the same for me, huh?
last call for...
last call for...
the commissary will be closing in ten minutes.
I got your back.
lock it down! Lock it down!
backup! Someone call for backup!
lock it down! Lock it down!
you bastard!
let's go, let's go.
Snitch" is with a "T," by the way.
convicts, on the ground! Hands in the air!
convicts, on the ground! Hands in the air!
if that door ain't open in two seconds, you're on your own.
let's go. Let's go.
you sure you brought everything?
come on. Move your ass!
this... this better hold.
baby, I am so proud of you.
helping out the U. S. Marshals, not in a million years did I think...
Hey, you're getting out early because of it. That's all I care about.
no, you're right. You're right.
so, the people you're working with, they're nice?
I guess they're all right, for cops.
and the other informants?
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't no informant.
baby, I didn't mean it like that.
I haven't given them dick on anyone I used to run with.
they just bounce stuff off me, that's all.
Shea, you're the same man that I've always known. Nothing has changed.
if anything, I love you more now, because you're doing what's right by us.
baby, when we're together again, we're gonna be free and clear-- no more running. We can't go back to that.
Hey, you smell good.
I wish we could be alone.
you don't even want to know what you go throughto get into one of them conjugal trailers.
no way I'm having any C. O. take a rubber glove to you.
Daniels, no excessive contact! Daniels!
I want you, baby.
let me figure something out.
my man.
Daniels, transpo van is here.
Andre Brennan. Escaped while his cellie basically started a riot.
started it as a distraction?
we'll never know. His cellie's dead.
how'd he escape?
they don't know. Warden's doing an investigation.
well, he was in for tax evasion, but has been a suspected associate of the Bad Elvises.
anyone?
a ring of international jewelry thieves. Never caught.
correct.
they're known for sophisticated methods, advanced materials, coded communications, and they are violent.
jewelry store in Brussels two years ago-- heist gone wrong.
security guards never stood a chance.
Interpol never pinned it on him, but we know he was the mastermind.
wait, can we go back? Bad Elvises
could they do no better for a name?
they were given the nameby the press after a heist where they all wore ridiculous pompadour wigs.
that's no excuse.
now Breakout Kings, that's a name that got ring to it.
breakout Kings"? Is that what they're calling us?
I love it.
we're not called Breakout Kings. - Why not?
cause we're not breaking out of anything.
you know what? Don't worry about it.
Hello, blue eyes. Come to mama.
he's got a Park Avenue address, a boat, a Bentley Flyer! Whoa!
he was living the high life.
must've been thieving for a long timebefore they caught him.
you guys want alone time with the files orare you ready to do some work?
I don't know, Ray. Have you seen the folderon this guy's conjugal visitors? It's amazing.
Shea, would I be correct, in referringto this gentleman as a playa with mad game, yo?
Yeah, back in the '80s.
check this out. This just came from the warden's office.
a tip of a copied keyfound inside the lock in the visitors' area.
what the hell's that made out of?
plastic. Melted-down toothbrush, most likely.
he got that copy from somebody.
I'd be talking to trustees and guards, see who knew him.
take a trip to the prison.
Charlie. - Yeah.
uh, think we could talkabout me getting some alone time with my girl?
anything else you need? Candlelight, bubble bath?
come on, man, I'm just looking for a little time.
you are getting time, Shea. Time off your sentence.
other than that, you get nothing. Do your job.
Jules, on our way there, run every trustee. I want to see anybody that's had contact with him.
also pull his visitation log. Andre's up to something. I want to know what.
that's some bad luck, huh?
the key breaks off in the lock, we would've never looked into you.
lots of trustees like me are around keys, boss.
hate to break it to you, but you're gonna have to keep looking.
how many trustees have wivesthat make nine dollars an hour folding laundry and go out and a brand-new Escalade, cash?
she got taken onthe upholstery and leather insurance.
you never get that.
I told her two days ago to siton the money for a year, and she goes outand buys an Escalade?
now, Fuente, why don't you just tell us everything you know.
then we won't have to go after your wifefor aiding and abetting, and as a conspirator in the escape.
I'll kill her. I'm seriously gonna kill her.
now!
Andre gave me 25 grand to make a copy of a key.
come on. The rig cost more than 25K.
I told Andre I needed another week, and he just about blew a gasket.
he said he needed to be out by this morning, and he'd double my price.
why the hurry?
I don't know. His wheels were always turning, you know?
where is he headed? Where is he going?
probably female-related.
you should have sawsome of the tomatoes that were coming to visit him.
it was like a Victoria's Secret catalog. I mean, I'd say,"Andre, who's that knockout?
I don't know how he did it.
he is well-endowed. I guarantee it.
JULIANNE: How can you tell?
I mean, I-I don't, I don't care. It's just, you know, you said that... Ray. Yes! I'm here.
he's confident, yet calm.
he doesn't need to resort to all the nonsenseguys do that need to compensate.
he knows what he's got. Look at that expression. It's, like,"Whatever.
I don't need to make a big deal out of it. You know why?
because I'm packing.
it's a sub symptom of immediate gratification where in Andre gets high from vicious cycles of spending.
and he spends 'cause he's a walking id, and he steals 'cause he can't not spend.
he's incapable of laying low, which is good news for us.
um, there is a dead man on the floor.
I bet Andre killed him. - No shit.
ray, I'm gonna need you and Erica to go check out a car.
these are safecracking tools. Andre and his boys are planning a job-- soon.
Kate: This is great. We should just tie some tin cans onto the bumper and bring a little more attention to ourselves.
what do they know, hmm? That we're planning to do a job?
it's a big city, Kate. We're fine.
anyone want to bail, now's the time to do so, but your cut will beexactly zero percent, which I'll assumewould be my share had I not returned.
you kidding? I've been waiting my whole lifefor a score this big.
what's her name? - You don't know her.
let me guess.
she's young and pretty and naive, and believes everything you tell her.
I'm sorry, Kate. I thought I'd said it enough times, but apparently I haven't:
get your damn head in the game.
this is the last job. I'm done after this.
agreed.
this isn't some smash-and-grab outfit.
these guys are looking to take out some high tech alarms.
Yeah, okay. I'll wait for you to get here.
Erica, come here.
stand in front of me, act like you're talking to me. Do it!
what do you want me to talk about? - Anything. Just do it.
Shea said he mentioned to you how it wouldn't hurt if we got a little conjugal time.
I just really think it would help clear everyone's head. I know it would mine.
damn, you are mungry. - I'm mamished.
take it up with Charlie. - I'd rather take it up with you.
I got him. - He made us.
Jules, put an alarm out on a black SUVheading up Eighth Av with limo tints.
I only got half the plate. Son of a bitch!
DOA was Douglas Acadia. No priors. Unmarried.
you cross match him with Andre?
Yes, and Kate Lavin. No connections.
contact Major Case Squad at NYPD. Have them send over the M. O. files on the Bad Elvises.
already did. Clerk I spoke with said they would sent it over as soon as they got approval from their sergeant.
call Bill Clark there, tell him that Ray Zancanelli saidto send it over already.
if Kate was a Bad Elvis, then maybe some of his other conjugalswere hooked up?
find out. I want to know everything about every womanwho went to go see him in prison.
fugitive Task Force.
may I ask who's calling?
uh, hold one second.
Charlie? - Yeah.
Andre Brennan for you.
what does his voice sound like?
cr me de menthe.
Andre Brennan. Good to meet you.
we'll meet in person soon. - I'd love that.
especially if it was to work out a deal.
what are you offering?
my cohorts. I'll assumeyou'll know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, minus a dead guy we found in the suite. How many does that leave?
three others.
not to sound too trite, but, uh, I'm ready for a change that doesn't involve incarceration, or being a fugitive.
okay. Where can we meet?
no, no, no, no. See, I'd need the deal up front.
I walk for my testimony. Witness Protection.
look, I'm notwith the D. A.'s Office. I catch fugitives, Andre, butonce you're in our custody,
I promise youI can introduce you to a very helpful...
I don't like hanging up on people abruptly, so I'm telling you right now that I'm hanging up.
some girls may find that act charming. I want to knock this guy's teeth out.
ndre's location, Jules. Have they started the back trace yet?
Yeah.
well, then, what's taking this long? They know the call was terminatedfrom your office line.
why can't they just isolate it?
it's not that easy, because there are several phone outlets in the office, and then they're rerouted through headquarters.
so what's the ETA that they gave you? - Minutes.
how many? - Five to ten.
but that was five minutes ago, so five.
already have one dead body on our hands. I'd prefer not to have another.
I am completely with you on that.
who are you on the line with, a tech or a supervisor?
cause if it's a tech, then I'm gonna want you to put me on the line with the ESU Chief Inspector himself.
Charlie, can you please relax? I can do my job.
you know, that Andre guy-- he's such smug bastard.
he thinks he's gonna call meat my office and run game on me?
I'll see what song he's singing when I slapthe bracelets on his ass.
okay. Thank you very much.
all right, he called from a pay phoneat Mercer and Grand.
okay. Have Lloyd meet me at the car.
Yeah, this guy's real slick. Calls us from a pay phone? Doesn't expect us to trace it? Come on, man.
Hey, can we get, like, traffic photosor some kind of satellite imagery? Some kind of technology?
just stick to head-shrinking, Lloyd.
leave the electronic surveillance to the ESU. - I'm must saying.
maybe he was picking up more cigars?
he wouldn't call us from a traceable phoneright outside of one of his hangouts.
he's not that stupid. Trust me.
Lloyd, when you, a known problem gambler, were finally apprehended, Yeah?
where did we find you? - A casino.
exactly. - All right.
Charlie: This is Andre's stash. The Bad Elvises communicate through cigar boxes.
we're looking for the box with the skunk cigars. Get to it.
not this one. It's silky smooth.
Oh, my God, yes, you are full-bodied.
and how about you?
no, you are way too earthy to be a dud, aren't you?
Yeah, you got, you got a bit of cedar in you, don't you, you little scamp?
Lloyd. - How about...
okay, Grandpa slippers right here.
friday at 9: 00.
three hours. We got three hours to figure this thing out. Do you recognize that?
it's modern expressionism.
the subject matter can range from celestial to bestialto excretional.
okay, I'm going to close my eyes and count to five.
maybe thatlovely cedar-smelling cigar fell on the ground, and you could find it and put it back in the box?
five. Wow. Look at that.
Yeah, it's weird.
let's go, convict.
it's an alligator eating a bird.
looks like floating puke to me.
all right, Jules, thanks. Yeah, as soon as they can.
she sent an image of the paintingover to the Major Case Squad.
they're trying to find somebody to I. D.
or we could hit up the gallery party scenein the meatpacking district. Someone might recognize it.
Yeah. Maybe Andre will be there, so you can throw yourself at him.
withdrawn. Here's what we need to do you guys, okay?
we need to just close our eyes like this and imaginewhat the picture could be, because Josef Albers, a very famous abstract painter
he said,"You only see truth through closed eyes. "I think he was right.
does anybody else have their eyes closed right now?
no.
there's one more of Andre's girls we should be talking to. Heather Storrow.
says here she visited Andre three times in prison, but didn't stay for the conjugal.
then why would she concern us?
all that schooling, and the Chairmanof Psychiatry doesn't know jack about women.
maybe all of these women are Bad Elvises, maybe none of them are, and maybeAndre and lovely little Heather were a couple on the outside.
okay, now I'm following you. The Madonna whore of it all.
wherein a man courts a woman with the qualitiesof his mother, hoping to fulfillunmet intimacy needs from childhood.
but then soon, that woman is viewed as a mother--a Madonna figure - and thus, is notsexually attractive.
Hey, Shell? Shelly, I feel like we ordered that pizza, like, 30 minutes ago. Thanks.
so this guy reserves his sexualityfor these dirty women, aka whores, and is thus in the quandary of not being ableto love a woman who satisfies him sexually, and not being able to sexually satisfy a woman who he loves.
roughly. - Been there.
okay, so then, boom, this Heather chick is his Madonna.
I mean, all the more reason he would spare her the humiliation of the latex glove treatmentfrom a state employee.
look, she lives, like, two minutes away. It's worth a shot.
Shea might be onto something. I'll call her in.
bring me up a couple of slices. - Yeah, I'll come with.
seriously. Interviews? Ten years experience. You? Zero.
what the hell, man. It was my idea. I'm just trying to help you out, brah.
I mean, you want me in the game, right, Charlie?
go.
Heather, right? - Yes.
ray Zancanelli.
you know what, man? You can go ahead and start. I'll just, um... I'll just listen in.
this way.
Oh, damn. I left the file downstairs. Be right back.
Oh, baby, you're so bad.
Shea Daniels, baby. - Oh, yeah!
Charlie: Do a search for famous shipwreck paintings.
it's called "Storm on the Sea" by MauroIacobelli.
it's a painting at the Geller Museum in Midtown. - Let's go.
35 seconds. Mark.
light sensors. Clear.
heat detectors disabled. Check the vault keypad.
got it.
I loved Andre beforeI knew he was... a criminal, I guess.
when he got arrested, my world got turned upside down.
so your visits to the prison...
was to make sure I didn't love him anymore.
he is not a bad man.
I mean, not paying your taxes doesn't make you a monster.
you're right. But what if I told you he was a suspect in a murder?
no. - I'm afraid so.
tapping into their system.
you're all set.
bar secure.
decoupling the magnets.
what the hell's going on? I had to take the stairs.
yo, the damn thing got stuck, man.
listen, there's two things I don't like, Charlie-- snakesand claustrophobic places.
Hey, man, get that joint fixed, man, or you got nothing coming from me.
Oh, I've got nothing coming? - Bismarck Jewelry Collection.
it arrived from Germany yesterday, and it's at the Geller Museum.
okay, I'll go get Ray. Get the others downstairs.
didn't even get a chance to get that file downstairs.
fly's open.
I miss my girl, okay?
I can't believe it.
that's not the man I know.
all I can say is, you're better off. This guy's bad news.
I know.
well, now I do, anyway.
ray, it's a wrap. We figured out the thing.
well, thank you for coming in.
you can let yourself out, but don't beat yourself up. You deserve better than that scumbag.
it's about the Bismarck Collection. - Put your guns away.
it's only the primary alarm. We've already confirmed there's been no security breach.
I'm telling you, the jewels.
I don't think so. Look.
security has been with it round the clock since it landed.
what the hell?
magnetic fields intact. We're good to go.
we're in.
we have a sophisticated alarm system.
it's obviously working well. All it took was the primary alarm to scare them off.
what really happened? - It was preprogrammed.
the alarm could have been set months ago.
all right, so let me get this straight. They set off the primary alarm system.
they do it on purpose, and they don't rob the place.
this entire thing was a diversion. Half the cops in Manhattan are distracted right now.
Jules, I want information on every alarmthat went off in the city tonight.
JULIANNE: Looking. Okay, Erickson Menswear in Little Tokyo.
abc Liquor on Bleecker Street.
high-end places, Jules.
here we go: Schulman and Sons Diamond Wholesalers. It's on 47th Street.
they got into everything. - How much did they get?
between nine and ten million. That's just from the vault.
for what I paid for that system, when it goes off, you should have been here in minutes.
whoever you were expecting, I'm guessing they were at the Geller.
Oh, I could care less about the Geller.
all right, pal, you said what you had to say-- we get it.
they targeted something else over here.
what's, uh... What's missing from this case?
a pearl necklace. Not worth much compared to the diamonds in there.
these guys are so bad-ass, they got more than they can carry.
leaving behind diamonds. Hell of a score, man. Hell of a score.
glad you're impressed.
who is this guy?
shall I reiterate my walking id theory?
Andre will not, in fact, be skipping town alone.
He'lbe taking a girl with himfor whom he can buy things and impress.
and in this case, one who likes pearls.
Oh, man. - What?
he's a murderer and a thief, and he's going to keep doing both because he's good at it.
you know something, Heather.
you're not the kind of personwho's going to let somebody like Andre get away.
are you?
he just called.
begging me to meet him and, um, run away together.
meet him where?
he's really a murderer?
crime scene photos are in the car-- what do you want to see?
the bullet hole in the guy's chest, or the exit wound by the shoulder blade?
no, no.
where is he?
he told me to meet him at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in a half hour and wait for him there.
there you go.
keep the pack.
they bought it. Great job.
Andre, this is craziness.
not for much longer. Were you followed?
no, I-I took a cab, and then the subway, and thenI walked around the block, like youaid.
sweetheart... that's the last time I'm gonna ask you to lie.
Andre, they said horrible things about you.
of course they did. Who are you gonna believe, me or them?
you. - Of course you are.
you ready?
for your faith in me, baby.
what now?
buenos Aires. You're gonna love it. It's like Paris.
we'll leave tomorrow. I just got to buy us a little time.
how are you, Charlie?
how do you think?
I want to take your offer. I'm done running.
good. Where are you?
I have to take care of a couple things first.
I'll meet you at the Viand coffee shop-- 61stand Park, tomorrow morning, 9:00 a. m.
this means a lot to me, Andre, so much so that I'm getting misty-eyedjust thinking about it.
do me a favor-- can you ask your girlfriend Heather if I could borrow a tissue from her purse?
tissues. Did they give you tissues?
I don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
what's up, Andre?
you got two seconds to lower the window.
I told you we'd meet again.
step out of the car for me.
this is what we call a bird dog-- a tracking device. Get out of the car.
put your hands on the hood.
take a seat.
see, what did I tell you girls?
you pull back the curtainjust a little bit, and the wizard--not so wizardly, right?
seriously, though, man, how do you do it with all the women?
he is so much better looking in his photos. Don't you think so, Jules?
Yeah, oh, yeah, better in the photos.
they'll be coming by to pick you up in a half hour, Andre.
they're not Cohibas.
the champagne's only ten bucks, but we know howto celebrate as much as the next guy.
bus terminal? Really, Andre, a guy like you? Not a guy like you.
that's where you blew it. Self-persistent-- what do you call it, Lloyd?
Oh, Persistent Ego Aggrandizing disorder.
Douchebag-itis, basically.
Cheers. - Cheers.
who's first?
Yeah.
may I come in? - Sure.
what's up?
I don't appreciate the situationthat I'm in because of you.
I am putting my job on the lineby not telling Charlie.
well, did he ask if you saw anything?
no, no, no, that's not-- that's not the point.
look, I know that everyone here kind of knowsabout my personal issues, and maybe because of that, you think that I'm some kind of pushover.
look, look, look, it ain't even like that.
listen, I just needed some time with my girl.
I've been locked up for a long time.
so have I.
after I washed out of the academy, I lived with my mom for three years, doing telemarketing.
I never left the house.
I thought that was going to bethe rest of my life until Ray called me for this job.
you want to get out of prison? So do I.
this is my chance to get my life back, as much as it is yours.
so do not mistake my illness for weakness.
and don't put me in that position again, because, if you do, I will tell Charlie.
I don't care who you are.
I can't wait six years.
look, maybe next time you're on work release...
there's another way.
but, baby, we'd be fugitives again.
we'd be together.
that's all that matters.
this is for you.
Bedford
the whole purpose of a journal is to get you to put your thoughts into words.
I don't expect Emily Dickinson.
Emily Dick-in-who?
I don't care how well you write, just that you write something.
it's the only way you're going to get a positive evaluation out of me.
bet it's not the only way, Claire.
Emmy, please.
what's up, no cleavage?
those hacks make you put that stuff on lockdown before you came through the gate?
come on, just pop a few buttons, girl. Give us a peek at them handfuls.
you do have a flair for colorful language, Emmy.
maybe if you applied yourself, you might have sold a novel for a million dollars instead of BJs for 20 bucks.
I'll extend the deadline until next week, but bonus points if you turn your journals in today.
put it right there.
guard, help me!
guard! Guard, help! Help, help!
code gray, classroom three.
two, 20 years wasn't enough for you, huh, Emmy?
you had to tack on an assault charge?
Hey, you think that teacher will be there today?
try to rip her blouse off at the arraignment, see how far you get.
come on, Cait, give a guy a heads-up.
yo, don't try to pin that on me.
you okay back there? - I need a bathroom real bad.
and there's one at the courthouse, hon.
come on. What about that gas station up the street?
this isn't a family road trip. Pucker.
I don't think I'm gonna make it.
sorry.
Oh, man! That bitch just filled her drawers!
Oh, you pig!
let's go! Come on! Let's go!
out, out, out of my van!
clear.
all right, you're on your own.
but we'll be right outside... hosing out the van, you disgusting pig.
who's gonna wipe me, boss?
what? Oh, man!
you're wiping your own damn self.
Lord, have mercy! Whoo!
Damn! Wash up good.
what are you hiding? Let's have it.
who you calling pig, bitch?
Brooklyn,
meet Emmy Sharp, a true product of the system.
went straight from foster care to turning tricks at the age of 16.
but Emmy apparently got tired of being taken advantage of by her pimp, so she organized the other girls and tried to cut him out.
I can't imagine that ended well.
well, he beat her up pretty good, but she's a stubborn one.
she waited for him to fall asleep, she doused him with gas and lit a match.
that bought her 20 years.
I guess she didn't want to wait that long, or we wouldn't be here.
wait till you hear how she escaped. Go ahead. Tell 'em, Jules.
why me? - Because it grosses me out.
okay.
Emmy attacked a volunteer teacher in prison, and then used her arraignment as an opportunity... to escape.
and according to her cellie, she hoarded 30 packs of pistachios.
that's at least a pound.
I could eat a pound of pistachios.
all at once? 'Cause that's what she did 30 minutes before she went in the van.
the thing is, according to her medical jacket, she's mildly allergic to pistachios.
Oh, my goodness. - You know what that means?
Yeah. - Then you can tell everybody else what happened.
pistachios are a natural laxative, especially if you're allergic to them, so, if she ate that many, within 30 minutes, she would need to take a potty break.
and I'm talking an emergency potty break, okay?
I'm talking evacuate the villagers 'cause we have have a Chilean mudslide.
all right, we get it. The point is, transpo van had to pull over, uncuff her so she could get clean.
that teacher she attacked, could Emmy be going after her?
police units have checked in with the teacher, but it doesn't look like the attack was personal.
Emmy just needed somebody to press charges so she could get out for an arraignment.
this girl's clever and violent, and she doesn't care who she has to hurt to get her way.
where did she get the screwdriver?
she used it to unscrew the security screen so she could get out the back window unseen.
this isn't, this isn't a flathead or a Phillips.
this a Torx driver. They're actually pretty uncommon.
how did she know she'd need this to remove that reen?
same way she knew where to find the one toilet on the 20-mile ride to the courthouse.
someone cased it beforehand, knew kind of tool she needed, and hid it there for her. She's got outside help.
okay. Let's comb through her visitor logs, phone records, everything.
let's find out who's working with this fecal freak.
thought I told you to change.
I - I... I'm gonna do that.
can I talk to y'all for a second?
are you one of the millions of people who suffer from dry, ashy elbows?
well, you are not alone.
my name is Sean Daniels and I am pleased to announce that I have discovered the solution for the ashy elbow problem.
ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
this ought to be good.
I give you...
elbow Savers.
soft, fitted cups that cradles your elbow with moisturizer and eliminates the ash while you sleep.
are you having a stroke?
it straps on like this so it doesn't rub off on your sheets.
from ashy to classy, baby.
elbow Savers. The patent's pending, of course.
so what y'all, what y'all think about that? You feeling that?
I mean, I'm thinking about moisturizing it with, like, shea butter.
it's a play on my name,"shea" butter.
but I really think, it's gonna, you know, take me to Fat Pocket City once I'm out of prison.
Lloyd, get out here. You just got a postcard from Damien.
I got a postcard from the psychopath that killed Charlie?
where is it? I want to see it.
you guys just focus on the case that we were assigned. You come with me.
Dr. Lowery, I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
this is a prank, right? This came from one of his fans.
or it came from Damien himself.
I have three others just like it that all tested positive for his fingerprints and DNA.
there's no postmarks.
it's 'cause he using an anonymous mailing service.
I can't believe Damien Fontleroy sent me three postcards and you didn't tell me.
the first three weren't addressed to you. He's just trying to rile us up.
besides, I gotta keep you guys focused on other runners. - You should've told me.
Lowery, if this team isn't effective, you go back to maximum security.
is that what you want?
now, I'm telling you about this one because this one doesn't seem like an idle threat.
it's different from the others.
why is he quoting Bill Clinton?
how should I know?
because you understand him better than anyone else, including the guys on the task force that are hunting him.
well, Ray, it's been a while. And he's had time to lay low and regroup, so...
I mean, if he's not killing already, he will be soon.
okay, so, Emmy only had one repeat visitor, and it was a fellow escort that testified at her trial.
Jules is getting the address now. Can I see the postcard?
you try to figure out what he's telling us. Erica, you come with me.
what, are you trying out for Roller Derby? Get changed already.
Queens
if Emmy's hiding out here, she's not exactly keeping a low profile.
see if it's open.
all right, open it up.
u. S. Marshal!
live here?
u. S. Marshals. You know a Kimberley Manning? - No.
Kimberly Manning, aka Ashlee?
Ashlee. Sure.
this is not what it looks like.
no money changed hands here.
I'm really not the kind of guy... I mean, I don't need to...
all right, then go. - Yeah.
learned Hand. Well, that's the worst band name ever.
come on. Now! Let's go. Get out of here. Beat it.
Yeah.
boy, you don't tire easy, do you?
learned Hand just took a walk. You Ashlee?
get a robe on.
you telling me you saw Emmy three times in the last eight weeks, and you know nothing about a plan of escaping?
honest, she never said a thing about it.
okay, then what did you guys talk about?
everything. We were best friends.
you know, it's not right what happened to her.
rooster beat the piss out of Emmy. What she did to him was just self-defense.
rooster was her pimp. - Really? Not her mortgage broker?
okay, killing a man in his sleep isn't exactly self-defense, and what she did to that guard was flat-out murder.
if you had anything to do with her escape, that makes you an accessory.
if you weren't involved, prove it. Tell us where she is.
I don't know.
okay, look, you're her best friend.
she didn't tell you ever she wanted to go somewhere special?
florida, Europe, Legoland?
girls like us- we don't make too many long-term plans, you know?
how about short-term ones?
what's the first place she wanted to go when she got out?
I don't know! - Sit down!
I don't know, probably slash the tires of the guy who ratted on her.
and who is that? - A john.
a regular she trusted a little too much. She told him about killing Rooster.
two hours later the cops arrested her.
okay, look, we need to find this guy. Emmy isn't the type that just slashes tires, you know.
who is he? You got a name?
all right, Jules, track down the homicide cops who arrested Emmy.
we need to find their source. This guy is in trouble.
stam
all right, have a good day today.
Lloyd, maybe Damien quoted Clinton 'cause he's hiding out in Little Rock, Arkansas.
or maybe you should go figure out why your Elbow Savers launch tanked so badly and let me think, please, Shea.
Jules, I need you to double-check the address for Emmy's regular.
there is no 307 Meadows Road.
ray, I-I didn't say 307 Meadows Road.
uh, Christopher Chaplin lives at 307 Meadows Terrace.
Jules, I got Meadows Circle, not Terrace.
this has got to be it.
Jules, you been able to get this guy on the phone yet?
Nope, still going to voice mail.
christopher Chaplin? - Yeah.
ray Zancanelli. - What can I do for you?
you know a prostitute named Emmy Sharp?
uh, honey, one second, I'll take care of this, okay?
geez. How about a little discretion, huh?
so you haven't had any trouble tonight?
I will now.
is it done?
baby, it's only getting started.
Darien,
victim's name is Sean Lyons.
42, local businessman.
shot once in the head with a 38-caliber sometime last night.
killed him in the kitchen, dragged his body into the garage.
probably wouldn't have been missed for a while, except his buddy stopped by at dawn to borrow a golf club.
ended up having his whole game ruined instead.
Where's Mrs. Lyons? - Still trying to figure that out.
I've shown you mine...
we're chasing a runner who assaulted Claire Lyons.
I'm guessing she's involved in your murder. Name's Emmy Sharp, just booked out of Bedford Hills.
the chick that messed her drawers? - Yep.
well, that makes more sense than my current suspect.
works in the guardhouse.
he was on duty late last night, so we woke him up to find out if he saw anything, and he starts acting all squirrely.
one of my guys matched his shoe to a print we found in the flower bed, and he clams right up.
won't say another word until he gets a lawyer.
all right, I'll call you back.
was Jules able to track Claire's phone?
no, she says the phone is still in the house. We're giving it a call now.
trash is vibrating.
she threw it away.
along with... her IDs, credit cards...
anything else in there?
Yeah. Her wedding ring.
so Old Hickory Bourbon's a defunct brand. It used to be distilled in Philadelphia.
so is Damien in Philly? I mean, that just seems too simple.
is that the rent-a-cop's footprint?
what was he doing there? The window's not jimmied.
stay on that postcard, Doc. I got this.
I see what happened here.
uh, gentlemen, if you'll take a closer look back there, you'll see that this gentleman left you a DNA sample in the shrubbery, because he stood at that window last night, pleasuring himself with his right hand. Right?
this is the masturbation expert. Let's hear it.
a motion alarm went off in the booth.
usually that means there's a raccoon in the perimeter.
I went back there to check it out.
while I'm back there, I glance through the window...
and there's these two hot women making out!
I'm gonna get fired for peeping. - Well, beats fighting a murder charge, Spanky.
let's take a ride. - Yes, sir.
so Emmy and Claire were K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
okay. Claire supplied the screwdriver Emmy used to escape.
they're working together. - Ya think?
the absentminded professor over here put it together already.
wait, aren't you supposed to be figuring out why Damien is referencing the Clinton scandal?
I'm trying, but I don't really remember much from that long national nightmare.
man, how could you forget about that? That was on the news 24/7.
I'm sorry, Shea, uh... maybe I was a little busy back in, what, 1998?
I was fresh out of school, baby, I was just starting to make my mark...
interviewing criminals like Damien Fontleroy. Son of a biscuit.
...work your magic on it.
Hey, Jules, could you contact Dr. Adam Sills and get any video archives he might have from the interviews I did for the government study in the winter of 1998, please?
I'm on it. - Thanks, Jules.
did Sean keep the keys in the office or the booth?
uh, the booth, I think.
well, this is long-term parking, right?
we're gonna need a car that no one's gonna miss for a while.
Yeah. This is long-term.
I got one last question:
does Sean bang an employee from most of his parking garages, or just this skank?
Ooh, I've always wanted to drive a Mercedes. Go!
I'm gonna need that back.
Where's Ray?
look, Erica, I ain't saying you got dry, ashy elbows, but you gotta know somebody else who has some. We all do.
elbow Savers could be a thoughtful, inexpensive gift.
so how much would you pay for something like that?
Where's Ray?
Hey. Sean's cell.
filled with some pretty racy texts and photos sent back and forth to a few different women.
Whoo! Hound dog. - Neighbors say Claire and Sean had a horrible marriage.
never took her on the honeymoon that he promised six years ago.
always put work first. - Yeah,"work.
well, no wonder Claire turned to a woman for companionship.
she's a dutiful wife- ostensibly heterosexual
trapped in a frigid and deceitful relationship for years, until she's convinced to try switch-hitting by a professional whose own flexible sexuality is in itself probably just a grab bag of predilections.
or she could be a LURD.
lesbian Until Release Date?
it's, uh, where a convict resorts to being homosexual on the inside, and then switches as soon as she gets out.
are you saying Emmy's gonna turn straight? - Or Claire.
she wasn't incarcerated, but her marriage seemed like a prison.
I mean, it turned her gay, and now that she's been released from this bad relationship...
I've been looking through Sean's bank statements.
few grand in a couple of accounts, but my guess is, he's hiding the real money somewhere else.
all right, Jules, there are a couple of banks still open.
has Claire tried to access any joint accounts? - Doesn't look like it.
see, parking garages are cash-heavy businesses.
and this guy's shadier than an oak tree.
he's been audited twice by the IRS, but they didn't find dick.
homeboy's stacking chips somewhere.
you know, the proverbial coffee can in the backyard?
I bet you Claire figured out where he buried it.
okay. B45, 46. B47. Here it is.
all right. All right. Where's the other key?
what other key? - For the other lock.
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
I - I went in Sean's workbench, I grabbed the key that said "storage unit.
damn it, girl!
it never even occurred to me that there was gonna be a second key.
they're going to catch us now, aren't they?
Claire! We came up with a good plan, all right? And I believe in it.
I chalked up another body on my scorecard because I believe in it.
I believe in us.
me and you, through and through.
no lock is gonna stand in the way between you, and me and Montana.
you really think Sean's gonna keep a pile of cash in a cheap storage unit instead of a safe-deposit box?
I don't know. All I know is, the man's been audited twice.
he ain't keeping all that guap in a bank, I don't care how discreet they say they are.
sorry. You guys looking to rent a unit?
ray Zancanelli, U.S. Marshals.
a man named Sean Lyons has monthly charges to this facility on his credit card.
I need to know if he's keeping a storage unit here.
I don't know if I'm allowed to share that kind of confidential information...
well, you're gonna... - What the hell?
open that gate. Come on. Come on. Open the gate.
stay in your office.
do I leave the car here, or what?
okay, okay. Right is go, left is no.
and... poop, ow. Okay... This is touchy.
okay.
Oh, my God. - Okay.
take it!
go back! - Hold on.
ten and two! Ten and two, baby!
hand over hand.
ten and two.
this is why you don't have a driver's license.
first time with two lesbians didn't go exactly how I planned.
look, I already told you, it's a black Mercedes C-class.
09 maybe. The front end is all smashed in.
just, you got to tighten your noose. They can't have gotten far.
how did you not see the spikes?
cause I don't have x - ray vision, Ray, okay? I can't see through cars.
how far out is your air support? - Curb tore right through their oil pan.
my boss is gonna kill me! Who's gonna pay for all this?
you're kidding me.
they found the car abandoned five miles away. - With a seized engine, no doubt.
buddy, look, I hope you're... - Sir, are you kidding me?! Go back inside!
well, Thelma and Louise either hitched a ride or they stole another car.
I mean, these broads are nuts.
th-they're shooting out padlocks, they're busting through fences.
well, that's oxytocin in action. It's the cuddle hormone, okay?
it's a neuropeptide released by the hypothalamus during sexual stimulation.
women have five times more of it than men do, so basically we're dealing with a pair of huge over-stimulized brains.
well, the bag they took looked heavy.
they got away with about 30 pounds of something.
let's hope it's not pistachios. - Ray?
what do you got, Jules? - Tell Lloyd his tapes are here. The Damien interviews.
keep your head in line!
great, tighten up!
great job! Great, tighten up! Make sure you spot!
back in line.
make sure you spot, Bo. Try again.
good job, tighten up! Point!
point the toes! Squeeze! Keep your head in line!
in seventh grade, we had our first school dance.
I made out with Barbara Blakeman.
she let me cut off a piece of her hair, and it excited me.
what did you do with her hair, Damien?
I took it home and masturbated with it.
it gave me a sense of control.
what are we looking for?
this is the interview tape from January 26, 1998.
now, that's the day Clinton publicly denied any shenanigans with Blue Dress McOnherknees.
I can't watch this dude.
we're just getting to the heart of the fragmentation though, Shea.
he's about to reveal his splinter psyche.
that's the point where his infantile ego regressed and his false self emerged.
I would look at it over and over again.
think about...
keeping her with me for as long as possible.
even if it was just keeping a part of her.
eventually, just a part of her wasn't enough.
did your parents ever notice any of this abnormal behavior?
what makes you think my parents would have any idea about what's normal?
God, I was good. - I mean, my father had an excuse: he's a visionary.
but my mother...
my mother...
she's the mad scientist who made me.
okay. January 26, 1998.
this is the day Damien first starts talking about his mother, the person he's convinced is the source of all of his...
shall we say complicated feelings towards women.
he blames all of his troubles on her.
so...
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
that could be an oedipal reference or...
...or, if Damien Fontleroy is changing his M. O. he could be going after his mother.
all right, Jules, tell HQ we need to put Damien's mother in protective custody and we need to keep it quiet.
on it.
good job.
dude could be talking about your mom, Lloyd.
come on, pick up. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone, pick up the phone...
Oh, you're there? Sorry. Hey, Mother, are you okay?
I'm sure you would be better if I'd call more often, but I'm calling you right now...
Yes, I am flossing, I promise you.
but listen to me, I have something very important...
the task force has been staking out Damien's mother for weeks.
okay, it's-it's very important.
have you seen anything unusual in the past few days?
weird people hanging around the neighborhood, anything strange at all?
what do you mean you got a postcard?
it was addressed to you, which I thought was strange since you don't have any friends.
what did the postcard say, Mom?
it's against the law to read other people's mail, Lloyd.
not that you care what the law says.
okay, Mother, I need you to just lock the doors and stay inside, and we'll send someone to come keep an eye on you.
Why? What's going on?
doesn't matter. I just, I need to see that postcard, Mom.
do you remember how to use the fax machine?
good job, guys! Stunt practice is tomorrow.
ice your bodies and get some rest. We are...
rock stars!
that last eight count was off.
Yeah, tell me about it. We, like, never stick that ending.
well, you're really close.
Hey, buddy? This is a closed practice.
deputy DuChamp, U.S. Marshals. I'm here on official business.
Oh, sorry. I didn't know. - Well, now you do.
so what's the official business?
it's about your dad, actually. I need to talk to you.
liberty Bell.
he's definitely hinting at Philadelphia.
Dr. Lowery, Change is the law of life
and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.
I hate this dickhead.
he's telling us he's changed. - Yeah, into more of a psycho.
in a way, perhaps. Remember, he's used to murdering as part of a team, so now he's doing the work of two psychopaths.
and he's gonna have to change his M. O. because without Brent around, he has no audience anymore.
all right, Jules, get the task force on the phone.
Philly is the last thing this son of a bitch is gonna see.
and what's going on with our case? Where the hell is Emmy and Claire?
uh, I'm still working on Claire's computer.
the drive was completely wiped, so data recovery is taking forever.
that bag of theirs is too heavy for cash, so we got every bank and exchange in a 500-mile radius keeping an eye out for a large precious metal transaction.
made by two homicidal lipstick lesbians.
still no hits? - No hits.
sweetheart, that's got to be a half a million right there.
Where'd you two get all this?
they're my grandmother's. - They're her grandmother's.
if you're bringing this to me, it ain't your granny's.
what you're doing is asking me to fence stolen goods.
and the going rate for a fence is 60%.
that'll work.
well, come on in.
I hope you don't need small bills.
no, big is fine. I like big.
how about a big gun, you bitchface?
you and your girlfriend are all over the news.
all right, just stay cool, all right? We can work something out.
no kidding. Now, here's my offer.
my cut is 100%, and your cut is I don't call the cops.
you're worse than my pimp.
baby.
you look really pretty today.
I used to date lots of... pretty girls.
but they always bored me.
I hope you're not going to bore me, Megan.
that's a good girl.
let's get you ready.
I can't believe this whole thing started with notes passed back and forth in a prison journal.
that prison journal was crap, Claire.
this...
this is real.
Emmy, that journal... ...that wasn't crap.
all right, the things that you wrote about your pimp, those resonated with me.
and I was finally able to understand my marriage, and I was able to talk to you in a way that I had never talked to anybody before.
Claire, I... - No, listen. I was scared before.
I was scared that maybe this all meant more to me than it means to you.
no, don't-don't say that. - No, Emmy, I'm not scared anymore.
I believe in the plan, and I believe in us.
I can't believe I killed a man.
do you remember the first time that we kissed? The utility closet?
with the guards right outside the door. - Just inches away.
do you know that was the first time that I ever slept through the whole night?
like a baby.
and it was as if those horrible prison bunks were like the palm of your hand, and you were just cradling me.
I love you, Claire.
I love you, too, Emmy.
Hey, So, fingerprints put Claire Lyons and Emmy Sharp at the scene of that gold exchange robbery/homicide.
so, they're moving south, racking up more bodies.
you get anything off Claire's computer?
I've recovered a handful of directories so far, no e-mails yet.
okay. I've got her search history going back about three weeks.
ski resort in Jackson Hole, fly-fishing in Bitterroot Mountains "where the swans go to mate.
a hotel, Maison de la Salle. That sounds fancy.
they're definitely going to Montana, maybe for the honeymoon that Claire's husband never gave her.
I think it's more permanent than that.
she also searched real estate listings for ranches in Bozeman.
nesting. It's another side effect of oxytocin.
if they're dreaming about Big Sky country, how come they keep steadily moving south?
because the hormones would be affecting their reasoning. I mean, think about it.
these two were in love for weeks, maybe even months before they got to see each other.
that's a lot of tension to work out.
or one of them's dragging their heels. I mean, I'm just saying.
that's a good point. Even with all that oxytocin, some women can't commit.
Hey, Ray, that hotel, Maison de la Salle, it's, it's not in Montana. It's right here in New York.
okay, so they're going on their honeymoon before they start their new life in Montana.
Really? So they're gonna check into a fancy hotel while they're being pursued?
doesn't make any sense.
romance doesn't have to make sense.
all right, Lloyd, stay on Damien's postcard. Erica, Shea, let's go.
so, tell me the choices again.
Chloe Knight or Ivy Leder.
so Miss New Jersey or a lunch lady.
Yeah, they're not the best fake names in the world, but they're gonna allow us to own 60-acres in Montana!
I'm so excited.
okay, well, Ivy is gonna go smoke a bowl.
will Chloe draws us a bath?
bath time.
here's Johnny.
Emmy, are you coming in? It's perfect.
I want you to know I wasn't lying...
when I told you about the first time that we kissed?
baby, you had to know I wasn't gonna strut around Montana in a cowboy hat.
what do you mean?
when I first came on to you...
it's not that you're not sexy as hell, Claire, but you were always just a part of our plan.
our plan?
Emmy? Emmy. Emmy. - Do it.
do it. Do it! Do it already! - Emmy, what is this?
Emmy, what are you doing?! Please!
Emmy! Emmy, no! Emmy!
the water's still warm.
Emmy didn't leave behind anything. Least of all the loot.
this was a con from the get-go.
Emmy is one cold-blooded bitch.
the front desk says that Claire paid for the room with cash.
didn't see Emmy coming or going. So what's the story?
if Emmy wasn't caught up in the romance, why was she waiting around for the honeymoon?
she wasn't. She was waiting around for a rendezvous.
unless Emmy pees standing up, there was a guy here.
what did I tell you? "Lesbian until release date."
wait a minute. Freeze it.
I know this douche bag.
this was the John that was in Ashlee's apartment, except he's no John.
what was the name of his band?
Uh,"Hand" something. Uh, Learned Hand.
Jules, what can you find out about a band named Learned Hand?
Ray,"Learn-ed" Hand. - Hold on, Jules. What are you talking about?
two syllables: "Learn-ed. " Learned Hand.
isn't it spelled the same way? So what's the difference?
I can tell you they have a terrible name.
if a guy in a band named Learned Hand is getting laid, there is no justice in the world.
okay, I've got a Web site for Learned Hand.
um, looks like the frontman is a John, Johnny Griffin.
looks like they're a local band.
this is weird. They've recently canceled all their upcoming dates.
that's because Johnny's leaving town. We gotta find out where to.
okay. I'll see what I can find out.
ray, Ray, I figured it out, the postcards!
"change is the law of life. " That's not Damien speaking, that's JFK!
and the other quote was Clinton.
and "Old Hickory" was Andrew Jackson's nickname.
so these are presidential references. So we have three presidents and Philly.
um, Julianne, see if there's any streets named Clinton, Jackson, Kennedy in Philadelphia.
uh, all of the above.
they're pretty popular street names. - Damn it!
although, Jackson and Kennedy intersect.
and it's the location of a Clinton Fabricators, Ltd.
all right, Jules, patch me to the Marshals office in Philly.
got it.
and get a hold of Johnny's bandmates. See where he might be off to.
cape
why would you tell them I was your singer? You know I can't sing.
baby, we're a lounge act on a third-rate cruise ship.
nobody's expecting to hear... Rihanna.
Hey, Let 'em fire us. We're bailing out at Saint John anyway, right?
don't get clever, Emmy! Put the bag down! On your knees!
how'd you find me? - Hey, easy on the guitar.
Johnny's bandmates were pissed he split.
they're calling you Yoko.
see, I had this little theory that the only reason why you went gay for Claire was because you're surrounded by nothing but women.
turns out, you're just a selfish, scheming whore.
get on your knees.
philjackson
let's go! Move, move, move!
let's go. The door. Go.
Hey, move, move!
go, go!
hold up. Hostage in sight. Hostage in sight.
we're good.
thank you.
she's alive. No sign of Damien.
Hello, Lloyd. - Damien.
great job today, Dr. Lowery.
I'll admit I was pretty unimpressed by our last encounter.
but now I see I'm going to have to raise my game.
that's interesting, Damien,'cause I feel pretty confident that it's you that's not handling business the way you used to.
if you want, I could put my gun down, so to speak, we could talk.
I know that tactic. We've read the same philosophers.
"always recognize that human individuals are ends. " You know the rest, right?
I don't need Brent anymore.
you've opened me up to a whole new world.
you know, whether he realizes it or not,
Damien still very much needs an audience.
that's why he sent me all those clues 'cause he couldn't stand the idea that nobody's seen his work.
I think I'm Damien's new audience.
they have a team on it.
I mean, I've been sending them everything I've been collecting on Damien.
there's nothing they could do.
a lot of good they've been doing, Ray. A lot.
the van is waiting. They've called twice already.
all right, hold on. Those guys could use our help.
order in some Chinese. I'll take you back when I take you back.
dig in.
table Savers. Hmm?
wait! I caught you.
give me my money.
since so many days you have made us run after you.
today give us our money.
then run all by your self alone!
I will give you one tight slap.
one second. One second. Are you seeing this entire land?
the entire land. - Yes, we are seeing.
now just think that it is filled with thousand mango trees.
close your eyes and imagine. Close your eyes!
you all keep your eyes open. Or else he will run away.
only I will close my eyes.
Yes, I closed them. Now tell me, dear.
how does it feel? - It is feeling nice. Only trees are there all over.
even I thought of the same thing.
that's why I bought the entire land and even bought 1000 mango saplings.
I thought as they grow they will produce lakhs of mangoes.
because of which I will become a billionaire and repay back your small debts.
how did you find it?
very good! It's a great idea.
even I thought it was a great idea.
but the government thought of a better idea than this.
they want to lay a railway track here.
and they confiscated my land.
now I have just 1000 mango saplings left with me which are rotting along with my dreams.
we are fed up listening to your new stories.
you changed so many businesses.
and in all you had a loss. So what should we do about it?
you have even taken loans from the cats and dogs.
now you will have to take a decision. Now tell us.
when are you giving the money? - Tomorrow evening. 5 o'clock.
the bridge which is next to the river. All of you come there at 5 o'clock.
5 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 10 o'clock!
we have been hearing this since many years.
exactly that! We have a relation since so many years.
don't you have any trust on me? - No, no. Not at all.
leave all that.
I am going to change the opinion that you all have about me.
tomorrow evening at 5 o'clock.
I am going to repay back all your debts together.
Really? - If you don't then?
if I don't then do as you feel like.
but sharp 5 o'clock.
if you don't come on time then I am not going to wait.
then later don't tell me that you didn't get your money.
fine. - Fine.
come, welcome.
I welcome all of you.
very good! I said 5 o'clock. You all have come sharp at 5 o'clock.
who says that the people over here don't come on time?
move! One minute. Move.
has he started giving the money?
listen! Don't worry. The program has just started.
so everyone has come? - Yes, we have come.
I will do one thing. I will read everyone's name one by one.
Whosever's name I read, that one must raise their hand and say that he is present.
okay? - Yes. - Yes. - Very good.
Hariram Navid. 12, 250 rupees. - Present.
Prabhakar Shetty. Along with interest it is 13, 900 rupees.
present! - How are you, dear? - I am fine.
Raghuveer Gwala. 20, 500 rupees. - Present.
how is everyone at home? - Yes, they are fine. - Okay.
Oye! First pay me my money and let me go.
Hey! Sharma-ji.
I have to give you a lot of money. And he himself has come late.
now don't delay. Give me my money. - Be calm! Be calm!
see, along with Sharma-ji's money I have to give all of you a total of 13, 90, 000 rupees.
I don't have so much with me. I am falling a little short.
how much are you falling short?
not much. I am falling short just a little bit.
even then. How much?
100 rupees. - Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. - No, no.
I just have 100 rupees with me.
I am falling short by 13, 89, 900 rupees.
take the money out! - Listen!
don't touch this. - What is in this?
rat poison. - Rat poison!
actually the thing is that I don't have that much money to buy cyanide so I was roaming with this.
who knows when the need of this arises?
throw the bottle! - Throw the bottle!
I knew that you all wouldn't even let me die in peace.
even then I have no complaints about all of you.
you all have helped me at some point of time or the other.
but I won't betray you all.
I will return you all every penny back.
what to do?
whatever business I started it all doomed.
at the end I opened a firecracker factory.
even that went bust.
then sell those firecrackers and repay the debts of all of us.
Hey! What I meant was that the firecrackers didn't work.
then from where should I give you your money?
my father used to say that my name would definitely come in the Guinness Book of World Records.
he was right.
there wouldn't be anyone in the world apart from me who is so young and has taken such a huge amount of loan.
but I didn't do all this on purpose.
the situations were such.
now I have only 2 options.
either you all give me 5 years time.
or I will have to jump into the ocean and die.
Hey! Don't try to act over smart with me!
if you die by jumping in the ocean then I am happily willing to let go of my money.
if you have so much guts then jump into the ocean.
I will jump!
I have taken a huge amount of insurance policy on my name.
and you all will get your money back from that.
but I need some help of you all in it.
tell the insurance agents that my death was just an accident it wasn't suicide.
while I was talking to you all my leg slipped and I fell into the water.
as soon as we get the money my father will pay you all back the money.
hey dude! Stop talking about these futile things!
and talk something about giving our money back.
Yes!
this is his new trick. New trick!
dear Jeetu, don't play this game with us.
I just have this game with me.
its not that I don't want to live.
but there is no other option left.
those people who know me closely, they will understand.
that my decision was not wrong.
Hey! He really got drowned!
did we get any information from the guard? - No.
what happened? Did you get the body? - No, inspector.
did you look for it properly?
father, someone has come to meet you.
tell me.
sir, we haven't come to meet you but Jeetu-ji.
Yes, father.
they are saying that they have come to meet you.
Yes, I know you.
but why have they come to meet me, father?
I know why they have come. - Yes, even I know.
I thought before meeting me they should see you once.
Why?
am I a monkey that I will show them some act?
so anyone who comes first must see me.
father, you don't know him?
Baban Rao... the vegetable guy.
do you remember the lottery business I had started...
Yes, the one that had gone into losses.
so... he only had helped me in returning back the bank loan.
along with the money and interest the total comes up to 40, 000 rupees.
I am fed up telling him.
that I will pay him tomorrow. I will pay him tomorrow.
even then he doesn't believe me.
you don't have to give me him any money.
you just have to give him a date for that.
he will agree to it. He will agree.
you are right.
to give people a date and not to meet them on that date.
I don't have this talent, which you have, dear.
even he knows that, father.
that's why he was saying that only when you give a date then he will agree.
please, help me, father. Or else I will have to get myself hanged.
Yes, dear ones!
they are not giving you a date. He is paying you the entire money.
take this rope.
tie it around your neck and hang yourself.
your elder sister is sitting in the house unwed.
this house is only left which we had to mortgage because of you.
and you want more help from me.
what will I help you?
go and drown somewhere so that we can save ourselves from more ruin.
go!
see, the decision that we had taken...
...don't use that to ruin my daughter's life.
what are you talking?
have I ever interfered in your path till date?
you do one thing.
you find a good boy for Pooja and get her married with great pomp and show.
and I will be the first one in that to help you.
are you happy? - Only if she agrees to it!
since years she is stubborn about one thing.
that she wants to get married to you only.
why are you cursing her?
since the time she has come to her senses you have been hearing one thing.
that we are made for each other.
I agree that we also wanted the same thing.
but I didn't know that you would grow up to become such a useless person.
you find a groom for her. I will handle the rest.
I won't be able to bear the pain of separation from her.
but at least she will live in peace.
she won't agree.
till the time you are in front of her she will never agree to marry someone else.
understood?
that's why I am saying that run away.
go away to some far of place.
and return after years.
and even if you don't come back then also it will do.
actually the thing is that you can get rid of your moneylenders and I will get my daughter married somewhere else.
understood?
now don't say that you don't have money to go.
take this! Take this money!
keep it!
and don't come back with the excuse to return this.
how did you come with this rally?
have you left everything and got into politics?
it's not politics. I had to save myself from the moneylenders.
when I participate in the rally then the moneylenders can't catch me.
when in the morning I came out then I got the rally of BJP.
then I reached the post office by walking with them.
after reaching over there I got to know they wanted to go left and I wanted to go right.
then I escaped.
after waiting for such a long time I caught hold of this congress rally.
then I could come to meet you.
Oh God!
sometimes you become a part of this rally and sometime the other rally?
don't these rally people tell you anything?
they tell me.
whatever they say I speak the same thing.
I am fed up with you.
leave all that. Come here, with me.
don't talk rubbish!
have I ever troubled you with the topic of marriage?
until all your tensions are not over I am willing to wait for you.
till when? - Let it take whatever time.
let anything happen.
we will at least live together one day.
that's all. That is enough for me.
this cannot happen, Pooja.
I have a lot of burden of loan over me.
I can't even handle the weight of an ant.
and if you really ask me even you are a burden for me now.
we will have to separate, Pooja.
now you go home.
if this rally passes by then there is no rally till the evening that will make me reach home.
have you ever even got groceries for a week for this house?
now father can't tell this to me, mother.
take this.
this is one week's grocery and vegetables to cook along with it.
have you got fish?
what are you saying, mother?
don't I know that fish is not cooked in this house?
then this stink of fish?
yes... I was going through the fish market.
so over there people carry fish in the containers.
so even I picked up a few.
just like that. Just for a change.
dear, you are doing all this...
as if I am going to do all this work every day?
you cook the meal. I will have a shower and come quickly.
mother, aren't you eating food? - I will have it later.
this won't do! I have put in so much of hard work.
you will have to have one morsel from my hands.
what has happened to you, dear?
mother, I had promised you a lot of things, right?
big house. New car. Servants.
is everything ready?
now I feel I won't be able to give you anything, mother. Never.
I don't want anything.
I can't bear to see all that you do to get rid of the moneylenders.
you don't worry.
I have a way to solve it.
after that no one will run after me.
is it? What is it?
when it happens, you will get to know it on your own.
maybe you might first feel hurt.
but never abuse or curse me.
...then tell him that Jeetu wasn't a bad boy.
whatever he did, he didn't do it on purpose.
and definitely tell him this that I loved him a lot.
those people who had gone to look for the body they have all come back.
the current is very strong today.
there are few chances of finding the body.
take Master-ji home.
these eyes and the kohl.
this bindi and this veil.
why do they make me so restless?
why does... my heart... love you only so much?
why does... my heart... love you only so much?
from the blooming mornings.
from the fading evenings.
from my own people and from strangers.
why do I ask this again and again?
why does... my heart... love you only so much?
my day and nights are there only because of you.
the days and nights... the days and nights... the days and nights.
I am nothing without you.
without you... without you... without you.
this feeling is so deep.
these boundaries of desires.
why do they make me so restless?
why does... my heart... love you only so much?
from the blooming mornings.
from the fading evenings.
from my own people and from strangers.
why do I ask this again and again?
why does... my heart... love you only so much?
hey Raju, go and find that Gundya out!
see there. That Gujarati in the moustache.
but what is he doing here in a minister's attire.
he must have come to buy fish.
whether the moustache is on the face or the face is on the moustache.
this can't be figured out only!
Hey, you fool!
this moustache has nothing to do with you!
he knows Hindi.
Hey! You guys don't know him? - No.
he is Prabhat Singh Chauhan.
who are these people? And what are they doing here?
sir, they are new. They have come just now.
that's why they don't know you.
so what if we are from Gujarat?
we are not whiling away our time since 2 generations in Calcutta.
what are you talking about Hindi?
I can speak better Bengali also.
have you heard Tagore's verses?
no, we haven't heard that.
but we have only heard the abuses from the mouth of our father after he gets drunk in the evening.
it is futile to talk with you all.
tell me has anyone of you seen that person Gundya who takes money on loan?
hasn't he returned your money till now?
if I spot him now then I will burn him alive.
he must be somewhere here.
hey Raju!
boss!
who is he?
fool! Can't you see that a good guy is praying?
go and do your work.
Hey!
see that! Today Gundya brother's boat is coming first.
my boat?
Oh! So you are here.
I thought a good guy is sitting here and praying.
get up! You scoundrel! You betrayer!
my boat is coming. - I know that your boat is coming.
first give my money.
see... see.
...he gets 1. 5 lakhs in the auction.
you know that. - What?
Yes, so I will give you in the evening.
even then something will be left.
you are too much!
the boat that has come first will also go first and tomorrow also it will be the first to come.
so I will get 1. 5 lakhs tomorrow evening too. I will get it, right?
now tell me.
how much is the total accounting to?
1. 5 and 1. 5? - 3
three. How much do I have to give you?
2. 75. - 2. 75.
how much is left?
25... 25, 000. - This much is left. - Yes.
that means you have to give me 25, 000 rupees.
correct? - Yes.
when will you give me? - What?
when will you give me 25, 000 rupees?
I will give you? - What do you mean by that?
when will you give? - I said I will give you.
what does this mean!
isn't my money, money?
and don't try to change my topic!
I must get my money by day after tomorrow.
or else I will shave your moustache and make you sit on a donkey.
he just claims! He will give it.
remember that you have come across a Bengali guy!
what happened?
1. 5 and 1. 5... 3.
2. 75... 25. But when did he give my money?
move! Go away!
beware! No one step into the boat!
whoever wants to auction it, must stand in the front.
and if you don't have money in your pockets then don't say anything.
first me!
what are you doing? Is your wife in my boat that you have jumped in?
get out! Go away!
there is not even a single fish!
Bandya! - Yes!
Bandya, is this a mermaid? - No, it is not a mermaid.
Yes.
is this a dead body? - Yes. - Who says it is a dead body?
this is a dead body.
open his mouth and see, he is still breathing.
he is breathing?
now what will I tell that moustache guy?
what is the need to tell the moustache guy everything?
you alone are capable to take him to the hospital.
you have got me trapped very well!
now as soon as I threw the fishing net I caught him.
he was alive.
so I let go of the fishes and got him here.
you did a good thing. A very good thing.
shut up! Close your mouth!
sir, you will get the moon from the President on 15th August.
so will I lick the moon!
not that moon! Gold medal.
gold medal, scoundrel!
first I am finding it difficult to live hand to mouth and on top of that this new problem is on my head!
come, hold his legs!
not mine! Hold the legs of the dead body!
if I didn't get this dead body to the hospital on time and if he dies here then I will definitely land up into a big mess!
call! Call 3 to 4 people!
come! - Come!
what are you all standing and staring at my face! Come!
get up! Get up!
what happened?
go and get these medicines quickly. Go fast.
get up! Get up!
why should I get these?
how much ever medicines are in the hospital make him have half spoons of each and he will be fine.
even the oxygen cylinder is getting over.
we have to get a new one.
the entire cylinder is over? - Yes.
which side of your teeth is paining? - This side.
just wait. I will call you.
open the windows of the hospital and tell him he will get as much oxygen he wants.
why don't you understand?
I have got hurt and he himself is crying.
come on, boss. Sit here. Sit here.
sit. Sit.
boss, is everything fine. - No, it is paining. - Okay.
first go and see whether he has come to his senses. - Okay.
Hey! What is this? Where?
what are you doing?
boss!
boss, where were you? I was searching for you since so long.
what happened? - Doctor has called.
I don't want to come. - Why?
he removed my tooth. I don't know what all will he remove.
I don't want to come. - Tooth? - Yes.
first of all I didn't have anything to lose.
this tooth wasn't even giving me any problem.
that guy just pulled it out deliberately.
but I don't know what all will go of mine over here today!
nothing will go. It will only come. It will only come.
what will come? The string of your pants?
come. You first come.
come... come.
this guy who is lying down here. Do you know who he is? - Who is he?
he is a millionaire! Millionaire! - Millionaire?
and he got trapped by you?
only millionaire's get trapped.
don't you believe? Do you know what is this?
this is the underwear. - This is not underwear. It is a letter.
this is not an ordinary letter.
in this it is written that this man has to take money from how many people.
full account is written and that too in lakhs.
and the people who couldn't return his money must have thrown him into the ocean.
see his face. Is it like yours? No, right?
doesn't he look that he has come from a nice family background?
boss, it is very easy.
we saved his life. How much will we get for that?
at least 5 lakhs we will get for that. - From whom? - His father.
do you know his father? - That... that... his mother will be aware of.
who is his mother? - That we will ask him. - Who is he?
those people must be knowing him. - Who! - His parents.
without knowing him how will we get to know his parents? Idiot!
I have one idea. - What?
we will show him his own photo and ask him who he is.
then at least he will say who he is. - Very good!
boss! He has come! - Who? - Senses.
he has come back to his senses.
see he has opened his eyes and is laughing.
you haven't died. You are alive.
those people from whom you have to take money I have the entire list with me. It is secure.
we will take it back from them together.
I am with you.
tell me, dear, where is your name? Where are your parents?
where do they stay?
can you listen to what we are saying?
how will he listen?
water must have gone into his ears.
water has gone into his ears not his mouth.
tell me!
see, we are not your enemies. We are your friends. - Yes.
see, I swear by this bottle of glucose.
I have spent a lot of money on you. - He is right!
Hey! See the 5 lakhs that I am going to get for saving your life from that you give me 2 lakhs now. Advance!
he has fainted again!
Oh no!
he drank the entire thing!
he drank all the 6 bowls of it!
keep it. Keep it.
tell him! Ask him! Who are his parents? Where are they?
when will he give our money?
did you tell him that or no?
so till now haven't you realized that he is deaf!
he is deaf! Oh no!
he just understands one language. Of signs!
boss, look at me. I will show you.
boss, see what he said. He wants more soup.
he is not just deaf but dumb too.
so do you have money with you? - No. - No?
then will your father pay for more soup?
he just tries to act frail, but he eats a lot.
don't ask him such futile things!
scoundrel has put on a lot of weight after eating so much!
you jerk!
Hey! Where have you come from!
where is your house!
boss, ask him in sign language.
so then you ask him!
ask him where is his house? Ask! - Fine.
your... house... bar.
where is your house?
he is asking for more soup.
not soup... house. - Shut up, you fool!
you just talk about food items to him.
now I will talk to him. - Ask, boss.
your... village.
well... water.
your village... village where is it? Where is it?
which village is this? - He is asking where is your village?
it is the graveyard.
I will ask you about all the places of India in sign language.
you tell me which is your place?
what is this?
you didn't understand? - No. - Latur.
I am kicking. Latur.
when you said it now from your mouth then I understood.
okay, at least one fool understood.
now how will anyone explain this fool?
boss, ask him about Ratnagiri.
ratna ... Ratna!
come here.
Yes, boss.
Ratna... Giri.
you haven't understood correctly.
I will ask him about here. About Calcutta.
call... Call... then cut it.
boss, ask carefully or else he will cut me up.
so then what should I do? What should we do?
ask him about Boribandar, boss.
Boribandar? - Yes.
bori ... understood?
load it once again, boss. - Now you tell him about the Bandar.
understood? Boribandar.
did you understand, fool?
who is Gundya-bhau here? - He.
come here. - What happened?
we have got to know that you have got a big thing from the ocean.
whatever you have got you have to come with it to the police station with me.
Bandya! - Yes, boss. - Get that big thing.
so is this it?
so did you think we have got gold and silver?
who is he? From where has he come from?
till we don't get to know about that we won't leave him.
this is a very good thing that you have said. Fine.
but, since we don't have a complaint against him we can't even keep him inside.
as of now I am letting him go with you two.
and whenever I call you, you will have to take him and come.
this is your responsibility.
sir, the money...
no, no. I don't want any money. I am just doing you a favour.
just think of it in that sense. Go.
is this what we call living?
it is worse than the living of the dog of a washer man!
and on top of that this evil guy! - And both of us are completely bankrupt.
I have given you my shirt to wear.
now after it gets dirty and starts stinking only then will I give you another one!
Yamaha? No, I will get you a Hero Honda. Come.
why are we going this side? - That I don't know, boss.
but why are you dragging me?
where am I dragging you?
so he was the one who was pulling us here!
Oh this poor chap must be feeling hungry!
he can't speak. He is dumb. That's why he got us here.
boss, don't touch it.
he is asking for chips.
it's not a lizard, boss.
Hey! Don't snatch it. Don't snatch it.
what misbehaviour is this, boss?
go! Move away!
sir! Give me 3 cups of tea.
2 proper ones and one without sugar and with less milk.
for who is that, boss?
we will have to make him drink a bad tea. - Is it?
if we give him a good tea then he will be habituated to it and will get us here everyday by dragging us.
sir, do one thing.
from his share put sugar and more milk in my tea. - Yes.
Why? - Boss, you are paying for all three, right?
paying for all three!
are you abusing? - Shut up!
boss, what have you thought of ahead?
ahead? First let me get rid of this ghost.
we will think later of what needs to be done ahead.
give me tea, please. - Yes.
leave it! Leave it!
it is not mine! It is not mine! - Don't hit him, boss.
the hen has given them.
what is he saying?
he is asking for boiled egg.
give him boiled water. Tell him that the egg has got boiled inside it.
he is dumb. He won't come to know.
give it to him.
Hey! Hey!
there is no sugar in this at all.
over here when you say without sugar, you get it absolutely without sugar.
do you make tea or are you fooling us?
tea without sugar. - My tea is very sweet.
so you only give the money.
boss, now since we have spent so much we will take one chips too.
give him also one.
boss, Jabba has gone.
gone? - Yes.
he has gone!
I am saved.
where did he go? - How do I know?
fool, catch him or else the police will catch us.
where did he go? Where did he go? Jabba!
Hello! - Hello... I am Jeet.
who is speaking? - Hello. I am Jeet's friend speaking.
is Mohan-ji there?
see we haven't got the money till now.
but we will get the insurance money as soon as possible.
we are trying hard for it.
actually the thing is that the body is nowhere to be found.
so this is for sure that he is dead.
if he were alive we would have known by now.
how much do you have to take?
boss, see that! See that!
come, come. He is hiding and sitting here. Catch him red-handed.
he is inside.
Hey! Hey! One has to speak in it. This is of no use to you. Keep it.
what is this? This bill just comes out like that.
the machine must be bad. Yes, come.
Hey! Give me the money. - What?
pay the money for the call.
he can't speak. He is dumb and deaf.
we need to pay money to hold the phone? What is he talking?
he must be dumb and deaf, you must be dumb and deaf but I am not dumb and deaf.
this bill has come. Then you have to pay the money.
I will see how he doesn't pay the money.
give me the money! - What if I don't give?
then I will give!
what did you say? What will you do?
I will give it to him. - To whom? - I will give him.
you will give him? - I will. - This means you will hit him.
I will. - You will hit him? - I will.
hit him and show. I want to see. Hit him.
what are you telling him to hit me for?
take this. Take this. Your money.
what will you see? He will hit me and you will see, is it?
what will you see?
boss! - What is it? - He has again disappeared.
he was just here. Then where did he go? Hey! He was here...
will you just sit here bossing over me...
find him!
now keep an eye on him. He should not sneak away like a cat.
come! Come! Dumb guy, come on walk!
this thing of trouble had to fall on my head only! - Yes.
when he fell into my trap I understood then that he is going to be a burden on you.
so he will be a burden to me only. How will he a burden to you?
go... go and untie the boat. Untie the boat!
the old man always harasses me!
because of that moustache Gujarati, I have hidden and kept the boat here. Is it?
so that he should not take it and go. - Till when will we hide it?
that moustache guy will take the boat and go.
you have said this so many times and not let the boat go into the waters since a week.
I have become so bankrupt that I don't even have money to drink water.
I am drinking my own tears and living.
so I should open a food shop for you amidst the ocean?
open this!
the only thing left to eat is grass and raw fish.
raw fish and on top of that this crocodile!
should I say one thing, boss? Don't mind it. - Tell me.
you are a very big scoundrel! - So I am!
I am.
you take loan but you don't repay it. - From where will I give it?
first of all there is no money in the pocket.
and on top of that a ghost in white clothes is dancing on my head.
all of this has happened because of this unlucky person!
hey Bandya! Come here.
if within 24 hours you don't get rid of this trouble then I won't let you step into the boat.
even you can't step into the boat. - Why?
because that moustache guy has threatened to take the boat in 20 hours.
then untie the boat!
if you say it in Hindi like this then I will be able to understand.
Hey! I will give you one tight slap, you fool!
you must be doomed!
now, we can sell this boat comfortably.
you scoundrel won't go into the boat.
first let this scoundrel go into it.
come. - Hey! Put your right leg in first.
maybe this unlucky person proves lucky for us.
put your right leg first!
hey you fool! Right means put this leg first. Here.
he has 2 legs still he doesn't understand. Turn!
see, it is going behind.
the platform is not going behind, you fool!
the boat is going ahead.
moustache guy! - We have got ruined!
moustache guy is taking the boat and going.
Bandya, jump into the water. Jump into the water
why should I jump into the water and die?
the moustache guy has taken the boat and gone!
this unlucky person, wherever he steps he brings bad luck.
boss, he is dumb. Don't hit him.
my boat has gone! Oh God!
boss! - Yes. - Now it is just too much!
today we will take a decision about this. - What kind of decision?
first we will straight go to that moustache guy! - Then?
and then we will ask the moustache guy whether he will return the boat or not. - Then?
then the moustache guy will say that he won't return the boat.
so then? - Then the decision is taken.
fool!
Hey! Where are you all barging in?
leave that!
go and tell that moustache guy in Gujarati that Gundya-bhau has come.
tell him! And even tell him that Bandya is with him too.
Yes! And even the dumb and deaf guy is also there.
Yes! And tell him that our temper is very bad and if required we can even wrestle. Tell him.
Oh! Wrestling? -Yes, wrestling. Go and tell him.
that moustache guy stays in Calcutta but keeps a Gujarati watchman instead of a Bengali or a Nepali.
tomorrow he only will do a robbery.
are you a body builder?
it doesn't make any difference. Go and tell him!
then you may go inside. - Come on.
catch him properly! Now throw him down!
boss! You have come at the right time to get your boat back!
hey wait!
come on. - Boss, said to leave. - Not outside. Come inside.
come inside.
come! Come, you clever person!
what have you come to take from here?
greetings, sir. I have come to take the boat. - Boat?
this is Gujarat. Gujarat!
there is no boat here nor is there any bottle!
get out from here.
don't ruin me. I am a poor person.
then why are you talking in a lower tone and flattering me. Speak loudly!
that day what did you tell me when I had come to take the money from you?
in front of everyone.
he said that he will shave my moustache and make me sit on a donkey and will make me roam in the entire village.
now shave my moustache and show.
I don't remember... Now, shave my moustache.
shave it! Hold it. - I didn't say that.
don't you remember? - No.
okay, let that be.
you must at least be remembering what you told to my men when they had gone to ask for money.
you had said that this is not Gujarat and that this area is yours!
you even threatened to break their legs.
you had said this, right?
didn't you say this or not?
when did I say this? - No, you had said this.
you had said it. That day when you were in the boat.
that day you had said it.
and you had also said that you would cut him into pieces and also feed it to the fishes.
boss, you had said it, right?
he must have forgotten it. There is a lot of tension.
shut up! You jerk! Shut up!
I didn't say that. I swear by my mother. I didn't.
you must have definitely said it. I have full faith in you.
you can't rest without talking ill about me.
I swear by your mother... - Hey!
you point a finger to my mother!
greetings, mother.
see! You are not aware of the power of Gujaratis.
if you have the guts then come into the wrestling ring wrestle it out, defeat anyone of us and take your boat back.
this is a very good opportunity, sir.
we will defeat a few and take the boat back.
Hey! What are you whispering?
if you have the guts then come.
if I win then will I get the boat back? - Absolutely.
and my money? - That loan I am willing to forego. - Forego? - Yes.
sure? - Sure. - You promise in front of everyone? - Yes
come on, come on.
mother, give me the blessing so that I can defeat your son.
give me the blessing. - Yes.
hail Goddess Durga! Finish them!
why is he coming back?
this is wrong. This is wrong. I am not going to go ahead with this.
boss, what happened?
he has worn the underwear. So what do you have to do with that?
but I haven't worn it.
you should have at least worn underwear at someone else's house.
what to do? Even the underwear is with him. - How is that?
I had kept the underwear on the boat to dry.
the boat has gone and so has the underwear.
so first we will ask for the underwear then we will ask for the boat.
no, first the boat then underwear.
Why? What happened?
have you got scared already?
no, not like that.
if something else goes wrong, then he doesn't have what is needed to save him.
and Chauhan sir, don't think that we are... cowards. No.
my father and grandfathers... were fighters. Yes!
and in his family... - All of them were warriors. - Yes.
that's why he is going to fight instead of me. - Yes.
how can I fight?
Why? Aren't you a warrior?
I am... but I am not going to fight...
Hey, keep quiet, you dumb guy!
he is right. - I can't fight with him.
fine then, you can fight with Sheetal.
now you will come to know.
this is deceitful!
what kind of names have you kept?
you give a man a female name!
this is unjust! I won't fight with him.
go!
catch him! Catch him!
catch that lizard!
catch him by the neck. - Yes, catch him.
tear him apart!
and after tearing him apart throw one piece in Surat and the other in Ahmedabad!
turn him around! Turn him around!
No! No!
come here.
he is dumb! He is dumb! Don't hit him.
leave him and catch him.
even I am dumb. Even I am dumb. Someone tell him.
okay, let him go.
see, this was not a fight. - Then? - This was just a game for us.
this was a game. - Yes, this was a game. Now the fight will start.
hit him! Hit him! - Wait. Wait!
by hitting us or by capturing our boat will you get your money?
so then what else should I do!
give me my boat back and I will sell it and repay your entire loan back.
seriously. - No! I don't trust you at all.
if I give you your boat back then again you will disappear. - No!
I can give you your boat back only on one condition. - What?
if you mortgage something that you own.
now whatever I have is already mortgaged to you.
to free that what else should I mortgage?
that I don't know. I want something or the other.
either house, land or wife.
Oh God! Now where will I get a wife from?
sir, you don't trust me, right? - No.
so till the time I don't come back I am mortgaging him.
okay? - He? Who is he?
he...he is my only nephew.
I have raised him with a lot of love.
I never used to keep him down, lest some snake should bite him.
I never kept him over my head lest crows or vultures take him away.
I have always kept him in my lap. On my lap.
my dear nephew! Kanhaiya.
I...I cannot stay for a moment without you.
what should I do?
I don't have any other way.
till the time your uncle doesn't repay back the money you will have to stay here.
Oh God!
boss! Boss!
you can't stay even for a moment away from a poor man like me.
then how will you remain alive without your dearest nephew?
boss!
Hey! Shut up!
so... you also can't bear his separation. Enough.
so fine. Then even leave him here. - What?
no, no. This can't happen. - Why?
because I can't be away from my boss.
Bandya! - Yes.
Bandya! - Yes.
I will bear the separation of yours, Bandya.
I will bear it. Go!
boss!
Seth-ji, I am taking my boat and going.
but my dearest one and the not so dearest one I am leaving here and going.
saw! Did you see the result of taking on Chauhan?
Yes, I saw.
children, take care of yourself. And I will come on the 2nd.
Bandya! In every month there is a date for the 2nd.
don't go. - I have given my word. - Then take it back.
take them and go. - Separate them from me.
be happy, dear! - I am taking my bag.
the poor man is crying and going. - Let him, he will learn a lesson.
now he will come to know how cunning I am!
I got rid of the dumb guy, the fool and also got my boat back.
it will be better if you listen to me and do as I say.
or else? - It will bad for me!
I am the manager over here. NatwarJhunjhunwala!
whatever you might say, he won't hear.
how will he not hear?
I will teach him a lesson. This is good!
tell me, Jabba! Jabba! Will you listen to me?
should I show you how hot blooded my hand is?
this is absolutely cold. - Hey!
I will show the both of you! To the both of you!
where are you going?
you only said that you are showing something.
I will give you only one... Not one, they are 2.
what is the matter?
he was showing you all to us. - No, madam.
these people haven't seen you all.
no, no. We have seen. We have seen you completely.
you jerk! I will kill you.
Hey! What is this happening?
nothing is happening. Nothing.
I was taking their size for new clothes.
I have to make new clothes for them.
there is no need to make new clothes for them.
they are the servants for this house. They are not the kids of your uncle.
there are old clothes in the house. Give something from them.
get them inside.
amongst the both of you who knows to polish the shoes well?
I don't know. He knows it very well. He is a pro at it.
what is your name? - Bandya. - What, is it Dandiya?
Bandya... Bandya. - Okay, Dandya.
Dandya, see.
first you learn to polish shoes.
get all the shoes of this house and give to him.
come, cobbler!
if I would polish so many shoes on the footpath, I would have earned so much as to buy a boat in a week's time.
take this.
these are a little old shoes.
use them for practice and know how to properly polish shoes.
and we will give you new ones too.
and some of the shoes are not at home since the people have gone out.
when they come back, we will give you those too.
are you going to be a collector that you are studying?
do some work!
no, no. This won't do.
each person has to do his own work.
and that too within deadlines set.
or else one gets beaten up with dog-chains.
okay? Is this how it is!
then I will finish the work within the time given.
finish this work quickly so that you can be given other work.
am I a genie from a bottle?
okay, tell me.
amongst both of you who knows to wash clothes properly?
one more job. This I won't do it at all.
I wash clothes very well. He doesn't know it at all.
I will teach him.
no, no. Clothes are expensive.
if the person who doesn't know to wash clothes does it then the clothes will tear.
so? - You only will have to do this job.
one day you will die coughing.
where is the place to wash clothes?
tell me one thing.
haven't the people over here washed their clothes since 2 years?
Hey! Don't waste your time in futile things.
others are also getting their clothes.
let them get it! Let them get the clothes of the entire house.
and also ask the neighbours to get their clothes.
this is a cheap and good soap, right?
that's why you are making me work so much.
is this a skirt or some tent cloth?
hey you actor! - Call me Natwar!
tell me one thing. How many families stay in this house?
15 to 16 families.
so why do you call it a house? Call it a district.
do your work. Or else I will hang you from the rope.
which demon does this 'Kurta' belong to?
it belongs to our Master.
this means there is a master demon too?
Hey! Speak softly. They are nothing.
he is the actual boss. Mangal Singh Chauhan.
he has gone to Gujarat. He must be on his way.
come on! Come on! Come and have your meal!
what? Dig? I am not going to dig! I also know a little bit of Gujarati.
don't you want to eat? - No! - No? - No!
then you go to hell! - You go to hell!
Hey, go! You don't understand Gujarati.
go and dig.
when you will do a lot of hard work, then you will come to know!
here I am having a tough time washing clothes and to top it all they want me to dig!
I am a worker who works endlessly.
do you know what he meant?
he was calling you to eat food.
what? - Now you go and do your work. - What food?
Yes, there is bean vegetable, bread and for sweets there is 'ghungra'.
there is 'choli', 'sabzi' and what else?
bread. - Bread?
and what is there for sweets?
what do they call it in Gujarati? Ghungra. No, ghagra. Ghungra.
I was thinking of something else.
now nothing can happen.
this is the rule of this house that if one person refuses in this house for the first time then he doesn't get food again.
Oh God! What injustice is this?
I do all the work and he eats the food.
now nothing can be possible?
it is possible that after everyone finishes then whatever is left.
I will tell them then they will call you.
do something. Do something.
Hey! Get up! Go and wash clothes!
he is wetting my pants.
Hey! What are you doing? Have you gone mad?
suddenly I remembered my boss. That's why I lost my senses.
foolish! This is not your boss's clothes.
this is the dress of master's only sister.
if they even tear a little then master will not spare you.
Hey!
what do you want?
I don't know Gujarati.
that's why when they called me for food I didn't go.
can I get a little food? - What? - Shoe?
shoe? Yes, I polished shoes long time back.
and I have also washed the clothes.
can I get... what did that guy tell me?
can I get ghagro and choli ? - What?
a blouse and a skirt? - Yes, a blouse and a skirt.
whose do you want? You give me. You give me.
you shameless guy! You want my skirt and blouse?
Yes, I want.
Oh no! - If you don't mind then I will take it myself.
uncle! Come soon! Come soon!
Papa, come soon!
what happened?
he is saying that he wants my skirt and blouse.
Yes, I want it.
you give me. Give me.
hit him! Hit him!
definitely you must have done something.
that's why you are in such a state.
this is good that I reached at the right time.
or else they would beat you up and cooked you for dinner.
sit. - What kind of people are these?
they only make me work from morning till evening.
they don't even give food.
he is also sitting here.
did you get the news?
they beat me up very badly in the kitchen.
Yes. Even there they beat me.
why are you crying? Now don't go anywhere.
Yes. Sit here. Sit.
you will get it here only. - What? Beating? - No, food.
take this. Take this plate. Give him.
which animals skin this is?
this is bread. - How can I eat just this?
I need something with this.
can I get pickle?
do you want 4 of them? - Yes.
take these 4. 1, 2. 3 and 4.
what is this? Yuck! - 5 and 6.
did you wash your hands?
since 24 hours I have been washing clothes and that too with soap.
and should I wash my hands for this food? - Dirty guy!
can I get a saw to cut it?
thank God that today the bread is softer as compared to the other days.
so are these those 2 fools who have come to work?
the boys are good. Very hard working.
do they give only so much to eat? Is it?
so should we get you food from 5 star hotels?
eat quickly and get to work.
no, no. I am not used to eating such strong and rigid food.
look at him. How quietly he is eating food!
give anything to him. He will eat it quietly.
and if you tell him anything then he won't even listen. - Why?
is he dumb and deaf? - Yes, he is dumb and deaf.
but he is not proud of it at all.
he is asking for buttermilk. - He is asking forte.
Yes, he is asking forte.
whatever you get, get 2 of them.
is she the madam you were talking about? - No!
she is also a madam. But above her there is one more madam.
like him.
Why? Does she eat a lot?
no. She can't speak. But she can hear.
Shruti, come with me. I have to show you something.
come with me for a minute. I want you to meet a man.
come. Come with me!
see this.
neither he can hear nor speak.
but it doesn't seem that he is either dumb or deaf.
you fool!
I am getting to eat animal skin, and that too you are not able to tolerate.
I will kill you today.
wait! Wait, you scoundrel! Wait!
come here. Come here.
sir, please forgive me. I didn't see you.
if you didn't see me then how did you aim right under my eye?
no, no. I was hitting him. - Whom? - Him.
this poor chap who is dumb.
wait! Wait!
now I will show you the fun.
wait! Hold this. Hold this!
now you hit him.
and listen, it should hit him here only. Hit him!
you dumb guy! I am your brother.
Hey! Now hit me!
hit him!
whatever happens, it's always Mangal Mangal Mangal.
do you people also think about anything apart from Mangal?
Mangal is not your elder brother. He is the son of your elder brother.
I agree that he is the son of my elder brother.
but he means more to me than my elder brother.
whatever he says will be the law in this house and everyone will have to follow it. Even you.
Hey! Uncle!
wait! Stop all this! Is this a place to play?
Why? What happened?
what if your legs break? - Then we will get it plastered.
one can plaster your leg, but I can't plaster the tent if anything happens to it.
all these things are mine. I can come here whenever I want.
understood?
Hey! Go away! - Why should I go?
come on now, go!
cut carefully!
they had asked you to cut plants. What are you cutting?
if you are going to stand in front then it will get cut.
go away!
what happened? - That is what I am asking.
what is happening here?
what do you want?
if I have tied it then I only will take it away.
leave this. This I have tied.
I am not talking about this.
you very well know that and even the members of the family know that as soon as the marriage takes place I take it and go.
hey sir! What happened?
sir, I was saying that... - He lengthened my tie.
what did he tie? - He had tied it for the marriage.
for whose marriage? - Shruti madam's marriage.
okay! So he is Shruti's husband. - Hey!
what nonsense are you talking?
will you get me killed?
wasn't he yelling and saying that he has tied it?
what he meant that he has tied the tent of the marriage he hasn't married Shruti! - What?
is this a tent? I thought this was a house?
in your village do your houses look like this?
donkey!
this is not a house. This is a palace.
it was senior sir's order that the house should be decorated like a palace.
it is Shruti madam's marriage, right?
when is the marriage?
the date of marriage has passed by.
the day the marriage was there, that day it was broken.
it is very sad that the marriage is broken on the marriage day itself.
the marriage was broken in this wedding tent and in this tent only the marriage will take place.
this promise was taken by Mangal in this tent itself.
without my consent who is he to have taken an oath in my tent?
will he take an oath by asking you?
don't talk too much! You are getting the rent, right?
see sir, don't entrap me.
I already have 2 to 3 marriages and a festival at a temple to handle.
I have taken advance for all of them.
I have to dismantle this tent from here and put it there.
if you touch this tent then I will break your hands.
are you jesting or are you speaking the truth?
I am speaking the truth.
then it is fine. Otherwise I don't like these kind of jokes.
Yes!
and yes, if that female never gets married, then for God's sake don't tell me to leave this tent as a wedding memento for her.
when Mangal brother took an oath then every member of the house took an oath that till Shruti doesn't get married till then no one in the house will get married.
why won't they get married?
that was good.
otherwise I wouldn't be capable of marriage by washing the marriage clothes.
but I want this marriage to take place at any cost.
otherwise when will I get married?
according to your age there is only one female who is worth for you.
that moustache guy's wife.
but for her you will have to get rid of that moustache guy!
Hey! Stop talking nonsense!
I like Rupa! Rupa! - Rupa?
what is Rupa?
will you get married to a vest?
shut up! She is not a vest. She wears a skirt and a top.
who is in the kitchen making breads...
who had got you beaten up!
Hey! Stop talking nonsense. Make my drink!
don't yell! Don't yell! I am making. Don't talk.
I think I am very high!
that's why I can hear different kind of voices.
hey you shorty! Either you drink or go to sleep!
I will go to sleep.
Hey! Go to sleep!
what is going on? - Shut up, you dog! Go to sleep.
Hey!
Hey!
there is no one over here to listen to me.
I want to speak.
since so many months I haven't heard my own voice.
is anyone there?
the season is a slayer.
I hope that this disloyal heart doesn't get lost somewhere.
there is a huge dilemma.
I hope that this disloyal heart doesn't get lost somewhere.
neither is there peace nor is there any tranquillity.
for whom I am waiting for?
for whom I am waiting for?
the season is a slayer.
I hope that this disloyal heart doesn't get lost somewhere.
in the laughter of the moon I must sway in it's moonlight.
I must sway in the captivating light.
in the laughter of the moon I must sway in it's moonlight.
I must sway in the captivating light.
if not in love...
so you can't speak but can sing!
stop it. Tell me why did you do this drama?
I know how to get you speaking. Come on.
madam...
where is he gone? - I am down here.
at your feet.
the fact is that I can speak and hear too at times.
I am a dumb guy of a different sort.
to tell you the truth... I have only one kidney.
then why are you dumb? Is your kidney in your mouth?
no... the doctor said that I should not work.
or I might get a heart attack.
so my uncle advised me to act dumb so as to escape work and also win some sympathy.
please let me stay here till my uncle returns with the money.
you can't understand the pain of a guy with just one kidney.
if anyone else comes to know this truth then I shall ensure that no Gujarati in this house gets to drink even water.
what!? And how will you do that?
I will consume poison, jump into this well and kill myself.
OK, we are letting you off this time.
but if anyone else in this house learns the truth about you then you will end up losing your other kidney too. Got it? Go now.
what is it?
last night I dreamt of something. - What kind of dream?
in the dream I saw that the three of us were sitting together and drinking alcohol.
and this dumb guy spoke.
shut up, you dog! Didn't he say the same thing? - Yes.
but how do you know what he was saying in my dream?
you only said that all three of us were sitting together and drinking alcohol in the dream.
then even I will hear. Am I deaf?
Yes!
I am also so foolish!
but in your dream... - I understood. Understood.
it has come. It has come. The message has come.
what message? - The message has come.
see this. Shruti dear's marriage has been fixed.
Mangal has sent the fax.
Shruti madam, your marriage has been fixed! - Hey!
Softly!
first we will take sweets and go and then we will tell her.
come on. - Come on. Yes, come.
Shruti dear!
Shruti dear! Whatever you like from this take it.
I have to give you good news.
she is asking how much of our property have they asked in dowry?
don't worry about that, dear. That Mangal will handle.
here. Have the sweet.
take it, dear.
they have asked for 2 Ahmedabad companies and a lot of property over here.
so this is clear that they don't want Shruti but they want her wealth.
so what is wrong in that?
the tradition of dowry is on since ages.
it's not a new thing.
once they get the property then she will be just a burden.
and Shruti doesn't want to be a burden.
because of this reason should we make Shruti madam sit at home throughout her life.
Mangal must have thought of something and given consent for the marriage, right?
correct! Mangal won't take any decision without thinking.
he has only lived his entire life for you.
Shruti, you must agree to your brother.
why don't you all understand?
she doesn't like all this.
see, we all know that whatever decision Mangal takes only that happens in this house.
then it is better for all of us to agree to what he says.
Hey!
what is this? Is this the time to cry? Come on!
now your marriage has not taken place, right?
come on. Get up! Get up!
me? And talk to your brother?
have I lost my senses?
let anyone tell him anything but he won't understand.
everyone knows that his love for you has increased so much that he has gone mad.
Hey! But you don't worry.
your brother won't come to know and even this marriage will not work out.
I have a plan for that.
Hey!
come here!
tell me. What is it?
what kind of clothes have you worn?
this... this is that body builder's 'kurta'.
I wear it as a nightdress.
why did you call me? - Take this.
why are you showing your teeth?
I... that... I don't accept love letters. I feel shy.
I will hit you one! Talks of love letters. Take this!
what is this? - It is written in Hindi. - That even I understand.
I am Shruti's lover...
it is a message. - We have to send it across to Gujarat.
but I don't have so much time with me that I will give it till Gujarat and come.
you don't need to go to Gujarat.
just once if your voice reaches Gujarat. That is enough.
take this. - My voice...
not this voice. Read it in your original voice.
Hello, I am Jaichand Rathod. Who are you?
some Jaichand Rathod is there. You speak.
you read. - Okay. - Read.
hello. I am Shruti's lover speaking.
okay? - Speak properly.
we are in love since 2 years.
we can't live without each other.
and whoever comes in between and tries to marry Shruti then you will get to see both our dead bodies on the wedding dais.
did you understand? - What!
hey you loud mouth! Will you wake up everyone?
sorry. Who is he?
he is Shruti's to-be husband.
okay. So what did I tell him?
that you and Shruti are lovers. - Is it?
and you both are having an affair since 2 years.
and both of you can't live without each other. - Is it?
and if Jaichand and Shruti get married to each other then he will find both of your dead bodies on this wedding dais.
what!
then their marriage will be broken.
Yes, of course it will be broken.
and only you will be responsible for this.
hey see! This is a sin.
now stop all this here itself!
because if anyone gets to know that you can speak then you will be...
Hey! Listen!
me?
no one is there.
have you sent this message?
in our place we don't get message but Gujarati news.
no, no.
I am talking about love messages not about newspaper.
what are you talking about?
I know about Chocobar, Beer Bar, Birbal Akbar.
I don't know about what you are saying!
see, if you want to write a love letter then write in the language that I will understand.
what?
I mean that now I will read this. You explain me the meaning of this.
okay?
it is the cooker!
in the light.
I am Shruti's lover speaking.
we are in love since 2 years.
we can't live without each other.
and whoever comes in between and tries to...
what did you say, you donkey!
Hey! Where are you running with the letter! Wait!
Hey, Kanhaiya! I am saying wait!
give it to me back or else I won't spare you!
that is my love letter. For the first time someone has written it to me.
Hey, return that back!
that is... Kanhaiya!
good night. l didn't call them here to be humiliated like this!
l didn't call them here to arrange your wedding.
dad, how could you ! this is no way to treat people!
l thought l was pretty civil. l told them who they are...
and where they come from. lt appeared to be necessary l told them what they had in mind was impossible. l told them the truth. Now if they find it offensive, it's their problem.
you're wrong!
Jai's an amazing person ! and l love him!
and we have no problem.
the problem is that you are my daughter!
does that take away my right to fall in love?
you are ungrateful. You don't deserve your family name.
so keep it! Carry your family name. l'll anyway lose it after l marry.
listen, Sandhya... - No.
there, in that British household, that girl kept talking away...
and our son... he remained silent.
the two of them want to get married. - Ma, what's so wrong with it that you...
you hear that?
not for a moment did he consider... what we'd go through.
but there's nothing of the sort, Ma. - Because of you...
we were humiliated today.
are these the values we imparted to you?
we'd be better off had we not sent you abroad to study.
Bravo, my boy! Your ancestors never did it.
but you'll certainly be a slave to the English.
ma, stop it! For God's sake.
Yes, you made a mistake! You shouldn't have sent me out to study.
you ought to kept me right here. On this soil!
and you too ought to have stayed where our roots are!
ln Bihar... Chhapra. Why did you come here?
enough ! nobody talks to her like that!
nobody!
hey... come, sit down.
there's nothing to be upset about. Everything will be all right. l'm not upset...
l know, Jai has lost his way.
but he will still not take a decision that hurts my feelings. l know my son very well. l couldn't sleep last night. - You must be in love. lt's time to elope. - Jai... stop it!
Sophie, don't be upset. We're going to get through this, all right?
and somehow, this was expected. - l know, but it's strange that they should be doing this instead of caring for our happiness.
sometimes l wonder if they've ever been in love. lt's a shock for them. We need to give them some time for it to sink in, l mean, you didn't expect them to dance with joy and fix our wedding date?
or did you expect your dad to wear a dhoti kurta to attend our wedding at a temple?
why don't you bring your mother to the church, wearing a skirt for our wedding?
l can, but for that you have to get me out of here.
no...
you shouldn't have bothered, Mr Besson.
all you had to do was call and l'd have been there.
you are our valued client. What can l do for you?
l need a favour.
looks like you've started a pharmacy here. l hope everything's okay? - Oh, yes, it's Sandhya.
the slightest bit of change in climate and her asthma starts up.
the climate hasn't changed because of your son, has it?
the parking lot. The ice-cream?
Oh... no, it's not because of him.
mr Sinha, l'm afraid, your services are terminated.
we can give you so many reasons, but...
l'm sure you know the real problem.
Yes, l know. l was expecting it. lt's a shame really that a handful still exploit...
and the spineless get exploited.
mr Sinha, once this settles down...
l'm sure we'll find a way to get you back.
that won't be necessary. l would never want to work here again. Thank you.
do not worry. This obstacle will be put off.
this obstacle will not be put off.
ma, l wish to talk to you.
ma, l know you're upset because of me.
but l'm far more upset than you.
and there's no one to speak up for me, to understand my problems. l'm in love with Sophie, Ma.
she has a lot of respect for you, she's very nice. l... l can't leave her! - But you can surely leave us?
you're angry only because l fell in love without asking you, isn't it?
and because she comes from another community and culture?
she's the girl whose horoscope you had matched with mine...
what difference between Sophie Besson and Savitri Pradhan, Ma?
there are differences. Of values, of customs... of the way of life.
something you cannot understand today. And how far will she be able to adjust?
these very customs and traditions will someday become a burden for her.
and she'll leave everything and go away. - She will never leave, Ma.
because she loves me.
and she's willing to do everything to make you happy, Ma.
and what will you do?
after the marriage, will you accompany her to the church, or go to a temple?
will you have your son grow up as a Brahmin...
or have him baptised in the church? Will you call him John? Or Janardhan?
one meal you will feed him with your hand... the other with a fork and knife?
whose customs and traditions will he follow?
my son, a marriage takes place not between two individuals...
it's between two families.
she's not the sort of girl who'd sacrifice her joy and happiness for the sake of her husband and her household. lt's not necessary for you and me to think the same way, Ma?
lt was a different age when two strangers got married...
and then started loving each other. l've fallen in love...
and l want to marry her. l didn't plan all this, Ma!
l haven't done it deliberately!
she has every luxury in the world at her feet...
and she's willing to forsake all that... only for my sake.
because she loves me, Ma! And she's going to keep you happy.
talk to me when you're exorcised of that girl's ghost.
ma, you're just being impossible!
lf you insist on being stubborn, l'm your son too!
ma... l'm going to marry her.
ma, l mean it! l'm going to marry her!
Yes, my son? - Pa... can l meet you?
where are you?
pa, l need your help. l can't figure out... - What's there to figure out?
take me for a friend and tell me what's bothering you?
pa, l love Ma. - She knows that.
no, Pa. She doesn't understand. l don't know when and how, but... l'm in love.
on one hand is Ma... she means the world to me.
on the other hand is Sophie with whom l wish to spend the rest of my life.
somehow l'm torn between the two women l love the most.
this decision...
now look, son. Your mother is not to blame in this.
your mother has spent her entire lifetime waiting for you, for me.
as for you and me, we had a life outside the house where we kept ourselves going.
but her life has always been restricted to the house.
when she even breathed, it was for our sake.
for her, the joy of seeing us coming back home every evening, was enough.
she gladly dedicated an entire lifetime to us.
now she's afraid that Sophie might perhaps...
separate you from her. And she's feeling insecure. That's all.
how about you, Pa?
all l want is that our small family should not be scattered, my son.
Papa... can Sophie be part of our family?
l want to marry her.
will you bring Ma along?
l can't say about your Ma, but you can count on me.
Sandhya... what happened? Are you well?
should l call the doctor? - No, l'm all right.
Jai hasn't returned as yet.
er... don't worry about him, Sandhya l spoke to him, he's staying at a friend's place tonight.
he fought with me today.
C'mon... it happens. He's still a kid. lt's okay. Rest now, okay?
lie down.
namaste, sister-in-law. This is Ashim here. ls Shekhar there?
he's getting ready. Do you want me to call him?
no... just tell him not to worry about anything. lf the management does not reinstate him in his job this very week...
we're all going to resign.
you mean, his job...?
they'll have to give it back to him. We're all standing by Shekhar.
just ask him to talk to me.
where are you going?
mine is a simple life.
from home-to-bank, from bank-to-home... where else?
this is the first time you are lying to me.
brother Ashim had just called.
you're right. lt's the first time l lie to you and l get caught. lt's just that l don't want to be a burden on anyone, Sandhya, l'm the biggest burden on this family.
no, Sandhya. You are not a burden. We live, because you live.
the evil-eye.
someone's evil-eye.
who knows?
maybe it's we who'll have to change our outlook, Sandhya.
Jai is going through a difficult phase...
he doesn't want to hurt you and he's sure that you'll forgive him. l know it'll be difficult for you... - l know you very well.
you will do nothing. l'm the one who's always blamed.
Sandhya, that boy needs us today.
look, do as you want to. l can't accept this decision.
Sandhya... he wants to get married.
parents have always to give in for their children's happiness. l've already told him. l can't see his happiness being ruined.
but Sandhya...
there's nothing you can do. He has made up his mind.
he's getting married today.
Married...? - Your son is getting married!
lt's the biggest day of his life!
lt's the happiest day of his life!
for my sake... please support him. Please.
Hey! Get an ambulance!
l hope you haven't changed your mind?
how could you say that? l'm so jittery.
my heart almost missed a beat.
hang on. l'm just checking on dad. l'll be there in ten minutes.
and then we go to the registrar's office.
okay. l love you. - Me too.
Bozua Banking and lnvestments.
Bozua? Could l speak to Mr Sinha please?
l'm afraid, he doesn't work here anymore.
are you sure? - Yes, l am.
could you connect me to Mr Singh please?
yes? - Jai here, uncle l wanted to talk to Papa, but they say...
they are right
despite working for so long, he was thrown out. All because of you.
because of me? - Yes, he was disgraced because of you.
and you've no idea about it?
great, son. At your age, sons lend support to their fathers. But you...
lt's not fair, Jai.
Hello? - ls Papa home?
the lady suddenly fell ill, so he took her to the Midpoint Hospital.
What...?
l promise, Ma...
l won't do anything against your wishes.
please come back.
angry, are you?
raging.
you are not worried about me.
don't say that l was scared.
you had me scared.
stayed up all night?
ln your son's company. He's here, l know. lt was a bad phase, it's over.
take him home and take some rest. l'm fine. l don't allow visitors in the lntensive Care...
but l see that my patient likes it. l'll look the other way.
you left your home, your parents, your dignity... for what?
for someone who deserted you? Who left you alone on the very street that was named after your family! - Norman, please!
Norman was angry over Sophie's rebellion.
he tells her that the Bessons had never compromised their dignity.
he elicits a promise from Sophie that she'd do nothing again that'd dishonour the family.
Sophie gathers herself up and makes the promise- l promise l won't. l'm so sorry.
Hello? - Gaurav Gulati from lndia.
why don't you call back?
l've been trying since two days. Dumping your friends for Sophie?
dumping Gaurav Gulati, eh?
no pal, l can dump her, not you.
you sound genuine. ls everything all right?
no... just nothing. l just wish you were here.
Jai, are you okay?
Yeah.
what's your name?
l'll tell you if you eat l don't like this food. l don't like it either. lt's bland, right?
very bland.
would you share my food?
hang on.
have it.
delicious. - Just scrambled up a dish.
you are not from here...? - Gayatri Pandey, from Allahabad. l'm here on a medical programme.
what do your parents do?
l was very little when they passed away.
why are you upset?
know what? l was worried more for your folks than you.
you know, you are very lucky? You've got a very caring family.
take care of yourself.
you must come home.
tempting me, eh? l must send you home soon.
thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome.
Hello, doc. - Hello.
how's she? - Much better. You can take her home.
thank you, doc. - l need to thank her.
had something happened to her, it'd have ended my budding career. l'm a celebrity today because of her.
you've no idea what you have done for us.
you've been like... sent by God.
please don't flatter. lf we can do anything for you, please don't forget to tell us.
you are elder to me, please give me your blessings.
thank you, my child. God bless you.
tomorrow is Holi. We're celebrating at home. You must come. " When the drums beat, cymbals tinkle " .
"colours sprinkle, music blares and intoxication sets in, steadily. "
"play colours with your dear ones. "
"play colours with your beloveds. "
"play colours with your dear ones. "
"play colours... "
"come on! "
"Amazing! "
"great music, bro! Awesome! "
"my love, you taught me, the sweet language of love. "
"you light up my nights... "
"you paint my days. "
"l'm robbed of my peace by her sensuous eyes. "
"you should be ashamed to be so overt. "
"you are a cloud on the loose. "
"why will not l speak? l'm not in my senses. "
"lt's the day! lt's not your friend. "
"play it! "
"as the colours fly around, it reminds me of a world of dreams. "
"may you smile, may you find all the joys? "
"that's my only dream. "
"hats off to you, my son. "
"great words indeed. "
"l realise, my child... "
"there is indeed a world of dreams. "
"one world led to another and things have taken a new turn. "
"lt's the day! Everything is brand new. "
you are crazy. You should have at least called her or met her. You should have spoken to her.
what for?
you are not the Jai that l knew anymore.
you are finished. Get up and fight. l did. l was going to marry her. l had a row with Ma, and she landed in hospital.
Papa was disgraced, he lost his job.
and l'm responsible for all that.
you are right. You are finished.
Jai, at least think of Sophie. l'm only thinking of her. l can't give her anything but go away from her.
she's going to hate you for this. - l know.
but the more she hates me, the sooner she will get over me.
my life is ruined as it is. l have no right to ruin hers.
no, Jai, this is wrong. Look...
talk to Sophie. Let me talk to her. - l don't need advise, dude l need a friend!
l'm changing your medication, giving you lighter doses.
tell Jai to take it from the hospital.
thrice a day.
why don't you stay for a while?
have lunch with us. - Thank you.
but l don't want to trouble you. - No trouble at all.
we'll cook together. You will be a great help to me.
one minute. - l'm not a good cook.
at the orphanage we'd just scramble up something. lt'll have to be a crash course.
Why? - l'll be going after two weeks.
time's up.
where to?
back to lndia. lf l have my way, l wouldn't let you go, my child.
must be Jai.
please stir the onions, l'll be right back...
l...
Hi, Ma.
the Power group of hotels has given me the appointment letter. l say, this girl is fantastic... - Which girl?
she's god send.
see... l fall ill, and a doctor comes from far away and saves my life...
Yes, Ma. We can never repay her favour.
there's a way out, son.
you can marry her.
ma, please!
get well, we'll discuss that later.
no, this is the right time, else, it'll be too late. lt's too late.
don't lose heart.
ma, l've erased my past.
but l need some time to compromise with my future.
son, everyone needs a companion.
goddess Gayatri means a lot for the Hindus. This girl is your future.
and fortunately, she stands at our door.
sure Ma, but l'm not ready for marriage yet.
do you trust me? - Yes, but...
Ma- ji... look... - What happened?
what happened?
l'll do it. - l'm sorry.
Hi.
my phone.
Hello? Yeah, l'm coming. l've got to go to the hospital.
Jai, please drop her at the hospital. - Sure l've never cooked. Today l was exposed, l burnt everything.
my image has taken a beating. - No, no.
Gayatri can do no wrong. - And you know the best part?
she actually proposed to me on your behalf.
please don't mind Ma. She says anything without much thought.
you know how mothers are. l can only imagine that. Well, l like her a lot.
she is quite straightforward.
here we are. - Thank you. lt's all right.
thanks once again. Bye. - You're welcome.
Hello? - You're coming, aren't you?
l'm just on my way.
at 4, Le Plaza. Don't be late.
Yeah. l'll see you there. Take care, dude. Bye. l should have known. - Listen, guys. lf l'd have told any one of you, this wouldn't have been possible.
now since you guys are here, why don't you just sort it out?
sort it out? There's nothing to sort out.
you can stay, l'm leaving. - Cool it. l didn't bring you here for this. - He doesn't have a place in my life.
he doesn't exist for me anymore.
Sophie, you are getting it wrong. - Wrong?
maybe you are right. l've been wrong l loved him... that was wrong l left my home, my family for him.
that was wrong l waited all night in a church for him.
and l was wrong.
have you any idea the humiliation l've been through?
he wasn't there to stand by me.
he wasn't there when l needed him the most. l hate him.
Sophie, there's a lot...
you ruined all my efforts.
but you made it easier for me.
you should have told her the facts. - Where's the need, Gaurav?
lt's good for Sophie that... - What are you trying to do?
sacrifice your love and joys and become God? You want to be God?
did you see the state she is in? Have you ever thought about her?
you are bloody selfish ! - Yes, l'm selfish, Gaurav. l can't give anything to Sophie.
but l can at least give something to my parents.
have you ever seen your father disgraced?
have you seen your mother battling against death in the lntensive Care?
you haven't, right?
come what may, if Ma wants me to marry Gayatri, l will.
you're out of your mind, Jai! You will be ruining three lives. l'm not ruining your life though.
you know what? Go to hell! Go and get married! l will! - Go on!
what are you saying? - lt's the truth.
for a moment even l was stunned when Jai told me that he is willing to marry Gayatri.
you have taken a major decision of your life.
you told me, Pa...
crossroads are meant to pause and think.
and this heart just beats, it doesn't think.
besides, l don't want us to walk in parallel and never meet like the railways tracks. " When you were not around... "
"we lacked something. "
"though we were smiling... "
"a teardrop lingered somewhere. "
"now that you are here, love seems to overflow. "
"now that you are here, Spring seems to have set in. "
"now that you've entered our hearts... "
"a thousand emotions rise. "
"we have found new happiness. "
"lt's as if joys have painted our garden. "
"you have fulfilled my desire. "
"l thank you for showing me... "
"dreams, dear ones... "
"and the promises of love. "
"now that you are here, love seems to overflow. "
"the auspicious day is here. "
"l congratulate everyone. "
"time brings along a new life. "
"life comes to a new turn. "
"let bygones be bygones. "
"look someone is waiting for you. "
"now that you are here, Spring seems to have set in. "
o, my eyes, don't let anyone see... "
"my tears. "
"o, my heart, hide my torment from everyone. "
"where are you lost? "
"why are you so silent? "
"how do l tell you... "
"the secrets of my heart? "
"l can't express... "
"the joy l have found... "
"in seeing someone happy today. "
"there's no substitute for her ocean of love. "
"life comes to a new turn. "
"let bygones be bygones. "
"look someone is waiting for you. "
"now that you are here, love seems to overflow. "
"now that you are here, Spring seems to have set in. "
Jai? l don't want to hear that name again ever in my life.
for God's sake, can you please listen to the truth?
the truth is that he loves you.
Sophie... Jai is suffering.
he needs you more than ever.
Really?
can you do me a favour?
could you take me to him?
of course.
Hello? - Still cross with me?
l hope you didn't get married in a rage?
l'm going to marry. - Can't we meet before that?
come down. We'll have lunch together at Marity. l'll be right there. lt's so strange. l don't know what's come over me of late. l've been giving wrong medication to my patients.
somebody is going to die at my hands.
and you know what? You are responsible for that.
me? - Yeah.
because ever since l met you... l've never been so happy in life.
tell you something...
your eyes...
l was really attracted to them.
but there's a strange kind of sadness in them.
and l'll do anything...
anything in the world to get a glint of happiness in your eyes.
and that'd make you so irresistible. l'm a windbag, ain't l? Can't help it l had no one to talk to since childhood. l've always been a listener.
Hi.
come.
Hi.
Sophie, this is Gayatri ... Dr Gayatri Pandey.
she's been taking care of Jai's mother.
this is Sophie. Friend of mine.
should we...?
menu for you, ma'am. - Thank you.
something to drink, sir? - l'll have a beer. l'm fine, thanks.
have something. - No, really l'm fine. Thanks.
could you suggest something? - Why don't you try some...?
thank you. - Thanks.
by the way, Gaurav, why didn't you come for the engagement?
l wasn't invited.
well, those in the family don't need an invitation. Still...
l invite you to my wedding.
excuse me?
please bring her along. l'll write a card for her too.
please do make it for our wedding. - Thank you. ls this all l've been left with?
Lnvitation to his wedding?
why me...?
he was just silent in front of me.
all l wanted to do is to hold him.
he looked so helpless. l know he loves me. l was dying.
Oh, Sophie.
Hi.
been waiting for long?
quite long. - Came to say something?
l came up to your door, but couldn't muster enough courage to ring the bell?
no good ringing now. What do you want to say?
l don't understand...
don't try to understand, just speak your heart out. l can't find words to say what l want to...
maybe l can't even express it. Even if l dare to say it...
l don't know if you'd be able to listen to it.
just try, maybe l'll listen and even understand.
they were going to marry. The news gave his mother a heart-attack.
and now, a son is trying to sacrifice his joys to pay the price to someone for saving his mother's life.
whether you wish to elicit the price or not... is up to you.
you may never forgive me. l'm sorry.
gynaecology
Sophie is pregnant. l don't believe it.
we just got back from the hospital.
for God's sake, talk some sense into her. l was never going to accept this marriage, l'm certainly...
not going to accept this child! - You always do this.
do you want this child to be illegitimate?
lt could be easier to accept Jai.
tell her to get rid of it. - For goodness' sake! lt's a sin.
Sophie has suffered enough. She didn't do this to get back at you.
she is going away. And she is only going to save your embarrassment.
she cares such a lot about you. But right now she is heartbroken.
and she needs all the understanding that we can give her.
what, are you blaming me for all this? You, of all people?
lf she doesn't listen, l'll disown her.
you wouldn't.
you couldn't.
she means the world to you.
everything you've ever done has been for her.
and you tell me you're prepared to lose her?
your grandparents owned slaves, Norman. We don't.
and the next generation doesn't care. lt's time to move on.
Sophie is leaving on the day. Jai is marrying someone else.
time is running out.
you may never see your daughter again. ls that what you really want?
thank you for coming. ln your place, l would not have done. l should have listened to you. l made a mistake. l can understand. lt's not easy.
change never is. But then, that's the only thing that is permanent
mr Sinha...
my daughter is carrying your son's child?
she insists on having it. l don't know how to deal with this. l thought l needed to share with you. l don't know what to do. l love my daughter. l wouldn't have come, but l did it for her. l am sorry.
no... please don't.
don't say that l can...
l can feel your pain, l...
l really feel...
l don't know what to say.
there's a wedding.
and...
l don't know if...
maybe it's too late.
where were you? l've been looking for you.
your sherwani is here. Try it once to see if it fits you right.
what happened? - Don't speak, just listen.
this is something l can only tell you.
you have to decide. Give it a good thought, it concerns someone's life.
what are you saying?
what's the matter? - l'll explain. l never thought you'd do this to me.
how did l harm you?
you say l saved your life.
then why did you do this to me?
what... what are you saying, my child?
don't call me your child. l can't be your daughter.
look... what is she talking?
my child... did l lack somewhere in loving you?
nothing was lacking, but you were selfish.
swear by me...
if l were your daughter, would you marry me off to a man...
who loves someone else?
why did you do this?
and Jai...
your obedient son. He loves someone else.
just to show his devotion to you...
he was willing to marry me.
will the two of us be able to swear to be loyal to each other for lifetimes to come?
God has given you every happiness.
but today you are going to sacrifice everything.
and the greatest truth is...
Sophie is carrying Jai's baby.
what... what are you saying, dear?
lt's the truth.
she's a great woman.
she endured such injustice, yet she is silent.
just because she doesn't want to hurt you. ln her shoes perhaps，l wouldn't have done that. l'm not that great.
you have given me immense love and happiness. l have found a home. lf you don't want me to become an orphan again, please accept the two of them. l'm willing to be your daughter, always.
just accept Sophie as your daughter-in-law.
accept her!
please!
please accept her.
meet my friend Ashim. We have been together for...
l don't understand this story.
lord Clive. He wouldn't speak without firing a cannon is now following Hindu rituals.
please have some champagne.
take it. lt's their custom.
Jai's mother! The unruly queen " This marriage cannot take place! "
she's drinking champagne.
Cheers.
but how did this happen? - Very simple.
Sophie's daddy is a Roman Catholic. Abortion is a sin for them.
and Jai's mother had no choice but to accept Jai's baby.
there was only one way out. l had to lie that Sophie was pregnant.
and everything that happened later, lies before you to see.
great. And nobody told me l had to resort to lying just to unite them.
and if you're not pregnant in three months your dad and Jai's mother are going to kill me.
come here. l didn't hear a thing, my child.
no, you flatter me. There are so many.
you think it's funny? You feel no remorse?
that boy's hand is broken. - Good.
that's the same hand with which he stole.
let's say he did steal, find the evidence. Bring it to court.
why raise your hand? - Dear Lord.
Waghmare has all the time in the worid.
investigate the theft of a cheap radio? Collect evidence?
take him to court in front of a magistrate?
or two siaps, case closed!
you wish to siap me, too, right?
it's natual
if I don't get you suspended, I'll change my name.
fine.
may I suggest "Cherry"?
one more time.
what?
say it one more time.
Jai, let's go.
come here, you rascal! How dare you browbeat a cop?
here, I'll say it again!
cherry!
Gladioli!
Hibiscus!
what?
I forgot, sir!
what were you going to do?
you were going to raise your hand?
on a cop?
he was mistreating with you.
that's my problem.
and by fighting, you wouid've proved him right.
since there's no difference between him and my son.
my son did nothing wrong!
if someone is rude to his mother, shouid he keep mum?
don't start that again, please! - What do you mean "again"?
I mean enough!
I can't argue about this every day.
if you wanted Jai to be like you, you shouidn't have died.
you want him to be a coward? - Yes.
he's the son of Amar Singh Rathore!
that's what I fear!
a fear I've felt since the day you went to fight the Bathwals and never rode back.
so I died fighting!
alone! And I siapped ten Bathwals before I died.
the eleventh struck from behind. Swine!
I wish you had returned after being siapped ten times.
nonsense.
you're a martyr's widow. You shouid be proud!
I will now enter that painting and strangle you!
why am I listening?
good night
remember, Savitri.
soon, Jai will fuifil the three conditions of Ranjhore manhood.
one...
now? - Yes!
he will mount a horse.
two, he will thrash a man.
three, he will go to prison once.
mark my words, Savitri.
these were the rites of passage?
impossible
Jai couid never have done them.
no? did he? Does he?
who will he beat up? That inspector?
will he really go to prison?
Hey, guys, the flight has landed
thank god - An hour late. - So hurry!
they'll arrive and the story won't be complete.
relax, Mala, still procedure, imigration, customs - Exactiy! So tell me quickly! - I need coffee.
you got to be joking.
have coffee later!
what happened, tell me now - Who's popcorn? - Mine!
Shaleen, your samosas.
if we're done stuffing our faces, may we continue, please?
then Jai became elusive, and when we did meet
Meghna was always there.
remember the picnic where Meghna joined us?
impossibIe to forget. Your "Chariot of Fires" ran out of fuel.
and I ran out of fuel trying to hitch a ride!
anyway, Jai and Meghna behaved as If we didn't exist!
hop on!
sometimes noble The heart is often unclean
sometimes a tart yet often pious
how do you trust the wanton heart! How can one trust the heart?
sometimes cold The heart is often cold
sometimes bold yet often an atom bomb
how do you trust this wily soul? How can someone bear this explosion?
the heart Is naive
the heart's mistake is that not a liar it does not know what it desires
the heart Is naive
not a liar
it knows not Its own desire
the secret look Matching the gaze
the stolen gaze and stealing glances
finds Its mark looking at one end
and yet It strays aiming at another
the secret look
the stolen gaze
finds Its mark, And yet It strays
the heart meant well The heart's intention was always righteous
its Intentions were pure understand that the heart's plan was also pious
but old habits die hard If the instinct is philandering, what can it do, without options?
and desire has no cure it belongs to the one it sees
troubles me all day the heart trouble during the day
keeps me up at night the heart keep awake at night
troubles me all day, Keeps me up at night
I wish I knew my heart! O what does it desire?
the secret look
the stolen gaze
finds Its mark And yet It strays
the eyes are filled wlth love, But the heart feels Incomplete someone lives in the eyes, wonder why this heart feels empty
and keeps walking this one way street wonder why this heart is clapping with one hand
the lips speak all, but the heart keeps It a secret wonder what was said with the lips, but the matter of the heart is within the heart
holding your beloved near, Who do you seek here? Here is your journey person, who do you search for in the court of your heart
life Is serious, love precarious, Actually, qulte hilarious life is stuck, how can one not laugh at the state of the heart
the secret look, The stolen gaze
finds Its mark And yet It strays
Papa can't do without mum for a second.
yet they're always bickering.
it's so cute
so this Friday, then?
sure
I'm so excited
it's the first time I've brought a guy home.
you miss Jai?
of cause not
we meet often.
Meghna's always around, though.
I've never seen Jai like this.
so taken up by someone, oblivious to all else.
Jai has always been like this.
except that "someone" was you.
Yeah, one second
what? Dad, is he OK?
mum, I am on my way
I'll be right there.
Where's Jai?
come on, Jai. Have another
no sir, thank you
what a strange lad!
one drink is had only with enemies.
I'm down four, and you're still twirling your first one.
come on, one more. One more!
you promised you'd drink less and eat early.
you still fall for his promises?
silly girl
don't call her a silly girl
you silly woman
you've been promising me for ten years that one day you won't have a headache.
I still have hope. How about that?
stop making fun of mama
no, chiid, let him
it's the only entertainment I've got.
no one watches TV in this house.
he switches it on every evening.
Yes, that's right. I am the clawn
I am the clawn that everybody laugh at me
come on, Jai, laugh
if you don't, she'll think you have a problem.
stop it, you two
dad, let's have dinner
don't worry, Jai
he's only had five small drinks.
Shambhu, serve the food! The master's done drinking.
dad, you're feeding your shirt more than yourseif!
he's so funny
how's the food, Jai?
it's exellent, aunty
please, call me Sheela
don't flirt with kids..."Sheela"!
he's your daughter's boyfriend. Spare him.
yes Mama, no flirting with my boyfriend
everyone at the club has a crush on you.
he's mine, all mine
memories of youth.
when you looked upon me with love.
love is for the young
after 25 years of marriage, tolerating each other is good enough.
and if one can't tolerate, one learns to ignore, yes?
Oh god, you two are so cute
so, did you like the food?
and my folks?
nice.
they are really nice
they are gorgerous
they bicker so much but can't do without each other.
sometimes I feel so overwhelmed at their love.
I am so silly, good night Jai - What are you doing here? - Is Aditi here?
Why? Is your girifriend asieep?
ask your friends to look at the time before showing up.
what's up, Jai?
nothing just...just want to wish you
sorry, I couidn't come to the party.
Hey, seriously sorry
I'd promised Meghna.
Hey, it's still your birthday.
I know.
let's spend tomorrow together, just you and me.
we'll hang out, watch a film, have dinner...
we used to hang out together because we liked it.
not because it was duty or an obiigation.
so please, don't insult me by apologising.
you wanted to go to Meghna's house, and you did.
simple
wasn't it your parents' idea, giving each other space?
don't worry, we'll find you a stud. Then you'll vanish, too...
rats, just...
don't do me any favours. I can find myseif a guy.
in fact, I'm meeting someone tomorrow.
dad's friend's son.
so don't bother, all right?
that's great
congratulations
I hope you like him.
it's late. I shouid get some sieep.
stupid, bloody stupid
why doesn't she tell him?
the arrogance of "just friendship."
and this son of her dad's friend, it's a lie, right?
exactly the type of guy Aditi wanted.
so do you ever do any work?
I'm at work at 8: 00 sharp.
doesn't look like it. Your life seems like a holiday.
not one holiday but many small ones.
with lots of restaurants, because I love food.
and a few parties, because I like a drink sometimes.
what do you like?
travelling - Ever tried bungee jumping? - Not yet.
first holiday... bungee jumping.
Whoa! You're planning our life already?
you don't have to marry me. Come with friends.
black belt?
is it for real?
let's just say
when you're with me... no one will mess with you.
what?
nothing
ex-girlfriend?
not all. I think Sunita was just a friend.
it's all your fault.
you didn't meet me at sixteen.
are you threatening me?
warning, my foot!
remember, I've had you suspended for only a week.
call my home again and I swear I'll have you dismissed.
drunk jerk. - inspector Waghnare strikes again
water?
some to drink and some to flush down Waghmare.
Jai, Aditi had called.
when?
this afternoon. Buy a mobile, won't you?
I don't need it, mom
maybe when I get a job.
Hi, Meow! You called?
Yes. I have some good news.
you're getting married?
I am engaged
that's great, congratulations - What's his name? - Sushant. Sushant Modi.
congratulations, I wish you all the happiness in the world
have to run. Goodnight.
interviews start tomorrow.
I wouid love to get a job in marketing.
what do you feel like eating?
leftovers?
I'm in the mood to cook. State your wish.
samosas!
mom, guess what?
Aditi's engaged.
I heard.
silly boy
Rotlu! When he's happy, we wonder what's wrong!
and his girifriend, Bombs.
though her plane needs two runways to take off.
Meaning? - She's a bit siow.
stop it. - what?
and Jai. That's it, that's our group.
so when am I meeting them? - After the wedding.
or else you'll definitely run away!
let's not go inside. - Why?
just trust me
tell me why. My friends are waiting inside.
see those horses?
two lunatics ride them.
they started a fight the last time.
and I'm sure they'll create a problem tonight, too.
problems I can handle.
ex-girlfriend
she still likes you.
only after two drinks.
sorry - What for? - I shouidn't have called her.
she's a friend, right?
friends are always special.
come on.
leave me alone
what's your problem if she wants to dance?
Hey, stay out of this - I'll thrash that English out of you! - Really?
richa just can't handle her drink.
did you need to handle her?
I was just trying to protect her
Yeah, I know
was I wrong?
how was the party? Did you have fun?
dinner? - We've eaten, thank you.
would you like some wine?
you're Amit, right?
has he lost it?
Why?
marrying Aditi! Very brave.
come on, it's late.
dad, I'm meeting Sushant for the first time.
he's tired, son. Next time... - I'm fine.
I was eager to meet him, too.
he's almost my brother now.
so, Amit, what do you do? - Read books.
listen to music. Watch films.
what about work? - Nothing at all.
the only advantage of being rich. - That shouidn't be the case.
a man's work is his identity.
he paints.
don't you, son?
Really? An artist
just doodles.
come on, I'll show you
Amit's never shown me his room.
I haven't seen it either.
amit likes Sushant!
your son is a genius - You must be so proud of him. - Thanks, bro-in-law!
Bro-in-law?
how sweet
OK, I'll be off. Good night
good night son
thank you for the painting, Amit
Bye, bro-in-law!
you gave Sushant a painting?
Sushant is nice, isn't he?
you've never seen my room, right?
Amit, you are a genius
what are you doing, Aditi?
you want to marry him?
Meaning? - Listen to me, Aditi.
Sushant is not a nice guy.
he's mean, he's arogant, he's selfish - He cares only for himseif. - What are you saying?
come and sit down.
don't you know you're in love with Jai?
that you can only be happy with him?
you stupid, stupid girl
Amit, I thought you didn't like Jai.
I thought you hate him!
of cause I hate him
my parents keep wishing they had a son like him.
my own sister... my best friend, loves him more.
of cause I hate him
I know why.
because he's... he's...
a wonderful guy!
I know.
but he likes Meghna.
and I'm to marry Sushant.
Jai loves you.
maybe he doesn't realise it. Like you didn't.
you two are meant for each other
that's tricky. I've an interview the next morning.
Hey, don't do this. It's my surprise birthday party.
even Aditi can't make It! - Why isn't she coming?
Sushant's friend is throwing a party. - Well, I'll try.
if I can make it, I'll come.
bummer!
what did he say? - He said bugger off!
so... tell me.
what? - About your past.
what past?
boyfriend, crush, affair maybe...
Sushant, please
Hey, why be coy?
everybody have a past
didn't you ever like someone?
once. In school.
when I toid him, he went crying to the teacher. OK?
and in your group? No special friend?
one you liked more than others?
Sushant, what's your problem?
your litlie black book is like an epic.
and you ask me about friends?
Yes, there was one.
a very special friend.
his name is Jai.
and we were so close, people thought we were having an affair. Happy?
well? - Well what?
well, were you?
Oh God, no
so why haven't I met him?
because college is over and everyone's busy.
plus he's got a girifriend.
how are you doing babe?
I am doing good
this is Vikram, my boyfriend. Sushant...
boyfriend, huh?
congratulations
so you've finally got over me.
Hey, Vikram, look after her, man.
she was my most special girifriend.
sure, see you wait a minute
Richa, one dance, old friend sake?
what haven't we shared, to shy away from a dance?
we shouid go. - Wait a minute. One dance, babes.
hands off.
chill, buddy. You're a chapter. I'm the story.
I'm suitably impressed. Now let her go.
go to hell, man
I was high.
then let me drive, please. - I'm fine now.
no, it's late, Jiggy! I'm going home.
jiggy, stop it
talk to you later. Goodnight.
what's up?
party at my friend's place.
let's go. I can meet your friends. - Not tonight!
come on, are you ashamed of me?
I insist. Say where.
will Jai be there?
no idea.
what's up with Jai?
I know. He hasn't smiled all evening.
another whiner? I'm feeling insecure.
my financee
I know.
congratulations
so... you two were close friends in college, right?
we still are.
always will be.
lady, you are fully beatiful
a drink, Sushant?
Sushant will think we're a morose bunch.
come on, everybody, on the floor
Jai, you too.
no thanks, I don't dance
what happened? You were dying to dance a while back?
who did that? - Oh... Mr T!
this one's for you
dim the lights!
cool!
somewhere
somewhere it must be...
the world, where you'll be with me...
where me, and where you...
... and where...
... only the feelings of our love reign supreme where my morning will have a sunrise...
... with the rays from your eyes on me...
and lullabies of the moon...
...I'll get to hear in your arms...
dunno where that world lies...
dunno if it even exists or not...
where my life wouldn't be...
...so upset with me myself...
are you OK?
Jai, what's this?
it's a scooter
can't a scooter just be a scooter for a while?
there's no romantic story here.
a middie class man rides it to work. That's it!
I'm sorry
I was just trying to cheer you up
I know...
why are you so upset?
forget it
no. Tell me.
tell me, Jai
sometimes I feel you can't see reality. Or you can't face it.
I don't know what are you talking about?
forget it. - No
I want to know.
just because I ask what's this?
well, then?
everything. - For example?
take your parents for example
I'm sorry, but it didn't look like they can't live without each other.
frankly, I feel that they... - Shut up!
dad had an affair.
mom left home.
she came back just for me.
they used to fight like animals everyday.
the abuse, the violence...
alone in my room, I couid hear it all.
what couid I do?
the two people I loved most...
...were miserabie.
all because of me.
all the time. Every minute.
so... I stopped seeing and thinking.
I assured myseif that they were happy, that they loved each other.
and that all was well with the worid.
if you shut your eyes and can't see the worid...
...it doesn't mean that the worid can't see you.
that's true. I've shut my eyes tight.
and sure... I'll have to face reality someday.
but please do me a favour
don't force me to open my eyes yet.
I am not ready
good night, Jai
what happened?
nothing.
how was the party?
all right.
Aditi was there?
with her fiance?
there, there. Enough, child.
Jai, Meghna's here.
good morning
some tea?
no thanks Aunty
what's up?
Jai... I've been thinking.
I've realised that you're in love with Aditi.
frankly... you two are just perfect.
you really shouid marry Aditi.
I am so sorry
look at you!
how couid you fall for that?
no, I'm sorry
what you said is true.
I do love Aditi.
come on, now you are joking
I guess I knew.
just checking. - No, I...
what's this?
it's a good bye
poor thing! She must have been shattered, right?
shattered and smashed
that night she went out drinking with some friends...
where she bumped into Aditi and Sushant.
jiggy, tell her what Aditi and Sushant were talking about then.
sorry. Aditi was off to the US for a fortnight. She'd even got her visa.
what? It's not that simple.
but she wanted to stay on a bit longer.
Why?
new York University has a film-making course.
since I'm going there, I might as well apply.
how long is the course?
three years.
you want to live in New York for three years after marriage.
actually, I was wondering... what if I did the course first?
I mean, I am just 21
what's the rush?
how are you?
Where's Jai?
haven't you heard?
we're not together anymore.
Why?
the oidest story in the worid.
he's in love with someone else.
with who?
Bye, Aditi - Who was she referring to? - I don't know!
you don't know - I don't know, Sushant
your best friend and you expect me to believe that?
why does this even concern us?
what the hell are we fighting, damn it?
you said you two were close, right?
even your parents thought you wanted to get married!
so what?
so just tell me, damn it
did you like him? Were you in love with him?
that's it, I am leaving
don't try to ignore me, Aditi!
let go of my hand, Sushant. You're hurting me!
I'm the one who's hurting.
just...just tell me
were you in love with him?
tell me, Aditi.
just tell me this once. I promise I'll never bring it up again.
I don't know
I don't know, Sushant
I don't know if it was love or something else!
I don't know
you know now, don't you?
answer me.
you're in love with him, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes, I'm in love...
the breaths are lost waiting for someone...
dunno whose embrace has got me all lost in dreams...
that now I am in search of ways from my destinations...
while the destination itself seems to be lost in the tracks
somewhere, somewhere
hides the magic of our every meeting our meetings get us into a high of love...
what are you doing here?
just to look a chance
I went to your place. Your parents didn't know where you were.
I called Shaleen, the gang... no one had a clue.
Oh, my phone's at home.
anyway, I'm glad you're here.
I got a chance to say good bye
I'm off to the US tonight.
and if I hadn't come?
it's just a holiday
I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
you're going for three years. - What three years?
getting into NYU isn't easy.
what's the matter?
something's wrong
why are you leaving?
I just need to be alone for a while.
problems with Sushant?
isn't he bothered that you're leaving for three?
you broke up with him
Yes, I broke up with him
I don't think I'm ready for this marriage business.
why didn't you tell me?
did you tell me?
I found you the wrong girl...
terrible ...and me the wrong guy.
I just messed up, rats
I think I need some time off
you're running away.
Aditi Mahant. The biack Cat.
the ultimate fighter
is running away
yes I am running away, rats
and you know what
sometimes it's all you can do
what happened?
what? Nothing.
who did that?
Sushant? Did he hit you?
damn it, Jai, I said nothing happened!
I had a scrap with Amit. He was ranting, so I hammered him.
look. It's getting late, honestiy.
I'll call you, OK?
is Sushant home? - Yes. And you are?
I'm a friend of Aditi.
I just don't understand what's going on
maybe you can reason with them.
please sit down, I'll call him
a friend of Aditi's is here.
coming down?
what's your name again?
may I speak with him in private?
what do you want?
did you raise your hand to Aditi?
why did you do it?
Jai, you have no idea how much fun I'm having.
spare yourseif and get lost!
you shouidn't have touched Aditi.
Amar, have you seen my glasses?
sorry, mom
he hurt Aditi.
mum, I'm going to meet Aditi.
it won't happen again.
I swear
look at this.
can we discuss this later?
I have to go.
I have to stop her.
how can I let her go? I love her.
so finally
how will you get back?
there's a transport strike after midnight. No buses or cabs.
jiggy will drop me. May I go?
promise me... never again.
never.
today's my happy birthday.
and you, sunny boy... you're my birthday present.
where are you taking him?
inspector Waghware
but how?
Sushant's dad!
I can't believe Jai beat up Sushant at his own house!
so much for Sushant's biack belt!
Jai is a Rathore!
a Rathore from Ranjhore!
so he went to prison?
that's two conditions down!
inspector, please
please let me make just one call
how can I?
what if you called the Prime Minister? Then I'd have to let you go.
how can I spoil my birthday party?
please, just one call.
then you may do what you like with me.
I may?
such respect confuses me.
you stood eye to eye with me and said, "Say that again.
Hey, shut up!
I knew right then you had a violent streak.
all right, tell me, who will you call?
there's this girl... - A girl.
a female friend.
why at this hour?
if I don't call her, she'll leave for America.
and if you call, she won't? - No.
Why? - Because she loves me.
but she doesn't know that I...
a case of love!
Bravo, Waghmare! Happy birthday to me!
I've spoken to Mr Sinha. He'll meet us at the police station.
will you pick me up?
please immediately, huh?
listen... shouid we take some cash?
Waghmare will vent all his frustration on my baby.
busy
Aditi, it's time to leave.
sure you wanna go?
and stay for what?
what time's the flight?
there...
there's that violent streak again. Dangerous bioody fellow!
what's going on?
Oh, Brother Ballu! - Bagheera, we're home!
Congratulations!
what's all this?
drinking and causing mayhem. Beating up two fellows.
one in hospital. The second, too traumatised to report.
you Bombayites are total wimps.
so why file a case?
send them off with a warning. - Heaven forbid! The effort it took...
sir has spoken. You are warned. Now get going!
brother Ballu...
age before attitude.
Thanks, Dirty Harry!
photo
mine, too!
this fellow looks familiar...
bro! It's the guy who conned us.
that AIDS chick!
well done
hats off! We value a brain.
we even have one between us.
shake hands, kiddo!
may I ask why you're both so ecstatic?
what's the deal?
what's your name?
so, Jai, the thing is, today we go from boys to men!
it's an ancient family tradition.
to become a man, one must fuifil three conditions.
one... - Horse riding.
two? - Thrash someone.
and three?
go to prison! Rathores from Ranjhore?
yes
but how, why?
Ballu's dad was elected to Parliament, so no one dared arrest them there.
if they assaulted someone, the cops said, "Bravo, Your Highness,
and siapped the victim some more.
get the picture? Laughing stock of the family, we were.
so we reckoned, "Hey, no one knows us in Bombay!"
and here we are, in jail.
Ballu's right, no jail for us in Ranjhore.
Ranjhore? In Rajasthan?
Yes, why? - My father was from Ranjhore.
and your father was?
you are Jai Singh Rathore... son of Amar Singh Rathore?
Yes.
and your father?
he died when I was five.
is your mother's name Savitri?
how do you know?
recognise us?
I'm Kuber Singh Rathore. This is Vinay Singh Rathore!
brother Ballu? Brother Bagheera?
once their excitement abated, they began narrating the exploits of Amar Singh.
legend has it he couid tackle a wiid boar with his bare hands.
and he'd siapped pretty much every man in Ranjhore.
and what a death! Right, Ballu? A glorious death!
unarmed, alone, he stormed the Bathwal mansion, and siapped them senseless.
true!
the Terror of Ranjhore, Amar Singh!
even today his name lives on.
what are you thinking about? - Nothing.
come on, spit it out.
you know how he hated violence.
the tragedy, Jai, is that you can even dream it.
has he lost it?
what is it, then?
nothing - Do me a favour? - Take two.

you don't mean Ajay Roshanlal Sehgal? - Yes, so?
Why? Is something wrong?

Yes, yes... Listen, Raj...
my blood pressure's rising. Tell me plainly...

who he's ditching to marry Nikki
what? - Please forgive him
forgive him?
uncle, you promised. He's one in a million
are you sure?
I heard it from the horse's mouth. - Ajay told you?
no. The broken-hearted one...
why doesn't Ajay marry that one?
he wanted to
but couldn't hurt his parents "He sacrificed his love for them - Meaning, he still loves...
one in a million, right?
so tell me- who is my daughter's rival?
michael
Michael? - Yes... Michael "These Americans are strange. In India, Michael is a boy's name
in America too. - What?
uncle, Michael is a guy
michael is a man...
big moustache and all. - He can't marry my daughter.
you promised. - To hell with my promise
there's no way I'll allow this marriage
but he's one in a million. - Such guys are one in a million
two. - Shut up.
uncle...
what's wrong with this dress? - So cute "Very nice. Ajay, please, I'm not interested
nice outfit.
puja, what if Namrata doesn't show up with her clothes?
you'll have to wear something. - You look beautiful
thank you Aria. - Superb!
what style, what attitude...
you're dressed just right - Exactly. But Nikki doesn't like it "Didi, even Papa approves
Papa, tell her it's a lovely outfit.
come here
meet our sister's prince charming
he's no prince. He's a queen
sorry? - The wedding's off.
I don't understand. - But I've understood "What's the matter, Papa-ji?
scoundrel. Calls me Papa - Papa, what's come over you?
Nikki, one minute. Relax, Uncle
Raj, what are you up to? - I've made sure you're free.
you're behind this. - Of course.
Raj, I love Ajay
what?
Pooja, dear... go inside.
what are you doing?
you go too - But...
take the clothes too. Take them
you lied to me? - How else could I get you here?
so I have to tell uncle...
I'm history
you made a fool of your Uncle!
don't take it personally, Ajay
tomorrow's the engagement. Do come
just a minute
tell me- who loves Michael?
no one
Nikki! You're not ready yet?
Namrata was to bring my outfit "And the matching jewellery, shoes, and everything
she's not here yet. I told you...
not to send her to America before my engagement
she was expected yesterday
everyone's waiting. Wear something else
never. I'll wear only that outfit
so if she doesn't come your engagement's off?
Raj, this is my elder brother and my sister-in-law
what's wrong, Raj? - Nothing
if you'd come any later, the engagement would've been off.
sorry, sir. I'd checked in and...
later! Get her ready quickly. I'll attend to the guests
you're so late
what happened to you? - When I reached the airport...
Raj, meet the Malhotras... and their daughter Rani
talk to her.
say something
where do you stay?
nearby...
on MG Road... - And you?
in a house. I can't live on the road
he's always joking "Uncle, I'm serious
you? - You?
I can't believe it - Nor can I
you know each other? - I was telling you about the airport
Namrata designed it
how is he? Babloo?
Babloo? He's well.
which Babloo?
Ajay. He's been searching for you.
Nikki's here
must be around. I'll fetch her
one minute
I can't find Nikki or Ajay. Where are they?
right here "Namrata, it's a beautiful outfit.
have you met?
the most talented designer in our office, Namrata
my nephew Raj. He lives in America and thinks he's too cool to marry
but he's...
going to get married this time. He won't escape
it's getting late
come along
do you know why I was delayed?
this man had to rush back to tend to his sick son Babloo "Look, I had to get to Nikki's engagement...
admit that it was a good idea
so you have no sense of humour? It's not your fault
girls are deficient in that department "Only guys are smart, right?
Nikki, you should stand by him
but Namrata was so late
all because you
don't listen to these guys. They're all liars.
come on... listen to me...
what is it?
listen carefully then tell me what you think
why are women so arrogant, vain and stuck up
we're just being nice to you, so why the attitude?
you listen to me...
what would you like to say?
we're not like that
but even if we were
so what?
why shouldn't we be proud or even arrogant
when we have the world at our feet
and our beauty drives you crazy
even when we break your hearts "You must admit we do it with a certain charm
we hope you got the answer You were looking for...
listen to me...
let me tell you, the secret of your beauty
and your charm?
it is we who behold the magic in your mundane acts
and honor your silly tantrums with attention
it is we who call your smallest virtue sublime
and make your ordinary looks legendary
your beauty remains unmatched only in the eyes of the beholder "Without us, where would you be?
if you think...
that we owe our looks to you then it's clear that your beauty has you "so intoxicated that you cannot think straight
otherwise, why would you
talk such rubbish?
obviously you missed the point... Nevermind
if you want to be vain that's fine
but don't forget
that the glow on your face "only reflects the fire of our passions
for the world to see
it's not surprising we've cast a spell on you "with our petal-soft skin lips like buds
and hair so dark and fragrant like the night
but we're the ones who "Compared your lips to buds and your skin to blossoms
it is we who respond to your glance as if it's magical
and your words as if they're poetry
and it's we who see the mystery of the night in your hair
if we were not to look at it to love it and to worship it
who would call an idol made of stone
a god
will you listen to me?
what's left to say?
come on... listen to me...
but at least listen...
maybe later... if I have the time
but...
I like this one... - Her nose is too large
her bank balance is larger "Let it be, Dad. Raj doesn't want to marry.
a man's life is incomplete until he's marries "After that, it's finished!
see this one
I'm the umpire. You are out. Your wicket has fallen
get this straight. My wicket cannot fall
this time I have such winners lined up that you'll be bowled over
these are our future sisters-in-law?
Yes. - Not all, stupid. Just one
Raj, take a look
poonam, an interior designer
Reshma, MBA. Kavita, Priya...
Rachna, who you'll meet this evening
who said so? - I did "I didn't, did I? - But you've to listen to what I say
how can you decide without asking me?
I've asked you so often- you never reply "But, I don't... - No buts. Pick one of these five,
we can have a joint wedding - Nikki and you combined
buy one get one free!
this isn't a money-saving scheme. It's my whole life on the line
exactly. I'm doing this for your happiness.
after all I'm like a father to you. - But you're not my father!
uncle!
Nikki, make him understand...
you upset him. You pacify him
I've convinced the American buyers to see our collection
they will be here on the 19th. I'm sure we'll get the order "After such a successful trip, can I expect a promotion?
who do you young people think you are?
you know it all!
our generation, it seems, knows nothing
uncle, you misunderstood. We're nothing without you.
sir, I'll be back later
you stay here "Sit. - Yes, sir
I'd rather talk to you in private "Sir, I'll come back... - Sit
Yes, sir
tell this young man, I've heard enough from him
uncle, I didn't mean it. Don't be angry, please
me? Ask him...
what right I have to be angry with him "Uncle, you've always treated me like a son
and I've regarded you as a father.
so, ask him... Will he see the girls?
sir? - No, Uncle
fine. Namrata, you were saying...
you come here
sit... and listen "I said to this gentleman, you're old enough now...
meet some girls. If you like one, marry her
did I say something wrong? - Not at all, sir
look, I'm not against marriage. - Then...
ask him what the problem is.
explain to him... Please. - What?
that it's absurd to meet a girl with hordes of her relatives around
how can I talk to her?
sir, I think he wants to meet the girls in private
what?
this is not America. All that doesn't work here
that's the problem... I can't have a heart-to-heart
why not send Nikki with Raj?
you'll manage a heart to heart with Nikki there, surely?
Nikki's caught up with wedding preparations.
otherwise, it was a good idea. - Sir, you could send someone else
who?
he won't take me along.
puja and Aria are too young. And he doesn't know anyone else.
so the bride hunt is off!
wait
Namrata will go with you "But, a family member should be present
don't worry. I'll take care of all that.
but, sir... - You want a promotion, right?
get started "But, Uncle... - Now what?
nothing... Can I go?
you chose to meet Rachna at a temple?
with you and uncle against me. I need God on my side.
you're sure that immersing a silver coin...
makes a wish come true? - 100 percent
you know the stable behind our house... Gulab Singh's?
Yes. - His horse, Lovely...
the black one? - No, the white. A major problem.
no offspring. So he threw coins in here and got twins "Gulab Singh got twins? - No, the horse did
how did the horse throw the coins? - Gulab Singh did that
I see. - How much is a silver coin?
rs 101
give him the money, quick. Hurry or we'll lose our turn
the money's with you, how can I pay him?
I kept the cash in my socks and left my socks in the car
how ridiculous! Hiding money in your socks. Go and get it
I'm going - I'll stand in the queue
we mustn't lose our place "The keys are with me. Here, catch.
avoid brawls in temples... - Sardarji just grabbed my hand
what?
brother, I tried to catch my keys and caught sister-in-law's hand instead
I'm not your sister-in-law. - I'm no villain
we've come from miles away to immerse coins and make our wish come true
me and my Mrs... Minty come quickly
what's the matter?
this man claims I grabbed his wife's hand "Not my wife, my sister-in-law. - I am not your sister in law!
OK... sister. Forgive me.
please forgive him. I'm his wife Minty "He didn't mean it - He doesn't act fresh, even with me
Rachna?
go make a phone call... - To whom?
anyone "Uncle, of course
I wanted to ask- Why meet at a temple?
you believe in re-birth?
what? I mean...
what happens after death? - How would I know?
I haven't experienced death.
no?
you mean that I have?
you don't remember? - What?
you fell from a cliff
we went as pilgrims to Kedarnath.
Babloo was with us
our beloved child "Remember, he was so thirsty that day
you handed him to me.
and set out to get water for him
you never came back "Three days later, We discovered your corpse!
my corpse?
don't worry, I never remarried.
I took good care of Babloo "Do you know, he's a vegetable vendor now!
when you were about to be reborn "so I jumped off the same cliff to end my life, Savitri
Savitri? - Yes, Savi.
true love has reunited us. Now Kishen won't lose his Savi "Come, Savi. The temple's here. We can get married at once
one minute... I'll take off my shoes...
Savi?
what's the matter? - He's crazy.
why introduce me to this lunatic?
why did I get involved with you? - Who told you to get involved?
you two are fighting again?
it happens when you're just married. Don't worry.
you'll get used to it soon.
I've upset her again
let's go. Where are the keys?
here. - This is a coin
so I threw the keys in the water. - Oh God!
I think that Raj really does not want to marry
we shouldn't force him. - That's not it
the problem is that he's never met someone he connects with "Next time, take him to a cool place
get him in the mood...
I knew you'd like this place "Raj, come on. - Where?
I told Poonam we'll meet upstairs "It's less crowded, you two can talk and...
you take such good care of me!
Poonam's an interior designer. She studied in New York
what's that famous college called? - Gaitonde Institute of Design
stop kidding. - I'm listening. I went to NYU "If you don't know anything about Poonam, how will you talk to her?
I know what to say. - That's what I'm afraid of.
there's Poonam. Doesn't she look cute?
my friends call me Pony
when you let down your hair what do they call you?
pony!
what will you have? - Vodka!
sir, this is not your drink, sir - Put it down
first ask Pony what she'd like?
what will you drink?
no hard drinks for me. One Virgin Pina Colada
one Virgin Pony Colada...
and you, Namrata? - A Coke. No ice
you need to make a phone call
I did already
what are your hobbies?
checking out potential brides.
I come here every summer and meet a line-up of girls
it keeps my Uncle happy. He considers his time well-spent
I cannot marry you "I can't marry you either, I'm so happy to hear you say...
why did you have to hurt her feelings?
sir, your drinks. - Under the table
that's not it... It's him.
the one in the ugly shirt? - In the grey jacket... Vikram
my first and only love
what happened to him? - When we last met we had a big fight
he didn't like my dress. Know what he said?
pony, I can find thousands like you! Can you believe it?
so I told him that I could find thousands like him
I thought I'd marry someone else And teach him a lesson...
but the truth is really I love Vikram
I cannot live without him. I swear
thank god. - What?
don't worry, Pony, we won't let you die
but what can you do?
from the moment I saw you today
from the moment I saw you today
the stars shone brighter "My whole world changed- The moment I saw you
from the moment I saw you today
the stars shone brighter "My whole world changed- The moment I saw you
you are my love...
you are the one I dream of
you mean the life to me. In you, I find my peace
you are my love, my beloved...
you are the sweetheart I think of all day and night
you are my desire. You are my goal...
you are the one who possesses me in heart and soul
you are the only one I seek, the only one I know
from the moment I saw you today
the stars shone brighter "My whole world changed- The moment I saw you
you are my desire, you are my friend, my beloved
you are the one I worship... my heart is yours
you are the form, you are the hues. You are the scorching sun and the shade
you are a bewitching beauty who wields the magic
you are the only one my eyes follow
why do I get the feeling... - Some things are meant to be "It's true, isn't it
Meaning? - You don't think so?
think what?
if we hadn't met today...
then maybe Pony and Vikram wouldn't have met
pony and Vikram ...how lucky they are
you think they truly love each other?
how can one tell it's true love?
you just know
when you can't sleep at night
and each day seems endless without that person
why must he send roses every single day?
when you grow up, you'll get roses every day too
Why?
when a boy sends roses to a girl, it means...
I love you "Raj, you're in love, aren't you?
who's she?
can you keep a secret?
tell me...
Namrata!
Raj, you there yet? - Where are you?
in the office... - Still?
I'll leave in ten minutes. Chat with Kavita till then
Kavita?
I liked you the minute I saw your picture...
but how did you know what I like...
like what? - This
I've no idea
you guessed? - No
why put it there? Give it to who it's meant for "Don't worry, I will

I'm Raj. I'm from America. You?
I'm Adi. From St. Peter's Boarding School "Now we're not strangers, right?
ADI, please help me... I'll buy you an ice-cream
in that case, what can I do?
you're forward...
my new mummy!
when are you coming home to stay with us
we'll have lots of fun
that's not your mummy. This one is "My new mummy, when are you moving in with us...
we'll have so much fun together. What?
poor boy.
ever since his mother left us, he imagines that every woman is his mother.
he misses a mother's love desperately. - You're married?
and divorced. I'm available.
enough? - See how much he loves you already!
we'll make a happy foursome.
four? - Yes, his brother's at home: Babloo
you gave me a scare!
ADI, give me those photos
no
then you know what you won't get after lunch...
what are you cooking?
Didi, tell them both to listen to me
Puja's in charge today. You two must listen to her
understood? - Never!
Never!
this paneer is delicious. I wish I didn't have to go to Ajay's for lunch.
their food is quite bad. - What a good daughter-in-law!
who are these moustachioed girls? - Brides for your darling brother
but he doesn't need to meet any
Why?
he didn't tell you? - Raj likes someone?
I can't say a word. I promised him "And I did nothing for him, why should he tell me?
if he won't tell you, who will he tell?
tell me who she is
when you steal a glance at me
you leave me breathless
when you play with a straying hair
you leave me breathless
when you look at me that way
you leave me breathless
when you show your love so openly
you leave me breathless "You possess every quality, my love...
the innocence, the freshness, the mischief, the naivete...
you are the one I have given my heart to
my freshness is thanks to you "Thanks to your love, I am beautiful
every hue, I have got from you
when you feel shy at my praise...
you leave me breathless "When you laugh, when you put on airs...
you leave me breathless
why do you look lost?
what thoughts are you lost in?
that which is in your heart, tell me too
I wonder how I must address you
my beautiful one...? Or my beloved?
but those are already your names
when you tell me I have so many names...
you leave me breathless
my birds!
you brat, why are you doing this?
I'll lock you in this cage for the rest of your life!
where did you go...
ADI, what's up? - Where's that rascal?
you're the rascal! - I won't let you go
who are you? - His father
he won't let you go!
I've travelled long and far, and scaled the Himalayan peaks...
to catch each little bird. And your brat...
sorry, your little darling, let them all fly away
I've lost everything...
he's lying! He catches the birds right here and spray-paints them
hey...
tell me
how can such a small boy open such a complicated cage?
sir, he did. - Can't be
I swear on the open cage that he did...
don't believe it. - He opened it, I swear
I don't believe it. - Shall I show you?
ADI, show us - Brat
dear child, show your daddy how clever you are
how you opened the cage and let the birds out
show us
my birds... My bread-winners...
are gone, thanks to him.
what's this, sir?
you ok now? - Thank you, sir.
this time I'm being kind- - To the birds?
no, to you. If I see you with this cage again...
I'll spray-paint you till you're one of the birds. Understood?
lower your lungi. And get going...
this is a decent neighbourhood.
let me treat you today "Some other time, okay?
what you doing here? - I was looking for you.
I believe you told Nikki you like someone "And you didn't tell me? Actually, Namrata, l...
mom, look at all the fish...
there's so many! - What if something happened?
look - What if you'd fallen in?
Raj's my friend - we've met before
you know my son?
don't tell her where we met. That's our secret,
come home and we'll see who keeps secrets from whom!
what happened with the birds?
he traps birds and spray-paints them!
Raj, what are you doing here?
Why? I live here.
but this is my hiding place "No, it's mine... and has been since I was your age
who are you hiding from?
Aria. I don't play with girls
who are you hiding from?
no one
then why are you here? - I'm in a bad mood
Why? - You won't understand
Why? - It's grown-up stuff
do I look small to you?
OK.
I'm in a bad mood because...
I'm in love with someone who can't love me back
Why?
I don't know. - Then who knows? God?
maybe
mom says God knows everything.
so I think God must know where my Dad is
Meaning?
we don't know where he is. He doesn't even come to my school
all the other dads come. Only mine doesn't "So, you could say... I get into a bad mood
that's Pooja... let's go...
Raj, you won't tell anyone about our hiding place, right?
never
out with the money - What for?
it's auspicious!
they caught you, didn't they!
you too, Papa - Oh no...
take this
I'll get back at you!
what did you do now Adi? - Nothing
I'm sure!
he's so mischievous! - But he's adorable.
Yes.
uncle, where's Namrata's husband? - You don't know? He went away...
left both of them years ago
Namrata never talks about it. She's raised Adi on her own
I've never seen her cry. Except once
when she first left Adi at his boarding school
shall I put them on?
what's this? - Let's see
give it to me. I'll make a paper plane
don't you think it's time you started life over?
I want to put wedding bangles on you too "Nikki, you know that can't be
no way... Lunch first. I'm coming
let's be quick "Namrata, you've put bangles on Nikki, but what about...
a wedding turban for Raj? - Very soon, sir
I don't want to meet any more girls. - Have you found someone?
no, Uncle
sir, leave it to me. I'll find someone for him
you won't understand. - What won't she understand?
because it's grown up stuff. I've eaten

puja, what if Namrata doesn't show up with her clothes?
you'll have to wear something. - You look beautiful

Nikki! You're not ready yet?
Namrata was to bring my outfit "And the matching jewellery, shoes, and everything

not to send her to America before my engagement
she was expected yesterday
everyone's waiting. Wear something else
never. I'll wear only that outfit
so if she doesn't come your engagement's off?
Raj, this is my elder brother and my sister-in-law
what's wrong, Raj? - Nothing
if you'd come any later, the engagement would've been off.
sorry, sir. I'd checked in and...
later! Get her ready quickly. I'll attend to the guests
you're so late
what happened to you? - When I reached the airport...
Raj, meet the Malhotras... and their daughter Rani
talk to her.
say something
where do you stay?
nearby...
on MG Road... - And you?
in a house. I can't live on the road
he's always joking "Uncle, I'm serious
you? - You?
I can't believe it - Nor can I
you know each other? - I was telling you about the airport
Namrata designed it
how is he? Babloo?
Babloo? He's well.
which Babloo?
Ajay. He's been searching for you.
Nikki's here
must be around. I'll fetch her
one minute
I can't find Nikki or Ajay. Where are they?
right here "Namrata, it's a beautiful outfit.
have you met?
the most talented designer in our office, Namrata
my nephew Raj. He lives in America and thinks he's too cool to marry
but he's...
going to get married this time. He won't escape
it's getting late
come along
do you know why I was delayed?
this man had to rush back to tend to his sick son Babloo "Look, I had to get to Nikki's engagement...
admit that it was a good idea
so you have no sense of humour? It's not your fault
girls are deficient in that department "Only guys are smart, right?
Nikki, you should stand by him
but Namrata was so late
all because you
don't listen to these guys. They're all liars.
come on... listen to me...
what is it?
listen carefully then tell me what you think
why are women so arrogant, vain and stuck up
we're just being nice to you, so why the attitude?
you listen to me...
what would you like to say?
we're not like that
but even if we were
so what?
why shouldn't we be proud or even arrogant
when we have the world at our feet
and our beauty drives you crazy
even when we break your hearts "You must admit we do it with a certain charm
we hope you got the answer You were looking for...
listen to me...
let me tell you, the secret of your beauty
and your charm?
it is we who behold the magic in your mundane acts
and honor your silly tantrums with attention
it is we who call your smallest virtue sublime
and make your ordinary looks legendary
your beauty remains unmatched only in the eyes of the beholder "Without us, where would you be?
if you think...
that we owe our looks to you then it's clear that your beauty has you "so intoxicated that you cannot think straight
otherwise, why would you
talk such rubbish?
obviously you missed the point... Nevermind
if you want to be vain that's fine
but don't forget
that the glow on your face "only reflects the fire of our passions
for the world to see
it's not surprising we've cast a spell on you "with our petal-soft skin lips like buds
and hair so dark and fragrant like the night
but we're the ones who "Compared your lips to buds and your skin to blossoms
it is we who respond to your glance as if it's magical
and your words as if they're poetry
and it's we who see the mystery of the night in your hair
if we were not to look at it to love it and to worship it
who would call an idol made of stone
a god
will you listen to me?
what's left to say?
come on... listen to me...
but at least listen...
maybe later... if I have the time
but...
I like this one... - Her nose is too large
her bank balance is larger "Let it be, Dad. Raj doesn't want to marry.
a man's life is incomplete until he's marries "After that, it's finished!
see this one
I'm the umpire. You are out. Your wicket has fallen
get this straight. My wicket cannot fall
this time I have such winners lined up that you'll be bowled over
these are our future sisters-in-law?
Yes. - Not all, stupid. Just one
Raj, take a look
poonam, an interior designer
Reshma, MBA. Kavita, Priya...
Rachna, who you'll meet this evening
who said so? - I did "I didn't, did I? - But you've to listen to what I say
how can you decide without asking me?
I've asked you so often- you never reply "But, I don't... - No buts. Pick one of these five,
we can have a joint wedding - Nikki and you combined
buy one get one free!
this isn't a money-saving scheme. It's my whole life on the line
exactly. I'm doing this for your happiness.
after all I'm like a father to you. - But you're not my father!
uncle!
Nikki, make him understand...
you upset him. You pacify him
I've convinced the American buyers to see our collection
they will be here on the 19th. I'm sure we'll get the order "After such a successful trip, can I expect a promotion?
who do you young people think you are?
you know it all!
our generation, it seems, knows nothing
uncle, you misunderstood. We're nothing without you.
sir, I'll be back later
you stay here "Sit. - Yes, sir
I'd rather talk to you in private "Sir, I'll come back... - Sit
Yes, sir
tell this young man, I've heard enough from him
uncle, I didn't mean it. Don't be angry, please
me? Ask him...
what right I have to be angry with him "Uncle, you've always treated me like a son
and I've regarded you as a father.
so, ask him... Will he see the girls?
sir? - No, Uncle
fine. Namrata, you were saying...
you come here
sit... and listen "I said to this gentleman, you're old enough now...
meet some girls. If you like one, marry her
did I say something wrong? - Not at all, sir
look, I'm not against marriage. - Then...
ask him what the problem is.
explain to him... Please. - What?
that it's absurd to meet a girl with hordes of her relatives around
how can I talk to her?
sir, I think he wants to meet the girls in private
what?
this is not America. All that doesn't work here
that's the problem... I can't have a heart-to-heart
why not send Nikki with Raj?
you'll manage a heart to heart with Nikki there, surely?
Nikki's caught up with wedding preparations.
otherwise, it was a good idea. - Sir, you could send someone else
who?
he won't take me along.
puja and Aria are too young. And he doesn't know anyone else.
so the bride hunt is off!
wait
Namrata will go with you "But, a family member should be present
don't worry. I'll take care of all that.
but, sir... - You want a promotion, right?
get started "But, Uncle... - Now what?
nothing... Can I go?
you chose to meet Rachna at a temple?
with you and uncle against me. I need God on my side.
you're sure that immersing a silver coin...
makes a wish come true? - 100 percent
you know the stable behind our house... Gulab Singh's?
Yes. - His horse, Lovely...
the black one? - No, the white. A major problem.
no offspring. So he threw coins in here and got twins "Gulab Singh got twins? - No, the horse did
how did the horse throw the coins? - Gulab Singh did that
I see. - How much is a silver coin?
rs 101
give him the money, quick. Hurry or we'll lose our turn
the money's with you, how can I pay him?
I kept the cash in my socks and left my socks in the car
how ridiculous! Hiding money in your socks. Go and get it
I'm going - I'll stand in the queue
we mustn't lose our place "The keys are with me. Here, catch.
avoid brawls in temples... - Sardarji just grabbed my hand
what?
brother, I tried to catch my keys and caught sister-in-law's hand instead
I'm not your sister-in-law. - I'm no villain
we've come from miles away to immerse coins and make our wish come true
me and my Mrs... Minty come quickly
what's the matter?
this man claims I grabbed his wife's hand "Not my wife, my sister-in-law. - I am not your sister in law!
OK... sister. Forgive me.
please forgive him. I'm his wife Minty "He didn't mean it - He doesn't act fresh, even with me
Rachna?
go make a phone call... - To whom?
anyone "Uncle, of course
I wanted to ask- Why meet at a temple?
you believe in re-birth?
what? I mean...
what happens after death? - How would I know?
I haven't experienced death.
no?
you mean that I have?
you don't remember? - What?
you fell from a cliff
we went as pilgrims to Kedarnath.
Babloo was with us
our beloved child "Remember, he was so thirsty that day
you handed him to me.
and set out to get water for him
you never came back "Three days later, We discovered your corpse!
my corpse?
don't worry, I never remarried.
I took good care of Babloo "Do you know, he's a vegetable vendor now!
when you were about to be reborn "so I jumped off the same cliff to end my life, Savitri
Savitri? - Yes, Savi.
true love has reunited us. Now Kishen won't lose his Savi "Come, Savi. The temple's here. We can get married at once
one minute... I'll take off my shoes...
Savi?
what's the matter? - He's crazy.
why introduce me to this lunatic?
why did I get involved with you? - Who told you to get involved?
you two are fighting again?
it happens when you're just married. Don't worry.
you'll get used to it soon.
I've upset her again
let's go. Where are the keys?
here. - This is a coin
so I threw the keys in the water. - Oh God!
I think that Raj really does not want to marry
we shouldn't force him. - That's not it
the problem is that he's never met someone he connects with "Next time, take him to a cool place
get him in the mood...
I knew you'd like this place "Raj, come on. - Where?
I told Poonam we'll meet upstairs "It's less crowded, you two can talk and...
you take such good care of me!
Poonam's an interior designer. She studied in New York
what's that famous college called? - Gaitonde Institute of Design
stop kidding. - I'm listening. I went to NYU "If you don't know anything about Poonam, how will you talk to her?
I know what to say. - That's what I'm afraid of.
there's Poonam. Doesn't she look cute?
my friends call me Pony
when you let down your hair what do they call you?
pony!
what will you have? - Vodka!
sir, this is not your drink, sir - Put it down
first ask Pony what she'd like?
what will you drink?
no hard drinks for me. One Virgin Pina Colada
one Virgin Pony Colada...
and you, Namrata? - A Coke. No ice
you need to make a phone call
I did already
what are your hobbies?
checking out potential brides.
I come here every summer and meet a line-up of girls
it keeps my Uncle happy. He considers his time well-spent
I cannot marry you "I can't marry you either, I'm so happy to hear you say...
why did you have to hurt her feelings?
sir, your drinks. - Under the table
that's not it... It's him.
the one in the ugly shirt? - In the grey jacket... Vikram
my first and only love
what happened to him? - When we last met we had a big fight
he didn't like my dress. Know what he said?
pony, I can find thousands like you! Can you believe it?
so I told him that I could find thousands like him
I thought I'd marry someone else And teach him a lesson...
but the truth is really I love Vikram
I cannot live without him. I swear
thank god. - What?
don't worry, Pony, we won't let you die
but what can you do?
from the moment I saw you today
from the moment I saw you today
the stars shone brighter "My whole world changed- The moment I saw you
from the moment I saw you today
the stars shone brighter "My whole world changed- The moment I saw you
you are my love...

you are the form, you are the hues. You are the scorching sun and the shade
you are a bewitching beauty who wields the magic
you are the only one my eyes follow
why do I get the feeling... - Some things are meant to be "It's true, isn't it
Meaning? - You don't think so?
think what?
if we hadn't met today...
then maybe Pony and Vikram wouldn't have met
pony and Vikram ...how lucky they are
you think they truly love each other?
how can one tell it's true love?
you just know
when you can't sleep at night
and each day seems endless without that person
why must he send roses every single day?
when you grow up, you'll get roses every day too
Why?
when a boy sends roses to a girl, it means...
I love you "Raj, you're in love, aren't you?
who's she?
can you keep a secret?
tell me...
Namrata!
Raj, you there yet? - Where are you?
in the office... - Still?
I'll leave in ten minutes. Chat with Kavita till then
Kavita?
I liked you the minute I saw your picture...
but how did you know what I like...

in that case, what can I do?
you're forward...
my new mummy!
when are you coming home to stay with us
we'll have lots of fun
that's not your mummy. This one is "My new mummy, when are you moving in with us...
we'll have so much fun together. What?
poor boy.
ever since his mother left us, he imagines that every woman is his mother.
he misses a mother's love desperately. - You're married?
and divorced. I'm available.
enough? - See how much he loves you already!
we'll make a happy foursome.
four? - Yes, his brother's at home: Babloo
you gave me a scare!
ADI, give me those photos

then you know what you won't get after lunch...
what are you cooking?
Didi, tell them both to listen to me
Puja's in charge today. You two must listen to her
understood? - Never!
Never!
this paneer is delicious. I wish I didn't have to go to Ajay's for lunch.
their food is quite bad. - What a good daughter-in-law!
who are these moustachioed girls? - Brides for your darling brother
but he doesn't need to meet any
Why?
he didn't tell you? - Raj likes someone?
I can't say a word. I promised him "And I did nothing for him, why should he tell me?
if he won't tell you, who will he tell?
tell me who she is
when you steal a glance at me
you leave me breathless
when you play with a straying hair
you leave me breathless
when you look at me that way
you leave me breathless
when you show your love so openly
you leave me breathless "You possess every quality, my love...
the innocence, the freshness, the mischief, the naivete...
you are the one I have given my heart to
my freshness is thanks to you "Thanks to your love, I am beautiful
every hue, I have got from you
when you feel shy at my praise...
you leave me breathless "When you laugh, when you put on airs...
you leave me breathless
why do you look lost?
what thoughts are you lost in?
that which is in your heart, tell me too
I wonder how I must address you
my beautiful one...? Or my beloved?
but those are already your names
when you tell me I have so many names...
you leave me breathless
my birds!
you brat, why are you doing this?
I'll lock you in this cage for the rest of your life!
where did you go...
ADI, what's up? - Where's that rascal?
you're the rascal! - I won't let you go
who are you? - His father
he won't let you go!
I've travelled long and far, and scaled the Himalayan peaks...
to catch each little bird. And your brat...
sorry, your little darling, let them all fly away
I've lost everything...
he's lying! He catches the birds right here and spray-paints them
hey...
tell me
how can such a small boy open such a complicated cage?
sir, he did. - Can't be
I swear on the open cage that he did...
don't believe it. - He opened it, I swear
I don't believe it. - Shall I show you?
ADI, show us - Brat
dear child, show your daddy how clever you are
how you opened the cage and let the birds out
show us
my birds... My bread-winners...
are gone, thanks to him.
what's this, sir?
you ok now? - Thank you, sir.
this time I'm being kind- - To the birds?
no, to you. If I see you with this cage again...
I'll spray-paint you till you're one of the birds. Understood?
lower your lungi. And get going...
this is a decent neighbourhood.
let me treat you today "Some other time, okay?
what you doing here? - I was looking for you.
I believe you told Nikki you like someone "And you didn't tell me? Actually, Namrata, l...
mom, look at all the fish...
there's so many! - What if something happened?
look - What if you'd fallen in?
Raj's my friend - we've met before
you know my son?
don't tell her where we met. That's our secret,
come home and we'll see who keeps secrets from whom!
what happened with the birds?
he traps birds and spray-paints them!
Raj, what are you doing here?
Why? I live here.
but this is my hiding place "No, it's mine... and has been since I was your age
who are you hiding from?
Aria. I don't play with girls
who are you hiding from?
no one
then why are you here? - I'm in a bad mood
Why? - You won't understand
Why? - It's grown-up stuff
do I look small to you?
OK.
I'm in a bad mood because...
I'm in love with someone who can't love me back
Why?
I don't know. - Then who knows? God?
maybe
mom says God knows everything.
so I think God must know where my Dad is
Meaning?
we don't know where he is. He doesn't even come to my school
all the other dads come. Only mine doesn't "So, you could say... I get into a bad mood
that's Pooja... let's go...
Raj, you won't tell anyone about our hiding place, right?
never
out with the money - What for?
it's auspicious!
they caught you, didn't they!
you too, Papa - Oh no...
take this
I'll get back at you!
what did you do now Adi? - Nothing
I'm sure!
he's so mischievous! - But he's adorable.
Yes.
uncle, where's Namrata's husband? - You don't know? He went away...
left both of them years ago
Namrata never talks about it. She's raised Adi on her own
I've never seen her cry. Except once
when she first left Adi at his boarding school
shall I put them on?
what's this? - Let's see
give it to me. I'll make a paper plane
don't you think it's time you started life over?
I want to put wedding bangles on you too "Nikki, you know that can't be
no way... Lunch first. I'm coming
let's be quick "Namrata, you've put bangles on Nikki, but what about...
a wedding turban for Raj? - Very soon, sir
I don't want to meet any more girls. - Have you found someone?
no, Uncle
sir, leave it to me. I'll find someone for him
you won't understand. - What won't she understand?
because it's grown up stuff. I've eaten
tell Aria to give back my plane
forget the paper plane... come with me
boys box... like this "Not like that, like this
what happened? You're hurt? Are you a girl?
no.
I'll show them all how to box at school. I'll knock them out
who? - The big guys. They make fun of me
Really? Punch them like this then... and this...
Raj, will you be my Dad and come to school?
shall we go, Adi?
mom, tell Raj to come with us. Those boys will be afraid of him
they won't tease me then.
Raj, you'll come, won't you?
I've got an idea. In a couple of days...
I'll make you such good boxer that you'll fix them, on your own!
ADI misses his father very much. - I understand
so you'll come?
sorry? - With us... to school?
no... I meant...
think only you can crack jokes?
ADI, put on your shoes
if you want me to, I will come
I was joking
I don't have a problem with it. - I don't want to bother you
but it will make Adi happy "So, Raj is coming?
yes Mom, let's box
I can't box. Box with Raj tomorrow
I've always felt an affinity with the blue skies behind those dark clouds.
there's just a few moments of Hiden-seek with the thick clouds before the skies come into their own again.
No!
Tamy, this is not fair.
I haven't read all of it yet - I got to leave!
so what? I got to leave too!
Tamy, you are so mean.
Oh God! Oh my God.
you've been glued to the newspaper since this morning and didn't even tell me!
surprise, surprise! - What surprise? Late surprise!
late surprise!
I had heard of late reactions. Late surprise's a new one on me!
you've heard it now, okay? - Tanu!
don't cut it out! I've yet to read it.
I'm cutting it already.
why does Dj associates win this award every year?
because we are the best. Let's hear it for us.
Yeah! And all thanks to one person.
please put your hands together for Tamanna.
C'mon. C'mon. - Thank you.
also thanks to another person.
please put your hands together for yours truly.
sir, dinner?
I waited so long for this.
I just don't want this night to end.
Thanks, Tam. For standing by me when I started this small company. And for being with me ever since.
thanks for this award.
thanks for your guidance.
shall we eat?
I'm not at all hungry! - But it's Chinese. Your favorite.
and it's supposed to be very good.
OK. All right.
let's go.
what happened? - I'm getting old. What else?
tell me something new!
Lalit, whom do you want to dedicate this song to?
to my wife Nalini.
Tania, actually Nalini and I had a fight this morning.
I promised to take her out to the movies and myself forgot to be there.
I want to dedicate this song to her and say I'm sorry to her.
look at him, Nalini. Lalit really loves you.
please forgive him. And here's a special song for the two of you.
have a great night everyone.
this call is being forwarded to...
there's the train, parked right on top of the crematorium.
and just then the door of the compartment creaks open on its own.
it's just the bell!
jerk, it's your own story. And you're running scared?
let's give her a surprise. - Quiet!
tanu, haven't you gone to sleep? - If you had the key...
Congratulations!
why is it so dark? No electricity? - Sam was telling us a horror story.
Sam! Grow up! - Hey, I was simply...
you're the limit, Tania.
you start squealing the moment Big Sister arrives.
so when's the party? - The party's already over.
and my tummy's full too. - No way! No excuses this time!
you guys are acting as if something great has happened.
maybe it wouldn't be so great for us if we won awards every day too.
party! Party!
OK, guys. Here's the deal.
the day my photo appears on the Cover-page of Business Today...
I'll give you all a party. Okay? - Cheapo!
hey Surjit, what're you thinking of? - Just a moment.
very talented, man!
stinking caricature!
Sam, be a sport. - He's a sport.
no wonder people keep playing with him.
sure, do play with me all the time.
but what's happening in your own life, Miss Rossane?
what? What?
Rossane's an usher at Symphony from today.
Ooh! Wow!
free movies? - I don't know how long I'll be there.
not again, Rossane!
stick to at least some job!
she's bored of the job even before joining it!
right.
no phone calls.
but it's Niharika. - Hi, Tamanna! Got my message?
sure, I even called back. - So you're coming, aren't you?
no, I don't think I'll be able to make it. Got loads of work to do.
suit yourself. Anyway, Rohit is coming.
what?
excuse me.
what did you say...? - Rohit is coming.
Rohit...? Rohit Manchanda? - Yup.
I'll kill you, if it turns out to be a lie.
so you're coming, right?
Tamanna, what's happening?
after all these years! Are you sure...?
Yes. He was in the U.S.
tell him when you meet him. - What?
what you couldn't tell him in 3 years of college.
Niharika... shut up, Ok.
OK, Bye. See ya. - Bye.
Oh God!
Where's the CD of my songs, joseph?
get lost! And don't you dare touch my stuff.
I'll break your legs.
it's me! - Tamanna?
has the air-conditioner in your room stalled again?
no. I couldn't go to sleep. - No problem, my ac's working fine.
may I sleep here? - Sure
Niharika had called. - Now...?
is everything all right?
Guruji's birthday's coming up. - Good. So when are you going?
I don't think I'll be able to make it this time.
there's a lot of work to do for BSA. - So turn Niharika down.
but Rohit's coming this time.
then, what are you thinking?
we have the BSA account. And Subbu won't let me go.
you will go to the office every day. But Rohit's not coming every day.
you think I must talk to Subbu? - Phone that old fossil right now!
Tanu! It's 2'o clock!
forget it. I'll talk to him tomorrow. - Now! Wake him up!
our own sleep's been blown away! - Tanu, let go!
Promise...? Tomorrow? - Yes, of course.
I'm so excited! - I'm so sleepy.
and you are so boring.
it'll be very tragic if we lose this account of BSA cycles, Tamanna.
they stood by us when we had nothing else.
remember, they are not only our first account.
but till date, the biggest source of revenue for us.
I understand that, Subbu Sir. But it's only for two days.
in any case, our next meeting with them is scheduled only for Friday.
well, whatever you feel like.
you're the one who deals with them and makes all those presentations.
I don't interfere in these things.
Subbu Sir...
you trust me, don't you?
of course, I do.
then please don't worry. I'll give you no reason for complaints.
Oh. C'mon, Tam.
have a great trip, Ok? - Thanks.
that's not how it is, Rohit.
if every good and bad deed were to result in instant result there would be no element of mystery to God's ways.
and obviously, God wants to maintain this element of secrecy.
Rohit, maybe you never wanted what you did not get...
and that which your heart craves for, I am sure you will certainly have.
why are you standing there, Tamanna? Come here.
happy Birthday, Guruji! - Didn't I tell you she'd surely come?
look at him. When he studied here, he'd go missing from class.
and after going missing... he has turned up now. Ten years later.
long time, Rohit. - Long time.
go on. - No, you speak.
do you come here every year? - Yes. On Guruji's birthday.
but this time, I...
hi Tam. - Hey, Niharika.
I hope you won't kill me now? - Shut up, will you?
you've already turned him into a coolie?
I'm sorry. - No problem.
so when are you telling him? - Shut up, Niharika.
what's going on?
we students are painting a canvas together. A little surprise for Guruji.
Rohit, come on. - Sanjay, look who's here!
it's been so many years!
Hi. - Almost forgot your face man.
but I can still remember the tunes you played on the guitar.
how have you been? - Good
miss you a lot.
Hey, guys. Look who's here?
this is Rohit. And we still play the tunes he composed.
we still use them, you know.
you must also paint something for Guruj. I
Yes, that's right.
Oh yes, go ahead!
Sanjay! Listen! The teacher has arrived.
what's happening here? What are all of you doing?
this is for you, Guruji. - Happy Birthday, Guruji!
let's have a song, Rohit
why are you laughing? Must we wait another 10 years to hear you sing?
a hundred years. - Wow! Good joke
hey guys, get a guitar.
watch out, Rohit. If you don't sing, maybe I'll have to...
No! Please save us!
remember, Tamanna? You used to mumble something to irritate me?
do you still mumble it? - Some times when I think of you.
hoping to irritate you, wherever you are.
try it again. Let's see if it still irritates me.
after a long long consideration, come to the conclusion matriculation examination is a big big botheration to the Indian nation whose main occupation is cultivation.
one more time.
after a long long consideration, come to the conclusion matriculation examination is a big big botheration to the Indian nation whose main occupation is cultivation.
please one more time.
after a long long consideration, come to the conclusion matriculation examination is a big big botheration to the Indian nation, whose...
I can't say.
Thanks, Tamanna. - What for?
can't remember, when I last laughed so much.
but one more time, please...?
shut up!
Hi. - Hi. How are you?
abstract. Interesting. - Thank you.
please. I won't disturb you.
Hi. - This is beautiful.
you haven't lost your touch, Niharika.
I drop in some times. To kill time.
he's not around.
but I'm not looking for anyone.
I told you. He's not around.
so where is he?
as if you don't know his favorite hideouts.
what are you doing...? Let it alone.
I'm sorry. But it looks better without the earring.
I knew I'd find you here.
some things never change.
Yes, some things never change.
isn't this the place you had your guitar-practice at?
Guruji had pinned a lot of hopes on me, hadn't he?
and what are you doing nowadays?
not much.
Niharika was telling me that you've been in New York.
Yes, I've spent a few years of my life in New York.
but my dreams... - Dreams? So you've been sitting here...
hold on. Let me complete.
okay, what did you want to say? - You are daydreaming here, and everyone there's looking for you.
I've been looking for someone too.
looks like I've found her.
Yes, I have.
that's a nice idea, Tamanna. We've never done folk theater.
OK. That's settled then.
the background score will be handled by our America-returned music director.
right, Rohit? - Sure.
great! How about starting tomorrow?
by the way, guys, guess what?
Rohit used to be very good at gymnastics.
Gymnastics! What nonsense!
you don't know. Rohit is so good!
had he not gone away to America to pursue a career in music...
he'd have been India's Olympics gymnast!
you don't believe me?
show them the somersault routine.
Yes, go ahead. They haven't seen you doing it.
make way, guys...
C'mon, Rohit...
just look out for him. - Yeah, we'll see.
Yeah, buddy
OK. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.
side.
all the best.
two somersaults. One twist. - Ok.
you are too good!
nice one, man. - Thank you.
buddy, that was great!
amazing!
it's very simple. You must try it.
it's so easy. C'mon.
somersault of the year. - Start with the right leg.
thank God your music's not like your somersaults!
now that I'm here, I realize how I missed all this.
don't you intend to go back then?
I'll have to. For a few days.
will you be coming back?
for good? - For good.
great!
I always knew it. - What?
that you'd come back.
was it you who put it in there?
why did you hide it, Tamanna? Why didn't you tell me?
I was scared.
if only you had told me then ten years of my lifetime wouldn't have been...castaway.
don't know much about History.'
don't much about Biology.'
don't know much about my science books.'
don't know much about the French I took.'
I do know that I love you.
I love you Tammana.
and if I know that you love me too. Do you love me?
what a wonderful world it'd be!
what a wonderful world it'd be!
what... a wonderful world... it'd be!
I've found what my heart always craved, Guruji
may you be happy! You look sweet when you smile.
take care.
love - the topic of the day. Which give us pain and joy.
Oh My God! Oh No!
where is the pencil? Oh God!
hell, Tamy. You could've at least given me a phone call.
missed you.
there was so much to do today.
why this long face?
what happened? Didn't Rohit show up there?
Rohit's number...? Great!
I'm famished.
half the number. - Why did he give you half of it?
is he crazy?
or was the other half meant to be a riddle for you to solve?
that half got washed away in the bath. - Washed away!
why didn't you jot it down on a paper before you took a bath?
how was I to know... - C'mon!
so I've made a mistake.
haven't you given him your number? - No.
Niharika must have his number!
Oh yes!
Jatin, will you bring Prashant and Leela to my cabin, please?
good. Very interesting!
where are the tag lines?
try and skip the cliches, Thick, silken tresses...
if that's what every shampoo's going to give them why would people buy our client's brand?
Jatin, I worked on some lay-outs this morning.
I want something like this.
take a close look at this. Look at the color scheme.
Hi. - One moment, Prashant.
is it ok? - All right? - Any questions?
no. - So let's step on it.
we've very little time. - All right.
Prashant, how about the BSA Ladybird? - It's coming up.
this is not done. You said it would be ready by the time I returned.
Yes, I did, but...
bsa is anyway thinking of taking away their products to another agency.
and I'm trying my very best to stop them from leaving us.
because we're the ones in need. Not they.
I know, but...
how much more time? - A day or two
a day? Or two?
two.
leave a copy of the brief on my table.
I told you, Tam. Two Days.
no problem. In the meanwhile, let me see if another idea clicks.
because I'm meeting them on Friday. All right.
as you wish?
hello - Hello, Murthy. Lunch?
eight to ten months? Which means, we have enough time.
Tamanna, times gonna fly.
a lot many agencies are approaching them with great designs and good track-records
but I'm confident we'll get it.
we are the best, you know.
Niharika? Any news?
no, he hasn't even replied to my emails.
why is he doing this?
Rohit will surely call. - All right.
OK, fine.
good morning, Sapna. - Good morning, sir.
how are you? - Fine sir.
just go home. Go home.
Subbu sir, I'm sorry.
I don't know when I fell asleep.
tam, just go home.
no, no, there's so much to do. The meeting's coming up in 3-4 days.
you haven't been home in 2 days. - I have a change of clothes here.
I'll be back in a moment.
just listen to me. Come back only after lunch, okay?
is that Ms Tamanna Sahni? - Yes.
we found your card in your sister's bag. She has met with an accident.
she's been admitted to the Manipal Hospital.
please meet Dr Rai Singh immediately.
Dr. Rai Singh? - Over there.
straight? - Yes. - Thanks.
Dr. Rai Singh? - Yes? - Tamanna Sahni.
please sit.
my sister...? - She's fine
it's not serious, I hope? - Nothing serious.
just a hairline fracture and a swelling on her head.
thank God, she was wearing a helmet.
I'd like to go and see her. Yeah sure.
hi Tania. How are you feeling now?
inspector, this is Tania's sister Tamanna.
you'll have to collect your sister's bike from the police station, madam.
there'll be some paperwork to do.
right ma'am. Take care of yourself. Thank you.
let me see those x-rays.
how often have I asked you not to speed so much?!
why don't you listen to me...? - Please, Tammy!
what if something serious had happened?
please stop crying, Tammy. I'm okay. - You're telling me?
thank you. Thank you very much. - Not at all.
we have the x-rays and prescriptions.
you'll have to send for the medicines
by the way, she had a cut vein in the calf, so we had to give her some blood.
as a policy, you must replace it. B-positive, if possible.
I'm B-positive too. - That's good.
Yeah, Jatin. I should be there in thirty minutes.
Oh God! - Ready in five minutes. - So am I.
tell Sada to at least order printer cartridges on time.
OK, sure. - What a waste of time!
Oh God! Right timing.
Tamanna? - Yes?
I got something important to talk to you about. Can you come over?
is Tania all right? - Tania? She's fine.
tam, they are waiting.
meet me as soon as come. I'll be right here.
but Tania... - She's fine.
just come and see me. I'll be waiting, okay?
Thanks. - Bye.
how about those reports of the test we sent for a reconfirmation?
Prashant, one minute. - Yeah.
I got to leave for the hospital immediately.
could you go over to BSA for the first meeting, please?
as you wish.
don't worry. They are 990/0 convinced.
just make this presentation there.
I'll take Tania home and give you a call.
what's up? - What's up?
that's what I want to know. What's up? - What's that about?
what happened? - Someone delivered a baby boy.
there were some showers and there was also said to be a bomb blast somewhere.
that's what's been happening. Nothing else
why did Dr Rai Singh call me over so urgently?
I'm not Tania Rai Singh to know. Am I?
I'm just packing my bags. Subi and Ross are coming to pick me up.
I thought you were here to take me home.
anyway, you can go back to the office after getting me a discharge.
my friends will drop me home. - So you're taking a dig at me?
of course. How often have you come to see me in the hospital?
tanu, stop acting like a baby.
don't you know how much work I have at the office?
sure, I do. That old Subu also called.
how are you, my child? How are you? Get well soon.
tanu, that's very very mean.
we'll go home after I see the doctor, okay? I'll back.
you're not angry with me over this stupid accident, are you?
I just wanted to say that I'm angry.
don't act silly. I'm not angry, okay?
I thought that was the reason why you didn't come to see me
there was such a huge backlog of BSA, as soon as it's over, we'll go on a long holiday.
promise. - Promise.
may I go now? And see Dr Rai Singh?
we've got to go home.
let's have a long chat once we get home, okay?
you said you wanted to talk to me. I'm so sorry I'm late.
doctor, you've looked after Tania so well.
I just don't know how to thank you.
can I take Tania home?
Tamanna, listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you
Tania...? Is there...?
she's perfectly fine.
it's the blood sample you gave us, we sent it to the lab for a test, as we do in every case.
usually, there is no need for us to tell the patient about the results.
I just felt that you should know.
your blood is HIV-positive.
Tamanna, I'm sorry. Without your permission, I got an eliza test done to reconfirm the results.
that was positive too.
Tamanna, your parents have met with an accident.
their car has fallen in a gorge.
Tamanna, don't be under the impression that you have AIDS.
the virus hasn't started spreading in your body yet.
if you wish, you could even have a western blot test conducted.
I wish you would see a counselor to overcome the shock.
and yes, you will have to take better care of your health.
there will be medicines to take... once in month.
God!
save me!
it's enough.
Hey! Here she is.
let's go.
now be careful. Don't trip and fall.
don't worry. She's ok.
let's go. I'm driving.
why are you so tongue-tied...?
and you said we'd have a long chat at home?
worried about BSA? What an idiot I am!
you already have so many worries. And I keep talking nonsense.
I can't figure out anything.
how did it happen...? When?
I never had a blood transfusion.
no injections.
Yes, there was this special girl. The best thing about her was that apart from me, there were nine other guys in her life.
you know. You don't even have to say that I love when you are in love.
six. Six Vows
will you take the seventh one with me?
C'mon. Be original. Say yes.
Rohit... I...
good morning.
what are staring at? - You.
the one I only dreamt of.
we are sorry. The number you have reached is not in service.
please check the number or try your call again.
Niharika, you're the one Rohit called earlier, isn't it?
that's true, but I've tried all the numbers Rohit had given me, .but there has been no response. I've asked all his friends here, but none of them knows anything. He's untraceable.
please keep trying Niharika. - Sure, Tania.
sorry. Your call cannot be completely dialed.
please check the number and dial...
hello. - Hello. - Could I speak to Rohit please.
has Tam had something to eat? - No.
Hello, is Rohit there? - I'm sorry. It's a wrong number.
there's mail from one of our listeners, but there's no name.
she writes that her sister is presently facing a very severe problem which makes her keep very silent
but you needn't worry at all!
Tanya is here for you with her magic wand.
she will request your sister...
why do you make our listener so sad? Why don't you talk to her?
she loves you so dearly and can't bear to see you sad.
and this is the song she dedicates to you
I'm so happy.
nothing's happening to you, Tammy.
good morning.
what is it?
nothing.
I'll see you in the evening.
do you think it'll take time for my photo to appear on Business Today?
no. - I don't think so too. Bye.
hi Leela. Good morning, Sapna.
Yes.
you...?
I'm the creative head. May I help you?
I guess. I'll have to help myself.
I don't think this copy works.
the morning light waves and anticipation and all that.
I think it will go over the consumer's head.
I think we should be little more direct.
later.
how are you keeping, Tamanna?
who's that in my cabin?
that man in the cabin is Suresh.
may I know... why?
we barely managed to save BSA from slipping out of our hands.
I... I had already presented my designs and they were very impressed.
it was Prashant who presented the designs.
you had only had a discussion.
who presented them makes no difference.
I was the one who made the designs, isn't it?
their account is here because of my work!
that's what you think. But they were very very upset.
you didn't attend a meeting with them.
it was first Tania's accident. After that came your own personal health.
our company almost lost the BSA account.
business needs discipline, Tamanna.
but my work was perfect, sir.
your termination letter will explain the rest of the details to you.
it was nice... nice working with you, sir.
I've been ruined, sir! The insurance guys have rejected my claim.
delay your premium by a day and these guys wring your neck.
and now... - Enough. Thank you Mr. Yogi.
do you have another business apart from the timber mart?
no, I don't. Else, I wouldn't have been in such dire straits.
I invested all I had in this business, sir. You must help me now.
please answer only the questions you are asked.
thank you, sir.
what did you do with the ashes of the timber that was burnt?
I object. Is this a joke!
Mr. Anand! - Of course, sir. Give me a moment.
I'll be back. Here you go.
that's for you.
mr Yogi... do you recognize this?
very good.
sir, this is a receipt from Sudha foundries for a ton of coal purchased from our very own Mr. Yogi.
Mr. Yogi sold the charcoal of the burnt timber to Sudha Foundries.
the price of the charcoal was far more than the price of the timber.
hence my client is not liable to pay Mr. Yogi a single penny.
you honor, my client would like to withdraw this case.
very good decision.
thank you, your honor. Have a very good day.
let's go.
Yes, sir. I get it. Thank you. Bye.
hi Tarun. - Hello Divya. How are you? - I'm fine.
hello Tarun. - Hi Kalpu. We're still meeting for coffee?
well - Well?
and. - And?
Oh! What happened? - What do you think?
Oh, I'm sorry. Better luck next time.
damn it! I've won!
what? - What is this, man?
great! Congrats! - Yeah, Thank you.
did you win or lose, Tarun?
now what is your problem...?
I'm sorry. - I'm a good lawyer.
congrats! - No, I'm a good lawyer. Have some faith.
I don't know why everybody in this office is picking on me.
I won.
well. - Well?
so. - So?
Tamanna Sahni. - Yes.
in there. Since half an hour.
Oh Shit!
do me a favor, babes. Send two cups of coffee, please
OK. - Thank you.
hello. Hi. - Hello.
hi Tamanna. Nice to meet you.
did Rosanne tell you... - Yes, she told me. Please sit.
that's fine. - Yes.
I've ordered for a filing cabinet.
rosy was telling me that you had a problem with your job?
come in. - Yes, and that is why I...
coffee. Will you have some coffee? - Yeah, sure.
good. Let me put this away.
thank you. - Thank you.
so this place you were working at? You were sacked without a reason?
Yes. From Tj Associates. I want to file a suit against them.
they claim I wasn't doing my job properly.
they cite incompetence and negligence. What do you have to say?
because I'm HIV-positive.
excuse me.
HIV-positive!
you've AIDS? - No. AIDS is a different stage.
until the HIV virus attacks the blood cells. it remains dormant in one's body. Till then...
when is AIDS likely to happen? - Maybe tomorrow. Maybe 15 or 20 years.
it all depends on how one looks himself oneself.
medication... - Hold on, hold on.
ms. Sahni, I get your point.
your boss claims you were sacked because you weren't doing a job properly...
and you insist he sacked you because you're an AIDS patient?
hiv positive. - Yeah, sorry. HIV
he fired you because he didn't want an HIV-positive patient in his office?
right? - Yes
that's exactly why I was fired.
Mr. Anand? - Yes.
miss Sahni, I'm a corporate lawyer. And this is a case of employment.
this is not my field or expertise.
all I can suggest is that you consult a specialist...
his name from Nikhil Arora to Nick?
Nick is cool.
is he one of those Indians who are ashamed of being Indian?
I mean, what is this Nick business?
yo. I'm cool. I'm Australian. I'm Nick.
crap! What's she doing?
what's worth thinking about is, what else is Nikhil Arora ashamed of?
for example, is he ashamed of his face? Maybe he's really ugly.
maybe that's why he became a chef. To hide inside kitchens and not show his face around. On that note, here's a song for you...
what the...
hello... Nick here.
I'm almost there, yaar.
but this chick, your announcer, RJ-whatever... what's her name?
Hambar? What's this Hambar babe doing, yaar?
is this any way to talk about a guest? I want to talk to her.
Hello, is that Hambar? Hambar, Nick here.
what... what're you doing?
taking an interview.
Whose? - Yours
but I'm not there yet.
Really?
I didn't even notice that.
listen yaar...
listen yaar! You bloody Nikhil Arora!
you... Hambar!
why the hell are you calling me Hambar?
why the hell are you calling me Nikhil Arora?
because it's your name.
no, my name is Nick.
Oh really!
well, if you'd been here, I'd call you whatever you wanted.
Nick, Nicky, Marlon Brando.
Hello, what's your problem?
I hate latecomers. Because of you my show didn't start on time.
how does one late start make a difference.
to a clutch of Indian taxi drivers?
Salaam Namaste people, and this is the end of the show.
and still, there's absolutely no sign of Nikhil Arora.
a small piece of advice, if you plan to go to Nick of Time restaurant, be prepared to wait...
breakfast may appear by lunch and lunch by dinnertime.
I think they should rename the restaurant Never on Time.
anyway, it's goodbye from me Ambar and keep listening to Salaam Namaste, 101. 5FM.
hey mate, you're bleeding.
what?
are you okay? - I'm fine. I... I don't like blood.
you better see a doctor, man. - No doctor.
I don't like doctors.
but you're bleeding - Stop saying that.
want to catch a movie?
so, Jignesh, what's your diagnosis?
the patient has been experiencing.
a vague pain in the abdomen, followed by severe bouts of constipation, vomiting, swelling, bleeding stools and progressive weakness.
a biopsy can be conclusive.
but my diagnosis suggests lymphosarcoma of the intestine, just what Rajesh Khanna had in Anand
made in Surat, raised on khakra-dhokli,
Jignesh Pandya's Ione phobia was that he'd spend his whole life squatting behind the Archana Sarees cash register.
unlike his father, the millions.
wouldn't make life worth swatting away.
perhaps it was fear that drove him to pass the medical entrance test
but now, homesick in Australia, he's regretting his decision.
very nice, Jignesh. Good job.
forty! - But why?
because I know, you've skipped homework and you'll copy it off me, so twenty more.
when dad finds out that he's sponsoring the education of two instead of one
long live Archana Sarees!
now give me a hundred dollars more. - What for?
because a friend is always there when you need him.
forget it. Why don't you go rob your dad?
Amby... I'm sorry.
it's just a loan damn it!
I won't charge you for the next five classes.
but, a hundred dollars...
Simone's wedding. I need to buy a dress.
Simone's... getting married?
Why? Didn't you get an invitation?
no.
don't feel bad, next time you will.
by the way, I'll need your car tomorrow.
okay? Thank you! Bye!
why the hell do you want to ruin my reputation?
you forgot the bay leaf, the cardamom is almost non-existent
and please, everybody, come here.
just because salt is cheap does not mean we need to put it in everything.
we are not in India now... please, go easy on the salt.
now, I need to go and pee. Promise me...
you won't use the next five minutes to ruin another dish.
promise me!
we promise, boss!
thank you! Excuse me.
looks just like home-cooked food. - Thank you boss
so who needs to eat out? They could have just made this at home.
do you know the difference between a wife and a mistress?
I don't have either, boss.
no?
a wife wears a sari, a mistress wears a micro-mini.
a wife wears a wedding thread, for the mistress, a diamond necklace.
a wife wears a cotton nightgown, the mistress gets a red lingerie.
and that is now a mistress. Get it? Good.
boss. Dheka's looking for you. - So?
he looks quite angry! - Tell me something I don't know.
I've dammed a waterfall here.
it's amazing how Aslam Dheka flew from Dhaka to Melbourne on one ticket.
he sat on two seats and ate enough food for three.
the sound of his belch is still echoing in that Boeing 747.
he spent his life savings in buying a hot dog stall.
Dheka was a happy man he ate some and he sold some. Then luck smiled on him.
while a lawyer was eating his last hot dog a drunken driver trashed his cart.
they sued that Dheka struck gold.
overnight he became the owner and chief patron of Nick of Time.
you see?
see what?
see nothing! No people, no customers, no one! Why?
how should I know?
Salaam Namaste!
same to you.
all this happened because of your radio station!
you are going late and my restaurant is being insulted.
now you better not being late, ever again!
and if you are, I will fire you!
understand.
tomorrow, ten o' clock sharp! Understand? Otherwise...
fire?
murder!
are you hearing the radio?
no, what is happening?
you put on radio and listen.
so Radhika, your first novel is releasing tomorrow.
how are you going to celebrate?
I guess I'll celebrate with my husband.
romantic dinner, pop some champagne.
which restaurant? Not Nick of Time, I hope?
Why? I've heard it's a nice place.
come on Radhika.
eating what someone else has cooked is like putting your life in their hands.
like a doctor, right? - Right.
then can you trust a man who lies, who is never on time and who doesn't even have the decency to apologize for making you wait?
I think it's disgusting. Tell me...
would you tolerate this behaviour from your husband?
I'm sorry, but what's the connection? - There is a connection!
how can you trust a man who's ashamed to be an Indian?
my god, you're really angry.
Yes. And Mr Nikhil Arora will have to face my anger until he calls and apologizes to my listeners.
it'll just break.
Oh come on Dheka, who listens to that show anyway?
I will tell you who is listening.
my wife is listening, my son is listening.
my family is listening, everybody is calling and asking me, what is this?
they're all freeloaders anyway. Think of all the money you'll save.
I will kill you. For the bad name you are giving to my restaurant, I'll kill you.
Dheka, relax. You'll have a heart attack.
I'll just call Hambar and fix everything.
good. Are you at the wedding? - Just parking my car.
I'm almost there, yaar.
Hello? Hello, I can't hear you.
nice day isn't it?
I'm Ron... Ron.
I'm Lisa.
Lisa. Lisa's such a nice name, Lisa. What do you do, Lisa?
for 50 bucks, anything you want.
during his college days, Ranjan Mathur was so busy studying that he was oblivious to the basic differences between boys and girls.
although he became a successful architect, his vision cleared up one day, when he suddenly realized that the world didn't just consist of buildings.
there were other shapes as well and they were much more interesting.
since then, he has been wearing his heart on his sleeve, aiming for every girl crossing his sights, hoping that someday, somehow...
he'll manage to snag one for himself.
I've got to go... Thank you... - Ok... Ok... Forty...
who was that?
a friend.
from office? - No. She lives nearby.
what was her name? - Lisa.
let's give her a lift, yaar.
the poor girl's standing all alone at the bus stop.
no.
she's going the other way. So it's pointless.
What...? - How much was she asking for?
forty dollars.
Ron! Can't you tell?
how could I? She smiled sweetly, shook hands, even said her name.
I thought she was so friendly.
you must've started planning your wedding already.
what rubbish! I'm not that frustrated.
only the engagement.
tell me something, why am I coming with you?
because weddings are very boring and I don't want to get bored alone.
thanks - You're welcome.
so, what are we listening?
what? - I love to hear you being praised on air.
Oh crap! You've heard it too?
of course, it's damn good fun!
that RJ is making you famous.
you think this is funny? - Very.
you're laughing and I've lost half my clientele at the restaurant.
sue them.
sue the damn radio station, yeah?
causing of emotional distress, mental trauma, character assassination.
hang on, let me just call that Debonair character.
you be ready with this.
hello.
I am going to sue you!
who is speaking please? - This is Nick and I am going to sue you.
what for? - What for! For emotional distress and... - Mental trauma, character assassination.
I'm with a very big lawyer right now! - My friend is with a very big lawyer.
no, no! Not me! You, you are ! - No, no... you, you.
my friend is a very big lawyer.
see, Mr Nikhil Arora...
stop calling me that!
if one more person calls me Nikhil Arora, then I will... I'II...
I'll never talk to you again. - I'll never talk...
sorry yaar, I couldn't think of anything else.
listen! Why don't you talk directly to Hambar?
Oh sure, come on. Give me Hambar's number.
don't worry. I will connect you. Hold on.
hello listeners. Breaking news
Nikhil Arora has just called to apologize to Hambar.
we are taking you live to the conversation.
hello.
Ambar. The name is Ambar.
a, A for Ambar.
Oh... and the name is Nick, not Nikhil Arora, okay?
you! - Yes!
so you've finally decided to be sensible and say sorry.
sorry? Are you crazy?
I'm calling because what you're doing is not right.
and what am I doing?
you're ruining my reputation.
how?
by calling me Nikhil Arora for a start.
Oh, I am so sorry. I had no idea you hated your name so much.
I won't do it again.
thank you.
stop it!
start singing her name as well.
what are you doing?
if you can sing my name, I can sing yours.
listen, what's your problem?
what's your problem?
just because I was a little late for your stupid show, you're trying to destroy my life, my career, everything?
I would have tolerated your coming late, if you had the decency to call and apologize.
apologize?
for a two-bit radio show?
forget it!
Two-bit? Fine! Now just wait and watch how this two-bit radio show transforms you from a chef to a waiter
sorry.
Ah, sorry. That's better.
you've finally come to your senses.
what? I wasn't talking to you.
it's all right Nikhil. There's nothing to be ashamed of.
you made a mistake, and now you've apologized.
now listen to me. I'm going to give you another chance. But for that you'll have to come on time for my show. - I have an idea...
stuff your show in a bag; a garbage truck visits my restaurant every night.
nice one.
I'm sure it does. No one eats at your joint anyway...
it must all go down the drain.
give her a last warning.
look Ambar, this is your last warning...
stuff your last warning and listen to me.
unless you appear on my show and apologize to my listeners...
I won't let you off the hook. Now choose one.
your pride or your career? You'll sacrifice at least one of them.
you! You...
what happened?
I think I won.
good. Well done, I'm proud of you.
obviously you're not gaping like that at my food.
my palm is itching.
I have a feeling that the line of romance is finally emerging.
Congratulations.
who've you fallen for now?
all five. I'm going to try for all five of them.
I'll drop my handkerchief and pick it up with a...
excuse me, I think you dropped this.
Ron, it has your name on it.
damn.
Yes! I'll drop it, pick it up and say, it's mine, would you like to keep it?
okay Ron, I have a lot of work.
Oi! Drop that!
Why?
because it's not lunch-time yet. And you're spoiling my arrangement.
buzz off.
you...
What're you doing? He's a kid.
that's the problem. Why do people have kids?
why can't we just be born adults? Irritating bloody creatures.
hello.
she's going to break my back.
who's that guy? - I don't know.
any luck?
lesbians.
the first one said we've never met before.
the second one said the handkerchief wasn't hers
the third one said thank you, took it and left.
and then, the Japanese girl. First she bowed, then I bowed.
she bowed again, so I bowed again. Before I straightened up, she was gone.
mind-blowing. So who's left?
that Indian chick.
she's quite hot.
yes and very smart.
she's studying to be a surgeon. She's in college with Simone.
you've obviously done your research.
especially her. Because you've been staring at her for so long.
I don't know yaar, there's something about her.
there is, there is.
why don't you ask her for a dance? - Really?
you must.
got your handkerchief?
Oye... chef or architect? - I think chef's cooler.
she's going to be a surgeon.
architect then. - Good choice.
need some help? I give a very good foot massage.
really, I have like a... black belt in foot massaging.
Really? And how many girls have you tried that line on?
we're all born with certain qualities.
you're beautiful, I give a good foot massage.
nice dodge of the bouquet, by the way.
you noticed? Quite impressive.
they say that if you catch the bouquet, you're next in line to get married.
I know. So I didn't take a chance.
you have a problem with marriage? - Just a small one.
what?
husbands.
so you're going to be a surgeon? - Is the news out already?
my friend over there... Ron.
he keeps a tab on all the pretty girls.
you're trying to give me a compliment. - You noticed? Quite impressive.
dance? - I'm sorry, my shoes hurt.
so leave them here.
don't be silly. - No, I'm serious.
come on, I'll take mine off as well.
come on.
a friend of mine keeps tabs on all the handsome boys as well.
funny, she never mentioned you. What's your name?
Nick. Why? It's a nice name.
and, what do you do? - I'm an architect.
architect? - Yes, why? I mean, what do I look like?
no... I just happen to know another Nick. - And I thought I was going to be the first Nick of your life.
Oh crap!
what happened?
I hate kids! - You hate kids?
I mean, not like that, but when their parents let them loose...
I mean, there ought to be some discipline, right?
I'm sorry. You like kids huh?
love them.
Sarah, Amby, come on all the bridesmaids, lets take a photo.
excuse me.
don't go.
wait, hold it! Wait! Wait for me!
Oh god, did I miss your wedding?
Yes, I can't believe you missed my wedding.
I am so sorry baby, I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Nick, I'm in love.
right - No really, I'm in love.
I'm in love with that girl!
I'm going to marry her, have kids with her and I'll spend the rest of my life with her. I swear it!
no more champagne for you.
Where's my handkerchief ...my handkerchief?
say cheese.
everybody! Out of your clothes!
one day, one moment, one life is...
alive in now, tomorrow flies.
this day, this moment, this life, lives only for now, tomorrow flies...
like she flies.
so, embrace life with a smile and say Salaam Namaste, greet life today.
everything alive is swinging to life.
come and discover the signs of life.
but how long really will it all last crumbling like walls once the moment is past.
so lift your hands, clap a bhangra beat, come my love, let our heartbeats meet.
a moment's ecstasy, a moment's excuse, time's so heartless, so what's the use?
my love, my love, my love
so, embrace life with a smile and say Salaam Namaste, greet life today.
once upon a road you'll find a boy who'll be passionate and give you every joy.
then put it in words, around a smile.
try your luck, she may be worthwhile.
life flies, so make it quick, say your story now, my love.
youth and time are going, then gone; never to return, my love.
so, embrace life with a smile and say Salaam Namaste, greet life today.
why are you in a suit?
Nick, how long does it take to get to know someone?
depends. Sometimes one meeting can be enough, sometimes a lifetime falls short.
one meeting... so I'm not being hasty then?
what are you talking about Ron?
I'm getting married, yaar.
good for you.
I need some coffee.
Ron, are you serious?
when?
to who?
can't believe Cathy.
can't believe Ron.
I still owe you a foot massage.
I know, my feet are really hurting.
apparently coffee's really good for the feet as well.
Really?
you're a doctor, you should know.
so, shall we?
I'm sorry, I have work.
well actually, even I have a few appointments.
okay.
some other time then?
sure.
okay, bye.
Bye.
are you sure you've got to go?
okay, let me check.
Hi, it's me Ambar. Not Hambar, Ambar.
A. A for Ambar. Forget it.
can somebody cover my show today?
it's okay, I'll be there.
sorry.
what happened? - Hambar?
my boss debonair. He can't say Ambar.
I guess... I'll be going.
boss, everything's in the van. I'll see you at the restaurant.
architect.
doctor.
shit!
crap!
and she's completely ruined my reputation.
you're right. - But what a girl!
she's pretty, smart, funny.
you're right. - But she keeps calling me Nikhil Arora.
she hates me.
you're right. - But she can really play volleyball, man.
but he's never on time and he's very rude.
that's true. - But he's a damn good cook.
the food at the wedding was superb! - That's true.
so, should I call her or not? - Call her.
what if she insults me again? - You weren't any better.
you threatened to sue her. - But you told me to say that.
and I'm telling you to call her.
how can I call him? He'll never talk to me.
you insulted him first, you should call him first.
but she started it. She should call first.
but he threatened to sue me. He should call first.
it doesn't really matter who calls first.
look, I think you ought to...
you're calling him?
busy. He'll call me if he wants to.
what happened?
Well...?
busy. Forget it, she'll call if she wants to.
he was here at seven o'clock sharp for the interview.
the leopard changes his spots! Hambar versus Nick.
aren't you going to give me the rest?
these are for debonair.
Hambar versus Nick!
are you a chef or an architect?
well, an architect by qualification. But a chef by choice.
then why did you become an architect? - To make my dad happy.
and why did you become a chef? - To make myself happy.
all right.
so if you meet a beautiful girl and she asks you what you do.
what will you say?
if the girl is well-educated, like a lawyer or a doctor...
...then I'll say I'm an architect.
but if she's creative, like a writer or an RJ...
...then I'm a chef. - Oh, so your truth is changeable.
well, truth is like a recipe. Some things you hide and some you reveal...
so what's the one vital truth that you've hidden so far and from whom?
my wife doesn't know that we're married.
sorry, just kidding.
Hambar! What is this? Attack! Charge!
if you became an architect to please your dad and a chef to please yourself...
...what will you do to please your mother? Marry a nice Indian girl?
well, I don't believe in marriage.
but if Mom was alive then, yes, perhaps I'd even do that for her sake.
Oh I'm so sorry - That's okay.
were you very close to her?
very. I was only fourteen.
so young.
what is this! Where is Hambar versus Nick?
what is your favourite dish?
I'd have to say, Indian meatballs.
will you tell us the recipe? This is your punishment for being late.
sure, you're going to need onions, ginger, coriander, capsicum...
slowly, slowly! Give our listeners time to write this down.
okay, sorry.
mint, green chillies, sunflower oil.
I love you.
I love you.
are you crazy? .
no.
then what are you saying? - That I love you.
you're nuts.
Why? Because I love you?
you don't love me.
excuse me, how do you know that?
look, you decide whether you love me or not, that's your choice.
don't tell me that I'm not in love with you.
mr Nikhil Arora...
the name is Nick.
Nick, Nick you are sick! .
you're doing this just to irritate me because I insulted you on air.
no, you were right in doing that. I was late. I'm just...
all right, I'm putting an end to this.
interview over.
okay people, time to listen to some music Salaam Namaste 101. 5 FM.
lovely, mindblowing! Amazing!
Ambar... Amby listen to me.
go away.
but what have I done?
why are you so angry?
how long have you known me?
for five days.
five days?
well, I'm counting two days on the phone as well.
listen, you don't even know me.
I do.
what do you know about me? - Well...
you're an RJ, you're studying to be a surgeon.
you're very beautiful, you dance very well...
...you're superb at playing volleyball, you hate latecomers... and I love you.
you... you can't be in love with me. - Why? What's wrong with you?
with me? Nothing's wrong with me, the problem's with you. Get your head checked.
you think a two-day acquaintance is love! - What else can you call this?
ever since I've met you, I haven't been able to think of anything else.
and don't tell me that you don't feel a connection.
yesterday, there was something between us. And there still is, today.
yes there is.
but it can't be love.
Why? Amby listen...
excuse me. Yes? - Hello.
what? Oh crap.
I'm on my way.
I'm coming.
you told me to get married right? It's all your fault.
you were the one who told me to go around dropping handkerchiefs.
this is what happens when you make rash decisions.
fall in love in one day...
five days. - Get married in two. It's not a joke.
you don't know each other, you don't know anything about each other and you decide to spend the rest of your lives together?
really stupid. - Yes, he is.
but who's talking about marriage?
if we need to know each other, let's do that.
if we need to understand each other, let's spend time together.
and all this because I play good volleyball?
No! Because maybe this is love, and maybe not.
unless we give this feeling a chance how will we find out?
it won't work Nick - I know, it just won't work, Nick.
Why?
because he's a pig.
by the time you wake up, I'm at the radio station.
you're working at the restaurant from afternoon till night...
I'm in college, then I'm studying. How do we meet? Where's the time Nick?
so...
so let's live together.
what?
Yes! Think you live in the hostel all alone, and I live all alone.
let's live together.
what's he saying?
I'm just saying that Amby and I should live together, you know.
that way we... - You're talking about yourselves!
Cathy, wait.
Nick, no.
I'm not going to live with you.
Why? You just said that we don't have the time to meet each other.
this way we'll get the chance to spend some time together, live together.
Nick, we've just met three days ago.
how can I live with you?
so should we let go of our feelings because our work timings don't match?
look Amby, I don't know what we have between us. But I want to know...
because if this is love, then I don't want to lose it.
no Nick.
Hey, wait a minute... you're not thinking... listen...
we'll live in separate rooms.
I don't mean living together like... you're not thinking that, are you?
I don't mean that.
just what do you mean Nick? - I'll tell you.
we'll live in the same house, we'll eat breakfast together, watch TV together
and we'll share the chores. Then you'll find out what I'm actually like, how I live at home, when I wake up in the afternoon.
very funny, but listen...
I'll find out what you're like, what you like doing, what your problems are...
which shows you like watching, which games you like playing.
do you like scrabble? - I love scrabble.
see? I can't play scrabble.
my spellings suck. Monopoly?
and think about it, you'll never need to cook.
Nick, it's too hasty
maybe...
but if we can't tolerate each other, then we just go our separate ways. Simple
it's not so simple Nick.
I'm sorry.
fine.
maybe you're right. Maybe there's nothing between us.
and even if there is, it'll go away.
life moves on.
but ten years later, when you wake up one morning to find a fat, rich doctor snoring next to you won't you ask yourself, was there something there?
could something have happened? But then, there will be no answers
