geely also lags behind byd, which has rolled out the world's first plug-in hybrid.
geely also would set up a volvo tech center in china to help volvo speed product development and cut research-and-development costs significantly by tapping chinese engineers for basic engineering tasks, this person said.
geely and ntc are proud to have worked together and have formed a very strong co-operative relationship.
geely bought volvo from ford, and can now combine its own chinese market access and strong supply chain with volvo's technology and image-making savvy.
geely bought volvo from ford, and can now combine its own chinese market access and strong supply chain with volvo's technology and image-making savvy.
geely demonstrates how quickly this competitive threat can arise.
geely displayed 55 vehicles at the show, 11 of them new, including a plug-in electric model and five other alternative cars.
geely has a tie-up with manganese bronze, the london taxi maker, and is eyeing a move for volvo.
geely has grasped the quality point.
geely has seen off other potential buyers for volvo, including a us consortium called crown which is led by several former ford executives.
geely hopes eventually to sell 200,000 volvos annually in china, maybe 140,000 in the u.s., and 800,000 a year globally by 2020.
geely immediately poached vw's hard-charging executive stefan jacoby and instructed him to turn volvo into a bmw competitor.
geely is also interested in volvo's technology.
geely is not the only chinese company looking to snap up a u.s. brand.
geely itself uses different figures in different statements.
geely made an offer for volvo in august, two people close to the company told the financial times, and is talking to banks and other government entities about financing.
geely merged volvo as "snake swallows elephant."
geely owns about 23 per cent of manganese bronze, the uk-based producer of black london cabs, and 51 per cent of a shanghai-based joint venture that will produce the cars in china starting in december.
geely plans to build at least two car plants and an engine plant to make volvos in the country.
geely reciprocated this month announcing that it will build its volvo headquarters and an assembly plant in a shanghai industrial district.
geely referred questions to freeman shen, the swedish carmaker's new head of china operations.
geely said it wanted to buy all of volvo, which ford wants to sell in its entirety.
geely said that its chairman, li shufu, will become board chairman at volvo after the sale.
geely shanghai joint venture with british company limousines black.
geely showed a concept car at april's shanghai auto show reminiscent of a rolls-royce, but with just a single seat in the rear for the car's presumably very important passenger.
geely sold about 30000 units outside china last year and assembles cars from kits in russia, ukraine and indonesia.
geely technicians also routinely check the durability of door hinges and locks by putting a car door on a machine that opens and closes it automatically 24 hours a day.

geely was not on the list of eight state-appointed industry consolidators last year.
geely will take over volvo's international manufacturing and sales network, but will also manufacture volvos in china to meet fast-growing demand for luxury cars on the mainland.
geely's chairman and founder, li shufu, the self-styled henry ford of china, has frequently boasted that his firm would quickly become an export champion, selling 1.3m cars abroad by 2015.
geely's chairman and founder, li shufu, the self-styled henry ford of china, has frequently boasted that his firm would quickly become an export champion, selling 1.3m cars abroad by 2015.
geely's purchase of volvo cars is the biggest acquisition of an overseas brand by a chinese carmaker. It is viewed as a model of a successful acquisition in the automobile sector by beijing, which is encouraging other china carmakers to look overseas for targets.
geely's purchase, which had the support of the chinese government, makes volvo the industry's first chinese-owned luxury car brand.
geely, on the other hand, is barely known outside china, partly because its range of mainly cheap, small carsis not yet capable ofmeeting the rich world's more stringent safety and environmental regulations.
geely, one of china's biggest privately owned auto makers, is financing a roughly$ 2 billon bid for volvo with a combination of cash, bank loans and funds from a small number of investors.
geely, owner of volvo and the second-largest exporter so far this year, denies pressure at home is forcing it to seek export markets.
geely, the chinese automaker, launched its first online store on taobao this week, where buyers will pay a deposit and then visit a showroom to confirm their purchase.

geithner's comments were received with predictable hostility in beijing, but more interesting was the lukewarm response from across the atlantic--given the european union's own large current account deficit with china.
geithner's first reaction was right.
geithner's response is working in stages--first making tax changes and spending cuts that correspond to the sequester, "and then set in motion the process that will allow tax reform to come alongside some sensible long-term savings," he said.
