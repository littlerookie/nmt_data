"Regularly"-- so if one knew the schedule, then one could remove and replace bugs as needed.
so, sweep them today, see what you find, then contact me and we'll talk about your clients.
are you trying to get rid of me?
What're...?
what are you talking about?
well, your friend in Boca, the one whose daughter needs a companion,
I-I just feel like you're pushing me to take that offer.
are you unhappy with my work?
no, of course not.
I appreciate the work you've done with Holmes.
and, uh, you're turning into a...
pretty damn good investigator in your own right.
but...?
have a seat.
there's something you got to try to understand.
guys like him, they walk between the raindrops.
they don't get wet.
people like you do.
people like his ex-girlfriend do.
so you're concerned about my safety.
in case you haven't noticed, a lot of bodies been dropping around our boy of late.
you're in the danger zone, also.
I've been a cop for 30 years.
I carry a gun.
and a penis.
you think this is about you being a woman?
I'm just don't understand why you are concerned about my safety specifically.
no one, and I mean no one, is closer to this guy than you are-- you live in his house, for crying out loud.
he needs me right now.
that guy is always gonna need someone.
he may be the smartest guy I've ever met in my life.
but he is also the most self-absorbed.
he probably doesn't even recognize the danger you're in.
I do.
Captain...sorry to interrupt, but there's a Daren Sutter here from Sutter Risk Management.
says he wants to confess to the murder of Wallace Rourke.
uh, I came across Wallace Rourke after a routine background check.
he was a mechanic.
he applied for a position at a high-end dealership.
my company was responsible for reviewing the three finalists.
and how did you know he was the man who killed your sister?
I recognized him immediately.
it's been 22 years since Leah was murdered, and I still remember everything about that night.
especially him.
okay...
why don't we start at the beginning?
he found them.
Moriarty's bugs.
you think that's how Moriarty knew he killed Rourke?
he knows that someone can prove that he killed Rourke, and he's confessing to get out ahead of it, and get the best deal that he can.
if only he'd followed instruction.
come to me instead.
probably thought you were part of the conspiracy.
I suppose, in a sense, I am.
so, what now?
we've done as Moriarty asked.
I found Wallace Rourke's killer and brought him to justice.
now we await his call.
and my answers.
personal security expert Daren Sutter, who was best known for his book Friend or Foe, has confessed to the murder of Wallace Rourke, whom he alleges was responsible for the murder of his sister 22 years ago.
Leah Sutter, who is Daren's older sister...
okay, that is not distracting at all.
Moriarty must know about Sutter's arrest by now.
why hasn't he called?
Moriarty, as you so eloquently put it, is an assassin pimp.
did you really think if you solved this case, he'd keep up to his side of the bargain?
I'm well aware that Moriarty is playing with me.
just because I can't predict his next move, doesn't mean I can't expect him to make one.
why were you at the police station the other day when Sutter came in to confess?
I needed to talk to Gregson.
was this a continuation of your earlier mysterious conversation with him or is it an entirely new one?
I see Daren Sutter is under arrest.
Congratulations.
I held up my half of the bargain, I expect you to do the same.
to the contrary, you've only revealed part of the truth.
I owe you nothing.
you want the whole truth?
I know a great deal more than you think.
I know that Sutter was your target all along. I know that you had him under surveillance.
I know that you didn't want to reveal that surveillance to the authorities, so you utilized me to expose him.
you're slipping, Holmes.
I'm referring to the truth about Leah Sutter's murder.
Wallace Rourke killed her.
no, in fact, he did not.
he had an alibi.
let me guess: his mother swears that she dealt him into her bridge hand that evening.
after Rourke left the Army, his mail went to his mother's house in Connecticut, but Rourke did not.
he was in Saudi Arabia doing off-the-books work for an American oil company.
he didn't return until March 1991.
Sutter swears that he saw him.
Sutter is wrong.
he killed the wrong man.
and your work is far from done.
finish it.
Oh, good, you're awake.
Oh... how long was I out?
107 minutes.
precisely enough time to cycle through all five stages of REM and non-REM sleep, leaving your mind clear for the day's labor.
Oh... have you made any progress?
if by "progress""you mean have I proven that Moriarty was wrong and Wallace Rourke killed Daren Sutter's sister, as Daren and myself had come to believe, then, no, I have made the opposite of progress.
Ugh. So Rourke was in Saudi Arabia at the time of the murder.
I can't prove that.
nor, unfortunately, can I prove he was anywhere else.
after Rourke left the Army in 1990, his mail and his personal effects went to his mother's place in Connecticut.
there is nothing to suggest that Rourke accompanied them.
there's no credit card purchases, no...
no bank withdrawals... no financial activity at all.
Monetarily... a ghost.
maybe his mother paid for everything.
an arrangement which is not unheard of.
however, Rourke's medical records show that shortly before he left the Army, he refilled his malaria pill prescription.
he also received a typhoid booster.
so it's possible that he was planning to stay in Kuwait.
he also received a vaccination for...
meningococcal disease.
inoculation for that disease is only required for travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia!
again, not proof.
but it is a suggestive detail which I should have noticed before.
I also should have noticed the $30, 000 deposit made to Rourke from a shell corporation in April 1991, mostly likely a payment for his services to the oil company. Still not conclusive.
and our assignment was to find the killer for Wallace Rourke, not Leah Sutter.
a case which-- I have just bothered to find out
unidentified fingerprints were found on Leah's door after her death.
now they could have been left behind by someone unrelated to the case.
they could have been left by a deliveryman, pizza boy.
but the police have long suspected they were left by Leah's killer.
I'm guessing that the fingerprints were not a match for Wallace Rourke?
correct.
all of which would suggest that Moriarty may be right.
Daren Sutter killed an innocent man.
maybe Moriarty's right because he set Sutter up.
an excellent theory, hindered only by the fact that it is nigh on impossible.
it's completely possible.
Moriarty said he did things like this for a living.
Daren Sutter saw his sister's killer running away from her body. His face is etched onto his brain.
how does anyone, including Moriarty, trick a man into killing someone other than the person he saw?
it's been over 20 years. Memories get distorted, influenced...
no, no, not the memory of the person who took your sister, who took someone you loved from you.
it is a conundrum.
but once solved...
we will have the complete truth which Moriarty has requested.
this taste in my mouth is horrid.
if you want to use the toilet, I'll just turn away.
you didn't have asparagus last night, did you?
why do you think Moriarty's putting you through all this?
well, he obviously views me as an enemy.
Yes, but why?
I must have interrupted some criminal enterprise of his in London.
well, then why didn't he just kill you?
why do what he did to Irene, and why is he making you jump through hoops, now that you're in New York?
uh, he's a more complex opponent than I have faced in some time.
are you even afraid of him?
I find fear to be an unproductive filter with which to view the world. It dampens my powers of...
can't you just answer a question like a normal human being?
as I mentioned earlier, he clearly doesn't want to kill me, so, no, I'm not afraid.
well, there are ways to hurt you that do not involve hurting... you.
Watson, you know that there are risks entailed in the work that I-- that we-- perform.
you cannot do the work without undertaking those risks.
but know this:
as far as Moriarty is concerned, I will never allow any harm to come to you.
not ever.
you can't promise that.
and yet, I have.
now...
given the amount of questions which need answering, I propose that we split up.
I will go and see Mr. Sutter again, see if he can't shed some more light on the situation.
you pay a visit to Mrs. Sutter.
see if you can't convince her that access to the firm's client list might help us find the man who put them in this predicament.
okay?
Wallace Rourke killed my sister.
the evidence suggests... What evidence?
it's an assortment of facts arranged to support what you want to believe.
I don't want to believe anything.
I want to make sense of this.
I acknowledge that the evidence that Rourke was out of the country is-is far from iron-clad.
and yet it seems unwise to ignore the possibility that you were misled.
if you were, who stands to benefit from that?
you're being played.
manipulated by whoever sent you down this path.
well aware of that possibility.
and yet, as unlikely as it seems, it is at least possible that you were tricked into killing the wrong man.
okay.
you said the other day I'm a terrible liar?
you tell me if I'm lying right now.
Wallace Rourke murdered my sister.
british MAN: If there is a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed...
the word is passed to me, the matter is planned... No, I'm sorry.
I've never heard this man's voice before.
like I said, Mr. Holmes and I believe that he may be targeting one of your clients.
now, if you would allow me to look at your list, we might be able to figure out... I'm sorry.
our clients need to be able to trust our discretion as much as our ability to keep them safe.
and as far as your theory that this man is behind some conspiracy to bring Daren down...
you found bugs in here, didn't you?
let's say that we did.
there's a lot of people who'd like to know what's going on inside these walls.
and even if the man you're referring to is surveilling us, he couldn't possibly have set Daren up to kill the wrong man.
Daren saw Wallace Rourke's face that night.
isn't it possible that he got it wrong?
that after so many years of wanting to find the killer, he was ready to believe he had?
there's no way he would make a mistake like that.
you have to understand-- for Daren...
his life is divided into two halves:
before Leah's murder, and after.
did you know Daren before she died?
I wish I had.
I actually met Daren at a candlelight vigil the town was holding for Leah.
that is a very complicated time to get involved.
it was a complicated time to meet.
we didn't get involved until a few months after.
Daren found closure when he killed Wallace Rourke.
am I sad that he's in jail?
Yes.
but I'm also grateful that he finally...
found some peace.
Sherlock? You here?
Oh. Well, my meeting with Kate Sutter was a bust.
she's not giving up their client list.
her husband refused to discuss his enemies, as that would entertain the notion that he was being set up.
so I began to catalogue them myself, using some files I got from Detective Bell.
as the head of a successful risk management firm,
Sutter's put away a long list of stalkers, abusive husbands, and dangerous obsessives.
well, it looks like a pretty competitive field.
on top of that, he shared his obsession with his sister's killer with the world, so there's no shortage of people who know about his Achilles' heel.
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm just a bit stiff.
been sitting for too long.
I'm just...
forgive me.
the last few days have just-just, uh, taken their toll.
to be so...
so close some answers which I've sought for... so long.
I cannot come up empty-handed.
why don't you go get something to eat?
I will clean up.
I was just thinking how difficult this case is for you.
I know how badly Moriarty hurt you, and I was just thinking, I wish that I could fix it for you.
I appreciate the sentiment, Watson, but I fear that your goal may be unobtainable.
what about Daren Sutter?
I mean, he's a lot like you.
except he got what he wanted.
he's at peace now.
we've been trying to identify people who wanted to tear Sutter down, but what if he was tricked into killing Wallace Rourke by someone who wanted to lift him up?
if this is about Daren, I don't feel comfortable answering questions without his attorney.
well, actually, Mrs. Sutter, this is about you.
we were hoping that you might be able to confirm exactly when you met your husband.
well, as I told Ms. Watson, it was in 1991, at a vigil for his sister Leah.
so that would be after her death?
obviously.
well, being with Daren as long as you have, I'd assume you know as much about her case as anyone.
so surely you know that partial fingerprints were found on her front door that night.
they were never identified, but police thought there was a chance they belonged to the killer.
they belonged to you.
cause you were the one who came through the door that night; not your husband.
you handled Ms. Watson's phone yesterday.
we were able to pull your prints and compare them to the ones from Leah's house.
they matched.
that means you lied to me.
you did know Daren before Leah died.
GREGSON: We checked public records.
you were married to another man at this time.
and and Mr. Sutter were having an affair.
okay.
so Daren and I were together before Leah died-- so what?
so...
now we know why he was so certain he killed the right man all those months ago.
cause you told him it was the right man.
he never saw the killer's face; you did.
but you couldn't admit that without revealing your affair.
and, so, Daren became the official witness, relaying all the details you saw, as if you were the one who that came in the door that night.
problem solved.
till the police couldn't find the man you described to Daren.
that was hard on Daren.
and you.
22 years later, you came across a man who you thought would pass for an older version of the man in this sketch.
and that was Wallace Rourke.
and the only way you could give your husband the peace that he'd never had was to insist that Wallace Rourke was the man that you saw that night.
he was the man I saw that night.
Rourke killed Leah.
as a matter of fact, he didn't.
we were just able to confirm, a little while ago, he wasn't even in the country at the time of the murder.
you saw someone else that night.
now listen, your husband is gonna find out about this sooner or later.
why don't you do yourself a favor, and tell us the whole story.
I loved Leah, too.
but she wasn't my sister.
she was Daren's.
what happened that night, it... it changed him.
I didn't love him any less.
if anything, I loved him more.
doing what we do here and doing it well, that helped him.
he started to get better.
but then... when we came up on the 20th anniversary of Leah's death...
he started to slip away again.
we tried everything:
all kinds of therapy, antidepressants...
none of it helped.
and a few months ago, I came home... and I found him with a gun.
he had already written me a note saying good-bye.
I talked him down, but I knew it was just going to be a matter of time before he tried again.
I had to do something.
he looked enough like the sketch to fool Daren.
that combined with your insistence that it was the same man was all it took.
this was the only way to save Daren.
no, that's what 72-hour psych holds are for.
Rourke was an innocent man.
I didn't relish Mr. Rourke's death, but between him and Daren, it wasn't a hard choice.
neither is this: You're under arrest.
so now that we have the whole truth, why do I feel so lousy?
that's Moriarty's intention.
I think this is supposed to be a stupid lesson.
show me a man who craves vengeance and can destroy the lives of others.
you think this is his way of getting you to back off?
I think I'm gonna go and visit Daren Sutter again.
I feel an obligation to break the news of his wife's deceit personally.
I'll meet you back at the brownstone.
uh, I'm just curious why you're the one telling me all this.
I thought you deserved to know.
you said you understood me.
you experienced loss, too, but what, you couldn't wait for... one more night?
after I suffered through 22 years?
I'll delve into Leah's case.
I'll do everything possible to bring her killer to justice.
wow, you still don't get it, do you?
unless you plan on finding the man who murdered my sister and bringing him back here to me so I can strangle him with my own hands, there's never gonna be any justice.
I've just been informed of Mrs. Sutter's arrest.
finally, you've earned your answers.
I don't suppose I could convince you to deliver them in person?
the truth, Holmes, is that I hope we never meet.
my sense is that would be a great shame.
mm, for once of us.
my point. We can end this now.
I can promise you our paths will never cross again.
or, you may have your answers.
I'm curious to see which you choose.
Watson.
just checking in. How did Daren take the news?
as well as can be expected.
have you heard anything from Moriarty yet?
no, afraid not.
I'm returning home.
I'll be there shortly.
what do you think's inside?
in this day and age, the simplest way to track someone is via their cell phone.
you cloned the phone that Moriarty's been using to contact us.
I did. Right after you told me that you'd never let Moriarty hurt me.
I thought you'd try and pull something like this.
you asked me to be your partner.
you are my partner.
you lied to me about hearing from Moriarty so you could come here on your own.
Watson...
...most puzzles I see from the outside and it gives me a certain clarity.
I am right in the center of this one.
it has blurred my vision... to say the least.
I just... I just lied to protect you.
I didn't ask you to protect me.
and I did not sign on to work with you to be put on the sidelines every time you or-or Gregson or anyone decides it's too dangerous.
you want the danger.
no, I want to know that I'm not kidding myself by staying with you.
the reasons I'm here are personal.
I could say the same thing.
I have been with you every step of the way these past couple of weeks.
we have worked hard on this case.
whatever answers he's got in there for you,
I deserve them, too.
what is it?
Sherlock.
Irene...?
Irene.
so did you learn anything, Watson? Yeah.
that you fight dirty. I fight without mercy.
a habit you should develop if you hope to defend yourself against bigger, stronger opponents.
which may occur, unless we limit ourselves to investigating crimes committed by small children or large house cats.
Hello, Mistress.
what?
hang up and dial 911.
ask that Captain Thomas Gregson be informed of the call.
I'll be there shortly. Yes.
okay. Hurry along, Watson.
dead body awaits.
call came in around 10: 30.
new client looking for light CP and a little OTK. Excuse me?
CP, corporal punishment. OTK, over-the-knee spanking.
he said the door would be unlocked. I walked in, and there he was.
uh, he was like this when you got here? He had on the mask.
I gave him a few commands; he didn't respond.
at first, I thought he was stubborn. Some slaves are like that.
then I whacked him with this. Still nothing.
I took off the mask and saw that he... he was dead.
and that's when you called Holmes.
and you two know each other how?
mistress Felicia and I got chatting over an exhibition of torture devices throughout history.
realized we had a few friends in common.
we stayed in touch.
okay. Our, uh, victim's name is Titus Delancey.
apparently, he lives here, and according to this, he's the CEO of APMG Financial Consulting.
that'll pay for a few spankings.
ms. uh, Felicia, this is Detective Bell.
he'll be taking your statement.
beyond Mistress Felicia's impending arrival causing this guy to get so excited that he had a heart attack,
I don't think she killed him.
statistically speaking, it would fit.
cardiac arrest, most common cause of death for men over 50.
there's no talcum powder.
excuse me?
putting on a latex garment like this is a bit like putting on a swimsuit that's two sizes too small and already wet.
talcum powder is generally de rigueur.
while a man of Mr. Delancey's girth would not have been able to put on this suit without an assist.
so you're saying someone helped him into it.
note the blue line around his lips.
it's methemoglobinemia.
his blood cells stopped holding oxygen.
it's usually a sign of nitroglycerin overdose.
nitroglycerin is prescribed for heart problems.
if he was on it, he may have overmedicated.
well, if he's got meds, they're probably upstairs.
prescription or not, accidental overdose is unlikely.
a lethal dose for a man of his size would be, what, eight to ten tablets?
that's a lot to consume by mistake.
bourbon.
perfect vehicle for masking nitroglycerin's odor.
that could be evidence. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I've left plenty of liquid for the lab to analyze.
I'm quite confident they will confirm my findings. What findings?
fire in the hole.
nitroglycerin, definitely.
that man was poisoned.
cause when your night ends with a dead guy in a gimp suit, why not start your morning with a live one holding a bullwhip?
a thank-you gift from Mistress Felicia for assisting her.
when I wasn't practicing this morning, I was pushing forward with our case.
detective Bell has spoken with Titus Delancey's wife.
she and her two sons are preparing to move back from the family's vacation home in Bedford.
she swears that to the best of her knowledge, her husband was not into S&M.
uh... may I? Yes. Please.
she's probably telling the truth.
I mean, we were all over that house and there were no other signs of bondage gear anywhere.
which leads me to believe that the suit which Mr. Delancey was found in was brought there by the poisoner.
and, most likely, recently purchased, given the shininess of the latex.
so you think that after the killer poisoned Titus Delancey, he shoved him into a brand-new latex suit and left him to be found by a dominatrix?
he didn't just want Delancey dead, he wanted him humiliated.
a distinct possibility. And answers are within our grasp.
I have learned that that particular brand of suit is only sold in two sex shops in Manhattan.
happily for us, though sadly for submissives of size, one of those stores carries nothing bigger than a large, which means our victim's XXL suit was purchased at an establishment called The Pleasure Parlor.
Mm. I guess I know where we'll be heading this morning.
excuse me. Detective Bell, NYPD.
my colleagues and I are investigating the murder of a man found in a black latex body suit, size double-XL. We believe it was purchased here.
we were hoping you could give us the names of customers who bought one in the past month.
sure. Happy to help.
just as soon as you come back with a subpoena.
you heard the part about this being a murder investigation, right?
you job is to solve crimes.
mine is to protect my customers' privacy from a police force eager to demonize the sexually adventurous.
no, I suppose we shouldn't be surprised to find you on a moral high horse. You are wearing chaps.
excuse me. Is this your only rack of latex suits?
Yes.
Oh. We gotta figure that the killer touched all of these to find the right size, so since we can't get his name, we can at least get his fingerprints.
we should just take the whole rack down to the station, dust for prints.
excellent plan. That's thousands of dollars of merchandise.
you know you need a subpoena for those, too, right? I do.
you guys call the captain.
I'll wait here for the subpoena, wearing my badge, greeting customers.
the only extra, extra large sale this month was last night.
about 9: 30. I was here.
guy definitely wasn't shopping for himself. He was a medium at most.
okay, we're gonna need his name. I don't have it.
he paid cash.
but he got it from that ATM.
in case you're unsure what you're looking at, Mr. Jefferies, that's you, at 9: 38 last night.
and unless your apartment looks just like a sex shop, you were not, as you claimed a few minutes ago, home watching TV.
I went for a walk. I forgot that I stopped in there.
apparently, that's not all you forgot.
you bought a fetish suit and shoved your boss into it.
probably right after you poisoned him.
no, I did not, I did not... poison Titus.
I already told you that.
Hey. You're in a lot of trouble, Mr. Jefferies.
we can't help you if you don't level with us.
okay. I did buy the fetish suit.
and I did put Titus in it. But I did not kill him.
Titus and I were supposed to have dinner last night.
I arrived at his house around 8: 45. When he didn't answer the door, I went around back.
the patio door was open, and I saw Titus in the living room, lying on the floor.
I went in, and when I got there, he was already dead.
no pulse, no breathing. I just assumed he'd had a heart attack.
I swear to you, I didn't know he had been poisoned until I heard about it this morning on the news.
you're head of acquisitions at APMG, correct?
so with Titus gone, I'm sure you're in the running for CEO?
Yes, I am. But I didn't need for Titus to die in order for that to happen.
a few weeks ago, when Titus announced that he was retiring at the end of the year,
I was already on the short list to replace him. Then why put the suit on him?
why call the dominatrix?
okay, Titus's contract guaranteed him a huge retirement payout.
$125 million lump sum. If he dies, that money goes to his family.
his contract also contained a morals clause.
so you dressed him up in bondage gear, set him up with a dominatrix, all so that the company could save giving him a retirement bonus?
that's $125 million extra in our coffers.
the year-end bonuses would have been huge.
guys, okay, if the charge here is that I am a greedy jerk with really questionable judgment, then I'm guilty. But I swear to you, I'm not a murderer.
I just got off the phone with the lab.
they confirm the nitroglycerin in Titus Delancey's glass but said the bottle of bourbon was clean. Which means whoever poisoned him was in the room when he poured his drink.
the security guard at APMG puts Jefferies at the office till about 8: 00 p. m. which according to the M. E. is when Delancey died.
so Mr. Jefferies used his boss's corpse as a dress-up doll but didn't kill him.
our poisoner is still at large.
I asked Delancey's wife to let me know when she and the boys got back to Riverdale.
she says she'll be there in 20. All right.
I talked to Titus yesterday afternoon.
he-he didn't mention any plans for the evening.
and you and the boys stayed overnight in Bedford.
Yes. We have a house there.
it was the nanny's night off.
so the three of us just had a quiet evening at home.
Mrs. Delancey, can you think of anyone that might have wanted to harm your husband?
I can't think of anyone specific.
but Titus was a very successful man.
that's not easy to pull off without making some enemies.
those poor boys.
they've been through this once already.
their mother died of cancer five years ago.
when did you and Mr. Delancey get married?
about three years ago. Peri?
Oh, God. I got here as quickly as I could.
I'm so sorry. How are the boys?
struggling. Zack, especially.
this is our nanny, Anne Barker.
uh, this is Captain Gregson.
he and his colleagues are here investigating what happened.
Oh. Anne.
Barker? Yes.
Yes. Sherlock Holmes. Nice to meet you.
I'm gonna check on the boys, okay? What's wrong?
uh, a moment outside, please.
excuse us.
do you remember the Abigail Spencer case, in the early '90s?
15-year-old Michigan girl. She was accused of fatally poisoning her father.
Yeah. It was all over the papers. Yeah.
well, that also involved a nitroglycerin overdose.
I followed the trial quite closely. I was fascinated by it.
I was 15 years old myself at the time.
she was acquitted, right?
Yep, many people continued to believe that she had, indeed, killed her father.
she was scrutinized by the media, she was harassed, so one day, she just packed up her stuff, disappeared.
presumably to start a new somewhere else.
never heard from again.
the woman we just met, the nanny.
she was introduced as Anne Barker, but I'm quite certain that her real name is Abigail Spencer.
uh, for the record, your current legal name is Anne Barker, but you were born Abigail Spencer, correct?
Yes, I was born Abigail Spencer.
and back in 1991, you were accused of murdering your father with nitroglycerine.
accused and acquitted. Lot of people thought you got away with murder.
Really? I had no idea. Certainly not why I changed my name.
look, my dad was not a nice man, okay?
he was cruel, and he beat me.
so when he died, I didn't weep or wail or do any of those things teenage girls apparently do when their dad dies.
so everyone assumed that I killed him.
let's talk about Titus Delancey.
okay. Are you aware he was poisoned?
Yes, and to answer your next question, no, I didn't kill him.
then why are you sounding so defensive?
because I'm being interrogated by the police.
so I feel like being defensive is sort of a natural reaction.
you don't find it the least bit coincidental that he was killed with the exact poison that killed your father?
no, I find it extremely coincidental, but I didn't do it.
any idea who did? I have no idea, okay?
I'm the nanny. He and I weren't close.
we didn't spend a lot of time together. Where were you last night?
home alone. That's a lousy alibi, Abigail.
Yeah, well, if I knew I needed one, I would've invited somebody over.
I keep to myself. I have ever since the trial.
lost every friend you ever had, didn't you?
the ones who thought I was guilty were afraid of me.
and the ones who knew I was innocent couldn't be around me without being in every paper in the country.
the media ruined my life, and now it's about to happen all over again, thanks to you.
after I ran away, I got plastic surgery.
no one has recognized me in 19 years.
how did you do it? Your voice.
I just recognized it from the media coverage.
look, I know you can't prove that I had anything to do with Mr. Delancey's death.
if you could've, you would've arrested me back at the house.
so, if you don't have any more questions, I would like to leave please.
I've spent enough of my life being accused of things I didn't do.
doesn't feel right, letting her go. I mean, you talk about a solid suspect.
she was right; we don't have enough evidence to hold her yet.
I don't believe she did it. You're the one who pointed her out.
her presence at the Delancey home was too remarkable to ignore, but her haptics suggest she's telling the truth.
Titus Delancey was killed with nitroglycerine.
so was her dad; that can't be a coincidence.
I agree, but I think the similarities are quite deliberate, and I think whoever poisoned Mr. Delancey intends to frame Ms. Spencer.
that would mean the killer knew who she was.
she said no one had recognized her in 19 years.
as far as she knows.
so you want to tell me how you knew about her tattoo?
beg your pardon? Abigail's tattoo.
when you recognized her today, you said it was because of her voice, but I think it was something more than that.
you fixated on the tattoo on her wrist.
at first I thought you remembered it from a picture that was taken during her trial, but then, when I looked back at coverage,
Abigail did not have a tattoo.
so how could you have recognized it? Impressive, Watson.
quite impressive.
you know, the truth is that Abigail Spencer and I are old acquaintances, after a fashion.
by the time I was 15,
I was fascinated by murder and all things...
criminal.
Abigail was so beautiful, and her father's fortune so vast that the UK tabloids actually deigned to cover the case.
over time, they lost interest. I did not.
I became fascinated by the question of her guilt.
so I wrote to her.
a letter comprised of very direct questions about her life and her father's death.
so she wrote back.
Yeah, we corresponded throughout the trial and for a while afterwards.
in one of her later missives, she mentioned that she wanted to get a tattoo of a phoenix on her wrist.
a symbol of her rebirth after her ordeal.
why didn't she recognize your name today?
I mean, Sherlock Holmes is pretty hard to forget.
in my teenage years, I was a lot less self-assured than I am today.
I yearned for a more typical name.
so for a while, I attempted to be known as Sean Holmes.
didn't stick, but Sean and Abigail's correspondence became a very real window into the criminal mind.
are you saying that she confessed to killing her father to you?
she never directly addressed the issue.
without knowing, she revealed details, which I believe, filled in the holes in the case against her.
as for her relationship with her father, well, she shared some things which must have been quite humiliating for her.
she left me in little doubt that he was, indeed, physically abusive and that she was responsible for his death.
sounds like she really opened up to you. She was an excellent research subject.
she was very forthcoming, attributable primarily to her isolation at the time, and my promise that whatever she shared with me would be kept in the strictest confidence.
that doesn't sound like you at all.
I mean, not telling anyone that you'd figured out that she was guilty?
trial was over.
double jeopardy protected her from a second, and I was quite confident that although she had killed, she was not a killer.
she posed no threat to anyone other than her father. Titus Delancey might disagree.
well, as I told you, I don't believe Abigail's responsible.
you think she's being framed, but how can you be so sure?
you are relying on a judgment you made when you were 15. Well, when I made it is irrelevant.
what matters is I was right.
I believe that when I have identified the person who has uncovered Abigail's secret, we'll have our killer.
I don't know who let you in, but you're not allowed to be up here.
my name is Sherlock Holmes. I work with the police.
we met yesterday. Well, unless you have a warrant,
I don't want to talk to you, either.
you used to know me. By another name.
Sean Holmes.
I don't understand.
you could have told me yesterday.
well, I confess to being a little thrown when I saw you.
also, I didn't know how to explain our relationship to my colleagues.
I never thought this would happen.
I never thought I would meet you.
I used to look forward to receiving your letters so much.
and I yours. Peri fired me.
I didn't even get to say good-bye to Graham or Zack.
I'm sure you've seen my friends who are outside the building.
you could have pulled me aside yesterday. You could have kept this between us.
I'm sorry for any turmoil I have caused you.
I supposed I should apologize, too.
I'm the one who stopped writing.
I'm the one who disappeared without saying good-bye.
I understood.
you needed to leave Abigail behind.
so the phoenix might rise.
I came here today because I- I don't believe that you killed Titus Delancey.
nor do I think it's a coincidence that he was poisoned with the same agent used to kill your father.
I think someone is taking advantage of your proximity to the man to get away with murder.
you think someone's setting me up?
has anyone you know asked any prying questions, taking excessive interesting in your past?
no one.
something? Anything?
last month, I was running errands for Peri, and I kept seeing the same brown sedan in the review mirror. Following you?
I don't know. I- I took down the license plate number in my phone just in case it ever happened again, but it never did.
I should pass this along to my colleagues.
that's it?
you show up after all these years, and then you just leave?
this might be important. I don't have anyone I can talk to.
I can't leave my apartment without the press eating me alive.
the letters that you used to write me got me through times like these, and now you're here in person.
I'm afraid.
and I could really use a friend right now.
turns out he was hired by none other than Peri Delancey, our victim's wife.
and according to the PI, Peri was hoping Titus was having an affair.
it seems that in her prenup, she was limited to a very small amount in the event of a divorce, unless she caught him cheating.
so, she has the PI check out all the women in her husband's life.
including Abigail.
Yeah, and the thing is, Titus wasn't sleeping with anyone, which put a damper on Peri's divorce plans, but, in the process, the PI uncovered Abigail's true identity.
investigator turned over his report a full two weeks ago.
she doesn't tell anyone, she doesn't fire Abigail.
she just keeps letting a suspected poisoner make sandwiches for her stepkids.
peri told us she was at the Bedford house with the boys the other night, but once we spoke to them on their own, they said they were watching TV in their rooms.
it wouldn't have been hard for her to sneak out, poison Titus, and make it back before anyone noticed.
so it looks like Sherlock was right;
Abigail was being framed.
my client is ready to make a statement.
the night Titus died, I met Dr. Phillip Malone at the Campbell Bar in Mount Kisco as 7: 00 p. m.
several members of the staff can confirm that I was there most of the evening. You and Dr. Malone having an affair?
because if that's the case, you didn't need to bring a lawyer with you.
that's not it. As you would eventually discover,
Dr. Malone has a prior arrest for illegal distribution of prescription meds.
my client is happy to testify against Dr. Malone if you'll agree not to bring charges against her in the death of her husband.
well, if your client has a solid alibi, what would we charge her with?
we'd like to avoid an attempted murder charge.
Mrs. Delancey, what medication did you purchase from Dr. Malone?
nitroglycerin.
which you were planning to use to kill your husband.
I was... considering it.
I figured if I went through with it, I could call in an anonymous tip, tell the police about who Anne really was, and she'd get the blame.
but to be clear it was just something I thought about.
I don't think I ever could have actually hurt Titus.
so your client's statement is that she couldn't have killed her husband because she was too busy planning to kill her husband?
first time in my career someone's alibi for murder has been that they were busy planning the same murder.
if it weren't so frustrating, it would be interesting.
Yeah, well, it worked out for Peri Delancey.
six months on drug charges beats life in prison.
why did you add a photograph of the two Delancey kids?
only one of them is a suspect.
a short while ago, I obtained a copy of Mr. Delancey's estate plan.
now that he's dead, a large part of his fortune goes into trusts for his sons; Millions of dollars they will be able to access as soon as they're 18.
that's only one year away for Graham.
also, the young man no longer has an alibi.
peri Delancey has admitted she wasn't actually with the boys that evening.
so Graham himself could easily have snuck back home.
there's no evidence that he knew about Abigail's history as a poisoner.
the very topic I plan to discuss when I confront him tomorrow.
isn't tomorrow Titus Delancey's memorial service?
precisely. You heard what you just said, right?
you're planning to harass a teenage boy while he's mourning his father?
if he's the poisoner, he won't really be mourning, will he?
you know, the police think Abigail is their best suspect?
I do. As I told you, I do not share their suspicions.
that's because you were in love with her.
What?! Back when you were a kid when you were writing her, you fell in love with her.
you spent almost three hours at her house today.
and in spite of what happened with Peri Delancey, no one thinks she's being framed except for you.
I was quite young when my father shipped me off to boarding school, right?
I struggled. I was different from my classmates.
I was, uh, well, I was more intelligent. I-I was brash.
so they tormented me mercilessly.
Yes, I remember you saying once that you had been bullied, but I wasn't sure if you were telling the truth.
it happened. I overcame it.
it was a different time back then.
there was no such thing as harassment via text or circulation of cruel cell phone videos.
no, my bullies had one tool at their disposal: violence.
so I was beaten.
fairly savagely and with great frequency.
that's when you started writing Abigail.
she was being abused and so were you. Uh, I meant what I said before.
my-my interest in her was academic.
she was to be a subject of study, nothing more.
I confess, as our correspondence continued,
I grew more anticipatory of her letters.
they were a welcome distraction from my life.
they were an oasis from school.
well, it certainly sounds like you had feelings for her.
perhaps but nothing so mundane as love.
I was adrift back then. I had-had no purpose.
my so-called peers made me feel that that might always be the case.
Abigail, she gave me a gift.
a view inside a mind capable of murder.
so she was your first.
killer, yeah.
without intending to, she...
she helped me understand who I was and...
and what I might do with my life.
you never told her you thought she was guilty, did you?
I didn't want her to stop writing.
I didn't think she'd be a threat to anyone else.
there was no point.
I get that.
but if she killed Titus Delancey, then she's got...
then she'll be handed over to the police and she'll be punished.
but for now, I'd like to try to help her.
I'm Joan. This is Sherlock. We met the other day.
Yeah, you're the people that took Anne away.
of course I remember you.
how are you and, uh, Zack holding up?
the past two days, our dad was murdered, our nanny was accused of the crime and our stepmom confessed to thinking about killing him.
we're great.
I know it's a lot.
Zack's pretty mixed up. Especially about Peri.
he liked her a lot more than I did.
but our Aunt Susan's here now.
She's-she's great. She's taking care of us.
were you aware that your father's will leaves you and your brother a substantial amount of money?
Yeah, I guess. Never really thought about it.
Why? Financial gain has motivated many a murderous endeavor.
wait a second, are you saying you think I killed my dad?
your stepmother's confession has weakened your alibi.
we know that she left your home in Bedford the night of the murder.
your brother was in his room watching television.
it would've been easy enough for you...
No! No way.
everyone knows it was Anne or Abigail, whatever her name is.
she did it. It's all in the papers.
do you have any notion as to why she would've murdered your... father?
unlike you, she had nothing to gain. No, but she and my dad had issues.
we haven't heard that from anyone else.
all I know is they got in a big argument just last week.
and I can prove it. Zack had learned this new parkour move and he wanted me to film him.
then I realized my dad was going off on Abigail in the hallway. I got it all on my phone.
where did you get this? Graham.
police technicians were able to enhance the audio so we could discern some of what Titus was saying.
as far as we can make out, someone had attempted to access his tablet without his permission and he was upset about it.
he was crazy that day. He thought I'd tried to steal it or something.
had you? No.
of course not.
you should know that, as we speak, the police are attempting to locate his tablet at the Delancey home.
they're hopeful that it will shed some light on the investigation. Why would it?
it's been theorized that... Titus uncovered your secret, that he had evidence of it on his tablet and his aim was using that against you.
you're a beautiful woman. He was in a bad marriage.
perhaps he prevailed on you for other services.
that's not true.
Mm? It was rather a heated argument. And frankly, I'm...
curious as to why you never mentioned it before.
I forgot about it. He...
Titus apologized. He said he o-overreacted.
it wasn't a big deal.
you-you understand that I'm trying to help you, and I can't do that unless you're completely honest with me.
of course I'm being honest.
I've always been honest with you.
well, we both know that's not true.
what are you talking about?
I know that you poisoned your father, Abigail.
why are you saying that?
you said that you believed me.
I avoided the subject whenever possible.
not all the time. You said you believed me.
in a letter dated September '91, you mentioned the passing of a beloved neighbor, heart condition. You often ran errands for her.
she was the unwitting supplier of the nitroglycerin that you used to poison your father, was she not?
january '92, you wrote that you were with a classmate at the time of his death, but at trial you said that you went to the store.
shall I go on? Because I can.
I know the truth, Abigail.
I've known for 22 years.
get out.
Abigail... Get out.
Hey. The guys are striking out here.
I mean, there's no sign of Delancey's tablet.
what about you? I don't know.
I might have something.
looks like someone tried to pry this drawer open.
other than you. Give me some credit. I used to be a surgeon.
I would never leave a mess like this.
well, why would someone lock an empty drawer?
habit.
well, we know from the video that he was angry because he thought that Abigail had gotten ahold of his tablet.
right? So if this is where he kept it and if there was sensitive information about her past on it, maybe these scratches made him suspicious.
you know, my ex used to keep her tablet in a case that looked just like a book.
maybe it's on one of these shelves.
there are five air vents in this room. And the capital of Michigan is Lansing.
you know you're starting to sound like your partner.
well, don't you think it's odd? I mean...
the room is not that big, right?
there's usually one vent for intake, and then...
...maybe one or two to blow cold air.
five is definitely overkill. How do you know that?
my uncle was a contractor.
Hey, check this out.
this isn't a vent.
it's just supposed to look like one.
Watson, I'm on route.
I will be at the Delancey home shortly. You can turn around. We found the tablet.
was there evidence he knew about Abigail?
no.
but I think you were right last night.
I think maybe Graham did kill his father. What did you find?
videos of Titus with Graham.
he was sexually abusing him.
ms. Moore? Tom Gregson.
appreciate you bringing your nephew in to talk to us.
marsha Whitman, I represent the family.
how do you do? This is Ms. Watson, Mr. Holmes.
they consult for the department.
they're the ones who harassed Graham after the service yesterday.
we, uh, apologize for any violation of decorum, but as it turns out, it was absolutely necessary.
if we hadn't spoken, we may very well have never learned the truth.
you recognize that, right?
it's my dad's. Where'd you get that?
it was hidden in your father's office. You tried to take it out of his desk last week, not Abigail.
maybe you were thinking about turning him in.
or maybe you were thinking about stopping him from hurting your little brother, too?
what do you mean "hurting"? Graham, what's he talking about?
nothing.
it's okay, Graham, you can tell us the truth now. I don't understand.
are they saying that...?
are they saying your father...? I don't want to talk... with you about this.
Graham? No!
I want you to leave.
both of you, now. I can't allow you to...
I don't care! Just leave now!
Mr. Delancey is 17.
he is within his rights to talk to us alone.
what's on there doesn't prove anything.
what it proves is that your dad was a monster.
and it certainly suggests that you have a very understandable motive for wanting him dead.
you knew about Abigail's past. That's why you used nitroglycerin.
that's not true.
this is a report prepared for your stepmother by a private investigator she'd hired to look into your father.
these are your fingerprints.
Abigail's whole story is in that file.
a story which independently inspired you and your stepmother to conceive the same plan.
it seems that killing your father and framing Abigail was an idea whose time had come.
only you beat Peri to the punch.
you procured some nitroglycerin illegally online, if I had to guess.
a few tablets in your father's bourbon and... it was done.
I doubt very much that you relish what your plan means for Abigail.
but compared to the hell that your life had become?
to the idea that your secret would get out?
to the idea that it could happen all over again to Zack?
it must've felt like you had little choice.
excuse me. I'm looking for Graham Delancey.
his little brother just called me in tears, saying the police came and took him away.
Yeah, Graham is in with the captain right now. Why?
I'm afraid I really can't discuss...
you. You saw Graham almost every day.
did you have any idea what was going on?
miss Moore, please. Wait, what are you talking about?
I didn't mourn your father's death, not for a moment.
but Abigail loves you.
like you were one of her own.
and I know you care about her.
if you stay silent, she'll go to prison.
does she really deserve that for something that she didn't do?
graham, you can help her.
and we can help you.
you just need to tell us the truth.
I need a few minutes alone with my client. Now.
what the hell is going on? Abigail Spencer came in.
she ran into Graham's aunt and lawyer in the hall...
and they told Abigail about Graham's father.
next thing I know, Abigail wants to make a confession.
she says she's the one who poisoned Titus Delancey.
Crawford and Gleason are in interrogation talking to her now.
she say why she did it?
according to her, Titus uncovered her real identity a few weeks ago.
he was using it to try to extort sexual favors.
the district attorney will not pursue a case against Graham without a confession.
which he is unlikely to give us now that you have confessed to killing his father.
why did you do it?
kill Titus? I already explained that.
no, why did you confess to a murder that you didn't commit?
I am a murderer. You said so yourself.
you were right.
Graham poisoned his father.
you and I both know that.
Graham is an amazing kid, and he has his whole life ahead of him.
he shouldn't be in prison.
there's no doubt in my mind that I did the right thing.
by killing Titus Delancey.
you know, you don't even need to do this.
we have proof of what Titus did to Graham.
he committed murder under mitigating circumstances.
it's unlikely he will serve more than 18 months.
18 months.
that's about the amount of time you and I wrote letters to each other.
felt like a lifetime, didn't it?
especially when you're branded the kid who killed your dad.
and Graham deserves better than that.
you're innocent.
no.
innocent?
he was being brutalized right in front of me, and I should have seen it, and I should have stopped it.
sooner.
Titus got what's coming to him.
and now, so am I.
finally.
thank you for agreeing to speak with me.
my school is near here.
my aunt thought it was too soon for me to go back, but...
I don't know.
I'm tired of being at home.
Abigail's confession aside, you and I both know the truth.
I'm gonna be watching you.
and if you resort to those extreme tactics again in the future, I'm gonna make sure you're brought to justice.
is that clear?
have you spoken with anyone about what happened to you?
my Aunt Susan tried to ask me some questions last night, but...
it happened. It's over.
talking about it won't change anything.
you're wrong.
I have never known a betrayal as-as profound as what you've experienced.
but I do know that being victimized is...
is corrosive.
and sometimes, talking about it that can help.
so you ever want to talk about it with someone who knows the story in its entirety...
...I'm at your disposal.
too loud? Sorry.
I went downstairs to get some cereal.
didn't want to miss anything.
this city has excellent scanner apps, but there's nothing like the tactility of the original devices,
all those dials and buttons.
you like pushing buttons; I'm stunned.
you've been glued to these for the last few days.
it's a slow week.
at least in regards to murder and mayhem.
captain Gregson hasn't called once.
maybe some lunatic will put his mother-in-law in the wood chipper, give you something to do today.
uh, I need to talk to you about something.
that's never good.
your father e-mailed me last night before I went to bed.
he's coming into town for business.
wants to have dinner.
what's so funny?
him. Dinner. Us.
you.
remind me, Watson: how many times have you actually met the man?
never.
that's because he secured your services as my sober companion electronically.
Yeah, but... - And all of your subsequent correspondence has been via e-mail or through one of his legion of personal assistants.
so?
so, take it from someone who has spent incrementally more time with him than you:
he has zero intention of meeting us for dinner this evening.
what are you talking about?
...at Beach 17 Street.
10-4, multiple units responding.
detective, Captain, show me 84 at the scene, over.
what is it?
get dressed. We're leaving.
do you want to tell me what you just heard?
"10-66" Code for unusual incident.
it can mean one of only three things.
location of the incident-- Far Rockaway Beach
indicates it's neither a train collision nor a building collapse, which leaves only one possibility.
plane crash.
I didn't realize you also investigated accidents?
we need to find Captain Gregson.
he 84'd on the scanner. I heard his voice.
"84" is confirmation he had arrived on the scene.
what are you doing here?
I heard what happened on the scanner; I thought I might be able to be of assistance.
this isn't a crime scene; it's a crash site.
I'm a jack-of- many-trades.
when it comes to aviation and air accidents, I'm something of an expert.
good to know, but we've already got all the experts we need.
this is their scene, not mine.
department's just here to lend a hand.
captain Gregson? - Yeah?
some of our looky-loos are getting a little too close for comfort.
sergeant, you hear that?
excuse me, Miss, uh... - Molinari.
what exactly are we looking at?
engine failure? Bird strike? Fatigued wing spar?
ms. Molinari, uh, this is, uh, Sherlock Holmes.
he's a consultant with the NYPD.
miss Watson.
you have a consultant for plane crashes?
no, he's... - A specialist in the field of deductive reasoning.
and unraveling the complex chain of events that can turn a triumph of human innovation into a smoldering pile of wreckage in seconds.
well, I can't think of a more compelling application than that.
well, thank you for the offer, Mr. Holmes, but I think we have things covered.
go home, okay?
if you really need something to do, I'll send you some cold case files when I get back to the precinct.
Holmes!
how many of the passengers were attorneys?
all of them. How did you...?
the toiletry kit.
it's emblazoned with the logo "VeriScript."
that's a court reporting company hired to transcribe depositions.
obviously given to the lawyers as some sort of promotional gift, help drum up business.
this man's leg was nearly amputated by a piece of fuselage, yet there's virtually no evidence of blood loss on his pants.
laceration like that while his heart was still pumping, that'd make quite a mess, no?
to put it mildly.
blunt force trauma on the back of his head.
it's a nasty one at that.
someone caved his skull in before the plane hit the ground.
this man didn't die in a plane crash...
he was murdered.
note the distinctive shape of the wound, the depth, the severity of damage to the bone, gray matter.
the murder weapon wasn't just heavy; it had two prongs at the tip.
a wrench? - Large one.
blow would've killed him instantly.
has the, uh, has the voice recorder been recovered from the cockpit?
not yet.
any eyewitness accounts of the crash?
one, a jogger.
she said that the plane was gaining altitude when the nose suddenly went straight up.
it climbed like that for a while, then shuddered, tipped to the right and went into a tailspin.
I was thinking wake turbulence or elevator control failure.
might want to add "wrench-wielding madman" to that list.
the passengers were all attorneys with the same white shoe firm.
two men, one woman.
the odds of one of them attacking the other in the back of this small plane with a wrench...
you can see how that might be distracting to a pilot, no? Hmm?
unless the pilot was the killer.
you're saying that the pilot got up from his controls to attack a passenger?
drivers get road rage.
can a pilot get air rage?
would you come with me? Let's talk logistics.
did you find something?
sand.
well, yeah... th-these granules aren't frosted.
natural sand is, um, it's smoother, weathered.
the city must have trucked in new sand to offset the erosion on the beach.
are you okay? You seem a little off, even for you.
four people are dead, Watson.
I'm just trying to do my part.
I get it, but whoever killed that attorney must have died in that crash, too, right?
obviously.
well, then if there's no killer on the loose, I just, I don't understand why you're sticking around.
because the killer hasn't been identified yet.
we have three suspects.
dead, alive, doesn't matter.
two of them are innocent of the crime.
don't you think we owe it to their loved ones to prove that?
absolutely, but all the police have to do is find the murder weapon.
then they can compare fingerprints.
what if they don't find it? What then? Hmm?
also, the killer committed a murder on a very small plane with a very large wrench.
now, if the crime was spur-of-the-moment, what was the wrench doing there, hmm?
if it was premeditated, what was the killer thinking?
he or she
waited until they were in an extremely confined space with their would-be victim and two witnesses. Hmm?
that seems like a strange time and place to commit a violent homicide, wouldn't you agree?
it's just... there's a story here, Watson.
and we can help tell it.
or do we just need to stay busy enough to miss dinner with your father?
so, CSU's en route to process the scene.
NTSB will work their crash, and we'll work our murder.
if I may make a suggestion, Captain.
we start by speaking with the people who were the last to have seen the victims alive.
good idea.
Joe and I were friends for over 20 years.
this would be Joe Newell, the pilot? - Yeah.
were you very familiar with the passengers?
Walter Devlin flew with us quite a bit.
but that was mostly for cases that he or his law firm were taking on.
what about his associates?
uh, Hank Gerrard and Ellie Wilson?
Yeah, they accompanied him once or twice, but I never actually met them.
you weren't at the airstrip when the plane took off this morning?
I own the company. I don't fly the planes.
so I'm not always there when they take off.
your friend, Joe-- was he an irascible type?
Short-tempered?
no. He's ex-military.
Joe didn't have a temper.
we have reason to believe that there was an incident shortly after takeoff.
uh, Hank Gerrard may have been attacked.
I don't understand.
and you think that's what might have brought down the plane?
we're waiting for the NTSB to make their official report.
look, I don't know how much help it'd be, but we put a security camera in the parking area last year after a couple cars were broken into.
you might be able to see the passengers arriving.
we'll take it, definitely.
but as far as Joe goes, all I can tell you is he was as good a man as he was a pilot, and he never had one problem with any passenger.
so, if Mr. Gerrard was attacked, Joe wasn't the guy who did it.
learn anything?
only that the pilot's boss thought very highly of him.
doesn't mean he didn't go mental on a passenger, mind you.
I just got an e-mail from your dad's personal secretary.
Ah, told you he'd back out.
actually, he was wondering if we could do dinner at Lure at 6: 00.
look, I know you have your issues, but I think it's important that we go.
of course you do. He's signing your checks.
remind me, how are you paying for the brownstone again?
he obviously cares about you.
if he didn't, he would not have put you through rehab and he certainly would not have hired me to work with you.
I'm about to disabuse you of several notions, so please listen very carefully.
one: my father does not care about me.
he does what he does out of a sense of familial obligations.
big difference.
two: he does not care about you or what you think.
meeting you would be a formality.
and three: as I've already told you, your concern is unwarranted, 'cause he has absolutely no intention of showing up tonight.
how could you possibly know that?
because he is a serial absentee.
a pathological maker and breaker of promises.
been that way since I was a boy.
fool me once, shame on you. Fool me ad nauseam...
Holmes.
got something for you and the captain.
captain, just got off the phone with one of the junior partners at Walter Devlin's firm.
he said that Devlin, Hank Gerrard and Ellie Wilson were headed to a retreat in Martha's Vineyard to work on a class action case against a company called Carmanto Foods.
there were allegations that the company's sugar substitute causes cancer.
plaintiffs were seeking damages in the neighborhood of a hundred mil.
seems there was a lot of infighting among our three dead lawyers about how to proceed.
anyone particularly angry with the murder victim, Hank Gerrard?
as a matter of fact, yeah.
he was butting heads with his boss, Walter Devlin.
Devlin's inclination was to settle, Gerrard's was to keep fighting.
they'd had a few loud arguments at the office.
guy I spoke to thought Gerrard was gonna get fired if he didn't back down.
sounds like we've got our primary suspect.
still doesn't explain why the head of a successful law firm would've brought a wrench aboard a small aircraft.
it's possible we're about to find out.
ms. Molinari of the NTSB.
they just found the plane's black box.
key Star two eight three hotel foxtrot, state your position.
air traffic control.
key Star two eight three hotel foxtrot... - That's the pilot, Joe Newell.
...endurance 90 minutes.
thank you, Key Star. You're clear to climb to 3, 400.
Walter Devlin, Ellie Wilson.
come back here, we'll do ours.
key Star to ATC, what's my best vector?
you cannot protect Hank, Ellie; not from me.
what the hell, what the hell's going on back there?!
Damn!
get it down. Get it down!
what is it?!
key Star to ATC, we have an emergency.
Oh, God.
atc to Key Star: Are you able to maintain altitude?
that's a negative.
brace! Brace!
I can't believe it, but it sounds like you were right.
no, I was mistaken.
there wasn't any fight.
but you can hear...- An entirely one-sided argument.
Mr. Gerrard never says a word.
but the junior partner that you spoke with said that he and Devlin were prone to loud disagreements.
yet this morning, Hank Gerrard doesn't even get a syllable in edgeways.
also I'm assuming that if your people had found a murder weapon by now, you would have told us.
it seems strange, given that every other piece of debris seems to have been accounted for.
could've ended up in the water.
well, nothing else seemed to.
okay, how do you explain the pilot's initial exchange with air traffic control?
he says, and I quote,"Three souls aboard."
three. Not four.
he could have meant three passengers.
pilots often don't include themselves in the count.
I believe this one did.
what are you saying?
that he didn't know Hank Gerrard was in the cabin?
I'm saying Hank Gerrard wasn't in the cabin.
but that's impossible.
his body was in the wreckage.
allow me, if you will, another interpretation of the evidence.
Hank Gerrard wasn't killed on the plane, he was killed elsewhere, and earlier in the morning.
it would explain why the wrench hasn't turned up, 'cause it wasn't on the plane.
because the crime scene, crash site, two entirely different places, hmm?
the killer bludgeoned Mr. Gerrard, then, for reasons yet to be determined, conceals his body in the cargo hold.
Mr. Devlin, he just assumes that Gerrard has missed the flight, so he calls his absentee colleague to scold him.
that's would explain why you don't hear Gerrard's voice on the recording, 'cause Devlin's tirade was a voice message.
now Ms. Wilson, she tries to calm Devlin.
she leads him towards the back of the plane.
now, neither of them knows there's a 200-pound corpse just inches below their feet.
the sudden weight imbalance threw the plane into a dive.
did you recover Mr. Gerrard's cell phone?
Yes, but it's damaged.
may I?
if I'm right, he'll have a new voicemail.
DEVLIN: I made you, Hank.
took you in and built you up from nothing.
now you pull a stunt like this?
you think I'm gonna let it slide? Guess again.
Mr. Devlin and Ms. Wilson did not kill Hank Gerrard;
they didn't even know where he was.
Joe Newell, an experienced pilot, would've known better than to stash the extra weight of his body in the cargo hold and risk exactly the kind of accident that occurred.
they may be dead, but the person who killed Hank Gerrard is not.
we have a living, breathing murderer to find after all.
what was the killer thinking?
why stuff Gerrard's body in the hold of the plane, like so much luggage?
surely he knew it would be discovered when the plane reached Martha's Vineyard.
did he want it found?
if yes, why?
was it intended as some sort of message?
if so, to whom?
can I ask you a question?
can I stop you?
are you afraid of flying?
it's just you pursuing this case didn't make sense to me at first.
as far as you knew, it was just an accident.
but then at the crash site this morning, you weren't yourself.
myself?
you got distracted by sand on a beach.
and look at that board.
normally, you would have put up every picture you had from the crash site.
but instead, there's just images of what the plane used to look like.
I've already examined those pictures, and they yielded nothing.
now since you're a disgraced ex-surgeon and not a disgraced ex-psychologist, what say you stop analyzing me, okay?
how did you get from London to New York?
okay, well, maybe your father will tell me at dinner tonight.
just got the phone with the owner of Key Star Charters, Charles Cooper.
they got the footage from their security camera.
he said there's something on it we should see.
so, this is about 45 minutes before the plane took off.
that's Mr. Gerrard.
I don't know who this other guy is, but obviously, he and Mr. Gerrard had words.
it's the model glue, isn't it?
it's murder on my senses.
not to mention I'm under strict orders not to get high.
this office is like one big huffing bag.
ten minutes later, he leaves alone.
so now we know Mr. Gerrard arrived here alive and intact.
gotta figure he was killed here, too.
you got this from any other angles?
eh, sorry.
only other camera got broke a few weeks ago.
hasn't been fixed yet.
Mr. Cooper, I'm gonna need you and Mister... - Barts....Barts to clear out of here for a while.
meantime, we'll get this video to our experts, see if we can't identify our mystery man.
any luck cleaning up that picture?
about as much luck as I had examining the hangar.
no sign of any crime being perpetrated there.
no clarity with regards to our fat friend's facial features here.
on the bright side, I think I might know where he works.
arm To? Carmanto Foods
isn't that the company that Gerrard and his colleagues were suing, right?
almost anyone who works there would've had motive.
unfortunately, rotund white male executives at the company number in the dozens.
our suspect does have one distinguishing feature, however:
the '90s-era "pager" attached to his belt.
I'm gonna go get started getting ready to meet your dad.
last chance to join us for dinner?
last chance to accept there is no dinner.
dad... never... shows!
say it with me, Watson.
maybe it'll sink in.
Sherlock... - He's Lucy with the football.
you're Charlie Brown.
people don't make plans just to break them.
people don't. My father does.
for the record, that's not a pager.
it's an insulin pump.
your mystery man is a diabetic.
detective Bell, NYPD.
this is my colleague Mr. Holmes.
we'd like to ask you some questions about your relationship with Hank Gerrard.
I'm sorry... I don't know who that is.
odd.
his firm is suing your company for $100 million.
something about a sugar substitute that causes cancer.
we have surveillance video of you talking to Mr. Gerrard in the Key Star Charters parking lot shortly before someone caved his skull in, stuck him in the hold of a small plane.
it's how we found you, actually.
saw the Carmanto logo on your shirt, insulin pump on your belt, made a few calls.
it's a bit ironic, isn't it?
diabetic working for a company that makes bad sugar?
I don't understand.
I heard on the news Hank was killed in a crash.
this would be the same Hank you don't know?
I did know him, sort of.
I was helping him.
by showing his scalp what the inside of his skull looked like?
it happened with his case.
I'd been giving him information to use against Carmanto.
you're a whistleblower?
Hank was angry with me because I refused to testify.
Carmanto had offered a settlement.
I thought it was more than fair.
Hank's boss was inclined to accept it, and Hank wanted more.
he... He asked me yesterday to reconsider taking the stand.
I told him I couldn't.
we argued.
I left.
I never laid a hand on him.
the company knew that that sugar substitute was deadly.
and Carmanto buried that evidence, convinced everybody it was fine.
it looked like sugar, it felt like sugar... but it wasn't.
thank you for your time, Mr. Hairston; we'll be in touch.
thought you said that guy was our strongest suspect.
now that I've met him, I know that he's our weakest suspect, literally.
did you see how hard it was for him to open that pill bottle?
so?
type-2 diabetes can significantly affect grip strength, particularly in men.
his is so bad he's bought adaptive office supplies: oversized ergonomic pens, a book holder.
there's no way could he have grasped and swung the heavy wrench used to kill Hank Gerrard.
so, in other words, we got nothing.
Nope. We've got sand.
thank you.
Mr. Holmes?
ms. Watson, I presume.
you're early. - Not as early as you.
it's nice to finally meet you.
uh, Zadie Smith is one of my favorite authors.
let me guess: my son is parking the car.
um... No, it's okay, Ms. Watson.
no need for excuses.
the truth is I'd have been much more surprised if he had come.
I've laid as many bricks in the wall between us as he has.
so, how's the old boy doing?
good, actually.
I think he's got a handle on his post-rehab life.
I mean, he doesn't keep the healthiest hours, but you know, work keeps him busy, focused.
getting him to go to support group meetings can be tricky, though.
stubborn, criminally so.
always was.
I remember when he was a boy, he'd climb the fence around our property and walk from post to post.
I warned him it was dangerous, but he wouldn't listen.
then he falls and lands on his wrist.
ugly business, bone jutting through skin.
but despite the pain, he set the bone and wrapped the wound himself.
took to wearing long-sleeve shirts for the next few days.
all to keep his father from telling him that he was right.
you're kidding me.
ended up with a scar right here.
covered it with one of his barmy tattoos, if memory serves.
I am really glad we're doing this.
I've had many different clients, but Sherlock is definitely... unique.
there's so just so much more I want know about him.
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
would you mind terribly if I asked one of you first?
how's the sex?
I beg your pardon?
the sex. The shagging.
is he enjoying it?
I don't understand.
I was told that was part of the "service" you provided.
satisfying your client's every need.
why else would anyone pay your exorbitant fees?
you're not Mr. Holmes, are you?
I don't believe this.
I'm sorry, it's just... if you'd seen your face...
who are you? - Actor.
well, a struggling one at that.
your Mr. Sherlock hired me from my manager.
said it wouldn't be a problem if I took his father's place tonight because...
...Dad never shows.
dad never shows.
I was discussing an artificial sweetener with a suspect earlier on.
Yeah, looks and feels like regular sugar, but it's not.
there are minute differences, carcinogenic ones in that case, but it got me thinking about some unusual sand I noticed at the crash site.
it was new, hadn't been weathered by the elements yet.
first I thought, "Well, the city must have trucked it in to offset erosion on the beach,
but according to the Parks Department, they haven't done that at Far Rockaway in over a year, so how did the sand make it there?"
in the fuel tank.
sand dumped into the fuel tank would initially settle on the bottom.
plane would take off, no difficulty.
but... during the course of the flight, more and more granules will get sucked into the filter, clogging it and starving the engine of fuel mid-flight, regardless of the extra weight of Hank Gerrard's body.
you think the flight was bound to crash.
actually, Ms. Molinari, as of this moment, I know it was bound to crash.
same unfrosted grains I saw at the crash site, looks and feels like beach sand, but it's not.
these grains are comprised mostly of silica, commercial sand.
somebody sabotaged the flight.
probably the same person who killed Hank Gerrard.
what if Hank walked in on the saboteur?
easier to bash his skull in then explain why you're funneling sand into a fuel tank, no?
then it's just a case of concealing the body.
the cargo hold makes sense in that the flight was doomed to crash anyway.
as long as it crashed over water.
which it would do on its way to Martha's Vineyard.
traces of sand would be washed away.
instead, it crashed prematurely due to the weight imbalance.
so, we know why Hank Gerrard's body was stuffed into the cargo hold.
the questions are: who put it there, and why did they want to bring down that plane?
you're home early.
did you enjoy your time with dear old Dad?
Oh, come on, Watson, show a little appreciation for a prank well played.
to pull that off, I had to be absolutely certain my father wouldn't show.
I did mention that he wouldn't show, didn't I?
just out of curiosity, why did the old tosspot drop out this time?
surely he's e-mailed you some sort of apology by now.
he was called away. - On important business, yeah.
an old one, but a good one.
anyway, It's good that you're back.
I realized earlier this evening that the flight that crashed was sabotaged.
the good news is I've been going over Key Star Charter's flight logs, and I believe I've found a mathematical quirk that has pointed me in the direction of a suspect.
I would like to go and confront him.
so... I waited for you.
you should be grateful.
if you want to go pound on some criminal's door, I suggest you call the police.
I'm going to bed.
you should've trusted me when I told you he wouldn't show.
trusted you?
I've been glued to your side for weeks now, and you have refused to share even the tiniest bit of your personal history.
you know what, Sherlock, I don't trust you.
because thanks to you, we're still basically just strangers.
Ah, Mr. Holmes, right?
Mr. Barts, good to see you again.
you didn't mention when we met that you're one of Key Star's pilots.
well, yeah, I am.
is that a problem?
well, not for me, no.
but for your recently deceased colleague, Joe Newell, maybe.
I don't understand.
Joe Newell's widow told me that you and he had a rather...
ugly disagreement on the telephone last week.
he wouldn't tell her what it was about.
he just said that the problem was being taken care of.
that was nothing.
Yeah, I poached one of his regulars.
this rich guy who flies to D. C. every week.
good tipper.
Joe was angry, but we worked it out.
we were thinking the argument may have been over something else.
you see, when I realized that Joe's plane had been sabotaged, it occurred to me that the saboteur may have been satisfying a grudge, not against one of the flight's passengers, but against the airline itself.
now I dug into some of the logs that the NTSB gathered from Key Star, and I noticed something strange.
every time you, Owen Barts, piloted a plane back from Miami, you recorded an onboard weight of exactly 66 pounds over the weight of the passengers and their baggage.
it's just a mistake with my math.
the same mathematical mistake, made again and again, only when you return from Miami, Florida.
no. You were accounting for extra cargo.
you had to, because accurate weight calculations are critical when determining the amount of fuel required for a flight.
but why 66 pounds exactly?
a strange number.
until you factor in metric conversion.
66 pounds is the equivalent of exactly 30 kilos.
nice even number for cocaine smuggling, no?
what happened? Did Joe find out and want a cut?
that's not likely, given his reputation, his military background.
it's more likely that he threatened to go to the authorities if you didn't stop.
either way, you engineered a plane crash to eliminate the threat.
problem was, Hank Gerrard caught you in the act.
you improvised.
you killed him.
concealed his body in the cargo hold of a plane that you knew was gonna crash.
it's quite a... quite a story.
there's just one problem.
I was nowhere near the hangar this morning.
I was with my boss, Charles.
his car stalled, so I had to stop by his place to give him a jump.
don't believe me, go ask him.
he'll tell you.
I couldn't have killed Mr. Gerrard or sabotaged that plane.
holy...
you were right.
yesterday, when you suggested I had a certain preoccupation with plane crashes.
it is why I was drawn to this case.
I'm not phobic, mind you.
nothing so illogical.
I just... the amount I see when I board an aircraft...
the pilot looks confident, but I detect a slight tremor in his hands.
he's nervous. Is he hiding something? If yes, what?
has he had a few drinks to settle his nerves?
what about the mechanic performing a last-second check?
why does he look so unhappy?
does he hate his job?
if he hates his job, how much care is he taking?
I get it.
you're still cross with me?
I was attempting to demonstrate my trust in you.
how?
by telling me something I already figured out?
you want more?
detective Bell?
I just heard back from Charles Cooper.
he's on his way to the station.
thought you might want to join us.
Owen called me last night, uh, in a panic.
he said he needed my help.
it's glue again.
it's worse this time.
it's like he bathed in the stuff.
he told me he'd made a big mistake.
that he'd used the Key Star planes to smuggle drugs.
Mr. Cooper, are you okay?
you look a little pale.
no, I guess I'm just I shock.
I mean... O-Owen had worked for me for years.
he was a friend, just like Joe was.
but he said that, uh, Joe had figured it out and threatened to call the police if he didn't stop.
but Owen didn't want to stop, and so... he, uh...
Mr. Cooper, did Owen tell you he had something to do with the plane crash?
he wanted me to tell you guys that he was with me at the time of Mr. Gerrard's murder.
but he wasn't.
could you excuse us for a second?
get a team over to Owen Barts' residence right now.
I'm gonna call for a warrant.
ink will be dry before your foot goes through his door.
Yes, sir.
no Barts?
lot of drawers tossed inside.
looks like he packed a bag in a hurry.
now, his car is gone too-- blue Toyota Camry.
we got a BOLO out.
what's weird is what is here.
going by the dimensions, I'd say it's a safe bet this is the weapon used to kill him.
so let me get this straight:
Owen Barts kills Hank Gerrard with this wrench, but he doesn't dispose of it in some place we aren't gonna find it.
he doesn't even clean it.
he just leaves it in his garage?
like I said, weird.
not just weird.
utterly ridiculous.
what's that?
spartina patens.
it's a type of cord grass which grows only in brackish water.
Brackish?
it's a combination of fresh and salt water.
it's still a bit moist, which means the wrench was in the water recently.
I think someone did dispose of it and retrieved it...
...and planted it here.
probably right after they killed Owen Barts.
I get why you think the wrench was planted, but what makes you think Barts is dead?
his car.
you said it as a Camry?
solid, practical choice.
but look at this-- full-synthetic motor oil.
it's high-end.
used to maintain peak lubricity in high-performance engines.
not the four-cylinder engine of a Camry.
imagine you're Owen Barts.
you've just been told by your boss, Charles Cooper, that he won't alibi you for the murder of Hank Gerrard.
you decide to go on the lam.
you rush home... you pack up your things, and then you decide to leave what seems to be between 50 and 100, 000 of your hard-earned smuggling dollars in your garage.
not a chance.
so who else may have been profiting from the smuggling operation at Key Star Charters, hmm?
who else who would've seen Joe Newell as a threat and had the technical know-how to sabotage his plane?
the same guy who told us Owen Barts confessed to everything.
are you sure he did everything you said he did?
note the pallor, the perspiration, the inability to hold eye contact.
all telltale signs of deceit.
and some serious medical conditions.
I'm just saying, the guy looks like he's dying.
he's our murderer and our saboteur.
now it's just a matter of getting him to admit it.
something wrong?
no, I just never noticed that scar before, that's all.
how'd you get it?
boyhood misadventure.
fell off a fence.
a compound fracture, hence the scar.
I just remembered an errand I forgot to run.
you gonna be okay on your own for a while?
somehow I'll soldier on.
problem?
he won't cop to it.
but he's on the precipice, you can tell.
he's sweating, his hands are trembling.
we've come at him with everything we got; he won't budge.
because he knows we got no proof.
his frame-up of Owen Barts may not have been perfect, but he knows we can't show he had anything to do with it.
what?
it's got, it's got into you now.
model glue.
that's probably why he looks so ill.
fumes are finally getting to him.
that's Cooper's glass, correct?
his third one, if you can believe it.
cut him off.
no, no, no.
I think you should bring him a pitcher.
I was wondering if you could help me...
miss Watson.
what a surprise.
but if you're here for an encore performance...
I know you're not just some actor Sherlock hired.
you know him.
he engaged me through my representation.
I've never even seen the man...
that story you told me, the one about his broken wrist; it was true.
he would've never shared that with you if you were just some actor.
especially not to play some stupid prank.
how did you find me, if you don't mind me asking?
the receipt you dropped.
it had the name of this bookstore on it.
you got a 20% discount; members get ten.
I realized you must work here.
you've been spending quite a bit of time with him, haven't you?
I really am an actor, you know.
in London, I had a small part in a radio drama.
Yeah, we still have those across the pond.
Sherlock wrote me a letter when he was ten, saying that I alone of all the cast truly captured the Yorkshire accent.
Yeah, I thought it was odd.
but I was also very flattered.
so eventually, we met, so I could coach him on its nuances.
we became friends.
Sherlock doesn't have friends.
not in the traditional sense.
he drops in and out, appears at odd moments to make outrageous and highly specific requests.
respectfully, that doesn't sound much like a friendship to me.
then perhaps you better revise your definition.
you can't expect Sherlock Holmes to relate to you the way others might.
the moment you do, he'll migrate out of your life, and you'll be the poorer for it.
you do realize that, don't you?
he told you about me, right?
Yeah. - You know what my job is?
I do. And for what it's worth, um... I'm very glad he has you.
you knew him when he was using?
well, after I first came here in '06, we mostly kept in touch by e-mail.
I knew he was dabbling on and off, but I was confident that he would grow out of it.
nine months ago, he shows up at my flat at night, so high he could barely speak.
well, I flushed his drugs and I looked after him for a day or so.
it was very... difficult for me to see his mind so addled.
he could barely stay conscious.
and when he kept muttering the same name again and again...
what name?
it doesn't matter.
I asked him about it the next morning.
he assured me it meant nothing.
did you believe him?
look... I want to help him, but I think you know how difficult that can be.
I thought, if I could talk to you, that maybe you could help me get a better sense of...
of what to do.
anyway... thank you... for your time.
I'm sorry if I bothered you.
miss Watson?
I have a strong suspicion that that name meant more to him than he claimed.
I think perhaps you should have it.
Mr. Cooper.
nice to see you again.
do you need to urinate?
what?
do you need to urinate?
no, I'm good, thanks.
last night, when you struggled with your co-conspirator, Owen, he nicked you with something.
a kitchen knife, perhaps?
excuse me?
obviously, you...you got the better of him, but given your pallor,
I'd say that the wound was significant.
I believed you earlier on when you said that you were in shock.
but now I think it's something else: blood loss.
pint or two, if I had to guess.
that's why you're so thirsty.
your body needs to replace the fluids that it's lost.
if it didn't, then you'd have asked to visit the loo quite some time ago.
I'm sorry, but you think I'm a killer because I didn't go to the bathroom, hm?
that and the model glue.
you stink of it.
initially, I'd assumed that you just spilled some on your clothing, - but now that I know about the wound... - What wound?
the one beneath your clothing.
the one that you sealed with the adhesive you use to build your model planes.
it's an old military trick.
field medics use it to seal up a wound when there isn't time for stitches.
you used it to avoid a trip to the hospital 'cause you didn't want the injury on record.
you know, I think I've given you guys enough of my time today.
okay, you want to leave? That's not a problem.
just take off your shirt and your pants, show us I'm wrong.
I cut my side open on a sharp piece of metal in my hangar last night.
I was going to get stitches, Owen called.
I was upset.
and I'd used glue on a cut before, so...
let's say he's right, Mr. Cooper.
how much blood do you think ended up on Owen's body?
do you know how easy it's gonna be for us to tie you to his murder, once we find it?
I didn't murder anyone.
and there is no body.
course there is.
I even think I know where to find it.
Jamaica Bay or Alley Pond Park.
it was the wrench.
you threw it in a body of brackish water after you murdered Hank Gerrard.
the only ones in New York are the ones I just mentioned.
last night, when Owen called you and told you we were onto the smuggling and the sabotage, you went and retrieved it.
you killed him, and then you planted it in his garage so we'd pin everything on him and him alone.
was a lazy bit of framing, if you ask me, but you are wounded.
so... here's the thing, Mr. Cooper.
I know that you killed Owen Barts, just like I know that you killed your "friend" Joe Newell and his passengers.
I also know that you like to hide things in brackish water.
now, a dead body is considerably larger than a wrench, but you were in no condition to dig a grave last night.
Jamaica Bay and Alley Pond Park are very large areas, but the NYPD is planning on searching them both.
you could save them a great deal of time and trouble, and tell them where Owen is, or you could continue to lie.
thing is, if you lie, you'll just give the D. A. more time to consider making this a federal case.
uncle Sam doesn't take too kindly to people who bring down planes.
the death penalty is a real possibility.
my advice?
tell us everything you know.
the great State of New York will only give you life in prison.
I take it you made your case against Charles Cooper?
Ah, the police made the case.
I just lent a helping hand.
an enormous helping hand, but still.
what is it? You look peculiar.
I guess there's a question I want to ask you.
about your past.
excellent.
you wait here, I'll go to my room, shut the door.
as soon as you're absolutely certain I can't hear you, ask away.
I know about Irene.
I want you to tell me about her.
yes?
I'm supposed to deliver some tables and chairs to a party
it starts in about an hour-- and my, uh, van broke down just down the street.
you want me to call triple-A?
actually, no. I need to call my boss, but my cell is dead.
I was hoping I could come in, maybe charge it for a few minutes?
please? Look, if I mess up this delivery, I'm in some serious trouble.
how about you give me your boss's number? I'll call him for you.
I just started today, actually. I-I don't know my boss's number off the top of my head.
I need to plug in my phone so I can get it.
tell me the name of the company, I'll call the office.
it's after hours. Nobody's gonna answer. Would you please just open the door?
I'm sorry, but I don't know you. I can't just let you in.
lady, come on! I'm gonna lose my job.
please, just leave before I call the cops.
Yeah, Broome Street and Ludlow. You'll send another van?
great, thanks.
talk about a Good Samaritan. Saved my ass.
and as he fled, the man dropped his walking stick, which the police later mistook for a weapon.
but he did so in order to pick up the mongoose.
which was, of course, responsible for the claw marks I found at the crime scene.
the mongoose, you see, was quite key in identifying the man.
he was a magician. The rodent, part of his act.
now, once I realized the man's true connection to the colonel, it became obvious to me, the latter hadn't been murdered after all.
again, my name is Sherlock, and I am an addict.
that was a morning of firsts.
first share I've ever heard involving a mongoose.
Really?
it was also the first time you ever contributed at a meeting.
why am I not surprised it had nothing to do with your drug history?
Ah, you know, it seems so expected, doesn't it?
talking about addiction at an addiction support group meeting.
besides, the group seemed particularly down today.
the last thing they needed to hear was another depressing share.
is that why you decided to take the floor? To cheer everyone up?
you know me, Watson. People person.
hello.
uh... Sherlock? Can you come up here, please?
right now?
I, uh... I let myself in. I still had the key from last time.
I tried calling, but your number's changed.
Oh, so you know each other. That's almost a relief.
something's wrong.
Yeah. It's Emily.
she's, uh... she's been kidnapped.
when was she taken?
well, a ransom demand two days ago from her e-mail?
video or note?/ - A video.
what are they asking for?
clearly this is very important, but do you think that we could press pause until we are all clothed?
love a cup of tea, if you've got some.
um, sorry. This is my room.
so, obviously, he's an old friend. Who's Emily?
his daughter. She lives in New York.
and for clarity's sake, Rhys isn't an old friend.
well, not exactly. He's, uh, my former drug dealer.
as you may have guessed, last time Rhys was here, he stayed in your room.
this was when you were still using.
two months after I got to New York, before I was carted off to rehab.
let's talk about this.
what's to talk about? The daughter of an old friend is in trouble.
he's not just an old friend.
he's the man who used to supply me with narcotics; Yes, I am well aware.
doesn't make his daughter any less kidnapped.
and it's worth noting, he is an ex-dealer, just as I am an ex-junkie.
two phoenixes risen from the ashes.
this isn't about what he is now.
it's about what he was to you back then.
you think he may be some sort of trigger?
on a giant gun filled with drugs pointed at you, yes.
you're right. He is a trigger.
the minute I laid eyes on him, my mind conjured images of heroin bubbling in a spoon.
I felt an undeniable, almost gravitational pull.
yet, as I've already mentioned, I consider the man a friend.
I will not be turning him away.
I appreciate your opinion and your concern.
but you mistake the support group ethos for a complete system for living.
it is not. At least not to a man like me.
my sobriety is on one plane.
the bonds I share with those I consider friends is on quite another.
you're just gonna have to work a bit harder this week.
not interrupting, am I?
sorry again about upstairs.
I was... Haven't quite had my head screwed on the last couple of days, you know?
should've figured you'd have a bird over.
I'm not a bird. I live here.
I'm entirely sober now, Rhys.
miss Watson is my companion. She keeps me from resuming bad habits.
of which I am one.
I get it. In which case, let me show you this video.
if you can't help me, I'll be on my way.
I'll just get my tea.
your daughter's life boils down to two numbers: $2. 2 million, four days.
if you don't pay in time, she dies.
if you involve the police or the FBI, she dies.
if you deviate from my instructions in any way, she dies.
I've left a phone for you at her apartment; keep it with you.
wait for further instructions.
I went to her place as soon as I touched down.
this is the cell phone. Looked like there'd been a bit of a struggle.
I was careful not to touch it.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you have $2. 2 million?
in May of 2011, Rhys stole exactly that amount from his Dominican suppliers.
he's been hiding out in Thailand ever since. Like I said, ex-dealer.
they got sloppy with some transactions.
I saw an opportunity for early retirement, and took it.
it never occurred to you that you might be putting your daughter in danger?
well, no one knew about Emily. But he knew 'cause he deduced it.
but I never spoke about her to anyone else, never.
her mom knew, obviously, but... She passed away several years ago.
did Emily know about your theft from the Dominicans?
no. Before I disappeared, I gave her an e-mail address, and said, "Look, if you're ever in trouble, you can get in touch,
but I hadn't heard from her till I got this video.
well, isn't there a simple solution? You pay the ransom, and you get your daughter back.
how much is left?
uh... just under two.
$2 million is nothing to sneeze at.
$2, 000, you know, give or take.
you spent $2 million in just 18 months?
no, I lost $2 million. Drugs were his vice.
cards were mine. Look, I'm sorry.
I'm even sorrier now that I know that you're trying to clean up.
I just... I don't mean to go stirring up bad memories.
I just didn't know who else to turn to.
said he'd kill Emily if I went to the cops or the feds.
and I figured, since I was acquainted with the Sherlock Holmes,
I'd be a fool not to...seek his advice, right
we have just under 44 hours until the ransom is due.
luxury. That's twice what I'll need.
that's Emily's mom... Penny.
you said she passed away.
Yeah, some kind of cancer, I think.
well, we were never that close.
she was American on holiday in London back in '91.
we met, had some fun... then along came Emily.
how are you not a total wreck right now?
if my kid was taken and held for ransom, I don't know if I could keep it together.
you seem quite... I don't know-- Zen.
I made a delivery once to Holmes at Scotland Yard. Crazy, right?
crazier still, he invites me to stay and watch him
the police knew there was another one out there, but they didn't know where it was.
Holmes is in the room with the guy for, like, five minutes.
figures out where the bomb is from a couple of stains on the guy's shoe.
you ask why I'm not a total wreck?
cause I believe in Sherlock Holmes.
your friends, the Dominicans-- they were here. Or at least one of them was, anyway.
he waited for her here.
I found traces of cigarette ash on the floor.
now, how do I know it didn't come from Emily?
easy. She's not a smoker.
no other signs of tobacco in the whole apartment. She doesn't even have a lighter.
this ash comes from a Crema, a popular Dominican brand.
you can tell the brand by the ash?
I can identify 140 cigarette and cigar brands by their ash alone.
now, if you bothered to read my monographs, you would know that.
so, they struggled here. She dropped her glass of water that she poured.
the water spilled on his hand. How else do you explain this?
it's just a swirl.
it is a symbol, that of the Taino god of hurricanes.
this, meanwhile, is a hand stamp of a Dominican nightclub in Brooklyn called, appropriately enough, Hurrikane, with a "K.
Emily's water moistened the hand stamp on her abductor's hand, facilitating its transfer to the wall.
maybe he left some prints.
already checked-- he wiped down the doorknobs before he left.
how do you know the stamp didn't come from Emily's hand?
well, she'd just got back from a jog, hence the water.
no nightclub would allow her in wearing exercise gear, let alone one as pretentious as Hurrikane with a "K.
her kidnapper came from a nightclub, and that is where we shall go.
I believe in Sherlock Holmes.
this is seriously the plan?
Rhys walks around on the off chance he recognizes someone before they recognize him?
well, he's wearing a hat.
are there other, more surgical ways to search this nightclub? Yes, of course, but they would require the manpower and resources of an NYPD or an FBI, and both are off-limits to us.
but if he spots someone from his days dealing with the cartel, we'll follow them.
you seem even more dour than usual, Watson.
I would posit it was a menstruation issue, but I worked out your cycle-- you're good for ten more days.
couching it as a scientific observation totally negates the misogyny.
and for the record, I'm not happy because we are in a nightclub surrounded by alcohol, and-and, judging by the way people are dancing, serious drugs.
told you it was gonna be a difficult few days.
okay, over in the corner, the VIP area, see the big guy in there with a beard? Right?
his name's Reynaldo. He's one of the U. K. suppliers.
is he the one you stole from?
technically, I stole from them all, but, yeah, he'd be pretty upset with me.
so, obviously, more than a coincidence
a man you stole from sitting in a nightclub that Emily's abductor was in just before she was taken.
so what do we do now?
now... I urinate.
nice tats.
my name is Sherlock Holmes-- I'm a consultant with the NYPD.
I'm looking for a kidnapping victim. Her name is Emily Grant.
I believe that your friend Reynaldo may be responsible.
would you mind if I ask you a few questions?
no hablo ingls.
that's strange. I'm fairly certain that English is a requirement for agents of the DEA
even those deep undercover in Dominican drug cartels. Hmm?
what gave you away, you ask? Well, first it was your tradecraft.
out there, you used the nearest champagne bucket to monitor your surroundings behind you without turning your head
that's not a technique one learns on the street, but at Quantico.
then there are your tattoos-- they're all perfectly thuggish, all precisely the same age.
most tattoos are acquired over time. Hmm?
each emblem fades and ages differently-- not yours.
yours would seem to suggest you were in a hurry to fit in with a new crowd.
please, I have no interest in jeopardizing your operation, but a woman's life is at stake, and given that you are a federal agent...
call me a fed again, I'll cut out your tongue and feed it to you.
well, perhaps your friends in the VIP area will be more interested in what I have to say.
my boys love hearing about the DEA. Like waving red at a bull.
it's okay. Guy tried to steal my wallet, man!
stay, please. Just stay, stay, stay.
stay out of it.
you didn't give me any choice-- I'm in too deep, and I cannot let you blow my cover.
I just need to know where to find the girl.
nobody in this organization has kidnapped anyone in New York, trust me.
Reynaldo over there, he is the cartel in New York-- nothing happens without his say-so.
the only thing he cares about right now is the turf war with the Colombians.
I'm sorry, but you may be looking into the one crime in this city the cartel isn't behind.
suffocatingly inane.
good morning.
this is soul-crushing in its utter banality.
sufficiently asinine as to constitute a valid argument for eugenics.
okay, I give up. What are you reading?
Emily's Twitter feed. Excruciating medium.
demonstrates that brevity does not protect against dullness.
that said, it does serve as a modern-day equivalent of a diary, so who's to say it won't turn up a suspect?
so you've given up on the cartel.
for now, yes. Though the ash and ink stain I found does suggest to me that Emily's abductor was in that nightclub before he took her.
well, we have an appointment at noon. So plan your hunt around that.
no. We visited the house of bromides yesterday.
I am no longer required to supplicate at the altar of recovery every day.
you are when your ex-drug dealer is living with us.
so you wanted me to work harder; this is working harder.
fine. I suppose they might find the case of the blue carbuncle entertaining.
no, you're not gonna talk about some old case.
you're gonna share something real about your...
mm, he really got you, huh?
the man had a cover to protect; I hold nothing against him.
I'm gonna put some antiseptic on that.
Hey, I need to get in there.
uh, yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Two shakes.
it's all yours.
you're kidding me, right?
I'm a sober companion. You're in the home of a recovering addict.
I opened the window./ - You don't do drugs here.
that's not drugs; It's just a little bit of wacky backy.
I mean, my daughter's been kidnapped, and I am under a bit of strain right now.
I'm gonna do you the favor of believing you're just an idiot.
okay. Thank you.
Hey, I'm not finished yet.
as much as I want you to get your daughter back, I need you to understand
Sherlock is my number one priority.
so you will not do drugs in his house, you will not talk to him about this, and you will not talk about drugs in his presence.
if I feel that you've compromised his sobriety in any way,
I will turn you in to the police as a drug dealer and a thief.
are we clear?
now give me the drugs.
Watson! - Rhys! Come along if you're coming along!
is that it?
we'll have to go to an evening meeting, Watson.
my time wading in the cesspool of social media was not a complete waste.
what did you find?
Emily made a curious Twitter entry under the hashtag: "that awkward moment.
apparently, it is a category for documenting uncomfortable social experiences.
Emily's read: "When the man who used to give you your allowance comes to you for a loan.
well, I never gave her an allowance.
she was talking about her stepfather.
now, I cracked her banking password-- your full name, by the way
and I accessed her records.
seems she wrote a series of checks to a man called Derrick Hughes.
that is her stepdad, but he's big in real estate-- man, he's loaded.
if he's rich, then why would he have to borrow money from his stepdaughter?
what... Well, according to my friend in the D. A. squad,
derrick Hughes had all kinds of money-- emphasis on "had.
now, after the crash in '08, banks foreclosed on most of his properties.
now, guy doesn't have a criminal record, but... he is dead broke.
thank you, Detective. Please let me know when I can return the favor.
how about you just tell me why you're interested in the guy.
course not.
so, Derrick Hughes has motive to kidnap Emily. He's desperate for money.
reduced to working as a parking attendant.
if she confided in him about your thievery, maybe he saw it as a solution to his problems.
never liked the guy.
I never met him, but still.
so what are we supposed to do? We supposed to just wait here until he gets off work?
well, if he has her, he will go to her.
well, I'm gonna order some food, and maybe they'll turn on the heat.
you're doing good, man. It's nice to see you. I'm proud of you.
must be like... trying to relearn the piano after a stroke, huh?
what must be like trying to relearn the piano?
well, doing what you do without the... the drugs.
ridiculous. Detective work is a deductive science.
drugs are a hindrance to that, not a help.
Yeah, but there's, like, two parts to what you do, isn't there?
I mean, there's the "knowing stuff" part-- and you've got that covered
and then there's the making connections.
that's, like, the-the... the creative part. The art, right?
I suppose so.
some artists, they need the drugs to fuel the creative stuff.
are you suggesting that I was a better detective when I was high?
no, no, not exactly. It's just, well, there'd be no shame in it, would there?
I mean, the Stones never made a decent album after they cleaned up, and look at them.
just, it must be hard, that's all.
is everything okay?/ -Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
because Derrick Hughes is getting off work and you guys are just sitting here.
public records indicate that this is one of several buildings that he bought in the area.
apparently, he made a rather large bet that the area would gentrify.
bad investment.
well, not entirely.
he came out of it with a perfectly good place to hide a kidnapped girl.
you think he's got Emily in there?
I'd like to know why he brought groceries to an abandoned building.
Where'd he go?
what is this place?
I can explain. It's just for a few days.
what's just for a few days?
where is she?/ - Where's who?
Emily.- Where are you hiding her?/- My daughter?
you people aren't with the Housing Authority?
she's not your daughter!
Mr. Hughes, my name is Sherlock Holmes. I'm a consultant with the NYPD.
this is Joan Watson; she's my associate.
this... Yeah, I've seen his face in pictures. You're Rhys.
that's right, and I'm here to take Emily home.
uh, Rhys... the groceries were not for her. Mr. Hughes is squatting here.
technically, I still own the place.
what happened to Emily?
she was kidnapped, Mr. Hughes.
Oh, my God.
Emily... What, you thought I did it?
look around all you want. Ask me any questions you want.
I raised her. I would never hurt her.
you took money from her.
Yeah, I'm in a pinch. She helped me out.
you haven't been to a nightclub called Hurrikane by any chance this week, have you?
uh, no. I've never even heard of it.
I say he's lying.
do I look like a guy that's been going to nightclubs much?
sorry to have troubled you, Mr. Hughes. We'll be in touch.
you could have let me rough him up a bit.
the man's body language spoke volumes. He fairly reeked of innocence.
hello.
did you think I wouldn't be watching?
wait, what?
I told you not to involve the police. Who are you working with?
n-no, he, uh, he isn't the police, he...
I assure you, I am not the police. I'm a friend, an independent mediator.
you just cost yourself 12 hours.
I want the money by 6: 00 p. m. tomorrow, or she's dead.
and to ensure we all understand each other, I've left you something.
it's outside your kitchen door.
Oh, my God.
you sure it's Emily's?
I, uh, I compared the fingerprint with ones I lifted from Emily's cell phone.
the finger is hers.
well, was hers, anyway.
you have surveillance cameras inside the house. Do you have any outside?
only one.
it covers the garden level door, and the kidnapper never came squarely into view.
good news is, Emily's severed digit may provide a clue as to her location.
please.
looks like a burn.
it is a burn.
quite a distinctive burn, as a matter of fact.
it matches a floral design found on a cast-iron radiator forged at the turn of the century.
suggests she is in a pre-war building.
she's likely been chained to the radiator, hence the burn.
now, look under the fingernail.
ethiopian wat.
spiced onion-based stew.
you can tell that just by looking at it?
no, I can tell it by tasting it.
it's unlikely her abductor is preparing elaborate ethnic meals for her himself, so let's assume the wat is of the takeout variety.
now, if the restaurant is in the vicinity of the kidnapper's lair,
I can use historical building permits to identify pre-war structures.
I then cross-reference those addresses with those of every Ethiopian place in the city.
provided the selection's narrow enough,
I should be able to determine which building is housing Emily.
what about you?
how are you doing?
if you're asking if I'm on the verge of a relapse, the answer is a definitive "no.
well, you just seem a little, uh, intense.
well, we are on deadline, hmm?
would you mind going downstairs and checking on Rhys?
he went down there 37 minutes ago.
I've heard nary a floorboard creak since.
a long time for someone of his disposition to go motionless.
Habesha.
brought you some tea.
how are you doing?
well, I'd like to say fine and dandy, but...
just saw a piece of my little girl in a box.
how about you?
um, Sherlock's just examining the... the package that we received.
he thinks it might be able to help him locate Emily.
he thinks it might be able to help him.
that doesn't sound like the Sherlock I used to know.
he just needs a little more time, that's all.
I need some air.
Rhys, for what it's worth...
...I believe in Sherlock Holmes, too
if you involve the police or the FBI, she dies.
if you deviate from my instructions in any way, she dies.
I've left a phone for you at her apartment; keep it with you.
wait for further instructions.
your daughter's life boils down to two numbers: $2. 2 million, four days.
how we doing?
I thought I was on to something with the finger
the connection between pre-war buildings and Ethiopian restaurants
but it turns out there are too many of both of those to be helpful, so I'm revisiting the ransom video.
see if there's a detail, a clue to her whereabouts that I might have missed the first time.
light, shadow, noises in the background, reflection in the cornea
any tiny detail could be the key.
do you remember the... Tinsdale case?
that security nut.
had more alarms in his house than he had doors.
used to lock himself in his bedroom every night.
died in his sleep.
suffocated.
you were sure it was murder, but there was no evidence anyone else had been inside. Huh?
I remember, uh...
I remember I brought you a little cocaine, watched you shoot up.
like, within a minute, you had the whole thing sussed.
it was the maid; She'd left some dry ice under his bed.
and then it evaporated, turned to carbon dioxide.
he died in his sleep, no one was any the wiser.
except you, of course.
remember?
it's time, huh?
for Emily.
why would you do that?
you've needed it the last two days!
I assure you, I have not!
the rubbish you've been spouting? Huh?
about lights and shadows and reflections and corneas.
that's not you, that's not Sherlock Holmes.
this is some ghost of you, some pale imitation.
you need your meds.
get yourself right.
please. Please, man, I'm begging you.
for Emily. For Emily's life.
what the hell is going on down here?!
I-I need some time, Watson. I will be in touch.
why is he so upset? What-what did you say to him?
the truth.
it's the God's honest truth.
this is Sherlock Holmes. I would like to speak with my father.
good news, Rhys.
you will be reunited with Emily within the hour.
what, you found her?
I telephoned the kidnapper. I told him we would pay the ransom.
but you know I don't have the money.
I have the money, or at least, my father does.
I reached out to him.
he agreed to loan me $2. 2 million, on condition that I perform various errands for him in the near future.
don't know what they are yet, but, uh, knowing him, it's a virtual lock I will be stealing candy from infants or clubbing young seals.
I can't believe you reached out to your father.
Oh, man, I don't know what to say, man
we're going to meet Emily's abductor at 238th and Irwin in, uh, just under an hour.
he will be in a blue van.
I transfer the money electronically, he will release her.
Watson, would you be so kind as to fetch my tablet for me?
I'll need it to perform the transfer.
sure.
thank you.
there's something that you need to understand.
given a little more time, I would have found Emily by my own devices;
of this I have no doubt.
but it occurred to me that a little more time with you is a dangerous thing.
the fact that the money I've procured will liberate Emily is almost incidental.
what it's really doing, Rhys, is buying a life without you.
after today, you are never to darken my doorway again.
our friendship has run its course.
have I made myself clear?
can I help you?
Yeah, Special Agent Xande Diaz.
I'm looking for Sherlock Holmes.
I've uncovered some information about the girl he's trying to find.
he needs to know about it right away.
hello. - It was an ambush.
a group of painters when I arrived on the scene.
but they're not painters
their shoes were as clean as they are expensive.
they're a hit squad
employees, no doubt, of the Dominican cartel that we crossed paths with the other night.
one of them used the word "aguajero.
it's Dominican slang for "braggart.
someone told them to lie in wait.
someone who had pull within the organization.
someone who also knew I was investigating Emily's abduction.
only one person meets those particular criteria...
the agent from the D. E.A.
the one who beat you up the other night.
I know.
your friends are alive, Mr. Holmes.
excellent.
how long depends on you.
give me a moment to secure transportation.
I'll meet you at my place.
we can talk face-to-face.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
speaking of friends, I just met some of yours.
I don't think they liked me very much.
I told them you work for a rival gang.
but now I realize that sending them after you was a mistake.
the money that you were offering, I thought that was coming from Rhys.
I thought you would be transferring it from his account, not yours.
now I know that wasn't the case.
so I must've, uh, scared you the other night.
everything I was able to deduce about you.
you thought you'd kill me, then swoop on the softer target,
Rhys. Get him to transfer the funds.
you're pretty fit, Watson. You know that?
but more importantly, you're a good friend.
could you just shut up?
I need you to do something for me.
tell Holmes I'm sorry.
just stay calm. You can tell him yourself.
uh, not after I've cut myself loose, I can't.
what are you doing?
back in the day, I dealt to a famous punker for a brief stretch in the '80s.
one of them gave me a little pocketknife as a keepsake.
since then, the only thing I've ever cut with it has been lines of...
I get it. I get it.
just... Y-You need to stop now.
no. I need to right a terrible wrong.
maybe a few terrible wrongs.
I'm gonna save you, and then Holmes is gonna save Emily, and then that'll be that.
all I ask is you get out that door, okay?
I imagine that you learned about the robbery he'd perpetrated after you infiltrated the cartel.
you know, they were never able to find him or the money.
but then again, they didn't have the resources of a powerful government agency behind them, did they?
I imagine you found his name from Emily's Social Security information?
am I close?
listen to me.
I want you to transfer the money now.
as soon as I see it in my account, I will let your friends go.
you just tried to have me killed, so... give me a reason I should trust you.
Watson!
Watson!
Sherlock, Rhys has been shot.
guy who did it is unconscious.
call 911!
I had nothing to do with this woman's abduction.
until just now, I didn't even know what she looked like.
that's funny.
because according to a statement we got from Joan Watson, you approached her and the girl's father this morning with information about her whereabouts.
totally untrue.
what is true?
that I've been working in the New York faction of a Dominican drug cartel for almost a year now.
that, during my time with them, I became aware of a man by the name of Rhys Kinlan, a former employee of the cartel.
this would be the same Rhys Kinlan you shot this morning?
in self-defense, yes.
look, I saw Mr. Kinlan on the street today.
I followed him to a brownstone where he appeared to be staying.
I thought he might be useful to my investigation.
but when I told him I was D. E.A.he panicked.
he attacked me.
I-I had no choice but to restrain him.
and Miss Watson?
I regret that, but under the circumstances, I assumed that she was working with Mr. Kinlan.
he managed to free himself.
he came at me with a knife, so I fired on him.
you know, um, I heard from a mutual acquaintance of ours a little while ago.
Sherlock Holmes.
I believe you two talked on the phone today.
he wishes he could be here, but he actually went to the hospital to see if Mr. Kinlan pulls through.
and just-just out of curiosity, if Kinlan does pull through, whose version of events do you think he's gonna agree with?
yours?
or Miss Watson's?
I don't think I care very much what a known drug dealer has to say.
hard to imagine a jury will either.
this is... from the District Attorney.
tell us where the girl is and he'll guarantee you protective custody while you're in prison.
you do not want to find yourself in gen pop, Agent Diaz.
especially not after your cartel friends realize you've been spying on them.
look, I'm sorry.
I wish I could help.
actually, I think you're hoping Emily dies.
cause then there's no one to testify.
you might actually get away with everything.
did you know that the apartment you're doing the undercover stint in is about half a block away from an Ethiopian restaurant?
I get takeout from there sometimes. So what?
did you also know that there are exactly five pre-war buildings in a one-mile radius of that restaurant and your apartment?
three of those buildings are abandoned.
it's ideal for stashing a kidnapped girl.
Holmes shared a theory with me.
he thinks Emily's being kept in a pre-war building in close proximity to an Ethiopian restaurant.
right now, I've got a small army of cops searching the aforementioned buildings.
now, personally, I think it's just a matter of time before they find her.
but considering that she needs medical attention, I would prefer it be sooner rather than later.
now, if you'd like to reconsider the D. A.'s generous offer, you know where we'll be.
wait. Wait.
you'd think after everything I've done to my liver, it could deflect a couple of bullets, huh?
Emily. Is she... - Safe.
recovered a short while ago.
Where's your... better half?
as you can imagine, Miss Watson was quite spent after this morning's ordeal.
she's getting some rest.
she saved my life, you know.
as I understand it, she was just returning the favor.
what's this?
money.
not my father's money.
I returned that a few hours ago.
it's just... some cash I keep lying around the brownstone to pay informants.
it's not much, but, um, I assume you'll want to go on the lam again once you've recovered.
is that for my benefit or for yours?
the road to recovery, I've found, is as treacherous as it is tedious.
tests of my sobriety arise almost daily.
you were just the most recent.
I believe in you.
always will.
dad.
and here I thought ol' Angus had finally met his maker.
you remembered his name.
consider us touched.
how long have I been asleep for?
just over six hours.
you did a remarkable thing today, Watson.
I just stopped the bleeding till the paramedics got there.
after you incapacitated an armed gunman.
Angus helped.
he offered me cocaine last night.
he thought I needed it to find his daughter.
it was right there on the table.
that's why I threw him into the chair.
but you didn't use it.
want to talk about it?
not with you.
that is to say, I think it's a tale more suited to a group setting.
others may find inspiration in my abstinence.
apparently.
um, there's a meeting in Cobble Hill in about 15 minutes. - Yeah.
so, I was thinking, um, if you can hold off on dinner for a bit then, you might join me?
San JOES, CALIFORNIA
help, please! We're in here!
help, please!
it's my mom, my dad and my brother.
I got the kid.
seizing. Diaphoretic.
I don't know what happened.
are they going to be okay? What's wrong?
paralysis.
I'll go back for the traction board.
there's no time. The kid just stopped breathing.
he's cyanotic, we got to tube him.
you have to help them, please! - Both breathing.
come on now, son. We're losing him.
ellsworth Air...
Dr. Hood.
I'm Wallace Bennett, Chief of the Major Investigations Division.
I'm heading the Go Team on this case.
I put in a call to the FBI director to thank him for sending you over here on such short notice.
my people have been over operations, structures, power plants, systems and human performance, but so far, we've got nothing.
we also did a full battery of chemical testing for explosive residue.
results negative across the board.
we keep mining the same data, but there's something we're missing here and I...
over and over. Over and ove.
Dr. Hood, we need something...
Dr. Hood? Dr. Hood?
did you hear a word I just said?
ice cream.
excuse me?
do you have ice cream?
and a hot plate.
vanilla.
Dr. Hood, what the hell is this all about?
the landing gear on this aircraft is directly adjacent to the engine, right?
that's where they tend to put it.
so...
after a long flight, it's going to get very hot.
so...
you bring my entire investigation to a halt just to tell my people that engines get hot?
on the night the plane crashed, the temperature on the ground was minus 20 Celsius.
that is way below freezing.
thermal shock fracture. - Yup.
we tested the hydraulics in the landing gear for extremes, but not for rapid temperature change.
I don't suppose the NTSB could help me get a new watch?
I'll give you my damn Rolex.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
Dr. Hood's employers at the FBI are perfectly capable of reimbursing him for any expenses andor...
Mr. Bennett, this is Special Agent Rachel Young, my, um...
I'm his FBI handler.
and we've got somewhere else to be. Sir.
a family in San Jose, California ate breakfast approximately 36 hours ago.
And?
and they've been paralyzed ever since.
we did a tox screen for botulism and Lyme disease, spinal taps for meningitis.
negative on all counts.
it has to be poisoning of some kind.
wrinkle is the daughter ate the same breakfast as the rest of the family, continues to be asymptomatic.
are you Jacob Hood with the Bureau?
he is. And you are?
I'm Agent Morris, FDA.
this is my colleague Agent Wilson with the CDC.
we both requested you. Thanks for coming in so quickly.
heard about your work on the hantavirus case last March.
I'd like to hear about your work here, earlier today.
we screened and catalogued the stomach content on all three victims, plus the asymptomatic daughter.
no toxins or bacteria known to lead to paralysis.
the CDC's primary objective is to keep this thing from spreading, while we at the FDA are mainly concerned with the safety of the food chain.
but frankly... - We're stumped.
Where's the daughter?
Emily Stanner, 16 years old.
she's in with the police right now.
they think she did this?
well, they don't know what to think.
a teenage kid put antifreeze in his parents' iced tea.
turned out he was pissed off about being grounded.
listen, Emily, the truth is, lots of kids get angry at their parents.
look...
if your folks are mistreating you or abusing you, mentally, emotionally
even physically, it could count in your favor.
tell me the truth about everything you know, and it could go a long way towards helping you out in court later.
excuse me, uh, but we're busy here, if you don't mind, huh?
I do mind.
you shouldn't be in the same room with this patient, not without adequate protection.
what do you mean, "protection"?
she's carrying type 5 c-vector airborne virus.
it's highly contagious, no known cure.
really, no one mentioned this to you?
it's okay, as long as you've had no physical contact, it should be fine.
don't go anywhere.
I'm going to look into this.
don't worry-- there's no such thing as a type 5 c-vector.
I said that to scare them off so I could talk to you in private.
my name's Jacob Hood.
I'm kind of the science guy for the FBI.
my family-- are they going to be okay?
is the same thing gonna happen to me?
I don't know.
that's what I'm here to find out.
the police, they think that...
I didn't do anything to my mom, my dad or my little brother.
I know.
you do?
Yeah. The forensic pathologists, they've been over your house with a fine-toothed comb to find anything that would've caused your family's paralysis.
so if you're a poisoner, you're a very good one.
and I've seen your high school transcripts, and Chemistry, well, you failed it, twice.
so I don't think you're too much of a threat.
what I want to know is, is there anything you can remember that you did differently from your family yesterday morning? Anything at all?
no.
all we did was eat breakfast.
just breakfast.
we've already got forensics. Want to tell me again why we're here?
any idea, Rachel, how many seemingly innocuous household ingredients could actually kill you?
air freshener?
smells good.
key ingredient: formaldehyde.
could cause headaches, nausea, nosebleeds, dizziness, memory loss...
margarine? What's poisonous about margarine?
the benzoic acid.
fatally so, if you're allergic to it.
you know the use of the term "nontoxic" is only for advertising.
it has no regulated governmental definition whatsoever.
well, nothing in here looks all that dangerous.
be that as it may, we've got a sample size of four subjects, three who ate breakfast and got sick, and one who ate the same breakfast and didn't get sick.
make that a sample size of five.
looks like they have a dog.
Hey, Eddie. - Hey, Mom.
Hey, son. - Brought the mail up.
how about a cold one?
don't mind if I do.
you gonna stay for supper?
sounds like a plan.
what's in the mail?
Oh, relax, Mom, it's just bills and junk.
we got it, Bob.
all right.
notification of full payment.
we did it, babe. - We sure did.
Eddie, we paid off the farm.
we need to celebrate.
forget the beers, we are opening the champagne tonight.
that's an idea.
you know, about a year ago, we were a hair's breath away from losing the place.
now...
it's ours, free and clear.
and we have you to thank for that.
let's go get some champagne. Come on.
one of the nice things about dogs is that they're omnivores, just like us humans.
so, Trixie probably just had a little bit of everything the Stanners did.
poor Trixie.
so why aren't the Stanners dead?
because dogs metabolize toxins much faster than we do.
look. Single mass...
going down the digestive tract into the stomach.
or up out of the stomach, as the case may be.
what is it?
fungus.
help! Please! I need help!
Emily, your family's bodies have been, uh, colonized by a fungal organisms, kind of like a mold, that's growing inside of them.
and normally the doctors would give them an anti-fungal medication that kill the fungus and allow them to get better.
but you tried that, and it didn't work?
well...
in this case, um, even though we have killed the-the fungus, the paralysis is still progressing.
so we are trying to find out why that is.
I don't have any other family.
you have to fix them.
this is our fungus.
take a look.
it's... beautiful.
botrytis cinerea.
it's everywhere.
there's probably spores of it in the air we're breathing right now.
don't worry-- it only, uh, grows on plants.
that's why it's on the food inside the dog, but not actually on the dog's tissues itself.
so Trixie ate whatever the family ate.
and we know the family ate plant material-- fruits and vegetables
but we don't know which fruits andor vegetables were contaminated.
there's our conundrum.
in its natural state, botrytis cinerea is completely harmless to humans.
from the looks of that specimen, I'd say it's been genetically modified.
and it's not harmless anymore.
San...
care to explain why we're hunting a deadly fungus in a wine shop?
because some winemakers use genetically modified fungus in their product.
and Coppertina Vineyards is one of the world's leading makers of botrytized wine.
once upon a time in Medieval France, there was a nobleman who liked to oversee every aspect of the winemaking in his domain.
control freak.
exactly.
until one summer, he fell in love.
so he took the fair maiden to his bedchamber.
they pretty much stayed there.
they couldn't wait any longer, so in desperation they picked the molding grapes off the vine and made wine out of what was left.
And?
and it was delicious.
so they named this fungus, our little fella, botrytis cinerea
or "noble rot," after the nobleman whose great love had unwittingly created such ambrosia.
but botrytized wine making is a gamble with nature.
one too many days of rain or sun, and the whole harvest is worthless.
so why would the winemakers take that risk?
Why?
because this bottle of Coppertina's botrytized vintage is $1, 500.
the only problem with your botrytis theory is that the Stanners didn't have wine for breakfast.
so how did they get sick?
a fungus's spores kind of work like, um...
this little fella.
any organism that reproduces by spreading itself over the largest area possible, you'd be a fool to think that just 'cause you put it on one crop that's where it's gonna stay.
so the fungus could be...
anywhere.
what's wrong with his eyes, Hood?
Keratomycosis.
it's an infection of the cornea caused by overexposure to a...
mycological organism.
english, please.
there is a fungus among us.
and I'll be it's on these grapes.
can't you read? This area's for employees only.
we-we just wanted to take a picture.
it's our first vacation.
Oh, will you take it for us?
no? Okay.
you want to see the fields, you can pay for the tour in the tasting room. Entienden?
of course. Yes. - Thank you.
come on, honey.
well, good news, bad news.
botrytis cinerea on the grapes has been genetically altered, but it's not the same strain that paralyzed the Stanner family
the nucleotide sequence is wrong.
which means we're back to square one.
you don't seem particularly bothered by this.
well, just because the fungus trail's gone cold doesn't mean the money trail isn't still hot.
I called in a favor at Quantico.
we'll have Coppertina's full financial records no later than tomorrow.
don't you need a subpoena to look into a privately held company's financial records?
gotta love the Patriot Act.
polo...
damn it, Matty.
Hey, Liz, am I in time for dessert?
Oh, Matty, you can't leave your toys...
Oh, my God!
returned home hoping to enjoy a family dinner, but found tragedy waiting instead
his wife and two children now in critical condition at Maple Valley hospital.
now authorities have yet to release an official statement on the cause of the incident, but symptoms are said to match those of a local family who became paralyzed early in the week also following a meal.
thanks for that report, Laura.
we'll let you know of any further developments regarding this very strange case of possible food contamination.
we'll be right back.
Eddie, I wanted some of that.
sorry, Mom. I thought you guys were done.
this thing is spreading, Hood.
okay, look, we know that it's a fungus.
we know that it has to be on some kind of produce.
so, why not just get the FDA to issue a mass recall on all fruits and vegetables sold in the affected area?
cause it's never going to happen.
let's be conservative and posit that our fungus is residing on some form of produce within only a 500 mile radius of the Stanner family.
okay.
california agriculture is, what, $32 billion dollar industry.
about 40, 000 square miles in the state is farmland.
so, if the FDA were to recall just the produce from our area, that is a loss of...
2. 5 billion.
I get that it's a long shot. But...
once people figure out that sething's wrong...
then they'll probably issue some kind of... voluntary recall.
they issue warnings and guidelines all the time, but people don't listen anymore.
like the boy who cried wolf.
the answer has got to be here somewhere.
it's not in there, Hood, it's in here.
it looks as though Coppertina Vineyards transferred $10 million to another company about five years ago.
do you want to know what happened next?
enlighten me.
their profits started to skyrocket.
the company they paid was...
Aeonium Agritech.
Mr. Cooper, the FBI flagged a transfer of funds between Aeonium and Coppertina Vineyards a couple years back.
can you tell us what they spent the $10 million on?
I'm afraid I can't get into any of that without our legal counsel present.
I understand, Mr. Cooper, but...
well, I'll get into it for you.
it was a botrytis fungus.
it was genetically altered, and now a variant of it is paralyzing people less than 40 miles from here.
you must know, Dr. Hood, that, uh, anyone involved in fungal biotech uses botrytis as their base organism.
it's common. It's nontoxic, relatively simple to manipulate.
uh, any one of our corporate colleagues could have made what you're looking for.
I know what you and your corporate colleagues tend to do is you push a little hard, a little bit fast
you don't really do scientific due diligence, so, uh...
in the past decade, you've introduced genetically modified product into the market without anything close to the kind of rigorous, long-term testing necessary to guarantee public safety, and now lives are at stake.
so, you think we're moving forward too fast?
you want to talk about, uh, lives at stake?
see, our products increase yield so that farmers can produce more food for people to eat.
why don't you ask the millions of people on the verge of starvation in Bangladesh, Niger, Egypt...
why don't you ask them if we're moving forward too fast?
see, you want humanity to keep its food all natural, and that's very poetic, but human beings can't eat poetry.
without genetic modification, most of the Third World will starve to death within a few months, and the rest of us...
we won't be far behind.
your altruism is an example to us all.
does that apply to the prices you charge the starving nations, or does Aeonium offer some kind of Third World starvation discount? Just curious.
any more questions, you're gonna need a warrant.
I think we still have those in this country, don't we?
you know, if you let me do my job, I could actually help you.
Jason Cooper is everything that is wrong with global agribusiness.
greed masquerading beneath a thin veneer of lofty idealism.
which is why you don't confront him head-on.
you stroke him, finesse him, get him to drop his guard, and then you pounce.
okay, I'm sorry, I apologize. But we need answers.
this is not the only place we're gonna find them.
I thought this was a public university.
it is.
welcome to the brave new world of academia, bought and paid for by multi-billion-dollar corporations.
these companies finance the university's labs, and the scientists who work in them, they pay millions of dollars in sponsorship, and in return they get to keep all discoveries the university makes.
so, all of Aeonium's research... - Is here.
what are they doing?
recording spectra from deep in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, through the visible region, into the near infrared.
no, really, what are they doing?
may I?
you got the wrong maximum absorbency wavelength.
for pnitrophenol, the machine should be at 410, not 418.
I knew that.
Oh, who's, uh...
who's been, uh, working with botrytis fungus?
Oh, that's, uh...that's Professor Altschuler.
botrytis has been his thing ever since he was an undergrad at Cal Tech.
looks good-- who's his underwriter?
well, we're here with the...
FBI.
and, uh, I'd kind of like to talk to Professor Altschuler.
Yeah. Sure...
I mean, if you can find him.
he's MIA.
he hasn't been into work all week, and he's not returning his phone calls, either.
not gonna get tenure slacking off like that.
no.
Mr. Cooper, Karl Altschuler is here.
I told him you were busy, but...
this is why we stopped.
this is what we thought could happen.
I read that.
calm down, Karl.
I won't calm down!
people are dying because...
you restarted the project against my explicit recommendation.
and I followed your recommendation, and I shut that research down.
my name is all over this research, Jason.
this isn't connected.
it's in the records.
it just can't be.
it is, and you know it.
be very careful, Karl.
you have a career to think about.
and if you start telling everybody that Aeonium is involved in this, well...
an accusation is just as good as a guilty verdict in this day and age.
and it's just as dangerous, too.
for you.
for all of us.
for all of us, Karl.
Altschuler last swiped his credit card here.
patriot Act again?
you're lucky I'm not tempted to abuse my powers.
this should be it.
professor Altschuler?
professor Altschuler, it's the FBI.
let's try this.
he's dead.
drug overdose?
I'll call the police.
fascinating.
that's got the thickened tail of the Androctonus crassicauda, but the size and coloring of the Leiurus quinquestriatus.
but it's a scorpion.
Yeah, it's a scorpion.
but it's no species I've ever seen before.
I expect a geneticist of Altschuler's caliber would be more than able to engineer a hybrid.
so, what are you, a bug expert, too?
it's not a bug; it's an arachnid.
and no, I'm no expert.
someone very close to me was, um, involved in an experimental brain cancer treatment that used scorpion venom.
it was your wife...
right?
I...I know she died of cancer two years ago.
Yeah, it was quite a promising treatment, actually, but, um...
unfortunately, not quite on time.
I'm sorry, Hood.
this wasn't drug related.
this was an overdose of scorpion venom.
the thing about scorpions is they don't go for humans.
they go for insects.
that's it.
it's a pesticide.
what?
Oh, my God, it's brilliant.
scorpion venom is made to paralyze insects.
if Altschuler could take the botrytis fungus and combine it with the scorpion venom, he would have a totally organic pesticide.
to spray on the produce...
to kill insects with the venom?
and that is what has been paralyzing our victims.
no bite marks or stings.
and nobody's going to be checking for scorpion venom because the only deadly scorpions native to the U. S.are in the Arizona desert.
what I don't understand is why the venom was released in our victims when it's only supposed to attack insects.
or why it affected everyone in the Stanner family except for Emily.
we've got the bullet, but we don't have the trigger.
no...
but we have something else.
poor bastard.
he was trying to atone for the mess he made.
but to make enough antibodies to produce a scorpion antivenin, he'd have to endure sting after sting.
let's just hope the dose that killed him was enough to turn his blood...
into a cure.
Dr. Richards has the hospital toxicologist working on synthesizing an antivenin from Altschuler's blood.
we'll just have to wait and see.
you hungry?
no, I'm fine.
hood, you should eat something.
you call that eating?
I know, the sweet tooth.
you could've just asked.
this is it; this is the trigger.
my candy?
you know what's in this?
Licoricey" goodness?
insects.
Carmine.
it's a red food coloring made from a South American beetle.
I'm suddenly in the mood for some fresh produce.
have you had breakfast yet, Mr. Cooper?
strawberries, maybe?
Rachel, what did the Stanners have for breakfast?
corn flakes, pancakes, fruit salad...
grapefruit juice?
pink grapefruit juice made with carmine.
and the fruit salad probably contained fungus from your pesticide.
the Sheridan family.
Oh, the Sheridan family, they ate any number of fruits and vegetables for dinner.
finished with red velvet cake, carmine red.
it's a synergy effect.
see, the fungus, it attacks the insect proteins.
it doesn't know they've already been eaten by a human.
so the fungus is the loaded gun, and the food coloring containing the insect proteins is the trigger.
around two years and several million dollars into the project, we decided that the end product wasn't viable anymore.
you see, when we fed our test animals food which was dusted with the, uh, pesticide, see, most of them were fine.
except for one.
which was paralyzed.
I mean, we did everything by the book, you know, for a phase three trial.
the test sample sizes, genetic lines, everything.
and I thought it was just some kind of anomaly, but Altschuler, of course, he was obsessed, so he, he did a culture of the dead animal's body, ran all kinds of tests and...
and that's when he discovered the fatal synergy.
we stopped the project before it went any further.
we sent what was left to a biowaste disposal facility, and that was that.
until now.
you should have contacted the authorities the minute you suspected something.
if those people die, it's negligent homicide.
no, uh, you got to believe me here.
I have all the paperwork on file, uh, all of our waste goes to a federally licensed disposal facility just east of here.
it's a 45-minute drive.
northern calipornia enviromental inc.
all right, all right!
nice and easy!
this one checks out.
where are the rest?
that's it!
ground radar confirms we got ten tanks of pesticides.
there should be 14.
we're going to have to question all these workers, anyone whose had access to the disposal field in the past 12 months.
hood, car!
where are the four missing canisters of Aeonium pesticide?
people are going to die!
tell me!
o - Okay...Okay!
I-I gave them to my dad.
I just wanted to help him out a little, that's all!
and it did!
sir!
put the can down!
you get away.
my boy called me and told me to burn the fields.
that's exactly what I'm doing.
people are sick because you put Aeonium pesticides in your crops.
you put the lives of every person who ate produce from your farm at serious risk.
by burning your fields, there's a very good chance you're going to spread whatever organism made those people sick to the neighboring farms.
you see those fields over there?
monsanto.
you see these fields over here?
crops all the way to the base of those mountains?
that's Dole.
when my father's father settled this land, it was small family farms for as far as the eye could see.
now, we're the only ones left.
drop it, now.
last year we almost lost this place.
Yeah, when we planted the new crop my boy called me and he said,"Dad,
he says,"I got something that we can put on the crops "that'll really make a difference.
so we put it on there.
we used it, yes, sir.
now, I knew where it come from.
it worked so good, I didn question it.
well, maybe you should have.
that's the state police.
it's over, sir.
well, I'll, uh...
I'll, I'll go with you.
I'm sorry about what we did.
I'm real sorry.
mom, Dad, this is Dr. Hood.
he's the only one that believed I wasn't trying to poison you guys.
thank you.
Oh, don't mention it.
I'm just glad the scorpion antivenin worked.
but Emily still needs to see a chemistry tutor.
we were lucky.
fungus tends to mutate really quickly.
sooner or later, there'd be a hardier strain and way more people would've been at risk.
guess I'm going to have to look at my food labels more closely from now on.
uh, natural coloring.
so, you're saying that's just bugs, huh?
maybe, maybe not.
according to the FDA as long as it's "natural" it could be anything.
green food coloring, on the other hand, is a petroleum derived triphenylmethane.
nothing natural about it.
yummy.
come on, Sacha. Come on. Come on.
that was almost twice as fast as the last time.
that little guy is gonna save a lot of lives.
here's your reward, dude.
get to chill with your buddies.
get in there.
Dr. Miller, has he been getting the required amount of sleep?
this is nice work, Bruce.
you've exceeded our most optimistic projections.
by a large margin.
well, how fast can you be ready for clinical trials?
to collate and quantify the data, we're talking months now, not years.
now, if this thing ramps up as it should, Belton Pharmaceuticals is gonna let you write your own ticket.
cage...
everything okay?
Yeah, just a question down at the lab.
I better go.
don't want to fall behind schedule.
sacha, what have you done?
washington, D.C.
where did he say to meet him?
right here.
Dr. Hood, Special Agent Young, I'm Henry Brooks.
I appreciate you taking the time to see me.
Colonel Brooks, isn't it?
that's right. With the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
darpa, the folks who really invented the Internet.
tell me, Dr. Hood, what do you know about the Warfighter Enhancement Program?
well, I gather there's a great emphasis on miniaturizing some of the 80-plus pounds of gear carrie by the average soldier, enhancing the strength and flexibility of battle armor.
that's only part of it.
we're also working on how to improve raw human physical and mental performance in battlefield situations.
hardware, software. Now wetware, too?
working on the soldiers themselves. Could be, um, controversial.
well, we think we mostly do a good job in balancing the scientific ethics with the need to find new ways to protect our troops in wartime.
mostly. Not always?
we've had an incident in one of our primate studies.
the contractor is a biotech start-up called Belton Pharmaceuticals.
the head researcher is a neuroscientist named Bruce Nesic.
the results were off the charts...
until this.
the chimp attack left traces of hair and blood everywhere, including on the victim.
now, local animal control authorities want him destroyed, but we have millions of dollars invested in this particular animal, and we need somebody on the ground in Nevada... yesterday.
I don't get it, Colonel. Why not use your own people?
I don't have that kind of infrastructure.
besides, anybody I could send is already too close to this research.
their objectivity could be compromised.
it's very simple, Dr. Hood.
finding out what happened in Nevada is essential for the national security of the United States.
okay, I'll look into it.
thank you.
hood, watch this.
the guy's got as much security as the President.
Hey, where are you going?
that man's agency was responsible for the world's first breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, GPS, unmanned aircraft, other things you've never heard of but you'll be using every day in ten years' time.
odds are, the science that that man makes happen will have more impact on the future than the President.
henderson, NEVADA
how's your veterinarian doing?
Dr. Miller is still unconscious.
she's stable, but just barely.
there were no signs of a break-in, so that means Sacha would have had to open his own cage and all of the others, too?
well, like us, chimps are very ingenious, even devious.
back when I was doing my grad work, I heard of a young male who picked his handler's pocket, hid the key for hours, and then freed himself.
this is Sacha.
looks docile enough now.
too docile.
he's been sedated.
well, yes, we thought it best, given what has happened.
what exactly is the nature of the research you're doing with Sacha?
he's been given a drug cocktail of neurotransmitters and endocrine compounds to enhance the mind/body performance by speeding up the chemical reactions in the brain.
it is our hope that by using this regimen, along with others like it, that we can improve the fighting abilities of the soldiers.
that's where Enhanced Warfighter funding comes in.
you are right.
now, we know that Russia and the Chinese have similar active programs, but we believe that we can leapfrog what they're doing by years.
any theories on what provoked the attack?
well, at first I thought maybe Sacha had contracted an infection of some sort, so I began running a series of tests, the results of which we'll know in a few days.
but to be frank, Dr. Hood, I think it was sabotage.
Really? Why?
some of the surveillance files from the time of the occurrence are missing.
who was the last person to have access to the files?
he's a veterinary technician.
he was Sacha's hands-on keeper.
now, when all this happened, everyone who works here in the lab was greatly affected, but Rudy just disappeared.
it adds up.
deep background checks on the personnel here turned up blog comments he made on animal rights Web sites.
I had him flagged for priority questioning.
we'll need to see everything else you have on him.
and I'd like to see your lab records, please.
uh, going how far back?
um, start of the project.
you realize that's been about five years?
I mean, it's going to take quite a while just to print out the stuff.
no need to kill any trees.
I'm all about the bandwidth.
NELLIS...
come on, man... over here!
put it up, put it up, put it up.
sorry, man, you okay?
yo, Pierce, relax, man.
nobody's trying to foul you on purpose.
Hey, Kevin. - Dr. Nesic.
I came looking for you the other night, but you weren't in your bunk.
I was probably out taking a walk, trying to relax.
what's up, Doc?
it is time for your next treatment.
can I just shower first?
of course, I can wait.
I just got a hit on a property held in the name of Rudy Callistro's sister.
get this: she was arrested for throwing red paint at a celebrity's fur coat at a fashion show.
so, runs in the family.
property's less than an hour from here
we should check it out.
maybe that's where he's holed up.
what I don't understand...
why he would harm the chimps if he loves animals so much?
well, I say it's all about the missing video.
maybe that was his idea all along: administering some kd of drug or...
or goading the chimp.
I mean, can't you just see this footage all over the Internet in the next few days?
it would be a huge public relations victory for the animal rights movement.
sometimes, Rachel, you have a very dark view of human nature.
you know, some cultures, even ones that eat meat, treat their animals with much more reect than we do.
in Japan, there's Wagyu cattle.
feed them beer, sake, massage them every day.
forget the cattle. I need someone to do that for me.
SEARCHLIGHT,...
we're in the right place.
all of these species are.
commonly used in animal testing.
who wants to know?
we're from the FBI-- we need to talk to you about Sacha.
get back here!
if I have to shoot you to get you to stop, I'm gonna be really pissed.
what the hell did you throw at me, anyway?
ground beef heart-- it's cheap, and if the animals don't eat it, it goes to waste.
th's just great. Give me your other hand.
I don't know, Doc.
last time, I couldn't sleep for a week afterward.
a common side effect.
it will diminish over time.
that's not all. I'm tense all the time.
I get these headaches, and the meds you give me aren't really helping, either.
if it's all the same to you, I'd rather just skip this treatment.
I understand, but we're at a crucial stage of the sequence.
in fact, this may be the last one.
I really just want to go home.
I thought the whole point of this posttraumatic stress disorder therapy was to make it easier for me to spend time with my family in-between deployments.
this is... it's just taking me away from them.
Kevin, you know the stats.
the whole point of all the treatments is to reduce conflict on the home front.
tell me that doesn't interest you.
Yeah, but I didn't sign up to be a damn guinea pig.
why did you volunteer for this study?
for my wife.
then, why do you want to quit at this point in the game when we're so close?
okay, Doc.
I'll take my medicine like a big boy.
so you went to work for Belton in order to sabotage the lab?
no. I was only there to gather information.
laying the groundwork for a new Equal Rights Amendment that includes all species.
the way science is treating animals-- it-it's criminal.
sometimes.
but you're diabetic, right?
how you know that?
your fingertips.
from, uh, testing for blood sugar with a, what, portable glucose meter?
the discovery of insulin, which makes it possible for diabetics like yourself to live with the disease, was made possible by animal testing.
without the sacrifice of those animals, you'd be dead.
Rudy, what do you think happened at the lab?
it's obvious, isn't it?
Nesic is the Dr. Frankenstein of the animal kingdom.
he takes peaceful primates and turns them into killers.
why did you run?
cause when it all went to hell,
I knew that Nesic would find some way to blame me for what happened.
did you steal the surveillance video?
no. No. - Download any files?
I never accessed the system and I never took anything.
okay. Let's say we buy your story.
is there anything you can remember that might help us to figure out what's going on with Sacha?
Yeah. I did notice something.
you know chimps exhibit handedness just like people do, right?
for picking up items like seeds or raisins.
some prefer the left-hand, and some the right.
well, Sacha was a righty.
but in the last few days, hewitched.
he went totally ambidextrous for, for feeding himself, and he even began to favor his left hand.
pathogens turn up anything?
not yet.
did you also test for T. gondii?
Toxoplasmosis? No.
Toxoplasmosis?
Yeah, it's a parasite that infects the mind of its hosts and can alter behavior and things like handedness.
but there are no felines or rodents at this facility.
and they're your most common carries of toxoplasmos.
well, it could have come in contact with any number of species during transshipment.
you may be right. That could help explain Sacha's actions.
we'll test for it.
Sacha's gone.
let's go, lock 'em down.
all right, come on, now.
all right, put that up, put that up.
Oh, yeah, yeah. All right, come on, come on.
you all right, man? - No, I'm out.
Hey, Kev, Nick's hurt. Come on.
Hey, Kev, get your stuff on, man.
Hey, Kevin, let's play some ball, man. Come on.
you'll never get away with this...
Kevin? - Daddy!
Hey, hey, buddy.
what are you doing here?
honey, I thought you only came home on weekends?
why aren't you at the base?
what's wrong, Kevin? Are you okay?
I got a killer headache, babe. We got an aspirin or something? Stronger the better.
are you hung over? - No.
just my head hurts, that's all.
Jackson, honey, you just keep watching TV, okay?
mommy and Daddy need to have a talk.
I haven't been drinking. I just had to see you.
Kevin, the therapy you're getting is supposed to help you be with us.
you need to get back before they think you're AWOL.
just wanted to see my wife and kid.
and my head hurts.
from those treatments. The ones that are supposed to be helping me.
damn it!
Kevin, your hand. - It's fine. Did you see what I just did?
Yeah, you punched a hole in the cabinet... - Not that. I...
I just, I-I threw a left. I should have thrown a right.
I'm a righty.
you shouldn't have thrown a punch at all.
it's these stupid treatments.
Abby, I'm sorry. It's just...
I know. I'm sorry, too.
I can't pretend to know what it was like to be in combat.
I don't know what you saw out there.
but I'm glad to have you here. At home.
Thanks. We'll be in touch.
animal Control has every available officer doing a grid search for Sacha.
let's hope they turn something up.
does the data check out?
I've only really seen the tip of the iceberg.
it's going to take a while to sift through.
you know, the Bureau is not thout its resources.
we have a entire department devoted to data analysis.
as talented as the, uh, government's programmers may be, Rachel, not many criminals are found by running linear regression on their credit card purchases and porn downloads.
analysis softwares are written to spot common denominators of falsehood.
if you're looking for anything specific, you can't really use generic data sifting code.
I get it.
instead of relying on electronic intel you need to put your own eyes on the target.
do your own legwork.
exactly.
only in this case I get do it sitting on my ass.
check left, I'll check right.
Gary, you go down the embankment, check the drainage pipe.
remember the missing chimp can hide high or low.
copy that.
special Agent Young, FBI. What've we got?
single victim, took a bad beating.
his tranquilizer gun's been fired, so he probably put up some kind of fight.
we've got compound fracture to the ulna, defensive wound, most likely.
got broken collarbones. Both elbows hyperextended.
extensive facial contusions. - Okay.
same injuries as the chimps at the lab, and Dr. Miller, the veterinarian.
you think Sacha could be responsible?
well, it's possible.
fully-grown chimpanzees are up to five times stronger than a human being.
hood. Over here.
the Animal Control Officer's tranq dart did hit Sacha.
but the chimp must have attacked before the drugs could take effect.
it looks like the officer inflicted Sacha's fatal injury while defending himself.
Where's Sacha?
well, Dr. Nesic, I believe Animal Control and County Coroner are having an interesting jurisdictional debate about the body.
seeing as how a chimp shares 98% DNA with a human.
who should get the corpse?
I'll take Sacha back to the lab with me.
he's the property of Belton Pharmaceuticals.
and we have not completed our research.
I'm sorry, Dr. Nesic. This is a criminal matter now.
it's out of your hands.
faster! Faster! Faster, Mommy!
more! More!
contents of the bowel was very interesting.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Sacha's large bowel was empty.
just what you'd expect after a sudden death.
his bowel should have evacuated immediately upon dying.
but there was no signs of defecation where the body was found.
anything in his system would have left at least a trace where he died.
more likely a big trace.
which means Sacha was killed somewhere else.
his body must have been planted there after his death.
also means Sacha couldn't have attacked the Animal Control Officer.
then who did?
Dr. Hood, we're about to cut into his skull.
just one moment. I have to see what was inside his skull.
Kevin, baby, you've been in there a long time.
are you coming to bed?
congratulations, Hood, you've got me staring at monkey brains.
well, they're worth staring at.
well, no paramecia-- rules out toxoplasmosis.
most of the brain structures look normal.
see the, uh, amygdala here.
it's pretty much the same in chimps as it is in humans.
it's the center of the fear response.
e fight-or-flight reflex.
when the senses tell it of a threat, it responds by sending alarm signals to the, uh, other organs
the pituitary, aenal glands--they flood the system with adrenaline so you either run away or you fight your attacker.
or an enemy soldier.
that's not all.
the amygdala helps regulate handedness.
all of Sacha's new behaviors-- his aggressive reactions, his change from rit to left handedness
all would tend to indicate changes of that part of the brain.
so Nesic was messing with the amygdala?
Yeah, somehow, Nesic managed to make Sacha's two amygdalae twice their normal size.
which speeds up reactions.
it's like when you sneeze.
when you sneeze every muscle in your body involuntarily convulses.
by giving the amygdala the size and heft to take over the entire system,
I mean dealing with total force, you're kind of turning the urge to
to violence into the equivalent of a sneeze.
something you can't control.
the result?
the subjects-- the-the chimps would respond to any perceived threat, no matter how small, with overwhelming force.
that's one hell of an unintended consequence.
I'm not so sure it's unintended.
come on.
all right. Bring it up. Bring it up.
Hey, check it out.
gentlemen!
anyone know of the whereabouts of Kevin Pierce?
it is very important that I speak with him.
nobody?
for a three-day leave at the Hard Rock Casino, all expenses paid?
if he has gone AWOL, you could save him a lot of trouble.
you would be helping him.
we're not stupid, Doc.
sergeant Pierce does need help.
and whatever you've been doing to him, it ain't working.
that's right.
so you here to play?
or just hog the ball?
I know that you think that you are watching his back, but you are screwing him.
you are screwing yourselves.
Nesic's data is perfect.
too perfect.
what do you mean?
let me show you.
Minibar-- expensive.
Oh, don't worry, Rachel.
live a little.
now this is what data looks like.
it's a group of far-flung points on a graph.
can I use your phone charger, please?
thank you.
if we were to draw a curve on this data, it would look something like this.
see, the phone charger represents a line that encompasses a general rule.
we call that an average of all the data points.
but Nesic's data doesn't look like that.
Nesic's data never leaves the curve.
that...is statistically impossible.
you're saying he fit the data to the curve, rigged it to say what he wants it to say.
well, he's definitely hiding something.
the question is what?
we need to get back in his lab, now.
this is Special Agent Young.
I need the Megahut to send Entry and Exit people for T-3s.
I'll give you the address.
I absolutely love, that for once, you have no idea what I'm talking about.
the Entry and Exit specialist should be here any minute.
so, Hood, I've been meaning to ask you...
how exactly did you get this gig?
1986 World Series.
excuse me?
Mets versus Red Sox.
I'm a Mets fan.
and, uh, one of my classmates at Princeton was this, uh, annoyingly button-down history major from Boston.
so he had tickets for the games, but he had no way of getting there.
I had a 1979 VW Passat that I'd modified to run on vegetable oil.
so, we, um, inevitably, declared a truce, and, um, we ended up driving up to, uh, Fenway.
we watched game ve.
then we drove down to the city, and we saw game six at Shea Stadium.
by the time we got home to Princeton, he and I were pretty much friends.
he went on to become an officer in the Marines, and earn his law degree.
and become director of the FBI.
that's exactly right.
one day, he gives me a call, king for a favor, and before I know it, I'm spending most of my time with people like you, in places like this...
Hey!
don't worry.
you ever get into trouble with the Bureau, I got plenty of dirt on the director you can use to get out of it.
here we go.
agent Reed, sorry for the short notice.
no problem.
Thanks.
any time.
Rachel, tell me this is legal.
please, we've got the FBI and DARPA behind us.
I'm pretty sure we can get the breaking-and-entering charges thrown out.
six?
so?
there are only six primate cages.
Nesic had extensive histories on seven experimental subjects.
what are you looking for, exactly?
well, we've seen how numbers can be manipulated.
I'm looking for hard, scientific evidence.
he must keep the blood and tissues samples somewhere.
hood, I think I've got it.
the samples are in here.
subject seven's blood chemistry is...all wrong.
he's got type AB...
and only one primate has type AB.
subject seven is a human being.
there you are.
Hi, Abby.
Dr. Nesic?
is something wrong with Kevin?
I don't know.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Oh, God.
Kevin may be having extended combat flashbacks.
I've seen it before with soldiers suffering from PTSD.
I told him he should go back to the base.
you've seen him then?
is he here?
I need to get a hold of him.
no, Kevin's not here.
but I can tell him to call you when I see him.
good-bye.
I apologize.
this wasn't on my radar.
it turns out the company Nesic's working for is running another defense-related study 20 minutes up the road from your location at Nellis Air Force Base.
they're testing therapies on a sequestered group of return combat troops who suffer from PTSD.
any indication which one might be subject seven?
one of them, a Sergeant Kevin Pierce, left the facility without permission after exhibiting strange behavior.
it sounds like our guy.
Dr. Hood, Agent Young, if you need anything else, you just ask.
we will.
thank you, sir.
thank you.
we need to get to this air force base, now.
I think it was Pierce that attacked the animal control officer.
he probably approached him in what seemed like a threatening manner.
Pierce would've responded autonomically, as if programmed, his nervous system taking over to deal with any received threat.
so maybe Nesic staged Sacha's escape to hamper our investigation.
when the animal control officer was attacked, Nesic saw an opportunity to end the scrutiny.
he killed Sacha, then planted the body, and then went
well, if that's true, then Pierce is out there and is a danger to himself
Nesic's out there, too.
I'm gonna order a 24-hour guard for our injured veterinarian.
she's the only witness we've got.
we come from all different units, different areas around the country, but we all got the same story.
when I came back from over there, it was like, like the world was moving in slow motion, and I was still in combat speed.
so when they offered this study, I jumped on it.
you know, anything to help me fit back in.
has it helped?
maybe.
we mostly just sit around watching videos, filling out psych tests.
but your friend, Pierce, got special treatment.
Yeah, they hit him hard, man.
I mean, drugs, endurance tests.
I mean, he was hurting.
always after my painkillers.
he even started shifting the hand he dribbled with playing ball.
you know, he went from right to left.
it was weird.
this is very important, Private Vasquez.
sergeant Pierce is not in trouble, but we need to find him for his own good.
that's the same thing Nesic said when he came looking for him.
Nesic was here?
when?
last night.
looking for Kev, same as you.
we didn't tell him, jack, though.
what makes you think we're gonna tell you?
before being assigned to Dr. Hood,
I spent six months as an FBI component of Task Force Eagle in Kabul, Afghanistan.
I worked with guys like you, everyday, doing sensitive site exploitations, looking for intel and what the bad guys might be up to.
I'm not one of them, and neither is he.
I believe that you've all been victims of a scientific fraud.
Dr. Nesic has already aborted one failed experiment, and I believe he's trying to the same with Kevin Pierce, and any one of you could be next.
that's why I think you should tell me.
there's a park near here.
you know, a couple times when things got rough, he'd go there, decompress, chill out.
thank you.
yo, Joey, we've got your stuff.
hell, man, that ain't Jo.
look at what we got here.
this is a place of business, homes.
we don't need any suspicious looking characters bringing the cops around.
did you hear a word he just said?
you need to leave, buddy.
my phone died.
do either one of you guys have a spare cell phone battery?
are you kidding me?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, baby, it's me.
I didn't recognize the number.
it scared me.
I had to borrow a phone.
I just called to tell you that...
it's almost over.
what?
what's almost over?
what's happening? Where are you? Why did you leave?
I had to leave, babe.
I didn't want you to get hurt.
who's going to hurt us?
I am. - What?
nothing.
Kevin, Dr. Nesic stopped by today. He wants to talk to you.
Yeah, I got something to say to him, too.
you're not in some kind of trouble, are you?
when are you coming home?
I can't come home yet, babe.
not until I stop it.
stop what?
the war?
you're home now, Kevin.
I know where I am.
I'm not crazy.
it's okay, Jackson.
come to Mommy.
is he still awake? Put him on, okay?
daddy.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, buddy.
you remember when I used to sing you to sleep when you were little?
I'd sing, Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder what you are Up above the earth so far Like a rocket powered car.
good night, pal.
now remember, if we find Pierce, we need to approach him in a nonthreatening manner.
try not to...
you know.
a nine millimeter casing.
Oh, God.
they're alive. Barely.
this is Special Agent Young.
I need an ambulance at Desert View Park, 415 Ryder Street.
Hey, Hood, blood and tire tracks.
I think Pierce took their car.
he could be anywhere.
not anywhere.
he was hurt.
private Vasquez said he was seeking painkillers.
he'll be looking for a pharmacy.
Freeze!
put your hands up!
hands where I can see them!
unit five-David, requesting backup. Subject in sight.
turn around!
Pierce, stop!
don't. - Hood...
the slightest move could set him off.
let me do my job.
put the gun down.
trust me.
listen to me, Kevin.
we're not here to hurt you.
we know what they've been doing to you.
we're going to make it stop.
who the hell are you?
my name's Jacob Hood.
I'm a scientist.
Oh, like Nesic?
no, not like Nesic.
nothing like Nesic.
sergeant, can I ask you a question?
I want you to answer very carefully.
what do you want to happen here?
how do you want this to play out?
I need to make it stop.
I have to keep them from doing this to anybody else.
well, in order for that to happen, you've got to focus.
first you have to let these men go.
if you kill them, it's all over.
there won't be anything I can do for you.
I think I understand what's going on in your head.
every nerve must be screaming for you to go into action.
the urge must be uncontrollable, but you're gonna have to damp it down somehow.
use the part of your thoughts you can control and think it through.
think about where you are.
think about what your options are.
make a choice.
FBI. This man is now in federal custody.
stand down.
I repeat, stand down.
it's okay.
it's over.
no.
it's not.
not until you see this.
Hello? Kevin?
sergeant Pierce isn't coming, Dr. Nesic.
but he was, um...kind enough to let me have the missing video.
what are you doing here?
when he broke in, he just wanted to destroy the lab and free the chimps, but they attacked him.
so he fought back.
Dr. Miller was working late, heard the commotion. - What are you doing?
stop!
well, you know results.
Congratulations.
you found a way of turning off the conscience.
soldiers with no moral or ethical compunction about killing, able to act, react...
lightning efficiency.
say that without the...
smug, self-righteous sneer, and it sounds like a heroic advance to me.
an advance?
Really?
don't think you've given much thought to the long-term implications of this.
you think someone like Pierce will ever be able to reintegrated into society?
do you even care that you may have destroyed a young man's life?
I'm trying to save his life.
save all of their lives.
do I have to remind you...
every day soldiers die in the field.
my work will help them to survive.
Oh, he'll survive.
no thanks to you.
he's in federal custody.
Dr. Nesic.
you can tell the caliber of a man by the way he faces up to his mistakes.
the bad ones always make it worse by trying to cover up their tracks, and it's the cover up that brings them down.
get him out of here.
hands behind your back.
I love you.
I love you, too.
love you.
thanks for talking me down.
I just gave you a little encouragement.
you talked yourself down.
nice work, Dr. Hood.
Nesic is going to jail and Sergeant Pierce is going to get the therapy he needs to undo what was done to him.
whatever it takes.
but the program's going to go on, isn't it?
of course. If it didn't, it would mean I wasn't doing my job.
Super-soldiers are coming.
Nesic just bent the rules too far, even for us.
you know, some people refer to DARPA as a hundred geniuses connected by a travel agent.
truth is, we're always on the lookout for number 101.
thank you, Colonel, but, uh, I got a job.
anyway, I prefer to tackle problems created by the world at large rather than problems created by my employers.
well, suit yourself.
but if you change your mind, don't hesitate to get in touch.
let's leave it this way: Next time you get yourself in trouble you have my number.
forgive me, Dr. Hood. It's my fault we're late.
I was just looking to see if I had my speech here.
I'm sure you'll do fine.
how much of an introduction do you want?
the longer you keep talking, the less I have to say.
well, we can work it out in the limo.
thanks for the heads up. I'll let the deputy director know.
ray, where's the presentation tonight?
is it the Chamber of Commerce or the NLEC?
honey?
is my bow tie straight? - Yeah.
because yours is... - Clip-on.
Really?
ray, honey, I'm having a problem here.
excuse me. - Sure.
Rachel, you okay out there?
just some neighbor reporting a prowler.
I'm ming back in.
well, hurry up. I'm fresh out of small talk...
mom, Dad? - Who's this?
get back to your room.
who's this?
I'm Jacob Hood. Who are you?
stay back! - Okay.
nobody touch me! - No one's going to touch you.
I want my baby back!
he's taken my baby! - Who did?
him!
she was an agent?
not an agent. She's a lab tech with the science division.
but she's been under the care of the state mental health system for the past six weeks.
so why'd she come after you?
she had a breakdown.
her boyfriend dumped her when she was pregnant.
then she lost the baby. Ray was her boss.
please, all he ever did was want to make sure that she was okay.
what's your problem with, uh, Deputy Director Wynne?
it's simple. He stole my baby.
but then she got this idea that the FBI had stolen her baby and Ray was the father.
I can only be sympathetic up to a point.
and obviously tonight was past the point.
look, Ray is clever.
he's going to tell you lies about me, but everything I've told you is true.
she wrote these ridiculous letters accusing him... - Sweetheart.
saying he was having her turned into a zombie.
you know what I think now?
better a zombie than a threat to my family.
honey, I'm...
reach inside my pocket.
they've been trying to reprogram me, but I ripped it out of my arm this morning.
surgical implant?
they're drugging me against my will.
I'm fighting to stay sane, but I'm losing the battle.
Dr. Hood, please help me find my baby.
Sofia, I can't help you.
you're just going to have to complete this course and try to make yourself better.
but there's nothing wrong with me, damn it!
it's okay.
I'm a scientist, Dr. Hood, just like you.
I'll beat the drugs, I'll get out, and when I do...
I'm going to make things right. All by myself. Do you hear me?
Dr. Hood, remember me.
she told the cops that Assistant Director Wynne was her secret lover and that he stole their baby.
Yeah, she told me the same thing.
I don't know-- erotomania?
it can happen. An unstable person can fixate on a high-status individual, convince themselves there's some kind of relationship whenhere isn't.
I know that look.
you're on Planet Hood. What's up?
this.
she tore it out of her own flesh with her bare hands.
she's desperate, Rachel.
she's very smart, and she believes every word she's saying.
it makes her dangerous.
very dangerous.
attention, residents, bingo will begin in the therapy center in...
Sofia Lyons has been in custody and under observation for a week now.
I don't see any threat.
well, that's true. Things definitely aren't adding up as they should.
that thing Sofia dug up out of her own flesh, I had it tested.
it was definitely a drug delivery device.
it's a biodegradable polymer implant that releases regular doses of Olanzapine.
it's a very powerful antipsychotic drug.
it was developed to, uh...
keep noncompliant patients on their meds.
but there's a lot of controversy over its use.
so she's been a part of a clinical trial.
well, to be part of a clinical trial you need to give informed consent.
to give informed consent, you need to already be stable.
which she clearly isn't.
do you think there's any credibility to her story?
ms. Lyons?
Dr. Hood.
glad to see you looking so well.
Yeah, after the last time you saw me... I'm embarrassed about that.
and Agent Young, what can I say?
how's your arm? Is that where you, uh... pulled the implant out?
it's healing nicely-- like the rest of me.
you worried a lot of people last week, Sofia.
look, do me a favor, whatever I may have said or done that night, just forget all about it.
I wasn't myself.
listen...
if there's something you wanted to tell me, you can tell me now.
no. There's nothing.
deputy Director Wynne is a decent, honest man.
look, all of my troubles were caused by this no-good boyfriend who had just left me.
disappeared without a trace.
agent Wynne and I never had an affair and that baby I held, well, it never existed-- except in my head.
okay.
that's it? - That's it.
I'm looking forward to going home.
now, I've got to wash the chlorine out of my hair.
can you guys excuse me?
so, uh, you don't need my help?
that was a mistake.
I don't need anyone anymore.
see her back? That's a new implant. Somewhere she can't reach it.
do me a favor? See if there's a hairbrush in her bag?
Where's the problem? She seems fine. - Can you?
no. - How about her room?
a hairbrush? - Just some stray hairs.
it's not the strangest thing you've ever asked me for.
attention, residents, bingo will begin in the therapy center in five minutes.
you need these? - Ah, thank you.
seem to give you a lot of freedom around here.
Yeah. That's what you get for saying yes to another implant.
Really? Well, it seems to be working.
does it?
lucky me.
Sofia's been my patient for the past six weeks.
doctor... ? - Hood.
but she's here voluntarily.
that's only because the Wynne family agreed not to press charges if she completed her treatment.
if she tries to check out, she goes to jail.
look, she's doing great. You can see the results.
are you not worried by the nature of her delusions?
I've got no interest in her delusions, only in the chemical imbalance that causes them.
while we're on that subject, how are the implant trials going?
some patients find it difficult to comply with their medications.
a slow-releasing implant could mean a decent life for a lot of unhappy people.
when the technology is finally judged safe.
I hear that with the animal trials, the monkeys try to tear the implants out. Is that true?
because they itch.
I don't think the monkeys have a problem with the science.
does Sofia Lyons have a problem with the treatment you're giving her?
you mean the treatment that's working?
well, look, Dr. Hood, she's getting what she needs.
antipsychotic drugs can be very successful treating delusions and hallucinations, but there are a lot of side effects, we know.
um, is miosis one of them?
if you mean constricted pupils, you are right.
but she was screwing her eyes up against the sun.
Yeah, that's because her pupils were wide open.
thank you for the consult. Both of you.
I'll be sure to look into it.
did you get it?
good girl.
liquid Chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis, right?
that's right, all those words, in that order.
so what's the hair gonna tell us?
well, a length of hair is basically a record of its owner's drug use through the growth period.
the follicle takes up whatever trace chemicals are in the bloodstream and locks them in the keratin.
and no amount of soap, shampoo or swimming pool chlorine is ever gonna wash it out.
wow, so you can chop up a hair and get a day-to-day picture of whatever she's been on?
not that precise, but pretty close.
is everything all right?
everything's fine.
what did Dr. Hood say to you?
Sofia, please don't worry about Dr. Hood.
just concentrate on getting better.
what's the verdict?
interesting.
from the changes in thickness along this hair,
I wouldn't say it came from a woman who'd lost a baby.
more like she carried it to full term.
damn.
what? - Felix, call the treatment center.
I don't think we can let Sofia Lyons leave.
what do you got, Hood? - See this line?
that's her antipsychotic medication.
now, here, it's up, because she's taking it.
then it goes down because she's skipping it.
then it goes up, stays steady for a while.
the first implant.
now, look what happens right after the second implant.
what are those other lines coming in?
that one, methamphetamine.
also known as crank, ice or crystal meth.
that's right. This green line at the bottom is DXM.
it's an active ingredient in cough medicines.
cough medicine? - Yeah, it accelerates the meth.
those are street drugs.
they put her on meds, she skips them.
they give her an implant, she rips it out.
they implant another where she can't reach it, and she gets hold of this chemical brew of street drugs to cancel it out.
why do that? Just to stay insane?
no one who's deluded believes they are, Rachel.
she thinks she's clinging to reality.
Sofia! Sofia! No, no, no!
Sofia! No, o, no!
looks like crystal meth and dextroamphetamine.
did you supply her with these, Louella?
definitely not.
okay, Louella, where is she? Where's Sofia?
if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
she said some very powerful man had screwed up her life just to protect himself.
I can relate to that.
Louella, if you think that by shielding her you're helping her, you're very much mistaken.
if she acts on her delusions, she's gonna get herself in some very bad trouble.
you say they're delusions.
I say that all that stuff about her being dumped by a no-good boyfriend is their cover story, not hers.
did she tell you her plans?
tell them, Louella, or I'll take away your one-hour-a-day Internet access.
do you really think I care about that?
this is my friend we're talking about here.
listen, all I can tell you is we want to help her, not hurt her.
she said they were trying to take away her gift of fury, but that she needed it to get her baby back.
how is she gonna do that?
spin a web, catch the big man.
then do whatever it takes to make him give it up.
back up.
smells of bleach and battery acid.
a little kitchen chemistry going on here.
must have been here a couple of hours.
and I thought I was a bad cook.
well, I don't think you'd have tried this recipe.
extract the chlorate from the bleach, add sugar, powdered aluminum.
she's an FBI chemist, Rachel.
she knows exactly what she's doing.
I think she made a fire bomb with an acid fuse.
should burn about 1, 000 degrees Celsius.
we got to get the Wynne family out of their house and into protection.
I'll get Felix on it.
Susan, get out of the house.
pack a bag, take the kids up to the lake.
I'll be up there as soon as I can.
sir, you sure that you want to...? - Agent Lee, don't worry about it.
it's not some isolated cabin in the wilderness.
it's a weekend home in a gated community.
we'll upgrade regular security with our people.
Felix is on his way with Ray Wynne.
you know, you should let me drive once in a while.
I'm just thinking of you.
I let you drive once. Never again.
no, I'm just saying, you know, give you a break.
hood, we're not having this conversation. Forget it.
all right, I think this is it.
this? This is a weekend house?
what is it?
I was looking into Sofia's ex-boyfriend. - What?
agent Young. - Call 911.
what happened?
we got here, we went inside. There was gas.
she burst in and told us to get out.
who did? Sofia? - Yes!
how long ago? - Just now. We just made it.
which way did she go?
that way. - You stay here.
how did she know we were here?
- Dad!
- Just stay here, okay?
Dr. Hood, where you going? - Stay with the family. I've got to find Rachel.
I'm sorry. I wanted you to be Ray.
any sign?
no, I thought I heard someone cry out.
I should have pressed those charges. She'd be locked away by now.
why didn't you, Ray?
I mean, she held a gun against your wife's head. Why?
it's called sympathy. - Really?
so it wasn't to avoid having the official story tested in court?
what the hell are you talking about?
Sofia Lyons never miscarried. She had the child.
and this mysterious ex-boyfriend who everything's been blamed on, turns out the only place he actually exists is in Sofia's FBI file.
so what are you saying?
I'm saying only someone inside the FBI could have created him, not some lab tech like Sofia.
I mean, someone with very high levels of clearance.
you the baby's father?
I'm just her boss.
with a weekend home she happens to know her way around?
you see, I thought the problem was with her treatment.
but her treatment was fine.
I mean, well, it would have been, if there'd actually been something wrong with her.
but she wasn't trashing her brain with these drugs to hold onto her delusions.
she was fighting the treatment to hold onto reality.
I'm resisting the urge to give you a smack in the mouth right now.
why don't you give it a try?
no.
and only because I know I can do a whole lot better than that.
you better watch yourself.
she's passed out in the back. That's my fault. I'm sorry.
Sofia? What have you done to her?
look, the only person I have a problem with is Ray. Okay?
don't trust anything he tells you.
she okay? You hurt her?
it was an accident, okay? I'm sorry.
you could've killed the whole family.
but I didn't, did I, now, okay?
they-they weren't even supposed to be there!
the house is where Ray and I used to meet.
we made the baby there.
okay, tell me where you are. - No.
look, I looked into your story. I believe you.
I don't care whether you believe me, okay?
now that I have Agent Young, you have to do what I say.
let me talk to her.
go to my apartment, switch on my computer.
I'll call you from there. - No.
Sofia, I want to help you, but you have to let her go. Let her go.
no one's gonna help me.
I've learned my lesson now.
there's no one I can trust. - Sofia?
help!
can anybody hear me?
there's some low-rent, high-volume bachelor party out there, so...
sing along if you want to.
got you some painkillers.
and this.
it's a Wi-Fi phone.
takes weeks to trace a call, 'cause it goes over the Internet instead of the phone lines.
you're going to jail, Sofia.
you know that, don't you?
we tried to help you, but you blew it.
I can get you a pillow for your leg.
careful!
shouldn't we... - Don't touch it!
if I want to bleed to death, I'll let you know.
fine.
sir?
I found a weapon.
I believe it's Agent Young's.
any sign of her?
no, sir.
there was a crossbow and traces of blood close by.
I put down a marker and left everything as it was.
what about her phone?
no answer.
secure the scene. I want dogs in those woods and a bird in the sky.
let's find our agent.
go.
I keep a crossbow here for hunting.
so, the Director's here.
sorry this keeps hitting you so close to home, but Susan and the kids are safe, and that's what counts.
Yes, thank God.
I'm assigning an around-the-clock- protection detail for them until this woman is caught, okay?
thank you, Frank.
listen, this is not easy for me to say, but I haven't got a choice.
I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.
your man's a problem.
who are we talking about?
he provoked this situation.
he's endangered Agent Young.
I know Jacob better than that.
well, you think you do, Frank.
see if you see it the same way when he gets one of our agents killed.
agent Lee, where is Jacob?
appears as though he caught a ride out with State Police, sir.
sorry my apartment's such a mess, Dr. Hood.
let me sak to Rachel.
not yet.
I want to know she's okay.
that'll be your reward for listening to me.
okay, go on.
is anyone there with you?
is...is Ray Wynne there?
no.
you know, I don't care what he told you, we were lovers.
I didn't plan to get pregnant.
ray wanted me to have an abortion, but I said no.
then he talked me into giving the baby up for adoption.
that whole story about the boyfriend deserting me, that was for Ray's protection.
but after the birth...
I changed my mind.
I couldn't give my son up.
ray wasn't happy.
but he said he'd work something out, you know?
I don't know what happened then.
he might have drugged me.
I woke up in my house...with no baby...
and 36 hours of my life missing.
like it was an ordinary day and none of it had ever happened.
what do you want from me?
ray thinks this is all about him, but it isn't.
I just want my baby back.
okay, why don't you meet up with me and we'll sort this thing out?
no. You find out where my baby is.
I give you Agent Young and then I disappear and no one ever hears from me again.
and if that doesn't happen, I...
someone's gonna die.
still hurts?
it's getting worse.
are you sure you don't want me to...
No! No.
um, well, more of these?
here.
Yeah, you're probably right.
sometimes I wonder if I ever play a little fast and loose with the old brain chemistry.
but when Dr. Hood gets my baby back, it'll be a whole new start for me.
you may be expecting too much of him.
don't you think he will?
Dr. Hood is a genius...
and he's a genuinely good man, but practical he isn't.
you should let me make a few calls.
nice try, Agent Young.
did you really have Ray Wynne's baby?
a son.
seven pounds, nine ounces.
I even gave him a name.
What'd you name him?
I don't want to tell you...
because then I'd have to change it when I find a new place to settle down.
you honestly think that's gonna happen?
I hope so...
for your sake.
what's this?
agent Young's cell phone.
found on the roadside with Sofia Lyons' fingerprints all over it.
last phone call that came from that phone was to Jacob Hood...
right after Agent Young went missing.
what's your point, Ray?
hood didn't report it.
instead he took off after them.
why would he do that unless he had to hide something?
ray, take it easy, okay?
wouldn't you go after your own partner?
he's complicit, Frank.
maybe even directly responsible.
no, that, that's not possible.
Frank I know that you and Hood are friends, but you have to face the facts.
this Lyons girl, she's on the road to recovery.
she's doing fine.
hood goes to visit her at the treatment center.
within one hour she has walked out.
she steals a car, she blows up my home, she injures-- maybe even murders-- an agent.
and Hood, he gets in direct contact with an on-the-run suspect.
and then what does he do?
he disappears.
falls off the grid.
now if you have some innocent explanation for this,
I would really like to hear it, because my family is in danger.
who is this?
it's me, Felix.
Dr. Hood, where are you?
I'm on a pay phone outside Sofia Lyons' place.
I don't want to be traced.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
it's no kidding, Felix.
I wouldn't involve you if I could avoid it, but I think I found a way to track down the kid that Ray Wynne stole.
ray Wynne what?
I need to get out to Bethesda, where the National Institute
listen up, people.
I've just spoken with the Director himself.
Dr. Jacob Hood is now a person of interest in the wounding and suspected kidnap of Special Agent Rachel Young.
now I know most of you know that Jacob Hood has worked here as a civilian employee for the past three years.
he is, however, not a sworn agent.
he's not one of us.
unlike Rachel Young, who most definitely is.
so let's get out there.
do whatever it takes to get her back.
and make sure the man whose life she risked hers to protect
and who betrayed her-- pays for it.
let's go.
nobody followed me. Don't worry, I checked.
Felix, Rachel's hurt.
Sofia got her, but she will do a trade if I can find out what's happened to her child.
Dr. Hood, you can't do this.
let me bring you in.
the whole Bureau's out there looking for Agent Young.
and for me. Come on. You heard Ray Wynne.
everyone thinks I'm the bad guy.
if that's the best you can do, you can go back now, forget I ever called you.
seriously, I won't hold it against you.
all right.
why are we here?
something I found.
Maya Wynne's Myspace page?
Yeah, complete with photos of her dad Ray and the entire family.
now look at the whites of their eyes.
Maya's, pure white.
but the males?
look kinda yellow.
that's rig. Now...there's a harmless condition, it's called Gilbert's Syndrome.
affects five percent of the population, and normally, there's no side effects.
however, it can manifest in a jaundice that's brought on by, uh, stress or puberty.
what does that do for us?
well, it's mostly males and there's a 50% chance of it being passed on, which means there's a pretty even chance that it could be in Sofia's child.
if there really is a child, you can't be serious about giving it back to her right now.
the woman's unstable.
that may be true, but she really didn't ask for this, Felix.
was it ringing?
if Dr. Hood calls and I don't hear it, don't just lie there.
shout something!
have you ever consulted an NIH informationist before, Agent Lee?
no, it's first time...
Karen. - Ka...That's my mother's name.
Yeah, I'm running a study on the syndrome for the Bureau.
all right, well, Gilbert's Syndrome is listed in the Office of Rare Diseases.
let's see if there's anything there.
sorry to put you through the trouble.
they're supposed to notify me if they change their address, but...
it's no trouble.
Yeah, I'm not getting any hits.
are you sure about the spelling?
their son's six months old.
can you try searching by age?
Yeah. Only one.
and this boy is not with his birth family.
can I see that?
he's in foster care, pending adoption.
you know what? You're probably right.
this is just a waste of time.
sorry. Thank you.
he's settled with a couple in Carroll County, Marand.
how could Ray Wynne go out and fix up an adoption, just like that?
the state has a Safe Haven law for newborns.
he could've dropped the kid off at any hospital, no questions asked, but after 60 days, the kid's legally abandoned and the parent loses all rights.
but he's the boy's father.
it's a cold world, Doc.
we found the boy.
now what?
now...now it gets tricky.
Dr. Hood?
I've tracked down your son, but I've got to make this quick.
this phone's not secure.
okay.
can Rachel hear me?
she can hear you now.
okay. I want you to meet me at 1515 Hazelwood.
it's the diner where we had the worst pances in the world.
that's it. Let's go.
soon as I have the baby, I'll tell Dr. Hood where to find you.
listen. Listen.
that's a false address.
what do you mean?
hood knows the FBI is listening in.
I don't know where 1515 Hazelwood is.
but I can show you where the diner is.
this place looks like it's been closed for a while.
it's the pancakes.
they probably poisoned someone.
you're okay?
careful, careful.
where is he?
where is he?
he's here.
what is that?
what, you thought I was just gonna snatch him and hand him over? No.
you see them yet?
Yeah, they've gone into a pizza place.
wait. Here they come.
okay, send me video.
don't let them see you. - Okay.
he is there.
and he's watching the people who are looking after your son.
these are live pictures from his phone.
no, they're brand new in the box.
no, man, I heard now's the time to get back into the stock market.
okay, Rachel, keep your eyes open, okay?
keep your eyes open, so you can stay awake.
okay.
we've got a location on Jacob Hood.
what is the point of this?
this doesn't help me.
it's just making it worse!
you're just trying to buy time to talk me out of keeping my son.
Sofia, look at him.
look at him.
he's safe.
he's happy.
and he's loved.
all I'm asking is you just keep him that way until we've sorted this thing out, okay?
can you do that, Sofia?
No! No! He belongs with me.
tell me where he is!
Sofia, I'm asking you, think about what is best for your son!
we made a deal, okay?
you said that I could trust you!
Yes, you can, but we have to get her to a doctor, or she's going to die!
now, give me my phone!
give me my phone!
forgive me.
doc!
we need an ambulance.
she's taken the phone.
where are you going?
I'm tired, Hood.
stay awake.
I'm doing the best I can.
I think it's only five miles into the next town.
in this thing?
more like 500.
we can't complain.
the owner made sure we don't need keys.
told you I should drive every once in a while.
yeah?
you can do this, okay?
if it doesn't work out...
it's not your fault.
you can't fix everything.
just hold on.
can we get some help here, please?
the trouble you have caused me...
I haven't even started.
Oh, I knew you'd have, uh, surveillance all over my phone.
you see that?
that's the son you lied about.
and a DNA test is going to confirm it.
I suppose we should be thankful you didn't just take him down to the river and drown him.
it's over, Ray.
so are you.
little puppies love to run, they wag their tail...
what a lovely baby.
thank you.
do you mind?
not at all.
he's got a little bit of a cold.
he's gonna be okay, though, right?
Oh, yeah. He's strong.
what's his name?
like the Archangel.
Hello, Michael.
Sofia, I think you should come with us.
okay.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Bye, Michael.
thank you.
how's your leg?
I start physical therapy tomorrow.
how's the case?
Wynne's being held without bail while they, uh, work up a case for kicking him out of the FBI.
and Felix tracked down Sofia.
brought her in.
good.
maybe she'll finally get the help she needs.
I mean, you can tell your, uh...
new handler not to get too comfortable.
I mean, I'll be out of here before you know it.
been meaning to speak to you about that.
I've been thinking, and, um, I've decided if you wanted to transfer out...
I wouldn't stop you.
Welce back, Rachel?
I'm serious, Rachel.
you're lucky to be alive.
and if it had gone the other way, I'd find that very hard to deal with.
listen to me, Hood.
I don't want another assignment. All right?
maybe my classmates from Quantico are ahead of me on the ladder.
and maybe I barely remember what my apartment looks like.
but if it was anyone else lying here instead of me, I swear to you,
Really?
besides...
let's face it. You need me.
Mundoli Village India are you my guides?
I'm Eli Stone.
I arranged a trek through the Ranikhet travel agency.
I'm going to the base of the Panch Chuli peaks.
that's a laptop, so you-- you know, you might wanna...
I'll--I'll carry this one myself. Thank you.
I got it. Thanks.
okay hey, it's me Eli.
I've got a lot to say, but I'm a little underdressed for the altitude, so I promise to be brief.
I'm fine. I'm okay.
I'm all right.
I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna walk for a while.
I've been sitting fobve last 30 hos, so...
I'm a lawyer.
I work at Wethersby, Posner & Klein in San Francisco.
unless you own a huge company that's screwed or a little guy, you probably haven't heard of us.
guys?
guys, could-- guys? Guys? Guys, could you-- could you take my picture?
here, uh, this--this-- that light's gonna come on when it's ready to flash.
like I've never used a disposable before?
what do you think-- sunglasses?
no, no sunglasses.
it's gonna be a long week.
let's see-- lawyer, San Francisco...
Oh, did I mention I recently found out I could be a prophet?
Yeah, I was shocked, too.
see, until recently, my belief in a higher power was limited to worshipping the holy trinity of Armani accessories...
and, my personal favorite, ambition.
okay, so maybe I wasn't exactly saintlike.
but I didn't mind that I wasn't the idealistic kid I used to be.
I was too busy being that guy
you know, the guy you see in an office or across the restaurant and you think, "that guy has it all.
hell, I thought I did.
and then I heard the music.
insert caption. Opening paragraph.
defendant beutel pharmaceutical, comma, inc. , I-n-c period, comma, space.
opening paren, hereinafter, quote, beutel, close quote, close paren...
pursuant to rules 26 and 33 of the federal rules
there's an intercom, Brando.
I swear, it's like we work in a cleaners.
do you hear that music? It's been playing all morning.
what music?
there was music playing.
I was wondering maybe you could do something about it.
you want me to do something about music I can't hear?
forget it. Is my 2: 30 here?
they're in the conference room.
also, the fiance? called.
Taylor called? Why didn't you tell me?
you told me not to bother you.
since when does Taylor bother me?
well, all right, I was thinking of me.
okay, from now on, there's a moratorium on discussion concerning my future wife.
that includes e-mails and nasty facial expressions and not telling me when she's on the phone.
you take all the fun out of this job.
$60, 000?
$60, 000?
saying the number twice doesn't double it, you know.
y-you're gonna have to add another zero.
Really? Okay.
let's see...
$60, 000 plus zero equals... $60, 000!
what about $80, 000?
no.
what? I'm--I'M...
what is that, like an organ or something?
m-my cell phone plays "ode to joy," but it's on vibrate.
what, three law degrees, and all you guys can talk about is organ music and ringtones?
look, the only reason I came here today was because I thought Beutel was interested in finally doing the right thing.
ms. Keller, your case was adjudicated by the vaccine court, and they determined our client's vaccine didn't cause your son's autism.
wow, except for "client," "son" and "autism," just about every word in that sentence was wrong.
first, it wasn't your client's vaccine.
it was a preservative in it.
it wasn't a court.
it was a procedural hoop I had to jump through in order to get here.
and they didn't say your client's vaccine didn't cause my son's autism.
they only said I couldn't prove it.
you still can't.
no credible scientist and no reputable study has been able to prove a causal connection between mercuritol and autism.
then why is Beutel the only vaccine manufacturer who still uses it?
you really wanna find out?
lobby Beutel's board to make you the C. E.O.
you've got about as much chance on doing that as you do of winning this at trial.
it would still be a trial, Mr. Dowd.
and even if the jury doesn't believe me, maybe everybody reading about the trial will, and maybe they'll make sure not to use your client's product to vaccinate their kids.
ms. Keller, you know the first thing I learned about litigation?
client's won't know if you pay the bill?
okay, the second thing.
litigation is only about what you can prove in a court of law.
now we can offer you $90, 000.
I sincerely recommend you take it and get on with your life.
$90, 000's good.
Hey, the music. D-do you hear the music? - Yes!
Yes, I hear the music!
no, seriously, there's music playing.
that's who it is!
george Michael? What the hell are you talking about?
his song... uh,"faith.
okay, not to be a prude, Eli, but I've got a deposition at 8: 00 tomorrow morning, so could we forgot the role-playing this one time?
I'm not--I'm not role-playing. It's his--it's his song "faith.
it's been following me around all day.
a song has been following you?
seriously, you don't hear it?
if I say yes, will you come back to bed?
it's coming from the living room.
I'm glad something's coming!
if you build it, he will come.
that's not funny, Nathan.
mm, yeah, I was afraid of that.
uh, it doesn't look good, little brother.
you have conjoined butts in your cranium, which actually, it makes you a double-butthead.
look, aside from the mild concussion you got when your head hit the planter, you are in medical terms what we would call "fine.
I-I can't be fine.
george Michael was in my living room.
there is nothing medically wrong with you. It's just stress.
stress gives you premature grays.
it doesn't make legendary british pop stars sing their greatest hits live from your couch.
this is typical bonehead Eli.
the seco you get your life together, you think of some way to ruin it.
call mom, would you?
what am I supposed to do if George Michael comes back?
get an autograph.
and you say I yell.
that's the number for my acupuncturist-- Dr. Chen in Chinatown.
he's a miracle worker.
my friend Viv-- he cured her tennis elbow and constipation in one visit.
well, good for viv.
but I don't believe in that stuff, so...
for a guy with auditory hallucinations, you sure are judgmentaL.
your 2: 00 is here.
I don't have a 2: 00.
don't speak.
don't say anything. Patti!
don't speak. It'd be an ex parte conversation.
you're represented by counsel.
not anymore.
I fired him this morning.
then have your new attorney contact me.
in the meantime, have a nice day.
Patti can validate your parking.
I realized yesterday the only way I can win this is if I have an attorney who plays at Matt Dowd's level, and I think I found him.
he graduated valedictorian at Stanford law, he clerked for Ginsburg, and he's an eighth-year associate at a blue chip firm.
that's me. You're talking about me.
Why--why you talking about me?
because I want you to take my case, Mr. Stone.
that's impossible.
I-I can't sue my own client.
there's an entire canon of ethics prohibiting it, and I'm pretty sure that they call it a canon 'cause it could kill me.
Blake vs. Elkin, Overmeyer vs. Fordes, - An article in the 2003 "Harvard law review." - You see, this is why the internet is evil.
your firm sets up something called a Chinese wall.
look.
I might be able to squeeze an extra 10 grand out of Beutel.
now that's $100, 000.
that vaccine made my son sick, and it's still on the market.
but... I...
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Oh, well. I had to try...right?
Bye, Eli.
your place is not that easy to locate.
I mean I'm no marketer, but a little signage would do you wonders.
people who need find Dr. Chen.
now "relah." "Cloh" eye.
Oh, relax and close my eyes.
you smart. Must be good lawyer.
you say George Michael have great meaning to you.
uh, I-I say George Michael was in my living room.
he doesn't have great meaning.
Yes. You no remember.
I no remember because he doesn't.
you must make peace George Michael.
maybe I should call his publicist.
Dr. Chen help you remember.
is this your first time?
no, I...
well, h-h-how would you define "first time"?
I thought so.
okay, we need some music.
Oh, my god, Eli.
you have a George Michael album?
what are you doing with a George Michael album?
it's my roommate's. He's in theater.
whoa, I-I-I-I can't lose it to George Michael.
well, we can just make out then.
or it could, you know, make the whole experience more memorable.
you're cute, Eli, in a geeky, late bloomer-ish sort of way.
I've bloomed.
not yet, you haven't, but you will.
by the time you're that lawyer changing the world, you are gonna be hot.
C. L.A.1991.
you were Lizzie then, not Beth.
your hair was straight, and we had sex to George Michael.
it was 15 years ago, but it was you.
my hair was never straight.
I used a flat iron.
why didn't you say something?
cause it was one night, and it's not like you remembered me.
come on, Eli, we were both stoned on pot brownies and we had a random college hookup.
so you just used me for sex and tossed me aside like
like most guys want?
I'm not most guys.
no, you're just most lawyers.
that's not fair.
Hey, Ben?
Ben, this is Eli. Eli's a friend of mommy's.
he's not, uh...
I--I'm not...
yeah...
I was pregnant for 8 years.
sweetie?
can you please say hello?
so you like blocks, huh?
words. There's over 500, 000 in the English language.
wow, that's a lot.
they should collect them all in a book or something.
that's not counting names.
I'm counting them with names.
what is it, Eli?
uh, come by my office tomorrow at 10: 00.
Wh--you're gonna take the case?
no, I'm gonna be getting fired 'cause I'm gonna request to take the case.
Oh, look, I really want you to do this, but not if it's out of pity or sympathy.
it's--it's not sympathy.
uh, there's over 500, 000 words in the English language, and...
that's not counting names.
bear with me, Mr. Stone.
I don't understand.
is there some kind of problem with the case?
no, the case is going great.
the sole exception being that you wish to switch sides.
w-we represent clients with conflicting interests all the time.
is that the Japanese wall you were talking about?
it's Chinese. - Whichever.
in those situations, the clients can pay.
Mr. Stone, are you okay?
I'm fine. Totally fine.
Mr. Dowd, you're atypicay quiet.
Yeah. Sorry, I was just redecorating Stone's office in my head.
ordinarily, we offer quixotic plaintiffs nuisance value to go away.
we did.
stone upped the offer to $90, 000.
$100, 000, actually.
she came by my office.
let me see if I'm understanding this.
you had an ex parte conversation with the plaintiff?
Uhwell, it wouldn't be ex parte if you let me represent her... sir.
explain to me, mr. Stone, the rationale for upsetting a client of Beutel's magnitude on a case which is a complete and utter loser?
well, because, sir...
it'll make us rich.
more rich.
we all know that pro bono work is good for business, and this case, as you so correctly pointed out, Mr. Wethersby, is a complete and utter loser.
therefore, the firm can reap the financial and the public relations windfalls without putting our bottom line at risk.
what is this I hea about the seven horsemen of the apocalypse actually letting you represent that woman?
her name's Beth.
now ask Dan to get me points and authorities on Chinese walls, and...
there it is again. You hear that?
who was it this time, hmm? Cyndi Lauper?
Billy joel? The go-go's?
it's not music. It's, uh...
like a bell, a dinging.
did you possibly fall down a flight of stairs, or did you start taking ecstasy?
maybe you fell down a flight of stairs because you are high on ecstasy.
hold on! Hold on!
come on, Eli! Hurry up!
come on, Eli!
ere was a voice this time.
I'm pretty sure it was my dead father.
dead parent. Different needle.
you don't understand.
my father was an aimless drunk who ruined everything he ever touch.
he's, like, the last person I need to be hearing from right now.
no good hate dead people. Relah.
think good memory father.
Dr. Chen help ungrateful son.
come on, Eli! Hurry up!
Hey, your mom told me about your debate trophy.
sorry I couldn't be there.
because you were drunk again.
here.
a celebration present for winning the tournament.
it's the Panch Chuli Peaks. They're in india.
I always wanted to see them.
we'll go some day.
for Eli, so you'll remember.
remember what?
that you're meant to do great things, that you're gonna go to beautiful places, speak inspired words, that you're gonna help people.
dad, you okay?
Yeah. yeah. Sure, kiddo.
Hey, uh, there's one more stop I gotta make, actually.
tell your mother I'll be home in a little bit.
he barely ever cried or got fussy.
picked himself up at 10 months and walked at 12.
but at 23 months, everything changed
right after I took him for his 2-year checkup and his pediatrician gave him a Beutel pharmaceutical flu shot.
within a week, he was a totally different child.
he went from smiling all the time to not at all.
he used to run around the house like a live wire, and now his idea of playtime is stacking objects in rows.
and when he calls for me, which he hardly ever does...
he calls me Beth.
uh, your honor...
he calls me beth"?
Mr. Stone, please approach.
are you Mr. Stone?
I figured I could hear this.
an overestimation on my part.
now I'm... walking away.
your honor, we both know the only chance I have is for the jurors to identify with my client on an emotional level.
not my problem.
my decision to let you represent the Kellers in the first place should've come wrapped in a box with a ribbon on it.
do you understand?
you're drawing an analogy between your decision and a gift, your honor.
and now I'm walking away.
but, Ms. Keller, isn't a leap to blame a vaccine for Ben's autism?
that vaccine changed my son.
one week, he was happy and healthy, and the next week, he was autistic.
what kind of C. E.O. Would I be-- What kind of human would I be
if I allowed my mpany to use a preservative in its vaccine that caused autism?
well, why not just get rid of the preservative just to be sure?
because then I couldn't market the vaccine at an affordable cost.
look, I'm a parent myself.
and believe me, no level of risk is acceptable.
but there is no risk because there's no connection between mercuritol and autism.
Beth keller said her son became autistic one week after exposure to it.
the truth is, no one knows what causes autism.
and in the absence of an explanation, Ms. Keller has blamed my company and a product that has saved the lives of tens of thousands of children.
we're gonna lose, aren't we?
I'm sorry if by repeatedly telling you how we have no chance of winning I got your hopes up.
maybe Sean was right.
my ex--he said all the money in the world wasn't gonna make Ben better, that I was obsessed with our son's illness and I should give up.
is that why you guys split?
ours wasn't a ad-bearing marriage to begin with.
but after Ben was diagnosed, there was just no way.
I hope I'm interrupting something.
what a nice woman.
cute, too.
is she available?
I'm ignoring you.
what's that?
a "please break off your engagement, I'm begging you" present.
it's an internal Beutel document.
gee, thanks, patti. You shouldn't have.
...suggests a possible correlation "between ercuritol and cognitive dysfunction, including autism.
that is a study.
proving even they thought mercuritol might be dangerous.
Patti, where'd you get this?
a paralegal who works with Matt Dowd.
I lent her my tampons when she ran out.
first, ew.
and second, do you have any idea what you've done?
this--this document's attorney-client privilege.
I can't use it.
I can't even know about it.
I could get fired and disbarred and killed, and not even in that order.
don't whisper-yell at me.
well, don't try to get me fired.
well, you're the genius with the Stanford diploma.
figure something out. God!
so his father and I went outside to find Eli...
naked, covered in feathers and chocolate syrup.
Thanks, mom.
and thank you, too.
Oh, come on. I was 10.
just be glad I couldn't find tar.
that would be my parents.
Eli. Mr. Wethersby-- um...Iordan.
Hello, princess.
Hey, daddy. - Hello.
you're a brave man, Eli.
for getting engaged to the boss' daughter?
that's not bravery. That's stupidity.
I meant taking on the Beutel matter.
I would have to agree, particularly since Beutel's lawyers have been dealing from the bottom of the deck.
if you're referring to the Beutel study, which I suspect you are, be careful.
it's an ethical violation for you to be in possession of it.
well, it was a violation for you not to produce it in the first place, so I guess that makes us even.
in point of fact, I didn't have to produce it.
at least, not after one of my associates stepped forward to take the plaintiff's case, effectively allowing me to seal it behind-- What's it called again?
a Chinese wall?
in any case, that's why I'll be in court tomorrow.
congratulations on the engagement.
it'll be a pleasure to have you in the family.
Eli, stop!
don't! Don't jump!
please, Eli!
don't jump!
look at me!
look at me! Listen! - Just come down, please!
what are you doing? Step down off the railing, Eli!
!Please, Eli! Come down! - Don't!
what you did last night, I realized that I had, uh, I had seen that kind of behavior before.
we both have...
with dad--hallucinations, seeing people, hearing things that aren't there.
just stop me when this doesn't sound familiar.
I don't understand.
what does this all have to do with your father?
well, I'd always associated his episodes with alcohol, but it seems pretty clear there was just no way of knowing it back then.
I took your M. R.I. To our neurology chief, and, um...
he found something.
he found what?
a brain aneurysm.
it's about, uh, 3 millimeters in size.
we wouldn't have found it unless we knew what to look for.
now intracranial aneurysms can be hereditary.
it is not uncommon for them to afflict the same of the brain in a parent and a child.
and in this case, it is in the right cerebral artery.
any disruption of blood flow in this area would account for, uh, delusions of grandeur or hallucinations.
wh-when do you take it out?
because it is located so deep in the cortex, according to the...
chief neurosurgeon, it is not amenable to surgical intervention.
what if it bursts?
it might not.
no, a lot of people live their whole lives with aneurysms, and then they die of perfectly bor
perfectly boring things.
I'm so sorry, Eli.
I'll let you two talk.
well, we should probably move the wedding.
that's not funny.
I don't know if I can do this, Eli.
you know, visions, the odd behavior-- I could take all that.
the idea of losing you at any moment...
are--are you breaking up with me?
cause I-I was just diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, and that would be really bad timing on your part.
I am just trying to process all of this.
Eli, where are you going?
I'm late for court.
the plaintiff recalls Alan Cooke.
what's your child's name, sir? - Objection.
earlier, Mr. Cooke mentioned having a child. He opened the door.
overruled.
your child's name, sir?
did jenna ever receive a flu vaccine?
several, I'm sure.
were any of them manufactured by beutel pharmaceuticals?
Objection! - Objection!
hell, no. Now we're gettin' somewhere.
well, Mr. Cooke?
I believe the choice of vaccine was jenna's peatrician's decision.
Mr. Cooke, do you recognize the man in the glasses who just entered the room?
that's Dr. Varga, Jenna's pediatrician.
or as I prefer to call him, my next witness.
now I'm going to ask you one more time, Mr. Cooke.
to the best of your knowledge, did Jenna ever receive a Beutel vaccine?
no, she did not.
was that at your request, sir?
Yes. It was.
we're prepared to offer $360, 000.
sealed.
no admission of liability.
check by the end of business.
I'm sorry. No.
no what? - No, I don't accept.
I want mercuritol taken out of Beutel's vaccines, and I want them to set up a fund for any other kids it made autistic.
could you guys give us a few minutes?
Beth, what I did in there was a stunt.
Matt's gonna go back in, he's gonna clean up the mess that I made.
now we're down to summations here, and I'd have to give the one of my life and get struck by lightning for us to have a chance.
but I'm not gonna take their bribe.
if you don't take the offer, you're going to nothing. Nothing.
wow, yeah. Okay, you--you're right.
we're gonna lose, but not because of Matt Dowd or Beutel or burdens of proof.
we are gonna lose because when you stand up to give the closing argument, the jury's gonna look in your eyes, and they're gonna see that you don't believe.
for the first time, I feel sorrier for you than I do for me.
come on, Ben.
you always show up no appointment.
Dr. Chen not jiffy lube. Come back friday.
I went to the doctor-- the real kind.
you wouldn't, uh, happen to have any needles for an inoperable brain aneurysm I inherited from my alcoholic father who I've wrongly hated for 20 years?
that totally blows, bro.
what happened to your accent?
long story.
want a beer?
I grew up on a commune.
from there, U.C. Berkeley-- philosophy major.
there's no future in existentialist ethics, so I got into acupuncture.
unfortunately, nobody wants an acupuncturist named Frank Lebakowski.
they want incense, mystique, a foreign accent.
Yeah, they want the Dr. Chen.
that's great--even my treatments were imaginary.
Hey, eight years of coursework in holistic medicine, two years in beijing.
give me some props.
now tell me about this latest vision.
Ah, it's just pointless.
it's all just my defective brain playing tricks on me.
everything has two explanations, Eli-- the scientific and the divine.
it's up to us to choose which one we buy into.
now science explains the enlarged vessel in your head.
but does it explain how the girl you lost your virginity to happened to be suing your law firm?
how her son happen to spell out a message to yo with his blocks?
okay, so what would your divine explanation for all of this be?
almost all religions believe that there are those who are sent to us to help us find our way.
some people call them prophets.
a prophet.
you think I'm a prophet? Like Moses god told Moses he'd send a prophet to every generation.
why not a lawyer-- a high profile attorney handling cases that got a lot of notoriety, that the world would read about?
the difference between those guys and me is I don't believe in god.
sure you do.
you believe in right and wrong.
you believe in justice, in fairness.
and you believe in love.
all those things-- they're god, Eli.
and that...
that's god, too.
the first lawsuit alleging a connection between tobacco and cancer was filed in 1954.
but it took 30 years for a jury to award a single dollar for something we now all accept as patently.
is there proof Mercuritol causes autism? Yes.
is that proof direct or incontrovertible proof? No.
but ask yourself if you've ever believed in anything, in anyone, thought absolute proof.
that's called faith, ladies and gentlemen.
and make no mistake, this is very much a case about faith.
it's about Beth Keller's faith.
she placed her faith in Beutel when she exposed her child to a vaccine Mr. Cooke wouldn't give his own daughter.
she placed her faith in the justice system to hold beutel accountable, and now she's here, putting that same unshakable faith in the 12 of you.
I don't have Beth Keller's faith, but I do believe in some things.
I believe in people.
that's why I became a lawyer.
I believe that most people wanna do what's right.
and the right thing to do here is to remove Mercuritol from Beutel's vaccines.
unfortunately, our verdict...
can't order them to do that.
what you can do is award Beth Kell a judgment so high that Beutel feels it has no other choice.
sadly, without that verdict, I...
don't have faith that Beutel will do what's right.
but I have faith that you will.
how much longer?
uh, juries don't award millions of dollars in five minutes.
so for us, it's the longer the better.
someone came by the office.
mom.
your brother told me everything.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
are you all ght? - I'm fine.
yeah? - Yeah.
apart from the, you know, aneurysm.
I had no idea.
it's horrible to think how much of my life I've spent blaming your father for something that wasn't his fault.
Yeah, me, too.
it sure helps to explain a lot.
that's the coffee can!
where did you get that?
it's your father.
it's his ashes.
you kept dad in a coffee can?
no, of course not. I transported him in the coffee can.
I didn't want to traipse a 10-pound China urn across town.
honey, he wanted you to have this...
him.
in his will, he expressed a desire to be cremated.
he wanted you to have the ashes.
he said that one day, you would know what to do with them.
of course, I thought that was the request of a crazy person, and I didn't want to burden you.
but now...
I'm hoping you'll know what to do with them.
I think I do.
jury's back.
that quick?
mom, I gotta go. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I love you. Okay.
Patti, take my dad back to the office.
I am not gonna even pretend to understand that.
good luck.
you've never wished me luck before.
I never cared whether you won before.
neither did I.
has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, your honor.
in the matter of Beth Keller vs. Beutel pharmaceutical incorporated, as to the claim of product liability, we find in favor of the plaintiff...
and order the defendant to pay damages in the amount of $5. 2 million.
you heard that, too, right?
cause I've been hearing some things lately. - No, I heard it.
okay, we all know what happens next.
we appeal, appeal the appeal, appeal the appeal of the appeal.
basically, run this thing out till little Ben's eligible for social security.
that's a nice try, but Beutel can't risk an appeal because they can't risk the publicity.
speak quickly, Mr. Stone.
$2 mlion to the Kellers, the balance of the judgment gets invested in a fund for autistic children, and Mercuritols removed from Beutel's vaccines, effective immediately write it up.
wait, one more thing.
Eli keeps his job.
he just won a multimillion dollar jury verdict.
we'd be hard-pressed to explain letting him go.
you'll understand if I want your guarantee in writing.
shrewd.
I'll have Mr. Dowd draft it up.
honestly, I-I don't know how to thank you.
well, I think you just did with the "Eli keeps his job" bit.
that was nothing.
you changed our lives.
well, I think I'm gonna be making a few changes to mine, too.
don't be a stranger, okay?
and thank you.
the man of the hour.
it's all over the courthouse.
what, that I'm back on the market?
it wasn't exactly my finest moment at the doctor's office.
but I am sorry, Eli, and I love you.
I love you, too, and I wanna be with you.
but... - But?
I have to go to India.
right this minute, or so that's my story.
it's got sherpas ge michael.
it's got cable cars and prophecies and mystical Chinese doctors...
who aren't really that mystical and aren't really that Chinese.
I have a feeling that's just the beginning.
mom said you spent your whole life with these visions.
I had no idea.
I'm soy, dad.
sorry for blaming you for things that weren't your fault.
most of all, I'm sorry that I'm not the person that you said I'd be.
I'm gonna change that.
I promise.
I gotta call my father okay, guys.
let's go.
worst houseguest ever, by the way.
turns out, it wasn't George Michael at all.
according to my brother Nate, it's because I've got an inoperable brain aneurysm.
it's bad news, right?
well, maybe not.
like anything, it depends who you ask.
you ask an allegedly mystical, allegedly Chinese acupuncturist, it means that I could be some kind of modern day prophet, because, hey, if god wants to send a message out, who else to send but George Michael, right?
now my assistant just thinks I'm crazy, but my friend thinks these visions are a sign that I need to somehow, uh, change my life and start using my legal skills to make the world a better place and blah, blah, blah...
and that's what I promised my dad I'd do 20 years ago, and even though he's been dead for ten of them, there are some promises you have to keep.
anyway, that's what I'm doing with this coffee can.
see, I promised my dead father, with whom I share the same brain aneurysm and potentially prophetic abilities, that I would dispose of his ashes here in the Himalayas, which I did.
now I just want to bring the can home.
mules often use coffee to disguise the scent of the drugs they transport.
Yeah, but I'm not even transporting coffee. See? See?
this doesn't look like coffee to me.
no. No.
that -- that would be my dad.
look, this is crazy.
that guy -- he just got two live chickens through.
suspected contraband can't leave the country.
I'm sorry.
I'm not letting you on the plane with that can.
well, "what's left of dad," looks like this good-bye.
will you do me a favor?
if there really is somebody up there, would you ask him to please just leave me alone for this week?
better yet, just make it a month.
and please, no more visions.
Eli stone's office. Please hold.
Eli stone's office. Please hold.
Oh, baby, I's -- are you okay?
Oh, Stone Eli's office.
Oh, look, just call me back later.
Eli stone's office.
Yes, I know he's supposed to be back today.
no, I don't know where he is, but when he gets here, I've got dibs on killing him.
could you sign for this delivery?
just put it on the desk.
here, I don't think these are gonna fit.
he better have shipped himself back one of those.
Hey, my crates arrived.
what did you do, bring back the great wall of china?
I was in the Himalayas, and my trip was great.
thank you. Don't I get a hug?
you get one at Christmas.
Patti, the grumpier you are, the more I know you missed me.
here. I bought you a gift.
my boss has a nervous breakdown, and all I get is this lousy -- what is this?
that is a saraswati -- the Hindu goddess of wisdom.
how does it work?
do I hit you in the head with it, and then you come back to your senses?
my senses are fine.
they're better than fine.
two blissful song - free weeks, Patti.
I didn't even hear muzak in an elevator.
everything's back to normal, and it's gonna stay that way.
well, does that mean we're done suing the firm and risking our jobs?
Yeah, and even if we weren't, I got a piece of paper saying they can't fire me.
what does the paper say about not firing me?
I thought so.
Eli stone's office. Please hold.
also pleased to announce we'll be acquiring Hutchins, Wheeler & Dittmar as our new London branch.
and welcome back, Mr. Stone, newly returned from his
nervous breakdown.
sabbatical.
thank you. It's good to be back, and, uh, when I say "back," I mean, "back" -- in the fullest sense of the, um...
well, no more suing the firm, basically.
and we're all grateful for that.
next item, United states vs. Solinksy, et al.
sir, I found some precedent in the library that's on point with the United states case
if you're referring to Allston V. Beckridge, that's a second circuit case, not ninth.
anyway, I footnod it in my pretrial memo.
you haven't been assigned this case yet, Mr. Dowd.
that's an encouraging word, that "yet."
yet Mr. Dowd is already very busy with Hanson.
which will be finished by the time Solinsky starts.
whereas another associate might be better rested and coming off a $5. 2 million win.
true enough.
Mr. Stone, the case is yours.
come see me in my office later to share your thoughts on it.
next item, Ramirez, et al vs. Gro Plus farms?
Oh, that's, um, mine, sir. Maggie dekker.
it's a workers' comp claim I brought in.
country's third largest food manufacturer -- how did you manage to retain them?
I haven't.
actually, we'd be representing the worker seeking compensation.
well, unfortunately, or from my perspective, fortunately, it's policy not to allow first year associates to take on new matters, so
I know.
I thought that this case might be in Mr. Stone's particular wheelhouse.
unwinnable cases aren't a wheelhouse.
anyway, I'll be too busy with Solinksy. Pass.
Oh, but I thought
I'll pass. Thanks.
very well.
moving on, I understand we've filed a 12 - b - 6 in dolan.
you got to make it stop. The music -- it's back.
Dr. Chen with patient now.
you get manners. Come back later.
I need to talk to you right now.
sign outside say "in session," not "Eli bother dr. Chen all time."
it's important.
very sorry. This patient impatient.
you sleep five minute.
dude, that is so not cool.
no, not cool is hearing a choir during your monday morning staff meeting.
makes sense.
choral music originated with ambrosian hymnography in the fourth century.
I didn't come here for a theology seminar.
I came here so you could stick me with a needle so that my life can stop providing its own soundtrack.
what was the choir singing?
I don't know, and I don't care.
I was supposed to be done with all this.
I took the case. I won the case.
I took my dad's ashes. I went to the Himalayas.
now it's supposed to be over.
I need it to be over.
it doesn't work that way, Eli.
how does it work then?
well, I don't know.
I never had a patient who could be a prophet before.
stop saying I'm a prophet.
well, okay, but for the record, that's exactly what a prophet might say.
I don't want to be a prophet, okay?
I want to be a lawyer -- a good one, the one I used to be.
now you gonna help me or not?
just chill.
do exactly what you did last time -- follow the signs.
if things get really bad, come see me.
I'll give you a little needle action.
and next time you barge in like that, bro, I'm billing you for the session.
okay.
God.
what is that smell?
it's the candle.
it's, uh, it's made from yak hooves.
it's -- it's supposed to be an aphrodisiac.
or not.
Taylor, it -- it's been two weeks since we
it's been over two weeks.
last time we tried, it was George Michael interrupts.
don't worry. He's doing a concert in the Maldives.
cute, but we both know George Michael was caused by the brain aneurysm we're not talking about.
Yeah, I'm not talking about it with anyone.
I'm trying to keep this thing quiet.
have you had any more episodes?
what, like hearing a choir?
anything.
no. No episodes.
I'm perfectly fine.
if I engage in strenuous physical activity with you without a discussion establishing informed consent,
I could be held civilly, or worse, criminally liable for whatever happens.
you know how it turns me on when you talk all lawyer - like.
even more than yak hooves?
Yeah, a lot more than yak hooves.
what is it?
it's nothing.
it's nothing at all.
Eli, what's going on?
uh, it's nothing.
first George Michael and now a boys' choir?
I'm a little worried about where this might be going.
Yeah, less joking, more doctoring, Nate.
uh, just out of curiosity, what song were they singing?
if you must know, "freedom."
they were singing "freedom."
so you're not being chased by George Michael anymore, just his catalog.
I got a ticking time bomb in my brain, and my brother's making jokes.
not just making jokes.
I'm sending out your case for consults.
I'm trading e-mails with the mayo clinic and the walton center and tiantan puhua, even.
what do they say? - Given the location of the aneurysm, surgery is a bad idea.
well, define "bad."
possible loss of motor skills.
you could end up a vegetable.
I'm assuming my odds go up if someone more competent than you performs the surgery.
not by much.
listen, mom told me about the reason for your Himalaya trip, about dad's ashes.
that was pretty...
stupid of you, Eli.
you shouldn't be doing things like that, given your medical situation.
do you think there could be some, uh, greater significance to me and dad having the same condition?
uh, absolutely.
Yeah, it's called genetics, dumb-ass.
you also have mom's eczema and uncle Gary's terminal lameness.
please stay off of mountaintops.
Yeah, stone. Eli stone.
no, Dr. Chen said -- no, no, I don't have an appointment.
I - I'm trying to make one.
I - I - I'll call you back.
what the hell happened to you?
it's a long story.
um, check to see if anyone saw a biplane flying around downtown today, and, uh, get me a list of all the boys' choirs in Northern California.
and which matter should I bill this time to?
special projects.
special projects.
Oh, like planning your engagement party?
just like that, yes.
well, at least I understand what I'm doing with the party, but choirs and biplanes
why am I doing this?
not quite sure yet.
excuse me, Mr. Stone.
I'm only five years older than you.
stop calling me "Mr. Stone."
I lean on formality when someone doesn't know who I am.
I know who you are.
you're a first year associate.
you said your name in the staff meeting yesterday.
it's Mary.
it's Maggie, actually.
I was kidding.
recognize your name from all the e-mails you sent me about the Gro Plus case.
Yeah. People like you are the reason they invented spam blockers.
well, did you read them?
I skimmed the first one. I deleted the 49 others.
well, here. Try a hard copy.
Oh, does the case get better when it's on paper?
the case is open and shut.
the pesticide Gro Plus uses on its farms made our clients sterile.
first of all, we don't have any clients, so there is no "our."
and secondly, the only illegal alien that a jury sympathizes th is E. T.
and maybe Alf.
being farmhands doesn't automatically make them illegal aliens.
Oscar and Blanca Ramirez came to this country and bought into the American dream wholeheartedly.
which explains the lawsuit.
but it's a legit claim.
there's evidence linking chlorophosphate with female reproductive problems.
look, these people are the tip of a very large iceberg.
half the workers on Gro Plus' farms right now are experiencing health problems, impaired vision, systemic bronchial infections
none of which is relevant to a claim of sterility.
look, you want my advice?
tell our non-clients to quit their jobs and adopt.
you're a gifted trial lawyer, Eli.
your work on the Beutel trial only confirmed that which I've long suspected.
that I have a professional death wish?
that you're a phenomenal talent.
but, yes, your recent behavior has been the cause of some concern.
it's recent, sir, but temporary.
that's what I wanted to hear.
Solinksy is one of the most significant trials this firm has had the good fortune to handle in several years.
well, you're giving it to the right associate, sir.
good.
so... your thought.
uh, firstly, uh, I noticed that you're preparing a motion to strike the time-barred claims.
Yes, Martin Posner's been drafting the brief himself.
I think it's a loser no matter who drafts it.
you're suggesting a motion in limine.
it'll not only be more effective, it'll get filed closer to the start of the trial, so it'll catch the other side off guard.
sir, you should get down.
get what? - Get down!
sir, I can explain.
I'd like that very much.
no, uh, th-there was a -- it's a glare on the building, and it--it--it looked like there w, uh, something flying towards the...
Oh, my god. He's a pilot.
who's a pilot?
um, do you mind if we continue the Solinsky discussion in, say, a week?
a week?
Yeah, there's another case that I have to lose first.
are those for trial, or are you planning a wedding?
Oh, they're my trial binders -- pleadings, precedent, deposition transcripts, and scientific studies color-coded and cross-indexed.
you only got permission from the firm to take the case yesterday.
how did you get all that done since then?
I figured I'd get permission eventually, so I've been working weekends.
you're supposed to work for the firm on the weekends, preferably on cases that aren't dead-bang losers.
for a guy who's coming off a huge win, you don't sound like you have much confidence.
don't mistake a firm grip on reality for lack of confidence.
there are causation problems, proof problems, contributory negligence problems...
you think Gro Plus is gonna say the Ramirezes are to blame for Blanca's sterility?
no, I know that for sure.
so you didn't wear the safety mask provided by Gro Plus.
I didn't have to.
I flew the plane which sprayed the pesticide.
and I'm not the one who was hurt. My wife
object to the answer as non-responsive.
object to the term "hurt."
object to the speculation.
move to strike and ask to instruct the witness.
object to all the objections, your honor.
just get on with it, boys.
what about the safety lectures Gro Plus held?
how many of those did you and your wife attend? - None.
had you attended, is it possible you might have picked up a tip or two about the safety mask?
pass the witness.
what is this, Mr. Ramirez?
it's a bandana.
and what does Gro Plus call it?
a safety mask.
so what does that make the safety lectures, a company-wide knitting circle?
do I even have to object?
move it along, counsel.
Gro Plus only has these lectures to protect themselves.
objection. Speculation.
sustained.
Mr. Ramirez, I think the point is if you and your wife knew that the pesticide you were working with was dangerous, why weren't you more careful?
of course we tried to protect ourselves against the pesticide, but what we should have been protecting ourselves against was Gro Plus.
pass the witness.
all these other supposedly barren, allegedly heartbroken people
why didn't they join in your lawsuit?
because they don't live there legally.
they didn't go to a notario and sign the papers.
they're afraid of deportation.
so all this is just you being charitable, Mr. Ramirez, standing up for the disenfranchised.
that's what people do in America.
they stand up for what is right.
I'm concerned about Eli.
I'm hearing some rumors of erratic behavior on his part.
is he all right?
he's fine.
he tried to tickle me yesterday.
I'm worried about him, sweetheart.
do you know why?
something about a glare.
so...
is everything okay with Eli?
everything's perfectly fine, dad.
yes?
this is regarding the Berkman Antitrust case.
can we take a rain check on lunch?
always.
Bye, dad.
Bye, sweetie.
Hey, Patti.
Eli's not back from court yet, is he?
not yet, no.
he's probably out looking for choirs or biplanes or Huey Lewis.
what?
don't worry about it. Par for the course around here.
what happened? Chip a nail?
your roots starting to grow out again?
look, Patti, I don't know why I've always rubbed you the wrong way, but I know that I do.
it's just, given everything that's happened to Eli, I think we should be uniting.
I'll be the first to admit, Eli's acting like he's been freebasing copier toner, but maybe you're overreacting.
well, if I can't overreact to a brain aneurysm, what can I overreact to, right?
well, that's a good point.
Thanks, Patti.
sure.
no problem.
this is good, right?
first day of trial, he already wants to settle.
we don't know that's what he wants. So...
poker face, okay?
what are you offering?
I mean...
whatever it is, it better be good.
Oh, it's very good.
you dismiss the case...
with prejudice.
And?
no "and."
isn't there usually an "and"?
what my associate means is customarily, the defense will offer a financial incentive for dismissal.
well, in this case, the incentive would be un-financial.
like a lifetime supply of Gro Plus canned goods?
like the possibility of avoiding deportation.
even under the current administration, I doubt homeland security can deport American citizens.
see, now that's the ironic thing.
this morning, Mr. Ramirez testified that he and his wife had both been naturalized by someone called a notario.
now most of these notarios are notorious for not having actually naturalized anybody.
they collect their fee, they have the unwitting clients sign some bogus papers, and at the end of the day, said clients are still about as American as Kim Jong Il.
bottom line, your clients were duped.
even so, it--it will take months before immigration moves on this.
well, interestingly enough, homeland security seems to find a reason to speed these things along when the immigrant in question's a pilot with access to a plane.
your blackmail -- excuse me, offer -- is rejected.
we'll see you in court.
we passed the test.
we answered all the questions.
we were so proud.
we saluted the flag. The notario even had us swear on a bible.
Yeah, he should've been the one to do that, actually.
I would think they would be arresting this man, not deporting us.
Oh, I think they'r gonna be doing both.
but I'm gonna fight the deportation, okay?
problem is, I have to do it right now.
but then who's gonna represent us in the trial?
wait, Eli. I'm no ready for this.
well, I can't be in two courtrooms at the same time.
at least this case you know.
just go in there, make a stupid motion and run out the clock.
stupid motion?
Yes, you should be good at that.
now just wait a minute. I - I almost got it. Now...
they make it so darn difficult for these things to operate.
mm, j--can I?
let the record show that the counselor is good at electronics.
your honor, Oscar and Blanca Ramirez
Oh, w-wait, wait. We haven't heard from immigration and customs yet.
your honor, the respondents are not the wrongdoers here.
they acted in what they thought was compliance with the law.
this morning, I presided over a case in which the defendant thought he was batman.
didn't make it so.
your honor, you can't deport two law-abiding citizens because of someone else's fraud.
a, they're not citizens.
B, they're not law-abiding, or they wouldn't be in the country illegally.
so unless you can show cause why the defendants shouldn't be deported
I can show cause, your honor. - Great!
now would be the time.
I just -- I can't do it this particular minute.
my cause i - isn't here.
I - I need a continuance.
we just started.
48 hours, judge, then I'll be right back here with my cause.
48 hours.
Mrs. Ramirez, tell us how you first learned that you were infertile.
objection.
in the form of a question, counselor.
right, like "jeopardy"!
you and your husband visited a fertility doctor.
d - did you not?
the doctor -- he did some tests, and--and h-he said that it was my fault.
and you blamed the pesticide used on Gro Plus' farm.
is - isn't that right? - Yes.
other women I work with -- they can't have children, and we all work in the fields.
and when we go home, we can smell the chemicals.
they're on our clothes, and we can taste it in our mouths.
where did you meet your husband, Mrs. Ramez?
uh, Gro Plus, on the farm.
so it stands to reason that there was never a time when you and husband were trying to get pregnant before you went to work for Gro Plus.
sorry
I thought I had all of it.
well, Mrs. Ramirez...
isn't it possible you were infertile before you were exposed to the pesticide on the Gro Plus farm?
no, I'm sure that it's not.
then you've tried to get pregnant before?
no, I haven't tried.
so how do you know?
objection, your honor!
to... his tone.
I don't like his tone.
overruled, Ms. Dekker. Continue.
Mrs. Ramirez...
I doubt you'd been to a fertility clinic before you met your husband.
this is your first marriage.
how can you be sure that you weren't infertile before?
I know that I could have babies before.
he doesn't know, does he?
who doesn't know what? I-I mean...objection!
who doesn't know what?
I...
I had a baby before I met Oscar, and...
I gave him up for adoption.
Oscar, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I never told you before.
if you could deceive your own husband, Mrs. Ramirez, then how is this jury to know you're not deceiving them?
What'd I miss?
can I talk yet? - No.
now? - Not yet.
when I left you alone this morning to deal with the fallout from Maggie screw up number one,
I told you to stall, and if the judge told you to stop stalling, I told you to start objecting.
I - I did!
I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry?
before the Ramirezes met you, they were two happily married American citizens.
now they're neither.
okay, deportation aside, this is good for us, isn't it?
I mean, it's evidence that Blanc had no problem conceiving before working for Gro Plus.
it would've been good for us if we knew ahead of time that our allegedly infertile client was a mommy!
now all the jury sees is a liar.
and juries -- they don't like to give money to liars!
she -- she didn't even tell her husband!
how was I expected to know?
you're expected to find out.
now I'm gonna lose two cases.
I just promised the immigration judge proof our clients are legal, which is gonna be a little hard to produce since they're not.
wait, you're yelling at me about malpractice after you lied to a judge?
Wh--I wouldn't have lied to him if you hadn't have got me in this mess in the first place.
there's two kinds of lawyers, Maggie.
there's good lawyers and there's bad lawyers, and a bad lawyer with good intentions is still a bad lawyer.
I may be a bad lawyer, but I'll get better.
you'll always be a jerk.
there's 53 boys choirs in Northern California?
it's gonna take forever.
do me a favor.
find out which ones wear red and white robes.
sure thing, boss.
wait a second.
I know that tone.
what did I do?
you didn't do anything.
you didn't say anything, either.
Patti, I'm having a very bad day here, and that's under the new definition of "bad" that I've been working with lately.
eight years we've been together, Eli.
my daughters call you "uncle."
when my husband left me, when my father passed away, you were the first call I made.
you have a brain aneurysm, and I have to find out about it from Malibu Barbie?
she told you?
she thought I knew.
and for the life of me, I can't figure out why I didn't.
I thought you trusted me.
I do.
I do trust you.
I just -- the more people I tell, the more real it becomes, so I'm...
Eli, I'm not people.
are you going to die?
eventually.
just not anytime soon, I hope.
well, you keep anything else from me, and that's gonna change.
I didn't mean to tell her.
I thought she already knew.
no one else can find out, okay? No one.
if you mean my father, don't worry.
I didn't say anything.
I would never do that to you.
good,'cause I can't lose my job on top of everything else.
they can't fire you for having an aneurysm.
you think I could keep my malpractice insurance with this?
cause no insurance means no license, and no license means no job.
and except for the last 48 hours, I like my job.
what's happened in the last 48 hours?
what difference does it make?
you won't talk about your condition.
you won't talk about work, you're acting erratically, and every time I try to reach out to you to see what's wrong, to see if I can help, you -- you push me away.
I just want things to be normal again.
have they been normal?
or have you...
I don't know -- tried to tackle anyone lately?
that was a misunderstanding, that's all.
Really?
you haven't had any more episodes? Any?
look...
I admit that when we found out about the aneurysm,
I reacted horribly.
but I wanna be there for you now.
I'm ready to be.
why won't you let me?
I know you need to talk about this, but right now I really need to not talk about it.
and since I'm the guy with the aneurysm
you might have the aneurysm, Eli, but you're not the only one who has to live with it.
has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, your honor.
in the matter of Ramirez vs. Gro Plus foods incorporated, we find in favor of the defendant, Gro Plus foods.
how you doing, Oscar?
my wife had another man's baby.
I've had better days.
she got pregnant before she even met you, right after she came to America, I thought.
she left the baby in a church.
she didn't even name him.
are you judging her for that?
no, she -- she was young and scared.
but she wasn't young and she wasn't scared when she decided not to tell me she'd been a mother.
I'll give you the young part, but I - I think she was very scared.
I recently found out some things about myself, and, um...
I had a hard time talking to people about it, particularly the people I'm closest to.
sometimes the -- the closer you are to someone, the harder it is to tell them your secrets.
that doesn't make it right.
no, it doesn't.
it just -- it just makes it human.
you should get some sleep tonight, Mr. Stone.
tomorrow's the big one, huh?
I like this country.
I'd hate to have to leave.
no pressure there, Oscar.
Mr. Stone...
given your proximity, I'm assuming there's something you wanted to say to me.
th -- I love the tie, sir.
I was just wondering the make.
Armani.
is that it, or have you given more thought to our conversation the other day?
I did give it some thought, sir, and I think it needs another day of thought.
I followed the signs, and all it's gotten me is two clients who are gonna get deported and a case I lost.
well, you lost one of them, not the big one.
everybody needs to stop calling tomorrow "the big one."
I'm just saying, maybe you took the pesticide case so you'd be their attorney for the immigration one.
but if this choir is supposed to give me a clue as to how to help them, then god needs to be a little less oblique.
you're not gonna win every case, Eli.
you probably won't win most of them.
I sense another use of the "p" word coming.
most prophets work for social justice but didn't achieve it in their lifetimes.
Oh, that's great.
so when I die, they're gonna win on appeal?
I'm getting the ass end of this arrangement, man.
it could be worse.
you could've spent ten hours hidden in the back of a flatbed truck to come over here and get a job for $3 an hour picking strawberries in the 90-degree sun 12 hours a day.
turns out the pesticide the farm used made you infertile, but that's the least of your worries 'cause that citizenship test you took was a fraud, so they're gonna deport you back to the country you risked everything to leave in the first place.
you know, you may just have written my closing for me.
as soon as I can get this damn thing working, the record will reflect...
the record -- ah.
uh, the, uh, the record will reflect that, um, the respondents are present.
I hope your evidence of citizenship is present as well, counselor.
they're one and the same, your honor.
and if you'll permit me to call Oscar Ramirez to the stand,
I can produce that reason.
you told me you could show cause why the respondent shouldn't be deported.
and I can, your honor.
Mr. Ramirez, how many amendments to the constitution are there?
objection.
you see how easy that was?
your honor, these questions are taken directly from the U. S. C. I. S.'S naturalization exam.
but I'm not administering this test just now, Mr. Stone.
but could you take it?
what are the voting rights amendments?
15, 19, 24 and 26.
the 26th amendment says that no state or government can deny a person of 18 years of age or older the right to vote.
some states could allow younger people to vote
you better start telling me how this is relevant, or you're in contempt.
these questions are our country's only standard of naturalization.
after a candidate has been fingerprinted and photographed, after they've completed a naturalization application and interview, and after they've been sworn under oath.
Yeah, that definitely would've been easier.
instead, they doused themselves with water so they wouldn't dehydrate when they were crammed into a hidden compartment of a pickup truck, and they didn't do it so they could come and pick strawberries.
they did it because they believed in America.
in Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, we're seeing firsthand the seeds of democracy.
they don't grow on every patch of earth.
the freedom we have here is unique.
it's special.
and Oscar and Blanca Ramirez
they were willing to risk their lives for it.
now I'm not saying that citizenship should be a prize for making it over the border, and I'm not saying that illegal immigration isn't a major issue facing this country, but Oscar and Blanca Ramirez are not a policy.
they're people.
and if this truly is the home of the brave, then they're just as American as anyone in this home.
two years? What does that mean?
it means you have two years to complete the naturalization process.
no deportation?
no deportation.
welcome to America.
Oh, thank you. - Thank you.
thank you. - You're welcome.
so do you guys have you plans?
I'm gonna find my son.
no.
we're going to find our son, and we'll start with the church where Blanca left him.
we're hoping they can tell us if he's been adopted.
thank you, Mr. Stone.
thank you, Maggie. - You're welcome.
church. That's it.
Blanca! Wait!
um, this is a list of churches, uh, in Roseville, a town outside Sacramento.
there's one called St. Anthony's.
there's a boys' choir there.
there's about 30 kids.
their vestments are red and white.
you might want to start there.
wh - why do you say that?
it's a very long story, but just trust me on this one, okay?
gracias.
did you lose your other case yet?
lost part, won part, actually.
but it did make me realize that, um, I can't take on Solinsky right now.
so we're back to tilting at windmills again, is that it?
I just think the, uh...
the way I - I play the game -- the gal game
has got to change.
change.
how?
well, for one thing, I can't spend all my time trying cases like Solinsky.
supreme court - bound cases of national notoriety.
I can't spend 70 hours a week making rich people richer.
I just -- I - I need to stay free and--and open and, uh...
like a -- like a tree in the wind and all that eastern stuff, you know?
like a tree in the wind.
I'm sure you think me a cold businessman, Eli
a senior partner who's only interested in the billable hours of one of his senior associates, but my investment in you hasn't just been financial.
and I'm not talking about my daughter.
I hired you.
I mentored you before you even met Taylor.
I didn't assign you Solinsky because you got the better of Matt Dowd in a staff meeting.
I assigned you that case because I've always thought you were the future of this firm
my firm that I've spent over 30 years building, and I thought that's what you wanted, too.
I did, but...
okay, then. I respect that.
personally, I'm gonna be curious to see how you adjust to your new lifestyle.
I'm not sure I follow, sir.
well, Don Quixote gave up nearly all his land so he could afford his books on chivalry.
I'm wondering, Eli, what will you give up?
good night.
good night, Patti. - Night.
we're okay, right?
I'm okay.
you have a hole in your head.
Yeah, let's keep that between ourselves, okay?
it's not Christmas.
do I have you to thank for this?
this is Kali, the Hindu goddess of annihilation.
the Hindus don't have a goddess of malpractice.
but don't worry.
next time we get you into court, you'll do better.
there's gonna be a next time?
only if you don't mind working with a jerk.
I had to leave my coffee can in India.
the can had sentimental value, but, uh,
I couldn't get it through customs.
why are you telling me this?
I'm trying to tell you things...
start telling you things.
the other night, I saw a choir by the couch.
Mm-hmm, boys choir, but I don't think that's relevant.
I tackled your dad because I was getting chased by a biplane.
this is...
it's a lot like your dad.
couldn't have been easy to tell me that.
what? What are you looking at?
just a certain yak hooves candle.
apparently, it's supposed to be an aphrodisiac.
what is it?
um, there's gunfire.
but no singing?
um, nope.
so this is progress.
it begins pretty much the typical way-- boy meets girl.
boy proposes to girl.
boy sees George Michael in his apartment.
boy gets diagnosed with an inoperable brain aneurysm.
you didn't see that coming.
wait, it gets better.
boy meets acupuncturist who's convinced the boy is the 21st centurequivalent of Moses.
but instead of parting seas and smashing tablets, boy must somehow interpret and follow the visions he's having and fix the world one lauit at a time.
needless to say, it's put a bit of a stress on--on, well, everything, but mostly boy's relationship, which is why I'm returning this.
it's a sad story, right?
do you have a receipt, sir?
I told you, I can't find it.
can't you check your records?
either way, you still need proof of purchase.
that'll teach you not to pay retail.
you sure you don't need a ring?
uh, not presently, but when I do, I'll be sure to keep my receipt.
I miss Taylor, Nate.
Ah, it's good to know nothing's changed since you said that five minutes ago.
maybe I did the wrong thing breaking up with her.
allow me to provide some clarity here.
you did you the wrong thing, butt wipe.
if I didn't end it with her, she'd end up miserable, shackled to a crazy person.
and a dweeb, but that is her decision.
get her back before you become even more pathetic than you actually are.
what's that supposed to mean?
Eli, you are, like, the worst bachelor ever.
instead of hooking up with old girlfriends, of which we know there's not many, you break out the microwave popcorn, and you spend your nights in bed watching reruns of TV movies on the we network.
I'm not in bed.
shows how much you know.
look, I gotta get some sleep.
I got rounds in less than six hours.
help me, Stone.
what did you say? - Nothing.
good night, little brother.
help me, Stone help me, Stone.
Oh, no. - Help me, Stone.
help me, Stone. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no!
help me, Stone. Help me, Steve...
help me, Stone.
No! Get back in the TV!
help me.
help me. Please, Stone. Help me.
he came out of the television.
like that creepy chick in "the ring"?
Oh, he didn't climb out exactly.
first he was on TV.
then he appeared in my apartment.
man, everybody comes to your apartment-- George Michael, a boys' choir...
I'm a little insulted I haven't been invited.
I'm not inviting them.
I don't even know who this guy is.
does he look familiar? - No.
how am I supposed to help a guy I've never even met.
take an ad out in the paper? You know, get a police sketch?
this is clearly a w&s kind of vision.
wait and see.
you've categorized my visions?
look at my herb shelf, dude. I'm a little O. C.D. With the labeling.
now beat it. Have to get into character for my 9: 00.
but- - wait and see
Eli is a remarkable young man.
I thought we dropped informality of being diplomatic decades ago, Mason.
well, he certainly made for an eventful engagement party.
Taylor's taste in men has always been a few steps beyond my comprehension.
allow me to enlighten.
she loves Eli because she sees you in him
well, your spirit, your intellect, your ginsu-sharp legal mind.
if I didn't know you any better, I'd say you were buttering me up for something.
well, as it turns out, there is a legal matter we've been handling in-house.
but since the E. E.O. C.has allowed the claim to go forward, it's time for me to retain outside counsel.
the E. E.O. C? What's the claim?
discriminatory hiring practices.
the plaintiff is a young lawyer that we interviewed but ultimately didn't hire
I ultimately didn't hire.
so she goes and files a discrimination claim.
he did, actually.
is he gay?
not as far as I know.
sorry, I don't understand. What's he alging?
racism.
he claims I didn't hire him because he's black.
get away. I'm having a really lousy week.
maybe I can help. My plate's clean.
that's because no one else will work with you.
Oh, come on. What are you working on?
fine. I need restraining order petition.
do you know how to draft one?
Yeah, sure thing. Who are the parties?
I'm seeking the T. R.O. Personally, actually.
Really? Against who?
one Maggie Dekker. That's two k's good morning!
beautiful day, isn't it?
Oh, my god. Someone told you.
I heard from Denise in H. R.
but I confirmed with Larry in the tech department.
I was afraid it was too good to be true!
Larry in the tech partment knows that I broke up with Taylor?
does Jordan know?
I'm not sure, but I'd be happy to tell him myself.
let me try his extension.
Patti, I broke up with Taylor because of my aneusm.
Oh, and I thought your condition was a bad thing. - If you told Jordan that, that would be antithetical to my continued employment at this firm.
you're the only guy who could dump the boss's daughter and be worried about getting fired for something else.
you gotta suss out what Taylor told Jordan.
call her assistant.
or you're seeing Jordan at the staff meeting.
why don't you suss it out for yourself?
Mr. Stone.
morning, sir. Fine.
I mean, I'm fine, sir. How are you?
things could be better.
new matter--we're being retained by Mason Andrews.
the Mason Andrews?
there's only one that I'm aware of.
I need a second chair.
Mr. Stone, you're not volunteering.
I wasn't sure if, uh...
well, I thought under the circumstances...
I'm sure Mr. Andrews would be well-served by such eloquence.
Mr. Stone?
what is it now?
man, I gotta start bringing my camcorder to these meetings.
I think I ate some bad sushi.
it's 10: 00 in the morning.
will you excuse me mifor a nute?
you have to do something.
I am with a patient right now, Eli.
I'm a patient, too.
not right now, you're not.
you have to write me a prescription for sleeping pills, anxiety medication
beg for Taylor's forgiveness and call me in the morning.
Jake, I'm so sorry about that.
Ah, uh, please ignore him, Jake.
this is my little brother who's been attached to my hip since I was 3.
every time I have him removed, he grows back.
it's okay.
nice to meet you.
I'm Jake Mccann.
what's going on with you?
why do you care so much?
the guy just woke up from a coma, for god sakes.
wait, he woke up from a co-- Jake Mccann is coma guy!
you've been treating coma guy!
chen was right. YeahI saw him on "kimmel" and "good morning america."Who is Chen?
doesn't matter. Listen, you have to ask him
no, no, he does not need a lawyer, Eli.
he was in a coma. Comas don't just happen by accident.
well, in this case, they do, you know?
he happened to fall off of his roof while he was cleang out his gutter.
just ask if he has any legal problems.
if he doesn't, I'll leave you and coma guy alone.
if this ends up in a malpractice suit, I'm gonna kill you, tool.
Where's your representation, Mr. Bennett?
I'm pro se.
I didn't spend three years in law school to pay some guy to do what I can do myself for free.
and what's that-- lose spectacularly?
Matt Dowd, right?
didn't you just get spanked for $5 million by a lawyer in your own firm?
let's talk about a trial date.
actually, we don't think you want to take this matter to trial.
it's not in your best interest.
I've never met an opposing counsel who's concerned with my interest.
I'm just trying to save you time and rule 11 sanctions for filing a frivolous claim.
the E. E.O. C.Gave me go-ahead for this trial, so it might be a little less than frivolous.
be that as it may, a suit like this would make you virtually unemployable in this town.
not if I win it.
which you won't.
what are you gonna do, argue Mason Andrews is prejudiced against African-Americans
that he's prejudiced against himself?
not himself or aone in his current zip code.
it's black folks like me he can't stand.
get back to me about a trial date.
seems pleasant enough.
can't imagine why he'd have a hard time finding a job.
what do you mean, you don't understand?
well, if you haven't figured it out yet, honey, you haven't been listening hard enough.
is that Taylor's assistant?
are you really gon do that every me I finish a call?
is it annoying?
you've no idea. - Good.
find out exactly what Tylor told Jordan, and I'll stop.
ask her yourself.
she's standing right behind you.
Taylor. Uh, what are you doing here?
lunch with dad, actually.
how are you, Patti?
better than I've been in quite some time.
I can explain.
you're nervous about what I might tell my dad, so you dispatched your assistant to pump mine for information.
I guess I don't need to explain.
look, I just stopped by to tell you that
I'm going to the apartment on Thursday to pick up my stuff.
I still have my key, so you don't have to be there to let me in.
for what it's worth, I feel awful...
unbelievably awful.
and you broke up with me...
so you can imagine how I feel.
you call at the worst times, Nate.
it's coma guy.
turns out--and I can't believe I'm saying this-- he does need a lawyer.
Mr. Mccann, my associate Maggie Dekker.
pleased to meet you, coma guy-- mr. Coma guy
McCann! Mr. Mccann.
don't mind her. She has tourette's.
no, no, it's--it's okay.
ever since "kimmel," I get it everywhere I go, which is kind of ironic since when I went to sleep,
I had no idea who Kimmel was.
must have been hard on your wife.
Yeah, but, uh, she coped by leaving me for my best friend and business partner.
starting to figure out why you want to hire a lawyer.
I already have, actually.
he said I should just take the 10 million that Brooke and Adam are offering me and walk.
wait. $10 million?
ter I slipped off the roof, Adam took our start-up public, and it tripled in value.
$10 million's a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
I care about my company, what I built, and I want to get it back.
she got it in the divorce, I'm guessing.
Yeah, it was a pretty sweet deal.
Brooke got my company, and Adam got my wife.
how are you not the most bitter man on earth?
well, who says I'm not?
here I am, sitting down with two more lawyers.
one and a half, actually.
the problem is, if the divorce gave Brooke the company, then it's gonna be pretty hard to undo that.
but I was in a coma.
it doesn't matter.
california's a no-fault state, so if Brooke wants a divorce, she gets one.
and even if we could contest it, it would be hard to do since the marriagewas annulled, so...
Oh, god.
it's a good sign when he does that.
if you want to undo the divorce, your best shot is to contest the annulment.
but thateans we'd have to...
Yeah, yeah.
let me see if I have this right, Mr. Stone.
your client wants to regain control of his company, so you're contesting the annulment of his marriage?
it doesn't sound quite as ridiculous when I explain it, your honor.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Mr. Mccann and Mr. Stone are asking the court to insert itself into a church matter.
overturn one, actually, but I'm glad you've been paying attention.
only because I keep waiting for some mention of the separation between church and state.
that still around?
it's hard to tell with the current administration.
funny, but you're gonna have to do better than comedy if you want to convince me not to kick this, Mr. Stone.
your honor, the first amendment doesn't insulate the church from a civil suit, as the recent spate of priestly misconduct cases demonstrates.
Jake mccann has every right to contest the annulment of his marriage.
on what grounds?
there have been no allegations of fraud, impropriety or any other form of misconduct.
depends how you define "misconduct," Miss Halston.
both ecclesiastical and california state law require that both parties be notified of annulment proceings.
my client wasn't.
he was in a coma.
Yes, thank you for reminding me.
not only was my client not notified of the annulment, he was unable to contest it, something he had every right to do under church law.
even if Mr. Mccann was fully conscious, there's no reason to believe the church wouldn't have granted the annulment anyway.
that's what trials are for-- to find out what did or would have happened.
I am not gonna let this go to a full-blown trial on just your say-so.
but I'm not inclined to grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, either.
your honor
I want to hear from the priest who vitiat the marriage.
evidentiary hearing 2: 00 tomorrow.
adjourned.
everything was going great.
in two weeks, I blazed through the screening process.
they sat me down with partners and senior associates.
the only people I didn't meet were the guys in the mailroom.
but then I had lunch with Mason Andrews.
now I was terrified.
this man was my hero, alright?
but the minute I shook his hand, I knew the feeling wasn't mutual.
and so begins the speculation.
it's not speculation. It's experience.
that look that Mason Andrews gave me when we sat down
I've seen that look a million times-- that look that says that I'm less than.
your honor, we didn't realize that mr. Arews gave him the "ls than" look.
move to skip the trial and enter judgment for the plaintiff.
Mr. Dowd, I know you're eager to impress your own boss, but please let Mr. Bennett finish his account.
he cracked a joke about defending some people from my old neighborhood, asked me if I wore my hair this way so that my criminal clients would identify with me more.
then he excused himself, citing a court appearance.
he didn't have one.
I checked the dockets.
the only reason I didn't get hired was the same reason he left that lunch early.
black people like me make black people like Mason Andrews uncomfortable.
what did Mr. Andrews say his problem was with black attorneys?
he'd never state his prejudice outright.
did he ever tell you why you didn't get the job?
no.
so you have no evidence from Mason Andrews' mouth or any of his friends or colleagues that he didn't hire you because of your race?
asked and answered, counsel.
why didn't you apply for a job with my firm, mr. Bennett?
we recruit from the same applicant pool as Andrews worth.
just didn't think it'd be a good fit.
so you made a choice about what firm fits you best, and yet you're suing Mason Andrews' firm for making the same kind of decision.
it's not the same kind of decision.
I beg to differ.
perhaps I should sue you for discrimination.
I did not go through 12 years of catholic school and three yes of law school just to sue god.
we're not suing god.
we're suing the catholic church.
like that distinction's gonna matter when my skin is roasting in the nonconsuming fire of all ernity.
just as long as we're not being dramatic about it.
no, I'm serious, Eli.
look, don't let this rough-edged demeanor fool you.
beneath this tough exterior beats the heart of a girl who still believesn god, prayer and marrying for life.
Eli, Mr. And Mrs. Rivera are here without an appointment.
or an attorney, apparently.
Where's your attorney?
Patti, is it too much to ask you to insulate me from illegal exparte conversations?
this isn't some legal technicality to us, Mr. Stone.
this lawsuit is playing havoc with our lives.
the situation also seems a little inconvenient for Jake.
Jake is my best friend. - Was.
you won't find two people on earth who care about him more than we do.
that kind of sucks for Jake.
what were we supposed to do?
it had been three years, and every doctor, all of them, said that he was never gonna wake up.
you can't blame us for not beinable to see the future, Mr. Stone.
and you can't blame Jake for wanting to get his life back.
his life?
but he doesn't want his life back, Mr. Stone.
he wants ours.
well, Jake disagrees, which is why we're in litigation, and litigation is why we can't continue this conversation.
now please go.
Patti, you're supposed to be my gatekeeper.
you're suing god, and you're telling me what I'm not supposed to do?
I'm not suing god!
speaking of the man upstairs, Jordan would like you in his office...
pronto.
suing god now, are we, Eli?
not the almighty, sir.
uh, just his church.
actually, not an entire church, just a priest.
um, people do that all the time these days.
it's like buying a hybrid.
that's not why I summoned you. Please sit down.
Taylor told me about you breaking off the engagement.
I'm not angry with you, if you're concerned.
I'm not concerned. I...
"panicked" would be more accurate.
I hope I didn't influence your decision in any way.
is that what she
she wasn't forthcoming with specifics.
she's amazing, sir.
and I'm sorry it didn't work out, but, uh...
the reason is...
personal.
if there nothing else? - No.
you can go.
Oh, not again.
I graduated number one in my harvard law school class.
after my first interview,
I overheard the two men I'd just been talking with joking that...
letting a negro into harvard was like teaching a donkey to ice-skate.
that's not being hired because of your race.
is that why you started your own firm?
Yes, and I'm proud to say that my hiring practices are the most diverse in the country.
and these would be the associates you've hired?
well, some of them.
the others had better things to do than to help defend me this afternoon.
nothing further, your honor.
how well do yorecall our lunch that day, mr. Andrews?
well enough.
do you recall asking me about my hair?
Yes, because it seemed unkempt.
do you ever wear a 'fro? Dreads?
how about some cornrows?
objection. I doubt mr. Andrews' hair choice has any relevance.
it has as much relevance as my hair had to do with me not getting the job.
overruled.
do you believe you had to change your appearance any way to fit into the corporate world that you now dominate?
well, of course, but that's not racism. That's common sense.
but you don't believe I made tho changes.
as a business owner, I have a right to make decisions about who I do and do not hire.
that right is protected by law.
provided you don't discriminate.
could the brother in the back stand up again, please?
what's the difference between this gentleman... and me?
well, he's not suing me, for one thing.
that's, uh, that's funny.
uh, any other differences?
well, his experience and his were a better fit for my firm, if that's what you mean.
if I subpoena his law school transcripts, am I likely to find that he was alsoutatorian at one of the leading law schools in the country-- your alma mater?
Mr. Bennett, there's no doubt you're an intelligent man, or you wouldn't have made the lunch in the first place.
so there's no other differences between this black man and me?
are you blind?
which one of us is darker? - Objection!
how about the way we dress?
he's badgering the witness. - He even looks like you.
Mr. Bennett, settle down, or I will hold you in contempt.
the difference is th he doesn't use his race as an excuse for shiftless behavior.
would you care to elaborate on that, sir?
happily.
you showed up at that luncheon with an attitude that I've seen in other black men
as if the rules that apply to the rest of us don't apply to them.
if I am prejudiced against anything, it's that kind of arrogance!
so the day we had lunch, you weren't eating with a harvard grad with stellar recommendations and a 3-for-5 record in the public defender's office.
U were eating with a young, arrogant black punk with an unkempt 'fro.
no wonder you left early.
father hewson, could you please tell the court, what is a marriage in the eyes of the catholic church?
it's a holy sacrament, a lifetime bond between two people before god.
yet here we are, in the presence of two people still living, yet no longer bound in the eyes of the church.
that's what an annulment does.
so this lifetime bond--you can just in a split second erase it?
the process is not that simple.
I'm sure it's not.
for example, I'm surethat some spouses oppose the annulment requested by the other spouse.
Yes, some do.
but Jake Mccann didn't deserve that opportunity?
I nsulted with mr. Mccann's doctors.
every one of them told me he wouldn't wake up.
so I guess what you're saying is, uh, Jake's recovery was a miracle.
Yes, it was.
I guess it's kind of a shame, then, that a priest, of all people, wasn't holding out for such a miracle.
do you think that god's decision to spare mr. Mccann's life was a sign that he wanted him to fulfill his eternal marital obligations to his wife?
I don't presume to question god's plan for any of his faithful.
no.
I guess you just erase the vows they make.
why are you doing this?
I waited for you to wake up, Jake.
three years I waited.
two of them, I barely left the hospital.
"in sickness and in health." Those were the vows, Brooke.
that's easy for you to say. You were asleep.
I was alone.
I needed someone.
and now?
do you still need him now?
I don't believe that you love him the way that you loved me.
I'm so sorry.
what were you thinking at that lunch, Mason?
what was I thinking?
he rolls in in a cheap 5-button zoot suit with bad shoes.
we're sitting at the best table in the derby room.
he greets the waiter like they're homeys on a street corner.
can you see putting him in a room with a corporate client?
only if they wanted to win their case.
I made sacrifices so he could go to harvard, so he'd be considered for a corner office instead of a janitorial job.
but the price is you've got to act, look and dress a certain way.
now I'm sorry if that interferes with his keeping it real, but it's not the way we run things at Andrews worth, and it's not the way you run things either, unless, of course, you've changed your hiring practices lately.
I'm gonna win this case, Mason, because that's what I do for my clients.
but if you want to settle, I'll help you work out a number.
just make sure it's not a guilty conscience that's telling you to make a deal.
my conscience is clear.
we'll go to verdict.
then I'll see you in the morning.
but we're winning.
Yes, the judge will probably vacate the annulment, but...
but I don't think we're winning.
cause what you're trying to win, Jake, you can't get from a lawsuit.
I thought you said I could get my company back this way.
your company, yes.
but not Brooke.
well, I don't care about Brooke anymore.
I don't think that's true.
she loves him, Jake, and she's happy with him.
you want her to be happy, right?
look...
I know a little something about living on borrowed time, and you've already lost five years of your life.
don't spend the rest of it in a courtroom.
it's like I lost her twice, you know?
once when I went into the coma and again when I woke up.
I understand why you're angry.
I just don't think Brooke's the one to be angry at.
okay.
settle it.
so what was that about-- the "borrowed time" thing?
nothing.
nothing?
Maggie, everything's fine.
thought you weren't coming.
thought you decided it'd be better if I did this alone.
I know that you didn't tell your dad about the aneurysm.
thank you.
I love you, Eli.
you haven't figured that out?
I meant it when I said yes.
and I meant it when I asked.
seems like a long time ago.
three months.
I, uh, tried to return this.
they wouldn't take it back.
no receipt.
it seems like diamonds really are forever, huh?
just like you to make a major purchase without getting a receipt.
I didn't think I'd be taking it back.
it's funny.
I thought it might be a sign.
what does that mean?
you were so sure that breaking things off was the right thing to do.
the guy I'm representing was in a coma for five years.
we're talking about work now?
they told his wife he would never wake up.
so she left him.
and it's hard to blame her.
it was a freak acciden when they got married, she didn't know he would go into a coma and their lives would be ripped apart.
you know what could happen to me, and...
and you still want to stay.
that's what I've been telling you all along.
I ruined our engagement party.
your father hates me.
why would you think either of those two things would matter to me more than you?
what does this mean?
I don't know.
I guess we should probably talk about last night.
help me. Help me.
I am. I'm gonna settle the case first thing this morning.
I promise.
there's--There's no need to be on my floor.
help me, Stone.
there's something wrong with him.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. The guy just woke up from a 5-year coma.
he's a freak of nature.
no, medically wrong.
I think you should check him out again.
and what test would you recommend, dr. Stone?
I was thinking an M. R.I.Maybe?
and I was kidding!
okay, he's had, like, 50 M. R.I. S in as many days, not to mention constant monitoring and more meds than I would care to count.
believe me, if the was something to catch, we could have caught it by now.
in the past few days, I've been very, very close to him.
he's practically been following me home.
well, yeah, yeah, of course you feel close to him.
Yeah, it's a sympathetic transference.
you have a neurological condition.
he's suffered a neurological trauma
that's not it. That's not it.
I'm telling you, I know there's something wrong, Nate.
how, Eli?
how do you know that?
I just do.
it's bad enoug that you convinced him to go to court.
and now you want to subject him to more tests, which will cost him time and thousands of dollars, on a hunch?
I won't do it, Eli.
I'll talk to you later. I've got patients.
my first week as a public defender, I went in for an arraignment, and while I was waiting, an A. D.A. Approached me and told me the gallery I was sitting in was reserved for attorneys, nodefendants.
Yeah.
when I told him I was lawyer, he got this...this look...
on his face.
it was the same look Mason Andrews gave me when I first met him, and the A. D.A. was white.
Mason Andrews is black, but the attitudes and assumptions
exactly the same I'm sure many of you are thinking, "black on black prejudice? "That's ridiculous. It's impossible.
wasn't all that long ago they would have said the same thing about interracial marriage or desegregation.
maybe the most telling measure of the strides we've made is the fact that today a black man can rise to a level where he can actually practice...
discrimination...
even if it is against another black man.
Mason Andrews lived through the challenges of segregation on his way to harvard law school...
became a pillar in the local african-american community and a famed advocate for civil rights.
does that sound like a racist of any stripe?
there's a difference, ladies and gentlemen, between discrimination...and discretion.
all mason andrews did was exercise his legal right not to hire someone he didn't like.
now we all witnessed, Mason Andrews' dislike of mr. Bennett is steeped in their shared racial heritage.
I would even go so far as to admit mr. Andrews rbors some resentment of young black men like Keith Bennett.
but resentment isn't rism.
and if you have any doubt of that, ask yourselves, if these two men were white...
would we even be here today?
Where's Adam?
he didn't want to be here.
Jake's agreed to the settlement terms.
you and Adam will retain control of the company.
I got the, uh, execution drafts right here.
all signed.
I guess, uh...I guess we're done.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
thank you.
for what it's worth...
I'm glad you and Adam found each other.
I hope you have a good life.
I want you to.
that's the man I fell in love with.
Jake! Call 9-1-1!
help me, Stone.
are you alright?
what was it? I thought he was okay.
he was. He...he...
he had an acute M. I...heart attack.
you know, his heart could have been compromised by the coma...
but there weren't any signs.
it's...
it's like it just...stopped.
are you okay?
I mean, like you said, there weren't any signs.
there's nothing you could've-- - just...go.
all righ has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, your honor.
in the matter of Bennt vs. Andrews, we the jury find no basis for the charge of racial discrimination under the current guidelines of the equal employment opportunity commission.
therefore, we find for the defendant, Mason Andrews.
as no counter claim was brought by the defendant, there will be no damages assessed in this case.
court is now adjourned.
Mason...congratulations.
well, thank you.
I guess you were right, not allowing me to settle.
lunch at the club next week?
I'll call you.
Mr. Bennett?
congratulations on the win.
you didn't have the law.
no, but I had the facts.
some facts, but not proof.
I was wrong before when I said no firm would hire you.
what, you're looking for more black lawyers over there?
no. I need more great lawyers.
I can't believe you talked to Eli.
you promised you wouldn't intervene in my relationship.
he works for me, Taylor.
I promised not to intervene.
I didn't promise not to speak to him.
I'm a lawyer. I look for loopholes.
but you can't...
our relationship is still...
it's still complicated, okay?
you can't go around bullying him into staying with me.
I have not done, and have no plans to do, any such thing, nor do I feel the need to.
what does that mean?
I think Eli is more than a little conflicted about his decision, as any sane man would be.
I think so, too.
but, Taylor, it's equally obvious that he's in a state of...confusion.
I don't want to see you get hurt.
you taught me to fight for the things I care about.
I care about Eli.
and I know what I wanna do.
are you Eli Stone...
ass-hat at law how much did you drink?
I'm...I'm not sure.
but when the bartender asks you for your keys back, you gotta figure that's not a good sign.
or a good sign, depending...
I cabbed it over.
you gonna be okay?
Ah, it's not like Jake was the first patient I ever lost, although that doesn't make it suck any less, you know?
there's nothing you could've done, Nate.
you couldn't have seen it coming.
I know I couldn't.
so how did you?
the reason I came to you, and I asked you to do something about Jake was...
I knew he was gonna die.
you mean, you saw the future?
are you sure you're not the one who's been drinking?
you know I've been seeing things lately.
well, I'm starting to think that they're not just ause of my aneurysm.
I think they may have some greater significance.
Eli, look, it is only natural that you would want to place your diagnosis
no, Nathan.
something's happening to me...
and it's how I knew Jake needed medical help.
he started singin' "good love."
you know those lyrics?
I was feeling so bad.
I asked my family doctor just what I had.
that you.
that's why every time I saw him, he was dressed as a patient.
I was supposed to get you to help him.
Oh, my god.
I know you don't believe me.
I sure woudln't, but, uh...
I had to tell someone else, someone closto me.
when dad died, I...I put a cassette in his coffin.
it was of a song that he, uh, he kept singing.
when he took me upstate for that fishing trip...
he...he just kept singing it over and over.
I hate fishing, and he was the worst singer in the world.
but, um, that trip was...
it was really special me.
the song on the cassette was "good love'" by the rascals.
nobody else knew aut that.
it's crazy, huh?
Yes, just a little bit.
I need a drink-- more to...drink.
well, I'm out of bourbon.
you had enough, dude.
but, uh, I do have some microwave popcorn.
okay.
and you know what?
there's a rerun of "working girl" on the we channel.
dude, you have got to get back together with Taylor.
ALL-AR CATCHER JAYSON TURK HIT A FOUL BALL
which STRUCK HIS COACH IN THE HEAD... FATALLY.
they GOT HIS OWN WIFE TESTIFYING AGAINST HIM.
I THOUGHT WIVES COULDN'T TESTIFY AGAINST THEIR HUSBANDS.
get DOWN!
you KNOW I'VE BEEN SEEING THINGS LATELY.
I'm STARTING TO THINK THAT THEY'RE 'CAUSE OF MY ANEURYSM.
maybe I DID THE WRONG THING, BREAKING UP WITH HER.
our CLIENT FEELS HE NEEDS A HIGH-PROFILE ATTORNEY. LIKE IT OR NOT, - ELI'S PROFILE-- KEEPS - GETTING HIGHER.
Taylor, YOU'LL STAY ON AS CO-COUNSEL.
what?
it's LIKE I SEE THINGS NOW-- THINGS THAT WERE ALWAYS THERE
today WILL BE A GOOD DAY.
I CAN SEE THE DAY BEING A GOOD DAY...
very GOOD DAY.
see IT. BELIEVE IT. ACHIEVE IT.
there WILL BE NO GEORGE MICHAEL SONGS.
there WILL BE NO WORLD WAR II BATTLEFIELDS.
fire-breathing DRAGONS WILL NOT TAKE UP RESIDENCE IN MY CLOS.
Ow!
Oh, MY GOD!
not THE PLASMA!
Earthquake! EARTHQUAKE!
nice DUCK.
not IN THE MOOD, ELI.
come ON, PATTI. AN EARTHQUAKE HITS.
you ONLY HAVE TIME TO SAVE ONE THING. WHAT DO YOU PICK?
a HEAVY, BLUNT OBJECT TO HIT YOU WITH.
now I KNOW BETTER THAN TO EXPECT WARM CUDDLIES FROM YOU,
Really? AND WHAT CHANGED A WEEK AGO, I WONDER.
is THIS ABOUT SOLINSKY?
it's ABOUT YOU REPRESENTING THAT SCUM-SUCKING LIZARD.
well, IF IT BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?
like WHAT? THAT YOU'RE LOWER TO BE HIS LAWYER?
come ON. HE'S JUST A DEVELOPER.
he's DEVELOPING MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY
straight OUT OF THEIR HOMES. WHY?
well, SO HE CAN GENTRIFY BY BUILDING HIGH-RISE CONDOS AROUND A RETAIL DESTINATION.
you MEAN SHOPPING MALLS
a MALL WHERE RICH, WHITE PEOPLE RIDE LITTLE TROLLEYS FROM POTTERY BARN TO BARNES & NOBLE
so THEIR RICH, WHITE FEET DON'T GET TIRED.
I MADE A DEAL WITH JORDAN.
I TAKE THE CASE, I GET YOU BACK AS MY ASSISTANT.
Oh, I MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU?
Yes, YOU DO.
then YOU SHOULDN'T BE HELPING SOMEBODY BULLDOZE MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD!
Hey.
what's GOING ON? - UM, LET'S SEE.
ANOTHERCELEBUTANTE GOT PHOTOGRAPHED GETTING OUT OF HER CAR WITHOUT HER PANTIES ON, - AND I THINK WE'RE STILL IN IRAQ-- - NO, I MEAN WITH YOU.
you've BEEN ACTING WEIRD ALL WEEK, AND...
I MEAN, WEIRD FOR YOU, WHICH IS WEIRD.
I'm FINE, BUT THANKS FOR YOUR SHOW OF GENTLE CONCERN.
you've BEEN AVOIDING ME.
we're TALKING TO EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW,
so I GUESS I'M NOT REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT.
Maggie, YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
Shh!
why DON'T YOU JUST PUT IT ON A BILLBOARD?
look, FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT ACTING STRANGE OR WEIRD SINCE...
the THING. - "THE THING"?
second OF ALL, I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE THING.
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
okay, GREAT, 'CAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE UPSET.
I'm FINE. I'M JUST
Oh, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU BEFORE WE MET WITH SOLINSKY,
but IT LOOKS LIKE I'M INTERRUPTING SOMETHING.
no, YOU'RE INTERRUPTING NOTHING. - NO, NOTHING.
let's go.
has THE JURY REACHED A VERDICT?
we HAVE, YOUR HONOR.
we, THE JURY IN THE ABOVE ENTITLED ACTION,
on THE CHARGE OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE,
find THE DEFENDANT JAYSON CHRISTOPHER TURK
not GUILTY.
what HAPPENS NEXT?
in REAL LIFE? - IN REAL LIFE,
you'd BE FOUND NOT GUILTY BY TEMPORARY INSANITY.
diminished CAPACITY DEFENSE AS A RESULT OF YOUR STEROID USE,
and YOU DO PROBATION FOR A YEAR.
what ABOUT THE LEAGUE?
could GO EITHER WAY, BUT YOU'RE THE BEST CATCHER IN THE GAME.
hall OF FAME, THOUGH? - I'M--I'M SORRY.
you're THINKING ABOUT THE HALL OF FAME?
hell, YEAH,
I've DEDICATED MY LIFE TO THAT, AND YOU GUYS HAVE GOT ME SAYING I'M A JUICER.
because THAT'S THE MOST
this CASE, MR. TURK, AS THESE MOCK TRIALS HAVE PROVED.
I'm GOING ON TRIAL FOR MURDER TOMORROW.
which IS PRECISELY WHY
and YOUR CLIENT'S WORRIED THAT THE CURE MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE.
there's NOTHING WORSE THAN MAXIMUM SECURITY FOR 25 TO LIFE.
nobody CARES ABOUT YOUR HALL OF FAME STATUS
when IT'S LIGHTS OUT ON CELLBLOCK "B.
you WITH THEM ON THIS?
Yeah.
because YOU DON'T HAVE... ANY OTHER OPTIONS.
this DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DIFFICULT.
of COURSE NOT.
we're TWO ADULTS WHO HAD A RELATIONSHIP
which IS NOW OVER BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT.
no BETRAYAL, NO RECRIMINATION,
no ALIENATION OF AFFECTION.
just AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT...
that IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE WERE APART.
except FOR THE FACT THAT SOLINSKY AND YOUR FATHER
are MAKING US WORK TOGETHER.
did YOU REVIEW THE CITY COUNCIL TRANSCRIPTS?
Yeah. THEY APPROVED THE TAKING OF SILVER TERRACE BY EMINENT DOMAIN.
unanimous. TAYLOR, DO YOU FEEL THAT?
I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE UNDER MY FEET I FEEL THE SKY TUMBLIN' DOWN...
no, YOU DON'T.
I FEEL MY HEART START TO TREMBLIN' WHENEVER YOU'RE AROUND...
Ooh, DARLIN' WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME AND YOU TENDERLY CALL MY NAME - I NEVER DID THAT. I KNOW THAT MY EMOTIONS ARE SOMETHING I JUST CAN'T TAME I JUST GOT TO HAVE YOU, BABY UH, UH, UH YEAH...
I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE UNDER MY FEET I FEEL THE SKY TUMBLIN' DOWN TUMBLIN' DOWN I JUST LOSE CONTROL
do I FEEL WHAT, ELI?
how... GREAT US WORKING TOGETHER IS GONNA BE.
literally.
as IF I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS,
now I'M GETTING SERENADED BY MY EX AND MAGGIE.
last TIME I CHECKED, TWO SERIOUSLY HOT WOMEN SINGING TO YOU? NOT REALLY A PROBLEM, DUDE.
it IS IF YOU WORK WITH BOTH OF THEM.
though I MUST SAY, THEIR SINGING WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD.
the LOVE TRIANGLE PORTION OF THE VISION
you CAN FIGURE OUT WITH YOUR THERAPIST.
now LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE RECURRING EARTHQUAKES.
it's EASY.
for THE PAST THREE MONTHS, MY LIFE'S BEEN FALLING APART.
now EVERYTHING ELSE IS FALLING APART, TOO.
your VISIONS AREN'T JUST
in NORSE MYTHOLOGY,
earthquakes ARE THE RESULT OF LOKI'S PUNISHMENT.
have YOU DONE ANYTHING LATELY YOU SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR?
well, I'M BACK ON THE SIDE OF EVIL THIS WEEK.
I'm REPRESENTING A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER WHO'S TEARING DOWN SILVER TERRACE.
Solinsky? THAT GUY'S A PIG.
well, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M ALREADY GETTING AN EARFUL FROM PATTI.
lie DOWN.
is IT NEEDLE TIME? - I LOVE NEEDLE TIME.
you're NEVER ALLOWED TO CALL IT "NEEDLEIME" AGAIN.
now I SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP YOU RELIVE YOUR EARTHQUAKE VISION,
like UNDER HYPNOSIS.
maybe YOU COULD NOTICE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS.
if NOT, I JUST CLEAR YOUR SINUSES.
maybe I COULD SAVE THE PLASMA.
Ow!
God! OH, MY GOD!
the PLASMA!
Yeah!
...SPECIAL REPORT.
the BAY AREA IS EXPERIENCING A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE MEASURING 6. 5 ON THE RICHTER SCALE.
the EPICENTER OF THE QUAKE IS LOCATED IN SILVER TERRACE.
of COURSE WE'LL HAVE...
there WAS A NEWS REPORT.
silver TERRACE GETS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE.
did IT SAY WHEN?
no, JUST THAT IT'S THE EPICENTER OF A 6. 5.
so IF YOU LOSE THIS CASE...
those PEOPLE COULD DIE.
call SOLINSKY. TELL HIM I WANT TO MEET WITH HIM RIGHT AWAY.
then GET JEFFREY POWELL. TELL HIM I WANT TO NEGOTIATE
a SETTLEMENT ON THE SILVER TERRACE CASE.
I'm GONNA MAKE THIS RIGHT, PATTI.
are YOU STILL REPRESENTING
Yes.
Yes, BUT
so BY "MAKE THIS RIGHT," YOU MEAN
you DO THE SAME EXACT THING YOU WERE DOING BEFORE
but WITH GREATER URGENCY?
Yes, BUT
no. MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN CALLS.
we NEED TO TALK.
we've ALREADY TALKED.
no. WE DIDN'T TALK TALK.
we TALK TALKED ENOUGH FOR ME.
so CAN I PLEASE GO BACK TO AVOIDING YOU
and PRETENDING LIKE I'M NOT?
look, EITHER YOU'RE A CLOSET CAROLE KING FAN
or YOU HAVE A THING FOR ME.
who's CAROLE KING?
so YOU DON'T...
you DON'T HAVE A CRUSH ON ME?
not BEFORE, BUT THAT KIND OF MODESTY IS SUCH A TURN-ON.
fine. I'M WRONG.
since MY DIAGNOSIS, MY LIFE'S GOTTEN REALLY MPLICATED,
and I CAN'T DEAL WITH ANY MORE COMPLICATIONS.
we WORK TOGETHER.
um, YOU REPORT TO ME. NOTHING...
romantic COULD EVER HAPPEN BETWEEN US.
you KNOW THAT, RIGHT? - YEAH. OF--OF COURSE I DO.
Eli? UM, YOU CAME BY MY OFFICE?
SHE--HER KEYBOARD JAMMED.
Jayson TURK COMMITTED A CRIME...
intentionally.
with MALICE AFORETHOUGHT, HE KILLED ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
in FRONT OF 30, 000 FANS AND HUNDREDS OF CAMERAS?
does THAT SOUND REASONABLE?
or DOES IT SOUND LIKE A MAN WHO'S IN AN ALTERED STATE
and OUT OF HIS MIND?
he WASN'T OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN HE USED STEROIDS TO BULK UP TO 245 POUNDS OF SOLID MUSCLE.
those SAME STEROIDS ALTERED HIS MENTAL STATE,
rendering HIM TEMPORARILY...
insane? PLEASE, LET'S JUST CALL THIS WHAT IT IS
another EXCUSE TO LET JAYSON TURK GET AWAY WITH CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.
celebrities...
celebrities ARE NO MORE ENTITLED TO BREAK THE LAW...
are NO LESS DESERVING OF THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE...
than YOU OR ME.
and WHILE STEROID USE IS AGAINST THE LAW,
Jayson TURK ISN'T BEING PROSECUTED FOR THAT.
he's ON TRIAL FOR MURDER,
and ON THAT CHARGE, HE IS INNOCENT.
Mr. SOLINSKY, $20 MILLION WILL MAKE THIS LAWSUIT DISAPPEAR.
I'm STILL TRYING TO WRAP MY BRAIN AROUND THE IDEA
that THE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN EVEN SUE ME.
and NOW YOU WANT ME TO SETTLE?
settling MEANS WHICH COULD DELAY THE START OF CONSTRUCTION
or IN THIS CASE, DESTRUCTION-- FOR A MONTH.
the CITY IS ALREADY PAYING
and I'M SUGGESTING YOU PAY THEM A LITTLE MORE
so THEY DROP THEIR SUIT AND MOVE OUT IMMEDIATELY.
the TRUTH IS, ARVIN,
the PROS AND CONS OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE TRIAL.
the CON WOULD BE THAT I PAY THE DENIZENS OF SILVER TERRACE $20 MILLION OUT OF MY OWN POCKET.
I'm NOT REALLY SEEING THE PRO.
well, DOING THE RIGHT THING.
the RIGHT THING? I'M TURNING AN URBAN BLIGHT
into A CLEAN, SAFE PLACE.
the CITIZENS WHO LIVE THERE NOW WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PARK THERE IN A YEAR.
I'm REALLY SORRY, BUT THIS IS HOW SILVER TERRACE'S LAWYER,
jeffrey POWELL, IS GONNA PAINT YOU.
right NOW PEOPLE STILL THINK YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,
which I'M SURE IS TRUE, ARV, BUT
this TRIAL WILL BE VERY BAD FOR THAT PERCEPTION.
you DON'T LOOK THAT HAPPY.
it's NOT EXACTLY AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT.
it's THREE TIMES WHAT THE CITY ALREADY PAID THEM, JEFF.
which WASN'T VERY MUCH TO BEGIN WITH.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT . Powell HAS PROMISED YOU,
but ARE YOU WILLING TO BET $20 MILLION THAT HE'S RIGHT?
we'd GET THIS MONEY ON TOP OF WHAT THE CITY ALREADY PAID US?
those CHECKS CAN'T COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF THE HOMES
you RAISED YOUR CHILDREN IN,
that YOU RAISED YOUR GRANDCHILDREN IN.
the CITY SAYS IT CAN TAKE AWAY YOUR COMMUNITY
because THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS LOST.
take THIS MONEY, AND YOU'RE AGREEING WITH 'EM.
I THINK YOU CAN TELL YOUR CLIENT HIS OFFER IS REJECTED.
what WERE YOU DOING BACK THERE?
just TRYING TO UNDO POWELL'S "POWER TO THE PEOPLE" BRAINWASHING.
arvin SOLINSKY, PLEASE.
and WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?
um, I THINK I CAN GET THEM TO TAKE $25 MILLION.
it's ELI STONE CALLING.
or IT WAS. THAT WAS ME MAKING A CALL TO ARVIN.
to OUR CLIENT TO GET HIM TO PUT UP ANOTHER $5 MILLION.
he CAN COVER I OUT OF PETTY CASH.
do YOU KNOW IT'S MALPRACTICE TO SHOVE A SETTLEMENT DOWN HIS THROAT?
what IS GOING ON WITH YOU? WE CAN WIN THIS AT TRIAL.
a TRIAL WILL TAKE TOO LONG. - SOLINSKY CAN WAIT.
I CAN'T. THEY CAN'T.
Eli, WHAT IS HAPPENING?
whatever IT IS, YOU CAN TELL ME.
my VISIONS...
they GUIDE ME.
they TELL ME WHAT KINDS OF CASES I SHOULD TAKE
or WHAT I SHOULD DO.
Eli, THAT'S CRAZY, YEAH, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
I SAW MYSELF TAKE MY DAD'S ASHES TO INDIA.
I SAW JAKE McCANN DIE LAST MONTH BEFORE IT HAPPENED.
and TWO DAYS AGO,
I SAW SILVER TERRACE GET DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE.
if WE DON'T GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF HERE
Eli, THESE THINGS YOU'RE SEEING ARE SYMPTOMS OF YOUR ANEURYSM.
I WISH THEY WERE. - YOU NEED TO GET HELP.
that's NOT THE KIND OF HELP I NEED RIGHT NOW.
Jayson AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR FIVE YEARS.
obviously, THOUGH, IT WASN'T A PERFECT MARRIAGE.
no. THERE HAVE BEEN INFIDELITIES ON BOTH SIDES.
JAON HAD HIS BASEBALL GROUPIES IN I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CIES.
and FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS,
I HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH JOHN QUESADA,
his THIRD BASE COACH.
why DO YOU BELIEVE YOUR HUSBAND MURDERED JOHN QUESADA?
sidebar, JUDGE?
he's TRYING TO ELICIT TESTIMONY FROM MRS. TURK
that THE DEFENDANT THREATENED THE VICTIM'S LIFE.
I THINK MR. SWEREN NEEDS TO BE REMINDED THAT
what's SAID BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND WIFE IS PRIVILEGED.
no, I'M GOOD, THANKS.
Mrs. TURK CAN SPEAK TO MR. TURK'S CHARACTER AND CAPACITY FOR MURDER.
agreed. OBJECTION OVERRULED. STEP BACK.
Mrs. TURK, CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THE JURY
why YOU THINK HE COMMITTED MURDER?
Jayson IS A JEALOUS MAN. HE'S POSSESSIVE AND INSECURE.
he WON'T EVEN PERMIT ME TO HAVE MALE FRIENDS.
was HE THIS WAY
Yes. IT IS WHO THE MAN IS.
did JAYSON EVER RAISE A HAND TO YOU?
no. - HOW ABOUT FISTFIGHTS, BARROOM
brawls, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
no. JEALOUSY IS JAYSON'S HOT BUTTON.
you ALSO HAD AFFAIRS WITH GERRIT WILSON, JIM WACKER.
where MIGHT THOSE MEN BE BURIED?
they ARE STILL ALIVE.
maybe THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAD THOSE AFFAIRS
before JAYSON STARTED USING STEROIDS.
for WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I'm SORRY I SPRUNG THIS ON YOU RIGHT BEFORE TRIAL.
moving FORWARD, I'M GOING TO INSIST THAT
any FURTHER CHANGES IN STRATEGY BE RUN THROUGH ME FIRST.
I'm NOT CRAZY, TAYLOR.
Ahem.
Patti, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
my CIVIC DUTY.
Powell SUBPOENAED YOU?
Yep. HE THINKS I'LL MAKE A VERY CONVINCING WITNESS,
and I ND TO AGREE.
no ONE HAD A LOT,
but WHAT WE HAD, WE SHARED.
if YOU WERE SHORT ON GROCERY MONEY, THE CHURCH HELPED OUT.
if YOUR GAS WAS GONNA BE CUT OFF,
neighbors CHIPPED IN TO PAY THE BILLS.
that SPIRIT IS STILL THERE.
you JUST HAVE TO LOOK PAST THE PEELING PAINT.
OBJECTION--RELEVANCE. - THE CITY EXERCISED EMINENT DOMAIN
because IT DESIGNATED SILVER TERRACE A "BLIGHT.
I'm EXPLORING THE VERACITY OF THAT DETERMINATION.
objection OVERRULED. - BACK TO THE PEELING PAINT
what DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?
I MEAN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS ITS PROBLEMS,
but IT'S STILL A LONG WAY FROM BEING WRITTEN OFF FOR DEAD.
thank YOU, MS. DELLACROIX.
PAT...MISS DELLACROIX, UNDER THE LAW, "BLIGHTED" HAS A SPECIFIC LEGAL MEANING.
do YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
OBJECTION--CONDESCENDING.
it WAS NOT! - I'VE BEEN A LEGAL SECRETARY
ever SINCE YOU WERE AN ITCH IN YOUR DADDY'S PANTS.
I KNOW AN OBJECTIONAE QUESTION WHEN I HEAR ONE.
ms. DELLACROIX, COULD WE LEAVE THE OBJECTING
to MR. POWELL, PLEASE?
of COURSE. I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR.
how WOULD YOU COMPARE THE SILVER TERRACE
OBJECTION--SPECULATIVE!
I COULD NOT LET THAT STAND, JUDGE.
maybe IT'D BE BETTER IF I DID THE CROSS-EXAMINATION.
if YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK, BY ALL MEANS.
if SILVER TERRACE IS SO ALIVE WITH COMMUNITY SPIRIT, WHY'D YOU MOV
I WANTED A SHORTER COMMUTE TO WORK,
but IT IS STILL MY CHURCH HOME.
when WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE IN SILVER TERRACE?
time FLIES. I... I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER.
do YOU REMEMBER GETTING CARJACKED DOWN THE STREET FROM THE CHURCH?
I GUESS WITHOUT A CAR,
you REALLY DID NEED A SHORTER COMMUTE.
judge, YOU WAED TO SEE ME?
Ah, MR. STONE. WALK WITH ME.
this ISN'T EX PARTE, BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CASE.
it's ABOUT YOU. OBVIOUSLY, I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOUR RECENT TROUBLE WITH THE BAR.
I GUESS THAT MEANS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK.
obviously, I'M CONCERNED YOU MIGHT USE YOUR ILLNESS
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT, SIR.
good.
I ADMIRE YOUR CLIENT SOLINSKY.
he IS A SELF-MADE MAN.
my SON-IN-W'S A WANNABE DEVELOPER IN SAN DIEGO.
I IMAGINE IT'D MEAN THE WORLD TO HIM TO PARTNER WITH AN ARVIN SOLINSKY.
well, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S ONLY ONE,
and HE HAPPENS TO BE MY CLIENT, SO...
in FACT, THERE'S A PROJECT
get OFF THE GROUND IF HE HAD SOLINSKY AS A PARTNER.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW APPRECIATIVE I'D BE
if YOU'D INTRODUCE MY SON-IN-LAW TO MR. SOLINSKY...
after THE CASE IS OVER, OF COURSE.
I'm SORRY, JUDGE SALESE.
I DON'T ENJOY THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. SOLINSKY.
are YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
I AM, SIR.
and I'M ALSO SURETHAT YOUR REQUEST IS A SERIOUS BREACH OF ETHICS.
considering YOUR RECENT TROUBLE WITH THE BAR,
who DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA BELIEVE--ME OR YOU?
forget I SAID ANYTHING.
you HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. STONE.
you TOO, SIR.
I GUESS IT'S A QUESTION OF WHAT I'M WILLING TO DO TO WIN.
this CASE ISN'T ABOUT WINNING OR LOSING, ELI.
no, IT'S ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND BEING A PROPHET.
God's GO-TO GUY.
for SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN TOUCHED BY DIVINITY,
you WHINE AN AWFUL LOT.
possibly TOUCHED BY A THEORETICAL DIVINITY,
and ANYWAY, BRIBING A JUDGE DOESN'T REALLY SOUND LIKE A PLAN
God WOULD COME UP WITH.
MOSEWAS RUNNING FROM THE LAW WHEN HE SAW THE BURNING BUSH.
martin LUTHER BROKE THE LAW BY TRANSLATING THE BIBLE,
broke A WHOLE BUNCH OF LAWS IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.
for THAT MATTER, SO DID GANDHI, WHO, BY THE WAY,
was ALSO A LAWYER.
I'm SORRY. I'M NOT BREAKING ANY LAWS.
I'd NEVER TELL YOU TO BREAK THE LAW, ELI.
aren't YOU?
Eli? - WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!
no, WE DON'T! IT'S ALL IN YOUR...
dude, YOU'VE GOTTA CALM DOWN.
you OKAY?
I've NEVER SEEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE HAVING ONE OF YOUR VISIONS.
it's INTENSE, BRO!
Eli! - COME-- - E-E-ELI!
you REMEMBER HOW I WAS HEARING MUSIC?
do YOU THINK I COULD LIKELY FORGET IT?
you MIGHT NOT BELIEVE JUST "THIS PART"?
just this part?
sometimes I HAVE VISIONS OF THE FUTURE.
am I BEING PUNK'D?
is THAT CUTE ASHTON KUTCHER GONNA JUMP OUT HERE?
I HEAR HE APPRECIATES THE MATURE WOMAN.
Patti, EVER SINCE MY ANEURYSM, I'VE HAD CERTAIN GIFTS.
is THIS SOME LAME ATTEMPT TO GET ME TO STOP BEING MAD AT YOU?
no. I SWEAR!
I SAW AN EARTHQUAKE, AND IT DESTROYS SILVER TERRACE.
that's WHY I'M HELPING SOLINSKY.
I HAVE TO GET YOUR FORMER NEIGHBORS OUT.
Eli, IF YOU ARE RUNNING A GAME ON ME,
so HELP ME, GOD
no, ACTUALLY, IT'S-- IT'S GOD I'M TRYING TO HELP.
that's WHO I THINK THESE VISIONS ARE FROM.
even IF YOU THINK I'M NUTS, IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
that SOLINSKY'S SETTLEMENT DEAL IS A GOOD ONE.
why WOULD THE ASSOCIATION LISTEN TO ME?
you're PART OF THE COMMUNITY. THEY TRUST YOU.
you COULD GET THEM TO TAKE THE DEAL.
Eli, I-I
I KNOW. I COULD BE CRAZY.
but WHAT IF I'M NOT?
I WASN'T IN MY RIGHT MIND.
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT HAPPENING.
aiming TO HIT JOHN QUESADA?
any OF IT.
I REMEMBER LOOKING DOWN THIRD BASE WHERE JOHN WAS,
and... AND I SNAPPED.
when YOU SAY YOU "SNAPPED..."
I GOT ANGRY. IT STARTED IN MY GUT,
and IT SPREAD TILL I COULD TASTE THE BILE IN MY MOUTH,
and THE NEXT THING, MY HEAD IS SPINNING, AND AFTER THAT,
I HONESTLY COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.
I CAN.
you HIT A LINE DRIVE STRAIGHT AT JOHN QUESADA'S HEAD.
I KNOW. I SAW THE TAPE.
that's GOTTA BE HARD TO DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR RIGHT MIND.
is COUNSEL ASKING US OR TELLING US?
were YOU TAKING PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS
the TIME JOHN QUESADA DIED?
on THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL, I DECLINE TO ANSWER.
I'll ASK IT ANOTHER WAY.
let ME SEE IF I GOT THIS STRAIGHT. THE STEROIDS,
which YOU CONVENIENTLY WON'T ADMIT TO TAKING,
put YOU IN A RAGE,
which CONVENIENTLY KILLED THE MAN
who WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH YOUR WIFE,
which CONVENIENTLY YOU CAN'T RECALL NOW.
I'm SITTING IN THIS CHAIR ON TRIAL FOR MY LIFE, MR. SWEREN.
there ISN'T ANYTHING "CONVENIENT" ABOUT THIS FOR ME.
redirect, YOUR HONOR?
Mr. TURK, JOHN QUESADA WAS SLEEPING WITH YOUR WIFE,
and YOU KNEW ABOUT IT.
do YOU EXPECT THIS JURY TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT BEFELL HIM
was JUST AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT?
obviously, SOME PART OF ME WANTED TO END THE MAN.
but I SWEAR TO GOD,
I NEVER INTENDED TO DO HIM ANY HARM.
the DEFENSE RESTS, YOUR HONOR.
the PEOPLE INTEND TO CALL A REBUTTAL WITNESS, YOUR HONOR.
who? CARLY TURK.
sidebar, YOUR HONOR.
I FAIL TO SEE HOW MS. TURK CAN ELABORATE ANY FURTHER
on THE TESTIMONY SHE'S ALREADY GIVEN.
and GET MR. TURK'S THREAT IN THROUGH SOME KIND OF BACK DOOR. UNLESS THE D. A.'s TRYING TO
suspicious MUCH?
suspicious A LOT. - CUT IT OUT.
if MR. SWEREN WANTS TO RECALL A WITNESS, I CAN'T STOP HIM.
but IF CARLY TURK SO MUCH AS REPEATS
what THE DEFENDANT MUMBLED IN HIS SLEEP,
I'm HOLDING YOU IN CONTEMPT.
what's GOING ON?
Powell CALLED AND SAID HE WANTED A MEETING.
which ONE OF YOU GOT TO MY CLIENTS?
what ARE YOU TALKINGBOUT, JEFF?
the RESIDENTS OF SILVER TERRACE HAD A SUDDEN AND INEXPLICABLE CHANGE OF HEART.
they'd LIKE TO ACCEPT MR. SOLINSKY'S OFFER
and DISMISS THE CASE.
could WE HAVE A MOMENT WITH OUR CLIENT?
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SETTLE.
what?
this IS THE SAME OFFER WE WERE WILLING TO MAKE THREE DAYS AGO.
you SAID THE OFFER WAS A GOOD IDEA.
when IT WOULD AVOID GOING TO TRIAL,
but WE'RE HERE ANYWAY, AND NOW I THINK WE CAN WIN.
our CHANCES OF WINNING
and I CAN'T RECOMMEND A $20 MILLION PAYOUT
on TOP OF ATTORNEY'S FEES
you're ALREADY INCURRING WITH THOSE ODDS.
you're RIGHT.
Mr. SOLINSKY-- - ELI, I KNOW YOU WANT TO SETTLE,
and I RESPECT YOUR POINT OF VIEW, BUT TAYLOR'S RIGHT.
if THEY WANTED ME TO WRITE THEM A CHECK,
they SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE MONEY WHILE THEY HAD THE CHANCE.
Thanks, TAYLOR.
Taylor, WHAT THE HELL?! - I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY,
but I AM LOOKING OUT FOR OUR CLIENT'S BEST INTERESTS,
not TRYINGO EVACUATE SILVER TERRACE
because I THINK I CAN SEE THE FUTURE. ELI.
okay, NOW WE HAVE TO WIN THIS IN COURT.
I'm GLAD WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
you CAN TELL ARVIN I'LL BE CLOSING.
I'm NOT SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
even IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME
believe THAT I BELIEVE IT.
so BETWEEN US, WHO DO YOU THINK WANTS TO WIN THIS THING MORE?
all HE EVER WANTED TO DO WAS WIN.
I THINK HE FELT LIKE HE HAD TO COMPETE WITH THE OTHER PLAYERS WHO WERE JUICING.
to YOUR KNOWLEDGE,
on THE DAY JOHN QUESADA DIED?
I SAW HIM GIVE HIMSELF TWO INJECTIONS.
immediately, HIS MOOD CHANGED.
but HE STILL SEEMED IN CONTROL OF HIS ACTIONS?
he WAS VERY ANGRY. HIS TEMPER WAS FLARING.
were YOU IN FEAR FOR YOUR SAFETY?
no. BUT I WAS AFRAID FOR JOHN.
Jason SAID HE WAS GONNA KILL HIM.
Mrs. TURK!
move FOR AN IMMEDIATE MISTRIAL, YOUR HONOR.
clear THE COURTROOM NOW!
that WAS A PRIVILEGED CONVERSATION,
the CONTENTS OF WHH ARE COMPLETELY PREJUDICIAL.
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HER
sure, YOU DID.
look, THERE'S NO REASON FOR A MISTRIAL.
the JURY CAN BE INSTRUCTED TO IGNORE MRS. TURK'S STATEMENT.
no INSTRUCTION, - I HATE GRANTING MISTRIALS, MR. WETHERSBY... - BUT
almost AS MUCH AS I HATE UNFAIR TRIALS.
if YOU DECLARE A MISTRIAL, YOUR HONOR,
Jason CAN'T BE TRIED AGAIN. IT'S DOUBLE JEOPARDY.
it DOESN'T APPLY
it DOES WHEN THE MISTRIAL ARISES OUT OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.
he's BEEN DEAD SET ON WINNING THIS ANY WAY HE CAN.
I WANT TO TALK TO CARLY TURK.
then I'LL MAKE MY RULING.
arvin SOLINSKY, PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY.
just NOT THE COMMUNITY HE'S TRYING TO BULLDOZE.
talking TO YOURSELF? NOT A GOOD SIGN.
neither IS THE FACT THAT I'M GONNA CHOKE ON THE BIGGEST CLOSING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
don't YOU THINK THAT'S A LITTLE OVERDRAMATIC?
it's REAL ESTATE, NOT LIFE AND DEATH.
you'd BE SURPRISED.
what IS IT, ELI?
I CAN'T TELL YOU.
if I TELL YOU,
you're GONNA THINK I'M INSANE, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
maybe, BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T TALK TO ME.
if I DON'T WIN THIS CASE,
the PEOPLE OF SILVER TERRACE-- OR AT LEAST A LOT OF THEM ARE GONNA DIE IN AN EARTHQUAKE.
how DO YOU KNOW THEY'LL DIE?
don't ASK ME HOW I KW, MAGGIE. I JUST DO.
okay.
okay"?
you BELIEVE ME?
why WOULDN'T I?
well, I DON'T KNOW
because SOMEONE SAYING THEY CAN SEE THE FUTURE IS LUDICROUS?
well, GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T JUST TELL YOU.
you REALLY B-- YOU REALLY BELIEVE ME?
I'm NOT SAYING YOU CAN SEE THE FUTURE.
but SINCE I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU,
you've BEEN NOTHING BUT HONEST AND SINCERE...
and, YEAH, TOTALLY OBNOXIOUS.
but IF YOU TELL ME SOMETHING, I BELIEVE IT'S TRUE.
I TOLD MY BROTHER. I TOLD PATTI...
Taylor.
none OF THEM BELIEVE ME.
you DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE.
you KNOW, YOU'RE PRETTY AMAZING.
Eli, NO.
I'm SORRY.
look, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, ELI.
you SAID NOTHING COULD HAPPEN.
I KNOW. I DID. I'M SORRY.
so WE AGREED THERE'S A LINE.
please JUST... STOP CROSSING IT!
the RULE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY,
that A DEFENDANT CANNOT BE TRIED TWICE,
does NOT APPLY IN THE CASE OF A MISTRIAL,
except WHEN THE MISTRIAL IS THE RESULT OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, AS ALLEGED BY THE DEFENSE HERE.
I've SPOKEN PRIVATELY WITH MRS. TURK,
and SHE CONFESSED TO ME
that HER SPONTANEOUS OUTBURST OF PRIVILEGED INFORMATION
was, IN FACT, A PLANNED STATEMENT
coached BY THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.
your HONOR, SHE'S LYING! - SHE'S YOUR WITNESS, COUNSEL,
and YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TICKING ME OFF
any MORE THAN I ALREADY AM.
I'm FINDING
there WAS PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IN THIS CASE.
jeopardy ATTACHES,
and THE DEFENDANT CANNOT BE TRIED AGAIN.
accordingly, THIS MATTER IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
Mr. TURK, SEE PROBATION. THEN YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
Mr. TURK?
bigger THAN THE WORLD SERIES, MR. WETHERSBY. BIGGER.
congratulations, MAN.
ready FOR THE CAMERAS?
the TERM "BORN READY" COMES TO MIND.
Mr. TURK! JAYSON, JAYSON!
how DOES IT FEEL NOW THAT YOU'RE ACQUITTED? HOW DOES IT FEEL NOW?
now THAT THE EVIDENCE IS CLOSED, IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION,
I'm READY TO RENDER MY DECISION.
you DON'T WANT TO HEAR
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'LL MATERIALLY AFFECT MY RULING, MR. POWELL.
the SUPREME COURT HAS RULED THAT EXPANDING TAX REVENUE
is IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
and CITY OFFICIALS HERE HAVE DECIDED
that's WHAT MR. SOLINSKY'S PROJECT WILL DO.
if THIS IS NOT WHAT THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY WANT,
they CAN VOTE THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OUT.
but I AM BOUND TO UPHOLD THEIR DECISION.
judgment FOR THE DEFENDANT.
T. R.O. IS HEREBY LIFTED, AND I AM ISSUING A MINUTE ORDER
instructing THE RESIDENTS OF SILVER TERRACE TO VACATE...
What?! - WITH ALL DELIBERATE SPEED!
all RIGHT, SIGN HERE... AND INITIAL HERE.
that's IT.
your MAJOR LEAGUE SUSPENSION'S OFFICIALLY LIFTED.
batter UP.
Thanks, BRO.
before WE'RE DONE, UH...
I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHIN'.
thought I'D GET A HEAD START ON THE DIVORCE PLEADING BEFORE CARLY HAD TIME TO HIDE ANY ASSETS.
it's JUST ANOTHER SIGNATURE.
look, GUYS...
I THINK WE'RE GONNA TRY TO WORK IT OUT.
there's STILL A LOT OF LOVE THERE, YOU KNOW?
no, I DON'T.
she CHEATED ON YOU AND TRIED TO STICK YOU IN PRISON.
I MEAN, HOW MUCH LOVE COULD WE BE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
the D. A. DIDN'T CONSPIRE WITH CARLY TO BLURT OUT THE THREAT ON THE STAND, DID HE?
she CONSPIRED WITH YOU.
you're WORTH MORE TO HER AS A CATCHER ON THE OUTSIDE
than A CATCHER ON THE INSIDE. IT WAS SMART.
I MEAN, ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS HAVE A "SPONTAOUS OUTBURST
on THE STAND AND SAY SWEREN COACHED HER,
and YOU GET A MISTRIAL. JEOPARDY ATTACHES.
you WALK CLEAN.
you KNOW WHY YOU LOVED THAT 'ROID RAGE DEFENSE SO MUCH?
because IT FIT YOUR PICTURE OF WHO I WAS.
you THOUGHT I WAS STUPID. YOU WERE WRONG.
I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT. SWEREN MAY BE A BOTTOM-FEEDER,
but HE'S NOT A CHEATER. YOU ARE.
rules ARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE. RIGHT?
I WAS ABOUT TO LOSE EVERYTHING.
great PLAYERS PERFORM UNDER PRESSURE.
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.
we DONE?
Oh, YEAH. WE'RE DONE.
Thanks, BRAH.
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.
now WOULD NOT BE A GOOD TIME TO SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO.
actually, IT IS.
you FOUGHT ME THIS WHOLE TIME, LIKE I WAS THE BAD GUY FOR NOT GETTING ON THE JAYSON TURK BANDWAGON.
if IT'D BEEN ANY OTHER GUY, SAME SET OF FACTS,
we'd HAVE BEEN ON THE SAME PAGE FROM JUMP.
I GET IT. I'M A JERK
no, YOU'RE A JERK BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.
makes YOU FEEL ANY BETTER, YOU KNOW,
people WILL FIGURE IT OUT WHEN THEY SEE HIM WITH CARLY.
I'm NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN ADD TWO PLUS TWO.
no. NO, HE'LL GET AWAY WITH IT.
that's WHAT HE DOES.
Congratulations.
to YOU, TOO.
I'm NOT SURE I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
why ARVIN ASKED ME FOR THE PHONE NUMBER OF JUDGE SALESE'S SON-IN-LAW?
no IDEA.
that's FUNNY, 'CAUSE ARVIN SAID YOU WOULD.
something ABOUT A MEETING YOU ARRANGED?
he WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION I KNEW ABOUT IT.
Eli, TELL ME YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY TO WIN THIS CASE.
you KNOW, NOW'S REALLY NOT A GOOD TIME.
I PROMISED MAGGIE I WOULD PROOF HER SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION.
so I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE CATCHING A FLIGHT TO OHIO?
she SENT OUT AN OFFICE-WIDE E-MAIL.
but I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT EITHER.
I just want you to know
I'm not coming back into the office today.
where ARE YOU? - My church.
you KNOW, THE ONE YOU'RE GETTING TORN DOWN.
no, PATTI, NOT THE CHURCH.
There--there's gonna be an earthquake, and you...
what ARE YOU DOIN' HERE? - YOU'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
Why? THIS PLACE ISN'T GETTING DEMOLISHED UNTIL NEXT WEEK,
and IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IS BRINGING IT DOWN.
no EARTHQUAKE. WHERE IS IT, ELI?
I-I... I DON'T KNOW.
it MAY COME TOMORROW OR IN A FEW DAYS.
or A FEW MONTHS OR A FEW YEARS, MAYBE?
the LAST TIME I CAME HE, I PRAYED FOR MY FATHER.
he WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.
and I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WALK THROUGH THOSE DOORS SINCE.
I JUST-- I COULDN'T BELIEVE ANYMORE.
but YOU SAID GOD WAS TALKIN' TO YOU,
and I THOUGHT MAYBE
I DID SEE YOU IN HERE.
you DON'T SEE ANYTHING, ELI.
God DOESN'T TALK TO YOU.
you're SICK, AND YOU NEED TO GET BETTER.
you're THE ONE I WAS PRAYING FOR THIS TIME.
are YOU CERTAIN?
he STOPPED SHORT OF ADMITTING IT, BUT YEAH, I'M SURE.
I SEE.
you UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, THAT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO?
Yes, THERE IS.
we CAN KICK HIM TO THE CURB. - EXCUSE ME?
drop HIM AS A CLIENT RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T TAKE ANOTHER PENNY.
you're TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF MILONS OF PENNIES
in COMMISSIONS AND FEES.
his AGENT JUST SENT OVER HIS LATEST ENDORSEMENT CONTRACT.
I KNOW.
you've NEVER DEMONSTRATED
a PARTICULARLY ACTIVE CONSCIENCE, MR. DOWD.
this ISN'T FINDING A TAX LOOPHOLE
so SOME BILLIONAIRE CAN SAVE $5, 000, SIR.
I-it's A HUMAN BEING KILLING ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
and MAKING THIS FIRM AN ACCOMPLICE AFTER THE FACT
your FIRM.
my FIRM.
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT THIS PLACE TO BE.
I KNOW I DON'T.
you REALLY FEEL THAT STRONGLY ABOUT IT?
I DO.
for SOME TIME, I'VE MADE NO SECRET OF THE FACT
that I SAW ELI AS MY HEIR APPARENT AT THIS FIRM.
it IS ALSO NO SECRET THAT HIS STATUS HAS CHANGED.
and WHERE HE HAS FALLEN SHORT,
but I NEVER SAW THE LEADERSHIP QUALITIES IN YOU
that I SAW IN HIM...
until NOW.
we'll DROP MR. TURK AS OUR CLIENT EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.
thank YOU, SIR.
I WAS JUST CLOSING UP.
Patti's AT THE SILVER TERRACE CHURCH.
you KNOW, JUST LIKE IN MY VISION.
while I WAS THERE, I JUST--I...
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE A DISTINCT LACK OF EARTHQUAKE.
maybe THE EARTHQUAKE WAS METAPHORICAL.
maybe BECAUSE YOU GOT THE PEOPLE OUT,
you PREVENTED THE WHOLE THING FROM HAPPENING.
maybe, MAYBE, MAYBE.
God WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. OURS IS NOT TO REASON WHY.
for A GOD WHO SEEMS TO WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN HIM,
you'd THINK HE'D OFFER UP SOME EVIDENCE,
some PROOF OF HIS ALMIGHTY EXISTENCE.
that's WHAT FAITH IS, ELI-- BELIEF IN THE ABSENCE OF PROOF.
I KEEP WAITING FOR SOME SMALL CONFIRMATION THAT THERE IS A GOD,
that I HAVEN'T JUST DESTROYED MY LIFE FOR NOTHING.
are YOU GONNA STAND HERE AND TELLE
there WAS MORE MEANING IN YOUR PAYCHECK
than IN THE PEOPLE YOU'VE HELPED LATELY?
could YOU HAVE DONE ANY OF THAT WITHOUT FAITH?
I DID IT ALL WITHOUT FAITH!
I DID IT WITH-- WITH MY LAW LICENSE...
the ONE I PISSED ON YESTERDAY!
what ABOUT ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT YOURSELF,
your--your FATHER, ME? WAS THAT ALL SOME COINCIDENCE?
if THAT IS PROOF THAT GOD IS BEHIND EVERYTHING
that's HAPPENING TO ME,
then IT ALSO MEANS THAT HE WANTED ME TO HURT THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE ME THE MOST...
that HE WANTED ME TO BREAK THEIR HEARTS,
break THE LAW!
he WANTED ME TO FORCE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES!
I'm SORRY, MAN.
that IS NOT ANY KIND OF GOD I WANT TO BELIEVE IN.
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS FOR YOU-- - YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO KNOW!
none OF THIS IS REAL.
none OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF GOD.
it's BEEN MY ANEURYSMTHE WHOLE DAMN TIME
and IT'S GONNA STOP!
I'm GONNA FIND A SURGEON, AND I'M GOA GET
this THING OUT OF MY HEAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
Eli, THAT SURGERY COULD KILL YOU.
if I DON'T GET IT OUT NOW,
I-I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO LIVE FOR ANYWAY.
you know I've been seeing things lately.
uh, when do you take it out?
given the location of the aneurysm, surgery is a bad idea.
who's that? - Beth Keller
the Beth that was your first at bat?
I feel awful.
and you broke up with me.
you wanna grab a drink?
so Stone's out and Dowd's in.
U're firing me? - I can't.
what I'm not obligated to do is provide you with an office or an assistant.
it's been my aneurysm the whole damn time, and I'm gonna get this thing out of my head!
that surgery could kill you!
I won't have anything left to live for anyway.
there's gotta be a less humiliating outfit.
something that closes in the back, at last.
I overheard one of the nurses saying she thought your butt was cute.
come on. Don't be nervous.
all we're doing is talking about surgery on my brain. What's here to be nervous about?
blindness. - Coma.
long-term memory loss.
sure, I can remove it.
it's no biggie.
you've found your man. - Really?
that's fantastic. - Told you.
just out of curiosity, how attached are you to your ability to speak?
so I'd be a vegetable.
I wouldn't use the word "vegetable."
well, I was combining blindness, paralysis and permanent brain damage into one easy-to-remember category.
didn't you mention some hospital in China?
Tin-tin puma?
tiantan puhua.
and the news won't sound any better in mandarin.
look, Eli, are you sure this is something you really want?
if the something is ending up a drooling idiot, then no.
but if it means getting the brain defect removed from my head that's making my life a living hell, then yes.
well, the good news is you're already a drooling idiot, so the only thing left to do is pick a surgeon for the other thing.
out of those guys?
they didn't seem like they could remove a cap from a pen.
they're the best neurosurgeons I could get you in with.
well, now let's try the ones that you couldn't get me in with.
all right, there's one-- Sanjay Rajapaksa, but he doesn't take walk-ins.
he only handles cases originating from his own hospital.
or he did, until you applied your copious powers of persuasion.
all right, all right, I'll make a call.
you're the best. Thank you.
mm, don't thank me. I just don't want to spend the rest of my life wiping drool off your chin.
what are you doing at the hospital?
I, um... I'm sorry.
I just didn't expect to see you.
I'm bringing Ben to the doctor.
you know he's not with you, right?
Yes, he's... at the psychologist.
they work one-on-one for an hour, individual counsEling.
so how are you?
I saw you on the news.
I was gonna call, but I figured, you know, you have enough on your plate.
Yeah, I've been better.
I, uh... I got demoted.
I lost my office.
I had a fight with my acupuncturist/spiritual guide.
I alienated the one person at work who mistakenly admired me and made a serious ethical breach which helped get several hundred people kicked out of their homes...
and I-I broke up with Taylor.
that's... Oh, Eli.
if you ever need to talk, you still have my number, right?
Yeah.
I might just give you a call. - okay.
Bye.
you'll never guess who I ran into.
come on, Patti, guess.
you're not Patti.
no, um, I'm Bradley Kitsis.
I'm your temp.
Where's Patti?
she's not here.
I noticed.
I can see, Bradley, at least for now.
Oh, she left me this note to read to you.
Uh,"Eli, I'm taking a personal week..." - personal week?
to look after my friends and relatives in Silver Terrace who, thanks to you, now have no homes.
"no HOMES" is in capital letters, which is why I...
Thanks, Brad. I got it.
our billables are up by 10% this quarter,
an increase almost entirely due to our success in the Solinsky case.
I can't help but swell with fatherly pride.
I had a lot of help.
perhaps you'd willing to apply your deft touch to Judge Doyle.
this being Doyle "the il."
good luck.
judge Doyle has just retained W. P.K. in connection with a personal medical crisis.
is he finally getting the pole removed from his rectum?
I hear that can be a painful procedure.
not nearly as painful as leukemia, Mr. Dowd.
judge Doyle needs a bone marrow transplant to treat his cancer, but his only donor match backed out of the donation agreement yesterday.
and now that we've established your sensitivity to the judge's plight, you can assist taylor.
sir, Doyle the -- uh, Judge Doyle hates me.
I'm sure you're familiar with my "I could care less" face.
moving on to other outstanding business...
Oh, no. It's not.
Oh, no, it's not what?
are you Eli Stone?
I'm George Michael.
would -- would you mind not poking me, please?
well, I'm sorry, it's just, you know, you're very solid for a vision.
and you're a very odd man.
well, at least I'm not a hallucination.
well, he can see me.
Adley, do you see me talking to anyone?
real life? Actual person?
of course I do, sir. That's Bono.
Yeah, it happens all the time.
I had the glasses first, by the way.
mind you, Bono and I do have something in common in that we are both perfectly visible.
I'm sorry. I think I've been wasting your time, Mr. Stone.
no, no, no. Please, please, please, uh, stay. I...
I'm sorry. I just don't
I don't typically get visits like this one.
what can I do for you, Mr. Michael?
call me George.
um, well, I want you to take a case for me.
I found this in the "times.
it's about a young girl who was thrown out of her high school for playing one of my songs at a school "abstinence" assembly.
of course. This was all over the news.
what was the song again?
uh, "I want your sex."
sorry, you're not my type. It was a joke.
anyway, uh, I want to hire you to help her get back in.
now obviously I'll cover all the legal fees, Mr. Stone.
call me Eli, and this is very generous of you.
obviously, I wouldn't, uh...
I couldn't say no to you. So...
if you don't mind me asking...
why me?
why did you come to me?
well, you might think I'm the odd one now.
but the other night I had a dream, and, um, in the dream, I was completely lost, uh, when someone told me I needed to find a lawyer named Eli stone.
Mr. Wethersby?
you were looking for me, sir?
that would be inconsistent with the termination of our relationship, now wouldn't it?
I just heard that you wanted to see me, sir.
maybe Bradley meant Mr. Posner.
no, he meant me.
I just didn't want you inferring that I actually craved this conversation.
nevertheless, I understand that you've been retained by -- who was it again?
george Michael, the pop superstar?
Yes, sir, unless there's a problem with that.
there is, actually -- two problems, in fact.
for one thing, you're still on probation.
secondly, section 6. 3 paragraph "j" of the partnership agreement obligates a partner to oversee any case where the client has a high public profile.
well, I guess it's good then that George isn't technically the client.
her name is Molly Foster.
she's 17 and much less famous, sir.
I don't have all day to waste on semantics.
if someone of Mr. Michael's esteem is involved in this case, then obviously the requirement to oversee applies.
including appearing in court?
and managing client relations, yes.
okay, then. Welcome to the case.
I'm sure Mr. Michael will appreciate having a senior partner on his team.
as will Molly, sir. - Who?
our client, Molly Foster.
right. Right.
I didn't expect this from Jordan Wethersby.
I ask him to send me his best lawyers.
he sends me a girl.
well, let me introduce you to Mr. Wethersby's daughter, sir.
I wasn't talking about her, Dowd.
good to see you, Taylor.
so let's get to it.
so you're worried about the, uh, lack of legal precedent?
no, I'm worried about the lack of precedent in our favor.
well, that's why I pay the 2 of you $550 an hour.
I know this is a long shot, but I have no choice.
I'm dying.
leukemia processed to stage four.
nowhere to go but down.
did you tell the would-be donor?
no, Mr. Dowd.
I wanted him to think I need the painful extractions of his bone marrow for my personal collection.
usually only family members are an exact match.
the would-be donor is a relative, isn't he?
my son.
and he knows you're dying, and he still won't help you?
we aren't exactly close.
he was 2 when his mother and I divorced, and I haven't seen Scott since then.
so the settlement conference we're scheduled to have in an hour is the first time you're seeing your son in 19 years?
okay!
I'll have all the sharp objects removed from the conference room.
this is a critical meeting, obviously.
it's important that you let me do the talking, get us off on the right foot with mary.
Molly, sir. - Understandably, she'll be reluctant to dive...
into the legal waters, but - Eli!
George, hello again.
I'm sorry. I'm not too late, am I? You're just off to see molly?
exactly. No, you're just in time. - Cool.
this is the firm's senior partner, Jordan Wethersby.
Yes, it's, um...
an honor, Mr. Michael. - Yeah. Call me George.
it's good to see you again.
you make it sound like we just saw each other last week.
why don't we all sit down?
have you had a chance to review our proposal?
Yes.
this isn't...
I don't care about the money.
well, unless I'm mistaken, judge Doyle already prevailed upon your more noble instincts.
I took the test.
doctors started to describe the procedure to me, and I guess I had second thoughts, okay?
I'm sorry.
I mean, it's not like I even know you or anything.
I know. I know, and I'm sorry.
I truly am.
but I'm asking for your help here.
and believe me when I tell ya, that's not something that comes easy for me.
I went through this phase where I'd send you things
letters, report cards. What did you ever do with those things anyway?
I thought...
I thought I shouldn't promise a relationship I couldn't deliver on.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I guess I can't deliver now.
sorry.
I don't think we'll be settling.
you are a dead ringer.
it's amazing.
mom, you have to see this George Michael impersonator Chloe hired!
it's hilarious.
Hi, Molly. It's great to meet you.
I've read about your expulsion from school, and I've hired these attorneys to help you get back in.
shut up.
no way. Please come in.
Oh, can I get you gentlemen anything? Coffee?
maybe something British - some crumpets or a pint of bitters?
no, thank you. That's fine.
sir, you're unusually quiet. Are you feeling okay?
I feel fine. Don't ever touch me again.
so you totally read about me? - Yep.
that is so cool.
why don't you tell us exactly what happened at school?
there was this, um, lame-ass assembly
the "abstinence only" assembly?
twice a semester, some expert in never, ever having sex tells us all about it.
after two years of this, um, bull, I decided to take a stand.
I snuck into the principal's office d played "I want your sex" er the P. A.
the challenge here will be circumventing the supreme court's decision in Morse vs. Frederick, which limits the right to free speech on school grounds.
so you're saying I could lose?
always a possibility in litigation, Ms. Foster, but...
you gotta have "faith."
another one of your songs, I think.
Oh, that's right, yeah.
excuse me.
Hey, it's me.
I just got off the phone with Rajapaksa.
you remember? Super neurosurgeon?
well, uh, it took a lot of begging and a new set of golf clubs, but...
he's agreed to see you.
obviously, it's a risk either way you slice it.
actually, there won't be any slicing involved.
we burn it out of you.
that's just what I always wanted.
so you guys will talk and let me know?
Yeah, we'll call you later.
thank you so much, Dr. Rajapaksa.
anytime.
awesome.
okay, there is an O. R. Free week after next with your name on it.
you sure that's the guy?
well, he's competent, confident, expert in the latest techniques.
Eli, if he were any more qualified, he'd be a fictional tv character.
I'm not asking for a description of him.
I'm asking if you think that's the guy.
I can't make that choice for you, Eli. I...
it's too big. I...
you're the only one who can do that.
you want this thing out or not
I want it out. I just - I'm not sure that this is the right time.
I'm having a strange week.
well, coming from you, that's saying something.
george Michael showed up at my office - for real this time
don't joke - the same day I happened to bump into beth, and she has kind of a connection with him.
Yeah. Her son sees a doctor at this hospital.
I was thinking of giving her a call.
a - a call like
like a date, yes. - Yeah.
why not?
I'm newly single, about to be aneurysm-free.
well, yeah, but...
but what?
nothing.
I just, you know, be careful, all right?
I know I'm not the reason my parents split up and my father left, but when you're a kid, that's how it feels, you know, like it's your fault.
but now you have a chance at - at reconciling with your father.
if I give him my bone marrow.
what kind of relationship do we stand to have with those kinds of strings attached?
I'm curious.
how do you even know whether you're a compatible donor?
I got tested.
three months ago, he called me up.
no "how are you?"
no "sorry I wrote you off."
just, "I've got canc. Would you get your blood tested?"
I take it the test determined that you are indeed a compatible donor?
Yes, I'm a match.
hoping the family similarities end there.
why go through the steps of having yourself tested if you're not prepared to go through with the donation?
is it because maybe you have an obligation to your father, however estranged he may be?
I got tested because...
I wanted to see if I was a match.
I wanted to see if I could save your life...
so I could tell you to go choke on it.
my reasons were just.
I knew I'd get in trouble.
I just didn't think I'd be expelled.
did you not know that school policy gives the principal discretion to expel anyone whose - whose behavior "materially interferes with the learning of other students or disrupts the overall education process"?
Yes, but that assumes what was happening at the assembly was learning.
the abstinence - only lady tells us condoms don't work, that girls who have abortions are more prone to suicide.
and because of all of those misconceptions, students in abstinence -only programs are less likely to use contraception.
objection. Are we to accept Miss Foster as an expert witness?
the plaintiff's knowledge - or, I submit, lack thereof - goes to the merits
or lack thereof - of the very pedagogy Miss Foster's protest was taking issue with.
miss Foster, please limit your answers to your direct experiences.
Molly, how has the school's policy affected you?
first, my lab partner got pregnant.
then, um, a friend - I don't want to tell her name, 'cause her mom would totally kill her
she got gonorrhea... in her throat.
I decided I had to do something.
thank you, Molly.
very descriptive.
and the "something" you decided to do was to play the song "I want your sex" at a school assembly?
that's a very mature form of political protest.
the execution of Ms. Foster's protest isn't at issue here, only whether it's protected under our country's most cherished constitutional principles.
is that an objection?
a strenuous one, your honor.
sustained.
there was no other course of action?
you couldn't have organized a petition?
I wanted to expose the hypocrisy.
and when you did, do you think you were being disruptive?
I hope so.
thank you.
no further questions.
that was invigorating.
it reminded me of my salad days
standing up, p,making a compelling objection...
right in the middle of my direct examination.
on an issue of real significance - not just freedom of speech, but the application of that right to our nation's youngest, ones who are truly disenfranchised - not having the right to vote or...
something on your mind, Mr. Stone?
I was just wondering if it was possible that you were A...
fanboy of a certain celebrity client.
Mr. Stone, did you just characterize me, Jordan Wethersby II, senior partner of one of this country's most prestigious firms, a "fanboy"?
of course not, sir, but
I didn't think so.
and for the record, my musical tastes are none of your concern.
in the name of all that's good and holy, what now?
I hate that song.
I would never sing it under any circumstances, even hallucinatory ones.
just like you would never go out with one of our co-workers.
Eli, is there something you want to ask me?
no, 'cause I don't listen to my visions anymore, so...
well, considering last week, A.K. A.Bribing a judge, it's probably for the best.
well, without admitting or denying anything, there won't be any more of that stuff, cause I'm - I'm having it taken out...
the aneurysm.
I thought it was too dangerous. - Nah.
the ability to swallow's overrated.
just tell me. Is there something going on with you and Matt?
no.
you know, if you hadn't dumped me - repeatedly, I might add
I would say you were jealous.
I'm not jealous. I'm not.
it's just been a rough week, okay?
you wouldn't happen to have any time later, would you?
I'll tell you all about it.
look, I get the feeling you're alone right now.
so am I.
but I'm trying to move on.
so I can't be that shoulder for you to cry on.
I'm sorry. I just - I can't.
that's okay.
Hey, beth? It's Eli.
Yeah, well, I was thinking about what you said the other day about, uh, needing to talk to someone, and, uh, I kinda do.
principal Ackerman, you said that Molly was expelled because her actions were a violation of school policy, correct?
students have to learn about consequences.
that's why the school has a strict zero tolerance policy in those circumstances.
zero tolerance?
so you expel every kid who pulls a prank?
when those pranks are disruptive.
so last fall, when the football team kidnapped the mascot from a rival high school, did you expel the whole team?
I didn't deem that prank disruptive to the other students' educations.
what about when members of the senior class superglued the teacher's lounge door shut?
those students were suspended.
but not expelled?
it sounds like your zero tolerance policy is more like A...
six tolerance policy.
objection. - Pass the witness.
principal Ackerman, why does your school have an abstinence - only program?
because it's the only sex education that the federal government will give us money for.
and if word got out that a student played a sexually explicit song during one of your assemblies
I'd lose the funding, and the school would have no sex ed program.
is that right?
I don't know.
what I do know is that a girl playing a song that promotes promiscuous sex during a lecture on abstinence risks the program for everyone.
your honor, the plaintiff would like to call a rebuttal witness
it's the legal name of the artist who wrote the offending song, your honor.
Mr. George Michael. - fine.
court will recess until tomorrow.
you're a judge.
the case comes before you.
do you order one human being to undergo a painful medical procedure to benefit another?
bottom line
if I were a jurist on this, I could find precedent to support saving my life.
my son can be as angry as he wants at me, but the last time I checked, being a lousy dad didn't carry the death penalty.
you know, I had a dad.
he left my mother when I was... 6...
for her best friend.
I saw him summers and every other Christmas.
I'm sorry.
at what point did Mr. Dowd become a witness?
at the point when you let me finish.
my dad died three years ago.
and if I had a chance to save his life,
I think the first thing I'd want to know is why I should.
because regret's a lousy thing to live with.
well, that's sweet.
they should put that in a poem or something.
we're all here wondering why Scott should feel any regret at all.
you are as much a stranger to him as my father was to me.
more so.
we're family, however estranged we may be.
nothing changes that.
no, you changed it.
you walked out that door two decades ago, and you never look back.
and so I should die for that?
Scott didn't give you cancer, judge.
you want him to save you? - Yes.
tell us. Tell us why he should.
because he's my son.
he has an obligation - no, he doesn't.
you pissed away any obligation he had to you.
now tell us why he should help you now.
because I want to live!
I want to live.
the only chance I have of that is him.
Taylor. We met at
Oh, your engagement party, of course.
it's so nice to see you.
what are you doing here?
is - is everything okay? Your son?
Oh, he's great, thanks.
no, I'm, um, I'm not here on business. I'm having dinner.
with Eli? - Yeah.
that's great.
old friends catching up.
have fun. - Thanks.
what are you doing?
cause I desperately, desperately need a margarita.
and you want me to come with you?
right! Great. Well, let me just...
or not.
no, she didn't. - Yes. Yes, she did.
Melanie bose totally had the hots for you.
so that's why you were talking to me at that party?
you were playing wingwoman for the girl with the headgear?
when she found out that we slept togeer, she never talked to me again.
that's because you were a college whore. - I know.
what?
I just think - and this is a good week, you know?
george Michael's here, my case is interesting, and...
and I haven't laughed like this in a long time.
thanks for going out with me tonight.
it's my pleasure.
you know, all that's going on with you, I'm really glad that I can be here.
you don't know how nice it is to hear that.
lately I've been less popular than...
Melanie Bose.
well, you're just going through a rough time.
but think of all the people that you've helped - Okay, me and Ben for two.
winning that Beutel trial totally changed our lives.
I mean, you have to know that.
I do know that.
I just - it just doesn't change the fact that...
that I'm alone.
I'm so sorry, Eli.
God.
I just broke the rule number one, you know?
you don't tell a girl you're on a date with that you're lonely.
Oh, God - what?
are you okay? - Uh, yeah.
no.
Nate told me, um, he said that he was gonna tell you today.
tell me what?
about you guys dating? - Yeah.
Oh, no. Of course he told me that.
thank God! Oh, my God.
for a second there I thought maybe you didn't know.
Oh, no. Well, that would be awkward.
to losers.
national order of total losers, San Francisco chapter, in session.
what - don't look at me like that.
you didn't have any plans tonight either, loser.
believe me, I could have had plans - plenty of plans with plenty of ladies.
all right, fine. I'm the only loser, then. To me.
no, you're not a loser, Taylor.
you're smart. You're hot.
you're funny... you're hot...
and an excellent drinker.
he's getting it out.
who's getting what out?
Eli. Aneurysm.
out. Bye - bye, aneurysm.
turns out that's not why he dumped me anyway.
what are you talkin' about?
I thought he wanted to protect me.
I thought he didn't want me to see him suffer.
turns out the aneurysm was just an excuse.
Eli dumped me because he just didn't love me enough.
well, I don't know much about aneurysms, but something's gotta be wrong if he dumped you.
that's sweet.
what you said in court today about ur dad
now I know why you have to be so damn cocky all the time, why you only date these vapid bimbos.
you're scared that you're gonna be abandoned by someone you actually care about.
sometimes it's just so hard...
to be the real me.
she told you.
have you any idea how humiliating that was for me?
this isn't how I wanted you find out. - That finally after months of
of misery and loneliness and - and visions,
I finally ask someone out, and I think we're making a connection, only to find out she's already dating my brother.
I - I was gonna tell you yesterday.
Yeah, I could tell from the way you didn't.
we had just come from the doctor.
you have all of these huge, life - altering decisions on your plate.
I didn't want to make things worse.
by telling me you were happy?
I was trying to protect you.
well, I'm a big boy, Nate.
you dating Beth wouldn't have even registered if you'd have told me before I'd made an ass out of myself!
okay. All right.
so you would have said,"hey, that's great.
you know, my life is tanking "worse than the latest Ben Stiller movie," but I'm so glad you're happy.
maybe I would have, yeah. Who knows?
I've been an - an idiot lately. I pushed Taylor away.
I pushed Maggie away, Tti, Chen.
I just - I just thought that no matter how much of an idiot I was,
I wouldn't push my own brother away.
you haven't pushed me away.
you've been dating the girl I lost my virginity to for two months, and you haven't mentioned it.
I said I was sorry.
you call the doctors.
you make all the appointments.
but you don't want to go anywhere near this decision, 'cause you're afraid of how you're gonna feel if it doesn't work
if I end up paralyzed or worse.
you're a doctor, but you're my big brother, man.
and I need you now more than ever.
but if this is your idea of helping me, thanks but no, thanks.
Eli, wait.
just wait! - God!
come on, kitty, move. You're on my jacket!
give him a pat.
Sonny Bono loves to be touched.
your cat's name is Sonny Bono?
that's so weird.
it was between that and "Jason Bourne."
you're trying to sneak out of here, aren't you?
I'm not sure I've ever been snuck out on before.
no, wait, I have.
I'm not sneaking out.
I'm just leaving quietly.
I've got court.
I know... with me.
please be seated.
it is profoundly disturbing to me that one human being could willfully deny another their last hope for life.
but that doesn't change the very real fact that there is no legal precedent to support judge Doyle's claim.
the plaintiff's suit for breach of contract and specific remedy of performance is hereby denied and judgment granted to the defendant.
Scott, I know I don't deserve what I'm asking for.
but please don't do anything that you...
Mr. Michael, tell me, what inspired your song, "I want your sex"?
a song, by the way, which rose to number one on the world charts
a song that helped you win a grammy for best album of the year.
well, it was inspired by a relationship.
like most of my work, it was autobiographical.
you heard principal Ackerman describe the song as encouraging promiscuity.
but it's just the opposite.
ironically enough, I wrote the song about abstinence, and I was very much in love with someone at the time.
so how do you feel about your song being used to protest an abstinence - only sex education program?
well, I applaud it, obviously.
when I wrote it, we were in year six of the A. I . D. S. Crisis, a crisis that ronald reagan did not even address publicly until there were over 21, 000 people dead.
and what the government is doing right now
funding federal programs that tell children that condoms don't work
is killing people all over again.
thank you, Mr. Michael.
these are the lyrics to "I want your sex."
would you please read the highlighted portion?
sex is natural. Sex is good.
not everybody does it, but everybody should.
do you not think?
do you deny that these lyrics could be understood to promote sexual activity?
no, to deny that would be ridiculous.
nothing further, your honor.
but would ms. Abrams' interpretation of the lyrics be appropriate in the context of an abstinence - only sex education program?
well, I don't think I can answer that, because an abstinence - only "sex education program" is an oxymoron.
abstinence can only be a choice if you have all the facts.
I love this country.
I love the fact that you guys have a constitution, that you practice separation of church and state.
but I don't think I'm alone in wondering what's going on with all that right now, and, um, in my opinion, right now america could use a lot more people like Molly.
the whole world could.
judge Tate's decision is imminent.
my recommendation would be to settle this now.
get out while you can.
we don't want out.
judge Tate is not going to insert herself into what is clearly a school matter.
consider Mr. Michael's testimony.
judge Tate certainly will.
not to mention, all the negative media attention has to be getting to you.
just wait until George does his press conference.
that's a good point, sir.
you know what? This isn't worth it.
enough is enough.
we'll reinstate Molly, all right?
No!
I did this to make a point.
I want the school to have a real sex education program.
we've been through this. There's no way.
I'm sorry, Molly, but the school can't have a sex ed program that doesn't receive federal funding.
well, actually, I think I know how we can raise that kind of money in one night.
a hero arises.
Molly, how fast can you get a message out?
six seconds.
there are other avenues we can pursue
other angles, more money.
everyone has a price.
we could appeal to his mother.
she may see things our way.
no, I...
I think we all know I'm getting exactly what I deserve.
judge...
use what time you have left.
reach out. Make contact with your son.
no, I'm...
I'm done using other people for my benefit.
then do it for his.
his testimony was proof.
he needs to let go of some of that anger.
otherwise, he'll end up...
just like "the boil"?
you make a persuasive argument, Taylor.
and thank you both for everything.
nice picture, Mr. Dowd.
when was this picture taken?
uh, this summer.
and this man with the familial resemblance would be your... uncle?
your much older brother?
because I know there's no way it's your deceased father.
I used to think that you were actually a human being, but you are a pig.
okay, I lied.
in court!
Oh, come on. I wasn't under oath.
I was trying to win a case.
anyway, how relevant is it whether or not my father's alive?
it's extremely relevant, because that is why I slept with you!
Oh, come on.
you didn't have such a bad time last night.
the quality of the time is irrelevant, because last night was a drunken, stupid mistake.
any chance we can make the same drunken mistake again tonight?
not even the slightest. - Okay.
if you change your mind - I won'T.
interesting.
your new "office."
well, square footage - wise, it's an improvement.
erything ready for tonight - insurance, security, lighting rentals?
Yeah, one of the perks of having a client roster as big as the phone book.
can I help you with something, sir?
I came by to...
apologies are difficult for a man like me.
but gratitude - you helped me, sir.
what I mean is...
it's been some time since a case has made me, well, feel something.
I can see why you've been finding your new calling so fulfling.
plus you got to meet George Michael.
you don't think he noticed, do you?
it was barely obvious, sir.
I discovered his music back in the early years of this firm.
I was stuck on this hellacious document production
just me and a roomful of files working past midnight for three weeks.
I'd stay so late, it was just me and the cleaning crew.
and... one of them had a boom box, and all he played was...
most nights, that was music was the only thing that kept me going.
I still associate it with my better days.
I doubt those days really were better.
they were.
and now as I enter the waning side of my life...
losing everything...
is like the sun going down on me." sorry.
thank you, Eli.
this has been the best week I've had in a long time.
you all right?
I may be getting there.
look, I should have told you about Beth.
and, um, I should've - Nate, shut up.
you didn't do anything...
except the girl I lost my virginity to.
Yeah.
is it gonna be weird between us? - No.
I'm used to weird by now.
and you're my brother, and even when I want to poke out your eyeballs...
I still love you.
so...
I've been thinkin'...
Japaksa. He's our guy.
sure about that?
if you are.
you're the doctor, and I trust you.
then he's the one we're picking.
and I'm sticking around to make sure he's the right choice.
are you, uh, sure you want to do this?
I have never been more sure of anything in my life.
is he gonna be okay?
Jordan? He's gonna be fine.
well, you did a good thing this week, Eli.
you're the one doing the good thing, George.
a high school football stadium's kind of a step down from the Staples center, but it means the world to these kids.
well, you know, these days you just have to do - what you can to try and make a difference, don't you? - Yeah.
can I give you a bit of advice?
if anyone could.
I know I've had my share of hits, but I've taken a few hits, too.
and, uh, if there's anything I've learned, it's that no matter what, you just have to keep going.
do you know what I mean?
I think I do. - Good.
well, that's settled, then.
ladies and gentlemen
Mr. George Michael!
come on, frank. Old movie, popcorn--it'll be fun.
Eli, I can't help but notice, we--we seem to be spending a lot of time together lately and
are you breaking up with me?
look, if you're lonely... - I'm not lonely.
I have this patient-- fun, great personality...
Hey, if I wanted to spend three hours having a long, uncomfortable conversation full of awkward pauses,
I'd go out for a meal with my mother.
what's she seeing you for anyway?
Acupuncturistclient privilege, dude. - Come on.
she's trying to quit smoking. Did I mention she's almost a nonsmoker?
I'm not interested.
maybe just give her a call.
Eli, she's innocent.
who's innocent, patti?
down in front! - What?
Yeah, sure thing. I'll tell him.
the next joint? - Yeah, sure.
Patti, where are you? I've been trying you all morning.
don't worry. Everything's fine.
I just--I-I wanted to ask you something.
I see you're not at your desk.
this is gonna sound peculiar, but I was wondering if maybe you needed my help.
hold on. Slow down. What? Come on.
you're not making any sense. - Patti. Patti!
well, I'm leaving now. I'll see you there.
is everything all right? - I'm taking a sick day.
are you okay? Who were you talking to?
Angela's roommate.
angela was arrested. - Angela was arrested?
another D. U.I? - Wh-- another D. U.I?
repeat what someone says one more time...
two weeks ago, angela got pinched for a D. U.I.
I got it kicked, but apparently...
she got arrested again?
the cops came to her apartment.
they handcuffed her and dragged her out like a criminal.
now please, I have got to get to bryant street.
we're coming with you.
uh, you asked for my help, so...
no, I didn'T.
well, obviously you need some help, and you know two great attorneys who would love to help you, so we're coming with you, okay? Come on.
huevos rancheros?
I see your pregnancy cvings have taken a dramatic turn for the spicy.
actually, you're the one who was supposed to be eating them at your breakfast meeting with jorge navarro.
was that this morning?
well, now it's tomorrow morning.
just make sure and mention how painful it was when your crown fell out.
it's not like you to forget a meeting, dad.
these days I'm burning my candle at both ends.
between a full day of depositions and financial meetings,
I must put in an appearance at the osterhagen benefit luncheon.
could I interest you in a half-baked speech followed by squab?
couldn't interest ellen in that one, huh?
no, not this time.
well, you know how I love a good squab, but matt and I are going to find out what's going on in here.
Yes, the sonogram.
are you gonna find out the sex?
it's a little too early to find out whether you could buy it a baseball mitt.
it's never too early for that.
case number 0-8-1-2-1-9-7-2, people V. Scott.
what's he doing here?
helping you, angie. We both are.
Keith bennett and eli stone of wethersby, stone & associates for the defendant, your honor.
waive reading, plead not guilty.
actually, keith, I think u're gonna want to hear the charges on this.
defendant is chargedwith three counts each of felony drug theft and narcotics trafficking.
the defendant stole fentanyl, a highly addictive and powerful synthetic opiate from a teaching hospital where she is a medical student.
our plea still tands. Not guilty on all charges. Move to release on recognizance.
she's charged with six major drug felonies, for which she faces very significant prison time.
she's not going anywhere. I'll vouch for that.
like you vouched last time?
all right, I'm setting bail at $500, 000 cash or bond.
I'll post the bond myself.
very sporting of you, mr. Stone.
she's innocent, judge.
save it for your closing.
???? I am not a drug trafficker.
we believe you, angela.
mom?
Yes, of course, sweetheart.
why do they think you stole the drugs?
I don't know. It's all lies.
so you've never been in the drug supply room at your hospital?
of course I have. I work at a hospital.
it's what I do every day, at least a dozen times a day.
do you remember anything about the night they say you stole the fentanyl?
I checked out 20 milligram-prednisone tablets for S. Henderson's arthritis, 100 micrograms of levothyroxine for mr. Flynn's thyroid condition, and 600 milligrams of l-dopa for mr. Zachry's parkinson'S.
those are some pretty specific memories for something you do every day, at least a dozen times a day.
gee, keith, maybe a good memory's one of the reasons I'm a student at one of the top medical schools in the country.
it's true. She has a memory like an elephant.
so the school suspended and investigated you, the police arrested you, the D. A.'S prosecuting you-- all for no reason?
I don't know what their reason is.
I just know I'm not guilty.
it's not your job to figure out what their case here is.
it's ours.
Taylor, hi. Congratulations.
Thanks, dr. Lenz.
and you must be...
who are you?
a friend. - Uh, boyfriend.
our relationship's sort of undefined.
uh, basically I'm the guy not important enough to leave on the intake form.
well, he's the biological father.
that makes you plenty important. - Thank you.
ready to see your baby?
should I turn away if you guys want to look down...
right.
Oh, my god.
see there? That's your baby's heart.
that's unbelievable.
everything looks perfect.
you two done good.
perfect timing. - You wanted to see me, paul?
Maggie dekker, meet ashley cardiff.
nice to meet you.
as you know, cardiff refineries is one of our firm's biggest clients.
that's my father and grandfather.
but ashley doesn't have the same family sweet tooth, since she has asked us to set up a charitable trust for arctic wildlife damaged by her family's pipeline.
well, not every woman likes to eat moose burgers and shoot polar bears.
no. Good for you.
Paul, could I talk to you for a second? - Yeah.
excuse us.
when mr. Posner and ms. Klein brought me to this firm and put me in charge of the pro bono department, they agreed that I could prioritize my own cases.
is it possible we're sleeping together, ms. Dekker, and I don't know it?
no.
so why would you think I care very much about what you like or dislike?
I am the assigning partner.
you will do this, and yowill do this to the best of your...
well, whatever ability mr. Posner sees in you.
this job sucks.
cardiff refineries treats the environment like a port-a-potty, and now i have to help daughter warbucks buy her way to a conscience.
I mean, what is it about the rich that makes them think that they can just buy their way into being good people?
probably the tons of money.
you notice whenever the press writes about her, they call her the "heiress" ashley cardiff?
that's what she does. that's--that's her job.
heiress.
you didn't hear a word of that just now.
Taylor and i went to the doctor today.
is the baby all right?
Yeah. Yeah. Seeing the little heart go...
it's really in there.
that's a good day, matt.
Yeah, it should have been. it was... Really strange.
whatever the hell taylor and i are, it would have been nice to know before going in for something like that.
it couldn't have been more uncomfortable.
maybe it would help if you... Defined things.
I asked her to marry me. don't worry. She said no.
I was trying to do the right thing.
she doesn't need you to do the right thing, spike.
she just wants you to love her.
that's all any woman wants, really.
that hasn't been????
but i do have those feelings for her.
and in the sense that you've said the words "i love you"?
not in so many words...particularly, those specific words.
Matt, she's having your baby.
don't you think that she might want to hear the actual three little words?
Yeah, i know, it's just, those actual three little words are... Big.
you're gonna be a father, matt. it's all big from here on out.
all right, let's get back to work.
I've told you and eli everything i know.
I'll tell you when you've told us everything you know.
so did you tell my mom?
about how you think i was doing cocaine the night i was pulled over?
all right, for the record, it wasn't me who suspected you of doing coke. it was in your blood work.
and, no, i didn't tell patti. attorney client.
Plus, what she knows about you... Isn't my business.
did you tell eli?
what he knows about you is very much my business.
did you also tell him that the test results returned a false positive?
I told him that's what you told me. he even believed it.
it's the truth!
Yeah, well, your denials carried a lot more weight before you got popped for possession with intent.
so you do think i'm guilty.
I worked ten plus years in the public defender's office.
most of my clients were guilty as charged, but not one of 'em ever got anything less than my "a" game.
well, aren't you a big man?
I didn't say i was-- - i'm not finished.
I want you to believe in me, not some principle.
and if you can't do that, well, then you can go to hell.
I saw you yawn. there should be no yawning on my daughter's case.
Ah, don't worry. i yawned because i'm tired, not because i'm bored.
how are things looking?
good.
shaky.
the d. a.--um, she can make this case.
I-I've seen people go to jail on a lot weaker evidence.
but their case has holes, and i'll make them wider.
okay.
how are you holding up?
I went to church... this morning to pray for angela.
my girl is my reason for being.
everything in my life has been for her life, and, um...
now they're saying she's a junkie, and, um...thief.
I want to believe her. - we're gonna get through this, patti.
Oh, i'm not crying because of that.
I got the message.
what message were you talking about? - from you.
the voice mail asking me if i needed help before i found out that angela was arrested. you knew i needed help before i did.
did you get a message, too?
like--like with the earthquake or when you saved jordan?
Yeah.
and it told you to--to help angela? - not just that, patti, it...
told me...that angela is innocent.
she is? - she is.
well, then you get to work and do as you're told.
Yes, ma'am. - oh.
are stored in automated pyxis machines, which require a fingerprint i. d. To open.
access to the machine and each individual drug are automatically recorded in a log.
I imagine that the drug the defendant is charged with stealing--fentanyl
is accessed routinely by many doctors in your hospital.
Yes, but miss scott was the only one to withdraw fentanyl without a m. a.r.
a medical administration record.
which means what?
she wasn't accessing the drug for a specific patient.
is that the only reason you had to suspend miss scott?
Angela's behavior had become increasingly erratic, her grades were in decline, and she was persistently stressed and moody.
these are classic signs of drug dependency.
so angela scott is the only person in your ntire hospital who is stressed and moody?
it sounds like disneyland is in danger of losing its distinction of being "the happiest place on earth.
object to the sarcasm.
I'm sorry, your honor. i was going for ridicule.
is it your testimony that angela scott was the only doctor seen removing fentanyl from the pyxis machine on the three nights in question?
in point of fact, no one actually witnessed the fentanyl being removed.
sounds like an ironclad case.
that was sarcasm, your honor.
your next witness, miss jarrells.
the people call s. f.p. d. Officer jerome sawyer
objection.
officer sawyer recently arrested the defendant on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.
objection. Move to strike. - move for a mistrial.
evidence of prior bad acts is not even remotely admissible.
it is, to establish motive.
we believe that the defendant traded the fentanyl for cocaine, which was indicated in the d. u.i. Blood test.
she's saying this crap in front of the jury, your honor.
move for a mistrial.
I can't do that, mr. Bennett, because the a. d.a. Is right on this.
the prior charge and the blood test go to motive and are therefore admissible.
are you doing cocaine?
the night of my d. u.i. there was a party after exams, and someone had coke.
I had never tried it before. i know. i know it was a mistake.
and getting behind the wheel of a car --that was another mistake.
I am so sorry, eli.
I know how disappointing this all is, but it--it was just one time, one night. It's not who i am, and it doesn't mean i stole those drugs, which i didn't.
please, don't give up on me. please?
I-I know you didn't do this, but i also know that we're gonna lose this trial unless you stop fighting us and start fighting back.
Sean binder. that--that's who gave me the coke.
would he have had access to the fentanyl?
Yes, definitely.
I'll bring h in for a chat.
you don't like me, do you?
what? no. No.
well, i mean, we--we just met, but no, you seem... Lovely.
dad said he liked this firm because there were good lawyers who were good liars.
I'm used to people not liking me, miss dekker.
um, excuse me. i have to take this.
wealthy heiress, life of leisure, a father who's been ravaging the environment, and now she's trying to buy a conscience by giving away some of her ill-gotten gains.
truth be told, i wouldn't like me either.
sorry.
good news?
Oh, it's just. Private.
he's been trying to find the perfect moment to finally tell his pregnant girlfriend he loves her.
it's just, for taylor, i need to go epic.
I don't remember the last time a guy wanted to go epic for me.
her favorite singer's in town for a concert, but it's completely and predictably sold out.
and i've even been bidding for a pair of tickets on ebay, but i have a feeling the guy with the e-mail "sealtixordeath
seal--heidi's husband?
I could call her for you.
Heidi klum? - yeah.
you--you would do that for me? - is this one worth it?
surprisingly, yes.
if there's one thing i've learned, you can't buy love, but you can, at the very least, comp house seats.
start liking her. - heidi, hi.
this is very awkward.
I got a call from ted broden in accounting, and since we were tightening our belts, he cautioned me against using the company credit card to book a hotel room.
I didn't know what he was talking about at first until i realized he'd called the wrong wethersby.
and you thought i was using firm money to finance a pied- -terre for extramarital activities.
honestly, that was only one of two possibilities i could think of, and i was sort of hoping there was a ...third better explanation.
I'm sorry, but there isn't.
I have been living in a hotel of late.
daddy.
your stepmother and i came to the mutual decision to take some time apart.
I'm so sorry, dad.
after my accident, things were better than they'd been in some time, as if we both realized we'd been given a second chance at marital bliss.
but as i've been--i hope the word is "evolving
Ellen and i have...drifted.
dad, why don't you come and stay with me tonight?
it should come as no surprise that i'm not the sort of man to "crash" at anyone's pad, but thank you for the offer.
can i at least offer you a hug?
that would be gratefully accepted.
who are you?
his name's mark young. nice offices.
Where's sean binder? - we don't need sean binder.
Yes, we do. Angela-- - lied, eli, again, as usual.
so what does he have to do with angela's case?
tell him.
this is like attorney client secrets time, right?
I had to ask all of five people on campus how to find you.
you think the d. a. Can't or won't do the exact same thing?
or should i ring him up right now, save him the legwork?
I'm ange's dealer.
at least i was till she ran out of bank.
and i was gonna cut her off, but then she offered something to trade.
the fentanyl.
Yeah, the stuff's like gold on the street.
show him.
angela called him a dozen times last month. Look.
get outta here.
we need to try and plead this.
what if he's covering for someone else or setting her up?
what the hell's - you don't know her, keith.
she's a drug addict, eli. no one knows her anymore.
I'm not looking to hurt angela, all right? I like her.
I thought maybe even we...
look, i know you want her not to have done this, but as her friend, as her lawyer, you--you can't ignore the truth just because you wish it wasn't so.
why do you still believe her?
it was...revealed to me.
revealed? - mm-hmm.
um, i know you believe certain things, and--and that's--that's fine...
so long as it doesn't prevent you from seeing what's right in front of your face.
Angela's guilty, and if you can't see that, then we can't help her.
didn't i tell you not to show up here again until you called that girl whose number i gave you?
well, sorry. I, uh, had a lot on my plate.
finding out that patti's daughter is a drug dealer with a coke habit hasn't really left me much time for blind dating, so...
well, i'm sorry, eli, but you're not gonna like or even understand every message you're tasked to deliver.
well, that sucks.
this is gonna destroy patti.
I swore to her that angela was innocent, but she's not.
how do i deliver that message?
Patti's strong. she'll persevere. she has family. She has you.
Yeah, i'm not sure how much good having me is doing anyone.
anyone who gets close to me gets kicked in the spiritual ass.
wait a second. is that why you don't want to go out on this date?
I-I don't need any more soul-broken people on my conscience.
Eli, you've helped a lot of people through some hard times.
what, like, uh, taylor? i helped her by breaking off our engagement. Hmm?
or maybe you meant maggie, who i helped out of her engagement and the firm.
or grace, who i helped out of the country.
you think any of those people think that they're better off for the full and total eli stone experience?
I do.
it's about connecting.
I've always been connected to patti.
she hasn't just recently believed in eli the prophet.
she has always believed in just eli
Eli the lawyer, eli the jerk, eli, the friend who is family.
I violated her trust.
I still can't believe you got these tickets.
well, stone's not the only one who can perform miracles.
besides, i know a guy who knows a guy who knows seal.
it's the best gift. thank you.
Yeah. Well, you're most welcome.
I wanted tonight to be special.
and why is that?
to tell you...
every night with you is special.
careful. that almost sounded sensitive.
I know this thing of ours hasn't unfolded in t recommended... Order.
we've skipped some beats.
pole-vaulted over beats, actually, but, um, just because it's happened quickly...
doesn't mean it hasn't happened.
I love you, taylor.
ladies and gentlemen, seal.
what do you want me to say, matt?
uh, i don't know. i guess i was expecting--call this crazy
an "i love you, too." that's usually how this goes.
it does when the other person feels it, but i...
I just don't know if i do, and i-i don't think it's fair to say those words--even
even with your child inside me--if...
they're not what i feel.
you're the dude.
what?
a hot pregnant dude, sure, but in our relationship, you're the dude.
okay, i don't--i don't know what that's supposed to mean.
I'm actually the mature one here, which is another first for me.
but it's you...
you're the one who's afraid to share her feelings.
U're the one who keeps pushing me away.
well, surprise, surprise, i'm in touch with my feminine side.
maybe you should get in touch with yours. hope you liked the concert.
Matt. - what's with the face?
the faces? Who died?
does this have anything to do with angela?
Patti, uh, i made a mistake.
angela is not-- - no.
uh, she stole the drugs from the hospital. - no!
she gave them to a dealer named mark young to clear up a drug debt.
your daughter has a substance abuse problem.
that's not possible, eli. you told me...
you said he told you
I'm sorry, patti. you know, i-i love angie.
I didn't want to believe it either.
believe what?
you look me in the eye, and you tell me the truth, so help you god!
am i on the witness stand now?
did you talk to sean binder?
he's the one who-- - stop lying!
now you need help, baby, but first, you need to stop lying.
okay, mom.
your daughter's a drug addict.
she loves getting high.
this is not you. this--this isn't you.
how would you know, mom?
you don't know anything about me.
all you ever saw was what you wanted me to be, needed me to be.
God, the pressure you put on me to be perfect!
I'm not raising ordinary kids.
like you're so special. you're a damn secretary.
Yes, i'm a secretary who worked my ass off, taking crap year after year, weekends, nights, so you could get opportunities i never even dreamed of.
I didn't ask for any of it! - you didn't have to ask for it.
I'm your mother. - i didn't ask for that either!
if you werehalfthe mother you think you are...
you would know how unhappy i am.
how...how unhappy i've been for a long time.
but you didn't want to see it...
because of your own problem, mom.
I guess this apple didn't fall far from the tree.
What'd she mean by...
she meant both of us never needed you more and were never more wrong to put our faith in you.
Eli. - hey.
I thought i was the only one here.
you're here late.
I prefer the office to be empty before i indulge in my obsession with internet backgammon.
and why are you burning the midnight oil?
I've been trying her all night, and she doesn't pick up or won't.
she has your home number, i'm sure.
used to think that nothing could get to her.
but today, she was... she was gotten to.
I'm not in the habit of breaking confidences, eli, but you know i love patti as much as you do.
and given the manner and magnitude of her daughter's troubles, you should know something.
she has a problem, too?
Yes.
alcohol was her particular vice. - "was"--you mean, to my knowledge. This was years ago, before you joined the firm, back when she was my secretary.
her work had deteriorated, when she even came to work.
one afternoon, i received a phone call from a local bar.
Patti had overstayed her welcome.
I went down there and found her inebriated.
I told her she had to get help, or i'd fire her.
so she got help then?
I believe the term is "dry, not sober.
she just stopped drinking.
and you think that what's happening with angela has maybe...
pushed her off the wagon?
I think recovery programs give addicts tools to rely on to get them through difficult times--tools...
Patti may not have.
you don't remember the name of that bar, do you?
why do i get the feeling...
you're not just going to the gym? - get away from me, keith.
you gonna send eli the bond he'll forfeit when you jump bail?
or how about at least an address so your
your mom knows which city morgue to collect your body at?
I'm not going to prison.
you think that's the worst thing that can happen to you?
wrong.
you take off, things are only gonna get worse.
w--your mom's right. you are not yourself right now.
so tell me, which angela do you want to be?
the druggiskell who blames her mother for her mistakes or the woman with brains and--and spirit, the woman who scored a-a scholarship to the best med school in the state, the woman i know can find her way through this.
look, all the lies you told, i never believed you, but that's not the same thing as not believing in you.
this is not court, keith, okay?
a pretty speech is not gonna fix this.
no, and you got a lot to fix.
but i know you can.
just stop...stop trying to prove me wrong.
what?
what can i get for ya? - her tab.
well, it's been a long time since a man bought me a drink.
how gallant.
so...
did jordan open his big mouth, or did god send a vision i needed a designated driver?
Billy ocean got that hit about driving a car.
how many times did i talk to you about my father? about his drinking problem?
why did you think i wouldn't understand?
I am not a drunk, eli.
in case you haven't noticed, i am having a bad week.
I don't need you coming here uninvited, trying to make me feel worse, when all i'm doing is trying to make myself feel a little better.
so how's that working out for ya?
my daughter... - is in trouble, a world of it.
she has a drug problem, and she may go to prison.
she needs you now. but... Not like this.
she was right, eli.
It's--it's--it's my fault.
I pushed her too much. and look at me.
I'm a fraud.
I am a fraud.
she must have felt so alone.
I left my baby alone.
this isn't her fault, none of it.
it's mine.
eli...she's innocent.
I've been angry and--and confused...real angry.
but i'm not anymore, 'cause...
cause i get it now.
all the people that i've been asked to help, all those, uh, strangers...
now i get to help someone that i love.
and i really want to help you, patti.
but you--you gotta want my help.
probation, following rehab.
2, 000 hours community service at the free medical clinic in the mission district.
but no jail? - no jail.
what about medical school?
golden state won't take her back, but if angela really wants to be a doctor, she'll find a way.
how did you manage all this, eli?
when i was a public defender, i represented a bad guy accused of cutting up his girlfriend.
jarrells was the d. a. The cops couldn't find the knife.
I got the case tossed.
what does that got to do with angela's case?
the cops recently received an anonymous tip with the knife's whereabouts.
the d. a. Was grateful.
so we accept the terms? - yes. Yes.
thank you... Both.
thank you.
I'm so sorry for what i said.
I didn't mean those things.
it's okay...even if you did.
some of it is true.
I love you, angela...
so much that my teeth hurt sometimes.
okay. you're not a child anymore, and i cannot fix all of your problems, especially when i have some big ones of my own.
so... Maybe we help each other.
you were right about angela... the whole time.
I should have trusted your instincts.
who could blame you? you know, it's hard to compete with the big guy.
Yeah. maybe god could be a little less indirect next time.
actually, i meant john lennon.
I'll tell you, though, what i wouldn't give to see what you see just once.
Eli, care to join me for dinner?
Oh, uh, actually, i...
I'm just--i'm going on a blind date.
Mm. - i...
makes sense. I appear to have run out of daughters and associates for you to romance.
are you okay?
it's just--i've--i've noticed lots of late nights, and you got nothing better to do than grab a bite with me.
Ellen and i have separated.
Wow.
sorry. I... Uh, is there anything i can do?
a tale of woe for another night.
you have someone waiting.
and, eli, when you and i do grab a bite, it won't be because i have nothing better to do.
you're speechless. it's gotta be a first.
I think we've said or not said all there is to say or not say.
what you said last night--it--it couldn't have been easy taking a chance like that, and i'm sorry, i am so sorry, i couldn't take that leap with you.
like you said, you can't say what you don't feel.
no, but i should have said what i am ??
I should have said that i...
don't know if i love you...yet.
Yeah, there's a reason no one's ever written a hit song called "i don't know if i love you yet.
I'm my father's daughter, matt.
sharing my feelings with someone is very difficult for me.
and the one time i actually did truly open my heart to someone, he... Broke off our engagement.
and then came "the dowd
a guy i didn't even think i'd give a drawer to in my apartment, and...
it's taken me a while to make that switch...
but i'm making it.
I only know one thing, that you and me...
but especily me...
we're never gonna survive unless...
we get a little crazy.
how'd you...
I tell you plainly, you will be murdered.
every Catholic in England is a potential assassin!
be warned by the atrocities in France.
we know the Catholics take their orders from Spain.
the Spanish speak openly of Mary Stuart
as Queen of England in waiting.
their loyalty is to the pope in Rome!
how many Catholics are there in England, sir?
immense numbers, Majesty.
half the nation cling to the old superstitions.
what would you have me do?
hang half the people of England or just imprison them?
we must act, Majesty.
our inaction is perceived as weakness.
if my people break the law, they shall be punished.
until that day, they shall be protected.
Majesty, we have proven reason to fear every Catholic in the...
fear creates fear.
I am not ignorant of the dangers, sir.
but I will not punish my people for their beliefs.
only for their deeds.
I am assured that the people of England love their Queen.
my constant endeavor is to earn that love.
my Queen.
our friends write to give us hope.
soon England's true believers will rise up
against the bastard usurper Elizabeth
and slit her throat.
that's enough!
slit her throat? please.
and when that bastard usurper is dead, my lady will be Queen.
your bishops are preaching that God is showing his displeasure.
because the Queen is still unmarried,
some rudely suggesting infertile.
what nonsense.
dangerous nonsense.
Mary Stuart has a son.
why does everyone torment me with Mary Stuart?
it's not her fault she's next in line to the throne.
don't hide your face.
so long as you have no issue.
if you were to produce an heir,
there'd be no more talk of Mary, Queen of Scots.
I've heard it's customary to obtain a husband before producing an heir.
we shall have to hunt out a husband for you soon, Bess.
not too soon, my lady.
there are husbands to be had.
you don't want to be married?
I'll want to be married if I want the man...
Austria. France.
turkey. Turkey has a Sultan. China has an Emperor.
I confine myself to the possible.
that's where you and I differ, Walsingham.
I find the impossible far more interesting.
what kind of man would you want?
an honest man with friendly eyes.
and good legs, and sweet breath.
so you can kiss him without choking.
there must be any amount of princes
in the undiscovered lands across the sea.
find me an honest one of those.
since when do we discuss private matters in public spaces?
I ask your Majesty's forgiveness.
have my doctors confirm that the Queen is still fertile.
the people need to be reassured.
I care for your safety.
the threats to your person are real.
you know very well if I fall,
you'll all come tumbling down after me.
the sea wall at Dover is cracking, Francis.
we have no money to rebuild our defenses.
turn your mind to that threat.
may we have wisdom not to fear shadows in the night.
and courage when the day of danger truly dawns.
my time has come, Majesty.
send me back to England to begin God's work.
your Majesty.
guards! Take hold of him!
a puddle in the way,
Majesty.
a puddle.
puddle.
you'll have to see the Lord Chamberlain, sir.
which one is he?
he's over there.
you can't come in.
so how am I to see him if you won't let me through?
you must wait for him to come out.
and when will he come out?
there's no way of knowing that.
I had less trouble than this boarding a Spanish ship.
what if enemy ships should sail up the Thames, can the docks be closed?
not closed, Majesty, but the gun positions...
Spanish...
ambassador.
king Eric of Sweden, Majesty.
not again.
still madly in love with you.
still mad, you mean.
Ivan, Tsar of all the Russias.
Where's Bess?
known as "Ivan the terrible," Majesty.
late.
I beg your Majesty's forgiveness.
given.
once.
the Archduke Charles of Austria, Majesty.
the puddle man is outside, Majesty.
my suitors.
younger brother to Maximilian II, holy Roman Emperor.
cousin of Philip of Spain. wealthy.
he's rather handsome.
how old is he?
young, I believe, Majesty.
an Austrian alliance would keep France quiet.
and put Philip on a leash.
I've become almost enthusiastic.
send for him.
Danke Schon.
how much longer do you think I can play this game, Francis?
virginity is an asset that holds its value well.
Walter Raleigh, Majesty.
your Majesty, this man is a notorious pirate.
spanish gold stolen from Spanish ships, attacked without provocation.
well, sir, what do you want?
I have just returned from the New World, Majesty.
I have claimed the fertile coast in your name
and called it Virginia
in honor of our virgin Queen.
Virginia?
and when I marry, will you change the name to Conjugia?
I ask your gracious permission, Majesty,
to return to the New World with your royal warrant
to found a colony under the laws and protections of England.
he wants money.
who are they?
natives of the Americas, Majesty.
have they no ruler of their own?
none to match England's Queen.
these gentlemen are welcome.
see that they are treated well.
I also come bearing gifts for your Majesty.
these gifts, Majesty, are the fruits of piracy,
the true property of the realm of Spain.
let's see, shall we? What have you brought me?
potato, Majesty.
you eat it, very nourishing.
tobacco.
you breathe its smoke.
very stimulating.
gold.
courtesy of a Spanish ship that found itself unable to complete its journey.
forgive me, Majesty.
I find the air has become stale.
I am sensitive to the smell of open sewers.
I cannot accept the fruits of piracy, Mr. Raleigh.
philip of Spain is no friend of England, Majesty.
the more gold I take from him, the safer you will be.
well, well.
a political pirate.
and your Majesty's most loyal subject.
welcome home, Mr. Raleigh. Lord Howard, the docks.
master Raleigh.
you eat it...
you traitor!
Judas!
you're Walsingham's pawn!
don't do this! I didn't say anything!
you're a Protestant traitor!
don't do it! don't!
don't! Hold his head!
you Judas! You Judas! Stop!
you Judas!
the traitor's dead. We must act!
why do we not strike? What are we waiting for?
you wait for my order.
Walsingham knows too much already. One traitor is dead.
who can I trust now?
there's a visitor waiting, sir.
William.
Hello, Francis.
you've always been a fellow who delighted in surprises.
you look well, Francis.
well, you look dreadful. They're not feeding you in Paris.
you can't learn the secrets of the universe on an empty stomach.
Mary. William. Supper is ready.
William.
have you spoken to the Queen?
I speak with the Queen daily.
you work too hard. You're a sick man.
William, come over here and sit by me.
William, if we are not allowed to sin,
maybe we could talk theology.
you have done enough. No man could do more.
I can't leave the court yet, Ursula. She needs me.
never listens to me. Not a thought for his health.
so you talk to him, he's your brother.
William, what do they say in Paris about the Pope's call for holy war?
many welcome it.
why must we talk about war?
tell us your nice news, William.
are you married yet? Not yet.
Mary, would you leave William alone, please?
sweet, sit.
grace?
Oh, Lord, provider of all things,
we offer thee our humble thanks.
in the name of the holy trinity, Amen.
Amen.
more lines on my face.
where do they come from?
smile lines, my lady.
smile lines?
when do I ever smile?
now you have smile lines, too.
Archduke Charles... the beauty of your Majesty
is dazzling to my eyes.
I am overwhelmed.
I am conquered.
I die.
only your love,
my stattlich Elizabeth,
can restore me into life.
your highness does me great honor.
Oh, Elizabeth.
how blessed am I to stand in your fabled presence.
Ah, Elizabeth.
to speak your name is to hear celestial music.
may that sweet sound
guide me through my life to come, Elizabeth.
I have traveled here to this illustrious court
in the hope that our two great nations
might be joined in love.
he interests me.
talk to him.
him, my lady?
him.
I adore the natives you brought. I don't suppose you could get one for me.
they're not dangerous, are they?
that depends on what you propose to do with them.
I'd dress him up in mulberry colored silk,
and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak.
I have a secret, my dear.
I pretend there's a pane of glass,
eine glasscheibe between me and them.
they can see me, but they cannot touch me.
you should try it.
Majesty, I am...
it is something, after all,
to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city.
which you will no doubt name after yourself.
no doubt.
may I ask a question in return?
of course.
how am I to win the Queen's favor?
why should I tell you that?
I've little enough to offer, but whatever I have to give,
ask, and it's yours.
say what you mean to say as plainly as possible.
all men flatter the Queen in hope of advancement.
pay her the compliment of truth.
I don't even know your name.
Elizabeth Throckmorton.
a second Elizabeth?
everyone calls me Bess.
your most serene Majesty, bright star of our firmament,
we present our humble masque of the heavenly spheres.
his highness is tired after his long journey.
no man can become tired
in the presence of so lovely a Queen.
his highness, the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him.
he will retire to his private chambers to rest.
I don't want him hurt by your schemes.
so how should we proceed?
perhaps we should all retire.
I suspect him of being a professional charmer.
am I right?
he is certainly charming, my lady.
well, there are duller professions.
you like him, don't you?
he's a man that lives in a world far beyond the court.
it's refreshing.
we shall let him come again.
blue.
can you imagine what it is to cross an ocean?
for weeks, you see nothing but the horizon, perfect and empty.
you live in the grip of fear.
fear of storms.
fear of sickness on board.
fear of the immensity.
so you must drive that fear down deep into your belly.
study your charts.
watch your compass.
pray for a fair wind.
and hope,
pure,
naked,
fragile
hope.
Majesty, the Archduke and court are waiting.
let them wait.
go on, Mr. Raleigh.
you were hoping.
at first, it's no more than a haze on the horizon.
so you watch.
you watch.
then it's a smudge,
a shadow on the far water.
for a day.
for another day.
the stain slowly spreads along the horizon taking form,
until on the third day, you let yourself believe.
you dare to whisper the word.
land.
land.
life.
resurrection.
the true adventure.
coming out of the vast unknown,
out of the immensity,
into new life.
that,
your Majesty, is the New World.
I like your immensities.
your ocean is an image of eternity, I think.
such great spaces make us small.
do we discover the New World, Mr. Raleigh,
or does the New World discover us?
you speak like a true explorer.
I like you, Mr. Raleigh.
and I like you.
you know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him.
I have heard that.
and what have you to say about it?
reward my mission, Majesty, not me.
is the mission not the man?
then you leave me free to like you in return.
go on.
I think it must be hard for so great a Queen
to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself.
now you grow dull.
come on!
mine.
you have the stronger horse.
yours carries the lighter load.
no.
the Queen does not give way to others.
forgive me, Majesty. My horse doesn't seem to know his place yet.
have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh?
Oh, come on!
it's from her.
Mary Stuart is the heart and soul of our enterprise.
make sure she and only she reads this.
we wait for her order.
the order must be given clearly.
the jailer, Madam.
my noble jailer.
am I a danger to England even when I pray?
as always, Ma'am, my concern is for your safety.
I pray for my cousin Elizabeth.
do you think she prays for me?
is it true?
that I've never known the pleasure of being liked for myself?
I hope you believe I like you for yourself, my lady.
is anyone ever liked simply for themselves? I doubt it.
are you?
men like you because you're pretty,
and because you have the ear of the Queen.
no doubt.
him, too.
he likes you because he wants my favor.
you do realize that.
Yes, my lady.
and the other thing, too, of course.
but then, all men want that.
male desire confers no distinction.
Oh, I envy you, Bess.
you're free to have what I cannot have.
you're my adventurer.
thank you for coming.
you mustn't send letters to the palace.
you know what would happen if I was caught.
I need your help.
more money? No.
my father doesn't want to hide like this anymore.
of course.
we both want to get back into favor with the court.
that's impossible.
you know that you're Papists.
why impossible?
everyone at court has a Papist somewhere in their family.
Francis. Just as you have.
speak to the Queen. You are her favorite.
my father and I will embrace the new faith.
cousin Bess. No.
we have known each other all our lives.
I would do nothing to harm you.
why can't you help us? They will kill us!
Oh. Do not tease me, Mr. Raleigh.
there's nothing I'd like to do more.
so why don't you?
all right, then. I will.
you see? You lie.
you don't want me on your ship at all. You're a lier.
Bess, would you like to go to sea?
I'm afraid that's not possible.
women bring bad luck on board ship.
do they?
lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room
for months at a time.
men have needs.
a beautiful woman would drive us all mad.
men have needs?
let them stay on land and see to their needs.
Mr. Raleigh is eager to sail away to his maiden colony.
we must persuade him to stay a little longer. Mustn't we, ladies?
Bess?
No!
wait! What do you want? Who are you?
let me go, damn it! Who the hell are you?
if you won't assist me, perhaps your father will.
no.
enough.
enough.
enough.
yes?
you cannot save England now.
the enterprise has begun.
ambassador?
what do you know of the enterprise of England?
the enterprise? Forgive me, Majesty, I'm not familiar...
two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and Norfolk.
Mary Stuart is to be set free and placed on the English throne,
and I am to be assassinated.
does any of this sound familiar?
I know nothing of any invasion plans...
well, I refer to this plan as the enterprise of England,
it should more accurately be called La Empresa De Inglaterra
because it is a Spanish plan.
the plan of my one-time brother-in-law,
your king, to attack my country.
your country? It is my country that is under attack.
your so-called piratas, your pirates attack our merchant ships daily.
and you... you think we don't know where the orders come from?
the whole world knows these pirates sail up the Thames,
all the way to your royal bed.
you will leave my presence, sir.
go back to your rat hole.
tell Philip I fear neither him, nor his priests, nor his armies.
tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us,
we're ready to give him such a bite,
he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets.
you see a leaf fall and you think you know which way the wind blows.
well, there is a wind coming, Madam,
that will sweep away your pride.
I, too, can command the wind, sir!
I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!
what are you staring at?
lower your eyes. I am the Queen!
you are not my equal, sir, and you never will be!
the alignments of the planets is most unusual this year.
mars is due to take the ascendant
three days after the anniversary of your Majesty's birth.
and also on that day, there is a full moon,
which governs the fortune of all princes of the female gender.
princes of the female gender.
I mean to say, a prince who is also a woman.
Yes, Dr. Dee, I am following you.
what does it mean?
it means the rise of a great Empire, Majesty, and the fall of another.
convulsions.
which empire is to rise and which is to fall?
that I cannot say, Majesty.
astrology is, as yet, more an art than a science.
nothing more, Dr. Dee?
no more specific calamities we can guard against?
he means, will I be assassinated?
Walsingham, would you leave us for a moment?
and the private life of this prince of the female gender,
what do the stars foretell there?
these are matters of state, Majesty.
surely the stars foretell matters of state, Dr. Dee.
for such a prediction I must look in a different chart.
wonderful.
such strength.
you will need all your strength in the days to come.
but you doubt yourself, my child.
I have not seen fear in your face for such a long time.
have I reason to fear?
something has weakened you.
there are hard days coming.
but I am no prophet.
I see no more than the shadows of ghosts.
visitor, sir.
sorry to come aboard your ship
without permission, Mr. Raleigh.
welcome aboard.
the Queen wishes to see you.
she asks me to assure you...
I need no assurances, Bess.
I'm no courtier, never have been.
then you should say so in person.
this is my life, Bess.
this is where I belong.
it seems to be a lonely life.
sometimes, but it's the life I've chosen.
I understand.
you ask permission to go.
Yes, Majesty.
you plan to return to your colony
for two, maybe three, four years.
if your Majesty grants me your royal warrant.
that is a long time.
there's nothing for me here.
at sea, I know what I'm to do. I know the risks.
here... No, you're wrong.
you're needed here.
as captain of my personal guard.
captain of your guard?
kneel.
Majesty.
I said, kneel.
sir Walter Raleigh.
well, you may express your gratitude.
this is too great an honor.
if it's so great an honor, why are you staring at your boots?
you know why.
now you stare at the wall.
am I so hideous you can't even look me in the face?
why do you speak like a fool
when you are anything but a fool?
fool?
Yes, I am a vain and foolish woman.
and you, you... you come here
as if from another time, and I've...
you have real adventures. You go where the maps end, and I'd...
I would follow you there if I could. Believe me.
the storm clouds are gathering. You are needed here.
you cannot leave England.
for he that will save his life will lose it.
and he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
lord be with us as the end approaches.
we will not fear the coming of the shadow of death.
sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
I thought I prayed in silence.
you did.
excuse me, sir. I must go to the Queen.
the man who was hanged today...
he was your cousin.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
the last time I saw him,
he needed my help.
I did nothing.
what could you have done?
I don't know.
now he's dead.
I keep seeing his face. I keep seeing his eyes.
believe me, there's nothing that you could have done that would have spared him.
I'm so afraid.
we're all human, Bess.
we do what we can.
your laundress was found to be carrying letters in her washing.
not her job, I think.
how am I to send my intimate letters?
through me and you will read them.
with respectful admiration.
am I to have no privacy?
no.
you disappoint me, sir.
the Queen orders these measures for your protection.
the Queen?
I am a Queen.
they call her the virgin Queen.
why is that, sir?
can it be that no man will have her?
let him throw you round.
be bold, come on, you can trust him.
and jump.
when I bend like this, you take a leap into the air.
das Volta.
I require all my ladies to learn it.
you see how fearless Bess is?
you like your ladies to jump at your command.
do you think that wrong?
no, you are the Queen. You are to be obeyed.
to tell you the truth,
I'm very, very tired of always being in control.
nonsense.
what?
you eat and drink control.
is that so?
Bess.
you should try a dance with Sir Walter.
he's eager to show us his skill.
no skill at all, Majesty. I don't know the steps.
come now.
you stand like this,
with your hands here.
and when she jumps,
on the fifth step,
you lift her.
what could be simpler?
take your position, Sir Walter.
I am to be obeyed.
as your Majesty wishes.
hold her firmly. I don't want her dropped.
play.
six counts.
one, two, three, and lift, down.
leave us.
I want both of them left alone.
madam.
I must reply.
if our forces are in readiness, both within and without the realm, then your Queen commands you to set the gentlemen to work.
I think we have it.
Yes.
let God's work begin.
where have you been?
I met up with some old friends.
from Paris, no doubt.
we haven't seen you for days.
Yes.
now you're back.
do you know, I can still remember the day you were born.
I was 11 years old.
and you, this helpless bundle.
I looked at you in your crib,
with your little, wrinkled face,
and I loved you from the first.
I've failed you, haven't i?
forgive me if I haven't loved you enough.
did you imagine I wouldn't know?
your blessing, Majesty. My little one.
your blessing?
walk on.
the Queen is at her prayers.
go!
Elizabeth is a whore! Mary Stuart is our true Queen!
Elizabeth!
whore!
you bring news?
the Queen has been attacked.
the assassin seized.
the Queen
unharmed.
unharmed?
and you, Ma'am, are to be tried for treason.
me?
what has any of this to do with me?
that's the trouble with intrigues, isn't it?
with so many secrets,
you can never quite be sure who's on whose side till the game ends.
Walsingham has every letter you've written.
traitor.
traitors!
ready to die, I see, Jesuit.
I have done what I was sent to do.
why was the gun not loaded?
I need your help.
I, too, have failed, brother.
what was the Jesuit sent to do?
I told you everything I know.
so kill me.
there's a better world waiting for me.
we'll all be judged in the end, brother.
even you.
William, you're not a martyr.
you weren't even much of a murderer.
I'm going to have you taken to France.
no one will know.
you must never let me hear of you again.
Francis.
Francis!
Francis.
I've never seen her so distressed.
she's been alone in her room since morning. She'll see no one.
has she asked for me?
no.
but she needs you. I know she does.
go to her.
please.
are you here to tell me I must murder a Queen?
I would never presume to tell my Queen what to do.
only you know where your duty lies.
was it my father's duty to murder my mother?
she was a Queen for a time.
Oh, I would be loath to die so bloody a death.
since when were you so afraid?
I'm always afraid.
kill a Queen, and all Queens are mortal.
we mortals have many weaknesses.
we feel too much.
hurt too much.
all too soon we die.
but we do have the chance of love.
do we?
I have given England my life.
must she also have my soul?
Walsingham... Mary Stuart must die!
must? Mary Stuart must die?
where is it written? Who says so? Have I ordered it?
Majesty, this is no time for mercy.
don't preach at me, old man!
look at you. You can hardly stand.
go home to your wife and your bed.
the law must have its way.
by whose authority do you condemn me?
God is my only judge.
the law is for common men, not for princes.
the law, your Majesty, is for the protection of your people.
leave me.
your Majesty. Your Majesty.
you know neither who you are or what you do.
I know who I am.
and if I die, it shall be as I have lived.
as a Queen,
trusting in the mercy of God, my father.
at which hour?
at 8: 00.
tomorrow morning.
it must be stopped!
I want it stopped!
I forgive you with all my heart.
forgive me, Majesty.
I have failed you.
how have you failed me?
what am I to forgive you for?
philip of Spain is a God-fearing man
who cannot declare war without a just cause.
I intercepted every letter Mary Stuart secretly dispatched,
but failed to see that Spain knew I was reading them.
they waited for her to write the words
that would, in my eyes, confirm her treason.
forgive me.
I am trapped in my own web.
and I ordered Mary's execution.
I murdered God's anointed Queen.
and now God's most dutiful son makes holy war to punish me.
we are at war.
who knows when we will meet again?
if we will meet again.
if England falls, my last days will be in a Spanish prison.
to die far from home.
that is the loneliest death.
never.
my thoughts turn dark.
what do you do in a storm
when you're facing your death?
the closer I come to death,
the more I want to live,
the hungrier I am for life.
Yes, to live right to the end.
why be afraid of tomorrow when today is all we have?
I wish...
I have never known a woman like you.
in some other world, in some other time,
could you have loved me?
I know only one world.
and in this world, I have loved you.
there's something you could do for me,
something I have not known for a very long time.
if you felt so inclined.
but it's not to be spoken of afterward.
it must be forgotten.
but just for now...
a kiss?
I die.
I've given Drake the orders
to prepare the fleet to defend the channel.
how soon can you join him?
we're waiting for supplies. We can move as soon as we're ready and armed.
good.
Bess.
I have something to tell you.
I ask for nothing. Is that understood?
your life is your own. Nothing will change.
what is this?
I am... you're with child.
no one knows. My plans are made.
I shall ask the Queen for permission to leave court.
where will you go?
to my mother's house.
I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't court a man without her permission.
I can't marry without her permission.
as for having a child,
your child...
all I know is nothing's as it should be.
please, listen.
you once said to me, "whatever I have to give, ask and it's yours."
do you remember?
of course, I remember.
I ask that you forget me.
go to your ship. Do your duty.
forget me. Bess!
we're summoned,coming.
this Spanish Armada is at sea with an army of 10, 000 men?
and Philip's friend, the Duke of Parma,
has 15, 000 men on the French coast.
they plan to cross the channel in barges and sail into the Thames.
they don't have enough barges yet. We have a little time.
and our forces defend the mouth of the Thames at tilbury with...
what? How... four thousand men?
three thousand, possibly.
if the Spanish fleet unites the barges,
their combined strength will overwhelm us.
then we shall engage them at sea,
before they have the chance to unite.
your Majesty,
this vast Armada will surely smash through our naval defenses
and overrun us on land.
we must prepare for the worst.
I need air.
sir Walter... with this ring, I thee wed.
Bess... with this ring, I thee wed.
with my body, I thee worship.
with my body, I thee worship.
and with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.
and with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.
in the name of the father
and of the son, and of the holy ghost, Amen.
Bess!
Bess!
bess Throckmorton!
here, my lady.
tell me, is it true?
are you with child?
are you with child?
Yes, my lady.
you traitress.
you dare to keep secrets from me?
you ask my permission before you rut!
before you breed!
my bitches wear my collars! Do you hear me?
do you hear me?
Majesty! Please, dignity, mercy.
this is no time for mercy, Walsingham.
you go to your traitor brother
and leave me to my business.
is it his?
tell me, say it. Is the child his? Is it his?
Yes.
my lady, it is my husband's child.
you bitch!
Majesty.
this is not the Queen I love and serve.
this man has seduced a ward of the Queen.
and she has married without royal consent.
these offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him!
go!
you no longer have the Queen's protection.
as you wish, Majesty.
get out.
get out! get out!
the fall of an empire, you told me.
did you mean the English empire?
because, by God, England will not fall while I am Queen.
if that is your prophecy, sir, you prophesy again.
you want me to tell, your Majesty
only what your Majesty chooses to hear.
I will not be a toy of the fates!
have I not faced an assassin's bullet and lived?
just tell me there's no certainty.
that any outcome is possible.
the shadow of ghosts, you said.
please, just give me hope.
the forces that shape our world are greater than all of us, Majesty.
how can I promise that they'll conspire in your favor,
even though you are the Queen?
but this much I know.
when the storm breaks, each man acts in accordance with his own nature.
some are dumb with terror.
some flee. Some hide.
and some
spread their wings like eagles and soar on the wind.
you are a wise man, Dr. Dee.
and you, madam, are a very great lady.
light the beacon!
my lords,
I can offer you no words of comfort.
this Armada that sails against us,
carries in its bowels the inquisition.
God forbid it succeeds,
for then there will be no more liberty in England
of conscience or of thought.
we cannot be defeated.
the bells are to ring from every tower.
laborers are to leave the fields, and take up arms.
the harvest must wait.
all prisoners are to be released.
england is their country, too.
and release Raleigh.
he is forgiven.
as I, too, long to be forgiven.
let the fleet know we're on our way, Mr. Calley!
fire broadside from the bow!
run out the prime!
from the starboard bow, number one gun!
on my mark!
discharge! two!
three! four!
Majesty, the enemy has been engaged.
what news?
a brave action, your Majesty.
two ships lost.
with what gain?
the enemy continue to advance.
tighten the buntlines on the foresail!
another four ships lost.
we must continue to engage and harass the enemy.
we're outgunned, Drake, decisively.
we're losing too many ships. We must fall back and defend the coast.
if the wind is with us, Walter,
we can attack them with fire ships.
six fire ships into the Spanish formation,
that may force them to scatter.
we can't get anywhere near them.
we have to break their formation. That's our only chance.
the Spanish are barely a day away, Majesty.
we must withdraw to safe ground.
I beg you to appreciate the gravity of the situation. There is very little time.
my loving people.
we see the sails of the enemy approaching.
we hear the Spanish guns over the water.
soon now, we will meet them face to face.
I am resolved in the midst and heat of the battle
to live or die amongst you all!
while we stand together, no invader shall pass.
let them come with the armies of hell! They will not pass!
and when this day of battle is ended,
we meet again in heaven
or on the field of victory.
Thomas! Get up! Get up, man! Get up!
help me! Somebody, help me!
help me!
they've dropped anchor.
these Spanish monsters can't handle our English seas.
we have the wind in our favor.
do we go?
we go.
Godspeed, my friend.
Walter?
don't forget to jump.
Calley!
enough tar! Clear the deck!
if that cannon's primed, set the fuse!
get everybody off the ship, now!
get off the ship! Off the ship! Go!
get over there!
come on, boys! Get going!
the Spanish continue to advance.
just five of their ships are burning.
not enough.
Amen.
Francis?
I have served your Majesty in all things.
I know it.
you won't need me anymore.
you rest here,
old friend.
Elizabeth has a son.
you must be proud.
very.
and fulfilled.
as any man can be.
do you still dream of your shining city in the New World?
always.
I'd like to give your son my blessing.
I'd be honored.
I am called the"Virgin Queen."
unmarried,
I have no master.
childless,
I am mother to my people.
God give me strength to bear this mighty freedom.
I am your Queen.
I am myself.
I've aIways been a mommy's boy. I was an onIy chiId, as my mother.
we enjoyed each other's company.
no one ever came to visit.
but when mother died, they came.
totaI strangers, that wanted to taIk to me about my Iife.
didn't they have their own Iives to taIk about?
it is generous of the Norwegian government to suppIy a pIace, for peopIe who are in a ... hectic phase in their Iives.
but I just wanted to be Ieft aIone.
I hated that the institution insisted we open up.
taIk about mother and me and our intense two-ness through 40 years.
my roommate was an orangutan who onIy cared about women and food.
I'm not thriIIed about being here either.
I'm aImost 40, and I've never fucked.
you have haIf your Iife ahead of you.
I have haIf my Iife behind me, Iive in a nuthouse, and have never fucked.
it's overrated. -Is fucking overrated?
you get tired of it. -I'd never get tired of fucking.
I've never had many friends. None, actuaIIy.
but it became cIear that KjeII Bjarne needed a ... spirituaI guide.
I was third mate on a cruise ship. Came to a brotheI in the Caribbean.
with naked chicks?
I impressed the Negresses so much that they forgot to charge me.
HoIy shit!
KjeII Bjarne Iiked my stories so much that he shared them with Gunn.
EIIing has Iied to you, KjeII Bjarne. -Lied?
aren't you in Bandidos? -I'm not exactIy a member.
the chick you fucked on a motorbike? -AII Iies.
you're just jeaIous, Gunn.
eventuaIIy things settIed down.
the Iady on that tropicaI isIand that rubbed you and herseIf in with ...
oiI? Another Iie.
I don't give a shit.
do you mean that? -Sure. As Iong as you teII it again.
KjeII Bjarne never shared another story with Gunn.
and after two years the Norwegian government has decided
to give KjeII Bjarne and me our own weIfare apartment.
Bye.
in the center of OsIo!
from there we are going to attempt a return to reaIity.
yes? Where to?
KjeII Bjarne and I are of course going to OsIo.
one way?
are there different ways? The quickest way to OsIo.
we are going to be met by sociaI worker Frank AasIi.
you work for the government too. Are you generaIIy nice peopIe?
130 kroner each.
it cost 25 kroner when mother and I took the train.
that must have been 30 years ago. -It was.
come on, EIIing.
EIIing!
Hey! EIIing and KjeII Bjarne?
the merry traveIers.
are you ... Frank AasIi?
do they have hot dogs here? -How was your trip?
what's your name again? -Frank AasIi, KjeII Bjarne!
and you are a sociaI worker? -That's right.
are you married, Frank AasIi? -Yes.
is she nice, Frank AasIi? -Nice enough. CaII me Frank.
what's her name, Frank? -KjeII Bjarne!
does she have any girIfriends? -KjeII Bjarne!
come on. Third fIoor.
reIax. This is your home now. Either of you have a cigarette?
it's up to you to prove you can Iive aIone. Shop, cook ...
answer the phone. Prove that you can Iive normaI Iives.
if you faiI, there are pIenty of peopIe waiting for this apartment.
isn't there any food here? -No. You have to get it yourseIf.
down the street to the Ieft.
I'II come around and check on you. I Iike good pIans and fair deaIs.
and you each get your own bedroom.
EIIing?
this is your room.
and you go down here, KjeII Bjarne. Now put down that damn Iuggage!
is this my room? -Great, huh? Your very own room.
here's my phone number. But remember, I have tweIve peopIe to care for.
just Iike Jesus. He aIso had tweIve peopIe to take care of.
let's get something to eat. On the county's dime.
come on, EIIing. The county is buying us dinner.
we just got here. Why go out just to eat some Iousy food?
to ceIebrate your new home.
why not ceIebrate our new home in our new home?
we don't have anything to eat! -EIIing can buy us some food.
I've aIways had two enemies: dizziness and anxiety.
right around the corner.
they foIIow me, wherever I go.
come on, you hippo!
I'm fine.
I'm fine, Frank. Just fine.
this is sociaI worker Frank AasIi.
have a sIice, EIIing. You have to eat something.
no thank you. No one can order me to eat, Frank.
you didn't move here to sit and stare at the waII!
I expect you to go out again.
fine, KjeII Bjarne.
now it wiII be just Iike at the institution, EIIing.
I want to Iisten, EIIing. -Sure, but not to that.
there is onIy one station: The Norwegian state station.
do you have a picture of your mom? -Thought we couId decorate.
decorate with your mom? HardIy!
if my mom showed up, I'd throw her and my fucking stepdad out on their asses!
your mother gave birth to you, fed you, washed your cIothes.
not my mom.
haven't you ever wanted to kiII her? -Why wouId I want to kiII mother?
how about your dad? Was he nice?
father died two weeks before I was born, but I think mother Iiked him.
I'm hungry, EIIing. -The store is out the door to the Ieft.
weII done, KjeII Bjarne!
this is the best damn food I have ever tasted.
mother handIed practicaI matters at home. I was in charge of ideoIogy.
the Norwegian Labor Party was an exceIIent judge of right and wrong.
it's your turn to shop. You haven't been outside once!
I have done other things. And who eats aII the food, anyway?
we shouId go out, Iike Frank says. Go somewhere with chicks.
I've said it before: Women Iike cIean, shaved men, not 14-day-oId sweat ...
it hasn't been 14 days. Ten, max!
that's the Iast time I go shopping!
wrong number again.
EIIing?
KjeII Bjarne? Are you in there?
why don't you answer the phone?
it must be broken.
I've diaIed again and again. It doesn't work.
shape up, boys.
you have to stick to our deaI.
if this is to work, I have to be abIe to reach you by phone.
KjeII Bjarne ...
fine. We'II just have to practice again.
I have to organize my tooIbox. -No, you are both coming with me.
when the phone rings, you pick up the receiver and say heIIo.
EIIing first.
let's pretend it's ringing.
ring. Ring.
answer the phone.
answer, EIIing. -Pick it up and say heIIo.
come on.
come on, EIIing.
HeIIo? -Hi. It's Frank. How are you?
pick it up! -Hi, I'm thirsty. Likewise. Bye.
great, EIIing. One more time.
mother handIed aII our phone caIIs at home.
your mother is dead. This is your home now. You have to answer.
say something, EIIing.
taIk, EIIing!
it's not naturaI to taIk into a pIastic gizmo to someone you can't even see!
you need to get out more among peopIe.
why have an apartment if we have to Ieave it aII the time?
if you don't do as I say, you won't have an apartment at aII.
EIIing, maybe we shouId go out Iike Frank says.
no women are going to come here if they don't know we Iive here.
we don't have to go out to meet women, KjeII Bjarne.
Frank deserves credit for teaching us how to use the phone.
I just Iove sex! I'm sitting here pIaying with myseIf. Touch my tits ...
four thousand kroner!
it's your choice: Pussy taIk or apartment?
you don't meet peopIe over the phone!
you have enough money. It's a matter of prioritizing.
that's what I teII KjeII Bjarne. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize!
I've never heard that. -Yes, you have!
shut up!
a finaI warning: Stick to our deaI. I want to see progress.
I said we shouId go out.
where, with minus 4000 kroner? A SaIvation Army soup kitchen?
good idea. Let's go to the movies. -No.
come on, EIIing. -No.
two against one. That's how it's aIways been.
but when three grown men argue, the tone can get pretty rough.
best damn movie I've ever seen! -Good movie, EIIing?
I consider myseIf a modern IiberaI man of the town,
but I refuse to appIaud the breakdown of society!
it was a comedy. -Didn't you get it?
it was not funny. You don't understand anything.
nothing's good enough for you.
I can't taIk to you when you're in that mood.
let's go eat. -Not out again, Frank.
you had to come home to crap. -PubIic restrooms are not my forte.
I Iook forward to seeing what your forte is!
no smoking in here.
no more staying cooped up here. Time to tighten the reins.
he sticks his nose in everything. Nothing is good enough.
and he mocks my ideaIs.
why don't we try to go out, just the two of us?
I'm scared too, EIIing. But we have money. And we onIy Iive once.
I sure hope so. The concept of reincarnation has troubIed me.
someone Iike me must have an incredibIy Iong way Ieft to Nirvana.
let's go to the café around the corner.
the other day they had pork and gravy.
if things get bad, we can waIk home again.
or run.
it's that simpIe.
come on, EIIing!
come on.
it's right across the street and to the right.
just stick to the zebra stripes.
here I waIk, aIong with one of Iife's simpIer apostIes.
yet I feeI safe in some strange way, having him by my side.
let's go.
I hope they have Iots of pork. -And gravy. I can't wait!
come on.
two ... -Here you go.
shit! They don't have pork and gravy!
anything to drink? -Don't you have pork and gravy?
today's speciaI is stew. -You said they had pork and gravy.
let me check with the chef. -Don't give up too easy, EIIing.
I had my mind totaIIy set on pork and gravy!
we had two heIpings Ieft. -What's your name?
Johanne. -Thank you, Johanne.
my pIeasure. Let me get you some water.
how is it? -Best damn food I've ever tasted.
not quite as good as mother's, but ... -That'II make the chef happy.
here you go.
what a woman!
bet Frank wouId Iove to see us now.
he wouIdn't be satisfied
untiI we joined a tabIe fuII of peopIe from foreign cuItures.
we shouId aImost caII Frank and teII him we are here.
do it! -I said aImost.
KjeII Bjarne ...
aII of it?
we have to Ieave, KjeII Bjarne. -Why?
I have to go to the bathroom. -The can is right over there.
want me to go with you?
how different peopIe are.
some peopIe ski soIo to the South PoIe,
whiIe I have to summon aII my courage to cross a restaurant fIoor.
this must be what is meant by breaking boundaries.
that was aII for today.
HeIIo. AasIi. -Frank? Hi, it's me.
you making a caII, EIIing?
KjeII Bjarne and I have just grabbed some food at our IocaI haunt.
pork and gravy every Friday. KjeII Bjarne is easiIy persuaded.
I'II say! -You can say that again.
weII done, EIIing. -Wasn't it?
aII we need now are some chicks. Let's go home and make one Iast phone caII.
let's do something cuIturaI instead! -Huh?
CuIturaI, my ass!
we'II see.
HoIy shit! I don't beIieve it!
imagine if she were reaI.
the thought has crossed my mind.
look at this.
KjeII Bjarne, Iook!
amazing!
I can't wait any Ionger, EIIing.
it's onIy five o'cIock. Finish your cake first, at Ieast.
here you go, EIIing. -For me?
if you don't Iike it, I'II go kiII myseIf.
is it aII right? -It's fantastic.
I made it in my spare time.
look, EIIing.
here's you and me.
you're the yeIIow one.
let me get your present, KjeII Bjarne.
merry Christmas.
HoIy shit!
try not to curse on Christmas.
how did you know I wanted the bIonde?
I have come to know you, KjeII Bjarne.
this is the best damn present anyone has ever given me.
likewise.
what was that?
KjeII Bjarne?
KjeII Bjarne?
EIIing, come and heIp me! There's a Iady in the stairs.
who is it? -How wouId I know?
is she sick? -She wiII be. Now she's just drunk.
come back inside, KjeII Bjarne. Maybe someone eIse wiII find her.
heIp me, EIIing!
take it easy. One thing at a time.
what's your name?
grab her purse. -Are you crazy? I'm no thief.
check her purse. Find out what her name is.
empty it!
Reidun NordsIetten.
she Iives here.
december 24, 1963...
she has the same birthday as Jesus! -Shit ...
today. -She's pregnant, EIIing.
she couIdn't just be a IittIe fat?
sure, there's some fat here.
but inside the fat there's an astronaut fIoating around.
hope she hasn't hurt the baby.
reIax. I've done this a hundred times with my mom.
the key. Open the door. -I can't, KjeII Bjarne.
open it! -Of course.
we can't Ieave her in the stairs on Christmas Eve.
we'II caII up in a coupIe of hours and see how she's doing.
you go down. I'II stay tiII she's better.
you can't! You Iook Iike a rapist. You'II terrify her.
the chiId's father may show up at any second.
you are acting fooIishIy, KjeII Bjarne. I'm teIIing Frank.
there you go. Get it out.
I'II just head down to our apartment ...
that was when the words struck me.
it was as if they were written on the inside of my eyeIids.
we found her in the stairs
her hair ... a bIack raven's wing Beating against the fiIthy IinoIeum
we Iaid her on her bed, and saw She had an angeI's chiId in her womb
my God, EIIing ... You have committed poetry!
my entire Iife I have waIked the earth Not knowing I am a poet!
no wonder there have been certain misunderstandings,
when my poetry, my own Ianguage, has Iain undiscovered within me!
we found her in the stairs ...
hair ... This is poetry!
we Iaid her on her bed, and saw She had an angeI's chiId in her womb
Hi, EIIing. Why haven't you gone to bed?
there you are.
you understood why I retired so discreetIy, right?
so that I couId come to your aid, if anything went wrong.
like what? -What about Reidun's husband?
what if he found you in his sofa on Christmas Eve?
you're Iucky she didn't wake up before you came downstairs.
she woke up Iike heII!
wasn't she terrified to find an orangutan in her apartment?
not reaIIy.
doesn't she read the papers? This town is fuII of burgIars and rapists!
it's time for you to go to bed, EIIing. I sure am.
I have to fix her Ieaky faucet Iater.
she finds a totaI stranger in her apartment,
and immediateIy asks him to fix her Ieaky faucet?
did she Iend you a key, too, so you can come and go as you pIease?
KjeII Bjarne, you are in Iove!
I have to report this to Frank. You are out of controI!
dammit, EIIing!
workshop! -Library!
I've aIways wanted a Iibrary! -BuIIshit! We need a workshop!
Frank toId you not to constantIy read that book about Gro HarIem BrundtIand.
that isn't Frank. Let's just pretend we're not here.
Hi, couId you heIp me with ...
sure. I'II teII him. -Thanks for your heIp.
I had to carry some firewood up from the basement for her.
shit! She invited us to dinner. Tonight!
before you knock yourseIf out ... Did she invite us to dinner?
she said I couId bring you.
thank you, but I don't Iike being brought anywhere.
why wouId I want to Iisten to you two taIk about drinking and gaskets?
anyway, I'm busy. -Busy?
I have a meeting. -Expect me to beIieve that?
beIieve whatever you want. -What kind of meeting?
that's none of your business.
just Iike it's none of my business that you Iet pregnant drunks use you.
how about a game of Parcheesi to get you in a better mood?
poetry reading?
those are my sungIasses.
you can't wear sungIasses at dinner with Reidun.
where are you going? -To a poetry meeting.
a very important meeting about modern Norwegian IyricaI poetry.
you reaIIy are nuts.
nuts because I'm going to a meeting? Everyone goes to meetings.
are you teIIing me I can't go ...
EIIing!
have you reaIIy thought this through?
I can skip the dinner, if you want me to go with you.
you go to that dinner, KjeII Bjarne.
go ahead.
pIease come with me, EIIing.
I don't know what to taIk to her about.
how stupid can you be?
Oh God. Now he's here. Five sharp.
stick to your pIan ...
are you waiting for me, EIIing?
I was heading somewhere, but now I don't know.
and KjeII Bjarne ...? -KjeII Bjarne went to the movies.
I was heading to a meeting, but ... -A meeting?
what kind of meeting?
a poetry meeting. -ReaIIy?
but I don't know where it is. -That's easy to find. Come here.
it's right here. But you're earIy.
I Iike to have pIenty of time.
I'm not the type that stroIIs in at the Iast second.
but it's onIy ... five o'cIock. These things start around ten.
but it says that it starts at eight. -It starts a Iot Iater, EIIing.
they wrote eight, so they must mean eight.
fine. Have a beer whiIe you wait. -I don't drink beer.
I think you shouId go to that meeting. It's a good initiative.
I'II just waIk the streets for a few hours.
be a waIking target for random vioIence.
my oId enemies dizziness and anxiety did not join me this time.
strange.
it's perfectIy naturaI that we poets go to meetings!
Hi. -An orange soda, pIease.
she probabIy assumes I've been around so Iong
that my Iiver can't take any more.
it's soda or death for me now.
I wrote these poems whiIe sick with maIaria in Cambodia.
the teak stump Over-fiIIed dams
the breath of a bird Through the cavity and out
my next poem is caIIed " Cobweb " .
cobweb I Iie and stare at the cobweb
every time something guiIty gets caught You tear it asunder again
strange, huh? The worse it is, the more they cIap.
how's it going out there?
let's do it.
a bIonde eIfin from Patmos He didn't have a chance
do you suck cock I screamed into a paIe Aurorean ear
but as we wrinkIed sheets, in bed
he got a sun-tanned underarm shoved up where the sun never shines!
is anyone out there? Let go!
stop!
it is cIear to me now. I must seek my audience through other fora.
I shaII become the mysterious underground poet " E " .
mommy's boy, maybe, but a new, dangerous version.
so that made you sick, too? The worse it is, the more they cIap.
want to go somewhere for a drink? Throw dirt on contemporary poetry?
I'm going home.
why didn't I just say yes?
two hot dogs with mustard, pIease.
to teII you the truth ... -Hi there.
I'm aIIergic to aIcohoI. It can make me do things I'II regret.
I drank some Iiquor once, with some other boys.
mother came home, and I did something I stiII regret.
I tore off her wedding ring and tried to seII her body to these " friends " .
lousy friends.
want one? -Thank you.
do you go to book shows often?
I've Iived a sedate Iife untiI now. I rareIy go anywhere.
me neither.
and I had never been abIe to speak to strangers before!
mostiy we just taIked poetry.
it's totaIIy pathetic. It's sick!
CeciIie Kornes needs psychiatric heIp! -That's where you're wrong.
madness is poetry's most important source.
I aImost showed him my poem then and there.
but as an underground poet I had to remain anonymous.
this is where I Iive.
thank you for wasting your time on an oId man.
my name is AIfons Jθrgensen. -EIIing.
this was fun. Some peopIe just pretend, but you reaIIy are crazy.
I was under the distinct impression that this man needed cheering up.
I'm going to give you my phone number.
had I reaIIy made a friend
without any heIp from the Norwegian government?
how did dinner go? -Fine. How was your meeting?
fine. -What kind of a meeting was it?
just a basic poetry meeting.
she served hen up there.
chicken. -Hen.
is that your hot dog? -HeIp yourseIf.
that damn Spanisher! If that bastard shows up here, he's in deep shit!
imagine knocking her up and then taking off!
are you going to marry Reidun, now?
you know nothing about her! -I know she works at a Iaundromat.
have you toId her about your Ioving famiIy, your stepfather, the pigs?
what did you get for dessert?
some sort of homemade pudding.
it was the best damn ... -Dessert you've ever tasted.
she said that she Iiked me. -ReaIIy? Great.
what did you say? -ShouId I have said something?
I'm no good at taIking. -That's probabIy why she Iikes you.
you're the siIent type. You're ... mysterious.
mysterious? -I don't know. TaIk to her!
I don't know how to.
I'm actuaIIy doing better.
now that AIfons has taught me that my angst is the price I have to pay.
now I simpIy have to find the right forum for my poem.
do we have any more sauerkraut?
Gunn toId us that we have to get better at expressing our emotions.
you want sauerkraut? -Yes. 18 packs.
I'II get some stewed prunes, too. Have had troubIe crapping IateIy.
maybe it's best he doesn't say too much.
no ...
are you EIIing? -My name is EIIing.
can I ask you something? -KjeII Bjarne is at the store.
I know. I saw him Ieave.
Oh my God. I'm stuck in the middIe of a ménage à trois!
Reidun has simpIy used KjeII Bjarne to get cIoser to me!
I have to taIk to you about KjeII Bjarne.
you onIy want to taIk about him? -You know him better than anyone.
I can't teII you just anything about KjeII Bjarne.
why not?
a friendship between two men requires a IeveI of confidentiaIity.
I just think he's so weird.
I prefer the EngIish expression " rare " .
huh? -Rare. As in uncommon.
that was beautifuIIy put.
I don't know, it's just that he never says anything.
KjeII Bjarne tends to ruminate. -About what?
good point.
has he had many women? -I wouIdn't say many ...
do you think he Iikes me?
no, Reidun NordsIetten.
KjeII Bjarne Ioves you.
what am I saying?
it's one thing to break boundaries, another to bIow your Iife to pieces.
has he said that? -No. But I know KjeII Bjarne.
you must Ieave now. KjeII Bjarne may be back any second.
is he that jeaIous? -It's best not to chaIIenge him.
thank you.
shit ... I Iike you.
what kind of stew did you get?
nothing happened, KjeII Bjarne. We just taIked.
are you crazy? She wanted to taIk about you.
she Ioves you, KjeII Bjarne!
HeIIo? -Hi, EIIing here.
Hi. Yes, Iikewise.
fine, thank you. Fine. How about you?
ReaIIy? Let me know if I can heIp in any way.
Yes, I see. Six ...
EIIing, I didn't mean to scare you.
was it true ...
you wait here, KjeII Bjarne.
EIIing!
is it true that Reidun ...
it's true. She Ioves you. And I toId her you Ioved her too.
are you spying on me? -No, but where are you going?
I can take care of myseIf. I'm just visiting a friend.
a drinking buddy. He needed me to do some shopping.
EIIing and KjeII Bjarne. OsIo's new rescue team.
pregnant or eIderIy, caII day or night!
Jθrgensen?
AIfons Jθrgensen?
it's me. EIIing.
here I sit, Iike another idiot.
have you broken something? -I hope not.
this is KjeII Bjarne. He ... -Hi.
you can't waIk on this foot. -But I have to go to the bathroom.
Where's the can? -Down there.
no, KjeII Bjarne ...
there he goes again. KjeII Bjarne seems to carry every person he meets.
strange.
why aII these damn books?
how is he? -He's on the can.
thank you. Did you remember to buy beer?
Oh no. Are they stiII out there?
HoIy shit, what a beauty!
I sprained my ankIe chasing them away.
a '59 Buick Century Hardtop?
58. We bought it in '62. -Is it yours?
I haven't driven it since my wife died. I just hope they don't ruin it.
I can bring her back to Iife. -My wife?
the Buick. -You can try. I fear it's too Iate.
HoIy shit!
Eva died in '79, and so did the car.
my mother died two years and six months ago.
where did you get aII these books? -They just came fIying.
a Iot of poetry. -You can borrow whatever you want.
I'II make her run if it's the Iast thing I do.
so I hear. It's just an oId car.
it's gorgeous! -More so than Reidun NordsIetten?
you shouId focus on Reidun, not that car.
my entire Iife I have respected the efforts of the Iabor movement.
IdIeness has aIways been my worst enemy. I am a man of many projects.
if you keep that up, you wiII get sick.
I can't take it anymore!
you aren't getting any more cIearheaded.
heIp me, EIIing! -Do something to impress her.
but I don't know what to say to her!
let go, KjeII Bjarne! This isn't food.
are you sick, KjeII Bjarne? -No.
he was crazy, but now he is hamstrung. Won't even pIay Parcheesi.
are you feeIing unweII? -No.
what's the matter? -KjeII Bjarne is in Iove.
no, I'm not! -You are.
you've got a girIfriend? -Yes, and she's about to have a baby.
no. -Yes.
ReaIIy? -Yes, Frank.
that's great! CongratuIations. But you can't just Iie here.
you have to invite her to dinner, to a movie, something.
you have anything going on, prude? -Yes, Frank.
that's nice.
I did it, EIIing! I did it, and it was done!
did what? -Invited her out!
good for you.
KjeII Bjarne? Hi.
thanks for the invitation. -Don't thank me. Thank KjeII Bjarne.
no. Thank EIIing! -Whatever. But what time?
Reidun wants to know when. -Didn't you give her a time?
how about now? -Can I get my jacket?
have fun. -EIIing!
wait, EIIing! -I have a meeting.
KjeII Bjarne?
what are you doing? -Checking the expiration date.
see, the date varies. This one says 2003, this one 2005.
so? -Maybe 2003 is a better vintage.
are you buying one, or not? -Do you have cigars?
no one knows it yet, but the city has a new poet: The Sauerkraut Poet.
the enigmatic " E " strikes again.
you don't smoke.
have you had a good time? -I showed her the Buick.
what a great car! -Reidun washed his whoIe apartment.
his foot is a Iot better. Do you have a Iight?
you're trying to take over my friend AIfons Jθrgensen!
pretending he's your friend ...
I wasn't pretending anything! -He feeIs pressured.
let me just find the right wrench ...
the next day it was Iike they had known each other forever.
coffee, boys!
at Ieast I have my poems to myseIf.
he'II never get it to start. -Sure I wiII.
sure he wiII. -If so, we'II aII go for a drive.
a drive? Do you mean ...?
he means a drive. Where you drive around in a car untiI you stop!
we can go to my cabin. I haven't been there for years.
we've been invited to his cabin, KjeII Bjarne!
cabin? -If Frank Iets us.
it's none of his business. -Who is Frank?
nobody. -I'II taIk to him. You just argue.
you stay out of this! It's time we cut Frank AasIi down to size!
I won't Iet the weIfare state stop me. Why can't I go to someone's cabin?
I have never been to a cabin in my Iife. Never!
does that weIfare rat get to decide what I can and cannot do?
you taIk to Frank.
teII him to caII me.
coffee, boys.
AIfons Jθrgensen? You're hanging out with inteIIigentsia.
what's wrong with him, since you know him?
he has pubIished books of poems. He was quite famous.
why didn't you say you were a mechanic?
nobody ever asked.
you guys better behave. -Now, Frank ...
on your cabin trip.
it's Iike a baIIroom in here. -Americans are generous peopIe.
tonight I'm going to waIk aIong the shore Iike a sober UIf LundeII.
good no one's been drinking.
is it because I finaIIy am getting out?
they're after me, the driver, not you.
so I'm not interesting, just because I'm in the back seat?
the poIice abducted me from my apartment!
just a routine check. License and registration pIease.
out for a drive? Nice set of wheeIs.
KjeII Bjarne fixed it up.
buick Century, right? -A '58 Buick Century Hardtop.
why does everyone know what this car is caIIed?
it's a 6-Iiter engine. A V-8.
and check out this carburetor.
it's hard to find originaI parts. Over there is the power steering.
I see that the tefting is Ioose. -Tefting? That's the radiator hose.
where I come from, we caII it the " tefting " .
you'II break it. -It's Ioose.
it's supposed to be!

hoId your horses. Nobody bIames the Labor Party for this.
but they were the ruIing party.
a house isn't in poor condition because of a few rotten boards.
huh? -He's speaking in pictures.
but where did the rotten boards come from?
the Iumberyard!
who smuggIed the rotten boards onto the construction site?
sociaI democratic Iaborers from the Labor Party?
exactIy. -ExactIy not!
they were bought and paid for by the CIA and the KGB!
they brought the rotten boards. -So caII them and yeII at them!
I'm going to get ready for bed.
you weigh 240 pounds, KjeII Bjarne!
it had to happen.
the moment when KjeII Bjarne had to choose between Reidun and me.
EIIing?

nothing. -Then go to bed!
can I borrow your underwear?
aren't you wearing cIean underwear?
no. -When did you Iast change?
I'm not sure. -Hard to keep track of the weeks ...
shit, I couIdn't know that Reidun ... I couIdn't know that.
I thought I was bunking with you. -So it didn't matter.

we can't go to bed now. -Why not?
let's go for a drink.
a drink of what?

exactIy. We don't drink wine, therefore we'II drink some now!
weird pIace.
this doesn't heIp. -Take it easy, KjeII Bjarne.
if you get drunk, we'II get sent right back to the institution.
who knows who your new roommate might be?
these are Iike egg cups.
EIIing, you're a true buddy. I was cranky because I was scared.
we're friends. You don't have to keep shaking my hand, KjeII Bjarne.
here's to what is about to happen. -Cheers!

his girIfriend is having a baby as we speak.
Rita, bring out the champagne!
that guy in the coveraIIs is about to become a daddy!

she's going to be bigger than you, KjeII Bjarne!
what are we drinking? -Champagne!
shit! This damn stuff tastes great!
I stiII don't know how we got home that night.
the aIcohoI has gotten to us. Might as weII ship us back to the institution.
that pIace is for Ioonies. It's normaI of you to ceIebrate the new kid.
How're the mother and baby? -I have no idea.
take some aspirin and cIean up this vomit.
and Iater you can read these. I borrowed them at the Iibrary.
mind the return date.
HoIy shit!
you guys are doing just fine.
everything passes on.
to put it another way: Everything passes on to something eIse.
I brought you the paper. -Thank you.
notice " The Sauerkraut Poet " ? -I sure did. Not a bad poem.
Yes.
I was overjoyed when I read in the paper about Kaare Svingen and the pack of sauerkraut he had bought downtown.
I have made my debut.
thousands of peopIe are now wondering who the mysterious " E " is.
I am on everyone's Iips.
it is tempting to stand forward, but no.
I want to remain who I am:
to a father who always expected the worst.
and a carefree mother whose smile Emma was not to remember.
one day the worst did happen.
and as he watched his wife leave home for the last time,
Mr. Woodhouse resolved never to let his daughters out of sight again, except under the careful eye of their governess.
Ann Taylor.
and so the sun continued to shine brightly on Emma.
we must hurry, Dr. Perry, she has taken a turn for the worse.
come along, Emma.
but other children in Highbury were not so fortunate.
young Frank Weston's world was turned upside down.
I will take the child, Mr. Weston, for the sake of my foolish sister.
but he will live with me always and his name will be Frank Churchill.
and little Jane Fairfax's life was never to be the same when her aunt fell on hard times.
it's for the best, we must let Jane go.
captain Campbell is very well set up, he will give her the education we cannot.
but we can't let the child go. Our lovely little girl...
we will have to leave this house soon, for one smaller.
we promised that we would do our best for Jane.
now remember, Jane, you write to us as often as you can.
you will become wonderfully accomplished at everything.
captain Campbell is not frightening.
be a good girl, Jane.
and so Jane and Frank were forced to leave Highbury and trust their fortune to strangers.
look! While Emma stayed comfortably at home.
with very little to distress or vex her...
where she going, Miss Taylor?
for many years to come.
miss Campbell was afraid that perhaps, they were too young, but Jane's very keen, when she applies herself. She always excels, always has done.
and then Jane says they are to go to the seaside.
isn't that splendid, Miss Taylor?
shh, Emma doesn't know anything about the seaside, it's best the children don't.
Oh. Jane's handwriting is so very accomplished.
there is nothing she cannot do.
she excels at everything, everything.
I'm so glad, there was never a moment's doubt that
Colonel Campbell would look after her as his own daughter.
going away was the best thing that happened to her.
wasn't it, mother?
and then Jane says that she and Miss Campbell...
have begun learning the pianoforte.
Colonel Campbell has a very large piano.
she played the piano to the dinner guests.
did I tell you how well Jane plays, Miss Taylor?
and she speaks French like a native though I'm not sure that's such a sensible thing.
I'm going to ask Mr. Knightley to teach me Chinese.
do you think Jane could read Chinese?
Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure she could.
I thought it was backwards, look I'm sure Jane is equal to anything.
did I tell you she is halfway through her reading list of at least 100 titles.
100
I suppose you've come to tell me off about the Chinese.
Yes, I heard about that.
I'm sure Miss Bates wasn't upset, but you should...
be kind to her. Yes, yes, I know!
that's just what Miss Taylor keeps telling me.
Jane is an orphan and Miss Bates has come down in the world and I do try.
it's just that Jane seems to write to her aunt every week and she seems to gain at least eight accomplishments between one and the next.
and Miss Bates comes here every week to tell us about them.
Emma!
what are you doing?
I've compiled a list of books to read.
101 titles.
so that I might not be so uneducated compared to Jane Fairfax.
Oh, see I have started. Milton. Impressive. Mmm.
it is the first on the list.
there are John and Isabella again.
they are impossible.
I'm sure Jane Fairfax is not remotely good at things I do well.
she may excel at words and music but, er, but people, their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations, there I am the expert.
Really? I don't imagine you could even tell us if we've got any hopes and dreams? Not you, silly.
you're not the romantic sort... but, er...
but my sister and your brother.
John and Isabella?! Surely not.
surely yes.
it's been my express wish and intent for six months now.
but they have known each other all their lives, as long as you and I. In fact, longer.
indeed, so a little careful prodding was necessary.
if, if they like each other enough to marry it will be because they themselves wish it, not because you do.
but I think there's nothing in it.
you are mistaken, as always.
I, Isabella Woodhouse take thee, John Knightley, to be my wedded husband.
London.
london, all the way to London.
might as well be the moon.
I will look after you.
all will be as before.
lucky guess.
nothing lucky about it.
just talent and intuition.
right, who will be next?
I wonder.
and so the years passed and the seasons change...
and we give thanks to the Lord for his mercy.
and in the Lord's own book we find the words to voice our thanks for these natural wonders
God of salvation...
you who are the hope of all the ends of the Earth, by whose power...
good morning, Mr. Elton.
good morning, Miss Woodhouse. I trust you are in good health.
very well, thank you.
good morning, Mr. Weston.Yes, my dear.
Mr. Weston
and the more so for this very morning
I have finally secured the purchase of Randalls estate.
Oh, congratulations!
it is such a fine house and so close to us at Hartfield.
we will be neighbours.
what does Mr. Frank Churchill think about this?
surely he must come home, at long last, to visit us and to see your new house?
I have written to him already.
don't worry, ladies,
I always bring a spare umbrella with me for spring walks.
we are in your debt, Mr. Weston.
but a man with two umbrellas cannot get wet.
I'm sure there's room under the large one, for both of you.
miss Taylor, it would be an honour to receive you one day at Randalls...
I would be delighted, Mr. Weston. Splendid.
Oh, dear, oh, dear!
poor Miss Taylor!
you must stop this at once, Emma, this matchmaking.
it is of the greatest misfortune for poor Miss Taylor.
just think, she's been with us and our family for 17 years.
she might have stayed here till she died!
if you'd left well alone.
Misfortune!? But now she has the greatest future ahead, a husband she loves, a house and maybe even a family.
a family! Surely not?
surely you would not deny her that, she's looked after us so well and for so long?
mothers die and that is a fact.
miss Taylor is not young.
Oh, dear, you should not make matches or predictions.
unfortunately they all come true.
everybody said that Mr. Weston would never remarry.
yet I knew from that day with the umbrellas that he would marry Miss Taylor.
it is my greatest success!
Success?! And how do you reckon that?
success implies endeavour.
just saying to yourself, "I think it would be a fine thing
if Miss Taylor and Mr. Weston were to marry,"
and then repeating it to yourself every so often is not the same as bringing it about.
just at the moment when Mr. Weston bought Randalls and was considering how to fill it,
I was there to smooth the way.
Ah, just in time.
Emma was in the process of likening you to some new drapes or a sofa.
I believe congratulations are in order.
Oh, we have so much to plan for, of course, as Hartfield is as much your home as mine, we will have the wedding here.
then there is the guest list to compile.
will Frank Churchill be coming?
well, he has written to congratulate us and assures us he will be here.
you would think so.
it would be the least he could do for his father.
Oh, then there is the cake to think about.
Oh, no, no, no cake, surely not!
well, yes, Father.
you would not wish to appear ungenerous.
Ungenerous? I am the soul of generosity!
Yes, of course you are, so there must be cake!
no, no cake is bad for you, especially the young.
no cake.
James, Henry, out!
Hey, come back here.Never!
I've no wonder father is concerned for Miss Taylor.
after all she's not young and uprooting to Randalls, though it is but half a mile, will be an upheaval for all.
you moved here, my love, all the way to Brunswick Square, London.
Oh, yes, of course, but I would never have done so unless there was Emma to leave in charge of Hartfield and father
so Emma must never be allowed to marry?
well she has no wish to. She does not need to.
anyway a husband might expect to tell her what to do and she won't like that at all.
she is too busy marrying off the whole of Highbury to each other
you will return to find Miss Bates engaged!
uncle George! Uncle George!
Yes, I know, I know. I promised.
put me down. Uncle George.
put me down!
...Stay away from the cake
Oh, Dr. Perry, I do so wish I could have prevented the cake.
I know how strongly you disapprove.
I'm so sorry that Frank was not able to come after all.
Yes, my dear. He was very sorry to miss the occasion.
his aunt could not spare him.
she is so very ill.
I think he does it to increase his mysteriousness.
he deliberately has not come back to Highbury all these years since he was a little boy.
we ladies can only be more intrigued and savour our anticipation until he does visit which will be very soon I'm sure
Mr. Weston.
though she would never have admitted it to anyone
Emma felt just for one moment a strange sensation that maybe through her own endeavours she was about to lose something that might never be recovered.
can we have some. Please! No cake no cake, go away.
but Father! What?
the children are allowed to eat the cake.
it's not good for them makes them too excited.
then they run around.
now, Emma, enough is enough.
no more match-making.
this house cannot stand another departure.
Oh, certainly, your father is right, Miss Woodhouse.
this is a poor empty old house now there's just you and your father here.
a ghost house. I wonder you'll be able to sleep at night.
I am sure my mother and I are so very pleased that our little home is so very cosy.
we have no time to feel lonely or as if the world has left us behind.
well, then, what a happy day that we've had.
I'm sure. Mother, don't you think?
we really had a wonderful time.
I feel quite exhausted. I'm sure you must too.
we'll have a very happy journey home.
with the sun on our faces.
Emma let me give him some food.
Ann said I could feed him, then I'm going to put him to bed.
it's my turn, Isabella. He's not tired yet.
he wants something to eat.
he wants some toast.
here look he wants to kiss...
Emma, Isabella, it's time to go. Come and get your hats on.
come on, let's go find Miss Taylor.
so how was the wedding? Who cried most?
cook told me the Perry children took all the cake.
I don't believe her.
it's good of you to exert yourself this evening to visit us here after your journey.
it is a short walk and I am fond of it.
I think we are part of his exercise regime.
a mile's walk and a daily scolding of Emma is just what Dr. Perry prescribes!
Randalls is only half a mile away.
it's an easy walk and by carriage you might visit the Westons several times a day if you chose. Yes, it's True.
I have already had the coach man measure the journey.
and now that I have returned from London
I thought you might like to hear more about the new addition to our family.
baby Emma...
is already looking every bit as lively and mischievous as her aunt.
Mr.s Goddard you have such a lovely school!
if Jane had not had the good fortune to stay with the Campbells
I always say that this school with its wonderful gardens and so much...fresh air.
don't I always say?
well, we see you all at church on Sundays.
you and a long line of little ones walking after you.
it's a lovely sight.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Miss Woodhouse walking alone!
why, yes.
it is not safe and now Miss Taylor has become Mr.s Weston, you must find a walking companion.
what if you'd met the gypsies!
Oh, but they are on the west fields and Mr. Knightley says they are not bad sorts of travellers indeed they travel here every year.
all the other paths are safe.
I have walked here all my life.
I am not going to stay inside just because Miss Taylor is married.
is she settled at Randalls?
Oh, you must miss her very much, Miss Woodhouse.
are we always to expect you without her company on your future visits?
alone that is?
Oh... I hope not.
I mean naturally we will not be so much together out and about as we used to be but then we were always inseparable and it is natural that things will be...different.
to be sure.
I'm sure you'll find another companion.
who is that young woman?
wait!
that is Harriet Smith, one of our most popular boarders.
harriet has been with us since she was a very pretty young girl.
she will remain here to help with the little ones.
she has been to stay at her friends the Martins for the holidays
she likes them so much she cannot say goodbye.
what a pretty girl! Where does she come from?
who are her family?
Oh she is the, er... the, the natural daughter of...
well, we don't really know who but they are very generous.
she has wanted for no comfort all these years and everything is extremely regular and paid up front.
she is obviously the daughter of someone very refined.
nobility probably since money is no object.
do come for supper at Hartfield next Tuesday, Mr.s Goddard.
and bring Harriet Smith if you would be so kind.
just for a moment there I imagined that nothing had changed.
miss Taylor in her usual place and nothing unpleasant occurred.
Mr.s Weston, father!
and we have a delightful new addition to our party.
excuse me, Miss Woodhouse.
I have been delayed in the village on the errand of one whose business I hold only just in higher regard than yours.
on whose business?
the Almighty's. God's?
Oh! Of course.
God's business just a little more regard than Miss Woodhouse.
Yes. I see. How very civil.
you are most welcome, Mr. Elton, as always.
I think I only have one introduction to make.
my special friend Miss Harriet Smith.
well, Miss Woodhouse's special friend can be one no less to me.
harriet will be joining me this week when I go to visit the poor.
Bravo.
I don't know what you think of this new intimacy between
Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it could be a bad thing.
Oh, do you really?
how very differently we feel.
are we going to have one of our quarrels about Emma
Mr. Knightley?
well perhaps you think I came down here on purpose to quarrel with you knowing Mr. Weston to be out and you must argue your own case.
well, Mr. Weston would certainly support me if he were here.
you live alone, Mr. Knightley and I do not think it possible for a man to appreciate how much a woman needs the companionship of another woman.
and though I am but half a mile away
I know that in all modesty
Emma will miss my company dreadfully.
it was the one drawback to my accepting my husband's proposal.
how we are all drawn to Hartfield like magnets and cannot leave.
I've heard Emma say a dozen times she will never marry.
if you find it difficult to leave her imagine how she will ever leave her father!
well, we will see.
I'm sure that obstacle can be surmounted in the event of a happy liaison.
but not just yet.
did she not look well last night?
have you ever seen such loveliness!
such good health and bloom!
I have never had any fault to find in Emma's person.
she's always been the cleverest and the prettiest of the family
Emma has always been of special regard.
I love to look at her and she's not vain about her looks.
no, her vanity lies in another direction and you have cleverly put me off its discussion.
I am not to be talked out of my dislike of her intimacy with
harriet Smith and my fear it will do them both harm.
it will play to Emma's vanity.
and I see no harm at all.
harriet will benefit from Emma's superior position.
of course she is not the ideal companion for her but then who is her equal in Highbury?
and Harriet can in return, she...
well, they can read together.
you are always telling Emma she should read more.
Emma's been meaning to read more since she was ten years old.
she makes a good list I'll concede but I don't see how Harriet Smith could get her to read any of the books on it any more than you could.
don't worry, Harriet, you are doing well indeed, for a beginner.
good morning, Miss Smith. Good morning, Mr. Martin.
I hope I find you well? Very well indeed, thank you.
I do hope that your mother and sisters are in good health?
very good health, thank you.
I wonder, did you manage to find the book I recommended?
the Romance Of The Forest.
no, I'm afraid I didn't.
but I've asked my sisters to look out for it.
and will read it as soon as I can manage.
well, good day.
Harriet, who was that young man?
Oh, that was my Mr. Martin.
you know, my friend that I spent such a happy summer with.
but I thought the Martins were a middle aged couple with two daughters? Oh, no!
there is no older Mr. Martin.
young Mr. Martin runs the farm.
I'm surprised you do not know him.
he often visits Mr. Knightley and I am sure he knows you.
three apples, please.
it would be that way around.
he would know me but I'm not sure why I would know a farmer.
thank you.
Harriet, is there any reason why you would call that young man "your Mr. Martin"?
I meant my friend Mr. Martin.
tell me, what do you think of him?
is he so very plain? Do you think? He is remarkably plain
I suppose one would not expect very much of a farmer but I had no notion he would be so very clownish.
to be sure. He is not so genteel as a real gentleman.
Oh, I mean no offence, I'm sure.
a farmer has no need to be genteel, but I would have thought that now you have been exposed to some very good specimens of well bred, well educated men at Hartfield, you would be struck by how unfavourable a companion your Robert Martin presents.
miss Woodhouse. Another letter from Jane!
won't you and Miss Smith step inside for tea while I read it to you?
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Bates.
harriet and I are going to visit the poor.
we will come and listen tomorrow on our usual visit.
ah well, good then. Well, till tomorrow.
that was a very lucky escape.
I hope I never bore people a tenth as much about all the little Knightleys as Miss Bates does about Jane Fairfax.
I am sick of the very name Jane Fairfax.
every letter must be read 40 times over. She bores me to death!
which is a pity, because Jane, Frank Churchill and I are bound together in a mysterious sort of way.
Frank is like a lost boy, never to return home.
not even for his father's wedding.
how sad.
a letter from Jane, mother, to warm us.
I asked Miss Woodhouse if she would like to hear it, but she cannot.
she is so very busy on vicarage business, but never mind.
she will hear it tomorrow, on Wednesday, as usual.
now what did I do with my...Oh, yes, here we are.
I did wonder Mr. Martin didn't remember to read the book I suggested.
it was a romance.
he thinks too much of business for The Romance Of The Forest?
what kind of man is that?
if he is like that at... Four and twenty.
four and twenty, just think what he'll be like when he's older.
he will be a totally gross, vulgar, inattentive farmer who thinks of nothing but profit and loss.
I do wonder he did not remember the book.
Oh, don't be upset, Harriet.
let's cheer ourselves up.
let us think of superior men.
there are plenty more suitable suitors around.
that is a very good tree.
how accomplished young women are in all areas these days.
you flatter us, Mr. Elton.
Oh, yes, I see how you have tried to capture the, er, the light and the, the atmosphere...
so delicate yet so...
eloquent.
I remember you and Emma painting in exactly that way.
easels just so.
I suppose things must change.
I think her friendship with Harriet is a very good thing.
Emma is an excellent teacher, and you would not want her to be so lonely without me that she wished to be elsewhere?
elsewhere? Emma? No, not possible. Who would run the house?
Emma is no longer a child but a mature young woman.
my work as governess is done, but I will always be a friend to her and to you.
...this truly is, with no exaggeration... I have seen lesser works in...
Mr. Elton?
do you not think what an excellent subject the human form would be?
a watercolour of Miss Smith. What do you say to that?
Oh, yes, indeed.
a depiction by your fair hand of Miss Smith.
that, that would be perfection.
I think I should like that more than anything.
now, I must be going, just a short visit to thank you and, of course, Miss Smith for your sterling work in the parish.
what did I tell you? I knew there would be suitors soon enough.
whose portrait do you think
Mr. Elton has commissioned me to paint?
Whose?
why, yours of course. Oh, no, Miss Woodhouse.
are you sure? Absolutely!
what did he say to you before he left?
Oh, that my painting is coming along splendidly.
Oh, he really must be in love.
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, what shall I do?
how should I ever behave towards him?
Oh, do not worry, Harriet.
I will be your guide.
you will be married by the New Year.
robert Martin!
is that you?
no, no, Miss Smith.
you must keep your pose, like a statue.
the, er, the great artist must be allowed time to create.
not a fraction, Miss Smith.
the painting must be perfect.
you're quite sure this is a prudent course of action?
Yes, Sir.
hmm, the plan seems sound.
I've known you how long now?
and I've never known you put the farm at risk in any way.
are you sure you wouldn't be more sensible to consider this development in a few years?
how old are you? About four and twenty?
I am 24.
I do not want to waste my life.
I see no reason to delay something I have set my mind on.
then I'm surprised that you wish to hear my thoughts on your expansion project.
you don't strictly need my permission.
good luck, Robert.
thank you, Sir.
miss Smith? Yes.
there's too many pies, Amy...
excuse me.
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, Miss Woodhouse.
you will never guess.
calm down, Harriet. Whatever is the matter?
what should I do?
it is such a surprise. This was sent to me this morning.
it is a proposal from Robert Martin.
well, at least I thought it was when I read it.
it is a very good letter, is it not?
I'm sure, I do not know.
it is a delightful surprise.
or is it unwelcome?
but, well, he writes as though he loves me very much.
Well...?
well, is it a good letter?
or is it...
too short?
it is a good letter.
so much so I think it likely one of his sisters wrote it for him
but it is a better written letter than I expected.
I hope I am honest enough to say that.
well, what should I do?
what should you do? What do you mean?
Oh, in regards to the letter?
well, you must answer it, and straight away. Yes.
Yes, I knew you'd know.
but, oh dear, what should I say?
Oh, Harriet, no.
the wording of the letter must be all your own.
I'm sure you can manage.
you must be very clear and properly conscious of the pain you will inflict.
so you think I ought to refuse him, then?
ought to refuse...?
Oh, pardon me!
I imagined you asked me merely to advise you as to the phrasing
so you actually want to accept Robert Martin?
I don't know.
I, I do.
I don't.
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, please help me.
I can have nothing to do with your decision, Harriet.
it is up to you to know your own feelings.
I really had no idea he liked me so very much.
I think as a general rule, if a woman doubts whether to accept a man or not, she really ought to refuse him.
although, of course, I... I do not want to influence you.
but please, please do.
do influence me, if you would be so kind?
miss Woodhouse, I am determined.
I, I really am...almost.
I have made up my mind to...
refuse Mr. Martin?
do you think I'm right?
perfectly. Perfectly right. Oh, oh!
when you were all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now you are decided, I congratulate you!
Oh, oh, thank goodness I am in no danger of losing your company forever.
Oh, no, I could never have visited
Mr.s Robert Martin of Abbey Mill Farm.
Oh, now I am secure of my little friend forever.
Oh, dear Miss Woodhouse,
I would not give up the pleasure of your friendship for anything in the world.
however I really do think Mr. Martin an amiable young man, and so very attracted to me.
come, sit. You must write immediately.
it would be unfeeling and discourteous to delay your refusal.
what artistry, what perfection.
how cleverly you have suggested the, uh, the Greek atmosphere and the landscape, in only a few deft strokes.
what do you think, Mr. Woodhouse?
has Miss Woodhouse not surpassed herself on this occasion?
it's charming, extremely charming.
but don't you think Miss Smith should be wearing a more substantial shawl?
er, no. It is a summer scene, father.
young girls can get a chill even in sunny weather.
no, father, Miss Smith posed in this very room without the slightest fear of draught.
well, we don't want to encourage people to take unnecessary risks now.
well, I do not see how it could be bettered.
you have captured Miss Smith to perfection.
we must get it properly framed.
next time John and Isabella come, we'll get them to take it to London, have it framed for you.
but that may be some weeks away.
might I offer my services?
I could ride to town and back in a day on such a precious errand.
Emma, my dear.
I have done one of my three turns.
could I ask you for some help?
could you tie my scarf, make it a bit more secure?
do you think I should finish my walk?
of course, we must keep to routine.
Ah, Mr. Knightley. Do forgive me,
I have to walk and when I've started, I can't stop.
will you be all right with just Emma for company?
because I can always... Oh, I think Emma and I...
can manage by ourselves for now.
no Miss Smith today, looking fetching amongst the roses?
I thought she was becoming a fixture?
no, no, I'm not teasing you.
miss Smith is a pretty little creature and
I am inclined to think her character improved.
and I think she has improved due to your influence.
thank you.
and as you never praise me unless you can possibly help it that must be a compliment.
she will be here soon if she can extricate herself from the Highbury gossips.
tiresome wretches.
huh, it's possible that she is more tolerant of tiresome wretches than you are.
but maybe she is delayed on far more pleasant business?
Really? I have good reason to believe that your friend will soon receive good news.
and it is news that will appeal to you.
any of your brides and bridegrooms still live under there?
no. I am quite grown out of dolls.
so, let me tell you.
Mr. Robert Martin is desperately in love with your Miss Smith and means to marry her.
there. I have surprised you for once.
he came to speak to me about it, and despite my doubts about the match
I gave my blessing. This was the day before yesterday.
I must say I'm surprised your friend has been able to keep the good news to herself.
I thought he would have spoken yesterday. He was so determined.
how do you know that Mr. Martin did not voice his thoughts yesterday?
well I do not know it absolutely.
I thought she spent the whole day with you.
now I will tell you something.
Mr. Martin did speak yesterday.
that is, he wrote and he was refused.
then she is an even greater simpleton than I thought!
Oh, of course, it's incomprehensible that a woman would ever refuse an offer of marriage.
a man imagines a woman ready for anyone who asks her.
a man does not imagine any such thing.
harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin?
it's madness. Maybe you are mistaken.
I saw her answer. Nothing could be clearer.
you saw her answer?
hello.
you wrote it.
you persuaded her to refuse him. Emma, look at me!
this is your doing. I am sure of it.
you could never lie to me with any success.
Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man, I am sure.
but I will not agree that he is Harriet's equal.
no, he is not her equal. He is far her superior. Ha!
harriet Smith is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.
she's not a sensible girl and has been taught nothing useful.
she has no experience and little wit.
she is pretty, good tempered, maybe.
but that is all.
I felt that in all respects he could do no worse.
but he was so in love with her, he is so in love with her that he would not be reasoned with.
I even thought of you. I thought "even Emma will think that this is a good match."
I can't believe you know so little of Emma as to say such a thing.
a farmer, a good match for my intimate friend?
it would be a degradation.
a degradation?
for illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable, intelligent farmer?
there can scarcely be any doubt that her father was a gentleman, and a gentleman of fortune.
nothing has been begrudged her.
why should the child pay for the offences of others?
harriet is a gentleman's daughter, she associates with gentlemen's daughters.
she is therefore superior to your Robert Martin.
Emma, Emma, we live in the real world, where children do pay for the offence of their parents, and it does not appear to be in their plans to introduce Harriet into their society, whoever they may be.
but we live here in Highbury, where we treat people with the respect and courtesy they deserve
Harriet's friends, whoever they may be, thought Mr.s Goddard's boarding school and Mr.s Goddard's company good enough for Harriet.
and Harriet also thought it good enough until you encouraged her to think above her station.
she was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.
and Robert has no vanity.
he would not have proposed if he thought that she did not favour him.
I know that she must have encouraged him.
well then, let us, as you say, live in the real world, where men of course always reject a girl with a pretty face in favour of one with a well informed mind.
what? Oh, no, no, no.
I bow to your superior knowledge, your 16 years more experience.
you must know best.
Harriet, with her good looks and her easy temperament will be right at the back of the queue with your sex when it comes to choosing a mate.
now we have both made our argument, let us not quarrel.
really, it is better to be without wits than apply them as you do, Emma.
there. Don't you see how you add force to my argument?
men don't like girls who argue.
harriet is just the sort of girl every man wants.
she bewitches his senses and satisfies him that he is always right.
were you ever to marry, she'll be just the sort of woman for you.
mark my words - Harriet can pick and choose.
here she is, right at the beginning of her life.
why should she accept the first offer she receives?
excuse me.
thank you so much, Mr. Elton.
harriet will be so very grateful.
how can we wait a moment longer than necessary to see this painting framed and hung for all to see?
well then, goodbye, Mr. Elton.
safe journey.
that man is so full of himself
I'm surprised he can stay on that horse.
I've always thought it a bad friendship for you, Emma.
but now that I think of it, I think it is worse for Miss Smith.
men of sense do not want silly wives.
and most men of family will be afraid of the disgrace that they get caught up in if and when the mystery of her parentage is revealed.
you let her marry Robert Martin, she's respectable and happy forever.
you have encouraged her to set her sights higher, and she may end up at Mr.s Goddard's for the rest of her life.
we think so differently about this
I think we should stop talking about it.
and as for my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible.
harriet has refused him.
she must abide by her decision.
I do not pretend to have that much influence, just a little.
but really, his appearance was so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she certainly doesn't now.
what nonsense.
I really think it is time for tea and yet it has not appeared.
do you think I should call Father in?
well, I suppose it is no great loss - for Mr. Martin, that is.
he'll get over her soon, I hope.
but I know that your love of matchmaking means that you are more to do with this than you so modestly deny.
that is the real reason you are annoyed.
I gave my advice and you gave yours, but it was mine that prevailed and you do not want to admit it.
I am so pleased you have come back, for we will always be friends.
no, I came back to say this, Emma.
as you make no secret of your matchmaking,
I assume that you would not have taken this drastic step unless you had another suitor in mind.
and as a friend, I will just hint to you that if Elton is the chosen man, Elton will not do.
he knows he is a very handsome young man and will never marry cheaply.
I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies who all have 20, 000 apiece.
harriet and Robert are not your playthings, your dolls, to be told what to do and to marry under the table at your bidding.
they're flesh and blood!
and one day you will bitterly regret your meddling.
Mr. Knightley?
I didn't realise Mr. Knightley would be leaving so soon.
I knew I shouldn't have taken that last turn.
miss Fairfax. I'm so pleased to see you again.
you seem lost, Sir.
I'm not lost.
Mr. Frank Churchill.
I've heard so much about you, it is almost as if we had already met.
it's, it's just a small verse of a romantic nature.
I would like to know that Mr. Martin is not so very bitterly disappointed.
I've never seen a man more disappointed.
Mr. Dixon saved her life.
it was nothing.
why would she move home to Miss Bates' tiny little cottage when she could go to Ireland to Mr. Dixon's, no doubt, boundlessly beautiful estate?
I'm ashamed to arrive with you.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Emma.
it is all my fault?
I blame myself.
I adore you.
I think that I might die if you refuse me.
make me the happiest man in the world.
you never preferred Miss Smith?
no, my hopes were all entirely for you.
have you heard the news? Mr Elton is to be married.
miss Fairfax!
mr Dixon saved her life!
he was of course, standing very close to her.
it is a very elegant instrument.
Jane was quite at a loss as to who might have sent her this magnificent gift.
our Mr Knightley might just have turned his mind to matrimony.
no, no, I will not be drawn in.
as I have said,
I am done with predictions of the matrimonial kind.
I am merely telling you, as you have been so kind to bring the subject up again.
that I believe my nephew Henry is safe when it comes to inheriting Donwell.
I do not believe that Mr Knightley is the mysterious present giver
it is not in his nature to be secretive.
he is so discreet.
and so is she.
they are very well matched.
I think Jane would make a very good mistress of Donwell.
nonsense! Anyhow...
my career in match-making - such as it was - is over.
miss Woodhouse. Are you coming to view the instrument?
we would be so happy to have your opinion, Miss Woodhouse!
we were on our way.
Oh, Mr Frank Churchill is already here.
do be careful, ladies.
what do you think? Mrs Weston
miss Woodhouse, er, Miss Smith?
we have had to make room for it, but it is no inconvenience whatsoever...
so very kind of the Colonel.
what do you say to Mr Dixon?
goodness me...are you still mending mother's glasses?
you have been here so very long.
done. Thank you, Mr Churchill.
look, Mother...there.
now you can see again.
Oh... Mr Knightley, oh, Mr Knightley!
won't you come and view
Jane's surprise gift!
a surprise visit?
nothing untoward at all.
what do you think, Mr Knightley?
well, it is a very fine instrument indeed.
a very fine gift. We're all agreed.
Yes. Oh, I'm so delighted that Mr Knightley likes the piano.
it is a reckless gift...
thoughtless... look at the size of it.
Jane is to become a governess...
is it to stay here forever in her aunt's home?
the girl is in ill health... it is a sorry thing indeed.
morning, Miss Fairfax.
well, he may not have given her the piano but he is very concerned for her welfare...
I wouldn't say Donwell is entirely safe.
Oh, Mr Knightley...
I must thank you for the apples.
Oh, it was nothing.
but a whole barrel of your special variety - your cook told us that there are none left for your favourite pie...
so very generous.
they are Jane's favourite as well, isn't that a coincidence?
I have been here in Highbury two weeks yet I feel I have always lived here.
thank goodness your aunt's health allowed you to visit or you would never've realised how much better we are than you thought.
nonsense. I had always the best of anticipation, but...
please forgive me for this,
I think if there is one criticism
I would make about this wonderful place it is that there's just simply not enough opportunity to dance.
now, tell me that I am wrong?
I do believe you have hit upon our single defect, Mr Churchill.
what do you propose?
a ball, Miss Woodhouse, what say you to a ball?
I say yes.
Yes, indeed! I am so happy to have any opportunity to dance.
I am fairly sure that that is one talent in which I am equal of Jane Fairfax.
equal? You must be far her superior...
she dances like a cold fish!
now, let's have a ball here, hmm?
no, no, there's not room.
well, you were right, as always - how much better it is that we should be here in town, with plenty of space to dance all you wish!
come on, let's test the floor space!
where will we dine?
I think this room might be too small and the corridor is very draughty.
nothing must stop our momentum!
let's ask our neighbours, Miss Bates, what she thinks.
ladies, come up here and give us a hand, will you?
miss Bates? You won't get any sensible advice from her!
Shh!
miss Bates!
miss Bates. Miss Fairfax?
would you join us, please?
it's a capital idea!
miss Bates is a woman who is predisposed to be happy, and Jane could be one of our principal dancers.
I think I would rather the aunt than the niece.
I must have the first dance with you.
we two will lead the ball!
miss Bates,
I must show you this. What do you think of this space for a ball?
a ball? A ball.
what a marvellous idea, Mr Churchill, what a very splendid thing.
Oh, a ball! What a marvellous idea!
Oh, I hope nothing will prevent it.
I am so looking forward to it!
are you sure, Emma, that Mrs Weston has discounted the draughts in the corridor?
absolutely - she has been most scrupulous in her checking.
do you think you might come, Father?
there is nothing to stop the ball being a great occasion.
Frank Churchill and I have made a list and he will design the invitations.
I don't know why you have to be so unenthusiastic.
only young people can be expected to enjoy dancing.
but he is not so ancient. Are you saying you are not coming?
Oh, I will accept Mr Weston's kind invitation when it arrives...
if it is not too long in the design.
but I will not dance.
I do not enjoy dancing and I am not good at it.
you must wrap up warm, Emma, in case some of the young dancers do something remarkably reprehensible, like opening a window.
I think you would be more enthusiastic if Mr Frank Churchill were not so keen.
however, I have some information for you.
miss Jane Fairfax is looking forward to the ball.
I have never seen her so animated! About anything!
I assure you, my dear Emma that Mr Churchill will be indifferent to my indifference.
I hardly think I am already marked down on your dance card, now am I?
though we may guess who is.
his aunt is extremely ill.
Frank is so low, but he has said he is not leaving without seeing you.
he was very particular.
I shall leave you alone.
I am sure he cannot be about to say anything that you could not hear also.
I am sure he can.
what can he have to say?
to me alone?
must I really believe he is in love with me?
how should one look?
if one were supposed to be in love in return?
I don't think so...
how does it feel to be in love?
of all the horrid things... saying goodbye is the worst.
this will not be your only visit to Highbury?
now you have reacquainted yourself with where we are?
I don't know when I might return.
but it will be the only thing I think about.
our poor ball must be abandoned.
why did we wait? Why didn't we seize the moment!
you said we should not wait. Why are you always right?
I am sorry to be right this time.
I would much rather be merry than right.
so you must be off this morning? Er, yes.
you will come back...
I think we have impressed you, though you were not expecting to like us, admit it!
what a pity you have no time to visit your other friends before you leave.
miss Bates' steadiness and clarity of thought might have calmed your anxiety.
Oh, I have been there...
I, er, I thought it right...
my duty to tell them I must go.
in short...perhaps, Miss Woodhouse, as you know everything...
.you could hardly be without suspicion.
I thought I would be able to stay here forever.
my, erm, well, my...
my regard for this place is, erm...is very warm.
I must go.
the sensation of listlessness, "weariness, "stupidity, this inability to sit down and do anything.
this feeling that everything around the house is dull and insipid...
when it never was before...
it can only mean one thing.
I must be in love!
Mrs Elton, your castle awaits.
Harriet, please...
.for my sake, oh, no, I do not mean that...
for your sake...this terrible misery over the Eltons.
that there could not be any greater reproof for my mistake, it was all my doing, do not think I have forgotten it...
do not think I make light of it!
but you are the best friend that I ever had!
nobody is equal to you...
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, I have been so ungrateful.
I will try my hardest.
for my own sake...to be tranquil.
as always, I would like to begin today with some of the most spiritually uplifting words from the Old Testament.
words that I have found most comforting.
let deceitful lips be made dumb...
I declare this reminds me of Maple Grove.
my sister will love this house!
she delights to travel.
she has the latest carriage, large and comfortable enough for four and high enough that one can see for miles when one is travelling into the countryside for summer parties!
parties in the countryside!
we are a very quiet set of people - We like to stay in the home.
I understand your situation, Miss Woodhouse...
why does he not try Bath?
where the waters, I find, are so agreeable. My father...
it would cheer many an elderly gentleman up!
and for you, of course, who have lived such a secluded life, out of the best society...
well, just a line from me would open up a host of new acquaintances.
Oh, we have heard that you are very musical, Mrs Elton.
Oh, I dote on it! Dote!
as I said to Mr E - don't give me two carriages, don't give me enormous houses but
I could not live without music. No.
life would be a blank to me.
we should establish a musical club.
have regular meetings at yours or mine?
as leaders of society we should show the way.
who else have we visited? Oh, the Westons, of course.
I was rather astonished to find her so ladylike as I believe she was your governess?
Oh, and who do you think we met while we were at Randalls?
Knightley! Knightley himself.
he's so particular a friend of Mr E.
so often mentioned, I was impatient to meet him.
and... I must do my caro sposo the justice of saying, he need not be ashamed of his friend!
Knightley is quite the gentleman!
biscuits, darling!
Absolutely.
Knightley indeed...
never seen him in her life and she calls him "Knightley"!
insufferable woman!
horrible, upstart, vulgar being with her "Mr E" and her "caro sposo
and her carriages and air of pert pretention and under-bred finery.
actually to discover that Mr Knightley is a gentleman and that the woman who brought me up should be ladylike!
I've never met her equal!
Knightley" indeed!
I have known him all my life and even I don't call him that!
she's everywhere I go!
the guest of honour, droning on about her sister's brand new barouche...
you'd think we were all poor little pygmy people, who never travelled from our fire!
though in my case of course, she's right.
she had the cheek to say that maybe it was a good thing the ball had to be cancelled, because she didn't know whether the Westons could organise such an event without her experience in social occasions!
and you don't need to pretend to be disappointed the ball was cancelled.
I'm not going to pretend, but it really was very bad luck for you, Emma.
you don't get many opportunities to dance. Or to get out at all.
I've brought you a book from the Donwell library.
box Hill!
I hear you can see for miles!
there is no reason you shouldn't see for yourself.
we are in the same county, it's not the moon.
come on, stay under the umbrella, you'll get soaked if you get outside.
there's only one umbrella and there's two of us.
one of us will get wet.
good morning, Miss Fairfax.
Oh! Good morning, Mr Knightley.
I didn't realise you were visiting Hartfield.
Yes, just for a few days.
you're out early?
I like a walk before breakfast. It does me good.
not in the rain, surely?
I am going to the post office, it is not far.
I should turn back, if I were you. You'll get drenched.
boys! Henry, James, come along.
unlike you, Miss Fairfax, my wife and father-in-law are far from indifferent to the rain, so I must get the boys home.
will I see you tonight?
Emma's party for the new Mrs Elton.
we must be on our best behaviour! Of course.
Oh, is that a letter from Ireland? Yes. But, er...
I would love to read it.
no, I will read it to you later.
well, the children are in bed.
now, John, please. What?
please, be agreeable. Me? When am I not?
mr Weston is not here yet, he is usually all benevolence and friendship.
why on earth did you invite her if you can't stand the woman?
because it is my duty, of course, we are the foremost family in the neighbourhood.
now, please, be pleasant.
I hope you did not get wet on the way to the post office this morning?
and the letters? Not the, er, curse they often are?
yours are of business.
mine of...friendship.
Oh, they're the worst of the two.
business may bring money, friendship hardly ever does.
you are not serious. He is not serious, Miss Fairfax.
may we take it that you did receive a letter, from a loved one this morning, despite the weather?
perhaps from Ireland?
I'm sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of you being out in the rain at the post office this morning.
young ladies are delicate plants, you must take good care of your health.
I am much obliged by your concern, sir.
going to the post office in the rain.
you sad girl!
we shall have to do something about this!
Oh, well, the man who collects our letters every morning shall enquire after yours and bring them to you.
you are very kind. But I will not give up my walk.
no, my dear, I'm afraid it's settled.
excuse me!
I will not consent to your servant being troubled!
I, I, I think that it can be a very good idea to take a morning walk if possible, and you are not so far from the post office, and then, of course, there is the issue of privacy.
well, I obviously have to accustom myself to the ways of the countryside.
naturally, those of us from the city with modern manners would never dream of any indiscretion.
of course not, my dear. Thank you.
but remember the people of Highbury are quite...unsophisticated.
they do not have your experience of life.
quite so, and in Bath we would certainly have announced dinner by now.
dinner is served.
now, Jane, it's time we found you a position as a governess.
the very best positions are snapped up as soon as they become known.
Colonel and Mrs Campbell are in town by mid summer.
I must spend time with them. Please do not trouble yourself.
Oh, trouble! What nonsense.
no, I shall write to Mrs Partridge and tell her to be on the lookout.
thank you, but I would rather you didn't.
we'll find you a marvellous position.
I am sure that...when the time comes...I am not afraid of being unemployed for long.
Ah!
here comes my old beau!
I like him excessively.
he is full of old-fashioned politeness.
he's always praising my dresses.
see how he leads the way to talk to me.
what do you think of this one?
rather handsome, I think, not sure if it's over-trimmed?
I have the greatest dislike of the idea of being over-trimmed, quite a horror of finery.
Oh, Mr Weston, at last!
we were expecting you a little earlier.
good evening, Mr Weston. Miss Woodhouse.
I was late home from London and found this.
read it, my dear, it's for you.
you have opened it! Then you know full well what it says.
Mrs Churchill has taken a house in Richmond for her health!
Frank may now come and go as he pleases.
his aunt cannot keep him from us.
he can always be home.
I confess I have been longing to see Mr Churchill.
we are very much missing young and elegant company.
you'll be dancing again before long, Miss Woodhouse.
we shall have our ball after all.
miss Woodhouse.
you have arrived just in time to give your advice, will it do?
will it do? It's beautiful! It's magical!
Oh, how wonderful you look tonight, Emma. Doesn't she, my dear?
I thought I had come early to help.
he has asked everyone to come early to give their advice.
the dancing will have started before we know it.
Frank will be here somewhere, I'll fetch him.
is this how it should be?
is he still in love with me?
is Mrs Elton here? I have a great curiosity to meet her!
he is not still in love with me.
but I do not seem to mind.
Oh, my heavens, it's fairyland, it's nothing less than fairyland.
Oh, aren't we lucky, Jane, to have such friends?
look, so many friends.
look, Mr Churchill, come let me introduce you to Mrs Cole...
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, isn't it lovely?
it's like a dream.
it is magical, isn't it?
this is how they do things in Bath.
Mrs Elton will be disappointed.
what's the matter? She will expect it.
Oh, dear, Emma, what shall we do?
we fear that, erm, Mrs Elton expects to lead the dance.
Frank must dance with her.
er, no, no.
miss Woodhouse is my partner for the first two dances, lead or not.
well, why do you not lead her out?
remember, I am not dancing in my condition.
how do you like our Mrs Elton?
I don't like her at all.
ladies and gentlemen, the town square.
the room is most excellently contrived, is it not?
miss Woodhouse looks so brilliant tonight. So beautiful.
Yes. She and Mr Churchill are made for each other.
what are you doing over here with the old men and the card players?
I told you, I don't dance. Miss Woodhouse, the second dance.
the Ship's Cook.
Oh, I see you are watching MissFairfax, have you picked up any clues as to her mystery?
miss Bates told me she had received a letter from Ireland that made her very happy.
perhaps from her friend, Mr Dixon!
no, I was merely thinking how awful her hair looks.
so unbecoming,
I can't think what would possess anyone to look that way.
shall I go over and say something?
Oh, goodness me, no, the music is starting, we must dance.
do you care for another?
Oh, no, Mr E, I am sitting this one out.
I cannot dance every dance with the same degree of accomplishment.
I do not put myself at the front for all to admire, unlike some I could mention.
quite so.
do you not dance, Mr Elton?
most certainly, Mrs Weston, if you will dance with me.
I am not dancing tonight, sir.
Mrs Goddard, then?
though I am an old married man it would give me great pleasure.
you must excuse me, Mr Elton
I have danced my last reel, I'm afraid.
I see a young lady who I should very much like to see dancing.
miss Smith?
Ah, erm, Mrs Weston, you must excuse me, but I am an old married man and my dancing days are quite over.
no.
wait, wait, wait a minute.
Oh, how happy Miss Smith looks she is such a pretty girl.
how well she dances.
Oh, such food, it is the best I've ever tasted.
Oh, no coffee, thank you, for me. I never take coffee.
a little tea, please. Oh, here it is already, thank you.
thank you.
for what?
your secret is out.
you dance better than anyone.
I was completely mistaken in Mr Elton.
there is a littleness about him which you saw and I did not.
he always was a small man, made smaller by his wife.
I was convinced he was in love with Harriet, how could I have been so stupid!
I will do you the justice of saying that you would have chosen better for him than he did for himself.
miss Smith has some first rate qualities, infinitely preferable to a sensible man than Mrs Elton.
I was surprised by our conversation.
come on, young ladies, supper's over, time to start dancing again!
I am ready, sir!
Gilley's Market. Who will you dance with?
why, you, if you will ask me?
will you dance, dear Emma?
I danced so much I had sore feet. Wonderful.
I know, it was so charming.
it was probably the best dance.
Harriet?
Harriet!
what on earth happened?
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, it was awful.
I was walking back to school with my friend Miss Bickerton, when we were set upon by some villainous evil gypsies.
dozens of them. They wanted my money.
then, just in time, who should arrive...
Hey! What's going on!
.but Mr Churchill. Stop that!
on his horse.
such a thing has never happened before!
we have always been able to walk safely in the lanes around Highbury.
how very fortuitous it was that you just happened along when poor Harriet was so desperately in need of your help.
it was nothing. Oh, no indeed.
you are too modest, Mr Churchill.
I owe you my life!
I am sure of it!
miss Smith.
everything will be fine.
I would not be surprised if Harriet were about to fall in love for the third time this year.
you look much brighter. Thank you.
you have captured Miss Smith to perfection.
what a fool I was.
Oh, Harriet, when you are happily married, in years to come we will laugh about this.
Oh, no,
miss Woodhouse.
I will never marry. Oh?
this is a new philosophy.
please, tell me this is not because of Mr Elton.
him!
Oh, no.
if it were to do with anyone, that someone would be a man so superior to Mr Elton, on a much higher plane entirely.
Harriet, I know I promised and I fully intend never to interfere but do I gather that your resolution never to marry is because you feel the person that you might prefer
and remember my match-making days are strictly over is too superior to you to ever think of you?
Oh, believe me,
I have not the presumption.
I am not so mad.
but it pleases me to admire him from a distance.
to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world.
with gratitude, wonder and respect.
Oh, Harriet
I am not surprised that his service to you was enough to melt your heart.
Oh, yes! The very recollection of it!
and all that I felt at the time, when I saw him coming to my rescue, how very noble he looked!
how everything changed from perfect misery to perfect happiness.
Oh, it is very natural that you should be so grateful.
Oh, but, Harriet, beware.
I think you should check your feelings.
do not get carried away.
be observant of him, let his behaviour to you be your guide.
more wonderful things have happened there have been many happy and unequal marriages, but no more.
I am telling you this for we will never talk about this again.
no names shall pass between us and there will be no possibility of a mistake this time.
but you should know, I do approve of the man in question though we will never mention his name again.
Mrs Elton, the ball seems...
now, Jane, time is rushing by.
we must find you a good position.
come, come.
all the best places will be snapped up.
as I have told you before, I must wait until the summer.
there are plenty of places which deal in the governess trade.
Oh, dear! You make it sound like slavery.
Yes, your music will help you.
I am sorry, Emma, I really don't know what you've done for Mrs Elton to behave towards you in this way.
I cannot say that Mrs Elton's friendship is much of a loss to me
I am astonished, however, at how Jane Fairfax encourages her confidence.
maybe she lacks the sensible comfort of an equal friendship, little wonder she has to make do with the Mrs Eltons of the world.
we know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax.
anyone may know high highly I think of Miss Fairfax.
and yet, you may not be aware how highly?
the extent of your admiration may take you by surprise one day.
Oh, you've finally heard the gossip, have you?
hmm, Mr Cole told me of his suspicions weeks ago.
and what did you say to Mr Cole?
I told him I was not about to turn Miss Fairfax into Mrs Knightley.
she would not have me if I asked her.
I like Jane and admire her.
she's a charming young woman but she has a fault.
she is reserved, she's more reserved than she used to be and I like an open temperament.
until Cole mentioned it, the thought hadn't entered my head.
go and get it.
well, then, what do you have to say to that?
I say, I never saw a man so occupied with not being in love that I should not be surprised if we were yet to hear wedding bells.
Isabella has had five children.
this is true.
do you think it strange that I, her only sister, did not go to London for any of their births?
do you think it strange?
I was there, after all.
that's what I mean.
I do love Highbury and I have never felt like leaving.
and I could never leave Father, but...
the fact that I have no desire to travel might look strange to other people.
to Frank Churchill?
Oh, no, he doesn't think badly of me.
Mrs Elton, then?
you've never bothered about what people thought before.
even Jane Fairfax has friends and the desire to be with them in Ireland and Weymouth.
if you were to ask me,
I would say that you were in need of a project.
box Hill!
it will be a very small and intimate party, and we will only invite the people we like.
box Hill?!
Oh, yes! Well I will arrange everything.
I am so experienced in organising the carriages, leave the whole expedition in my hands!
I know Mr Weston is the friendliest man in the world.
I just wish he wasn't so friendly.
now I will have to suffer the Eltons and I was so looking forward to our trip to Box Hill!
I don't know, dear Emma it seems to me always best never to contemplate eating outside.
Mrs Elton's carriage horse is injured which means we all cannot go to Box Hill.
that woman ruins everything.
we are only to postpone.
we will go, Emma.
in the meantime, why don't you all come to Donwell?
the strawberries are ripe and those who wish to sit indoors may do so.
Oh, what a delightful idea!
I should like that best of all.
I shall wear a large bonnet and put a pink ribbon on my basket!
but how on earth will we all get to Donwell?
we could all go on donkeys!
a necessity, I think, for dusty country life!
Donwell Lane is never dusty but you may come on a donkey if you wish.
Oh, look, here comes Dr Perry.
good afternoon, Dr Perry. Good afternoon, everybody.
what happened to Dr Perry's plan of setting up a carriage?
couldn't he help us out for Box Hill?
I didn't know he had such a plan?
Ah, but you wrote about it to me, two months ago.
you did! In your letters!
Mrs Perry was very keen on it, had been trying to persuade him for ages.
are you all right?
it was a mistake, a mistake not to take a glass of water before stepping out into this heat.
you should be more careful, Miss Fairfax.
you know, Mr Churchill,
I think Dr Perry was thinking about a carriage but decided he couldn't afford it.
Mrs Perry told my mother about it.
Jane, do you remember her telling us?
er, Miss Woodhouse, have your nephews taken away your box of alphabet letters?
I think, well I think Miss Fairfax needs a rest.
we all need to relax with a simple game.
how good it is to be reminded of the child in us all.
some of us don't need to look that far.
how exciting. I do love a good game of alphabet squares.
you are so very good at the letters.
let's see what we have here.
I am sure we will...
I will take care of the invitations to your little strawberry party.
what invitations? Oh, I hope I can come?
as you can see, quite a few of the possible guests are here.
Yes, but as to the rest, leave it to me.
no, thank you, but I will manage myself.
married women are the best organisers, leave it to me.
no, there is but one married woman in the world who I could ever allow to invite what guests she please to Donwell.
Mrs Weston, I suppose.
no, Mrs Knightley.
and until she is in being, I will manage matters myself.
what have you got, Jane? Have you any others we can add to?
miss Fairfax?
Oh, do let me try.
I am so hopeless at games.
mr Knightley, will you help me?
Blunder!
well done, Harriet.
no, no! For shame!
I shall give it to her, shall I?
no, you mustn't.
no.
I did... I did not know that proper words were allowed.
Oh, yes, Jane, let's go. I will call the carriages.
well I hope the invitations will arrive in time for the strawberry picking.
Dixon
I am so glad you told Mrs Elton you would not need her help she really is insufferable!
and as for Mrs Knightley, we all wonder who she may ever be!
Emma.
may I ask, what the great amusement, or rather the poignant sting of the last word, "Dixon," that was given to you and Miss Fairfax?
it seemed to give you entertainment and was very distressing to Jane.
I could tell you, but you would not approve and would call me a gossip.
dear Emma, do you think that you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and the lady with whom you shared this joke?
between Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?
of course! Perfectly!
it's just that lately I have imagined that I saw a certain attachment, certain secret looks.
secret looks?
goodness me. Erm...no.
the joke was, I admit, a little indiscreet, but it was harmless and I promise you, nothing to do with any kind of attachment between them.
it is more that Miss Fairfax has an admirer and Frank and I are trying to work out who it is.
there.
a childish pursuit we young people like to indulge in,
I'm sure you would say.
mr Knightley,
I do not know why, but you do not like Frank Churchill.
I am sorry for that, but it does not mean that you should start to imagine all sorts of things about him and his behaviour that are mere fancy.
I know you are keen to protect me as an older brother would, and I know you think
I should behave as I should, and I promise you,
I would never do anything to truly injure Miss Fairfax ever again.
but if Frank Churchill were in any way attached to Miss Fairfax and I assure you he is not, then he wouldn't, he would never...
he would never share a little joke with you?
you surprise me! I have never known you so unjust!
or your judgement so inaccurate.
Frank Churchill is an amiable young man and I can vouch for his indifference to Miss Fairfax, believe me.
are you... Are you staying for supper? It is almost time and...
Oh, er, no, thank you.
but I... I just find the fire a little too warm for me tonight.
I was thinking how at home you look.
you might be mistress of this house!
I blame you entirely.
I cannot resist you, from the very first day I met you!
we shouldn't be talking such nonsense in front of seven silent people.
I'm going to leave this country just as soon as I can book a ticket.
Frank will be free.
though, of course, we are all very sad that Mrs Churchill has died.
he will be able to marry.
you know the Westons have always intended Emma...
I have felt exhausted for so long.
the greatest kindness you could do me would be to let me go.
badly done, Emma! I dare say she didn't understand.
I assure you she did! She has spoken of nothing else since.
mr Knightley is going to London.
this is a sudden idea, isn't it?
it is to be a substantial trip.
goodbye.
Hey, IT'S ME!
Yep. WE JUST LANDED.
okay. COOL.
the GUY'S NOT HOME FIVE SECONDS, - HE'S ALREADY CALLING KRISTEN. - OH BOY, HERE WE GO.
you N'T WANT HER THINKING YOU'RE DYING TO SEE HER, DO YOU?
turtle's RIGHT, E. LET HER THINK YOU'RE BUSY.
she's MY GIRLFRIEND, IDIOTS.
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE THINKS.
I DON'T HAVE TO PLAY GAMES ANYMORE. TELL THEM, VINCE.
come ON, WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS?
what KIND OF GIRLFRIEND WON'T COME SEE YOU WHILE YOU'RE AWAY WORKING?
the KIND OF GIRLFRIEND IN SCHOOL.
I WENT TO SCHOOL. HOW HARD IS IT TO CUT OUT ON THAT SHIT?
not THAT HARD WHEN YOU'RE HEADED FOR A G. E.D.
three MONTHS WITHOUT PUSSY, E. THAT'S ROUGH.
you're ALMOST A VIRGIN AGAIN.
why DO YOU THINK HE'S CALLING?
it's LIKE THE GUY GOT HIS HYMEN RESTORED.
Vince, YOU EVER GO THREE MONTHS WITHOUT PUSSY?
Vince AIN'T NEVER GONE THREE DAYS-- - WAIT, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
sophomore YEAR.
Really? - WELL, YOU HAD MONO.
good MEMORY, E. - Turtle: THAT SHIT DON'T COUNT.

no, SORRY, BRO.
polished IT OFF OVER THE GRAND CANYON.
we NEED AN EDDIE'S OUT HERE. L. A. PIZZA BLOWS.
Eric: WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET A GOOD SLICE IN L. A. ANYWAY?
tap WATER. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T GET A DECENT BAGEL EITHER.
except ON FAIRFAX.
there's DIFFERENT WATER ON FAIRFAX?
Yeah, VINCE. THE JEWS IMPORT IT FROM BOROUGH PARK.
I'm SERIOUS.
if THAT WERE THE CASE, THEN WHY CAN'T YOU GET GOOD SLICE ON FAIRFAX?
because JEWS DON'T MAKE PIZZA, IDIOT.
Eric: SO, GIVEN YOUR THEORY, DRAMA,
I SHOULD GET A DECENT PIZZA BAGEL AT CANTER'S.
Uh-huh. - WRONG, E. KOSHER MOZZARELLA TASTES LIKE TOFU.
tofu?
did YOU CALL FOR A CAR, TURTLE?
was I SUPPOSED TO?
no, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WALK HOME.
summer BREAK'S OVER, E. TIME TO GET YOUR SOLDIERS IN LINE.
guy's NOT MY SOLDIER. I INHERITED HIM.
Hey, FUCK YOU. - I HATE THE NEW SYSTEM.
check IT OUT.
you CALLED THEM AND ASKED THEM NOT TO TOW IT?
it WOULD BE COOLER IF I LEFT IT FOR HOMELAND SECURITY TO IMPOUND.
shotgun!
I HATE THE NEW SYSTEM.
all RIGHT, SO, REMEMBER
gardener, POOL GUY, NEWSPAPER, VET, ALARM COMPANY,
satellite, GELSON'S, DRY CLEANING,
and GET THE MLB PACKAGE HOOKED UP.
Oh, CALL YOUR BOY BUSEY, VINCE.
we're FINALLY GONNA ACCEPT THAT GIFT.
I HOPE IT'S NOT A SELF-PORTRAIT.
turtle, WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR? WILL YOU TAKE THIS STUFF IN?
Vince, I WANT HIS JOB. THE GUY'S SITTING ON EASY STREET.
turtle, PLEASE. YOU'RE LIKE A THREE-TIME LOTTO WINNER.
where YOU GOING?
three MONTHS, VINCE. THREE MONTHS.
Yeah, YOU WON'T LAST FIVE MINUTES.

Oh, FUCK. REALLY?
Yeah. BAD TIMING, HUH?
Yeah.
uh, YOU KNOW. I MEAN...
maybe, UH... - WHAT?
it's BEEN THREE MONTHS.
maybe A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE.
no.
Why? - BECAUSE...
that WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ME.
I've BEEN WAITING TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU FOR THREE MONTHS ALSO.
Yeah, BUT IT'S EASIER FOR GIRLS TO HOLD OUT.
no. ERIC.
I FEEL GROSS.
I FEEL FAT AND BLOATED.
well, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
Saturday NIGHT. - WHAT?
we CAN GET REALLY DRUNK.
and SINCE YOU'RE THIS BIG HOTSHOT MANAGER
making THE BIG BUCKS, WE CAN GET A ROOM AT THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL.
big BUCKS? I MADE $6, 000 ON THAT MOVIE.
okay, WELL, WE'LL SPLIT THE ROOM.
we'll HAVE THE BEST SEX EVER.
what ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
just KISS.
she WOULDN'T EVEN BLOW YOU? - OR GIVE YOU A NICE TUG?
that's BULLSHIT. - YOU ACT LIKE A PRIEST FOR THREE MONTHS,
the LEAST THE GIRL CAN DO IS SERVICE YOU.
that IS A LITTLE SELFISH.
had I SHOWN UP AND KRISTEN WAS MISSING A LEG,
I STILL WOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF BUSINESS.
Eric: YOU WOULD HAVE SEX WITH A GIRL ON HER PERIOD?
turtle: WHO WOULDN'T, MAN?
Hey, I'VE DONE IT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I HOPE FOR.
you GUYS ARE DISGUSTING. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER DONE THAT.
well, YOU SHOULD, ALTAR BOY.
because IT'S A FACT A GIRL ON HER PERIOD IS HORNIER.
and THERE'S NO NEED FOR A RAINCOAT.
it's LIKE FLAG DAY. - EXCEPT IT'S A WEEK. HOLD THAT!
what THE FUCK?
Hey, GUYS. I'M LLOYD, ARI'S NEW ASSISTANT.
Vince: WHAT'S UP, MAN? I'M VINCE.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
if ARI GIVES YOU A HARD TIME LET ME KNOW, ALL RIGHT?
what HAPPENED TO EMILY?
I DON'T KNOW. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK?
water. - WATER SOUNDS GOOD.
I'm GOOD.
what ARE YOU BEING AN ASSHOLE FOR? - YEAH?
a BIGWIG LIKE ARI SHOULD HAVE A HOT ASSISTANT TO LOOK AT.
Johnny, SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY THINK HE IS HOT.
I AIN'T ONE OF THEM PEOPLE.
come ON, TURTLE, LET'S GO.
the ONLY REASON WE STOPPED WAS TO SEE HOW EMILY TREATED YOU.
peace.
the BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!
you LIKE "GAYSIAN LLOYD"?
he's CUTE, RIGHT? AND HE COVERS TWO QUOTAS.
did YOU FIRE EMILY? - I HAD TO.
to MAKE SURE YOU WOULDN'T FUCK ANOTHER ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS.
you're NOT GONNA TRY TO FUCK LLOYD?
did YOU REALLY FIRE HER?
James CAMERON STOLE HER. SHE'S OVER AT LIGHTSTORM.
so, HOW WAS THE LITTLE MOVIE?
Ah, HONESTLY...
one OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE.
that's FANTASTIC. BUT YOU GOT IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM, RIGHT?
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.
I RAN INTO NEIL LABUTE IN NEW YORK.
he WANTS ME TO DO HIS PLAY IN LONDON.
six MONTHS, $300 A WEEK.
but I FIGURE WITH YOUR NEGOTIATING SKILLS YOU CAN GET ME $400.
Eric: AND IT'S VERY WELL WRITTEN.
Vince: OKAY, ARI, I'M JOKING.
I'm READY TO WORK. WHAT DO YOU GOT?
Hi, I'M CARLA.

I THOUGHT MAYBE AFTER "QUEENS BOULEVARD" WE COULD GET A MOVIE.
Oh, THIS IS A MOVIE. A MOVIE OF THE WEEK.
but I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM.
your HEADSHOTS
they're SETTING US BACK.
I've HAD THOSE SHOTS SINCE '92.
they've BEEN GREAT. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
the PROBLEM IS PEOPLE GET ANNOYED
when THEY EXPECT TO SEE A 24-YEAR-OLD.
does THIS LOOK LIKE YOU?
you READY? - LET'S GO, WE'RE READY.
this KID'S GOT NO PATIENCE.
in SOME COUNTRIES, THEY WOULD CUT OFF YOUR ELFIN FEET
for DISRUPTING THE MASTER'S FLOW.
how ABOUT I SHOVE MY ELFIN FOOT UP YOUR ASS?
you MISSED ME, DIDN'T YOU? - ARI, COME ON.
all RIGHT, YOU READY?
AQUAMAN"!
AQUAMAN? - "AQUAMAN," BABY!
it IS "SPIDERMAN" UNDERWATER! BOOM.

Uh-oh, TELL ME WHAT?

did YOU READ IT?
Ari: I KNOW ABOUT IT. IT'S AT UNIVERSAL.
this MOVIE IS GONNA BE THE NEW "SCARFACE.
which WAS OUR FAVORITE MOVIE GROWING UP.
Really? - HERE'S THE STORY.
I COME FROM THE GUTTER, THAT'S OKAY.
I GOT NO EDUCATION, I KNOW THAT.
there WILL BE NO STOPPING ME.
I GO STRAIGHT TO THE TOP, ARI!
this IS THE KIND OF STUDIO MOVIE WE WANT TO DO.
What're YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? - I'LL GET INTO IT.
but I'M ALSO DEEP INTO "AQUAMAN.
I GOT A MEETING WITH DANA GORDON.
well, SHOULD I BE THERE?
uh, NO.
unless YOU WANNA PULL UP HER CAR - OR SERVE US CREME BRULEE. - GO FUCK YOURSELF.
not GONNA WORK THIS YEAR. - WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
what DID I TELL YOU? - I CAN'T PLAY WITH THE GUY?
what's THE DEAL? WE GOTTA BATTLE.

he's NOT GETTING ANY. - OH, NO. YOU KIDDING ME?
you WANT ME TO GET LLOYD IN HERE
and HAVE HIM HARI-KARI YOU WITH HIS PECKER? OR NO?
no? I THOUGHT THE GIRLFRIEND WAS STILL IN PLAY.
bad TIME OF THE MONTH TO COME HOME.
you're LIKE ME. - YEAH? HOW SO?
I WON'T FUCK MY WIFE AFTER SHE PLAYS TENNIS.
listen, HERE'S THE DEAL.
I GOT OTHER THINGS TO DISCUSS WITH DANA GORDON.
so YOU SET YOUR OWN MEETINGS.
but, VINNIE, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
warner's LOVES YOU. KNOW IT.
this YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO JUMP TO THE NEXT LEVEL, BABY.

I'd SAY HUG IT OUT, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU DRAWING WOOD.

I'm RIGHT HERE. - WHAT'S GOING ON?
everything. JUST LIKE YOU ASKED.
it's CHAOS OUT THERE.
you COULDN'T SPREAD THINGS OUT?
I HAVE MY SYSTEM, YOU HAD YOURS.
what IS THIS THING OUT HERE ON THE FRONT LAWN?
that's BUSEY'S GIFT. IT'S "A PSYCHEDELIC TOTEM POLE.
I THOUGHT HE WAS GIVING US A PAINTING.
I TOLD HIM I LIKED THAT ONE BETTER.
we DON'T OWN THIS HOUSE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH IT WHEN WE MOVE?
leave IT. IT'S UGLY AS SHIT.
I TOLD HIM VINCE WOULD TAKE A PICTURE IN FRONT OF IT, THOUGH.
now YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF.
maybe YOU SHOULD TRY DOING MY DOG SHIT JOB
and I SHOULD TRY BEING VINCE'S MANAGER.
I DID YOUR JOB. - NOT LIKE THIS.
Vince NEVER YELLED AT YOU.
you YELL AT A GUY, YOU BREAK HIS SPIRIT.
Ah. - VINCE, DOES HIS NEW TITLE
allow HIM TO YELL AT ME ALL THE TIME?
that WAS IN HIS DEAL. SORRY.

what DAY IS SHE ON, E? - WHO?
KRISTEN-- WHAT DAY OF HER PERIOD IS IT? - DAY TWO.

Nope, I'M FINE. DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT.
just GOTTA MAKE IT TO SATURDAY NIGHT.

I THOUGHT THE WHOLE REASON PEOPLE HAVE GIRLFRIENDS IS FOR EFFORT-FREE SEX.

exactly. WHOEVER HEARD OF A GIRL WHO CYCLES MID-MONTH ?
Mm-hmm. - WHEN DO YOU CYCLE, DRAMA?
Hey, TURTLE, LET'S GO OUTSIDE AND TAKE A COUPLE SHOTS.
I ALREADY TOOK CARE OF YOUR HEAD SHOTS.

the GUY CHARGES FIVE GRAND TO SET UP A LIGHT.
I ALREADY TOOK CARE OF THIS, DRAMA.
so, I'LL PAY. IT'S YOUR CAREER.
you CAN'T FUCK AROUND WITH IT.

Vince DON'T PAY FOR SHIT OF MINE.
everything's ON MY TAB. TELL HIM, BRO.
it's ALL A LOAN, OKAY? SO BORROW THE MONEY.
it's NOT THE MONEY.
it's THE PRINCIPLE. I CAN'T LET THEM WIN.

I SHOULD GET A FUCKING PULITZER.
Ari, VINCE DOESN'T WANT TO DO "AQUAMAN.

turtle FOUND IT ON THE SUBWAY. WHAT'S IT MATTER? WE WANNA DO IT.

the ONLY DIFFERENCE IS, I MIGHT HAVE A SHOT.
we DON'T HAVE A SHOT? - NO-- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
they're OUT TO A GUY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM.
his NAME IS TOM CRUISE. - TOM CRUISE IS GONNA PLAY PABLO ESCOBAR?
the GUY IS NOT EVEN HISPANIC.
hillary SWANK HAS A VAGINA.

I GET IT. I GET IT, OKAY.

right OUT OF THE BUSINESS. THAT WOULD ROUGHLY BE EMBARRASSING.
that IS NOT TRUE. YOU'LL BE SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE
when YOU SEE "QUEENS BOULEVARD.
we NEED A CAREER INTERVENTION, IS WHAT WE NEED.
no MORE ARGUING. NO MORE BULLSHIT.
we're GOING TO SIT DOWN, THE THREE OF US,
and I'M GOING TO LAY OUT FOR YOU CLEARLY,
what OUR OPTIONS ARE.
this TOWN IS LITTERED WITH THE TRASHED CAREERS
of THE "ONCE UPON A TIME" MOVIE STARS.
don't LET OUR BOY BE A CAUTIONARY TALE.
okay. WELL, I CONCEPTUALIZED THIS
when I WAS ON A WALK-ABOUT IN THE BADLANDS.
and I STUMBLED ON THIS BRIAR PATCH OF BERRIES.
and I ATE EVERY BERRY I COULD SEE,
because I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE NURTUREMENT FROM THE EARTH TO ME.
Vincent. TEETH.
and AFTER I ATE THE BERRIES, THIS CAME TO ME.
each ONE OF THESE REPRESENTS...
don't EVER COMMIT TO SHIT WITHOUT TALKING TO ME FIRST.
I GOTTA HAVE SOME FREEDOM TO OPERATE, E.
you GOTTA EARN FREEDOM. - WHY DIDN'T YOU GET THIS GUY TO DO MY SHOTS?
he's A REAL PRO. - ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK YOU.
and FUCK YOU, ALL RIGHT? THAT'S IT, I'M DONE. I QUIT.
what's HE QUITTING?
he GETS PAID?
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A WORD IN THE EARTH LANGUAGE - OR IN THE DICTIONARY TO DEFINE... - Vince: MM-HMM.
Gary: ...WHAT IT DID TO ME. BUT IT WAS UP IN HERE.
it WAS IN MY HEART, MY SPIRIT, MY SOUL, MY MIND, MY EMOTIONS.
no ANXIETY... - GARY, HOW MANY PICTURES DO WE NEED?
one PERFECT ONE. IT COMES FROM THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AFTER IT'S SET.
it's 11: 30 NOW, GARY.
I KNOW IT IS. BUT WE MUST WAIT FOR THIS PRECIOUS TIME.
well, WE HAVE A MEETING.
your MEETING AND YOUR FUTURE IS MEANINGLESS.
Gary, A COUPLE MORE PICTURES AND THAT'S IT.
Gary: GUYS, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
what's MORE IMPORTANT...
Oh, GREAT. NOW WHAT?
got A BIG ONE FOR YOU FELLAHS TODAY.
yo, "H&H BAGELS." ALL RIGHT!
how YOU DOING, BLAKE? - WHAT'S HAPPENING?
yo, CHECK IT OUT. "CARNEGIE KNISHES.
nice!
what ELSE YOU GOT?
whatever THIS IS.
Oh!
Eddie's PIZZA"!
what A SCORE. IT'S LIKE BEING BACK IN NEW YORK.
nice, E! - I DIDN'T DO IT.
who DID?
Jesus, E.
you NEVER CAME UP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
yo, GREAT JOB, TURTLE. COME DOWN HERE!
Yeah, TURTLE, GOOD JOB!
Oh, ANY CORNED BEEF?
I'm NOT COMING OUT TILL ALL OF YOUS APOLOGIZE.
and THAT MEANS YOU, TOO, VINCE.
I'm SORRY.
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.
sorry, TURTLE!
now THE "LUCKY CHARM.
come ON, E.
Yeah, COME ON. THIS IS IMPRESSIVE.
whose DHL NUMBER IS THIS?
it's ARI'S.
I'm SORRY.
I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE THAT.
get DOWN HERE AND HELP US CARRY THIS SHIT.
Yeah, THAT FIGURES.
these ARE GREAT.
yeah? - YEAH!
Yeah, EXCEPT, WHAT'S WITH THE BIG APPLE BEHIND YOUR HEAD?
Ah, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
this IS OUR YEAR, JOHNNY.
can YOU FEEL IT?
so, TWICE IN TWO DAYS, HUH?
must BE IMPORTANT.
e DIDN'T EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO YOU?
did YOU EXPLAIN TO E THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY LUNCH?
I WOULD HAVE WAITED FOR MY PIZZAS TO DEFROST.
you DIDN'T TELL HIM WHAT I TOLD YOU?
I TOLD HIM YOU WANTED TO AND TALK.
I THOUGHT WE JUST SAT DOWN AND TALKED.
what's THE SITUATION, ARI?
you SEEM STRESSED. - UH...
Yeah. WE CAN'T GET "MEDELLIN.
why NOT?
because THEY'RE LOOKING AT OTHER PEOPLE.
so CALL AND TELL THEM TO LOOK AT ME.
you DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE?
you're THE "MOST POWERFUL AGENT IN THE BUSINESS.
one OF THE MOST POWERFUL, YEAH.
no, YOU SAID WHEN I SIGNED WITH YOU
you WERE "THE MOST POWERFUL." HE SAID THAT TO YOU?
a BUNCH OF TIMES. - SHUT THE FUCK UP, ERIC!
listen, ARI, SNAP OUT OF IT, ALL RIGHT?
if THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT ME, YOU CALL THEM.
tell THEM TO LOOK AT ME.
they'll LISTEN TO YOU, ALL RIGHT? WE COOL?
I'm STARVED. LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
Vince, WE HAVE TO DO "AQUAMAN.
you DIDN'T TELL HIM ANY OF THIS?
no, HE TOLD ME. HE TOLD ME, OKAY?
and ERIC ALSO TOLD YOU THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO "AQUAMAN.
if WE CAN'T GET "MEDELLIN,
then WE WILL WAIT FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT I LOVE.
for THE PAST THREE MONTHS,
while YOUR BOY HAS BEEN SITTING ON YOUR INDY SET POURING CREAMERS
and GETTING NO PUSSY, I HAVE BEEN SCOURING THIS TOWN FOR AN OFFER.
it AIN'T OUT THERE.
come ON.
okay.
here's AN OFFER FOR YOU TO STAR...
in A NEW OLSEN TWINS' MOVIE.
it's A LOVE TRIANGLE IN WHICH LITTLE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY
use YOU AS AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF YOU CAN TELL
if THEY ARE TWO SEPARATE, DISTINCT PEOPLE.
this WOULD BE MILDLY AMUSING
if THE PRODUCER DIDN'T THINK HE HAD A REALISTIC SHOT OF GETTING YOU.
it AIN'T EIGHT MONTHS AGO, MAN.
listen, YOU COOLED OFF.
the $5 MILLION OFFERS DO NOT EXIST.
but WARNER'S LOVES YOU, SO "AQUAMAN" DOES.
what DO YOU THINK, ERIC?
we SHOULD READ "AQUAMAN" AND THEN SEE WHAT'S WHAT.
excellent REPRESENTATION. NICE WORK, E.
you KNOW WHAT I THINK? I WOULD RATHER QUIT THE BUSINESS
than TO DO MORE SHIT THAT I DON'T LOVE.
I've DONE THAT.
and YOU KNOW WHAT, IT SUCKS.
I WAS ONLY PARTIALLY JOKING ABOUT NEIL LABUTE, ARI.
I'll GO DO A PLAY.
I'd RATHER DO A PLAY THAN THIS BULLSHIT.
don't FORGET, I CAME FROM NOTHING.
as MUCH AS I LOVE THE TOYS, I DON'T NEED THEM.
well, THAT WENT WELL.
I DON'T WANT THIS TO GET TO A PLACE
where YOU START TO BLAMING ME FOR EVERYTHING.
you GUYS DON'T LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO THIS
you TELL YOUR BOY TO DO "AQUAMAN,
or YOU TELL HIM TO FIND OTHER REPRESENTATION.
yo!
my HEADSHOTS WERE A MONSTER HIT.
this IS GONNA BE A GREAT FUCKING YEAR.
can YOU FEEL IT? - MM-HMM.
so, FIRST PARTY AT THE NEW PLACE, HUH, DRAMA?
don't BE IGNORANT, E. IT'S NOT A PARTY, IT'S A GET-TOGETHER.
and THE DIFFERENCE IS WHAT, JOHNNY?
get-together IS LESS THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE, BRO.
Oh, YOU DON'T BE IGNORANT, DRAMA, 'CAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE A PARTY.
or SIMULTANEOUS GET-TOGETHERS IF IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR YOU TO SWALLOW.
what ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?
we're WELCOMING HOME VINNIE CHASE! OPLE WANT TO COME.
I THOUGHT WE AGREED TO KEEP IT SMALL-- A FAMILY AFFAIR.
I NEVER SIGNED ANYTHING.
if YOU WANT TO DO IT AT THE HOTEL...?
no NO NO, BRO, THIS IS YOUR WELCOME-HOME PARTY.
we CAN'T DO IT AT A HOTEL.
now THAT I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOME,
I'd BE HONORED TO WELCOME YOU AND YOUR PARTY.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE. - TURTLE?
Ari: Calm down, baby! - DO NOT TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, ARI!
they're GIVING MY SON A HARD TIME!
my baby boy. A mother gets protective when that happens.
what DID THEY SAY? DID THEY SAY THAT HE'S NOT GETTING IN?
they WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ON THE PHONE,
just THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE US. THEY'RE LIKE THE CIA.
then RELAX. HE'S GETTING IN.
well, HE BETTER, ARI. - He's a legacy!
little JONAH WILL BE A PROUD MEMBER OF THE BRIAR COUNTRY DAY SCHOOL
just LIKE HIS SISTER, FEAR NOT.
begging WON'T BE ENOUGH IF HE ISN'T, ARI.
I GOT TO GO, BABY. I'LL SEE YOU AT THE SCHOOL.
welcome VINNIE CHASE HOME TONIGHT.
here's THE ADDRESS. WELCOME VINNIE CHASE HOME TONIGHT.
welcome VINNIE CHASE HOME TONIGHT. HERE'S THE ADDRESS.
Hey. - SORRY, LIMITED SPACE.
what? I DIDN'T INVITE THE DUDE.
Lloyd, YOU MISS US? - I DID, I DID.
welcome BACK, BOYS. - LLOYD, HOW ARE YOU?
great. - WHAT UP, LLOYD?
nothing, NOT MUCH.
so I SPENT ALL EVENING PREPARING A LITTLE SOMETHING
for THE BIG BASH-- CREME BRULEE.
it's NOT A BASH, LLOYD. IT'S A LARGE GET-TOGETHER.
whatever IT IS, DRAMA,
is IT OKAY IF I BRING FOUR FRIENDS?
what SORT OF FRIENDS?
it's FINE, LLOYD. JUST NO PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION, ALL RIGHT?
is THAT VINNIE CHASE? - HE
Oh MY GOD! LOOK AT THAT!
I DON'T BELIEVE-- USUALLY I HAVE TO GET "US WEEKLY
to GET A LOOK AT THOSE PRETTY EYES.
and THEN I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WEE BOTTOM, LOWER CORNER OF THE FRAME
to SEE THE TOP OF THIS LITTLE MAN'S HEAD.
Whoo-hoo! - YOU LOOK A LITTLE PUDGY, ARI.
you PUT ON A LITTLE WEIGHT? - YOU WISH! SIX PERCENT BODY FAT.
achieve THAT WHEN YOU'RE 40, AND I'LL GIVE YOU A HUNDRED GRAND.
When'd YOU GET IN? - LATE LAST NIGHT.
you COMING TO THE WELCOME-HOME PARTY?
we UNDERSTAND IF YOU CAN'T KE IT.
I WILL BE THERE. FIRST THINGS FIRST.
do I LOOK HEAVY? - NO, YOU LOOK GOOD.
Yeah, BABY! - WHAT?
Oh, THIS BROAD I MET ON MYSPACE, SHE'S COMING
with HER SORORITY.
so, ITALY WAS GOOD? - OH, IT WAS AMAZING.
leave IT TO E TO PICK THE MOST ROMANTIC SPOT ON EARTH - RIGHT AFTER HE GETS DUMPED. - SLOAN AND I ARE TAKING A BREAK.
whatever. SO, YOU PLANNING ANOTHER VACATION - OR YOU GONNA STEP UP...? - VINCE IS PLANNING ON GOING BACK TO WORK, ARI.
okay, AS AN ACTOR,
or AS A PRODUCER OF ANOTHER JUNGLE QUAGMIRE?
the MOVIE THAT'S GONNA TAKE US UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL, - YOU'RE WRITING IT OFF AS A DISASTER? - NO NO NO.
I AM WRITING IT OFF AS MIA
and PROCEEDING ACCORDINGLY.
he ALWAYS WAS SO NERVOUS.
I KNOW-- IS THAT HOW YOU KEEP THE POUNDS OFF, ARI? BY TREMBLING?
what DO YOU EXPECT? "MEDELLIN" HAS BEEN DELAYED MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH.
you've GOT A DIRECTOR WHO REFUSES TO SHOW A SINGLE FRAME TO ANYBODY.
HUH-UH, WE'RE SEEING IT TODAY. - BULLSHIT.
every FRAME OF IT. WHY DO YOU THINK WE CAME BACK?
that AND WE'RE OUT OF MONEY. - OH, THERE'S THAT.
are YOU? - YOU KNOW THEY CHARGE UP TO $30 FOR A BOWL OF PENNE?
Vince WANTS A JOB, ARI. TELL US WHAT YOU GOT.
I GOTTA SEE THE MOVIE. - Vince: NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
Walsh WON'T EVEN LET RUBINSTEIN SEE IT.
he UNDERSTANDS THAT AT SOME POINT EVERYONE'S GONNA NEED TO SEE IT, RIGHT?
at SOME POINT, EVERYONE WILL. WE'RE SEEING IT TODAY
and WE'RE TELLING YOU THAT VINCE NEEDS A JOB.
and I'M TELLING YOU THAT I NEED TO SEE THE MOVIE.
what DOES ONE THING HAVE TO DO WITH THE OTHER?
connect THE FUCKING DOTS, E. - WHAT, NO ONE'S GONNA HIRE ME - UNTIL THEY'VE SEEN "MEDELLIN"? - I WOULDN'T SAY NO ONE.
Ah, YOU CAN PLAY JUGHEAD IN A NEW ARCHIES LIVE-ACTION.
I THINK I'M MORE OF A REGGIE. - YEAH.
right NOW, NO ONE IS GONNA OFFER YOU SOMETHING YOU WANT
or GIVE YOU THE KIND OF MONEY THAT WE WANT.
you CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?
actually, I CAN'T. - THE WORD ON THE STREET
since DAY ONE OF PRODUCTION ON "MEDELLIN
has NOT BEEN GOOD.
dps AND ACTORS FIRED, PRODUCTION DELAYS, UNSTABLE DIRECTOR.
no ONE WANTS TO PUT VINCE'S FACE ON A POSTER
with THE POSSIBILITY OF A LOOMING DISASTER HANGING OUT THERE.
it's THE "GIGLI" EFFECT. - WOW.
okay, SO WHAT DO WE NEED, ARI?
we NEED FOR "MEDELLIN" TO BE GOOD, E.
just TELL ME THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE MORE THAN 75 PEOPLE.
there's NOT GONNA BE MORE THAN 75 PEOPLE.
Really? - NO, NOT REALLY.
but THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO TELL YOU. - DICK.
why DO YOU NEED BABY WIPES?
just GET WHAT'S ON THE LIST.
50 CARTONS? - PLEASE, DON'T QUESTION ME, ALL RIGHT?
all RIGHT, FINE FINE.
it SAYS "12 BARBECUED CHICKEN WINGS." YOU MEAN 1200?
no, I MEANT WHAT I WROTE-- 12. THEY'RE FOR VINCE.
he LOVES THE WINGS AT COSTCO,
but I'M NOT LETTING EVERYONE ELSE GO WILD WITH BARBECUED CHICKEN WINGS.
so WHAT'S EVERYONE ELSE GONNA EAT, THEN?
celery. READ THE LIST.
celery? - YEAH, AND CARROTS.
look, THE PARTY'S CALLED FOR 9: 00 P. M.
that's NOT A DINNER PARTY. SO ONLY VINCE IS GONNA EAT REAL FOOD.
everyone ELSE IS GONNA HAVE NICE, CLEAN, STAIN-FREE - CELERY AND CARROTS. - GREAT.
think YOU GUYS HAVE ENOUGH BABY WIPES?
no NO, IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE-- THEY'RE FOR A PARTY.
you WANNA COME?
Vince: YOU LIKE THAT ONE, HUH?
I COULD DO A PLAY. - YOU COULD.
a PLAY'S NOT GONNA BUY US A NEW HOUSE, THOUGH.
Yeah, IT'D HAVE TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL PLAY, I THINK.
Uh-oh, CAVALRY'S ARRIVED. PEOPLE, MAN YOUR POSTS.
prepare TO DO BATTLE.
he LOOKS GOOD. HOW ARE YOU, BILLY?
living AND THRIVING, SUIT. LIVING AND THRIVING.
what's UP, BILLY? - VINNIE, HOW YOU DOING?
just THIS. NOTHING ELSE UP.
come ON BACK. I'LL SHOW YOU THE FACILITIES. COME ON.
wow, CUTTING THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, HUH?
why FUCK A WOMAN WITH A VIBRATOR WHEN YOU'VE GOT A DICK, - RIGHT, SUIT? - I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
but WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, BILLY.
Hey, EVERYBODY! YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS GUY'S BEAUTIFUL FACE
for THE PAST THREE MONTHS. VINNIE CHASE.
and THIS IS HIS SUIT THOUGH HE DON'T DRESS THE PART.
guys, MY WHOLE CREW IS LATIN
helped MAKE THIS FILM AS ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC AS IT COULD BE.
my EDITOR, RAUL, AND HIS ASSISTANT-SLASH-LITTLE- BROTHER, TERO.
both MEXICAN. BOTH TOTALLY LEGAL.
my POST GUY IS BRAZILIAN.
the CATERERS ARE FROM CHILE.
every THURSDAY WE GET THAT ENDANGERED SEA BASS FLOWN IN.
what's SHE DO? - SHE GIVES BLOWJOBS.
- SERIOUSLY.
she's A STREETWALKER I BROUGHT BACK FROM COLOMBIA. GOOD EYES.
so CAN WE GET THIS THING GOING OR WHAT?
you WANT TO EAT FIRST? YOU WANT SOMETHING?
I'm OKAY. - WE GOT EMPANADAS.
no, I'M ALL GOOD. - YOU WANT AN EMPANADA, SUIT?
we JUSATE, BILLY. - HOW ABOUT A TAMALE?
we're ALL GOOD. - WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THOSE BLOWJOBS?
one OF THOSE? - NO.
what, DOES TURTLE CHECK YOUR BALLS FOR LIPSTICK?
quit STALLING, BILLY. - I'M NOT FUCKING STALLING.
Billy, WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IT, COME ON.
and I WANT YOU TO SEE IT, VIN. I DO.
uh, IT'S JUST NOT READY.
it's-- IT'S NOT READY. I NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - HOW MUCH MORE TIME?
three WEEKS, A MONTH TOPS. - YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.
who SAYS? - I SAY.
who THE FUCK ARE YOU? - THE GUY WITH THE FUCKING CHECKBOOK.
Billy, WE JUST FLEW IN FROM ITALY. YOU SAID YOU'D BE READY.
I THOUGHT I WAS READY, MAN. I THOUGHT I WAS,
but I WATCHED IT THIS MORNING AND I'M NOT.
Billy, LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NERVOUS.
but WE'VE BOTH SEEN FIRST CUTS-- WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.
I CAN'T, VIN. IT'S JUST NOT READY.
you ONLY GET ONE CHANCE FOR A FIRST IMPRESSION.
all RIGHT, LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL, BILLY, OKAY?
we SEE THIS FILM TODAY OR NOT ANOTHER DOLLAR COMES INTO THIS FACILITY.
not FOR CIGARETTES, NOT FOR COFFEE,
not FOR SEA BASS AND NOT FOR FUCKING BLOWJOBS,
do YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?
Yeah, I DO.
Raul, PREPARE THE PROJECTOR.
I'm JUST GONNA PISS REALLY QUICKLY, OKAY?
was I TOO HARSH? - NO, PERFECT.
sorry, VINNIE! GO FUCK YOURSELF, SUIT!
maybe YOU WERE A LITTLE HARSH.
so? - SO.
Mrs. Ari: SO.
this IS AWKWARD. - WHAT'S AWKWARD?
we-- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE.
but WE ARE CONCERNED. - MM-HM.
we're VERY CONCERNED. I MEAN, WE KNOW JONAH
just HAD HIS EVALUATION. BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS A FORMALITY.
I MEAN, HE'S A LEGACY.
and WELL, HIS SISTER SARAH HAS BEEN A MODEL STUDENT HERE - FOR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS. - Ari: MM-HM.
we CAN NEVER MAKE ANY GUARANTEES.
that's-- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID WHEN I WAS WRITING ALL THOSE DONATION CHECKS.
so, WAS THERE A PROBLEM WITH JONAH'S EVALUATION?
well, HE DID HIT A KID WITH A RULER.
Yes, HE TOLD US THAT. - HE TOLD US ALL
the KID WAS TRYING TO STEAL HIS POWER RANGER. HE TOLD US ALL ABOUT IT.
and I TEACH MY SON NEVER TO LET PEOPLE JUST TAKE THINGS FROM HIM.
it's MY ISRAELI BLOOD, OKAY?
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T TELL US THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE - TO GO TO SCHOOL HERE BECAUSE OF THAT? - I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.
this IS JUST A COURTESY. - A COURTESY?
we WANT YOU TO HAVE TIME TO APPLY TO ANOTHER SCHOOL, JUST IN CASE.
just IN CASE WHAT?
just IN CASE HE DOESN'T GET IN.
Mrs. Ari: WHAT A SMUG BITCH.
I MEAN, JUST SITTING THERE WITH THAT STUPID LOOK
on HER STUPID FUCKING FACE.
baby, THE CURSING. WE'RE AT THE SCHOOL. - I'M SORRY, I'M UPSET.
I KNOW, IT'S KIND OF HOT. I LIKE IT.
Ari, WHY AREN'T YOU UPSET? - SHE'S JUST A SECRETARY,
a LOW-LEVEL MESSENGER. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEAL WITH THAT.
so WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? - WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR OLD BUDDY,
Dr. REICH. A HIGHER LEVEL.
what CAN HE DO? - HE IS ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, BABY.
all RIGHT, WE DIDN'T SPEND ALL THOSE NIGHTS
at HIS QUEER PIANO PARTIES FOR NOTHING. HE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
I THINK I SHOULD GO WITH YOU.
baby, THIS IS MAN'S WORK. - MAN'S WORK?
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO APPLY A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE.
trust ME, YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS, ALL RIGHT?
don't WORRY, I'M GONNA HANDLE IT.
trust ME.
damn, DRAMA, THIS PLACE IS LOOKING GOOD.
Yeah, AND IT'S GONNA KEEP LOOKING THAT WAY, SO TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF.
you WANT ME TO TAKE MY SHOES OFF?
everybody's GONNA BE GOING SHOELESS TONIGHT, TURTLE.
so DON'T THINK YOUR SMELLY FEET ARE GETTING ANY SPECIAL ATTENTION.
there's GONNA BE A SIGN RIGHT THERE THAT SAYS "NO SHOES
and A BASKET RIGHT THERE TO HOUSE THEM.
well, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET A SIGN AND A BASKET FOR BRAS, 'CAUSE THESE SORORITY GIRLS, THEY SOUND KINDA FREAKY.
well, THEY JUST BETTER BE NEAT.
grab THAT END. - WHERE'S IT GOING?
in THE BEDROOM. IT'S ONLY TWO WEEKS OLD, - I DON'T WANT ANYONE SITTING ON IT. - ARE YOU FOR REAL?
what KIND OF PARTY IS THIS GONNA BE IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO SIT?
first OF ALL, I GOT STURDY FOLDING CHAIRS IN MY STORAGE CLOSET.
second, I PUT WAY MORE INTO THIS PLACE THAN I COULD POSSIBLY AFFORD.
and I DON'T WANT MY SHIT GETTING DESTROYED, CAPISCE?
let's GO.
Oh, QUIT WHINGING, YOU PUSSY.
you're BOXING MY CUTLERY AFTER THIS.
you REALLY THINK THAT WAS THE ONLY PRINT?
my SPANISH ISN'T GREAT, BUT I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE EDITOR WAS SAYING.
so WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS IF WE DON'T FIND HIM?
we GET A NEW EDITOR, START OVER. - THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS.
that's WHY WE GOT TO FIND HIM. THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.
Hello, KAT. - HEY, VINCE.
E. - HOW ARE YOU?
Billy's MA IS STAYING WITH US, SO AS GOOD AS I CAN BE.
woman: CLOSE THE DOOR, THERE'S A CHILL COMING THROUGH.
it's 80? OUT.
she's ALWAYS COMPLAINING.
what DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT ME, YOU LITTLE SLUT?
Hey, THIS IS MY HOUSE. DON'T FUCKING TALK TO ME THAT WAY, BITCH!
fuck YOU! - FUCK YOU!
my GOD.
man, I'M SORRY. THE WOMAN IS CRAZY, YOU KNOW?
so, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU GUYS? EVERYTHING OKAY?
Yeah, WE'RE LOOKING FOR BILLY.
wasn't HE GONNA MEET YOU GUYS FOR THE SCREENING?
well, YEAH, HE WAS. BUT HE LEFT - AND HE TOOK THE MOVIE WITH HIM. - OH.
well, I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
though HE WAS A LITTLE DOWN WHEN HE LEFT HERE THIS MORNING.
he WAS? WE SPOKE TO HIM LAST NIGHT, HE SOUNDED GREAT.
Yeah, HE SCREENED THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT FOR ME AND HIS MOTHER
and I THINK IT SOURED HIM.
you SAW THE MOVIE? - OH YEAH, A BUNCH OF TIMES.
was IT GOOD?
Oh, I CAN'T SAY.
you CAN'T SAY IF IT WAS GOOD? - E, I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.
Billy WOULD KILL ME IF I SAID ANYTHING,
and YOU KNOW, I'D NEVER BETRAY BILLY THAT WAY.
so WHY WAS HE SO DOWN THIS MORNING?
because OF WHAT SHE SAID, FUCKING COOZ.
she DIDN'T LIKE IT.
Oh, THAT'S HIM.
hey BABY, WHERE ARE YOU?
Yeah, VINCE AND E ARE, LIKE, FREAKING OUT.
no, I DIDN'T CALL THEM, BABY. BABY...
where ARE YOU? CALM DOWN.
baby?
he HUNG UP. HE'S DRUNK.
he SAID HE'S AT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE REALLY LOVE HIM.
any IDEA WHERE THAT MIGHT BE?
Yeah, THE BODY SHOP, PROBABLY.
Thanks, KAT. - SEE YOU, KAT.
we'll SEE YOU LATER.
Hey, FRIDA. - YEAH, HE'S IN WITH SOMEONE.
Oh, IT'S FINE. I'LL TELL HIM IT'S FINE.
Jeffrey!
Ari. - HEY, YOUR OFFICE SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME.
I JUST SAW YOU FOR A CLEANING LAST WEEK.

hard TIME, HUH? - YEAH.
he HIT A KID WITH A RULER AT HIS EVALUATION.

I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THIS, ARI.
talk ABO WHAT? YOU ALREADY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?
Ari, I'M WITH A PATIENT. - JEFF JEFF JEFF JEFF...
I'm THE GUY THAT GOT LINDSAY LOHAN TO SCREEN "MEAN GIRLS" AT THE SCHOOL
when YOU BEGGED.
I'm THE GUY THAT GOT LIL' BOW WOW AT YOUR DAUGHTER'S BAT MITZVAH.
Ari. - I'M THE GUY THAT KNOWS
you GOT A LITTLE SKANK YOU KEEP ON THE WILSHIRE CORRIDOR.
this STAYS HERE.
what ARE YOU NOT TELLING ME?
look, I GOT TWO MORE KIDS THAT I GOT TO GET INTO SCHOOL.
being ON THE BOARD ALONE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT.
you NEED TO TALK TO THE HEADMASTER ABOUT THIS.
about WHAT?
goodbye.
the RULER INCIDENT IS NOT YOUR SON'S ONLY PROBLEM.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - TALK TO ANDREW PRESTON.
please, I CANNOT SAY ANYTHING MORE-- I AM SORRY...
but... - I AM SORRY.

what's THE PROBLEM?
you LOOK LIKE YOU GOT IT ALL UNDER CONTROL.
I GOTTA GET REST IF WE'RE GONNA GO ALL NIGHT.

let's HOPE SO. - WHATEVER.
just GET OVER HERE AND GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS.
you're TAKING DOWN THE LIGHT FIXTURE?
it's A CHANDELIER, AND YES, I DON'T WANT ANYONE SWINGING FROM IT.
you GOT IT AT IKEA. - WHATEVER, JUST GRAB IT.
hold ON, I GOT TO TAKE A PISS.

it's THE COMBO.
are YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
deadly SERIOUS, TURTLE.
you ARE RUINING THIS PARTY, DRAMA.
by STOPPING 200 PEOPLE FROM SHITTING ON MY TOILET?
I DON'T THINK I'M RUINING ANYTHING. - WHO SHITS AT A PARTY?
well, EVEN JUST PISS.
what DO DRUNK PEOPLE DO? THEY PISS AND THEY MISS.
that's IMPORTED ITALIAN LIMESTONE IN THERE.
it's POROUS AND IT'S NOT GETTING PISSED ON.
so WHERE IS EVERYONE SUPPOSED TO GO, HUH? OFF THE BALCONY?
don't BE RETARDED. I GOT PORTA POTTIES COMING.

I DO TOO. IN FACT, THEY SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.
so WHY DON'T YOU HOLD IT? - FUCK THAT!
I'm NOT HOLDING SHIT.

I WILL PISS ALL OVER YOUR PLASMA, DRAMA.
I SWEAR TO GOD.
and WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY.
we GOT TO WRAP UP MY FRETTE LINENS.
let's JUST DO THIS THING AT VINCE'S HOTEL.
turtle, IT'S MY BABY BRO'S PARTY
and I'M HOSTING IT.
do YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD NOT LET IT BE OFF THE HOOK?
now STOP IT. IT'S GONNA BE PERFECT.
30 MORE MINUTES, THIS PLACE WILL BE INDESTRUCTIBLE.
why ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HIS MOTHER SAYS?
cause SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO'S SEEN IT.
she HATED "QUEENS BOULEVARD.
that's TRUE. - SO RELAX.
Marvin. - DEEP BREATH.
Hello?

temporary? Yeah, I'll say it'semporary.
till THEY THROW YOU OUT ON YOUR ASS!
you GUYS HAVE NO MONEY!
why do you think I told you to get back from Italy?
I KNOW. - Hey, listen.
this IS NOT CONSERVATIVE MARVIN TALKING.
this IS YOU-ARE-REALLY- AND-TRULY-BROKE MARVIN TALKING.
living on Vince's Black Card is insane. - I KNOW.
so DOES ARI HAVE A JOB?
we GOT TO WAIT TILL WE SEE THE MOVIE.
did you see it? - WE'RE SEEING IT TODAY.
there HE IS. - When?
right NOW. - CALL ME WHEN IT'S OVER-- HELLO?
Vince: BILLY.
Hey, VINCE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BACK IN TOWN.
Hey. - NO CALL?
sorry, MIA. - Eric: BILLY!
I MEAN, THIS IS JUST SILLY.
well, DO YOU THINK IT'S HIS READING?
I KNOW IT IS. WE DON'T DENOUGH OF IT.
well I TRY. - A LITTLE LESS "GREY'S ANATOMY,
a LITTLE MORE "GOOD GHT MOON," PERHAPS.
you're BLAMING ME? - No, I'm blaming me
who COMES HOME WITH 40 SCRIPTS A NIGHT AFTER WORKING A FULL DAY.
Hey, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL READ ONE OF THOSE TO HIM.
tonight I GOT "SAW IV." HE'LL LOVE IT.
Ari! - BABY, DON'T WORRY.
I WILL SAVE THE DAY AS USUAL.
excuse ME, SIR. CELL PHONES ARE NOT PERMITTED ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.
let ME CALL YOU BACK. ANDREW PRESTON?
Ari GOLD. - JUST THE MAN I WAS LOOKING FOR.
sorry ABOUT THE PHONE-- BUSINESS CALL.
it IS A WEDNESDAY AFTER ALL.
well, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, MR. GOLD?
well, UH, I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
it's JUST THAT I HAD A MEETING WITH YOUR EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT TODAY.
Uh-huh? - AND...
look, I UNDERSTAND THAT THE EVALUATION FOR MY SON
didn't GO AS WELL AS EXPECTED,
but I NEED TO ASSURE YOU THAT MY WIFE AND I
are COMMITTED TO DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES - TO BRING OUR SON UP TO SPEED. - MM-HM.
I MEAN, PERHAPS HE IS A LITTLE BEHIND ON HIS READING
but I MEAN, HEY, HE'S NOT EVEN SIX YET.
okay? YOU CAN'T REALLY JUDGE HIM ON HIS READING.
I MEAN, AT SIX I WAS DYSLEXIC.
all RIGHT, YOU WOULD HAVE THROWN ME OUT IN THE COLD.
look AT ME NOW. I'M LIKE THE POSTER BOY FOR THIS PLACE.
it's NOT HIS READING. - WHAT IS IT THEN?
his RHYMING, HIS FINE MOTOR SKILLS?
it's NONE OF THAT. - WHAT IS IT?
I CAN'T DISCUSS IT UNTIL THE PROCESS IS COMPLETE.
you UNDERSTAND. - ACTUALLY I DON'T.
uh, MR. GOLD...
Mr. PRESTON, I HAVE SPENT OVER $200, 000
in TUITION OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS,
another 50 OR SO IN DONATIONS.
my WIFE HAS SERVED ON 50 DIFFERENT COMMITTEES.
all RIGHT, THAT'S TWO LESS DAYS A WEEK SHE GETS TO BARRY'S BOOT CAMP.
she SACRIFICES HER BODY; OBVIOUSLY A SACRIFICE THAT I MAKE AS WELL,
all FOR THE GOOD OF THIS SCHOOL.
now, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT TYPE OF NEW DONATION I HAVE TO MAKE
to ENSURE THAT I NEVER HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
any TYPE OF LIMITATIONS YOU THINK MY SON HAS.
look, MR. GOLD, THE THING IS...
$20, 000. - MR. GOLD.
$30, 000! - MR. GOLD...
it IS NOT YOUR SON.
it IS HIS FATHER:
a CELL PHONE ON YOUR EAR EVERY TIME I SEE YOU WALK THROUGH THESE HALLS;
a FOUL MOUTH ON THE SOCCER FIELD EVERY TIME I SEE YOU ROOT FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.
this SCHOOL HAS SIMPLY DECIDED THAT YOUR DAUGHTER HAS ONLY FOUR YEARS LEFT.
but IF WE ADMIT YOUR SON, THAT MEANS MORE THAN A DECADE LEFT WITH YOU.
good DAY.
- DADDY.
get YOUR STUFF, SWEETHEART. - EVERYTHING OKAY, MR. GOLD?
what's GOING ON, DADDY?
nothing, SWEETHEART, YOU JUST NO LONGER GO TO SCHOOL HERE.
what?
Hey, DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE A COASTER, PAL.
hey ASSHOLE! THERE'S NOTHING IN THE SUB-ZERO.
there's NO NEED TO EVEN OPEN IT.
fucking ANIMALS.
so IS IT LIKE THE MOVIES? YOU KNOW, WHERE THE GIRLS
Oh YEAH. THEY DIDN'T LET US SLEEP FOR 24 HOURS ON INITIATION NIGHT.

great. 'CAUSE I LOVE THAT CAR.
we ARE ALL GOOD.
we KNOW THE MOVIE'S GREAT. WE WERE THERE.
Yeah, WE WERE. - HEY, HOW WAS YOUR DAY? MINE SUCKED
and NO ONE CALLED ME ALL DAY. DID YOU SEE THE MOVIE?
I'm GONNA CALL WALSH AGAIN. - WHAT?
is THERE A PROBLEM? - Drama: HEY, SHOES OFF, ARI!
Hey, FUCK YOU, DRAMA!
hey BILLY. IT'S E.
look, I'm calling for Vince.
I know you hate me, Billy.
Vince PUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER ON THE LINE FOR THIS MOVIE AND FOR YOU...
and ALL OF HIS MONEY. HE'S GOT NONE.
and HE CAN'T GET A JOB UNTIL PEOPLE SEE THIS.
so I'm not asking anything for me, Billy, but for Vince.
what does Vince have to do to see this movie?
he HAS TO BE GENTLE, SUIT.
just CALM DOWN. - DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, TURTLE.
someone's IN MY BATHROOM AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY GOT IN THERE.
don't LOOK AT ME. - DON'T LOOK AT YOU?
that's A NICKEL-PLATED MASTER LOCK
with HARDENED STEEL SHACKLES.
it's IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN THERE WITHOUT A COMBO!
maybe DAVID COPPERFIELD IS IN THERE.
Oh, THAT'S FUNNY.
she PROMISED TO SHOW ME HER TITS.
fucking SELLOUT.
what's THE PROBLEM, JOHNNY?
no PROBLEM, BRO. HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE.
you HAVING A GOOD TIME? - GREAT TIME, GREAT TIME.
listen, WE'RE GONNA TAKE OFF, ALL RIGHT? - YOU LEAVING?
Yeah, WALSH PROMISED TO SHOW US THE MOVIE RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T WANT HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND-- YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?
Yeah, I UNDERSTAND, BRO.

I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE!

- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

after-party AT VINNIE CHASE'S HOTEL ROOM!
Billy. - NO WORDS NECESSARY.
roll IT, RAUL. ENJOY.
I'll BE THROWING UP IN THE ALLEY.
Hey.
I MEAN, A PERSON IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR WORD.
I MEAN, WITHOUT THAT WE'D JUST BE ANIMALS.
fine.
you HAPPY?
sadly, I'M VERY HAPPY.
anybody SEEN DRAMA?
excuse ME, EXCUSE ME. GET OUT OF THE WAY.
drama: ...MAJOR MOTION PICTURE. IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING...
Johnny DRAMA, JOHNNY DRAMA.
someone DID SOMETHING REALLY HORRIBLE IN THE BATHROOM.
Yeah, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT, BRO?
Hey, LLOYD, NICE SWEATER, BABY.
what's UP, DRAMA? - HOW ARE YOU, AL?
good, MAN. HONEY, HOLD THIS.
hysterical.
please SAY SOMETHING.
Ah... I'M BLOWN AWAY, BILLY.
Oh YOU! AH!
suit?
great JOB, BILLY. GOD, YOU LITTLE--!
Aw, YOU LITTLE...
so WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE, RIGHT?
you WERE JUST BEING NICE TO BILLY. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE MOVIE, DID YOU?
I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING. YOU DIDN'T?
I THOUGHT IT SUCKED.
Really? - REALLY.
Hey, WHAT'S UP, TURTLE?
great, NO, THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME.
what HAPPENED?
they HAD AN AFTER-PARTY AT THE HOTEL.
Anthony MICHAEL HALL PISSED OFF THE BALCONY AND WE GOT THROWN OUT.
nice. - SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
we'll CRASH AT JOHNNY'S TONIGHT.
so YOU REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT?
I REALLY DIDN'T.
I'm asking if you think I should work with this girl.
I'm asking if you can work with her without trying to bang her.
she has a boyfriend! - I don't think you could work with her - without trying to bang her. - I never seem to be able to.
but the girl you work with wanna bang you, doesn't she?
wait still that she does he. - She has a boyfriend!
so? It's not a husband!
and if you think she'd wanna bang you if she didn't have a boyfriend, you'd lie and wait. Eventually, that would end, - you'd be in like Flynn. - Totally!
is that why you guys never get laid, always waiting for a relationship stand?
E., last night, you thought you were on a date with the girl.
I'm not sure you can let that go and be professional.
well, I am sure. - Then when are you asking?
I'm just making sure you're OK with it.
are you OK with it?
not all clients are as easy as me. And actresses...?
forget it! - Oh, yeah!
the girl's in town, alright? It's a great way to expend our business.
our business? - Yeah.
I've been thinking. You and I 50/50 on every client I hit.
when do I fit in? - You don't.
you know, that's sweet, but not necessary.
look, I know where I'd be without you!
nowhere!
don't you have a job to go to, Drama?
that's the beauty of an ensemble cast!
it's who they work with.
E., it is not necessary.
great! There're other people who're recognizing what you do for me, and I wish you nothing but success.
I only ask that you make sure that my career attention does not suffer.
Yeah, E. Look after Numero uno.
always, always, always!
I have Dana Gordon.
weird ! I used to push up on top of Dana Gordon like this!
true story.
Dana! I was just thinking about you!
did you read Billy Walsh's script?
did I get Billy Walsh's script?
I got it this morning.
do I have Billy Walsh's script? - No, I've just brought it out.
call Walsh and find out why I didn't have a chance to comment on it before he turned it in.
just got it! How's it feeling?
I'm on page 12 and I do not understand what I'm reading.
you didn't understand Titanic after 12 pages either, Dana.
Ari? This is totally fucked, OK?
and this is not what we bought. - What do you mean?
read the thing, Ari!
I left a word for Walsh.
keep trying him! Call E. and make sure that Vince is reading this as well!
I can't hear you, Lloyd! I'm in the Hills!
did you get the Billy Walsh's script?
Lloyd, I can't hear you!
did you get...
the Billy Walsh's...
script! - Shut the fuck up, Lloyd!
no cell reception up here.
Yeah, I got that. Do you have a hardline here by chance?
I don't know. - Thanks, man.
here's my guy! - Hey!
Hey! - How are you?
so, Vince is OK with this? - Yeah, he was totally cool.
smart move! I would have fought him for you, - I'm a freaky sister on you. - I'm glad it didn't come to that.
me too. I'm sorry for putting you to work day one.
it's just I've got to summon up my inner supermodel.
I got these people coming at me with concepts, interviews, wardrobe...
I'm so thankful you're here to help!
I'm glad to do it. Fashion isn't my thing, but if you really want my opinion, I liked the black outfit you wore on your 1st scary movie. Made you look smart, some kind of hot.
you remember that? - Yeah, it was on...
it's a cable like... a year ago.
and I... I might have bought the DVD.
watch it just turn it. My job, you know.
right.
we are gonna be great together, E. Really great.
I'm so excited! - Me too!
What'up, girl?
Hey, Dave! - Hey, baby!
this the guy I was telling you about, E.
this is my boyfriend, Dave. - Hey, Dave. How are you?
you're the new manager, Dog? - Yeah!
I... thought you'd be a little older.
I'm older than I look.
alright.
so! - So...
so, why don't you ask the new manager what he thinks of my idea?
Dave, I...
what? Yo, check this, OK?
I want them to shoot Anna in a series of animal poses, OK?
like when she sticks her neck up like this, alright? It's like a girafe.
alright? In another one, we would make her hair really big, to be like a lion.
what do you think? - That's interesting...
what do you really think?
I think it's a little weird. No offense, Dave, but... it is.
it is a little weird, Dave.
well, I thought it'd be hot.
you think everything I do is hot, and that's why I love you.
but this is a little weird, so let's let it go, please.
I'm gonna go get ready.
yo, Dog.
I'm gonna watch my girl get ready, OK?
so, why don't you grab me a coke, and bring it over to the trailer?
alright? Yeah. They're right there.
Thanks, Dog.
I'll bring that right over.
yeah? - Hello?
Hey, Ari what's up? - What's up, Lloyd?
I'm looking for Vince. - Do you know where's Vince?
aren't you supposed to go through E for Vince?
you try E.? - If he's here, put him on the phone!
I called E. and e-mailed him too.
I'll see if he's here. - I'll see if I can locate him.
Vince, you hear of Ari? - Why wouldn't I be?
Lloyd says he can't find E.
it's fine.
Hey, Lloyd! - Hey, Vince. Hold for Ari.
okay. - I got Ari, Vince.
alright. - Ari!
I got Vince! - I got fucking Vince!
Vince! - Ari!
did you read Walsh's script? - Did I get Walsh's script?
well, it was dropped off to me in the studio this morning.
any scripts come for us this morning?
Yeah, I put them on the pile.
Yeah, I got it. What's the problem?
the problem is he took your snow on a mountain movie and turned it into a futuristic thriller, set on a farm, circa 2075!
I don't understand. - He tossed the book away!
the book they paid him $3m to write, and decided just to make up his own story.
that's odd. Call Walsh.
Dana Gordon on one.
did E. know anythin about this?
of course, not. - Then why is he in hiding?
he's not. He's at a photo shoot with his new client.
E.'s got a new client?
Yeah, Anna Farris.
come on!
Jesus! The world is falling apart!
it's always darkest before dawn, Ari.
I got Billy's voice mail.
Billy Walsh just said in response to your question why did he give the script to the studio before you had a chance to comment on it, and I'm quoting him:
because I don't give a fuck what you think.
get his address.
sit tight, I will get right back to you.
Bye, Ari.
boy, he's stressed! - You want me to call E.?
no, I'm the producer, I can handle it.
let's just see what crazy Billy did.
how about I read this copy? - Yeah, I like the initiative, Turtle.
what should I do?
why don't you make us a snack?
I like being E.
hot, so hot! Perfect!
run into it!
you can get a signal right at the bottom of the hill.
or we have a runner. We could send him make the call.
no, thanks. I'll go down to call.
Thanks, I appreciate. - No problem!
she looks good, huh? - No, I'm not feeling a shit at all.
baby?
do it like a cat, OK?
ears cats.
just jump out.
baby, trust me on this OK? Please?
hey guys, like an hour, and this shit is gonna pop.
come on, Dave...
OK, am I wrong, dog?
little reckless abandon in here It'll stand this thing unique.
I think she looks beautiful.
fucking hack!
are you cool if I ran down the bottom of the hill to make a call?
Yeah. - OK, I'll be right back.
alright, everyone. Let's take five.
alright, sir. It's Eric, right?
Yeah! - You can't leave now.
why not? - I didn't get what I need out of Anna.
she's not focused.
alright. I'll talk to her.
no, she's not the problem. The boyfriend is.
as long as he's hanging around critisizing her, she's not gonna bring it.
you wanna say something to him? - I take pictures.
I don't interfere with domesticity.
alright. I'll say something to him.
don't touch the camera.
can I talk to you for a second?
listen...
I think you're making Anna a little uncomfortable.
you've been working with her... what? One day?
how do you know?
maybe you're making the photographer uncomfortable.
if you hang around, try to be a little less critical.
no, this is not good, OK?
I'm not feeling this.
Anna, baby?
I need to talk to you for a second.
in the trailer.
excuse me.
Hi. - Hi.
is Billy Walsh here?
no, Billy's not here.
I see him sitting on the couch there.
she means I'm not here for you Ari.
can I please come in.
not if you gonna critizise me.
Critizise... Why would I critizise you?
let him in.
so everyone hates this script.
you got paid a half a million dollars to adapt the book and you didn't do it.
decided to go on a different direction.
they didn't pay you for that direction.
the script that he wrote is really hot, man.
you don't want to give the studio back their money, do you?
the money's been spent. - On what?
home improvements. - We put in a steam shower
how long will it take you to do what they paid you to do?
infinity, cause I'm not gonna do it.
you have to do it.
I tried to do it Ari,
I did, but everytime I started to write a scene,
I got these 2 guys locked alone on a moutain and it felt really gay.
and it was my idea to add the chicks. See, Billy raises chicks really good
thanks baby.
Vince stops his neckout for you and now you are fucking him.
and the studio.
they are going to fuck you right back. - They can't touch me.
they can sue you and make sure that you never make a movie in this town again.
well good thing I paint.
you are not gonna do this, are you?
no, I'm not.
then I got nothing else to say to you.
yeah well, I got something to say to you:
you are no longer my agent!
it's your wife, she says it's urgent. - Put her through Lloyd.
here she is. - What's wrong baby?
you're avoiding my fucking calls.
does thats sound like my wife, Lloyd?
indeed yes, but now it doesn't, sorry.
what's up Danna?
I haven't walked out of my office, not even to pee, in 3 hours.
what are you, agorophobic?
no, I'm scared to see my boss, because I have no idea what to tell him.
well that is the beauty of me, Danna, I tell people what to tell other people.
so tell me something.
fire Walsh.
fire him? - Yes, I just did.
so he has no intention of writing what he was supposed to write?
none, but I have intentions of finding you an alias writer director to replace him by sundown and I will bring him at any cost.
get a list together. - I can't believe this.
wake up Danna, it's real.
the first big project you brought in your new studio is in shambles!
thanks to your writer/director asshole.
you know, if you think my last boss was vindictive, you haven't seen shit, you better find me someone approvable, and you better make sure that Vince is on board because if I have to go in and tell Richard Wimmer, that we lost a script, a director, and a story today, all of who are your fucking clients, you can bet your ass that nobody who has ever been close enough to smell your breath, will ever be welcome at the studio again.
it's Ari - I'll call him when I'm finished.
some help this guy is.
I'm not sleeping jerkoff, I'm pacing myself.
Yeah, were you enjoying it Turtle?
Yeah, don't get mad, Vin, but, but I kind of scanned it for the sex scenes,
there are two good ones, by the way.
there are a lot of parts in here Vince.
Billy liked the way you did in Medellin.
right? - No.
I really do need E. Call him, Turtle.
I can finish man.
call him.
call him, Turtle.
straight to voicemail.
nice, very nice.
excuse me miss, can you make a call for me?
sure. Who's the call to?
the call is to Ari Gold, at the Miller Gold Agency.
and you gonna ask for Lloyd, and see if there is anything important going on.
you got it. - Thank you very much.
hey guy. You are her manager?
well, can you manage her?
we're ready, she's not coming out of her trailer.
she's just talking to her boyfriend.
look, once the sun is over that tree, we're done, We can't shoot.
okay, I take care of it.
you wanna talk?
sorry to bother you, Dave... interrupt.
but they're ready for all on set. - We're in the middle of something.
I really have to go. We'll talk about this later.
what's more important: this relationship or this photo shoot.
don't do that, I have to work.
Oh, and I'm sorry, I don't.
Oh my God. - Fuck this.
I'm out
I'm really sorry.
he never used to be like this, but since CW passed on his pilot,.
he's been hanging around my work beeing all hypercritical.
God, you must think I'm a mess.
look, relationships are tough, I'm sure you guys will get trought it.
does the crew totaly hate me?
not at all, everyting's fine. You're good, you need a minute?
no, no, I'm good.
okay, here, come on. - Okay, thank you.
how's that dress feel?
it's really uncomfortable. - I agree, right?
you needed me to go make a phone call for you.
just confirming, who I was suppose to call?
you wanna talk to Lloyd in Ari Gold's office.
if you need to go make some phone calls, that's fine.
you're sure? - Totally.
alright, I'll be back in 5 minutes.
Hey, E.? - Yeah?
I swear I'm not as a high maintenance as it seems.
don't worry, as far as my easiest client are concerned, you're in the top 2.
not bad!
I'll be back in 2 seconds!
I'm sorry.
so sorry, guys.
making house calls, I love it.
today is not the day to not pick up your phone.
I was reading, you should be proud! Normally you can't get me to do that.
well today, I actually don't need you to do that.
I made some lamb kebabs, you want some?
no, thank you. - They're good.
no, thank you. You know Richard Kelly?
the director? - Yeah, the guy did Donnie Darko.
I know him, I like him, why?
I represent him, I can get him on Clouds.
plus I get the studio on board so we can keep this train rolling.
what about Billy?
Billy is a dead man. He's a corpse.
you can't pull that kind of shit when you get paid that kind of money!
did you read his script?
I understand that you're loyal to the guy.
but did you read it?
I read the first ten pages but there's no moutain.
without a moutain, there's no movie!
no, there is a movie, a great movie, better than Clouds, I think.
are you fucking with me? - Why would I do that, Ari?
is he fucking with me?
clouds was lacking in tits. This one's got at least 4.
yeah there is a couple of things in there for me too.
so you and Lloyd should get on it ASAP.
where the hell is E.?
well, we need him because maybe that neurotic little elf nipping at your heels will make you understand that we are in a major crisis situation here.
I think if you read the script, you'd find that we're not. Come on.
and Ari, the tide is turning for us, you know that.
and the hype of Medelin is growing as Cannes approches,
I like this script, I wanna make this movie, with Billy.
we can't do that! There is no way!
there is always a way Ari. Come on, make it happen, huh?
you're following me Dog?
no, just trying to make a phone call.
why are you right on my ass?
I'm not, I didn't even know it was you.
Oh, you didn't? Okay.
you got a think from my girl?
we work together, what are you talking about?
you got a girlfriend? - No.
you're gay? - No.
look at me at my face right now and tell me you ain't got a think for my girl.
you gotta chill.
don't tell me to chill, okay?
my girlfriend, she comes and tells me she's getting a new manager
I'm thinking it's gonna be some great beard
Bernie Bernstein type and not some young none gay guy who ain't got no girl!
I promise you this relationship is gonna be nothing but professional.
professional? How are you gonna help her professionally?
why don't you sell me however you sold her?
I didn't sell her. I told her I didn't like the movie she was gonna do and she agreed with my opinion, that's it.
so you're the reason she didn't do it.
that's fine. You know that's really fine, because I was the reason she was gonna do it!
what can I say about that? I'm just trying to do that job,
your job's fucking with my life, okay?
and... you never got me that coke!
this is not happening.
are you out of your fucking mind?
did you even read Walsh's script?
I read 15 pages and I will not read another page nor another page of any client you ever have.
I need to get you behind this.
I'm not behind this and I never will be.
listen, you better get behind this if you want to save your ass.
save my ass? People love Clouds.
I will replace you and your whole fucking crew, with 3 phone calls.
and after this if I hear that you tried to bait and switch the studio, it will be your ass that needs the saving.
so you're not gonna take this to your boss?
No! - Then I will.
Really? - Hi, Ari Gold to see Richard Wimmer.
really!
you motherfucking cocksucker.
he's leaving for New York in 30 minutes.
I will be a minute.
no, he's in the shower!
I'm not a fighter Dog. But when it comes to my girl, I will man up.
so back off, ok?
you're no fighting me man, you fighting yourself here.
don't use that weird existential shit with me.
would you just talk to me for one second before you go back over to her?
one. - Listen.
one. One. That was like 3 seconds.
only 6.
you want to lose your girl?
you go back over there with that attitude, that's exactly what will happen.
you'd like that wouldn't you?
what the fuck Dave? You've come to cause more problems?
girl, I haven't caused shit! It's this guy.
the only reason he's here... is he's trying to fuck you.
what? - I'm just trying to do my job!
you need to get rid of him.
baby, I'm just keeping it real.
ask him, right now, to look you in the face and say it isn't so.
do it, go on! - Dave, stop it!
maybe I should leave.
Yeah, why don't you do that, please?
no, dog, why don't you?
I can't take anymore! I'm done!
that shit ain't right. - Stop talking like Randy Jackson!
whatever, movie star, I...
I hope you two are really happy together, alright?
well...
that was awkard.
you alright?
no, I meant for you...
okay, come on. Let's go back to work.
Finally!
yo, Billy! Where have you been all day?
it's not Billy, Vince. It's Cat.
Billy's locked himself in the bathroom with a bottle of whisky and a gun.
what are you talking about? - He thinks he let you down.
he feels terrible. - No, he didn't let me down!
Vince! E.?
let me talk to him.
Billy? Baby, it's Vince! He wants to talk to you.
what's to say? I've ruined us all!
No! Baby, he says that it's all good!
what's all good? He liked the script?
tell him I love the script!
he loved the script, baby. He loved it!
you loved it? - It's unbelievable!
you really have a gun?
Yeah, but the bitch had the bullets all out.
Jesus, Billy!
the script is amazing. I wanna make this movie.
you do? - Yes.
we're going to make this movie. - How?
Ari's taking care of it, don't worry.
Ari? What can he do?
wow, it's like finding Jim Morrison alive.
Yeah, I had no cell all day. I got like 25 messages!
what's going on? - Nothing that exciting.
just an emergency meeting with the head of the studio on the Billy Walsh/Vinny Chase project.
what's the problem? - Would you like to know?
Ari! - You snooze, you lose. I gotta go!
what the hell is going on? - Desperate times call for desperate measures here.
thank God I'm in a robe.
and, may I comment on what lovely ankles you have!
talk fast, Ari. - You don't have your summer movie?
come again? - At ten poll, you don't have one!
I have Clouds!
Billy Walsh and Vinny Chase don't wanna do it.
where the hell is Dana Gordon?
I'm right outside the door, Richard! Ari locked me out!
let her in!
Hey, Dana! - Fuck you, Ari!
what's the hell's going on with Clouds?
I'm working on it. When you return from New York,
I'll have a completely new team in place.
impossible! Billy burned 6 weeks writing the wrong script.
and you don't have enough time to put Clouds back on board for your July release.
you and your friend Billy Walsh are dear!
no, we are not dead. We are very much alive.
you, with your fading star prizes and your 3 straight quarters in the red are dead if you're to go to your board of directors, and tell them that this summer may be a worse quarter yet.
I'm gonna tear your head off!
please don't, because I have your summer movie.
from the director of Medellin and Queens Boulevard, comes Silo.
it is the story of a group of non unionized farmhands who band together to survive a nuclear attack after discovering an underground society.
it's ready to shoot.
Billy Walsh's on board, Vinny Chase is on board, and if you're not, Fox, Universal and Sony are.
he's bluffing.
what's it matter? There's a summer movie in there, we pack up our shit and go home!
tell him how good it is, Dana. All personal bullshit aside.
it's an excellent script. - Can we market it!
think... Blade Runner meets Field of Dreams.
two classics! Boom!
you make this good, Dana.
and you, Ari, this I don't soon forget.
that was unbelievable. Blade Runner meets Field of Dreams?
not bad, huh? - You actually read it?
what do we need to read it for? I'll go to the movies!
we have a gold movie!
die, Ari! I truly hope you die!
did I do it, Vinny?
Yes, you did, and thank you.
so... Any possibility of shooting this a little closer to civilization, Bill, please?
it takes place on a farm in Nova Scotia, Turtle.
ignore him, Billy. He read every third page.
I, on the other hand, was riveted!
especially by the character of Kelton, the farmhand.
Yeah, I was thinking of you when I wrote that.
Really? - No.
how about a toast?
to a groundbreaking day and a possibly groundbreaking movie!
are you kissing my ass, now, snake suit?
come on, Billy! He came through. You can't stay mad at him!
well, I'm no longer planning on using your car as a toilet, but I'll get back to you by being my agent.
I wait with bated breath, Sir!
why does nobody answer their cells?
look who's talking!
where have you been, E.?
too busy being professional with your girlfriend - to pick up the phone? - Please, tell me what's going on.
don't stress your pretty little head about it!
it's all been handled. - What's been handled?
we're making Billy's movie.
silo?
where is the snow?
how do I know that girl Vince is talkin' to?
that's Sasha Grey. - The porn star?!
former colleague Lizzie Grant is trying to take clients. Who's she working for?
Vince isn't gonna be the face of some Tequila company. He's not aunt Jemima.
I read a script this morning. I want to do it. - Okay.
stamos sent it to me. - Jesus.
this is awkward. I happened to see your search history on the computer.
can we talk about this tonight?
I might be hiding from you tonight.
I want Saget. I wish I could've done more.
what's up, Vince? - This Tequila's special. I want to involved.
this is Sasha. - This is the man, the myth, the legend... Stan Lee.
Oh, you look familiar. - How'd the meeting go?
not great. Vince brought Sasha and apparently he was drunk.
good evening, Ari. - Please don't tell me you're the one who picked up the stray Lizzie.
anyone she wants, I'm going after.
well, she's going after you too, Ari.
I'm going to make your life miserable like you once made mine.
good night, Ari.
tell us, Vince, what are we doing here?
we're having our own private launch party for our new Tequila company.
name, Vin. Give 'em the name.
uh, Tequila Avion.
Huh-uh, Avion. - Avion!
and who is this?
this is my friend Sasha.
aren't we more than friends by now?
Oh no no, we are. We're very good friends.
and this is my friend. - Alex.
notice how she didn't say we're more than friends?
you don't make a move soon, Turtle, I'm gonna have to.
what, am I not here? - I'm just saying.
he's made moves. We're just taking it slow.
real slow. Like the 405 at rush hour. Ow.
well, Alex, all I know is I've had a lot of sex in my life and the best sex I've ever had was while drinking this.
can we quote international star of stage and screen Sasha Grey on that?
I'm not shy. Drink this and you'll have the best sex of your life.
guys can fuck like me and girls can fuck like a porn star.
come on, Vince.
that was awesome.
Oh my God.
so what is the deal? Are you two gonna bang or what?
Jesus, Drama. I thought you were dead.
no, I'm just unemployed, sad and lonely.
don't worry, I'm saving a piece of my piece of this company for you.
that makes me feel much better.
say something on camera about it. You're a pseudo-celeb.
I don't drink Tequila. I drink Johnny blue 'cause I'm not a pseudo-man like you.
all right, you're out. - I am out.
doesn't drink Tequila. Huh, what a loser.
what?
I was gonna kiss you.
you've already kissed me. - Fine, then I won't.
