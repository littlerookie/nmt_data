this is no accident! You can't do this. Period!
nothing happened.
do you have any idea what it's like to wake up with my mother here...
and find out that you never came home?
so all this is about Grandma being here?
no, it's about the feeling of complete terror...
when you're not in bed in the morning. - Sorry.
it's a different kind of terror when I find out...
that you spent the night with some guy! - I didn't spend the night. We fell asleep.
you are going on the pill. You are not getting pregnant!
I'm not sleeping with Dean!
what happened to all that stuff you said to Grandma?
what happened to trusting me?
where did all that go? - It's back on Patty's yoga mats.
this is crap!
you know I didn't do anything. You know this was an accident.
you're just mad because I screwed up...
I killed Sirius Black!
he's back.
the police are continuing with the investigation...into the cause of the Millennium Bridge disaster.
traffic has been halted as police search for survivors.
the surrounding area remains closed.
the mayor has urged Londoners to remain calm...
Harry Potter.
who's Harry Potter?
Oh, no one.
bit of a tosser, really.
funny, that paper of yours.
couple nights ago, I could've sworn I saw a picture move.
Really? - Thought I was going around the twist.
Hey, I was wondering... - Eleven. That's when I get off.
you can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.
you've been reckless this summer, Harry.
I like riding around on trains.
takes my mind off things.
rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?
the tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.
but now is not the time to tell it.
take my arm.
do as I say.
I just Apparated, didn't I?
indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add.
most people vomit the first time.
I can't imagine why.
welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're wondering why I brought you here.
am I right?
actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it.
wands out, Harry.
Horace?
Horace?
Merlin's beard!
no need to disfigure me, Albus.
well, I must say you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
it's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
dragon's blood.
Oh. - Oh, yes, introductions.
Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine...
...Horace Slughorn.
Horace...
...well, you know who this is.
Harry Potter.
what's with all the theatrics, Horace?
you weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else?
someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
all right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.
do you know what that's like?
you can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week.
muggles who own this are in the Canary Islands.
well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind.
that was fun.
do you mind if I use the loo? - No, of course.
don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus.
the answer's still no. Absolutely and unequivocally, no.
you're very like your father.
except for the eyes. You have your... - My mother's eyes. Yeah.
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright, your mother.
even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
one of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year.
please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no.
your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is.
right at the front.
all mine. Each and every one.
Ex-students, I mean.
you recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.
always takes my owl, should I wish to register an opinion.....on the news of the day.
Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies.
free tickets whenever I want them.
of course, I haven't been to a match in some time.
Ah, yes.
Regulus Black.
you no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.
I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.
it's a shame. Talented boy.
I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.
Horace?
do you mind if I take this?
I do love knitting patterns. - Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?
I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable.
I would have considered it a personal triumph...had you consented to return to Hogwarts. -Oh, well.
you're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.
well, bye-bye, Horace.
Bye.
all right. I'll do it.
but I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before.
and I expect a raise. These are mad times we live in. Mad!
they are indeed.
sir, exactly what was all that about?
you are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values.
professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry.
you would be his crowning jewel.
that's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return.
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry.
she was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.
it's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.
Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
but, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?
both are waiting for you.
Hedwig.
mum?
Ginny, what is it?
I was only wondering when Harry got here.
what? Harry? Harry who? - Harry Potter, of course.
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
his trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl. - No, dear, I seriously doubt that.
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?
me, nosy. Is he up there with you?
of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?
is that an owl? - You haven't seen him, have you?
he's wandering about the house.
Really? - Really.
Harry!
Harry!
what a lovely surprise.
why didn't you let us know you were coming?
I didn't know. Dumbledore. - Oh, that man.
but then, what would we do without him?
got a bit of toothpaste.
so when did you get here?
a few days ago.
though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming.
mum sort of lost it last week.
said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.
that it's too dangerous.
Oh, come on. - She's not alone.
even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening.
anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy...and it took a few days, but she came around.
but this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?
there's been a lot of talk recently that...
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.
rubbish! Well, he's only...
what is he?
hundred and fifty? Give or take a few years.
Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted!
the Dark Lord trusts him.
the Dark Lord's mistaken.
run along, Wormtail.
I know I ought not to be here.
the Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this.
if the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours.
as it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
you?
the Dark Lord told you?
your sister doubts me.
understandable. Over the years I've played my part well.
so well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
I don't doubt you, Severus.
you should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.
he's just a boy.
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.
but it might be possible for me to help Draco.
Severus. - Swear to it.
make the Unbreakable Vow.
it's just empty words.
he'll give it his best effort.
but when it matters most...he'll just slither back into his hole.
coward.
take out your wand.
will you...
...Severus Snape...
...watch over Draco Malfoy...
...as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?
I will.
and will you, to the best of your ability...protect him from harm?
I will.
and if Draco should fail...will you yourself carry out the deed...the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
I will.
step up! Step up! We've got Fainting Fancies!
nosebleed Nougats!
and just in time for school... - Puking Pastilles!
into the cauldron, handsome.
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. - A real money spinner, that.
handy if you need to make a quick getaway.
Hello, ladies.
love potions, eh? - Yeah, they really do work.
then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.
Meaning?
are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
it's none of your business.
how much for this?
five Galleons.
how much for me? - Five Galleons.
I'm your brother.
ten Galleons.
come on, let's go.
Hi, Ron.
how are Fred and George doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
I reckon he's right.
Oh, no.
everyone got their wands from Ollivander's.
Harry?
is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people...who don't want to be followed?
quibbler.
quibbler.
he's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know.
Quibbler? - Oh, please.
what's a Wrackspurt? - They're invisible creatures.
they float in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.
quibbler.
so, what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet?
and who were all those people?
don't you see? It was a ceremony, an initiation.
stop it, Harry. I know where you're going.
it's happened. He's one of them.
one of what?
Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
you're barking.
what would you know who want with Malfoy?
well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?
it's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.
look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense.
hermione saw it with her own eyes.
I told you, I don't know what I saw.
I need some air.
don't worry. When we get to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.
what was that? Blaise? - Don't know.
relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around.
come on, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon.
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school.
I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower...if I had to continue for another two years.
what's that supposed to mean?
let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.
amused, Blaise?
we'll see just who's laughing in the end.
you two go on. I wanna check something.
Where's Harry?
he's probably already on the platform. Come on.
didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?
Petrificus Totalus.
...she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.
that's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London.
finite.
Hello, Harry. - Luna!
how'd you know where I was? - Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.
that's all right. It was like being with a friend.
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.
that's nice.
about time. I've been looking all over for you two.
right. Names?
professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.
no exceptions, Potter.
who are those people?
Aurors. For security.
what's this cane here, then?
it's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.
and what exactly would you be wanting with a...?
could be construed as an offensive weapon.
it's all right, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
nice face, Potter.
would you like me to fix it for you?
personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way...
...but it's up to you.
well, have you ever fixed a nose before?
no, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really?
um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.
Episkey. - Ah!
how do I look? - Exceptionally ordinary.
brilliant.
don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.
will you stop eating?
your best friend is missing!
oi. Turn around, you lunatic.
he's covered in blood again.
why is it he's always covered in blood? - Looks like it's his own this time.
where have you been?
what happened to your face? - Later.
what've I missed?
sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times.
easy for it to say, huh? It's a hat, isn't it?
very best of evenings to you all.
Thanks.
first off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff...
...Horace Slughorn.
professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...has agreed to resume his old post as Potions Master.
meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts......will be taken by Professor Snape.
Snape?
now, as you know...
...each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight.
and you have the right to know why.
once there was a young man, who, like you...
...sat in this very hall...
...walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.
he seemed to all the world a student like any other.
his name?
Tom Riddle.
today, of course...
...he's known all over the world by another name.
which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight...
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.
every day, every hour...
...this very minute, perhaps...
...dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.
but in the end, their greatest weapon is you.
just something to think about.
now, off to bed. Pip-pip.
that was cheerful.
history of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies! That is the girls' lavatory.
Potter.
Oh, this can't be good.
enjoying ourselves, are we?
I had a free period this morning. - So I noticed.
I would think you would want to fill it with Potions.
or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
it was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" in my O. W.L.
so you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.
however, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N. E.W. T. S students....with "Exceeds Expectations.
brilliant. Um...
well, I'll head there straightaway. - Oh, good, good.
Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
I don't wanna take Potions.
this is Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice.
attention to detail in the preparation...is the prerequisite of all planning.
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see.
Ron Weasley, sir.
but I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually.
I'm gonna... - Nonsense, we'll sort you out.
any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.
I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor has Ron.
get what you want from the cupboard.
now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning.
any ideas what these might be?
Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir.
that one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum.
and that would be Polyjuice Potion.
it's terribly tricky to make.
and this is Amortentia...
...the most powerful love potion in the world.
it's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.
for example, I smell...
...freshly mown grass, and new parchment, and...
...spearmint toothpaste.
Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible.
but it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession.
and for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.
sir? You haven't told us what's in that one.
Oh, yes.
what you see before you, ladies and gentlemen...is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.
but it is more commonly referred to as...
liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.
desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.
one sip and you will find that all of your endeavors succeed.
at least until the effects wear off.
so this is what I offer each of you today.
one tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains...
...manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death...
...the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.
I should point out, however, only once did a student...manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.
nevertheless, good luck to you all.
let the brewing commence.
this book is the property of the half blood prince, cut the sopophorus bean
how did you do that?
you crush it. Don't cut it.
no. The instructions specifically say to cut.
no, really.
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.
so perfect I daresay one drop would kill us all.
so here we are, then, as promised.
one vial of Felix Felicis.
Congratulations.
use it well.
Harry, you got my message. Come in.
how are you?
I'm fine, sir.
enjoying your classes?
I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you.
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
do you?
definitely.
what about your activities outside the classroom?
sir? - Well, I notice you spend...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.
I can't help wondering...
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no.
forgive me. I was merely being curious.
but enough chitchat.
you must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight.
the answer lies here.
what you are looking at are memories.
in this case, pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.
this vial contains the most particular memory of the day I first met him.
I'd like you to see it, if you would.
I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.
wool's orphan
in all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor.
there have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things.
Tom, you have a visitor.
how do you do, Tom?
don't.
you're the doctor, aren't you? - No.
I am a professor.
I don't believe you.
she wants me looked at.
they think I'm different.
well, perhaps they're right.
I'm not mad.
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
Hogwarts is a school.
a school of magic.
you can do things, can't you, Tom?
things other children can't.
I can make things move without touching them.
I can make animals do what I want without training them.
I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.
I can make them hurt...
...if I want.
who are you?
well, I'm like you, Tom.
I'm different.
prove it.
I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.
thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.
at Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.
you understand me?
I can speak to snakes too.
they find me.
whisper things.
is that normal for someone like me?
did you know, sir? Then?
did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.
if I had, I...
over time, while here at Hogwarts...
...Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.
can you guess who that teacher might be?
you didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you?
no, I did not.
you see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.
and he will not give it up easily.
you said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
I did.
do you want me to let him?
Yes.
all right. Um...
this morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills...
...just to assess your strengths.
quiet! Please!
shut it!
Thanks. All right. Um...
just because you made the team last year...
...does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?
good.
no hard feelings, Weasley, all right?
hard feelings?
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal.
Really? Strapping guy like you?
you've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think?
keepers need to be quick, agile.
Oh, I like my chances.
say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?
wouldn't mind getting on a first-name basis, know what I mean?
come on, Weasley!
come on, Ron! - Go on, Weasley!
go on, Weasley! - Yeah, Ron!
go on, Cormac!
come on, Ron!
come on, Ron.
Confundus.
isn't he brilliant?
I have to admit, I thought I was gonna miss that last one.
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
he's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.
he's vile.
have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?
no, I haven't.
and if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.
not bloody likely. He's top of the class.
he's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
what?
I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look.
no.
why not?
the binding is fragile.
the binding is fragile? - Yeah.
who's the Half-Blood Prince? - Who?
that's what it says right here: "This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince.
for weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it...
... yet you have no desire to find out who he is?
I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it.
well, it's true.
I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book.
it's just like being with Hermione.
well, I was curious, so I went to...
the library. - The library. And?
and nothing.
I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince.
there we go. That settles it, then. - Filius!
I was hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks!
no, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.
does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?
a chum of mine was sledging down Claxby Hill.
we had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge...
no, not there. Over here.
no, sit beside me.
okay.
something to drink?
three Butterbeers, and some ginger in mine, please.
Oh, bloody hell.
slick git.
honestly, Ronald, they're only holding hands.
and snogging.
I'd like to leave. - What?
you can't be serious.
that happens to be my sister. - So?
what if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her to leave?
Hey, my boy! - Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.
and you, and you.
so, what brings you here?
the Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit.
I can remember when it was One Broomstick.
all hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days...
...I used to throw together the occasional supper party...
...for the select student or two.
would you be game? - I'd consider it an honor, sir.
you would be welcome too, Granger.
I'd be delighted, sir. - Splendid. Look for my owl.
good to see you, Wallenby.
what are you playing at?
Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.
get to know him? - I don't know.
it must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
got a little bit...
Katie, you don't know what it could be.
Harry. - What?
did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging?
as if.
I warned her. I warned her not to touch it.
don't get any closer. Get back, all of you.
do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand?
you're sure Katie did not have this in her possession...when she entered the Three Broomsticks?
it's like I said.
she left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package.
she said it was important that she deliver it.
did she say to whom? - To Professor Dumbledore.
very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go.
why is it when something happens it is always you three?
believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
Oh, Severus.
what do you think?
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
she was cursed, wasn't she?
I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly.
if she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.
Yes, she was cursed.
it was Malfoy.
that is a very serious accusation, Potter.
indeed.
your evidence? - I just know.
you just...
...know.
you astonish with your gifts, Potter.
gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing.
how grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.
what do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny?
well, what does she see in him?
Dean? He's brilliant.
you called him a slick git not five hours ago.
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?
something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle.
I suppose.
so, what is it he sees in her? - I don't know.
she's smart, funny.
attractive. - Attractive?
you know, she's got nice skin. - Skin?
Dean dates my sister because of her skin?
well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.
hermione's got nice skin.
wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.
I've never really thought about it.
but, I suppose, yeah.
very nice.
I think I'll be going to sleep now. - Right. Yeah.
so tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?
Yes, sir. In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him...
...and the Minister for Magic over the holidays.
well, be sure to give them both my best.
what about your uncle, Belby?
for those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.
is he working on anything new? - Don't know.
him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish.
says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.
what about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the Muggle world?
my parents are dentists.
they tend to people's teeth.
fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?
no.
although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once.
he needed 10 stitches.
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.
look at her eyes. They've been fighting again, her and Dean.
sorry. I'm not usually late.
no matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any.
what?
nothing.
goodbye. Bye-bye.
Potter. - I'm sorry, sir.
I was just admiring your hourglass.
Oh, yes.
a most intriguing object.
the sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation.
if it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.
if it is not... - I think I'll be going.
nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy.
as to some of your classmates...
...well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.
the shelf, sir?
anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.
but then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?
did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
you knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts.
what was he like?
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.
he killed my parents.
of course.
it's only natural you should want to know more.
but I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.
when I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet...albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.
not unlike others I've known.
not unlike yourself, in fact.
if the monster existed...
...it was buried deep within.
good luck, eh, Ron.
nice hat! - Ron, you're a loser.
I'm counting on you, Ron. I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?
looking good, Ron. - Loser!
what's he wearing?
so how was it, then?
how was what? - Your dinner party?
pretty boring, actually.
though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know.
and we're meant to bring someone.
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?
actually, I was going to ask you. - Really?
good luck today, Ron.
I know you'll be brilliant.
I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.
have it your way.
juice? - Sure.
Hello, everyone.
you look dreadful, Ron.
is that why you put something in his cup?
is it a tonic?
liquid luck.
don't drink it, Ron.
you could be expelled for that. - I don't know what you're talking about.
come on, Harry. We've got a game to win.
go on, Ron! Do it!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
you really shouldn't have done it.
I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.
that was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game.
you didn't put it in.
Ron only thought you did.
charms spell. I'm just practicing.
well, they're really good.
how does it feel, Harry?
when you see Dean with Ginny?
I know.
I see the way you look at her.
you're my best friend.
Oops.
I think this room's taken.
what's with the birds?
Oppugno.
it feels like this.
look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.
what Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it.
it's chemical.
will it last? Who knows? Point is, I'm a free agent.
he's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever he likes.
I really couldn't care less.
was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?
Yes.
now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.
have you?
Yes. Why?
I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to...
...we should go together, as friends.
why didn't I think of that?
who are you going with?
um, it's a surprise.
anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone.
see that girl over there?
that's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.
Really?
Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.
but I am the Chosen One.
okay, sorry. Um, kidding.
I'll ask someone I like.
someone cool.
I've never been to this part of the castle.
at least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see.
that's why I wear shoes to bed.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
drink?
Neville.
I didn't get into the Slug Club.
it's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks. - Okay.
Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?
I've just escaped. I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.
Cormac? That's who you invited?
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.
thank you. I'll catch up with you later.
he's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
dragon tartare? - No, I'm fine. Thank you.
just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.
on second thoughts...
might keep Cormac at bay.
Oh, God, here he comes.
I think she just went to powder her nose.
slippery little minx, your friend.
likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?
what is this I'm eating, by the way?
dragon balls.
you've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.
not so quick, Potter.
sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date...
can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
besides, I only wish to convey a message.
a message? - From Professor Dumbledore.
he asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.
you see...
...he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes.
traveling where?
take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!
professor Slughorn, sir.
I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.
he claims to have been invited to your party.
okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?
I'll escort him out.
certainly, professor.
all right, everyone, carry on, carry on.
maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?
I swore to protect you.
I made the Unbreakable Vow.
I don't need protection.
I was chosen for this. Out of all others. Me.
and I won't fail him. - You're afraid, Draco.
you attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you.
No!
I was chosen. This is my moment.
unbreakable Vow.
you're sure that's what Snape said?
positive. Why?
well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.
I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
you don't understand.
Oh, bloody hell.
I miss you.
lovely.
all she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
I'll take your word for it.
so, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?
you die.
wait, the pudding's still here.
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
I know it sounds mad.
has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help...
...so he could find out what he was up to?
that's not what it sounded like. - Perhaps Harry's right.
to make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...
it comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment.
Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do. - Dumbledore can make mistakes.
you're blinded by hatred.
I'm not. - Yes, you are.
people are disappearing, Harry, daily.
we place our trust in a handful of people.
if we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
open up, you.
don't you trust me?
it's good.
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.
pie? - Not for me, no.
you'll have to forgive Remus.
it takes its toll, his condition.
are you all right, Mr. Weasley?
we're being followed, all of us.
most days, Molly doesn't leave the house.
it's not been easy.
did you get my owl?
Yes, I did.
if Dumbledore's traveling, then that's news to the Ministry...
...but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.
as for Draco Malfoy...
...I know a bit more.
go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.
I think, from what you described...
...what you and Ron saw in summer...
...the object that Draco is so interested in...
...is a vanishing cabinet.
a vanishing cabinet?
they were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power.
you can see the appeal. Should Death Eaters come knocking...
...one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.
they can transport you anywhere.
tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.
what happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes?
nothing.
it's still there.
it was delicious, Molly, really.
are you sure you won't stay?
no, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.
Remus?
sweetheart.
has Ron gone to bed?
um... Not yet. No.
shoelace.
merry Christmas, Harry.
merry Christmas.
Harry, no! - Remus!
Ginny!
I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black!
you coming to get me?
Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me?
Harry?
Stupefy!
Harry!
Ginny!
Molly.
it's easy for them to get to you.
you're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry.
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?
sorry.
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.
that's my Won-Won.
excuse me, I have to go and vomit.
I'd like to know where you get your information.
more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.
sir...
...is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
now, Tom. I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?
by the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite.
but how did you know?
intuition.
gracious. Is it that time already?
off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention.
look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours.
is something on your mind, Tom? - Yes, sir.
you see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.
the other professors, well, they're not like you.
they might misunderstand.
go on.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.
and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.
it's called, as I understand it...
I beg your pardon?
I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!
now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again!
confused?
I'd be surprised if you weren't.
well, I don't understand. What happened?
this is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.
it is also a lie.
this memory has been tampered with...
...By the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.
but why would he tamper with his own memory?
I suspect he's ashamed of it. - Why?
why, indeed?
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.
now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory...
...any way you can.
I don't know him that well, sir.
this memory is everything.
without it, we are blind.
without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.
you have no choice.
you must not fail.
so I'd highly recommend you reacquaint yourself...with the chapter on antidotes.
I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go.
alys, don't forget your rat tail.
Aha. If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself.
to what do I owe this pleasure?
sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
ask away, dear boy, ask away.
the other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section...
...and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.
Yes. And what was this rare piece of magic?
well, I don't know. I can't remember the name exactly.
it got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?
I'm Potions Master, Harry.
I think your question'd better be posed to Professor Snape.
Yes. Um...
he and I don't exactly see eye to eye, sir.
what I mean to say is...
...well, he's not like you.
he might misunderstand.
Yes. There can be no light without the dark.
and so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light.
I suggest you do the same.
is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions?
Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?
didn't he?
yes?
Oh, it's you, Potter.
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
it's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.
divine.
had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
it was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.
or 20. - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you.
she could never annoy me.
I think I love her.
well, brilliant.
do you think she knows I exist?
I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.
snogging? Who are you talking about?
who are you talking about?
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
okay, very funny.
what was that for? - It's no joke! I'm in love with her!
fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?
no. Can you introduce me?
come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.
Where's Romilda?
what's the matter with Wenby?
very powerful love potion.
very well. Better bring him in.
I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.
well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir.
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
perhaps you're right.
I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding.
Oh, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know? Correct?
I expect you're tired of it after all these years.
all the questions about Voldemort.
don't use that name.
there you are, old boy. Bottoms up.
what's this? - Tonic for the nerves.
what happened to me? - Love potion.
a bloody strong one at that.
I feel really bad. - You need a pick-me-up.
got Butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.
I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances...
here we are, Potter.
to life!
Ron.
Ron. Professor, do something.
I don't understand.
come on, Ron, breathe.
these girls, they're gonna kill me.
quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar.
you must be very proud of your student, Horace.
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.
I think we agree, Potter's actions were heroic.
the question is, why were they necessary?
why, indeed?
this appears to be a gift, Horace.
you don't remember who gave you this bottle?
which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry...
...when not polluted with poison.
actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
to whom, I might ask?
to you, Headmaster.
where is he?
Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me?
what's she doing here?
I might ask you the same question.
I happen to be his girlfriend.
I happen to be his friend.
don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks.
I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting.
he's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!
and for the record, I've always found him interesting.
Ah. See? He senses my presence.
don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.
I'm here.
uh... Hermione...
Hermione.
Hermione.
Oh, to be young, and to feel love's keen sting.
well, come away, everybody.
Mr. Weasley is well tended.
about time, don't you think?
thank you.
Oh, shut up.
stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.
tell me how I broke up with Lavender again.
um, well...
...she came to visit you in the hospital.
and you talked.
I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation.
don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.
it's just she seems a bit put out.
Yes, she does, doesn't she?
you say you don't remember anything from that night?
anything at all?
there is something.
but it can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
right. Boggled.
Harry.
that's Katie.
Katie Bell.
Katie. How are you?
I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.
I've been trying to remember, honestly.
but I just can't.
Katie?
I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you?
Sectumsempra!
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
you have to get rid of it. Today.
take my hand.
the Room of Requirement.
we need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book...
...where no one will ever find it, including you.
what was that? - What was that?
see?
you never know what you'll find up here.
all right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.
close your eyes.
that can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
so did you and Ginny do it, then?
what?
you know, hide the book?
Oh, yeah.
Ah. Dear, yes.
still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?
luck.
that's it. All I need's a bit of luck.
well, how do you feel?
excellent.
really excellent.
remember...
...Slughorn usually eats early...
...takes a walk, and then returns to his office.
right.
I'm going down to Hagrid's. - What?
no, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn.
we have a plan. - I know...
...but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's.
I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?
no. - Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.
or Felix does.
Merlin's beard, Harry!
sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed.
you probably feared I was Professor Sprout.
Yes, I did, actually. What makes you think that?
well, just the general behavior, sir.
the sneaking around, the jumping when you saw me.
are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?
ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.
not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors.
my own interests are purely academic, of course.
personally, these plants always kind of freaked me out.
how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
through the front door, sir.
I'm off to Hagrid's. He's a very dear friend...
...and I fancied paying him a visit.
so if you don't mind, I will be going now.
Harry!
sir? - It's nearly nightfall.
surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.
well, then, by all means, come along, sir.
Harry, I must insist you accompany me...
...back to the castle immediately!
that would be counterproductive, sir.
and what makes you say that?
no idea.
Horace.
Merlin's beard. Is that an actual Acromantula?
a dead one, I think, sir.
good God.
dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?
kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.
I'm so sorry, I didn't... - Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.
seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are.
it's the eyes, I reckon. They unnerve some folk.
not to mention the pincers.
Yeah, I reckon that too.
Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate...
...but Acromantular venom is uncommonly rare.
would you allow me to extract a vial or two?
purely for academic purposes, you understand.
well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it?
my thoughts exactly.
always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this.
old Potions Master's habit, you know.
I wish you could've seen him in his prime.
magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.
Oh, dear.
would you like me to say a few words? - Yes.
he had a family, I trust?
Oh, yeah.
farewell...
Aragog.
farewell, Aragog...
...King of the arachnids.
your body will decay...
...but your spirit lingers on.
and your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained.
I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.
no bigger than a Pekinese. A Pekinese, mind you.
how sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me.
one afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished.
poof.
that's very odd, isn't it? - It is, isn't it?
but that's life, I suppose.
you go along and then suddenly, poof!
poof. - Poof.
it was a student who gave me Francis.
one spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk...
...with just a few inches of clear water in it.
and floating on the surface was a flower petal.
as I watched, it sank.
just before it reached the bottom...
...it transformed...
...into a wee fish.
it was beautiful magic.
wondrous to behold.
the flower petal had come from a lily.
your mother.
the day I came downstairs...
...the day the bowl was empty...
...was the day your mother...
I know why you're here.
but I can't help you.
it would ruin me.
do you know why I survived, professor?
the night I got this?
because of her.
because she sacrificed herself.
because she refused to step aside.
because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
don't say his name. - I'm not afraid of the name, professor.
I'm going to tell you something.
something others have only guessed at.
it's true.
I am the Chosen One.
only I can destroy him, but in order to do so...
...I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office...
...and I need to know what you told him.
be brave, professor.
be brave like my mother.
otherwise, you disgrace her.
otherwise, she died for nothing.
otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever.
please, don't think badly of me when you see it.
you've no idea what he was like, even then.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.
it's called, as I understand it...
...a Horcrux.
I beg your pardon? - Horcrux.
I came across the term while reading...
...and I didn't fully understand it.
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom...
...but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.
which is...
...why I came to you.
a Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
but I don't understand how that works, sir.
one splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.
by doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
protected?
that part of your soul that is hidden lives on.
in other words, you cannot die.
and how does one split his soul, sir?
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.
murder.
Yes.
killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.
can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...?
seven?
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person?
to rip the soul into seven pieces...
this is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?
of course, sir.
it'll be our little secret.
sir.
this is beyond anything I imagined.
you mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux?
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once.
what are they exactly?
could be anything. Most commonplace of objects.
a ring, for example.
or a book.
Tom Riddle's diary. - It's a Horcrux, yes.
four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life...
...in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this.
I knew this was a different kind of magic.
very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.
the ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother.
difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy.
but if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux...
one destroys Voldemort.
but how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere.
true. But magic, especially dark magic...
...leaves traces.
it's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?
when you leave the school? - Yes.
and I think perhaps I may have found another.
but this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.
have you ever considered that you ask too much...
...that you take too much for granted?
has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.
I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.
Oh, Harry.
you need a shave, my friend.
you know, at times, I forget how much you've grown.
at times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard.
forgive my mawkishness, Harry.
I'm an old man.
you still look the same to me, sir.
just like your mother, you're unfailingly kind.
a trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid.
the place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous.
I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.
but there is one condition:
you must obey every command I give you, without question.
Yes, sir.
you do understand what I'm saying?
should I tell you to hide, you hide.
should I tell you to run, you run.
should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so.
your word, Harry.
my word.
take my arm.
sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
well, being me has its privileges.
this is the place.
Oh, yes.
this place has known magic.
sir! - In order to gain passage...
...payment must be made.
payment intended to weaken any intruder.
you should've let me, sir. - No, Harry.
your blood's much more precious than mine.
Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place.
he will have put certain defenses in position.
careful.
there it is.
the only question is, how do we get there?
if you would, Harry.
do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Oh, yes.
it has to be drunk.
all of it has to be drunk.
you remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?
this potion might paralyze me.
might make me forget why I'm here.
might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.
you are not to indulge these requests.
it's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.
even if you have to force it down my throat.
understood? - Why can't I drink it, sir?
because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.
your good health, Harry.
professor.
professor!
Harry.
professor, can you hear me?
professor.
no. Don't.
you have to keep drinking, like you said. Remember?
stop. - It will stop. It will stop...
...but only if you keep drinking. - Please, don't make me.
I'm sorry, sir. - Please.
kill me. Kill me! - No!
it's my fault.
it's all my fault.
it's my fault.
just one more, sir. One more, and then I promise...
...I promise I'll do what you say.
I promise. - No.
please.
Harry.
water.
water.
water.
you did it, sir.
look.
Harry.
water.
Aguamenti.
water.
Lumos.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Sectumsempra!
Harry.
Stupefy! - Harry.
Harry.
partis Temporus!
go to your houses. No dawdling.
we need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.
no.
Severus. Severus is who I need.
wake him. Tell him what happened.
speak to no one else.
Severus, Harry.
hide yourself below, Harry.
don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission.
whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below.
Harry, do as I say.
trust me.
trust me.
good evening, Draco.
what brings you here on this fine spring evening?
who else is here? I heard you talking.
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.
have you been whispering to yourself, Draco?
Draco...
...you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am?
I've done things that would shock you.
like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?
replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?
forgive me, Draco.
I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak...
...your heart can't really have been in them.
he trusts me. I was chosen.
then I shall make it easy for you.
Expelliarmus!
very good. Very good.
you're not alone.
there are others.
how?
the vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
I've been mending it. - Let me guess.
it has a sister. A twin.
in Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage.
ingenious.
Draco...
...years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices.
please let me help you. - I don't want your help!
don't you understand? I have to do this.
I have to kill you.
or he's gonna kill me.
well, look what we have here.
well done, Draco.
good evening, Bellatrix.
I think introductions are in order, don't you?
love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.
do it.
he doesn't have the stomach, just like his father.
let me finish him in my own way.
No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it.
this is your moment. Do it.
go on, Draco.
now!
no.
Severus.
please.
Avada Kedavra.
Hagrid! Hello?
Snape! He trusted you!
go on.
Incarcerous.
fight back! You coward, fight back!
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.
Sectumsempra!
you dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
Yes.
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
Potter...
...in light of what has happened...
...if you should have the need to talk to someone...
you should know, Professor Dumbledore...
...you meant a great deal to him.
do you think he would've done it?
Draco?
no.
no, he was lowering his wand.
in the end, it was Snape.
it was always Snape.
and I did nothing.
it's fake.
open it.
to the Dark Lord： I know I will be dead long before you read this........
...but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match...
...you will be mortal once more.
don't know.
but whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.
which means it was all a waste.
all of it.
Ron's okay with it, you know.
you and Ginny.
but if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
I'm not coming back, Hermione.
I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started.
and I don't know where that'll lead me...
...but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can.
I've always admired your courage, Harry.
but sometimes, you can be really thick.
you don't really think you're going to be able...
...to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?
you need us, Harry.
I never realized how beautiful this place was.
I killed Sirius Black!
he's back.
the police are continuing with the investigation...into the cause of the Millennium Bridge disaster.
traffic has been halted as police search for survivors.
the surrounding area remains closed.
the mayor has urged Londoners to remain calm...
Harry Potter.
who's Harry Potter?
Oh, no one.
bit of a tosser, really.
funny, that paper of yours.
couple nights ago, I could've sworn I saw a picture move.
Really? - Thought I was going around the twist.
Hey, I was wondering... - Eleven. That's when I get off.
you can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.
you've been reckless this summer, Harry.
I like riding around on trains.
takes my mind off things.
rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?
the tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.
but now is not the time to tell it.
take my arm.
do as I say.
I just Apparated, didn't I?
indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add.
most people vomit the first time.
I can't imagine why.
welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're wondering why I brought you here.
am I right?
actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it.
wands out, Harry.
Horace?
Horace?
Merlin's beard!
no need to disfigure me, Albus.
well, I must say you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
it's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
dragon's blood.
Oh. - Oh, yes, introductions.
Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine...
...Horace Slughorn.
Horace...
...well, you know who this is.
Harry Potter.
what's with all the theatrics, Horace?
you weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else?
someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
all right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.
do you know what that's like?
you can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week.
muggles who own this are in the Canary Islands.
well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind.
that was fun.
do you mind if I use the loo? - No, of course.
don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus.
the answer's still no. Absolutely and unequivocally, no.
you're very like your father.
except for the eyes. You have your... - My mother's eyes. Yeah.
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright, your mother.
even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
one of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year.
please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no.
your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is.
right at the front.
all mine. Each and every one.
Ex-students, I mean.
you recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.
always takes my owl, should I wish to register an opinion.....on the news of the day.
Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies.
free tickets whenever I want them.
of course, I haven't been to a match in some time.
Ah, yes.
Regulus Black.
you no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.
I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.
it's a shame. Talented boy.
I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.
Horace?
do you mind if I take this?
I do love knitting patterns. - Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?
I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable.
I would have considered it a personal triumph...had you consented to return to Hogwarts. -Oh, well.
you're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.
well, bye-bye, Horace.
Bye.
all right. I'll do it.
but I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before.
and I expect a raise. These are mad times we live in. Mad!
they are indeed.
sir, exactly what was all that about?
you are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values.
professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry.
you would be his crowning jewel.
that's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return.
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry.
she was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.
it's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.
Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
but, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?
both are waiting for you.
Hedwig.
mum?
Ginny, what is it?
I was only wondering when Harry got here.
what? Harry? Harry who? - Harry Potter, of course.
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
his trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl. - No, dear, I seriously doubt that.
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?
me, nosy. Is he up there with you?
of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?
is that an owl? - You haven't seen him, have you?
he's wandering about the house.
Really? - Really.
Harry!
Harry!
what a lovely surprise.
why didn't you let us know you were coming?
I didn't know. Dumbledore. - Oh, that man.
but then, what would we do without him?
got a bit of toothpaste.
so when did you get here?
a few days ago.
though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming.
mum sort of lost it last week.
said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.
that it's too dangerous.
Oh, come on. - She's not alone.
even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening.
anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy...and it took a few days, but she came around.
but this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?
there's been a lot of talk recently that...
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.
rubbish! Well, he's only...
what is he?
hundred and fifty? Give or take a few years.
Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted!
the Dark Lord trusts him.
the Dark Lord's mistaken.
run along, Wormtail.
I know I ought not to be here.
the Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this.
if the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours.
as it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
you?
the Dark Lord told you?
your sister doubts me.
understandable. Over the years I've played my part well.
so well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
I don't doubt you, Severus.
you should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.
he's just a boy.
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.
but it might be possible for me to help Draco.
Severus. - Swear to it.
make the Unbreakable Vow.
it's just empty words.
he'll give it his best effort.
but when it matters most...he'll just slither back into his hole.
coward.
take out your wand.
will you...
...Severus Snape...
...watch over Draco Malfoy...
...as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?
I will.
and will you, to the best of your ability...protect him from harm?
I will.
and if Draco should fail...will you yourself carry out the deed...the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
I will.
step up! Step up! We've got Fainting Fancies!
nosebleed Nougats!
and just in time for school... - Puking Pastilles!
into the cauldron, handsome.
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. - A real money spinner, that.
handy if you need to make a quick getaway.
Hello, ladies.
love potions, eh? - Yeah, they really do work.
then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.
Meaning?
are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
it's none of your business.
how much for this?
five Galleons.
how much for me? - Five Galleons.
I'm your brother.
ten Galleons.
come on, let's go.
Hi, Ron.
how are Fred and George doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
I reckon he's right.
Oh, no.
everyone got their wands from Ollivander's.
Harry?
is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people...who don't want to be followed?
quibbler.
quibbler.
he's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know.
Quibbler? - Oh, please.
what's a Wrackspurt? - They're invisible creatures.
they float in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.
quibbler.
so, what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet?
and who were all those people?
don't you see? It was a ceremony, an initiation.
stop it, Harry. I know where you're going.
it's happened. He's one of them.
one of what?
Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
you're barking.
what would you know who want with Malfoy?
well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?
it's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.
look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense.
hermione saw it with her own eyes.
I told you, I don't know what I saw.
I need some air.
don't worry. When we get to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.
what was that? Blaise? - Don't know.
relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around.
come on, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon.
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school.
I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower...if I had to continue for another two years.
what's that supposed to mean?
let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.
amused, Blaise?
we'll see just who's laughing in the end.
you two go on. I wanna check something.
Where's Harry?
he's probably already on the platform. Come on.
didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?
Petrificus Totalus.
...she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.
that's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London.
finite.
Hello, Harry. - Luna!
how'd you know where I was? - Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.
that's all right. It was like being with a friend.
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.
that's nice.
about time. I've been looking all over for you two.
right. Names?
professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.
no exceptions, Potter.
who are those people?
Aurors. For security.
what's this cane here, then?
it's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.
and what exactly would you be wanting with a...?
could be construed as an offensive weapon.
it's all right, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
nice face, Potter.
would you like me to fix it for you?
personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way...
...but it's up to you.
well, have you ever fixed a nose before?
no, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really?
um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.
Episkey. - Ah!
how do I look? - Exceptionally ordinary.
brilliant.
don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.
will you stop eating?
your best friend is missing!
oi. Turn around, you lunatic.
he's covered in blood again.
why is it he's always covered in blood? - Looks like it's his own this time.
where have you been?
what happened to your face? - Later.
what've I missed?
sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times.
easy for it to say, huh? It's a hat, isn't it?
very best of evenings to you all.
Thanks.
first off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff...
...Horace Slughorn.
professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...has agreed to resume his old post as Potions Master.
meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts......will be taken by Professor Snape.
Snape?
now, as you know...
...each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight.
and you have the right to know why.
once there was a young man, who, like you...
...sat in this very hall...
...walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.
he seemed to all the world a student like any other.
his name?
Tom Riddle.
today, of course...
...he's known all over the world by another name.
which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight...
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.
every day, every hour...
...this very minute, perhaps...
...dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.
but in the end, their greatest weapon is you.
just something to think about.
now, off to bed. Pip-pip.
that was cheerful.
history of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies! That is the girls' lavatory.
Potter.
Oh, this can't be good.
enjoying ourselves, are we?
I had a free period this morning. - So I noticed.
I would think you would want to fill it with Potions.
or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
it was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" in my O. W.L.
so you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.
however, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N. E.W. T. S students....with "Exceeds Expectations.
brilliant. Um...
well, I'll head there straightaway. - Oh, good, good.
Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
I don't wanna take Potions.
this is Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice.
attention to detail in the preparation...is the prerequisite of all planning.
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see.
Ron Weasley, sir.
but I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually.
I'm gonna... - Nonsense, we'll sort you out.
any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.
I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor has Ron.
get what you want from the cupboard.
now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning.
any ideas what these might be?
Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir.
that one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum.
and that would be Polyjuice Potion.
it's terribly tricky to make.
and this is Amortentia...
...the most powerful love potion in the world.
it's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.
for example, I smell...
...freshly mown grass, and new parchment, and...
...spearmint toothpaste.
Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible.
but it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession.
and for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.
sir? You haven't told us what's in that one.
Oh, yes.
what you see before you, ladies and gentlemen...is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.
but it is more commonly referred to as...
liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.
desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.
one sip and you will find that all of your endeavors succeed.
at least until the effects wear off.
so this is what I offer each of you today.
one tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains...
...manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death...
...the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.
I should point out, however, only once did a student...manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.
nevertheless, good luck to you all.
let the brewing commence.
this book is the property of the half blood prince, cut the sopophorus bean
how did you do that?
you crush it. Don't cut it.
no. The instructions specifically say to cut.
no, really.
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.
so perfect I daresay one drop would kill us all.
so here we are, then, as promised.
one vial of Felix Felicis.
Congratulations.
use it well.
Harry, you got my message. Come in.
how are you?
I'm fine, sir.
enjoying your classes?
I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you.
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
do you?
definitely.
what about your activities outside the classroom?
sir? - Well, I notice you spend...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.
I can't help wondering...
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no.
forgive me. I was merely being curious.
but enough chitchat.
you must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight.
the answer lies here.
what you are looking at are memories.
in this case, pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.
this vial contains the most particular memory of the day I first met him.
I'd like you to see it, if you would.
I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.
wool's orphan
in all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor.
there have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things.
Tom, you have a visitor.
how do you do, Tom?
don't.
you're the doctor, aren't you? - No.
I am a professor.
I don't believe you.
she wants me looked at.
they think I'm different.
well, perhaps they're right.
I'm not mad.
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
Hogwarts is a school.
a school of magic.
you can do things, can't you, Tom?
things other children can't.
I can make things move without touching them.
I can make animals do what I want without training them.
I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.
I can make them hurt...
...if I want.
who are you?
well, I'm like you, Tom.
I'm different.
prove it.
I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.
thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.
at Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.
you understand me?
I can speak to snakes too.
they find me.
whisper things.
is that normal for someone like me?
did you know, sir? Then?
did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.
if I had, I...
over time, while here at Hogwarts...
...Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.
can you guess who that teacher might be?
you didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you?
no, I did not.
you see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.
and he will not give it up easily.
you said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
I did.
do you want me to let him?
Yes.
all right. Um...
this morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills...
...just to assess your strengths.
quiet! Please!
shut it!
Thanks. All right. Um...
just because you made the team last year...
...does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?
good.
no hard feelings, Weasley, all right?
hard feelings?
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal.
Really? Strapping guy like you?
you've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think?
keepers need to be quick, agile.
Oh, I like my chances.
say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?
wouldn't mind getting on a first-name basis, know what I mean?
come on, Weasley!
come on, Ron! - Go on, Weasley!
go on, Weasley! - Yeah, Ron!
go on, Cormac!
come on, Ron!
come on, Ron.
Confundus.
isn't he brilliant?
I have to admit, I thought I was gonna miss that last one.
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
he's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.
he's vile.
have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?
no, I haven't.
and if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.
not bloody likely. He's top of the class.
he's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
what?
I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look.
no.
why not?
the binding is fragile.
the binding is fragile? - Yeah.
who's the Half-Blood Prince? - Who?
that's what it says right here: "This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince.
for weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it...
... yet you have no desire to find out who he is?
I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it.
well, it's true.
I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book.
it's just like being with Hermione.
well, I was curious, so I went to...
the library. - The library. And?
and nothing.
I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince.
there we go. That settles it, then. - Filius!
I was hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks!
no, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.
does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?
a chum of mine was sledging down Claxby Hill.
we had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge...
no, not there. Over here.
no, sit beside me.
okay.
something to drink?
three Butterbeers, and some ginger in mine, please.
Oh, bloody hell.
slick git.
honestly, Ronald, they're only holding hands.
and snogging.
I'd like to leave. - What?
you can't be serious.
that happens to be my sister. - So?
what if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her to leave?
Hey, my boy! - Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.
and you, and you.
so, what brings you here?
the Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit.
I can remember when it was One Broomstick.
all hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days...
...I used to throw together the occasional supper party...
...for the select student or two.
would you be game? - I'd consider it an honor, sir.
you would be welcome too, Granger.
I'd be delighted, sir. - Splendid. Look for my owl.
good to see you, Wallenby.
what are you playing at?
Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.
get to know him? - I don't know.
it must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
got a little bit...
Katie, you don't know what it could be.
Harry. - What?
did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging?
as if.
I warned her. I warned her not to touch it.
don't get any closer. Get back, all of you.
do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand?
you're sure Katie did not have this in her possession...when she entered the Three Broomsticks?
it's like I said.
she left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package.
she said it was important that she deliver it.
did she say to whom? - To Professor Dumbledore.
very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go.
why is it when something happens it is always you three?
believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
Oh, Severus.
what do you think?
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
she was cursed, wasn't she?
I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly.
if she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.
Yes, she was cursed.
it was Malfoy.
that is a very serious accusation, Potter.
indeed.
your evidence? - I just know.
you just...
...know.
you astonish with your gifts, Potter.
gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing.
how grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.
what do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny?
well, what does she see in him?
Dean? He's brilliant.
you called him a slick git not five hours ago.
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?
something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle.
I suppose.
so, what is it he sees in her? - I don't know.
she's smart, funny.
attractive. - Attractive?
you know, she's got nice skin. - Skin?
Dean dates my sister because of her skin?
well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.
hermione's got nice skin.
wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.
I've never really thought about it.
but, I suppose, yeah.
very nice.
I think I'll be going to sleep now. - Right. Yeah.
so tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?
Yes, sir. In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him...
...and the Minister for Magic over the holidays.
well, be sure to give them both my best.
what about your uncle, Belby?
for those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.
is he working on anything new? - Don't know.
him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish.
says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.
what about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the Muggle world?
my parents are dentists.
they tend to people's teeth.
fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?
no.
although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once.
he needed 10 stitches.
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.
look at her eyes. They've been fighting again, her and Dean.
sorry. I'm not usually late.
no matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any.
what?
nothing.
goodbye. Bye-bye.
Potter. - I'm sorry, sir.
I was just admiring your hourglass.
Oh, yes.
a most intriguing object.
the sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation.
if it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.
if it is not... - I think I'll be going.
nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy.
as to some of your classmates...
...well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.
the shelf, sir?
anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.
but then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?
did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
you knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts.
what was he like?
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.
he killed my parents.
of course.
it's only natural you should want to know more.
but I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.
when I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet...albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.
not unlike others I've known.
not unlike yourself, in fact.
if the monster existed...
...it was buried deep within.
good luck, eh, Ron.
nice hat! - Ron, you're a loser.
I'm counting on you, Ron. I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?
looking good, Ron. - Loser!
what's he wearing?
so how was it, then?
how was what? - Your dinner party?
pretty boring, actually.
though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know.
and we're meant to bring someone.
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?
actually, I was going to ask you. - Really?
good luck today, Ron.
I know you'll be brilliant.
I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.
have it your way.
juice? - Sure.
Hello, everyone.
you look dreadful, Ron.
is that why you put something in his cup?
is it a tonic?
liquid luck.
don't drink it, Ron.
you could be expelled for that. - I don't know what you're talking about.
come on, Harry. We've got a game to win.
go on, Ron! Do it!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
you really shouldn't have done it.
I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.
that was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game.
you didn't put it in.
Ron only thought you did.
charms spell. I'm just practicing.
well, they're really good.
how does it feel, Harry?
when you see Dean with Ginny?
I know.
I see the way you look at her.
you're my best friend.
Oops.
I think this room's taken.
what's with the birds?
Oppugno.
it feels like this.
look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.
what Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it.
it's chemical.
will it last? Who knows? Point is, I'm a free agent.
he's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever he likes.
I really couldn't care less.
was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?
Yes.
now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.
have you?
Yes. Why?
I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to...
...we should go together, as friends.
why didn't I think of that?
who are you going with?
um, it's a surprise.
anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone.
see that girl over there?
that's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.
Really?
Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.
but I am the Chosen One.
okay, sorry. Um, kidding.
I'll ask someone I like.
someone cool.
I've never been to this part of the castle.
at least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see.
that's why I wear shoes to bed.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
drink?
Neville.
I didn't get into the Slug Club.
it's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks. - Okay.
Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?
I've just escaped. I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.
Cormac? That's who you invited?
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.
thank you. I'll catch up with you later.
he's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
dragon tartare? - No, I'm fine. Thank you.
just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.
on second thoughts...
might keep Cormac at bay.
Oh, God, here he comes.
I think she just went to powder her nose.
slippery little minx, your friend.
likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?
what is this I'm eating, by the way?
dragon balls.
you've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.
not so quick, Potter.
sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date...
can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
besides, I only wish to convey a message.
a message? - From Professor Dumbledore.
he asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.
you see...
...he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes.
traveling where?
take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!
professor Slughorn, sir.
I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.
he claims to have been invited to your party.
okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?
I'll escort him out.
certainly, professor.
all right, everyone, carry on, carry on.
maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?
I swore to protect you.
I made the Unbreakable Vow.
I don't need protection.
I was chosen for this. Out of all others. Me.
and I won't fail him. - You're afraid, Draco.
you attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you.
No!
I was chosen. This is my moment.
unbreakable Vow.
you're sure that's what Snape said?
positive. Why?
well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.
I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
you don't understand.
Oh, bloody hell.
I miss you.
lovely.
all she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
I'll take your word for it.
so, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?
you die.
wait, the pudding's still here.
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
I know it sounds mad.
has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help...
...so he could find out what he was up to?
that's not what it sounded like. - Perhaps Harry's right.
to make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...
it comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment.
Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do. - Dumbledore can make mistakes.
you're blinded by hatred.
I'm not. - Yes, you are.
people are disappearing, Harry, daily.
we place our trust in a handful of people.
if we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
open up, you.
don't you trust me?
it's good.
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.
pie? - Not for me, no.
you'll have to forgive Remus.
it takes its toll, his condition.
are you all right, Mr. Weasley?
we're being followed, all of us.
most days, Molly doesn't leave the house.
it's not been easy.
did you get my owl?
Yes, I did.
if Dumbledore's traveling, then that's news to the Ministry...
...but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.
as for Draco Malfoy...
...I know a bit more.
go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.
I think, from what you described...
...what you and Ron saw in summer...
...the object that Draco is so interested in...
...is a vanishing cabinet.
a vanishing cabinet?
they were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power.
you can see the appeal. Should Death Eaters come knocking...
...one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.
they can transport you anywhere.
tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.
what happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes?
nothing.
it's still there.
it was delicious, Molly, really.
are you sure you won't stay?
no, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.
Remus?
sweetheart.
has Ron gone to bed?
um... Not yet. No.
shoelace.
merry Christmas, Harry.
merry Christmas.
Harry, no! - Remus!
Ginny!
I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black!
you coming to get me?
Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me?
Harry?
Stupefy!
Harry!
Ginny!
Molly.
it's easy for them to get to you.
you're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry.
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?
sorry.
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.
that's my Won-Won.
excuse me, I have to go and vomit.
I'd like to know where you get your information.
more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.
sir...
...is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
now, Tom. I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?
by the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite.
but how did you know?
intuition.
gracious. Is it that time already?
off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention.
look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours.
is something on your mind, Tom? - Yes, sir.
you see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.
the other professors, well, they're not like you.
they might misunderstand.
go on.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.
and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.
it's called, as I understand it...
I beg your pardon?
I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!
now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again!
confused?
I'd be surprised if you weren't.
well, I don't understand. What happened?
this is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.
it is also a lie.
this memory has been tampered with...
...By the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.
but why would he tamper with his own memory?
I suspect he's ashamed of it. - Why?
why, indeed?
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.
now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory...
...any way you can.
I don't know him that well, sir.
this memory is everything.
without it, we are blind.
without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.
you have no choice.
you must not fail.
so I'd highly recommend you reacquaint yourself...with the chapter on antidotes.
I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go.
alys, don't forget your rat tail.
Aha. If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself.
to what do I owe this pleasure?
sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
ask away, dear boy, ask away.
the other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section...
...and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.
Yes. And what was this rare piece of magic?
well, I don't know. I can't remember the name exactly.
it got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?
I'm Potions Master, Harry.
I think your question'd better be posed to Professor Snape.
Yes. Um...
he and I don't exactly see eye to eye, sir.
what I mean to say is...
...well, he's not like you.
he might misunderstand.
Yes. There can be no light without the dark.
and so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light.
I suggest you do the same.
is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions?
Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?
didn't he?
yes?
Oh, it's you, Potter.
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
it's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.
divine.
had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
it was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.
or 20. - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you.
she could never annoy me.
I think I love her.
well, brilliant.
do you think she knows I exist?
I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.
snogging? Who are you talking about?
who are you talking about?
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
okay, very funny.
what was that for? - It's no joke! I'm in love with her!
fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?
no. Can you introduce me?
come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.
Where's Romilda?
what's the matter with Wenby?
very powerful love potion.
very well. Better bring him in.
I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.
well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir.
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
perhaps you're right.
I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding.
Oh, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know? Correct?
I expect you're tired of it after all these years.
all the questions about Voldemort.
don't use that name.
there you are, old boy. Bottoms up.
what's this? - Tonic for the nerves.
what happened to me? - Love potion.
a bloody strong one at that.
I feel really bad. - You need a pick-me-up.
got Butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.
I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances...
here we are, Potter.
to life!
Ron.
Ron. Professor, do something.
I don't understand.
come on, Ron, breathe.
these girls, they're gonna kill me.
quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar.
you must be very proud of your student, Horace.
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.
I think we agree, Potter's actions were heroic.
the question is, why were they necessary?
why, indeed?
this appears to be a gift, Horace.
you don't remember who gave you this bottle?
which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry...
...when not polluted with poison.
actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
to whom, I might ask?
to you, Headmaster.
where is he?
Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me?
what's she doing here?
I might ask you the same question.
I happen to be his girlfriend.
I happen to be his friend.
don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks.
I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting.
he's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!
and for the record, I've always found him interesting.
Ah. See? He senses my presence.
don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.
I'm here.
uh... Hermione...
Hermione.
Hermione.
Oh, to be young, and to feel love's keen sting.
well, come away, everybody.
Mr. Weasley is well tended.
about time, don't you think?
thank you.
Oh, shut up.
stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.
tell me how I broke up with Lavender again.
um, well...
...she came to visit you in the hospital.
and you talked.
I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation.
don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.
it's just she seems a bit put out.
Yes, she does, doesn't she?
you say you don't remember anything from that night?
anything at all?
there is something.
but it can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
right. Boggled.
Harry.
that's Katie.
Katie Bell.
Katie. How are you?
I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.
I've been trying to remember, honestly.
but I just can't.
Katie?
I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you?
Sectumsempra!
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
you have to get rid of it. Today.
take my hand.
the Room of Requirement.
we need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book...
...where no one will ever find it, including you.
what was that? - What was that?
see?
you never know what you'll find up here.
all right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.
close your eyes.
that can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
so did you and Ginny do it, then?
what?
you know, hide the book?
Oh, yeah.
Ah. Dear, yes.
still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?
luck.
that's it. All I need's a bit of luck.
well, how do you feel?
excellent.
really excellent.
remember...
...Slughorn usually eats early...
...takes a walk, and then returns to his office.
right.
I'm going down to Hagrid's. - What?
no, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn.
we have a plan. - I know...
...but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's.
I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?
no. - Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.
or Felix does.
Merlin's beard, Harry!
sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed.
you probably feared I was Professor Sprout.
Yes, I did, actually. What makes you think that?
well, just the general behavior, sir.
the sneaking around, the jumping when you saw me.
are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?
ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.
not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors.
my own interests are purely academic, of course.
personally, these plants always kind of freaked me out.
how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
through the front door, sir.
I'm off to Hagrid's. He's a very dear friend...
...and I fancied paying him a visit.
so if you don't mind, I will be going now.
Harry!
sir? - It's nearly nightfall.
surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.
well, then, by all means, come along, sir.
Harry, I must insist you accompany me...
...back to the castle immediately!
that would be counterproductive, sir.
and what makes you say that?
no idea.
Horace.
Merlin's beard. Is that an actual Acromantula?
a dead one, I think, sir.
good God.
dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?
kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.
I'm so sorry, I didn't... - Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.
seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are.
it's the eyes, I reckon. They unnerve some folk.
not to mention the pincers.
Yeah, I reckon that too.
Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate...
...but Acromantular venom is uncommonly rare.
would you allow me to extract a vial or two?
purely for academic purposes, you understand.
well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it?
my thoughts exactly.
always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this.
old Potions Master's habit, you know.
I wish you could've seen him in his prime.
magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.
Oh, dear.
would you like me to say a few words? - Yes.
he had a family, I trust?
Oh, yeah.
farewell...
Aragog.
farewell, Aragog...
...King of the arachnids.
your body will decay...
...but your spirit lingers on.
and your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained.
I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.
no bigger than a Pekinese. A Pekinese, mind you.
how sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me.
one afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished.
poof.
that's very odd, isn't it? - It is, isn't it?
but that's life, I suppose.
you go along and then suddenly, poof!
poof. - Poof.
it was a student who gave me Francis.
one spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk...
...with just a few inches of clear water in it.
and floating on the surface was a flower petal.
as I watched, it sank.
just before it reached the bottom...
...it transformed...
...into a wee fish.
it was beautiful magic.
wondrous to behold.
the flower petal had come from a lily.
your mother.
the day I came downstairs...
...the day the bowl was empty...
...was the day your mother...
I know why you're here.
but I can't help you.
it would ruin me.
do you know why I survived, professor?
the night I got this?
because of her.
because she sacrificed herself.
because she refused to step aside.
because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
don't say his name. - I'm not afraid of the name, professor.
I'm going to tell you something.
something others have only guessed at.
it's true.
I am the Chosen One.
only I can destroy him, but in order to do so...
...I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office...
...and I need to know what you told him.
be brave, professor.
be brave like my mother.
otherwise, you disgrace her.
otherwise, she died for nothing.
otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever.
please, don't think badly of me when you see it.
you've no idea what he was like, even then.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.
it's called, as I understand it...
...a Horcrux.
I beg your pardon? - Horcrux.
I came across the term while reading...
...and I didn't fully understand it.
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom...
...but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.
which is...
...why I came to you.
a Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
but I don't understand how that works, sir.
one splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.
by doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
protected?
that part of your soul that is hidden lives on.
in other words, you cannot die.
and how does one split his soul, sir?
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.
murder.
Yes.
killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.
can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...?
seven?
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person?
to rip the soul into seven pieces...
this is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?
of course, sir.
it'll be our little secret.
sir.
this is beyond anything I imagined.
you mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux?
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once.
what are they exactly?
could be anything. Most commonplace of objects.
a ring, for example.
or a book.
Tom Riddle's diary. - It's a Horcrux, yes.
four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life...
...in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this.
I knew this was a different kind of magic.
very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.
the ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother.
difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy.
but if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux...
one destroys Voldemort.
but how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere.
true. But magic, especially dark magic...
...leaves traces.
it's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?
when you leave the school? - Yes.
and I think perhaps I may have found another.
but this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.
have you ever considered that you ask too much...
...that you take too much for granted?
has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.
I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.
Oh, Harry.
you need a shave, my friend.
you know, at times, I forget how much you've grown.
at times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard.
forgive my mawkishness, Harry.
I'm an old man.
you still look the same to me, sir.
just like your mother, you're unfailingly kind.
a trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid.
the place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous.
I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.
but there is one condition:
you must obey every command I give you, without question.
Yes, sir.
you do understand what I'm saying?
should I tell you to hide, you hide.
should I tell you to run, you run.
should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so.
your word, Harry.
my word.
take my arm.
sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
well, being me has its privileges.
this is the place.
Oh, yes.
this place has known magic.
sir! - In order to gain passage...
...payment must be made.
payment intended to weaken any intruder.
you should've let me, sir. - No, Harry.
your blood's much more precious than mine.
Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place.
he will have put certain defenses in position.
careful.
there it is.
the only question is, how do we get there?
if you would, Harry.
do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Oh, yes.
it has to be drunk.
all of it has to be drunk.
you remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?
this potion might paralyze me.
might make me forget why I'm here.
might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.
you are not to indulge these requests.
it's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.
even if you have to force it down my throat.
understood? - Why can't I drink it, sir?
because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.
your good health, Harry.
professor.
professor!
Harry.
professor, can you hear me?
professor.
no. Don't.
you have to keep drinking, like you said. Remember?
stop. - It will stop. It will stop...
...but only if you keep drinking. - Please, don't make me.
I'm sorry, sir. - Please.
kill me. Kill me! - No!
it's my fault.
it's all my fault.
it's my fault.
just one more, sir. One more, and then I promise...
...I promise I'll do what you say.
I promise. - No.
please.
Harry.
water.
water.
water.
you did it, sir.
look.
Harry.
water.
Aguamenti.
water.
Lumos.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Sectumsempra!
Harry.
Stupefy! - Harry.
Harry.
partis Temporus!
go to your houses. No dawdling.
we need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.
no.
Severus. Severus is who I need.
wake him. Tell him what happened.
speak to no one else.
Severus, Harry.
hide yourself below, Harry.
don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission.
whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below.
Harry, do as I say.
trust me.
trust me.
good evening, Draco.
what brings you here on this fine spring evening?
who else is here? I heard you talking.
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.
have you been whispering to yourself, Draco?
Draco...
...you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am?
I've done things that would shock you.
like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?
replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?
forgive me, Draco.
I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak...
...your heart can't really have been in them.
he trusts me. I was chosen.
then I shall make it easy for you.
Expelliarmus!
very good. Very good.
you're not alone.
there are others.
how?
the vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
I've been mending it. - Let me guess.
it has a sister. A twin.
in Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage.
ingenious.
Draco...
...years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices.
please let me help you. - I don't want your help!
don't you understand? I have to do this.
I have to kill you.
or he's gonna kill me.
well, look what we have here.
well done, Draco.
good evening, Bellatrix.
I think introductions are in order, don't you?
love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.
do it.
he doesn't have the stomach, just like his father.
let me finish him in my own way.
No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it.
this is your moment. Do it.
go on, Draco.
now!
no.
Severus.
please.
Avada Kedavra.
Hagrid! Hello?
Snape! He trusted you!
go on.
Incarcerous.
fight back! You coward, fight back!
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.
Sectumsempra!
you dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
Yes.
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
Potter...
...in light of what has happened...
...if you should have the need to talk to someone...
you should know, Professor Dumbledore...
...you meant a great deal to him.
do you think he would've done it?
Draco?
no.
no, he was lowering his wand.
in the end, it was Snape.
it was always Snape.
and I did nothing.
it's fake.
open it.
to the Dark Lord： I know I will be dead long before you read this........
...but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match...
...you will be mortal once more.
don't know.
but whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.
which means it was all a waste.
all of it.
Ron's okay with it, you know.
you and Ginny.
but if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
I'm not coming back, Hermione.
I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started.
and I don't know where that'll lead me...
...but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can.
I've always admired your courage, Harry.
but sometimes, you can be really thick.
you don't really think you're going to be able...
...to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?
you need us, Harry.
I never realized how beautiful this place was.
Eve's temptation
bitch!
angel
Hey! Over here!
why did you turn off your cell phone?
it doesn't look like Captain is not going to let it go this time.
the time of death?
between midnight and one o'clock.
who found him? - His wife.
when she came home, he was found dead, around 4 a. m.
she came home around 4 a. M? - Yes.
interesting.
anyway, sergeant is very angry, so please go. Hurry.
don't tell him that you drank.
this way.
a plastic Surgeon. - The victim?
no, the wife.
she is beautiful, smart, and makes lots of money.
it's too bad to leave behind a wife like her.
maybe he died because of that.
what instrument was used for the crime?
maybe a fruit knife.
about this big.
get the finger prints.
what?
most people who get stabbed at home usually get stabbed by a knife in the house. Don't you know?
what was the exact cause of death?
we have to do an autopsy, but his carotid artery was slashed.
it looks like he bled to death.
you bastard! Are you the sergeant?
if you are going to turn off your cell phone, why do you carry it?
what is the wife's alibi?
Yeah, I am your subordinate.
you stink with alcohol!
should I leave then?
bastard...
between 8 p. M last night and 3 a. m. This morning, she was with her lover.
check it out.
she plays all night with her lover, and thanks to the husband he was found dead...
where is she?
she went to work.
she went to work?
she said, "What's his death got to do with me?" And then she left.
I was stunned too. I didn't know what to say.
man! I wonder if my wife would do the same.
it's scary.
Jung Hee-rah...
that's her name, uh?
you didn't even know her name?
do I have to know?
she came alone. All I did was being her partner, because that's my job.
she asked me to call her Angel. So I didn't ask her name.
a plastic Surgeon. I like that.
you didn't know her name, her age, and herjob?
what did you do on that day then?
she was a customer. I worked. That's my job.
do I have to explain it? You know how it works. All you need is an instinct.
so you burned your Romeo's instinct?
what time did you meet her? And until what time were you together?
around 8?
it's a bit early for a host bar. Anyway, we drank, had sex, and we parted around 3 a. m.
are you sure?
we just enjoyed the night. It was work.
that's all.
it doesn't look like he is lying.
they don't seem to have any other connections besides that club.
she's smart, but there has got to be a blind spot.
you think she...
do you have the result for that fingerprints?
Yes, there were no fingerprints.
that's the murder weapon then.
what?
my friend... Someone cleaned it, and put it back.
otherwise, there should be fingerprints, at least of the housekeeper.
should we start?
your husband is dead, but not much has changed for you, uh?
something wrong with that?
no. I got Park Tae-seop's autopsy report.
the cause of death was excessive bleeding due to the cut on his carotid artery.
as I expected it.
as an expert?
what then?
did you also expect us to find barium in his blood?
he suffered from insomnia. He took some sleeping pills.
the wife doesn't come home until late at night, and he took sleeping pills?
it doesn't make sense.
sense. Common sense... can make one relax, but it can be a scary thing. It can also constrict a person.
we didn't have a great relationship.
I see.
anyway. Park Tae-seop was sleeping with some sleeping pills.
the cut on his carotid artery was clean.
we couldn't find any trace in the kitchen that someone searched for a knife.
someone knew exactly where the knife was, and went upstairs with it.
what exactly are you trying to say?
what I'm trying to say is, there was a set of seven knives, and it's amazing to me that someone grabbed the shortest.
it's as if one knew that Park Tae-seop was sleeping with some sleeping pills.
one intended to murder an adult, but someone went upstairs with the smallest knife.
what I'm trying to say is, the one probably knows
park Tae-seop's habits very well.
for example?
you know what I mean.
detective, I was somewhere else when my husband died.
and, I have someone who can prove that.
you probably met him already.
Yes, I did, a stud host.
a one night stand?
then you know that even if I wanted to kill him,
I could not have done it.
why don't you look for someone who fits in that condition?
you are wasting your time here.
maybe I'm wasting my time. Maybe this is a shortcut.
maybe there is something I haven't seen in your alibi that's protecting you.
interesting. Look for it then.
Yeah. I will.
send in a patient.
I don't have anything more to say. Goodbye.
we'll see often.
I look forward.
Oh, detective Kang,
your hand is warmer that I thought.
in my common sense, people like you have cold hands.
I really look forward.
common sense... can make one relax, but it can be a scary thing. It can also constrict a person.
thank you for the coffee.
Yeah. What is it?
what?
what?
you caught having an affair. What should we do now?
shouldn't you cuff me?
put your clothes on, go home. - Shut up!
you have no right to tell me.
what to do.
let's finish it then.
finish?
do we still have something to finish between us?
how did you know?
Oh, it was easy. I surfed the internet.
your hospital is pretty well known, uh?
what do you want?
a police came by, and asked me some questions.
I made sure that we were together on that night.
so don't worry,
I don't.
you came all the way just to tell me that?
I'm Gon-woo. I probably need me.
I knew you were not Romeo.
so, you were with me on that night, because you needed an alibi?
I wanted to be with a stud, but it didn't matter.
I just wanted to be with a man.
I just needed someone to be with me on that day.
I want to continue to meet you.
I don't.
why not? No one can say anything now?
your husband is dead.
there is no reason for me to meet you.
I love you.
you were happy on that day.
sex was not bad. Actually, it was pretty good.
but, I'm not your cheap Juliet.
I'm not your lottery ticket either.
I'll see you in the court.
don't expect me to change my mind.
you will never change.
I don't want to be an invisible person to you anymore.
what was their relationship like?
it looked alright outside, but inside was rotted as it could be.
Mr. Kim, I'm sorry.
no, it's my job. I'm leaving.
isn't my wife pretty?
of course. There aren't that many like her.
Really?
you wanna grab her tits?
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
you dirty whore!
what's wrong with grabbing dirty whore's tits?
what's so wrong about that?
it was too much. I don't know why, but whenever he got drunk, he treated her like a dirt.
well, even when he was sober, he was never nice to her.
and whenever something like that happened, the next day she had bruise marks all over her body.
the driver said your husband was very rude to you.
what was the reason?
police officers go after one's private life these days?
well, not really.
but, we have to, if we must. It's part of the job.
then, you do that your own.
if I tell you everything myself, there is nothing for you to do.
it looks like you are trying to find my motive to kill my husband.
you may find quite a few motives.
it all depends how hard you try.
but, shouldn't you try to find the really killer rather than my motives to kill him?
of course. I will try harder to find find the killer.
someone is showing an interest in me...
whatever the reason, it can be ecstatic...
especially when it's from a tough-looking detective Kang.
I didn't think you were going to call.
maybe it won't be so bad to enjoy a little more.
Why? You don't want to? - Of course, I want it.
I don't meet a same girl twice. I don't know what it is, but I couldn't stop thinking about you.
pretty and a plastic surgeon I have nothing to lose.
one thing, I decide the time.
I guess police officers are not busy these days.
or do you have other interest in me?
Oh, yes. Going after one's personal life.
in a way, it was ecstatic.
so, how did it feel to peep?
was it good?
how did it feel to peep?
was it good?
Hello? Yes.
what?
Yes.
OK.
I'll be right there.
who is this?
you know who sent this card, right?
just... pretend that you don't about this.
it's nothing. It's probably nothing.
let me check to house first. Stay here.
please stay with me a little longer.
let me call the police first then.
do you have to report to the police?
don't you want to catch the killer?
I just need to make sure that no one is here.
that's all.
if you leave it like this, I cannot guarantee that it won't happen again.
I'll make sure that I lock all the doors.
I'll call a security company first thing in the morning.
please take me to a hotel.
detective Kang,
how about a place safer than a hotel?
safer?
I don't feel safe at a hotel.
the safest place would be a cell in a police station...
if want a clean and comfort place, you can leave.
I can take you to a hotel.
no, this is better than I thought.
better than you thought?
what I mean is, better than a cell in a police station.
this place is probably safe.
I had no choice, so just use it even if you are not comfortable.
you can use my bed, and there is no place to take a shower.
thank you so much for today.
it's alright. Get some rest.
I'm going to get some sleep too.
you are probably surprised that a cold-hearted-husband killer is act this way for such a small thing, uh?
I apologize for what happened earlier.
I am not good at following someone.
I was irritated because I was being followed, but
I'm getting a help because of that.
thank you. - I'm just protecting you as a witness and a strong suspect.
get some rest.
I'm sorry.
what did I do wrong? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
thank you. I have not slept so well in a long time.
the paper work is all finished.
have a good life.
are you going to end it like this?
it's not too late.
there is this great restaurant. Why don't you take your wife there, and have a dinner?
Hey! Just give me the report, alright?
his name is Lee Dong-gu.
he served the time for sexual assault, and murder.
he sexually assaulted his step-daughter and murdered his wife. He served 19 years, and was released 3 months ago.
what a sick bastard!
don't you think? Hey?
Hello? Inspector Kim Jeong-geon, right?
Yes, this is Kangnam's police station.
I need to know where Lee Dong-gu is. He was released three months ago.
Yes.
disappeared?
Yeah, did you find anything?
it's Jung Hee-rah.
what about Jung Hee-rah?
Jung Hee-rah is the step-daughter Lee Dong-gu raped.
what?
after that incident, she was no longer his step-daughter.
good Work. I'll see you tomorrow.
what happened?
I heard a strange noise, and...
was is Lee Dong-gu?
you know who he is.
he always called me an angel.
no, he raped an angel.
he not only raped you, he murdered your mother.
stop!
right after my husband died, I received a phone call.
he said he would protect me.
I wanted to forget his voice, but I couldn't forget his voice.
after that day, I did not answer any phone calls.
I thought he would give up if I ignored him.
I was wrong.
he was by my mother, and always watched me.
I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
don't answer.
my sweet angel.
I'll be there soon to see you. - It's him...
wait. - He came back again.
just wait a little.
my angel.
do you have to do this?
just until I find a new place.
until then, I think this is the safest place.
don't worry. I will pay you more than enough for rent.
are you seducing me?
Why? Do you want to be seduced?
drink.
he is not going to give up.
he knows that I'm alive.
this sick game of hide-and-seek is going to continue until either I die or he dies.
I'm going to catch him. Everything will come to a light then.
do you still doubt me?
for now, there is another strong suspect.
I'm sorry.
no.
it's natural from your perspective. It's natural.
my husband was the same.
your husband? - Yes.
he really loved me.
but, he changed when he found out about my past.
but, that was natural from his perspective.
I'm sorry.
Yes, please take care of it as soon as possible.
both the hospital and the house.
Yes, thank you.
it's been a long time.
do not call me anymore.
you must be kidding?
I decide, and you just do it, Romeo.
we had fun together.
why all of sudden?
we didn't have a reason to start. Do we need to a reason to end it?
Romeo, you are a cup of cold coffee to me.
my dignity won't allow me to drink it.
thanks anyway. You were a more comfort than I thought.
you had fun, and now you are pushing me away?
that's not going to happen.
as I expected, your lid is too thin to hid your stinky smell.
how did you become a doctor with your brain?
you can't treat me like this.
your alibi of day your husband died, what's going to happen if I change my story?
how are you going to change it?
I was with you for seven hours...
what if I say I was asleep for at least two hour?
I heard it takes about 30 minutes from the hotel to your place.
you are going to regret that you ignored me like this.
were you beside me for those two hours?
I wouldn't know because I was sleeping beside you.
who's going to prove it? No one can.
whatever. You do whatever you want.
if you don't have anything more to say, get out.
you are going to regret this.
make me regret it.
park Tae-seop's murder! Lee Dong-gu's whereabouts!
I've sent out arrest flyers to every police station in the country.
we are going to receive some calls very soon.
sending out flyers is not good enough! We need results. Results!
don'tjust sit here. Go out and bring in the killer!
man! I don't like it!
he is very negative today. Very negative today.
it's very frustrating.
we couldn't trace the call made to Jung Hee-rah.
we can locate him even if his cell phone is turned on.
he is smarter than I thought.
he was in prison for 19 years. How does he know all these new tricks?
no wonder they call a prison, a school.
wow, she was very pretty when she was young too.
he rapes his step-daughter, comes back and murders her husband.
horrible. Horrible.
the dinner is ready.
enjoy your meal
how are things going with the hospital?
I think I can sell it at a good price.
you can just close it for a few weeks.
I thought about relocating it anyway.
thank you for your cooperation with the investigation.
as you advised, I'm not going to run anymore.
I'm going to stand strong and fight.
you will help me, right?
of course.
my mother lost her mind after she heard about what happened to me.
she felt guilty that she couldn't protect me.
he treated my mom like a dirt, and me too, who was watching all this.
he beat her to death in front of me.
he went to a prison.
I wanted to hide, so he would never find me.
so I left Daejeon, and came to Seoul.
I worked and studied like there were 48 hours in a day.
I went to a medical school, met my husband, and got married, but I was not happy.
you will. You must.
how about you? Tell me about you.
I got divorced not too long ago.
it must've been painful.
try to stay on the line as long as you can, so we can trace the call.
Hello?
my lovely angel.
dad! - Do not trust the man beside you.
think about your unhappy marriage.
I'm the only one who can make you happy.
dad.
when are you going to learn? - Dad.
let's meet. Let's meet and talk.
Hello?
he hung up.
he is near.
he is watching us.
special Unit Team 1, 2, 3
Hey! We've located Lee Dong-gu.
where?
detective Park! Get ready! Let's go! Hurry!
check. - Yes, sir.
it looks like he got away.
no, he wants our attention.
I'm fine. Don't take it too seriously.
it's too dangerous.
if he gives me up, he is going to look for someone else.
one is enough for that kind of nightmare.
we have to stop him. We can stop him.
it's too dangerous for you.
thank you for worrying for me.
the situation indicates that Lee Dong-gu tipped us off.
why did he tell us his location?
if he wants to get catch, he should just turn himself in.
I don't know. I have no idea.
I wondered who the next toy was.
it's that police officer.
she dumped me exactly a week later.
how long do you think you will last? One month? Two months?
what are you talking about?
a police officer who shacks up with a murder suspect...
if you report this, how much do I get for a reward?
watch what you say.
she's no longer a suspect.
you proved her alibi, you bastard.
are you saying they were all lies? Uh?
don't you think she is attractive enough to lie for?
what do you think you would've done?
get lost, you bastard!
I needed to take a bath.
ask me.
you want to ask me some questions.
lee Gun-woo, he was waiting for me.
yeah? What did he say?
he said he lied.
your alibi was a lie.
do you believe him?
is it true?
no.
alright then.
lee Dong-gu tipped us off his place.
why did he do that?
I don't know.
you don't know, uh?
I'll trust you for now.
fuck! You don't know who you are dealing with.
what are you talking about?
there is this rich bitch.
you got dumped?
be gentle! It hurts!
shut up, you bitch!
fucking bitch! Sucks up all my juice and spits me out.
I'm not that easy.
I said be gentle!
OK. Here we go!
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
no, It was good. I enjoyed it also...
was it good?
Really?
of course, we'll see again.
what is it?
Hello? It's me.
what?
Yes. Where? Ok. Ok.
what is it?
lee Gun-woo is dead. An alley behind his apartment.
be careful.
a guard heard a noise, so he came out and found him dying.
he was dead before the ambulance got here.
Hello?
I'm on my way to meet my father.
what? Are you out of your mind?
No! That's too dangerous!
Hello? Hel...
the phone is turned off. After the beep,
you came back.
the phone is turned off. After the beep,
lee Dong-gu!
it's all over. Give up.
don't come.
we can be happy.
OK. I got it.
put it down, and let's talk. Do it!
is it him? I just have to kill him?
I just have to kill him.
I... I can end all this.
stop!
I can end all this.
don't come. Don't come.
where are we going?
there is this great restaurant my friend told me about.
I look forward.
I just trusted my friend. How was it?
it was delicious.
I can't remember the last I enjoyed a good meal like this.
let's have more time like this.
OK... and thank you.
don't say that.
only good things will happen from now on.
Yeah. Only good things will happen from now on.
let's cheer.
bill please. - Yes.
your wife gets prettier and prettier.
what?
she looks prettier than the last time she came with her father.
with her father?
they looked very good. I thought to myself that they had a great father-daughter relationship.
park Tae-seop's murder case is over now.
your shooting incident was self-defense too.
Congratulations!
Yeah, thanks.
is it him? I just have to kill him?
I can end all this.
you don't know.
detective Kim
is Lee Dong-gu's place sealed off?
Yes.
Oh, her.
I saw her. She visited time to time.
are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
I thought she was small and unique, so I remember her.
Oh, here it is. Six months before he was released, a lady visited him once a month.
why are you lying on the floor?
your clothes are getting dirty.
you are conscious, but you can't move?
what is this? What did you do?
what do you mean? No strength in your body?
don't worry. You are just anesthetized.
it was so simple. If I just put some anesthetics here, it paralyzes your muscles.
it made my job easier, because everyone helped themselves.
well, it took sometime to train.
I know what you did.
you used Lee Dong-gu to
kill Park Tae-seop and Lee Gun-woo.
and you used me to kill Lee Dong-gu, right?
so smart.
finding it out was your mistake.
if you cooled down your curiosity a little, our honeymoon would not have ended this quick.
too bad.
you played me.
what are you going to do now?
it's no fun if I tell you ahead.
we have some time. Do you want to have some fun?
how does it feel?
you can move, but you can feel.
your nerves are very sensitive, no?
don'tjust breathe hard. Feel it, detective Kang.
stop it.
Why? It was good, wasn't it?
you are just like them too. Aren't you?
right on time.
love makes a person a fool.
stupid enough to lose one's life.
why her? What's it got to do with her?
she divorced you, but
I don't think she cut off all of her love, uh?
you are so evil.
everything was planned out from the beginning.
you just figured that out now?
you should have doubted me a little more.
or you should've totally trusted me.
but, you found out everything.
since you found out everything, I had no choice.
you are going to pay for this.
yeah? Will that be possible?
you will come out of the anesthetic after three hours.
that's more than enough for me to get rid of all the traces here.
and with the right angle,
maybe about this angle?
a misfortunate detective Kang, he shoots his divorced wife, and kills himself too.
isn't that cool?
don't feel so bad.
I'm not doing this because I hate you. I'm doing this so I can live.
for a short period,
I had feelings you.
Eve's Temptation
this is my wife.
pretty, isn't she?
she always takes shower first because she doesn't want to be seen unkempt.
and then she prepares my breakfast.
she is a great wife.

Mr. Kim
Sangho?
you've go to replace this every three hours.
otherwise it will overflow.
Oh no, what happened?
hit and run.
the lower half is disabled.
caught the runner?
no.
they're not every trying.
I'm sorry. I've never thought this would happen.
I didn't tell you. You weren't supposed to know.
how about the movie?
well, just working on the scenario for now.
you must be not so tight then.
no... not really.
don't eat that.
it's pretty old.
don't eat that, either.
just drink some water if want anything.
tap water is fine here. It's groundwater.
you got married?
pretty, isn't she?
Yes.
she's pretty.
isn't it awkward that I married a woman like this?
huh?
you're good looking, too.
nice sense of humor, Cho.
well I wanted to see you because I have a favor for you.
a favor? What is it?
see if my wife has any dirt.
I think she's seeing someone.
you want me to investigate her?
why me...
you've done this for the movie, huh?
and you know the people.
it is different from this.
three milllion.
another two million once the job is done.
this is not about the money.
I can't trust anyone now.
all you have to do is to take pictures of whoever she's with.
your wife... cheating on you?
what do you think?
thank you. Come again.
where should I put this?
let's put that outside.
sorry I'm late.
I was shopping and I didn't know the time was flying by.
they opened a new outlet mall at the corner of the cross section.
I shopped a bit. They were on sale.
this looks good on you.
and these are shirts.
three different colors.
let's put some color on you, yeah?
and this is mine. Do you like it?
should I try this on?
Oh, I'm sorry. You must be hungry now. It'll be just a minute.
why do you love me?
because I love you.
even after this?
I feel bad about it. But we didn't love just for sex.
I can do the money making.
we can't negotiate any further...
I come here at least once a month.
can you bring it down a little bit?
today is... it is indeed true, huh?
all right. But just today.
do you need it delivered? - It's okay.
I drove here today.
I can just take it with me.
well, the day we met, it wasn't coincidence, right?
you were there first because you read Sangho's mail, right?
a little bit.
then you must know what he asked for.
what are you going to do?
what do you think I'm going to do?
I'd rather have not seen that mail.
after Sangho's accident,
he's not only physically, but also mentally ill.
it's better not to know.
isn't this whole thing a bit awkward from a woman who cares so much about her husband?
you're a movie producer and you don't get this?
it's been over a year since his accident.
it's not like I don't have lust.
and this is a simple date.
when time passes on, a date becomes...
a date is a date.
then what... I'm just a date, too?
I'm sorry but you're not even a date.
all right. I don't want to make this big.
I can totally understand you.
but...
I would like to do that again.
that day was so unexpected and...
so is this a deal?
well, it's rather...
you took the pictures, right?
let me see first.
let's go
where to?
to motel.
I don't like the smell of it.
Why? Are you hiding a woman at your place?
no... It's just my place is messy now.
huh! What are you doing here?
what am I doing here?
something's happening to me, now.
what is this?
do you know how much this is?
I think I found a wrong place.
no, I...
hold on. You can't just leave like that.
I lied in front of the woman.
no, you're misunderstood. I barely know her.
she has nothing to do with me. - See you.
no... wait...
nothing?
is that all you can say right now?
Yes, you're right.
we're no longer together.
then take off the jacket, too.
Hey, Serin
Hey!
hold on.
what do you think you're doing?
if you leave like this, I'm sending the pictures.
people might get some feelings if they worked together.
we once had drinks and slept together.
I know he likes me but
I can't draw any feelings on him.
I feel sorry but there's nothing I can do about it.
you understand, right?
why don't you get divorced?
you haven't been married, huh?
no.
do you know how many couples are living without sex?
they have just got to do what they've got to do.
there are couples who love each other and care for each other. There are more couples like that.
and cheat on their wives once in a while, like you?
listen...
if what you said is cheating,
can't you do it with me?
if one must ask...
he does it better.
but I do my best, you know? Sincerely.
if you're sincere, that's not cheating.
I've got to go. It's late.
I'll walk you over there.
no, I can take a cab.
I miss the times he and I used to hunt for girls.
and drink Dong-Dong wine by the valley.
it was a long time ago.
Oh, your wife.
I've been after her for a month now
I don't think she's seeing anyone.
Hey, I can drink this in the fridge, right?
don't
you watched her every day?
every single day?
well, yeah, almost.
how about three days ago?
Friday? Friday as well.
working at the flower shop and doing some shopping.
that's how it was.
I... think you are a bit over sensitive.
she really cares about you though.
so don't think it's too suspicious and try to be thankful.
how do you know she really cares about me?
the way she's shopping for your stuff.
and your wheel chair and everything...
I got the feeling she does.
you fucked her, too.
what?
yes you did.
you fucked her，too.
right?
what... why would I?
what do you think I am?
tell me, did you or didn't you?
what's the matter with you?
I'm right, right?
you don't know me? Who am I?
I'm Kim Sangho.
now look at my eyes.
did you or didn't you?
if you didn't, tell me you didn't, huh?
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
it was a mistake.
don't you lie, a mistake?
you son of a bitch - Sangho?
little piece of shit! Come here - Sangho?
you little cock - Sangho, I'm sorry.
I am terribly sorry, I'm sorry. - Son of a bitch, let go!
cock sucker, let go!
why are you doing this?
it's been over a year since your accident.
who would easily go through this?
she is a normal human being.
couldn't you allow a little mistake?
fuck!
when she was sleeping with me, she was really worried about you.
so you shouldn't do this, right?
do you know what she is?
what?
a woman kind enough trying to live with a handicapped man.
how is she?
she's trying to kill me.
what?
insurance money.
she's trying to kill me for the money.
what are you talking about?
do you think this is all coincidence?
do you know why I don't even go near the food?
do you know what it feels like to be terrified of death everyday you son of a bitch?
no way...
Yes!
isn't this what your fucking movie was about?
wasn't it about the wife trying to kill her husband for estate?
Sangho?
that's a movie.
wasn't it based on true story though.
do you know how your senses develop once your disabled?
you feel everything.
what your wife is thinking about...
why she won't divorce me...
she sees me as insurance money.
she's just trying to find the right time.
I know you're going through hard time but this way is too much.
drink that.
if you're so confident then drink that thing over there.
orange juice is just perfect for poison mix.
the sour taste to it makes other tastes go away.
Sangho?
I'm sorry but you're crazy.
like she said it's not only your legs that are disabled.
but also your mind, as well.
I'm sorry I really tried to keep it.
I don't know how I ended up telling everything.
you should have been more firm. How could you tell something like that?
what should I do?
what do you think we should do. You spoke already.
you didn't tell anything else, right?
no.
no but...
I think he's really crazy. He thinks you're trying to kill him for the insurance money and kicking my ass and... fuck
how can you live with someone like that, huh? Just get divorced, yeah?
he wants it and you...
what do you know.
what do you know about love and marriage?
a jerk like you trying to get laid for one night...
how could you possibly know what love is.
fucking idiot.
just eat that.
eat.
I'm sorry about the last one with the detergent.
it was a simple mistake. So just eat it.
you won't die.
eat!
eat! Eat!
what the hell are you doing!
why Inae? Why?
you think I'm trying to kill you?
Inae! - For that little junk of money?
don't do this!
all right. - Untie this!
Inae! Don't do this.
Inae! Untie this thing!
Inae!
why are you doing this! Inae!
so we can just die together, right?
then I won't get the insurance money, either.
inae.
don't do this.
let's die together.
I'm better dead than being accused of something like that.
I'm sorry...
lift.
here, too.
wash me, too.
I'm sorry.
what?
about cheating on you.
I won't do it again.
so don't you get into any weird ideas.
all right?
all right.
you won't be satisfied but you can satisfy me.
is he here?
I was just in the neighborhood and felt kindda hungry so I stepped in.
you have food, right?
open the fridge. There should be a ready-to-eat rice.
I knew this.
Hey!
what are you doing? Let's just eat.
hold on. One must eat well to do things well.
I was misunderstood. I believe things can happen, Kim Sangho
someone might think we're a couple or something.
no one might.
can't you be nice?
am I uglier than Sangho?
he's better looking for sure.
then what...
what are you talking about?
he's broke now.
he won't get to make this movie, either.
and disabled.
are you jealous?
I'm not. I just don't understand.
a disabled man without money...
that is love.
a dearly love without any conditions.
that can't be.
so what?
I mean I just don't get it.
what are you doing now?
you're obviously jealous of him.
so I hate that you're here right now.
I'm leaving. Let's try not to see each other again.
hey Serin. What have I done?
asshole.
hello.
it's me. Kim Sangho.
just woke up?
Yes.
what are you doing tomorrow evening?
tomorrow?
Yes.
what I'm trying to say is...
I drank like a monkey last night and... I'm having a bad hangover.
did I make a mistake?
a mistake?
are you talking about the pictures?
it's okay. It's been a while since I was messed up like this.
it doesn't make any difference even if I had few more.
I think I'm crazy.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
when I look back... I think I'm sorry.
come for dinner tomorrow.
I've got to pay you the rest and... - What rest...
and she will be there so...
she's going somewhere tomorrow.
let's have a drink and talk.
all right?
okay.
nice weather, huh?
Yeah.
you want to ride in the wheel chair?
me?
hop on that thing.
this is hard.
how do you ride this all the time?
can I drink this now?
Yeah, whatever you want. You won't die.
so what's the movie you're doing this time?
it's Moonlight of Seoul. Sort of crime movie.
you always write thriller dark? Also?
no, It's much brighter this time.
sweet Hometown was very dark.
I blame you for not marketing it well.
a runaway producer...
Hey, a shit movie doesn't become a hit under a good marketing.
anyhow, it couldn't hurt to do some decent marketing and get as many box offices.
don't you think?
you said you were going to make a fun movie.
then you came up with a shit hole.
the scenario was supposed to be fun...
had we shoot accordingly, it couldn't have been that shitty.
you're weird.
you changed the ending, too.
what was it...
everything was supposed to be her plan.
right.
then...
why are you bringing up the stuff that's been three years already...
no, go ahead.
that three years have changed my life.
tell me how you changed it.
tell me.
I said tell me?
In-ae.
seo Inae.
sa... Sangho?
what's the matter?
don't worry about it.
if she answers right, you won't die.
who... who do you think is dying!
Sangho!
don't mess around.
my arms... it hurts.
I need blood in my arms...
why are you doing this?
but remember this one thing.
I'd been thinking over and over before I called you.
but you've done some enough shit to me, too. So...
even if things went wrong, I wouldn't feel so guilty about it.
fuck... I said I'm sorry.
no... You don't need to be sorry.
I rather want to thank you.
I met that bitch three years ago.
she's pretty, as you know already.
I was meant to be drawn to her.
I knew it was second marriage for her, but I didn't care.
ex-husband died from accident.
then she became rich with the insurance money...
I couldn't be more thankful.
I was like... a homeless at the moment.
you blew all my money doing that art thing.
all the money I earned from the clothing business.
this house? It's almost on her.
it's under her name.
I liked it at the beginning.
but then I got into an accident, all of sudden.
when I woke up,
I saw her face.
the husband she expected to die suddenly woke up.
and her face was just wrong.
then I realized...
her ex's death was not a fortune.
her money was not a fortune, either.
then you know what?
do you know how that guy died?
he got into car accident, and fell off stares riding in a wheel chair.
broke his neck...
isn't this interesting?
this is just like your movie.
Sangho!
it was an accident.
you woke up?
just hang in there.
it was an accident.
I bet you're not that precise then.
it always took you two events to kill.
please don't do this.
you know I love you.
it's not that you love me...
it's the insurance money you love.
what the hell are you doing? Don't do this!
don't you remember?
it was part of your scenario.
when you inject certain amount of air into vein, platelet inside the vein combines with the air and blocks the vein, causing death from pulmonary embolism.
Hypoxia... in other words dyspnoea.
right?
I still remember this. Hey, I've got some memory, huh?
but I don't remember how much.
was it 100cc or 200cc?
50cc could kill!
I think it was 200cc.
No!
you're weird!
shut it off!
Hey! Don't over react.
you wrote this would kill without any pain, dude.
no research?
why are you doing this dickhead!
what the hell do you want, huh?
what do you want?
her confession.
then I'll call the cops and you can be the witness.
then everything will be over.
she tried to kill me for the money. That's all you need to say.
I'm not the one dealing with the insurance over here.
that's right, you didn't say you wanted the insurance.
you just slowly talked me into it.
think about it.
if you're killed, I would be the first one on the list.
why would I do that? Wake up!
let me tell you about that bitch.
she suddenly changed a year or so after the marriage.
she neither cooks or does laundry. She goes out all the time.
well, she didn't need to care about someone who'd be dead pretty soon.
do you know why I did that!
why did you do that, ma'am?
you cheated on me.
what are you talking about? I've never cheated on you.
you never slept with that slut at the bar?
that's not cheating.
if it isn't, then what is it?
is that why you rushed your plan...
I'm saying no!
can you say that looking at this picture?
this pictures are from you.
this guy, he's the one that hit me and ran.
how the hell is this guy!
meeting with you?
you probably think I don't know shit.
when I first woke up at the hospital, I couldn't remember anything.
but as time went on, I was able to start picturing the faces.
I don't know! I don't know this guy!
how can you not know! This is the guy you were with!
I saw everything. I saw everything.
tell me.
that you wanted me dead because of the insurance money.
I've never wanted that!
fuck you! Say it!
this could really kill.
there's no insurance.
there's no single penny paid to me even if you died.
I canceled the insurance today.
I didn't want to get accused by you so I canceled it.
is there anything that you do right...
confirm it.
you can call them and ask.
you want to hang in until the morning?
for the old time sake I'll postponed it till 8: 00 in the morning.
if I find out you lied, I won't stand still.
give me a cigarette.
are you sure?
you canceled the insurance?
if not, we are really dead, really.
what?
you lied? Mother fucking...
stop!
I'm going to kill you!
honey! - Stop!
honey stop! Stop!
stop it!
stop!
let it go! You two are both garbage.
fucking vampires living off my blood!
I'm never going to die! Say you wanted me dead!
it's really not true. - Yes it is!
I said no!
don't say no!
you said it? You said it!
say you made me this, huh?
say it!
then, I won't kill you at least.
say it.
say it!
please say it.
you did this, huh? You made me what I am.
please tell me.
you did it, huh? Honey!
I'm right, huh?
I'm sorry honey.
I made you like this.
right...
let's end this.
No!
don't!
asshole, I said don't!
what's the matter with you?
Sangho!
Sangho!
it tool a long time to explain the case to the police.
seo Inae was also investigated.
but no where under any insurance company in Korea could we find the name Kim Sangho.
what Seo Inae said about canceling the insurance was not a lie.
seo Inae was pleaded not guilty.
and we suffered for months from the incident.
then we started love each other.
and promised to ourselves we'll never let it go.
and few months later,
we got married.
we couldn't be happier.
but there was still one thing left that I could not understand.
when she said she was sorry to Sangho,
I really felt it was sincere.
if that was acting,
no. It was not acting.
then what was she sorry for anyways?
soon the question was answered.
my wife...
she didn't do it for the money.
she simply didn't want to share her loving husband with someone else.
that was why.
soon after we got married, I too made a mistake.
and I became this.
but it's okay.
my wife did this because she truly loved me.
I love my wife, too.
please enjoy the music while your party is reached.
Hello? - So what do you think?
about what? - About tomorrow.
lt's our first day of high school.
lf we want to be popular, we just have to be proactive.
calm your proactive ass down.
saying you want to be popular guarantees it isn't gonna happen.
I'm gonna get a girlfriend. You think that's possible?
anything's possible, Wade.
just don't be needy.
you got to let it come to you. And one more thing.
from now on, I don't want you calling me Ryan.
call me T-Dog.
T-Dog? - Yep.
what does the "T" stand for? -I don't know.
but it sounds better than R-Dog. - Yeah.
you know, like, if a hot girl went up to you, and she goes, "Hey, have you met T-Dog? Man, did you see what T-Dog did today?
man, that T-Dog is crazy!
that sounds like a guy every woman would want to know.
Hey, do I need a nickname? - You have one. Skeletor.
that was last year. I look good now. I'm filling out.
all right, name one part of your body that filled out, Wade.
name one part of your body that isn't filled out, huh?
I'm not trying to offend you.
l'm just saying you shot up too fast and you're freakishly skinny.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're too fat and that's equally unattractive.
you wanna go there? - I'm sorry.
it's just, I want things to go well, you know?
sorry I said you're freakishly skinny. - It's okay.
you just are.
Hey, go to sleep! It's 3: 00 in the morning!
what are you, crazy? - Sorry.
is that your stepdad? - No one.
give me that phone! Give it! - It's...

it's like a nerd paradise.
time to make the donuts.
Hoo-rah!
Touchdown!
we won! We won the game! And Wade loses again!

he's not my dad. He's your dad.
fine, the guy who does your mom says get up.
just leave! - Loser!
morning, sunshine. First day of school.
mom! - Oh, my God!
since when did you start sleeping naked?
I'm in high school now, don't you remember?
I don't like elastic squeezing on my ass when I sleep!
okay.
Hey! What are you doing in this shower?
dawn? Rachel, that's right. Nice to see you.
put your hands up. Put your hands up. l'm the best white rapper you've ever seen.

Oh, my God! - Look at that.

Yeah. - Yeah.

I am! - I am!

magic is stupid.
no, no, honey.
mom! - What?
you forgot the sausages!
I'll get the sausages. - Come on. I'm hungry.
all right, I'll get the sausages.
excuse me, listen, I'm really sorry to bother you.
my family and I, we just ran out of gas and we're trying to get to the kids to SeaWorld.
and, I, like an idiot forgot my wallet. If I can just...
your Iegs work okay? - Yeah, why?
you should walk somewhere and get a job.
Harold... - I'll take care of it.
that's what I have, a job.
we'll get to SeaWorld one way or the other.
we're on our way to church. Maybe that's where you ought to go.
thank you. Have a great day.
can you help out a veteran? - Not today.
get away from the car. -Honey, roll up the window.

what's your name? - Drillbit.
listen, Drillbit, I wasn't born yesterday.
I don't want you using this on any marijuana or rye whiskey, okay?
you got my word on it. - You know what?
I'm gonna write "not for pot" on there. - You don't have to write.
Yeah. "Not for pot."

people decide what they think about you in the first five seconds.
so, Iet me smell your breath.
minty.

you dust the nuts? - No, Jim. I did not dust my nuts.
I'll never get tired of that one, Dad.

Enchante. - Hello.

I am in a rush now. But I hostess up at Moon Shadows on the one.
so if you get up there just, you know, ask for me. I'm Jessica.
Thanks, Jessica. - Yeah.
cause our chef, Louis, always makes too much chowder.
so he'll set you up with a nice plastic bowl of it out back.
you're late today. - Hey, get a job!
you get a job. - I already got one, giving money to you.
How're you doing, Mrs. Lampanelli? - All right.
you look beautiful today. - You're a liar. But it works for me.
go on, get out of here, you nut! - You earned it.
and don't spend it on food. Porn only!
first day of high school.
it's kind of scary. - Yeah, it sucks taking the bus.
sure, last year we were the oldest so we got to sit in the back of the bus, but now we'll probably have to sit in the front with the losers.
we'll be all right.
you have to have a proactive attitude if you wanna be popular in high school.
people decide what they think of you in the first five seconds.
I think you're a dork.
Oh, Wade.
Oh, no. - This is uncool.
we can't start high school like this.
you got to be shitting me. Come on.
please, am I dreaming here? - No.
we're never allowed to buy the same shirt again!
whoever sees it first gets to buy it.
you guys shouId wear red ribbons in your hair, too.
see? We both look like dorks. Go change.
No! I'm the one who was planning on wearing this.
Wade, I run the mile in 21 minutes!
how fast do you think I can go?
go! Hurry! - I'm going!
Wade, bus!
perfect! - Come on!
what a way to start high school, huh?
let me guess. Two-for-one sale at Hot Topic?
losers! - Dorks!
we're dead.
first day of our high school careers.
all right, Iet's light this fuse and see what happens.
let's go, man. - All right.
are you guys part of a bowling team?
last one.
Hey, at Ieast it'll be easy to find each other.
Yeah. I'll just Iook for the kid with the same shirt.
come on! - No, you have to spin it a few times first to get it to work.
thank you.
no, wait! Wait!
what are you guys doing? Guys! - Now, shut it. Move!
no, thanks. - Guys!
get out of the way! - Man!
here we go. - But that... That's not for me.
that's for my books! - Okay, here we go.
in there. - I am not a book!
get in there! - This is bad.
this isn't my locker! PIease! - No, this is good.
at least we know we're not the biggest dorks in schooI.
please, please, please! - Maybe we should say something.
it's survival of the fittest.
I've got to say something. I got to. I have to.
say something? It's hilarious. The kid fits in the locker. Come on.
that's not funny. - Somebody, heIp!
this is the dumbest thing I've ever done.
heIp! Please! - Stop!
I mean, you don't have to, but... - Harry Potter.
you need to keep your big mouth shut.
Yeah, that's what I've been trying to tell him.
Hey! - Run! Everybody run! It's not safe here!
Hey, check this out. Matching shirt geeks.
Oh, my God.
yo, Ron, these bitches really wanna wear the same shirt.
let's make them wear the same shirt, huh?
sounds good. Yeah.
the fat one here, the skinny one there, and just let go.
there.
you better keep that shit on, 'cause if I see you trying to take it off, you're dead.
and you know what happens if one of you dies? Both of you dies.
cause you're Siamese queers, bitches!
that's very cute.
you look like those Velcro monkeys who hug each other.
how was school, Wade?
we made so many friends, I can't even remember all their names.
great! You got to be in it to win it. - I am in it!
great.
Yeah!
Yeah. - So school went well, huh?
Oh, it was great. It couldn't have gone better.
it was the shirt, right? I'll have to get you more of those.
Hey! What are you doing? That's my stuff!
this is city property.
nobody's supposed to be camping out here.
your stuff's in the dumpster around the corner.
that's where I eat! You don't put a man's belongings where he eats!
my taxes pay for your salary. - You don't pay taxes.
you don't even have a job. - What else you wanna remind me of?
that I don't have good health care? That I don't belong to a good gym?
Where's the compassion? Protect and serve. That's what it says.
compassion? - Yeah, compassion.
you wanna know what I have compassion for?
the homeless who are mentally ill, the homeless who are drug-addicted.
buddy, you're just a jackass.
Oh, guy hits a little bit of bump in the road and he's a jackass?
maybe I shouId go smoke some crack and get your sympathy.
go back to the Village People! - Back up!
Damn!
all right, today is the first day of our high school careers.
Yes, it is.
there she is.
that's the girl who came up to me at my locker.
well, make your move. - What move? I don't have a move.
all right, thanks for signing up.
How're you doing?
is this your first time signing up for the Heritage Club?
Yeah, it is. Okay, bye. - Bye.
What'd you sign up for?
photography and Asian Heritage. - Asian Heritage, huh?
I like your commitment. - Yeah.
I like it a lot. - Hey, buddies! Remember me?
Hi. -Oh, Jesus H.
Oh, God.
guys, why aren't you wearing them?
why are you talking to us? - I just wanted to say thank you for helping me out yesterday and all.
you guys are definitely the type of people I'm gonna want to hang out with.
Yeah. - Hi, I'm Emmit Oosterhaus, by the way.
Hi. - Wade. That's T-Dog.
T-Dog? Dude, that's a really cool nickname.
Hey, can you guys give me a nickname?
we need to ditch this guy. He's like a stray cat.
once you feed him, he'll never go away, okay?
Hey, no secrets, T-Dog.
I'm off to U. S. History.
u. S. History. - Hey, look!
the Siamese queers had a baby.
I guess that makes them triplets, now doesn't it?
weII, actually, we still wouldn't be triplets, see.
you see, they'd be my parents, and I'd be the baby.
don't get smart with me.
I said you're triplets and I think that you guys need to get into his shirt, - and be triplets. - We can do that.
you know what? Emmit, shut up.
look, you really have to do this crap, guys?
come on, give us a break. It's the second day of school.
Hey, I like this kid. Yeah.
double Stuf's got an attitude.
Yeah. We have to do this shit because it's hilarious.
this school is boring.
watching you freak out amuses me.
and, yeah, it's just the second day of school. So guess what?
it's gonna keep coming and coming and coming!
party time!
stop peeing on me! - Wait! Wait! No!
he pissed himseIf. What a loser.
help.
help me!
is that Mario Lopez, dude? - Whoever he is, he's cute!
take his pants off! Pants off!
up, down, up... - Write your name!
No! Please, don't! No! Don't!
come on, give me one match, here. - That's funny.
all I need is one. - Yeah, I like it.
will you just give up? - Damn it! Look at that.
God, I can't even get one card! Not one thing!
state of California just robbed me, Don. You saw it.
you'd think... Where's my quarter? Did you see my...
you're always looking at me. - Is the pill bottle... I forget, - is that the castle or is that a rook? - Don, did you just take my quarter?
no, I didn't take your quarter, Drillbit.
not my fault you can't keep track of your finances.
I don't know why you're spending all your money on this dumb stuff, anyway.
you're unbelievabIe. I got to get out of here.
you know, I can't take this anymore, man.
rich people don't like us, and the tourists are scared of us.
when they see Bernie, they're terrified. - Terrified.
they're not scared of me, I'm sexy.
sanitizer? - Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
I just get... I'm like a bird. I just wanna fly north. I want to...
I'd like to go to Canada.
what was it last year? I think it was, - "I was gonna go to Iceland." - Reykjavik.
no, no. - Where's that?
Yeah, but the thing about Canada, if you go high enough north...
that's right. - ...The government pays you - to take the land. - That's the truth.
Yeah. Look it, man, the beer's twice as strong.
they don't lock the doors, that should appeal to a man like you.
and what about a British Columbian girl?
does that sound like a pretty potent mix?
Yeah, that's not too bad. I kind of like that.
okay, now, man, check this out.
one-way flight to Canada,$287.
you got to throw in 50 bucks for bribing, what're they called, - The Federales... - Mounties.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mounties.
another... I want a good winter jacket, 80 bucks.
so we're talking $387 and it's a new life for your old hombre, Drillbit.
I dig it, man. Follow the dream. Chase that thing.
how you gonna come up with that kind of money, though?
get a job.
I was an Army Ranger. There are a lot of people dying for that.
watch this kid play Hendrix. He really jams. Look at him.
Oh, yeah, there he goes.
Yeah, I like how he looks a littIe bit like Hendrix.
Yeah! I'm gonna give him a buck.
I'll give him a couple bucks. - A buck? Give him a compliment, man!
give me a buck!
why is he in my house?
are we trying to attract after-school bullies?
I'm here because Wade invited me to be here.
because I'm your friend now.
this fantasy land you live in, Emmit, are there rides?
stop picking on him, all right? This is our guy.
I don't want him to be our guy.
well, the good news is, I think I found a solution to our problems.
kill Emmit? - No, bear with me.
this might sound stupid, but I was on the Internet last night and there's a bunch of sites where we can hire a professional bodyguard.
what do you mean by bodyguard? - Like he beats up kids that bother us.
a bodyguard? Wade, that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
we should just be men and fight these kids!
are you serious?
of course not. I've never been in a fight.
have you seen those high school fights on YouTube?
kids are brutal.
he gave us an earthquake when we were peeing in the urinal.
he shoved me in a locker.
and he put my head in his shirt and called us Siamese queers.
how's that funny?
it's not funny. It's just, it's rare that, you know, kids say things that surprise me.
Siamese queers. I'd never heard that one.
what would you like me to do? -We really just want it to stop.
so are they pretty much free to say whatever they want?
or am I allowed to defend myself?
Oh, no. Principal Doppler, I thought this was gonna be anonymous.
in this country, we give the accused the chance to face his accusers.
Terry, come over here for a second, will you?
now we've known each other for... Yeah, have a seat.
what's your take on this? - Hey, guys, hey. How's it going?
be polite! There you go.
Wade. - Hi.
Hey, T-Dog. Give me a pound.
Yeah. Principal Doppler, sir, I was really excited about starting this new school year. I'm not gonna lie.
who knows? I, maybe, was hazing them a little bit, but I'm sorry.
I really am.
you know, I appreciate you taking responsibility. It's refreshing.
he doesn't mean it! - We need to call his parents in.
now. - He doesn't have any parents.
well, not in this country, anyway. They live in Hong Kong.
he's an emancipated minor. - What does that mean?
it means he's legally an adult.
he answers to no one.
he's above the law.
what a nightmare, huh? - Yeah.
Oh, crap.
Oh, no.
run. - Go! Go!
run! Go, go! - Hurry.
wait for me!
go, go!
do you think he sees us? - No.
open the door! Open the door!
what do they want?
just keep driving, Mom. It's none of our business.
let's go, let's go!
have you guys lost your mind? Come on, let's go!
go, go, come on!
come on. - Oh, no!
run! Run! - Go!
get them, baby!
there! The garage!
you gonna rat on me, boys?
try to get my parents involved in this situation?
now I have to make it my mission to destroy you punks!
Hey! You kids get the hell off my property!
I'm gonna give you three seconds, then I'm getting my shotgun!
No! - You better get out of here right now!
please don't! - No! Please!
one! Two! Three!
go! Go! - And stay out, you gang bangers!
Charles, chai latte up.
Hey! Get off my computer! - Keep your shirt on.
come on.
if this doesn't work, I'm gonna kick your ass.
when it works, you're going to kiss my ass.
how are we gonna know which one's the bodyguard?
have you ever done this kind of thing before?
I worked for the hardest gangstas in the worId.
kee Lo-Lo, Chenobee.
heII, I still work for Tupac, even though he dead.
I am Israeli Military Secret Service Antiterrorist Squad.
so when I kill this kid, do you want me to do it quickly, - or do you want him to suffer? - Suffer.
if you hire Tiger's Protection Services, not only do you get the Tiger, but you get the protection of his entire pride.
do you Iike hip-hop?
what the hell you implying I like hip-hop for?
cause I'm dressed this way? I like country. You like country?
that's the kind of music I like. Alabama. Gimme some of that.
some Brooks and Dunn. The Dixie Chicks, bitch.
kids hiring a bodyguard to take care of a bully?
stupidest thing I ever heard.
back in my day, if a kid was getting beat up, it was called childhood.
pick somebody, anybody. I'll go beat their ass right here, right now, and then you can ask them for a goddamned reference.
how about you, lady?
I'll kick your ass right now! Close. Close.
Yeah! - This is very disturbing.
you want an ass kicking?
what do you do when you're not body guarding?
I work at Raging Waters.
I sense great hesitation. Wait one moment. Excuse me.
I'm going to borrow this.
please don't do that. - Oh, God damn!
$2, 100 a week. - $10, 000 a week.
$2, 100 a week. - $10, 000 a week.
we're hoping you'd say, like, around $100.
not interested. - I hate kids like you.
I can't help you. No one can help you!
Susan, your double espresso's up. - I'm Susan.
I'm Drillbit Taylor.
u. S. Army Ranger, black ops operative, decorated marksman, - improvised weapons expert. - Are you still in the military?
I was discharged. Unauthorized heroism.
Yeah. They call it an army of one in the ads, but they don't mean it.
unless they mean the whole army working together as one.
but they certainly don't want one man out there kicking ass like an army of one, which is the way I took it.
as a bodyguard I protected three Vice Presidents,
Bobby Brown, Sylvester Stallone... Not as tough as he looks.
so what's the story? Who do you guys need protection from?
it should be easy for you. Just a high school bully.
Yeah. Run into a few of those in my life.
What'd you do to provoke him? - Well, he's fat, and he's a dork, - and I'm awesome. - Shut up, Wade.
by "awesome" do you mean scared, skinny and lonely?
Yeah.
Yeah.
so how do we know you're legit? - Come here. Go on, come here.
I'm not gonna bite.
I want you to look at my eyes.
take a good look.
come here! What do you see? You looking?
what the hell have you seen? - You want some?
these eyes have seen unspeakable horror.
that's my evidence.
that's how you know if a guy's legit. You need some evidence, too?
I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.
isn't that Blade Runner?
look closely 'cause it's all in there.
Boo!
so, how much do you charge?
$387 a week.
one second. - I say yes.
I'm not even sure if I'm availabIe.
he's good. - No! No! He's weird.
you know, we might be able to work up to that.
but right now, we've only got $83.
okay, well, give me that now and we'll figure out the rest later.
you know what this is?
it's a wing.
and you're under it. All three of you, right there.
okay, here's the mission plan.
using my expertise at stealthy and covert ops, I'll infiltrate the school where I will watch over you like the Lord almighty himseIf.
careful.
like the good Lord, I'm gonna use some mysterious ways, so you're not aIways gonna see me, but I'll be there.
especially when you don't see me.
but first, I'm gonna need some supplies.
I want to go in and get... - Like nunchucks?
maybe.
but a lot of stuff, I'll just get from just what's laying around the house.
you'd be surprised.
anything can be turned into a weapon of mayhem or destruction.
even a puppy? - Especially a puppy.
Germans used them in World War I. Da Hunden Stormen. Lightning Dog.
they'd attach dynamite to them. Rommel did it. Jerry bastard.
now, listen. One thing that... - This is my house.
Wow.
we can go in. Nobody's home. - Let's hit it. Deploy, soldiers.
soldiers? Cool. You hear that, T-Dog? - Beeline, front door! Single file!
officers first!
you, get me a bowl of cereal. Go on. Scram.
okay, this I'm gonna need. Right here. - What for?
you take that, my mom'll rip my head off!
at ease, Casper!
okay. Observe its momentary reflective blinding capabilities.
bang! You're defenseless.
silver alloy, one of the strongest ever constructed.
probably stop an armor-piercing bullet at point-blank range.
you don't really think it couId come to that.
you tell me.
Filkins is a whack job. He almost ran over us with his car!
he's a menace. - Yeah, I was my dad's favorite, too.
he once cut a kid's arm off with a samurai sword.
bladed weaponry? - Yeah.
okay. I'm not gonna take any chances. You're now on orange alert.
okay, now this will be good for video surveillance.
this is good.
you take the guts out of this and use it for wiretapping.
I think we can use this as a... I don't know, as a timekeeping device.
I think I'll wear it on my wrist, possibly.
you think you might need this?
this piece of crap's not worth anything.
as a weapon. It's too obvious.
testing, one, two. Mister Taylor?
testing, one, two. - Come back now?
guys, you got to go far back! I can hear you!
testing, testing, one, two. Can you hear me now?
they work pretty good. - These are great.
Yeah. - These are invaluable.
they get a little static, though... - Yeah.
...I think, some places in the house.
why you need all this stuff for?
I thought we were gonna give Filkins a beat down.
I am gonna beat him down, but sometimes after that first beat down, then they get a little, you know... They want a little payback.
I'm home! Who wants grilled-cheese sandwiches?
go! Go! Mom! Mom! - Okay.
exit! Exit! - Go, out the back, out the back, go.
just 'cause you don't see me doesn't mean I'm not there.
shut the door. - Act natural. Hey, Mom.
Hey, Barbara, how you doing? - Hi, boys.
who's your new little friend? Hi. - Hi.
Hi. Emmit Oosterhaus. - Hi, Emmit Oosterhaus.
he's not our friend. - Yeah, he is.
he's like our hamster.
smell like something?
Ryan? You washing? - Yeah. You?
it's a funny smell. It's all right. Grilled-cheese sandwiches.
Hey, come on! Buzz us in!
you're gonna wanna see this!
big money coming in!
this ain't a bunch of aluminum cans here.
where do you want it? Priceless treasures.
go set them down there.
so you don't think those kids are gonna miss this stuff?
no. They got two of everything.
they got the iPod, the iPod Nano. And I don't care if they do, 'cause after this little transaction, well, the old Drillbit's taking his act to the Great White North.
what? - Yeah, I'm going to Canada.
well, that's stupid. You're gonna cut out now?
I'm going... - These kids are a cash cow, Drillbit.
you need to hang in there. You don't cut and run.
you got to get in there and milk this.
okay, come on back.
ali right, l'll tell you what. I give you $125 for the whole lot.
what?
I just heard you say you took it from some kids.
so? Don't get all righteous on me.
half this store you guys got from crackheads and thieves.
Hey. Who the hell do you think you are, man?
let me tell you something. Those people are our customers!
we're not that harsh on them, so you shouldn't be!
how would you like it if we called you a crackhead?
you have called me one.
have we? Have we? - I think I might have.
Drillbit? Drillbit? Come in. - What is that?
I'm sorry, hold it just a second. D. B. one-four-nine-eight, come in.
just take this. - We just wanted you to know that Emmit was holding out on some bar mitzvah money.
Emmit, I don't care how many times you get bar mitzvahed, you're not a man.
I am a man. - No, you're not.
Drillbit! Milk it, milk it. - So we'lI have another 50 bucks for you - on Monday. - Grab the udder and milk it.
Ten-four, good buddy. I will see you tomorrow.
commence radio silence in three, two.
today's the official start of our high school careers.
last week's history. Nothing good came out of last week.
we became best friends. - Nothing good came out of last week.
there's the sword. Man, we're so dead.
Where's Drillbit, Wade? - Hey. Calvary's here.
please, where have you been? - Yes. What's up, man?
Where's my money? Where's my money?
we got 40 bucks we promised, plus we got an extra 17.
I sold my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.
okay, this is gonna be sweet.
I can't wait to watch you kick Filkins' ass.
I can't wait to watch you kick Filkins' ass.
Yeah. What, is he here? - Yeah, over there on his car.
what are you gonna do?
what am I gonna do? - Come on.
I want you to gnaw on his skull.
what's the plan? - Shut up.
guys, I'm gonna check this dude out.
Yes.
excuse me.
Yeah.
just got to kind of stand here for a second.
all right. Hey, take it easy, man.
he's thin, but sinewy and muscular.
he's got a low center of gravity which means he's fast like a jack rabbit.
he didn't take a shower today or yesterday. He's got bad breath.
he's got a couple of cavities which is not improving...
this is serious. I thought you were gonna go kick his ass.
Yeah.
look at Tommy Trigger Finger. You want the blood and the guts.
well, it doesn't work that way.
I can't just kick his ass.
physically, I can, but if you kick a bully's ass, then maybe you guys live till lunchtime.
and then what?
teach those victims how to kick the bully's ass and they live forever.
steven Seagal.
so you're gonna teach us how to beat him up?
like train us? - So we're gonna beat up Filkins?
what I'm about to show you are top-secret black ops fighting moves.
and it's alI about technique.
I don't care if you're talking about karate, tai chi, kung fu, praying mantis, kung pao, Panda Express.
lt's alI about technique. I want you to watch my technique.
lt's pretty flawless. Come on, Ryan, charge me.
l'm serious. Try to kill me.
come on. You ready? Go! Yeah. Come on.
I got you!
I got you! I got you!
damn it!
okay. Tripped right there. That was the bear hug.
okay. Wade. Come on!
here you go! Watch the elbows!
don't! Stop!
okay. Last but not least. Charge me.
everyone, up! Circle me!
come on. Let me see some fight from you.
okay, you guys ready for the blizzard?
go get him, boys! - Yeah. Go, get it, alI three of you!
I call truce! Truce! Back up! Three's too many. Three's too many. Stop.
wow, one of you really charley-horsed me.
okay. Now it isn't all oriental martial arts.
sometimes you give a little Mexican judo as in "Ju don't know who you're messing with, homes."
come on, Ryan, one more. Last one! Show me your mettle. Come on! Ole!
Wow!
man down!
was that my fault?
Hey! Check this out.
dude! You fell like 60 feet.
jeez, that was crazy.
what is this?
this is a strategic outpost.
I got these posted all over the city.
don't even look at it, okay?
now let's get back up there and get to work.
what's this for? To wash your balls in the morning?
no. Look like a squeegee to you?
or does it look like a weapon with a straight edge and a little mop to clean up the blood?
T-Dog, Emmit, this way.
Where's Drillbit? - I don't know.
wait up. - Should be right up here.
man down!
take this.
take a swing at my head. - Oh, no.
Wade, come on. Just hit me.
but it'll hurt. - Wade hit me.
I'll do it. - Shut up.
I feel no pain, 'cause I have a trained mind.
go! - Come on.
let's beat it. - Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
Hey, Drillbit. We could make this more! - No.
how much does a Hug Me Bear cost? - No.
Where'd you get the kids, Drillbit? - I won them in a poker game.
how's this part of the training? - It's called bulking up.
I'm already fat. - Hey. You're not fat.
I don't want to hear you say you're fat.
words like lard ass, fat pig, butterball, landslide, mudslide.
I don't want to hear that. What are you tipping the scales at?
what?
whenever you're ready, boys.
okay, one of you guys got to pick this up, 'cause l'm stilI on the clock.
avoidance technique! Avoidance technique!
come out here, Capone! You want to fight?
you want to fight, you and me, right here?
this is very important. See that?
what's the matter? Afraid to come out from behind your men?
he has a holdback guy. - Afraid to stand up for yourself?
now that allows people to think that you want to fight when really he doesn't want to fight.
you got nothing in court. You don't got the bookkeeper.
when I'm here l'm your holdback guy.
now you can act crazy.
Hey, hey, calm down!
I'm gonna kill you!
stop! Stop!
calm down.
get under the wing.
put all the bills facing the same direction.
don't worry about it, Don.
I thought these kids were loaded.
it's like all you read about are how 14-year-olds rule the marketplace, and look at this.
hardly got anything. You think this is gonna get me to the Great White North?
allow me to make a point real quick.
Hello, delicious.
Drillbit? Do you know why we come here every day?
it's because these businessmen can't eat all their food.
they have more than they need.
these kids are a lot like these businessmen, Okay?
they have way more than they need.
it's our job to go into their houses and take all their excess.
I get a kick out of these kids.
I told you that little fat one says some funny shit.
I like these kids, too, man.
I mean, from what I gather, they're some pretty cool dudes.
but if you like them, you should think about helping them.
if you care about them. - What do you mean?
steal their TV.
maybe they'll read a book.
steal their iPod. Heck, I don't know. Maybe they'll learn to play the piano.
they don't need all this crap.
you think Mozart had a Game Boy?
I didn't have it. Didn't hurt me. I was outside playing, climbing trees.
man, me, too. l'm still outside hanging around in trees.
and the parents are never around. There's no one there in the daytime.
one big hit. It's all we need.
boobies.
penis!
all right. Open your eyes, let your body drift back into consciousness.
Namaste. Thank you for your practice. That concludes the meditation time.
okay. How do you feel? - I feel good.
doing all right? - I think my biceps are coming in.
guns are coming in.
now, listen. We're about 10% done with the training.
next... - 10% ?
are you high? We can't sit in the woods anymore.
we got to go back to school. - And I can't forge any more notes.
how many diseases can a kid have?
you guys think you're ready?
you know, I am really scared to go back.
look. If you're not ready to fight, there is another alternative.
but I got to be honest with you, only the strongest of warriors can pull this one off.
it's so difficult that most men tremble at its mere thought.
what is it?
what the hell is it?
love him.
what? - Love him.
you know, I don't know what's going through your head, Drillbit, but I'm not gonna bang him.
when I'm talking about love, I mean compassion.
I'm not going to... - Shut up. And understanding.
find your commonality.
let him know you're more alike than different.
maybe that'll put out his fuse.
and remember, guys, just because you don't see me doesn't mean I'm not there.
I'll be there like a silent, deadly poltergeist.
Thanks.
all right, see you later, Drillbit.
remember, you're under my wing.
no.
there he is. Should we hide?
no. We've been running and hiding all week.
this is what Drillbit's been talking about, finding commonalities.
he's rapping. You love to rap! You can do this!
no, I can't.
Yes, you can. It's just like in 8 Mile. He'll respect you.
no, man, I'm afraid of him. I can't!
you're crazy! Don't do it. - You can do it, Ryan.
I believe in you. - Don't.
all right. I can do it. I can do it.
Whassup, whassup? - Whassup?
I wanna rap with you. Flip the script, Ronnie.
hit that beat.
yo, this cool, Fil? - Sure, whatever.
yo, call me whatever you want. But you know I gets busy. I'm so badass.
I'm the king of Vice City. Like the Buddha, I'm Zen.
like Beckham, I bend, I tell suckers, "Say hello to my little friend."
snap! This guy!
meatball, where's your spaghetti? Your rapping's like a nightmare.
but I don't see Freddy. You best not even try to spit rhymes, dude. 'Cause when you spit all l ever see is chewed-up food.
that's how we roll! That's how we do!
hold on!
I know you didn't just go there.
nice, man, nice.
so you better step off before you insult me and mine. 'Cause if you decide to step on, see I'm like a land mine.
my God, look, it's a punk-ass rapping.
he say one more word, I'm gonna have to bitch-slap him.
so surprised you're moving ass is so damn fat.
you're lucky, I don't hit you with my Wiffle, Wiffle Ball bat.
can't hurt my head with a bat. I'm the lncredible Hulk.
I'm like Costco. I'm serving ass-kickings in bulk.
you don't like my words, Mister King of the School?
well, guess what? You can suck on my family's jewels.
bitch!
that was awesome.
what have I just done?
that was amazing. I mean, telling him to suck on your two family jewels was in questionable taste, but still...
I know, I got caught up in the moment, Okay?
keep walking. I don't want to get shot Iike Tupac.
you know, most of those people were cheering for you.
Really? That could be good. Maybe Drillbit was right.
think you're so funny?
good. 'Cause you're not gonna laugh when you're dead.
you're gonna get it now, worse than ever.
all of you.
Ryan, holdback technique.
you don't like the fact that he's better than you, Filkins!
you better back the hell off before I...
thanks for holding him for me. - Holy crap, you guys are retarded!
how did he do so much damage with one punch?
it's Iike his fist is the size of your whole face.
I guess it's true.
rap really does promote violence.
but the question is, where was Drillbit when we needed him?
maybe he got called to the black ops.
Wade, come on. You really believe that garbage?
there's my little soldiers.
there are my pooper troopers.
sorry I missed that walkie-talkie call. I had something come...
what the hell happened to you? - Filkins punched me.
Filkins did that to you?
where were you?
with one punch? - Where were you?
crap. I'm sorry. - Stop.
no, just let me get the blood off. - No. Stop.
man. Here, sit down for a second.
crap. It looks painful. - It is.
here, let me put a little pressure on it. - No.
hold it, hold it, hold it.
Ryan had a rap off with Filkins.
you had a rap off? - You said to find common ground.
he said he was like Costco, serving up ass-kickings in bulk.
that's what you said? That's not common ground.
even though it's funny.
that's not exactly what I meant when I said common ground.
why didn't you get punched? Why'd he slug you?
cause of your brilliant holdback technique.
the holdback technique? You really tried that?
bottom line is your advice backfired.
now we're more screwed than ever.
all because you wanted to protect the hobbit over here.
let's just stop for a second. - I am not a hobbit.
you're a damn hobbit, Okay? - I am not!
hold it! Emmit's not a hobbit, I don't think.
problem isn't the holdback technique, although I don't think you guys had it perfected enough to try.
the problem is Randy starts rapping insults.
it's not Randy! It's Ryan!
and all this talk about you being there when you're not there, it's bull!
I'm tired of your nonsense! You're fired!
sit down here. Sit down here for a second.
all of you, sit down. You take the bass out of your voice when you talk to me.
now, we just completed phase one.
see if this guy has any mettle. And guess what we found out?
Filkins does have some mettle. So now we move to phase two.
know what phase two is? Direct contact.
that's where I come in. Because I will not let this happen again, if I can help it.
so what's the plan?
the plan?
how early do you guys have to get up for school?
God. Okay. Tomorrow, we all go in together.
Wade, what's up?
Where'd you get the shiner?
come in here, boy. Talk to me.
I was protecting this one kid in my school from a bunch of bullies and one of them punched me.
what? Why would you protect the kid from a bully?
so he doesn't get beat up.
then you're interfering with the natural order.
when I was a kid, I was kind of a bully.
but it's not a bad thing. There was this kid. I don't know what it was.
maybe it was his stupid face. But he'd just really get under my skin.
so I pushed him around a little bit, called him some hurtful names, and I honestly think, if I met him today, he'd thank me for it.
I prepared him for the harshness of the real world.
Thanks, Jim.
I'm a resource, Wade. You should use me more often.
is it locked?
you got lunch money? - Yep.
you got any tests today? - See you and the questions.
don't fresh-off to any of your teachers.
all right, come here, give mommy a kiss.
come on, punky-wunky. I love you.
be good.
Bye. I love you. - Bye. I love you, Mommy!
I love you, Mommy.
black ops in the hizzouse.
this old soldier could use a kissy from mommy.
come on. I'm going in to the school today.
Drillbit is going in. Very visible. Let's do it.
you can't go in there looking like that. - Why?
you look like Crocodile Dundee or something.
screw you. What're you talking about?
I'm just saying we need to clean you up.
wrong. This soldier doesn't clean up. What you see is what you get.
Drillbit, you just don't look like a teacher.
I mean, we need you to blend in. The camouflage technique.
in my house. Come on. - Let's go.
camouflage technique? I like that.
...if I remember how to do this. lt really is strong enough for a man.
did your dad leave any socks behind?
how many tardies can you have before they give you a detention?
Emmit, you're drying my eyeballs.
all right, here's our class schedules and a detailed map of the school.
we have the first class together, so just meet us by the Life Skills room so you can walk us to our lockers.
okay, now, remember, I'm not just gonna walk in there and start kicking ass, Okay? I got to protect you guys, but I need to blend in and lay low.
I'm gonna be visible to you guys, but invisible to everyone else.
good morning, Bastian.
good morning.
I had another dream, Dad, about Mom.
I understand, son.
but we have to get on with things, right?
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.
we can't let Mom's death be an excuse for not getting the job done, right?
Yes.
son, it's time you and I had a talk.
I got a call from your math teacher yesterday.
she says that you were drawing horses in your math book.
unicorns. They were unicorns.
what?
she also says you don't do your homework on time.
I'm very disappointed you didn't even try out for the swimming team.
as to those riding lessons you wanted...
you say you love horses but you're afraid to get on a real one.
you're old enough to get your head down out of the clouds and...
...and keep both feet on the ground, right?
okay.
stop daydreaming. Start facing your problems. Okay?
there, I think we've had a nice talk.
we should have more.
have a good day, son. Don't be late for school again.
but, yesterday I wasn't.
Hey, it's the weirdo.
weirdo, you got any cash for us today?
let's get him!
you can't get away.
you're dead, chicken!
we'll get you!
Where's your money? - I don't have any!
no money? Mamma's boy is holding out.
if you ain't got money, you go in the garbage.
maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.
who said you could get out of the garbage?
get back in there.
not again.
not again!
where are you going, wimp?
he went that way. - Which way?
get out of here! I don't like kids.
are you still here? Didn't you hear me?
the video arcade is down the street.
here we just sell small rectangular objects. They're called books.
they require effort and make no beeps.
on your way, please.
I know books. I have 186 of them at home.
comic books.
no, I've read Treasure Island...
... The Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz...
...Lord of the Rings, 20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.
who are you running away from?
just some kids from school.
Why?
they threw me in the garbage.
why not punch them in the nose?
I don't know.
what's that book about?
Oh, this is something special.
well, what is it?
look.
your books are safe.
while you're reading them...
...you get to become Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.
but that's what I like about them.
but afterwards you get to be a little boy again.
what do you mean?
listen.
have you ever been Captain Nemo...
...Trapped inside your submarine while the giant squid is attacking you?
Yes.
weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?
but it's only a story.
that's what I'm talking about.
the ones you read are safe.
and that one isn't?
don't worry about it.
but you just said it was...
this book is not for you.
Koreander's.
what can I do for you?
math test. Oh, no!
it was midnight in the Howling Forest.
the wind whistled through the tops of the ancient trees.
suddenly, something enormous crashed and rumbled through the eerie woods.
what's that?
excuse me...
...but would it be all right if I joined you this evening?
you see, I've been traveling all day.
now I see why you picked this camp.
a delicious looking limestone rock!
nice bouquet.
must be a real vintage year.
Yes, you're right.
those delicious rocks are the reason we've camped here.
is he a nutcase? - No, he's a Rock Biter.
a Rock Biter!
sorry. - Poor baby.
pardon me.
that was limestone, with a dash of quartz.
very tasty.
where I come from in the North, we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.
only now...
...Now...
...they're all gone.
I know how it happened.
I swear it wasn't me.
No!
I think I know what it was. Tell us more.
near my home, there used to be a beautiful lake...
...but then...
...then it was gone.
did the lake dry up?
no. It just wasn't there anymore.
nothing was there anymore. Not even a dried-up lake.
a hole?
a hole would be something. No, it was nothing.
and it got bigger and bigger.
first, there was no lake anymore.
and then, finally, no rocks.
if he keeps stuffing his face like that, soon there won't be any rocks here either.
night Hob, this could be serious!
rock Biter...
...what you told us is also happening where I live in the West.
a strange sort of nothing is destroying everything.
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South and it's there, too.
so, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?
maybe, it's already everywhere.
maybe our whole land is in danger.
what can we do?
my people are sending me to the Ivory Tower, to the Empress, for help.
we are on the same...
we are on the same mission. After all, if the Empress can't save us...
...who could?
then why are we all just sitting here instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?
right! What are we waiting for?
Yes. Yes. Let's go now.
wake up!
come on, old girl.
we can't just hang around here.
wake up! Ready for take off.
Oh, stupid bat!
we can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?
don't worry. It's a racing snail.
but we can't even wait for a racing snail.
it really is a racing snail.
nobody gives a hoot about me and my stupid bat.
maybe I'll take a few of these yummy gourmet rocks, for the road...
Oh, no.
the Nothing!
look!
there it is!
the heart of Fantasia!
I never knew it was that beautiful.
stay awake!
I told you to stay awake.
the home of the Empress.
she's our only hope.
friends, I know why you are all here.
the Nothing is destroying our world.
I also know that you have come to beseech the Empress for help.
but I...
but I have terrible news.
the Empress herself has become deathly ill.
there seems to be a mysterious link between her illness and the Nothing.
she's dying.
so, she cannot save us.
but there just might be one chance.
the Plains People who hunt the purple buffalo...
...Have among them a great warrior.
he alone has a chance to fight the Nothing and save us.
he is our only hope.
his name is Atreyu.
Atreyu.
the Empress had already sent for the great warrior.
when he finally appeared on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...
...he carried with him the hopes of all Fantasia.
a little boy!
I'm sorry, but this is not the time nor place for children.
I must ask you to leave.
if you don't want me here, you should've not send for me.
is he a nutcase?
it was not you we sent for. We wanted Atreyu.
I am Atreyu.
not Atreyu the Child.
Atreyu the Warrior.
I am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.
but I'll be happy to go back to hunting the purple buffalo.
wait!
come back, please.
if you really are the Atreyu we sent for...
...you would be willing to go on a quest?
Yes, of course.
what kind of a quest?
to find a cure for the Empress...
...and to save our world.
no one can give you any advice except this:
you must go alone.
you must leave all your weapons behind.
it will be very dangerous.
any chance of success?
I do not know.
but if you fail...
...the Empress will surely die...
...and our whole world will be destroyed.
when do I begin?
now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.
the Nothing grows stronger every day.
take this.
the Auryn!
he who wears the Auryn speaks for the Empress.
it will guide and protect you.
wake up.
farewell, Atreyu.
take care.
at the same time...
...Elsewhere in Fantasia, a Creature of Darkness...
...Also began his quest.
they had been traveling aimlessly for almost a week...
...but they could not find a cure for the Empress.
neither Atreyu nor his horse, Artax, had the vaguest suspicion...
...that the Creature of Darkness, the Gmork was already tracking them down.
what is it, Artax?
is it time to go already?
I know what you want. It's time to eat.
good idea.
no, it's a great idea!
no, not too much.
we still have a long way to go.
a Treyu and Artax had searched the Silver Mountains...
...the Desert of Shattered Hopes and the Crystal Towers...
...Without success.
and so, there was only one chance left.
to find Morla, the Ancient One...
...the wisest being in Fantasia...
...Whose home was the Shell Mountain...
...Somewhere in the deadly Swamps of Sadness.
come on, boy. Come on.
that's it.
it's okay.
everyone knew that whoever let the sadness overtake him...
...would sink into the swamp.
you're doing fine, Artax.
come on, Artax.
what's the matter?
what's wrong?
come on, boy.
what's the matter?
I understand.
it's too difficult for you.
Artax, you're sinking! Come on!
turn around! You have to! Now!
fight against the sadness.
Artax, please.
don't let the sadness of the swamps get to you.
you have to try. You have to care.
for me.
you're my friend. I love you.
Artax, stupid horse.
you got to move or you'll die.
move. Please.
I won't give up. Don't quit.
Artax!
the Shell Mountain.
Morla, the Ancient One.
Morla.
Morla!
but that's impossible. They couldn't have heard me.
are you Morla, the Ancient One?
not that it matters, but yes.
please help me, Morla. Do you recognize this?
well...
...we haven't seen the Auryn in a long time.
we?
is there someone else here, too?
we haven't spoken to anyone else...
...for thousands of years.
so we started talking to ourselves.
Morla, I bring terrible news.
did you know the Empress is ill?
not that it matters, but yes.
actually, we don't care.
if I don't save her, she'll die.
there's a terrible Nothing sweeping over the land.
don't you care?
we don't even care...
...whether or not we care.
do you have a cold?
no. We're allergic to youth.
you know how to help the Empress, don't you?
not that it matters...
...but yes.
if you won't tell me and then Nothing is coming, you'll die too. Both of you!
die?
that, at least, would be something.
please help me. You said you knew the answer.
we're tired of sneezing.
go away! Nothing matters.
that's not true. If it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.
tell me, please.
we don't know.
but you can ask the Southern Oracle.
how can I get there?
you can't.
it's 10, 000 miles away.
but that's so far.
that's right.
forget it.
give up.
no.
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.
Oh, boy!
after days and nights of unconsciousness...
...Atreyu slowly opened his eyes...
...and found himself in strange surroundings.
he was clean and his wounds were dressed.
leaving so soon?
I was just going to...
I have to...
I was trying to... - Sneak away?
Yes. I mean, no.
I like children.
for breakfast?
never. I'm a luck dragon.
my name is Falkor.
and my name is... - Atreyu. And you're on a quest.
how did you know that?
you were unconscious.
you talked in your sleep.
could you get around...
...and scratch behind my right ear?
I can never quite reach it.
here?
that's so good.
thank you.
so, little fellow, you're on your way to the Southern Oracle?
Yes. But it's hopeless.
it's too far away. - I wouldn't necessarily say that.
you know how to get there?
Oh, sure. It's right on the corner.
how did all this happen?
with luck.
you brought me the entire 10, 000 miles?
no. Only 9, 891 ...
...as the dragon flies.
you're amazing.
having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a quest.
things will work out fine.
never give up and good luck will find you.
it's good to have a friend again.
you have more than one.
look.
get out of my light, wench.
you're disturbing my scientific work.
you and your scientific work.
what the boy needs now is one of my potions.
the boy will need my scientific advice much more.
but not until he's well.
get back to your own corner, Engy.
I'm always finding you in my place.
he's well.
now it's my turn with him.
no, you don't!
I'll decide when he's well. It's your turn when I say it is.
well, little man, still in pain?
it's all right.
I like that. The patient telling the doctor it's all right.
it has to hurt if it's to heal.
here.
drink that.
good?
that's my bat-wing broth.
there's eye of newt in there, tree mold, old lizard brains...
...Scales from a rancid sea serpent.
just where did you and your dragon come from?
what are you on to?
anything of interest to the scientific community?
my name is Atreyu. I came to find the Southern Oracle.
here we go again.
you've come to the right place, my boy.
I am somewhat of an expert on the Southern Oracle.
it is my scientific specialty.
it is my scientific specialty.
why don't you sit down and be quiet for once?
you keep quiet, wench.
it's my turn.
my name is Engywook. She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?
I don't think so.
you don't move in scientific circles.
I am the expert on the Southern Oracle.
you've come to the right place.
there's no fool like an old fool.
wait! Stay here.
the observatory. To the winch, wench.
come on, lazybones! Can't you go any faster?
I've been studying the Southern Oracle for years.
some day I'll publish my book:
a Century of Studying the Southern Oracle, by Professor Engywook.
volume l. The Early Years.
have you ever been to the Southern Oracle?
what do you think?
I work scientifically.
look.
is that the Southern Oracle?
no. It's the first of the two gates you must pass through before you reach the Southern Oracle...
...and get me the final information for my book.
of course, most people never get that far.
Why?
the Sphinxes' eyes...
...Stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth tries to pass by.
here comes one that looks fancy.
let's see what he really thinks of himself.
look! Look!
go on, scaredy-cat!
Oh, go on.
it's my turn. Let me see. I'm the scientist.
he's going on.
I think he'll make it.
the Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut? Let me see.
they're shut.
No! Wait!
the eyes are opening!
No!
did he make it? Did he?
no.
fancy armor doesn't help.
the Sphinxes can see straight into your heart.
listen.
next time let me see what happens. It's my telescope.
I'm going to try.
No!
don't go yet. I haven't told you about the next gate.
it's even worse than this one.
he'll never make it.
don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.
be confident.
run, Atreyu!
run, Atreyu!
run! Now!
he made it!
he made it!
he made it!
he made it! He made it!
you could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.
he made it! Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.
I always said he could do it. - Good.
but that's no reason to fall out of the basket again.
I knew he'd be safe.
nonsense. You don't understand anything.
the worst one is coming up. Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.
Atreyu must face his true self.
so what? That won't be too hard for him.
that's what everyone thinks.
but kind people find that they are cruel.
brave men discover they are really cowards.
confronted with their true selves...
...Most men run away screaming.
now, this is going too far.
what if they really do know about me in Fantasia?
the Southern Oracle?
do not be afraid.
we will not harm you.
we have been waiting for you a long time. Atreyu
are you the Southern Oracle?
Yes, we are.
then you must know what can save Fantasia.
Yes, we do.
well, what is it? I have to know!
the Empress...
...needs...
...a new name.
a new name? That's all?
but that's easy.
I can give her any name she wants.
no one from Fantasia can do it.
only a human child...
...can give her this new name.
a human child? Where can I find one?
you can only find one...
...beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
if you want to save our world...
...you must hurry.
we don't know...
...how much longer we can withstand the Nothing.
Falkor!
hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.
don't worry.
we'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.
do you know where they are? - I have no idea.
then how do we find a human child?
with luck.
faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.
all right, hang on tight.
what a shame they don't ask me.
my mother...
...she had such a wonderful name.
on and on they flew until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...
...where they could go no further.
look, Atreyu. The Nothing.
Atreyu!
Atreyu.
Falkor!
where are you?
Falkor!
Atreyu! Where are you? Atreyu!
Falkor!
Atreyu!
they look like big good, strong hands, don't they?
I always thought that's what they were.
my little friends.
the little man with his racing snail...
...the Night Hob...
...even the stupid bat.
I couldn't hold on to them.
the Nothing pulled them right out of my hands.
I failed.
no, you didn't fail. I'm the one who failed.
I was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.
but I lost the Auryn.
I can't find my luck dragon.
so I won't be able to get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
listen.
the Nothing will be here any minute.
I will just sit here...
...and let it take me away, too.
they look like good strong hands, don't they?
Morla?
Artax!
Artax.
if you come any closer...
...l will rip you to shreds.
who are you?
I am Gmork.
and you, whoever you are...
...can have the honor of being my last victim.
I will not die easily.
I am a warrior.
brave warrior.
then fight the Nothing.
I can't. I can't get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
what's so funny?
fantasia has no boundaries.
that's not true.
you're lying. - Foolish boy.
don't you know anything about Fantasia?
it's the world of human fantasy.
every part...
...Every creature...
...is a piece of the dreams and hopes of mankind.
therefore...
...it has no boundaries.
why is Fantasia dying then?
because people have begun to lose their hopes...
...and forget their dreams.
so the Nothing grows stronger.
what is the Nothing?
it's the emptiness that's left.
it is like a despair...
...Destroying this world.
and I have been trying to help it.
but why?
because people who have no hopes...
...are easy to control.
and whoever has the control...
...has the power.
who are you, really?
I am the servant of the power behind the Nothing.
I was sent to kill the only one...
...who could have stopped the Nothing.
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.
his name...
...was Atreyu.
if we're about to die anyway, I'd rather die fighting.
come for me, Gmork. I am Atreyu!
Falkor!
Atreyu!
that was the end of Fantasia.
only a few fragments of this once rich and beautiful world had been left by the Nothing.
good old Falkor.
can you see anything? Anything at all? - No. All the land is gone.
I know. And all because I failed.
you tried.
could the Ivory Tower still be standing?
let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.
let the Auryn guide you.
if the Ivory Tower still stands, take us there.
Falkor!
the Ivory Tower!
the Empress.
go on.
Atreyu.
why do you look so sad?
I have failed you, Empress.
no.
you haven't.
you brought him with you.
who?
the earthling child.
the one...
...who can save us all.
you knew about the earthling child?
of course. I knew everything.
my horse died, I nearly drowned.
I just barely got away from the Nothing.
for what? To find out what you already knew?
it was the only way to get in touch with an earthling.
but I didn't get in touch with an earthling!
Yes, you did.
he has suffered with you.
he went through everything you went through.
and now, he has come here...
...with you.
he is very close, listening...
...to every word we say.
what?
where is he? If he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?
he doesn't realize he's already part of The Neverending Story.
the Neverending Story?
what's that?
just as he is sharing all your adventures...
...Others are sharing his.
they were with him...
...when he hid from the boys in the bookstore.
but that's impossible!
they were with him when he took the book...
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...
...in which he's reading his own story right now.
I can't believe it.
they can't be talking about me.
what if he doesn't appear?
then our world will disappear.
and so will I.
how could he let that happen?
he doesn't understand that he's the one with the power to stop it.
he simply can't imagine...
...that one little boy could be that important.
is it really me?
maybe he doesn't know what to do.
what do I have to do?
he has to give me a new name.
he's already chosen it.
he just has to call it out.
but it's only a story. It's not real.
it's only a story.
Atreyu, no!
Atreyu.
Bastian!
why don't you do what you dream, Bastian?
but I can't. I must keep my feet on the ground.
call my name.
Bastian, please!
save us!
all right! I'll do it!
I'll save you. I will do what I dream.
why is it so dark?
in the beginning, it is always dark.
what is that?
one grain of sand.
it is all that remains of my vast empire.
fantasia has totally disappeared?
Yes.
then everything's been in vain.
no, it hasn't.
fantasia can arise anew...
...from your dreams and wishes.
how?
open your hand.
what are you going to wish for?
I don't know.
then there will be no Fantasia anymore.
how many wishes do I get?
as many as you want.
and the more wishes you make...
...the more magnificent Fantasia will become.
Really?
try it.
then my first wish is...
Falkor, it's even more beautiful than I thought!
like it? - Falkor, it's wonderful.
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.
Atreyu and Artax!
what would you like to wish for next?
look, there they are.
it's a monster!
get them, Falkor! Let's see how you like it, chickens.
down here.
we're going to get you!
bastian made many other wishes...
...and had many other amazing adventures...
...before he finally returned to the ordinary world.
but that's another story.
it shouldn't be here.
good solid spike.
nice symmetry to the modulation.
detection protocol. Now!
confirmation Phase One. - Swing dish five degrees off axis.
and signal fades. Looking good.
now swing dish back on target.
signal returns. Definitely sky based. Wolf 336. you are howling.
phase Two!
initiating software check.
jumping ahead to Phase Three: second source verification.
who's still on line? Green Bank? Ohio State? Moffet Field!
checking. Still checking.
be there. Just be there. We got to get another ear on this.
software self-checks. Phase Two complete.
come on. Moffet. You're killing me. I'm dying here!
just pick up the phone so we can confirm this.
nothing.
Zaminsky!
Zaminsky! This is not valet parking!
stalled out on me. Stalled on me! This piece of...
sorry. sir.
sorry.
that's it? Forty-two seconds.
we listened all night.
all night. all morning. and the sound never repeated.
it's 42 seconds of nonrandom. non-Earth-based signal!
this could be it. Gordy.
sounds compressed. like a military burst communication.
no way. No way. Not at 107 megahertz.
107? What the hell are you doing so far below the microwave?
good question.
so this is a variable star. this Wolf 336?
14. 6 light-years away.
all right. Okay.
so if it is a variable. it expands and contracts dramatically.
so. gentlemen. maybe you can explain to me...
how intelligent life can actually develop in such a volatile environment.
it's only been unstable for what?
fifty years or so.
which means it's possible some form of life could still exist there.
exactly.
maybe this is a distress call.
an S. O.S.
maybe they're sending out their Encyclopedia Gallactica...
jettisoning all their knowledge before it goes down with the ship.
it lasted 42 seconds. and it never repeated.
that's why we have to stay on this one. Gordy. in case it does.
I'll pull double shifts. I'll pull triple shifts if I have to.
but I want priority status and dish time. Serious dish time.
during normal business hours. preferably.
Calvin. why don't you go home. get some sleep. okay?
go ahead.
it's a mandatory 20%cutback.
tracking station has a fixed operating cost. I can't touch that.
I've got to look at personnel. - Are you even shitting me?
I can swing a month's pay. instead of two weeks.
maybe extend the health benefits two weeks beyond that. but...
let me see if I got this straight.
I come to you...
I come to you with what may be...
the preeminent discovery of the 20th Century:
the possibility of extra-solar life.
and I get shitcanned for it?
I know how important this is.
but searching for E. T.s in this political environment...
is a tough sell on Capitol Hill.
if we don't start spending money on harder science. we're going to lose it.
let's forget about me for a second. What about the signal?
I'm skeptical.
but it is interesting.
I'll pass it along to decoding.
see if there's a pattern recognition there. but...
I don't have to tell you. You know the rule.
if you can't confirm it... - Then it doesn't exist.
what asshole made up that rule? Can we fire him instead?
it doesn't please me...
to be losing the brightest and the best.
I wish there was another way. I honestly do.
well. it is finally cooling off in the Southland...
after a day of near-record temperatures.
but hot again tomorrow and hot again on Thursday with no letup...
how are you doing for money? If you need me to. I could...
no. There's a SETI program up north.
guy who runs it. Bill Wyatt. was begging me to come up.
might call him.
you're not really thinking about going back to it. are you?
we had a bell ringer this morning. Really good signal.
I just couldn't confirm it in time.
you had something really good last year too.
turned out to be what? A broken microwave oven.
what's your point? There's always something to give me false hope?
that I'm wasting my life? - I didn't say that.
but. you know. it's interesting that you did.
come on. Someone is watching.
what?
how in the hell did I wind up with somebody like you?
I got tired of rich guys with good futures.
no. Really. What is it you see in me?
what made you call me the first time?
boy. when their self-worth goes...
okay. I see a man of great intelligence...
dedication. cute little kind of insecurity.
a little paranoia... - This went to shit fast.
why do we always have to analyze everything? Can't you trust I love you?
algorithms I trust. Boolean logic I trust.
beautiful women. they just mystify me.
two years and we're still talking about trust? It's amazing.
I should shut the hell up. huh?
look. it's your career. I will support any decision you make.
but if we are going to make it...
we've got to take care of our problems here on planet Earth.
that is just a little hard when you're always off looking at the stars.
listening.
listening.
are we falling apart here? Is that it. Char?
I don't know. Zane.
are we?
how'd you do on the test?
how'd you do on the test?
no. I'm saying it's incomplete. There's no chemical breakdown.
there's no broadband chart analysis. Want me to go on?
that information isn't available at this time.
this information was promised me two months ago.
these are not national secrets.
this is a routine analysis of the atmosphere. Why should l...
there's a problem with that satellite. It's blind to certain trace gases.
Really? As of when?
it lost a solar panel. Some functions were shut down to save energy.
look. here's my problem.
I've devoted my sabbatical to greenhouse trace gases.
if I don't get this data. I might as well be counting cow farts in Montana.
you'll have to wait until the new satellite is in place.
when's the launch date? - NASA doesn't have that information.
round and round we go. Thanks for naught.
Moffet Field.
bill Wyatt. Zane Zaminsky. How are you. man?
Oh. yeah. Zane. Hi.
I know you said you'd get back to me. but I felt obligated...
to let you know about a job offer that came up.
telecommunications. Looks pretty sweet too.
the health plan alone. you know.
well. good. You should take it. Zane.
I don't think things are going to work out here.
but I thought you were looking for radio astronomers?
some good creative thinkers? Isn't that what you said?
creative's one thing. Too creative's another.
I'm not tracking.
I'm not sure I should be saying this.
I talked to Phil Gordian at J. P.L.
the indication was... - Just say it.
he said you were faking signals in order to keep your job.
I do believe this permit's expired.
why haven't you?
to raise the temperature of the planet tenfold...
to raise the temperature of the planet tenfold...
to change the atmosphere into one suitable to colonization...
to construct farms and cities...
and build an infrastructure capable of supporting thousands of colonists.
make no mistake.
never before have we undertaken a task...
have we undertaken a task of this size.
the terraforming of Mars. - Do you know who Phil Gordian is?
the key to all of this is polar ice.
enough heat-generating factories could be built.
the heat would be enough to melt...
excuse me. But perhaps you'd care to use the microphone?
Yes. Yes. I would.
Thanks.
Phil Gordian? Has anybody seen him?
I'm looking for Phil Gordian.
anybody seen Phil Gordian?
the man was in the middle of a seminar. Zane.
why don't we step outside? Let him finish.
did you even give it to decoding? Did you even see what was there?
why don't we take this outside?
if you're not going to analyze it. I want my tape back.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're referring to.
why don't you show me how smart you are by leaving right now?
what's going on. huh? What are you doing this for?
back it up. Let's go. -Why are you telling them lies about me?
I said. now! Let's go! - Why?
come on. Let's go. - Why?
I'm sorry. He's a troubled young man. A very troubled young man.
my apologies. Please. Continue.
where was I? Polar ice.
after the polar ice has been melted...
the atmosphere begins to grow thicker.
finally. a kind of critical mass is reached.
at this point. the atmosphere begins to work for us.
station Five. - Tell me I'm not losing my mind.
just tell me. - Zane. where are you?
they're acting like it never happened. I saw Gordian.
it's like we never gave him any tape.
listen. Zane... - But then I remembered.
it should be on the backup DAT system. We should have a copy of the signal.
well. yes and no.
there are some D. O.D. guys here...
going through our stuff as we speak.
apparently. it was a burst from a spy satellite.
what? - It's a defense thing.
which is probably why Gordian couldn't tell us about it.
we weren't cleared for this spy shit.
Cal. listen to me very carefully.
satellites do not move like stars move.
we tracked this thing in stereo time. in star time. okay?
I don't know who these guys are. but I do know they're lying to you.
is this everything?
if you haven't told them about the backup system. don't!
we have it all?
don't you tell them. Cal! Don't you dare!
there...
there's a backup system.
Hey.
so if this was a spy bird. why was it moving like a star?
not really sure. We'll have to get back to you on that.
it's a very aggressive company. With the federal mandate for air bags...
it's a very aggressive company. With the federal mandate for air bags...
they are perfectly positioned to dominate the market for years.
blade Co. Technologies.
all right. I'll send you a prospectus. Are you at the same address?
Doug. can I call you back in. say. ten minutes?
so I get this signal. - How about 5: 00?
signal from an F-class. - 5: 15.
like our sun but hotter.
first they act like it's nothing. - Great. Thanks.
now they're going to unimaginable pains to make it disappear.
I thought you had a new job.
something is going on here. Char.
why the hell would they do that? What is it they're trying to hide?
maybe we could talk later.
I need to talk about this now!
I called last night twice. - I got the messages.
I thought the problem was I wasn't around enough.
now that I am. you're not. What is this. Tales From The Dark Side?
I have been avoiding this. Yes.
okay. Define "this.
the brokerage is strongly suggesting I head up the office in San Diego soon.
it'd mean moving there. - Can you tell them no?
thank you. I tell you I'll support any career decision you make.
but when it comes to my work... - You're considering this?
char. it's Mr. Morgan on line five.
And?
I got to take this.
by any chance is he going to San Diego also?
why don't you stick your paranoia back in your pants and get out of here?
I will call you. - Fine. No problem.
when? - Whenever I get to it.
Tuesday? Wednesday? A. M? P. M?
go!
right now.
they could be talking to us right now.
an array.
phased array.
good morning. Mr. Carbiner. I'm Horace with your local satellite company.
good morning.
can I see your dish?
what a glorious morning. Hot enough for you?
for a limited time. we're offering a free upgrade on a totally automated...
fiber-optic control system.
all this at no extra cost to you. No extra cost to you.
one of the many ways we're improving the quality of service to our customers.
can I see your dish?
Jesus!
what are you doing here? And how soon can you leave?
what are you doing here? - I live here. Do you mind?
I mind you grabbing on me. Let go!
I'm trying to help you down. - I can do it myself!
my butt is stuck. - You live next door.
with Mrs. Roosevelt. That it?
I live in L. A. Just kicking it here a minute.
I don't want anybody nosing around here.
if I were going to steal your stuff. it would be over and done.
what do you know about my stuff?
what are you doing climbing roofs at 1: 00 in the morning?
shouldn't you be out tagging freeway signs?
I don't got to tell you shit.
fine. Hang there all night.
Hey! Where you going? Get me down.
what are you doing? I told you to wait downstairs.
what's this?
it's a cooling jacket for a low-noise amp. Don't touch it.
what's that blinky shit over there?
will you just sit down? Put this on your ankle.
I don't want that thing. It's cold.
just keep your butt down...
your foot up and your mouth shut.
you can watch. but don't touch anything.
what are them dots?
they're satellite dishes. Each one.
you string enough of them together. it makes one big radio antennae.
what's it do?
it lets you get close to the stars.
see if you get 92. 9. K-BUMP.
greetings from beyond the solar system.
that. my friend. is Voyager 2. - What's that?
voyager is a planetary probe launched in the mid-'70s.
they don't teach science in school anymore?
too busy patting us down to see if we're strapped.
I assume you mean guns. They find one on you?
not me. Just everyone else.
that's how come the folks want me out of L. A. Crazy stuff going on.
can I come in now?
so. this is the star. Wolf 336.
we check the spectra at different magnifications...
looking for anything unusual.
but. unfortunately. all we find is the typical radio noise of an F-class star.
but you talked to them before. huh? The aliens? This channel?
this star. this frequency.
but we can't really talk. It takes years for a radio wave to get here.
so all we can really do is just listen.
but what'd they say? Before.
maybe how to live forever.
maybe how to make nuclear power safe.
I don't know. Maybe they were just ordering out for a pizza.
we won't really know what they're saying.
not at first. But that doesn't make it less important.
if I can confirm this signal. if we can find it again...
then we will finally. finally know that we're not alone.
I wonder what they're going to look like.
warning: Your sleep period is over.
get out of bed.
Jesus! - You going to try again? Tonight?
if you are. I could wait up and help some this time.
didn't tell anybody about our little clubhouse. did you?
what am I? New?
what about your grandma? She doesn't care if you stay up late?
not after 10: 00. - What happens at 10: 00?
she passes out on cough syrup.
tell you what. whenever I'm up there. you can come over.
but only. only if you got the proper I. D.
where I get that?
what about me. huh? When can I do something?
okay. Hit that key.
what one? - That one.
this one here? - Yes.
are you sure it's okay? - I'm sure it's okay.
this one right under my finger? - Give me your badge. You're fired.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
what's this signal going to look like? - It's just a spike.
a big one or a little one? Because I got a big one.
that's it.
that's exactly what Calvin and I saw.
come back!
I didn't touch nothing. okay?
that's the same thing. Same signature. same periodicity.
what the hell?
what is that lambada shit? - It's got to be a bounce.
radio wave kicks off the inversion layer. comes back in through the system.
it's coming from Earth?
some Mexican radio station on the same frequency tells us...
where the bounce came from. but it doesn't...
but it's wack. All of it?
wait a second.
the first signal was definitely sky based. We verified it.
but this one is Earth based. Two identical signals.
one comes from space. the other from Earth.
I'm all screwed up here.
it doesn't make any sense.
unless they're talking.
last night you were telling me we couldn't talk because it'd take years...
Cal. I got to talk to Cal.
I don't know. Somebody said something about a faulty heater.
carbon monoxide. - Really?
taking him to County. - Yeah. sure. but this guy's D. O.A.
what have we got here?
huge concentrations of trace gas in Central Mexico. Ecuador. Brazil.
look. You can see for yourself.
700%increase over the last five years?
how can that be? - My very question.
how accurate is this data you sent us. Ilana?
it's hard to say. We cobbled it together from ground stations...
weather balloons. Uncle Earl's aching corns.
some of your numbers are there.
no satellite data? - NASA's bird has a bum wing.
you've obviously got some ratty data.
we checked this as best we could.
George. run me a future cast. will you?
say. ten years. assuming the same increase.
of course.
this had better be wrong.
according to this. we're looking at an increase of 12 degrees Centigrade...
over the next decade. and that's just...
catastrophic. - I was going to say impossible.
but. yes. that too.
central Mexico.
excuse me. - You come to see the ruins. my friend?
I take you to some much very good places.
let's just head for town.
when does it start to cool off down here?
in San Marsol? This is cool off.
this dial right?
right. left. Both ways.
this radio station? You know where this is?
very far. Not close to town.
let's go there.
how about the ruins? You want to see the ruins?
the radio station. I need to go there. I'm going to talk to the people.
Accidente. he say. But no persons was here...
when the fire come last night.
I'm too late.
one day too late.
Posada San Marsol.
one of our much very best hotels.
you see those?
these TV dishes.
you know of any big ones? - Big?
big. Not small like these. but big.
fifty. sixty feet wide. Big.
one of our very much best hotels.
this is Peter Dowling from Sierra Satellite.
just wondering if you were sick or dead or something.
cause if you're not. you're fired. Sorry. pal.
Yeah. Zane. this is Doug.
I heard about you and Char. I heard it was skidsville.
I'm sorry to hear that. I know what it feels like.
if you want to get together anytime. let's do it.
we'll talk it through. I'm there for ya. man. okay?
and would you mind if I got her number?
I want to talk to her about some investment possibilities.
all right? Thanks.
I called this morning. Just didn't leave a message.
are you there?
I guess I didn't get back to you that night...
because I was mad. Zane.
I get so tired of being questioned about even the basic things.
I was feeling guilt too for steering you away from what you should be doing...
from what you love the most.
but you were such an ass the last time we talked.
damn. I can't remember if this machine lets you ramble...
so I better just admit this quick.
I miss your weird paranoid brain.
call when you can.
where are you. Zane?
move!
so just who the hell are you. huh?
because I saw you in town.
I saw you at the airport.
you were waiting for me.
you knew. didn't you?
how the...
where do you hide a 20-meter dish?
research.
Jesus! - Hey!
excuse me. Excuse me. What's going on here?
I don't know. These guys are stealing my stuff.
they're taking my equipment. I was trying to work here.
excuse me. What?
take it easy. Will you guys take it easy?
I know I should say thanks.
but that was a pretty dicey stunt you pulled back there.
you could have got us both shot.
you're welcome. and you're right.
I saw you in town last night. didn't I?
Zane Zaminsky. Am I still bleeding?
a little. Ilana Green.
Damn! It's hot in here.
think they'd have air-conditioning in this place.
I don't like blood.
why were they rousting you?
something about my gear they don't like.
what is all that stuff? - It's technical.
it looks like some kind of radiosonde for atmospheric sampling.
that's right.
that's absolutely right.
just who are you?
can I ask what I've done wrong?
I wish to apologize to you both.
we have overreacted in this matter.
as for the equipment. it seems to be ruined. If you give me a local number...
wait. Why was I detained? Why did these men take my gear?
you were on private land. - Isn't this a public facility?
please try to understand. This is a new type of power station.
with new technology come those who would like to steal it.
you're staying at San Marsol. yes?
what do you mean. "new type"? You still burn fossil fuels. right?
with great efficiency. very few emissions.
what kind of emissions? - I'm not an expert in this matter.
perhaps if you were to leave me a local number...
perhaps if you give me... - Call it a push. Come on.
they say there's a twin for everyone in the world.
that's not it.
roll the genetic dice often enough. they're gonna land on top of each other.
trust me. Ilana. That is not it.
nice of them to bring our cars here.
follow me back to town. and don't make any stops. all right?
I understand you do residential work.
I've got a little weeding problem I'm hoping you can help me with.
it's really a very small job.
here's the address.
we saw Gulf hurricanes in March.
right now there's a drought in the Sudan. killing thousands.
so we're talking global warming. right?
yes and no.
yes in that we show an increase in global temperature over the last decade.
it's not much. but if you factor out the cooling effects of volcanoes...
it's happening.
our factories can't pump out 7 billion tons of CO2 a year and not do damage.
this is the Arctic?
ninety miles from the Pole.
what's it doing there?
taken by itself. it's just another anomaly.
but as a whole... The Arctic is very sensitive to environmental change.
that's why we go there. Things happen first in the Arctic.
it's like a window on the future.
so you're talking about something a lot bigger than global warming.
I see some major climatic ordeal happening.
God.
I get so damned apocalyptic when I drink.
but you have to remember. every major turning point on this planet...
including the demise of the dinosaur. began with a shift in climate.
even a ten degree increase...
will melt 70%of the polar icecap...
wipe out all agriculture.
raise the temperature of the planet to change its atmosphere...
into one suitable to colonization.
Terraforming. - What is that?
this guy at J. P.L... he's been giving talks about Mars...
and how its whole environment could be changed...
and how we can terraform it and then live there.
it'll never happen. of course. It'd cost hundreds of billions.
but he did say something about...
after the polar ice has been melted...
the atmosphere again grows thicker.
finally. a kind of critical mass is reached.
what?
I don't know.
we might give him a call if it's not too...
Jesus. I did the time warp dance here.
before I go around saying the sky is falling or even warming...
I've got to get new gear from N-CAR.
when do you leave? - First thing in the morning.
you? - I don't know yet.
I still haven't seen everything I need to see.
maybe a couple of days.
I must say. Zane. I really enjoyed our talk tonight.
it's uncommon to find someone who can grasp the things I'm passionate about.
Yeah. I hear you.
where you staying?
I was in room 302 at the big pink place...
until it merged with room 402.
some kind of an accident? - Everything is lately.
how is this dump? - It's not bad with the lights off.
maybe I'll get a room. - Well. look.
I'm gone early in the morning.
why don't you stay here now and keep the room tomorrow?
you mean. share it?
there is a couch.
we could at least keep the appearance of respectability.
I suppose we could.
not that I don't find the proposition intriguing.
not that you just propositioned me. Did you?
boy. that's a lot of guilt for someone who hasn't done anything yet.
I take it there's a warm body in bed at home.
out of my bed. still in my head.
I don't know.
I make things happen.
I made lights explode.
I shattered a skylight.
you did?
how did we do that?
what's the trick?
once you teach your mind to alter
the positive and negative polarity of the cells in your body
the glass will move. - Not the glass.
the water inside it.
she looks happy.
that's not me.
I think it could be you someday.
how could you be my father?
it's time you learned the truth about who you really are.
Kyle's very special, but you already know that.
all he's ever wanted was to be a part of your family.
to Kyle, this is home.
a new day.
the future full of promise.
now that my family knew all of my secrets,
I felt free,
like I could do anything.
even while facing the future,
I knew there were some lessons from the past worth remembering.
as Adam taught me,
I was able to manipulate the polarity of the cells in my body,
using my own water content against the water on the ground,
like two magnets fighting to come together.
Kyle?
beautiful day.
I spoke to Amanda yesterday.
she's doing great.
Yes. Yes, she is.
have a nice day.
Mrs. Bloom thinks I can levitate.
can you? - Not exactly.
I was trying to do something Adam taught me,
and I think she saw.
you have to be careful, even in our backyard.
especially with a neighbor like Carol Bloom.
we have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
well, just take the high road.
do your best to avoid her.
have you spoken to her since she moved in with Taylor?
no. I still don't believe he's her father.
she doesn't have a real father.
she's another pod child like you.
genetically, she does match Taylor.
Yeah, but there are ways to fix paternity tests.
we know that from the Petersons.
well, until we can prove otherwise,
I'm afraid we can't take any action.
is it really any of our business?
well, I want to be sure she's in the right situation.
and living with Brian Taylor isn't.
he lied when he brought Kyle back to us.
he was involved with Ballantine at Madacorp.
I know you're concerned abut Jessi,
and if she needs our help, we're here.
but this family needs to focus on what's ahead.
Agreed?
agreed.
so what the hell are we supposed to talk about?
career days?
second best thing to summer break.
Why?
half days of school, dude.
free ride on the party express.
we're supposed to be browsing the career booths
contemplating our futures.
what's to contemplate?
self-made millionaire.
homeless street musician.
global superhero.
let's waste some time!
he's right. these things are a waste of space.
why does Madacorp have a booth here?
don't worry. they do every year.
what the hell is Hillary doing?
coming at you from Beachwood's annual career fair,
I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.
Hello, fabulous friends!
I thought that TV reality show rejected you already.
Oh, reality TV is so five minutes ago.
I'm on a new path.
sexy high school correspondent.
I'm gonna be the "queen of fabulous."
do they have a booth for that?
when did he get funny?
think about it.
Paris, Nicole, the "lonely15" chickie.
they're all famous because they're hot and visible.
it's not that hard.
that is both valid and delusional all at the the same time.
a few video blogs in the school's web site,
and I'll be on my way to world-wide notoriety.
did you hear that? it's "party thirty."
Preston hid a few of his treats inside his gym locker.
now that is fabulous.
Kyle, are you coming? - Oh, no.
remember the puker from Declan's party?
this guy.
Eww! then none for you, little cupcake.
Bye!
Lori was right.
I could do whatever I wanted.
engineering. Architecture.
medicine.
I had spent my life figuring out who I was,
and now was my chance to figure out who I could become.
so what's a hottie like you doing in a place like this?
is that what counts for a pick-up line on your planet?
only for girls with pink hair.
I shudder to think what the redheads get.
what do you think?
I think you should wait to see if you actually lose your hair
before you start wearing a wig.
meanwhile, let's bust out of here.
And?
lock ourselves in the bathroom
and play G-Force.
Nah.
when have you ever turned down an opportunity to kick my ass?
I wanna take a look around.
you mean, like, job search?
why so skeptical?
it would be just my luck to blow off the career fair, get cured of cancer, and be totally unprepared for my future.
okay.
is there something wrong with me believing
I'll live to see my first crappy adult job?
Nope. - You hate the wig, don't you?
hate it. - And you think I'm ugly.
you're ugly, and you're disease-ridden.
I never want to touch you again.
you're totally getting the hang of me.
it's our thing, remember?
Mr. Trager. Leaving so soon?
I was just going to the bathroom.
of course you were.
why am I not surprised that this fair holds no interest for you?
Stephen! Wait!
I didn't expect to see you here.
just grabbing a few of my things.
could you just give me a minute?
I know what happened with Ballantine was horrible,
but his agenda was his own, not Madacorp's.
and you were just following orders.
the point is he's gone,
and I'm the one giving orders now.
Congratulations.
can we just put our personal differences aside
and remember that Madacorp is,
and always has been, a great company.
we're making huge strides.
state-of-the-art in every department.
and I want you to stay and continue to contribute.
I'll give you greater creative freedom,
increase your support team and your salary.
you'll do very well at this job.
what we offer here you won't find anywhere else.
I'm counting on that.
are you interested in architecture?
this structure won't support 40 units.
try to move the foundation beams to the center
to offset the weight distribution.
how the hell did you see that?
I read a lot.
Hey. - Glad to be back?
sort of.
how are things going with Taylor?
I know you don't trust him,
but he's taking good care of me.
he told me all about the girl in the picture, Sara.
she was part of the original experiment, just like Adam.
Adam said he was the only one.
not according to Brian.
he said he created me from Sara's genetic material after she died
based on Adam's experiments.
why didn't he mention her?
I don't know.
maybe you can ask him someday.
you didn't mention anything to Taylor about Adam being alive, did you?
no. You told me not to.
I know, but
I'm different now.
you made me different.
if I make you a promise, I'm going to keep it.
okay.
are you as bored as I am?
no.
actually, there's a neurology booth that looked really interesting.
Kyle. - What?
I don't wanna spend the entire day
thinking about what I'm gonna do 20 years from now.
well, what do you want to do?
just get out of here for a bit.
wanna come with?
come on.
my first day back, and I'm already suffocating.
you didn't exactly get a right start the first time around.
but it's a new beginning.
I think you'll learn to like it here.
well, everything we need to know, we can learn on our own.
not everything.
they definitely can't teach us to do the special things we can do.
have you busted any skylights lately?
haven't felt the urge.
exploded any lights?
been there, done that.
there's so much more we can try.
I mean, don't you ever feel like just busting out
and doing something amazing ever now and then?
I kind of did this morning.
What'd you do?
I sort of levitated.
Really? - Only slightly.
I don't care. Show me how.
I will. But we can't start with that.
you have to work your way up to it.
no, I don't wanna work on anything.
I just wanna do something now.
there's not much we can do up here.
we should get back.
what, to the fascinating career fair?
you never know.
something might inspire you.
fine.
Amanda, hi, it's me
sorry I missed you,
but I've been thinking about you, and I wanted to call
uh...
I'll call you later.
fabulousness confirmed. - Excuse me?
Hello! my newest video blog is on the school's web site,
and it already has over 500 hits.
Wow. That's a big jump from the six who saw your last one.
I know, right?
at this rate, I'll be youtubed by dinner.
shoo shoo! Let the star see her work.
until next time, I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.
who is that ruining my shot?
please tell me you're not joining the wrestling team.
you don't exactly have the body to fill out those little outfits.
it's a punishment for blowing off the career fair,
courtesy of our friendly neighborhood principal.
why do you continually do this to yourself?
cause it's the one thing I'm really good at?
Josh. - What?
hooper's right. I am lazy.
my work ethic does suck, and I really don't care about school.
don't expect me to ride shotgun on your "who is me"
interstate.
you're smart, and you know it.
so get off your ass and start making something of yourself.
I could always follow in Hillary's footsteps
and film myself in a low-cut halter top.
she's got a little more than her d-cup working for her.
she's got "the mystery jumper."
the who?
some video trick.
it looks like someone's jumping off the roof.
what makes you so sure it's a trick?
do you know anyone who can actually jump off a roof?
hard to believe I'm being responsible,
but how are we supposed to keep your secret
if she's out there leaping tall buildings in a single...
whatever.
I know it wasn't a smart thing to do,
but I don't think anyone could tell it was her.
I ran a hyper-zoom processor on it,
and I couldn't make out a face, just a female form.
just how I like it.
what?
I'm on empty, dude.
I've already told Andy all my secrets.
if she finds out I'm hiding something, she'll kill me.
I'll talk to Jessi.
Hi, Jessi.
everybody's talking about me.
they're talking about "the mystery jumper."
there's a difference.
what should I do for my next trick?
how about nothing?
why not? it's fun.
no one knows it's me.
no one knows yet.
would it be so bad if they did?
I did something this morning that someone saw.
and by this afternoon, she had told three friends.
and if those three friends tell three more,
by this weekend, I'll have half of Seattle in my backyard
waiting for me to do something extraordinary.
what's so wrong with that?
because then I won't be able to relax in my backyard.
I won't be able to enjoy a quiet breakfast with my family
or a walk in the park with Amanda.
I wanna figure out what I'm gonna do with my life
without people watching me,
always waiting to see what I might do.
at least people would notice you.
Jessi, life shouldn't be about getting noticed.
look around.
that girl over there tosses her hair
every time a new guy walks into the room.
and those guys?
they're pretending to read magazines.
but really they're waiting to see
if the girl wiping the counter is looking at them.
and the girl wiping the counter
is wearing a shirt that's two sizes too small
so that the magazine guys will watch her.
Hillary's decided to make a career out of being fabulous
because girls that look just like her
are on most of the covers of the magazines they sell here.
so do you really think that life isn't about getting noticed?
please, Jessi.
for me.
no more tricks, okay?
promise?
I promise.
this message goes out to whoever faked that jump.
you're nothing but a circus act.
a one-hit wonder.
by tomorrow, you'll be forgotten,
and I'll still be here.
because I'm Hillary, and I'm fabulous.
we've got a problem.
Jessi was caught on video today
jumping off the school roof.
off the roof?
Yeah.
the whole school's trying to figure out how it was done.
which one is it? - What do you mean, which?
well, they are two.
the last one was posted an hour ago.
when lounging by the pool this spring,
it's important for guys to know
that board shorts are nothing more than manly.
did she just...
can you do that?
probably.
she has to quit showing off.
the whole world will wanna know about her.
I don't think Jessi would mind that.
but if they know about her,
eventually, they'll know the truth about you.
it should be your choice if and when you want that to happen.
I don't.
not yet.
what are we gonna do?
Hey, look, it's her! she's the mystery jumper!
Jessi.
Jessi, you gotta tell me.
how'd you pull off your last stunt?
stunt?
I studied the footage, and there's, like,
there's no cables or wires.
did you do something CGI?
no, I just...did it.
you ran across water? - Mm-hmm.
I'm not believing that so much, but whatever, I'm totally hooked.
so, our terms are set.
first base, no tongue,
to whoever figures out how the magician did her tricks.
is there any possibility for...second base?
dazzle me and we'll see.
I don't think you should do this.
I'm not really gonna actually let any of them feel me up.
I mean give so much attention to Jessi.
she's a hot story right now.
and if I cover it,
it puts the spotlight
back on me.
how do you think she actually did it?
maybe the better angle is why she did it.
well, that's obvious.
I mean, everyone's dying for their 15 minutes.
you know, fame.
I'm not.
please.
you just need a gimmick.
figure out what makes you special.
how are you different from everyone else?
I'll work on that.
Mr. Taylor.
Mrs. Trager, I'm surprised to see you here.
I'm surprised to be here.
is there a problem?
I'm concerned about Jessi.
Really? what's your concern?
well, first of all, I don't know what your interest is in her.
well, she's my daughter.
scientifically, perhaps,
but there's a lot more to parenting than DNA.
and based on her recent behavior,
you haven't quite gotten a handle on it.
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
she's been getting herself filmed doing things no person should be able to do.
it's on the school web site, the school blog.
you didn't know?
no.
if that gets out, you'll have reporters and photographers,
and whoever else wants to analyze Jessi,
showing up at your door.
it's only a matter of time before that kind of circus leads to Kyle.
I don't want that for him.
I don't want that for Jessi either.
look,
you can't know every little thing your kids are doing.
you can't be with them 24 hours a day.
but you can hold them accountable for their actions.
if you really are Jessi's father,
start acting like it.
there he is!
Hey! hey! hey! Excuse me.
you know that area you caught yesterday?
that saved my firm 10 mil in construction costs.
glad I could help.
no, my boss would love to have a sit-down with you.
a sit-down? - Yeah.
have you ever considered engineering?
I need to learn more about it.
look no further.
back off, folks. I got first dibs.
forget them. Here's your future.
how to become a doctor.
a doctor?
Why?
Hello? so you can save Andy.
Josh
with your mind, maybe you could find a cure for cancer.
I am definitely interested in medicine.
excellent.
and arts and physics and carpentry.
carpentry?
you wanna waste your smarts on lumber?
I think if you wanna help Andy, you should become a doctor.
no offense, dude.
that's the stupidest thing you've ever said.
our brains are the same size.
I just use more of mine.
but it's so easy for you.
I barely passed science.
I'll help you.
I'll take a Madacorp brochure.
Hi.
start with oncology.
On...what-ogy?
why are you here?
madacorp's always looking for students with potential.
and what do you know? I just found one.
I don't want anything to do with Madacorp.
Emily? - Jessi.
I was hoping I'd see you here today.
I don't know if it'll mean much,
but for what it's worth, I wanted to say I'm sorry.
and I wanna make it up to you.
how?
work with me,
and I'll make sure that you're appreciated.
people all over the world will be fascinated by your gifts.
you'd be respected and admired.
I mean, the possibilities are just so exciting.
we should sit down and go through them all.
I'd love to. - No.
why not?
we need to talk.
you know where to find me.
how could you get involved with Emily after everything she did?
you're just angry about the video.
you promised me you wouldn't do anything.
I don't wanna hide who I am.
who you are should be about your character, Jessi,
not about impressing people with the things you can do.
don't tell me what do do anymore.
I'm just asking you to be careful.
I'll do what I want, and I'll be who I want.
you're right.
you do what's best for you...
and I'll do the same.
endless possibilities.
that's what scares me.
Kyle, you'll excel at anything you set your mind to.
you just have to choose what interests you.
it all interests me, that the problem.
maybe you're not destined to do just one thing.
look at Baylin.
he was a scientist, an inventor,
philosopher, writer.
I wonder if he had a nosy neighbor
and an uncontrollable friend.
I'm sure he had his own set of problems.
am I wrong,
judging Jessi for what she's doing?
is it wrong for me to wanna keep this whole life to myself?
I guess that depends on your reasons for wanting to hide it.
I was watching this science documentary with Josh.
Josh watched a documentary?
it was hosted by one of those naked magazine rabbits.
bunnies. Okay, go on.
anyway,
they kept a rat in a cage,
and the scientists kept running tests
and taking its blood and monitoring every mode that it made.
and you don't want that to happen to you.
but then again,
the tests they ran on the rat
helped them get closer to finding answers.
the rat didn't have a choice in the matter,
so why should I?
I mean, I know there's people who don't approve of using the rat in the first place, but
Kyle, you're a teenaged boy.
no one should be allowed to take your life away from you
before you've had a chance to live it.
but why is my life more important than the rats?
because you're the kind of person who thinks to ask that question.
there should be laws against people like her.
pretty in the face, dark in the soul.
please! She's not that pretty.
okay, she's kinda pretty.
here she comes. Try not to drool.
Hey, guys. - Hey.
so you made some new friends.
Oh, yeah. isn't it great?
are you going to Preston's party this weekend?
or didn't you know?
I haven't really seen him, so...
I can't imagine he wouldn't invite you.
whatever. Preston's parties are so yesterday.
Really?
I heard they were... "a-list" only.
well, see ya.
she totally grossed you.
are you going to Preston's party this weekend?
that's my line.
I saw the tapes.
and you're right.
I-I don't know how to handle her.
I know what you must think of me, but...
I wanted to show you that I've come here in good faith.
where did you get this?
the day you sold it at the pawn shop,
I went and bought it back.
I needed to keep it safe
until you realized its importance.
it's a Latnok ring.
that's the symbol.
but if this is the ring that Adam gave me...
whose ring is this?
that's Ballantine's father's.
he was a member as well.
all the members received rings.
it was a way of identifying one another
and the location of their safe house.
and you're a Latnok?
Yes.
I know that you think that I'm a bad guy,
and I cannot deny that I've made some questionable decisions that may not have been in your best interest.
but right now, my main concern is Jessi's behavior.
you don't know anything about her.
how would you describe Adam Baylin?
warm. Brilliant. Caring.
do you use those words to describe Kyle?
Absolutely.
see, Adam came by all of that just naturally.
he had the kind of soul that people just instantly connected with.
Sara, she was different.
and Sara was...
Jessi's mother.
she was beautiful and brilliant and...
stubborn, impetuous, and volatile.
does it remind you of anybody that you know?
you don't have to like me.
but please, don't abandon Jessi.
she deserves better.
as did Sara.
illicit partying, daytime rebellion,
fabulousness uncensored...
Hey! Aren't you in enough trouble?
I've cleaned 87 gym mats.
I'm already in hell. Why stop now?
Where's Andy?
she's chosen this week to be responsible.
responsible during career days?
she's a rebel, what can I tell you?
Declan finally got that ankle of his fixed, huh?
well, well, well.
look at who the arthroscopic cat dragged in.
nice. Make fun of a disabled person.
you hurt yourself fleeing from a villainous mega-corporation.
it's not exactly Helen Keller material.
you could feel sorry for me losing a basketball scholarship.
I've seen your house.
cry me a river, rich boy.
all right.
I hobbled my post-surgical self up here.
what's the occasion?
well, everyone's all aflutter over Jessi, the mystery jumper.
hence roof party.
we're celebrating the fact that Jessi's a maladjusted attention seeker?
no, we're just using it as an excuse to get out of career days.
I'm all for an excuse to avoid the future,
but are we doing about Jessi?
Kyle's adopted a hands-off policy.
he thinks she'll learn her lesson on her own.
I hope he's right.
I've got the battle scars from keeping his identity a secret.
I'm not gonna be so psyched
if Jessi's stunts start making headlines.
Hey, there's the mystery jumper.
Oh, great.
it's Jessi! Ready to wow us with another trick?
I don't do tricks.
come on. Here's your chance.
show everyone what you can do.
don't encourage her. She's a poser.
I'm not a poser.
right! Sorry.
you're a superhero... in schoolgirl's clothing.
don't make fun of me.
HILS, give it a rest.
why are you sticking up for me?
you don't even like me.
gee, I wonder why. - Trager!
now, let's hear all the dirty laundry.
you can't be an attention whore
and protect your privacy.
batgirl over here was the one who beat up Lori.
that-that wasn't me.
the hell it wasn't!
no, I mean- I'm not like that anymore.
of course not, because now you're the "mystery jumper."
I did jump.
total illusion. - Hils, stop.
Lori, she hurt you.
and now I'm gonna expose her for who she really is.
I really don't think that's
fine. I'll do it.
this is not gonna end well.
bad idea, Jessi.
Why?
everybody wants to see how I did it.
I'll show you.
no tricks, no wires.
get Kyle up here now.
Jessi, don't do it.
I've done it before. don't worry about it.
you getting this?
we're rolling. - Right, then.
wait.
what are you doing?
I'm jumping, too.
Kyle, go away!
I wanna show them how easy it is.
it isn't. - You can do it.
because I'm special.
how special are you if I can do it, too?
fine. Do it with me.
I'm gonna jump, too.
what? - You can't.
I'll beat you down there.
no. It's unsafe. You'll get hurt,
then stop.
I know how to do this.
you're ruining it.
back off and let me go.
Kyle
this is Jessi's moment.
thought so!
you got all that, didn't you?
every last humiliating bit.
I guess she did need all the ropes and wires.
another fraud exposed.
how'd you do it?
do what?
she jumped.
the only way out was down.
but she didn't fall.
I saw your face. I know you did something.
the human body is more than 50% water.
And?
that's it.
I-I don't get it.
study up on your science.
you'll figure it out.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you look bad in front of everyone.
they all laughed at me.
I didn't want you to jump.
I didn't want to jump either.
so why did you?
I felt like I was losing their approval.
and...
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
what were you before?
invisible.
Jessi,
you were never invisible to me.
because you know my secret. You know that I'm special.
yes...
you are.
you're smart...
and adventurous and creative.
and you don't need to do tricks for people to see that.
and what if I don't even see it?
if there's one thing I've learned about life,
from being here at this school and with my family,
it's that the people with the most to offer
usually believe in themselves the least.
you don't.
cause I have people that believe in me.
so will you if you let them.
you gotta give it to her.
career days a lot more interesting with Jessi around.
I still vote for shoving her back into the pod.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
what's up with you?
the woman over there from the local cable station?
she saw my blog.
she said I pop on camera!
and she offered me an internship.
Hillary, that is fabulous!
now there'll be no living with you.
back to basics, huh?
enjoy it while it lasts.
I do.
I thought I made it clear that this fair is intended only for those students who are serious about their future.
do you know what? - I got this.
I am serious, Mr. hooper.
maybe you're right about me.
maybe I am lazy, and I lack study skills,
but I've changed,
and I'm gonna do something important with my life
and make a difference.
well,
that's all I wanted to hear.
that's some serious gumption.
is that a good thing?
what got into to?
I made the decision.
I chose a career.
And?
call me Dr. Trager.
Really?
Yeah.
I wanna be the one to save you.
Josh, you realize you're looking at, like,
ten more years of school before you actually become a doctor.
then I guess you're gonna have to stick around for quite a while.
the future was still wide open,
and my choices still seemed limitless.
I knew that someday I might need to use my abilities more openly,
as I had done to help Jessi,
and that my gifts might invite attention.
but for now, I just felt lucky and content,
because I could let my gifts evolve
while I enjoyed the comfort of my home and family.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Bloom.
another beautiful day.
isn't it?
no worries.
decide to call it a night?
I'm pretty tired.
so how was school today?
it turned out okay.
you learn anything interesting?
I learned the most important thing is to be myself.
that's, uh...
that's a good lesson.
sleep well.
Jessi.
I'm glad you're here.
see you in the morning.
all right. Good night.
my mom and I talked,
she won't let me see you outside of school for awhile.
she could be you.
what?
the two of you
used to play that song all the time.
it's not there.
it's their song, d4,
it's the missing record from the jukebox.
where did you get this?
I found it in my room.
I'm trying to book the DJ for an event.
a prom?
you're DJ Spinbrandt?
and I don't do proms.
Oh, my god, I can't believe I got into this whole mess over you!
how sweet is this?
that's awesome.
you're awesome.
you're kind of awesome, too.
maybe I am lazy and I lack study skills,
but I've changed,
and I'm going to do something important with my life
and make a difference.
you don't know how Sarah died.
she was just like you.
trying too much, too fast,
and when she tried something she wasn't ready for, it killed her.
you can't keep doing this to yourself.
promise me you'll stop.
I promise...
I'm going in for my check-up tomorrow,
it'll tell me if I'm better or not.
Andy, everything's going to be okay.
you know, when you say it,
I almost believe it.
when we sleep, the subconscious mind takes over.
our dreams can reveal what's disturbing us in our waking hours,
and there are rare occasions in the state between sleep and consciousness,
when the things that most trouble us
can emerge.
Stephen,
what are you doing?
happy anniversary.
that's the brace I loved at the art fair.
Yeah, I grabbed the designer's card.
I just ruined your surprise.
Hey, it's not the only thing I have up my sleeve.
I'm making us dinner tomorrow night.
and for dessert...
I thought we'd have these.
Kyle, what are you doing up?
I can't tell what it is yet.
I think he's sleepwalking.
Kyle, why are you in the kitchen?
I'm drawing a picture.
should we wake him up?
no, let's just put him back to bed.
I'm not finished yet.
I ran out of wavelengths 640 to 750 nanometers.
frequency 480 to 405 theraherz.
hex triplet number ff0000
what's he saying?
he's basically saying he needs more red.
come on, Kyle.
you need to put them in order.
you can do that in the morning.
okay.
good night.
I guess I really was sleepwalking.
why would I have done that?
maybe you reached a boiling point.
sleepwalking is sometimes a symptom of stress.
I don't feel stressed.
well, that doesn't mean you're not experiencing it.
you're restricted from seeing Amanda,
Adam baylin has basically come back from the dead,
and jesse
is still being jesse.
that's three major relationships in your life
that are asking you to give an unusual amount of emotional energy.
you think that's why I'm sleepwalking?
I think it's...
kind of a drastic reaction to the pressure, but...
Yes, I think you may need to simplify your life a little.
simplify.
back it up!
I won the coin toss.
coin toss?
Yeah, for your brain.
form a line, people.
okay, here's the deal.
placement exams
they're mostly crap.
but they're mandatory, so it must be important to do well.
screw up, and you're looking at summer school.
really screw up, and you have to repeat a grade.
how can I help?
as a result, i'm in desperate need for a trig recap.
a recap?
I haven't exactly paid attention the last semester.
in every subject? not in every subject.
I'm just hung up on a couple of things in biology.
what, does everyone need to study today?
Oh, no, i've already studied.
but I'm entering the prom theme song contest.
losing is not an option.
I'm going to need to tap into your mental thesaurus.
whatever you need.
so, I managed to convince my mom that it wouldn't hurt to have you tutor me for placement exams.
that's great.
I'd be happy to help you study.
Oh, I don't want to study.
I just want an acceptable excuse to spend time with you today.
today.
a whole afternoon of unchaperoned quality time.
you're not free. I should have asked you first.
no, it's fine.
I'd love to spend unchaperoned quality time with you.
good.
and I'm think I'm sensing a thaw where my mom's concerned.
if she's letting us study together, a date can't be too far behind.
so I should ask her if we can go out?
no.
you should ask her to think about considering the idea
whether or not we can go out.
she's a glacier, not an ice cube.
so if I told her that letting us study is symbolic of her trust in me,
and that I'd like to continue to build that trust,
maybe in time I can earn the honor of having a date with you.
Yeah, something exactly like that.
see you later.
Nicole advised me to simplify my life
to avoid distractions and commitments,
but the people I cared about needed me,
and I didn't want to disappoint them.
Kyle! steven, is something wrong?
Yeah, the broth for my bouillabaisse .
impressive, Nicole will love it.
not if she can cut it with a knife.
it should be vaguely in the realm of soup.
could you make something simpler?
it's her anniversary. I want to wow her.
I've never cooked before.
I have a cookbook right here.
it's all the basics in less than 2, 000 pages.
you can swing that, right?
I'll see what I can do.
kill me now.
my headstone can say, "here lies Lori Trager, singer/songwriter,
choked on her own lyrics.
it's a contest for a prom theme song.
tap into your inner girl.
what does make the rest of me?
you know what I mean.
don't let it frustrate you.
I can't help it.
study guide.
I cross-referenced placement test guidelines
with your English class syllabus.
factoring in mid-terms and quizzes
I pinpointed the areas where you should focus
to maximize your study time.
Thanks.
W-w-w-wait!
my turn.
what rhymes with corsage?
there are 12 interims for the word "corsage.
garage, massage,
barrage, mirage,
wait, there's also...
four words is a start.
how's your study guide?
nice.
bio with a focus on human analogy.
anatomy.
that's what I said.
do you hear that?
what is it?
someone's humming.
it's Jessi.
why can I hear her?
a little something called super hearing?
I can only do that when I'm trying.
your point?
I'm not trying.
Alrighty, then.
thanks for this.
we'll get the study group going out to the house later.
is four o'clock cool?
sure.
wait. today? hi.
you were just humming that song.
how did you make it sound so loud?
I didn't. I was just humming.
you must've used the acoustics in here to direct your voice.
have-- have you been sleeping?
you seem kind of worn down.
I do?
there's something wrong with you.
I can feel it.
I just need you to play my song
so I can give it a pure listen and make sure it's going
to mesh with my lyrics.
five minutes and then you can go stop dad
from burning down our house.
um, that's not my song.
I played what you wrote.
play it again.
b flat,
G minor,
I don't even know how to play that chord.
e flat major seven.
F major.
that's not your song.
I'm sorry, I've had this other song stuck in my head all day.
whatever it is, it's pretty.
thanks for bailing me out.
I really want this dinner to be something special.
when you're doing something for someone you really care about...
Jessi was right, there was something wrong with me.
my mind seemed to be playing tricks.
no matter how hard I focused,
I was losing control of my abilities.
and I didn't know why.
well, thanks, Kyle.
you know, you're a natural in the kitchen.
mom, huge problem.
okay, Josh, could you give me, like, five minutes?
Kyle draws weird stuff all the time.
this is an emergency. what's wrong?
how about every answer on the study sheet?
Josh, this is basic high school science.
come on, you've been doing so well.
that's the thing.
I didn't make that.
Kyle did.
when did this happen?
this morning.
Plus, Lori and I both noticed he was being clumsy
and he kept having brain farts.
he's on the fritz. You gotta fix him.
I'm glad you're concerned.
concerned?
I'm flipping out.
I told everyone to come over so kyle can help us study.
what good is he going to be now?
he's like the idiot king of stupid town.
Kyle has a lot on his plate right now, okay?
maybe you can try and study without his help.
or I can find someone as smart as Kyle to fill in.
Yeah, good luck with that.
and I expect you to come straight home for dinner.
Mrs. Bloom.
thank you for letting Amanda come over today.
I'm still not sure it's such a good idea.
however, I suppose the proof will come when amanda's test results are posted.
all right.
I just wanna say that I appreciate your trust in me,
and I want to continue to build that trust.
I hope you know that I plan on working hard at
earning the honor of a date with your giraffe.
I think he meant "date with me."
I should certainly hope so.
that's what I said.
just promise me you'll thank about it.
all right, I'll think about it.
dinner, Amanda.
I'll be on time.
did I say something wrong?
it's not a big deal. you were nervous.
Plus, I think my mom kind of likes making you squirm.
at least we get to spend time together today.
speaking of time together
Josh's study group. I got the text.
I'm sorry.
honestly, I could use a bit of study time.
as long as I get to sit next to you.
Kyle? little help?
that can be arranged.
I just have to finish something in the kitchen.
I'll be waiting.
how's the lobster sauce?
I burned it before. now it's too runny.
I'll give it a try.
I heard lobster.
you keep poking your head in here.
Stephen, I get the whole top secret thing, I really do.
and I appreciate it, but...
will you quit snooping, then?
Kyle and I have it under control.
are you sure about that?
the recipe says you can thicken the sauce by adding flour.
this isn't flour, is it?
maybe you should lie down for a while.
go ahead. I can handle it from here.
but Amanda, she...
I'll just tell her you didn't sleep well last night.
I'm sure she'll understand.
I'll be in my room if anyone needs me.
maybe I was too stressed,
too busy trying to be everything to everyone.
Kyle?
I drew the pictures again.
Nicole?
I only closed my eyes for a minute.
you've been in here for almost an hour.
I checked on you.
you fell asleep at your desk.
whatever is wrong with me? I don't think it's stress
thank god you're here.
I'm already feeling at least ten points above the 50th percentile.
what is she doing here?
Josh called and said you needed help studying.
Kyle's letting you down.
he's not letting us down, he's just
not smart enough today?
I know, but I am.
you ready to get started?
I'm sorry I left you out there.
I think I accidentally fell asleep.
I heard you were tired.
don't worry. The study session's underway.
Josh brought in a ringer.
a what?
he called in Jessi to help.
if you ask me, she seems a little smug about it.
she probably is.
is everything okay?
sure.
I'm just...
you're overloaded.
we all put too much on you today.
but I wanted to be there for everybody.
how about if I'm here for you instead?
that feels nice.
you know... Jessi probably could help you with your geometry theorems.
Kyle.
what?
we're not gonna waste another minute
of our quality time together talking about Jessi.
that's a good idea.
what is it going to take for you to remember?
there's no such thing as the vision system.
the eyes are part of the... nervous system?
get up.
Now...name the six muscles that control eye movement.
lateral rectus.
the medieval rectus.
it's the medial rectus.
Lori. Wanna study with us?
not so much, no.
looks like somebodywent to the two-for-one man sale.
Oh, look. It's my bar fight hero.
not you, sucker punch. You.
Hey, how's the prom shapin' up?
you found any bargain-basement d.j.s yet?
funny. I'm looking at one.
you ought to get your eyes checked, then.
I'm not the one with glasses, four-eyes.
cute.
that insult was so high school.
my dad's in the kitchen.
you should go there.
now.
all right.
what?
Hey, guys, this should be fun.
I can't study on an empty stomach.
I'm gonna go grab a snack.
I have a crappy high school song to write.
I think Lori needs help with her crappy song.
I'll be right there!
stay.
thanks for taking care of this.
I usually go to Kyle with the mechanical problems
I can't take care of myself, but...he's unavailable, so...
it's not a problem. Um, I'll have 'em back to you tomorrow.
great.
uh, is there a bathroom I could use before I head out?
upstairs and to the right.
Ahem. Excuse me.
your ceviche looks perfect, Mr.Trager.
is that fresh cilantro?
Yes, it is.
yummy. What else have you made?
well, you name it, and I've probably wrecked it
already once or twice today.
started out trying to make a bouillabaisse,
and Kyle helped me pare it down from there.
wise choice! It took me three of four tries
uh, Hillary, what was it
you were expecting to study today?
trig. I'd give you the lowdown on Mr.Callahan and his massive shoulders,
but we're not really friends like that yet, are we?
uh, no, not yet. but did you know
that when I was an undergrad I was a double major?
and one of 'em was applied mathematics?
for reals?
cause I'm sensing you need a salad course
that'll stand up to your steaks
without overpowering your lobster.
how about a tomato, orange, and saved fennel salad
with frizzled leeks?
you frizzle, and I'll tutor.
see? I told you it would work out. That was great.
Thanks, but that's not honest criticism.
you're being a friend,
and there are times when I need that from you
or from my mother. This is not one of them.
did you just compare me to your
sorta, kinda, yeah.
sorry.
Hey. DJ boy.
did you hear any of that song?
uh, not really.
come in here.
whoa. What does his opinion matter?
he knows music.
I need a disinterested
yet well-informed party to weigh in.
go ahead, mark. Be completely unfiltered.
no holds barred. Okay.
well, uh, the lyrics were catchy.
none of this weak-ass, college boy,
discussion group bull. Be real.
all right.
you need to work on musical composition.
that's what I'm talking about.
In-you-face gut reaction.
I mean, your fingering's a mess.
you handle a guitar like a-a blunt instrument.
real nice. No, no, it's okay.
come on. more.
there are more than three chords to a pop song.
you know? Just because most people don't use 'em and
you should push yourself to be not so derivative.
right.
Jessi, can I interrupt?
Absolutely. We're not finished.
I'll take over for you.
come on.
over here.
I need you to try and read me.
I read that answer sheet you made for Josh.
that's about all I need to know.
When'd you get so ordinary?
I'm serious, Jessi.
you knew something was wrong with me this morning.
maybe you can get in my head and figure out what's happening.
all right.
I'll try.
you have to try, too. I am trying.
it's like the signal's weak or something.
what did you do?
what do you mean?
you did something. You pushed.
that's not fair.
I-I didn't do anything.
you made me promise not to push myself,
and then you go out and do something new?
tell me what it is.
this isn't a game, Jessi.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I could really be
you're the best. Did you know that?
I guess I do now. What's this for?
the other day, when I was nervous about my tests
to see if the cancer was gone
I don't really know you, but
anyway, you were just there. It's like...
you knew I needed a hug.
I don't really know you, either!
Oh. It's okay. Hugs are good.
what's all the lovin for?
I was gonna text. Too impersonal.
then I was gonna call, but again, digital.
this is a strictly analog moment that should be shared with real-time hugs and gushy feelings.
my test results are back. I'm officially in remission!
what did you do?
you did it. You cured her.
that's impossible. why?
because it is.
I healed my hand. Adam Baylin
healed himself when he was shot.
it's not the same, Jessi.
Andy's cancer was blood-related.
manipulating blood cells to heal a cut...
that's not that far off from what you'd have to do.
but I didn't try to do anything.
I just wanted to make her feel better.
an emotional trigger...
which is how we always discover new abilities.
Yes, but it-- why are you always
trying to deny what we're capable of?
can you just stop yelling?
I'm not.
it's pounding in my head.
you're messed up.
you did something that taxed your system.
now your system is punishing you.
look what happens if we're not strong enough.
Jessi, I can't do this right now.
everyone out there is relying on me.
for study groups? cooking?
you and I are so much more than that.
I don't wantto be so much more!
I wantto help Josh ace his exams...
Lori write her song, and Steven prepare the perfect dinner for Nicole.
I want to spend the afternoon with Amanda.
I want to be there for them...
be the person they need me to be.
mediocre.
you wouldn't understand.
you're right.
I wouldn't.
Jessi, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
we should, uh-- you should get back out there.
I'm sure everyone's wondering where you are.
I really have to go. My moms are taking me out to celebrate.
pizza and batting cages.
I should get back to studying.
I'm glad I'm not with cancer girl anymore.
well, I guess that means you need a new t-shirt.
I really have to go.
HILS, I'm gonna take off.
what about the study session?
not feelin' it.
Where's Lori?
upstairs. Mark gave here some feedback on her prom song. My t.a. Mark?
apparently, he's some all-knowing musical big shot.
you're kidding. is he still here?
no. He left.
And...he's a little obnoxious, if you ask me.
okay. All right, uh, where were we?
Um...right. A cord
is just a straight line drawn between two points
on a curve.
okay, Mr.Trager.
I think we're friends now.
can I be honest?
sure, But could Mr.callahan wait?
it's not about him. It's about mark.
I'm not so sure Lori should get involved with an older man.
an older-- w-what-- uh, did I miss something?
apparently everything.
once upon a time, Lori and Declan were leclan.
they were joined at the hip.
then they weren't.
personally... I think they're meant to be.
wait. So how does my t.a. enter the picture?
Oh, come on, like you haven't noticed.
No...I haven't.
well, snarky Mark's a hottie in dork's clothing,
but I don't think Lori's seeing it just yet.
she has no idea their aggro-flirting
is thinly disguised sexual tension.
Sexual-- what...
ex-- exactly are you talking about?
sexual nothing!
what I meant was, could you pass the sherry vinegar?
Hey, dad. Good news made Josh hungry.
son, I'm happier for you than I've ever been,
but if you touch my ceviche, I will kill you.
is Kyle okay? He disappeared into his room again.
hopefully, he's in there getting smarter.
I'm fine.
good. He's all yours.
it's been a pleasure, Mr.Trager.
bon appetite!
no more study session?
let's just say I learned some things
I'm not sure I wanted to know.
are you feeling better?
I am now.
Kyle, you all right?
Yeah. what can I do to help?
we're pretty good here.
hillary was surprisingly helpful.
Uh...Josh, how's biology?
the medial rectus. Jessi made sure I'll never forget it.
not much, but there's no way I'm failing that test.
okay, at least let me set the table.
okay.
do you need any help?
plates.
thanks for helping.
Kyle. what's happening?
Kyle! Oh, no!
just step back. Dad!
dad?
it's gonna be ok
you're back so soon?
Kyle's not feeling well.
well, if he felt he was coming down with a bug,
he shouldn't have offered to tutor.
you could've caught some...
thing.
I remember that song.
I haven't heard it in forever. How do you know it?
Kyle needed it to get through something once.
he loves it when I play.
maybe it'll help him now.
Amanda's music was a comfort.
but I still felt lost and confused.
I knew steven and Nicole were worried...
not sure how to help me.
all of us were hoping
that answers were on the way.
you ready? no.
hello. I'm-- Adam Baylin.
it's so good to finally meet you.
we've heard a lot about you.
come in. Thank you.
this is, uh, my husband-- Steven.
and Nicole.
Kyle speaks very fondly of you.
well, he's told us a lot about you, too.
Yeah.
not about the resemblance.
uh...it's pretty striking.
I didn't try to heal Andy.
I wouldn't. You cautioned me against pushing myself.
well, using your mind
to affect another person's physiology
is conceivable... someday.
but I don't think it's possible
at this stage of your development.
Yet...you're experiencing strange symptoms.
especially my hearing.
sounds are louder... distorted.
there must be a link between what you're hearing and what you've been drawing.
where did you get this?
uh, someone left it for Jessi.
we don't know who.
it was missing from the jukebox when we went to the diner.
well, have you listened to it?
Yes. How often?
a lot lately.
I like it. It relaxes me.
listen again.
you don't hear anything else.
am I supposed to be hearing something?
listen carefully.
how can you study when your whole life just changed?
Andy threatened me with my life if I blew off placement exams
just because she's in remission.
she's tough.
Yeah, and without the chemo to make her weak,
she could actually kick my ass.
I'm just trying to distract myself from figuring out what's going on at home.
you too, huh?
why'd they kick us out when things were getting good?
I wanted to get a look at the mad scientist who brewed up Kyle.
you say it like that, it sounds kind of creepy.
you know what I mean.
the dude's smart.
I just hope he can help Kyle figure out
what's up with his power outage.
and all the mental brown-outs.
and all the clumsiness.
all the drawings in primary colors.
Lori?
Hey.
you left this sweater.
Yeah, and I brought you this.
what, did you take it upon yourself to rewrite my song?
well, "rewriting" implies you had more than four chords in it to begin with.
I'm a three-chord wonder, remember?
you're also a great lyricist.
like, rock-my-world poetic
and funny and unexpected.
you like my lyrics? I do.
I mean, every time I try to write my own, I kind of just
handle the english language like a blunt instrument?
hmm.
so, you want to help me with the music.
and you're going to wow me with the lyrics.
I'd be happy to do that in exchange for...
I DJ the prom.
you're killing me.
consider it a launching platform for our hot new single.
Lori trager, high school girl.
you have a deal.
Adam thinks this record has something to do with what's wrong with me.
what is it about this song?
well, it's not the song.
it's the sounds buried beneath the music.
can you hear them?
no, I still can't.
I can't either.
well, you wouldn't be able to perceive them, Nicole.
they're subliminal.
it's not a frequency you'd be able to hear,
but Kyle should.
this is why you're feeling peculiar,
and why your hearing is exaggerated.
your subconscious is trying to tell you to listen.
listen?
that's what the instant message said.
you need to clear your mind,
block out any outside sound.
focus.
I can hear it now.
Sarah and I used to take this record and bury messages for each other within the music.
it was our secret game.
we'd translate the sounds into images.
how?
just like a fax machine transmits a series of tones
to send a copy.
I fell asleep listening to the record last night,
and then again this afternoon.
and each time after listening, you drew those pictures.
they all seem so random.
well, yes, if you look at them individually.
but blended together...
Adam, if someone is sending Kyle a message this way...
I mean, you said it was your secret game with Sarah,
and I'm sorry, but I thought Sarah was dead.
she does
all the drawings have been scanned and put in order.
we're ready. Good.
so let's hook it up so everyone can see.
so, how does this work?
isn't it just going to be a bunch of blobs in widescreen format?
more like a flipbook.
we'll use the computer to view all 450 images in rapid succession.
and our eyes will knit together the individual drawings
and the colors will blend.
we'll see what it is I'm supposed to see.
try speeding it up.
no problem.
Latnok.
I'm alive.
I gave Sarah a latnok ring with a red stone.
it was one of a kind.
then she must have sent this.
it's impossible.
she can't be.
Hey.
bet you're looking forward to a good night's sleep.
I am.
Oh, before I forget, happy anniversary.
I'm sorry I got in the way of your dinner.
no worries, Kyle.
this was definitely a memorable one.
it was? Well, sure.
we had a house full of teenagers,
a sick kid, a cancer remission, a secret message,
and a visit from a self-healing genius back from months in a coma.
how was it for you?
meeting Adam.
well, I know I said he was welcome here anytime,
but I did actually have some anxiety about it.
he's not used to being around other people,
and the message bringing up
all those feelings about Sarah
Kyle, you don't have to make excuses for him.
it's just that you're both such an important part of my life.
we'll find a way to coexist.
don't start worrying about how Adam will get along with the family.
you'll stress yourself out.
so what was it that made you anxious?
Adam left us in charge with preparing you for some greater purpose,
and all I could show him today was a sick boy.
you were right about calling him.
doesn't every good doctor call in a specialist?
I'm glad that I did.
but I don't think I'm supposed to know
how to handle every situation.
you're too special for me to be able to handle all that.
Nicole...
I think you're special enough to handle it all.
Ugh.
hasn't everybody we know already been here today?
Amanda says you were coming down with something.
you look fine to me.
I was just tired, that's all.
did I do something wrong?
something happened while Amanda was over here.
really, nothing did.
she came home and played the piano.
my daughter hasn't struck a note
since she came back from the conservatory.
not one single note until today.
she did it because she knows you love her playing.
you have no idea how much I've missed it.
I've missed it, too.
well, whatever you did, thank you, Kyle.
I'll have to make an effort to be less wary of you,
even if you did come from a juvenile detention center.
Mrs. Bloom.
yes?
I know it's a lot to ask, but...
could I take Amanda to the prom?
we'll see.
and by that, I mean I will think about it.
maybe.
Yes.
and don't you ever strong-arm me like that again, young man.
fortunately, this food survived your little pyrotechnic display.
I have no clue what it is,
but I think someone needs to sample it.
uh, Stephen made that special for Nicole.
And?
and maybe you should wait till leftovers?
so, all your mental wires are in place again?
I think so. Good.
I had enough of Kyle unplugged.
I mean, I was getting kind of worried about you.
well, I'm fine now, so nothing to worry about.
that's great news about Andy.
Yeah! amazing!
she told me she felt better after you hugged her.
everyone feels better after a hug.
but then your system went all out of whack.
it was just a reaction to the message in the song.
you can say what you want,
but I'd like to think that you helped her.
I spent the day unable to be there for the people I cared about the most,
yet everyone worked to help each other when I couldn't help them or myself.
the problem was never that I'd taken on too much
or caused myself stress.
it was only that I didn't see
the simplest way to solve a problem
is to be sure you have someone to help you.
pretty good.
Oh, yeah.
will you go to the prom with me?
Yes, I would love to go with you.
you don't wear a tuxedo to a funeral. You wear one to a prom.
didn't you once tell me that going to a prom
would be a fate worse than death?
I'm not asking you to go to prom 'cause there's no one else.
I'm asking 'cause you are the only one I want to go with.
are you telling me there are problems with the prom?
prom committee's become a nightmare of mix-ups with the decorators
and arguments with the caterers.
I want prom to be this perfect night with Kyle,
and all I can think about is table and chair rentals and non-refundable
deposits.
well, you should enter this in the contest.
I suppose.
although I'm sure three-chord trite piece of crap will win.
Brian told me all about the girl in the pictures, Sarah.
he said he created me from Sarah's genetic material after she died.
my name is Sarah. - She's alive.
she wants to meet me, right?
Sarah said she'd be here. - She's not coming.
I'm alone! - You're not alone.
Jessi!
her heart has stopped.
it's okay now. I'm here.
the people in latnok aren't bad, they're simply scientists
with a very clinical point of view.
he's incredible.
more than we'd ever dreamed we'd see in our lifetimes.
what are you watching?
if you're not back by midnight,
you won't be coming home.
that's not good.
why on earth would you watch prom night? It's scary.
it's video research for the prom.
you're researching the prom?
and it led you to prom night?
it had the most straightforward title.
what else did you look at?
44 movies, 2.6 million websites, and 37 young-adult novels.
pm is the most romantic moment in a young person's life.
it's the culmination of adolescence
and marks the beginning of the journey into adulthood.
Pricilla's Perfect Prom. I love that book!
I wasn't always a cynic.
I know how important it is to Amanda.
I can't let her down.
I just need the perfect plan.
there's really no formula for perfection.
let me let you in on a little life secret.
the more you expect, the more you get let down.
Pricilla's prom was a disaster.
her date leaves her at the end of the night.
two chapters later, he's gay.
nice pep talk.
just focus on having fun, and you will.
don't let your expectations get the best of you.
expectations.
to them, the word implied inevitable failure.
was it wrong to have faith that things could turn out well?
I'm not sure which was more difficult to process,
the news that Sarah's alive
or that you brought Jessi back from the dead.
has Sarah tried to contact you?
no. And she won't.
she's put her past behind her, Kyle,
and I've accepted that I need to do the same.
your leg is better.
Yeah. It's good as new.
just in time for me to move on.
move on?
Kyle, I wasn't pleased that latnok
was willing to test Jessi like some kind of a laboratory rat.
it made me realize just how out of touch we all are with our own humanity.
so I need a break from the latnok community.
and I asked them to give you a break.
for me?
I haven't even met them.
well, they've been watching you for a while,
waiting for an opportunity to take a larger role in your development.
they've been watching me?
believe me, I wasn't happy about it either.
but I've made it very clear to them
that you have a whole lifetime to be extraordinary.
now is the time for you to be...ordinary.
so I'd ask you to come along with me,
but I think we both know what your answer would be.
it doesn't bother you that I wouldn't want to leave the Tragers?
I'll be back one day
when it's time for us to resume out training.
in the meantime,
I want you to stay here and enjoy what I never had.
what's that?
a life.
my sunset backdrop is a no-show,
so I don't think this gym is gonna be transformed
into the ocean paradise that I want.
we still have time. Maybe there's something
Kyle, really, I know I made a huge deal
about the whole magic of prom,
but I'll be happy if it wasn't a huge disaster.
this would be so much more fun if we were allowed to inhale.
will you guys please get him out of here?
Amanda, I don't think I should leave you here
to deal with this by yourself.
Kyle, I have 27 perfectly capable people
to help me hang lame streamers.
I, for one, am happy to pass the helium torch.
good. Save your energy for the end of tonight.
your sugar mama's got big plans for you.
is there anything else I can do?
no. - That was a lie.
you've just been busted by the human lie detector.
fess up, little lady.
okay, if you really want to help. - I really want to.
you can pick up my dress from the cleaners.
there was this whole-- well, it's a long story, but
I'd be happy to.
you don't have to bring everything.
we can start fresh. I can get you some new clothes.
Why?
because of the memories of Taylor not being exactly
a good father?
I'm glad he left.
but I like my clothes.
I even like this room.
it's the first place I've ever been able to call mine.
now this brings back memories.
good ones?
good at the time.
sometimes I wonder if it's worth having good memories.
when things go wrong, you almost resent the happy moments,
like they failed you.
that picture reminds me of Kyle
and everything we've been through together.
I hope I never have to resent that.
Yeah, I hope you never have to.
Jessi, I think we should leave Seattle.
where would we go?
I don't know. Somewhere, anywhere else.
because of latnok?
I don't know. maybe.
Seattle was a cage for me for 20 years,
and being back here, I feel trapped.
would that be okay with you?
Yeah. Of course.
Andy says she has big plans for me.
you know what that means, don't you?
this dress is silver.
dude, you already said that. It's not important.
it's supposed to be yellow.
we're talking about me now, dude.
sorry. What does it mean?
it means I need to be ready to round the bases.
round the bases?
prom night often results in extra bases,
and considering I slid in to second with Andy a few weeks ago,
I'm looking at third base, if not an inside-the-park homer.
Josh, you should know by now, I have no idea what you're talking about.
sex. I'm talking about sex.
Yeah, and I've never... you know.
had it. - With another person.
never mind.
the importance of prom night sex was portrayed in 82% of the movies I watched.
see?
but since 17% of them also ended with
young teens being fatally mutilated,
I assumed it was a cinematic convention.
afraid not, buddy.
for much of the adolescent universe,
the whole dance is basically just foreplay.
is sex part of the perfect prom equation?
don't you worry about it.
something tells me that sex isn't part of yours and amanda's g-rated prom fantasy.
what is it?
nothing.
uh, no.
no line-dance songs. Come on.
what? - Ah!
you know it's inevitable. - Not if I can help it.
come on!
it's a prom must-do.
Yeah, then I think I must puke.
are you sure you don't want to just dj the prom yourself?
please. Have you seen those geeks that dj the proms?
ha ha ha! Hilarious.
besides, I'm supposed to be having the time of my life, remember?
Oh, you mean the lyric you actually neglected to include in your theme song?
it's been done.
besides, you and I both know that there's zero chance of winning that contest tonight,
with my reedy voice and the 12th-rate acoustic recording.
Wow. You're really not expecting much, are you?
the thing about expectations
you know what? Forget it.
I've already busted out that speech once today.
so jaded for so young.
enough with the young already.
what's all this?
Amanda changed her dress,
so the vest and the corsage I choose don't match unless I dye them.
well, can I help?
I know this may surprise you,
but I used to be kinda good at arts and crafts.
I stripped the silver nitrate off some old rolls of film
and combined it with aluminum potassium sulfate.
but I'm having trouble stabilizing the polyvalent metal ions
needed to act as a mortar to set the dye pigment.
I once made a house out of popsicle sticks.
the dye is too dark and won't stick properly to the fabric.
Oh. Well, I'm sure Amanda will understand.
she will understand. that's the problem.
she's already given up hope of having a good prom,
but she shouldn't.
I just wanna make sure it's everything she wished for.
well, don't put too much pressure on yourself.
sometimes trying too hard to make things perfect can blow up in your face.
Hey. - How are you?
alive... thanks to you.
you've made a mess.
I don't know why the formula didn't work.
let me see what I can do.
what are you looking for?
Adam said latnok is watching me.
he told them to stop, but I still feel like someone's out there.
I think latnok is creepy. So does Sarah.
how have things been going with her?
new.
exciting.
a little scary.
she wants to leave town.
Why? - To start over.
Jessi.
no, it's okay.
Sarah really wants this.
well, what do you want?
I want what you have.
a family.
have you told her that you'd rather stay?
no, I can't do that. - Why not?
because what if she leaves anyway?
Jessi...
not everyone who cares about you is going to disappoint you.
all I know is I'm being given a chance to have a real life.
I'm not gonna do anything to mess it up.
you're missing about ten milligrams of nickel iodine.
Oh, good. I need to talk to you.
now's not the best time, dad.
well, it's never an appropriate time for a man to warn his daughter not to get involved with his teaching assistant.
and yet, here we are.
I'm not getting involved with mark.
in case you haven't noticed, I'm in a towel
getting ready for prom with Declan.
a much better age-appropriate, all-around good choice I'm thinking.
my year of strumming sad chords was sponsored by Mr. Declan Mcdonough.
not to mention his role in my disappearing reappearing virtue.
and about that
don't worry, dad. Store's closed.
what store?
no weekend sales, no limited time offers.
security system's armed.
guard dogs are roaming the aisle.
of course we're still encouraging window shopping,
cause you always wanna keep the public interested.
but I can assure you that tonight will not be about sex.
I thought prom was basically just foreplay
for much of the adolescent universe.
says who? - Josh.
Josh? - What's up?
not you, that's for sure.
what?
there'll be no sex had by you.
Not...any of you.
not tonight, tomorrow, or hopefully in my lifetime.
smile.
what did you do? - What? Is it that obvious?
last time you had that look,
you realized Josh just found your old pot stash.
okay, so which parental sin did you commit?
the "don't blow the sex talk" one.
we already had that talk with Lori.
I'm not talking about Lori, or Kyle either.
Josh?
Oh, Stephen, he's not ready.
I know.
well, you have to go back up and talk to him again.
I know. - So why aren't you moving?
I don't know.
you only have a small window of opportunity to correct this.
I can't do it.
Yes. Yes, you can.
you can. you are a smart, educated,
progressive, thoughtful man,
And--and... an excellent father.
don't psych yourself out.
just go.
Hey, it looks like all the stains came out.
thank you for coming over to help out.
how can I pass up my last opportunity
to prove that I'm smarter than you?
very funny.
I'm not, you know, smarter.
I just try harder to impress people.
but you already knew that.
you don't have to do that anymore.
you never have to prove yourself to anyone ever again.
if anything,
people should start proving themselves to you.
you really don't want to see me leave, do you?
you're my friend, Jessi.
I don't want to lose you.
I have your dress. It's not yellow.
I know, the dry cleaners accidentally shredded my original dress,
so I had to make a last-minute switch.
at least now I'll match the gym.
how are things going down there?
almost done.
but would you mind dropping the dress off at school?
at the school? won't you be home soon?
I'm just taking some precautions.
you know, in case the decorations committee hits a snag
and I have to get ready here.
I'm coming to help you.
Kyle, don't. I'm dirty and a mess.
and even though everything else is a bust right now,
I don't want you to see me until I'm ready.
just send the dress.
but I
promise me you won't come in.
I promise.
good.
it's still wet.
I'll take care of it.
I should at least take it to her and explain.
Kyle, you need to get ready.
I'll finish the dress, and I'll take it to Amanda.
it will all be okay.
you want to do something nice for Amanda?
no, but I'd like to do something nice for you.
come in.
what's with the shades?
all the makeup, like, ever, is on your face.
I wanna look "va va voomy" for Josh,
but I keep coming up with vampire clown whore.
can you help me?
you have two moms. Doesn't one of them wear a little lip-gloss?
my moms think that makeup is an ageist, sexist ploy
to devalue the feminine form in its natural state
perpetuating unrealistic myths and expectations.
Yeah. Well... maybe it is.
come here.
nice job.
I downloaded an instructional diagram.
stephen will be disappointed he wasn't able to help you.
the ultimate father/son prom ritual. I forgot.
no, no, no, no. Don't worry about Stephen.
don't worry about anyone but yourself.
and Amanda.
and Amanda.
Oh. Beautiful.
I got it from the rose garden where we had our first kiss.
you thought of everything.
I tried.
don't forget to stop and smell the roses every so often yourself tonight.
actually double-dyeing the corsage eliminated the scent of
you mean to focus less on making things perfect
and more on having a good time.
Yes.
look at you.
when you first came here,
everything in the world was new.
look at all you've learned.
look at all you've overcome.
tonight's a celebration of that.
just breathe and enjoy it.
I'm sorry you had to say good-bye to Adam.
he's doing what he thinks is best for me.
still, I know it's hard to say good-bye to family.
Adam created me.
he's my mentor and my friend.
but you are my family.
your decorations are ugly.
they'll look better once we turn the lights down.
all right. Fine. It sucks.
it's like charlie brown's christmas tree.
I don't know what that means.
ugly. It means ugly.
and everyone else left, so I don't have time to go home.
I have to get ready here.
I just wanted to make it special for Kyle, but I blew it.
anyways, thanks for the dress.
did you deliver the dress?
your prom is going to be terrible.
Why?
well, the decorations are a disaster,
and Amanda has to get ready in the school locker room.
why didn't she ask me for help?
she wanted to make it special for you.
she did?
maybe if you two stopped working so hard
to make it special, you'd enjoy it more.
or maybe there's still something I can do to fix it.
I figured you'd say something like that.
which is why you called. Thank you.
this doesn't mean I like her, by the way.
I know.
thanks to Jessi, I had an idea
of how to make Amanda's night a little better.
her expectations may have disappeared,
but my desire to surpass them hadn't.
could this day get any worse?
not funny.
I thought, uh, you could use some help getting ready.
what?
did you poison my makeup or put fleas in my dress?
I think you like being mean to me.
well, that's just a little bit of
the pot calling the kettle black, now, isn't it?
the pot and the kettle are black.
my point exactly.
well, after tonight, it doesn't matter anyway.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means I'm leaving town.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why? you hate me.
but I know how important you are to Kyle.
and when you care about somebody,
you wanna put their feelings first.
so how's it going?
all set.
you have to scuff the bottom of your shoes before you walk in them.
helps give you traction. - Yeah. I didn't know that.
actually, I didn't either. Kyle told me.
the prom know-it-all strikes again.
so, listen -- please don't.
I have to.
then could you make it quick and painless, please?
all right. You want it quick and painless? Don't use this.
you don't want me to have safe sex?
no.
I--I mean yes,
I do want you to have safe sex,
but, no, I don't want you to have sex at all.
I'd much rather you wait till you know you're ready,
till you and Andy know you're ready.
it'll mean a whole lot more if you do.
but if you decide to ignore everything I say
and make you own monumentally life-altering
no-going-back decision to have sex,
forever changing the relationship you have with Andy,
then I want you to be protected.
can I go now?
Yes.
whoa. Hold up.
a little screwy loop here.
okay.
good to go.
Thanks, dad. - You're welcome.
Hey, handsome.
so how was the talk, part two?
well, a little like that condom I just gave our son.
clumsy, awkward, but hopefully effective.
are you sure you're okay with missing your dinner to help with my plan?
do you think for one minute that Lori Trager
would let us miss an opportunity to help you and Amanda?
we're skipping the pre-prom dinner? sweet!
you were paying for that part, weren't you?
I was indeed.
what's taking them so long?
I've been gorgeous for hours already.
let's go, people! We have a prom to save!
you are ruining our entrance.
Lori, you look -- Yeah, yeah.
Josh?
what you are about to experience
is a defining moment in your otherwise idiotic life.
do not mess it up.
looking good, Trager.
not bad yourself, Mcdonough.
Where's Andy.
all my research had been right.
no matter what anyone said about expectations,
everyone secretly hoped this would be the best night of their lives.
Oh, my god!
I knew that more than just helping Amanda,
my night had just become about making sure everyone got their wish.
you did that on purpose.
maybe.
Really? - Yeah.
Jessi helped me.
you did?
well, I didn't want to, but she was really pathetic.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
okay. Good to know a little girl-bonding
didn't upset the balance of nature.
what time is it? - Relax. we're here early.
Kyle's waiting for you in the gym.
you've gone soft.
I had a near-death experience.
it's gonna take me a few days to return to normal.
Hi.
Hi.
it's perfect.
I had a little help.
heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.
heel, toe, heel, clap, clap.
I think the problem is I have two left feet.
I never noticed. How do you buy shoes?
it's an expression.
but you knew that, didn't you?
those jewels aren't real, you know!
whatever, Hillary!
don't drink that. Someone spiked the punch.
that's impossible.
according to my research, it happens at 68% of all proms.
I have to take care of this.
and something's leaking by the dj table. There's water everywhere.
I'm on it.
Where's Declan?
hopefully not looking for me.
Where's Andy?
I, uh, ditched her on the dance floor.
a man needs a break, you know?
why are you both hiding from your dates?
you want this one?
he's hiding because he's freaking out
about whether or not to have sex with Andy.
she wants this. I mean, I can't blame her.
but she's so much more experienced than I am.
so, yeah, I'm totally freaking out.
right.
your turn.
she's messed up because she doesn't know
whether or not to get back together with Declan.
Yep.
prom is stressful.
true that.
it doesn't have to be.
are you kidding? you've been flipping out all week.
I know. But Nicole taught me something.
you're busting out a mom moment right now?
she said that tonight is a celebration of how far we've come,
and we should just let it happen and enjoy it.
I have come a long way.
from dumb to dumber.
better than a slut to sluttier.
that's the old me. - Oh.
which means I have come a long way.
that Nicole Trager, she's pretty good.
Yes, she is.
you're not so bad yourself.
shall we?
okay.
all right. Tell me the truth.
about what?
we lost the song contest, didn't we?
we lost the song contest.
well, that's just...
...fine, actually.
is it? - Yeah.
I didn't write that song for this.
I wrote it because I had something to say about myself and...
everyone here tonight.
well, no one's heard it except me.
the perils of the undiscovered songwriting duo.
destined for a lonely life on the road.
with only their college degrees to keep them warm at night.
phds, please.
you have a phd?
no, not yet. How old do you think I am?
how old are you?
I'm 19.
you're only 19?
I was--I was sort of an early bloomer, academically speaking.
and you've been torturing me about being so young.
you are unbelievable.
but I'm half of a pretty great songwriting duo.
I don't know about great. you heard the song.
but have you?
Hello, everyone. Hello.
I hope you're all having a great night.
this song is not the winner of the prom theme contest.
but I though that everybody should get a chance to hear this song.
it's written by someone who, in my opinion,
knows a whole lot more about who she is
and really what life's all about than she will ever admit.
so, enjoy it.
this isn't...
how...
I'm computer genius, remember
what are you doing up here?
roof leak.
what about you? I thought you went home hours ago.
what do they call it? A last hurrah?
a last hurrah?
you're leaving with Sarah tonight.
Yeah.
you're not gonna ask her to stay?
Amanda said something to me earlier.
if you care about someone, you wanna put their feelings first.
I wanna do that for Sarah.
I understand.
I guess I just wish she'd done the same for you.
thank you for your help tonight.
it's amazing what we can accomplish when we work together, isn't it?
I'm gonna miss you, Jessi.
no, you're not.
because no matter where I am,
we're always connected.
that's true.
even if I am smarter.
stronger. - Faster.
you, uh...
you better get back in there and make some more memories.
they're kinda hard to come by for people like you and me.
you should come down, too.
a last hurrah.
a last hurrah.
you've been following me.
nice tux.
why all the secrecy?
I didn't want to distract you.
you're worried about latnok, aren't you?
you don't trust them either.
well, they're scientists.
I don't know if they should be trusted.
do I have anything to worry about?
you should always worry.
not tonight.
tonight is about Amanda.
we'll be fine.
okay.
I'll go.
but, Foss.
thanks for looking out for me.
God, I love a man in a tux.
me, too.
I mean, Ilike being the man you love in a tux.
okay, so we've had our pictures taken.
we've danced. we've eaten weird french hors d'oeuvrey things.
we've covered every prom clich? In the book,
and now I think we should move onto our end of the night festivities.
okay.
let me begin by saying you're the hottest girl I know,
and I fantasize about having sex with you, like, all the time.
and I really wanted to have sex with you tonight.
but then my dad comes up to me
and didn't make any sense about whatever he was trying to say
and wanted to give me a condom,
and it all became real.
and anyway, I just... don't think we should.
you think I wanted to give it up to you tonight?
didn't you?
losing my virginity on prom night
is the most clich? of all things clich?
what kind of sentimental loser do you think I am?
wait. You're a virgin?
why wouldn't I be?
so what did you mean then, if not sex?
triple chocolate sundaes
and me kicking your ass yet again in g-force extreme.
Really?
really.
there you are.
I'm finally done putting out fires.
I'm assuming there were no actual fires.
no, no fires.
a flood or two.
I guess there was more than one leak.
the cleaning crew will get it.
I think it's time for a dance.
I think that sounds great.
have a great night, everyone.
the prom as we know it has ended.
it's over.
it doesn't have to be.
may I have this dance?
Bye! - Later!
gotta go, pumpkins.
I got a tiara to stalk.
good night. - Later, Hills.
so what's next on our Hillary-approved itinerary?
how'd you know?
cause she had that glint of a job well done in her eyes.
I didn't want to mess anything up.
how could you think you could mess it up?
cause I feel like that's all I've ever done
since the first time we got together.
I couldn't even break up with you properly.
we're so passed that.
look, I know I said I'd be more open and all that,
so let me do this.
right. Sorry. Continue with your openness.
I really like you, Lori.
I always have.
I don't know where you stand with me
or with what we're supposed to be or not be,
but I want you to know that it's in your hands.
it's in my hands? why?
cause I heard your song tonight.
really heard it.
the girl who wrote it has got her whole future in front of her.
I don't wanna be the one that holds her back.
you know what's amazing?
is you really know me, and you get me.
I care about you so much.
but you're right.
I don't wanna move backwards.
or even stay in the same place.
so...
I think that means that we shouldn't be together.
is that okay?
I seem to remember it's part of the whole "it's in your hands" thing.
do you mean it?
Trager, you're one of my best friends.
all I want is for you to be happy.
I don't know if I deserve that.
trust me, you do.
you did that, didn't you?
maybe.
so how do you do it all?
do what?
everything I've seen you do.
my brain is more developed than other people's.
it allows me to do special things.
kinda like superman, only real?
can you fly?
I'm not gonna tell you that until you tell me something I don't know about you.
not this again. - It's only fair.
you may not know that...
I love you.
you do?
I do.
I love you, too.
here, don't get your feet wet.
there's a reason why people say
we shouldn't expect too much.
no one wants to see someone they care about end up disappointed.
we instinctively act
to protect our own from being hurt
and do what we can to make the right choices for the people we love.
but the reason we have expectations in the first place
is because we wanna aim as high as we can.
because when you love someone,
there's no limit to what you can accomplish.
Oh! I left my other clothes inside.
I'll get them. - No, I will.
no, let me help you.
again. - Always.
got everything you need?
I do now.
same thing of every fucking morning.
I heard that. - No, you didn't.
yes I did. - I did too.
Hey, Sandy, what the hell.
mom! - It's just for germs, they're for enemy.
good luck in your test. - Like I need luck.
mom. - I'm sorry.
have a great day. And remember, own your own power.
powerful Chicken run.
sorry.
don't forget to bring the DVD for my birthday.
I told Lizzie she's not bringing it for show and tell tomorrow.
do I ever forget anything? - Just do it! Ok, Mom?
go!
welcome to the Frank Magic Jr. 6th birthday celebration.
we have many famous guests. Famous. - Well, we're here.
cute.
Yeah, that's it.
Oh, Molly, Molly.
Molly Foster?!
you're a magician. A little magician.
doing Sandy a nice favor.
Molly. Yes, Molly.
Oh, my God!
mom, I don't understand why we have to move into the city?
the city is the center of everything, honey. It will be a fresh start.
dad said that only minority ventured Capitalists live in the city.
and now we do too.
are we gonna meet any transvestite?
what is transvestite?
it is a person who has a penis and a vagina and they live in the city.
that's not what it is.
okay, guys, it's the place.
I really have to pee.
can you hold it a little longer?
welcome to New York City.
we're only here because our parents are getting a divorce.
stop smiling or I'm taking you to Oprah.
Sadie. - You know I've read about this.
it's fairly typical behavior for children of divorced.
how about taking the bags?
mommy, check this out! We're writing our names.
Oh God!
you can't move around for the rest of your life.
it's only been three weeks, mom. Give me some time.
Oh, such a smart girl.
she never graduated college, and you hated her.
but the French, she spoke it so beautiful.
she was from there.
she was a Finklestein, It is hard not to love a Finklestein.
anyway, I spoke to your cousin Lou, and she arranged a job interview,
women's Center, where she used to work, Get you out of your punk.
I have a job, at the coffee shop.
Oh, it's depressing and you're a college graduate, Aram, for crying out loud.
you'll finally put that Ladies Studies major of yours to good use.
it's a minor, Dad, and it's called sociology.
Ba from Stanford and Journalism from Northwestern.
you do realize that it's just a stat checking job?
I've been raising two kids, and.
I'm divorced.
and I'm sure I'll be good at this because I'm very organized.
I love sports, well not hockey, so much.
you see, once the kids were born I decided to stay home for a while.
coz you know, babies take up a lot of time.
maybe you don't know.
anyway, eventually they went to school and I started having a little time in my hands.
and compiled these stat books, and made up this graphing system.
Yeah, hmm.
how?
it's time, and a great satellite TV package.
aram Finklestein, that's a Jewish name, right?
what are your feelings about women, Aram?
are you kidding? I think you're great up until...
recently I was planning on spending the rest of my life with a woman.
not that I wanted to spend it with a man, I just...
one experience with a woman, kinda took away my faith in love, and I guess, everything.
Aram, I know you took some Women's studies courses in College.
but other than that, do you have any kind of experience that you think might have prepared you for this job?
I used to buy tampons for my mother.
you will fit in perfectly, yes.
I have met my soul mate.
you met a really hot French girl who needed a green card.
she was so... - Hot.
she wasn't that. - Sexy.
it was something else. She needed me.
Yes, to get a green card.
there's gotta be more meaning to it than all of this.
you know living at your parents' place isn't exactly... grab a life by the balls you know.
I'm saving up.
I hate to tell you this but... you work in a coffee shop.
and your hot French wife left you for her brother.
stop it.
can I get you something?
Yeah, this ad says... you have an apartment for rent?
Yes, ours have a...
which I would be happy to show you.
sure. - Cool.
I'm Mitchell, and this right here is Aram.
he's trying to figure out the meaning of life.
he also is a wonderful babysitter if you ever need one.
just a break of the apartment.
Hey, little guys. - Mama, I do not want to live here.
I want my room. - How many more apartment are we going to look at?
I got an apartment. - You're fast.
it's not great, but my husband won't be there so that's a plus.
how are you so well adjusted?
all those years with the PTA, I don't have a choose.
how's the job search?
I got one, fact check for SNN.
you are unbelievable, you're almost fully healed.
you know everyone says what a nightmare it is to get divorced you're bad, I feel good.
no residual or anything?
this is the best thing that ever happened to me.
trapped in some suburban hell, same thing day after day like a "hamster in a wheel."
up on your feet, let's ride to happiness.
all you need now to complete the healing is to get laid.
Oh no, that's one thing I'm not ready for.
look I don't expect you to fall in love with this guy.
this guy? Oh, no! What have you done?
a chiropractor, who fixed me up with that whole elevator shaft thing.
anyway, he smells great, and went to an Ivy League College.
where? - Santa Barbara.
that's not Ivy League.
well, he's in great shape, and he has a country house.
and I already told him all about you.
wait, I think that's the kid who showed me the apartment.
the one that tried to kiss you?
no, he just works in the coffee shop right below.
too bad, he's cute. - Yeah, like 10.
nice ass, Coffee boy.
just go out with my chiropractor, and have a good time maybe screw him, you know, that's seems right.
why are you here? It's been three weeks.
I came to see you.
have fun.
there's this huge kid, and he has like so much fat on him.
he sat at me at gym class, and told me who would change my name to Pablo.
Frankie, that is terrible, are you okay sweetie? - it's Pablo.
and yes, it was fun.
so, listen... - Oh, uh.
what? - Whenever you say, "So, listen,"
is always something strange.
it's not weird, it's just that I'm thinking about going on a date.
I don't know, what I really want to but I,
I think it will be a positive step for me...
but I just wanted to see how you guys would feel about it...
are you gonna have sex with them?
that's an inappropriate question...
hey guys, you know, if we're gonna live in the city, we're gonna have to learn to deal with these kind of stuff ok.
so just stick with me and be polite.
hello - Hi.
thanks you for coming in on such short notice.
I won't normally put you on this type of situation, without some training, but we're really in a vine.
whatever I can do to help. - Ok, great, now why don't you put your suit on.
and then meet me at the activities room.
a suit? - Yeah, it's in the closet behind you.
now try to hurry, self-defense class starts exactly at 5: 30.
mommy, why do you have to do this?
because now that we live in New York we're gonna all kinds of different people.
and we need to know how to deal with them.
like the man with the penis?
so you're walking down the street, and all of a sudden you hear...
Hey, sweet lips, I like that ass.
hey mommy, why don't you come over here, sit on my face...?
Hey, kid, how would like to make a quick $ 100?
Yes, sure. - No, you don't kid, you don't want that money.
self-preservation in in a city of predators.
that's what you will learn in here.
let's meet our perpetrator.
Hi.
no words perf unless they're scripted.
begin scenario eight.
Hey, sweet lips.
scenario 3.
Hey, baby, that should be illegal.
5.0
Mrs. Sanchez, it appears you have a yeast infection, and an unbelievable set of tits.
for our last exercise, I am going to demonstrate what I call, "Ocean of anger."
hold on, because we are about to go deep.
all of us as women have developed a reservoir of resentment and anger.
and these reservoirs put together form an ocean, and this ocean is available for all us to draw from.
it holds the collective power of every women, who has ever been wronged in an inappropriate sexual remark being underpaid for a job you've done better than a man, ancestor who was a slave.
or rice picker, or simply lowman on the totem pole.
a husband who has wronged you, who has cheated and lied to you, or you, or you, or you.
I'm a lesbian. - See me after class.
all of this anger is present in all of you, right now and always.
I need a volunteer.
mom!
don't!
you are going to call upon this history and unleash the ocean of anger on our perf.
may I, just need a quick bathroom break?
zip it, perf. Tell him to zip it.
zip it, perf. - Again, good, louder.
zip it, perf.
now tell him what you wanna tell him.
dirty little fucking scumbag.
take your disease riddled whore and fuck her in hell for all eternity,
may the devil burn you, with hot jagged metal, and suffocate you with mountain fury.
now, unleash!
Oh my God.
is there a safe word I should be aware of?
time out.
my life was never gonna be this way.
it's okay.
I know you.
I don't see how getting beat up by a bunch of chicks everyday is getting you any closer to the meaning of his life.
I'm helping people, I'm contributing to the world.
not like an actor.
buddy, I reflect life back unto itself, ok?
thereby, taking mirror, like a theatre mirror.
look at you. - Oh, it's not as bad as it feels.
my mom was sorry she beat you up so bad.
thank you, Frankie.
don't worry about it, your mom didn't beat me up.
I've been going through a lot...
can I get a blueberry muffin...? - Not right now sweetheart.
I've been going through a lot recently I didn't realize how much it was affecting me.
don't worry about it. - Just saying sorry.
I pick it up. - I helped.
if palm gets squeezed into it, you could die.
I was wondering if I could take you up on your offer to baby-sit.
if it still holds, that is.
I don't really... I mean, I haven't you know in a little while...
I figured since they, hired at the Women's Center,
you must be trustworthy.
I guess I could pop upstairs some day after work for a couple of hours.
would Thursday work?
she has a date. - With a big pimp.
where do you learn this stuff?
Olivia at school taught me, she's my hell, we play.
what ever happened to kickball.
would 7 o'clock be okay?
Oh, great.
there are times when the lost must be found, and other times when the lost must find themselves.
very well said Rabbi.
not that he's a bad little boy just misguided, falling in with the wrong crowd.
are you talking about me? I only hang out with you and Dad?
the battles are not only fought on the battlefield, Roberto but also in the soul.
my soul is fine. Great.
what does his future hold?
mom, he's not a palm reader.
a new job is in order.
luckily, my cousin is a head hunter are you interested in business, Aram?
Yes.
kids, your babysitter's here. Come say hello.
Sadie usually goes to bed a bit later than Frankie, but due to her unscheduled emergency surgery she'll be going to bed the same time. - Oh my God.
are you sure I should be staying with her after she just had surgery?
this was her surgery.
I told you it was dead when I found it.
Yes, but I highly doubt its organs have been harvested.
I hate you. - Can I play Wii?
for half an hour.
you're gonna be okay, right? - Yeah.
truth is, I didn't know if I want to go on this date, it's just my friend, she's kinda forcing me. Things we need to get with.
release some tension.
do I look okay? Everything's in order.
it seems to be.
goodbye, Frankie. - Bye.
hey Frank. - Call me Pablo.
he also had some cranial seizures as well as TMJ.
so what did you do?
I went right home and I took out my skeleton.
your skeleton? - It's really as weird as it sounds.
I have this bone replica skeleton, keep it the house and I use it to figure stuff out.
this way I can put it in different positions and see how they affect his bone structure.
it's a him? - Yes it's him.
thought it would be weird if it was a her.
that way people might think I'm seeing somebody, and it might actually drive away beautiful women like you.
I'm a mom.
why did I say that?
it's okay, it's alright, I know. It's true.
you are a mom. And you are incredibly beautiful.
you have excellent posture.
excuse me for just a second.
you haven't told me much about yourself.
my God.
hello - I'm here.
I thought I'd lost you for a second.
no, I grew up just outside San Francisco.
that's a great town.
do you have any hobby?
just take care of my kids.
no, no, that's not a hobby.
I used to like to windsurf.
Longboard? Shortboard? Ocean, lake, what?
lake, mostly lake.
I competed when I was younger.
competed in windsurfing, That's impressing.
you... like the beautiful you, you.
you are fascinating.
what's your normal job?
I work at the coffee shop. - I mean your real job?
it was my real job.
but you are in the blowup suit too.
that was just once, I quit there.
didn't you go to college? - Yes.
I hope I'll have a real job by the time I'm your age.
knockout!
the Pablo man had knocked you out.
so are we gonna have fun tonight or you're gonna be one of those boring babysitter?
hey guys, it's me.
I don't know why you're not picking up, Anyway, I hope everything's okay.
Yeah, ok, bye.
worried about the kids, huh？
my new babysitter have not much experience yet.
I know exactly what you need.
see, we all hold our tension somewhere.
for you, it's in your shoulders, and just a little bit in your ass.
there's much experience as I have...
can tell just by the way as people walk...
and even by the way they smile.
no charge.
this thing got my arm.
I'm running through the forest.
leave me one arm, please don't...
I'll get claustrophobic wearing human skin mask.
you couldn't even wear a hulk mask last Halloween.
that's because it was hot and it smelled bad.
that was your breath, Retard. - Sadie...
actually... - C'mon, you don't need to do...
it's 11 o'clock.
gotta to get you to bed before your mom comes home.
how about the "Exorcist." - Okay.
I don't feel so good.
I might throw up.
this chocolate bar is bigger than you.
if you're gonna throw up, can't we do it before your mom gets home, please.
I always throw up when mentioning throw up, and before a girl.
I love throw ups.
Eew, you love to eat throw up? - Sadie.
what?
you're gonna freak him out you're getting us all in trouble.
you know actually I feels sick..., Frankie?
that was nice, listen - What?
eating a raw skinned pigeon with mustard and rotten milk, just chewing on those intestines and those little bones...
okay, off to bed, c'mon... - Yummy.
touch my cock.
stop the car.
you have a problem. - I have a problem?
thanks for offering.
I'd love to tell you.
in a taxi. It seems like the perfect place.
hobby
how could this happen to me? Do you ever wonder that?
how could I have floated so far off the path I thought I was on?
I just thought maybe it would be some meaning to my life.
I'm not making any sense.
maybe you'll come back again.
cause I think the kids could really use some continuity.
shit.
I have no fucking money. Can you believe that?
can I pay you tomorrow?
it's no problem.
hey it's you, eating a croissant.
french chick must be fading, huh.
don't change the music. - What, they're shooting music... oops?
what do you think about kids? - I think about making them all the time.
that's not what I'm talking about. - What are you talking about?
I don't know, being entirely responsible for another human being's life.
it's crazy.
Aram, Aram - Mama's dead!
what? - C'mon.
she's not dead.
it could be postmortem twitch.
kids fall back.
Hey.
sandy.
it's morning.
Oh my God, I slept with a babysitter.
you didn't sleep with a babysitter.
we thought you were dead.
Yeah, we thought you might have asphyxiated on your own vomit.
aram can take us to school. Coz we're already late.
could you? - Sure.
can you pick them up too?
are those stat sheets ready yet?
Yeah, printer 4.
sandy, you got a minute?
am I fired?
what! Why would you say that?
because...
I'm so hangover, I guess.
I have two kids and no husband.
I haven't had a real job since graduate school. I'm so sorry.
Oh, please don't apologize.
I was really calling you in to see if you wanted to write for me.
I find the guys stuff gets boring and repetitive.
and I saw that stat book you put together, amazing.
clearly obsessive, reminds me of me.
do you do yoga?
I'll do yoga if I could win.
I'm gonna take you some time.
Thanks. - Hydrate.
cool, what's your catch phrase gonna be?
I don't think it's gonna be like that, Frankie.
what about suck it? - Why are you such an idiot.
it's just an idea.
that's really exciting though, I mean, and you can even get some airtime.
I don't think so. - That'll be cool, mom.
you have the face for it.
that's a nice thing to say.
"you have the face for it. ," Hmm, love you, love you, love you.
I'm just saying that your mom has a face to put on TV.
I'm very together, I never missed taking my kids to school.
you don't have to explain anything, I promise I know what it's like to go through a divorce.
are your parents divorced?
no, I am sort of.
what? You're so young.
when do you have the time?
it was short-lived, her name was Alice, she left me for her brother. He wasn't really her brother he was just posing as her brother so he could be close to her.
so she could use me to get a green card.
what!? That is horrible.
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
the worst part about it though is I can't bring myself to finalize the divorce because if I do then she'll get kick out of the country.
that would be so cruel, you know.
God, I wished I could get my husband kicked out of the country.
it's that bad, huh. - Yeah - So sorry. - Oh, no, me too, for you.
you know, Aram this has been really hard for me and with a new job, there's gonna be some longer hours.
and I was thinking, maybe you'd be willing to help us out on more of a full time basis.
a nanny?
you're not from Trinidad, you're from the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
did we send you to college for this, Harry?
you always said you just wanted me to be happy.
within reason, this is not how you contribute to the world.
mom you work for Ralph Lauren.
people need clothes.
this family needs me, she just got divorced...
and she got this great job...
and she needs someone to trust to take care of these kids...
mom it's not like it's forever.
you know, I'm gonna be making money.
Harry! - Alright, you're still going out on interviews for other jobs.
and in the meantime you can't keep this for quite a while.
let me try it, get a job, I'm a freaking racer.
it's not the same...It's not the same thing. Coz you have to say the freaking first to make it work.
it's much funnier with the freaking, right?
I'm just gonna go outside and grab a smoke.
smoke? What are they from stone age?
please for some goddamn God, you got to find something wrong with every guy
did you see how long it takes the guy to order a bow wine?
his father owns a vineyard in Napa, so he knows a lot about it.
like he mentioned several hundred times.
he mentioned it once.
who is calling you? You don't have a life.
it's Aram, he taught me how to text.
Oh my God! - What?
you have a thing for the nanny - Oh, please.
he's just telling me that my kids are asleep.
kids asleep. Frank.
Frank took two foot long poop, we measured.
it's disgusting.
just keeping me in the loop and I appreciate that.
it's very funny, sincere.
and besides he's a lot more adult than those guys you've set me up with.
in a 24-year old kind of way.
let me see what you wrote. - No, no... you're not.
about to bail on my date, set up monopoly?
this is pathetic. Seriously?
Yeah.
OK, here's the pussy.
I would love you to meet Sunshine and Cinnamon.
Hi, I am Aram.
they love talking and stuff so...
try to be normal, alright. Stay positive.
sorry. - Aram, hey.
it's a weird name.
thank you.
Mitch told me he is divorced.
it's weird, huh.
it's kinda normal to me, you know, it's my life.
so I'm kinda used to it, I guess.
I guess if you mean, it's unusual, then yeah.
we'll talk a lot about this.
I guess.
I love theories.
make me a little horny.
I think I'm gonna go.
Hey, it's me, what are you guys doing?
we're just playing "American Idol."
that was truly dreadful Aram Finklestein, awful.
you kinda like a little pitchy in the beginning but dawg, I mean you put it together in the end, and man you rocked.
I'm not gonna be able to make it home for dinner tonight.
Yeah, no problem. I could feed the kids.
you may have to put them to bed too.
can be a late one, huh.
Yeah, a couple of the Vikings player, were charged of sexually assaulting a stripper.
I have to come up with something fizzy for the board to leave this.
well, Vikings have been attacking people on ships for centuries now.
Aram, that's good but thank you. I'll see when I get home okay.
I'm sorry.
God, I can't imagine to be many more days like this.
no prob, there's dinner for you on the table there.
Oh thanks, you didn't have to do that.
just whipped up on stuff that I learned on Top Chef.
the kids helped, and Frank's pretty good.
delicious, wow, hmm... wait.
I have these two tickets for the fight on Saturday, I thought you might be able to use them.
aren't the kids with their dad this weekend?
yeah - And you don't wanna use this?
my girlfriend's not free and I'm facing another date.
so take whoever you want.
that's really nice, thanks. - You're welcome.
Hey, I was wondering if you are free this weekend.
coz I've got these tickets to the big fight.
I hate it when the ref does that.
why bother having a rest, just let them bare-knuckle it.
I can't believe you were thinking of that coming.
me neither.
I can never be like this with Frank.
it was like I didn't even know if I was happy when I was with him.
what makes people do that? Just coast along.
and you know the thing that really sticks for me is that I never got the chance to tell him how I felt.
he has this strange ability, to make me entirely lose my voice.
like some superpower, it's crazy.
no Voice Man
steal You Voice Man, Quiet Man - Dr. Silence. - That's a good one.
Hey, Aram, right?
Gile from Roscoe Mathis, I interviewed you.
Oh, yeah yeah. How are you?
dude, you're the only person that's ever said no to us most people would kill for that job.
sorry about that.
ringside at the fight, doesn't look like you're doing too bad.
let me know if you ever change your mind.
Thanks. - Good to see you again.
what?
it's just an entry level thing.
at Roscoe Mathis? And you let them go to be my nanny?
idiotic.
I thought so too, for a minute.
I wasn't really thinking clearly there after Alice.
and suddenly I just had a very clear thought in my head.
what really matters are the people in my life.
you and your family were, are some of those people that make me feel good, make my life good, every day.
that is the most wonderfully...
and jaded naive thing I've ever heard...
it's rare to find a guy who's such a romantic.
bright light.
close those eyes.
I'm not tired. - You're really gonna sleep this off with me.
I'm gonna put this here okay.
I really love your kids.
I know.
I had fun tonight.
yeah... me too.
none of you to call me that word, okay.
it's not a weird word, though It's just means a "female dog..."
I'm not gonna have semantics today, okay. - What are you doing here?
you know what it means, it's not okay to call me that or anyone else for that matter.
you've been in the city for a few months they're already totally corrupted.
dad's play sucks. - Frankie, what happened?
Aram!? - Guys, careful...
C'mon you late night criminals - Hey, guess what? - You wanna give me a million dollars?
we saw a dead junk on the road.
Oh, even better.
we wanted to touch it but dad wouldn't let us.
you're running a home for delinquent boys.
aram helps me with the kids, Frank.
the kids weren't here, so what's he doing here?
can I just explain something to you?
you have no rights in this house, okay.
I don't like the way this separation is going.
Oh Really?
well, I'm loving the way it's going, this is exactly how I envisioned my life.
noticed how weird this thing was. - That's mine.
what I wanna say, it's gonna come out wrong.
I want you back. I want our life back.
why are you doing this?
the truth is I couldn't handle the kids, I just wanted to see you.
you must missed me, at least a little.
I don't want you here.
of course, I don't wanna be here.
if you're good, I'll come back and do the grunge.
you can even work if you wanted to.
part time.
imagine this...
there are so many things I wanted to say to you.
we're not gonna need you anymore.
unless you wanna grab a bite to eat and you can sit, are you on hourly?
I think Sandy had something that she wanted to say to you.
didn't you?
I just wanted to tell you about some feelings I've been having you know regarding you and your treatment with me.
what she wanted to say was...
and, this is pretty much, word for word, if I remember properly...
that you're a dirty little fucking scumbag...
and I might be paraphrasing here, but you should...
take your diseased riddled whore and fuck her in hell for all eternity.
while the devil burns you...
with hot jagged metal and suffocates you...
with molten fury.
fucking nutheads.
don't come beg me to come back.
this was the last straw.
that was really good.
and by the way, I never loved you.
and I'm changing our son's name to Pablo so I'm never have to be remembered of you.
and stuck at your little bitch.
you are off tomorrow, come take me out.
dude, back in the saddle!
who's the unsuspecting lovely lady?
her name? -Yes.
the thing that you will be calling out in bed.
if she's all upon you...
sandy
it's your boss' name, isn't it?
wait a minute, are you gonna date your boss?
Oh that's hot.
Oh, wait no, she's like 60 though, I thought.
she's 40.
but she got like a hundred kids though.
two
so, when's this all going down?
actually, tonight.
dude...
tonight's my showcase.
I sent you a postcard.
right. It's just that she already hired another babysitter.
work's been really busy so finding another time would be virtually impossible.
you'll understand.
welcome one and all to the second annual Holligan theater, group showcase workshop.
I am your host, actor, director, choreographer, Magnus Croom.
thank you.
you are about to see 46.
of the most daring the most empathetic beings in this out fair city.
offering to you, performances from their favorite works of stage and screens.
please keep your seats throughout.
for there will be no intermission. Thank you and let the magic begin.
Stella!
Stella!
to be...
or not be.
that is the question.
whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
there he is.
I had him in view.
I was feeling over the edge into a dive.
he saw me when I moved in for the kill.
is that how you remember it, Maverick?
is this Top Gun? - Not pretty sure.
the rules of engagement are not flexible, Maverick.
they are there for your safety you will obey them, is that clear?
maverick!
Yes, sir, very clear.
I guess we...
I...
was just a little over enthusiastic.
I guess you were...
platoon!
platoon!
Hey, oh bro, I'm so glad you made it.
I made it... I'm here.
... Saw the whole thing.
even your part.
was that Top Gun? - You know it was.
we thought you were really great.
I loved your postmodern take on the whole thing...
and it was creative how you acknowledged how definitive it was.
thank you.
thank you so much.
I told you guys...
I told you people would get it.
you gotta go party with us.
I guess in a tree house.
outdoor shower.
refrigerator. - In a refrigerator?
all over it.
in the display case of the coffee shop where I work.
don't do that...
the craziest place.
I have to say...
on the surfboard, in the ocean.
Sesha Buche.
it's really romantic.
Hello, Aram.
I've been thinking a lot about you lately.
Hi, Alice.
I have regrets about, you know, how I broke up with you.
I found I have this problem with sex because I just use it to get what I want and I really think that's what I did with you.
I would love to meet with you, so we can talk and make some apologies to you.
amends? - Yes, amends.
I'm really sorry.
you know, I should get going. I don't wanna keep my sister waiting.
what?
I'm so hot.
so? It was...
long.
I know, I think that you went to a hotel or something.
Oh please.
honey, what's with your hair?
what?
okay, fine.
it was awkward and cute and tedious.
did you just say cute and tedious?
I mean he's a kid and it was tedious.
sounds like you didn't give him a chance.
did you even kiss those young, soft lips? - We didn't get there.
we went to his friend's acting showcase and to this after party at The Loft.
acting showcase?
but now I need a bath.
alright. My God.
what?
thanks for babysitting.
okay.
sorry you couldn't get laid. - Shut up.
tedious. - Just to get rid of her.
it was or it wasn't it?
Oh wait a minute, not quite so much tongue.
Oh, God.
that's gross.
Oh shit. - Oh, God.
Frank? What are you doing up?
was Aram peeing on you?
No!
I would never do that.
okay, are you sleeping over?
no. - No.
no? - Oh, well.
don't forget your pants.
so does that mean you and mom are gonna have a baby? - No!
I don't get it you said that sperm makes a baby.
sperm. and it does.
can we stop talking about this, please?
I like your mother and I think she likes me, and it's all that's important.
you also work for her.
who's turn is it? - Mine.
okay.
how is that possible?
so you like mom.
are you two gonna date now? - I don't know.
you don't really know anything, do you?
I mean she's kind of your girlfriend. - Are you gonna be our new dad?
and you'll also be our nanny? - Yeah, and what do we call you?
Jesus, I'm not being nominated to supreme court here guys, I just had sex with your mother.
when I say sex, I, I mean that I gave her a nice massage.
with sperm.
Oh, you conniving little liar. Oh is he hiding in the hall?
my God, he was.
it sounds so dirty. - Dirty?
OK, it's a little dirty.
well you got that out of your system. Now you're free to meet your next real guy.
what does that mean?
what, it means now when you meet a viable man he won't have to be your rebound.
coz your nanny was your rebound.
gives you pleasure to say that, doesn't it?
I'm not sure of buying that "The Rebound" thing.
Oh what, you're gonna date the nanny?
was having one night stand with a nanny more dignified?
no, just more practical.
wait a minute.
you actually have feelings for this kid?
feelings? I have feelings for everyone.
that's the way the world works.
God, you're in serious justification mode.
why do you have to be so cynical?
I mean, I don't judge your blatant disregard's recycling.
this is not about judgment. This is about my friend.
and what is realistic and what is not realistic for her.
it's about me not wanting to see you get hurt.
happy birthday... - Thank you.
1, 2, 3...
we get it.
you need anything?
stop it.
okay.
so did Aram tell you about this operation I'm having?
Harry? - No.
they're gonna give me a new asshole.
there are children here.
cool, like from a dead guy? - Sadie.
I think they're gonna have just passion, one out of something.
hopefully, it's something elastic.
awesome.
excuse me.
this is so... weird.
my dad telling you about his surgery?
yeah... I didn't know they can even do that.
you look really pretty...
no, no...
we are in your parent's house - I know.
where is everybody?
just a little red, I don't think it's trapped.
cake time.
this one is just from me.
gummy bears and hand lotion.
Thanks, Dad.
please. Open your mother's.
no, no, he'll open yours. - You're his mother.
well, you're his employer. I insist.
you'll love it.
it's not fake poop, is it?
no. - That's for Christmas.
Oh, you have Christmas.
what do we got here.
a human totem pole.
gotta get you up here next time
I don't think so.
this is great, thank you so much.
good. - This is perfect.
thanks Mom.
that was just from me. - So nice.
where did you get these butterflies?
my grandmother gave that to my father and I think it's time for you to have that.
the message applies all these years later.
mother's love can never be replaced.
never. - Never.
Thanks, Mom.
it's antique.
whoa, that's cool - Beautiful.
I might throw up. - What's the chances?
60-40
which direction?
70-30. now.
at least you're, we're in your percentages.
sing me a song.
no, you go to bed.
sing me a song, or I'll blow up on you.
when you put it that way.
let's see what I have in my repertoire.
blow up.
stay tonight.
two Months Later
are we sure this guy is real? I mean, has anybody met him?
he has no time to meet us, he has high school and all that homework...
isn't he in a baseball team?
he's just running a little late.
well, he's definitely responsible for an attitude change, because you well, you can't just stop smiling.
she's glowing. - Well, he's doing something right.
I am sorry I'm late.
babysitter needs to be walked through everything.
Hi. I'm Aram.
sorry, this is Aram.
would you like a coke or something?
Scott. - I'll take some wine...
so Aram, I've heard a lot about you.
I hope all good things.
that you're wonderful with children, that you're a great cook...
that you were born in 1983.
Jesus! I was pregnant in 1983.
let's just go on and get it out on the table, get it out in the open so we can enjoy our dinner.
Yes, I was born in the early 80s.
she also told me that you were very handsome and that seems to be true.
I think that it's great you guys are together.
in the words of The Bart:
the heart wants what it wants.
you are so gay.
sir, are you ready?
I can be.
Scott, right? Do you mind if I borrow your glasses?
don't you wanna...
travel around the world, you know get crazy, rock Cleveland do things that people your age supposed to do?
rock Cleveland?
Yeah, rock it.
live.
to tell you the truth this is the most alive I've ever felt.
you're too so goddamn romantic.
what about kids? Kids of your own...
it's not like you're 50.
but I'm an old 40.
what the hell does that mean?
I'm wrinkling.
you have no wrinkles on your face, do you?
you seem to have eyes, something that I really love about you.
I love you.
and when you compliment me I love it, when you compliment me.
you know, I heard you the first time.
I have no idea what you were preferring to.
no? You said I love you. - I didn't say that.
I'm pretty sure you did.
and I love you too.
Really?
sorry, but I do.
just... take it slowly.
slowly.
Teram Owens, the man who wore baggage than a first class passenger on the Titanic.
reaching but funny.
T. O. the big fan of the National Football League wherever he goes he is surrounded by distinct controversy.
I like it.
sex really agrees with your creative side.
are you alright, sweetie? You look pale.
no, I'm just dizzy from following you around.
well, get that to me, please.
right away.
alright.
it helps me think.
we should talk.
I knew this was coming.
you think that books that I read are too juvenile.
I know, it's just I've always liked this stuff...
I'm pregnant.
but...
I pull out most of the time.
I know you're not ready for this, just wanted to let you know that.
I feel the same way from you...
I just thought that you wanted to take things slowly.
I did.
this is...
big.
very... big.
I should've been more careful.
I know this sounds crazy but I think I wanted this to happen.
what?
you said it yourself you don't wanna just coast not just coast along but this isn't coasting.
this is a roller coasting.
Oh, my God.
not Oh God... this is a good thing, not the roller coasting thing, that was cheesy but...
having a baby with you that's not cheesy.
I mean... that's not what I'm saying just...
excited, I wanna be your father.
what?
no, I wanna be a father with you as the mother, that's the important part.
you being a mother.
you know, I thought, I hope that kid is like you.
I hope the kid's like you.
a girl with brown eyes...
or a boy with brown eyes...
or just any color eyes.
well, it's not the baby's head, not your size.
what about Gium?
for a boy.
gIum Finklestein?
okay.
what about Ira?
the doctor will see you now.
great.
okay so...
so?
the blood work is normal.
in other words, your are healthy.
and that is always a good sign for future pregnancy.
what do you mean future?
I mean, this here is what we call an ectopic pregnancy.
there are any number explanations for this, it's not necessarily because of your age.
God. This is something that happens periodically.
an embryo was formed but it intruded inside the fallopian tube instead of the uterus.
sandy, Sandy, Sandy...
this was crazy.
I mean, what were we thinking, anyway?
you are so young.
God!
you live at your parent's house and technically you work for me and I was thinking about having your baby?
what is going on?
so you have to know?
can we just find out?
that is a deceivingly mature thing to say.
why is it deceiving?
because you're 25 years old...
you get drunk off half a beer and you read the Harry Potter series in your spare time.
a lot of adult read those books.
and besides the way I remembered it, you're the one that asked me out.
I appreciate that you feel this could work...
more than you'll ever know.
you were such a good person.
real special person,
I mean not filing a divorce so your horrible ex-wife can get a green card.
What'd be the point?
see, that's what I mean, someone like you shouldn't be with someone like me.
an old girlfriend with two kids.
you're an ageist...
Yeah, yeah... I'm an old ageist.
Oh please, don't patronize me.
I may live with my parents and get drunk off half a beer and yeah, I admit to being slightly adrift as far in my life but I'm not a complete idiot...
I know how I feel about you.
it's you that doesn't know how you feel about me.
I just wish you had the guts to say it.
you've meant so much to me and my family but this doesn't make sense.
and what future can we possibly have?
you know what I'm gonna miss the most?
it's you...
your friendship.
go!

you won 't find those theories at St. Anselm School for Boys.
poor little losers. Aren't you glad you never did drugs?
you never did, right?
I think we should open with this guy's talk, in the room searches. Parents eat that shit up.

what happened to your eyes?
l don't know what you did to him last night, but your husband was in one of his mood again.
thank you very much. - Nicole!
you shouldn't be seen with him.
they all know, Mia. lt's better if we act normal. That way, lt won't look bad after.

Oh Please, that woman has enough drugs everyday to relax China.
good morning, ladies.
Oh, God. - Are we ready for our close-ups?

in every thought, we cut the talk ahead of you.
you know consequences, a system kids can believe in, blah, blah, blah, blah.
and then talk with some of the kids:" l was once lost, but now I'm found." that kinda stuff.
success stories are our specialty here. As a matter of fact, l have an extraordinary.
Oh, I want the footage of the pool once it's clean. Can we get that this weekend?

OK, we'll skip it. But we really want to shoot the kitchen work crew.

Oh, look what l did.
hopkins, could you take this away please?
excuse me.

l bet you're kicking yourselves now, huh?
excuse me.
I'm sure Miss Horner will keep something hot for you.
Mia, why do you make me do that to you?
Why?
you always do it.
and you always will.
no, no, no, no. Only when you misbehave.
like that stunt you pulled on Sunday.
when you do things like that... do you know how bad it makes me feel?
you should think about me sometimes.
l just don't know you.
you know me, Mia.
the problem is, you just don't understand me.
lsn't that right?
l know what my little nun likes.
l thought you weren't coming.
go ahead, get in. Let's go.

we want them to. They're our alibis. C'mon.

Nicole! My, what a surprise!
lrving, it's Nicole.
miss Horner, l should say, now that you're the landlady.
l think about your poor mother every day.
bijou!
well, come in.
no we can't today. We're just here for the weekend. But I would like you to meet my principal, Mrs. Baran.
welcome to Pittsburgh, Mrs. Baran, and the entire Three Rivers area.
Oh, can you manage?
lrving!
lt must be the post office.
I mean half the people that work down there aren't American anymore anyway.
l'll send you another check tomorrow.
l'll drop by for it tomorrow night, say.
you can bring your houseguest if you like.
she'll be busy.
you look more like your mother everyday. From behind you can really see it.
l been to see a lawyer and he tells me... a divorce would be very simple. l could even keep the school.
l don't want to talk about it on the phone, Guy.
I'm at Nicole's house.
fine.
ya. Well, tomorrow night is best.
we'll be out tomorrow.
all right, after 8.
fine. Goodbye.
good for you.
lt's good to get it over with. Now you can get on with everything.
huh, l should take him off speed dial.
one good drink ought to do it.
l can't do this.
he's never gonna leave you alone. Does he leave me alone?
if I give him the school-- - If you give him the school, he'll just sell it.
then where will the future Lee Harvey Oswalds come from?
anyway, it's not like he's the one that won't let go.
what do you mean?
what I mean is, you still want him... but you won't keep sleeping with him.
lt's not love. You don't love people who treat you this way.
Where'd you get that, off a talk show?
you know, I'm not surprised he likes to come to me after he sleeps with you.
l don't care. l hate him.
l don't feel anything.
l don't feel anything.
you don't feel anything?
how about when he does this?
do you feel anything... when he does this?
you don't feel anything?
he doesn't do that to me.
don't lie to me. We won't get anywhere if you start lying to me now.
l know it's me. lt's my fault.
lt's not your fault. -l know.
snap out of it! lt's not your fault, it's his. He is who he is.
he'll keep being who he is and doing what he does and do it and do it...
we'll never be free until he's dead.
he's my husband, Nicole.
Oh yeah? Well, last week he was happy to stand by and watch you die.
pull yourself together. You gonna scare him away.
he always parks out there so the neighbors won't see him.
he'll be coming in through the back door. -You're going?
Yes, I'm going to the neighbours and keep them busy. I need 10 minutes.
okay?
okay? - Yeah.
courage.
make yourself one.
l want you to hear what I'm saying Guy. I'm serious.
Ooh, Mia's serious.
give me the goddamn drink.
lt's for your own good.
I'll be a lot easier to handle with this a lot in me, right?
right.
lt's a little cloudy. - What?
whatever.
do you want to talk or do you want to stare at me all night?
the lawyer says l can divorce you and keep the school.
l inherited it before we married. -You put me on the title.
you need me to sign a quitclaim deed.
he didn't mention that?
what's the matter?
are you all right?
what?
what were we talking about?
the title.
you forgot I'm on the title. -I could buy you out.
l could get a loan.
you give me the school, and l'll give you a divorce.
frankly l didn't have to get married to have lousy sex.
no, l did.
come on Mia.
woo, why don't you have a drink with me.
what did l ever do to you Guy? What did l do so wrong?
you try living with an fucking angel. lt's easier living with a dog.
I'm not your dog.
did you do something with your hair?
ya, you did something with your hair.
let me make you feel good like you know I can.
lsn't that nice?
you don't want to split up, do you? -You don't love me.
but you can't let go.
what was that? -Something on TV.
Oh, you're so good, Bijou!
that was her alarm bark.
lt's like her stranger bark, only a little bit higher.
that doesn't sound very good, that kind of noise.
why don't l just turn up the TV a little bit?
we just heard from Tim and Tracy... ...who've been married less than a year... ...but already separated five times. Will they reconcile? We'll try to find out.
don't you run away from me!
when is she coming back?
you feel that? You feel it?
what did you do for feelings before l came along?
you shouldn't get me mad.
lt won't happen again.
come here, Mia.
have another drink, Guy.
you deserve it.
What're you doing to me?
listen!
I don't know you that well, but I'm glad you got us here.
don't ever come back to Tennesse again!
I hope that was an empty bottle George. You can't afford to waste good liquor.
I'm waiting until this is in color.
bitch, you trying to kill me?
help me.
say you're sorry Guy.
l love you.
how is he?
wasn't quick like you said. -Or quiet.
lt's attempted murder now if he does wake up.
we have no choice. Come on.
get out his wallet.
it's ok if your fingerprints are on it.
check to see if there's any gas station receipts.
there's nothing. -Okay, put it back.
put it back.
go turn on the radio in case there's more noise.
get the water bottle!
ls it over? -lt's over.
are you all right?
you're blaming yourself.
don't.
for wanting him, l mean.
that was the same way.
Oh, my God!
he tried to move! He was alive!
let lrv help.
look at them. lt's too heavy.
this is lrv.
he's good at this kind of thing. -Allow me.
lt's fine. -Please.

Thanks, lrv. -Wait!

Nicole's always been a cold fish. -Yeah
Bijou, Bad dog.

push.
come on.
go get the lights.
go.
Oh, my God.
shit.
bastard.
alright, it's over. We better get the hell out of here.
he'll never hurt us again.
what do we do now?
wait for the body to surface.
they'll do an autopsy maybe.
he was drunk, he fell in.
when will it come up?
tomorrow, maybe.
come on, you can't pull that off.
why hasn't he risen yet? -lt'll happen.
be patient.
l won't be able to do this.
well, l suggest you try.
lt isn't like you burnt the toast Mia.
you kill your husband, it's off the chart, demerit-wise.
understand?
you're so calm.
look at you.
your hair is done.
you have makeup on.
this is a day like any other day.
we did what we had to do, and it's done.
lt was self-defense.
you've taken it for too long. You finally said, "Fuck off."
good for you. Fuck him.
fuck them.
everything but fuck you.
roughly. Now come on.
places.
l desire.
they desire.
they desire. Feminine.
miss Horner, while the cat's away, the mice shall-- - Ok, apparently.
not at all. Guy and l talked to a new supplier Friday. We've been meaning to.
portions are smaller. -Is Dr. Baran here?
his car's back in the garage. lt was gone all weekend.
excuse me? -Because if he is, could you ask him... if he's going to take his classes tomorrow? l can't possibly
Mrs. Baran?
you idiot. - Huh?
why are you torturing her? lt's obvious she doesn't know where he is.
miss Horner, please. The students.
I don't blame you though anyway. He could make an effort for your sakes.
for her sake.
you're drawing attention to yourself.
I'm allowed to brood.
my husband's disappeared.
you'll feel better when the body surfaces.
yea. lt always perks me up.
what do your saints say?
I'm brooding. I'm not praying.
lost your faith huh?
l never really had any to begin with I guess...
never believed in any of it.
God, the Virgin Mary, that life begins at 40... ...and that people are all just basically good inside.
pretty soon, we'll be the same person.
see how nice things turned out?
I'm going inside.
you know, it wasn't too smart, changing the food like that.
he never would've really done that if he's alive. -What's the point in killing him then?
l like making it better for the boys.
still, If its the same for you l'd rather not hang for fried chicken.
Nicole, why did you kill him?
you could've left him. You could've left here.
l was underestimated.
stop looking at it. People are watching us.
can't stand it much longer.
finally.
we goona have to get the net from the shed!
who wants to go?
Desantis.
now we'll have to drain the pool.
l'll get it.
No!
why not? -He's a child.
go and see if you can find it.
I saw something down there.
it's a lighter.
hey hey hey, that's Dr. Baran's.
remember the close-up in the office, he's playing with it?
did you see anything else?
that's enough. Go inside and change.
now take that up to Dr. Baran's office.
we'll have to drain the pool.
and refill it? -Well that's up to Dr. Baran.
alright everybody that's enough. Go on. Go inside and get ready for class. Go on.
Mia? -Mr. Gannon, will you drain the pool?
l've got orders not to.
my keys are in there.
please?
right away, please.
here's the penis... ...and the scrotum... ... that holds the testicles or testes inside.
now, when you're around 14, maybe sooner, maybe later... the testes make a chemical called a hormone.
this hormone causes the changes.
it starts hair growing here... and under your arms and on your face.
since you want it done right away, l can't help the noise.
go on, Mr. Nunez.
Atlantic... Pacific... lndian... Arctic?
arctic.
class... Atlantic... Pacific... lndian... Arctic... Mediterranean... Gulf of Mexico... and Caribbean, Australasian... Hudson Bay... Baltic Sea... North Sea... English Channel... lrish Sea... Bering Sea.
Mrs. Baran fainted! Let's go.
get a doctor! -l'll go!
the doctor's very worried about you. He thinks this is serious.
Where's the body?
someone moved it, that's apparent.
someone saw us put it in? -No.
well, l don't know. Maybe.
I've got to find him.
no, Mia.
let's just stick to our story, ok? lt's even better like this, 'cause we don't know where he is.
he'll turn up. lf he doesn't, all the better.
okay? Did you take your heart medicine? No.
we gotta act naturally. You have to stop asking about Guy.
be concerned, like you would be if he was really missing.
what? -His suit.
Oh, my God.
4 x 6 color prints. Can l have those in 20 minutes?
ask her.
tell her if she sees anything, to call us.
he's disappeared.
let's just get these and get out of here.
someone's watching us. Someone with Guy's camera.
you need to eat, honey. -I'm not hungry, thank you.
he is dead, Mia.
he is dead. We killed him together. You saw him die.
what about the pictures?
I think someone took them before he was killed.
right? -Who?
well we'll find out when they start blackmailing us.
he's dead.
this is another thing.
well there's something I haven't told you.
open it.
lt's the school accounts. That's why there's never any money there.
lt was for Guy and me. He told me someone stole it, but l found it when I was looking for the body.
you killed him for money.
believe me, it wasn't the only reason.
there's $50, 000 there, Mia.
we'll split it.
you can use it to pay for your god damn fried chicken.
l can go to the police.
l can tell them what we did, what you did.
we both did it.
yeah well I don't think they won't see that as beneficial to me.
they'll say the wife gets the school, the money, her freedom.
what does the other woman get?
nothing. That's how they'll look at it.
l'll say we were lovers.
you can take the girl out of the convent...
l thought we had the same reason.
we did have the same reason.
l just had an extra one.
I'm sorry l lied to you. l couldn't do it now.
lf you hadn't found this... you killed the person who could tell you where it was.
he said we were partners... and then he acted alone.
Where're you going? -l've gotta go.
what are you talking about?
this, it was under my door this morning. lt's over. He's been found.
this is Sunbury, it's 20 miles from here. Now how would he get there?
I dunno, someone took him from the pool and dump into the river. I dunno!
OK, Mia. But I think we should call the police first and file a missing persons report.
l've gotta go. lt's him.
alright l'll go with you.
no, l'll wait. Fine.
you can wait in there. -No, l'll be fine.
just...Don't let him forget me.
you're not gonna light that, are you?
you can light these, in America?
no, I'm quitting. Nicorette.
excuse me... my husband is missing.
l think this might be him.
how long? -Four days.
you file a missing persons report? -No.
so has he left before without telling you?
the description fits.
John Doe, 180 pounds, six foot even? -Right.
describe his clothes. -lt says the body was naked.
we don't tell the press everything.
l didn't see him the day he disappeared.
any jewelry?
a wedding ring, that's all.
he doesn't always wear that.
can l see the body?
appendectomy scar? -No.
l see. No.
hold on.
Howie, l think we have Mrs. Doe here.
you gotta prepare yourself. The sand does a lot of damage.
Oh, my God.
ls that your husband, ma'am?
no.
poor kid.
wasn't her husband. Never saw him before in her life.
excuse me?
Mrs. Baran?
who are you? -Please forgive me for intruding.
come, sit down.
coffee, please.
I, I saw you at the sheriff station. I got your name off the view request.
Shirley Vogel.
you're the police?
Cagney and Lacey that kind of thing.
you know they met with me once. Research stuff. Nice girls.
l say "girls," is that okay with you?
anyway, flash forward 10 years. I'm on medical leave. The big C. Air.
I'm sorry.
whatever. l knew it was coming.
with my family, never two boobs in a coffin.
I'm sorry, but I dunno why you are here?
remember your husband?
could l get some coffee, please?
you mean... I'm sure he'll turn up.
ya, wrapped around the pier apparently. You drove all the way down here from
that's very kind of you, but...
who the hell am l, right? l don't blame you.
look, l know a guy in the department in Hazelton.
l could call him, he'll visit, get the details. -l don't want to make it official.
suppose it's just...intentional.
here's your coffee. -Ya l know what you mean.
men.
how do they sleep at night?
they have sex, that's how they sleep at night.
he might be home already.
this place. Jesus. lt's no Sizzler, is it?
he'll be furious if l go to the police.
that's what I'm trying to tell ya. You gotta keep it private. Now once the boys get their hooks into you...
you know, l couldn't afford you. We run a school.
a school? Then you can forget the police.
you can't afford that kind of publicity.
two, three days, l chase him down to some girlfriend's house... and I scare the shit out of him.
that wouldn't be easy.
look... l don't want money.
I mean look at me. I'm chasing all over Pennslyvania for lunch dates... with guys l couldn't stand 10 years ago.
give me something to do.
you ever smoke?
look at this security system. What's this? A piece of the 2 Cross?
aren't you hungry?
l thought l should eat, but...
you know what your problem is?
you're feeling guilty.
no... I'm not.
lt's not your fault. lt's men. Testosterone.
they should put in bombs.
want that?
Mrs. Baran would like me to help informally.
well, Miss Vogel--or is it Detective?
detective.
now frankly detective, l don't think we need to overreact. We've seen this before.
we have?
we, we, we. What is she, the school nurse?
when was the last time you saw your husband?
last Saturday.
he was asleep when we left at 7. Nicole and l drove out to her duplex.
Oh look!
this must be nice, when it's full. lsn't it kinda dangerous, keeping it empty like this?
ya, Well we lost some keys in there.
you know, I think we should get back to our students, they're on work crew this week.
yes sure l noticed. Must save money I bet having the kids keep up the place. These older buildings.
so, none of his friends know where he might be?
we haven't asked them. You know, it's kinda awkward "Hey, my husband's disappeared. Have you seen him?" You know.
her husband. lt wouldn't be awkward for me.
lf it's okay with you, Mrs Baran maybe l could take a look at his address book?
you know Detective? I dont think we need to make a mountain out of a molehill.
exactly. Can you imagine this place crawling with the police?
wouldn't be that kinda thing to write home in letters about. Now Would it ? we'll tip-toe.
will you be kind enough to show me your husband's things? -Of course.
so nice meeting you, Miss Horner.
Oh this is lucky. The phone bill.
I think it came this morning.
may l?
this must be Miss Horner.
pittsburgh. Earlier this month.
l call her there sometimes when she goes there on weekends.
53 minutes.
72 minutes. Girl talk.
this goes through Monday. He didn't call you there over the weekend? - No -What kind of car does he drive? -We have one car, the blue Cherokee.
how'd you break the taillight? -l don't know. lt's old.
what was he wearing when he disappeared?
his blue suit.
can l see his closet?
Yes.
lt's missing. His blue suit... and his belt with the silver buckle.
you just have to look and you know. Good for you.
a place for everything and everything in its place.
l hope we're not too late. There's video cameras out there.
is that the news? -Oh no no, it's just the PR for the school.
ls that all detective? I'm really tired. -Of course.
the address book?
lt's in his office.
l'll find it.
just one more thing. That isn't the suit there, is it?
Mia, you need to take Vawze's classes-- Oh detective, you're still here.
l was wondering if this is the suit Dr. Baran was wearing on Sunday.
no. But close. He had two.
well, maybe l'll go and speak with some other teachers now.
why'd you bring her here?
I'm supposed to act concerned. Anyway, it keeps the police away.
fine.
that woman should wear a prosthesis. l hate all that in your face survivor crap.
I'm really tired, Nicole.
lt's okay. You did fine. l heard you from the hallway.
just don't see her alone anymore.
promise?
can l get a printout of that?
you can get a dub of it too.
Oh this is really some cool stuff. Totally Inside Edition material.
Oh yeah. The Magic Hour tape. This guy gives the "prick" a bad name.
who doesn't?
l want this one too.
okay, if X equals four, then X minus 2 is?
two. -Great.
ten plus X, when X equals 3 is?
I'm talking to you.
thirteen. -Thank you.
Mrs. Baran needs you.
review these equations.
continue to work them until l return. And stay in your seats.
this is Miss Horner.
Nicole, this is Lisa Campos.
miss Campos is looking for Guy.
I'm sure Mrs. Baran told you that Dr. Baran is away on business.
you said you didn't know where he was.
well, someone has to pay.
he said he would, but... l thought it over. l don't want to wait until next month like he said.
what is it?
miss Campos is expecting.
unto her, a child will be born.
what is this have to do with Dr. Baran? -What do you think?
what makes you think it's Guy's?
that's what he said. But, come on, l would know.
l don't sleep around.
and he said he'd pay.
I'm not putting it on my card. I'm maxed out.
so you're absolutely certain this is Dr. Baran's?
what does she have to say? -Abortion is murder.
well I'm gonna have an anesthetic, for God's sake.
how much will this gonna cost?
they want 650, and that's a clinic.
I'm not holding anybody up here you know. l just want what he promised. Besides... it's your husband. You don't want me to have his baby.
l wouldn't have come, only he said you knew about his girlfriends... Mrs Baran.
thank you.
and tell him not to call when he does get back.
lt's boundary time.
lncidentally... when was the last time you saw Dr. Baran?
Sunday afternoon.
l dropped by. He was real wired up about something.
figured you two had a fight.
make him pay you back.
anyway... goodbye.
you knew about her? -Yeah.
since last fall.
right after you came.
you should've told me about her.
why would l want you to be hurt like l was?
somebody knows.
they got a license plate. They could've gotten a number wrong.
but it looks like his car was there, except we don't know if he was driving.
l was just telling Mrs. Baran l ran Dr. Baran's license plate through the DMD.
that pileup Monday evening on the l-80, he was in it.
the report doesn't tell us say much, but his car's on the printout, it's 1 of 22.
didn't you tell me it was an old dent? -Did l?
let's say he left Sunday, wearing the blue suit.
could he been heading to Pittsburgh?
you know he stopped for gas Sunday late in Williamsport.
Yes, Mrs. Baran gave me his credit card numbers on the phone this morning.
anyway, doesn't it looks like he was trying to see you?
pittsburgh is a big town.
you're sure you didn't hear from him anytime after Saturday?
dear, aren't you on room checks? -Oh yeah. Excuse me.
l'll be in touch.
I'm glad she didn't ask.
there weren't any charges on the cards from Sunday on. What are room checks?
drug searches. Some of the kids here used to use.
my son had a habit years ago.
my husband and l looked in this kinda place. He's dead now.
your husband? -Son.
lv drug users. You know what happens to them nowadays.
but my ex is alive.
lsn't God quirky? You got an ex? -Nothing official.
mine thought he was God's gift to women, like that was the first thing on my list.
God, please send me something that will wear black nylon socks to bed every night of his life.
my idea of heaven is where they screw you barefoot.
you make me want to pass the hat for you. -Don't feel sorry for me.
I got him to leave. Every cloud has a silver lining. He was too dull to kill.
what about her? She ever want to kill her husband? -Why would she want to do that?
maybe she found out you were sleeping with him.
Oh that's so clever. What did you do? Ask one of the faculty or any of the students?
Oh l know. You read it in the brochure, right?
so she knew? -Of course she knew. Ask her.
come on, she's not a murderer. She's an ex-nun. For Christ's sake.
remember them?
they disappeared overnight, like dial phones.
what about you? What if he wouldn't leave her?
honey if l couldn't get a man to leave her, I won't kill him, l'd kill myself.
well, he has left her... apparently. One way or another.
unless there's anything else... -Just one more thing.
guy did it barefoot.
"Did"?
don't you mean, "does"?
Mrs. Baran?
lt's dinnertime, Erik.
you should go inside with the others.
are you okay?
you know the rules, Erik.
your table won't be able to eat before you're there.
lt's so much nicer here since he left.
l hope he never comes back.
Where'd you find those? -l found them yesterday.
give them to me.
they're good though, they're just a little rusty. -Give them to me!
lt doesn't mean anything.
the pool was empty and maybe he saw them at the bottom.
l didn't. Did you?
lf they were so plain to see... Don't you see what it means?
ya, it means we overlooked them.
lt means Guy's watching us. He's alive.
he's dead. And I'm not sorry.
and neither are you, if you're really honest with yourself.
killing him is a good thing, like planting a tree.
maybe there is a God. -What're you talking about?
l haven't believed for so long.
so when the pool was empty, l thought... maybe there is a God.
and he knows what we did. And he's coming for us.
lt's not God, honey. That's a lady detective with one breast.
you're always laughing at me.
so was Guy.
he must be laughing now.
I'm not laughing at you, Mia.
you are, a little... inside.
lt's lonely without God, isn't it?
lt's just lonely... period.
they're filling the pool!
when will it be done? -Soon! lt's great!
we should have canceled this.
everything's fine. Just calm down.
20 bucks they killed him.
dykes. -That will explain why they're not all over you.
Thanks.
you know we really could use Dr. Baran in this shot.
well, he's still away on business, so we'll do without him.
l don't want to be in it.
lt's Parents' Day and these are your parents.
boys, you're happy, but try not to look relieved, okay?
I'm glad to see your mom and dad but boy, is this school great!
moms, one or two of you can look misty-eyed.
who wants to be misty? -OK here!
all right, you and you. Don't overdo it.
everyone have their numbers? Number one.
ls that Dr. Baran?
what are you talking about?
up there, on second floor at the window.
wait, l'll play it back.
lt's someone, that's for sure.
lt's Guy.
lt's Guy.
What're you doing?
I'm fasting and praying for our sins.
l want you to stop that. Come inside.
you're not well.
each time l go to sleep, l have to kill him over and over.
no, Mia, someone's playing a game with us.
come inside. You're ill.
lt's holy water.
come on.
what are you looking at? Go inside!
let's get out of here! -Go in!
go!
Where's your heart medicine? -I'm sure it's there.
no, l think you're out. l'll goto the pharmacy and get it refilled.
you should take these.
here, go on.
you'll be out of the light before l return. -l want you to go, Nicole.
okay! -No, l mean, away.
leave the school, for good.
I'm sick of you.
lf they only knew. -They will if you keep acting like this.
you know Mia the church can't save you now, no matter how much you pay them off.
look, l know you gave that priest my money.
money shouldn't go to people who love you.
lt should go to people you love.
they don't love you, they used you. And now that you're scared, you're using them too.
like you used me? You were a good teacher Nicole. We should've paid you more.
you like playing the victim. -Get out!
leave me alone!
fine, if that's what you want. Now let me tell you one thing from one saint to another: You should keep on praying. Wear your knees out that way for a change.
Hello?
Hello?!
who's there?
who's there?
get the water bottle.
he's dead.
he's dead. He's dead.
God forgive you. He's dead.
you're a lot tougher than l thought, you little bitch.
Jesus, Guy.
sucking on that douche bag hose for 8 hours.
and that ride in the back... l've still got a cold.
l don't care what the doctors say. That fucking heart was made of iron.
l tried to reach you to call it off.
call it off? What for?
l wish l could've seen her face.
some of those gags were great.
What're we gonna do with that god damn detective now?
snooping around. She got hers.
you were supposed to call me.
I think you should find the body.
l'll show up tomorrow and you can break the news to me.
l'll be grief-stricken.
l think you should go.
go?
Why? Haven't you missed me? -Ya.
that's better. lt's over.
so let's celebrate. -Ok, but I...
l don't want you to get caught. You bet.
ls this natural?
l mean, the tub was full.
shouldn't she be undressed? -Yeah, okay.
l thought she was dead!
l thought she was. l did. lt's over.
she's not gonna do anything. We'll think of something else. -Lying bitch!
just let her go! -You're with her!
you are. -No, I'm not! Mia, go!
bitch!
just you wait!
don't you run away!
l said stop!
come here!
let me see your face!
was it lonely week, or did you two keep each other company?
how does it feel, after all these years of sainthood, finding out we're perfectly match?
you're just like me. Soul mates.
bitch!
want to confess before you die?
say, "I'm sorry, Guy. " Maybe l'll forgive you, even if God won't.
fuck you!
you son of a bitch. This is a week late, asshole.
Oh, Jesus.
Mia, come on.
this way it'll be easier to claim self-defense.
you know, paramedics can work miracles.
one of us should go get one.
I'm sorry.
goodbye.
your move.
that's a bold move. - I live on the edge.
nice work, dumb-ass.
I've given thought to moving off the edge.
not an ideal location.
make it a place in the middle. - A toast!
toast!
quiet!
shut up!
I'm... I got words.
I'm saying, this is an auspicious day.
we all know what day it is.
suspicious. What day is it?
a glorious day for all the proud members of the allied planets.
unification Day!
the end of the scumbag Independents and the dawn of a new galaxy.
captain.
just feel the need for another drink.
what month is it?
Hey, you gonna drink to the Alliance with me?
six years today, the Alliance sent the browncoats running...
...pissing their pants.
you know, your coat is kind of a brownish color.
it was on sale.
you didn't toast.
you know, I'm thinking you're one of them Independents.
I'm thinking you weren't burdened with an overabundance of schooling.
why don't we just ignore each other till we go away?
the Independents were a bunch of cowardly, inbred piss pots.
should've been killed off of every world spinning.
share that to my face.
I said, you're a coward and a piss pot.
now, what are you gonna do about it? - Nothing.
I wanted you to face me so she could get behind you.
drugs are so cute.
Jayne. - Hey, I didn't fight no war.
best of luck, though.
fine.
let's do this.
a grand entrance would not go amiss.
is Jayne even awake?
there's just an acre of you fellows, isn't there?
this is why we lost, you know. Superior numbers.
thanks for the reenactment, sir.
Hey, hey, them ain't kosherized rules.
I'm thinking somebody needs to put you down, dog.
what do you think?
I'm thinking we'll rise again.
every man there, go back inside or we will blow a new crater in this little moon.
damn yokels can't even tell a transport ship ain't got no guns on it.
blow a new crater in this moon."
my thanks, Wash.
nice save, as always. - A pleasure.
and how are our passengers? - They're fine.
so, what happened? Was there a terrible brawl?
there was. - Are you getting my wife into trouble?
What...? I didn't start it. Just wanted a quiet drink.
funny how you always find yourself in an Alliance-friendly bar...
...come U-day, looking for a quiet drink.
this is another sign of your tragic space dementia, all paranoid and crotchety.
breaks a heart.
did we at least make a contact?
ladies and menfolk, we have ourselves a job.
take us out of the world, Wash.
we got us some crime to be done.
river, it's okay.
it's me.
you know who I am?
were you dreaming?
did you dream about the Academy? - It's not relevant.
if you can talk about what happened there...
I know it's hard, but the more I know, the faster you'll get better.
this isn't home.
no.
no, we can't go home.
if we go home, they'll just send you back to the Academy.
this is safer now.
we're on a ship.
Mid-bulk transport.
standard radian accelerator core, class code 03-K64.
firefly. - Well, that's something.
I can't even remember all that.
you need a weave on that? - It's nothing.
I expect there's someone's face feels differently.
they tell you, never hit a man with a closed fist...
...but it is, on occasion, hilarious.
I suppose so.
so the fight didn't draw any attention?
no Feds. Just an honest brawl between folk.
none of us want the Alliance on us, doctor. That's why you're here.
I thought I was here because you needed a medic.
well, not today.
Bad..."
...in the Latin.
shepherd Book. - Captain.
how's the girl?
still a little whimsical in the brain pan. Seems calm enough, though.
that young man's very brave. - Yeah.
he's my hero.
he gave up everything to free his sister from that place.
go from being a doctor on the central planets...
...to hiding on the fringes of the system.
there's not many would do that. - I suppose not.
there's not many would take him in, either.
why did you?
same reason I took you onboard, Shepherd. I need the fare.
neither of us can pay a tenth of what your crew makes on one of your jobs.
are you referring to our legitimate business enterprises?
I'm wondering why a man so anxious...
...to fly under Alliance radar would house known fugitives.
the Alliance had her in that institution for a purpose, whatever it was.
and they will want her back.
you're not overly fond of the boy. So why risk it?
because it's the right thing to do.
Oh, would you look at this.
I'm wondering if you know why you're doing it.
what about you? How come you're flying about with us brigands?
shouldn't you be off bringing religiosity to the fuzzy-wuzzies or some such?
Oh, I got heathens aplenty right here.
if I'm your mission, Shepherd, best give it up.
you're welcome on my boat.
God ain't.
where the hell's that girl?
do you want me to put it up? - No, that's okay.
you have such lovely hair.
I'm sure the doctor would agree.
who, Simon?
he's much too... I mean, I'm just...
do you think it looks better up? - We could experiment.
we might even get wild later and wash your face.
you ever do this for your clients?
very occasionally. Not all of them have enough hair to get a brush through.
have you ever had to service a really hideous client? With boils and the like?
a companion chooses her own clients. That's Guild law.
but physical appearance doesn't matter so terribly.
you look for compatibility of spirit.
there's an energy about a person that's difficult to hide. You try to feel that...
then you try to feel the energy of their credit account.
it has a sort of aura.
what did I say to you about barging in?
that it was manly and impulsive? - Yes, precisely.
only the exact phrase I used was, "Don't."
you're holding my mechanic enthralled.
Kaylee, what's going on in the engine room?
were there monkeys? Some terrifying space monkeys maybe got loose?
I rewired the graph thrust. Somebody won't replace that compression coil.
get the place squared away. It's dangerous in there.
and I ain't paying you to get your hair played at.
we work before we play.
you're servicing crew now? - In your lonely, pathetic dreams.
what do you want?
may have a job. - Congratulations.
on a decently civilized planet where I could screen some respectable clients?
respectable clients, that seems a contradiction.
don't start.
there's...
we haven't got a location yet.
we'll be landing on a skyplex in a bit, run by a fellow called Niska.
never heard of him. - Well, I have.
while we're there, you'll stay confined to the ship.
is the petty criminal ashamed to be riding with a companion?
this guy has a very unlovely rep. He's got work for me, fine.
but I don't...
I'm not sure you'd be safe.
Mal, if you're being a gentleman, I may die of shock.
have you got time to do my hair? - Out.
is fine. Crow, they can come in.
and Malcolm Reynolds is which? - I'm Capt. Reynolds.
my first mate Zoe. This is Jayne. - Very nice.
I am Adelai Niska.
you have seen Crow. He loves to stand at the door to say, "Boo."
we got word you might have a job for us.
Yes.
Yes, an exciting job.
a train has something I need.
you have worked a train before? - We did a few.
are you going to ask me what it is I need?
as a rule, no.
Yes, good. You have reputation.
"malcolm Reynolds gets it done," is the talk.
well, glad to hear that.
you know what is reputation?
is people talking, is gossip.
I also have reputation not so pleasant, I think you know. Crow.
now, for you, my reputation is not from gossip.
you see this man? He does not do the job.
I show you what I do with him and now my reputation for you is fact.
is solid.
you do the train job for me...
...then you are solid.
no more gossip.
right.
Oh, you do not like I kill this man.
Oh, no, I'm sure he was a very bad person.
my wife's nephew. At dinner, I'm getting earful.
there is no way out of that.
so... Oh, the train job. Come in.
here, in fifth car, two boxes. Alliance goods.
you don't mind the taking from Alliance, I think, from your reputation.
you get on train at Hancock headed for Paradiso.
you take boxes off before you reach Paradiso and deliver to Crow...
...here.
half money now, Crow give you other half at rendezvous point.
anything goes wrong, then your reputation only gossip...
...and things between us not so solid.
yes?
how long till we hit Paradiso? - 20 minutes.
we should be in the foothills in five.
let's get to work.
he's a psycho, you know. Niska.
he's not the first psycho to hire us, nor the last.
you think that's a commentary on us?
I have an image of a guy hanging from the ceiling.
I got an image of it not being me. Let's do the thing.
Hi.
shepherd.
good day.
so...
...how do you think it's going? - The caper?
mal knows what he's doing.
how long have you known him?
I've been on the ship eight months now.
I'm not certain I'll ever actually know the captain.
I'm surprised a respectable companion would sail with this crew.
it's not always this sort of work.
they take the jobs they can get, even legitimate ones.
the further from the central planets, the harder things are.
this is part of it.
I wish I could help.
I mean, I don't want to help...
not "help" help. Not with the thieving, but...
I do feel awfully useless.
you could always pray they make it back safely.
I don't think the captain would much like me praying for him.
don't tell him.
I never do.
go on. Straight through.
keep moving.
sir, is there some information we might maybe be lacking...
...as to why there's an entire Fed squad sitting on this train?
it doesn't concern us. - It kind of concerns me.
they're not protecting the goods. If they were, they wouldn't let people past.
think that changes the situation a bit? - I surely do.
it makes it more fun.
sir, I think you have a problem with your brain being missing.
come on.
we stick to the plan. We get the goods.
we're on Serenity before the train reaches Paradiso.
only now we do it under the noses of 20 trained Alliance Feds.
and that makes them look all manner of stupid.
this job I would pull for free.
can I have your share? - No.
if you die, can I have your share? - Yes.
Hey.
Oh, hey, doctor.
you really should just call me Simon.
Oh, I'll do that then.
so...
...what are we doing? - Oh, crime.
crime?
good.
okay, crime. - It's a train heist.
you see, we fly over the train car, the captain and Zoe sneak in...
...we lower Jayne onto the car, and they bundle up the booty...
...and we haul them all back up. Easy as lying.
they've done this before? - Hell, no.
is there anything I can...? Something I should be doing?
staying the hell out of everyone's way.
no call to be snappy.
are you about to jump onto a moving train?
the captain ain't around. I'm in charge. - Since when?
just because Mal says you're medic, don't make you part of the crew.
just play at figuring what's wrong with that sister of yours till we call for you.
right.
you shouldn't be so rude to him.
because he's all rich and fancible? - He's not rich.
the Alliance crashed his accounts when he snuck out his sister.
Yeah, we could all be rich if we handed her back.
you're not even thinking that. - Mal is.
that's not funny. - He ain't stupid.
why would he take on trouble like those two if there weren't no profit in it?
captain's got a move he ain't made yet. You'll see.
time for some thrilling heroics.
Niska's sources better be good.
shining.
find the cargo.
all hail the great Alliance.
fifteen seconds.
go! - Go. Go now!
come on.
where are the others? - They shot my gorram leg.
are they still on the train? Are they gonna be okay?
everybody off!
come on, everybody off!
our man didn't get a look.
well, jeez, can someone find out what they took?
keep those people together. Quiet them down.
it's medicine, sir.
all of the supplies.
they stole the gorram medicine? We been waiting...
all of it? - Every ounce.
God help us.
son of a bitch.
what's the fuss? - All network alert. Cargo theft.
medical shipment lifted off a train en route to Paradiso.
six crates of Pescaline D. That will get you a tidy fortune on the black market.
tag it received. Bounce it back. Locals can deal with it.
sir, there is a regiment holding in Paradiso.
they were headed to the installation.
then get them back on the train. Who's holding them there?
the sheriff requested we deploy if you'd help...
these are federal marshals, not local narcotic hounds.
they've got better things to do.
so do we.
JAYNE: Gorram it, let's get us moving.
now, I'm not finished.
this ain't the rendezvous spot. - It is now.
Niska's people are not partial to waiting. - Let them read a magazine.
we don't make the sale until Mal and Zoe are back.
these are stone killers. They ain't cuddly.
I'm not flying anywhere without my wife.
she'll be okay. She's with the captain.
there, you see. Everybody wins.
doc, I need a pop to quiet this pain some.
all right, but what about the authorities?
we're sitting here with stolen Alliance goods. Won't they look for us?
they buzz this canyon, we'll hear them before they see us.
we're good... RIVER: They'll never stop.
they'll just keep coming until they get back what you took.
two by two...
...hands of blue.
two by two...
...hands of blue.
how about you shut that crazy mouth? Is that a fun game?
I'm in charge. I'm telling you how it works.
we don't get the goods to Niska, he'll make meat pies out of us.
I ain't walking into that.
is this Adelai Niska you're talking about?
now, how would a shepherd know a name like that?
as I've heard it, he made a deal with the captain.
if the captain's not there to finish it, if Niska finds out he's being held...
...and may speak as to who hired him...
...I think we're better off being a little late.
this is a nightmare. - Nothing points to us yet, sir.
that ain't what I'm talking about.
whatever happens, remember I love you.
sir?
because you're my wife. - Right, sir.
honey.
car three, row twelve. Mr. And Mrs. Raymond?
can you tell us what's going on? We've been here for so long.
did someone on the train get killed? - No, no, no, nothing like that.
says there your fare's paid for by a third party?
my uncle. It was a wedding gift.
wedding gift.
spending your honeymoon in Paradiso? - Actually, we're here looking for work.
that right?
my uncle said he knew a Joey Bloggs out here.
said he might have an opening. Thought we'd try our luck.
you a miner by trade? Either of you?
not really.
haven't seen many folk choose this life weren't born to it.
well, work is real scarce for a couple just starting out.
how come there's so many sick here?
Bowden's Malady.
you know what that is? - An affliction of the bone and muscle.
degenerative. - Very.
every planet that's been terraformed for human life has its own little quirks.
turns out the air down underground mixed up with the ore processors...
...perfect recipe for Bowden's.
everybody gets it.
miners, dumpers.
hell, I got it, and I ain't ever set foot in a mine.
but it's treatable. - There's medicine.
Pescaline.
you can live like a person if you get it regular...
...but our shipment got stole right off the train you was riding in.
which is why you won't be seeing a parade in town today.
stolen?
didn't I see an entire regiment of fine, young Alliance Federals on the train?
you did.
same regiment let their medicine get swiped from under their noses...
...then took off for their own camp without so much as a whoopsy daisy.
that sounds like the Alliance.
unite all the planets so that everybody can be interfered with or ignored equally.
alliance ain't much use to us out here on the border planets.
but...
...they didn't steal the medicine.
I ever find those people, they ain't ever gonna see the inside of a jail.
I'm just gonna toss them in a mine...
...and let them breathe deep for the rest of their lives.
can't argue with that.
you mind telling me when it was you last spoke to Joey Bloggs?
never did myself. - Right. Your uncle.
and it was indicated to you that Joey had an opening?
any job would do.
it's funny your uncle never mentioned the Bowden's problem...
...or that Joey Bloggs ate his own gun about eight months back.
did he?
Yep.
blew the back of his head right off.
so...
...would his job be open?
we waited long enough. Let's get this bird in the air.
no way. - You really should sit down.
we can't leave the captain and Zoe.
they ain't coming. We can't get them. They're done. Fire it up.
what's going on? - We're taking off.
we're not. JAYNE: Captain would do the same.
not in a million years. - Listen to me...
know what the chain of command is?
it's the chain I beat you with till you understand who's in command.
now, we're finishing this deal.
then maybe we'll come back for those morons that got themselves caught.
you can't change that by getting all...
...bendy. - All what?
you got the light from the console...
...to keep you...
lift you up.
Oh, they shine like...
...little angels.
did he just go crazy and fall asleep? - I told him to sit down.
you doped him.
it was supposed to kick in a good deal sooner.
I just didn't feel comfortable with him in charge.
I hope that's all right.
so how do we get the others?
if Jayne was right about them not making contact...
...they got pinched getting off that train.
we can't just waltz in and pull them out.
someone respectable enough might be able to.
what the hell...? - Don't you dare speak to me.
sheriff, I want this man bound by law at once.
that's assuming he hasn't been already. - No one's been bound. Not yet.
thank God you stopped them.
did you think you could access my accounts and I wouldn't find you?
and, Zoe, what would your husband say if he knew you were here?
I was weak.
so I take it they ain't newlyweds. - Hardly.
Malcolm's my indentured man...
...with three years left in his debt.
I imagine we'll have to add another six months after this little adventure.
you'll have to pardon them.
don't think one of them's ever seen a registered companion before.
I apologize for my manner. SHERIFF: Oh, not a bit.
should I contact my ship? Do you need to hold them much longer?
looks to me like we're about done here.
we had some unrelated trouble. His story had kind of an odor to it.
Yes. It's not the only thing about him that does.
thank you very much, sheriff.
come along.
that's a hell of a lady.
her files were all in order? - I read them twice.
all right. Let's get started with the rest then.
Hey. How'd it go? - She hit me.
we tried to get him into the infirmary. He's just heavy.
engine's running. We're good to go. - We're not going.
not what? Not why? - We're bringing the cargo back.
what? What do you mean "back"? I waited for you guys.
what are you talking about? What about Niska?
won't this put him in a killing mood?
others need this more. - Let's get it on the mule.
my shuttle's faster. - You risked enough flying in there once.
I don't want to get slapped around no more.
we'll explain to Niska that the job went south when we return the money.
if you want to explain, now's your chance.
you didn't make the rendezvous.
we ran into a few complications.
you are thinking of taking Mr. Niska's money and his property maybe.
interestingly, neither.
I don't understand. - Yeah, look, here's what it is. Deal's off.
we changed our minds.
you entered into an arrangement with Mr. Niska.
there is no mind-changing. - That's where you're wrong.
we just can't take this job, so you just relax.
we'll get you the money Niska gave us, you return it to him, we'll call it even.
there is no even.
is that right?
nice shot.
I was aiming for his head.
we'll have to drag them from here.
leave them just off the street...
...notify the sheriff once we're in deep, deep space.
why not tell him in person?
got word of a ship not far out.
came looking.
didn't expect to find you coming back.
didn't expect to be coming.
nothing missing.
you were truthful back in town. These are tough times.
a man can get a job...
...he might not look too close at what that job is.
but a man who learns all the details of a situation like ours, well...
...then he has a choice.
I don't believe he does.
let's get these crates back to town.
make ourselves useful.
now, this is all the money Niska gave us in advance.
you bring it back to him, tell him the job didn't work out.
we're not thieves.
but we are thieves. The point is, we're not taking what's his.
we'll stay out of his way as best we can from here on in.
you explain that's best for everyone, okay?
keep the money.
use it to buy a funeral.
it doesn't matter where you go or how far you fly.
I will hunt you down, and the last thing you see will be my blade.
Darn.
this is all the money...
Oh, I got it. I'm good. Best thing for everyone.
I'm right there with you.
you should've let me do this sooner. - I've had plenty worse.
it's just... Ow!
sorry. - Just be careful.
pretty fast thinking, doping up Jayne.
can't say you made a lifetime friend. - I'll deal with him.
Yeah, I'm not too worried about you.
how's your sister?
the same.
in one moment, she seems perfectly cogent. The next...
...she speaks nonsense.
it's like a child.
so difficult to diagnose.
I still don't know what the government was trying to do with her.
so I have no idea if they succeeded.
hands of blue.
two by two...
...hands of blue.
sorry to keep you waiting. There's... - We're not interested.
we're here about a theft.
the medicine on that planet. Word came up that was returned.
we didn't fly 86 million miles to track down a box of Band-Aids, colonel.
we're looking for a girl.
this girl.
enough, enough, yeah, beautiful enough!
be ready!
miss, it's OK! Don'tforget your shoes!
you're trainees! You come here for practice! Hurry up!
from now on, I'm a club girl.
assistant director, my I ask you a question?
how to act like a club girl? What's her background?
a happy one, or...
you're sold to be club girl!
sold? How much the price is? Who sold me?
ask the scriptwriter. Scriptwriter?
ball, where are you going?
I'm going to look for someone!
hurry up...
the studio is overthere! Hurry up!
What're you looking? Don't wander off!
hurry up! The director is losing his temper!
shit! Who is absent?
come on.
wait for me!
get ready! Camera...Action.
sorry!
the director said you're as stupid as a pig!
you know nothing! The script writer told me to act like this!
he said,"You'd know nothing for this is your first performance!"
and, you'd be nervous and confused!
please give me a hand later.
alright! You're not needed, you may leave now.
miss, mind your dress!
I'll never trust you!
I'm only a script writer, how can I read the mind of the director?
so, why did you tell me that? Do you want to fool me?
I couldn't imagine you'd be that serious!
miss, my name is Chun Wei, what's your name?
none of your business!
what a nice name!
you know, you're very special.
you're the first...who asked me about the character's background.
film extra.
creep!
please give way!
Damn...Sister Sen.
sister Sen.
what'll be taken today? Come in and tell me.
my pleasure.
let's talk if there is a chance.
in this scene, it's your first day to work as club girl.
for you want to make money to cure you mom's kidney's disease.
mom! Do you understand?
quiet.
sister Sen...
so bitchy looking! Pay attention when you walk!
get lost.
she is really ridiculous!
forget it! She is cocky indeed.
forget about her! Let's change the costumes of club girls.
how should I act?
is her mom having kidney disease?
miss, you're pretty, and you're so straight forward too.
my name is Pak Kam - lung, you are...
none of your business.
this name matches you so much!
mei - ball...
are you familiar with Sister Sen?
she starred in my first script when I started working in Wong's studio.
she loves listening my interesting stories.
you're good at lowering your head.
you're good at spraying saliva on other's face too!
what's the matter? Why don't you look at me?
are you afraid of loving me?
can you say something not disgusting?
are you escaping from my question?
I just don't like your bad breath!
bad breath?
I don't think so!
is the bad smell coming from your nostrils?
what's up? What?
like it or not?
kid, did Sister Sen make you angry?
so you want to fool me as a release?
like it or not?
No!
luckily you don't, or I don't know what to do.
you know, I'm busy.
cut. It's cut.
so lucky!
it's cut.
Hey, the one in pink dress!
Hey, sexy bomb! Come here.
he is calling you, isn't he?
how about me?
great!
none of your business!
director, this is no good! Why not place her at the back?
but she has a chain of shots.
it's alright!
ridiculous! He called me sexy bomb in public!
that's too much!
my friend loves...
he loves straight forward description.
the film extras should chat with low volume.
scene 4, shot 3, take 1.
chat with low volume!
chat with low volume!
can't you hear your heart beating fast?
it's natural, your heart will beatfaster later!
Why?
it's hard to explain! You'll know itwhen you grow up.
I can't help!
miss, your acting attitude is really serious!
sure, since the director hasn't said cut.
if he didn't cutfor one night, accident'd have happened!
chat with low volume...
low volume! Damn you Fatty!
sister Sen is great! Hurray!
let's eat water melon!
don't be shy! Let's eat.
let's eat first, it's free!
don't eat! It's difficult to digest.
Yeah! Let's not owe her anything!
you're silly! She owed us in her previous life.
so she has to pay us now.
that's right!
Itwastes her money and feeds our stomachs!
Hey, where is your principle?
my principle is to make Lam Sen be bankrupt!
sister Sen.
a piece of water melon can never please me!
I won't care!
are you calling me?
sister Sen, thank you, the water melon is so sweet!
taiwan girl, be careful of belching!
may, can we leave now?
brother Choi.
get changed! It's not hygienic to suck fingers in mouth!
your hair is messy!
I see! A man is behind her!
that's why she is so proud!
sen, we'll go to Lui - yu Restaurant to have breakfast come or not?
have breakfast now? Don't you have to sleep?
Oh shit!
bye bye!
look at you! so poor! You're sweating!
come to see me in my make - up room later.
come to see me later.
are you going to have breakfast?
you are good at acting club girl!
last time, Brother Keith.
before that, Ko Lo - chuen!
and this time, Lo Kim - choi.
be careful of gossip!
just friends only. Gossip? No way! Right!
may, you know, this is a complicated field.
men in this field never tell truth.
I'm not talking about you, sorry.
you trust others easily.
beware of being cheated.
Yes, I know! You talk like my mom!
she values men more than friends! Never copy her.
of course not! I'm not her type.
leaving now? Yes.
a day passed easily.
are these flowers for me?
I picked them up in the props room. I intended to take it home.
in fact, I like roses much.
Why?
it's of numerous colors! Yellow!
but not orange color. I love orange most.
and purple! Say pink...
in fact, this is for you.
thank you. You're welcome.
mei - ball, we may leave when you get changed.
he said has uncle is a tailor, he'll give us a discount.
is that true?
Yeah! Today is the Mid - autumn Festival, it's a romantic day, we may go to have tea after the measurement.
no, just take us to the hostel.
up to you.
but there are only 2 seats in my car.
if you don't mind, take my friend's car.
his car is bigger and more comfortable.
no, thanks! I'll take your friend's car
I like bigger car.
chat with low volume...
36 inches.
Really?
I'm sure.
mister, can you make it cheaper?
it's really cheap.
such limited cloth is used, you may make it cheaper.
I guess it must be a wrong measurement.
just kidding, little girl.
since so limited cloth is used, let me send you this dress as gift.
no, we're not relatives, I don't want to waste your money.
let's share the money for this dress.
OK.
but I have a great doubt.
two different measurements, how can you share the dress?
it's OK.
well, which measurement should be followed?
take her measurement, tight dress is good looking.
No! Take your measurement.
if she thinks it's too loose, stuff it with cotton. She'll feel warm in winter and cool in summer.
you're so bad!
why do you always pick on me?
I want to draw your attention.
what did he say?
he said you are pretty.
the piece of cloth is pretty.
sure, it brings rosy cheeks.
so red! It'll be suitable be wedding gown.
well, whoever marries first, who'll wear it as wedding gown!
if we get married on the same day, how to share this dress then?
it won't be that coincident, will it?
if so, I'll let you get married first.
whenever I see you writing letter to your cousin, you always think a lot!
do you have that many love words to write?
I have written everything!
I even told him my nose bled few days ago!
you can tell him that you've known a new friend today.
who do you mean?
Chun Wei!
I always feel that I can learn a lot from him.
he'll teach you nasty things too.
of course not!
think! People said handsome guys are always heartless.
he is so ugly, he must be kind - hearted.
is he ugly?
Yes, very ugly.
you just love dreaming! Go on dreaming!
this is not dreaming!
Lulu...
have a tea first!
did Lo Kim - choi beat you? Did he beat you?
no, we went to Lu - yu to have breakfast.
some buns were remained, he suggested to eat them at home with me.
while we were eating, he invited me to a trip.
he is so bold!
don't go! Yeah!
or, he'll take your advantage! Don't go!
but I promised to go with him.
what's next?
he said he'd ask boss to let me star in his next movie.
so I...I couldn't control myself...
so...what's next? Go on.
his wife suddenly returned.
his wife?
he is married...
Yeah.
wait! You two were eating buns only.
why did his wife beat you?
she beat her husband too.
he deserves it.
she said the bun I was eating dirtied her bed.
you were eating buns in bed?
I got dressed at once!
you got dressed?
wait! Didn't you wear anything in bed?
before undressing, I did wear something...
he flattered me...
am I cheap?
No! You're not cheap!
I know I'm really cheap!
have you scolded yourself enough? You blamed yourself cheap.
we're your good friends, so, are we cheap too?
I know I'm not talented in acting, and I'm not as smart as you.
I'm not as worldly wise as Lulu.
I just want someone to take care of me earn much and enjoy my life.
who said you're not talented?
smart guy is always fooled by himself.
it's no big deal to be a man of the world.
you'll wait and see. Just try your best and act.
maybe, you'll get famous before us.
if you get famous, don't forget Ball and me.
don't cry.
sister Sen is having a party in boss's room.
when will we get as famous as her?
no more vanity!
I want to eat moon cake.
guess how much is Sister Sen's dress!
higher...
great... Thank you...
get someone to help! Get the first aid box.
hurry up...
turn...
your chance is coming.
we'll make a new movie which will be starred by a new star.
read the script!
the scene which Tsui told Madam that she was raped by her husband.
a screen test will be held tomorrow.
tears in eyes! So we have to cry in the screen test.
shit! Can you cry easily?
it's a piece of cake!
just think some unhappy things.
give me an example.
Say...you'll never get famous in this life!
can I think something else?
sure! Think your husband is being kidnapped.
his ear is cut and mailed to you.
when you pay the money, you discover he is the man behind.
may Chu.
it's OK.
step aside.
good morning, director.
sister Sen!
she is so nice to help us choose the leading lady!

madam, Master he...
she acted quite well.
I think she's experienced that.

why did they faint one after another?
Lulu Shum. Yes.
my God...it's my turn!
No! Everything will be lucky!
breathe in, act naturally
smile more, got it?
the acne!
I have more than you! I've got an idea.
it's much more pretty! Smile more!
you're the most beautiful one.
madam, Madam... Tsui, what's the matter?
master came to my room last night.
he drank a lot, he hugged me right after seeing me.
so I bit him, bit him...
then, he pushed me on the floor.
Oh! He looked at me! I was scared and I struggled.
he touched me, my face then my hands and legs.
he kept on touching, at last he tore my dress.
I cried "No"! He said,"Don't be afraid!"
I felt pain...painful!
master raped me! Finished.
who's next?
mei - ball.
mei - ball!
we're searching you.
Oh, you need herbal oil to make you cry?
damn you script writer! You wrote "with tears in eyes"!
don't you think it's easy to cry?
why don't you cry in front of me?
be frank, when I wrote it, I cried terribly.
I don't have holes for tears! See?
right! Not even dirt!
let me try to stab two holes with needles for you.
can you make it?
are you kidding? You believe it?
you needn't cry, maybe the tears are dried out already.
you can be sad with no tears.
madam, Master...
went to my room last night.
he held me...
I pushed him away!
but he...he was really drunk.
I didn't mean it...
I didn't mean it! I promise it'll never happen again.
don't ask me to leave, madam,
don't kick me out?
I don't knowwhere to go!
madam! I beg you...
madam! Please don't ask me to leave.
No! Don't! Don't ask me to leave.
please! I beg you Madam. I beg you.
what's the name of the girl who fell again and again?
well, she is Lulu Shum.
make her the leading Lady. Kidding?
are you kidding? A blind man can tell Mei - ball acts better.
that Lulu Shum...
tsui was raped by Master.
if you choose, which girl will you rape?
I won't do so.
well, which one would you like to screw?
personally, I appreciate the special character of Mei - ball.
a girl to screw.
mei - ball.
how aboutthe rest?
Lulu Shum...
if I choose, both are not OK.
the film is made for the public.
minority should listen to majority.
fix the script and start filming.
if you insist using Lulu Shum, I'll quit.
are you crazy?
Chun Wei, Lulu Shum will be a star, let's bet.
how?
the loser should hold the shoes of the winner.
tsui, I'm back.
brother Ox, I miss you!
Hey, isn't it weird to hang a shoe like this?
for I'm a loser! Your shoe stinks so much!
I suggest you to cut yourfeet!
you'll get famous! Thank you!
Hey, you're shot.
where am I?
the 3rd one from the left. Yeah!
it's so short!
master, what's the matter with you?
No!
master, let me go...
what do you think about my acting?
if I said you're not a good actress.
will you quit and get married with someone at once?
I don't understand why I am always acting passenger A, beggar C?
I haven't acted any character with a name!
you're suitable to act as beggar.
ifyou really want to marry someone, we're friends, can you give me priority?
except poorer and a bit ugly...
basically, I don't have any demerits.
but you're fat.
do you know your own problem?
you're lacking of self-confidence.
like me...
well, I'm a bit care free, and a bit wild, but you can change me!
if you're changed, you're no longer yourself.
if I changed, I'm no longer myself.
I am more and more fond of you.
don't like me because you're pitying me.
it's not the matter of pity.
I really like you.
actually, a man and a woman can be friends.
all starting from friendship.
this is my heart.
you make me sick! Mr. Wild!
this way...
this is for you. Thank you.
let's go this way. Great!
your answer is really interesting.
dear Ball and Lulu.
this is a picture taken outside a little church...
in the USA on the wedding day of Kent and me.
this is a nice place to settle down.
miss Lulu, our super star, wish you earn more money get rich and famous.
sister Ball, try hard, you'll be successful.
I miss the preserved plums sold in Yiu-fung.
can you mail 5 catties to me? 5 catties? So greedy is May!
she is pretty!
see, Kent is like Leung Sing - bor.
sister Lulu, about your acting last night, you acted so lovely!
you'll be the Best Actress this year!
cuff and go up!
the director is getting mad now.
before sending you back to hostel
let's go to Shatin for tea.
it's not the same road.
isn't it the same road to my home?
director, everything is ready.
get ready.
roll.
"cleopatra," scene eight, shot 2, take 1.
action.
come here.
give me the Lantern.
I'll beat you although you're the princess.
I'll never tell a word.
great! I'll teach you a lesson then.
is it OK?
well, I'll beat you to death!
I'm not telling a word! Cut.
beat her hardly! Take her as you foe, you fool.
but I'm new.
well, let me demonstrate once.
understand?
it's really simple to act, just be a bit emotional.
so, do you understand?
well, you're telling me that I'm not good at acting!
director, let me introduce my friend to act this role.
she's hardworking, obedient and is good at acting.
if she is good at acting, she may make you less attractive.
don't worry, if you take my suggestion we'll finish it faster.
I'll consider it.
mei - ball, come and help!
director, we can start anytime,
get ready.
from now on, we are foes.
action.
I'll teach you a lesson, now.
I'll beat you although you are the princess.
how dare you!
good acting!
get someone to help Lulu. Set the machines here.
are you alright?
congratulations, Lulu, you're understood at last.
this was a good slap!
thank you, Ball.
you're welcome! She is tired, help her to take a rest.
refine the makeup
thank you.
what a fantastic, experienced actress!
director, may I ask the ending of the maid?
dies with no regret or goes straight?
what a professional attitude!
I've read a book it's said, an actor must study his character, feel deeply...
keep on studying the character.
the deepest side you feel...
so he can act the best!
director, I'll feel it myself at home.
keep on studying...
study here and there...
forget yourself and express the character's feeling!
thus, you may have best performance.
I'm giving you advice, girl!
get rid of your dirty hand!
how about morale of an actor?
she can never succeed!
what are you guys doing? How is the set up?
sister Sen.
you're really nice! You've always been so serious!
Really?
I always said you can offend anyone when you're famous.
sail when the wind blows!
you're really great!
you offend others while you're nobody!
if keep on like this, you'll get famous once you're not dying young.
I don't know your meaning.
but I'm not interested in being indecent assaulted.
if a man touches you, it means you're quite attractive.
you know boot - licking?
just to be happy going!
don't care so much! Then life will be easy.
why are you so serious?
too many people are talented in this field.
famous or not, it depends on whether you catch the chance or not.
now, remedy is not late.
director, I'm free tonight.
get changed first.
getting wise.
director.
stop talking, come to my home for a screen test tonight.
what is hidden at your back?
an axe.
what for?
to kill you!
what book did you mention?
remember my name! My name is Mei - ball.
thank you.
boss, please give Ball another chance.
I've given her a choice!
freeze for one year or apologize.
she chose an early termination of her contract.
has Ball returned yet?
she's just packed up and left.
she left you a letter.
I saw my first movie at six.
the movie was starred by MaryWong.
I told myself,
I wanted to be MaryWong ll.
I chose to be actress.
but I know now, this field didn't choose me.
I know my character doesn't fit to be an actress.
and I don't want to change myself or please others.
what a big world! I can try something else.
the onlything I'm proud of...
I still have a bit selfesteem.
I'm carrying halfcase ofclothing & halfcase ofselfesteem...
to visit my cousin in Borneo, maybe I'll marry him.
I think I should have a new start.
Lulu, I'll write you letters when I reach there.
wish you luck and happy, Ball.
it won't be him, will it?
Freeze!
police, don't go!
where do you want to go?
I know the answer.
you miss here so much, so you want to have a look.
Yeah...bye bye.
marry me, will you? I miss you!
stay clam. I'm calm! I'm calm.
let me go! Hands off!
let's elope!
you haven't seen each other for 4 years.
your cousin said he'd wait for you, don't trust man!
at least, he always writes me letter to ask me to marry him.
every men will do it too.
is he as handsome as me?
no. That's right.
he has a stable job, with stable income.
is he a street sweeper?
he is a JP in Borneo.
I tell you, many people will have digestive disease in that place.
many tropical diseases will be spread.
when you die, you'll lose control of urination!
you like acting so much!
you're born to be an actress!
you'd go with the men of this field.
you won't be suitable to be the wife of a JP.
think if you become a rich lady.
play mahjong, and yell at your maids.
to make soup for your husband.
bear babies, feed babies, change diapers for babies.
and you have to sparetime to stop your husband fooling around.
these are not your style of living.
admit it! Marry me.
I appreciate it so much!
be frank! I admire your speech so much.
thank you for letting me feel my attraction.
how about decide it by a coin?
head, marry your cousin.
tail, stay and marry me.
how can one decide one's life by a coin?
sometimes, a coin can help you to make decision.
ready.
please lend itto me for bus fee.
both sides are tails.
so, you always win.
will it be a wrongly made coin? If yes, it worths much.
I really want to ask.
can you separate life from acting?
for acting, you can have NGs.
for life, you cant' try again.
I'll write a scriptto memorize you.
I've read twice, it's nice.
it's my best script.
how is it?
"missing you" sounds a bit artistic.
I appreciate that you don't have any wrong spellings.
what an exclamated exclamation mark!
don't you think I'm green in this field?
the man decides his life by a coin.
it sounds a bit ridiculous.
insane.
the leading lady isn't lovely.
you don't know love and you don't know directing film.
you'd better go home.
you'd return the editing tool to me first.
say something good about my film...
it's really great! You'll get the Oscar award.
sham!
you'd better think over.
brother, have you eaten yet?
sham!
sham! You'd better stay here.
you must be having fever! Your brain is burnt!
you said I took your advantage?
why don't you look at yourself?
you walk like a bad egg!
you bitch! You took my advantage!
have some coffee.
I haven't finished. Do you want to interrupt?
brother Choi, give me some face.
you?
why should I?
brother Choi, better stay peace!
your lips bring you too many troubles, you know?
beat him.
stay calm.
you want to be hero?
it really hurts.
stop playing!
we're in a hurry, let's stop here.
I hate others messing my script.
do you have asthma?
your script is really touching, so I cry.
Really?
if I were the leading lady,
I would have married him.
is the man lovely? Yes.
you have good taste.
will you take part in this film? I wish to be the leading lady.
I'm sorry to make you cry like this.
what a rare kind!
you're really gentle to wipe mytears.
and you saved me without hesitation.
I'd pay for it.
no. I have to.
you need not. I must!
if you want to, pay with your body.
you're tall.
you are not only good as writing script?
Yes.
why not move in and live with me?
Why?
I want to see you everyday! For I'm your woman now.
are you that serious?
you're so bad!
I have to tell you one thing.
I like you.
but I don't like you as much as you like me.
do you want to measure it with weight?
I like you, that's it.
I'm not used to stay in Borneo, any room for me to stay?
your breast!
why do you come back suddenly?
there are lots of mosquitoes in Borneo, I'm scared!
my cousin asked me to have a baby with him.
so I was scared and left at once.
I think, I will to be and old virgin!
but I've discovered that I like acting more.
do you agree?
I think boss isn't angry now,
I'll ask him to sign contract with you again.
hubby! Stop playing! Look who's come?
Oh! Hi! Welcome home!
you haven't seen each otherfor 4 years, maybe he's having another woman now!
he writes to me every 2 weeks, and urges me to marry him.
borneo is so hot, with so many mosquitoes.
many people died because of digestive disease.
a rich lady's life won't fit you.
you're born to be actress.
and you'd marry me.
I don't understand what's bothering you.
well, give both of us a chance.
let's decide it by a coin.
you'll take tail, OK?
I want head.
you lost.
see, both sides are tails.
marry me, Yuen Kwan.
brother Kim - hung, I'll never leave you.
I...I love you,
we wish we'd stay together forever.
don't you have any tear holes?
Yes.
you are crying.
I'm not.
our love will last forever.
isn't it nice?
there is bomb! Let's go and see!
don't block myway...
sir, we don't know whether it's real or not.
take me a gun, I'll start its explosion.
great!
I think, most important of all is to amend...
the par twhich Leung San - pak...
thought he was fond of a man.
it's alright.
boss asked you to make such film, for he thinks it's worth.
everyone wants an unforgettable and ever lasting romance.
what do you think?
how is it?
not bad.
the script...
it's OK, I'm used to drink coffee, it doesn't mind.
master, are you deaf?
master...
can we start our discussion?
good.
deaf?
so a deaf can't be a director.
Chun Wei, you'll do it.
what?
be an executive director.
earn some money of Pak Yeung.
he's a problem now, you'd help of course!
I'm not interested in such heavy job.
and I don't want you to lose money.
unless you'll let Mei - ball be the leading lady.
I want Lulu and Wong Siu - yu star the film.
Lulu again? Are you tired of it?
Yes, but she is needed in foreign markets.
for the side characters remained, you'll make the decisions.
beggar, we're looking for you.
I'm waiting for filming. Come on.
I'm not doing it. No? Do you want to cheat me?
too limited appearance! I'm not doing it.
you'll act as Siu - yuk, the maid of the leading lady!
you'll appear in every scene. And you'll have a name.
I don't want to be a maid, just like my practical life.
a maid is a decent job.
2 choices for you, be a maid or elope with me.
thank you.
I don't want to see you and Lulu hug of kiss in the studio.
well, I won't do that, OK?
is the character of maid still available?
it's cut.
but I'll add it a once.
isn't the script going smooth?
Yes.
in fact, I don't know what I'm writing.
I can't concentrate.
I think you'll fell better now.
come on, Leung San - pak.
seems like an Indian.
let's Try.
another page. Thank you.
what's this?
love.
no way.
Why?
anyway, no way!
why not?
let's elope.
I'm going to sleep first. Let me cover the blanket for you.
it's so slight, is the script long enough? Director.
there are many amendments.
the script is too poor, my acting can't help much.
let's discuss it, I don't mind.
I think, Leung shouldn't die young.
why not add some action scenes?
say, he's saved by MasterYet - dong.
and he is taught a sword play.
ma Man - choi kidnapped Chuk Ying-toi.
so Leung went to save her, a big fight started.
kill and fight...
even intestines burst out! Then stuff in.
burst out...
great! That's gimmick!
it's easy to be written.
what do you think?
what's next?
if I act as Leung, so handsome looking!
Siu - yuk must admire me.
I think better create an affair between us.
say, Siu - yuk sucked the poisonousjuice from mywound.
Suck...thus passion created!
so, it'll be attractive.
but Leung has no reason to like Siu - yuk.
men won't reject women.
it's deal!
a man with 2 wives! Happy ending.
isn't it creative?
Yes, it is.
but, this is a story of never changing love.
leung has no reason to love Siu - yuk.
this is a Chinese version of Romeo and Juliet.
have you heard of it?
sure I have.
but you are not Shakespeare!
this is an insult.
I'm thinking for the benefit of the film.
if yes, you shouldn't have nagged.
you know nothing! This script is so lousy!
I'm starring it, I have my right to amend the script.
I'm starring it too, I have my right to stop amending it.
what leading lady you are?
your creations are nonsense!
what do you mean by stuffing the intestines?
don't you understand? Should I show you now?
tell him.
how can I tell him? I'm no match for him in fighting.
can I ask him notto act?
the role is decided by the boss.
you always said others raping your script.
are you going to rape yourself this time?
thank you for granting me time to let me rape myself.
but most important is, which side is going to tolerate each other?
I won't tolerate you, will you tolerate me?
so what?
if not, let's say bye bye.
do it, or leave it.
who is he talking to?
he said,"Do it, or leave it."
don't stay here, no one wants your autograph.
What're you looking? Like an idiot!
master.
I appreciate and respect your character.
but you make me lose face!
I'm leaving now.
why do you read newspaper?
a hero for a minute made me find another newjob.
wei, boss is looking ofyou, he spoke foul language.
you're great! You've driven the main character away before shooting!
boss, look this way.
I suggest you to act as Leung San - pak.
stop fooling, be a bit mature please.
how old are you now?
I've forgotten.
let me tell you, you are 32 now.
when I was years old, I operated a film making co. in Shanghai.
lots of fellows are under me.
boss, a good news and a bad news.
wong Siu - yu gottraffic accident and he broke his arm.
this is good news.
the bad news is, you need to find another leading cast for the film.
I have a good suggestion, she can make it, be a drag!
what's the matter?
I heard that this film was designed for Wong Siu - yu.
now he is busy at making another film.
what film?
what is name of the film?
where is the studio?
"king of Sword with Single Arm," now it's shooting back there.
welcome our Best Actress of this year, Miss Mei - ball!
I love you, send me something!
director Chun, what's the content of your new film?
just ordinary topics, boys like girls, girls like boys.
then they love another and some action scenes will be added.
we would like Miss Lulu Shum to sing for us.
no way. Again, Miss Lulu.
I am not prepared. Miss Lulu.
don't be shy, I will back you up, don't panic.
director, may I invite your girlfriend for a while?
pretty woman is going to sing, please give way.
I don't know how to sing.
sister Ball is here.
sister Ball, glad to see you, or we don't know how to explain.
you are giving me face.
you are so humorous. Of course.
I don't know singing.
the Best Actress is putting on an air, she is late.
take pictures first.
are you going to write it? It's just kidding.
sister Lulu, dance with Ball, and let us take pictures.
I can't for I have a pain on foot.
shit, Lulu must have read the gossip magazine of this issue.
what's it about?
someone wrote that we are having an affair.
there must be something trustable behind all gossips.
don't scare me, I have bright future.
many young men and young girls are crazy for me.
I won't give up my future for a man who has such ugly hair style.
I will cut it.
may we go now?
you'd better go home to sleep.
I have many things to think at home, I can't sleep.
what are you going to think?
think whether I should open a company with others or not.
if I promise, they will invite Lui Kei or Tse Yun to be my partner.
how about Mei - ball?
in this world, no everlasting co - operation, you know?
have you ever fallen for her?
such childish question! I will only answer once.
I have never fallen for Pak Shui - sen.
do you have to be that tough?
I mean Mei - ball.
she! She...
I like her, I like her so much.
be serious OK?
there is a cockroach climbing down from your hair.
there are total three cockroaches.
I will read your diary.
I haven't written any diary, please close the door, thank you.
your hair style is so ugly.
why doesn't it burn?
burning your diary?
I know what you are going to say.
it will be childish.
but I thick this is a reason too.
I knew her first.
have you experienced sleepless night?
and think some weird things?
say, when president Kennedy was assassinated.
the bullet in his head could turn.
did the bullet turn in his head, or, it's the conspiracy of the Mafia ofthe CIA?
and the Vietnam war.
how many bullets and tissue papers are used per day?
what does that mean?
I mean...
in this world, there are many things worth thinking.
when was it started?
don't tease me.
in fact, we haven't started yet.
does she know it?
Yes, if I say no, I was cheating you.
I have a morning shit tomorrow, I want an early sleep.
or, I won't be pretty.
you'd better go to bed earlier too.
sister Ball, the next scene is nothing special.
their love and passion have reached the boiling point.
you eyesight is enough.
but the director said, you'd better read the script.
good morning.
it's too late.
want plum?
it stinks, let's go overthere.
I do think so.
Lulu, you just need to pour the water to Ball angrily.
holding the glass with which hand?
pour her angrily or be angry after pouring her?
ask the director for me please.
director... Why holding the glass? Shoot now.
roll camera, action!
did you cheat me?
of course not, I swear.
cut!
tell her.
sister Lulu, pour her with water.
no, you asked me to slap her face.
no, pour water on her.
not slapping her?
did I do that wrongly?
never mind, again, she made a mistake only.
action.
I love you, I swear, I love you.
the water is too hot! She will get hurt!
I haven't heard the director say cut.
cut.
Lulu.
I am sorry.
sister Lulu.
let's change the script, you may pour the water to him.
and you may slap him if your mood fits.
what do you mean? Ask the director for me.
director, Lulu asked what is meant by mood fits?
tell her, she will understand it.
the director said you will understand it.
tell him that I am not.
director, Sister Lulu said she doesn't understand...
what do you mean?
I told you to pass my words, you couldn't even make it.
we have waited for half day, not any shot is finished.
just know doing some tricks.
what did you say? Look at your damn face!
let's call it a day. I am not shooting any more.
I haven't made any mistake.
don't cry, you are so ugly.
don't cry.
don't let me involve in the quarrel between you and your better half.
you will experience it when you have a chance to be the director.
go home and take a bath.
Lulu, do you misunderstand something?
do you trust those reporters?
what's the matter?
I am stupid, I am too stupid to take you as my best friend.
I am so stupid to trust you.
I always treat you as my best friend.
so, you should have told me that,
Chun Wei loves you.
and I was so stupid to court him.
I have been fool for so many years!
now, I know, I am the one who is obstructing you two.
you always hide up your feelings, and you never tell me anything.
to your mind, isn't this the right wayto treat your friend like this?
what do you want me to say?
do you want me to ask you not to fight with me?
or, ask you to take him with ease, and forget my presence?
miss Chu is looking for you.
hold it.
kidding?
you are rich and you have such poor TV set at home?
you have to change your TV, super star.
Hey, anyone wants to play mahjong?
may?
ball, they are waiting for you.
you and Ball are heartless.
why haven't you come to visit me for ages?
you deserve it, now, you are not bothering me.
you are famous now, so you don't bother me at all.
what's up? Do you want to come out?
stop moving, or I won't give birth to you.

smart guy.
alright, everyone is present, present time.

but you always like the same thing.
lady who wants to fall in love...
it's awful! Let me play and you sing. Alright.
lady who wants to fall in love...
so what?
what is the feeling of being other's wife and mom?
lucky.
I haven't heard of that for ages.
how about you? What's your plan?
men?
I am tired of wearing this.
I want to be woman.
come here, kids.
longing to see you, BrotherWei.
are you Cousin JP?
you are smart!
not many people can guess correctly!
it's hard to guess!
BrotherWei, My cousin said you are the greatest script writer.
in fact, I am interested in making films.
I have a very good story.
if you direct the film, it will be the best film in S. E. Asia.
what's the story about?
the legend of JP.
cousin, your friend is great in viewing film.
see! He likes it.
of course.
the story will be my legend.
when I was nine. I went to Bonero to be hard labor.
I knew no one there, once I met a fire in the jungle.
it was smoky! A tiger jumped to me.
luckily an elephant came out suddenly.
it stepped the tiger to death.
my wealth started from selling the fur of the tiger.
and I used its penis to make wine.
cousin JP.
it's hard to understand such precious history.
cousin, you told me he is as close as your family.
his native place differs yours.
we are just colleagues, not family.
BrotherWei, It hurts my cousin.
if you are not our family, my cousin needn't tell you first...
wait.
BrotherWei, in fact...
stop talking.
BrotherWei, in fact...
I told you to shut up.
he isn't our family, why should we inform him our wedding?
my friends are coming.
cousin, come with me.
I will introduce some reporters to you.
alright.
may I introduce to you, my fiance, that's my cousin too.
he is a JP in Bonero.
when will you get married?
three months later.
where will be your wedding party?
Congratulations.
you just marry someone so as to leave me.
thank you.
you're so stupid.
welcome...
Lulu is coming.
Lulu, tell you a good news.
my cousin has found me, we are going to get married.
Congratulations.
director, does Ball's marriage affect you?
let me introduce my cousin to you.
this is my cousin, this is Lulu.
director, what do you think about marriage?
I think marriage is holy.
I object someone to use it to reach his goal.
this is too childish, and it ruins the system of marriage.
what does that mean?
I mean...
Lulu, I love you!
if you have time,
I want to propose to you.
would you marry me?
why your words are always disgusting?
that's good, marry me, so you can take revenge for that.
Lulu.
I changed my hair style.
I really want to hate you.
Congratulations.
Mr. JP, want it?
no, I can hold it.
let's toast to the brides.
Cheers.
take it back. Thank you.
Congratulations! You will get married soon.
thank you.

San - pak, we have to say good bye at last.
Ying-toi, it's still early, let me walk with you for a while.

that boy hangin' by a thread, Over the pit,
fiery pit! "Left My Wallet in El Segundo,
Ooh!
67 years of life, 46 years of marriage,
you mean to tell me you never once suffered from piles?
well, it's the human condition,
most humans, anyhow,
like that ballplayer said, "The world's got two kind of folks,
them that's got the piles and them that's goin' get 'em,"
but you always was healthy as a ox,
passed on 'fore you could get the piles, Mm-hm,
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick,
I just want to pass away nice and peaceful,
go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land! Whoo!
pickles!
go fetch Pickles! - Pickles?
Oh, he's up that tree again! You'd better shimmy on up,
well, I do apologize, madam, but, won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative?
uh, the point being, must we actually ascend the tree?
look, I don't want no doubletalk,
now, if you not gon' fetch him, I guess I gotta call the police, - Police? - And they not goin' be happy,
every time they have to fetch him, they swear they'll never do it no more,
no need to call the authorities, madam,
I did this often as a child,
I was a positive lemur, Here, kitty!
Oh, don't upset him now! - I wouldn't think of it, madam,
harmless little Felix domesticus,
here, Kitty, Come to here，
come, come, Here, kitty, Here, kitty,
come, come, come, No, no, no,
that's not how Sheriff Wyner do it,
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Come, come, come,
come to the professor,
Yes, Yes, Ah!
uh, thank you, madam, for your act of kindness, - Well, you let him out, - I certainly did, and for that I apologize no end,
allow me to present myself, um, formally,
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph, D,
like Elmer?
I beg your pardon, ma'am? - Fudd,
no, no, Ph, D, is a mark of academic attainment bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek,
I also hold a number of other advanced degrees, including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne,
sore bone, Well, that fits,
you ever study at Bob Jones University?
I have not had that privilege,
Oh, that's a Bible school, Only the finest in the country, - I send 'em $5 every month, - That is very generous, - I'm on the mailin' list! I'm a Angel, - Are you? Yes,
Oh, they list my name in the newsletter every issue, - Do they? - Oh, I got the literature right over here, - if you'd like to examine it, - Perhaps when my head has recovered from its, uh, uh, buffeting,
Mrs Munson, are you at all curious as to why I darkened your door, as the expression would have it, on this lovely, lovely camellia-scented morn?
well, I was wonderin' till you let Pickles out, - I quite understand, - Then in all the excitement,
the fact is, I saw the sign in your window advertising a room to let?
and there are no other such signs among the houses - on this charming, charming street, - Yeah, I got a room, $1 5 a week, I'm lookin' for a quiet tenant,
madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet, If I may offer a riddle,
I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach, the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg,
I am takin' a year off to indulge my passion, and I do not believe that is too strong a word, - for the music of the Renaissance, - Mm-hm,
I perform in, and have the honor of directing, a period-instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance Fairs and other cultural fora throughout central and southern Mississippi,
we perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed,
now, wait a minute, You got some kind of band?
Oh, no, The word "band" would be, in this context, something of a misnomer,
though we do play together, hence the word "ensemble," the nature of the music is such that, well, one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band."
with connotations of janglin' rhythms, - So y'all ain't playin' no hippity-hop?
l Left My Wallet in El Segundo," Songs with the titles spelled all funny?
Oh, no, no, We play music that has been composed to the greater glory of God,
devotional music, Church music,
gospel music?
well, inspired by the gospel, certainly,
the vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo,
Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be OK,
but I don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you,
may I inquire, do you have a root cellar?
Ah... Yes.
Yes, yes,
this looks promising,
a little dank, ain't it?
indeed, That only improves the acoustics,
marvelous,
Yes, Ah!
Oh, these earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute or sackbut,
that is why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs, This is ideal, This is perfect, This is more than perfect, - I can scarcely contain my glee, - Oh, you containin' it OK,
you gotta peel this shit out, man, Sometimes it stick to the bottom,
Hey, this shit smells like piles,
you wouldn't even believe this, man, Even out here on the casino floor you gonna find goddamn mercy pads, Tucks,
I don't know what the fuck people be doin' here while they gamblin',
man, I ain't peelin' no funky shit with my human hands,
that ain't nothin' but a prescription for diseases and viruses - and shit attackin' your fuckin' insides, - Oh, well, shit, you gotta do it, 'cause Mr, Gudge checks everything,
this tunnel leads back onto the land for all the people that work for Mannex,
Mannex Corporation, They own the Bandit Queen, three other boats,
now, this is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them,
I mean, the light's as ugly as all hell, but, shit, ain't as many Tucks, - Let me in, motherfucker! - What's the password?

now, the animal is free to be as active as he wants,
it doesn't inhibit his movement in any way, and , l think it really sells the whole doughboy thing, - It looks like a fucking joke, - Uh, you're absolutely right,
the gas mask is a whimsical concept,
how the hell does it eat when it gets to the Nibbles Ready-to-Eat?

I know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain carrying the Word of God, come down that Sinai peak, - he caught them lsraelites red-handed, - Yes!
What'd he catch 'em doin'?
he caught 'em worshippin'
a golden calf, - Yes!
he caught 'em worshippin'
a false god,
he caught them lsraelites in decline,
in decline!
what did Moses do when he saw those, declinin', backslidin', never-mindin' sinners?
what did he do?
mosses smote those sinners in his wrath! Yes, he did!
y'all know what "smote" is?
I smite, you smite, he smites, we done smote!
to smite is to go upside the head!
because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that's the only way!
the only way,
to smite is to remind we got to stop that decline and scramble back up to the face of the Almighty God!
Amen! - lnstead of worshippin'
that golden calf, that earthly trash on that garbage island,
that garbage island in the shadowland, wa-a-ay, way outside the Kingdom of God!
that garbage island, where scavenger birds feast on the bones of the backslidin' damned!
and so, let us pray,
my dear lady, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice,
somebody die?
I beg your pardon? Oh!
no, no, no, No, I'm not bereaved,
though it is so kind of you to inquire, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all the members of our ensemble,
and, of course, our instruments contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization,
allow me to introduce my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians,
ain't no smokin' in this house
Oh, Sorry,
what do you think, General? Present any problems?
good then, Gentlemen, why don't we crowd around and go over the plan?
gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen, Gambling den, Cash cow,
sodom of the Mississippi Delta and the focus of our little exercise,
here is Orchard Street,
here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom you all met moments ago,
gentlemen, I'm sure you're all aware that the Solons of the state of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land,
they may, however, legally float,
while the gambling activity is restricted to these riverboats, no such restrictions apply to the functions ancillary to this cash-besotted business,
the casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and, most importantly, its counting houses, the reinforced, secret, super-secure repositories of the lucre, may all be situated, wherever, - Gawain, where is "wherever"? - Say what?
Where's the money? - Oh,
OK, look, At the end of every shift, pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox, and once a day all the cash is moved down to the countin' room,
and where isthe counting room
uh, it be right there in that square where you pointin',
and what, to flog a horse that if not dead is at this point in mortal danger of expiring, does this little square represent?
offices, Underground,
ha! Underground! Mmm!
underground,
during the casino's hours of operation, the door to this counting room is fiercely guarded,
the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel,
when the casino closes this entire underground complex is locked up, and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance,
there, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, But the walls, the walls are but humble masonry behind which is only the soft, loamy soil deposited over centuries by the Old Man, the meanderin' Mississippi, as it fanned its way back and forth across the great alluvial plain, leaving earth,
this earth,
the General here, whose curriculum vitae comprehends massive tunnelin' experience through the soil of his native French lndochina, shall be directin' our little old tunnelin' operation,
Garth Pancake, though a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim,
he will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work - as our little caper shall require, - Happy to be on board,
gawain is our proverbial "inside man,"
he has managed to secure himself a berth on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen, - Damn skippy! - And this brings us to Lump,
to look at Lump, you might wonder what specialized expertise could he possibly offer our merry little old band of miscreants,
well, gentlemen, in a project of such risks, it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute,
someone who will be our security, our battering ram, our blunt instrument,
and, on our behalf, I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome, - Fuckin' A, - What's up, my nigga?
well, gentlemen, here you are,
men of different backgrounds and differing talents,
men with, in fact, but two things in common:
one, you all saw fit to answer my advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and two, you're all going to be, in consequence, very, very, incredibly, rich,
let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen,
let us make beautiful music together, and, by all means, let us keep this to ourselves,
what we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar,
there's no "l" in "team,"
trouble in and trouble out
trouble's what this world's about
troubles of this world the Devil's in this world
trouble in, trouble out
trouble's what this world's about
troubles of this world the Devil's in this world
you up the river without a paddle in a lot of trouble
without a doubt you going under running out of bubbles
pass me the body bag watch me dump 'em
it ain 't nothing for you to get squashed like a pumpkin
I try so hard and play my cards afraid to fall, I ain 't involved
I gotta call I'm much appalled
I came to OZ and broke the laws
bring on the casket ain 't too glad 'Cause dirty hazard wrapped in plastic
it's OK, don't stop on account of me,
no, No, no, no, no, Not at all, madam,
not at all, we were about to take a break anyway,
the glissandi on this particular piece are technically very, very demanding, and I'm sure we would all welcome a moment of R and R,
well, I just thought maybe you'd like to see,
what have you gotten into, honey? Why you sweatin' like that?
uh, Uh,
uh, eh, 'cause, 'cause, That boy right there?
he plays one bitch barrel full of a sackbut!
ain't that right, Lump? - Uh-huh,
I'm tellin' you, he can tear it up, Right, Lump?
ain't nobody play the sackbut like Lump right there, He,
don't be shy, Lump, Don't be shy, Lump, that boy, he go, at it like it was some pussy!
Oh, shit! - Mind your mouth!
this is a Christian house, boy, No hippity-hop language in here, - Sometime it's the only way, - Now listen, you ain't gonna hit me,
I'm tryin' to help you, boy, better yourself!
and so you should, madam, So you should,
gawain is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance,
don't make me no never-mind, he transported!
I understand, - You been smokin'?
Oh, certainly not, ma'am, I understand your indignation, ma'am,
and I was offering an explanation, not an excuse, - I myself am, - Hey, hey, hey, , don't be explainin' me, dawg!
you can't read my motherfuckin' mind, man!
you might got yo' Ph, D, but I got my GED!
Yes, - Nigga!
a fiery lad, but then youth is fiery,
a fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era,
my youth, I was in church, I wasn't walkin' around fiery,
youth ain't no excuse for nothin',
anyhow, I just came to show you the fife, Othar's fife, burned his own,
I thought maybe, you bein' a man of music, you'd be interested,
Oh, indeed I am,
cut it hisself and burned his holes,
the lsraelites called it a khalil,
Yeah, you can read all about it in the Bible, Ain't nothin' new under the sun,
indeed not,
gone these 20 years,
he was some kind of man,
blowed the khalil,
I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand or, or turned his lip to blowing the shofar?
the ceremonial ram's horn sounded by the priests of the Hebrews,
no, I don't know nothin' about that, Othar never blowed no shofar!
of course not, - Not to the extent of my knowledge,
the khalil was good enough for my Othar,
he was some kind of man,
some kind of man,
Oh, goddamn! Come on, girl, let me get one little peek,
don't be cruel, Come on, just one butt cheek,
pull that ass out and make it clap,
Aw, just 'cause I'm dressed like a janitor, don't mean you gotta do me dirty,
this muthafucka's hit the jackpot, Come on, girl,
come over here and blow on these dice,
you know, I'm a seven on the roll now, but I'm a 1 0 the hard way, and I ain't just talkin' crap,
mr Gudge, she had a ass that could pull a bus,
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass, it was literature,
Yeah, I don't care how big her ass was, MacSam, You're fired,
you say what?
there is no fraternizing with customers on the Bandit Queen, - Clean out your locker, - But, Mr, Gudge, I wasn't fraterniz,
I said get outta here, You're fired,
you can't fire me! I'll sue your ass!
sue me? For what?
for fuckin' punitive damages, man!
punitive damages, - Yeah,
punitive damages, You goddamn skippy!
punitive damages, - I see why you firin' me, Mr, Gudge,
Yeah, it's simple and plain, You firin' me 'cause I'm black,
MacSam, everybody on the custodial staff is black,
your replacement is gonna be black,
his replacement, no doubt, will be black!
well, the fuckin' judge is goin' be black, muthafucka, - Oh, - And you?
you gon' stand tall before the man, - Oh,
and your replacement's gonna be black, - muthafucka! - Thank you,
Oh, my,
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
this is a severe setback,
I am distraught, I'm more than distraught,
I am devastated,
I-I'm beside myself, I'm at a positive loss for words, - You still talkin' OK, though, - Have you all decided?
madam, we must have waffles, We must all have waffles forthwith,
we must all think, We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us, to the very best of his ability,
perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers,
or perhaps a fruit basket with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment,
I ain't apologizin' to that muthafucka, He fired me 'cause I'm black!
he can't do that, You could sue him, open and shut case, - Fuckin' A, - Surely a chocolate assortment has been known to melt the heart of even the hardest misanthrope,
that man ain't rollin' over for no fucking candy bar,
uh, we've had a bit of a setback on the tunneling front, too, - We've run into a pretty large rock, - Rock!
very bad, Very bad, - Oh, my,
seems that the poet was right,
troubles never singly come,
Oh, no, we can get through the rock, No worries there,
easiest thing in the world, Why, we just blow right through it,
I got a pyro license, Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock and pack in a little plastique, lgneous blows pretty good, - And then we could, - Hello, Garth, - Am I ordering the primer cord? - Yes, Mountain,
we were just talking about that, and some plastique, - What the fuck is this? - Oh, this is Mountain Girl,
mountain is my right hand, She helps me out with ordnance, - Helps me with, damn near everything, - Hey,
you brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut?
I must confess myself to be puzzled as well,
I thought it was understood that when it came to our little enterprise, "mum" was the word,
of course, I understand that, but this is Mountain Girl,
I don't keep secrets from Mountain,
that's not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship,
you brought yo' bitch to the Waffle Hut!
the man brought his bitch, to the Waffle Hut!
all right, look, you, I will thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way,
she is the other half of my life,
everybody lookin' at me like I'm some kind of fuck-up for losin' a sorry-ass job, and this muthafucka brings his bitch - to the muthafuckin' Waffle Hut! - Son-of-a-bitch punk!
shut your goddamn mouth! - You better raise the fuck up, fucka!
gentlemen, please, - Back the fuck up!
you gon' back that shit the fuck up!
gentlemen, please, - What?! What?!
please, gentlemen, this behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, nor in those of the other patrons of this Waffle Hut,
little punk,
Oh, look at this, I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!
gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman, - Mountain Water, - Mountain Girl,
I'm so very sorry, I propose that we consider this matter closed,
and we shall choose to trust her since we have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr, Pancake 's portion of the booty,
of course, Wouldn't have it any other way, - Yeah, you damn right you won't, - Up yours, punk, - Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss, - The matter of disposing - of our igneous impediment is also,coach，coach，I closed, Settled,
that leaves us only with the question of Gawain retrieving his job, - Coach, l, - Yes, Lump?
couldn't we just bribe the guy?
you are a readin' fool, aren't you, Mr, Dorr?
Yes, I must confess,
I often find myself more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle-bustle of the modern world,
to me, paradoxically, the literature of the so-called "dead tongues
holds more currency than this morning's newspaper,
in these books, in these volumes, there is the accumulated wisdom of mankind, which succors me when the day is hard and the night lonely and long,
mm, The wisdom of mankind, huh?
what about the wisdom of the Lord? - Oh,
Yes, yes, The Good Book, mm, I have found reward in its pages,
but, to me, there are other good books as well,
heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of man's glorious age,
and then, of course, I just love, love, love the works of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
Oh, I know who he was, Kinda spooky,
no, madam, no, no,
not of this world, it's true,
he, he lived in a dream, An ancient dream, "Helen,
thy beauty is to me
like those Nicean barks of yore,
that gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
the weary, wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore,"
who was Helen?
some kinda whore of Babylon? - One doesn't know who Helen was, but I picture her as being very, very, extremely, pale,
Mrs, Munson, I have been trying to figure out some way of expressin' my gratitude to you for takin' in this weary, wayworn wanderer,
it's just a little old present, Why, it's hardly anything at all,
Oh, why, Mr, Dorr! You are a gallant man,
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt, No,
I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night, "The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy," and I thought you and a friend from church perhaps would,?
Yes, I have a widow lady friend, - The concert is up in Memphis, so I have arranged a car service to transport you thither,
ah?
why, Sheriff Wyner! How you doin'?
good evenin', Mrs, Munson,
I just stopped by here to let you know I did have a talk with Weemack, and he told me he's gonna comply with your request in keepin' that music down and neighborly,
so you just go and have yourself a pleasant evenin',
wait a minute, I got somebody that I want you to meet,
uh, ma'am, you know what? I'm, I'm a little pressed for time,
you got a gang of bank robbers youse chasin'?
come on in here and say hello,
Yeah, we was in here, havin' tea and,
huh!
bussed his own dishes, You can always tell a gentleman, - Somebody was in here, ma'am? - Yeah, with me and Othar,
well, you know what? Maybe I'll catch him the next time,
Oh, come on up to his room with me and say hello,
I got a family, My wife got dinner on the table,
I really have to be goin', - Oh, my, He is neat! - Yes, ma'am, he very neat,
he probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends,
ma'am, I really got to be goin' now, - What,? - Ma'am, I really need to be gettin' back,
Mrs, Munson, don't, You don't have to,
Mrs, Munson?
why, Professor!
what in the world are you doin' havin' tea down there?
uh, Mrs, Munson?
Oh, Lord Jesus, - Mrs, Munson? - Land of Goshen, child!
come on out from under there! - Mrs, Munson, my pager just went off,
I got to go, Mm-hm, I'll meet you and your friend later,
that was refreshing,
y'all have a good evenin' now!
as you know, we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves - into confined spaces, - Mm!
at Yale, the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth, At Harvard, a broom closet,
Oh! Hope I didn't spill my tea,
well, what the hell is this?
I guess it's just my way of sayin', um,
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr, Gudge, Look here, l,
I don't know what it's like walkin' in your shoes,
you know, with you bein' a tight-ass and all,
and I'm pretty sure you don't know what it's like walkin' in my shoes,
see, Mr, Gudge, there's the custodian, right?
and then there's the man inside the custodian,
and that's the motherfucker we got a problem with,
see, 'cause that man, he got needs, Mr, Gudge, and normally those needs gotta do with women with big asses,
I guess my point bein' is I realize I'm a bunkie junkie,
but if you woulda seen the kettle drums on this girl, Mr, Gudge, whew!
well, we all human,
this apology buys you a one-week probationary period,
thank you, Mr, Gudge,
stay away from the customers, MacSam,
this drill bit's getting awfully hot,
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill,
fuck you, I ain't your motherfuckin' house nigger, I'm the inside man,
all right, look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?
I'll get the sprayer, - Oh, no, no, no,
me and this gentleman here have to get square,
let me tell you somethin', MacSam,
I'm gonna tell you about how I came down to Mississippi,
I wasn't born here, you know, I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania,
what the fuck?
Scranton, Pennsylvania, Came down here in 1 964, Greyhound bus,
with the Freedom Riders,
do you know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
no, and I don't give a fuck,
just tell me when the fuck they gonna leave, Damn!
the Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up north, all working together, just like we are here,
involved citizens who came down here so that local black folk could have their civil liberties,
so that people like you could have the vote, - You know what, man? - What, brother?
I don't vote, so fuck you, - You little fuckin' ingrate, - And the bus you rode in on, jackass! - Let's step outside, MacSam!
fuck the outside! Come on! What?!
my friend Mrs Funthes is here, so I'm about to go out,
just thought I'd leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies,
why, that is lovely,
Ooh, y'all sound good!
maybe you could come by the church one Sunday, - give us a recital, - Why, how kind of you!
our music, however, is, uh, well, how shall I put this?
uh, a bit Roman in its outlook,
uh, many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See,
Oh, I see, all right, but we don't make no big whoop-dee-do about denomination,
everybody welcome at our church, Yeah, we had a Methodist come in,
Episcopalian, Back in the '60s, we had a Jew come in!
he had a guitar, - A Jew with a guitar,
if you will excuse me one moment, madam, I shall, uh, I shall see you out,
if you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin' old piece of igneous,
Oh, Professor! This is Mrs, Funthes,
Enchante, Mrs, Funthes, allow me,
rosalie, this is Professor G H, Dorr, PhD,
Oh, my, That's an awful lot of letters,
Oh, well, no,
of course, in my youth, I was known simply as Goldthwait,
Uh-huh,
all right safetymeeting.
let's listen up, General, can you hand me the primer cord?
before we set the charge, we will run through our procedure,
I have earplugs for whoever wants them, Just wedge those right in your ears,
now, here we have, Not yet, Lump, - Oh, - Now, primer cord,
Gelatinite, C-4,
time comes, we pack the hole in the rock with the C-4
and insert two leads: A and B,
I remember my father sayin' to me
and it's one of the few memories I retain of the man from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it
he said to me, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other boys,"
he a man of learnin'?
this is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar,
he was a self-educated man, didn't have a career as such, but the government did recognize the breadth of his readin'
by makin' him librarian of the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate,
once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them,
that means me or the General,
separately they are harmless, completely inert,
why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a ham,
what in the name of heavens was that?
well, um, I'm quite certain there's absolutely no reason to be alarmed,
why, I'm not even absolutely certain I heard anything at all,
didn't hear nothin'?!
well, something perhaps,
nothing that need discompose us was the sense I was tryin' to convey,
now, Mrs Munson, I will not have you missin' your musical recital, Off you go!
I shall call the gas company, or the water company,
whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this contretemps,
I shall see to the matter, as only a highly educated classicist could,
blood! Blood, Professor, blood! Blood, blood, blood!
it's nothin' to make a fuss about, It's perfectly all right,
jackass! You better get yo' ass back down there and find that shit, dipshit!
really, I'm perfectly all right, - Perfectly all right?
jackass, you just blew your goddamn finger off!
the muthafucka down there flappin' the fuck around!
you better get yo' ass back down there and find it!
I'm tellin' you right now, nubbie, I ain't pickin' up your goddamn finger!
I gather there was a premature detonation,
would you tell this muthafucka he can sew this shit back on?!
it's like that dude whose wife cut his dick off, threw it on the freeway?
she just called Triple A, they towed the dick and sewed the muthafucka back on!
listen up! Jackass, I saw the muthafucka in a porno!
the thang still worked! It looked like a chewed-up frank, but that little muthafucka be workin' that muthafucka!
it's mangly, but he be fuckin' the bitch all kind of ways with a twisted dick!
Oh! Your fuckin' finger just moved! The muthafucka movin' slow now!
I'm not gettin' that shit, Fuck that! You're on your own there!
they usin' the house to practice music, of the Rococo,
Mmm-hm,
I propose we get our fallen comrade to the hospital,
the General will follow when he manages to recover the severed digit,
no, no, really, I'm perfectly all right, I don't know what all the fuss is about, - Good news! Good news! - Pickles! Go get him!
the house is in apple-pie order, though we do have to get medical attention for Mr, Pancake, who, durin' the disturbance, pinched his finger in the valve of his sackbut,
you let the cat out!
Wha,? The General is even now exercisin' every effort in retrievin'
your mischievous little Pickles, Please, go on,
go on and enjoy the concert! Driver! Au revoir, mesdames, Despite our setback, we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault here this afternoon, while Mrs Munson is at church, havin' blasted that little old rock to pieces durin' Mr Munson's choir practice,
Garth, can you run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnel?
of course, Why, it's child's play now, Easiest thing in the world,
only a couple of feet separate us from the vault,
just the usual spadework until we get to the masonry of the vault, and then we just drill through,
and will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so, yeah, it's, uh, it's only one finger,
inhibits me in doing finer work of course, I'll always have to live with that,
maybe - I'm just thinkin' out loud here
maybe, since as you say there will be problems later, maybe - and I actually mentioned this to Mountain Girl, she agrees with me, so it's not just one person's opinion - maybe, uh,
I should get a little extra compensation for the accident,
somewhat larger share,
why, if this was any other line of work, I'd be getting workman's comp,
wouldn't l? Might even have a pretty good lawsuit,
wait, so you gonna sue yourself for blowing your own goddamn finger off?
well, now that is simply asinine, - Yes, but you see, Garth, this is not what you just called "some other line of work,"
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were,
this is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailing any manner of risk not involved in honest labor,
