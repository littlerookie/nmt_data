maybe they were too original.
all I know is, they didn't sell.
yeah?
joseph C. Gillis? - That's right.
we've come for the car.
what car?
1946 Plymouth convertible,
california license 40-R-116.
where are the keys?
why should I give you the keys?
because the company's played ball long enough...
because you're three payments behind, and because we got a court order.
now, come on. The keys.
or do you want us to jack it up and haul it away?
relax, fans. The car isn't here.
Oh, is that so?
I loaned it to a friend. He took it down to Palm Springs.
had to get away for his health, I suppose.
if you don't believe me, look in the garage.
sure, sure, we believe you. Only now we want you to believe us!
that car better be here tomorrow or there's gonna be fireworks.
you say the cutest things. - Ha.
well, I needed about $ 290...
and I needed it real quick, or I'd lose my car.
it wasn't in Palm Springs, and it wasn't in the garage.
I was way ahead of the finance company.
I knew they'd be coming around, and I wasn't taking any chances.
so I kept it across the street in a lot behind Rudy's Shoeshine Parlor.
Rudy never asked any questions about your finances.
he'd just look at your heels and know the score.
I had an original story kicking around Paramount.
my agent told me it was dead as a doornail.
but I knew a big shot over there who'd always liked me.
the time had come to take a little advantage of it.
his name was Sheldrake.
he was a smart producer with a set of ulcers to prove it.
all right, Gillis, you've got five minutes.
what's your story about?
it's about a baseball player, a rookie shortstop batting. 347.
Uh-huh. - Poor kid was mixed up in a holdup.
but he's trying to go straight.
except some gamblers won't let him.
so they tell the kid he's got to throw the World Series or else, huh?
more or less, except for the end.
I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Uh-huh. You got a title?
bases Loaded. There's a 40-page outline.
call Readers Department.
find out what they have on Bases Loaded.
they're pretty hot about it over at Twentieth, except Zanuck's all wet.
can you see Ty Power as a shortstop?
you've got the best man for it right here on this lot. Alan Ladd.
be a good change of pace for Ladd.
another thing, it's simple to shoot.
lots of outdoor stuff. You could make it all for under a million.
excuse me.
a great part for Bill Demarest...
a trainer, an old-time player who got beaned, goes out of his head.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.
on that Bases Loaded, I covered it with a two-page synopsis.
thank you. - But I wouldn't bother.
what's wrong with it? - It's from hunger.
nothing for Ladd?
it's just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.
this is Miss Kramer.
the name is Schaefer. Betty Schaefer.
right now I wish I could crawl in a hole and pull it in after me.
if I could be of any help...
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just didn't think it was any good.
I found it flat and trite.
exactly what kind of material do you recommend?
James Joyce? Dostoyevsky?
I just think that pictures should say a little something.
Oh, one of the message kids.
just a story won't do.
you'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
no, that was me.
I said, "Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
perhaps I hated it because I'd always heard you had talent.
that was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.
so you take plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick...
those are dirty words.
you sound like New York critics.
that's all, Miss Kramer... Schaefer.
good-bye, Mr. Gillis.
next time I'll write you The Naked and the Dead.
well, it seems like Zanuck has got himself a baseball picture.
I don't want you to think
I thought this would win any Academy Award.
of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.
do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
frankly, no.
wait. If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.
might make a cute musical.
it Happened in the Bullpen. Story of a Woman.
are you trying to be funny? Because I'm all out of laughs.
I'm over a barrel. I need a job.
I haven't got a thing. - Anything. Additional dialogue.
there's nothing. Honest.
look, Mr. Sheldrake.
could you let me have 300 bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
could I? Gillis.
last year somebody talked me into buying a ranch in the Valley.
so I borrowed the money from the bank in order to pay for the ranch.
this year I mortgaged the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance...
so I could borrow on my insurance...
after that I drove down to headquarters.
that's the way a lot of us think about Schwab's drugstore.
kind of a combination office, kaffeeklatsch and waiting room.
waiting.
waiting for the gravy train.
I got myself ten nickels and started sending out a general SOS.
couldn't get hold of my agent, naturally.
so then I called a pal of mine, Artie Green...
an awful nice guy, an assistant director.
he could let me have 20.
but 20 wouldn't do.
then I talked to a couple of yes-men at Metro.
to me they said no.
finally I located that agent of mine. The big faker.
was he out digging up a job for poor Joe Gillis?
no. He was hard at work in Bel-Air, making with the golf sticks.
so you need $300. Of course I could give you $300.
only I'm not going to. - No?
get this. I'm not just your agent.
it's not the ten percent.
I'm your friend. - You are?
don't you know the finest things were written on an empty stomach?
once a talent gets in that Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through.
forget Romanoff's. It's the car I'm talking' about!
if I lose my car, it's like having my legs cut off.
greatest thing that could happen to you.
now you'll have to sit behind the typewriter.
you'll have to write.
what do you think I've been doing? I need $300.
sweetheart, maybe what you need is another agent.
as I drove back towards town, I took inventory of my prospects.
they now added up to exactly zero.
apparently I just didn't have what it takes...
and the time had come to wrap up t he whole Hollywood deal and go home.
maybe if I hocked all my junk
I'd have enough for a bus back to Ohio.
back to that $35-a-week job writing copy at the Dayton Evening Post...
if it was still open.
back to the smirking delight of the whole office.
all right, wise guys.
why don't you go and take a crack at Hollywood?
maybe you think that you could make...
Uh-oh.
I had landed myself in the driveway of some big mansion...
that looked run-down and deserted.
at the end of the drive was a lovely sight indeed...
a great big empty garage just standing there going to waste.
a perfect place to stash a limping car with a hot license number.
there was another occupant in that garage...
an enormous, foreign-built automobile.
it must have burned up ten gallons to a mile.
it had a 1932 license.
I figured that's when the owners had moved out.
and I also figured that I couldn't go back to my apartment...
now that those bloodhounds were onto me.
the idea was to get to Artie Green's and stay there...
until I could make that bus for Ohio.
once back in Dayton,
I'd drop the credit boys a picture postcard...
telling them where to pick up the jalopy.
it was a great big white elephant of a place...
the kind crazy movie people built in the crazy '20s.
a neglected house gets an unhappy look.
this one had it in spades.
it was like that old woman in Great Expectations...
that Miss Havisham in her rotting wedding dress and her torn veil...
taking it out on the world because she'd been given the go-by.
you there! Why are you so late?
why have you kept me waiting so long?
in here.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blowout.
I thought maybe...
go on in. - Maybe I better take my car and...
wipe your feet.
go on.
you're not properly dressed for the occasion.
what's the occasion? - Have him come up, Max.
up the stairs. - Suppose you listen for a minute.
Madame is waiting.
for me?
okay.
if you need any help with the coffin, call me.
this way.
in here.
I put him on my massage table in front of the fire.
he always liked fires and poking at them with a stick.
I've decided we'll bury him in the garden.
any city laws against that?
I wouldn't know. - I don't care anyway.
I want a white coffin, and I want it specially lined with satin.
white or deep pink.
maybe red. Bright, flaming red. Let's make it gay.
how much will it be?
I warn you, don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich!
lady, you got the wrong man.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.
I pulled into your garage until I could get a spare.
I thought this was an empty house.
it is not. Get out.
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry you lost your friend.
and I don't think red is the right color.
wait a minute. Haven't I seen you before? I know your face.
get out. Or shall I call my servant?
you're Norma Desmond!
you used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big!
I am big.
it's the pictures that got small.
Uh-huh.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
they're dead. They're finished.
there was a time when this business had the eyes of the whole world.
but that wasn't good enough for them. Oh, no!
they had to have the ears of the world too.
so they opened their big mouths and out came talk, talk, talk.
that's where the popcorn business comes in.
you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
look at them in the front offices, the masterminds!
they took the idols and smashed them.
the Fairbankses, the Gilberts, the Valentinos!
and who have we got now? Some nobodies!
don't blame me. I'm not an executive, just a writer.
you are. Writing words, words, more words!
well, you've made a rope of words and strangled this business!
but there's a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles...
and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Shh. You'll wake up the monkey.
get out! Max!
next time I'll bring my autograph album along.
or maybe a hunk of cement, and ask for your footprint.
it's okay. Okay, I'm going. - Just a minute, you.
you're a writer, you said. - Why?
are you or aren't you?
that's what it says on my Guild card.
and you have written pictures, haven't you?
sure have. Want a list of my credits?
I want to ask you something. Come in here.
last one I wrote was about Okies in the Dust Bowl.
you'd never know it, because when it reached the screen...
the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
intimate, isn't it?
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.
I ought to have it taken out.
or teach it a better tune.
young man, tell me something.
how long is a movie script these days? I mean how many pages?
depends on what it is, a Donald Duck or a Joan of Arc.
this is to be a very important picture.
I've written it myself. Took me years.
looks like enough for six important pictures.
it's a story of Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
DeMille? Uh-huh.
we made many pictures together. - And you'll play Salome.
who else?
only asking. I didn't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word! It's a return!
a return to the millions who never forgave me for deserting the screen.
fair enough. - Salome.
what a woman. What a part!
the princess in love with a holy man.
she dances the dance of the seven veils.
he rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray...
kissing his cold, dead lips.
they'll love it in Pomona.
they'll love it every place.
read it. Read the scene just before she has him killed.
never let another writer read your material. He may steal it.
I'm not afraid. Read it. Max, bring something to drink.
sit down. Is there enough light?
I've got 20-20 vision.
I said sit down.
well, I had no pressing engagement...
except with those boys from the finance office...
and she'd mentioned something to drink.
why not?
sometimes it's interesting to see just how bad bad writing can be.
this promised to go the limit.
I wondered what a handwriting expert would make of her childish scrawl.
Max wheeled in some champagne and some caviar.
later I found out that Max was the only other person in that grim Sunset castle.
and I found out a few other things about him.
as for her, she sat coiled up like a watch spring...
her cigarette clamped in a curious holder.
I could sense her eyes on me from behind those dark glasses...
defying me not to like what I read.
or maybe begging me in her own proud way to like it.
it meant so much to her.
it sure was a cozy setup...
that bundle of raw nerves and Max...
and a dead monkey upstairs...
and the wind wheezing through that organ once in a while.
later on, just for comedy relief...
the real guy arrived with the baby coffin.
it was all done with great dignity.
he must have been a very important chimp.
the great-grandson of King Kong maybe.
it got to be 11.00.
I was feeling a little sick at my stomach...
what with that sweet champagne and that tripe I'd been reading...
that silly hodgepodge of melodramatic plots.
however, by then...
I'd started concocting a little plot of my own.
well?
this is fascinating.
of course it is.
maybe it's a little long and maybe there's some repetitions...
but you're not a professional writer.
I wrote that with my heart.
sure you did.
that's what makes it great.
what it needs is maybe a little more dialogue.
what for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.
well, it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
of course not, but it ought to be organized.
just an editing job. You can find somebody.
who? I'd have to have somebody I could trust.
when were you born? I mean what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know. - What month?
december 21.
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
thank you. - I want you to do this work.
me?
I'm busy. I just finished a script, and I'm doing another assignment.
I don't care.
you know, I'm pretty expensive. I get 500 a week.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it.
I couldn't let it out of my house. You'll have to finish it here.
well, it's getting kind of late.
are you married, Mr...
name is Gillis. Single.
where do you live?
Hollywood. Alto Nido Apartments.
there's something wrong with your car, you said.
there sure is.
why shouldn't you stay here? - I'll come back early tomorrow.
nonsense. There's a room over the garage.
Max will take you there.
Max!
I felt kind of pleased with the way I'd handled the situation.
I dropped the hook, and she snapped at it.
my car would be safe below while I did a patch-up job on the script.
and there should be plenty of money in it.
this room hasn't been used for a long time.
it'll never make House Beautiful, but I guess it's okay for one night.
I made your bed this afternoon.
Thanks. How did you know
I was gonna stay this afternoon?
the bathroom's over there.
I put in some towels, soap and a toothbrush.
say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
she was the greatest of them all.
you wouldn't know. You're too young.
in one week she received 17, 000 fan letters.
men bribed her hairdresser to get a lock of her hair.
there was a maharaja who came all the way from India...
to beg one of her silk stockings.
later he strangled himself with it.
well, I sure turned in to an interesting driveway.
you did, sir.
good night, sir.
I pegged him as slightly cuckoo too.
a stroke, maybe.
come to think of it, the whole place seemed to be stricken...
with a kind of creeping paralysis...
out of beat with the rest of the world...
crumbling apart in slow motion.
there was a tennis court...
or rather the ghost of a tennis court...
with faded markings and a sagging net.
and of course she had a pool.
who didn't then?
Mabel Normand and John Gilbert must have swum in it 10, 000 midnights ago.
and Vilma Banky and Rod LaRoque.
it was empty now.
or was it?
there was something else going on below.
the last rites for that hairy old chimp...
performed with the utmost seriousness...
as if she were laying to rest an only child.
was her life really as empty as that?
it was all very queer.
but queerer things were yet to come.
that night I had a mixed-up dream.
in it there was an organ grinder.
I couldn't see his face, but the organ was all draped in black...
and a chimp was dancing for pennies.
when I opened my eyes, the music was still there.
where was I?
Oh, yes. That empty room over her garage.
only it wasn't empty anymore.
I'd had a visitor.
somebody had brought my belongings...my books, my typewriter, my clothes.
what was going on?
Hey, you! Max, whatever-your-name-is, what are my things doing here?
I'm talking to you! My clothes and things are up in the room!
naturally. I brought them myself.
is that so?
why, what's the matter? Is there anything missing?
who said you could? Who asked you to?
I did. I don't know why you should be so upset.
stop that playing, Max.
it seemed like a good idea if we are to work together.
look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.
there's no deal about my staying! - You'll like it here.
thanks for the invitation. I've got my own apartment.
you can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that. - It's all taken care of, paid for.
okay, we'll deduct it from my salary.
now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.
we won't keep books.
Max, unpack Mr. Gillis's things.
it is done, Madame.
well, pack them up again! I didn't say I was staying!
suppose you make up your mind.
do you want this job or don't you?
Yes, I wanted the job.
I wanted the dough, and I wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could.
I thought if I really got going I could finish it up in a couple of weeks.
but it wasn't so simple getting some coherence...
into those wild hallucinations of hers.
and what made it even tougher was that she was around all the time...
hovering over me, afraid I'd do injury to her precious brainchild.
what's that? - Just a scene I threw out.
which scene?
the one where you go to the slave market.
it's better to cut to John...
cut away from me?
honestly, it's too much of you.
they don't want you in every scene.
they don't?
then why do they still write me fan letters every day?
why do they beg me for my photographs?
Why? Because they want to see me.
me! Norma Desmond.
put it back.
okay.
I didn't argue with her.
you don't yell at a sleepwalker.
he may fall and break his neck.
that's it.
she was still sleepwalking along the giddy heights of a lost career.
plain crazy when it came to that one subject, her celluloid self...
the great Norma Desmond.
how could she breathe in that house so crowded with Norma Desmonds?
more Norma Desmonds.
and still more Norma Desmonds.
it wasn't all work, of course.
two or three times a week,
Max would haul up that enormous painting...
that had been presented to her by some Nevada chamber of commerce...
and we'd see a movie, right in her living room.
so much nicer than going out, she'd say.
the plain fact was she was afraid of that world outside.
afraid it would remind her that time had passed.
they were silent movies, and Max would run the projection machine...
which was just as well.
it kept him from giving us an accompaniment on that wheezing organ.
she'd sit very close to me...
and she smelled of tuberoses, which is not my favorite perfume...
not by a long shot.
sometimes as we watched, she'd clutch my arm or my hand...
forgetting she was my employer.
just becoming a fan, excited about that actress up there on the screen.
I guess I don't have to tell you who the star was.
they were always her pictures.
that's all she wanted to see.
still wonderful, isn't it?
and no dialogue.
we didn't need dialogue. We had faces.
there just aren't any faces like that anymore.
maybe one, Garbo.
Oh, those idiot producers.
those imbeciles.
haven't they got any eyes?
have they forgotten what a star looks like?
I'll show them. I'll be up there again, so help me!
sometimes there'd be a little bridge game in the house...
at a twentieth of a cent a point.
I'd get half of her winnings.
once they ran up to 70 cents...
which was about the only cash money I ever got.
the others around the table would be actor friends...
dim figures you may still remember from the silent days.
I used to think of them as her waxworks.
one diamond.
one heart.
spade.
pass.
three no-trump. - Pass.
pass.
empty the ashtray, will you, Joe, dear?
some men outside asked for you. - I'm not here.
that's what I told them. - Good.
but they found your car and they're going to tow it away.
Where's the ashtray?
Joe, can't we have the ashtray?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
not now, my dear. I'm playing three no-trump.
they've come for my car.
please. Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
look, I need some money right now.
can't you wait until I'm dummy?
no.
please.
now what is it? Where's the fire?
I've lost my car. - Oh!
and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
it is, to me. That's why I came to this house.
that's why I took this job ghostwriting.
now you're being silly. We don't need two cars. We have a car.
not one of those cheap new things made of chromium and spit.
an Isotta-Fraschini. Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschini?
all handmade. Cost me $28, 000.
so Max got that old bus down off its blocks and polished it up.
she'd take me for rides in the hills above Sunset.
the whole thing was upholstered in leopard skin...
and had one of those car phones, all gold-plated.
that's a dreadful shirt. - What's wrong with it?
nothing, if you work in the filling station.
and I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket and same baggy pants.
Max, what's a good men's shop? The very best?
well, go there.
I don't need clothes, and I don't want you buying them for me.
why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice.
and must you chew gum?
Ah, there's nothing like blue flannel for a man.
this one, single-breasted, of course.
now we need a topcoat. Let me see what you have in camel's hair.
how about some evening clothes? - I don't need a tuxedo.
you do. A tuxedo and tails, and if you aren't careful, a cutaway.
tails! That's ridiculous.
you need them for parties. You need them for New Year's Eve.
where are your evening clothes? - This way, Madame.
here are some camel's hair, but I'd like you just to feel this.
it's vicuna. Of course, it's a little more expensive.
the camel's hair will do.
well, as long as the lady's paying for it, why not take the vicuna?
the last week in December, the rains came.
a great big package of rain...
oversized, like everything else in California.
it came right through the old roof of my room above the garage.
she had Max move me to the main house.
I didn't much like the idea.
the only time I could have to myself was in that room.
but it was better than sleeping in a raincoat and galoshes.
whose room was this?
it was the room of the husband.
of the husbands, I should say.
Madame has been married three times.
I guess that's the one you can see Catalina from.
only this isn't the day.
say, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
there are no locks anywhere in this house, sir.
how come?
there must be a reason.
the doctor suggested it. - What doctor?
Madame's doctor.
Madame has moments of melancholy.
there have been some attempts at suicide.
we have to be very careful. No sleeping pills, no razor blades.
we shut off the gas in Madame's bedroom.
Why? Her career?
she got enough out of it. She's not forgotten.
she still gets those fan letters.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
you send them. Is that it, Max?
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.
Mr. Gillis has not forgotten Madame's New Year's party?
no, no, I haven't.
I suppose all the waxworks are coming.
I wouldn't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.
there it was again.
that room of hers, all satin and ruffles.
and that bed, like a gilded rowboat.
the perfect setting for a silent movie queen.
poor devil.
still waving proudly to a parade which had long since passed her by.
it was at her New Year's party that I found out how she felt about me.
maybe I'd been an idiot not to have sensed it was coming...
that sad, embarrassing revelation.
Joe!
you look absolutely divine.
turn around. - Please.
come on. Perfect. Wonderful shoulders.
I love that line.
it's all padding. Don't let it fool you.
to me, getting dressed up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
I don't like the stud they sent. I want you to have a pearl.
a big luscious pearl.
well, I'm not going to wear earrings, I can tell you that.
cute. Let's have a drink.
shouldn't we wait for the others? - Max, champagne.
careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.
here's to us.
this floor used to be wood, but I had it changed.
Valentino said there's nothing like tile for a tango.
come on.
not on the same floor with Valentino.
just follow me.
don't bend back like that.
it's that thing. It tickles.
it does?
it's quarter past 10: 00. What time are they supposed to get here?
who? - The other guests.
there are no guests.
we don't want to share this night with others.
this is for you and me.
Oh? - Hold me tighter.
okay.
come midnight, how about blindfolding the orchestra...
and smashing champagne glasses over Max's head?
you think this is all very funny.
a little.
an hour dragged by.
I felt caught, like the cigarette in that contraption on her finger.
what a wonderful next year it's going to be.
what fun we'll have!
I'll fill the pool for you.
I'll open my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean.
when our picture is finished, I'll buy you a boat...
and we'll sail to Hawaii...
stop it. You're not gonna buy me anything more.
don't be silly.
here. I was going to give it to you at midnight.
Norma, I can't take it. You've bought me enough.
shut up. I'm rich.
I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash.
I've got a million dollars. - Keep it.
I own three blocks downtown. I've got oil in Bakersfield.
pumping, pumping, pumping.
what's it for but to buy us anything we want?
cut out that "us" business!
what's the matter with you?
what right do you have to take me for granted?
what right? Do you want me to tell you?
has it ever occurred to you that I may have a life of my own?
that there may be some girl that I'm crazy about?
who? Some carhop or dress extra?
what I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you.
you want a Valentino, somebody with polo ponies. A big shot.
what you're trying to say is you don't want me to love you.
say it.
say it!
I didn't know where I was going.
I just had to get out of there.
I had to be with people my own age.
I had to hear somebody laugh again.
I thought of Artie Green.
there was bound to be a New Year's shindig going on...
in his apartment down on Las Palmas.
writers without a job, composers without a publisher...
actresses so young they still believe the guys in the casting offices.
a bunch of kids who didn't give a hoot...
just so long as they had a yuk to share.
Hollywood for us ain't been so good
got no swimming pool Very few clothes
all we earn are buttons and bows - Hello, Joe. - How are you, Joe?
welcome to the party. - Hi, Joe.
what do you know! Joe Gillis! - Hi, Artie.
where you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
in a deep freeze. - I almost reported you as missing.
fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screenwriter...
uranium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
come on, gimme your coat. - Let it ride for a while.
you're gonna stay, aren't you? - That was the general idea.
well, come on.
what is this, mink?
Judas H. Priest!
who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
close, but no cigar.
you're not really a smuggler, are you?
Where's the bar? - Come on.
it's a good party. - The greatest.
they call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.
Hey, wait a minute. Go easy on that punch bowl.
budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
say, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
sure. This will go on all night.
no, I mean can you put me up for a couple of weeks?
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I'll take it. - The bellhop can take your luggage.
just register it here.
Hello, Mr. Gillis. - Hello.
you know each other? - Let me help you.
Betty Schaefer, Sheldrake's office.
Oh, sure. Bases Loaded.
wait. This is the woman I love.
what's going on? Who was loaded?
don't worry. She's just a fan for my literary output.
hurt feelings department. - Where's the phone?
over by the rainbow room.
say, when you're through with that thing, can I have it?
Hey, you forgot this.
Thanks. - I've been hoping to run into you.
what for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
no, I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
why, you sweet kid.
there's one called Window, something with a window.
dark Windows. How'd you like it? - I didn't.
thank you. - Except for about six pages.
you've got a flashback there...
is there someplace we can talk?
how about the rainbow room?
Hey. I said you could have my couch.
I didn't say you could have my girl.
Oh, this is shop talk.
now, if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction...
which you found worthy of notice.
the flashback scene in the courtroom when she tells about being a teacher.
I had a teacher like that once.
maybe that's why it's good.
it's true. It's moving.
why don't you use that character...
who wants true? Who wants moving?
drop that attitude! Here's something really worthwhile.
want me to start right away? Maybe there's some paper around.
I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
I've got a few ideas of my own.
one being this is New Year's Eve.
how about living it up a little?
as for instance? - Well...
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta.
or we could turn on the shower full blast.
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
are you hungry? - Hungry?
after 12 years in the Burmese jungle,
I'm starving, Lady Agatha.
starving for a white shoulder...
Phillip, you're mad!
thirsting for the coolness of your lips.
you can have the phone now.
no, Phillip, no. We must be strong.
you're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards.
furthermore, you can have the phone now.
okay.
suddenly I find myself terribly afraid of losing you.
you won't. I'll get us a refill of this horrible liquid.
you'll be waiting for me? - With a wildly beating heart.
life can be beautiful.
Hello, Max. This is Mr. Gillis.
I want you to do me a favor.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis. I cannot talk now.
Yes, you can.
get my old suitcase and put in all my old clothes.
and my typewriter. I'll have somebody pick them up.
I have no time to do anything now. The doctor is here.
what doctor? What's going on?
Madame got the razor from your room, and she cut her wrists.
what?
I just got the recipe. You take two packages of cough drops...
and dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice...
Hey, Joe!
happy NeW Year!
how is she? - She's up in her room.
be careful. Don't race upstairs.
the musicians mustn't know what happened.
go aWay.
what kind of a silly thing was that to do?
to fall in love with you, that was the idiotic thing.
it sure would have made attractive headlines.
great Star Kills Herself for Unknown Writer.
great stars have great pride.
go away.
go to that girl of yours.
look, I was making that up...
because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.
I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.
you're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
why don't you just say thank you and go?
go, go!
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again. I'll do it again.
I'll do it again.
happy New Year, Norma.
happy New Year, darling.
Hello?
is this Crestview 5-1733?
I'm sorry to bother you again, but I've confirmed the number.
I must speak to Mr. Gillis.
he's not here.
where can I reach him? Maybe somebody else could tell me...
nobody here can give you any information.
and you will please not call again.
who was it, Max? What is it?
nothing, Madame.
somebody inquiring about a stray dog.
our number must be very similar to the number of the pound.
wait a minute. I want you to get out the car.
take the script to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. DeMille in person.
very good, Madame.
you really sending it to DeMille? - Yes, I am.
this is the day.
here's the chart from my astrologer.
she read my horoscope and DeMille's.
she read the script?
DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio.
mars has been transiting Jupiter.
today is the day of the greatest conjunction.
turn around, darling. Let me dry you.
I hope you realize that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I'm not just selling the script, I'm selling me.
DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
when did he say it, Norma?
all right, it was quite a few years ago.
the point is, I never looked better in my life.
you know why? Because I've never been as happy in my life.
a few evenings later we were going to the house of one of the waxworks...
for some bridge.
she'd taught me how to play bridge by then...
just as she'd taught me some fancy tango steps...
and what wine to drink with what fish.
that idiot. He forgot to fill my cigarette case.
here, have one of mine.
they're dreadful. They make me cough.
pull up to the drugstore, Max. I'll get you some.
you're a darling.
give me a package of those Turkish cigarettes...
Abdullas.
stick them up, Gillis.
stick them up, or I'll let you have it.
Hi, Artie. Evening, Miss Schaefer.
I'm so glad to see you. - Walking out on the mob.
what's the big idea? - I'm sorry about New Year's.
would you believe me if I told you I stayed with a sick friend?
someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
Oh, stop it, Artie, will you?
where have you been keeping yourself?
I've got wonderful news for you.
I haven't been keeping myself at all. Not lately.
I called your agent, I called the Screenwriters Guild.
finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.
somebody with an accent growling at me.
you weren't there.
you weren't to be spoken to. They never heard of you.
is that so?
what's the wonderful news? - Sheldrake likes the teacher angle.
what teacher? - Dark Windows.
I got him all hopped up about it.
he thinks it could be made into something.
okay, where's the cash?
Where's the story?
I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own.
it needs work. - I was afraid of that.
I've got 20 pages of notes and a pretty good character for the man.
write in plenty of background action...
so they'll need an extra assistant director.
Oh, Artie, shut up.
if we could sit down for 2 weeks...
I'm sorry, Miss Schaefer.
I've given up writing on spec.
but this is half sold.
as a matter of fact, I've given up writing altogether.
Mr. Gillis.
if you please. - I'll be right there.
the accent. I get it.
this guy's in the pay of a foreign government.
check those studs. Get those cuff links.
I've got to run along.
thanks anyway for your interest in my career.
it's not your career, it's mine.
I'd hoped to get in on this deal.
I don't want to be a reader all my life. I want to write.
I'm sorry if I crossed you up.
you sure have.
so long.
what on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I know.
where are my cigarettes? - Where are your...
Norma, you're smoking too much.
whenever she suspected I was getting bored...
she would put on a live show for me...
the Norma Desmond Follies.
her first number was always the Mack Sennett bathing beauty.
I can still see myself in the line.
Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand.
Mabel was always stepping on my feet.
what's the matter with you, darling?
why are you so glum?
nothing's the matter. I'm having a great time.
show me some more. - All right.
give me this. I need it for a mustache.
now close your eyes. Close them.
something was the matter, all right.
I was thinking about that girl of Artie's...
that Miss Schaefer.
she was so like all us writers when we first hit Hollywood...
itching with ambition...
panting to get your names up there.
screenplay by. Original story by.
audiences don't know somebody sits down and writes a picture.
they think the actors make it up as they go along.
open your eyes.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
you know better than to interrupt me.
paramount is calling. - Who?
paramount studios.
now! Now do you believe me?
I told you DeMille would jump at it.
it is not Mr. DeMille in person.
it is someone called Gordon Cole. He says it is very important.
certainly it's important.
it's important enough for Mr. DeMille to call me personally.
the very idea of having some assistant call me!
say I'm busy and hang up!
very good, Madame.
how do you like that?
we've made 12 pictures together. His greatest successes!
maybe he's busy shooting.
I know that trick!
he's trying to belittle me. He's trying to get my price down.
I've waited 20 years for this call.
now DeMille can wait until I'm good and ready!
about three days later she was good and ready.
incredible as it may seem...
there had been some more of those urgent calls from Paramount.
so she put on about a half pound of makeup, fixed it up with a veil...
and set forth to see DeMille in person.
Madame will pardon me.
the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
thank you, Max.
hold that noise!
to see Mr. DeMille. Open the gate.
Mr. DeMille is shooting. You got an appointment?
no appointment necessary.
I'm bringing Norma Desmond.
Norma who?
Norma Desmond!
Jonesy! Hey, Jonesy!
yeah?
why, if it isn't Miss Desmond!
how have you been, Miss Desmond?
open the gate.
sure, Miss Desmond. Come on, Mac.
they can't drive on the lot without a pass.
miss Desmond can. Come on.
Where's Mr. DeMille shooting?
stage 18, Miss Desmond.
thank you, Jonesy.
and teach your friend some manners.
without me he wouldn't have any job...
because without me there wouldn't be any Paramount studio.
you're right, Miss Desmond.
go on, Max.
stage 18.
all right, notify Henry Wilcoxon.
just clear a minute. Spread that thing out so I can see it.
keep quiet back there.
Norma Desmond's coming in to see Mr. DeMille.
hit that with a light, somebody, so I can get a look at that cape.
back up a little bit.
soldier, get out of the way. You fellows in the back there.
Norma Desmond's coming in to see Mr. DeMille.
Norma Desmond?
wait a minute.
Henry Wilcoxon, draw your sword and raise that drape with it.
Samson's lying unconscious over here.
Norma Desmond is coming in to see you, Mr. DeMille.
Norma Desmond? - She must be a million years old.
I hate to think where that puts me.
I could be her father. - I'm very sorry, Mr. DeMille.
it must be about that awful script of hers.
what can I tell her? What can I say?
I'll say you're tied up in the projection room.
I'll give her the brush.
thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
I didn't mean to... - No, of course you didn't.
you didn't know Norma Desmond as a lovely little girl of 17...
with more courage and wit and heart...than ever came together in one youngster.
I understand she was a terror to work with.
only toward the end.
you know, a dozen press agents working overtime...
can do terrible things to the human spirit.
hold everything.
don't you want to come along? - I don't think so.
it's your script, it's your show. Good luck.
thank you, dearest.
well, hello, young fella.
Hello, Mr. DeMille. - It's good to see you.
the last time I saw you was someplace very gay.
I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
a lot of people were. Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.
come on in.
Norma, I must apologize for not calling you.
you'd better. I'm very angry.
well, you can see I'm terribly busy.
that's no excuse. You read the script, of course.
Yes, I did.
then you could've picked up the telephone yourself...
instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
what assistant? - Now, don't play innocent.
somebody named Gordon Cole.
gordon Cole?
and if you hadn't been pretty darn interested in that script...
he wouldn't have tried to get me on the telephone ten times.
gordon Cole.
Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.
why don't you sit here in my chair and make yourself comfortable.
thank you. - That's a girl.
I won't be a moment.
bring me a telephone...
and get me Gordon Cole.
Hey! Miss Desmond!
it's me! It's Hog-Eye!
Hello, Hog-Eye.
let's get a good look at you.
look. There's Norma Desmond.
Norma Desmond!
Norma Desmond! - Why, I thought she was dead.
how nice to see you.
welcome home, Miss Desmond. You remember me, don't you?
doesn't she look wonderful? - Hello, Bessy.
Mr. Wilcoxon, have you met Miss Desmond?
it's a great pleasure.
Gordon, this is C. B. DeMille.
have you been calling Norma Desmond?
Yes, Mr. DeMille.
it's that car of hers, an old Isotta-Fraschini.
her chauffeur drove it on the lot the other day.
it looks just right for the Crosby picture.
we want to rent it.
Oh, I see.
well...
thank you very much.
Hog-Eye...
turn that light back where it belongs.
I got hold of Gordon Cole.
did you see them? Did you see how they came?
you know, some crazy things happen in this business, Norma.
I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor.
what's the matter, dear?
nothing.
I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the studio.
I had no idea how much I missed it.
we've missed you too, dear.
we'll work again, won't we, Chief?
we'll make our greatest picture.
that's why I want to talk to you.
it's a good script, isn't it?
well, it has some good things in it, yes.
but it'd be a very expensive picture.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.
you don't know what it means to know that you want me.
nothing would please me more, Norma, if...
if it were possible.
and remember, I don't work before 10: 00 in the morning...
and never after 4: 30 in the afternoon.
we're ready for the shot, Mr. DeMille.
all right.
Norma, why don't you just sit here and watch.
you know, pictures have changed quite a bit.
all right, let's go.
hit 'em all!
roll 'em.
speed!
you see those offices there, Mr. Gillis?
they used to be Madame's dressing room.
the whole row.
that didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
Oh, he had a great big bungalow on wheels.
I had the upstairs.
you see where it says "Readers Department"?
I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather.
I'll be with you in a minute.
here's that funny car Gordon Cole was talking about.
Yeah. - Mind if we look it over?
what's so funny about it?
just so you don't think I'm a complete swine...
if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, it's all yours.
for heaven's sakes! Come on in, have a chair.
I mean it. It's no good to me anyway.
help yourself. - Why should you do that?
if you get 100, 000 for it, buy me some chocolate creams.
if you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
I'd take you up on that.
I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
what about all your ideas?
well, see if they make sense.
to begin with, you should throw out all that psychological mess...
exploring a killer's sick mind.
psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
this is a story about teachers...
their threadbare lives and struggles.
I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.
the first time they meet...
I haven't time to listen to the whole plot.
I'll make it short.
I'm sorry. It's your baby now.
couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning?
this next month I'm completely at your disposal.
Artie's out of town. - What's Artie got to do with it?
we're engaged.
Oh. Well, good for you.
you couldn't find a nicer guy. - That's what I think.
they're on location in Arizona making a Western.
I'm free every evening and every weekend.
we could work at your place if you want.
look, Betty, it can't be done.
now stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
honest to goodness, I hate you. - And don't make it too dreary.
how about this? She teaches daytimes, he teaches at night, right?
they don't even know each other, but they share the same room.
it's cheaper that way.
as a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed.
in shifts, of course.
are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
so do I. - Let me show you where it fits in.
so long.
Oh, you!
what's the matter?
I just found out the reason for all those phone calls from Paramount.
it's not Madame they want.
it's her car they want to rent.
what?
well, good-bye, Norma. We'll see what we can do.
I'm not worried. Everything'll be fine.
the old team together again. Nothing can stop us.
the old team. Yeah.
good-bye, dear. - Good-bye, Mr. DeMille.
how'd it go? - It couldn't have gone better.
it's practically set.
he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
get Gordon Cole.
tell him to forget about her car.
tell him he can get another old car someplace.
I'll buy him five old cars, if necessary.
after that...
an army of beauty experts invaded her house on Sunset Boulevard.
she went through a merciless series of treatments.
like an athlete training for the Olympic Games...
she counted every calorie...
went to bed every night at 9.00.
she was absolutely determined to be ready...
ready for those cameras that would never turn.
Joe, darling, are you there? - Yes, Norma.
don't turn around. Keep your eyes on the book.
I just came to say good night.
I don't want you to see me. I'm not very attractive.
good night. - I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
good.
I was worried about the line on my throat.
this woman's done wonders with it. - Good.
better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little longer.
you went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
why do you say that? - I happen to know it.
I had a nightmare and screamed for you.
you weren't here. Where were you?
I went for a walk. - No, you didn't. You took the car.
all right, I drove to the beach.
you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house.
of course not, Joe.
I just don't want to be left alone while I'm under this terrible strain.
my nerves are being torn to shreds.
all I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything.
of course you haven't.
I wouldn't let you.
good night, darling.
yes...
I was playing hooky every evening along in there.
it made me think of when I was 12 and used to sneak out on the folks...
to see a gangster picture.
this time it wasn't to see a picture...
it was to try and write one.
that story of mine Betty had dug up kept going through my head...like a dozen locomotives.
so we started working on it, the two of us...
nights when the studio was deserted...
up in her little cubbyhole of an office.
I got the funniest letter from Artie.
it's rained every day since they got to Arizona.
they rewrote the whole picture for rain and shot half of it.
now the sun is out. Nobody knows when they'll get back.
good. - What's good about it?
I miss him something fierce.
I mean, this is good dialogue here. It'll play.
it will? - Sure.
especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
don't you sometimes hate yourself?
constantly.
no, in all seriousness, this is really good.
it's fun writing with you.
well, thanks.
who's Norma?
who's who?
I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Oh, that.
it's from a friend of mine.
a middle-aged lady.
very foolish and very generous.
I'll say. This is solid gold.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Oh, the old familiar story.
you help a timid little soul cross a crowded street.
she turns out to be a multimillionaire...
and leaves you all her money.
that's the trouble with you readers... you know all the plots.
suppose you proofread page ten while the water boils.
okay? - Okay.
sometimes, when we got stuck...
we'd make a little tour of the drowsing lot.
not talking much...
just wandering down alleys between the soundstages...
or through the sets they were getting ready for the next day's shooting.
as a matter of fact...
it was on one of those walks when she first told me about her nose.
look at this street.
all cardboard, all hollow, all phony, all done with mirrors.
you know, I like it better than any street in the world.
maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
what were you, a child actress?
no, I was born just two blocks from this studio...
right on Lemon Grove Avenue.
my father was head electrician here till he died.
mother still works in wardrobe.
second generation, huh?
third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.
I come from a picture family.
naturally they expected me to become a great star...
so I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.
then the studio made a test.
well, they didn't like my nose.
slanted this way a little.
so I had it fixed.
they made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose.
only they didn't like my acting.
nice job. - It should be.
it cost me $300.
that's the saddest thing I ever heard.
not at all. It taught me a little sense.
I got a job in the mail room, and now I'm a reader.
come clean, Betty.
at night you weep for those lost close-ups, those gala openings.
not once.
what's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras?
it's really more fun.
three cheers for Betty Schaefer.
I will now kiss that nose of yours. - Lf you please.
may I say that you smell real special?
must be my new shampoo.
that's no shampoo.
it's more like freshly laundered linen handkerchiefs...
like a brand-new automobile.
how old are you, anyway? - TWenty-tWo.
smart girl.
nothing like being 22.
and may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story...
you stay at least two feet away from me.
the first time I come any closer, clunk me on the head with a shoe.
now back to the typewriters...
by way of Washington Square.
what is it, Max?
want to wash the car?
or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
you must be very careful as you cross the patio.
Madame may be watching.
will going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark do it?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night.
why don't you?
I'm writing a script...
and I'm gonna finish it no matter what.
it is just that I am greatly worried about Madame.
sure, you are.
and we're not helping her any...
feeding her lies and more lies, getting herself ready for a picture.
what happens when she finds out?
she never will.
that is my job, and it has been for a long time.
you must understand...
I discovered her when she was 16.
I made her a star...
and I cannot let her be destroyed.
you made her a star?
Yes.
I directed all her early films.
there were three young directors who showed promise in those days...
D. W. Griffith...
Cecil B. DeMille...
and Max Von Mayerling.
and she's turned you into a servant.
it was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.
I could have continued my career.
only I found everything unendurable after she had left me.
you see...
I was her first husband.
you're here, Joe.
when did you come home?
Oh, Joe, where were you?
is it a woman?
I know it's a woman. Who is she?
why can't I ask you?
I must know.
what's the matter?
Betty, wake up. Why are you staring at me like that?
Oh, was I? I'm sorry.
what's wrong with you tonight?
what is it?
something came up. I don't want to talk about it.
why not?
I just don't.
what have you heard?
come on, let's have it.
is it about me?
there's no use running out on it.
let's face it, whatever it is.
I got a telegram from Artie.
from Artie?
what's wrong?
he Wants me to come on to Arizona.
he says it only costs two dollars to get married there.
it would kinda save us a honeymoon.
well, why don't you?
we can finish the script by Thursday.
stop crying. You're getting married. That's what you wanted.
I don't want it now.
why not? Don't you love Artie? - Of course I love him.
I always will.
I'm not in love with him anymore, that's all.
what happened?
you did.
it wasn't until I got back to that peculiar prison of mine...
that I started facing the facts.
there it was.
Betty Schaefer's future right in the palm of my hand.
Betty Schaefer, engaged to Artie Green...
as nice a guy as ever lived...
and she was in love with me.
me.
she was a fool not to sense there was something phony in my setup...
and I was a heel not to have told her.
but you just can't say those things to somebody you're crazy about.
maybe I'd never have to.
maybe I could get away with it, get away from Norma.
maybe I could wipe the whole nasty mess right out of my life.
Hello? Is this Gladstone 9-2-8-1?
may I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer?
she must be home by now.
here's that weird-sounding woman again.
well, what is this, anyway?
this is Betty Schaefer.
you must forgive me for calling you so late...
but I really feel it's my duty.
it's about Mr. Gillis. You do know Mr. Gillis.
exactly how much do you know about him?
do you know where he lives?
do you know how he lives?
do you know what he lives on?
who are you?
what do you want? What business is it of yours?
miss Schaefer...
I'm trying to do you a favor.
I'm trying to spare you a great deal of misery.
but you may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort.
I don't know what he's told you, but he does not live with relatives.
nor with friends, in the usual sense of the word.
well, ask him.
ask him again.
that's right, Betty. Ask me again.
this is Joe.
where are you? What is this all about?
or better yet, why don't you come out and see for yourself.
the address is 10086...
sunset Boulevard.
don't hate me, Joe.
I did it because I need you.
I need you as I've never needed you before.
look at me.
look at my hands. Look at my face.
look under my eyes.
how can I go back to work if I'm wasting away under this torment?
you don't know what I've been through these last weeks.
I bought myself a revolver. I did.
I stood in front of that mirror, but I couldn't make myself do it.
don't just stand there hating me!
shout at me!
strike me, but don't hate me!
say you don't hate me, Joe!
here's 10079, Connie.
it must be over there.
Betty, let me come along with you, please.
no, I'll be all right.
what are you gonna do, Joe? What are you gonna do?
it's all right, Max. I'll take it.
Hello, Betty.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.
is it something awful? - Come on in.
ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos?
that's from when they were making 18, 000 a week and no taxes.
careful of these tiles. They're slippery.
Valentino used to dance here.
is this where you live? - You bet.
whose house is it? - Hers.
Whose? - Just look around.
there's a lot of her spread about.
if you don't remember the face, you must've heard the name...
Norma Desmond?
that was Norma Desmond on the phone?
would you like a drink? There's always champagne on ice.
plenty of caviar.
why did she call me? - Jealous.
did you ever see so much junk?
she had the ceiling brought from Portugal.
and look at this.
her own movie theater.
I didn't come here to see a house.
what about Norma Desmond?
that's what I'm trying to tell you.
this is an enormous place.
eight master bedrooms.
a sunken tub in every bathroom.
there's a bowling alley in the cellar.
it's lonely here...
so she got herself a companion.
very simple setup.
older woman who's well-to-do.
younger man who's not doing too well.
can you figure it out yourself? - No.
I'll give you a few more clues.
No!
I haven't heard any of this.
I never got those phone calls, and I've never been in this house.
now get your things together and let's get out of here.
all my things?
all my 18 suits and my custom-made shoes...
and the six-dozen shirts and cuff links...
and the platinum key chains and the cigarette cases?
come on, Joe.
come on where?
back to a one-room apartment I can't pay for?
back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
if you love me, Joe...
look, sweetie, be practical.
I've got a good deal here.
a long-term contract with no options.
I like it that way.
maybe it's not very admirable.
well...
you and Artie can be admirable.
I can't look at you anymore, Joe.
how about looking for the exit?
this way, Betty.
good luck to you, Betty.
you can finish that script on the way to Arizona.
when you and Artie get back, if you two ever feel like taking a swim...
here's the pool.
thank you, darling.
thank you, Joe.
may I come in, Joe?
I've stopped crying.
I'm all right again.
tell me you're not cross.
tell me everything is just as it was, Joe.
what are you doing, Joe?
what are you doing?
I'm packing.
you're leaving me.
Yes, I am, Norma.
no, you're not.
Max! Max!
thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe...
and thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
the rest of the jewelry's in the top drawer.
it's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
and I'd take it in a second.
only it's too dressy for sitting behind a copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
these are nothing!
you can have anything you want. What is it you want?
money?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away.
I don't qualify for the job. Not anymore.
you can't go!
Max! Max!
I can't face life without you.
and you know I'm not afraid to die.
that's between you and yourself.
you think I made that up about the gun, don't you? All right.
see?
you didn't believe me.
now I suppose you don't think I have the courage.
Oh, sure, if it would make a good scene.
you don't care, do you?
but hundreds of thousands of people will care!
Oh, wake up, Norma. You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.
the audience left 20 years ago.
that's a lie! They still want me!
no, they don't!
what about DeMille?
he was trying to spare your feelings.
the studio only wanted to rent your car.
wanted what?
DeMille didn't have the heart to tell you.
none of us has had the heart.
that's a lie. They want me.
I get letters every day.
you tell her, Max.
do her that favor. Tell her there isn't going to be any picture.
there aren't any fan letters except the ones you write.
that isn't true!
Max!
Madame is the greatest star of them all.
I will take Mr. Gillis's bags to the car.
you heard him.
I'm a star.
Norma, you're a woman of 50. NoW groW up.
there's nothing tragic about being 50...
not unless you try to be 25.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
good-bye, Norma.
no one ever leaves a star.
that's what makes one a star.
stars are ageless...
aren't they?
well, this is where you came in.
back at that pool again...
the one I always wanted.
it's dawn now, and they must have photographed me a thousand times.
then they got some pruning hooks from the garden and fished me out...
ever so gently.
funny how gentle people get with you once you're dead.
they beached me like a harpooned baby whale...
and started to check the damage...
just for the record.
by this time the wholejoint was jumping...
cops, reporters, neighbors, passersby.
as much hoop-de-doo as we get in Los Angeles...
when they open a supermarket.
even the newsreel guys came roaring in.
here was an item everybody could have some fun with.
the heartless so-and-sos.
what would they do to Norma?
even if she got away with it in court...
crime of passion, temporary insanity...
those headlines would kill her.
forgotten Star a Slayer.
aging Actress.
yesterday's Glamour Queen.
coroner's office?
I want to speak to the coroner.
who's on this phone?
I am! Now get off. This is more important.
times city desk? Hedda Hopper speaking.
I'm talking from the bedroom of Norma Desmond.
don't bother with a rewrite. Take it direct.
ready?
as day breaks over the murder house...
Norma Desmond, famous star of yesteryear...
is in a state of complete mental shock.
a curtain of silence seems to have fallen around her.
she sits in the silken boudoir of her house on Sunset Boulevard...
was it a sudden quarrel?
did you ever have any trouble between you before?
if it was a quarrel, how come this gun was right there?
this guy... Where did you meet him for the first time?
where did he come from? Who is he?
did you hate him?
had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
was theft involved?
did you catch him stealing, or find he had stolen something?
newsreel men are here with the cameras.
tell them to go fly a kite. This is no time for cameras.
now, Miss Desmond, is there anything you want to tell us?
cameras?
what is it, Max?
the cameras have arrived.
they have?
tell Mr. DeMille I'll be on the set at once.
what is this?
well, it's one way to get her downstairs.
let's have the car right outside.
okay.
everything will be ready, Madame.
thank you, Max.
you'll pardon me, gentlemen...
but I must get ready for my scene.
what's happening up there? - Why did she do it?
is there a confession?
everything set up, gentlemen? - Just about.
lights ready? - All set.
quiet, everybody!
lights!
are you ready, Norma?
what is the scene?
where am I?
this is the staircase of the palace.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
down below...
they're waiting for the princess.
I'm ready.
all right.
cameras.
action!
so they were turning after all, those cameras.
life, which can be strangely merciful...
had taken pity on Norma Desmond.
the dream she had clung to so desperately...
had enfolded her.
I can't go on with the scene. I'm too happy.
Mr. DeMille, do you mind if I say a few words?
thank you.
I want to tell you all how happy I am to be back in the studio...
making a picture again!
you don't know how much I've missed all of you.
and I promise you I'll never desert you again.
because after Salome we'll make another picture...
and another picture!
you see, this is my life.
it always will be.
there's nothing else.
just us...
and the cameras...
and those wonderful people out there in the dark.
Joe's going to be okay.
she was everything to him.
Jack's going to step up.
he's a good man.
but he has never had to be a father before.
I don't think he understands Joe.
how long had she work there?
five years? I think it was six.
what do you think was in the coffin?
Jesus, shut up.
I was thinking how she died.
you guys weren't wondering that.
no, I'm eating macaroni salad.
I was wondering about that too.
I heard it crushed her completely.
steel beams.
those things weigh a ton.
literally.
I don't know how you guys can eat.
try the turkey and you'll discover how.
Lucy, down.
get out.
Joe.
have you seen Joe?
bet Joe's not going to want to do my movie anymore.
Why?
why do you think why?
the story is about the living dead.
his mum is not a zombie.
but she's dead, shit head.
it's troubled his heart pretty good. Told you.
get him out of here!
just wait a minute.
wait!
Jack!
Jack, just let me out!
get out!
get out!
hey Jack!
it was a mistake.
get out! Come on!
get in!
Joseph, I will be home soon.
Oh，my God. That was the longest day ever.
here. - What's this?
new scene. Check it out.
detective Hathaway has a wife now?
I don't know. I think it might make a better movie.
I need a better story line and production value.
Hey，guys. Martin...
it was the grosses one yet.
Oh，my god, shut up!
so who's going to play the wife? Jen?
no way. I told you what she did to my top pack.
what wife? - Alice Dainard.
I was returning that book on 'Codes and Ciphers'.
she was in the silent reading section.
and I asked her if she'll play Hathaway's wife.
wait. You talked to Alice Dainard, really?
you aren't suppose to talk at all in the silent reading section.
shut up. It's for silent reading.
she said 'yes'.
we're filming tonight and she's driving.
driving? Driving where?
that was a really good zombie murder.
but it's not a story yet.
all the kids that are entering this film festival, fifteen and sixteen years old, have better stories and casts and production value.
I've got nothing. - Charles, dinner.
I'm coming.
there is this article I want you to read this.
it explains everything about stories.
I just don't understand how the wife helps make it a story.
Jesus, what have I been explaining?
the scene we're filming tonight, where the wife's telling the detective that she cares for him, that she loves him.
I can't believe you talk to Alice Dainard.
Charles, come on, move it!
I'm coming!
and watch your head this time!
so when he investigates the zombie stuff, you feel something.
you don't want him to die because they love each other.
make sense?
Alice Dainard, that's awesome.
you're impossible. - Charles, now!
God mum! I'm coming!
midnight okay? Don't forget.
I won't forget.
read this.
it's not fair I cannot go to Wendy's.
every single person will be there except me.
well then, every single person and tell you how it was.
move the puzzle, get the napkins.
mum... - It's your turn to babysit.
why can't I switch with Charles?
maybe it's because you crushed Charles' top pack.
you ever think of that?
Oh，really, guess what? We're switching.
Oh，really? No, we're not.
okay, that's enough. - Charles, take this to the table.
Benji, time for dinner.
Hi，Joe.
Goodnight, Mrs Kaznyk.
take a seat. We have lots of food.
Oh，no, I'm okay, really. Thank you though.
see you tomorrow, Charles. - Later.
there's always a place for you，Joey.
you know that.
yes sir, thank you.
dad?
dad?
I'll be out in a minute.
six week program.
hands on training with college coaches.
you'll like it. I know I did.
I thought I was going to have this summer to myself.
things have obviously changed for us.
and it will be good for you to spend some time with kids who don't run around with cameras and monster make-up.
I have to help Charles finish his movie.
I have got nothing against your friends, I like your friends.
except for Cary who can't seem to stop lighting things on fire.
you'll like it there.
it's what we both need.
okay, it's time. Don't get caught. Over.
I won't. Over.
wait guys, people are turning into zombies because of the chemical Rago, right?
I don't see how the guy playing detective Hathaway could ask where the zombies are coming from.
well technically, Hathaway...
is that a rock?
Hey，guys look. Guys!
Hey，Alice.
Joe Lamb?
ya.
what the hell is he doing here?
make-up and sound's special effects.
he's the deputy's kid.
so what? - You knew that?
Charles, I don't have a license.
I can't drive with him.
you want Joe to stay back, I guess...
it's too late. He has seen me in the car right now!
you can trust me.
my dad will never know.
I won't tell him anything.
get in.
so I wrote a couple of new lines. Can I show you?
what? New lines?
Charles, do I have new lines? - It will all be great.
this is if you could cry in the scene.
can you do that?
no.
do you know the first place I would like to get my driving license?
newcastle, Pennsylvania.
wildest capital of the world.
guys, there's an electrical outlet right here!
Charles!
Charles，man, do I have new lines or not?
No! No!
guys, this is going to be great!
get the lights and camera set up from that end!
we'll shoot this direction first.
Joe, get the microphone and then make sure the new batteries are in the camera before you do the make-up.
I could afford two packs of cherry bombs and I made my own MAE.
do you want to see it?
your obsession with fireworks, and I'm saying this as a friend, concern me and my mother.
sweet heart, this is my job. I have no choice.
it's nothing you need to worry about.
what am I suppose to do? Go to Michigan with you?
Martin, I wrote a new line.
what? No.
what do you mean no? It's awesome.
do you mind?
no.
here...
there.
Thanks.
now, I'm not prepared.
look, it flows better.
honey, I love you.
I love you too.
see it flows. - I know.
but you keep changing things and making it more difficult for me.
my dad works at the mill.
could you close your eyes please?
ya.
so the scene is very emotional.
Alice,
Mrs. Hathaway doesn't really want her husband to keep investigating these murders.
ya, I know, we read it.
you got them, I'm just directing.
Martin, get in position.
you need to re-assure her.
wait. Do you know what 're-assure her' means?
ya, I think so.
okay, we're going to shoot on Alice's side first.
Okay，Preston, so a few seconds after I say 'action',
I want you to walk to the pay-phone.
you know, make the place look like it's busy.
Hello, hello... - I know what that looks like.
asshole.
can you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera?
guys, sorry，man.
Okay，you guys lets rehearse this.
but remember, save the real performance for when we're filming.
here we go, positions and...
action!
so I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it'll be safer if you left town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it, this case, these murders.
well, what am I suppose to do? Go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island is beautiful this time of the year.
sweet heart, this is mine job.
the dead coming back to life.
I think you're in danger.
I have no... I have no choice.
you do have a choice.
we all do.
John,
I've never ask you to stop.
I've never ask you to give up or walk away.
but I'm asking you now.
please.
for me.
don't go.
don't leave me.
I need to know this isn't the last time I'm going to see you.
just love you so much.
I love you too.
was that good?
ya, ya that was... great.
production value!
Cary, you popped film in the camera, right?
I didn't put it in. - What?
put it in!
Joe, get the microphone! Go! Go! Go!
come on, get that tripod set up!
Preston, in position! - I will!
martin you know your lines! Cary get the camera ready!
I hope we don't miss it.
shut up! I am trying!
position, position! Ready!
start filming. Be extra loud when the train passes by.
here we go. And 'Action'!
look, I'm going to stay here and investigate.
I think it'll safer if you left town for a couple of days.
John, I don't like it.
this case, these murders.
what do you want me to do? Go to Michigan with you?
Mackinac Island is beautiful this time of the year.
the dead coming back to life.
I think you're in danger!
I don't have a choice!
you do have a choice!
we all do!
John, I've never ask you to stop!
I've never ask you to give up or walk away!
but I am asking you now!
please, for me. Just don't go!
just don't go back. Don't leave me!
I need to know this isn't the last time I'm going to see you!
I love you so much! - I love you too!
guys watch out!
Joe, what the hell...
Oh，my God! - Run!
Oh，my God!
holy shit!
go! Go! Go!
Alice!
Joe let's go! We got to go!
keep going!
are we alive!
run!
I don't want to die!
guys.
I'm okay.
Martin, you okay?
though I think I'm having a heart attack.
and I have a scrape.
Joe! Oh，my God.
guys, did you see all the explosions?
you guys seen Alice?
Joe, so unbelievable!
why is this happening?
Martin, it's going to be okay.
no, it's not，dude.
shit!
what's all that blood?
what's the blood?
someone got hurt?
Joe, what are you doing? Joe, stop!
it's mine fake blood. It's fake.
guys.
come here, what are these things?
no one cares.
look around you.
they look like white Rubik cubes or something.
I don't think that's what they are.
maybe white metals, or something.
there's like a billion of them.
what's going on?
Martin, it's going to be okay, alright. - Are you serious?
guys, get up here. You can see everything from up here.
Joe.
according to my uncle Jeff, an accident like this is exceptionally rare.
it wasn't an accident.
what?
there was truck on the train track.
are you serious? Like driving on the tracks?
there.
Oh，my Gosh.
how could a pick-up truck derail a train? That's impossible.
obviously it isn't.
oh，shit!
Oh，my God. I know that truck.
guys.
is that him? - Yes, it's him.
who? - Yes it is, for sure.
who is it?
dr Woodward.
dr Woodward?
biology.
honours, Biology. Wow!
I am not in his class.
we know. - Shut up, Cary.
remember when old man Woodward told your electronic football?
Yes, he put it in the dungeon and never gave it back.
dungeon?
that trailer where Woodward keeps in the school's parking lot.
dr Woodward?
dr Woodward?
map of the Contiguous United States.
what's the writing?
date and time.
what's this line?
the schedule for the train.
who are you?
dr Woodward, it's me,
Charles Kaznyk, fourth period.
you've been in an accident. You're going to be okay.
oh，shit!
swear... I will kill you.
do not speak of this.
or else, you...
and your parents...
will die.
guys look.
we shouldn't be here. - Go!
come on! Let's get out of here!
guys, come on!
guys, come on!
hurry up! Let's go! Let's go!
get in!
did you get the plate?
I didn't get the plate. Did you get it?
Oh，God! That was insane!
he had a gun! I've never seen a gun!
my heart is pounding!
that train could have kill us!
are you okay?
no. - Oh shit, my camera's like shattered now!
guys, I've never had a teacher aiming a gun at me!
how can I drive when everyone's yelling?
guys, keep it down.
you will die, your parents will die.
guys, that's not good information.
shit, the focus ring just fell off!
no one cares about your camera!
guys, am I the only one shaking?
I'm crying.
we can't tell anyone we were there.
my dad can't find out I took his car.
you guys hear me?
it's okay. We're not saying anything to anyone.
guys, we are not saying anything, are we?
no.
see?
no one is going to know.
we'll sink it here.
Joe.
thank you.
I never should have done this.
Joe? Joe, wake up.
make sure you let Lucy out, alright? - I will.
what are you going to do?
are you going to be at Charles' today?
Yes, I'll be with Charles.
alright, I'm heading in. There's something I got to deal with.
don't forget to get the Oar. Alright? - I won't.
Oh, come on.
no, you're not wearing that.
no one in the house is wearing that.
Oh，really. Compared to Debbie, these are long.
listen to your mother.
so I can't go to Wendy's party over the shorts?
not fair!
Jennifer, we're not in Africa.
do we have anymore English muffins?
why don't you get off and check?
Hey, tell the twins to stop. - I can't.
good morning，Joe. - Good morning Mr. Kaznyk.
hi Joe, did you hear about the train crash?
no. - It's on the news.
...use local crews, instead opting to use military personnel, which to this reporter, only adds to the mystery.
of course we have much more to the story as it develops.
coming to you live from Montgomery County.
do you believe this?
no.
it's on the news, that means it's real.
I know.
dr Thomas Woodward is still being treated by air force personnel after last night's train derailment.
Woodward apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his pick-up truck, which was hit by the speeding train.
how about you clean it up?
that would be a great help, thank you so much.
...largest of accident in Ohio history.
condition of Woodward who is currently teaching in Middle School for the past three years...
looks like a disaster movie, doesn't it?
my God.
Joe, you're so awesome.
what?
we can use it, we can film it.
you want to go back?
Oh shit, that's mint. - Really?
you're a total brain. We got to get the camera fixed.
film developed from last night. - Okay.
I am going to steal some money from my mum.
if any of the footage is useable from last night, that means we need Alice to play the wife again.
Oh，yes, I thought she was really good.
Yes, she was mint but she's never going to do it.
I think she will.
there's no way. You heard what she said.
but that's before the new scenes, right?
you honestly think she cares about the scenes?
she was totally vague.
Yes, she was. We all were.
lens is cracked, focus ring broke.
do you think it's fixable?
I guess it is cheaper to get a new one.
the camera is busted man. It's over.
we can use my dad's camera. It's got slow...
Hello?
Hey，Alice, it's Joe Lamb.
Hi.
so we have some new scenes for the movie, and Charles and I are hoping you'll be in them.
Oh, no. I'm done with that.
I need this film developed as soon as possible. Can you do it overnight?
asshole, no one can do it overnight.
you want to buy some pot?
no, no, thank you.
well, what is the fastest you can do?
I can make it a rush.
and get your film back in three days.
and what is your sister up to?
the hot one, not the other one.
I don't know.
watching the crash on the news.
Yes, I saw it.
I should go.
wait, hold on. I'll come over, - I'll bring the scenes. - No, no!
I'll be right there. It's a good idea.
I don't care what Charles wants.
I said 'no' on the phone.
I know you totally did. I know that's true but...
now you are at my house.
I am, which...
I don't understand why you guys keep working on that stupid movie.
you should go.
what's this?
he was just inviting me to a party.
good morning, Mr. Dainard.
she's not going to your party.
Yes，sir.
you, get out of here.
you go home and you don't come back here!
I don't want to see you.
Ally，come inside.
ally, I'm in the kitchen.
I'll do it.
what?
cut! That was mint!
Oh，my God, with the train, so good.
Joe, reload the cap gun. - Okay.
we'll shoot another angle next.
Alice that was mint.
martin go over faster next time.
I'll try Charles. I was just crying out last night man.
guys, did it really look good?
you look awesome.
what do you think happened?
you mean why he crashed the train?
I just got a horrible feeling.
dude, what are you doing?
that whole thing is an Air Force train.
what?
I make models, like plastic ones.
you know, go home, paint them.
and he's not embarrassed by that.
whose talking - Math camp.
Thanks.
can I have some coffee please? Cream on the side.
he's so sophisticated.
shut up. I like coffee.
no one likes coffee.
air Force trains, even the models have these hooks.
Oh, they do.
for when the trains are loaded on the transport ships.
every car on that crash had...
Joe, you stop talking about it alright?
wait guys.
am I the only guy who doesn't understand any of this means?
probably 'Smartin'. - Cary，shut up.
I don't like it when you call me that.
I'm sorry 'Smartin'. Let's just go cry about it.
dr Woodward had that map.
he drove onto the train tracks.
maybe there was something he wanted to destroy.
you guys should shut up!
maybe he was sick of living and wanted to kill himself.
dumb idea.
he had a gun. Why not use that?
there are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide.
pills, hanging, ...- Hey, Pussy!
stop taking the fries away!
I order these for a reason.
excuse me.
can we have another order of fries because my friend here is fat?
funny chomper, at least I don't have to use a booster seat.
you can jump from a building.
or fall down some stairs.
Oh, that's not really effective. Do you think?
if this is the Air Force, what would the Air Force have on the train?
Jesus, shut up about it!
you heard what old man Woodward said.
we can't talk about this. Joe, seriously.
do you really want to take a chance that something could happen to your dad too?
it's loaded, move out! - Yes, sir.
Yes, Deputy, I'm told this crash has caused the whole massive confusion.
well, as you can expect, the local authorities are trying to figure out just what has happened as well as how to help.
it's all under control. It'll be a very fast clean up.
Colonel, is there anything I should know of, Sir?
not that I can think of, Deputy.
I understand you've concerns about our cargo.
I like to see that manifest, yes.
well, that's not going to be possible.
Colonel, I've a lot of people in my town who're going to want to know what's taking place.
which town is that?
Lillian...
deputy, if you're asking me if there's any dangerous property on board this train, - I can assure you that the answer is 'no'.
Colonel!
excuse me.
they gave me the round around for two hours before they allow me to talk to anyone.
I'll say they had their hands full, Jack.
Nelec, the Colonel refused to show the manifest,
he told me they are carrying mostly aeroplane parts. I don't buy that.
it's Air Force, Jack.
the aeroplane parts ought to make sense.
sheriff, I'm telling you there's something else going on.
they taking moulds of tire tracks.
why would they be doing that?
who would they be looking for?
and they are packaging these weird little cubes into these crates.
weird little cubes, huh? - They load them on these red trucks, there are dozens of them!
sheriff, I think you need to check it out.
and I think you need to take a break.
Jack, I've been telling you this since Elizabeth.
you are a good Deputy.
but you need to take a vacation.
go home.
take off your uniform. Go fishing.
give your son a hug.
Hey，Breen, I'm not sure Edie's paying you to listen to the radio!
Breen!
Hey, Sheriff.
what's that?
walkman.
it's like a stereo.
plays on cassette tapes.
you want to try it?
I don't think so.
kids walk around with their own stereos, just what we need.
it's slippery slope, my friend.
Yes，sir.
sheriff?
sheriff?
you know what, in scene...
where did you learn to do this?
mostly the Dick Smith's "Monsters Make-up" Paint book.
Hey，Joe, we need more footage of the train crash.
obviously.
you know that train model you've just made?
Yap, your cargo train.
I want to blow it up and film it.
let me blow it up.
ya, sure. - Fantastic!
it's fine. They can blow it up.
I don't care.
do you want to see it?
the train, my train model?
the train I made.
dude, that's bitching man...
that's like the third time it has happened.
so how am I suppose to be a zombie?
pretty much be a lifeless ghoul, no soul, dead eyes... scary.
did you ever have Miss Mullen? - For English?
Yes!
I like her, but 'hungry for human flesh', like she wants to turn somebody into a zombie.
cause that's how zombies do.
my God, that's really good.
not bad.
Really?
really.
careful, there was a gas spill.
I don't even know how much fuel I've lost.
you don't seem to be asking very many questions!
give the man sometime, Mr. Blakely.
he's only a Deputy, he's not the Sheriff.
I think this is most likely a bear attack.
security cameras showed nothing.
Vicky, you heard from Sheriff Pruitt this morning?
negative, still no word.
Vicky, you need to update and send a CS unit out to Edie's, and you put an APB out on the Sheriff and Breen Haskell and send units over to their houses immediately.
you copy all that?
copy, and Jack, we're getting a lot of unusual calls.
what kind of unusual calls?
I've never seen this kind of things before!
what the hell am I suppose to do?
the insurance company guys thought I was joking with them!
look at my Bonneville over here.
they don't have the wrench to take that out.
having problems with anyone lately, Izzy?
I was thinking you should talk to Louis Dainard.
I didn't help him out with financing last year, and I wouldn't be surprised if this is some sort of sick retribution.
my generator's missing...
my dog is gone... disappeared.
maybe you should file a report. I'll have someone come out and take care of each one of you, okay?
Lucy!
Lucy!
I have four guys on missing cases.
people don't feel safe around here. And you know why?
because they are not!
the Air Force doesn't answer a damn question.
they've got trucks over at Woodward's house.
Ben heard they're looking for Woodward's research.
research?
one of the soldier on the truck, he had like a scanner in his hand.
like a Geiger counter.
they're saying it's just a clean up at the crash site, but they're taking moulds of tire tracks.
that means they're looking for someone. What does that means?
have you seen Lucy anywhere?
no, it certainly will be 'around somewhere.
no, I'm sure she's around somewhere.
I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you.
Oh! I ate those.
sorry, kid.
no problem. I'll find something.
pick that up, will you?
Vicky, do you have power down at the station?
on and off. The whole County is in the dark.
do me a favour and get water and power up right now, will you?
so the Air Force is looking for a car.
Alice's dad car.
they are taking tire prints from the crash site, over.
I don't want to hear about it.
that's what I've been talking about.
they could be monitoring us right now.
Jesus, shut up!
over.
the military is at Woodward's house looking for his research.
whatever that means?
do not freak out on me and be a dick.
are you going to come and help me or not?
I need you to make Alice's zombie again.
okay, I'll do the makeup.
over.
cables are gone. All the posts are empty.
same thing over here in Rose Hill.
somebody took the damn wires down.
holy shit!
rooney, you got anything in Lillian?
rooney, you copy?
we got a half mile of copper missing.
lines are back up with M-38.
truck 14, Rooney's out of the junkyard.
I'll give you an update when I hear back.
I want to know who took them.
20 microwaves.
gone!
from my inventory.
everywhere you look things are going missing.
we've got trains crashing, people vanishing.
Belmont County is without power.
you know what this feels like to me?
this feels like a "Russian invasion."
I don't think the Russian has anything to do with what's going on in the town.
but I'm calling a curfew...
unless you can tell me who's been messing with our stuffs.
I say it's the Soviets.
and I think，Jack, we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
we've got good people working on that.
Mr. McCandless.
since Wednesday morning, my ham-radio was a mess.
some frequencies, which I like scan,
I'm hearing military chatter.
but it is distorted. And I don't know what it is.
have you heard that?
Mr. McCandless, can I have a word with you in private, please?
it was like having my radio hijacked.
I'm sure it was very annoying.
you don't know those frequencies off hand do you?
Oh, sure I do.
Danny, why don't you get in touch with Vicky.
Hey，Dave, have you seen Milner?
No，sir, I haven't.
deputy, something crawled by my garage!
it's paw is almost a foot!
Tom! Have you seen Milner?
have you try his office?
I try to his office.
what are you doing about the power? We've been off for two days!
Hey，Rosko!
Rosko, I need you to get everybody here we have tuned to those frequencies, understand?
no.
Hey，Milner, don't you have a radio scanner with a descrambler?
voice? I have it at home.
whatever. Get it.
bring it down here and set it up. Wouldn't you please?
Jack, what is this?
I think the Air Force is using on the same channels.
he was at my house yesterday morning. Are you aware of that?
we brought him in for the car lots and other stuffs, he's clean.
I would appreciate it if you'd inform your son that my house is off limits.
and so is my daughter.
I think the makeup was better yesterday.
no, it's good.
I think it looks good.
I should have cleaned up my room.
did you make all these models?
Yes. Yes, that one is "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
we watch that one on TV...
this is the train I wanted to destroy.
looks real.
it looks so old.
Yes, it's dry brush technique.
it's when there's a coat of paint,
and then you put something like...
euro grey over it. - Euro grey?
Oh，yes, there's like 14 different greys. It gets crazy.
what was that necklace?
the one you were holding at the train crash.
was it your mom's?
my dad gave it to her the day I was born.
she wears it all the time.
or used to.
it was bad how she die and...
but my dad got it back.
guys! What the hell? No one knew where you were.
we were here.
you got to play the soldier!
I thought you were calling Evan.
Evan blew us off. He is a pussy.
excuse me.
it's okay.
you got to do it. You're the only one.
what do you mean they found my dog in Brookville?
that's another county over.
Lucy, that's where she is.
we have more than 30 calls from people who found local dogs, but the thing is the calls coming in weren't local.
like they all just...
ran away in every direction.
this isn't like her. She doesn't disappear.
okay, calm down. Just tell what she looks like.
she's got dark hair and rollers. You know what rollers are?
Yes, I know what rollers are.
hang on.
it's definitely Air Force.
it's Air Force. But what does it mean?
why are they transmitting on these frequencies?
maybe it's not even Air Force.
I bet you five bucks it's Air Force. - Five Bucks?
we're going to need you to prepare for Operation "Walking Distance."
what did he say? Operation, what?
"walking Distance."
what's this? He worked at Romero Chemical.
found out some things the company was doing.
and after what you told me last night at the bar.
I thought you should know.
are we going to be in trouble for being here?
production value.
stop talking about production value.
air Force is going to kill us!
don't cover my mouth!
we just make this discovery today.
you understand this is Top Secret. - Of course.
I would never have given this information, unless we had worked together in Vietnam.
those were hard times... - We better not talk about it.
understood.
you're a good friend. - You too.
nothing so far. - How much more is there?
about 6 more boxes in a basement. - A lot more tax returns.
it's here somewhere, we'll find it.
if not, Woodward will tell us where he is.
what the hell is that?
Joe. - Hey，Mr. Lamb.
get in the car.
Mr. Lamb that's your camera but technically that's my film.
what the hell.
is it me?
I would like to help you out deputy,
I really would but we operate on a need to know basis.
why are your trucks sweeping the town?
we will be out of here by shortly.
then I'm sure you won't mind me contacting D. C. talk to some friends about "Walking distance."
I will do it that way.
deputy.
let's talk.
just not here.
this is new, all of this, for the both of us.
dealing with anything.
just us.
so I'm going to make this as simple and clear as I can.
you are not friends with Alice Dainard.
when I say "no," I don't mean maybe.
I don't mean 'yes'.
I mean 'no'.
I've known Louis Dainard for a lot of years.
he's been nothing but trouble.
your mother used to say he's not such a bad guy.
he just need a chance, that he was sad.
well, I tried to be good to him.
Well，I can't. Not anymore.
I will not allow him or his daughter in this house.
I will not allow you to spend time with her doing projects or whatever it is that you do, that's it!
I hope we are clear on that.
we're not clear.
what did you say?
we're not clear!
you and I are not clear about anything!
we couldn't be less clear! - Joseph...
just because mum die doesn't mean that you know anything about me.
you don't!
you don't know anything about Alice either.
she's kind... - We are not going to have this discussion...
she's nice to me! - I don't care what she is!
her father is an irresponsible selfish son of a bitch!
you listen to me.
I've got 12 thousand people in this town who are scared out of their mind.
and they got one person to rely on.
it used to be someone else but now it's just me.
1942. 5.26-1979. 2.3
here we go. Lights on.
deputy, drop your weapons. Put your hands on the car.
I'm here to see the Colonel Nelec.
he told me to meet him here.
you're on military arrest, drop your weapons!
where Nelec?
I don't want any more trouble, do you?
we've been going through your belongings.
looking for evidence.
what you knew? How you knew it?
who else might know?
I remember you on the lab.
and I recall we didn't always see eye-to-eye, but that is no excuse for doing what you did here.
so in the spirit of moving forward, and avoiding more trouble.
why don't you just tell me where you put your research and who else knows about it?
I know you had someone document the crash that night.
tell me who that was and I'll help you.
I swear to God on my mother's life, if you help us now, we will take care of you.
I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec.
when you take care of people. - It is mine. He is mine!
I'm going to beat him and catch him.
he is in me, you know.
as I am in him.
so...
when you see him next, as I'm sure you will,
I'll be watching you too.
are you... were you sleeping?
before... earlier... no.
are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
you want to come in? - Yes.
power still out.
the room is still messy.
I couldn't sleep.
I was thinking...
I want to tell you something before tomorrow.
don't let Charles blow up your train.
I don't think it is right.
I know he is your friend.
he's so bossy.
I have known him since kindergarten.
he's really nice.
you should know he gets what he wants.
I mean, who always get what they want?
I know I don't know you at all.
even though, I try to feel like I do.
do you not... feel like that?
no, I totally do.
I'm just kind of...
in shock at this entire conversation.
power is back.
no, no, keep it.
it's... it's so weird.
watching her like this.
as if she's still here.
she used to look at me this way.
like really look.
and I just knew I was there.
like I existed.
he drank that morning.
my dad.
he missed his shift.
your mother took it for him.
the day of the accident.
he...
he wishes...
I know he wishes it was him instead of her.
sometimes I do too.
don't say that.
he's your father.
is this normal?
no, this is new.
want to tell me where you were?
or should I tell you?
sit down.
I should go to bed.
I want to talk with you, I said sit down.
I don't want to sit down.
Bingo!
be just like your mother and leave.
dad.
ahead, go!
go!
Alice!
wait!
ally, I'm sorry!
Alice!
Alice!
ally!
ally!
fire alight at 0500 hours.
operation "Walking Distance" is in effect.
T-minus 4 hours to evacuation.
why are you not reacting?
that thing went through my wall!
I told you not to pick it up in the first place.
what are you so angry about?
that I'm not going to let you blow up my train?
that's part of it!
just a part!
Hey, tell your sister that Donnie from Alison's broke up with Karen.
that should end about a week ago.
what's your problem?
my whole movie is a disaster because of you.
I know my dad's been a turkey.
whatever!
we're still going to finish your movie!
it is not about the movie!
what are you talking about? Of course it is!
just forget it!
Why? There's nothing wrong!
I can get the camera back. I know where my dad put it.
we can still make it festival.
it's not about the movie.
then what is it about?
you don't get it, do you?
it's obvious!
what's obvious? - God, you're a dumb ass!
the night of the crash, you started getting all weird.
what are you talking about? - Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden
your movie was over. That's what you said.
you were upset! - Oh，my God.
I gave you my camera. I helped you!
don't pretend like you did this for me!
you didn't do this for me, and you know it!
this was never about me. This was always about Alice!
well, you were the one who wanted the wife in the movie.
not so you could fall in love with her.
what do you care what I think about Alice any way?
cause I like her!
that's why I asked her to do this thing in the first place.
so that I could get to know her, not you!
you like Alice Dainard?
you are such an idiot!
shit!
all that smoke.
we can't use this.
you won't even let me blow up your train.
this thing is bogus.
we could make another train blow up.
I do like her.
sorry about that. - Shut up!
it's okay.
it doesn't even bother me.
she likes you too.
that's what really bothers me.
I know it sounds stupid. Why would she ever like me?
I haven't lean out yet. Doctor says it's going to happen.
I don't know, everything is just so bogus.
Charles...
Joe, what the hell?
what is that?
Mr. Harkin, what's going on?
evacuation! The fire!
being evacuated due to a wild fire that is raging out of control, and threatening to reach the Lillian Chemical plant.
please take your essential items only.
if you drive your vehicle, follow the caravan to the evacuation center.
please remain calm.
sir, the town is sealed off.
no one is allowed in.
Charles!
excuse me.
Charles, thank god!
I went back to the house but you were gone.
Yes, they put us on the bus.
Hey, sweety.
I'm going to find my dad.
you're going to tell him about that too.
come back if you can't find him!
Mr. Dainard? It's Joe Lamb.
I know you don't like me. I'm sorry about that, but...
I am looking for my dad.
they took her!
they took Alice! - What?
I saw it.
it was big and...
I don't know what... It was something...
I've never... I've never seen...
no one believed me. They just gave me pills...
no one believes me.
I believe you.
that thing took her? - We have to go back in town!
to find Alice. To find her. Come on，guys!
dudes, she's dead! Alice is dead! - Don't even say that!
first of all, I want to live, okay?
Joe, what do you actually expect us to do, man?
town is closed. We're not allowed to go back!
look, I have an idea.
I'm going whether or not you're coming, which I really hope you do.
come on，guys! I've 6 explosives...
we can fire and blow it to shit!
as if I'm going to help you?
do this for me...
I'll baby-sit the twins every single Wendy's stupid party.
I'm not shitting you. You can't ask me any questions, and you can't tell anyone.
I'm serious. Nobody!
does it have to be him? - Yes or no, you ugly freak.
I'm about to rescind the offer.
this whole evacuation is really freaking me out.
making me re-grade my priorities.
I saw you over here and I thought we could kick back.
we totally could.
asked Charles about you, he said you're a great guy.
I totally am.
will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favour?
there're rules to being in my car, okay?
where the hell are we going anyway?
we're going to the school and open the caravan Woodward has in the parking lot. I bet that - I bet that's where he's keeping his research. - What research?
we're going to learn everything we can about that thing, so that we can find it and that's how we're going to save Alice.
dorks! No shoes on my upholstery!
and no one touches my CB. You got it?
what if there're padlocks on the door?
we're going to the school.
since when this one becomes the boss? - I don't know.
I got to take a leak!
what am I suppose to do? Piss in here?
thanks for the hospitality.
am I going alone or you're going to end up coming with...
if the aircraft has already searched Woodward's house, wouldn't they search the whole school too?
Yeah, I mean I was thinking about that too. - No kidding.
maybe his room but not the dungeon.
Woodward's has... - Shut up!
what kind of music does she like, your sister?
I don't care, disco I guess.
I can get back to disco.
we shouldn't take River Road. They put a roadblock up.
dork, I saw it. Observe.
so what, I wait here like a douche?
Yes, thank you so much for doing this.
do you have a tire iron?
Joe! Let me try! Joe, let me try.
God, I hope my electronic football is in there!
Joe, it's impossible, man - There is no way we can do this! - What are you doing, Martin?
these things are made by a bank vault, like a safe.
professional robbers can't even get in through these things!
they are so strong...
I loosen it for you.
guys. All these junks?
he's got movies in here.
I can't believe we're breaking into the school.
who does that?
nobody does that! Aliens do that!
Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged, from Nellie Air Force base in 1963.
because of subversive conduct. Whatever that is...
Charles, check it out. It's old man Woodward.
back when he's like middle aged man Woodward.
they've been tracking this thing seen 1958.
it's not weird, it's freaking.
what is this?
it says "April 8, 1963 incident."
I don't know.
Cary! - What?
we have to find this thing! Come on!
OK, sorry!
told them that this creature is much more sophisticated than any of us.
that his species is predominantly "subterranean."
Subterranean? - And to have it treated without...
compassion or respect.
I explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship.
a craft made up of those cubes - of complex shape-shifting alloys. - Oh, shit!
remarkable material that we will never fully understand.
he has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in '58.
but instead of giving him the help he needs, we held him as a prisoner.
guys, it's Dr. Woodward. - He has been restrained and experimented upon, biopsied and tortured by Nelec.
through pain and lack of compassion we have taught him to hate us all.
we have turned him into an enemy.
I told them I knew these things because he made contact with me.
that he made a psychic connection by touch.
Oh, my god! Jesus.
what's that thing? - What the hell...
I can't watch this!
the moment he made contact I understood him.
and he, me.
what I know is that if we don't change this and begin helping him, we will all pay the price.
but Nelec wouldn't listen.
he wasn't trying to kill it.
he had me discharged.
he was trying to help him escape.
but I won't give up.
I'll do everything within my power...
Oh, my god! - Guys, hear that?
... help him rebuild that ship...
we've positive ID here. Just a bunch of kids.
Oh, shit.
search them. Let me see that.
I bought those and made it myself.
Jesus, Cary, shut up!
you're the Deputy's boy.
no.
move out!
come on.
shit, oh，shit!
breaker, breaker, requesting police backup.
breaker 1-9, is this the police channel?
staff Sergeant. - Hi, how are you doing?
Hey, Mr. Lamb.
Rosko.
Hey. Where the hell have you been? What are you wearing?
come here!
the Air Force set that fire.
they want the town empty for some reason.
the whole operation, the military operation, evacuation, everything, it's all bad.
we need to find out... - Did you hear about Joe?
look, dispatch just got a call from Citizen Band.
Joe and some of his friends.
they were grabbed by military personnel at Middle School.
Preston, you tell me everything and I won't throw you in jail.
Yes, sir.
but I think you should look at this first.
Mr. Sergeant, dust off 03 is 20 minutes out.
what's going to happen to us?
I think we're going to die.
shut up, man! They won't do that.
I'm not kidding, I think they're going to kill us.
they are not going to kill us. You know why?
Why? - 'Cause we were just...
hold on!
hold on!
is that the same thing from the train?
why are we stopping?
contact with the precious cargo!
driver, do you see anything out there?
no, sir, nothing!
what's that gun?
sako Bolt Action 30W-6...
okay, we get it.
those aren't bullets. He's loading tracking darts.
here, tag it.
Yes, sir.
open the door!
don't they give up this.
sir, is there a particular area that you want me to shoot?
help!
do something now!
where are the fire powers?
there's a monster out there, Joe! - Where the hell is it?
I got it, sir!
guys, the seat-belt is killing me! Come on!
this is Nelec. Use the big guns!
whatever happens to me, do not let it...
Joe, open it! - Open the door!
it's bolted!
please, open it! - Where are the keys?
help me, my leg's stuck!
please, sir, open the door. Please, open the door!
another one dead!
guys, there's broken glass.
Martin, let me get up on your shoulders! Come on.
go, go! Get up!
here we go. Come on, Joe!
come on, you all!
you can do it, Joe! Let's go!
Joe, you break the glass! - Come on.
come on. We got to go.
come on，guys, hurry!
we've got some questions for you. Come on!
is she dead? - Just come with us.
Hey, fellows.
I got orders from Colonel Nelec to personally deliver this man back to base.
he's all yours, Staff Sgt.
let's go. - What are you doing?
where are we going?
to find our kids.
guys, guys! I found them.
hey guys, I found my firecrackers!
Congratulations! - Look guys, they're coming back.
I think we should go! Come on!
guys, come on!
look.
you dorks are alive! I thought...
what the fuck... - Donnie, Donnie...
we need a ride into town.
okay, but just so you know, I'm massively stoned right now.
do you want me to drive?
guys, what was that?
sound like gun shots. - Joe, where are we going?
I saw something in the cemetery.
Woodward said it was subterranean.
I think I know where it is.
what the hell is that? Turn the damn car!
Joe, turn the car around - I can't 'cause the tank's behind me!
guys, we have to run! Donnie, Donnie, wake up!
he's too stoned! - Drugs are so bad!
why are they firing?
come on!
it's crazy, what is going on?
sir, the weapons are misfiring! All of them!
Surface-to-air, radar, it's a mess out here, sir.
run! Come on!
go, Cary, go!
Jesus!
what the hell?
come on guys, move!
did you guys see the explosions?
they were huge!
Oh, my god!
whose house is this?
it's Kathy's. I got it of the fridge.
Kathy? I know her.
Charles, what are you drinking, dude? It's not yours!
I'm thirsty! I'm in a war zone!
guys, come on, let's go! - Where are we going?
to the cemetery...
guys, what happen to my legs? They hurt!
Oh，shit, Martin, you got a bone sticking out your leg!
Joe, give me that thing of the...
I got to go find Alice! You guys stay here with Martin!
you going to be okay without me?
Yes!
I've got to go save the girl! - Go on, Cary! Shut up!
come on!
it hurts. Joe.
Jesus, Martin, we haven't done it yet!
just follow me.
I've been following you for the last five blocks.
what are we doing here?
come on, get these doors. Help me.
help you with what?
we've to get inside.
okay, for what?
I'll tell you in a second.
why is there dirt on these windows?
at three, push.
one, two, three!
this is scary.
you got any sparklers in there?
are you kidding me?
Alice is down there.
I came to your house that day to tell you that I never meant to hurt anyone.
I swear to God.
I'm sorry, Jack.
about what happened to your wife.
it was an accident.
it was an accident.
Joe, I do not understand...
this way.
it's Sheriff Pruitt. - I know, Cary, look.
there are bodies everywhere.
what is this? - Water from the water tower, look!
she got to be here. She got to be here.
it's eating a person.
she's here. Oh，my god, she's here.
Cary, we need to use your firecrackers.
I don't think that is going to hurt him, Joe.
there's other tunnels. - So?
I need you to make noise.
right here in 2 minutes.
make it loud and make it last.
use your sparklers.
make sure you're gone when it blows.
you can't be here. You got to run!
where are you going?
come on, Cary.
Alice, please, wake up.
Alice, Alice.
please, come on, wake up! Alice!
you're alive! You're alive! You're alive!
are you okay? Can you hear me?
what is this?
what are you doing here?
I'm just doing the best I can to save you.
how did you know?
your dad, he told me.
he was worried. He's flipping up.
Really? - We have to move.
excuse me.
where are we?
I left my bag in the car and when I...
he has been locked up for years.
he's terrified and hungry, and he just wants to go home.
when he touched, I knew.
I need you help me get the sheriff down.
follow me this way. I'll get us out of here. - Sheriff...
we came down... - Don't argue with me!
you just follow me!
come on，kids, just go with the Sheriff.
this way.
Joe!
I told you to get out. What are you doing here?
I just lost the way out, I tried.
Hey, Alice, welcome back.
Hey! Come on, we got to get out of here now!
she's gone! It took her!
I don't want to be next!
go!
you don't want to be here! Go!
Joe, what are you doing?
what the hell is he doing?
we understand!
but not everyone is bad.
I know bad things happen.
bad things happen.
but you can still live.
you can still live.
okay, wait a minute.
what?
look Out! Get down! Get down!
what is he doing?
he's making a model.
I got you.
I got you.
why would I be bleeding? - It's fucking blood, man.
were you dancing with some chick in there?
Yeah, so? - It's blood.
dude, that's not funny. - It's blood, dude.
but why would I be bleeding? Why the fuck would I be bl...?
dude, why would there be bl...?
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. I'm gonna fucking throw up.
someone perioded on my fucking leg?
Oh, shit. - What the fuck do I do?
I've never before seen that in my life!
this is so disgusting.
Yes, it is. - I'm gonna go get Bill.
he's gotta check this shit out. - Fuck, yeah.
no. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill! Bill has nothing to do with this!
Hey, calm down. Let me get a picture of that real quick.
no, you can't have a picture!
dude, stop! - Bill, Bill! Check it out!
this kid's got period blood on his slacks.
it's Merlot. That's what you don't get.
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's got period blood on his pants!
please stop. - God, man, let me see.
Oh, my God, that's a fucking man-gina, man.
do you need a tampon? I could-- - wait, wait. I have one! I have one!
Yeah, right? I don't know.
I gotta wash this off. Is this the line? - What does it look like?
fuck me, right?
"yeah, I'm McLovin. I'd like to buy some..."
shit.
rewind, rewind. - Rewind it. Yeah!
so hot. Let's see it again.
your legs lifted off the ground. - That is bona fide badass, man.
you gotta keep that tape, McLovin. It is badass.
it really is. - Really?
well, don't you guys, need it for, like, evidence or...?
the only thing that's evidence of is you can take a hit like a champ.
seriously. Take that.
are there any ladies we'd like to show this tape to?
no. You don't wanna meet a chick in a bar, man. Seriously.
that was a turning point in my life, when I realized that.
you gotta go to other places. You gotta go to a spin class, a farmers' market...
...pumpkin patch, given the time of year.
just somewhere social, non-threatening.
you know, something like that. - Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.
Yeah, I shot her in the neck. And we just... .
and we just hit it off, you know.
my first wife-- who is a whore, by the way.
where do you think I met her?
a bar. A bar.
it was this bar. - It was this bar.
Yeah, it was this bar.
bought her a Binion's, complimented her on her tote bag...
...and next thing I know, she's putting her mouth around the tip of my penis.
you don't have to tell me that.
right in there. - She opened up my world, sexually.
on our wedding night, we had group sex.
I wasn't involved in it.
but I could hear it through the wall. - I was.
she was amazing. And then it was exactly 23 months later...
...that I found out she was an actual whore.
we discovered her on the street. - Yeah.
I'm sorry.
she was bad. Fucking whoring bitch.
but you got a new wife now, so... . - Yeah. Yeah.
and she is wonderful.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You'll meet her.
you know what? I bet I know your trick, McLovin.
you play the whole myst...-- Calling all units.
just turn that off.
send backup! There's so much blood...
I bet you play the whole mysterious-guy thing, right?
Yeah, seriously. How's it going with the ladies?
it's not the going with the ladies I care about...
...It's the coming.
I get it. - What is it? What is it?
like:
like coming.
that's funny. That is really funny. - Oh, my God.
all right, looks like we got a call. We can't pay for these.
10-4. We'll be right there.
speedy Gonzales, let's go. - We should get road beers.
hell, yeah, we should get some road beers.
can I have 13 beers to go, please?
please. God, my fucking leg.
fuck.
I think it's him. - Is it him?
Hello? - Hey, Becca.
Hi, I had a bad reception. So about your Gold slick... .
guys, shut up. - Hey, what's going on over there?
it's nothing. It's just...
I was just calling, you know, to see if you were coming...
...because I thought maybe you were stuck at, like, a nightclub...
...or a cocktail party or something.
no, no, I'm gonna be there for sure. Full throttle.
Charlie's Angels 2. - Awesome.
I can't wait to see you. Evan? - Okay, bye.
that was the first time I ever did coke. Off that bitch's nipple. That was so...
a little white sniff. - That was awesome.
that was gorgeous.
Hey, hey, hey. You guys, stay in this room, man.
they're gonna kill that guy tonight. That chick's boyfriend is pissed.
Yeah. He's a beast.
I've been praying for a fight. I'm literally waking up and praying...
...to see a fucking fight. - Hey, hey, hey.
who's that guy?
Hi. - Who is that guy?
who's this guy? - Pleasure to see you fellas.
Hi, everyone.
who are you? - I'm nobody.
no, no, no. I know you. I know you.
he was at that party I was telling you about.
no, no. - Who is it?
remember? He's Jimmy's brother. The guy. The singer.
no. - He's the guy with the beautiful voice.
the fucking singer, Jimmy's brother! - That's not me, man.
Oh, my God. - Sing for us! Sing.
"it's not me"? You fucking lying?
no, I don't mean to accuse you guys of being ill-informed, but...
my brother came from Scottsdale, Arizona to be here.
you're not gonna sing for him?
fucking bullshit. - Sing.
you're a fucking singer. - You sing good.
sing it again. - Like a bird.
no, I know, I just...I want to--- You want a line of cocaine?
no way, man. - Yeah.
don't make this weird. Sing.
sing it again. - Turbo.
fuck! Over! - Okay, watch this.
I'll get it right on the nose.
you're gonna fuck it up. You're gonna fuck it up.
under!
I feel hammered. That doesn't make any sense.
you're a fucking pussy. - Okay, okay. Great, great.
okay, McLovin, see if you can do it. - The kid's gonna nail it.
come on, McLovin. Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!
bring it! - 0. 08, motherfuckers!
man! - That's my boy!
Yes! - Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.
so, what's it like to have guns?
it is awesome, McLovin.
I mean, it's mindbl...-- It's great.
I haven't had one for long, a few months, but I'll tell you...
...It's like having two cocks. - Yup.
if one of your cocks could kill someone.
can I hold one? - What?
can I hold one of your guns?
Yeah, sure. - Fine with me. Why not?
everyone should hold a gun at least a couple times.
Yeah, there you go.
have a blast. - Have a blast.
that's funny. - I've never held one of these before.
are they hard to shoot? - If you're Michaels, they are.
he can't shoot worth dick. - What?
I can shoot. What are you--? Wait.
I can't shoot worth dick? - You cannot shoot.
I shot that cat last week. - It was already dead, man.
I still shot it. - That cat was dead.
there's only one way to settle this, guys.
Shoot-off. - Shoot-off.
Shoot-off! - Shoot-off!
there's a lot of reasons why I like you.
I mean, you're handsome and you're a good friend.
dude, there he is. That's the guy. Hey, Mark, right there.
Oh, you got a stain too.
we're blood brothers. - Shut the fuck up.
you're in my house, you answer my questions.
what were you doing dancing with Jacinda?
I don't even dance. I just...
I don't even dance ever, so...I've never even tried it.
then where the hell did this come from, asshole?
maybe you and I rubbed up against each other at some point.
I don't remember. Maybe it was some ricochet scenario. I don't know.
how am I supposed to know? - Kick his ass, Mark.
shut the fuck up, Scarlett.
to some girl.
talk about the hurting.
shit. - All right.
yo! Fight! - Move it!
go, check this out! - Oh, fuck!
and what the hell is this?
I don't fucking...It's detergent. - Yeah, what are you doing with it?
I got fucking blood on my pants.
get down.
what the fuck is this all about, man? Are you--?
well, fuck me. - Fellas.
Oh, shit, I've been tackled by little girls!
you die! You're next!
I should fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him! - what do you mean? No. No way!
you humiliated me! - I'm sorry!
you used my leg as a tampon! - I'm calling the cops.
Evan! Come on! Move!
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview. Hurry.
mark, I called the cops. You should hide your gun.
you're a fucking pussy.
don't listen to him, officer.
if you make this, we're no longer friends, Michaels.
you're a fucking pussy. - Cheating. You're cheating.
fuck me. - Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!
all right, you...That was a lucky shot.
that was a lucky shot. - I rule.
I got jizzed on. All right.
can I shoot one? - Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.
have a good time, man.
empty the clip. Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!
the cops! Bail! Bail! Bail! Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!
shotgun.
what a rush. - What do you guys wanna do?
man, let's get drunk! - Let's get more fucked up!
you're fucking living the dream, Michaels!
Oh, man.
this is gonna be the best night ever.
got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview. - Shit.
all units in the area report to Fifth and Paysview.
car 98, that's you. Do it. - Fuck.
shit. - Shit.
car 98 on it. You dumb fucking whore.
Hey, did she say we're gonna get to shoot somebody or something?
Oh, God, I wish.
it's probably some lame house party. We'll drop you off after. Cool?
Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how we roll!
you fucking prick. - What?
you bailed on me. - I didn't bail on you.
Yeah, you did.
you said you were gonna do something and you didn't do it.
that's bailing.
you're the one that dragged me to that fucking party with those lunatics.
I didn't bail on you. - You bailed on me, okay?
you bailed on me this morning when Jesse spat on me...
...and you're bailing on me next year.
what the fuck? It finally comes out. That's good, man.
we were supposed to go to college together.
since we were kids, since elementary school...
...that's all we've ever talked about, us going together.
and you got into fucking Dartmouth.
you're making me feel like I'm a bad guy.
What...? I didn't do anything wrong. I got into a good school.
how the fuck am I supposed to get into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.
how fucking selfish are you?
you had no problem letting Fogell take the fall.
you don't want me going to a good school.
fuck, man! - So, what the fuck do you want?
I'm not gonna let you slow me down anymore, Seth.
what are you saying?
I've wasted the last three years sitting around talking bullshit with you.
instead of chasing girls and making friends...
...l've just sat around wasting all my time with you.
and now I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin.
is this about Becca? This is about some girl, man?
I like her! - who gives a fuck?
she's some fucking girl! You gonna go out with her?
what about after that? - Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.
fuck you! And next time you're pissed off about something...
...don't keep it inside for 10 years, say it like a fucking man!
don't touch me. - Fuck you!
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers on your side odd or even?
I don't know. It's too dark to see. - We got flashlights.
Oh, that's true.
where the fuck are we?
Hey, Slater. - What's that?
Slater.
now, young Michaels, you will die.
all right. Come on, stop it. I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.
like it? - Hey, fuck off, that hurts.
you stop first. - Not until you stop.
stop it, asshole. - Hey, you stop.
fuck you, Evan! - Don't fucking touch me.
why did you do that?
you shined the light in my face. - You did too.
I'm driving. - We were playing Lightsabers.
excuse me. - Oh, my God.
are you guys gonna make sure he's okay?
check on him. - You check.
you go out there and check on him. - Fuck that. You go.
balls. Okay, we'll both go out there and check on him.
I can't believe this is happening again. What are the odds?
fuck.
is everyone okay? - Yeah, we're great, thanks.
Hey, hey, where's the love?
he's okay. He's fine. - Stand right next to your friend.
get over there. - I got them.
you got these guys?
you boys doing a bit of drinking tonight?
no, officer. Not at all. Not...we--we found those.
I don't believe you.
freeze. Stand right there.
we're telling the truth. - Keep it going.
don't be a hero tonight, guys. - Wrong night for that.
you gotta fucking take care of this.
no. Look, I am not fixing your mistakes again, okay? Fuck that shit.
I don't wanna get shitcanned. I like this job.
me too. I get free haircuts. I'm not taking the fall.
okay, okay!
we're gonna arrest these two little dipshits, okay?
and we're gonna pin it on them.
Yeah, do what you have to do.
spread your shit!
get on the ground! Loaded gun, ready to go!
spread your shit! Pussies on the pavement, fellas.
come on! - Please don't shoot, sir.
"please don't shoot." Shut up and spread your shit!
I am the law! Okay?
now hold hands.
what? - why?
you don't want an asshole where your face used to be, whaling Jennings.
hold his fucking hand! - Fucking hold my hand.
there. That's not so hard, is it?
here, McLovin, have a cigarette.
smoke up. Life's short, you know.
suck it in, my friend.
suck it long and deep.
enjoy it.
McLovin, McLovin, McLovin.
you like Officer Slater and myself? - Yeah, you guys are awesome.
Thanks. We really like you too, McLovin.
so here's what's about to happen.
we're gonna arrest these guys...
...you're gonna write a witness report saying they leapt in front of our car...
...and there was nothing we could do. Sound cool?
Yeah, that's fine. - Good.
that's good. Pretend he's your little sister.
your little sister with the... .
what the fuck?
Fagell?
shit! - Shit!
run! Run!
wait.
hold on, I gotta get all the booze. Seth, wait up!
McLovin bailed!
chase the kid!
stop!
that was a fast kid.
I want a ride! You hear me? You can't unarrest me!
stop!
McLovin! - Come on.
McLovin!
McLovin! why?
McLovin, come back!
my hand! Monster! Nicole! Nicole, get Daddy.
get Daddy. - Get Daddy!
Oh, shit. - Get away from my kids!
you sick sons of bitches!
what the fuck?
Michaels, are you okay?
it's just beer. - Give me a break.
it's just beer. - Man up.
what happened? What, did you lose him?
he's a freak. He's the fastest kid alive.
this is not good. - He's the fastest kid alive.
fastest kid alive, my ass. Come on. What are we gonna do?
I'll shoot my gun in the air.
give me a fucking warning before you do it.
I'll scare him out of wherever he's hiding.
this isn't gonna do shit. Get in the car. Get in the car.
this is your fault, you piece of...
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. They shot Seth.
they fucking shot Seth, I know it.
holy shit.
holy shit. Holy shit.
should I run? - Yes.
fuck. Stop! - Stop the bus!
stop it! - It's stopping.
it's stopping. - Oh, thank God.
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.
that's me and him.
Hey, hey. It's you.
mcmuffin.
you know this guy? - It's...
ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze now, do you?
Hey! Back the fuck up, man, or I'll beat the shit out of you.
give me the booze. - Hey! Back the fuck up.
back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
please, please, calm down, sir.
Goldslick.
get off the bus or I'm calling the cops.
eat shit, bum.
Oh, shit, guys. We're three blocks away, man.
we made it. We made it with the booze and everything.
we made it.
hold this.
I can't believe you still have the liquor.
it's awesome.
Yeah, I told you the idea would work. I fooled those cops.
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.
why do you guys have detergent?
I don't understand why you were smoking cigarettes with those cops.
because I fucking rule.
we are so gonna get laid tonight. - I am. I'm gonna get laid.
we're finally gonna get our drinks on.
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.
I'm sure it'll be fine. - Yeah.
I thought you didn't need it. You were gonna tell her how you feel.
good luck getting Jules drunk enough to have sex with you.
what's wrong with you guys? - Nothing.
you two femmes can talk about it next year at your little slumber party.
Oh, you told him.
told me what? - Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.
well, we gotta tell him now. - No, we...
well, he knows something's up.
what are you guys talking about? Tell me now.
Seth, me and Evan are rooming together next year.
what's the big deal?
"Oh, my God, Fogell's rooming with Evan."
jeez, why don't you go cry about it?
I didn't tell you because... - You're a backstabber...
...and you lied to your best friend and you just don't care anymore?
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.
not from you.
give me that booze, Fagell.
we never should have had to hide our arrangement.
Seth's here. - Seth, you're here.
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.
Evan. - Gaby, hey.
where have you been? You almost blew it.
what are you talking about? - Becca. She's been waiting.
she's over there.
she's way smashed.
and she's been yammering about you all night.
Really? What was she saying?
she told you that she thinks I'm a good guy?
no, no. She said something more like:
"I will fully blow him tonight."
what? - I know.
Yeah. - But she's totally hammered...
...and if I get with her and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?
not if you're drunk too.
I guess not.
to Seth.
to Seth! - All right.
who the fuck is Seth?
I'm Seth!
let's do another one to me.
Oh, boy.
calm down. Calm down, man.
calm down. She likes you.
she wants to suck on your penis.
it's a good thing.
it's the best thing.
just down the hatch.
Fogell. what's up?
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.
can you please help me up?
I fell down and none of these assholes will help me up.
shit. - Becca.
I have been waiting for you for, ever.
what took you so long? - I know, I...
do you have my Goldslick? - No, I can't even...
it's such a crazy story, okay?
I swear I was try...- It doesn't even matter.
look. What we...we can just drink this.
here. You could have a drink. - Oh, no.
I'm already pretty wasted. - Take a drink.
okay, here's to you. This is to Becca.
to Becca.
to the respecting...- Guys.
women. To people respecting women.
okay. Yeah.
you're a lightweight.
Hey.
you and me, we should go upstairs, because...
because I need to tell you something. Okay?
you could just tell me here, I mean... .
I can't tell you, because it's a secret for you from me.
all right. - So come. Come on. Okay.
Bye, guys. - Bye.
Bye-bye. - Bye.
you changed your name to McLovin?
that's so cool. - Thanks.
so, what's Hawaii like?
all right. I am back.
I had to thank the peeps for coming out, you know.
Jules. I want you to have a drink with me.
just drink some of this. You're gonna love it.
you're to...I know you're gonna love it.
you know, l... - It's green beer. For your information.
you know, I'm actually good right now. But thank you.
and thank you very much for bringing everything, again.
seriously, it really made the night.
no, that's how I roll. That's the thing.
it's no problems. You'll learn that.
I love talking and conversing with you.
but I can't hear you, though, because the music is so loud.
so do you wanna go outside and talk more?
Yeah. Sorry, sure. You know, why not?
let's do it. I haven't conversed in ages.
okay. Ladies...Ladies first. - Okay.
thank you very much. - No problem.
watch your step. I fell earlier today. - You serious?
well, I was hit by a car. It's a long story.
Oh, shit. Careful. - Okay, well...
so loud. Don't let the parents hear.
you look so pretty.
are you okay? - I so flirt with you in math.
tell me about it. I... Samesies.
I've wanted to tell you for so long that you're the best girl.
I know. I've wanted to get with you, like, so hard.
like so hard.
you're the best.
we'll take this sweater off. I think so.
just be careful, because it's a meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.
okay.
bought it at that vintage market. - Just hurry.
and this one. - It's off.
Hey, wait, careful.
Oh, shit. - Oh, my god.
put that there.
now, looky, looky... - Okay.
...what I got for you under here. - Oh, my gosh.
you are the prettiest girl...
...this side of the Mississippi. - I have a little something...
...for you under here.
you look so pretty.
look so pretty. - Under there.
hello.
for you.
you're the best. You're so unique.
come here.
Evan, kiss me.
I like you so much.
come on, McLovin.
I've never been with an older guy before.
well, it's way better.
I know, we made some kick-ass tiramisu earlier.
it was deli...It looked weird. But it was delicious.
what--? What's wrong?
I...I would prefer if we would just do that...
...at some other time.
no. There is no other time. School is up.
what's wrong with right now? - Well, I mean, you're...you're drunk.
you're, really, really drunk. - So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.
Yeah, I'm actually...I'm not drunk at all.
I don't even drink, so it's... . I mean... .
Jules, you drink. You drink.
Everybody...you...you had me get liquor, so you drink.
it's like... .
well, yeah, because I'm throwing a party, remember?
other people drink and so I just... .
you...?
you don't wanna, you know?
not right now.
you know, not while you're drunk.
but, you know, thank you.
Evan. Evan, I'm so wet. - Oh, yeah.
they said that would happen in health, when I learned about it.
Yeah. - Yeah.
they taught me about... - Who's down there?
Yeah, it's your hand.
thank you, that's good. - You have such a smooth cock.
thank you. You would too if you were a man.
but you got such a smooth chest.
I am gonna give you...
...the best blow-J ever...
...with my mouth.
why don't we...? why don't we just kiss a while?
why don't we keep kissing for a bit, instead of...?
how badly do you wanna fuck me?
Jesus Christ.
Jesus, fuck.
hang on one second. - What?
Becca, I don't think you wanna do this.
you're really drunk. - No, I'm not. I am not drunk.
I see that you are. I think you are. - And I really...I want you inside me.
I want you to be my first. I want you inside me.
so just...just go with it.
let it happen. - I know, but... .
Becca, this is kind of intense.
and I just...I'm so drunk. I can't even, like, process this.
and you're really pretty.
and I just think this isn't how I pictured it.
I don't understand why you have to be such a little bitch about it.
did you just call me a bitch? - Yes, a scared...
see, I, like, I think we're not thinking clear...
holy shit. Oh, my God.
go get Gaby. - I'll go get her.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Go get Gaby, please.
I got a boner. - Good.
do you have a condom? - Yes.
and lube.
Seth?
are...? Are you crying?
no, I just have something in both my eyes.
I don't cry. That's funny.
you look...you look...It looks like you're crying.
so...
it was my last chance and I fucked it up and...
your last chance to do what?
to make you my girlfriend for the summer.
you're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me.
I thought we'd both be drunk.
what does me being drunk have anything to do with it?
you'd never get with me if you were sober.
look at you.
look at me. - Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.
I think maybe...
what the fuck?!
help me.
Shirley.
I'm sorry.
someone forgot to call pest control. - Yep.
where you going? Hey, party's still on.
where are you going? - No.
if you're back there, get out. Everyone, come on.
we will shoot you. - Party's over.
Evan. - Get the hell out of here.
keep your hands up.
life's bullshit, Miroki.
Evan, wake the fuck up, man.
we gotta go. Those fucking cops are here, man.
Oh, no, it's the cops." we have a complaint.
Evan, come on. - Get the hell out of here right now.
get out of here. She's not interested.
drop the crantini and move it, sister. - See you, sugar tits.
guys, come on, move.
everybody out. Leave the booze and go.
what the fuck, man?
what the fuck, Seth?
he's my best friend. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Come on.
I assume you all have guns and crack.
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.
okay, everyone...
...prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law.
get out.
come on, go.
fuck off, Seth.
get a room.
I'm gonna save you. I'm gonna save you, Evan.
fuck.
fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.
it's in. Oh, my God, it's in.
all right, everybody out. Come on, let's go.
McLovin! What the fuck?
officer Slater, is that you? - You ran away from us.
why did you run away? Michaels, get up here.
no. I didn't run away. - What the fuck?
why would you do that?
I was disoriented from... - Were you violating that girl?
you just violated her with your penis? Michaels, look.
McLovin? - No, no, no.
no.
holy shit. Were you just getting laid?
no. Yeah, I was, but...
Yes, yes, he was. - It's not what you think, guys.
I'm not even...- Sit the fuck down. Stay down.
calm down. - I thought we were friends...
...and then you go running away.
contain yourself.
we're friends. - Shut up.
calm down. Calm down, man. - Why? What?
you just cock-blocked McLovin. Okay?
he's our friend. We don't do that.
we should be guiding his cock, not blocking it.
just relax, okay? Let's make this right.
wait, what are you--? What are you guys doing?
no, please, I can't...I can't go to jail. Please, I can't go to jail.
no, look. we're really sorry, McLovin.
this has...This has gone on...This has gone way too far.
what? What are you talking about?
we know you're not 25, man. We're not idiots, McLovin.
Yeah. - Did you know the whole time?
look, when we were your age, we hated cops.
when we saw you in the liquor store today, we just...
I guess we saw a bit of ourselves, you know...
...and we just wanted to show you that...
...you know, cops can have a fun time too, you know?
Yeah.
you know, in a way, I think we wanted to show ourselves.
also, I'm... .
I'm really sorry that I blocked your cock.
apology accepted. - Seriously, man.
that feels good.
it feels so good. - I missed you guys.
I just wish we could make it up to you somehow, man.
well, do you think you can do me a really big favor?
what is it? Anything. - Name it.
this kid's fucking crazy. - Stay back for your own safety.
get off me, you fucking cops. Get your hands off.
do you know who I am? I'm Fogell.
the joint can't hold me. - Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.
I'm gonna break your glasses, you fucking cop. You can't hold me.
fucking pigs.
Oh, shit.
nice mullet, asshole.
you crazy. - This kid's crazy.
he's nuts. well, we caught the infamous Fogell.
get your hands...wait for me, Nicola.
wait for me on the outside.
we were gonna go to Hawaii.
man, that's gonna get you so much ass.
Seriously?
I know what to do about the car. - Sweet.
fucking go. Fucking throw up.
are you carrying me?
no, I'm saving you from the cops.
you saved me?
well, I don't know what you're talking about, but thanks.
can l...Should I just walk?
should I walk? - Yeah, sure.
okay. - Where do you wanna go?
sleepover at my house? You wanna come sleep...?
okay. - Okay.
does your mom still have pizza bagels?
Yeah. Lots.
pizza bagels.
so by signing this, you are officially saying...
...that as we stopped you from being mugged...
...a crackhead stole our cruiser and did God knows what with it.
you cool to sign that? - Of course. I owe you guys my life.
we owe you, Mc...wait, what's your real name again?
Fogell. - Fuck that.
we're calling you McLovin. - McLovin.
let's do this dance, boys.
Oh, my God. - What did I tell you guys, right?
that was crazy.
all right.
all right, now, guys, check this out.
it's probably the greatest move in doughnut-spinning history.
you paying attention?
behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.
why is it called that? - I don't know.
make the badge proud, Slater.
he's not usually this drunk when he does this...
...but I think that could make it more cool.
McLovin!
Oh, no.
fuck.
Slater! - Officer Slater.
all right. Fucking crazy.
let's do this.
hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go. - I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
I'm out, I'm out. - Good, here we go, here we go.
yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.
don't blow yourself up, asshole.
Yes. Oh, my God.
it worked. It worked.
we won. We won.
can we shoot at it?
I don't know. Can you?
break yourself, fool.
tight.
listen, and then she said she was gonna give me a blow-J.
I can't believe she said that to you. - Man, you have no idea.
what was she thinking? - You don't even know.
I gotta tell you. I gotta tell you something, Evan.
what?
I was in your room, like, three weeks ago...
...while you were taking a shit.
and I saw your housing, like, forms.
so I knew you and Fogell were gonna live together, you know.
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.
I should've told you. I don't know why I didn't.
Don't...No, don't be sorry. I should be sorry.
I was being a dick. I was being a big dick to you.
no, l...
listen, Seth, I want you to know, I don't wanna live with Fogell.
I never wanted to live with him. I just don't...I ha...
I'm afraid to live with strangers.
I can't.
I can't do it.
I know, I know.
I can't believe you saved me.
you saved me.
I can't believe. I owe you so...
you carried me. I love you.
I love you, man.
I love you.
I love you. I'm not even embarrassed to say it. I just...
I lo...I love you.
I'm not embarrassed. - I love you.
I love you.
why don't we say that every day? Why can't we say it more often?
I just love you. I just wanna go to the rooftops and scream:
I love my best friend, Evan.
we should go up on my roof. - For sure.
like, when you went away for Easter, on your vacation, I missed you.
I missed you too. - I want the world to know.
it's...it's the most beautiful thing in the world.
come here. Come here, man.
I love you. - I love you.
what the fuck?
what up? - Morning. Morning.
I should get moving. I should get moving.
I should be getting a move on, for sure.
Yeah, you don't...I mean, you don't have to, you know.
I don't really have anything going on.
you don't have to rush off like that.
you wanna hang out?
I was gonna go to the mall.
I have to get a new comforter.
for college. The mall, they would sell that.
cool. So...
...your mom's got huge tits.
what do you think?
I don't know, man. Don't ask me.
because I don't give a shit how pants look.
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.
those are too tight. Those are way too tight.
Yeah, but, like...- way too tight. You need to upgrade.
there's not enough pants where there should be. More pants.
Yeah, but...I mean, does it look weird?
looks like you're standing funny. You wouldn't stand like that. Like a duck.
Yeah, but I'm doing like...
I'm doing the college poses like...- I don't know if you are.
you might just be doing...- Hey, prof.
okay. - That test was...
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna party tonight or no?
Yeah, but that's just...It's like I wish there were more pants where...
you know, where there aren't.
but when I was wearing your dad's pants...
...I realized that if I wear pants that are a little too small...
...it might encourage me to lose weight.
and also, chicks can kind of see, like...
...you know, the borders and outline of my dick a little.
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that. The male camel toe.
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right...
I know where it is, where it happens.
like, right there.
it's like they're so tight that one ball is, like, above my dick, even.
Yeah, exactly. - It's like three.
it's like a three thing. It's like ball, dick, ball.
it's like a division sign.
like a bunch of people crammed into a van.
making my ass look weird? - It makes a lot of stuff look weird.
no, those are way too tight.
you're right, these look stupid. Let's get the fuck out of here.
I'm really sorry about that. I can't believe I actually did that.
I feel bad that I'm making you buy me a new one.
it's seems, like, ridiculous.
no. I have to, it's puke. It's gross. - Oh, my God.
do alcoholics get hangovers?
holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. It's them.
what the fuck do we do, man? - Don't stop. I don't know.
Hey. - Hey.
how's it going?
it's so good to...How are you feeling?
I've felt better. But I'll be fine. How about you?
I'm okay, you know, yeah. Did you have fun last night?
you know, I actually don't remember much.
I don't remember anything.
so weird. - Nothing.
I didn't puke on you, did I?
you didn't. I remember that you...I avoided it.
it whizzed right by me, and I said, "Stay away from me," you know.
I'm really sorry about everything last night, and I just... .
thank you for being such a nice guy about it all.
that's okay, you know.
at least you don't have a black eye from it.
that looks terrible. - Yeah.
you look great. You don't look terrible. It's just, like, a bad bruise.
everything's great, just from he...This, just like right there.
your eye. - Yeah, your eye.
everything else is great.
but seriously, I acted like a fucking idiot last night.
you don't deserve that. So I'm sorry.
on the upside, I think you look cool with a black eye.
I'm just gonna throw that out there. I don't...I don't know.
well, thank you, smart guy. Thanks. That's actually why I'm here.
because I have to get a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.
Oh, man. Fuck.
and I'm gonna get Jules a new comforter.
I have to get a comforter too. For college.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I just figured I would need one.
so, Seth...
so do you wanna come buy me cover-up or something?
I mean, you kind of owe me.
Yeah, definitely. I would love to do that.
I had such bad acne last year...
...that I pretty much became, like, an expert on the stuff.
well, you drove. Evan drove me here, though, so...
well, so...well, I mean, I have my dad's car.
so I could just give you a lift...
...and then Evan could take Becca home.
if that works. I don't know if it's in your route.
it'd be fine with me.
fine, yeah. Maybe we can get some food.
Yeah, I'd like that.
so I guess I'll call you, then.
Yeah, give me a call. Yeah, you have my number.
I have your information. So put her there.
perfect. Good. All right, man.
okay. - Okay, guys.
Becca. - Bye, guys.
Bye, have fun. - See you, Jules.
Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.
where do you wanna go to eat?
so can you honestly help me figure out what kind of cover-up to get?
I love you.
Hey, I was doing some research for next year...
...and I think I figured out which website I wanna subscribe to.
the Vag-tastic Voyage. - Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?
the Vag-tastic Voyage is the one where...
...they find random girls on the street, and they invite them into a van...
...and then they bang them in the van.
it's like 13 bucks a month...
...and you get access to other sites.
like one's Latina, one's Asian, you know, there's one for fetishes...
...like feet and pee-pee and shit and stuff like that.
that's disgusting. You're like an animal.
I'm... What? I'm disgusting? You're the weird one, man.
don't make me feel weird because I like porn.
you're weird for not liking porn. I'm normal as shit.
peeing on people. That's normal?
Evan, I'm not saying I'm gonna look at it.
I'm just saying that it comes with the site, okay?
I don't know what I'm gonna be into 10 years from now.
I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff.
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar, I want a little production value.
like some editing, transition, something. Some music.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry the Coen brothers don't direct the porn that I watch.
they're hard to get ahold of, okay?
plus your parents are gonna be looking at the bill, dipshit.
Yeah, you're right. I probably should pick the one with the least dirty name.
what about, like, Perfect Ten?
something like that, you know?
like Perfect Ten?
because that could be any number of things.
they can't really get you for that. That could be, like, a bowling website.
Yeah, but they don't really show dick going in, which is a huge concern.
I didn't realize that.
Plus, have you ever seen a vagina by itself?
not for me.
Hi.
thanks for taking him, Seth. - No... No problem, Jane.
how are you? - Good.
beautiful.
don't touch that. - What are you...?
I'm not a piece of meat. - You two are funny.
I can't imagine what you're gonna do without each other next year.
Evan told me you didn't get into Dartmouth.
I got into some schools, some pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.
you gonna miss each other? - No. Miss each other? No, thank you.
I don't... I don't miss each other.
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep every night.
me too. - When I'm out partying.
go to school, boys.
Bye, Mom. - Bye, Jane.
I am truly jealous you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.
Yeah, well, at least you got to suck on your dad's dick.
Hey, Seth, you can't park in the faculty lot.
don't be such a vagine, man. I gotta get a Red Bull before class.
you're being an idiot. You shouldn't have parked there.
fuck it. I'm about to graduate.
they should be sucking on my ball sac.
it's the least they could do for stealing three years of my life.
Oh, fuck me. - Look at those nipples.
they're like little baby toes.
it's not fair they get to flaunt that stuff...
...and I have to hide every erection I get.
you know what I do? I flip my boner up into my waistband.
it hides it and it feels awesome.
I almost blew a load into my bellybutton.
I mean, just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners...
...and just, like, wanted to see them.
I mean, that's the world I one day wanna live in.
it's been two years since I've seen an actual human female nipple.
shauna? Shauna was two years ago now?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so. But she was insanely hot.
exactly. She was too hot, okay? That's what sucks.
how can that suck? I'd be psyched if I got with her.
you got, like, two dozen handjobs.
Yes, and three-quarters of a blowjob, but who's counting?
look, it was the peak of my ass-getting career...
...and it happened way too early.
you're like Orson Welles. - Exactly!
if I'd paced myself, I'd be having at least steady sex...
...with a decent-looking girl.
I honestly see now why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.
you'll have sex in college, everyone does.
but the point is to be good at sex by the time you get to college.
you don't want girls thinking you suck dick at fucking pussy.
I still think you have a chance with Jules.
she got incredibly hot over last summer...
...and she obviously hasn't realized it yet...
...because she's still talking to you and flirting with you.
are you out of your mind? Look at Jules' dating record, okay?
she dated Dan Remick, who's had a six-pack since, like, kindergarten.
Jason Stone, who looks like fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.
Matt Muir. He's the sweetest guy ever.
have you ever stared into his eyes?
it was like the first time I heard the Beatles.
why would she end her high school career with me?
Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz for like two years.
Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot. You're a step up from that dick-load.
that's why you need to stop... Will you get this?
that's why you need to stop being a pussy and nail her.
you could bang her before you leave.
and I'm not gonna dance around it, she looks like a good fucker.
I'm tired of you talking about her like that, man.
what, you can talk about her all day and if I say one thing, it's blasphemy?
well, I don't constantly insult her.
I'm not trying to insult her.
I'm just saying that she looks like a good fucker, okay?
she looks like she can take a dick.
some women pride themselves on their dick-taking abilities.
dick-taking abilities? You think that's good to say about someone?
the fucked-up thing is, I actually do, okay?
if a woman tried to compliment me on my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.
Hey, yo, Seth.
what?
did you hear I'm having a big grad party next Saturday?
no. - Yeah.
Oh, shit! - You're not coming.
tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either.
so Jesse wanted me to tell you...
...you're a fucking faggot and can't come to his party.
you really bitched out back there, man.
I bitched out?
you bitched out, man, you fucking Judas.
you fucking left me hanging.
did you want me to dive in front of his spit?
come on, guys, let's go!
this is bullshit.
pussy.
if I equals the square root of negative one...
...then I squared equals negative one. Okay?
in other words, if you consider I as a constant...
...you can then define the square roots of all the negative numbers.
so I is an imaginary number. It doesn't really exist.
if I equals the square root of negative one...
...then I squared equals negative one.
is this making s...? Okay.
okay, bye. - Evan!
Evan, hey. - Hey, Becca.
Hey, thank you for your pen. - Hey.
no problem. No, no, don't worry. No worries. You keep it.
you won't have to borrow one again because you'll have that one.
thank you so much, that's... - You're welcome. Don't worry about it.
so I was gonna ask you...
...did you hear about Jesse's grad party next weekend?
it should be fun. - I heard. It's a maybe.
Really? - For me at the moment.
my R. S.V. P. - Just a maybe?
so far.
there's so much other fun shit that's gonna be happening...
...that I can't really commit and, you know, hurt someone's feelings.
fun shit? But I never see you at parties or anything.
that's because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing.
I'd love to be at all of them, but...
why weren't you at Dimitri's on Saturday?
there was so many things going on.
I couldn't find a minute to make an appearance.
what did you do? - Saturday was a crazy night for me.
I had some friends over, we had a few drinks.
that's Vag-tastic!
I hung out in my basement, the chill zone, where we chill-lax.
like "relax" and "chill" all at once.
Seth's parents were throwing a party.
we got to hang around adults, which was a nice change of pace.
you converse, you talk to people and they have interesting stories.
I talked to a man who claimed he had climbed five mountains in his life.
then we went to a nightclub, which was incredible. This big, fancy one.
gonna look at tits right now! - I'm feeling crazy. I said that.
you got in? - We got right in.
wanna do this, 'roid monkey? - Fuck you!
then we called it a night. We were all just really exhausted.
what the fuck?!
you would've loved it. It was an incredible, unbelievable night.
that sounds like a lot of fun.
you know, I'd love to go do something like that sometime.
who wouldn't? I mean, it was like...
...me and Seth are always kind of cooking up these...
...fun, sort of, little, you know, events.
I guess you guys are really gonna go crazy next year together.
we were going to, but we got into different schools.
Really? That sucks.
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad. I mean, it should be okay.
not too worried about it, really.
don't worry about it. I'm not worried at all.
all right, well, thank you for the pen. - Yeah. No problem.
Bye. - Bye.
Bye, Evan.
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this class because I'd be cooking with a partner.
but she's never here, and I don't get twice the grades for doing all the work.
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
I know, but look at Evan, okay? Just look at him.
don't keep me waiting much longer. I'm getting impatient up here.
you know what I'm talking about. Miroki, you're embarrassing me.
I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food...
...and I gotta look over at that.
looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my life.
and it's B. S. Excuse my language. I'm just saying that I wash and dry.
I'm like a single mother.
we all know Home Ec is a joke, no offense.
everyone takes this class to get an A. It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.
I'm not putting down your profession, but it's just the way I feel.
I don't wanna sit here alone cooking this shitty food.
no offense. And I just think that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.
when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu?
am I gonna be a chef? No.
there's three weeks left in school. Give me a fucking break.
I'm sorry for cursing.
all right, Jules' partner isn't here today either.
pair up with her. Station four.
Jules?
all right. I'll give it another shot.
I'll give Home Ec another shot.
Hey, Jules. Your partner didn't come today?
that's kind of a personal question. - What?
nothing. It's my attempt at humor. I was just...
Oh, like coming.
like "coming" coming.
wow, that was a little too far right there. The gesture.
Yeah. It's pretty far. Shit, I do that...
no, don't worry. I'm actually used to it.
my older brother says, like, the nastiest shit.
like he called me "hymen" until I was 12.
that's sick. That's not even clever. - I know.
I know.
I would've gone with something at least mildly entertaining.
you know, like... Like... Like "family Jules.
or like "nuts." Yeah, that's funny. That's a fucking funny joke.
fucking funny.
I can't believe that. - So, all right. We gotta...
...mix it up.
Yeah, Hayworth will notice this, if we cover it with chocolate.
the whole thing? - Just dump it on. I'm serious.
okay.
and now it looks professional. - That's really impressive.
it's beautifully done. - I think we're gonna get an A.
so, what are you doing tonight?
probably nothing. Why? - I don't know.
my parents are gone so I'm having a party.
I don't really know how many people are gonna be there...
...but you could stop by if you wanted to.
Yeah, I love parties.
Really?
I just don't really ever see you at them.
you know, it's a love-hate thing.
so, like, you know, right now, I really love them, though.
Yeah. - Good shit, right, Miroki?
Yeah.
Hey, Miroki, could we have a minute alone? Just... Thanks.
dude, Jules is having a fucking party.
Hey!
don't tell Fogell about the party. - Gangsters. What's up, guys?
I was just walking down the hall and Nicola was right in front of me.
she's wearing these tight white pants with this black G-string...
...and you could see right through the pants. It was so sweet.
it's 10: 33.
what?
I told her what time it was.
that's the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my entire life.
can I hear it again? You have time? - Yeah, yeah, Seth.
I'll miss your knee-slappers when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.
while you guys are at Dartmouth, I'll be at State...
...where the girls are half as smart and twice as likely to fellash me.
what are you guys doing tonight? Asshole.
we got nothing. Nothing tonight, Fogell.
no? Well, if nothing comes up, we can get shitfaced again, yeah?
you're always calling me a pussy, but today you're wrong.
at lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went...
...to pick up my brand-new fake ID.
Yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.
that's insane. Evan was like, "I heard about this party.
we shouldn't tell Fogell." I was like, "No, we should tell Fogell.
you could buy us booze now. It's awesome.
Yeah, I'll... Sure, I'll buy the booze. Yeah, we're gonna get our drinks on.
we're gonna party and get crunk and rock out, dude.
if you're not in this class, leave this class.
Fogell! Hi.
okay. Gotta go.
well done. Seriously. See you after class.
you tell that idiot you're not rooming with him?
not yet. No.
all right, well, you better. That guy's the fucking anti-poon.
Seth, it's dishes time. What's the holdup?
we're getting a fake ID, so...
it's not like a big deal. - Wow, that's cool.
but you guys have, like, four more years to go...
...so do you wanna get to work?
well, we got into different schools, so...
so you're cutting the cord? What's gonna happen?
nothing. Jeez, what does everybody think is gonna happen?
the world's gonna explode if we don't spend every second together?
I mean, we're not dependent on each other, you know.
we met when we were 8. We were fine before then.
I was. I mean, it's like, we don't do everything together.
no. All right, I gotta take a piss.
my dick's not gonna shake itself. Come on, babe.
he's a crack-up. - I'm just gonna go.
well, at least we're getting a graduation party.
thank God, man.
I'm excited.
I would do terrible, disgusting things to hook up with Jules.
unforgivable things. - I hear you, man.
I'd give my middle nut to start dating Becca.
Becca's a bitch.
you know what? I'm seriously getting fucking sick of you...
...talking about her like that, if we can be honest.
me too. - Why do you hate her so much?
you've never given me a reason. I think you like her.
fuck no, man! I hate Becca. - Why, man?
fine, Evan. Here it comes.
when I was a little kid, I kind of had this problem.
and it's not even that big of a deal.
something like 8 percent of kids do it, but whatever. It's...
for some reason, I don't know why, I would just kind of sit around all day...
...and draw pictures of dicks.
what?
draw pictures of dicks.
dicks?
like a man dick?
Yeah. Like a man dick.
I'd sit there for hours, drawing dicks. I don't know what it was.
I couldn't touch the pen to paper without drawing the shape of a penis.
that's fucked. - No shit, it's really fucked up.
here I am, this little kid...
...and I can't stop drawing dicks to save my own life.
all right. I mean, I don't see what this has to do with Becca.
just listen. Okay?
your precious little Becca sat next to me for all of fourth grade.
and in the classroom is where I did the majority of my illustrations.
I was very secretive about this whole dick operation I had going on.
even I thought I was fucking crazy.
imagine what everyone else would think.
so I would stash all of my dick drawings...
...in this Ghostbusters lunchbox that I had.
so one day I'm finishing up this real big, veiny, triumphant bastard.
all of a sudden...
pussy!
you hit Becca's foot with your dick?
Yeah. I know.
Oh, my God!
she starts crying. She flips out. And she rats me out to the principal.
he finds this Ghostbusters lunchbox dick treasure chest...
...and he fucking flips out.
he calls in my parents. Turns out this principal is some religious fanatic...
...and he thinks I'm possessed by some dick devil.
my parents make me see a therapist, and he's asking me dick questions.
they made me stop eating foods shaped like dicks.
no hot dogs, no Popsicles.
you know how many foods are shaped like dicks? The best kinds.
Yeah.
well, I don't... That's really messed up.
super gay. - All right, let's stop this madness.
let's just go get some dessert. - I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor.
I'm picking out my classes for next year.
so I gotta sit and eat dessert alone, like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?
I gue... Yeah, I mean, what do you want me to do?
I don't know. Nothing. It's fine.
just relax, man. I'll see you later. - That's fine. I'll be fine.
Hey, pussy.
fuck off.
just the one. Just the one. Not both.
so I'll call Andy and Greg. - Okay.
and I'll bring the '80s dance music.
Yeah, yeah. - Right on.
Seth! Hi. There you are. We were just talking about you.
here I am. - That's weird.
so you're coming to my party tonight? Because it's fully on.
Yeah, why? Should I not come? Because I could think of other shit...
Oh, no. No. I want you to come, I just...
you said something earlier about, like, a fake ID or something, right?
Yeah, I'm gonna get one. For sure, for sure.
I'm getting that for sure.
can you get us booze?
Yeah. I can. I can get you guys alcohol.
Really? Seriously? - Yes, for sure.
that would be awesome. Thank you.
because we were worried about that. That would be great.
Plus, you know, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.
well, Jules, the funny thing about my back...
...is that it's located on my cock.
so you do want alcohol? You want some or no?
you do or you don't? You do want alcohol.
Yeah. - Either way.
well... - Either way. Either way's fine.
this is actually kind of a big favor.
because my parents left me like 100 bucks to feed myself for the week.
but the house is full of food, so I just thought I'd spend it all...
...on, you know, extra drinks for the party, so...
that's really nice. I don't think I've ever done anything that nice.
it's cool? - Yeah.
okay. Thank you. - Awesome.
I mean, seriously, that's really... That's nice of you. Thank you.
so should I just get a shitload of different shit?
well, you gotta get me some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.
Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of gay, but I can get it for you.
so... Okay, so then we will see you tonight.
go to the ball, guys.
Evan. Get into the game.
kick it over to me.
Seth! Get off the field!
get out of here. They're gonna make me run laps.
just fucking listen, okay?
Jules and her stupid fucking friend asked me to buy her alcohol.
but not just her, for her whole party. You know what that means?
by some miracle, we were paired up and she actually thought of me.
thought of me enough to decide I was the guy she would trust...
...with the whole fun-ness of her party. She wants to fuck me.
she wants my dick in or around her mouth.
did you think that maybe she's using you to get her alcohol?
she doesn't want your dick. - Of course I thought of that.
the first thing that came to my mind. Listen.
my older brother always says the nastiest shit.
like he called me "hymen" until I was 12.
Seth, I wanna blow you.
she didn't say that. Come on.
she didn't say the second part, the first...
she's got an older brother. She could have asked him.
she looked me in the eyes and said:
Seth, Mom is making a pubie salad. I need some Seth's Own dressing.
she's D. T.F. She's down to fuck, man.
she wants to fuck, man.
tonight is the night that fucking is an actual possibility.
you sound like an idiot. You're not gonna sleep with her.
no. Dude, I know I talk a lot of shit, okay?
but she's gonna be at the party and she's gonna be drunk.
she likes me at least a little. At the very least, I'll make out with her.
two weeks, handjob. Month, blowjob. Whatever.
and then I make her my girlfriend.
and I've got, like, two solid months of sex.
by the time college rolls around...
...I'll be like the Iron Chef of pounding vag.
can we talk about this later?
what the fuck, Evan? We're down two points.
fucking calm down, Greg. It's soccer.
it's soccer. - Fuck you, man.
Hey, Greg, why don't you go piss your pants again?
that was eight years ago, asshole. - People don't forget.
do you wanna hear the best part? Becca.
you do the same thing with her.
when you guys are shitfaced, you get with her.
this is our last party as high school people.
I've ignored my hatred for Becca in coming up with this plan.
I'm flexing nuts. Just fucking come with me on this voyage...
...and stop being a pussy for once...
...and we can fucking fuck some girls already.
I should buy Becca alcohol? - Yeah, it'll be pimp.
that way you know she'll be drunk. You know when girls say:
I was so shitfaced last night. I shouldn't have fucked that guy.
we could be that mistake!
have you talked to Fogell?
all right, you talk to Becca. I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.
don't worry.
Seth, get off the field! - Goal.
you're getting that! - No, I'm not!
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.
Oh, hey. - Hey.
Hi. Did you hear about the party tonight?
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard. It sounds awesome.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.
Really? - Yeah, I'm gonna go.
that's why I came looking for you.
me and the guys are gonna go to a liquor store.
and I just thought, you know...
...if you needed someone to get you yours, I could do that.
I could be that person.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, that would be great.
that would save me such a hassle, because I was gonna beg my sister.
could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?
Yeah. That's the one with the little golden flakes in it?
Yeah. The girly one. - That's classy.
well, I'll pay you back at the party.
no, you won't. No, it's my treat, miss.
Really? - Yep. That's that.
it's the first of many too, so get used to it, sister.
well, thank you.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm sorry. It was an accident. - It's okay.
I was gonna give you a nudge... A punch, the friend thing.
I didn't mean...
Hey, Becca. - Hey.
Hey. - Gaby.
what's up, Evan? - Hey, Gaby.
we should get to class. - We're gonna go.
so I will see you tonight. - Okay.
really, don't worry. - Okay. Sorry.
Bye. - Sorry.
Bye.
sorry.
Where's that sack of shit, Fogell? He said he'd be here.
I'm here with my thumb up my ass.
I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it.
it was pimp. I feel like a pimp right now.
like one of those pimps. - That is fucking pimp.
that's what I was afraid of. - Why didn't I think of that? Shit.
SH... We're screwed.
okay? We're screwed. - Okay.
this is what we get for trusting Fogell, okay?
he pussied out. I know he pussied out.
what are you making?
I'm just drilling holes. The last two weeks. Fuck it.
what do we tell the girls, we couldn't do the one thing...
...we promised because we're dickless incompetents?
now we're never gonna bone because of that used tampon, Fogell.
how'd he get into Dartmouth? I don't get it. He's got shit for brains.
all right, how else can we get alcohol?
yo, guys! What's up? - Fogell, where have you been, man?
you almost gave me a goddamn heart attack.
let me see it. Did you pussy out? - No, no, man. I got it.
it's flawless. Check it.
Hawaii?
all right, that's good. It's hard to trace, I guess.
wait, you changed your name to McLovin?
Yeah. - McLovin?
what kind of a stupid name is that? Are you an Irish R & B singer?
they let you pick any name you want when you're there.
and you landed on McLovin?
Yeah, it was between that or Mohammad.
why the fuck would it be between that or Mohammad?
why not just pick a common name?
mohammad is the most common name on earth. Read a fucking book.
have you ever met anyone named Mohammad?
have you ever met anyone named McLovin?
no, that's why you picked a dumb fucking name.
fuck you. - Give me that.
all right. You look like a future pedophile in this picture, number one.
number two, it doesn't even have a first name. It just says McLovin!
what? One name?
one name? Who are you, Seal?
Fogell, this ID says you're 25 years old.
why wouldn't you just put 21, man?
Seth, Seth, Seth. Listen up, ass-face.
every day, hundreds of kids go into the liquor store with their fake IDs...
...and every single one says they're 21.
how many 21 -year-olds are in this town?
it's called fucking strategy.
let's stay calm, okay? Let's not lose our heads.
it's a fine ID. It'll... It's gonna work. It's passable, okay?
this isn't terrible. I mean, it's up to you, Fogell.
this guy's gonna think, "Here's a kid with a fake ID..."
...or "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old Hawaiian organ donor.
okay? So, what's it gonna be?
I am McLovin.
no, you're not. No one's McLovin. McLovin's never existed...
...because that's a made-up, dumb, fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!
jeez, man. It'll work. Give it a chance.
did you move my...?
where is my car?
Oh, my God, man.
what did I say to you? I told you not to park here.
why would you park in the staff parking lot?
shut the fuck up, Fogell.
I mean, because you're not staff.
I know that, Fagell! I know that!
Evan, let's go to your house.
wait, are you guys still picking me up from work?
can you answer me?
man, don't you have any non-infant clothes?
it'll be fine. - Yeah.
why don't you just wear what you wore to school?
I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in what I wore to school.
it's completely unbecoming.
no one's gotten a handjob in cargo shorts since Nam.
I have to kill these guys. You don't negotiate with terrorists.
Really? Yeah, that's what we should be talking about right now.
then why don't you go and get some of your own clothes?
that's the dumbest thing ever.
my parents will see that my car's been towed and I'll be grounded.
these fucking terrorists multiply like bunnies.
where did I leave the M16?
do you have any bigger clothes or do you only shop at baby Gap?
fuck me. I can't...
that's fun. Why do they make that?
if you can't even win, then why am I fucking playing?
do you wanna go see what my dad has?
what the fuck?
what the hell is that?
it's a fucking vest, dumbass.
I'm trying to look older. - You look like Pinocchio.
it's just a vest. - They got a lot of booze in there.
if we get it now, we can get to the party faster with Jules' shit.
no way, man. I work there. They know I'm not 25.
nobody said anything about you, dick-mouth.
you really fucked me on this one.
so now I'm gonna steal the booze.
don't do this. I promise you I'll get the liquor later.
Mike Snider's ID always works. So will mine, man.
Mike Snider's ID doesn't have one fucking name on it! Okay?
I thought you Dartmouth guys would be smart enough to understand that.
now Seth's gotta pick up all the pieces.
he won't do it. Don't worry.
I forgot to tell you, my mom said we can have the TV from the basement...
shut the fuck up, he's gonna hear you.
just be quiet. Wait until he goes away.
you still haven't told him that we're rooming together?
Fogell, shut the fuck up.
and take off your vest. You look like Aladdin.
okay. You got it.
hope piggy can run.
how old are you?
Twenty-two.
you certainly are. That'll be 80 dollars.
okay.
thank you kindly. Will that do?
certainly will. Thank you, Seth.
Hey, thank you.
you dropped your purse, ma'am.
would you like some help?
well, that would be lovely, young man.
would you like me to buy you alcohol?
that would be lovely.
enjoy your remaining years. - I will.
enjoy fucking Jules. - I will.
don't do it, kid.
I never had a choice.
you fucking killed her!
No!
Where's all the stolen liquor? Did you hide it up your butt?
piss off! I was gonna do it, but there was a security breach.
you never would've done it.
let's go to a liquor store and watch your stupid ID get rejected.
wait, I'm gonna go put my vest back in my locker.
all right. Here we are. This is it.
you ready? Yeah? - Yeah.
here's the money and the list. - Change is yours. Keep the change.
thank you. What's the list for? - The alcohol.
we're gonna get alcohol for the whole party, okay?
we put a lot of time into this list, so don't fuck it up.
it's perfect.
ouzo, bourbon, spiced rum, Goldslick...
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca. Don't forget that.
raspberry vodka, Scotch...
and Kyle's Killer Lemonade. A six-pack.
this is a lot. I don't know if I can get away with all this.
what difference does it make?
I don't know, man. I'm, like, really nervous.
are you okay? - No, man. I should have wore the vest.
calm down. - What the fuck are you doing?
what if I go in and they turn me down, man?
then we're in the same place we're in now.
who cares? - It's fucking humiliating!
everybody sees them kicking me out.
what if they make me put the liquor back? I can't do that.
this whole thing is bigger than you, Fogell!
so grow a pair of nuts and fucking walk in there and buy the alcohol!
what if I don't feel like it anymore, Seth? What?
then I'll fucking kill you, okay?
I'll stab you through your fucking heart.
no, you can do this, man. Come on.
killing me won't get you alcohol. I'm the one with the fake ID.
then I'll cut your dumb fucking face off...
...throw it over mine and get your ID and buy it my fucking self!
Oh, really? You don't have the technology or the steady hands...
...to pull off a procedure like that, so ha!
peace.
Fogell, just be cool, man. Get in and get out.
you're the hero.
sorry.
is there a problem here, sir?
no. No problem whatsoever.
sir, did you do this? On the floor?
no.
and you should really clean this up.
someone could really hurt themselves.
fuck my life.
we're so fucked. We're so fucked.
this plan's been fucked since Jump Street.
okay, just calm down. Just calm down, all right?
Hey, so did you bring a condom for tonight?
you brought a condom with you?
Yeah. I figured I might as well, you know?
I brought a little bottle of spermicidal lube too.
you laughed in my face when I said I'd be having sex tonight.
that doesn't mean you shouldn't always be prepared.
you didn't even bring a condom? - No.
no, Evan, that wasn't part of the plan.
you did this without consulting with me.
we've never discussed, like, any plan, but you keep saying we have a plan.
I had, like, a general outline. You know?
I was gonna go down on her for, like, several hours, okay?
she would love that. She'd be smitten. She'd go out with that.
or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.
well, I just... I don't see the harm in bringing one little condom.
and one little bottle of spermicidal lube?
Yeah, one little bottle of spermicidal lube.
Evan, that's psycho shit, man. - No, it's not.
that's, like, Charles Manson shit.
what, do you think Becca's gonna be psyched that you brought lube?
Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing that lube for my pussy.
I never would've been able to handle your fucking 4-inch dick...
...inside my pussy without that gigantic bottle of lube.
okay, that's... That's enough. - Fuck.
these girls are 18, they're not dried-up old ladies.
they're good to go. - Then I won't bring the lube.
don't make me feel like that. I thought it was cool.
this is a nice kind. - Let me see that for a second.
an impressive kind. - It is kind of cool.
that's cool. - Fucking dumbass. Lube?
that's funny. - You brought lube?
you owe me 6 bucks because I'm not walking over to get it and it exploded.
Hello, Mindy.
I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years.
you know, I heard they recently decided to add more hops to it.
okay.
I'm gonna need to see some identification.
Really?
makes me feel young again. There you go.
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.
she had the biggest tits I've ever seen.
I heard she got breast-reduction surgery.
what? Making your tits smaller?
that's like slapping God for giving you a gorgeous gift.
she had back problems, man.
and it's not just making them smaller. They completely reshape them.
they make them more supple and symmetrical.
I gotta catch a glimpse of these warlocks.
let's make a move.
she's going around the corner. - Come on!
okay. Your total is 96. 59.
I don't believe it!
are you okay, mister?
what the shit was that?
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I don't know, man. I think she looked better before.
but now that she can jog comfortably, she's in the best shape she's ever...
what is this? What's that?
Oh, man.
holy shit, they busted Fogell.
how did this happen, Evan? Fuck, man!
his dad's gonna fucking kill him.
look, okay?
he assaulted the customer, grabbed the cash and ran out.
so...
How...? - How...? How...? How...?
say when, height-wise. - I'm gonna start up here, tell me when.
I'll start on the bottom and... - When.
whatever 5'10" is, he was 5'10."
ethnically, I mean, did... What...?
I mean, was he...? Was he like us, or...?
a woman?
female? - No.
is that what you're asking? - No, no. Was he...?
like... - What? What?
African? - Af... Af...
was he African? - African.
no. He was American, and he was like you.
he looked just like you. - He was Jewish. Okay, Jew.
it's an odd crime for a Jew. - They're pretty docile.
okay, so we have an African Jew wearing a hoodie.
no, you don't. No. That's not what I said. Is that what you heard me say?
I said he looked like you. Do you look like an African Jew?
no, I look like a cop. - Yeah.
he was Caucasian.
Caucasian. - All right.
okay. - Well, touche.
kind of looked like Eminem. Does that help you?
an M&M. - An M&M.
so he was circular...? - Marshall Mathers. Eminem?
the rapper, Eminem. - Did he look like this?
I'm an amateur. I kind of... - That looks like an M&M.
longer face? Bigger nose? Would you say his mouth was wider?
open? A gap?
is there another squad car in the area that could be of further assistance?
I don't seem to be getting any.
okay, so just walk me through again what this guy did.
he... He... He came in, he's wielding...
he's wielding something. He hits this small gentleman in the slacks.
and then he jumps over you, he feels you up, violates you.
I did not say that. - No, he doesn't.
look, I can't do this. I told you already, I have an exam tomorrow.
can you understand that? I have a goddamn veterinary exam!
goddamn it. This is bullshit.
this is some bullshit. I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.
well, apparently someone has an exam.
how'd you know?
you. You're the one that got punched?
Yeah. - Okay.
first things first. What is your name?
my name?
it's M... McLov... McLovin.
McLovin?
Yeah.
now, what's your first name?
what?
your first name? - My first name?
technically I don't have a first name, so don't worry about my first name.
but we're the police.
we just wanna get the story straight.
come on. - Fuck, man.
come on! - He must be so afraid.
I don't believe this bullshit. I can't believe this is happening!
I didn't know you could get arrested for this shit. We need that liquor.
are they gonna take him downtown? - Fuck Fogell.
he got arrested, okay? We're on our own.
we need a new way to get liq...
fuck! The money, man! Fuck! How much money can you get?
why are you talking about money? What about Fogell?
that doesn't matter anymore. I lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money.
are we gonna bust him out of jail? Bake a cake with a fucking file in it?
fuck Fogell. We need a new way to get liquor, which is fucking impossible.
all right, you need to calm down. We need to think for a second.
we need to think this out. - Fuck thinking, we need to act!
Seth!
what the fuck happened? - Just... Just get up. Slowly.
you all right? You okay?
I am so sorry, man. I am so sorry.
I didn't even effing see you at all, man. Are you okay?
so it's just McLovin?
Yeah.
that's badass. - That is badass.
really cool. - A badass name.
lot of people with weird names. - Chingy. Shakira.
Rafe. Pax.
we arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Fuck.
think he was Vietnamese, it was with a P-H.
but it's still shocking to see on a license.
okay, and how old are you, McLovin? - Old enough.
old enough for what?
to party.
can I see your ID?
Yeah, I think I have it.
you're an organ donor. - What?
I didn't wanna, but my wife insisted.
I give him shit for it too. All the time.
I say, "It's just like a woman. Even after you're dead...
...they wanna tear your heart out." - They wanna tear your...
I say it weekly and it's still funny. - It still makes me laugh.
really funny. - There you go.
I'm sorry, guys. I don't really have any information.
he just hit me, and I didn't see what he looked like.
I don't know if I can help you. - You in a hurry?
Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.
where were you headed? - Near 13th and Granville.
we can take you there. - Get your information on the way.
why waste 2 bucks? - We'll take you. No problem.
please don't report me, man. We can figure this out, right?
why the fuck wouldn't I report you? You just hit me.
because I'll do anything.
please, okay? Anything. Like, literally...
...fucking anything.
name anything. Name it. Name it.
all right, look. Hey, man. All right.
listen, you can trust me, okay?
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.
I have a warrant out for a totally nonviolent crime.
okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.
I'll be honest with you for a second.
you better get us a shitload of cash or a shitload of alcohol...
...or you're going to fucking prison.
what are you doing, man? You don't need to...
no, let's not... Let's hang on a second here.
cough it up. - Fine.
don't know if we should be doing anything official.
we're working together. It's like Let's Make a Deal. Here we go.
seven bucks?
are you fucking serious? This isn't enough. What are you, a 6-year-old?
it's all I have, man. It's all I have. - You better think of something quickly.
my back! My back. Cops, my back. - No, no, no. Wait, don't do that.
all right, listen. I can get you alcohol.
I'm going over to this party right now, bro. Okay?
it's got booze, it's got girls. Booze and girls equals...
I don't know. Do you? I don't know. Do you?
I think you do. Do you? - Yes. That's a definite yes.
definite yes, then.
give me one sec to talk to him. - Stay right here.
Yeah, yeah. Do what you gotta do. Mix it over. I'll be over by the car.
just talk it out. Hey, I'm a nice guy.
come on, it's great. - What are you thinking?
what are you doing? - What?
I lost Jules' money, Fogell's dead to us now...
...we don't have any choice. Let's go.
I don't like this idea. This guy's fucking creepy, man. Look at him.
what? He looks like a guy. That's what guys look like.
what is your problem? - You guys know a guy named Jimmy?
you totally look like his brother.
you totally look like his brother, man.
you do.
you promised Becca you'd get her alcohol.
if you don't, she's gonna have a shitty night.
that's all I'm saying. Come on.
we bingo, bango, ready to go, go?
good luck on your exam tomorrow. - Good luck on your exam.
you don't wanna ride the bus. - Buses smell like piss, generally.
you know why? - Why?
people piss on them.
you know, one of you bros could've come up and sat up with me.
we're fine back here. - Back's fine.
safe in the back seat.
Oh, my God. - What's up?
Hey, Jules. - Who is it? Who's on the phone?
Seth. Hey, where are you?
I'm in a cab right now, on the way to a liquor store.
good. I can't wait for you to get here.
well, I hope your friends are ready to get fucked up.
I'm sure they will be.
okay, I'll see you soon. - Peace.
Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.
she called, she said, "I can't wait for you to get there" .
that sounds like she fully wants it, man! Oh, yeah!
who's gonna give it to her, huh, my man? You, that's who.
man.
you guys on MySpace, or?
officers? I can answer those questions now if you want me to.
we get the gist of it. You were buying beer, some guys punched you.
don't worry about it. We're not gonna find them.
case closed. - But it was only...
but it was only one guy. - Only one guy? Shit.
how am I supposed to find one guy?
this job really isn't how, you know, shows like CSI make it out to be.
when I first joined the force, I assumed there was semen on everything...
...and there was some, like, huge semen database...
...that had every bad guy's semen in it. There isn't. That doesn't exist.
I often go to sleep and dream of waking up in a world where...
...everything's covered in semen. - I mean, who doesn't?
it'd be nice. Like that crime scene today.
if the man had ejaculated and then punched you...
...we'd have a shot at catching him.
no way. - Just punched in the face, no semen.
no semen. - Story of my life.
Michaels here, he's six months in.
he's young, but the Force is strong with this one.
learning you are, young padawan.
thank you very much.
that's Yoda. - Are you familiar with Yoda?
from Attack of the Clones?
we have a 245 at East 24 and Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.
car 98 on it.
see, Michaels, you always take a call at a bar because...
...better or worse, you get a beer out of it.
pretty sweet, huh?
true that. Amazing thinking. - Hey, McLovin.
we got a situation at Bailey's, so we'll drop you off after, all right?
actually, I kind of have to be somewhere...
sweet. Sit tight. - Set course for Bailey's, warp 10.
engage.
Yeah.
welcome to the Thunderdome.
Hey, man, are you sure it's cool that we're here with you?
Oh, definitely, man.
I'm essentially best friends with the guy...
...so a bunch of my buds are coming.
we're gonna rock out with our cocks out. Just kidding.
we are gonna rock out. - Just go, just go.
what's up? What's up? What's up?
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.
this is something a smart person wouldn't do.
look, just act cool and act casual, and try and look old.
we'll get the booze and get the fuck out of here, okay?
Hey, where the party at? Right.
you got those shots, bro? - It's coming.
come on, let's party.
come on. Do it up.
we should grab one of these buckets and get out.
you out of your mind? How are we gonna get a fucking bucket out?
dude, what the fuck? - Hey, man.
what the fuck do you think you're doing?
what are you...? What? Nothing. - You using my phone?
what do you think you're doing? - Hang up. Nothing.
what... What... What's wrong, Mark?
you weren't invited. Get the fuck out of here.
come on, Mark. It's cool, man. - You using my fucking phone?
you calling your fucking friends again?
you calling your friends, your fantastic friends?
no. I mean, yes. But I mean I'll...
come on, man, just relax. Mark, please.
get the fuck out of here. The fuck out of my house.
get the fuck out of my house.
this is my house. - Don't be such a dick, man!
what the fuck?
mark! You really wanna do this, man?
here we go. We're really gonna do this?
that's right, motherfucker.
come on, pussy. Get up, dude.
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro.
werewolves that are turned up to four generations from pure blood are less feral and can transform before, during, and after the lunar cycle.
a human by day, a freak animal killing machine by moonlight.
I mean, werewolves are badass.
best part about it is, we already know how to bring these suckers down ... one of these bad boys right to the heart.
Dean's a demon.
I don't know how you did this, what kind of black magic stunt you pulled.
but hear me ... I will save my brother or die trying.
stop! It's over, Dean!
there ain't much difference from what I turned into to what you already are.
what exactly is that supposed to mean?
I know what you did when you went looking for me.
which one of us is really a monster? Hmm?
you might actually be worse than me.
we got a whole bunch more of these to go.
you can make it a lot easier on yourself.
what the hell are we doing to him, Cass?
the ritual of purified blood is the only treatment I know.
you look worried, fellas.
welcome back, Dean.
maybe you should, um, take some time before you get back to work, allow yourself to heal.
damn. Girl after my own heart.
that's the idea, sweetie.
what the hell?
Hey, something I needed to ask you.
shoot.
you've been...
kicked, bit, scratched, stabbed, possessed, killed...
and you sprain your friggin' elbow?
dude, it was more than a sprain. All right?
and it was a friggin' demon, but...
but what?
that sling come with a slice of crybaby pie on the side?
please.
how you doing?
golden, man. - Come on.
seriously, I'm good.
I am. You know, we got...
three more cases of this stuff on ice in the trunk.
taking some e time. best decision we ever made.
here that.
see that thing in the paper this morning?
maybe it was an animal kill.
it was three kills, and it was in the same town, all within the last month.
Yeah, you're right.
we should call some guys, have 'em fix it.
good. Smart. - Done.
or...
we could be in and out. It's a milk run.
right, because that happens never.
look, Sam, what we're doing here, it's good, okay?
you and me hanging out.
but I need to work.
I need this.
if things go sideways...
I mean, like, an inch, you gotta give me the heads-up.
done.
you got my word.
gentlemen.
well, I'm not gonna lie. We're damn glad to see you.
you boys must come up on stuff like this all the time.
Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely.
hell, seen raccoons in rec rooms and bears in swimming pools.
but this? You tell me.
Yeah.
well, uh...
where do we start? What with, uh...Logging.
ice caps. - Bitcoin. Yeah.
obama.
you know what? Maybe ...
maybe, uh, you could walk us through the attacks.
any similarities, anything weird.
only thing weird about them was how similar they were.
folks torn clean through. Hearts absent.
hearts absent as in ... - Consumed, most likely.
and there were no witnesses?
well, the town square attack, the parking lot...
those were real late. But the bar?
hell, with how jammed the place was, you'd think somebody other than Tommy would've seen something.
and what did he see? - Honestly, not much.
now Tommy ain't exactly what we call a reliable witness.
and he's telling anybody who'll listen he saw some girl go out back with Barker, and she got torn up, too.
so there was a second victim?
well, sure...Expect Tommy's a drunk.
there's no body, no D. N.A.no blood trail, no nothing to suggest that.
give me one sec. - Yeah.
hearts missing. Sounds wolfy to me, right?
Yeah. Pretty brazen, even for a werewolf.
you think it was the girl?
let's find out.
Yeah, Barker and I have been raising hell, chasing tail, and riding for a long time.
part of him always knew when his clock ran out, it wasn't gonna be pretty.
to go out like that? By some animal?
just ain't right.
you mind, uh, you mind telling us what went down?
it was just another party, you know?
Barker went out back.
the next thing you know, everyone's yelling and screaming, and he's all torn up.
now the sheriff mentioned you thought there might've been a girl involved.
you think she was killed, too?
Nope.
so there was no girl?
couldn't say.
you know we're not cops, right?
badge is a badge.
well, you should also know that working outdoors the way we do, we see some ... some pretty weird crap.
stuff that we can't explain.
I mean, hell, half the stuff, we wouldn't have believed it ourselves had we not seen it together.
well, you don't have to live in this town, mister.
you don't have to deal with the ridicule.
I'm just saying that crazy might not be half as crazy as you think.
so if someone were to tell you they saw a ghost, you'd...believe that?
just assume we believe everything.
okay, then.
the other night, I was taking a ride past the old Sturges farm.
you know, thinking about the rides me and Barker used to go on.
I saw her, man. - Saw her who?
the girl. - What, after the attack?
hell, yeah. She was just standing there, all bloody, watching me.
so ... so I turn the hell around, I-I ran back, thinking, damn, you know, she ... she's hurt or something. But...
she was just gone. Like, gone.
like a ghost.
no, I don't give one red cent in hell what the cops say.
she was there. She was eaten.
she's a freakin' ghost.
Well...Ghosts don't shred people like that.
Yeah, well...
this flea bag, looks like she ain't done chowing down on Sons of Anarchy just yet.
guess she likes bad boys.
well, wait'll she gets a load of us.
stop ignoring my calls.
pick up the phone and call me right now.
this isn't how it's supposed to go.
look, I've been down this road before and I'm not going to...
what?
I know who you are.
Congratulations.
after what happened at school, I thought you'd let me go.
Yeah, well, that was before you started dropping bodies.
what?
guy at the bar saw you before you went all Wolverine on his buddy.
So...Surprise. Here we are.
Kate, you said you were gonna go straight.
what happened?
I guess things change.
being this...
I tried to be strong, but the hunger was too much.
too hard.
it's not like anyone gave me a handbook on how to be a werewolf.
looks like you're doing a pretty good job so far.
break some hearts, then you eat 'em.
I was on my own. I...evolved.
so that's what you call killing innocent people?
whatever you're gonna do, just...do it.
Hey.
you know what?
let me do it.
Why?
because...I think you should sit this one out.
what are you talking about?
you're not ready, Dean.
Hello?
warden, we had another animal attack over at the high school gymnasium.
guy was a security guard.
same M. O.as the other three. - When?
deputy said the victim's blood was still warm when he got there, so had to be less than an hour ago.
of course. Thank you. Um, I'll be in touch.
we got a problem.
what, besides, uh, werewolf Barbie over here?
Yeah.
there was another kill, across town, just before dark.
well, how did Kate get her murder on and then get back here b...
you don't think she did it.
look...I don't know, man.
but as far as I'm concerned...
damn it!
all right, if she's not icing people, then why play the big bad wolf?
maybe she's running with a pack?
you know, trying to protect them?
well, a hell of a price to pay.
she was about two seconds away from taking a dirt nap.
what is that? - It's her phone.
let's see who she was Booty calling when we pulled up.
thank you for calling the Lincoln Motel. Can I help you?
so what's this about me not being ready back there?
I'm ... I wasn't...trying to start something, Dean.
I was just saying, I thought that was the whole point of us taking a break.
you know?
Oh, no. No, yeah. I get that.
and, you know, there's no worries there.
okay.
but I gotta ask. What about you?
what about me, what? - Are you ready?
why wouldn't I be ready? - Lester.
my wife kicked me to the curb.
we haven't had sex for four months, but not that she hasn't been having plenty.
it is possible that you can have your revenge.
who summons me, and for what purpose?
Lester! don't!
kill my wife, and my soul is yours.
who are you?
you're a punk-ass demon!
and you work for me now.
you're serious? This is about Lester?
um, don't get me wrong.
I'm not ... I'm not ... I'm not trying to start anything either, okay?
I'm just saying, maybe... maybe we oughta talk about that.
okay, expect there's nothing to talk about.
okay.
okay.
I just figured, since we're opening up veins that maybe you'd want to talk about the guy who you made sell his soul.
the guy who you then killed, right?
I mean, that's the same guy we're talking about?
I was a demon.
Oh, you were a demon? Oh, I didn't realize that.
Hey, man, Lester was gonna pay for that soul shake sooner or later.
so technically, it's still on you.
what do you want from me, Dean?
look, I w... I'm not happy about it, okay?
but I needed to find you.
so if I had to...bend a few rules...
go dark. - Go dark.
sure. Label it if you want.
look, man, again, I'm not complaining, okay?
in fact, I'm doing just the opposite of complaining. I...
I just...
you know, between Lester and the others...
there weren't others.
okay, either way, maybe we both needed that time off.
this is good. This is good.
Yeah. Okay.
all right, so the, uh, clerk says a blonde rolled into room 3 just before sunup.
she alone? - He thinks so.
she's on the move.
what's she doing?
looking for breakfast.
it's over.
Oh, god. Please, don't.
I'll give you anything you want.
Where's Kate? - Who?
you were just in her motel room.
what? That's my room.
why were you following that guy?
Robbie? I-I know him.
I just wanted to surprise him.
test her.
test me for what?
No! Help! Somebody me help!
just take it easy.
I don't want to die.
stop it! Stop it!
don't!
she's my sister.
I lost her.
Kate, why is your sister a werewolf, huh?
Why?! - Hey. Hey. Let her talk.
I am! - Then put the gun down.
Why? So she can run again? Nuh-uh.
she just saved our lives.
my sister is a werewolf because I turned her into one.
okay, this is the part where you help yourself out.
I-I don't care. All right?
I'm sick of the lies.
let me get this straight.
we let you run because we take pity on you, and you turn around and you start making pups?
you start killing people?!
it's not like that! I'm no killer.
well, the way I remember it from the snuff film that you left us, is that you killed your boyfriend's best friend.
that's because Brian went crazy.
I had no other choice.
okay, Kate, if this wasn't you...
then who was it?
your sister?
your sister do this, Kate?
Really?
you almost took a bullet for her, and you got nothing?
what do you want me to say? - The truth!
Hey, guys. Can we, uh, take it somewhere else?
Oh, yeah, sure. Go grab some coffee, maybe some bear hearts.
let's party.
just so you know, Brian's the reason I carry this.
Hey. I'm just showing you something.
in case I ever lose it, like Brian did, you won't have to kill me.
Yeah, well, saying it and doing it are two different things.
I'm serious.
and whether you believe me or not, I've never hurt anyone who didn't deserve it.
and I have never, ever eaten a human heart.
guess that explains all the dead chickens back at the barn.
I eat what I can find, what people won't miss, hopefully.
small game, deer.
I meditate.
yoga helps. - Yoga?
okay.
you laugh, but...
I'll pretty much try anything to keep that side of me under control.
well, that is great, Kate.
it really is. And it's nice to see that, uh, this hippie-dippie new age crap has had such a positive influence over your sister.
Tasha...She's a different story.
after I left school, I was...
adrift. Lost.
not really sure where to go or...
what to do, so...
I went someplace safe.
I went home. But...
even though I'd be good, I started to think about my family.
how safe were they going to be?
I was a werewolf.
and then, of course, there was you two.
what if you showed up and tried to kill me?
I couldn't risk that.
so I...walked away.
never called, never wrote, just...
started a new life.
until one day, I saw a posting on my sister's Facebook page.
Tasha had been in a really bad car accident.
the doctors didn't think she was gonna make it.
we were always so close, so...
I had to go say good-bye.
then...it hit me.
this curse that I had, that had brought me nothing but pain and suffering, could actually finally maybe do something good.
if I turned Tasha into a werewolf, it would heal her wounds, save her life, give her a second chance.
so, uh...
I did the unthinkable.
at first, I thought I'd failed, that...
even though werewolves heal quickly, it was too late for Tasha.
then she woke up, not sick anymore, but okay.
Hi.
Hey. Hi.
Tasha had so many questions.
what happened? How did she get here?
so...I was straight with her.
the good, the bad, the ugly.
what we were and why we could never go back home, and the responsibility we had to control what we'd become.
I picked you up from the hospital I'm gonna take you someplace safe, okay?
it was a lot to swallow.
but we had each other, and that felt like enough.
Or...So I thought.
my sister, she gave in to everything that I had warned her about.
and...
I knew, even if I couldn't bring myself to admit it then...
I knew I was losing her.
so back at the barn, that was all just an act to protect Tasha?
she's family.
and, yeah, worth eating a bullet for.
and she needs me now more than ever.
this is my mess. I gotta clean it up.
and how do you plan on doing that, Kate?
by getting Tasha out of here.
she hasn't listened to you yet.
why do you think she's gonna start now?
I don't know, but...I've gotta try.
y-you know, we'll go out into the woods.
we'll drop out for however long it takes until she learns to control this.
little late for team building, do you think?
so, what? I just abandon her?
I did this. I owe her every chance to make it right.
what if she never does?
then I'll take care of it.
you'll take care of it?
you know what that means?
why don't you ask Brian?
well, maybe it doesn't have to come to that.
you know, if you had shot straight with us from the get-go, we might've been able to help you a lot sooner.
what do you mean? - By curing you both.
shut up.
Yeah, okay, or you're welcome.
there is no cure for werewolves.
and for a long time, that was true, but we found one.
now we've got everything we need on our end. Okay?
but the clock is tickin', and we need one more thing ...
unless you wanna do this without her.
n-no. No.
it's a long drive, but...
I know where to find her.
dude, what are you doing? There is no cure.
there's one.
Dean, it's a little more complicated than that.
Kate and Tasha are monsters, okay?
last I checked, we kill monsters.
right, but how can you possibly blame Kate for fighting for her sister?
we do it all the time.
well, yeah, and that's worked wonders for us.
well, we're still here, aren't we?
Yeah, but is it right?
I mean, all that you've done for me, I've still got this Mark.
and we'll figure that out. We always do.
but you can't take whatever's happened to us or to you and ...
and dump it at these girls' feet.
all right, so, what? You wanna nuance this thing?
hit me. What's your plan?
she's out.
okay. Then, um...I gotta tell you something.
I, uh...
I lied about Lester. - What?
there were others.
other humans? - No. No, no.
and ... and I'm sure there were a few hunters I rubbed ...
or I...punched the wrong way, but...
no. I pretty much saved my best stuff for the bad guys.
but you gotta understand something, Dean.
I watched you die. And I carried you.
I carried your corpse into your room, and I put your dead body on your bed, and then you just...
Yeah. - Yeah. I know.
I guess I was hoping that note would, you know, fill in the blanks.
don't look for me?
that note? Yeah, that was really informative. Thanks.
Yeah. I...
what?
it's embarrassing, you know?
w-what's embarrassing? - All of it.
you know, the ... the ... that note.
everything.
Dean, you were a demon.
I was a demon? Oh, thanks. I didn't ... I didn't realize.
shut up.
not to mention, I never even said thank you, so...
you don't ever have to say that, not to me.
well...
good. Then I guess...
guess it's all gravy.
little R&R and we are back at it.
how we doing?
we're getting close.
what is this place?
ever since Tasha and I were little, we've been coming up to this cabin with our parents.
now why do you think Tasha will even be here?
when she because a wolf, we knew it was gonna be hard, so we kinda came up with this escape plan in case things ever got bad.
so it's a rendezvous spot?
pretty much.
now what?
maybe I should go in first, explain all this?
sounds good.
what are doing?!
you son of a bitch!
there is no cure, is there?
I trusted you.
it's not her fault. It's mine.
she killed people. - Because I did this to her, okay?
so if you want your pound of flesh, take me.
we'll deal with you later.
but she can be saved! - No.
Tasha's in too deep.
you don't ever come back from that, not ever.
come on, Sammy.
No!
please! don't do this!
don't!
please, Sam!
please don't!
I can't believe my own sister betrayed me.
Yeah, expect...she didn't.
you're not gonna shoot me.
and why is that? - Sam.
drop the gun, or Dreamreat here gets his mind blown.
don't do it, Sam.
Well...Sammy?
what did ... who are these people?
Brandon. Travis. I turned them.
they're our new family.
Yeah, you're a regular psycho Brady Bunch.
Hey!
No!
you've always had crappy taste in guys.
Tasha, we can talk about this.
they were gonna kill me.
and now you're protecting them?
no. I'm protecting you.
Yeah. I'm good. Thanks.
so here's how it's gonna be.
you can walk away or you can join my pack.
I'm not walking away.
then prove you got what it takes.
eat his heart out.
you don't have to do this.
no one's talking to you, Paul Bunyan.
so?
no.
take them. Have some fun.
Oh, and I want a heart to-go.
put it in a doggie bag.
on your knees!
well, I'm awfully flat...uhh!
t.i can help you get better.
Oh, I am better.
and smarter and stronger and awesome.
I'm a freakin' superhero.
who kills innocent people?
no, that's not you. You were a good kid.
I was weak and scared.
I let people walk all over me ...
mom, dad, friends, boyfriends, you.
but I'm not weak anymore. And I'm not scared.
I'm scary.
I was trying to give you a second chance.
you wouldn't have been...normal, but we would've had each other.
we still can.
but I'm not gonna spend my life on the run from people like Mary-Kate and Ashley out there.
we're strong, Kate.
we can go anywhere we want.
we do anything we want. And of anyone gets in our way...
you don't have to be alone anymore.
we can do this together.
you okay?
I've been better.
these guys, huh? Can you believe 'em?
Yeah, a couple of minor leaguers.
yo! You're dead.
you don't get to talk. In fact ... uhh!
well, welcome to the majors, boys.
Kate...We're gonna be good, okay?
we're gonna be great.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
so we going after her?
I don't know, Dean.
but you gotta admit, when push came to kill, she did good.
Yeah.
so maybe it's a good thing you didn't shoot her.
Really? You're gonna Monday morning quarterback this thing?
if you got an itch to scratch...
Dean, look, we both jumped on this case.
I agree. Equal parts blame there.
but the whole idea behind laying low was to rest, to...try and deal with everything we ... everything you went through.
maybe we jumped back in too fast.
I mean, Dean, you were a demon.
you still have the Mark.
didn't you ever wanna talk about it?
talk about it? Talk about it how?
come on, man. - I am coming on, Sam.
look, I know what happened. Okay?
I was there. Remember?
I'm not trying to get by it. I just...
that's not what this was about.
then what is this about?
about gettin' back in the saddle. Okay?
doing something good, not stewing in my own crap.
and what if you're not ready?
well, I'll give you one thing.
pretty damned good at getaways.
Yeah.
well, I decided that living was better than being dead.
for what it's worth, thank you.
at the end of the day, she was your sister.
no. She wasn't.
listen to me, Kate.
you keep moving, keep your nose clean, and we can stop meeting like this.
I hear ya.
and I will, but I'm not gonna promise,'cause...
Yeah. See you around, kid.
I sure as hell hope not.
let's say you're right.
about what? - Everything.
maybe I'm not ready to hunt.
but I am just trying to do the right thing, man, 'cause I'm so sick and tired of doing the wrong one.
dad wants us to pick upwhere he left off saving people, hunting things, the family business.
then
there's a really good curefor a hangover.
it's a greasy pork sandwich served up in a dirty ashtray.
Oh, I hate you.
I know you do.
we're not gonna startthat crap again.
start what up?
that prank stuff.
it's stupid, and it always escalates.
what's the matter, sammy?
afraid you're gonna get nair in your shampoo again?
just remember, you started it.
what the -- one, me.
that's all you got?
it's weak.
you're a friggin' jerk!
you smell like a toilet.
chicken.
jerk.
bitch.
shut up.
you wuss.
bitch.
jerk.
bring it on, baldy.
now
excuse me.
are you lost?
no.
I've been waiting for you, professor.
Oh, you're in oneof my classes?
don't you recognize me?
well...
they're big classes.
anyway, my office hours aretuesday and thursday mornings.
Really?
I was hoping I could see you now.
um...
well, since you askedso nicely, come on.
such a handsome photo.
that old thing.
so, what can I do for you?
how's the anscombe papercoming?
uh, professor, I
I have a confession to make.
what's that?
I'm not really one of your students.
really.
then, why are you here?
maybe I should just go.
wait.
I get it.
I understand how you're feeling, and it's only natural.
you are young and wide-eyed.
and I'm somewhat of a celebrity around here.
don't get me wrong, you're a very beautiful girl.
but it would be wrong of meto take advantage of you.
I just, uh...
I just respect you too much.
Oh, my god.
what?
don't you like me anymore?
don't you want me?
one week later
tall Tales
no, I don't mind.
how's the research going?
you know how it's going?
slow.
you know how it would go a heck of a lot faster?
if I had my computer.
can you turn that down, please?
Yeah, absolutely.
you know what?
maybe you should just go somewhere for a while, huh?
Hey, I'd love to.
unfortunately, my car's all screwed to hell.
I told you, I have nothing to do
Hey, bobby.
Hey, boys.
Hey, bobby.
it's good to see you again so soon.
Yeah, uh, thanks for coming.
come on in.
thank god you're here.
so, um...
what didn't you want to talk to me on the phone about?
it's this job we're working.
we...we weren't sure you'd believe us.
well, I can believe a lot.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
it's just we've never seen anything like it.
not even close.
we thought we could use some fresh eyes.
why don't you begin at the beginning?
Yeah.
um, all right, please.
so...
it all started when we caught wind of an obit.
see, a professor took a nose dive from a fourth-story window, only there's a campus legend that the building's haunted.
so we pretexted as reporters from the local paper.
Yeah, we both had the professor for "ethics and morality.
so, why do you think he did it?
who knows?
he was tenured, wife and kids.
his book is a really big deal.
then again, who's to say it was suicide?
Jen, come on.
well, what else could it be?
well, you know about crawford hall.
no, I don't, actually.
it's a bunch of crap.
it's a total urban legend.
well, heather's momwent to school here, and she knew the girl.
wait, what girl?
like, 30 years ago, this girl was having an affairwith some professor.
he broke it off.
she jumped out the window and killed herself.
you know her name?
no.
but they say she jumped from room 669.
get it?
you turn the 9 upside down...
so now she haunts the building, and anyone who sees her...
they don't live to tell the tale.
well, if no onelives to tell the tale, then how does the tale get told?
Curtis, shut up!
you know what?
uh, thanks a lot, guys.
excuse me.
what are you --what are you drinking?
I don't know, man.
I think they're called purple nurples.
I think we should check outthe professor's office.
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't right now.
I've got a feisty little wild cat on the hook.
reel her in.
I'll introduce you.
Starla, hey.
this is my shuttle copilot, major tom.
major tom -- starla.
enchant?
Hi.
sorry.
just trying to keep my liquor down.
Hey, good news.
she's got a sister.
hold on a minute.
what?
come on, dude.
that's not how it happened.
no?
so you never drank a purple nurple?
Yeah, maybe that, but...
I don't say things like,"feisty little wildcat.
and her name wasn't starla.
then what was it?
I don't know, but she was a classy chick.
she was a grad student, anthropology and folklore.
we were talking about local ghost stories.
here's to -- here's to us.
my god, you are attractive.
Thanks.
but no time for that now.
you need to tell me about this urban legend.
please.
lives are at stake.
sorry.
I just --I can't even concentrate.
it's like staring into the sky.
Dean, what do you think you're doing?
Sam, please.
if you wouldn't mind, just give me five minutes here.
Dean, this is a very serious investigation.
we don't have time for any of your blah blah blah blah.
blah blah blah-blah.
blah blah-blah-blah blah!
blah blah-blah blah-blah blah-blah-blah.
Blah!
right.
and that's how it really happened.
I don't sound like that, dean.
that's what you sound like to me.
okay.
what's going on with you two?
nothing.
it's nothing.
come on.
you're bickering like an old married couple.
no, see, married couples can get divorced.
me and him?
we're like, uh, siamese twins.
it's "conjoined" twins.
see what I mean?
look, it -- we've just been on the roadfor too long, tight quarters, all that.
don't worry about it.
okay.
so, anyway, we figured it might be a haunting, so we went to check out the scene of the crime.
how long have you been working here?
I've been mopping these floors for six years.
there you go, guys.
what the heck's that for?
just find the wirein the walls.
well.
not sure why you're wiring up this office.
not gonna do the professor much good.
Why's that?
he's dead.
what happened?
he went out that window right there.
yeah?
were you working that night?
I'm the one who found him.
you see it happen?
Nope.
I just saw him come up hereand, uh...
well...
what?
he wasn't alone.
who was he with?
come on!
I ate one, maybe two.
just let me tell it, okay?
he was with a young lady.
I told the cops about her, but I guess they never found her.
you saw this girl go in, huh?
but did you ever see her come out?
now that you mention it, no.
you ever see her before, around?
not her.
what do you mean?
I don't mean to cast aspersionson a dead guy, but, uh...
Mr. Morality here?
he brought a lot of girls up here.
got more ass than a toilet seat.
one more thing.
this building -- it only has four stories, right?
Yeah.
so there wouldn't be a room 669?
of course not.
why do you ask?
Ah, just curious.
Thanks.
sure.
well, no traces of emf, that's for sure.
and that room 669's a load of crap.
so, what do you think?
the professor's just a jumper?
a legend's just a legend?
I don't know.
the girl that the janitor described -- that's pretty weird.
Yeah.
we ought to check out the history on the building.
see if any coed ganked herself there.
Yeah, you're right.
dude, were you on my computer?
no.
Oh, really?
cause it's frozen now on -- on busty asian beauties. com.
would you just -- don't touch my stuff anymore, okay?
why don't you control your ocd?
but did you dig up anything about the building, or on the suicidal coed?
no.
history's clean.
then it's not a haunting.
maybe not.
tell you the truth, we're not really sure.
what do you mean you're not sure?
well...
it's weird.
what's weird?
this next part, we, uh...
we didn't see it happen ourselves, exactly, but...
it's pretty friggin' weird, even for us.
aliens?
Yeah.
aliens?
Yeah.
look, even if they are real, they're sure as hell not coming to earth and swiping people.
Hey, believe me. We know.
my whole life I've never found evidence of an honest-to-god abduction.
it's all just cranks and pranks.
Yeah, that's what we thought.
but...
we figured we'd at least talk to the guy.
Hey, you ought to give those purple nurples a shot.
so, what happened, curtis?
give us a chance.
I do not want this in the papers.
off the record, then.
I, uh...
I blacked out, and...
I lost time, and when I woke up, I don't know where I was.
then what?
they did tests on me.
and, uh...
they probed you?
Yeah, they probed me.
again and a-- again and -- and again.
and again and again and again and then one more time.
Yikes.
and that's not even the worst of it.
how could it get any worse?
some alien made you his bitch.
they...
they made me...
slow dance!
you guys are exaggerating again, huh?
no.
then this frat boy's just nuts.
we're not so sure.
I'm telling you, dean, this was made by some kind of jet engine.
you mean some saucer-shaped jet engine?
what else could it be?
what the hell?
I don't know.
seriously, dude -- what the hell?
I don't know.
I mean, first the haunting.
now this?
the timing alone -- there's got to be some kind of connection.
you mean between the angry spirit and the sexed-up E. T?
what could the connection possibly be?
but what could we do?
so we just kept on digging.
so, you and this guy, curtis -- you were in the same house?
Yeah.
you heard what happened to him, right?
Yeah, he says it was aliens, but, you know, whatever.
look, man, I -- I know this all has to be so hard.
um, not so much.
but I want you to know...
I'm here for you.
you brave little soldier.
I acknowledge your pain.
come here.
you're too precious for this world.
I never said that!
you're always saying pansy stuff like that.
well, um...
Yeah, uh, thanks.
thanks for the hug, but, uh, I'm okay.
really.
to tell you the truth, whatever happened to curtis, he had it coming.
why is that?
he's our pledge master.
put us through hell this semester and got off on it.
so now he know show we feel.
it's okay.
still doesn't make a lick of sense.
but, hey, at least there's one connection.
between what?
the victims.
the professor and the frat guy -- they're both dicks.
that's a connection?
you got anything betterto go on, I'd love to hear it.
Where's my laptop?
I don't know.
think about it.
a philandering professor gets a dead girl.
a pledge master gets hazed.
I left it in here.
you obviously didn't.
I mean, these punishments --they're almost poetic.
actually, it'd be more like a limerick, but still okay, hilarious.
Where'd you hide it?
what, your computer?
Yeah, where'd you hide it?
why would I take your computer?
because no one else could have.
we keep the door locked.
we never let any maids in.
looks like you lost it, poindexter.
dude, you know something?
I put up with a lot from you.
what are you talking about?
I'm a joy to be around.
yeah?
your dirty socks in the sink, your food in the fridge.
what's wrong with my food?
it's not food anymore, dean!
it's darwinism.
all I ask from you, the one thing, is that you don't mess with my stuff!
you done?
you know, how would you feel if I screwed with the impala?
it'd be the last thing you ever did.
did you take his computer?
serves him right, but, no.
well, I didn't lose it.
cause i don't lose things.
Oh, that's right, 'cause he's mr. Perfect.
okay, okay.
why don't you just tell me what happened next?
there was one more victim.
now, we didn't see this one ourselves, either.
we kind of put it together from the evidence.
but this guy -- he was a research scientist.
animal testing.
Yeah, you know -- a dick, which fits the pattern.
so?
Hey.
well, this ought to be quick.
Ugh.
OK. That is just nasty.
uh, yeah.
mutilated?
looks to me like something was hungry.
they identify him yet?
Yeah.
a research scientist at the college.
guess where his office was, by the way.
Crawford hall, same as the professor.
that's right where the frat boy had his close encounter.
Yeah.
Hey, grab me that thing, would you?
Thanks.
what is it?
looks like a...
a belly scale?
a belly scale?
from what?
an alligator?
an alligator in the sewer.
come on.
what?
well, dean, it's a classic urban legend.
a kid flushes a baby gator down the toilet, and it grows huge in the tunnels.
but no one's ever really found one.
they're not real.
neither's alien abduction, but something chompedon this guy.
this couldn't get any weirder.
maybe we should get some help.
I'll call bobby.
maybe he's run into something like this before.
Oh, I'm sure he has.
just your typical haunted campus, alien abduction, alligator-in-the-sewer gig.
Yeah, it's simple.
we decided to search the sewer anyway, so we split up, each taking one end of campus.
did you find anything?
Yeah, I found something, just not in the sewer.
son of a bitch!
you think this is funny?
it depends.
what?
the car!
what about the car?
you can't let the air out of the tires.
you're gonna bend the rims!
whoa, wait a minute.
I didn't go near your car.
Oh, yeah?
then how'd I find this?
Hey, give me back my money.
Oh, no, no.
consider it reparations for, uh, emotional trauma.
Yeah, very funny.
now, give it back.
no.
Dean, I have had it upto here with you.
yeah? Right back at you!
get off me!
give it back!
okay, I've heard enough.
you showed up about an hour after that.
I'm surprised at you two.
I really am.
Sam, first off, deandid not steal your computer.
but I- shh, shh, shh, shh!
and, dean, sam did not touch your car.
Yeah.
and if you two bothered to pullyour heads out of your asses, it all would have been pretty clear.
what?
what you're dealing with.
I got nothing.
me neither.
you got a trickster on your hands.
that's what I thought.
What?!
no, you didn't.
I got to tell you...
you guys were the biggest clue.
what do you mean?
these things create chaos and mischief as easy as breathing, and it's got you so turned around and at each other's throats, you can't even think straight.
the laptop.
the tires.
it knows you're onto him, and it's been playing you like fiddles.
so, what is it --spirit, demon, what?
well, more like demigods, really.
there's loki in scand inavia.
there's anansiin west africa.
dozens of them.
they're immortal, and they can create things out of thin air, things as real as you and me.
make them vanish just as quick.
you mean like an angry spiritor an alien or an alligator.
the victims fit the M. O. Too.
tricksters target the high and the mighty, knock them down a peg, usually with a sense of humor deadly pranks, things like that.
Bobby, what do these things look like?
lots of things, but human, mostly.
and what human do we know who's been at ground zero this whole time?
Oh, that's a good one.
come here!
could you eat?
I could eat.
come on.
something's missing.
sorry I'm dragging a little ass today, boys.
had quite the night last night.
lots of sex, if you catch my drift.
Yeah, hard not to.
listen, we won't be long.
we just need to check a couple offices up on 3.
no problem.
, Damn.
I, uh, forgot something in the truck.
okay.
just 'cause he reads the weekly world news doesn't mean he's our guy.
you read it, too.
I'm telling you, it's him.
another thing bobby mentioned was that these suckers have a metabolism like an insect, a real sweet tooth.
I didn't find any candy bars or sugar.
not even equal.
probably missed something.
I don't miss things.
Oh, right, 'cause you're mr. Perfect.
what?
are you really still pissed at me 'cause of what the trickster did?
you been a tight ass long before that trickster showed up.
look, just...
stay here, keep an eye on the janitor.
I'll go to his place to see if I can find any actual evidence before you go barging in and staking the man!
just wt tillI get back, okay?
okay?
okay!
eh, screw this.
we've been waiting for you, dean.
y-y-you guys aren't real.
trust me, sugar, it's gonna feel real.
come on.
let us give you a massage.
what-- you know, I'm a-- I'm a sucker for a happy ending.
really, I am, but...
I-I'm gonna have to pass.
they're a peace offering.
I know what you and your brother do.
I've been around a while.
run into your kind before.
well, then you know that I...
can't let you just keep hurting people.
come on!
those people got what was coming to them.
hoisted on their own petards.
but you and sam --I like you.
I do.
so treat yourself long as you want.
just long enough for me to move on to the next town.
Yeah, I don't think I can let you do that.
I don't want to hurt you.
and you know that I can.
look, man, I --I got to tell you, I dig your style, all right?
I mean ... I do.
I mean ... And the slow-dancingalien
one of my personal favorites.
Yeah.
but, uh, I can't let you go.
too bad.
like I said, I like you.
Sam was right.
you shouldn't have come alone.
well, I'll agree with you there.
that fight you guys had outside-- that was a trick?
not bad.
but you want to see a real trick?
nice toss, ladies!
I did not want to have to do this.
me neither.
you guys okay?
Yeah.
I guess.
all I got to say he had style.
Bobby, thanks a lot.
Hey, save it!
let's just get the hell out of dodge before somebody finds that body.
look, dean, um...
I just want to say that I'm, uh...
Hey.
me too.
you guys are breaking my heart.
could we please just leave?
okay.
I'm in.
you gonna tell Dean about what we're doing?
I just got to figure out the right way to say it.
he's gonna find out,
and if it's not from you, he's gonna be pissed.
he's gonna pissed anyway.
you satisfied?
why do you trust her so much?
I told you, Dean, she helped me go after Lilith.
well, thanks for the thumbnail -- real vivid.
something major must've happened while I was downstairs, 'cause I come back and -- and you're bff with a demon?
you want to fill in a little detail?
sure, Dean. let's trade stories.
you first. how was hell? Don't spare the details.
Hey.
what?
Ted's kind of cracking the whip, isn't he?
you think I like coming home late?
I'm working my ass off.
okay.
sorry.
no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
long day.
Oh, hey. I ran into Jill Martin today.
Gary's turning 40 on Saturday.
yeah?
she invited us to the party.
What'd you tell her?
that we'd go.
you're kidding.
what?
you like Gary.
Yeah, that doesn't mean
that I want to waste my Saturday night with him.
I thought you'd want to go.
I don't believe you.
I-it's fine.
I'll -- I'll call Jill and tell her we can't make it.
what's with you tonight?
it's like you want to have a fight or something.
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
no storms, no -- no bad crops, nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah, I will keep looking.
you keep looking, too, okay?
all right, talk soon.
Hey.
up and at 'em, kiddo.
you're up early. what are you doing?
nothing. I was in the can.
yeah?
Yeah. want me to draw you a picture?
no, I'll pass.
I found a job -- bedford, iowa.
guy beat his wife's brains out with a meat tenderizer.
Yikes.
and get this -- third local inside two months
to gank his wife.
no priors on any of them, all happily married.
sounds like "ozzie and harriet" .
more like "the shining" .
all right, well, I guess we better have a look.
why does the p. d. keep sending you guys?
I already said I don't want a lawyer.
they're lining up the firing squad.
I'm pleading guilty.
all right, look, you don't want us to represent you
that's fine.
in fact, it's probably not a bad idea, between you and me.
we just want to understand what happened.
that's all.
Mr. Benson...
...please.
what happened was...
I killed my wife.
and you want to know why?
because she made plans without asking me.
when it happened, how did you feel?
disoriented? out of control?
like something possessed you to do it?
I knew exactly what I was doing.
I was crystal clear.
then why did you do it?
I don't know.
I loved her.
we were happy.
9 g's.
that's a hefty bill.
where did you get that?
doesn't matter. we have it.
see, certain charges
ones you don't want the missus to know
they show up under shady names like "m & c entertainment" .
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, you're dropping plastic at a nudie bar, for instance.
we just... want to know the truth, Mr. Benson.
her name was...Jasmine.
she was a stripper?
dude, her name was Jasmine.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
I don't like to go to strip bars.
my buddy was having a bachelor party,
And...there she was.
jasmine.
she came right up to me.
and...
I-I don't know, s-she was just...
perfect.
everything that I wanted.
well, you pay enough, anybody will be anything.
it wasn't about the money.
it wasn't even about the sex.
it was
I don't know.
I don't know what it was.
it's hard to explain.
and your wife found out?
no, she never had a clue.
then why'd you kill her?
for jasmine.
she said we would be together forever,
if -- if only...
Vicki was...
Muerte.
afterwards, me and Jasmine were supposed to meet,
and she never showed.
I don't know where she lives. I don't know her last name.
I don't even know her real first name.
I'm an idiot.
and you didn't think to tell this to the cops?
what for?
the stripper didn't do it.
I did it.
and I know what I deserve.
judge doesn't give me the death sentence,
I'll just do it myself.
rough night?
fun night.
rough morning.
can I help you?
uh, yes.
I'm special agent Stiles -- FBI.
you're Dr. Cara Roberts?
far as I know.
you do some work with the sheriff's department?
Yeah, when I'm not slogging it through the e. r.
it's a small town. we multitask.
well, I have some questions about a case
about several cases, actually.
you mind if I sit? great.
uh, Adam Benson, Jim Wylie, and Steve Snyder?
Oh, yeah. the men who killed their wives.
you handled the work-ups, right?
Mm-hmm. autopsies for the wives and tox screens for the perps.
two-for-one special.
you find anything?
not really.
I mean, c. o.d. on the women was pretty clear
there was nothing unusual in their system.
what about the husbands?
can I see your badge again?
there was one thing
um, an anomaly in the blood work.
and I remember thinking how strange it was
that it showed up in all three of the men.
that what showed up?
oxytocin.
and their levels were crazy high.
uh, oxytocin?
Mm-hmm, it's a hormone
that's produced during childbirth, lactation, and sex.
okay.
people call it the love hormone.
um, you know how it feels when you first fall in love
the whole weak-in-the-knees, tattoo-you-on-my-chest thing?
that's oxytocin.
of course, it eventually fades,
and then you're stuck with every relationship ever,
that and the painful regimen of tattoo removal.
What'd I miss?
this is my partner -- Agent Murdock.
please, "agent" sounds so formal.
you can call me Dean.
I'm Dr. Roberts.
so, um...
can I help you with anything else?
Uh...sure. just one more thing.
this chemical, this...
oxytocin. ...- oxytocin
what would cause those high levels that you found?
nothing that I've ever seen.
okay. that's it.
Thanks, Doc.
by the way, uh, try a greasy breakfast.
best thing for a hangover.
watch it, buddy. I'm the only m. d. here.
dude, you totally c-blocked me.
so, Wylie and Snyder fessed up, huh?
one emptied his i. r.a.
the other, his kid's college fund
all on the same thing.
live nude girls?
club called the honey wagon.
these guys have affairs, too, with a stripper also known as Jasmine?
yes and no.
this is where it gets interesting.
each guy hooked up with a different chick.
so, what, these girls all connected somehow?
well, they all described their stripper in the same way,
the exact same way
perfect and everything that they wanted.
Yeah, at least they'll dream - Barbie convinced them to murder their wives. - there's that.
you know, it's almost like they were under some kind of love spell.
sure seems that way.
which caused them to become totally psychotic.
Absolutely.
you seem pretty cheery.
strippers, Sammy. strippers.
we are on an actual case involving strippers.
finally.
I'm looking for three girls
jasmine, Aurora, and Ariel.
you seriously think those names mean anything to me?
one's a redhead about 5'9." the other one's Asian about
do you have any idea how many girls I deal with?
fake names, fake hair, fake...
you got to have some sort of paperwork, check stubs,
some way to keep track of the strippers.
please. exotic dancers
independent contractors working for cash.
I stay out of their hair.
they stay out of what little I have left.
three of your customers murdered their wives.
you don't think that that's weird?
Yeah, I think that's super-freakin' weird.
but you know what it ain't my problem.
any luck?
no. you?
a little. I just talked to Bobby.
we officially have a theory.
what's that? - Siren.
like greek-myth siren?
like "the odyssey"?
Hey, I read.
Yeah, actually, but the siren's not actually a myth.
it's more of a beautiful creature that prey on men,
entice them with their siren song.
let me guess -- "welcome to the jungle"?
no, no. warrant's "cherry pie"?
their song is more of a metaphor
like their call, their allure.
so they shake their thing and the guys zombie out?
basically, yeah. sirens live on islands.
sailors would chase them,
completely ignoring the rocky shores,
and dash themselves to pieces.
sounds like Adam and his buddies.
if you were a siren in '09
and looking to ruin a bunch of morons,
where would you set up shop?
so, whatever floats the guy's boat,
that's what they look like?
Yeah. you see, sirens can read minds.
they see what you want most,
and then they can kind of, like, cloak themselves
you know, like an illusion.
so it could all be the same chick,
morphing into different dream girls?
Yeah, actually. probably.
sirens are usually pretty solitary.
how do we kill it?
Bobby's working on it.
but even if we figure that out...
how the hell are we gonna find it? It could be anybody.
Hi, Belle.
thought you'd never come.
it's okay. she's asleep.
Lenny, you're amazing...
taking care of her like this.
most guys would have put her in a nursing home.
it's no big deal.
she's my mom.
like I said -- amazing.
baby...
...I love you so much.
the way you take care of me and your mom
you're so sweet...
and strong.
I just wish you didn't have to carry it all.
I mean, your mom takes up all your time.
as long as she's around, we can't really be happy.
she's not so bad.
I could be with you...
forever...
if only your mom wasn't here.
don't you want to be with me forever?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know I do.
then bash your mother's brains in.
baby, do it for me.
do it, baby.
Yeah, okay.
if you say so.
I love you.
Hey, Sam.
Sam? you there?
Lenny Bristol was definitely another siren vic.
you got in to see him? -Yep.
said he brought a stripper home named Belle.
couple hours later, he offed his mother.
belle, of course, went m. i.a.
wait. he killed his mom?
woman he was closest to.
Yeah, you, uh... forgot your cellphone.
Hey, Bobby.
Sam, did you find her yet?
uh, no,
and doesn't seem like she's slowing down any.
what about you? Got anything?
well, some lore from a dusty greek poem.
shockingly, it's a little vague.
Oh, hold on a sec. I'm gonna put you on speaker.
it says you need "a bronze dagger
covered in the blood of a sailor under the spell of the song.
what the hell does that mean?
you got me.
we're dealing with 3, 000 years of the telephone game here.
best guess?
well, the siren's spell ain't got nothing to do with any song.
it's most likely some kind of toxin or venom.
something she gets in the vics' blood.
that makes them go all Manchurian candidate.
uh, what do you think? she infects the men during sex?
maybe.
supernatural std.
well, however it happens,
once it's done, the siren's got to watch her back.
if she gets a dose of her own medicine...
it kills her.
like a snake getting iced by its own venom.
so we just got to find a way to juice one of the o. j.s in jail?
it's not that easy.
none of those guys are under the spell anymore.
haven't got a clue where you're gonna get the blood you need.
I think I might have an idea.
be careful.
these things are tricky bastards.
wrap you up in knots before you know what hit you.
Dr. Roberts.
agent Stiles.
can't stay away, huh?
actually, we're here on business
about the blood samples, the ones with the high...
...you know, oxytocin.
do you still have them?
good. we need them.
what for?
excuse me, Dr. Roberts?
yeah?
excuse me.
uh, we're a little busy here, buddy.
Yeah, so am I, pal.
doc, could you give us a sec, please?
sure. - Thanks.
what's your name?
Nick Monroe. What's yours?
I'm special agent Sam Stiles.
this is my partner -- Dean Murdock.
what office you from?
Omaha -- violent-crimes unit.
my s. a.c. sent me down here
to see about the murders.
you?
D. c.
our assistant director assigned us.
which a. d?
Mike Kaiser.
what are your badge numbers?
you're kidding, right?
I'm just following protocol.
look, man, whatever. just call our a. d.
he'll sort things out, huh?
uh, yeah, assistant director Kaiser, please.
Yeah, sir, hello. it's agent Nick Monroe.
I'm calling about... two of your men
Stiles and Murdock?
uh, it seems that they've been put on my case by mistake.
are you questioning my authority?
no, no, no, sir. I'm not questioning.
you could have fooled me.
last time I checked, son, d. c. has jurisdiction.
or am I wrong?
no, sir
well, good.
well, the next time you want to waste my time
with stupid questions, don't.
those idiots.
well, I'm sorry, guys.
just don't let it happen again.
so, where are you at with this?
where are you at with this?
well, I was about to run the perps' blood work.
I already checked. It's a dead end.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
well, get this -- I feel like I found something
that connects all the murderers.
Really?
they were all banging strippers
from the same club.
you don't say.
what do you say we go down there and check it out?
well, here's the thing, Nick.
see, we're kind of lone wolves
you know what?
that sounds like an excellent idea.
just give me a second with my partner.
and we'll, uh -- one second.
come here.
dude, you got to stay with him.
what? - keep him out of the way.
why me?
cause I got to get the blood samples.
what the hell am I supposed to do with him?
just take him to the strip club,
keep an eye out for the siren.
come on, Dean, just -- just focus on the naked girls.
you'll forget he's even there.
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for the girls.
we're taking my ride. No complaining about the tunes.
no way. you drive an impala?
Yeah.
it's a '67, right? it's a 327 4-barrel.
Yeah, actually.
it's a thing of beauty.
Thanks.
how the hell did you talk the bureau
into letting you drive your own wheels?
and you want this blood because...
we'd like to run some tests.
you know, I've run every test there is.
it's, um...my job.
notice the lab coat.
we know a specialist who would like to try out a theory.
if you say so.
what the hell?
what?
the blood's gone.
nobody's fault but mine.
Oh, oh, oh, zeppelin recorded it, '75.
it was a cover of a blind Willie Johnson tune.
nice.
you shook me.
Oh, '69, debut album, written by Willie Dixon.
And?
and what?
written by Willie Dixon and j. b. Lenoir.
dude.
dude!
you know, for a fed, you're not a total dick.
aren't we both feds?
Yeah. no, I just, you know
not a lot of feds as cool as us, huh?
so, what the hell with this case, man?
how does a girl talk four different johns into murder?
crazy world.
I guess.
Hey, can I level with you? hmm.
I found something kind of weird.
you brought your weird to the right spot.
lay it on me.
I went to the crime scene this morning.
saw them bagging this up.
so I went back through all the files.
it turns out a flower just like that
was found at every crime scene.
like it was left on purpose?
I mean, you know, sometimes a serial killer
will leave an object behind, like a calling card.
but with this case?
to tell you the truth...
I got no idea what's going on.
I think I might.
I've seen a flower like this before.
we've watched them twice.
whoever took the blood...
must have tampered with the tapes.
who has access to your office?
everyone. I don't lock it.
you what?
I've never had this problem before.
what is so important about the blood, anyway?
I think someone drugged the men made them commit murder.
what?
what kind of drug?
uh, I'm not sure yet.
I don't know.
I mean, I interviewed those guys,
and they had their reasons.
Yeah, but they all loved their victims.
I'm sure they did.
come on.
haven't you ever been in a relationship
where you really loved somebody
and still kind of wanted to bash their head in?
sounds like you're speaking from experience.
look, I'm sorry. I-I don't mean to pry.
it's okay.
I was the one who brought it up.
Really?
it's medicine.
I'm a doctor.
his name was Carl.
and we were married.
so what happened?
life happened.
I don't know. I mean, I loved him.
I still do, I guess.
but, um, I don't know.
it's just like one day I looked up,
and I was living with a stranger.
and...
you know what I mean, right?
I guess.
or...I don't know. maybe.
people change.
God, I know I did.
but it's nothing to feel guilty about.
it happens.
so you two split up?
Yeah, I suppose that's a word for it.
you need to get that?
no.
not right now.
whatever.
we've all got our own sad stories, so...
...screw it.
have fun, no regrets,
and live life like there's no tomorrow.
for instance,
I have been thinking about you all night.
well...
parts of you.
just parts?
like your lips.
they're very distracting.
it's a problem.
and I can't stop thinking about kissing them.
that so?
so...
...what the hell, huh?
Sam, where the hell have you been?
with Cara.
Oh, it's "Cara" now.
and you're not picking up your phone.
we were trying to find the blood samples.
someone stole them. - yeah, I'll bet.
what's that supposed to mean?
Nick found flower petals at the crime scenes.
hyacinths.
so? - hyacinths?
Mediterranean, from the -- from the island
where the whole freakin' siren myth started in the first place
okay.
Sam, Cara had hyacinth flowers.
you think Cara's the siren?
well, I did a little checking up on her.
she's only been in town for two months.
Yeah, and?
and she has an ex-husband.
a dead ex-husband -- Carl Roberts.
dropped like a stone, no warning,
supposedly a heart attack.
well, maybe it was a heart attack.
you're kidding me.
look, I just don't think it's her.
and what makes you so sure?
I don't know. A hunch.
a hunch?
I'm giving you cold, hard facts here,
and you're giving me a hunch?
did you sleep with her?
no.
holy crap, you did.
middle of "basic instinct" and you bang Sharon Stone?
Sam, you could be under her spell right now.
dude, I'm not under her spell.
unbelievable, man. I just don't get it.
what?
nothing.
no. say it.
no, it's just
first it's Madison, and then Ruby, and now Cara.
it's like what is with you and banging monsters?
look, Dean, I'm telling you. it's not Cara.
I feel fine.
I'll bet you do.
you don't trust me.
no. because this could be the siren talking.
look, just tell me where you are.
I'll come meet you, and we'll figure things out.
no.
are you serious?
I wish I weren't.
I got to handle this, Sam, by myself.
Sam's in trouble, Bobby.
I think the siren's worked her mojo on him.
give me a call as soon as you get this.
Hey, man. what's up?
I need your help.
uh, sure. with what?
canvassing. we got to find somebody.
she went in just a second ago.
nice work.
should we follow her in?
no, no, no. I don't want to tip her off.
I'm just waiting to see who she comes out with.
so you think, what...
she's drugging these guys?
pretty much.
I know how it sounds.
are you sure about that?
cause it sounds like crazy on toast.
all these different strippers
they're magically the same girl.
but then they're not strippers at all
it's Dr. Quinn?
it's kind of hard to explain,
but I have my reasons, and they're good ones.
so you're just gonna have to trust me on it.
Yeah.
okay.
I guess.
thank you.
that's actually nice to hear.
so, let's say she is drugging her vics.
how's she pulling that off?
she could be injecting them,
you know, or passing the toxin through physical contact.
or it could be her saliva.
you really should have wiped the lip of that thing
before you drank from it, Dean.
I should be your little brother.
Sam...
...you can't trust him.
not like you can trust me.
in fact, I really feel
like you should get him out of the way
so that we can be brothers...
forever.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Nick, what are you doing here?
Dean?
I got to tell you, you're one butt-ugly stripper.
well, maybe.
but I got exactly what I wanted.
I got Dean.
Dean, come on, man.
this isn't you. you can fight this.
let me go.
why don't you cut him
just a little on his neck right there?
Dean's all mine.
you poisoned him.
no, I gave him what he needed.
and it wasn't some bitch in a g-string.
it was you.
a little brother that looked up to him
that he could trust.
and now he loves me.
he'd do anything for me.
and I got to tell you, Sam,
that kind of devotion
watching someone kill for you...
...is the best feeling in the world.
is that why you're slutting all over town?
I get bored.
like we all do.
and I want to fall in love again
and again and again.
tell you what, I have fought some nasty sons of bitches,
but you are one needy, pathetic loser.
you won't feel that way in a minute.
no, no.
so, I know you two
have a lot you want to get off your chests.
so why don't you discuss it...
and whoever survives can be with me forever?
well, I don't know when it happened.
maybe when I was in hell.
maybe when I was staring right at you.
but the Sam I knew, he's gone.
that so?
and it's not the demon blood or the psychic crap.
it's the little stuff
the lies, the secrets.
Oh, yeah?
what secrets?
phone calls to Ruby, for one.
so I need your say-so to make a phone call?
that's the point.
you're hiding things from me.
what else aren't you telling me?
none of your business.
see what I mean?
we used to be in this together.
we used to have each other's backs!
okay, fine.
you want to know why I didn't tell you about Ruby?
and how we're hunting down Lilith?
because you're too weak to go after her, Dean.
you're holding me back.
I'm a better hunter than you are
stronger, smarter.
I can take out demons you're too scared to go near.
that's crap.
you're too busy sitting around
feeling sorry for yourself,
whining about all the souls you tortured in hell.
you're not standing in my way anymore.
do it for me, Dean.
tell me again how weak I am, Sam, huh?
how I hold you back.
no.
No!
Thanks.
soda?
you boys are driving, ain't ya?
Thanks, Bobby.
you know, you -- you hadn't shown up when you did
done the same for me, more than once.
of course, you could have picked up a phone.
only took one call to figure out
that agent Nick Monroe wasn't real.
you boys gonna be okay?
Yeah, fine.
Yeah, good.
you know, those sirens are nasty things.
that it got to you -- that's no reason to feel bad.
you gonna say goodbye to Cara?
Nah.
not interested.
Really? Why not?
what's the point?
well, look at you. love 'em and leave 'em.
Dean, look, you know I didn't mean
the things I said back there, right?
that it was just the siren's spell talking?
of course. me too.
okay.
so -- so we're good?
Yeah, we're good.
gunshot wound to the right frontal area. No exit wound found.
Hello, Mr. Singer.
your time's up.
idjits.
what's it gonna be?
stay or go?
you lied to me. And you killed my friend.
killing Amy was not wrong.
you couldn't do it, so I did.
tell you the truth, I don't know why I'm doing much of anything anymore.
here's my advice you didn't ask for... quit.
What?! It's not even an option.
I'm not gonna walk out on my brother.
do what I did.
decide to be fine until the end of the week.
make yourself smile because you're alive and that's your job.
and do it again the next week. Do it right... with a smile.
or don't do it.
barb, that you?
morning.
was that Bobby's?
I didn't know you kept that.
Yeah, mine sprung a leak.
you know, most people would just carry a - a photo or something for a memento.
shut up, man. I'm...I'm honoring the guy. All right?
this is, uh, grief therapy. Kind of like you and your wild-goose chase.
wild-goose chase? - Yeah.
four guys murdered in two weeks, hands and feet cut off.
well, some guy with a foot fetish run amuck.
grown men thrown so hard they went through walls.
did you... did you even read the article?
no, I was napping.
well, anyway... What else you got going on?
Dick Roman's a dead end for now. We might as well...
stay busy. - Exactly.
the latest but probably not the last.
you guys always work this late?
hours suck. Yeah, but great benefits package.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah. 10% co-pay on all drugs.
Seriously? Oh, but just generic, right?
no, no, name brands are cool.
so... What's our boy here weigh?
a buck 90.
thrown against a wall so hard it buckled.
based on the blood flow at the crime scene, the hands and feet were cut off while he was still alive, just like the others.
the killer wanted him to suffer.
and all the vics were male, right? With the, uh, same kind of artwork as this?
Yeah. Identical.
so, uh, DNA left at any of the scenes?
all of them. One before this, the guy bit the attacker.
still had a chunk of flesh in his teeth when he came in.
that's about as good as it gets.
right. So, we have a match?
we do not. Samples were rejected.
the genetic markers don't match anything we've ever seen.
didn't match any person in the database?
no. I mean, they don't match anything human.
I'll admit, it could be in the general vicinity of the ballpark of our kind of thing.
Yeah, uh,"didn't match anything human" usually seals the deal for me.
I don't know. I've never seen this symbol before.
let's get a bite to eat, go back to the motel, haul out the laptop.
that's a great idea. Actually, that's a brilliant idea.
here's my counter.
you do that, I'll go undercover, go mingle amongst the locals, and see what kind of clues bubble to the surface.
you're going to a bar.
if you want to oversimplify it.
dinner and a movie. Which sounded fine...
except the movie was "Human Centipede.
well, so, wait. Uh, so you had a problem with that?
the date from hell.
dating, right?
but what's the option?
I don't see settling down anytime soon.
well, that's something you don't hear every day.
Oh, what? Are you ready for the big commit?
me?
not exactly.
nice suit, by the way.
guys don't dress up much. I like it.
Yeah, well, it's, uh, a conservative line of work.
what line is that?
investment banking.
Oh, God. - Thanks.
I hear the hours are ridic. - Yeah.
but there's money to be made.
I've had a fortunate year.
well...
may you have many more.
Arigatou.
you speak Japanese? - Ah, enough to get by.
well...
look at you. - Yeah, look at me.
so...
you want to move this conversation elsewhere?
Hi. Telling me no lies what can I do for you?
you look like crap.
Yeah, well, I feel worse than I look.
I do recommend the Cobalt Room, by the way. Awesome night.
although I think I'm getting too old for this.
did you, uh, figure out that symbol? - No.
um, we're gonna need an expert.
expert? Our expert's dead.
comes off the wall down here...
well, nice decor. Very early slaughterhouse.
FBI.
guys, this is Charlene Penn. She's the lead on the case.
more of the same.
uh, no forced entry. Thrown across the room. Made to suffer.
both hands and feet cut off.
same symbol in the chest.
whoever the killer is, the guy's a monster.
excuse me.
this guy's just like the last one. Early 30s, decent-looking?
Yeah. Just like the first three, you know?
fairly successful, no known enemies.
here.
excuse me. I got it.
how can I help you?
I was just trying to find out what happened.
Jerry was a friend.
I'm very sorry. Jerry was killed sometime last night.
do you live nearby?
Yeah. Two doors down.
you, uh, you know anyone who would want to harm Jerry?
no. He was the nicest guy in the world.
well, his... his wife wasn't real happy with him.
Why's that?
a few nights ago, he has a little one-night fling.
Ann found out, took off.
but... She would never do anything like...
Yeah. Of course. Thanks.
who was that?
neighbor. Said the vic's wife caught him cheating.
Yeah, but we're not thinking it's the wife.
not unless she benches 350 and did the other guys as a warm-up.
shoot.
I left Bobby's flask over at Lydia's.
my workout partner from last night. Now I've got to go get it.
so, not only do you know her name, you're actually gonna call her?
bite me.
sweet... she gave you her number.
they always give you their number.
Hello? - Lydia.
Hey, it's, uh, Dean from last night.
uh, listen, I think I left something over at your place. It was an old flask.
it doesn't look like much, but it has sentimental value.
so, uh, have you seen it?
no.
but if I do, I'll call.
you want my number? - My cell grabbed it.
sorry. I gotta go. Just real busy at the moment.
she's real busy.
breathe.
control, Lydia.
as in all things.
one final push.
the pain is an honor.
what will we call her?
you'll call her Emma.
next.
fascinating.
truly.
and actually, rather accomplished draftsmanship.
Yeah, if you get past the fact that it was carved into a guy's body.
professor Morrison, we're hoping you can tell us what the symbol means.
Yeah, maybe.
maybe?
it's possible I could, even likely.
is the FBI offering suitable remuneration?
the respect of a grateful nation.
and a good word with the I. R.S.
well, it appears quite ancient.
well, that narrows it down.
a corrupted version of symbology associated with worship.
definitely an obscure regional script.
Oh, this will require some research.
all right. Great.
well, uh, I guess we'll be seeing you tomorrow.
Tomorrow?!
I've spent entire sabbaticals on a project like this.
professor!
we have a serial killer on our hands.
your government needs you, sir.
gentlemen My housekeeper needs a green card.
good God, where'd you find this guy? He's supposed to be a top expert in his field.
Yeah, well, when his field includes things that go bump in the night, he's gonna be worth the breath we just wasted.
so, what are we supposed to do, Dean? Spin our wheels?
Sam, this is us spinning our wheels, okay?!
Dean, you know what? I want to call him, too, okay? Believe me.
but Bobby's not here. So we're settling.
Yeah. We sure are.
damn it, why hasn't she called?
who? Lydia?
wait, so some girl's actually dumping you the morning after?
I think you're enjoying this a little more than you need to.
screw it. I'm going over there and getting the flask.
I guess you didn't get my messages. - No, I did.
I've been busy.
anyway, I,uh, left that flask over here the other night.
Yes. I found it.
it was so beat up and old, I almost tossed it.
Yeah, well, guy it belonged to was beat up and old, too.
but I was very close with him, and I'd, uh, I'd hate to lose it.
I'll get it for you.
so, how you been?
other than "busy.
just that. Really busy. Here you go.
I can see why you're busy. You've been babysitting, huh?
no.
yours?
you didn't tell me you had a little girl.
there's probably all kinds of things we didn't tell each other.
what's her name?
Hi, Emma. Your first?
Yes.
well, I hear they grow like weeds.
you have no idea.
sorry. I got to take this.
hello.
Hey. Where are you? It's a flask, not the holy grail.
Hey, man, I'm a people person, all right? I'm engaging in some social skills.
you get anything out of Morrison?
no. Not yet.
look, would you get back here? We're due at the crime lab.
Dean? - Hang on.
Hey, look, why don't you just...
who's that guy in the other room?
who is that? - You there?
don't talk. We'll discuss it later.
Hello! - Let me call you back.
so, again, we got a guy weighing about two bills...
thrown into a wall so hard, he's got pieces of plaster lodged in his skull.
what triggered the Feds' involvement in this case?
I always think you boys have bigger fish to fry.
no. Actually, we...
I just figured it was the similarity to the other cold cases?
if it's the same killer, then he crossed state lines... that would bring you guys in.
well, that's exactly right. Uh, what he said.
Yeah. Whatever. You're gonna have to wrap this up.
your case isn't the only one we're working on.
you get used to her.
uh, so, Eddie, by the way, I didn't bring the cold-case files with me.
is there a chance you have a copy? - Yeah.
great.
the Cobalt Room.
Yeah, it's pretty well known.
looking to hook up, it's a pretty good place to go.
I've heard.
vic number two was there. And according to his security guard, he left with a hot girl.
two days later, he's an obituary.
same with Jerry Price.
and, uh, as far as we can tell, at least a couple of those in there.
same thing in Chicago. - Yep.
a lot of busted marriages, flings with unknown women, that kind of thing, all just before they got offed.
Thanks.
is Emma ready? - Yes. Come in.
thank you.
Yeah. - Dude. You never showed.
I'm outside Lydia's.
Oh, come on, man. What, are you obsessed or something?
no, I'm telling you. I have been eating at the buffet of strange all afternoon.
meaning what?
I'll tell you the second I know. But something ain't right.
or you're obsessed. - Shut up. I'm serious.
okay, uh, you need backup or... - No, not yet.
what's up on your end?
apparently, there was an identical murder fest two years years ago in Chicago, and again in Miami two years before that.
all the victims were young, successful, a lot of them went to the same bar.
it lines up. The trails always went cold fast.
yeah? - Yeah. Oh, and by the way...
as a personal kicker, here, at least some of the vics hooked up in that bar you went to, the, uh, the Cobalt Room.
so, just saying, man, you you dodged a bullet.
got to go.
nice talk.
Emma, hurry up.
come on, Emma. Time to go.
you be a good girl.
make us proud. - I will, mommy.
Bye, Emma.
I hate when this happens.
so what? I mean, so maybe she has another kid she didn't tell you about.
Nope, just the one. Emma.
but that night, when I was with her, she didn't have any.
and I was at her place, man. There was no playpens, no blankets, no rubber ducks. Right.
like you would have been focused on that kind of thing.
Hey, dude, that's the first thing you notice. Red flags.
then, all of a sudden, boom... baby.
Yeah, the one you thought talked. - Oh, it talked.
and not baby talk, either.
now you know so much about child development?
I know enough to know that they don't say, Hey, Mom. Who's that guy?
so, cut to... Lydia's handing this kid who's calling her mommy over to these two women, right?
but this is not a baby.
no, no, this kid's got to be 5... And same name... Emma.
you know, George Foreman named all his sons George.
are you deliberately messing with me?
dude, I know weird. Okay?
there is no non-weird explanation for this.
this morning, Emma was a baby.
by sunset, she's Hannah Montana. Early years.
it's the Professor. - Good. The Professor.
Yeah. I'm sure he'll crack this wide open.
on this special night, you join an exceptional family.
you are ready to take your places alongside us and learn our traditions.
this is a tribute to the one who created and protects us.
we hunt for her. We kill for her.
and now we consume that kill as a symbol of unity with those who have completed their blood missions and furthered the life of the tribe.
go ahead, Emma.
you need to eat.
you know, identifying the scroll was no day at the beach.
lesser scholars would have crumbled.
professor... The symbol?
Yeah. Yeah. It's ancient, regional.
very difficult to identify.
but I managed to find a match.
it's a variation of a symbol associated with the Greek Pantheon, the temple of the goddess Harmonia.
according to myth, the coupling of Harmonia and Ares, the God of war, produced the Amazons.
the Amazons? - Like Wonder Woman?
no, like...like a tribe of warriors.
they actually existed. The comic books... they're just silly perversions.
the symbol... I believe it originated with the Amazons.
pictographs meant to pay homage to Harmonia...
occult talismans, if you will.
they had an exclusively female culture.
no use for men whatsoever, except procreation.
all the vics were male.
so you said... with this symbol carved in their chests.
and their hands and feet cut off. - Now, that is interesting.
got our attention.
after they were impregnated, they killed the male...
first cutting off certain body parts.
I couldn't check their I. D.s because everything they have is fake.
I've been digging for hours.
and one thing's for sure... they ain't FBI.
and who are they?
they're after us, is what they are.
remember that cross-country murder spree those crazy brothers went on a couple months ago?
that's them? - Barely scratches the surface.
they're thugs. Vigilantes.
but, look, we've dealt with hunters like this before.
well... The one is already scheduled to be taken care of.
we'll just simply add the other one to the agenda.
I know Bobby's got a Grecian encyclopedia of weird in here.
I saw it last time I was looking through this stupid...
would it kill him to have a system?
he has a system. His files are set up like his brain.
you got anything?
uh, yeah.
there's this whole crazy side to Amazon lore that Professor Morrison didn't even mention.
that's 'cause he doesn't believe in it, which is a real handicap when you're trying to deal with it.
right. Um, apparently, there was this long, bloody war.
the Amazon population was decimated, so they made a bargain with Harmonia to replenish their ranks and make them stronger.
well, I'd say throwing grown men through walls was stronger.
Yeah. Well, basically, they became more than human.
Harmonia turned them into monsters.
can you kill them like humans? Or is there some kind of trick?
uh doesn't say. No idea. I guess it could go either way.
well, that's helpful. What else?
the lore says they reproduced quickly...
as in, after mating, they gave birth within 36 hours.
the babies grew incredibly fast, then the aging process became normal.
which is one way to make an army, I guess.
the mating cycle is every two years.
they send out all the women who have reached child-bearing age.
which lines up,'cause this happens every couple of years in different towns, right?
Yeah.
and we know for sure that at least some of the vics hooked up with strange women days before being killed Amazon style.
hooked up in the same bar I met Lydia, right?
Yeah.
and then suddenly, she's got a little baby in like fruit-fly time.
that baby turns into a little girl just as fast.
so maybe you're... - Don't say it.
look, if that kid's yours... - I said don't say it!
fine. I won't. But, Dean...
dude, seriously, a one-night stand, you're just gonna... Roll the dice? You don't even...
of course not... Sam.
what, do you think I'm brain-dead?
accidents happen.
if one even did, which I-I-I don't think...
no. You know what? Stop. We're not gonna talk about this anymore because my skin's starting to crawl!
all right, fine. But if it's true, if it happened...
I know. I got to hang on to my hands and feet.
we are so pleased with your progress.
you are absorbing the traditions of our mothers,
today, you are a warrior.
though you may walk among others, your heart is only with the tribe.
soon, you will take the final, glorious step into adulthood.
today, you will learn how to endure pain and how to inflict it.
fight it, Emma.
as with all you do, courage is everything.
looking through Bobby's files is like dumpster diving.
Yeah, tell me about it.
so, it makes sense why the Amazons all want to hook up with decent-looking, successful guys.
Oh, they're picky about the gene pool? - Right.
so What was Lydia doing with you?
well, she may or may not have thought I was a rich investment banker.
Sam. - Yeah.
these papers just moved.
what? - I didn't touch them.
it's all over the place.
redline.
redline.
Oh, and...
power lines by the open window, where there's a breeze... That could have moved the papers.
did you feel a breeze? - It doesn't matter, Dean. The readings are useless.
Hey. Maybe, uh...
we burned him, Dean.
so what? - So, what are you suggesting?
I don't know. What are you?
concentrate on something else. - Why?
because it's not Bobby!
could be. - No, it couldn't be.
why not? - Because we want it to be.
maybe it's useful.
it's in a pile of "maybe it's useful.
besides, it's in Greek. Nobody reads Greek.
Yeah, except Greeks. Oh, and Bobby.
and Professor Morrison.
Really? - I'm going, Dean.
you stay here, keep the door locked. Don't go anywhere.
I mean it. - Fine.
Oh, you have got to be kidding. I have office hours tomorrow...
I'm sorry, Professor. I need your help.
the FBI isn't paying me enough for this.
all right. I'll sweeten the deal.
we'll remove your wiretap.
you don't know me, but my name is Emma.
I need your help.
I think I'm in trouble, and you're the only person I can trust.
Why?
because you're my father.
how'd you find me?
they've been watching you, ever since mom got pregnant.
well, if you're such a prisoner, you mind telling me how you escaped?
I waited until lights out.
the women who watch over us change shifts a little after 10: 00.
and you left because...?
they stick you in there, and you trust them.
it's all you know.
and you don't question what they want you to do...
terrible things.
that's why I had to leave.
they tortured me.
they told me I had to endure pain so I could be strong like them.
but I don't want to be like them.
okay. Come on in.
have a seat.
okay.
let's assume that you're not... Like them.
yet.
what do you want me to do?
get me away from here.
you're a good man.
my mother told me that.
I seriously doubt she said that.
and if you knew me, you would seriously doubt it's true.
they told me you're a hunter.
so maybe you'll understand about me. Maybe you can protect me.
just long enough so I can get away.
then I'll leave you alone.
I know you don't want me.
all right, let's not... Go there, okay?
this isn't a matter of...
you get this isn't a normal situation, right?
how would I know?
three days ago, I wasn't even alive.
now here I am.
my mother threw me into that place. And my father...
well...
you get this is my last chance to have anything normal ever, right?
it's fascinating. - What's it say?
Oh, I haven't gotten there yet. The paper is handmade.
a cellulose, rather like papyrus, which would explain its durability.
professor... - Wherever did you get it?
a crazy, drunk, old genius.
Yeah. They always have the good stuff.
well, it's in Greek.
Yeah, yeah. I-I know that.
not a common dialect.
my God, what is it with you and Amazons?
professor, it's important.
at 11: 30 at night, it better be.
Oh, here's a new twist. It repeats the conventional lore.
amazon warriors mate with males. The males are murdered.
yada, yada. But according to this... It's not the women who do the killing.
instead, a ritual of initiation requires that the child born of the mating process must kill her own father.
what?
you look exhausted.
and starving?
it's been a tough sweet 16.
so you believe me?
you'll help me?
if you really want help.
detective. - Agent. You're here late.
Yeah. Listen, could we talk in the morning?
what's your hurry...
let's see. I could run you in for impersonating a federal agent.
well, now, what happens when they find out you're missing?
they may have already found out.
and they'll hunt me down.
look, I know this is gonna be hard, but if I'm gonna get out, I have to do it now.
we got cheese and a leftover burrito.
doesn't make a difference.
you were asking if I believed you.
I was told you'd be a challenge.
I figured you'd chat me up...
try and catch me off guard.
almost worked. I was expecting your mother.
it's not her place.
I have to kill you.
is that what they told you? - It's what I am.
well, then, I should just kill you right now. - Sure.
but you could have done that 30 seconds ago.
it's weirdly hard, isn't it?
it is for me. - Knock it off.
how could it not be? You're my father.
we're not gonna do that. - But it's true.
you're the reason that we're standing here.
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
so now someone has to kill someone.
you know what?
so far, my childhood's been kind of disappointing.
you haven't killed anybody yet, Emma.
walk away.
right now... I won't go after you.
I can't.
I don't have a choice.
please don't let him hurt me.
here's the mother ship.
let's get this done.
they're gone.
Hey, you know what? I don't like it, either.
I wanted to torture them just as much as you.
Yeah, but, hey...
next time they surface, we'll be ready...
if we live that long.
all right, fine. Just sit there and be pissed.
what did you say to me... When I was the one who choked?
what did you say about Amy? "You kill the monster!
I was going to! - Oh, the hell you were!
you think I'm an idiot? - What, you think i am?
Dean, you were gonna let her walk!
no, I wasn't. That's ridiculous!
look, man, she was not yours. Not really.
actually, she, uh, she was, really.
she just also happened to be a crazy man-killing monster. But, uh, hey.
you know what? Bobby was right.
your head's not in it, man. When Cass died, you were wobbly, but now...
now what?
Oh, what, you're dealing with it so perfect?
Yeah, news flash, pal... you're just as screwed up as I am!
you're just... Bigger.
What?! - I don't know.
look... Dean, the thing is, tonight...
it almost got you killed.
now, I don't care how you deal. I really, really don't.
but just don't... don't get killed.
I'll do what I can.
well, what's that supposed to mean?
it means I'll do what I can. All right? You can shut up about it.
how does a high-school dropout become one of the brightest minds at Roman, Inc?
historically, I've had this problem with -- with authority.
is there such a thing as a monster magnet?
when did you become such an expert?
after you guys left, I dug into all things monstrous.
I'm a wee bit obsessive...
if "a wee bit" means completely.
there is a big difference between reading about hunting and actually hunting.
I'm -- I'm more hunter-in-training.
totally not worth killing.
you know, you really should come back and dig through our archives.
you are definitely a Woman of Letters.
I like the sound of that.
it is the safest place on earth, warded against any evil ever created.
it is the supernatural mother lode.
if knowledge is power, then this is the most powerful place on Earth.
Sammy, I think we found the Bat Cave.
protocol's complete. James Haggerty.
did we do everything right?
shouldn't...
took three years to build this dump?
dump?
dump?
are you kidding?
do you realize where we are?
this -- this dump is the last true beacon of light in a world gone topsy-turvy.
this dump is the epicenter of -- of the ultimate chess match between good and evil.
what a dump.
you know, when I got this assignment,
I thought there'd be,
I don't know, excitement, adventure.
there's nothing worse than adventure, my boy.
trust me.
extension 765.
Yes.
no. That's not the password.
there's protocol here, young lady.
we'll be waiting.
we have a guest -- damn hunter.
Frank's kid.
Really?
what he did for her -- t-that was really something.
he was something, all right.
holy buckets.
it's really you.
that's right, rookie.
it's really me -- Dorothy.
now, which one of you geniuses is gonna help me kill the wicked witch?
Hello, Moose.
you want more demon names.
I want a room with a view.
we can discuss this.
I'd settle for stretching my legs.
bollocks.
Hey.
how'd it go with Kevin?
how's he feeling?
well, he stared at the Angel tablet and repeated the word "falafe" for the entire ride.
kid's cracked.
I'm hoping this break will, uh, clear his head.
you know, after everything that happened,
figured we'd get a little takeout. -- All right.
well, first, I think I might have found a way to help Cass.
did you talk to him?
no.
and, by the way, I still don't understand why he left in the first place.
I mean, the bunker is the safest place for him.
Bartholomew and -- and who knows how many other angels are out there, gunning for them.
Hey, look, nobody wants him here more than I do, okay?
but, uh, he felt like he'd bring trouble down on us, so he had to split.
but if you got a way to help him, I'm all ears.
so, Kevin said the table lit up like a Christmas tree when the angels fell, right?
so?
so it turns out each light was where a cluster of angels fell.
so I'm thinking maybe there's some way to hot-wire this, make it track angels.
that way, we could help Cass steer clear of danger.
this was...your idea?
do you see anybody else in here?
so, how would it work? -- Oh, no idea.
see, at first, I thought the table was the computer, but it's not.
it turns out it's just part of it.
but I did find these cables underneath, and I followed them.
you're never gonna believe what I found.
Voilà.
this is a computer?
yeah -- or it was in 1951, when it was installed.
now, here's the crazy thing.
it's not plugged in to anything.
I mean, I have no idea what's making this thing work.
it's warm here.
got it.
well, that looks simple.
does it come with a manual?
nothing in the archives, and I obviously couldn't find anything like it online,
I think I know somebody who could help us.
come on.
so, what do you have to say for yourself?
nothing. I cut out her tongue.
I've bound her, but it won't last.
you captured her all by yourself? -- Yes.
despite all my lady parts, I managed to capture the wicked witch.
your father would be very proud.
I mean, did you know that he -- Wasted my time with his words.
and I'd appreciate it if you didn't do the same.
now, I have tried cutting off her head, burning her, dousing her with holy water.
all she did was laugh.
nothing I know of can kill her.
so I'm here as a last resort.
I was hoping you stiffs have a way to kill someone from Oz.
well, of course we do. W-we have to.
this place is the last true beacon of light.
all right. Just open your damn books already.
all right, Jenkins.
let's go to work.
here it is.
Hey.
thanks for coming.
not a problem, especially since I got fired last week.
Hey, what? What happened?
turns out the company I work for was outsourcing to child labor, so I took a big Wikileak all over that.
and, yeah.
it's cool, though.
it's given me more time to focus on my hobbies...
...like larping, macrame, and hunting.
excuse me?
okay. It was just a couple little cases.
I took down a teenage vampire and a ghost...
...which sounds like a Y. A. novel if you say it out loud.
Charlie, how'd it go?
it was, uh...
it was intense.
but I kind of wish hunting was more...magical, you know?
never mind.
so, where is this Commodore 64 of yours?
sweet Ada Lovelace.
this thing belongs in a museum.
I mean, it's got encryption software.
it seems to be powered by something magical.
skip to the end.
it's kind of an alarm system.
global badness? It freaks.
this computer is what locked this place down.
can we use it to track angels?
all right.
let me see what I can do.
all right.
it took some doing, but now we can download.
this beast has all the Men of Letters files.
time for a little drag-and-drop.
Wow. Well, it's a start.
thank you.
um, that's -- that's great.
so, you've been hunting.
alone.
I know.
not even I can do that.
come on.
where do you even find them?
a top-secret place I call Amazon.
and someone uploaded all the unpublished works.
I thought it was fanfic at first, but it was clearly Edlund's work.
who uploaded it?
I don't know.
their screen name was beckywinchester176.
ring a bell?
none. Uh, nobody's.
uh, no, there are no bells.
Uh...No.
Ugh, these files are encrypted.
this is gonna take a while.
so, takeout, sleepover, braid each other's hair?
got an idea.
Wow. That Joffrey's a dick.
Oh, you have no idea.
wait until he...
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! S-spoilers.
I haven't read all the books yet.
you're gonna read the books?
Yes, Dean.
I like to read books,
you know, the ones without pictures.
man, this bed is about as comfortable as a brick.
any plans on moving in anytime soon?
I am moved in. This is just my style.
Yeah, this is his, uh, style.
this isn't our home. This is where we work.
what's the difference?
okay.
all right, well, I'm gonna go get us some more beers.
how about that?
what was all that about how hunting isn't magical?
saving people, hunting things, the family business?
I am down.
but...
I was raised on Tolkien, man.
I mean, where is all this?
where...
Where's my quest?
magic, quests...suck.
they're all...
dead ends.
nothing but dead ends.
there's got to be some way to kill this thing.
Jenkins, no!
there's something here that belongs to me.
take me to it.
what the hell's it talking about?
I have no idea.
do you have a lab?
second floor, room 28.
wait!
I know you're in there.
Jenkins is gone.
you were right.
there's nothing worse than adventure.
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
download should be done by now.
what the hell?
Sam, give me a hand.
holy crap!
the first case investigated in this bunker involved Dorothy.
she and the witch came into this room, and they never came out.
this will never stop blowing my mind!
okay, pace yourself, Toto.
how is this real? It's part of the fairy world.
we have to find her.
no, we have to talk before anyone does anything, okay?
Dorothy?
talk?
typical Men of Letters, standing around, having a nice, little chat with your noses buried in your books while your little secretary takes notes.
we're hunters.
and who are you calling a secretary?
you're not a secretary?
you're a Woman of Letters?
w-- how long have I been out?
that's why we need to talk.
look, you've been gone for over 75 years.
now, according to our files, you came here to kill the wicked witch and then disappeared.
what happened?
we couldn't find a way to kill her, so I did the only thing that I could.
it's you and me forever, bitch.
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
a binding spell that came at a price...
her soul with mine.
so you've been frozen with the witch for all this time?
Yes. Look, the witch cannot be killed.
if I am awake, then so is she.
Hello, lovely.
sorry.
this litter box is warded against everything, even wicked witches.
big fan. Love your work.
what's the matter, darling?
cowardly lion got your tongue?
right. Enough chitchat.
must be here for a reason.
write it down so daddy can help.
wait, if she's here, why didn't she kill you?
she can't.
you're protected by the Witch of the North's kiss.
it's from the books.
Oh, forget the books! They're not important.
I'm protected. You aren't.
now, the witch came here looking for something.
I have no idea what it is.
but we have to find her before she finds it.
all right, all right. Charlie, dig into the files.
see if you can find anything that puts a dent in a witch.
Sam and I will have a look-see. Come on.
I'm helping. -- Yeah, I don't doubt it.
but for right now, why don't you rest up and help the smartest person in the room?
so big fan.
Ozma of Oz is a total ass.
you were much nicer in the books.
those books are the ravings of a sad, old man -- my father.
wait. Your dad was L. Frank Baum, the writer?
a Man of Letters.
another glorified librarian, you ask me.
Hey, these guys may have been sexist, but like all librarians, they were wicked smart, too.
the dude who was here when you came in -- Haggerty
he kept your case file open, worked it every day until he retired.
obviously, he never found you, but if you took five seconds to read, he did find way to fight the Wicked Witch.
do you remember the poppy fields in the first book?
it was much bloodier.
stop ruining my childhood.
do you remember the poppies?
haggerty made a deal with a fairy and got some poppy extract.
so, are you coming or what?
Wow. If it isn't the Scarecrow and the Tin Man.
your new houseguest --so misunderstood.
neither of you saw "wicked"?
what did she say to you?
something along the lines of...
all right, well, I'm gonna go get some holy oil and a lighter, dick bag.
I know what she's looking for.
what does she want?
I'd be happy to tell you, as soon as I get to stretch my legs.
all right.
what does the witch want?
give me a mo.
I still need to air myself out.
I think you're aired out enough.
rude.
key? What key?
I haven't the foggiest.
told her you boys kept the keys in the kitchen.
you do have a kitchen in this crap hole, don't you?
damn it, I just cleaned in here.
Really?
looks like we got a witch here.
sorry. We raided your gun range.
that's my girl.
there was only enough for four bullets, so...
...make each shot count.
she's looking for a key.
how do you know?
little birdie told us.
ring any bells, Dorothy?
unfortunately.
it's the key to Oz.
there are magical ways into Oz
tornado, eye of a hurricane, whirlpool
but this key will turn any locked door into a portal to Oz.
insert key, twist, and presto, you're in Oz.
how did the Men of Letters get the key?
I have no idea, but if she finds it, she'll go back and finish what she started.
she'll destroy all that is good in Oz.
she's got armies of witches, flying monkeys.
many will die.
what's this key look like?
I've seen that key.
found it when I was doing inventory.
where is it now? -- My room.
we got to get to that key.
all right, Charlie and I will go look in my room.
why don't you guys buy us some time?
safest place in this joint is the dungeon.
you have a dungeon in this place?
of course you do.
so maybe you should...
I am not hiding, especially in a dungeon.
wicked Witch, a key, a quest?
let's do this.
I can't believe I've lived here for 75 years.
how long have you called this place home?
my brother calls it home.
me, I, uh
I haven't had that much luck with homes.
me neither. Overrated, you ask me.
yellow bricks or not, give me the open road any day.
she can get anywhere from there.
split up, cover more ground.
you keep your porn meticulously organized, but not...
don't judge me.
Yahtzee.
No!
No!
you have to help her.
she's gone.
every time I use my power, it weakens me,
the witch running around your bunker is very powerful.
I can help with the witch or save your friend.
save her.
as you wish.
merry Christmas.
uh. Hey, I know you.
bet you say that to all the girls.
what the hell just happened?
the witch -- the witch was about to put a whammy on me, and, uh, Charlie jumped in front.
she got zapped, then the witch got the drop on you.
then why aren't we dead?
that's a good question.
I, uh
I clipped her with a -- with a poppy bullet.
she got the key.
I think she's gone.
no. She's wounded.
we should still have some time.
she could still be in the air vents.
no. no, no. She's right. We -- we have to -- we
just go. We'll catch up.
m-my gun's over there.
there's one bullet in it.
can we be best friends now?
who's Zeke?
what?
when I came into your room,
who's that?
I think you're still a little punchy, man.
just keep moving.
I had the weirdest dream when I was out.
it was Christmas, and my parents were still alive, and
dream?
Charlie, you died.
don't worry about it, though.
you're not a real hunter until you've died and come back again.
slow down. Why would you think I died?
heaven -- it's your dream life.
and if you were zapped by the Wicked Witch
instant death.
I would know. She killed me, too.
when did you die?
in Oz.
my father was obsessed with his work as a Man of Letters, and then I was born ... and nothing changed.
he would keep his work a secret, but I was such a curious kid.
I was always looking for trouble, looking for the next big adventure.
I know the feeling.
I stowed away on one of his cases, wound up in the emerald city, accidentally got left behind.
it was terrifying.
well, what happened?
I met up with these three freedom fighters, and they thought I was this child of destiny chosen to kill the Wicked Witch.
they protected me, and then the witch turned them into...
a scarecrow, a tin man, and a lion?
and then she hunted me down and killed me.
sometimes real life is darker than fiction.
why haven't you moved in?
is now really the time for this, Dean?
well, just asking.
look, I never had what you had with mom and dad, okay?
what are you talking about?
I don't have any memories of home.
and whenever I've tried to make a home of my own, it really hasn't ended well.
I mean, this is about as close to home as we're gonna get, and it's ours.
and what about the books?
revisionist history.
but I knew the truth.
when the witch came to our world, I became a hunter, and my father wrote those silly books.
don't you get it?
the books aren't silly.
they're guidebooks filled with clues he left for you.
haggerty pored through each one, and his research led him to uncover the poppies, so maybe there's something else from the books we can use, preferably something with a pointy end.
you are a genius.
come on. We've got to get to the garage.
there's a garage in this place?!
Oh, boy.
clear.
I got nothing.
what do you think? Is she gone?
find the girls...
and kill them both.
Yes. I knew those boy scouts would keep it for me.
is that... -- Yeah.
he didn't make it.
please be here. Please be here.
Yes!
I don't believe it.
did you really walk down a brick road in these?
no. I never actually wore them.
seemed kind of tacky wearing a dead woman's shoes.
Plus, I'm no good in heels, you know?
I don't suppose we could just wish her away?
sorry. Another thing the books got wrong.
but, like the poppies, these have magic from Oz -- sharp magic.
Oh. Death by shoe?
there you are.
was that your Batman voice?
that's definitely not your Batman voice.
it's her. She possessed the both of them.
I missed you, my pretty.
killing you a second time will be just as sweet as the first.
guys, I know you're in there.
Dean, you can't let the witch do this.
if she opens the door, she's going to destroy Oz.
I have no intention of escaping to Oz.
I'm going to bring my armies here.
don't worry.
you'll join Dorothy right after you watch her die.
sorry about the nards, Dean.
go. I'll buy you some time.
all right.
let's see what you pencil necks are made of.
all right, let's do this the old-fashioned way.
my body cannot hurt you, Dorothy.
but theirs can.
now heel.
what the hell just happened?
ding-dong, bitches.
really, after all I did with Ms. defying gravity?
bollocks.
not bad.
Dorothy, I, uh...
I found something in the archives.
pretty sure it belongs to you.
you have no idea how odd it is having a series of books written about you.
actually, I-I do know, uh, and it is definitely weird.
but you know what?
end of the day, it's our story, so we get to write it.
so, thanks for the slumber party...
...and bringing me back from the dead.
uh, I didn't.
am I a zombie now?
do I need to eat brains?
no, no, no. You're you.
you're gonna be fine, all right?
just, um -- just keep this between us, okay?
all right, but only 'cause you raised me from the dead, which you're going to have to explain to me later.
all right.
not bad for a bunch of librarians.
you mind keeping an eye on my bike for me?
deal.
thank you for everything.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have a rebellion to finish.
so, you coming or what?
what? With you?
to Oz?
you have no idea what's in Oz.
I mean, t-there's flying monkeys, armies of witches.
there's all kinds of danger.
promise?
if you need anything, just, uh, tap your heels together three times, okay?
me? What about you crazy kids?
you gonna be all right without me?
take care of yourselves, boys.
think she'll be back?
what's up, bitches?
how does a high-school dropout become one of the brightest minds at Roman, Inc?
historically, I've had this problem with -- with authority.
is there such a thing as a monster magnet?
when did you become such an expert?
after you guys left, I dug into all things monstrous.
I'm a wee bit obsessive...
if "a wee bit" means completely.
there is a big difference between reading about hunting and actually hunting.
I'm -- I'm more hunter-in-training.
totally not worth killing.
you know, you really should come back and dig through our archives.
you are definitely a Woman of Letters.
I like the sound of that.
it is the safest place on earth, warded against any evil ever created.
it is the supernatural mother lode.
if knowledge is power, then this is the most powerful place on Earth.
Sammy, I think we found the Bat Cave.
protocol's complete. James Haggerty.
did we do everything right?
shouldn't...
took three years to build this dump?
dump?
dump?
are you kidding?
do you realize where we are?
this -- this dump is the last true beacon of light in a world gone topsy-turvy.
this dump is the epicenter of -- of the ultimate chess match between good and evil.
what a dump.
you know, when I got this assignment,
I thought there'd be,
I don't know, excitement, adventure.
there's nothing worse than adventure, my boy.
trust me.
extension 765.
Yes.
no. That's not the password.
there's protocol here, young lady.
we'll be waiting.
we have a guest -- damn hunter.
Frank's kid.
Really?
what he did for her -- t-that was really something.
he was something, all right.
holy buckets.
it's really you.
that's right, rookie.
it's really me -- Dorothy.
now, which one of you geniuses is gonna help me kill the wicked witch?
Hello, Moose.
you want more demon names.
I want a room with a view.
we can discuss this.
I'd settle for stretching my legs.
bollocks.
Hey.
how'd it go with Kevin?
how's he feeling?
well, he stared at the Angel tablet and repeated the word "falafe" for the entire ride.
kid's cracked.
I'm hoping this break will, uh, clear his head.
you know, after everything that happened,
figured we'd get a little takeout. -- All right.
well, first, I think I might have found a way to help Cass.
did you talk to him?
no.
and, by the way, I still don't understand why he left in the first place.
I mean, the bunker is the safest place for him.
Bartholomew and -- and who knows how many other angels are out there, gunning for them.
Hey, look, nobody wants him here more than I do, okay?
but, uh, he felt like he'd bring trouble down on us, so he had to split.
but if you got a way to help him, I'm all ears.
so, Kevin said the table lit up like a Christmas tree when the angels fell, right?
so?
so it turns out each light was where a cluster of angels fell.
so I'm thinking maybe there's some way to hot-wire this, make it track angels.
that way, we could help Cass steer clear of danger.
this was...your idea?
do you see anybody else in here?
so, how would it work? -- Oh, no idea.
see, at first, I thought the table was the computer, but it's not.
it turns out it's just part of it.
but I did find these cables underneath, and I followed them.
you're never gonna believe what I found.
Voilà.
this is a computer?
yeah -- or it was in 1951, when it was installed.
now, here's the crazy thing.
it's not plugged in to anything.
I mean, I have no idea what's making this thing work.
it's warm here.
got it.
well, that looks simple.
does it come with a manual?
nothing in the archives, and I obviously couldn't find anything like it online,
I think I know somebody who could help us.
come on.
so, what do you have to say for yourself?
nothing. I cut out her tongue.
I've bound her, but it won't last.
you captured her all by yourself? -- Yes.
despite all my lady parts, I managed to capture the wicked witch.
your father would be very proud.
I mean, did you know that he -- Wasted my time with his words.
and I'd appreciate it if you didn't do the same.
now, I have tried cutting off her head, burning her, dousing her with holy water.
all she did was laugh.
nothing I know of can kill her.
so I'm here as a last resort.
I was hoping you stiffs have a way to kill someone from Oz.
well, of course we do. W-we have to.
this place is the last true beacon of light.
all right. Just open your damn books already.
all right, Jenkins.
let's go to work.
here it is.
Hey.
thanks for coming.
not a problem, especially since I got fired last week.
Hey, what? What happened?
turns out the company I work for was outsourcing to child labor, so I took a big Wikileak all over that.
and, yeah.
it's cool, though.
it's given me more time to focus on my hobbies...
...like larping, macrame, and hunting.
excuse me?
okay. It was just a couple little cases.
I took down a teenage vampire and a ghost...
...which sounds like a Y. A. novel if you say it out loud.
Charlie, how'd it go?
it was, uh...
it was intense.
but I kind of wish hunting was more...magical, you know?
never mind.
so, where is this Commodore 64 of yours?
sweet Ada Lovelace.
this thing belongs in a museum.
I mean, it's got encryption software.
it seems to be powered by something magical.
skip to the end.
it's kind of an alarm system.
global badness? It freaks.
this computer is what locked this place down.
can we use it to track angels?
all right.
let me see what I can do.
all right.
it took some doing, but now we can download.
this beast has all the Men of Letters files.
time for a little drag-and-drop.
Wow. Well, it's a start.
thank you.
um, that's -- that's great.
so, you've been hunting.
alone.
I know.
not even I can do that.
come on.
where do you even find them?
a top-secret place I call Amazon.
and someone uploaded all the unpublished works.
I thought it was fanfic at first, but it was clearly Edlund's work.
who uploaded it?
I don't know.
their screen name was beckywinchester176.
ring a bell?
none. Uh, nobody's.
uh, no, there are no bells.
Uh...No.
Ugh, these files are encrypted.
this is gonna take a while.
so, takeout, sleepover, braid each other's hair?
got an idea.
Wow. That Joffrey's a dick.
Oh, you have no idea.
wait until he...
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! S-spoilers.
I haven't read all the books yet.
you're gonna read the books?
Yes, Dean.
I like to read books,
you know, the ones without pictures.
man, this bed is about as comfortable as a brick.
any plans on moving in anytime soon?
I am moved in. This is just my style.
Yeah, this is his, uh, style.
this isn't our home. This is where we work.
what's the difference?
okay.
all right, well, I'm gonna go get us some more beers.
how about that?
what was all that about how hunting isn't magical?
saving people, hunting things, the family business?
I am down.
but...
I was raised on Tolkien, man.
I mean, where is all this?
where...
Where's my quest?
magic, quests...suck.
they're all...
dead ends.
nothing but dead ends.
there's got to be some way to kill this thing.
Jenkins, no!
there's something here that belongs to me.
take me to it.
what the hell's it talking about?
I have no idea.
do you have a lab?
second floor, room 28.
wait!
I know you're in there.
Jenkins is gone.
you were right.
there's nothing worse than adventure.
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
download should be done by now.
what the hell?
Sam, give me a hand.
holy crap!
the first case investigated in this bunker involved Dorothy.
she and the witch came into this room, and they never came out.
this will never stop blowing my mind!
okay, pace yourself, Toto.
how is this real? It's part of the fairy world.
we have to find her.
no, we have to talk before anyone does anything, okay?
Dorothy?
talk?
typical Men of Letters, standing around, having a nice, little chat with your noses buried in your books while your little secretary takes notes.
we're hunters.
and who are you calling a secretary?
you're not a secretary?
you're a Woman of Letters?
w-- how long have I been out?
that's why we need to talk.
look, you've been gone for over 75 years.
now, according to our files, you came here to kill the wicked witch and then disappeared.
what happened?
we couldn't find a way to kill her, so I did the only thing that I could.
it's you and me forever, bitch.
Dorothy!
Dorothy!
a binding spell that came at a price...
her soul with mine.
so you've been frozen with the witch for all this time?
Yes. Look, the witch cannot be killed.
if I am awake, then so is she.
Hello, lovely.
sorry.
this litter box is warded against everything, even wicked witches.
big fan. Love your work.
what's the matter, darling?
cowardly lion got your tongue?
right. Enough chitchat.
must be here for a reason.
write it down so daddy can help.
wait, if she's here, why didn't she kill you?
she can't.
you're protected by the Witch of the North's kiss.
it's from the books.
Oh, forget the books! They're not important.
I'm protected. You aren't.
now, the witch came here looking for something.
I have no idea what it is.
but we have to find her before she finds it.
all right, all right. Charlie, dig into the files.
see if you can find anything that puts a dent in a witch.
Sam and I will have a look-see. Come on.
I'm helping. -- Yeah, I don't doubt it.
but for right now, why don't you rest up and help the smartest person in the room?
so big fan.
Ozma of Oz is a total ass.
you were much nicer in the books.
those books are the ravings of a sad, old man -- my father.
wait. Your dad was L. Frank Baum, the writer?
a Man of Letters.
another glorified librarian, you ask me.
Hey, these guys may have been sexist, but like all librarians, they were wicked smart, too.
the dude who was here when you came in -- Haggerty
he kept your case file open, worked it every day until he retired.
obviously, he never found you, but if you took five seconds to read, he did find way to fight the Wicked Witch.
do you remember the poppy fields in the first book?
it was much bloodier.
stop ruining my childhood.
do you remember the poppies?
haggerty made a deal with a fairy and got some poppy extract.
so, are you coming or what?
Wow. If it isn't the Scarecrow and the Tin Man.
your new houseguest --so misunderstood.
neither of you saw "wicked"?
what did she say to you?
something along the lines of...
all right, well, I'm gonna go get some holy oil and a lighter, dick bag.
I know what she's looking for.
what does she want?
I'd be happy to tell you, as soon as I get to stretch my legs.
all right.
what does the witch want?
give me a mo.
I still need to air myself out.
I think you're aired out enough.
rude.
key? What key?
I haven't the foggiest.
told her you boys kept the keys in the kitchen.
you do have a kitchen in this crap hole, don't you?
damn it, I just cleaned in here.
Really?
looks like we got a witch here.
sorry. We raided your gun range.
that's my girl.
there was only enough for four bullets, so...
...make each shot count.
she's looking for a key.
how do you know?
little birdie told us.
ring any bells, Dorothy?
unfortunately.
it's the key to Oz.
there are magical ways into Oz
tornado, eye of a hurricane, whirlpool
but this key will turn any locked door into a portal to Oz.
insert key, twist, and presto, you're in Oz.
how did the Men of Letters get the key?
I have no idea, but if she finds it, she'll go back and finish what she started.
she'll destroy all that is good in Oz.
she's got armies of witches, flying monkeys.
many will die.
what's this key look like?
I've seen that key.
found it when I was doing inventory.
where is it now? -- My room.
we got to get to that key.
all right, Charlie and I will go look in my room.
why don't you guys buy us some time?
safest place in this joint is the dungeon.
you have a dungeon in this place?
of course you do.
so maybe you should...
I am not hiding, especially in a dungeon.
wicked Witch, a key, a quest?
let's do this.
I can't believe I've lived here for 75 years.
how long have you called this place home?
my brother calls it home.
me, I, uh
I haven't had that much luck with homes.
me neither. Overrated, you ask me.
yellow bricks or not, give me the open road any day.
she can get anywhere from there.
split up, cover more ground.
you keep your porn meticulously organized, but not...
don't judge me.
Yahtzee.
No!
No!
you have to help her.
she's gone.
every time I use my power, it weakens me,
the witch running around your bunker is very powerful.
I can help with the witch or save your friend.
save her.
as you wish.
merry Christmas.
uh. Hey, I know you.
bet you say that to all the girls.
what the hell just happened?
the witch -- the witch was about to put a whammy on me, and, uh, Charlie jumped in front.
she got zapped, then the witch got the drop on you.
then why aren't we dead?
that's a good question.
I, uh
I clipped her with a -- with a poppy bullet.
she got the key.
I think she's gone.
no. She's wounded.
we should still have some time.
she could still be in the air vents.
no. no, no. She's right. We -- we have to -- we
just go. We'll catch up.
m-my gun's over there.
there's one bullet in it.
can we be best friends now?
who's Zeke?
what?
when I came into your room,
who's that?
I think you're still a little punchy, man.
just keep moving.
I had the weirdest dream when I was out.
it was Christmas, and my parents were still alive, and
dream?
Charlie, you died.
don't worry about it, though.
you're not a real hunter until you've died and come back again.
slow down. Why would you think I died?
heaven -- it's your dream life.
and if you were zapped by the Wicked Witch
instant death.
I would know. She killed me, too.
when did you die?
in Oz.

there's a garage in this place?!
Oh, boy.
clear.
I got nothing.
what do you think? Is she gone?
find the girls...
and kill them both.
Yes. I knew those boy scouts would keep it for me.
is that... -- Yeah.
he didn't make it.

Yes!
I don't believe it.

am I a zombie now?
do I need to eat brains?
no, no, no. You're you.
you're gonna be fine, all right?
just, um -- just keep this between us, okay?
all right, but only 'cause you raised me from the dead, which you're going to have to explain to me later.
all right.
not bad for a bunch of librarians.
you mind keeping an eye on my bike for me?
deal.
thank you for everything.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have a rebellion to finish.
so, you coming or what?
what? With you?
to Oz?
you have no idea what's in Oz.
I mean, t-there's flying monkeys, armies of witches.
there's all kinds of danger.
promise?
if you need anything, just, uh, tap your heels together three times, okay?
me? What about you crazy kids?
you gonna be all right without me?
take care of yourselves, boys.
think she'll be back?
Sammy's hurt. He's hurt real bad.
this one goes out to any angel with their ears on.
this is Dean Winchester...
and I need your help.
start with a name. - Ezekiel.
there is a chance I can fix your brother.
how will it work? - I heal Sam while healing myself.
Sam can eject me at any time.
and if Sam does eject me, he will die.
then we keep it a secret for now.
I just got to hope that you're one of the good guys.
I am.
you can bring her back like you did with Cass.
I cannot keep doing that. - Why the hell not?
every time I use my power, it weakens me.
merry Christmas.
dad wants us to pick up where he left off --saving people, hunting things...
the family business.
Becky, it's all real. - I Knew it!
nipples?
I mean, come on. We hunt monsters!
why am I here?
I mean, normal people, they see a monster, and they run.
but not us -- no, no, no. We search out things that want to kill us.
real. It's real. - No, no, no.
now you die.
you know who does that? Crazy people!
I'm Batman.
we...are insane!
I lost my shoe.
that was scary.
and with a 1: 20 left in the game, it's 62-54.
this team wants that championship.
it would be great. He's up.
it's good, but the ref's on the whistle.
he's calling a foul. It could be charging.
number 10 -- he's not happy about that.
this guy just about could foul out, and nobody but the ref wants to see that happen.
coach Johnson watching the clock. He calls time-out.
talking to the ref right now.
you know, so far in this game, there have been a number of fouls called by this particular ref, and that's not...
easy, Colonel.
is anyone here?
gets me every time.
what's the matter, boy? It's me.
what the hell?
what? - Kevin.
just poured some buffalo milk down his gob twice.
Buffalo milk?
Yeah, the hangover cure-all.
it's got everything in it. Except buffalo milk.
how is that kid still recovering from Branson?
what can I say? He's an amateur.
the slippery nipple shots at the Dolly Parton Dixie Stampede nearly killed the guy.
all right. Well, uh, I got something that's gonna get us back on the road.
a case? - Yeah.
you sure you're ready for that?
why would I not be ready for that?
aren't you kind of running on empty?
Yeah, but the last three nights straight, I had eight hours of shut-eye.
and for a hunter, that's like 20.
trust me, Dean. I feel good.
well, that's great and all, James Brown, but you're still recovering from the trials.
I think you ought to pace yourself, you know?
and the sooner you heal...
yeah?
I just want you back to your old self. - I am, Dean.
look, Kevin's back on the heaven spell. Crowley's locked up.
we should be out there doing what we do best.
well... - You want to listen at least?
okay, great.
taxidermist named Max Alexander mysteriously crushed to death.
nearly every joint in his body dislocated, every bone broken.
poor guy is a human pretzel.
you tell me what's got that kind of strength.
a demonic Luchador?
shop's a couple hours away in Enid, Oklahoma.
we should at least check it out.
unless there's some reason you think we shouldn't.
TAXICERMY - Subtle. - Check that out.
well, the creep factor just skyrocketed.
how are you? Agents Michaels and Deville.
the body's already been to the morgue.
just wrapping it up with Dave Stephens.
he's the one who discovered the body.
such a shame. I used to go hunting with Max.
he was a real good egg.
you mind showing my partner around? I just got a couple questions for Mr. Stephens.
okay. Come on.
Yeah. I just got a couple questions for you if that's all right.
I'll tell you whatever you need to know.
Max was a...a real pal.
hunting buddy? - Yeah.
eh, lucky guess.
so, uh, about what time did you discover the body?
about 9: 00 a. m.-- my usual pickup time.
I come in every Wednesday and Sundays, uh, to collect the entrails.
the what? - The animal organs.
after Max would, uh, dig them out and work his magic.
he, uh -- he was a real artist, you know?
strange thing is, though, uh, bins were empty this morning.
why is that strange?
well, because it's a Sunday.
weekend hunts are pretty much a given in this neck of the woods, so they're usually, mm, chock-full of guts.
any chance Max could have cleaned them out himself?
no. It's a -- it's a biohazard.
you can't just, you know, throw the stuff out.
you got to burn it.
is there, uh, anything else missing from the shop?
no. The register was full, and the safe was intact.
and all of Max's trophies were still on the walls.
and was there anybody else here when you showed up?
no one.
no, other than, uh...The Colonel.
excuse us.
so? - Okay, so, uh...We got a thief who's jonesing for animal parts, we got a pagan symbol, and we got a human pretzel.
Yeah, it all sounds very witch-y, but I wasn't able to find a hex bag.
all right, well, let's keep digging. But, uh, not here.
I don't like the way that one's looking at me.
okay, uh, that...symbol in the graffiti, it's...not wiccan.
it's copywritten.
local animal-rights group, Enid's answer to PETA.
s. N.A. R.T?You got to be kidding me.
well, it makes sense that an animal-rights group would have an axe to grind with a taxidermist.
Why? The animal's already dead.
Yeah, but hunters are what keep them in business.
now the question is, are those bleeding hearts actually witches or just hippies?
what's the difference?
gentle EARTH VEGAN BAKERY
always knew I'd find the source of all evil at a vegan bakery.
what's that smell? - Patchouli.
Yeah, mixed with depression from meat deprivation.
you know who wears sunglasses inside?
blind people. And douchebags.
Olivia and Dylan Camrose?
at your service.
you two are members of s. N.A. R.T?
founders and co-presidents, actually.
uh, can we interest you in some literature?
or a flaxseed scone?
it's wheat-free, gluten-free, sugar-free, and surprisingly moist.
let me stop you right there.
we're here to investigate the death of Max Alexander, a local taxidermist.
He's...dead? - You knew him?
ish. small town.
well, he was murdered last night, and a S. N.A. R.T. logo was found at the crime scene.
you two wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
his business is funded by hunters, and you know how hunters are.
they're selfish dicks who define themselves by what they kill.
and as animal advocates, we couldn't stand for that.
so, you killed him?
of course not. S.N. A.R. T.doesn't tolerate violence.
this coming from a couple who spray-paints death threats.
it was a scare tactic. We just wanted to spook him.
turns out we were the ones who got spooked.
what does that mean?
well, last night, when we were tagging the joint, we heard this noise.
a hissing noise.
it freaked us out, so we ran out into the alley.
but someone attacked us.
sprayed us in the eyes with mace.
and it's not like we could go to the cops.
so, now we look like total douchebags because we have to wear our sunglasses inside.
necrosis?
premature death of tissues that's why their eyes were all messed up. And it's not caused by mace.
all right. What caused it?
right here."Blunt force, radiation, venom.
as in "snake"?
the taxidermist was constricted.
Olivia and Dylan heard hissing, and they were sprayed in the eyes.
by venom. - By venom.
okay, so...What are we talking here, some sort of a freaky-ass snake monster?
maybe.
the weird thing is snakes either envenomate or constrict.
no snake does both.
correction -- freaky-ass mega-snake monster.
Yeah, but they're not afraid to sink their fangs in.
taxidermist was bite-free.
it doesn't really fit the profile.
right. So...
so, call Kevin. Have him look some stuff up.
Enid ANIMAL SHELTER
aren't you early, dude?
dude!
you said you were from a perfume company.
No! No, please!
claw marks. - Yeah.
the cops said all the cats went missing.
right, so, yesterday, uh, we're dealing with some sort of a snake monster.
today, it's a killer kitty.
I don't know.
why does that mutt look familiar?
that was the taxidermist's dog.
so, he's been at both crime scenes?
Yeah.
maybe he's a suspect.
you know may-- Could be a skinwalker, maybe a shapeshifter.
doesn't really look like a monster to me.
one way to find out.
come here, boy.
this isn't gonna hurt at all. Unless it hurts.
I guess we can, uh, rule out killer.
do you agents need any further assistance?
officer, I think we're okay. Thanks.
all right, well, let me know.
officer. Excuse me. can I borrow your hat?
good luck getting adopted.
okay, so, the Colonel's not a suspect.
Yeah, but he's a witness.
Hey, boy. You speak sign language?
that's monkeys.
you know what? This is gonna sound crazy.
I read this book once about this guy who tried to teach his dog to speak after it witnessed a murder.
it worked? - No.
but he wrote a book about it?
Yeah, well, he doesn't have what we have.
Kevin. Hey, it's me.
how do we speak to a dog?
an Inuit spell. - Yeah.
who knew the, uh, Men of Letters had its own Eskimo section?
and it's supposed to let us communicate with the Colonel?
Yeah, well...that's the plan.
Kevin said it's like a sort of a humananimal mind meld.
Meaning?
if it works, we should be able to read the Colonel's thoughts.
all right, I'll do it. You -- you got enough on your plate.
like what?
like...you're tired. You're on the mend. Okay?
Plus, you -- you've got a sensitive stomach.
last thing we need is you chucking this stuff up.
doesn't look so bad.
I was wrong. Come on.
Deila hr me."Dag eru nou rar vitur orum.
all right. Let's get this party started.
tell me everything you know
what's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
tough crowd.
so, call Kevin. spell tasted like ass and was a bust.
at least it didn't affect your appetite.
geez. - Yeah.
change the station.
change the station.
what? - What?
you...shut up. It's working! It... - go!
say that again.
you call this classic rock?
next thing you know, they'll be playing Styx.
and Dennis DeYoung? A punk.
Dennis DeYoung's not a punk. He's Mr. Roboto, bitch.
why are you arguing with the dog about Styx?
wh-- uh, yeah. Um, hey, boy.
what were you trying to tell us about the cowboy hat?
the douchewheel who killed my best friend was wearing a cowboy hat.
and the pothead, too?
Yep. Same guy killed both.
ask about the cats.
Yeah, uh...And what about the cats?
I don't know. - I don't want this.
I couldn't see much. I didn't exactly have the best view in the orphanage.
but I could smell him.
guy reeked of red meat, dishwashing detergent and tiger balm.
so, what's he saying?
uh, that the -- the guy, he smelled like ground chuck and soap suds and old-lady cream.
Dean, what are you doing? - I don't know.
what are you laughing at?
I think the spell worked.
fact, I think it worked a little too well. - What?
I think...you might be a dog. - What?
you're scratching your head. You're...barking at the mailman.
you're playing fetch.
I...
Yeah. No, that -- okay. All right. Thanks.
so, apparently, the Inuit spell has some side effects.
Oh, well, that would have been nice to know before I downed it!
what kind of side effects?
when you mind meld with an animal, it's...possible to start exhibiting some of its behavior.
don't look at me, Hoss. It ain't my fault.
well, how long am I gonna have the urge to...
sniff butts?
I don't have the urge to sniff butts.
yet.
do you really h-have the...- No! Come on!
well, Kevin doesn't know how long it'll last.
it's not like it's an exact science, you know?
but hopefully, when the spell wears off, so will the side effects.
I wouldn't eat that if I were you.
chocolate? Seriously.
where we headed? - Back to the shelter.
to sniff out more clues, maybe dig up something we missed?
all right, one more doggy pun out of you, and I'm gonna have your nuts clipped.
I hate to break it to you, Hoss.
my sack's emptier than Santa's after Christmas.
are you kidding me?
Hey, dick move, pigeon!
screw you, asshat.
did... - what?
wait a minute. Can I hear all animals?
Yep. Animals have a universal language -- like esperanto.
but this one actually caught on.
and I'm just getting started, too. Brewing a real big one.
bet your ride's gonna look sweet in white.
what's he saying?
you -- he's being a douchebag!
who you calling "douchebag," douchebag?
Oh, shut it, you winged rat!
dude. - What?
just calm down. Just get in the car.
that's right, Sally. Go cry to mama.
Oh, that's it, you son of a bitch! -Dean! Hey!
get in the car.
I think it's probably best to just leave the Colonel in the car.
excuse me?
well all the windows are open.
you think we like that?
we?
you think because the windows are open that that's some sort of a treat, huh?
no, the dog's coming in.
respect.
Yeah, baby.
you said it.
Dean. - Yeah.
so, what else can you tell me about the man with the cowboy hat?
honestly, I couldn't see much. Damn cataracts.
and you know no one's going to pay for my surgery.
just another casualty of the system, I guess.
I don't belong here, you know. I'm pedigreed.
well, I'm sure you'll be out of here soon.
please. I'm 14.
good luck...Ma'am.
once a day they clean these cages. Once a day! - Okay.
a biscuit. Just one biscuit.
I need a Raquel Welch poster and a rock hammer.
I'm shaking the fence, boss. Still shaking the fence.
over here! I was framed!
any luck? - Hardly.
and I'm not getting any clues...just a bunch of complaints.
Hey, pretty boy. Over here.
Yeah, uh, sorry, pal. I'm done for the day.
but I saw everything!
and I'll tell you, but...It'll cost you.
what? Are you kidding me?
I'm being extorted by a dog.
well, what do you want, huh?
what? Beggin' strips? Snausages?
bitch, please.
if I'm gonna rat someone out, it's got to be worth my while.
I want...a belly rub.
you...all right.
not from you, sweetie. From that big one. Over there.
Ohh, a-a cowboy hat, leather pants. The dude's a total closet case.
okay, what else can you tell me about the guy other than his outfit?
um, he was carrying a burlap sack for the cats.
what does he want with the cats?
Ooh, attaboy, yes. Hell if I know. But he took all of them, except for the one he ate.
what?
apparently, our guy has a sweet tooth for kitty cats.
Oh, and the sack had something written on it.
okay, what did it say?
Hey, come on. We had a deal.
well, you tell that to the tall drink.
he's the one who stopped rubbing.
Sam. - Hand cramps.
he's not talking.
Attaboy.
it said "Avant-Garde Cuisine."" Lucky for you, I read French.
that's a caf on Main Street.
no dogs allowed.
well, no wonder he smelled like hamburgers and dish soap.
we got to go downtown. Apparently our guy works at a restaurant.
no, no, wait, wait, wait. Sure you don't want to adopt me?
no, thanks. Uh, we'll pass.
no, I'm not above licking feet.
Hey, big'un! Come back here!
all right. - Well...
Hey, hold up. - What's the matter?
best belly rub I ever had.
freedom!
I left a surprise in there for animal control.
I didn't peg you for a softy.
going home. I'm going home. Honey, I'm coming home. Yeah, I'm coming home.
I'm going home!
bacon! Bacon! Bacon! Bacon!
I'm sorry. Who can afford to be closed on Monday these days?
a homicidal maniac? - Yeah.
check this out.
chef Leo.
think he's our guy?
it's Okie town.
lots of dudes wear cowboy hats.
oxycodone, tramadol, methadone.
guess he likes to cook comfortably numb. - Yeah, apparently.
did you hear that?
sounded like little kids.
help. If you don't free us, the chef will eat us.
she's not lying. - We're in a cage!
eat you?
look in the refrigerator behind you.
Yeah, behind you. - In the fridge.
owl brains.""Cheetah liver.""Grizzly heart.
well, what's a chef doing dabbling with witchcraft?
it says here whatever animal organ you ingest with the right mix of hoo doo and spices, you temporarily gain the power of that animal.
so, okay, if you're munching on owl brains...
your head spins around like "The Exorcist"?
close. Bolsters your IQ.
okay, eat a cheetah liver for speed, bear heart for strength.
okay, so if he's chowing down on this stuff...
then it would make sense why he constricted the taxidermist and clawed the guy at the shelter.
well, no offense, but why would he want to eat you guys?
we have collapsible spines. - We do. Promise.
look at this."Lion liver plus eagle heart.
rattlesnake fangs plus anaconda bladder.
baboon brains plus black widow abdomen.
he's mixing ingredients.
what the hell for?
Shoo! Quiet! - Don't shush me!
you be quiet! -I am quite. Now.
who the hell are you?
we're from the health department.
stopped by for an inspection.
I wasn't aware we had one scheduled.
Yeah, no, you wouldn't be. That's the point.
besides, I thought you were closed.
we are. Chef's having a private dinner.
in fact, he'll be here any minute.
well, then. In that case, kitchen's shut down.
shut down? Why?
because, uh, y-you're both in clear violation of penal code 8. 14.
out. Come on. Get out. Both of you. We'll let you know.
all right. I'll take the front. You take the back.
do we even know how to kill this guy?
well, empty one of these in his head.
see what that does.
chameleons aren't that bad.
kind of taste like chicken.
how the hell did you do that?
d-do what?- Don't play coy.
I want to know what you are.
Oh, screw the sharktopus.
you're my main course.
why does it smell like dog in here?
that smell's coming from you.
all dogs should be leashed.
what did you do to my brother?
your brother?
what was your mom smoking when she had you two?
he's fine. He's just taking a little cat nap before dinner.
I've never had human heart before. Heard it's a bit chewy.
good job I'm not a fussy eater.
you're sick.
been told that once or twice.
no, no. Not in the head. I...
well, you are that, too, but I mean sick like cancer.
well, I guess dogs really can sniff it out.
stage IV carcinoma.
so that's why you're doing this.
what happened?
draw the short straw, decided to break bad?
see, when I was diagnosed, I was way past standard treatment. No one could save me.
but then with the help of a Pawnee shaman and a zoo membership, I found a cure, albeit a temporary one.
cancer always came back.
you start experimenting with different organs, huh?
traded in the single serving for a combo platter.
well, what can I say? Combination therapy works.
I felt stronger, and the effects lasted longer.
well, I didn't mean to kill anyone...at first.
but if people got in my way, they became collateral damage.
guess you eat enough predators, you start to become one.
you are what you eat, right?
do you really think the power you hold over other people's lives can make up for what you lack in your own?
so, dog boy, what do I need to eat to take you down, huh?
you don't want to do this.
possum INTESTINES
Oh, but I do want to do this.
mongoose LNER
see, I'm gonna kill you, work up a nice appetite, and then I'm gonna eat your brother.
I mean, I don't know what the hell he is, but with healing powers like that, who cares?
he could cure me.
wolf HEART
dog on sort-of dog.
Rahuraar, sakuriisat iisat a ti'pah kaawakit.'A tarahkista'u...a raah.
sorry. Wolf trumps dog.
maybe. But not a whole pack.
for the love of God, Sammy. Hey, Sammy.
whoever the hell you are.
come on. Don't make me lick your damn face.
come on.
when you called us about adopting him, we couldn't believe it.
aren't you the sweetest?
back off, tofu-breath.
Oh, you must be starving.
lucky for you, I baked some vegan doggy cupcakes.
I'm gonna be pooping wheatgrass with these two.
look, I know they're hippie freaks, but they're gonna give you a good home-one that you deserve.
Yeah, yeah.
wish we could take you on the road with us, but it's no life for a dog.
don't sweat it. I get carsick anyway.
I was afraid to tell you earlier, but I barfed in your backseat.
you...
what?
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.
I'll miss you, too.
and by the way, as an honorary dog, there's something you should know.
dog's aren't really man's best friend.
what are you talking about?
I know it sounds like a conspiracy theory, but the real reason we were put here was to...
put here to do what?
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Oh, now the spell wears off?
okay.
how did it go?
well, bad news is I'm gonna miss the flea bag.
good news is it looks like the spell is finally wearing off.
you okay? The Stetson man got you pretty good.
Yeah, I'm fine. I-I just, uh...
I can't stop thinking about what he said.
Oh, come on, Sammy.
guy was out of his freaking gourd.
Yeah, but, I mean, why -- why would he ask that?
why --why did he want to know what I was?
who the hell knows?
he was all jacked up on juice, you know?
he was possessed by -- by something he couldn't control. It was...
it was just a matter of time before it completely took over.
you can't reason with crazy, right?
I don't know.
well, I do.
then
what kind of thing likes virgins and gold?
dragons Dragons, dude.
No!
I just think it's better if you took it easy, you know, - and didn't act like you were... - possessed by an angel.
I believe you know Sheriff Mills.
that was not my son!
you're right. - No!
how do we put them down?
what are we drinking?
you have less than one minute before a very dear friend of yours snuffs it.
call it off, Crowley.
I saw you break down, Crowley.
when I was trying to cure you, I know a part of you was human again, maybe still is.
blah-blah.
now
H
Nighty-night, Slim.
R - You okay? - Yeah.
Yeah.
just, uh...resting my head for a second.
um, how's Kevin? He, he find anything?
Jack.
on about four days no sleep. He looks worse than you.
what about Crowley?
um, do you think he might be lying about the whole, "Metatron's spell being irreversible" thing?
Oh, Crowley lie?
I do know one thing.
next time that junkie's jonesing for a hit of blood, we got leverage.
seriously, you want a pillow?
no, I'm fine.
you're sick.
no, I'm not sick.
I'm just, um...I feel like my battery can't recharge.
Hello? - Hey, Dean. Jody Mills.
sheriff Mills.
hang on. Sam's here, too.
Hey, Jody. - Hey, Sam.
I got a bit of an oddball to pitch your direction. - Shoot.
a small town I cover outside of Sioux Falls...
only crime to speak of being the occasional cow tipping.
then last week, four people go missing.
all right, so, what makes you think this is our kind of weird?
I've got a witness who says he saw someone lift an S. U.V. to nab a girl last night.
H
sheriff.
laying off the blind dates, I hope.
Yeah. You bite your tongue, boy.
so? - So.
car was right over there, ass over teakettle.
now, normally, if somebody would tell me that one guy lifted an S. U.V.
I'd tell him to take a flying leap, but after what I've seen...
nothing's impossible.
and this matches up with the other missing how?
well, four abductions, strong evidence left at every scene... literally.
so, first vic was a pastor? - Yeah.
door of his study was punched in.
and then, the next two... an engaged couple.
locked bedroom window was ripped open.
and then we have our waitress here with the topsy-turvy ride.
any other connection among them?
Yeah.
they were all members of Good Faith church here.
my, uh, my church group back in Sioux Falls was in a tizzy over it.
what?
I didn't peg you for churchy.
Yeah. You know...
choking on the ladies' room floor 'cause of witchcraft kind of makes a higher power seem relevant.
Jody, are you sure you're, uh, to jump back in the fray?
this wackadoo stuff keeps coming.
more I know, better armed I'll be.
okay, so, we have, uh, missing church folk and super strength.
maybe angels harvesting vessels?
could be a Buddy Boyle type thing.
wh-- angels? You're joking.
don't get your pants on fire. They suck.
you said there was a witness.
Yeah, well...more or less.
okay, Slim. My friends here want to talk to you about the missing girl.
her name was Honor. Nice girl.
always left me meatloafs.
slim, why don't you tell us what you saw that night?
and there's somebody over there lifting a car up...like this.
and did you happen to see who it was?
I was too far.
but I saw a light go off.
a white light?
blue.
blue like fire.
but not.
then she was... she wasn't there.
could you think of anything else?
no.
okay. Well...
slim, thank you for your time.
okay. So, no white light. - No angel.
has anybody talked to the victims' families?
it's next on my list.
okay, and you said that they were all part of the same church?
ready to get your worship on?
any questions before we get you boys registered?
uh, yeah, uh, look, um, Ms. Futchko...
Oh, please...Bonnie will do just fine.
Bonnie. Okay we...love the church. We do.
but...well, we've heard that a few members have gone missing, and, to be honest...that kind of scares us.
let me assure you, with our increased security, good faith has never been safer.
and those people who have gone missing, well, they are front and center in our prayers.
what a relief.
now, you must have been, uh, close to them.
well, we do share the A. P.U. bond.
our chastity group, abstinence purifies us.
you mind if we sit in on that, maybe see if it's for us?
I'm afraid it's members only.
I'm sorry, but it can get pretty personal.
then count us in.
well.
I'll be a squirrel in a skirt.
I'll be back in a jiff with the papers.
a chastity group?
Dean, listen, if all the members were in A. P.U. then maybe whatever took them is stalking virgins.
and that Slim guy said he thought he saw fire.
so, what are you thinking, dragons?
all righty.
you can just sign there, and your purification can begin.
purity pledge"?
it's a commitment to your virginity.
I don't think we can really un-ring that bell.
you know what I mean?
I see.
well...
if you just ask for God's forgiveness for your sins and make a new vow of chastity, well, then, you'll be born again as a virgin in his eyes.
so, you just hit the "virginity do-over" button, and all is good with the man upstairs?
it's not a button.
and...this isn't just a piece of paper.
I mean, this is your clean slate, your chance to be a virgin until marriage.
well, you had me at "clean slate"" Let's do this.
congratulations, Sam and Dean Winchester.
you are both virgins.
please.
stay away from me.
good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Suzy.
I thought we'd begin with a silent prayer for our missing friends.
Amen.
now, does anyone have anything that they would like to share?
I wrote a new piece of verse.
it's called "Sex is a racket, and God's ball is in your court.
and we would love to hear that, Tammy... later.
why don't we hear from our new friends?
Sam, what brought you here to reclaim your virginity?
well, I guess because every woman I've...
ever...
had relations with, uh...
it...hasn't ended well.
he ain't lying.
thank you for being here, Sam.
stay strong. Stay pure.
stay strong. Stay pure.
and you, Dean?
what set you on the path away from sin?
hard to say, exactly. Yeah.
sex has always felt...I don't know... good, you know?
I mean, really, really good.
but, Sometimes, it just makes you feel bad, you know?
you're drunk.
you shack up.
then, it's the whole morning thing.
you know,"Hey, that was fun.
and then,"adios," you know?
always the "adios.
but, you know, when you get down to it, what's the big deal, right?
I mean, sure, there's the touching and the feeling all of each other, my hands everywhere, tracing every inch of her body, the two of us moving together, pressing and pulling...
grinding.
then you hit that sweet spot, and everything just builds and builds and builds until it all just...
Yeah.
but the whole thing was just a little too, sticky.
so, uh, I got my "V" card back.
the end.
so Wee bit of an over-share, Dean?
I was purifying.
Hey, she look familiar to you?
Yeah. Swear I know her from somewhere.
Oh, good, Dean.'Cause that line never fails.
well, let's find out.
so? - So?
how did you like the meeting?
Oh, I-I-I-I loved it.
Yeah.
um, you know, I-I couldn't help but think of those who weren't here.
she's my favorite.
would you excuse me?
her favorite?
she has no idea what kind of girl Honor is.
you don't say.
Tammy, right? The poet?
Tammy, why... why don't, um, why don't you tell me what kind of girl Honor is?
are you sure we don't know each other?
Yeah, I-I'm pretty sure we've never met, Dean.
wait, you're... you're new in town, right?
Yeah. New to town. New to this whole chastity thing.
well, I provide individual counseling.
if you ever need to talk...
so, everybody in the group, they dish to you?
they confide.
abstinence is... it's really rough without support and education.
Hey, you know what?
I have some great books on the vow that really helped me.
I-I live close. I'll just go grab them.
with a, uh, with a kidnapper on the loose?
no, I'll be fine.
tell you what... why don't I walk with you just to be safe, okay?
just give me one second.
and I bake real cookies for the bake sale.
honor just brings Oreos!
you know what? Excuse me.
guess who's taking the teacher home.
research.
you really think you're gonna hit that?
Dean, she's the chastity counselor.
Yeah, I know. What about you? Any luck?
you mean am I actually working?
as a matter of fact, yes, I am.
all right, well, good luck with that.
okay. Lead the way. - Okay.
sorry.
so, where were we?
honor is going to hell.
how was church?
well, it turned into confessional.
apparently, two of our vics, Honor and pastor Fred, did the dirty.
Oh, well. They're not the only ones.
barb Blanton, our missing bride to be... - Yeah?
her mom said she heard Barb and her fianc in Barb's bedroom.
going at it?
well, she said she heard sex noises, then Barb crying, then Neil telling Barb it didn't count because it was under 30 seconds.
and then, two hours later, she heard a smash and saw a flash of light under the door.
blue light?
you know, I'm thinking whatever this thing is, it's not going after virgins, even born-again virgins.
it's taking virgins who break their chastity vow.
so dragons are off the list.
I'm sor-- dragons?
those are a thing?
Yeah.
too many things are things.
make yourself comfortable.
not now, Kato.
I can't stop thinking about my friends.
I'm so scared for them.
will you pray with me, Dean?
sure.
this is Dean's other other cell, so you must know what to do.
come on, call me.
you know, for being born again today, you sure look like crap.
wait a second.
did you...get...
born again? - Yeah.
Oh, Sam. I don't make promises I can't keep.
it's just...
I enjoy church.
I mean, after...
after Bobby, Crowley...
I needed something that made sense to me... you know, comfort, I guess.
Yeah, I guess we're all looking for that.
except those that got it.
come on.
you and Dean?
that's something special, don't you think?
okay.
so, why don't you breeze through these, and I'm gonna head to the little girls' room.
Yeah.
Dean. Are you there?
Hello?
what's going on?
I found something big.
Yeah. So did we. So, get this...
it's not a dragon.
Dean. - Copy that.
or should I say...
Hola"?
Why? - No reason. No reason.
a-are you okay?
me? I'm great. Why?
you seem...I-I don't know, nervous.
nervous? No. I'm not nervous...
so, you've seen my...work.
listen, I don't blame you if you want to be assigned a new counselor.
I-I get it. - No.
no, no. Are you... are you kidding me?
I mean, you're... you're a freaking legend.
No! I-I am... I'm not that girl anymore.
I moved here. I changed my name.
that girl was... was horrible.
listen... Suzy. I've seen a lot of awful things.
stuff of the nightmares, ok? But you... you're the good dreams.
and nobody in Hartford knows?
Yeah, what am I supposed to say?
Oh, yeah, hey, I used to be a porn star. Let's pray"?
Well...They do not appreciate you.
I mean...the things you can do... the scene with the tacos.
Yeah.
made me want to join a mariachi band just to be near you.
well, you are now.
I am, aren't I?
you're not like...the other guys in town, are you?
you're kind of a...a bad boy.
I don't know.
why don't you ask me that in Spanish?
Eres un Chico malo?
pastor Fred.
what was that?
what happened to him?
what do you think? He's starving to death.
just like we will if we don't get out of here.
why didn't you tell me who you were?
I was so scared.
we were scared.
Where'd he go?
what's up?
this thing is taking people that break their vows, right? - Yeah.
Dean and Suzy... been over an hour.
right.
I got to say...
I really missed that.
I miss it already.
okay.
what are you doing?
I'm so thirsty.
so thirsty!
there has to be a way out!
Dean. Dean. Hey, come on.
where are we?
hell.
neighbors see anything?
flash of blue.
you sure Dean was here?
Oh, yeah.
and I think he crossed someone off his bucket list.
we tried.
there's no escape.
are we gonna run out of air?
I don't think so.
somebody wants us to die nice and slow.
and then it's gonna take us, just like it took pastor Fred.
what took him?
we couldn't see, exactly. It... it was so bright.
i-it was like it was on fire.
virgins, fire... sound familiar?
vesta, Roman Goddess of the Hearth
in ancient Rome, six virgins were dedicated to this chick every year.
their main duty was to tend Vesta's hearth.
wait, so, fire is connected to virginity?
Yeah, the girls had to be pure because fire is the symbol of purity.
okay, as long as Vesta's fire was kept lit, Rome received a good harvest.
the virgins had to stay celibate for 30 years.
if they broke their vows, they were buried alive.
son of a bitch.
maybe God wants us down here... because of what we did.
trust me... this is not God's work.
son of a... - What's wrong?
they took my phone.
luckily...
I keep a spare.
come on, bars.
vesta was often enveloped in a blue halo of light, which she could control at will to disorient, to maim... or to kill.
okay, what about some way to kill her?
a-a weapon or... or something.
Hey, listen to me. I'm...
Dean, wh... - underground.
say it again. I can't hear you.
We're...Some kind of... - Dean!
I lost him. - What?
listen, is there some kind of train station around here or something?
I-I could have sworn I heard a whistle.
don't, Neil. Please, don't.
don't what, Neil?
just mind your beeswax, pal.
listen, we're all stuck down here together.
so, you got something to say, you say it.
okay, look, whatever that fireball thing was, it's taking the weakest, and I am not gonna be next.
so, the way I see it, her leg's busted anyway.
we serve her up. It could buy us some time.
screw you, Neil.
busted leg?
try a sprained ankle, okay?
nobody's serving anybody up!
we are under the gallows, all of us.
give it honor.
it might save the rest of our necks, unless you have a better plan.
maybe I do.
maybe we'll give him you.
Oh, what, you don't like that idea?
then shut up.
here we go. 8:00 p. m.train out of Sioux Falls. 79 miles an hour.
what's five miles east of Hartford... anything?
pasture mostly.
no... the old Wimmer farm.
wait, anything on a weapon?
oak stained in virgin blood.
where are we gonna get a virgin?
I'm a virgin.
I think we need the real McCoy here, Sam.
you need what? - Your blood.
just a dab.
But...Pagans use blood.
are you pagans? - What? Pagan?
no, look, it's for a weapon that... - You are in a House of God.
your psycho rituals aren't gonna fly here.
okay, we don't have time for this.
I am the cops.
what the fudge, lady?
wipe your nose, dear.
you broke, too, huh?
guess I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
God forgives.
you told me that yourself.
told you.
it's back for one of us.
what are you gonna do now? Right, you should have listened to me...
shut up.
Dean! We're here!
we're gonna get you out!
Jody, I found it!
Hey, Dean, we're here.
we're gonna get you out.
Sammy, are you still there?
now, now.
Really? This is how a goddess acts?
what?
I'm sort of new to this, but, you know, a Roman deity burying people alive in a barn?
sort of pathetic, don't you think?
it only got pathetic when I started having to do it myself.
because of that hippie from Bethlehem...
before him, they practically threw virgins at me.
and now...
they let your fire go out. They forgot about you.
Yeah, I know.
sucks to be Lindsay Lohan, doesn't it?
actually, I figured if you can't beat them, join them.
that's right.
I adapted!
now I chew on the cud of prayer.
heck...
I even got a sweater set.
screwdriver, anybody?
from the first-aid kit.
they used to beg to stay pure for me.
and now I have to drag them kicking and screaming.
and they're not even real virgins.
they're born-again.
you want to talk about pathetic?
Yeah. You're a real charity case.
Oh, no, sweetheart. This isn't charity.
I take what I deserve.
when those trollops are about to die soaked in their juicy fear,
I...eat...their...livers!
because that's the only part of them still working to purify the body that they've trashed.
now, normally, I like them weaker, but let's just call this a hunter's exception, shall we?
sure.
this is how a goddess acts!
come on, come on, come on, come on.
what's wrong with you?
what?
your liver.
it's... it's no good.
dear boy, you're all duct tape and safety pins inside.
how are you alive?
what did I miss?
heading out? - Yeah.
I'd tell you boys to stay out of trouble, but what's the point?
thanks for bailing me out.
Oh, what can I say?
I'm getting the hang of this.
drive safe. - Thanks.
don't get the door for me or anything.
what's up?
what if there is something wrong with me... something...really wrong?
you're just crapped out, man. You need some rest.
Oh, it's more than that.
I mean, Vesta said I was practically dead inside.
Oh, and she's in the circle of trust now?
why would she lie?
it's probably the trials, okay?
probably some sort of a, you know, aftereffect.
it's not like you're bouncing back from the flu here.
I mean, you were glowing with freaking trial juice.
I don't know.
well, what else would it be?
why does it have to be something else?
it's always something else.
we're always scraping to find some other explanation when maybe it is...just me.
Oh, come on, Sam.
I'm a mess, Dean. You know it.
and sometimes, I feel like maybe I'm never gonna actually be all right.
you will.
all right,'cause whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
or this is...
just the way I am.
I can't.
I can't let you put this on yourself.
listen to me.
it's not you, Sam.
I wouldn't do that, Dean.
he deserves to know.
your brother is not ready.
if he ejects me, he will not make it.
damn it, Zeke! How much longer we got to keep playing this?
not much longer.
I promise you that.
what?
what?
what? What... what's not me?
nothing. I just... I-I meant that...
if there is something wrong...
it's not your fault.
we'll deal with it.
but you got to have a little faith, Sammy.
then
my father and his father before him were both Men of Letters.
if you guys were such a big deal, then why haven't we ever heard of you?
no one told me this initiation was a formal affair.
the hard part's over, right?
we made it.
what do you know about the Men of Letters massacre of 1958?
my name is Abaddon.
we will march into Hell, and demonkind will rise up and sweep over the earth.
who put Crowley in charge?
the King's dead.
long live the queen.
you knew about the mark.
you knew about Abaddon and Cain. You knew all of it.
and you played me.
you owe me!
you make me a junkie.
you keep me stashed away for months while my kingdom falls apart?
so, where is the Blade?
this is the object of your quest.
drop the Blade.
I'll hang on to old donkey teeth here until such time as you locate Abaddon.
you're not proud of having them.
a lot of people don't even want to talk about it.
if you don't have them, be glad.
but I got to tell you, this product...
what's on the menu tonight?
meatloaf.
Really?
again?
I wish you wouldn't say that.
you know how hard I work all day, and yet you criticize me.
so, yes. We're having meatloaf.
with potatoes... and broccoli...
...and lots of good things.
you catch any shut-eye last night?
Nope.
guess I'm driving, then.
driving where?
caught wind of a case online.
a 1st-grade teacher came home and killed her husband.
well, maybe she snapped.
ankle biters can do that to you.
dude, she pounded him, into ground chuck.
so, what are you thinking?
best guess -- possession.
why don't you go?
Dean, look.
I want to find Abaddon, too, but we've been combing through this stuff for days.
well, maybe we missed something.
and maybe there are better ways to spend our time than just spin our
maybe we don't have time.
what's up with you?
nothing. - Yeah?
see, because ever since you killed Magnus, you've been acting... sort of...obsessed.
well, maybe because I want an end to all this.
maybe because if we find Abaddon, then Crowley ponies up the First Blade, and we kill her and him both.
so, what you call being "obsessed,
I call doing my job.
okay, um... I get it, Dean. I'm just checking in.
I'm fine.
all right.
hit me up if you find anything.
it says here in your report that you were the first on the scene?
Yes, sir. I found Mrs. Young sitting next to her husband covered in his blood.
now, was her husband abusive?
Ric? Oh, no. Not at all.
I mean, he could be a stubborn S. O.B.,but can't we all?
anything else, uh, weird that maybe you felt was too odd to include?
like? - Like, did you smell sulfur?
why would I smell sulfur?
of course. Uh, thank you.
what about Karen's eyes?
you notice anything strange?
actually, agent, they, uh, pretty much looked like eyes.
Oh, lord.
I don't get this.
did she go anywhere on the day of the murder?
it was Saturday.
a quick trip to the grocery store. That's about it.
how's Mrs. Manson doing?
dead. Hung herself in her cell.
lovely.
the demon smoke out?
if it was a demon. I mean, there was no sulfur, no EMF anywhere.
and everyone who saw her just before she gutted her husband said she was totally fine.
what are you still doing there?
this sounds like a case of the crazies to me.
well, if nothing kicks up by morning, I'm out of here.
how's the research going?
it's going.
all right. Well, uh... Good luck.
I can give you the Mark, Dean, if it's what you truly want.
can I use it to kill that bitch?
Yes.
but you have to know with the Mark comes a great burden.
Yep. No. I know. I'm sorry.
no, I'll make it up to you.
look, I'm trying to get there, babe, but I got into a fight with my mom.
I think I got a bite.
Yeah, a van is pulling up.
let me roll. I love you. Bye.
Oh, hey!
I didn't know this was your ride, Mr. Richie.
let's get you out of the cold.
Thanks.
it's freezing out there.
Hey, what -- what are you doing?
get off me!
No!
order up.
here you go. - Thanks, R.J.
can I get you anything else, honey?
uh, this is great. Thank you.
be with you in a minute, Bill.
Billy, what are you doing?
your mother raise you in a barn?
don't talk to me like that!
Hey. Take it easy.
she's working hard.
what's eating you?
you. My mom.
him.
Buddy...Give it a rest.
I'm gonna call your mom, have her come fetch you.
no, you're not.
so, tell me what's happening here.
I was hoping you'd tell me.
you're the one that mentioned weird.
now, where did they all come from?
Oh, they're all locals.
four of the straightest arrows you'd ever meet.
apparently, they've been acting like this for days.
do they share anything in common?
church? School? Uh, book club?
not of my knowledge.
I met the kid's girlfriend.
she said he was hitching a ride, when a van picked him up, and that's the last she heard of him.
whatever that's worth.
what are you, Billy?
clear.
of?
everything.
why are you doing this?
you think there's a "why"?
no.
it's because I want to.
and I can.
grocery store surveillance pics.
great. Thank you.
Hey.
well, that took forever.
uh, well, I'm working.
you got anything?
not sure.
but, um, a handful of other people have started acting out, too.
acting out how?
well, same as the woman -- aggressive, violent, impulsive.
sounds like you're in a Gold's gym.
Yeah. Except it's less steroid-induced, and more...basic instinct.
it's like the littlest things can set them off.
kind of like me.
you've got no instinct.
I mean, you are seriously messed up.
you?
Yeah, uh, soulless me. Remember that?
Yeah, how could I forget?
but you weren't out of control like these people.
Yeah, well, maybe everyone has a different reaction to losing their soul.
possible.
so, what?
a crossroads demon making deals and taking people's souls?
no, I don't think so.
I mean, it's not as if these people are winning the lotto.
okay. Uh, well, that was my best swing.
I hope not, Dean.
I-I could really use your help down here.
Yeah, no, I -- I heard you.
I just, uh... I'm getting close, Sam.
I can't drop the ball on Abaddon right now.
all right. Be safe.
you're lying to Sam like he's your wife, which kind of makes me your mistress.
now, listen to me, young man.
those demons are back.
I'm telling you, it's happening all over again.
demons? - Yes! Demons.
are you deaf?
Yes, ma'am. You know what?
we're gonna take care of those demons right away.
now, do you need a ride home or something?
don't patronize me, you little turd.
Hey, you know what? I can take it from here.
agent Leiter.
please.
here you are. - Thank you.
sure.
please, call me Julia.
it's very simple, Agent.
they... ...they came to Milton.
And?
I say "demons," and you don't bat an eye, when everyone else around here thinks I'm nuts on toast.
maybe I'm just a bit more, uh, open-minded than most.
maybe.
you're one of them, aren't you?
sorry. One of who?
men of Letters.
they came here in 1958.
men of Letters... came here?
Oh, yes.
it was different then.
I was different.
they were a lovely couple.
sister Julia, please answer the door.
Yes, Mother Superior.
good evening, sister.
we're here from the Office of the Inquisition.
what do you want?
you tell me, romeo. You rang.
let me guess -- you butt-dialed me?
whatever the hell that is.
either way, we done here?
actually, long as I'm here, last time we chitchatted, we agreed that you were gonna line up Carrot Top.
Yep, well...I'm on it.
unless Abaddon likes 10-cent wings, stale beer, and the clap, I doubt that she's here.
go to hell.
Oh, if only.
what's going on with you, huh?
you call me, you hang up.
you want Abaddon, you don't want Abaddon.
you want the Blade, you don't want the Blade.
if I didn't know you any better, I'd say you're stalling.
just between us girls, how did you feel when you sunk the First Blade into Magnus' head?
not half as good as I'm gonna feel when it's yours.
love it when you talk dirty.
you know what I think?
I think you felt powerful... Virile... And afraid.
afraid?
don't scam a scam artist, darling.
you're stalling 'cause you're scared.
they gave false names, but later I learned that the man's name was Henry.
Henry Winchester?
never got a last name.
okay, um, and the woman?
did you know them?
Yes, uh... Sort of.
it's complicated.
I'm an ex-nun, sweetie.
complicated my middle name.
now, w-what were they here to investigate?
sister Mary Catherine.
she killed two people before jumping from the bell tower.
so I took 'em to see Mother Superior and sister Agnes.
time is of the essence, Mother...Superior.
the cardinal is meeting with the holy father first thing in the morning, and he wants a report.
our beloved abbey is open to you, Father.
sister Julia here will be your guide.
where would you like to begin?
sister Mary Catherine's sleeping quarters, please.
sister Mary Catherine's room it is.
I hate nuns.
why, because she answered me and not you?
no, because I went to Catholic school and I have a lot of pent-up anger.
we have no time for such pettiness.
what's got your boxers all in a bundle?
this. Why are we out in the field?
it's called learning on the job.
therein lies the problem.
as our initiation grows closer,
I... I worry that this might be a selfish endeavor on my part.
selfish. How?
if anything were to happen to me, what of John?
Millie?
they'd be proud to know that you answered the call.
no. My wife would be a widow, and my son fatherless.
I don't expect you to understand.
you don't have a fam-- I'm sorry, Josie.
I didn't mean it that way.
I know, Henry.
you're a good man. Millie is lucky to have you.
here we are.
The...blood wouldn't come off.
so, we're assuming demonic possession here, correct?
or a linguist gone mad.
it looks ancient.
Zapoqra or Sanskrit?
no. It -- it's pre-Enochian.
a crest of some sort.
Kni-- "Knights of Hell"?
what is that?
trouble.
knights of Hell?
what were they doing there?
I'm not sure of anything I saw that night.
we couldn't leave our room after 10: 00.
mother Superior forbade it.
stay still.
I woke up in a dark place, tied to a chair.
there were others.
they were taken.
I was so scared.
I prayed and prayed, but God didn't answer my prayers.
Henry and Josie did.
you hunters are always sticking your noses in where they don't belong.
hunters?
please.
then what are you?
quickly, dear, before this one pays for your stubborness!
we are preceptors...
Beholders, chroniclers of all that which man does not understand.
a woman amongst the Men of Letters?
Yes.
well, ain't that a blast.
you do know what we're capable of, demon?
Yes. I know what you think you're capable of, but perhaps I should see for myself.
wait. What are you doing?
I'm trading up from this bag of bones to Mr. Dreamy here.
then I can study your kind real close.
don't, or I'll -- or what?
take me, not him.
you're joking.
I could be more useful to you.
people underestimate a woman.
no.
that's not it.
you love him.
he loves you, too, you know.
like a sister.
please... Spare him.
take me.
you have my permission.
you've been very entertaining, my dear.
but I don't need your permission.
Abaddon takes what she wants.
and right now, she wants everything.
you're going to study the Men of Letters?
for a moment.
and then I'll destroy them.
and what of all this?
keep it going until I return.
now play dead.
are you okay?
we did it.
we stopped the demons.
Abaddon.
did you ever see exactly what she was doing down there?
no, but whatever it was she was doing at St. Bonaventure, it seems to be happening again.
the convent's name was St. Bonaventure? - Yes.
where is it?
on the outskirts of town.
it's been closed for years.
I love this. I really do.
couple of cold ones, a kind jukebox...
good and evil, bro-in down.
shut your pie hole, Crowley.
Yeah, you said that already.
look, I merely suggested you might be a bit scared.
Yeah. No, I heard you the first time.
you still don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I know that Cain gave you his Mark for a reason.
and I know that rather than embracing it, rather than looking at it as the gift that it is, you're sulking like you lost your knuffle bunny.
why are you fighting what you really are?
I'm a hunter.
who's a chip off the old Mark of Cain.
no. When I kill, I kill for a reason.
I'm nothing like Cain.
nothing like -- who are you talking to?
I know you're not talking to me. - Eat me.
I saw you. I saw the two of you together.
nothing like Cain? What's in that bottle? Delusion?
I'm really starting to worry about you, Dean.
Yeah, well, why don't you worry about yourself?
I will.
cause like it or not, we're in this together.
your problems, my problems... Our problems.
where you going now?
I'm going to go water the lily.
care to cross streams?
so serious.
next time, it'll be easier.
that's it.
good.
you'll get used to the feelings, even welcome them.
I know what you're thinking.
I'm thinking I'd like to take a leak, so move.
I'm Dean Winchester.
and I know a hunter when I see one.
you don't want to do what you're about to do.
and why's that?
because you're packing a knife to a demon fight, and you don't stand a chance.
then I'll go down swinging.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.
any other day, I'd be right there with you, brother. I would, okay?
but you got to trust me on this one.
or you could grow a pair and come with.
you ever taken on a demon before?
Yeah.
well, trust me when I say that when he's done with you, he's gonna go after your family.
he's gonna go after your friends.
hell, he'll go after your prom date.
so, if you want to do that,
you go right ahead.
I got a kid sister.
she don't deserve that.
what's your name?
good to meet you, Jake.
Thanks.
I'll see you around.
come on. We got to go.
demons don't take leaks.
next time you want to shoot up, why don't you find a better excuse?
guilty as charged.
what happened? I thought you were cleaning up your act.
well, I was going to, but then after very little soul-searching,
I decided to embrace my addiction.
what about you?
takes a junkie to know a junkie.
you just want to touch that precious again, don't you?
I want to kill Abaddon.
that's what I want.
so, whatever happens with the Blade, I can't worry about that.
sure.
whatever you got to tell yourself so you can sleep better at night.
look, what I want, what I fear, none of that means squat.
so, I'm all in, no matter what the consequences.
so the plan remains the same?
I find her, you bring the Blade.
it's a date.
for a second there, I thought he made me.
he has other things on his mind.
but he did do exactly what you said he would. He saved you.
of course he saved me.
we're besties.
and now he's ready.
souls are a very precious and fragile thing.
break one of those, and them little buggers fly right back home.
we can't have that, now can we?
so, after all these years, you're still doing Abaddon's dirty work, huh, Agnes?
would you believe it's gotten even dirtier?
used to be folks believed in the church.
heck, the way they would come strolling in here, looking for God.
it was like fish in a barrel, really.
but times change.
you can blame your perverts for that.
now I'm riding shotgun in some smelly van with a handyman and tricking any half-wit I can lay my hands on.
but it's worth it.
because... Stealing souls is so noble.
stealing souls is winning!
winning what?
hell's crown, nimrod.
you think Abaddon is just gonna sit there while those pantywaisted demons refuse to pick a side?
and so she made a plan if you can't convince 'em, make 'em.
she's turning souls into demons?
a demon army, unbeatable, loyal only to her.
well, uh... At this rate...
should only take a couple million years.
have fun with that.
you think I'm the only one doing this?
we have factories spread throughout.
worry not, though. Victory is nigh.
and we'd like you to be on our team.
recruitment is easy.
I just have to rip your soul out of your body.
Regna terrae, cantate deo Please!
if it's for a date, I'm sorry.
I never see anyone under 65.
too much drama.
spit it out.
after witnessing what you did, why didn't you warn Henry about Abaddon?
I became a nun because I wanted to help people.
make a difference.
but they never prepare you.
they never tell you how to act in the face of true evil.
thank you, sister.
for the safety of all those involved, it's important that we keep what happened here today...
...quiet.
of course.
soon after, I left the order.
Why?
because I was ashamed.
I had betrayed our flock, God, myself.
it was and still is my greatest shame.
well, what you shared with me saved lives.
and I couldn't have done that without you.
take care.
you too, Sam.
you okay, Henry?
better.
we saved lives today.
we made a difference.
this -- our work...
it's a noble calling, isn't it?
I mean, yes, there's risk, but, gosh.
I feel the fool for doubting it for even a second.
and you, Josie?
me?
well, I feel like a whole new person.
still plugging away?
like a dog with a bone.
you?
you were right.
about what?
finding Abaddon ASAP.
she's mining souls.
Why?
to create an army.
dad wants us to pick up where he left off
saving people, hunting things.
the family business.
then
I have these nightmares, and sometimes they come true.
come again?
I dreamt about jessica's death before it happened.
a vision. Started out as nightmares.
then he started having them while he was awake.
the closer I get to anything involving the demon, the stronger the visions get.
the demon said he had plans for me and the children like me.
do you have any idea what he meant by that?
no, I don'T.
Max, your abilities -- they started six, seven months ago, right?
how'd you know that?
cause that's when my abilities started.
the same thing killed our mothers.
you and I are chosen.
for what? - I don't know.
the thing I don't get is why. I guess because we're so alike?
Max is nothing like you. Sam, max is a monster.
he's already killed two people. Now he's gunning for a third.
did he say anything to you?
no.
nothing.
now
Hello? Yeah.
all right.
afternoon, dennis. - Hey, doc.
I'd like to look at a gun.
Yeah, right, doc.
Seriously?
that one.
okay.
that's a turkey hunter. 12-gauge. Pump-action.
don't leave enough turkey behind, if you ask me.
what, uh, what sort of shells does it use?
right here.
I'm taking the boys up to the cabin this weekend, if you're, uh...
I mean, if you think you might like to take up the sport.
Thanks, but no.
you know guns make me nervous. Always have.
this one goes in here, right?
whoa. Doc! No, no, you can't load a weapon on the premises. It's illegal!
it's okay, dennis. - No, no.
it's okay, dennis. It's all gonna be...
...okay.
doc!
what's going on?
no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
it's all gonna be... okay.
Sam, come on, zip it up. Let's hit the...
road.
what?
I don't know, man. Why don't we just chill out, think about this?
what's there to think about?
just don't know if going to the roadhouse is the smartest idea.
Dean, it's another premonition. I know it.
this is gonna happen, and ash can tell us where. Plus it could have some connection with the demon.
my visions always do. - That's my point.
there's gonna be hunters there. I don't know if
if going in and announcing that you're some supernatural freak with a demonic connection is the best thing, okay?
so I'm a freak now?
you've always been a freak.
Simon SAID
damn, little lady, that was my room money.
then I guess you're taking a truck nap tonight.
I'd have checked the high scores before you put your money down.
went and got yourself hustled, ed.
just can't stay away, huh?
Yeah, looks like. How you doing, jo?
Where's ash? - In his back room.
great. - And I'm fine.
sorry. He's -- we're kind of on a bit of a timetable.
the conditions that led to the sharpsville tragedy...
Hey, ash?
Hey, dr. Badass?
Sam and dean.
Hey, ash, um, we need your help.
hell, then, guess I need my pants.
so, I got a match. It's the logo for the blue ridge bus lines.
Guthrie, oklahoma.
okay. Do me a favor. Check guthrie for any demonic signs or omens or anything like that.
you think the demon is there?
Yeah. Maybe.
why would you think that? - Just check it, all right?
no, sir, nothing. No demon.
all right. Try something else for me.
search guthrie for a house fire. It would be 1983.
fire's origin would be a baby's nursery, night of the kid's 6-month birthday.
okay, now, that is just weird, man.
why the hell would i be looking for that?
cause there's a pbr in it for you.
give me 15 minutes.
what?
R. E.O. Speedwagon? - Damn right, R.E. O.
Kevin cronin sings it from the heart.
he sings it from the hair. There's a difference.
that profile you've got ash looking for?
your mom died the same way, didn't she
the fire in sam's nursery?
look, jo, it's kind of a family thing. - I could help.
I'm sure you could, but we got to handle this one ourselves.
besides, if I ran off with you, think your mother might kill me.
you're afraid of my mother?
I think so.
we have a match. We got to go.
all right, jo, see you later.
you're kidding, right?
I heard the song somewhere. I can't get it out of my head. I don't know, man. What do you got?
born in '83, like me.
lost his mother in a nursery fire exactly six months later, also like me.
you think the demon killed his mom?
sure looks like it.
how did you know to look for this guy?
every premonition I've had, if they're not about the demon, they're about the other kids the demon visited.
like max miller. Remember him?
Yeah, but max miller was a basic little psycho.
point is he was killing people, and I was having the same type of visions about him.
and now it could be happening all over again with this gallagher guy.
how do we find him? - I don't know.
no current address, no current employment.
still owes money on all his bills -- phone, credit, utilities.
collection agency flags?
not in the system.
they just let him take a walk?
seems like it.
there's a work address from his last w-2 about a year ago.
let's start there.
you won't get anything out of andy, guys. I'm sorry, but they never do.
they"?
you're debt collectors, right?
once in a while, they come by.
I don't know what andy says to them, but they never come back.
actually, we're lawyers representing his great-aunt lita.
she passed -- god rest her soul -- but left andy a sizable estate.
Yeah. So, are you a friend of his?
I used to be, yeah. I don't see much of andy anymore.
Andy? Andy kicks ass, man. - Is that right?
Yeah. Andy can get you into anything.
he even got me backstage at aerosmith once. It was beautiful, bro.
how about busing a table or two, webber?
Yeah, you bet, boss.
look, if you want to find him, try orchard street.
just look for a van with the barbarian queen painted on the side.
barbarian queen.
she's riding a polar bear. It's kind of hard to miss.
I'm sorry. I'm starting to like this dude. That van is sweet.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
Sam, you look like you're sucking on a lemon.
this andrew gallagher -- he's the second guy like this we've found, dean.
demon came to them when they were kids. Now they're killing people.
we don't know what andrew gallagher is. Could be innocent.
my visions haven't been wrong yet.
what's your point?
my point is I'm one of them. - No, you're not.
Dean, the demon said he had plans for me and children like me.
yeah?
maybe this is his plan. Maybe we're all a bunch of psychic freaks.
maybe we're all supposed to be
killers? - Yeah.
so the demon wants you out there, killing with your minds?
give me a break. You're not a murderer, sam!
you don't have it in your bones.
no?
last I checked, I kill all kinds of things.
those things were asking for it.
there's a difference.
got him.
that's him, that older guy. He's the shooter.
well, you keep on him. I'll stick with andy.
Hey! - Hey.
this is a cherry ride. - Yeah. Thanks.
man, you know,'67 -- impala's best year, if you ask me.
this is a serious classic.
you know, I just rebuilt her, too. Can't let a car like this one go.
damn straight.
Hey. Could I have it? - Sure, man.
sweet.
hop right in there. There you go. Very nice.
take it easy. - All right.
Hello? Yeah.
Hello? Yeah.
Dean, andy's got the impala!
I know! He just sort of asked me for it, and I let him take it.
you what?
he full-on obi-wan'd me. It's mind control, man.
I kept him out of the gun store.
I thought he was okay.
I thought he was past it. At least...
I should've stayed with him.
Andy! What's up, dog?
what are you doing here?
D-Dr. Jennings.
he's dead.
Oh, no, I-I'm sorry.
I don't know. I-I...
I just -- I was upset, and I wanted to see you.
well, I'm glad you did. I, um...
I missed you.
Oh, you know what? Some guys were here this morning, looking for you.
what guys?
thank god!
I'm sorry, baby. I'll never leave you again.
at least he left the keys in it.
Yeah. Real samaritan, this guy.
it looks like he can't work his mojo just by twitching his nose. He's got to use verbal commands.
the doctor had just gotten off his cellphone when he stepped in front of that bus.
Andy must've called him or something.
I don't know. Maybe. - Beg your pardon?
I just don't know if he's our guy, sam.
you had O. J. Convicted before he got out of his bronco, and you have doubts about this?
he doesn't seem like the stone-cold killer type. That's all.
and O. J. Was guilty.
either way, how are we gonna track this guy down?
not a problem.
not exactly an inconspicuous ride.
let's have a look.
Oh, come on.
this is -- this is magnificent. That's what this is.
not exactly a serial killer's lair, though.
there's no clown paintings on the walls or scissors stuck in victims' photos.
I like the tiger.
Hegel? Kant?
Wittgenstein? That's some pretty heavy reading, dean.
Yeah, and, uh...
Moby dick's bong.
you know, one day I'd love to just sit down and eat something that I didn't have to microwave at a minimart.
what I don't get is the motive. The doctor was squeaky clean.
why would andy waste him?
if it is andy.
dude, enough. - Why?
the doctor was mind-controlled in front of a bus.
Andy just happens to have the power of mind control. You do the math.
I don't think the guy has it in him.
how the hell would you know?
why are you bending over backwards defending him?
cause you're not right about this.
about andy?
Hey! You think I haven't seen you two?
why are you following me?
well, we're lawyers. A relative of yours has
tell the truth! - That's what
we hunt demons. - What?
demons and spirits. Things your worst nightmares wouldn't even touch.
Sam's my brother. - Dean, shut up.
I'm trying. He's psychic, like you. Well, not really like you.
he thinks you're a murderer, and he's afraid he's gonna become one himself cause you're all part of something that's terrible.
I hope to hell that he's wrong, but I'm starting to get scared he might be right.
okay, you know what? Just leave me alone.
all right?
what are you doing? Look, I-I said, leave me alone.
get out of here! Just start driving and never stop!
doesn't seem to work on me, andy.
what?
you can make people do things, can't you?
you can tell them what to think.
that's crazy.
all started a year ago, didn't it?
after you turned 22. Little stuff at first, then you got better at controlling it.
how do you know all this?
cause the same thing happened to me, andy. My mom died in a fire, too.
I have abilities, too.
you see, we're connected, you and me.
just -- just get out of here!
why did you tell the doctor to walk in front of a bus?
what?
why did you kill him? - I didn'T.
Hello?
sure.
I can do that.
Hey!
lady, what are you doing?! - It's gonna be okay.
lady, no. No!
Sam? What is it?
I didn't do anything to him.
a woman. A woman burning alive.
what else you get?
a gas station. A woman is gonna kill herself.
what does he mean, "going to"?
shut up.
she gets triggered by a call on her cell.
when? - I don't know.
as long as we keep our eyes on this son of a bitch, he can't hurt her.
I didn't hurt anybody! - Yeah, not yet.
go.
no. Not you.
you're staying here with me.
Hey, it's me. She's dead. Burned up, just like you said.
when?
minutes before I got here. The smell hasn't even cleared.
what's up with your visions? This wasn't even a head start.
I can't control them. I don't know what the hell is going on.
you were with andy when this whole thing went down, so it can't be him.
it's got to be somebody else.
that doesn't make any sense.
what else is new? I'll dig around here, see what else I can find.
you get these premonitions of people about to die?
that's impossible.
a lot of people would say the same thing about what you do.
death visions? - Yeah.
dude, that sucks.
when I got my mind thing, it was like a gift.
it was like I won the lotto.
but you still live in a van.
I don't get it. You could have anything you ever wanted.
Yeah, but I-I got everything I need.
so you're really not a killer, huh?
that's what I've been trying to tell you.
that's good.
that means there's hope for both of us.
victim's name was holly beckett. 41. Single.
who is she? - Never heard of her.
I called ash on the way over. He came up with a little something.
apparently holly beckett gave birth when she was 18 years old, back in 1983
same day you were born, andy.
Andy, were you adopted?
well, yeah.
you were? And you neglected to mention that?
it never really came up. I mean, I never knew my birth parents, and, like you said, my adopted mom died when I was a baby.
do you think this holly woman could actually be
I don't know. Tried to get a copy of the birth records, but they're sealed in the county office.
well, screw that.
probably shouldn't have let you kids in here.
no. It'll all be fine, all right?
just go get a cup of coffee, all right?
these aren't the droids you're looking for.
awesome.
I got it. - Yeah?
Yeah.
Andy, it's true.
Holly beckett was your birth mother.
does anyone have a vicodin?
Dr. Jennings was her doctor, too.
I mean, he oversaw the adoption.
you have a solid connection to both of them.
Yeah, but I didn't kill them. - We believe you.
Yeah. - But, uh, who did?
I think I got a pretty good guess.
Holly beckett gave birth to twins.
I have an evil twin.
Holly put you and your brother up for adoption.
and you went to the gallagher family, obviously, and your brother went to the weems family from upstate.
Andy, how you doing? Still with us?
um...what was my brother's name?
here. Um, ansem weems?
he's got a local address. - He lives here?
let's get a look at him.
got his picture coming over from the dmv right now.
hate to kick you while you're freaked.
take a look at that.
Hey, trace? - Yeah?
you and andy, you guys went together for a while, didn't you?
Yeah, webber, why?
I don't know. Just wondering. I was wondering how you felt about him these days.
I mean, I've seen you guys together. It seems like there's still something there.
were you guys ever, like, serious?
Um...no.
come on, trace. Tell the truth.
all right, andy, tell us everything you know about this guy.
I don't know much. Webber shows up one day like eight months ago, acting like he's my best friend in the world.
he's kind of weird, like trying too hard, you know?
he must've known you guys are twins.
why did he change his name? Why not tell you the truth?
Sam? - Oh, god!
Hey. Hey!
I take my ladies here.
they like it.
well, I mean, I like it, so, of course, they do, too.
please. I just want to go home.
stop crying.
Hey.
I get it. I see what you see in andy.
I mean, he's a genius. The books he reads
he's gonna be a great man someday.
but he is my family, not yours.
you can't have him.
you're not gonna have anything after tonight.
Dean, you should stay back.
no argument here. I had my head screwed with enough for one day.
I'm coming with you. - Andy
that's tracy out there, and I'm coming.
okay. Ch-ch-- slower.
I want you to listen to me very carefully, okay?
when we're done here...
...I want you to head over to the edge of that dam, okay?
okay.
and when you get there...
...you're gonna think you can fly.
and you're just gonna step right off.
you -- you can fly, can't you?
Yeah. I think so.
you might get scared, but I want you to say that it's okay.
just tell yourself, "everything is okay.
get out of the car! Now!
you really don't want to do this.
trace, give me your hand. Come here, come here.
I couldn't control myself.
Hey! Don't move. Don't move!
No! No! - I will kill you!
Andy! Hey, hey, hey! No! No! I'll handle this!
I will kill you!
Andy, listen to me! Just listen to me!
Tracy, stop! I said, stop it!
how did you do that? - Practice, bro.
if you just practiced, you would know.
sometimes... you don't need to use your words.
if you have to, all you need is this.
sometimes the headache is worth it.
you twisted son of a bitch!
back off, andy! Or tracy is gonna do a little flying.
aren't you, trace?
I'm stronger than you. I can do it.
okay, okay. Okay.
all right, just... please don't hurt her.
don't be mad at me, okay? I know. It's all wrong.
I didn't mean for this to happen. It's just...
she's trying to come between us.
you're insane. - She's garbage!
man, they all are!
we can push them. We can make them do whatever we want!
are you really -- are you really this stupid? Is it
you learn you got a twin, you call him up, you go out for a drink.
you don't start killing people!
I wanted to tell you for so long, bro, but...
he didn't let me. He said I had to wait until the time
who? - The man with the yellow eyes.
what are you talking about?
he came to me... in my dream.
he said I was special.
he told me he's got big plans for me.
wait till you see what's in store, andy, for both of us.
see, he's the one who told me that I had a brother, a twin.
why did you kill our mother?
and why dr. Jennings?
because they split us up!
they ruined our lives, andy!
we could've been together this whole time instead of alone.
I couldn't let them do that. I couldn't let them get away with that.
no.
I see you.
Bye-bye.
and you all saw it happen.
Yeah. We did.
look at him. He's getting better at it.
she won't even look at me.
Yeah, she's pretty shaken up.
no, it's -- this is different.
this is
I never used my mind thing on her before, before last night.
she's scared of me now.
Andy, I hate to do this, but, um...
we have to get out of here. Here.
I wrote down my cell.
you don't have to be alone in this, all right? If anything comes up, you can call me up.
wh-what am I supposed to do now?
you be good, andy...
or we'll be back.
looks like I was right.
about what? - Andy.
he's a killer after all.
no, he's a hero. He saved his girlfriend's life. He saved my life.
bottom line, last night he wasted somebody.
Yeah, but he's not a foaming-at-the-mouth psycho.
he was just -- he was pushed into that.
Webber was pushed, too, in his own way.
Max miller was pushed. Hell, I was pushed by jessica's death.
what's your point, sam?
right circumstances, everyone is capable of murder -- everyone.
maybe that's what the demon is doing -- pushing us, finding ways to break us.
we don't know what the demon wants, okay?
quit worrying about it.
you know, I heard you before, dean, when andy made you tell the truth.
you're just as scared of this as I am.
that was mind control! It's like being roofied man. That doesn't count.
no, I-I'm calling do-over. - What are you, 7?
doesn't matter. We just got to keep doing what we're doing, find that evil son of a bitch, and kill it.
Yeah. I guess.
Hello?
Ellen. What's going on?
Yeah. We'll be right there.
go pull up another case of beer.
mom -- - now. Please?
so, you, uh, you want to tell me about this last hunt of yours?
Nope. - Not really.
no offense. Just kind of a family thing.
not anymore.
I got this stuff from ash.
andrew gallagher's house burned down on his 6-month birthday, just like your house.
you think it was the demon both times, don't you? You think it went after gallagher's family?
Yeah, we think so. - Sam.
Why? - None of your business.
you mind your tongue with me, boy.
this isn't just your war. This is war.
something big and bad is coming, and it's coming fast, and their side holds all the cards.
now, at best, all we got is us -- together.
no secrets or half-truths here.
there are people out there like andy gallagher...
like me...
and, um...
we all have some kind of ability.
ability? - Yeah.
a psychic ability.
me, I have, um...
I have visions...
premonitions. I don't know. It's different for everybody.
the demon said he had plans for people like us.
what kind of plans?
we don't really know for sure.
these people out there, these psychics, are they dangerous?
no.
not all of them.
but some are. Some are very dangerous.
how many?
we've been able to track a clear pattern so far.
they've all had house fires on the night of the kid's 6-month birthday.
that's not true.
what?
Webber or ansem weems or whatever his name is
I looked at his files, and there was no house fire.
there's nothing out of the ordinary.
which breaks pattern. So if there's any others like him, there would be nothing in the system, no way to track them all down.
and so who knows how many of them are really out there?
Jo, honey? - Yeah?
you better break out the whiskey instead.
what's GOING ON? OH, MY GOD.
get A DOCTOR.
run!
what HAPPENED? TALK TO ME.
dogs.
stay WITH US, BABY!
dogs -- BLACK DOGS.
Robert, DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!
so MUCH FOR OUR LOW PROFILE.
you GOT A WARRANT IN ST. LOUIS,
and NOW YOU'RE OFFICIALLY IN THE FEDS' DATABASE.
du, I'M LIKE DILLINGER OR SOMETHING.
Dean, IT'S NOT FUNNY.
it MAKES THE JOB HARDER. WE GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL NOW.
well, WHAT DO THEY GOT ON YOU?
I'm SURE THEY JUST HAVEN'T POSTED IT YET.
no ACCESSORY, NOTHIN SHUT UP.
[ Chuckles ] YOU'RE JEALOUS.
no, I'M NOT! UH-HUH.
all RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU GOT ON THE CASE THERE,
you INNOCENT, HARMLESS YOUNG MAN, YOU?
architect SEAN BOYDEN PLUMMETED TO HIS DEATH "FROM THE ROOF OF HIS HOME A CONDOMINIUM HE DESIGNED.
build A HIGH-RISE AND JUMP OFF -- THAT'S CLASSY.
when DID HE CALL ANIMAL CONTROL? TWO DAYS EARLIER.
did HE ACTUALLY SAY "BLACK DOG"? YEAH.
vicious, WILD, BLACK DOG.
the AUTHORITIES COULDN'T FIND IT, AND NO ONE ELSE SAW IT.
in FACT, THE AUTHORITIES ARE A LITTLE CONFUSED
as TO HOW A WILD DOG COULD GET PAST THE DOORMAN,
take THE ELEVATOR UP,
and START ROAMING THE HALLS OF THE CUSHIEST JOINT IN TOWN.
after THAT, NO MORE CALLS. HE DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK.
two DAYS LATER, HE TAKES A SWAN DIVE.
you THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH AN ACTUAL BLACK DOG?
well, MAYBE.
what's THE LORE ON IT? IT'S ALL PRETTY VAGUE.
there ARE SPECTRAL BLACK DOGS ALL OVER THE WORLD,
but SOME SAY THEY'RE ANIMAL SPIRITS, OTHERS SAY DEATH OMENS.
but ANYWAYS, WHATEVER THEY ARE, THEY'RE BIG, NASTY...
Yeah, BET THEY COULD HUMP THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR LEG.
look AT THAT ONE. HUH? [ CHUCKLES ]
what? THEY COULD.
so, YOU AND SEAN BOYDEN WERE BUSINESS PARTNERS
for ALMOST 10 YEARS, RIGHT?
that's RIGHT.
now, ONE MORE TIME, THIS IS FOR...
a TRIBUTE FOR MR. BOYDEN -- ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.
funny TO YOU?
no, IT -- IT'S JUST A TRIBUTE.
Yeah.
see, SEAN ALWAYS GOT THE TRIBUTES.
he KILLS HIMSELF, LEAVES ME AND HIS FAMILY BEHIND,
but HE GETS ANOTHER TRIBUTE.
right.
any IDEA WHY HE'D DO SUCH A THING?
I HAVE NO CLUE. HE LIVED A CHARMED LIFE.
how SO?
he WAS A FLAT-OUT GENIUS.
I MEAN, I'M CAPABLE, BUT, NEXT TO HIM, UH...
it WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY EITHER. NO?
you WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?
there WAS A TIME WHERE HE ULDN'T EVEN DESIGN A PUP TENT.
so, WHAT CHANGED? YOU GOT ME.
but OVERNIGHT HE GETS THIS HUGE COMMISSION,
and HE STARTS DESIGNING.
he STARTS DESIGNING THE MOST INGENIOUS BUILDINGS.
anyone HAS EVER SEEN.
it WAS LIKE THE LEVEL OF VAN GOGH AND MOZART.
it... WHAT?
it's FUNNY -- TRUE GENIUSES,
they SEEM TO DIE YOUNG, DON'T THEY?
to HAVE THAT KIND OF TALENT,
why... WHY JUST THROW IT AWAY?
so?
the SECRETARY'S ME IS CARLY. SHE'S 23.
she KAYAKS...
and THEY'RE REAL.
you DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ASK HER
if SHE'S SEEN ANY BLACK DOGS, DID YOU?
every COMPLAINT CALLED IN THIS WEEK
about ANYTHING BIG, BLACK, OR DOGLIKE.
there's 19 CALLS IN ALL,
and, UH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
you MEAN, CARLY'S MySpace ADDRESS?
Yeah, MySpace -- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
seriously, IS THAT LIKE SOME SORT OF PORN SITE?
I SWEAR, IF THIS IS ANOTHER FREAKIN' POMERANIAN
barking IN THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD...
afternoon, MA'AM.
uh, ANIMAL CONTROL.
Oh, SOMEONE ALREADY CAME YESTERDAY.
Oh, WE'RE JUST FOLLOWING UP.
we're LOOKING FOR DR. SYLVIA PERLMAN.
the DOCTOR, WELL, SHE...
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN SHE'LL BE BACK. SHE LEFT TWO DAYS AGO.
okay. AND YOU ARE?
I'm MISS PERLMAN'S MAID.
so, WHERE DID THE DOCTOR GO?
I'm NOT SURE.
she JUST PACKED AND WENT. SHE DIDN'T SAY WHERE.
that STRAY DOG, DID YOU FIND IT FINALLY?
uh, NOT YET.
you DIDN'T EVER HAPPEN TO SEE THE DOG YOURSELF, DID YOU?
well, NO. I NEVER EVEN HEARD IT.
I WAS ALMOST STARTING TO THINK THE DOCTOR WAS IMAGINING THINGS,
but SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT, SO...
you KNOW, I READ SHE WAS THE CHIEF SURGEON AT THE HOSPITAL.
so SHE'S GOT TO BE, WHAT, 42, 43?
that's PRETTY YOUNG FOR THAT JOB.
youngest IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLACE.
she GOT THE POSITION 10 YEARS AGO.
an OVERNIGHT SUCCESS, 10 YEARS AGO.
Yeah, WE KNOW A GUY LIKE THAT.
Oh, LOOK AT THIS.
lloyd's BAR.
miss PERLMAN?
I've BEEN CALLING FOR HOURS!
you NEED TO VACATE THE ROOM, OR YOU GOT TO PAY FOR THE NIGHT!
okay, NO PROBLEM.
Hey.
yeah?
that's WEIRD.
what? THINK SOMEONE PLANTED THESE?
in THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE WEEDS?
these ARE, UH, WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM?
yarrow FLOWERS? YEAH.
used FOR CERTAIN RITUALS, AREN'T THEY?
Yeah, ACTUALLY, SUMMONING RITUALS.
so, TWO PEOPLE BECOME SUDDEN SUCCESSES ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO,
right AROUND THE TIME THEY WERE HANGING OUT HERE AT LLOYD'S.
where THERE JUST HAPPENS TO BE A CROSSROADS.
you THINK? LET'S FIND OUT.
seem ABOUT THE DEAD CENTER TO YOU?
Yahtzee.
I'd BE WILLING TO BET THAT'S GRAVEYARD DIRT.
and A BLACK CAT BONE.
that's SERIOUS SPELLWORK.
I MEAN, THAT'S DEEP SOUTH HOODOO STUFF.
used TO SUMMON A DEMON.
not JUST SUMMON ONE.
crossroads ARE WHERE PACTS ARE MADE.
these PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING DEALS WITH THE DAMNED THING.
[ sarcastically ] YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THAT ALWAYS ENDS GOOD.
they're SEEING DOGS, ALL RIGHT...
but NOT BLACK DOGS.
they're SEEING HELLHOUNDS -- DEMONIC PIT BULLS.
whoever THIS DEMON IS, IT'S BACK AND IT'S COLLECTING.
and THAT DOCTOR LADY, WHEREVER SHE'S RUNNING,
she AIN'T RUNNING FAST ENOUGH.
I WANT TO PLAY GUITAR.
I WANT TO BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD.
if THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
So...how DO WE -- DO WE SHAKE ON IT?
Sam: SO, IT'S JUST LIKE THE ROBERT JOHNSON LEGEND, RIGHT?
I MEAN, "SELLING YOUR SOUL AT THE CROSSROADS" KIND OF DEAL?
except THAT WASN'T A LEGEND. YOU KNOW HIS MUSIC.
you DON'T KNOW ROBERT JOHNSON SONGS?
Sam, THERE'S OCCULT REFERENCES ALL OVER HIS LYRICS.
I MEAN, "CROSS ROAD BLUES," "ME AND THE DEVIL BLUES,"
story GOES THAT HE DIED CHOKING ON HIS OWN BLOOD.
he WAS HALLUCINATING AND MUTTERING ABOUT BIG, EVIL DOGS.
and NOW IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN. YEAH.
we GOT TO FIND OUT IF ANYONE ELSE STRUCK ANY BARGAINS.
right, SO, WE GOT TO CLEAN UP THESE PEOPLE'S MESS FOR THEM?
they're NOT EXACTLY SQUEAKY-CLEAN.
nobody PUT A GUN TO THEIR HEAD
and FORCED THEM TO PLAY "LET'S MAKE A DEAL.
so, WHAT, WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE THEM TO DIE?
somebody GOES OVER NIAGARA IN A BARREL,
you GONNA JUMP IN TO TRY TO SAVE THEM?
all RIGHT...FINE.
rituals LIKE THIS,
you GOT TO PUT YOUR OWN PHOTO INTO THE MIX, RIGHT?
so THIS GUY PROBABLY SUMMONED THE THING.
let's SEE IF ANYONE INSIDE KNOWS HIM...
if HE'S STILL ALIVE.
what's THIS GUY'S NAME, AGAIN?
apparent QUITE THE REGULAR AT LLOYD'S.
this HOUSE PROBABLY AIN'T UP NEXT ON "MTV CRIBS," IS IT?
[ chuckling ] YEAH.
so, WHATEVER KIND OF DEAL HE MADE...
wasn't FOR CASH. AH, WHO KNOWS?
maybe HIS PLACE IS FULL OF BABES IN PRINCESS LEIA BIKINIS.
I'm JUST SAYING, THIS GUY'S GOT ONE EPIC BILL COME DUE.
hope AT LEAST HE ASKED FOR SOMETHING FUN.
look AT THAT.
what IS THAT, PEPPER?
who THE HELL ARE YOU?
I'm NOT BUYING ANYTHING.
whoa, LOOKS LIKE YOU WENT FOR THE WRONG SHAKER, THERE.
usually, WHEN YOU WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING EVIL OUT,
you GO FOR THE SALT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
talking ABOUT THIS.
tell ME...
you SEEN THAT HELLHOUND YET?
look, WE WANT TO HELP.
please, JUST 5 MINUTES.
so, WHAT IS THAT STUFF OUT FRONT?
goofer DUST.
what, YOU BOYS THINK YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SOMETHING,
but NOT GOOFER DUST?
well, WE KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,
just ENOUGH TO MAKE US DANGEROUS.
what IS IT?
hoodoo.
my GRANDMA TAUGHT ME.
keeps OUT DEMONS.
demons, WE KNOW.
well, THEN, KEEP IT.
maybe IT'LL DO YOU SOME GOOD.
4 MINUTES LEFT.
Mr. DARROW... WE KNOW YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
Yeah, THAT YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO.
but IT'S NOT HOPELESS, ALL RIGHT?
there's GOT TO BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO.
listen, I GET THAT YOU BOYS WANT TO HELP,
but SOMETIMES A PERSON MAKES THEIR BED
and THEY JUST GOT TO LIE DOWN IN IT.
I'm THE ONE CALLED THAT DEMON IN THE FIRST PLACE.
What'd YOU DO IT FOR?
I WAS WEAK.
I MEAN, WHO DON'T WANT TO BE GREAT?
who DON'T WANT THEIR LIFE TO MEAN SOMETHING?
I JUST... [SIGHS]
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE PRICE.
was IT WORTH IT?
hell, NO.
course, I ASKED FOR TALENT.
should HAVE GONE FOR FAME.
I'm STILL BROKE...AND LONELY.
just NOW I GOT THIS PILE OF PAINTINGS DON'T NOBODY WANT.
that WASN'T THE WORST.
go ON.
demon DIDN'T LEAVE.
I NEVER COUNTED ON THAT.
after OUR DEAL WAS DONE,
the DAMN THING STAYED AT LLOYD'S FOR A WEEK,
just CHATTING, MAKING MORE DEALS.
I TRIED TO WARN FOLKS,
but WHO GONNA LISTEN TO AN OLD DRUNK?
how MANY OTHERS ARE THERE?
uh, THIS ARCHITECT, A DOCTOR LADY.
I KEPT UP WITH THEM. THEY BEEN IN THE PAPERS.
[ sighs ] AT LEAST THEY GOT FAMOUS.
who ELSE, GEORGE? COME ON, THINK.
Oh, ONE MORE.
uh, NICE GUY, TOO.
Hudson -- EVANI THINK.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE ASKED FOR.
don't MATTER NOW. WE DONE FOR.
no. NO, THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY.
you DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T WANT A WAY.
look, YOU DON'T...
look, I CALLED THAT THING!
I BROUGHT IT ON MYSELF!
I BROUGHT IT ON THEM.
I'm GOING TO HELL, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
all I WANT IS TO FINISH MY LAST PAINTING.
day OR TWO, I'M DONE.
I'm JUST TRYING TO HOLD HIM OFF TILL THEN,
buy A LITTLE TIME.
okay, BOYS, TIME YOU WENT.
go HELP SOMEBODY THAT WANTS HELP.
we CAN'T JUST -- GET OUT!
I GOT WORK TO DO.
you DON'T REALLY WANT TO DIE.
I DON'T?
I'm TIRED.
are YOU SPYING ON THE NEIGHBORS?
no, I, UH, I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING IN THE YARD,
but IT'S NOTHING.
you ALL READY TO GO?
you KNOW, IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'd SAY THAT YOU WANT ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.
of COURSE NOT.
it's JUST, YOU'VE...
you've BARELY SEEN YOUR SISTER SINCE SHE HAD THE BABY.
well, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ALL WEEKEND?
um, NOT MUCH.
I GOT SOME BILLS TO PAY.
come HERE.
I'll MISS YOU.
you BETTER.
you KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?
forever.
of COURSE. EVAN, ARE YOU OKAY?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'M FINE.
now, GET GOING.
okay, I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE.
Hey, SWEETIE?
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
yes?
Evan HUDSON? YEAH.
you EVER BEEN TO A BAR CALLED LLOYD'S?
would HAVE BEEN ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.
come ON, WE'RE NOT DEMONS.
any OTHER BRIGHT IDEAS?
please! DON'T HURT ME.
we're NOT GONNA HURT YOU, ALL RIGHT?
we're HERE TO HELP YOU.
we KNOW ALL ABOUT THE GENIUS DEAL YOU MADE.
what? HOW?
doesn't MATTER.
all THAT MATTERS IS WE'RE TRYING TO STOP IT.
how DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT LYING?
well, YOU DON'T,
but YOU'RE KIND OF RUNNING LOW ON OPTIONS, THERE, BUDDY BOY.
c-can YOU STOP IT?
don't KNOW. WE'LL TRY.
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.
of COURSE YOU DON'T. NOT NOW.
Dean, STOP.
What'd YOU ASK FOR, ANYWAY, EV, HUH?
never NEED VIAGRA, BOWL A PERFECT GAME, WHAT?
my WIFE.
right, GETTING THE GIRL. THAT'S WORTH A TRIP TO HELL FOR.
Dean, STOP.
no. HE'S RIGHT. I MADE THE DEAL.
nobody TWISTED MY ARM.
that, UH, WOMAN,
or WHATEVER SHE WAS, AT THE BAR,
she SAID I COULD HAVE ANYTHING I WANTED.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS NUTS, AT FIRST, BUT...
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS -- I WAS DESPERATE.
desperate?
Julie WAS DYING.
you DID IT TO SAVE HER?
she HAD CANCER. THEY HAD STOPPED TREATMENT.
they WERE MOVING HER INTO HOSPICE.
they KEPT SAYING, "MATTER OF DAYS.
so, YEAH, I MADE THE DEAL... AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.
I'd HAVE DIED FOR HER ON THE SPOT.
did YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HER IN ALL THIS?
I DID THIS FOR HER.
you SURE ABOUT THAT?
I THINK YOU DID IT FOR YOURSELF...
so YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT HER.
but, GUESS WHAT, SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU NOW.
what IF SHE KNEW HOW MUCH IT COST?
what IF SHE KNEW IT COST YOUR SOUL?
how DO YOU THINK SHE'D FEEL?
okay, THAT'S ENOUGH.
Evan, SIT TIGHT, ALL RIGHT? WE'RE GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT.
you ALL RIGHT? WHY WOULDN'T I BE?
Hey, I GOT AN IDEA.
you THROW GEORGE'S HOODOO AT THAT HELLHOUND,
keep IT AWAY FROM EVAN AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
I'm GONNA GO TO THE CROSSROADS AND SUMMON THE DEMON.
summon -- ARE YOU NUTS?
maybe A LITTLE.
but I CAN TRAP IT.
I CAN EXORCISE IT,
and I CAN BUY US TIME TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT.
Yeah, BUT HOW MUCH TIME? I DON'T KNOW. AWHILE.
it's NOT EASY FOR THOSE SUCKERS,
to CLAW THEIR WAY BACK FROM HELL AND INTO THE SUNSHINE.
no. NO WAY.
not ALLOWED TO SAY NO, SAMMY, UNLESS YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA.
Dean, YOU CAN FORGET IT, ALL RIGHT?
I'm NOT LETTING YOU SUMMON THAT DEMON,
because I DON'T LIKE WHERE YOUR HEAD IS AT RIGHT NOW.
and I THINK I KNOW WHY.
we DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
dad.
you THINK MAYBE DAD MADE ONE OF THESE DEALS, HUH?
hell, I'VE BEEN THINKING IT.
I'm SURE YOU'VE BEEN THINKING IT, TOO.
it FITS, DOESN'T IT?
I'm ALIVE, DAD'S DEAD. YELLOW-EYED DEMON WAS INVOLVED.
what IF HE DID?
what IF HE STRUCK A DEAL?
my LIFE FOR HIS SOUL.
EVAN: HEY, GUYS, I THINK I HEAR IT! IT'S OUTSIDE!
just KEEP HIM ALIVE, OKAY?
go!
so, WHAT BRINGS A GUY LIKE YOU TO A PLACE LIKE THIS?
you CALLED ME?
I'm JUST GLAD IT WORKED.
first TIME?
you COULD SAY THAT.
Oh, COME ON, NOW.
don't SELL YOURSELF SHORT.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU, DEAN WINCHESTER.
so YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
I GET THE NEWSLETTER.
well, DON'T KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.
what HAVE YOU HEARD?
well, I HEARD YOU WERE HANDSOME.
you're JUST EDIBLE.
what CAN I DO FOR YOU, DEAN?
maybe WE SHOULD DO THIS IN MY CAR.
nice AND PRIVATE.
sounds GOOD TO ME.
what IS THAT STUFF?
are YOU SERIOUS?
Yeah. AFRAID SO.
look, BELIEVE ME, DON'T BELIEVE ME -- WHATEVER YOU WANT.
just WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY INSIDE THIS CIRCLE, ALL RIGHT?
so, I WAS HOPING WE COULD STRIKE A DEAL.
that's WHAT I DO.
I WANT EVAN HUDSON RELEASED FROM HIS CONTRACT.
so SORRY, DARLING. THAT'S NOT NEGOTIABLE.
I'll MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE.
Oh, REALLY?
what ARE YOU OFFERING?
me.
well, WELL, WELL.
you'd SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S.
like FATHER, LIKE SON.
that's THE LAST OF IT.
you DID KNOW ABOUT YOUR DAD'S DEAL, RIGHT?
his LIFE FOR YOURS.
Oh, I DIDN'T MAKE THE DEAL MYSELF,
but, BOY, I WISH I HAD.
after YOU.
such A GENTLEMAN.
a DEVIL'S TRAP?
you've GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
[ growling ] WHAT?
you HEAR THAT?
no. WHERE?
right OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
just DON'T MOVE, ALL RIGHT?
stay WHERE YOU ARE.
you STUPID, STUPID...
I SHOULD RIP YOU LIMB FROM LIMB.
take YOUR BEST SHOT.
no, I DON'T THINK SO.
I'm NOT GONNA PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY.
yeah? WHY NOT?
cause YOUR MISERY IS THE WHOLE POINT.
it's TOO MUCH FUN TO WATCH.
knowing HOW YOUR DADDY DIED FOR YOU,
how HE SOLD HIS SOUL.
I MEAN, THAT'S GOT TO HURT.
he's ALL YOU EVER THINK ABOUT.
you WAKE UP, AND YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS "I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE."
you're ALL LIT UP WITH PAIN.
I MEAN, YOU LOVED HIM SO MUCH.
and IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.
you BLEW IT, DEAN.
I COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU WHAT YOU NEED.
what DO I NEED?
your FATHER.
I COULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK.
your LOSS.
see YA, DEAN.
I WISH YOU A NICE, LONG LIFE.
hold ON.
do YOU STILL HEAR IT? NO.
is IT OVER?
it's HERE!
I JUST CAN'T LEAVE YOU LIKE THIS.
besides, YOU DIDN'T CALL ME HERE TO BARGAIN FOR EVAN.
not REALLY.
can YOU BRING HIM BACK, MY DAD?
of COURSE I CAN, JUST AS HE WAS.
your DAD WOULD LIVE A LONG, NATURAL LIFE,
like HE WAS MEANT TO.
that's A PROMISE.
what ABOUT ME?
I COULD GIVE YOU 10 YEARS, 10 LONG, GOOD YEARS WITH HIM.
that's A LIFETIME.
the FAMILY COULD BE TOGETHER AGAIN...
the WINCHESTER BOYS ALL REUNITED.
look, YOUR DAD IS SUPPOSED TO BE ALIVE.
you're SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.
so, WE'LL JUST SET THINGS STRAIGHT,
put THINGS BACK IN THEIR NATURAL ORDER,
and YOU GET 10 EXTRA YEARS ON TOP.
that's A BONUS.
you THINK YOU COULD...
throw IN A SET OF STEAK KNIVES?
you KNOW, THIS SMARTASS SELF-DEFENSE MECHANISM OF YOURS...
now YOU'RE REALLY TRAPPED.
that's GOT TO HURT.
let ME OUT NOW.
sure.
we JUST GOT TO MAKE A LITTLE DEAL HERE FIRST.
you CALL OFF YOUR HELLHOUND AND LET EVAN GO.
then I'LL LET YOU GO.
I CAN'T BREAK A BINDING CONTRACT.
and BY "CAN'T," YOU MEAN "DON'T WANT TO"?
last CHANCE.
Evan AND HIS WIFE GET TO LIVE TO A RIPE OLD AGE.
GOING...GOING...
let's TALK ABOUT THIS. OKAY, GONE.
EVAN: CAN'T YOU SEE IT? NO. STAY INSIDE THE CIRCLE!
come ON, DEAN.
what ARE YOU DOING?
Oh, YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO ON A LITTLE TRIP.
way DOWN SOUTH.
look, FORGET EVAN. THINK OF YOUR DAD.
circle's BROKEN! COME ON!
Release!
what THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?
sealing THE DEAL.
I USUALLY LIKE TO BE WARNED,
before I'M VIOLATED WITH DEMON TONGUE.
Evan HUDSON IS FREE.
he AND HIS WIFE WILL LIVE LONG LIVES.
how DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT LYING?
my WORD IS MY BOND.
Oh, REALLY? IT IS WHEN I MAKE A DEAL.
it's THE RULES.
you GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.
now LET ME GO.
you're GONNA DOUBLE-CROSS ME?
funny HOW I'M THE TRUSTWORTHY ONE.
you KNOW, YOU RENEGE, SEND ME TO HELL,
sooner OR LATER I'M GONNA CLIMB OUT,
and SKINNING EVAN HUDSON WILL BE THE FIRST THING THAT I DO.
knew WHAT?
where YOUR DAD IS.
you SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT DEAL.
see, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HELL, BUT IT'S JUST A WORD.
doesn't EVEN COME CLOSE TO DESCRIBING THE REAL.
shut YOUR MOUTH, BITCH.
if YOU COULD SEE YOUR POOR DADDY,
hear THE SOUNDS HE MAKES 'CAUSE HE CAN'T EVEN SCREAM.
how ABOUT I SEND YOU BACK THERE?
what?
how DID I GET HERE?
demons LIE ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?
maybe SHE WAS LYING.
come ON. IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOU THINK?
how COULD HE DO IT?
he DID IT FOR YOU.
exactly.
how AM I SUPPOSED TO LIVE WITH THAT?
you KNOW, THE THOUGHT OF HIM,
wherever HE IS RIGHT NOW...
I MEAN, HE SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE,
chasing THAT YELLOW-EYED SON OF A BITCH.
he SHOULD HAVE GONE OUT FIGHTING.
that WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HIS LEGACY, YOU KNOW?
not BARGAINING WITH THE DAMN THING.
not THIS.
how MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK DAD SAVED TOTAL?
that's NOT THE POINT, SAM.
Evan HUDSON IS SAFE BECAUSE OF WHAT DAD TAUGHT US.
that's HIS LEGACY, DEAN.
now, WE'RE STILL HERE, MAN, SO WE GOT TO KEEP GOING.
for HIM.
Dean? YEAH?
when YOU WERE TRAPPING THAT DEMON, YOU WEREN'T...
I MEAN, IT WAS ALL A TRICK, RIGHT?
you NEVER CONSIDERED ACTUALLY MAKING THAT DEAL, RIGHT?
I SWEAR IT'S NOT IN ME. IT'S NOT IN ME, I SWEAR.
we're ALL GONNA DIE.
we GOT NO CHOICE. STOP!
now, DEAN, THEY SAY YOU CAN'T PROTECT YOUR LOVED ONES FOREVER.
hands WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM!
dean: A DEMONIC VIRUS? Sam: YEAH, MORE LIKE DEMONIC GERM WARFARE.
I FEEL LIKE CHUCK HESTON IN "THE OMEGA MAN.
they're INFECTED, NOT ME!
you've KNOWN ME ALL YOUR LIFE!
let's JUST GO.
we CAN'T, 'CAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE EVERYWHERE.
man: SHE BLED ON HIM.
he's GOT THE VIRUS.
Sam: I NEED A NATIONWIDE SEARCH.
what AM I LOOKING FOR?
psychics, LIKE ME -- AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.
the YELLOW-EYED MAN... COMES TO ME IN MY DREAMS,
and TELLS ME TO DO THINGS, AWFUL THINGS.
I HAD THIS ONE DREAM...
where I SAW THIS GUY GET STABBED IN A PARKING LOT.
he HAS PLANS FOR ME.
what KIND OF PLANS?
last NIGHT I SAW YOU DIE.
right BEFORE DAD DIED, HE TOLD ME SOMETHING.
he TOLD ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.
Dean, WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?
dad WANTS US TO PICK UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF
saving PEOPLE, HUNTING THINGS, THE FAMILY BUSINESS.
that's NOT EVEN A GOOD PICTURE.
shapeshifter? EVERY CULTURE HAS A SHAPESHIFTER LORE.
something THAT CAN LOOK LIKE ANYONE?
freeze. STAY ON YOUR KNEES.
he's BEING HELD ON SUSPICION OF MURDER. MURDER?
police AND S. W.A. T. TEAMS MAINTAIN POSITION
as WE ENTER THE THIRD HOUR OF THIS INTENSE STAND-OFF.
no WORD AS YET ON THE IDENTITY OF THE SUSPECTS
something's HAPPENING.
I THINK THEY'RE OPENING A DOOR. ROGER, YOU GETTING THIS?
dean: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!
get THE HELL BACK!
and THE SECRETS WE GOT TO KEEP
Oh, COUNTLESS SECRETS.
but MOSTLY IT'S -- IT'S LONELY.
I SO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
Yeah.
Helena WAS OUR HEAD BUYER.
she -- SHE WAS FAMILY, YOU KNOW?
she SAID IT HERSELF EVERY YEAR AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.
she SAID WE WERE THE ONLY FAMILY SHE HAD.
so THERE WERE NEVER ANY SIGNS THAT SHE'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
NO...STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT, EVEN NOW.
that NIGHT, HELENA CAME BACK TO THE STORE AFTER CLOSING,
cleaned OUT ALL THE DISPLAY CASES AND THE SAFE.
Edgar, OUR NIGHT WATCHMAN
he CAUGHT HER IN THE ACT.
he DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. HE'D KNOWN HER FOR YEARS.
he CALLED ME AT HOME.
and THAT'S WHEN SHE TOOK HIS GUN?
she SHOT HIM IN THE FACE.
I HEARD HIM DIE
over THE PHONE.
any IDEA WHAT HER MOTIVE COULD HAVE BEEN?
what MOTIVE? IT MAKES NO SENSE.
why STEAL ALL THOSE DIAMONDS, ALL THAT JEWELRY AND THEN, WHAT,
just DUMP IT SOMEWHERE?
just HIDE IT AND THEN GO HOME.
the COP SAID SHE DROPPED THE HAIR DRYER IN THE BATH AND FRIED HERSELF.
they SHOULD KNOW, RIGHT?
Yeah.
well, THANKS, FRANNIE. I THINK THAT'S ALL I NEED.
Really? I MEAN, 'CAUSE I'VE GOT MORE,
you KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO INTERVIEW ME...
sometime IN PRIVATE?
Yeah.
Yeah, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
you're A TRUE PATRIOT. YOU REALLY ARE.
why DON'T YOU WRITE YOUR NUMBER DOWN THERE FOR ME ???
so YOU NEVER SAW THE SECURITY-CAMERA FOOTAGE YOURSELF, THEN.
the POLICE -- THEY TOOK ALL THE TAPES FIRST THING.
of COURSE THEY DID.
??? THIS IS IT.
freaking COPS.
they WERE JUST DOING THEIR JOB.
no, THEY'RE DOING OUR JOB, ONLY THEY DON'T KNOW IT,
so THEY SUCK AT IT.
talk TO ME ABOUT THIS BANK.
milwaukee NATIONAL TRUST -- IT WAS HIT ABOUT A MONTH AGO.
same M. O. AS THE JEWELRY STORE?
Yep, INSIDE JOB, LONGTIME EMPLOYEE,
the "NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS" TYPE.
dude ROBS THE BANK,
then GOES HOME AND SUPPOSEDLY COMMITS SUICIDE.
resnick WAS THE SECURITY GUARD ON DUTY?
Mr. RESNICK!
???
FBI, MR. RESNICK.
let ME SEE THE BADGE.
I ALREADY GAVE MY STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.
listen, RONALD,
just SOME THINGS ABOUT YOUR STATEMENT
we WANTED TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON.
you READ IT?
sure DID. COME TO LISTEN TO WHAT I GOT TO SAY?
that's WHY WE'RE HERE.
well...
come ON IN.
see, NONE OF THE COPS EVER CALLED ME BACK,
not AFTER I TOLD THEM WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON.
they ALL THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY.
first OFF, JUAN MORALES NEVER ROBBED THE MILWAUKEE NATIONAL TRUST.
that I GUARANTEE.
see, ME AND JUAN WERE FRIENDS.
he USED TO COME BACK TO THE BANK ON MY NIGHT SHIFTS,
and WE'D PLAY CARDS.
so YOU LET HIM INTO THE BANK THAT NIGHT, AFTER HOURS.
the THING I LET INTO THE BANK...
wasn't JUAN.
I MEAN, IT HAD HIS FACE, BUT IT WASN'T HIS FACE.
every DETAIL WAS PERFECT, BUT TOO PERFECT, YOU KNOW,
like IF A DOLL MAKER MADE IT,
like I WAS TALKING TO A BIG JUAN DOLL.
a JUAN DOLL?
look, THIS WASN'T THE ONLY TIME THIS HAPPENED.
there WAS THIS JEWELRY STORE, TOO,
and THE COPS AND YOU GUYS, YOU JUST WON'T SEE IT.
both CRIMES WERE PULLED BY THE SAME THING.
and WHAT'S THAT, MR. RESNICK?
chinese BEEN WORKING ON THEM FOR YEARS,
and THE RUSSIANS BEFORE THAT
part MAN, PART MACHINE,
like THE TERMINATOR, BUT THE KIND THAT CAN CHANGE ITSELF,
make ITSELF LOOK LIKE OTHER PEOPLE.
like THE ONE FROM "T2." EXACTLY!
so NOT JUST A ROBOT, MORE OF A -- A MAN-DROID.
what MAKES YOU SO SURE ABOUT THIS, RONALD?
I MADE COPIES OF ALL THE SECURITY TAPES.
I KNEW ONCE THE COPS GOT THEM, THEY'D BE BURIED. HERE.
now WATCH.
watch.
watch HIM. WATCH. WATCH.
see, LOOK, THERE IT IS!
you SEE? HE'S GOT THE LASER EYES.
cops SAID IT WAS SOME KIND OF REFLECTED LIGHT,
some KIND OF "CAMERA FLARE.
okay?
ain't NO DAMN CAMERA FLARE.
they SAY I'M A POST-TRAUMA CASE.
so WHAT? BANK GOES AND FIRES ME.
it DON'T MATTER.
the MAN-DROID IS STILL OUT THERE.
if THE LAW WON'T HUNT THIS THING DOWN,
I'll DO IT MYSELF.
you SEE, THIS THING, I-IT KILLS THE REAL PERSON,
makes IT LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE,
then IT SORT OF LIKE MORPHS INTO THAT PERSON,
and THEN IT FINDS ITS OPENING.
now, THESE ROBBERIES, THEY'RE GROUPED TOGETHER,
so I FIGURE THE MAN-DROID IS HOLED UP SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE
underground MAYBE -- I DON'T KNOW.
m-maybe THAT'S WHERE IT RECHARGES
its M-MAN-DROID BATTERIES.
okay.
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.
cause I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH
about ALL OF THIS.
there's NO SUCH THING AS MAN-DROIDS.
there's NOTHING EVIL OR INHUMAN GOING ON OUT THERE.
it's JUST PEOPLE.
nothing ELSE. YOU UNDERSTAND?
the LASER EYES -- JUST A CAMERA FLARE, MR. RESNICK.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THIS,
but YOUR FRIEND JUAN ROBBED THE BANK, AND THAT'S IT.
get OUT OF MY HOUSE!
now!
sure. FIRST THINGS FIRST.
man, THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE KICKER, STRAIGHT UP.
when YOU TOLD THAT POOR SON OF A BITCH TO
what DID YOU SAY, "REMAND" THE TAPES THAT HE COPIED?
classified EVIDENCE OF AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION"?
that's MESSED UP.
what ARE YOU, PISSED AT ME?
we COULD HAVE THROWN THE GUY A BONE.
he DID SOME GOOD LEGWORK HERE.
except FOR THE MAN-DROID PART.
I LIKED HIM.
he's NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM YOU AND ME.
people THINK WE'RE CRAZY.
except HE'S NOT A HUNTER.
he's JUST A GUY WHO STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING REAL.
if HE WERE TO GO UP AGAINST THIS THING,
he'd GET TORN APART.
better TO STAY IN THE DARK AND STAY ALIVE.
Yeah, I GUESS.
shapeshifter.
just LIKE BACK IN ST. LOUIS.
same RETINAL REACTION TO VIDEO.
eyes FLARE AT THE CAMERA.
I HATE THOSE FREAKING THINGS.
you THINK I DON'T?
one DIDN'T TURN INTO YOU AND FRAME YOU FOR MURDER.
well, WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY FLAGS GO UP ON OUR SYSTEM YET.
no, NO, THIS IS A GLITCH IN THE OVERALL GRID.
just WANT TO MAKE SURE THE BRANCH MONITORS ARE KOSHER.
better TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY, I GUESS. THAT'S THE PLAN.
all RIGHTY. YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING ELSE?
Oh, NO, NO, NO. WE'LL BE IN AND OUT. JUST A ROUTINE CHECK.
Okeydokey.
I LIKE HIM. HE SAYS "OKEYDOKEY.
what IF HE'S THE SHIFTER?
well, THEN WE FOLLOW HIM HOME,
put A SILVER BULLET THROUGH HIS CHEST PLATE.
okay. YOU GOT ANY POPCORN?
looks LIKE MR. OKEYDOKEY'S...
Okeydokey.
maybe WE JUMPED THE GUN ON THIS, DEAN.
we DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S HERE.
maybe WE SHOULD JUST GO TO THE SEWERS AND...
and...
Dean, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR EYES.
I'm GETTING THERE.
Oh, YEAH? YEAH.
wait A MINUTE.
Hello, FREAK. GOT HIM.
what?
Hello, RONALD.
this IS NOT A ROBBERY!
everybody ON THE FLOOR NOW!
get DOWN, DAMN IT!
come ON! ON THE FLOOR, ON THE FLOOR.
in THE MIDDLE!
on THE FLOOR IN THE MIDDLE.
in MIDDLE, ON THE FLOOR, COME ON!
hurry UP! COME ON!
and YOU SAID WE SHOULDN'T BRING GUNS.
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN, DEAN.
let ME DO THE TALKING.
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES YOU, AGENT JOHNSON.
there's ONLY ONE WAY IN OR OUT OF HERE,
and I CHAINED IT UP, SO NOBODY'S LEAVING, YOU UNDERSTAND?
Hey, BUDDY.
why DON'T YOU CALM DOWN? JUST CALM DOWN.
what?
you!
get ON THE FLOOR NOW!
okay, WE'RE DOING THAT.
just DON'T SHOOT ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY US.
I KNEW IT -- AS SOON AS YOU TWO LEFT.
you AIN'T FBI. WHO ARE YOU?
who ARE YOU WORKING FOR, HUH? THE MEN IN BLACK?
you WORKING FOR THE MAN-DROID?
we're NOT WORKING FOR THE MAN-DROID! YOU SHUT UP!
I AIN'T TALKING TO YOU! I DON'T LIKE YOU!
fair ENOUGH.
get OVER THERE.
frisk THEM DOWN, MAKE SURE THEY GOT NO WEAPONS. GO!
and WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
I'm NOT JUST GONNA WALK IN HERE NAKED.
give THAT THERE.
no, NO, NO, NO.
we KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY.
but THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU KEEP WAVING THAT CANNON.
why DON'T YOU LET THESE PEOPLE GO? NO!
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
if NOBODY'S GONNA STOP THIS THING,
then I'VE GOT TO DO IT MYSELF!
we BELIEVE YOU! THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
you DON'T BELIEVE ME!
nobody BELIEVES ME!
how COULD THEY?
come HERE.
what? NO.
you're HOLDING THE GUN, BOSS. YOU'RE CALLING THE SHOTS.
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. come here
it's THE BANK MANAGER.
what?
why DO YOU THINK WE GOT THESE GETUPS, HUH?
we've BEEN MONITORING THE CAMERAS IN THE BACK.
we SAW THE BANK MANAGER. WE SAW HIS EYES.
his LASER EYES?
Yes. NO. NO!
we're RUNNING OUT OF TIME. OK?
we GOT TO FIND HIM BEFORE HE CHANGES INTO SOMEONE ELSE.
like I'M GONNA LISTEN TO YOU. YOU'RE A DAMN LIAR.
I'll SHOOT YOU! GET DOWN!
take ME.
OK TAKE ME AS A HOSTAGE.
but WE GOT TO ACT FAST
because THE LONGER WE JUST SIT HERE,
the MORE TIME HE HAS TO CHANGE.
look AT ME, MAN.
I BELIEVE YOU.
you're NOT CRAZY.
there REALLY IS SOMETHING INSIDE THIS BANK.
all RIGHT.
y-you COME WITH ME.
but EVERYONE ELSE GETS IN THE VAULT!
come ON, MOVE!
move, MOVE!
then YOU LOCK IT UP.
it's OKAY, EVERYONE. JUST STAY COOL.
now SPIN THAT. SPIN THAT THERE.
who IS THAT MAN?
he's MY BROTHER.
he IS SO BRAVE.
check BEHIND THE DESK.
what THE HELL IS THAT?
Oh, GREAT.
when IT CHANGES FORM, IT SHEDS ITS OLD SKIN.
so NOW IT COULD BE ANYBODY.
so...
so WEIRD.
its ROBOT SKIN IS SO LIFELIKE.
okay, LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.
it's NOT A MAN-DROID.
it's A SHAPESHIFTER.
shapeshifter? YEAH.
it's HUMAN, MORE OR LESS.
it HAS HUMAN DRIVE. AND IN THIS CASE, IT'S MONEY.
but IT GENERATES ITS OWN SKIN.
it CAN SHAPE IT TO MATCH SOMEONE ELSE'S FEATURES
???
so I-IT KILLS SOMEONE AND THEN TAKES THEIR PLACE.
kills THEM -- I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS.
what ARE YOU DOING?
nice.
you REMEMBER THE OLD WEREWOLF STORIES?
pretty MUCH CAME FROM THESE GUYS.
silver's THE ONLY THING I'VE SEEN THAT HURTS THEM.
come ON, RONALD.
how WE DOING?
another DAY IN PARADISE.
no ONE'S COME OUT YET?
all RIGHT.
cut THE POWER.
what ARE YOU, NUTS?
that's JUST IT.
I'm NOT NUTS.
I MEAN, I WAS SO SCARED THAT I WAS LOSING MY MARBLES,
but THIS IS REAL.
I MEAN, I-I WAS RIGHT.
except FOR THE MAN-DROID THING. THANK YOU.
Yeah, DON'T MENTION IT.
damn IT.
no, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
what IS IT? THEY CUT THE POWER.
it's PROBABLY THEIR WAY OF SAYING HI.
who? COPS.
the COPS?
you WEREN'T EXACTLY A SMOOTH CRIMINAL ABOUT THIS, RON.
you DIDN'T EVEN SECURE THE SECURITY GUARD.
he PROBABLY CALLED THEM.
well, I DIDN'T THINK TO
hang ON. LET'S JUST TAKE A BREATH FOR A SECOND.
they PROBABLY GOT US SURROUNDED.
they CUT THE POWER TO THE CAMERAS,
so THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING WHO THE SHAPESHIFTER IS.
it's NOT LOOKING GOOD, RON.
did YOU HEAR THAT?
has YOUR BROTHER ALWAYS BEEN SO...WONDERFUL?
I MEAN, STARING DOWN THAT GUN.
and THE WAY HE PLAYED RIGHT INTO THAT PSYCHO'S CRAZY HEAD,
telling HIM WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR?
I MEAN, HE'S LIKE A REAL [CHUCKLES] HERO OR SOMETHING.
Yeah.
Oh, MY G-- YOU SAVED US! YOU SAVED US!
actually I JUST FOUND A FEW MORE.
come ON, EVERYBODY, LET'S GO. LET'S GO.
what ARE YOU DOING?
Sam, LOOK, RONALD AND I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
it SHED ITS SKIN AGAIN.
we DON'T KNOW WHEN. COULD BE IN THE HALLS, THE VAULT.
great.
you KNOW, DEAN, YOU ARE WANTED BY THE POLICE. YEAH.
so EVEN IF WE DO FIND THIS DAMN THING,
how THE HELL ARE WE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE?
one PROBLEM AT A TIME.
I'm GONNA DO A SWEEP OF THE WHOLE PLACE,
see IF I CAN FIND ANY STRAGGLERS.
once WE GET EVERYONE TOGETHER,
we GOT TO PLAY "FIND THE FREAK.
so HERE. I FOUND ANOTHER ONE OF THESE FOR YOU.
now, STAY HERE.
make SURE RONALD DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY. OK
help HIM MANAGE THE -- HELP HIM MANAGE?
are YOU INSANE?
look, I KNOW THIS ISN'T GOING THE WAY WE WANTED. UNDERSTATEMENT.
but IF WE INVITE THE COPS IN RIGHT NOW,
ronald GETS ARRESTED, WE GET ARRESTED,
the SHIFTER GETS AWAY.
probably NEVER FIND IT AGAIN, OKAY
out of the light!
Seriously?
Ron's PLAN WAS A BAD PLAN.
it WAS A BIT OF A CRAZY PLAN,
but RIGHT NOW, CRAZY'S THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN, OKAY?
Hi, RONALD.
I'm GONNA KEEP THIS OPEN,
get YOU FOLKS SOME FRESH AIR IN THERE, ALL RIGHT?
but NO ONE LEAVES THIS VAULT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY ARE YOU HELPING HIM?
you WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME IF I TOLD YOU.
H-hello? I THINK I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
sir, I'M VERY SORRY,
but YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO STAY PUT. All right
what
do YOU MEAN, DEMANDS?
RONALD...HANG UP.
I-I'm NOT A BANK ROBBER.
I GOT TO REALLY GET OUT OF HERE. SIR, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
kind OF A CRIME FIGHTER, I GUESS.
look... NO, I'M ACTING ALONE.
the LESS THE COPS KNOW, THE BETTER.
I THINK THIS DUDE'S HAVING A HEART ATTACK!
great.
could BE OUR GUY, COULD BE A TRICK.
are YOU JUST GONNA LET THE MAN DIE?
no ONE'S DYING IN HERE!
cover the door.

Yeah, BASTARD SHIFTS FAST,
a LOT FASTER THAN THE ONE IN ST. LOUIS.

I THINK MOST OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE VAULT. by now are You search every inch of this place.
I'm GONNA GO ROUND EVERYBODY UP.
crap. WHAT?
the FEDS ARE HERE.
Oh, CRAP.
lieutenant ROBARDS.
Yeah.

I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS WHAT YOU DO.
you CAN GO GET A DOUGHNUT AND BANG YOUR WIFE FOR ALL I CARE.
what I DO NEED IS YOUR S. W.A. T. TEAM LOCKED AND LOADED.
listen, AGENT,
something's NOT RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
it's, UH...
it's NOT GOING DOWN LIKE A USUAL HEIST.
that's BECAUSE IT ISN'T ONE.
you HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH, DO YOU?
there IS A MONSTER IN THAT BANK, ROBARDS.
and I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.
what's YOUR NAME?
why WOULD YOU CARE?
my NAME'S DEAN.
I'm SHERI.
Hi, SHERI.
everything's GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
this WILL ALL BE OVER SOON, OKAY?
this IS SPECIAL AGENT VICTOR HENDRICKSON.
I'm NOT REALLY IN A NEGOTIATING MOOD.
good. Me neither.
it's my job to bring you in
alive's A BONUS, BUT NOT NECESSARY.
that's HARSH FOR A FEDERAL AGENT, DON'T YOU THINK?
well, YOU'RE NOT THE TYPICAL SUSPECT, ARE YOU, DEAN?
I WANT YOU AND SAM OUT HERE UNARMED,
or WE COME IN.
and, YES, I KNOW ABOUT SAM -- BONNIE TO YOUR CLYDE.
Yeah, WELL, THAT PART'S TRUE,
but HOW'D YOU EVEN KNOW WE WERE HERE?
go SCREW YOURSELF. THAT'S HOW I KNEW.
it's become my job to know about you, Dean.
I've been looking for you for weeks now.
I KNOW ABOUT THE MURDER IN ST. LOUIS, i know THE HOUDINI ACT YOU PULLED IN BALTIMORE.
I know about the desecrations and the thefts.
I know about your dad.
you DON'T KNOW CRAP ABOUT MY DAD.
ex-marine, raised his kids on the road,
cheap MOTELS, BACKWOOD CABINS
real PARAMILITARY SURVIVALIST TYPE.
I just can't get a handle on what type of wacko he was
white supremist, Timmy McVeigh, tomato, tomahto.
you GOT NO RIGHT TALKING ABOUT MY DAD LIKE THAT.
he WAS A HERO.
Yeah, right. Sure sounds like it.
you HAVE ONE HOUR TO MAKE A DECISION,
or WE COME THROUGH THOSE DOORS FULL AUTOMATIC.
scramble YOUR MEN. FIVE MINUTES, THEN WE GO IN. WHAT?
hendrickson, THEY'VE LET OUT ONE HOSTAGE SO FAR.
they've HURT NO ONE AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL.
you DON'T KNOW THESE WINCHESTERS.
they're DANGEROUS AND EXPERTLY TRAINED.
we CAN'T RISK THE LIVES OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
trust me DEAN'S A GREATER RISK TO THEM THAN WE ARE.
this IS CRAZY. CRAZY'S IN THERE,
and I JUST HUNG UP ON IT.
damn IT.
we GOT A BIT OF A PROBLEM OUTSIDE.
[ Chuckles ] WE GOT A PROBLEM IN HERE.
we're GONNA LET YOU GO.
what? WHY ME?
as A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH TO THE FEDS. COME ON.
uh...I THINK I'D RATHER STAY HERE WITH THE OTHERS.
I'm AFRAID I'M GONNA HAVE TO INSIST.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LETTING ME GO.
Oh, GOD!
was THAT COMMUNITY THEATER,
or ARE YOU JUST NATURALLY THAT GOOD?
this IS THE LAST TIME YOU BECOME ANYBODY, EVER.
Dean, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
what's THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PLAN?
I MEAN, FAINTING NOW WOULDN'T HELP IT SURVIVE.
No! OHH! OHH!
get HER OUT OF HERE NOW!
don't SHOOT!
don't SHOOT!
I WORK HERE. I WORK HERE.
get me out
Freeze!
gross.
man: MOVE!
clear! MOVE!
clear. MOVE.
clear. GO.
man: MALE, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, GONER.
telling YOU, MAN, I JUST WALKED HER OUT OF THE BANK.
she MUST HAVE A TWIN SISTER OR SOMETHING.
sir, MY TEAM SAID IT'S SECURE. THEY'RE GONE.
you TELL YOUR TEAM TO TEAR IT APART
the DUCTS, THE CEILINGS, EVERYTHING.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY.
why NOT?
Oh, MAMA, I'M IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE
we ARE SO SCREWED.
dad wants us to pick up where he left off saving people, hunting things, the family business.
then
her attacker, a white male...
that's not even a good picture.
shapeshifter?
every culture has a shapeshifter lore.
something that can look like anyone?
freeze.
stay on your knees.
he's being held on suspicion of murder.
murder?
breaking NEWS
we are still here live.
and though a short exchange of weapons fire occurred just a few minutes ago, police and S. W.A. T.Teamsmaintain position as we enter the third hour of this intense stand-off.
authorities estimate as many as 10 hostages are being held inside the bank.
no word as yet on the identity of the suspects.
something's happening.
I think they're opening a door.
Roger, you getting this?
over there.
turn the camera over there.
no, no, no, no, no!
don't even think about it!
get the hell back!
milwaukee, Wisconsin
one Day Ago
so, what's it like -- being an fbi guy?
well...
it's dangerous.
you know.
and the secrets we got to keep -- oh, countless secrets.
but mostly it's -- it's lonely.
I so know what you mean.
Yeah.
Helena was our head buyer.
she -- she was family, you know?
NIGHTSHIFTER
she said it herself every year at the christmas party.
she said we were the only family she had.
so there were never any signs that she'd do something like this.
no...
still can't believe it, even now.
that night, helena came back to the store after closing, cleaned out all the display cases and the safe.
Edgar, our night watchman -- he caught her in the act.
he didn't know what to do.
he'd known her for years.
he called me at home.
and that's when she took his gun?
she shot him in the face.
I heard him die over the phone.
any idea what her motive could have been?
what motive?
it makes no sense.
why steal all those diamonds, all that jewelry and then, what, just dump it somewhere?
just hide it and then go home.
she killed herself?
the cop said she dropped the hair dryer in the bath and fried herself.
they should know, right?
Yeah.
well, thanks, Frannie.
I think that's all I need.
Really?
I mean, 'cause i've got more, you know, if you wanted to interview me...
sometime in private?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
you're a true patriot.
you really are.
why don't you write your number down there for me?
so you never saw the security-camera footage yourself, then.
the police -- they took all the tapes first thing.
of course they did.
this is it.
freaking cops.
they were just doing their job.
no, they're doing our job, only they don't know it, so they suck at it.
talk to me about this bank.
milwaukee National Trust -- it was hit about a month ago.
same M. O.As the jewelry store?
Yep, inside job, longtime employee, the "never in a million years" type.
dude robs the bank, then goes home and supposedly commits suicide.
resnick was the security guard on duty?
Yeah, he was actually beaten unconscious by the teller who heisted the place.
Oh, god.
Yeah.
Mr. Resnick!
FBI, mr. Resnick.
let me see the badge.
I already gave my statement to the police.
listen, Ronald, just some things about your statement we wanted to get some clarification on.
you read it?
sure did.
come to listen to what I got to say?
that's why we're here.
well...
come on in.
see, none of the cops ever called me back, not after I told them what was really going on.
they all thought I was crazy.
first off, Juan Morales never robbed the Milwaukee National Trust.
that I guarantee.
see, me and juan were friends.
he used to come back to the bank on my night shifts, and we'd play cards.
so you let him into the bank that night, after hours.
the thing I let into the bank...
wasn't Juan.
I mean, it had his face, but it wasn't his face.
every detail was perfect, but too perfect, you know, like if a doll maker made it, like I was talking to a big Juan doll.
a Juan doll?
look, this wasn't the only time this happened.
there was this jewelry store, too, and the cops and you guys, you just won't see it.
both crimes were pulled by the same thing.
and what's that, Mr. Resnick?
chinese been working on them for years, and the russians before that part man, part machine, like the terminator, but the kind that can change itself, make itself look like other people.
like the one from "t2.
Exactly!
so not just a robot, more of a -- a man-droid.
a man-droid?
what makes you so sure about this, Ronald?
I made copies of all the security tapes.
I knew once the cops got them, they'd be buried.
here.
now watch.
watch.
watch him.
watch. Watch.
see, look, there it is!
you see?
he's got the laser eyes.
cops said it was some kind of reflected light, some kind of "camera flare.
okay?
ain't no damn camera flare.
they say I'm a post-trauma case.
so what?
bank goes and fires me.
it don't matter.
the man-droid is still out there.
if the law won't hunt this thing down, I'll do it myself.
you see, this thing, i-it kills the real person, makes it look like a suicide, then it sort of like morphs into that person, cases the job for a while till it knows the take is fat, and then it finds its opening.
now, these robberies, they're grouped together, so I figure the man-droid is holed up somewhere in the middle -- underground maybe -- I don't know.
m-maybe that's where it recharges its m-man-droid batteries.
okay.
I want you to listen very carefully.
cause I'm about to tell you the god's honest truth about all of this.
there's no such thing as man-droids.
there's nothing evil or inhuman going on out there.
it's just people.
nothing else.
you understand?
the laser eyes - just a camera flare, Mr. Resnick.
I know you don't want to believe this, but your friend Juan robbed the bank, and that's it.
get out of my house!
now!
sure.
first things first.
man, that has got to be the kicker, straight up.
when you told that poor son of a bitch to -- what did you say, "remand" the tapes that he copied?
classified evidence of an ongoing investigation"?
that's messed up.
what are you, pissed at me?
no, I just think it's a little creepy how good of a fed you are.
we could have thrown the guy a bone.
he did some good legwork here.
Man-droid"?
except for the man-droid part.
I liked him.
he's not that different from you and me.
people think we're crazy.
except he's not a hunter.
he's just a guy who stumbled onto something real.
if he were to go up against this thing, he'd get torn apart.
better to stay in the dark and stay alive.
Yeah, I guess.
shapeshifter.
just like back in st. Louis.
same retinal reaction to video.
eyes flare at the camera.
I hate those freaking things.
you think I don't?
one didn't turn into you and frame you for murder.
well, look, if this shifter's anything like the one we killed in Missouri - then Ronald's right.
all right, they like to lair up underground, preferably the sewer.
all the robberies have been connected so far, right?
through the, uh, sewer main layout.
there's one more bank lined up on that same sewer main.
well, we haven't had any flags go up on our system yet.
no, no, this is a glitch in the overall grid.
just want to make sure the branch monitors are kosher.
better to be safe than sorry, I guess.
that's the plan.
all righty.
you guys need anything else?
Oh, no, no, no.
we'll be in and out.
just a routine check.
Okeydokey.
I like him.
he says "okeydokey.
what if he's the shifter?
well, then we follow him home, put a silver bullet through his chest plate.
okay.
you got any popcorn?
looks like Mr. Okeydokey's...
Okeydokey.
maybe we jumped the gun on this, dean.
we don't even know it's here.
maybe we should just go to the sewers and...
and...
and...
Dean, we're supposed to be looking for eyes.
I'm getting there.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
wait a minute.
Hello, freak.
got him.
what?
Hello, Ronald.
this is not a robbery!
everybody on the floor now!
get down, damn it!
come on!
on the floor, on the floor.
in the middle!
on the floor in the middle.
in middle, on the floor, come on!
hurry up!
come on!
and you said we shouldn't bring guns.
I didn't know this was gonna happen, Dean.
let me do the talking.
I don't think he likes you, agent Johnson.
there's only one way in or out of here, and I chained it up, so nobody's leaving, you understand?
Hey, buddy.
why don't you calm down?
just calm down.
what?
you!
get on the floor now!
okay, we're doing that.
just don't shoot anybody, especially us.
I knew it -- as soon as you two left.
you ain't fbi.
who are you?
who are you working for, huh?
the men in black?
you working for the man-droid?
we're not!
you shut up!
I ain't talking to you!
I don't like you!
fair enough.
get over there.
frisk them down, make sure they got no weapons.
go!
and what have we here?
I'm not just gonna walk in here naked.
give that there.
no, no, no, no.
we know you don't want to hurt anybody.
but that's what's gonna happen if you keep waving that cannon.
why don't you let these people go?
No!
I already told you.
if nobody's gonna stop this thing, then I've got to do it myself!
we believe you!
that's why we're here.
you don't believe me!
nobody believes me!
how could they?
come here.
what?
no.
you're holding the gun, boss.
you're calling the shots.
I just want to tell you something. Come here.
it's the bank manager.
what?
why do you think we got these getups, huh?
we've been monitoring the cameras in the back.
we saw the bank manager.
we saw his eyes.
his laser eyes?
Yes.
no.
No!
we're running out of time.
we got to find him before he changes into someone else.
like I'm gonna listen to you.
you're a damn liar.
I'll shoot you!
get down!
take me.
take me as a hostage.
but we got to act fast because the longer we just sit here, the more time he has to change.
look at me, man.
I believe you.
you're not crazy.
there really is something inside this bank.
all right.
y-you come with me.
but everyone else gets in the vault!
come on, move!
move, move!
then you lock it up.
it's okay, everyone.
just stay cool.
now spin that.
spin that there.
who is that man?
he's my brother.
he is so brave.
check behind the desk.
what the hell is that?
Oh, great.
when it changes form, it sheds its old skin.
so now it could be anybody.
so...
so weird.
its robot skin is so lifelike.
okay, let's get something straight.
it's not a man-droid.
it's a shapeshifter.
shapeshifter?
Yeah.
it's human, more or less.
it has human drive.
and in this case, it's money.
but it generates its own skin.
it can shape it to match someone else's features so i-it kills someone and then takes their place.
kills them -- I don't think it matters.
what are you doing?
nice.
you remember the old werewolf stories?
pretty much came from these guys.
silver's the only thing I've seen that hurts them.
come on, Ronald.
how we doing?
another day in paradise.
no one's come out yet?
this guy locked himself in.
first thing he did.
all right.
cut the power.
what are you, nuts?
that's just it.
I'm not nuts.
I mean, I was so scared that I was losing my marbles, but this is real.
I mean, I-I was right.
except for the man-droid thing.
thank you.
Yeah, don't mention it.
damn it.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
what is it?
they cut the power.
it's probably their way of saying hi.
who?
cops.
the cops?
you weren't exactly a smooth criminal about this, Ron.
you didn't even secure the security guard.
he probably called them.
well, I didn't think to - hang on.
let's just take a breath for a second.
they probably got us surrounded.
they cut the power to the cameras, so there's no way of telling who the shapeshifter is.
it's not looking good, Ron.
did you hear that?
has your brother always been so...
wonderful?
I mean, staring down that gun.
and the way he played right into that psycho's crazy head, telling him what he wanted to hear?
hero or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my g-- you saved us!
you saved us!
actually I just found a few more.
come on, everybody, let's go.
let's go.
what are you doing?
Sam, look, Ronald and I need to talk to you.
it shed its skin again.
we don't know when.
could be in the halls, the vault.
great.
you know, Dean, you are wanted by the police.
Yeah.
so even if we do find this damn thing, how the hell are we gonna get out of here?
one problem at a time.
I'm gonna do a sweep of the whole place, see if I can find any stragglers.
once we get everyone together, we got to play "find the freak."
so here.
I found another one of these for you.
now, stay here.
make sure Ronald doesn't hurt anybody.
help him manage the - help him manage?
are you insane?
look, I know this isn't going the way we wanted.
understatement.
but if we invite the cops in right now, Ronald gets arrested, we get arrested, the shifter gets away.
probably never find it again, okay -- Ron!
out of the light!
Seriously?
Ron's plan was a bad plan.
it was a bit of a crazy plan, but right now, crazy's the only game in town, okay?
Hi, Ronald.
I'm gonna keep this open, get you folks some fresh air in there, all right?
but no one leaves this vault.
I don't understand.
why are you helping him?
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.
H-hello?
I think I got to get out of here.
sir, I'm very sorry, but you're just gonna have to stay put.
what do you mean, demands?
hang up.
I-I'm not a bank robber.
I got to really get out of here.
sir, you can't leave.
kind of a crime fighter, I guess.
look...
no, I'm acting alone.
the less the cops know, the better.
I think this dude's having a heart attack!
great.
could be our guy, could be a trick.
are you just gonna let the man die?
no one's dying in here!
cover the door.
can you tell me how many hostages this guy's taken?
one of the people in here could be having heart trouble.
you need to send in a paramedic.
just stay calm, sir.
just send in a paramedic, okay?!
don't try anything else!
please.
paramedic?
guy don't have time for that, man.
listen, I-I'm sorry, okay?
but nobody's getting out.
he's dying right in front of you.
help.
come on, man.
you got to unlock the front door.
we got to get him out of here.
both of you stay where you are!
you know what, Ronald?
he's right.
we got to get this man outside.
come on.
I got you.
I'll help you.
Oh, I got him.
it's cool.
Thanks.
watch your step.
thank you.
sure.
thank you.
let's go up these steps.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
you have the gun, man.
whatever.
stop!
come back here!
here.
take care of the guard.
I'm going after the shifter.
Sorry,Ron.
you did a real good job tracking this thing.
you really did.
Oh, god, please don't hurt us.
you shouldn't be back here right now!
you're in danger!
now go back to the vault, now.
no, no, no, no!
back up!
don't even think about it!
I said get back now!
one of the hostages seems to have taken over the situation.
excuse me?
go, go, go.
we are so screwed.
yeah?
slipped his skin.
what?
Yeah, bastard shifts fast, a lot faster than the one in St. Louis.
it's like playing a shell game.
it could be anybody again.
I think most of the employees are in the vault.
you search every inch of this place.
I'm gonna go round everybody up.
crap.
what?
the feds are here.
Oh, crap.
lieutenant Robards.
Yeah.
special agent Hendrickson.
let me guess.
you're lead dog now, but you would just love my full cooperation.
I don't give a rat's ass what you do.
you can go get a doughnut and bang your wife for all I care.
what I do need is your S. W.A. T.Team locked and loaded.
listen, agent, something's not right about this.
it's, uh...
it's not going down like a usual heist.
that's because it isn't one.
you have no idea what you're dealing with, do you?
there is a monster in that bank, Robards.
and I thought you were one of the good guys.
what's your name?
why would you care?
my name's Dean.
I'm Sheri.
Hi, Sheri.
everything's gonna be all right.
this will all be over soon, okay?
Yeah.
this is special agent victor Hendrickson.
I'm not really in a negotiating mood.
good. Me neither.
it's my job to bring you in -- alive's a bonus, but not necessary.
that's harsh for a federal agent, don't you think?
well, you're not the typical suspect, are you, Dean?
I want you and Sam out here unarmed, or we come in.
and, yes, I know about sam -- bonnie to your clyde.
Yeah, well, that part's true, but how'd you even know we were here?
go screw yourself.
that's how I knew.
it's become my job to know about you, Dean.
I've been looking for you for weeks now.
I know about the murder in St. Louis, the houdini act you pulled in Baltimore.
I know about the desecrations and the thefts.
I know about your dad.
you don't know crap about my dad.
I just can't get a handle on what type of wacko he was -- white supremist, timmy mcveigh, tomato, tomahto.
you got no right talking about my dad like that.
he was a hero.
Yeah, right.
sure sounds like it.
you have one hour to make a decision, or we come through those doors full automatic.
scramble your men.
five minutes, then we go in.
what?
hendrickson, they've let out one hostage so far.
they've hurt no one as far as we can tell.
you don't know these Winchesters.
they're dangerous and expertly trained.
we can't risk the lives of all those people.
Dean's a greater risk to them than we are.
this is crazy.
crazy's in there, and I just hung up on it.
damn it.
we got a bit of a problem outside.
we got a problem in here.
we're gonna let you go.
what?
why me?
as a show of good faith to the feds. Come on.
I think I'd rather stay here with the others.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.
I thought you were letting me go.
Oh, god!
was that community theater, or are you just naturally that good?
this is the last time you become anybody, ever.
God.
Dean, wait, wait, wait.
what's the advantage of this plan?
I mean, fainting now wouldn't help it survive.
No!
get her out of here now!
don't shoot!
don't shoot!
I work here.
I work here.
gross.
move!
clear!
move!
clear.
move.
clear.
male, African-American, goner.
telling you, man, I just walked her out of the bank.
she must have a twin sister or something.
sir, my team said it's secure.
they're gone.
you tell your team to tear it apart -- the ducts, the ceilings, everything.
I don't think that's necessary.
why not?
we are so screwed.
dad wants us to pick up where he left off saving people, hunting things, the family business.
then
night, love.
Hey, Dean.
daddy!
Hey, buddy.
Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica.
here's to samand his awesome lsat victory.
what would I dowithout you?
crash and burn.
No!
I'm not gonna just ditch the job.
screw the job, man.
I'm sick of the job anyway.
I mean, we don't get paid.
we don't get thanked.
the only thing we get'sbad luck.
now
yeah?
there's a cop car outside.
you think it's for us?
I don't know.
I don't see how.
we ditched the plates, the credit cards.
they're leaving.
false alarm.
see?
nothing to worry about.
Yeah, being fugitives is a freaking dance party.
Hey, man, chicks dig the danger vibe.
so, you got anything yet?
are you kidding me?
how could I?
you got me sifting through50 square miles of real estate.
well, that's whereall the victims disappeared.
Yeah, well, I got diddly-squat.
what about you?
just one thing --I'm pretty sure of it now.
we're hunting a jinn.
a freaking jinni?
Yep.
you think these suckerscan really grant wishes?
I don't know.
I guess they're powerful enough, but not exactly like Barbara Eden in harem pants.
jinn have been feedingoff people for centuries.
they're all over the koran.
my god.
Barbara Eden was hot, wasn't she?
and way hotter than that "bewitched" chick.
are you even listening to me?
Yeah.
so, where do the jinnslair up?
ruins, usually.
bigger the better -- more places to hide.
I saw a place a couple miles back.
I'm gonna check it out.
wait. No, no, no.
come pick me up first.
no, I'm sure it's nothing.
I just want to take a look around.
what IS AND WHAT SHOULD NEVER BE
what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know where I am.
what?
what happened?
well, the jinn -- it attacked me.
the gin?
you're drinking gin?
no, ass-hat, the jinn, the scary creature.
remember?
it put its hand on me, and then I woke up next to some hot chick.
who -- Carmen?
who?
Dean, you're drunk.
you're drunk-dialing me.
I am not drunk.
quit screwing around.
look, it's late.
just get some sleep, and I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
wait, Sam!
criminal LAW & PROCEDURE
what the hell?
honey?
what are you doing up?
Hey.
Carmen, uh, I just, uh - oh, you can't sleep, huh?
Yeah.
well, why don't you come back to bed, and let's see if I can do anything to help.
sure.
Yeah.
in a minute.
you go ahead.
okay.
don't stay up too long.
no.
mom?
what are you doing here?
are you all right?
I don't know.
well, come inside.
Carmen just called and said you justtook off all of a sudden.
right.
let me ask you a question.
when I was a kid, what did you always tell me when you put me to bed?
I don't understand -just answer the question.
I told you angels were watching over you.
I don't believe it.
honey, you're scaring me.
now, just tell me what's going on.
you don't think that wishes can -- can really -- what?
forget it.
forget it.
I'm just --I'm happy to see you.
that's all.
you're beautiful.
what?
Hey, when I was young, was there ever a fire here?
no, never.
I thought there was.
I guess I was wrong.
dad's on a softball team.
dad's softball team --that's -- that's funny to me.
he loved that stupid team.
dad's dead?
and the thing that killed him was a...
a stroke.
he died in his sleep.
you know that.
that's great.
excuse me?
that's great that he went peacefully.
I mean, it --it sure beats the alternative.
you've been drinking.
no, I haven't, mom.
I'm gonna call Carmen and have her come pick you up, okay?
wait, no, no.
don't do that.
don't do that.
I want to stay here.
Why?
because I miss the place.
it's okay.
you got to bed, okay?
are you sure you're all right?
I think so.
okay.
get some rest.
I love you.
me too.
Hey, it's me.
I can't getto the phone right now.
well, I don't think I've seen you in my class before.
are you kidding me?
I love your lectures.
you --you make learning fun.
so, what can I do for you?
what can you tell me about jinns?
a lot of muslims believe the jinn are very real.
they're mentioned in the Koran - yeah, yeah, yeah, get to the wish part.
what about it?
do you think they can really do it?
uh, no.
no, I don't think they can really do it.
you understand these are mythic creatures.
Yeah, no, I know.
I know.
but I mean in the stories -- say you had a wish, but you never even said it out loud, like that a loved one never died or that something awful never happened.
supposedly, yes.
I mean, they have godlike power.
they can alter realityhowever they want -- past, present, future.
why would the jinn do it?
what, self-defense?
or maybe it's not really evil.
son?
you been drinking?
everybody keeps asking me that, but, uh, no.
who'd have thought, baby?
we're civilians.
this isthe best sandwich ever!
thank you.
I tried to get ahold of Sam earlier.
where is he?
uh, he'll be here soon.
good.
I'm dying to see him.
sweetie, I-I --don't get me wrong.
I am thrilled you are hanging out here all of a sudden, but, uh, shouldn't you be at work?
work?
at the garage?
right.
the garage.
that's where I work. Yeah.
no, I-I-I've got the day off.
good thing.
that lawn looks likeit could use some mowing.
you want to mow the lawn?
are you kidding me?
I'd love to mow the lawn.
knock yourself out.
you'd think you've never mowed a lawn in your life.
I don't believe it.
good to see you, too, Dean.
I can't breathe, okay?
Hey, look at you.
you're with Jessica.
I don't believe it.
Yeah.
Where'd you guys come from?
we just flew in from California.
California.
stanford, huh?
law school, I bet.
I see you started off mom's birthday with a bang, as usual.
wait.
mom's birthday --that's today?
Yeah, yeah, Dean, that's today.
that's why we're here.
don't tell me you forgot.
well...
that looks awesome.
all right.
to mom.
happy birthday.
happy birthday.
thank you.
I was really worried about you last night.
Oh, I'm good.
I'm really good.
okay.
what do you say later we get you a cheeseburger?
Oh, god, yes.
how did I end up with such a cool chick?
I just got low standards.
all right.
Jess and I actually have another surprise for mom's birthday.
uh, you want to tell them?
they're your family.
all right.
what?
tell me what?
Oh, my god!
that's so wonderful. - Thank you.
Congratulations.
I just wish your dad were here.
Yeah, me, too.
congratulations, Sammy.
Thanks.
I'm really glad you're happy.
so, Dean, what was all that back at the restaurant?
Oh, I thought I saw someone.
I'm sure it's nothing.
well, I had a lovely birthday.
thank you.
good night.
night.
Yeah, well, I'm beat.
ready to turn in?
sure.
night, guys.
wait a second.
come on. It's not even 9: 00 yet.
let's go have a drink or something.
Yeah. Yeah, maybe another time.
come on, man.
look at us, huh?
we both have beautiful womenon our arms.
you're engaged.
let's go celebrate.
sure.
Thanks.
come on, Carmen.
come here.
what?
okay.
what's gotten into you?
what do you mean?
I mean this whole warm, fuzzy, ecstasy-trip thing.
I'm just happy for you, Sammy.
Yeah, right. That's another thing.
since when do you call me "Sammy"?
we don't talk outside of holidays.
we don't?
well, we should.
I mean, you're my brother.
you're my "brother"?
Yeah.
who?
uh, my prom date --on prom night.
Yeah, that does kind of sound like me.
well, hey, man, I'm sorry about all that.
no, look, it's all right, man.
I just -- you know, I'm not asking you to change.
I just, uh --I don't know.
I guess we just don't really have anything in common, you know?
wait.
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
what?
hunting.
hunting?
I've never been huntingin my life, Dean.
Yeah, well, then we should go sometime.
I think you'd be great at it.
get some rest.
my favorite.
I guess you know me pretty well.
afraid so.
you all right?
Sammy and I --we don't get along.
well, you don't really spend a lot of time together.
I just think you don't know each other all that well.
for the record, he doesn't know what he's missing.
I can fix things with Sam.
I can make it up to him...
to everyone.
okay.
what's gotten into you lately?
this isn't gonna make a lick of sense to you.
but I kind of feel likeI've been given a second chance.
and I don't want to waste it.
you're right.
it doesn't make any sense.
you know, I get it.
get what?
why you're the one.
well?
whatever's gotten into you, I like it.
Oh, come on!
don't do this to me now.
I've got to get ready for work.
you got to work now?
I told you.
I've got the night shift on Thursday.
you work night sat the, uh...
hospital.
I'm dating a nurse.
that is so respectable.
the olive oil must have a purpose here.
Yeah.
yeah?
I'll take the olive oil, and we'll put just a touch of olive oil in, okay?
that's all.
can't make any mistakes with this machine.
now, for liquid, I could use water, but I'm gonna use a little spinach jui-- 1%.
no.
why I said the child nee...
and today marks the anniversary of the crash of united britannia flight 424.
Indianapolis residents held a candlelight vigil in memory of the 108 passengers and crew who lost their lives.
Oh, no. I stopped that crash.
flight 424 CRASHES, 108 DEAD
nine Children Comatos...
parents mutilated in.
girl drowns in hotel pool.
all of them...
everyone that you saved, everyone sammy and I saved...
they're all dead.
and there's this woman that's haunting me.
I don't know why.
I don't know what the connectionis -- not yet, anyway.
it's like my old life is coming after me or something, like it doesn't want me to be happy.
of course, I know what you'd say.
well, not the you that played softball, but you'd say,"go hunt the jinn."
it put you here.
it can put you back.
your happiness or all those people's lives -- no contest.
right?
but why?
why is it my job to save these people?
why do I have to be some kind of hero?
what about us, huh?
what, mom's not supposed to live her life?
Sammy's not supposed to get married?
why do we have to sacrifice everything, dad?
it's...
Yeah.
that was so easy I'm embarrassed for you.
what the hell are you doing here?
I was looking for a beer.
in the china cabinet?
that's mom's silver.
what, you broke into the houseto steal mom's silver?
it's not what it looks like, okay?
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, really?
Why?
what's so damn important that you got to steal from your own mother?
you want the truth?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
I owe somebody money.
who?
a bookie.
I lost big on a game.
I got to bring him the cash tonight.
I can't believe we're even related.
Sam, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that we don't get along.
and I wish to hell I could stay and fix it.
but I got to do this.
people's lives depend on it.
what are you talking about, Dean?
nothing.
forget it. Just, uh...
Hey, tell mom I love her.
I'll see you, Sammy.
get out of the car.
I'm going with you.
you're just gonna slow me down.
tough.
this is dangerous, and you could get hurt.
and so could you.
look, whatever stupid thing you're about to do, you're not doing it alone, and that's that.
I don't understand.
why are you doing this?
because you're still my brother.
bitch.
W-what are you calling me a bitch for?
you're supposed to say "jerk."
what?
never mind.
what's in the bag?
nothing.
nothing?
Yeah, nothing.
fine.
you don't want to do that.
Oh, really?
what the hell is this?
blood.
Yeah, I can see that it's blood.
what the hell is it doing in here?
you don't really want to know.
no, I do really want to know.
I really, really do.
well, you're gonna find out sooner or later.
I needed a silver knife dipped in lamb's blood.
you needed a silver knife dipped in lamb's blood.
Why?
because there's this creature, a jinn, and I have to hunt it.
okay, um, stop the car.
I know how it sounds.
great.
just stop the car.
it's the truth, Sam.
there are things out therein the dark.
there are bad things.
there are nightmare things.
and people have to be saved, and if we don't save them, then nobody will.
I want to help you.
I really, really do.
but you're having some kind of psychotic breakdown, so I just - I wish.
what the hell was that, Dean?
that was my phone.
I'm not going to a rubber room, Sammy, and we got work to do.
I was just trying to help you out, Dean.
I don't want youto get yourself hurt.
you protect me?
Yeah!
Oh, that's hilarious.
why don't you just sit tight and try not to get us both killed?
where are we?
well, we're not in Kansas anymore.
Illinois.
and you think something's in there?
I know it is.
see?
there's nothing here, Dean.
look, Carmen's got to be worried sick about you, Dean.
come on.
let's just go.
what the hell is that?
stick behind meand keep your mouth shut.
what the hell?
it's her.
Dean, what's going on?
Where's my dad?
no.
no.
Where's my dad?
sleep.
sleep.
this is real?
you're not crazy?
she didn't know where she was.
she thought she was with her father.
what if that's what the jinn does?
it doesn't grant you a wish.
it just makes you think it has.
look, man, that thing could come back, all right?
Dean, please.
what if I'm like her?
what if I'm tied up in here someplace?
what if all this is in my head?
I mean, it could, you know maybe it gives us some kind of supernatural acid and then just feeds on us slow.
no, Dean, that doesn't make sense, okay?
what if that's why she keeps appearing to me?
she's not a spirit.
it's like more and more I'm catching flashes of reality -- you know, like I'm in here somewhere, I'm catatonic, and I'm taking all this stuffin, but I can't snap out of it.
okay. Look. Yeah, you're right.
I was wrong.
you're not crazy, but we need to get out of here fast.
I don't think you're real.
did you feel that?
you feel this?
I'm real.
this is not an acid trip.
I'm real, and that thing is gonna come down here and kill us for real.
now, please.
there's one way to be sure.
what are you doing?
it's an old wives' tale.
if you're about to die in a dream, you'll wake up.
no, no, no.
that's crazy, all right?
maybe.
you're gonna kill yours - or I'm gonna wake up.
one or the other.
look, this isn't a dream, all right?
I'm here with you now, and you are aboutto kill yourself, Dean.
no, I'm pretty sure...
like 90% sure, but I'm sure enough.
wait!
why'd you have to keep digging?
why couldn't you have left well enough alone?
you were happy.
put the knife down, honey.
you're not real.
none of it is.
it doesn't matter.
it's still better than anything you had.
what?
it's everything you want.
we're a family again.
let's go home.
I'll die.
the jinn will drain the life out of me in a couple of days.
but in here, with us, it'll feel like years, like a lifetime.
I promise.
no more pain, no more fear.
just love and comfortand safety.
stay with us.
get some rest.
you don't have to worry about Sam anymore.
you get to watch him live a full life.
we can have a future together, have our own family.
I love you, Dean.
please.
why is it our job to save everyone?
haven't we done enough?
I'm begging you.
give me the knife.
I'm sorry.
Oh, god.
come on.
Hey, wake up.
wake up, damn it.
auntie Em.
there's no place like home.
thank god.
I thought I lost you for a second.
you almost did.
Oh, god.
let's get you down.
she's still alive.
I got you.
I got you.
we're gonna get you out of here, okay?
I got you.
I got you.
okay.
uh, well, thank you so much for the update.
okay, bye.
that was the hospital.
the girl's been stabilized.
good chance she's gonna pull through.
that's good.
Yeah.
how about you?
you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
you should have seen it, Sam.
our lives.
you were such a wussy.
so, we didn't get along, then, huh?
no.
Yeah.
I thought it was supposed to be this perfect fantasy.
it wasn't.
it was just a wish.
I wished for mom to live.
mom never died, we never went hunting, and you and me just never, uh -- you know.
Yeah.
well, I'm glad we do.
and I'm glad you dug yourself out, Dean.
most people wouldn't have had the strength.
they would've stayed.
Yeah, lucky me.
I got to tell you, though, man -- you had Jess.
mom was gonna have grandkids.
Yeah, but, Dean, it wasn't real.
I know.
but I wanted to stay.
I wanted to stay so bad.
I mean, ever since dad...
all I can think about is how much this job's cost us.
we've lost so much.
and we've sacrificed so much.
but people are alive because of you.
it's worth it, Dean.
it is.
it's not fair, and, you know, it hurts like hell, but it's worth it.
dean: dad wants us to pick up where he left off
saving people, hunting things, the family business.
night, love.
Hey, dean.
daddy!
Hey, buddy.
Mary!
Sam: dean, this is my girlfriend, jessica.
here's to sam and his awesome lsat victory.
what would i do without you?
crash and burn.
No!
I'm not gonna just ditch the job.
screw the job, man. I'm sick of the job anyway.
I mean, we don't get paid. We don't get thanked.
the only thing we get's bad luck.
yeah?
there's a cop car outside.
you think it's for us? I don't know.
I don't see how. We ditched the plates, the credit cards.

Yeah. In a minute.
you go ahead.
okay. Don't stay up too long.
no.
mom?
what are you doing here?
are you all right?
I don't know.
well, come inside.
Carmen just called
and said you just took off all of a sudden.

let me ask you a question.
when i was a kid,

Yeah, yeah, yeah, get to the wish part.
what about it?
do you think they can really do it?
um...uh, no.
no, i don't think they can really do it.
you understand these are mythic creatures.
Yeah, no, i know. I know.
but i mean in the stories
say you had a wish,
but you never even said it out loud,
like that a loved one never died
or that something awful never happened.
supposedly, yes.
I mean, they have godlike power.
they can alter reality however they want
past, present, future.
why would the jinn do it?
what, self-Defense?
or maybe it's not really evil.

everybody keeps asking me that, but, uh, no.
