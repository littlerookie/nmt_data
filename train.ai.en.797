put on a ski mask and take on a dirty cop, and see how far that gets you.
what's the latest?
nothing yet.
what are you say... What, we're still at zero?
score one? What do you mean "nothing"?
I've been doing plenty.
but if you're asking if I have anything conclusive at this moment, the answer's no.
well, what have you been doing, Antonio?
I would love to know.
because this whole thing is unraveling for Casey.
Voight's put the word out on the street- we know that.
so we're looking for someone to wear a wire.
yesterday, we busted a kid for possession.
he's in a gang with ties to Voight.
I offered him a deal if he'd flip.
had him this close, but he wouldn't go.
so offer him something else.
it don't work like that.
as long as Casey doesn't take the bait, this thing's gonna play out the way we want.
so sit tight.
have a little faith in your brother.
why don't we just leave?
we both have vacation time built up.
we could even go longer. I'm sure they would give you a leave of absence.
when we get back Voight will have forgotten all about it?
we go where he can't find us, and we give the cops enough time to bust him.
come on, baby.
let's get out of here. Let's regroup.
just...
Yeah.
we have a warrant to search your home. - What?
we got a tip says you're in possession of cocaine.
either we can search your house, or you can produce the cocaine, and your cooperation will be taken into consideration.
it's Voight.
detective Voight... He put you up to this?
no. I don't know any Voight.
I just know we're coming in.
the warrant allows us to search the entire house, and you're allowed, by law, to stay in the house if you remain cooperative.
I'm a firefighter, station 51.
my fiancee is a doctor at Lakeshore.
do we really look like cocaine users to you?
if you could please both go wait in the front room.
now.
he's a detective in vice.
he'll tell you we're being harassed by this cop.
I have Antonio's number on my cell.
will you please just take a second and talk to him?
please.
Yeah, this is officer Madden.
we have a search warrant for...
it's all right, baby.
it's gonna be all right.
he says they're clean.
if I ever have to come back here again, no favor is gonna get you out of it.
it was under the table.
Oh, my god.
that's 15 years right there.
call Antonio back. - Flush it down the toilet.
baby... - Flush it down the toilet!
you just committed a couple felonies.
I'm ready to commit a few more.
because I'm telling you, it ends now, or you're the one that's gonna disappear.
I can respect that.
go ahead.
use it.
you retract that statement against my son...
or you pull that trigger.
because that's the only thing that's gonna stop me.
she had a sternal fracture, a large hemopericardium and mediastinal hemorrhage, all of which indicate that a periocardiocentesis is obviously
you're already talking too much.
the question was what did you see?
I saw a young girl in danger of dying, - and so I felt it was necessary - Feelings-no feelings.
thoughts.
convictions. - Okay. Fine.
I thought that... I knew that I had to do something immediately, and that something was...
just answer the question posed to you.
don't elaborate.
and smile.
go ahead.
what? - Smile. Let me see it.
mouch, come on. - Let me see it.
I can smile. - Come on.
contrite, not smug.
welcoming and innocent.
we're gonna work on that.
I'm hitting the rack, boys.
Yeah.
cause you're getting buried.
no, all good.
how do you know?
that's an " i'm with the program" kind of walk.
you were right.
Voight had me spun out.
I let it get to me.
won't let it again.
I need to work.
I'm willing to trust the system.
so I'd like to resume my duties, chief.
welcome back.
Yeah, there he is, huh?
all right, all right, all right, all right.
don't turn it into a Greek wedding.
come on, everybody, normal day.
everybody go about your business. Let's go.

chief. Dumpster fire. Nobody called it in.
flames went up the service elevator shaft, spread out on the fifth.
find me the super. I need occupancy numbers.
what about the main elevator? - He's just cleared it.
he's coming out with a few more tenants.
five more ambos, and chief helicopter's on the way.
we're gonna need 'em. Anticipate at least five reds in there.
we can't wait for helicopter with this many non-responsives.
we've gotta set up triage.
do it.
you're in charge here.
all right.
this is ambulance 61.
give me an EMS plan one.
chief. - She'll be fine.
I know. But where are all the people?
no one's coming out of the other side of the building.
squad three, check out the west side fire stairwell.
already on three.
must be a blockage.
capp and Hadley have the east.
I'm sending you Casey, Cruz, and Mills.

you all right? - Yeah.
I'm clearing a path.

there's people in the hall.
if you're mobile, keep walking.
slow and steady.
there's paramedics waiting.
I'll take this.
I'm going up further. - Okay.

all right, we got another red.
Shay, this one's yours.
Yeah, got it.
all right.
there's three more up on six. - Any burns?

all right.
capp, Hadley, meet us in the west stairwell.
copy.
you're going in there?
you need to get back behind the lines.
mouch, get this kid safe.
come here, pal.
you've gotta get that tube down her throat.
I can't. There's too much swelling.
then cric her.
I've never done it.
Dawson, you've gotta cric this woman, or she's a goner.
all right, hand me a scalpel.
who's the lead here?
you're looking at her.
you may as well keep looking over my shoulder, 'cause this is definitely gonna be an infraction.
hand me a size five tube.
bag.
all right, bag her.
lungs are good.

Casey, go back!
get down.
Casey plus two on eight.
east corner unit. Move that ladder now!
Mayday!
Mayday!
not sure how long I can hold it back.
get that ladder as close as you can.
hug the building if you have to, capp. I'll climb.
I need a clear path to the east corner.
what's your name?
okay, Curtis, you're gonna put that on her.
make sure it's tight around her face.
good.
now I want you to open the window.
we ain't gonna make it.
open it!
we're gonna have three coming down from eight.
I need two ambulance crews ready at the base of truck 81.

swing!
come on. I got you.
Thanks, chief. - Hadley.
chief. - Good job.
chief.
that was pretty close, huh?
plenty of time.
Really?
listen, if you see Hallie at the hospital, don't tell her about this.
okay?
given her enough to worry about lately.
Yeah.
chief says you should hit it so you can make it to your hearing.
who's gonna cover?
EMT certified.
good luck.
good luck.
Yeah. Okay.
take care of your mom, okay?
are you Casey?
Yeah.
you're the one got the problem with detective Voight, right?
Yeah, that's right.
man, I can help you out.
when? Where? - Now.
he already put in a call to Voight for a meet.
I'm gonna prep him while my techs wire him up.
then we're good to go.
now, we got one shot at this.
there's about a dozen things that can flush it down the drain, so don't say anything to anyone.
don't even mention his name out loud, 'cause Voight's got ears all over this city.
I'll let you know once it goes down.
I want to be there.
fine. Let's go.
the charges you face, miss Dawson, are both very serious and very troubling.
we disagree whole heartedly, sir.
miss Dawson chose to perform a procedure that was clearly outside of her jurisdiction, and that could have mortally injured the patient in her care.
to refresh my memory, could you please read the full charges out loud?
I believe we have that right.
Gabriela Dawson is charged with willful neglect of protocol, and of practicing a medical procedure that she was neither trained nor certificated...
no, I have been trained in that procedure, and I knew exactly what I was doing, and how much time we didn't have.
I'm also currently taking pre-med classes, - where I've re-studied every procedure - I'm sorry.
and I am studying for my pilot's license, miss Dawson, but that does not mean I can land a 747 in a blizzard.
but you'd sure as hell try if you were about to crash.
you are lucky that girl is alive, or there would be criminal charges pending against you.
if saving a kid's life is now a criminal offense, then maybe it's your damn protocol that's out of whack, and the wrong people are making the rules.
ten-minute break?
five.
you didn't even remember the charges.
I was stalling for time.
what? Why?
we're ready.
I'm sorry. Are we too late?
please enter into the record witnesses number two, three, and four.
there's a reason sky divers pack two parachutes.
here we go.
what's happening, young blood?
what's up with you, V?
Deshawn said there's money to be made on the firefighter.
I want his deal.
he tell you who it is?
Yeah, but I wasn't really paying attention till he said something about the money.
his name is casey.
how much?
depends on services rendered.
well, Deshawn said his boys got 5 for jumping him.
I figure I could do a lot worse for a grand.
brother, you stop him for good, I'll give you 2.
we got it?
move it in.
they ain't here for me, bro.
let's see your hands! - Don't move!
come on, get 'em up!
Yeah, look at me.
I got him, I got him.
enjoy it while you can.
this is entrapment.
you're cooked, youngblood.
get in.
got it.
that's great.
that's great to hear.
Yeah, okay. See you at the Shindig. Bye.
that was Mouch.
Dawson got a three-shift suspension, but we'll be throwing her a suspension party tomorrow tonight.
so how much money does she lose, like, 2 grand?
a little bit more.
but if we all chip in 20 bucks, we might be able to put a dent in it.
or...
it's got that signature wildstyle of his, and it has this lovely unfinished quality to it.
he almost fell to his death while finishing the "O."
unbelievable.
can you hold on one second?
Thanks, pal.
Hello? Serge, how are you?
listen, i'm gonna have to give you a call back.
I'm on the other line with a different buyer.
but if he starts dragging his feet, it's all yours, buddy.
all right. Thanks, pal.
Hello?
all right, 2,000.
1, 500?
you gonna slap me in the face like that?
you're gonna slap me in the face with 1, 000? You...
I'll take it.
there we go.
what's this?
just drink it.
congrats to Dawson.
could have been worse.
thank you. Cheers. - Cheers.
shiver me timbers.
thank you so much for your help, Mouch.
you really pulled it out.
you weren't...
worried about me, were you?
no. Never.
thomas Kincade? Okay, I get that.
you know, you look at his paintings- God rest his soul
but yeah, that's art.
that's worth money.
but this?
the scourge of a civilized society, man.
chain o' lakes, guys.
chain o' lakes. That's where you'll find me.
Hello?
okay, great.
we'll bring it right out.
it's the buyer.
he's here. Grab an end.
I'm not touching it.
chain o' lakes.
guys, I'll help you. - Thanks, Dawson.
Thanks, D.
I'm not gonna ask. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.
I'd have thrown the book at you.
I heard about Voight.
he got it worse than me, huh?
rear view mirror, baby.
rear view mirror.
well, then, you've come to the right place.
you can see my friend Peter Mills at the bar over there.
Yeah, you did an okay job.
Thanks. What a ball-breaker, huh?
you can handle it.
any chance Voight beats this?
no shot.
speaking of shots, where are they?
over there.
Where's Hallie?
meeting me here.
I'm really happy for you.
you too.
come here.
I am glad it is over.
it is.
thanks for everything, chief.
are you...Drunk...Chief?
Yeah, a little.
I'll be joining you momentarily.
good. Glad to hear it.
just ask him. - You.
he'll think i'm sniffing around.
how do you think i'm gonna come across?
here he comes. - He thinks I'm a curmudgeon.
would you just do it for me?
lieutenant. - What's up?
great party. Thank you for hosting it.
Yeah, no sweat.
and it's a really cool space.
and what kind of food do you guys serve?
well, its a diner, so diner food.
is your sister Elise here tonight?
no, she's out with some friends.
all right.
Thanks.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Hallie's here.
it's over.
we're all right now.
we're all right.
get Crowd Control before they kill that man.
all right, everybody back now! - We're not going anywhere.
back up, or I'll knock you on your ass.
do you talk to your sister? - It's still hard for her.
look, I need to turn the page on this too.
maybe you should've thought of that before you killed dad.
nothing excuses what she did. - I'm not asking you to forget.
would you think about coming out to visit me?
Yes, I will come visit you when I can.
Flaco's dead.
help me! Please!
we take this to the grave...just me and you.
um...I need help.
I'm so damn proud of you, Kelly.
listen, uh, the Christmas party...
there's some stuff I'm dealing with...stuff I got to figure out.
I hope it works out, whatever it is.
good morning. - Morning.
what time is it? - 7: 00.
Ooh, what do we got going here?
uh, just a little veggie scramble.
there's the culprit.
did we kill this whole thing last night? - Yeah. Yeah, we did.
Wine...I don't know why I do it.
every time.
every... every time what?
I just get... drunk.
you don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna tell anybody at work.
um, it's not like I'm gonna be embarrassed... - Hey, don't explain.
we're on the same page.
this is our thing... nobody else's.
enjoy your eggs, and I'll see you at work, okay? - Okay.
Hey, Peter.
Hey. Yeah, I know, Chief.
it's just that the classified ad, it runs today, and...
I just need to make back what I put into her.
and I need my driveway. - Okay, yeah.
I'll finish up on the curb.
it's so damn cold. It just needs a little extra.
could be worse.
how?
just a little fender bender, that's all.
no big deal.
how's the noodle? - Hard as ever.
that's... - That's what he said.
just a little something from us.
Oh, my... you guys.
added protection.
Oh, I love it.
welcome back. - Thanks, Chief. Thanks, guys.
I'm gonna tell him...
today. - Great.
Hey. - Morning.
truck 81, squad 3, ambulance 61, police assist, 4000 South Kildare and West 44th.
abandoned truck. And there's something funky inside.
it's padlocked shut.
capp, grab the k-12.- Got it.

San Angelo.
wherever the hell that is.
everyone quiet.

I didn't hear that before.
holy hell.
we have multiple victims...

damn it. There are children.
Hey, Dawson!
I know this is scary, but if you come with me, we can help you.

Undocumented?
Yeah, found her in the back of an abandoned smuggler's truck.

No! No, no, no, no!

Hey, no one's heard from Cruz, huh?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll show it to you another time.
Hey. - Hey.
how'd it go? - With...
Boden. - Yeah, n... no...
cause here's the deal. - Yeah.
on the last call, I ripped off that locklike it was bolted on with paper clips.
no pain, nothin'.
I moved back in because you said you talked to Boden.
what's going on?
have you heard from that Rick character?
no Who's he?
this lawyer who's working with mom.
he asked me about mom's trialand specifically about the house key.
well, what? What about it?
I don't know where he was going with itbecause I told him that was...
your business and to talk to you about it.
I'm just giving you the heads-up that this guymight be trying to contact you, - and it might be about the key. - Okay.
I appreciate it.
I gotta get going.
Hey, Christie.
the C-5 vertebra.
fracture. - That's what the doctor said.
how long ago was this exam?
you don't want to know.
okay.
this doctor may be a little eagerto get you under the knife.
yeah? - Yeah.'Cause they're not gonna know anythinguntil they do an MRI.
we are not gonna go worst-case right now.
gonna let the CFD medicalgive a fully informed diagnosis.
chief, I don't ask for a lot of favors.
but since I feel fine 90% of the time, I'd like to stay on squadwhile this whole thing runs its course.
in the meantime, I'll set up an appointment for after shift.
I'll get in there the next opening they got.
what's going on?
off duty till the results come in.
when's the appointment? - Later today.
and then...how long did the first doctorsay that you'd be out?
six months.
you know...I was a gymnast growing up.
knew you must have got your flexibility from somewhere.
and after I placed in Nationals, I got invited to the oOlympic trials. Weekend before...
I took my bike...
down to the lake, and this cab door opens up, and there you go.
but...I was up and walking two months later.
were you ever a gymnast again?
No...robably not the best pep talkI could have given.
okay.
let me ask you this.
does, um, being on squadinvolve having to stick a full twisting double layout?
Yes.
well, you're gonna be fine.
when are you leaving for Madrid?
Tuesday.
I can push it. - No, no, no. No, do your thing.
tell me you're gonna come visit me. - Yes.
once I get my back squared away.
I'm calling it right now.
two months. Max.
all right. I'll take that.
thought you were out for the shift.
well, yeah, I resolved things a little bit early.
okay if I jump in?
suit up.
what happened to your hand? - Nothing.
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
and...and I'm so sorry for your loss.
well, please let me know what happens, and, uh, I'll keep a good thought for Rosa.
Si. Okay. Adios.
Rosa's Uncle...
he hasn't been able to get to the hospital to see her.
she getting deported? - I don't know yet.
I can't imagine they would, though, with everything she's been through.
where are her parents?
they were in the back of that trailer. - Oh, man.
well...
let me know if I can help in any way.
can I talk to you for a second? - Delivery for a Gabriela Dawson?

okay, stay right there. Stay calm.
hey... he's gone, man.
sir, just stay where you are.
we'll take care of you. - No, I don't need that thing. Just let me out of here.
get him out. - All right, let's go.
nice and easy.
how old are you, sir? - 85, and don't blame this on my age.
the tower fed me the wrong coordinates.
it's not my fault I landed short of the runway. - Short of the runway?
you're 5 miles from the closest airport. - Well, take it up with the FAA.
I was just following the...Oh, no. No, no.
I thought I missed that car. - Don't look that way. Come with me.
Hey, we gotta pull her out headfirst. You have clearance on her feet?
Nah, I'm just out of reach. I gotta hit it from another angle.
just put this around your head to protect you.
Mills! With me!
ma'am?
this is Casey. We're gonna need a medic. - 61, on our way.
Mills! Let's go! - Yeah.
weak pulse. - A lot of blood outside.
we got to move him.
ready? Nice and smooth. - One, two, three.
okay, roll him over.
in my bag. Abdominal trauma pads. - How many?
all of 'em. - Okay.
the blass broke through his abdominal wall.
we need to pack him right herebefore he bleeds out all over the place.
press down, not too hard. There might still be glass.
hold the dressing right here. Keep the wound covered.
that's good. A hand here. Pressure.
let's get him on the board. - All right.
ready.
Casey, as we lift him, keep your hand here, or else this is gonna be a recovery.
you got it? - Copy.
all right. Let's get him up. - Lift.
all right, go...push, come on.
go! Come on! Come on.
for the love of Pete, my six-year-old'sgot more upper body strength than you two.
herrmann, is the parking brake on?
okay, guys. Come on, just push, then. Go. - Got it?
Yeah. - You sure?
I think I got it. - Okay.
go.
sorry it didn't work out, man. - Yeah, thanks, buddy.
listen, I want to thank you for helping meget my head straight over that Flaco thing.
are you back to work?
I am. - Good. Welcome back.
but you and me, we never talk about that again.
not another word. Clear? - Yeah.
sorry, Lieutenant.
Hey, you know what's wild?
I just now realizedthat your last name and
Tom Cruise's last nameare pronounced exactly the same.
people ever misspell it like hisin the mail or whatever?
not really.
are you okay, buddy?
you've really been off your game lately.
do you need to talk to someone?
I'm your friend.
you can tell me anything.
Hey. Yo, Alfredo sauce. Made it from scratch.
I thought we had an agreement about the other night.
and now, suddenly, flowers?
delivered to me in front of everyone? That is exactly what I was trying to avoid.
I don't know, maybe this is my fault. Maybe I'm missing something here.
but what exactly happened to "this is our thing, nobody else's"? - I didn't send them.
Hey. Found this out front.
delivery guy must have dropped it. The flowers are actually for the both of you.
some lady wanted to thank you for saving her,"even though you had to drug my dog.
Yeah, great. Thanks.
you're welcome.
boo. - Royce.
what are you doing here?
Ah, I just cleared some stuff from my schedule.
Mm. Hi. - Hi.
didn't realize you had a guest.
Dr. Kessman, this is my...girlfriend, Renee.
it's good that you could make it.
so today's CT scan showsthat the hairline fracture on your C-5
here extends further than we thought.
so surgery?
Yeah, as soon as possible.
and the recovery time, that's the same six months?
unfortunately not.
um, forget whatever you were told before. It's a year at best.
look, some guys who come in here on the job, they're rolled out in the chair they're gonna live inthe rest of their lives. You're lucky.
everything I see tells me you should make a full recovery.
a year?
a year if you hope to return to squad.
I'll be honest, I've never seen anyone return to full dutyafter this surgery.
much sooner, though, four or five months, you can come back in an administrative capacity.
so you may want to set your sights on that. That's much more realistic.
I'll give you two a minute.
Uh-oh, looks like someone'sstill dropping their laundry off at mom's house.
not that she hasn't offered, though.
Yeah, um...so that was kind of weird, what happened earlier.
which part? Oh, you mean the whole thing.
look, I was out of line. I should have known...
Yeah, well, at least now you know I mean what I say. - I know. And I should have known that.
and I still want to apologize. - Hey, Chief.
briefing room, everybody.
as you can imagine, Kelly is still processing all of this.
I'd give him a little time before you call him.
and there is no reason that, before or after the surgery,
Kelly shouldn't be in this house, feeling at home and around his family.
so will you all encourage him to do that?
Look...there is no denyingwe are a good man down.
we do not have the luxury to act like it.
so the upside of this...
it is a stark reminderinjuries do not get swept under the rug on this job.
nor do they get self-diagnosedor self-medicated,'cause what is that?
pride, friendship, stubbornness, fear...
whatever the reason, it isn't good enough to hide an injury.
Kelly dodged a bullet on this one.
so did the people he helped rescue this past month.
cause it could have gone real bad, for him and for them, real quick.
Hey, Ernesto.
I'm sorry to bother you like this. - No, that's no problem at all.
I'm so sorry about what you and Rosa are going through.
they're deporting her.
I don't even know what to say. W...did they give you a reason?
they found out she was 16.
a year younger, she would have been eligiblefor refugee status.
what's this? - To help her get home.
immigration will only take her to the border.
can you please get it to her?
ambulance 61, truck 81. Pulmonary distress.
2500 West Ogden and Roosevelt.
it usually doesn't take this long to go back to normal.
sir, when you're in this kind of pain, you can't just ignore it and hope it goes away.
Yeah, I know, but I hate going to see the doctor. My health care plan's a joke.
Yeah, we work for the city too, coach. You're preaching to the choir.
Travis? - Heart rate's at 185. He's in V-tach.
bp's 70 over 50. We don't have time for the drive. We gotta do this here.
all right, Travis, change of plans. We're gonna need you to lie down, all right?
all right, I'm gonna start an iv.
so I just need you to stay as still as possible, all right?
Why? What's happening?
well, we gotta get you back into rhythm.
we're just gonna apply some electricity to your heart.
whoa, whoa, whoa. You're gonna shock me?
I don't know...what, is that gonna hurt?
a lot less than the full cardiac arrestyou're about to have.
you just have to trust us, Travis.
okay, pushing 5 mils of Diazepam.
shocking at 100.
stand back. Clear.
Oh, God, it's done. It's done.
almost. No, no, no. - It's done.
Travis, almost. Almost. We gotta do it again, all right?
you have a stubborn heart.
come on, there's gotta be something else you can do.
this is it, Travis. We have to.
you heard coach... he said he didn't want it!
shocking at 200.
stand back.
clear!
please no more.
Please...no more.
all right, one more time. - Come on, I can hold on. Just get me to the hospital.
Travis, I'm sorry. You just gotta trust us, okay?
okay, shocking at 300.
stand back. Clear!
Otis, I need chest compressions!
coach! Is he all right?
no. - You're killing him!
Hey, step back, man. Hey, you hear me? Move back! - Mills! Back off.
kid just wants to know what's going on.
stop compressions.
damn it! Still in V-tach.
all right, pushing 150 mils of amiodarone.
stand back, shocking at 360. Clear.
come on. We got him.
okay, we need a lift, guys.
Hi. - Oh, hey. Hi.
you must be, uh... - Yeah, I'm Renee.
Renee, of course. - Yeah. Nice to meet you.
you are Shay.
I have heard amazing things about you. - Yeah, you too.
uh, is he here? - Yeah, he is just up taking a shower right now.
how's he doing?
trying to figure it out.
Yeah. I was worried. I've been trying to get a hold of him.
he's definitely not up for taking phone calls.
okay, yeah, I'll just have himdownload me on it later.
okay. Um, you know what?
there's some extra coffee in there, if you'd like. - Thanks.
so when do you leave for Madrid?
in a couple days. - Oh, that sucks.
he's been telling me you guys have really hit it off.
who knows what the future holds?
well, you shouldn't worry. I mean...
if you haven't figured it out already, he's basically indestructible, and...
I'll be here to take care of him, so...
don't you worry about a thing.
it was nice to meet you. - You too.
idiot.
Hey, I'm Gabriela Dawson. I'm one of the paramedics who responded.
okay.
uh, do you think I could talk to her for a second, just to see how she's doing?
no sweat. - Thank you.
Hola, Rosa. - Gabriela.
a b
my greatest achievement.
you look so handsome. I'm so proud of you.
it's good seeing you, mom.
Rick Savrinn. I've heard so many good things about you, Matt.
um...so what's going on? How are things? - You tell me.
looks like there's something you guys want to talk about.
I just want to tell you how grateful I amthat you're gonna speak up at the hearing.
I'm sure you understand. - Yeah, I do.
so I was talking to Rick, and he brought up a really good point.
I know it's a difficult subject, but if we could just talk it out, and then we can decidewhether or not to bring it up in the hearing.
the house key. - That's right.
see, I've talked to an attorney. And he said that...
you're not an attorney? - No.
I'm just a friend and advisor to your mom.
I met Rick through the pen pal program, but he has consulted an attorney.
all right, so what about it?
imagine I'm the parole board.
just tell me what happened.
I left the key to my dad's houseout on the counter.
my mom took it.
that's how she got into his house at 3: 00 A. M.
And...then she shot and killed him.
and how did that make you feel?
Well...guilty.
every time I replay that day, I wonder if my dad would still be aliveif I hadn't been so careless with that key.
I'll ask you w what you were asked 15 years ago.
is there a part of you that left that key out intentionallybecause you were angry at your dad for the way he was treating your mom, and you wanted him to pay for it?
is this really what you want to hear, mom? - No, this is not about blame.
we're not retrying the case. This is about sympathy for you.
for your mom. - That's enough, Rick.
this could go so... - That's enough!
sweetheart. Just forget I said anything. You don't have to say a word.
it's gonna be enough for me just to look overand see your face...
the one person who's never turned his back on mein this world.
Yeah, I gotta go. - I love you so much.
Yeah, fine.
Hey, Chief. I just wanted to let you knowI'm selling that limo off to a scrapyard.
it'll be off the curb by end of shift.
how much?
200 clams.
I got another option for you.
we're due to run a vehicle drill.
I got a budget of $800. It's yours...
if you can get it towed to the academy.
Ah, Chief, man, all right! All right.
Hey, Mills, um...my office, real quick.
now or...you guys need a minute? - Now.
doing a good job, Mills. - Thank you, Chief.
but you're still in your probationary period, right? - Yeah.
still on the outside looking in.
any mistakes, you can get dinged anytime. You know the deal. - Yeah. Yeah, I do.
can I give you a word of advice?
keep your personal life on hold.
devote everything to your training.
when you get on the other side, then you can worry about complications, you know...
Yeah. You're right.
Yeah, I am a novice in this business.
but every time that I walk through that door, I am all ears.
whatever your orders, I'm on it. I mean, to the word. - Good.
but...
when it comes to my personal life, my personal relationships,
I'm not a novice.
with all due respect, Chief, that's my business.
then let me be a little more direct.
sit down.
Yes, sir.
young man like yourself, a few months in.
be real easy for you to get a reputationas some kid more concerned with chasing assthan he is with mastering his job.
Kelly Severide...I'm pretty sure he's worked his wayhalfway through Chicago right now.
but those first two years as a candidate, he did not look sidewaysat a woman that he was working with.
he put in the hours, mastered his craft.
so what I'm saying is, Peter Mills, maybe you should get there first,'cause that way, people in positions of power, people like me, can reach down and pick you upto the next level.
Yeah, Chief, there...there has to be... - Dismissed.
morning.
good morning.
can I... Thanks. - Yeah.
uh, hey, I might just take you up on your offerto help me out with that Rosa situation.
sure. Of course.
thank you.
actually been meaning to talk to you.
Oh, okay.
um...I've been dealing with something, and the whole situation's a bit...
well, embarrassing's not the right word.
but I realize I've been a bit distant recentlybecause of what's going on.
and so what's going on ismy mom is up for parole, and I'm trying to help her get out.
I just didn't want you to thinkI was blowing you off or anything.
I... I thought that you were dealing with Hallieand all that.
no, that's been over for a while.
so, uh...how can I help with Rosa?
well, I've... I've been written up twice, so
I've got a bit of a credibility issuewith the Chief, and, uh...
this is really big, what I'm about to ask you.
so only if you really want to do it.
Misspoke? - Yeah, Chief.
at the scene, Rosa told me she was turning 16, and when I was at the hospital, I mistakenly told the E. R.doctorthat she was 16, and somehow, that became gospel.
I don't know a lot of Spanish, Chief, but I heard Rosa say it too.
this is significant how?
since Rosa's really 15, she qualifies for temporary refugee status but only if there are other special circumstances.
if Rosa agrees to give informationagainst those who smuggled her, that would be enough to give her a temporary "U" visaas the smuggling case is being investigated.
and since her closest relative, her Uncle Ernesto, lives here in Chicago, she could live with him while she applies for the I-130 for permanent residence.
thank you.
you got it.
Hey. Kelly.
tonight? I'll be there.
Mills! Unless you want to get knee-capped, I'd get away from that bumper.
that thing goes up, it's gonna blow like a cannon. It's gonna take you right with it.
Otis, get a hose in that cab. Keep that fire from making it to the back.
hood's open!
need co2 on that block. We're losing time.
fire's out. Come on, let's move!
And...time.

first time I have sex in six months, - Cindy's pregnant again. - What's that, like, four?
God.
carry on.
Hey.
hell of a day, huh? - Yeah.
tell you what.
after surgery, forget rehab.
park it down at the house.
I'll put you through truck drills.
we'll make a firefighter out of you yet.
Yeah, about that. Listen...
just to let you know first.
the girl I'm dating, Renee, she's transferring to Madrid for her job and found a great rehab unit.
well, great. How long you staying?
I'm moving there.
you're messing with me. - I'm not.
bought my plane ticket an hour ago.
well...
I guess...cheers to that then.
Cheers.
want some breakfast?
no, I'm good.
I talked to your aunt. She said it's fine.
we got a room for you and everything.
when's this happening? - She'll be here tomorrow night.
it's not quick enough. She's taking the day off from work and driving here from Pittsburgh.
that's as soon as she can do it.
something going on I should know about?
Trayzell said I got to do a hit.
when? - I don't know.
he said to just be ready. I gotta reprove myself to him.
okay.
you're staying with me now. I'll take you to my place.
I don't need a place to crash. I need to get out.
you said you'd do that for me. And I will.
I'm trusting you, man.
Diego going back to school today? Let's give him till Monday.
it's not like he hasn't been through a lot. It's one of my CIs.
Jasmine? - Yeah.
she calls a lot. She's a good CI.
I want to meet her. - Now, there's a fun time.
my wife and my hooker CI? I just want to, you know, have her over for dinner.
babe, I could be fired for having her here.
we'll meet her on neutral ground.
we'll take her out for dinner. Nah.
is there a reason you don't... you don't want me to meet her, Antonio?
baby, there's no need for you to feel threatened by the skank, junkie, hooker CI who I deal with because it's part of my job.
then we will meet her for dinner.
hey listen, I got this thing on Friday night, but I can blow it off if you think...
what kind of thing? - It's my engagement party.
Where's my invite? - Ha.
Seriously? You know, that's all I need.
Hey, sweetie, this is my partner, the married one who lives in his garage.
don't worry, that's not gonna happen to us.
no offense, though, I don't want you anywhere near her. Does that mean you set a date?
Ah, today's the 21st, so 6 months today.
Oh, man, today's the 21st. Yeah, it usually follows the 20th.
what's up? - Nothing.
all right, there are two unrelated wire investigations.
surveillance followed three of area central's top-ranking gang targets to this house on Carpenter.
narcotics hasn't gotten anywhere with it, so command staff wants Intelligence on it.
roll out in five.
Hey, hey, what are ya doing?
I need a desk. - Not that one.
that was Willhite's desk.
I'll let everybody know when someone can use it.
Yeah.
we got the main eye.
we're set up to the north. 10-4.
we got the south and a partial of the alley.
if anyone goes mobile from the house, we're in position for a take-away.
o and Ruzek, move closer. See if there's any movement in the house.
10-4.
hold up. We got company.
who's this joker?
gun!
stay down!
clear! - Police!
clear! - Hoodie's dead.
this one's alive. Charlie 50-21, emergency.
what? - He's gonna bleed out.
we gotta put pressure on the wound. One shot fired by the police.
offender down. Plainclothes officers on scene. Alright. Alright.
in here!
cop killers.
Hey, look at this.
what do you got?
insulin.
somebody was a diabetic?
or not.
is there a black market for this stuff? None that I've heard of.
but you know what?
it's a good place to hide a bullet, though.
nice work.
Hey, Sarge.
you got a Calhoun county sheriff? No, that's a beauty.
Yeah, my cousin's dating a guy that works dispatch in Corpus Christi.
well, you tell your cousin a "thank you" from me.
what about the one I gave you? Walla Walla?
Yeah, I traded that one.
nice work. - Thank you.
my friends are coming into town. I want to give them the grand tour.
I'd rather not have Platt deep-sixing it.
did you see a counselor? - Counselor?
I don't need to see a counselor.
well, I don't need to wear pants, but, you know, here I am.
it's compulsory. Yeah, and I'll pick up something for dinner.
all right. - No, end of discussion.
this is Edward Jelko, the deceased street-level dealer.
this is Peter Thomas Banfill, the offender, currently baking in a coma over at County.
Jelko probably thought like we did that Banfill was sitting on something big, went over there to rip him off.
these are M995s, teflon-tipped, kevlar-penetrating rounds.
ballistics has 'em linked to several recent homicides. And we found 100 of these at the scene.
it's for type R insulin, which is a Canadian designation.
and with any luck, our little surprise visit got the gun runners scrambling, which means they're gonna make mistakes, okay?
eyes open.
Erin, come here a second, will you?
do you want the door closed? Assume I always want it closed.
okay, tough guy.
Justin's getting early release. He's moved up to Friday night.
that's great. Well, he's asking if you can be there.
it's no big deal if you can't.
are you crazy? Of course it's a big deal.
he's getting out.
Yeah.
what?
why do you look like somebody just pissed in your coffee?
gettin' out is always harder than gettin' in.
come on.
Justin's gonna need you around, okay?
the tough love thing, it... it didn't work.
do me a favor.
tell Antonio I'll be back in an hour, okay?
Yeah.
you hear anyone talking about cop-killer bullets out on the street?
no. I can ask around.
would you?
that's it?
how about next time, you text me so I don't have to drive a half hour in traffic?
I was wondering if you want to grab dinner.
you and me? Like a date?
yes or no?
when? Tomorrow night, 7: 00.
I already have a dinner. Cancel it.
unless you want to pay me 400 bucks for lost wages,
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
I found the source of the Insulin.
a company near Toronto named "Markham Medical Supply,
their sales rep makes a run here every other Thursday.
he left at 5: 00 this morning. I'm guessing they have tracking numbers on all their products?
Yep. All right, get those tracking numbers, locate him on GP, and... you already did that.
Yep, Atwater and Burgess are en route tracking the signal. Nice.
do me one favor: Do not give me one of those open-fingered explosion hands that people do.
I hate that. If it's your thing, I'd rather high five.
never again.
Hey, Halstead. Any word on Banfill?
he's still in the ICU. You seen the counselor yet?
Yeah, this afternoon. You know, I'm gonna send out a memo so people can stop asking me.
who do you think you're talking to? You got 10 minutes on this job.
it's... a lot of people have been asking me.
say that next time.
no, you're right. You're right.
I got it. Okay.
all right.
detective Voight.
actually, it's Sergeant now. How do you know me?
Casper. - Oh, yeah, Casper.
he's with the Vice Lords. I heard he's in Marion now.
Yeah, didn't work out too well for him.
I mean, it worked out good for you, though.
look, I know who you are and what you're about.
but you are legit now, right?
I need to talk to you alone.
no, you can speak to me right here.
I want him out.
get-out-of-jail-free card for you in return.
so you want Little D, huh?
you into that?
did I come here disrespecting you?
you know I put a lot of money and time into that boy, right?
see, you may want to give me some paper as opposed to some damn business card.
give me 10 grand, and he's yours.
I'll be in touch.
Yeah, right on Morgan.
Hey, do you think you could hook me up with a car? Mm, I don't know.
there's such thing as lead time, that kind of stuff. I know, it's just kind of a big deal.
it's my flight attendant friends, and I was kind of... Hold up, flight attendants?
you never said nothing about flight attendants. Yeah, three girls I flew with when I was...
well, yeah. Well... psh, I'll get you a car.
should of said that upfront. I'll get you a good car.
this is it.
nobody's delivering medical supplies here.
police! Show me your hands!
this is definitely our sales rep. George Wilenko, 41.
he's been with Markham Medical for 17 years.
no record, fully bonded, has border clearance.
this guy's not your typical smuggler. You notice the cup?
lipstick on the lid.
these are what we're looking for.
C7s, a variant used by the Canadian army.
an armory up there was robbed. 3, 000 rounds of ammo and 50 C7s were stolen.
bigger market for sprayers down here. Victim's wife drove down with him.
Halstead and Lindsay are bringing her in. Good.
you're working that Kelly Severide thing over at Firehouse 51?
Yeah, during the blackout, he got mixed up with that knucklehead Vince Keeler?
Yeah, I know Keeler. He's bad news.
which is exactly what I told Severide and why he needs to stay away from that guy.
Severide's sister Katie was reported missing.
how long? - 16 hours.
she's an adult, really nothing we can do until it's 24, but she is a fireman's sister, basically one of our own, so area central's already got a task force on it.
they said they'd call if they need us.
so meantime, we got our own case to work, okay?
Absolutely.
don't arrest us, Officer.
Oh, my... look who made it to Chicago.
Hi. How are you?
Oh, my God, come on, I'll give you the grand tour.
Yeah, let's go. - Kevin Atwater.
Yes, Hailey, Genevieve, Vera, this is my partner.
I look out for her. I'll bet you do.
spicy.
this is it. - It's awesome.
Hey, Sarge.
what's going on here? Ladies, this is our desk Sergeant, Trudy Platt.
this is her district, and she runs it firmly but fairly.
nothing gets by this woman. So if you guys will follow me.
including you. - No, I, look, I just wanted...
drunk and disorderly at Duffy's Tavern.
that's half the clientele at Duffy's. Well, that's good then, you've narrowed down the list of suspects.
Hey, Tommy, cover me.
good afternoon, ladies. What's up?
you want a tour of District 21? I'd be delighted.
has anybody here heard of Al Capone? He was here?
everybody was here. Let's go.
to be perfectly honest, doc, I'm pretty thrilled with the way that it went down.
you give me a him-or-me choice,
I'm gonna make it the same way every time.
people can feel conflicted about something, even if it is justified.
well, I'm not, doc. I'm not.
what? - Conflicted.
you are not married. Are you in a relationship?
are you asking me out, doc? I have a girlfriend.
she's my fiance as of about a month ago.
how does she feel about what you've been through?
I haven't told her.
most of us at one time or another meet challenges that we can't explain.
just...
are you trying to make me feel bad? Is that what you want to hear?
not at all. Okay, are we done?
I would like for you to take the rest of the shift off.
my mother always called it "Murder City.
but the first time we visited, I fell in love with Chicago.
the lake, the river walk.
george and I went to the top of the Willis tower.
God, I just... I can't believe it.
why would someone kill my husband?
we think that he was smuggling guns into the country.
George? He wasn't killed over Insulin.
and on his last trip here, we think his vehicle was filled with these.
I'm hallucinating. This isn't happening.
five people have already been killed by them.
look, you don't get it. George would never do that ever.
how often did you make the trip down with him?
every couple of months. We always stay at the Sofitel.
I shop. That's why he dropped me off.
they don't have Bloomingdale's in Canada.
what do you say, Maurice?
it's all good.
you hear anything about lone guns coming in to town?
what kind? - Sprayers. A lot of 'em.
heard about something from Canada. That doesn't make a lot of sense.
it's starting to. You hear anything, hit me up.
another thing.
I've been getting some static from this cat named Trayzell with the GDs.
you know anybody got his ear? Trayzell's?
no. He's stone crazy.
he don't listen to nobody.
and I need to bring you in on something.
state's Attorney's getting someone to flip on me, buildin' a case or somethin'.
I haven't got wind of anything. Now you have.
five stacks.
more when you get me that name.
I got you.
go for Voight. We got somethin'.
these are our bullets. Can you believe the velocity of these things?
forensics traced one round that went through the TV, through the wall, ended up halfway through the engine block of an ice cream truck parked across the street.
seven homicides and counting. Our widow's lying.
her cell phone provider said she was never at Bloomingdale's.
she spent the afternoon up in Edgewater.
we're gonna get real honest real quick.
do you recognize these men?
Oh, God. - Yeah, neither can we.
his face was shot off by the bullets you and your husband brought into Chicago.
why are you doing this? - You lied to us.
you weren't browsing Bloomingdale's. You were in Edgewater.
you and your husband had a nice run, right? You start off with something simple like x or kush, and you got greedy, and you upgraded to gun-running.
you got George killed, which makes you an accessory to his murder.
so we're gonna try this again, only this time the truth.
I was visiting a friend.
an ex-boyfriend. - If you're gonna lie, put some effort into it for me.
call him. He'll tell you.
name, number.
I want you to take me through your entire day, every stop you made, every person you talked to, everything you did.
I already told you. Tell me again.
we were on the road by 4: 30. Didn't stop till we crossed the border just past Ann Arbor.
got some coffee, some gas. Used the washroom.
george got a phone call from our nephew...
who's the nephew? - He lives here.
he likes to meet up with George...
Oh, God, Mikey doesn't know.
does Mikey have a last name?
michael Ganz, lives in East Garfield Park, has a record: robbery, possession. Runs with a small crew.
Claire's ex - Boyfriend checks out right down to the 500 bucks.
got a ping on Ganz's phone, pulled all the numbers he's called in the last 24 hours.
employee of the week, Jin, right here.
all the calls were to the same numbers, a cell phone registered to a Lucky M Pawn
I know that ding-dong.
we'll go talk to him. Come on.
Hey, O. - Yeah.
I'm gonna need you later off the books. Yeah.
let's go. - Come on.
Mr. Milner. Alvin.
Hey. So how's the usury business?
I don't run that kind of operation. Good for you.
so, um, guns coming in from Canada.
I just introduce people. Wha... wha... what does that mean?
nothin'. I'm just telling you, you know?
no, I don't know. I don't know anything about Canadian guns.
then why did you say, "I just introduce people"?
it just seems odd.
you make me nervous.
Why? Huh?
Why? - Yeah.
how about the last time you were in my shop, huh?
you took a nine iron to my jewelry case.
that was here? - Alvin.
I don't know anything, okay?
let me, uh... let me see that.
right there, right there. Right... right over there, yeah.
he set up a buy with Ganz tomorrow, 2: 00 P. M.
Hey, Danny.
Hi, Jay.
pastrami for Danny, and smoked turkey for you.
Oh, gosh.
we're going to be eating this till Thanksgiving. Hey, let me get you a sandwich.
no, I can't. I gotta run.
Oh, well, let me at least give you a slice of cake to go.
this is always a tough day for him.
he won't eat it.
I just end up throwing it out.
small slice.
can I see your driver's license?
Halstead. Intelligence. - This is harassment.
just eating some birthday cake. Today would have been a birthday.
arrest him.
get him out of here! - Sorry, pal.
all you dirty bastards stick together. You always have.
seven years ago today, Lonnie. Today.
get outta here! - Seven years!
he would have been 15!
I'm gonna call my lawyer. I'm getting a restraining order.
I'm gonna give you a reason to need one one day. Oh, God.
you and your sick-ass son.
okay. I got nothin' on the guns.
sorry. That's it?
next time, text me.
and also, my date canceled for tomorrow, so you're on.
what do you want me to wear?
dress conservative. Repeat that back to me.
I will dress conservative.
Ciao Amore at 7: 00.
okay. See you then.
Severide. - Hey.
I didn't know where else to go, and, um, and I don't...
no one's heard anything.
I don't know what to do. Hey, we're gonna find her, okay?
Yeah. - I promise.
we've got really good guys on this.
and I know it's scary, and I know your sister's alone, but we're gonna find her.
come on.
Hey, Trayzell.
bro.
I came to you man to man, tried to do business.
you want to negotiate?
maybe Casper didn't tell you before he got sent up, but I don't like negotiating.
maybe he didn't tell you, I make offers once.
you can uncuff him.
look at me.
D'Anthony is out as of this minute.
you look sideways at him, you're goin' on a ride you're never coming back from.
you understand?
all right.
let's get outta here.
let's keep our heads down.
assume Mike is packing heavy stuff.
Hey. - Look at you all fresh like a daisy.
Yeah, what a wank. Hey, listen, any word on the guy I dropped?
Nah, still in the ICU. - All right.
Hey, what'd your counselor say? Oh, that I'm coping well with the trauma, but I think she was talking about working with you. You're in the van.
wait, why can't I do the buy with you? 'Cause Antonio called shotgun before you did.
you gotta be... Al, how long is this gonna go on for? I'm fine.
Christmas. - What?
Christmas is the takedown word.
reservation's all set at Carmine's for when he's out.
they gave us the back room, so who do you want me to invite?
Oh, let's keep it small, just the three of us.
yeah? - I don't think he should be around his old friends just yet.
okay.
that's our boy, Ganz.
milner says you're huntin' for hardware? If they're the quality Milner said they are, we'll take most of 'em off your hands.
I'll take you to it.
get in. - Aw, come on.
only one of you with the money.
forget it. Fine with me.
Hey, hey... whoa, whoa, whoa, wait... wait a sec.
wait... wait... wait a sec.

we're goin' mobile.
what's your name? - What do you care?
we're heading north.
heard you had a... a crew.
well, you'll meet 'em soon enough. What's wrong?
we've lost his audio and his tracking beacon.
we're headin' into McCook. Why do you keep calling out directions?
I'm in a car with some guy I never met.
you know, he's taking me to an undisclosed location.
you know, I'm just thinkin' out loud.
pull over.
give me your phone.
I'm not wired.
do it.
open the door, and you die.
this is so, so dumb.
okay.
I want you to look at the mile marker and make a note.
Why's that? - Once the deal is done, you're gonna bring me back here so I can look for that phone.
how closely can you track him, Jin? Six meters.
yards, whatever.
let's see the money.
25 large.
I left the other half with my associate.
you really think I'll come alone with all the cash?
well, let's see the damn guns.

get down.
Burgess, Atwater, you got two white male offenders moving southwest of the building towards you.
you all right? Yeah.

well, that got crazy fast. Didn't I tell you he was a cupcake?
I gotta take care of something. Don't say that.
tell Justin something popped up.
are you kidding me?
just do this for me, okay?
thank you. - No.
you're telling me that whatever you have going on is more important than seeing your only son walk out of the gates?
Yes. Tell Justin I love him and I'll see him tomorrow.
that's your third.
still one short of getting me through this evening.
what the hell? My wife wanted to meet you.
so why didn't you say something? You would never have come.
you're right.
Hi. It's... it's nice to finally meet you.
look Mrs. Dawson, I get it, okay?
nobody wants their husband to hang out with someone like... like me, but you know what?
let me tell you something, okay?
I got no designs on him, and he's got none on me, so if we're done with this little face-to-face...
wait. Just wait.
I wanted to give you this.
it's, uh, it's St. Nicholas, the patron Saint of children.
you helped save our son's life.
I just wanted to thank you personally.
why didn't you tell me this is why you wanted to see her?
cause you wouldn't have brought her.
nobody's wife has ever thanked me before.
come on.
sit down.
good evening, ladies.
you take one photo and post this on Facebook, I will destroy you.
copy that. - Good.

all right, well, I appreciate the phone call.
Hey, baby.
who's on the phone? Uh, that was, um...
all right, look, listen, I wanted to bring you in on somethin', okay?
okay. - Okay.
um, they didn't pull me out of the academy to do paperwork.
they pulled me out to work in Intelligence.
I'm sorry.
it's a good thing, isn't it?
Yeah, like you wouldn't believe. It's awesome.
there's guys with 10 years on the job that are still trying to give their left nut to be in this unit.
well, what was the phone call?
I was in a shooting yesterday. What?
it's all right. - Oh my God, what happened?
well, the guy that I shot who was trying to kill me, he died, and that was the hospital.
are you messin' with me right now?
no. I'm not messing with you.
I just wanted to tell you in case I'm a little distracted tonight, which I won't be because I'm totally fine, okay?
Hey, look at me.

Maurice gives you 5, 000 a week. Where is it? He didn't have it.

I will bury you.
you're gonna be all right, partner.
I just... I don't know.
how do you know I won't screw this up and she makes me come back?

you're the cashier.
no. I'm the guy hiding in the frozen food section dialing 911, I swear.
I'm going to assign you an anger ally...
...to help calm you down when you're losing it.
Chuck.
not Chuck. Give me Bobby Knight, or the porno girls.
heard we're partnering up, huh?
Yes. - Here's my number.
great. "You're going to die, bitch."
Oops, that's a letter I'm writing to Geraldo Rivera.
I see. - My bad. Here.
that's the number. Good. Thank you.
Dave and Chuck...
...working together as a team.
it's a win-win situation. -Yeah, feels it.
Dave's particulars.
I'll see you soon.
the Yanks are great this season.
Dave thinks they could beat Seattle's win record.
remember at Brown when we saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?
Oh, man. He was on fire that year.
we could've been too.
Andrew, don't start or I can't hang out with you anymore.
sorry, it's just hard. I'll never meet anyone as good as you.
you will. She'll be a very lucky lady.
thanks for being my best friend.
Linda.
Hey, Dave. -Andrew.
good to see you guys hugging.
how was the doctor?
psychotic.
well, did you get any good promotion news from Mr. Head?
I wasn't able to talk to him about that yet, but I will.
not that crowded here. You'd think it would be packed.
I rented the place. I figured it'd be more fun if it was just Brown alumni.
Where'd you go to college again?
Trenton Community College.
you had a hard day. Let me buy you a milk shake.
later, Andrew.
once you cast your line in, so during retrieval...
...it'll help you to create a realistic and a erratic...
Hey, Dave.
Hey. Andrew, what's up? - Not much.
you always try to simulate live bait.
okay, they got fishing while you go to the bathroom. That's nice.
Yep. Bass fishing. Hey, he caught one.
be aware of your presentation...
...and make sure that, as you work it along...
Oh, yeah.
Congratulations.
now that is a big one, folks.
always a blast being with your friends.
it was a great night.
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.
Yeah, you like those foot-Iong hot dogs, don't you?
so I saw your boy Andrew at the urinal.
saw his thing. - You were looking?
Yeah, unfortunately.
so, now, did this guy grow up near a nuclear power plant or something?
what are you talking about?
never really seen nothing like that before. Didn't it used to scare you?
I never saw it.
you never saw it?
no, I told you, I never slept with him. Why, is it huge?
no. No. No. No.
it's actually quite petite.
I felt bad for him.
it looked like it belonged on a baby and it had a funny color.
I bet he got a lot of snickers in the locker room.
like, "What the hell's that thing?"
when you're in a locker room, you must feel good about yourself.
I do. If there are 20 naked guys in there, I'm usually in the top 18.
which isn't bad. - You're doing really good.
Thanks.
who's that? - I don't know. Let me get rid of them.
Hello? -Dave, it's me, Chuck.
who's Chuck? - Your anger ally.
I'm in a mood, Dave. A bad mood.
a very bad mood.
I was fired from my ice-cream truck job today. No more Fudgeicles.
what's an anger ally? - Who's that?
she making fun of me?
no. That's my girlfriend.
you tell her to put a sock in it because I need to talk to you right now!
we're a little busy right now.
you're busy? We're all busy, okay?
you come down here before a black wolf swallows my brain!
after I got kicked out of the Army, I went through a real bad time:
hookers, booze, shooting holes in the ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.
finally, my parents said I had to move out.
I'm guessing that's when you decided to shack up with your aunt.
don't get cute, wiseass!
but, yes.
what's with the watch, huh? Am I boring you?
we ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago and I kind of gotta get back.
miss? Excuse me, miss?
is this Slow And Stupid Waitress Day?
I'm sorry. I be right with you.
damn, man, reminds me of these chicks back in the war.
would give you the old licky-licky, then fry your banana.
settle.
I have seen some shit, man. I kid you not, I have seen some shit.
wake up to the sound of kids screaming.
explosions everywhere.
never know when your number's up.
vietnam, huh?
grenada, man. - Grenada?
wasn't that like 12 hours long?
did you see that?
see what? - That guy. He just gave me a look.
he didn't give you a look.
and I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter some kind of anti-Semitic remark.
are you Jewish?
I could be. But, no. Half Irish, half Italian, half Mexican.
let's go give those guys some tsuris.
well, the guy on the left is blind, Chuck.
I hear you.
he's yours.
no. That's not what I was saying.
Hey. - What the hell?
got something against guys with hair?
what's going on?
don't! Stop it! Stop!
stop! Goosfraba!
you piece of shit!
stop it! Stop it!
welcome back, Mr. Buznik.
I see you've managed to brutalize a cocktail waitress this time.
I guess beating up stewardesses can get old after a while.
flight attendant, Your Honor.
I didn't hit her on purpose, Your Honor.
I was being attacked by someone...
...and while I was trying to take away his...
his...
trying to take away my cane, Your Honor.
you cracked a waitress in the face...
...while attempting to steal a blind man's cane?
your Honor, we're not even sure how blind this man really is.
okay. My bad. Moving on.
happy now, ass-wipe?
Mr. Buznik, I don't know why you hate women.
maybe you don't know either...
...but I'll let you think about it while you spend one year in a state prison.
isn't that a bit harsh, Your Honor? - No!
okay.
may I approach, Your Honor? - By all means, Dr. Rydell.
thank you.
it's been a while. - Yes, it has.
you look marvelous, Brenda. - Thank you.
and how are the boys? - Fantastic.
James made the basketball team, Raheem landed the lead in Fiddler on the Roof.
raheem will make a breathtaking Tevye, I'm sure.
so do you have a take on this Buznik guy?
is this good or bad?
well, it's bad that he's talking to her...
...but it's good that...
no, it's bad. It's all bad.
you think you can help him? - I think so, Your Honor.
if I can't, I'll tear him apart with my bare hands.
Mr. Buznik...
...because of the enormous respect I have for Dr. Rydell...
...I'm placing you in his intensive anger management program for 30 days.
but if you fail to strictly adhere to the rules of his program...
...you will spend the next year in state prison.
buddy? - Good evening. Ready to get it on?
get what on? What are you doing here?
well, well, well.
the lair of the rage rhino.
I smell the effluvium of pain and frustration.
where should we put my stuff? - What stuff?
we've got 30 days to control your anger.
my approach dictates intense observation.
what better vantage point than bunkmates?
put that there, Dan, thank you very much.
no. No. I'm sorry. Guys, I don't think you should be moving in with me.
sit down, Dave.
let's be perfectly clear about this.
you've been deemed a threat to society.
I believe that radical, round-the-clock therapy is the only way to effect a meaningful and positive change in your behavior.
now we can do it here or Rikers Island.
anything else, Dr. B? - No thanks, Dan.
we'll install the wiretaps tomorrow.
wiretaps?
is this your CD collection? - Yes.
Oh, my.
what are you doing?
I don't want you listening to any angry music.
the Carpenters are angry? I mean...
don't be naive, Dave.
"close to You." "We've Only Just Begun."
songs of madness and obsession.
who's going to pay for that?
retard your anger level a few notches and listen to me. Can you do that?
Yeah. It's retarded. I'm retarded.
good.
now then, we need to go over some ground rules.
my girlfriend got me that.
you're to refrain from violent acts including verbal assault...
...and vulgar hand gestures.
you may not use rage-enhancing substances...
...such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, crack cocaine...
...Slippy-Flippies, Jelly Stingers, Trick Sticks...
...Bing Bangs or Flying Willards.
how about Fiddle Faddles? - Under my supervision.
also, if you are unable to stop masturbating...
...please do so without the use of any pornographic images...
...depicting "quote-unquote "angry sex.
that having been said, I'm a pretty good guy...
...and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much fun we can have.
jeez, without Slippy-Flippies or angry masturbating? How is that possible?
sarcasm is anger's ugly cousin. From now on, unacceptable.
Dave, I got this for you.
it's a wonderfully therapeutic tool.
record your thoughts on this whenever you feel angry.
I'm feeling very angry right now...
...because I only have one bed and no couch.
not a problem.
in Europe, it's not considered unusual for three or four men to share a bed.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm proud to be an American.
by the way...
I like to sleep in the nude.
you hear that frog?
Nope.
what do you want?
I'm just recording your demeanor upon awakening.
good to see you got your underwear back on.
6: 30?
I don't gotta be up till 7.
you've got to make my breakfast.
Dave, cooking is very relaxing and therapeutic.
I want two eggs, over easy and unfertilized...
...wheat toast, dry, and please...
...tell me you've got ketchup.
there's a Denny's down the street.
not only do they have ketchup...
...but they got the angriest waitresses I've seen.
you could have a blast with the Goosfraba thing down there.
your eggs.
holy shit! - I said over easy!!
now, why did I do that?
because I refused to spoon with you last night?
the angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes.
Alpha-Bits.
no matter how old I get, always a culinary delight.
no explanation for the egg throwing. He's a psycho.
don't sulk, Dave. Eat. Sit down.
we'll be off to work in a jiffy.
we'll be off to work." Now, by "we'Il," I assume you mean just me, right?
well, I have to join you at work.
full contact.
that will make me look nuts, Buddy, bringing a shrink to work...
...you whipping eggs at people. I don't know.
you must never be ashamed that you sought help for yourself, Dave.
it's not a weakness.
I mean, I gotta be there by 9: 00.
I don't think we'll make it on time. You're not even dressed.
the Talmud says: "Wherever you look...
...there's something to be seen.
look, Dave.
what exactly was that all about? - What?
you just ran through a red light. Are you trying to get us both killed?
I'm a little flustered right now. I have to be to work in eight minutes.
flustered?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!
holy shit! What are you doing? - I need you to unfluster.
my boss is going to go nuts on me if we're late, so please?
we will proceed when you are centered.
I'm centered, I'm centered.
there's 10, 000 people behind us. Let's go, crazy man.
what is that? Is that good?
we're going to sing a song.
no. I don't want to sing a song. I want to go to... I've gotta go.
here we go.
the magic of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's West Side Story.
I Feel Pretty.
get this moving. What the hell's your problem?
shut your pie-hole! We're working here!
Wow. Sorry.
move your ass, dipshit!
burn in hell!
Yes!
you feel stunning.
and entrancing.
you're late.
Yes. There was a little bit of a tie up on the bridge.
I didn't ask for a traffic report. You're always late.
now is the first time I've been late. But you're right. I'm sorry.
may I interject?
you were about to say something else before you said, "I'm sorry."
we mustn't absorb and repress.
who's this? - I'm his anger management therapist.
you're in anger management?
temporarily, yeah.
do you remember the flight to St. Louis...
...that I was on when they had to turn the plane around?
Yeah, yeah. Because of that unruly passenger in coach.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
he doesn't like people touching his clubs.
well, that unruly passenger was me.
I got arrested at Kennedy. That's why I didn't make the next flight.
you said your apartment caught fire.
dissembling is a common tool of the anger junkie.
might I have your first name, Mr. Head? And tell me it isn't Dick.
it's Frank. - Fran.
isn't that normally a girl's name?
what went on on that flight?
to be honest with you, it was a mix-up. I...
jibber jabber. Jibber jabbering. Mumbo jumbo.
denial. Key, key, key, key, key, key.
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus out of a flight attendant.
I didn't. - You broke her nose.
I broke the cocktail waitress's nose.
I mean, I accidentally did that.
Dave, you have a disease.
would you apologize if you were a diabetic? Of course not.
why do you feel you have to apologize because you're suffering from T. A. S?
toxic Anger Syndrome.
I don't have T. A. S.
he's angry. It's a sickness, not a crime, Fran.
his name is Frank!
no. I'm sorry.
clothes for cats isn't really a new idea...
...but there was never really a line made for overweight cats...
...who might feel a little self-conscious about how they look in certain outfits.
that's why I got the baggy sweater on him, to cover up his gut.
and the beret to take attention off his plump head.
Oh, little Meatball. You tie this up tight...
...and away goes the chin.
I'm so handsome.
Hey, Dave. This is your office? - Andrew.
what are you doing here? - I played golf with Frank.
he's friends with my dad. We're members of the same country club.
Really? I've been wanting to play golf with him a long time.
is it awesome there? - It's nice.
so, anyway, Dave, how's anger management going?
who told you about that?
Linda's my best friend. There's no secrets between us.
for the love of Mike! This guy's your girl's best friend?
no. I mean, I like to consider myself her best friend...
...but Andrew is her best friend friend, if that makes any sense.
you ought to golf yourself. You look a little stressed out.
I gotta go. Bye.
well, well, well.
this guy's got quite a basket on him.
Really? I didn't notice that.
do you really want the love of your life hanging around with a guy...
...who looks as though he could satisfy a blue whale?
well, it's... I'm doing okay myself, pal.
maybe it's the way his pants fit him.
what's up?
this is your young lady? - That's my Linda.
my, oh, my.
I was toying with the notion that you were gay because of the kitty-cat clothes, so forth.
what does she do?
she teaches poetry. Poetry teacher.
I love poetry.
Oh, my, my, my. It's...
Yes, it's a good picture of her.
well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a history of unorthodox techniques.
he's got a dozen lawsuits pending.
so it's not just me. This guy is nuts, isn't he?
or a genius.
but if you could prove that he's nuts: audiotape, video, picture, whatever...
...I'll arrange a hearing.
I gotta go. I think he's coming.
Hi, Nancy.
what are you doing in the ladies' room?
sorry. I just heard you guys got cleaner seats than us.
not after I get through with them.
I don't care for the way you've ironed my shirts, Dave. Try it again.
I've been very patient with you. - Beware the fury of the patient man.
I'm serious! - Too serious.
get undressed.
what did you say?
take off your clothes.
I've got a stress-reduction technique to show you.
it'll be good for you. - Take off my clothes?
do you want to see me naked, Buddy?
are you a homophobe, Dave?
no, I'm a pulling-my-penis-out-in-front-of-you-a-phobe.
let's take a walk on the wild side.
what's up, baby? - Why are we here?
I'm not a homophobe.
my lawyer's gay. His boyfriend is gay.
and are they all aware that you despise them?
looking for company, baby?
no. We're not. Thank you.
it's worth 50 bucks if you get in the back seat with my friend here and have a little chat.
my pleasure, Mr. Eyebrows.
Oh, boy, here we go.
hello. -Hey. Good to see you.
what's your name, baby? - Melvin.
his name is David. Don't dissemble.
I'm not dissembling. That's my Hebrew name.
I'm Galaxia. That's my German name.
great.
where are you from originally, Hebrew Melvin?
Brooklyn.
what part of Germany do you hail from?
I'm from a little Bavarian village called Lickin Zee Dickin.
care to visit?
actually, I like to spend most of my time in Girls Without Wieners-ville.
I'm more comfortable there.
he's just not used to male intimacy.
well, that's okay, because I'm a lady.
Oops, no, I'm not.
Whoa! There it is.
I feel like dancing. Dancing.
Oh, my God.
what does this have to do with anger management?
Oh, are you an angry boy? - No.
do you need some discipline?
no, thank you very
Oh! Hey! Hey, watch that shit!
listen, ladies! Gentleman! Lentleman!
I'm not having sex with a she-male! Relax!
Galaxia, you may get out of the car now.
your services are no longer required.
you know what?
you guys are freaks.
give me the tape recorder.
come on.
patient number 135, David Buznik has learned the difference between unhealthy anger and righteous anger.
thus he has advanced to the second level of my program.
great. Can I go throw up now?
I'm a lady. Oops, no, I'm not.
whoa, there it is. -I feel like dancing.
wasn't that sick? She looked like Olivia Newton-John if she was really ugly and had huge balls.
but Buddy didn't order you to have sex.
I'm getting a call. Please hang on.
Hello? - Is Buddy there?
no, he's in the shower right now.
this is Becky, his assistant.
just tell him his mom called from Boston.
she said she's having some minor surgery.
it's not serious, but she'll be at Boston County Hospital for the next two days.
miracles of modern science. I am stimulating my hair follicles...
...and brushing my teeth at the same time.
it looks really good.
what's the matter?
your mom. They took her to the hospital, Buddy.
what's wrong with my mother?
she's having surgery.
I'm sorry.
is it serious? - When is surgery not serious?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
maybe I better get up to Boston...
...see what's going on up there.
Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you just go up there.
spend some quality time. I'll stay here.
it'll be good for you guys.
Oh, God.
you're all I got, Mom. Please don't leave me.
no more clam chowder.
buddy...
...it was a joke.
I'm sorry. You don't have to cry anymore.
a joke? - Yeah.
Oh, boy.
a joke. A jo-- I...
I can't believe that I fell for that one.
I really thought my mother was having surgery.
I'm going to get you back for that one.
just so you know, she really is having surgery.
I thought you said you were joking.
no, the serious part was the joke.
she's having surgery, but just minor surgery.
maybe I better get up to Boston...
...see what's really going on up there.
why don't you--? You just shoot up there. I'll be here.
what?
I can't believe he's making me go. -How come you guys aren't flying?
because Dr. Cocoa Puff said legally I'm not allowed to get on a plane.
meanwhile, I've got Head up my ass about that catalog.
I've got to get it done with nut-boy in Boston.
why can't Head write his own catalog?
because I've got to earn that promotion.
you've been doing his job for years. You should be his
I'm sorry. I know this is really stressing you out.
I'm sure that it's going to be over before you know it.
Yeah, if I don't get caught popping any Jelly Stingers.
well, that's going to be tough!
Oh, God. There he is.
that's him? - Yes.
what? Oh. Okay, I'll hold that.
my
the quiet warmth
smoldering beneath the rituals of hope for familiarity
a coursing underground river
pregnant with the chance currents of knowledge and love - What? - That's my poem! I wrote that.
I know.
that is your poem. I love that poem.
I found it crumpled up behind the sports pages...
...on the floor of David's bedroom.
shades of early Emily Dickinson. - Who was great on Police Woman.
thank you. And thank you for rescuing it from the floor.
I think I better get going.
I'll miss you, big guy, so take good care.
how about a kiss? - I'd love a kiss.
I think she's talking to me. I think I can handle it.
so why don't you back up an inch or two.
got it.
thank you. And, take care.
have a great trip, you guys.
Oh, we will.
Bye.
what?
some mindless nitwit is parked behind me.
good. Then we can't go.
no, I can get out.
get in. - I don't know how you'll get out.
try to wiggle out, you're going to get a ding. But you know everything.
what's he doing?
well, you're batting a thousand...
...in craziness.
now we're bumping into cars.
I'm just making a little room to back up.
if I had lost my temper...
...would I have had the presence of mind to leave my card and my insurance information?
whatever, Mr. Insane-Vein-Popping-A-Little-Too-Far-Out-Of-His-Head-While-Swinging-The-Bat Guy.
I think you've got room to back up.
why haven't you taken Linda off the market?
think you can do better?
I'm going to ask her to marry me when I'm ready.
nobody wants to settle down with a 35-year-old secretary.
procrastination, Dave.
I'm not procrastinating.
I even think about how I'm going to pop the question.
husky down jacket. Husky Eskimo look.
what's your plan, ask her at a Yankee game?
actually, yes. How did you know?
I said the corniest thing I could think of.
if you knew Linda, you'd know how uncorny it would be to her.
putting up a "Marry me, please" on the scoreboard...
...proclaiming my love for her in front of thousands of strangers.
as you seem to have noticed, I'm a little bit jumpy with public affection.
you seemed to be lovey-dovey back there.
glad you think that's funny. I gotta work.
a five-hour trip to find out Mommy had a jelly bean removed from her nose.
I'm glad I missed work. Can we eat now?
you could have her, you know.
I'm sure she'd love to hang out with a goofy secretary whose only talent is nostril wiggling.
girls love that. -Dave...
...you've got a lot more going for you than wiggly nostrils.
I want you to go over there and ask that woman out.
no, I got a girlfriend.
I'm not telling you to elope with her. Just go over and flirt a little bit.
flirting is cheating's ugly cousin, Buddy.
I'm not a cheater.
is it cheating if you're passed around the cell block like a peace pipe?
because that is what's on the docket for you if you don't go and ask her out.
okay, Dave?
Oh, God.
that's my boy.
excuse me.
I was wondering if I could buy you a drink. I see that you have a drink...
...but I could get you another when you're through with that one.
bite me.
nice meeting you. Okay.
can you guess why she rejected you?
she wanted to be like the 2000 other girls who said that to me growing up?
no. Self-hypnotic negative imagery.
confidence is the key to winning a young lady's attention.
now, listen to me very carefully.
approach Miss Thing again. -No.
with confidence.
and if she says no this time...
...I will admit that I am a failure as a therapist...
...and release you from my program.
you'll release me from your program?
just go over there and repeat the following verbatim:
I'm sorry I was so rude before...
...but it's difficult for me to express myself when I'm on the verge of exploding in my pants.
get out of here. - Trust me, Dave.
if you are calm as well as witty, she will respond.
witty went out the window with the pants explosion thing, thanks.
my offer stands.
so if I repeat that crazy shit...
...you probably stole from a porno flick, you sick bastard...
...and get rejected...
...you'll release me from the program?
exactly.
here we go.
go get them, Mr. Johnson.
I'm sorry I was so rude before...
...but it's difficult for me to express myself when I am on the verge of exploding in my pants.
you are too cute.
get the fuck out of here.
I'm Kendra. - I'm Dave.
let me buy you a drink.
can I get a cosmopolitan?
I couldn't take it anymore...
...so finally I just tell my boss:
Hey, baldy, if I want crap out of you, I'll squeeze your head.
I didn't say that, but I should have. - You are so funny.
too bad you're leaving town. We could have fun together.
unfortunately, I am leaving in the morning.
in fact, I think I gotta get back to my friend.
what's the matter?
you gotta be kidding me. - What's wrong?
my friend took off on me.
I can give you a ride.
I don't even know where the guy lives.
we can hang out at my place until you get in touch with him.
I bet there's like 50 Rydells in here.
I shouldn't eat this. I'm getting so fat.
what? You're not fat.
my clothes hide it, but I'm getting gooey right here.
I don't see any goo.
you want to see goo, I'll show you my ass.
well, I see it, and I didn't five years ago.
I went out with this guy, and he wouldn't sleep with me.
and I asked him why, and he said that when he saw me without my clothes that I look like a porker.
he was probably just nervous because you're beautiful and...
anyways, you're not a porker. You're the un-porker.
you're Sizzlean.
you're so sweet, Dave. - Well, you're sweet, Kendra.
thanks for having me here. He said her name was Rose.
rose.
rose Rydell. Rose Rydell. Rose Rydell.
rose Rydell! I got it!
Kendra...
...even though I'd love to see you take that bra off...
...because it represents a team I've hated my entire life...
...I think you gotta keep it on.
Why?
because I got a girlfriend.
I'm not a child, Dave.
if you think I'm a porker, then just come right out and say it.
no. I don't think you're a porker.
then why when the idea of sleeping with me comes up do you all of a sudden have a "girlfriend"?
because I do. I do. I have a girlfriend.
said the liar to the beached whale!
you're not a beached whale.
if anything, you could even gain a few pounds.
so now I'm too skinny for you?
no. I didn't mean that.
is this what you want, Dave? - No.
if I put on a few pounds...
...will you be able to stifle your vomit long enough to have sex with me?!
holy shit.
are you such a hot stud that you'll break me in two?!
you're angry right now. Wanna sing? Do you know "I Feel Pretty"?
get out! Get out! -Stop!
get out!
get out!!
porker!
fatty!
no!!
how did it go, pal?
why'd you ditch me? - What are you talking about?
you gave me the signal.
I didn't give you the signal to leave.
I gave you the signal to say your gross pickup line actually worked.
well, of course it did.
so did Little Davey need some anger management?
that chick was killer. - Serial killer.
she tried to chocolate me to death.
anyways, I don't cheat on Linda.
speaking of Linda, she called earlier. - Oh, yeah?
she seemed a little bit bent out of shape.
about what? - Your being out with another woman.
how would she know that? - I told her.
what else could I do? - What else could you do?
you could've told her something else. I was at the bank. I was at the store.
I ate bad guacamole and I couldn't stop shitting!
any of those would have been fine!
well, I'm sorry, Dave, but I don't lie for my patients.
you want to leave your friend and run off and chase some hot babe...
...you can't expect me to cover for you.
I did what you told me to do, you sick, demented man.
what are you laughing at?
what's so funny?
Kendra is an ex-patient of mine, an actress. Pretty good one too.
I arranged for her to be in the bar and for you to pick her up.
you were messing with me?
Yeah. You know, just a joke between friends...
...like the one you pulled on me about my dying mother.
I told you I'd get you back for that.
all right.
so you really didn't talk to Linda.
of course I did. That's what made it so funny.
Where's your phone?
she's not home, Dave. She went out with her pal Andrea.
she doesn't know any Andreas. You mean Andrew?
Yeah, that's it. Andrew, the testicle with legs.
"the testicle with legs." Great!!
now wait a minute. Calm down a bit. Try some deep breathing.
maybe just hum a little "I Feel Pretty."
no!! How about you hum the "I'm a Crazy Asshole" song?
and take me home, you psychotic piece of wacko.
I never thought you'd take it like this.
so, what, we're not going to talk at all?
would you forgive me if I told you I called Linda last night...
...after our little fracas and explained that it was my fault?
what did she say?
well, she's not mad at you anymore, but she let me have it pretty good.
you deserved it. I did nothing wrong.
I know. I know.
friends?
take a little nap. -I am tired.
well, you had a rough night.
stop with the cupcake!
rise and shine, Sir Snoozola.
what's going on? Where are we?
well, at a great deal of expense and effort...
...Arnie Shankman.
we do desire a confrontation with him, do we not?
what? Do you mean the kid who bullied me in fifth grade?
Dave, I think it's pivotal for you to confront your childhood nemesis.
remember, for 22 more days, you are mine.
this is where Arnie Shankman lives?
you're kidding me. You're going to make me confront a monk.
great.
are you ashamed that you never stood up to him?
no. He was just a kid lashing out...
...because his sister got sent to an insane asylum.
I'm surprised your research didn't tell you that.
this doesn't look like him.
excuse me, Arnie Shankman?
sorry about waking you up.
my name is Pana Kamanana...
...but, yes, I was once known as Arnie Shankman.
Arnie...
Pana Kamanana...
...Dave Buznik from elementary school.
david Buznik.
this is the last place I thought I'd find you, a monastery.
you could say I've gone through a rather dramatic transformation.
could you excuse him for a second, Peanuts?
his name's not Peanuts. It's Pana Manapia.
you want me to fight a monk? He's not even allowed to hurt a plant.
for Pete's sake, this is the monk that twisted your tits!
confront him or you're going to prison!
all right. All right. All right.
anyways, what I wanted to say to you was...
...when we were kids, you kind of bullied me around a little bit...
...and I never really did anything to deserve that kind of treatment.
of course not. I was a real cretin then.
I did a lot of horrible things as a kid.
I pushed you around. I called you nasty names.
you pulled my gym shorts down in front of Sara Plowman.
that actually was pretty funny.
jeez, I don't think that it was.
now, come, David. Humor is the spice of life.
the look on your face was priceless.
Oh! Sara saw my pee-pee!
so Pena likes the spicy humor.
maybe he'd enjoy the knee-slapper you told me about the great Buddha.
what did you say about Buddha?
Dave said, "How does a guy who weighs over 600 pounds have the balls to teach people about self-discipline"?
let's not make fun of my God, here.
you know what else Dave finds particularly piquant?
recalling your nut-job sister struggling with her underpants in a straitjacket.
you think that's funny?
Dave used to con her into getting naked by saying that her clothes had ghosts in them.
that never happened.
then he'd pull out his winkie and tell her it was a strawberry ice-cream cone.
is that what you've come here to tell me?
did you expose yourself to my sister?
and don't shove me again. - It's shower-room humiliation again.
he's giving you a wet willie and making you chew on his jockstrap...
...and fart blossom and all this.
answer me, Buznik! Did you get it on with my sister?
over and over again.
and she moaned like a wildebeest.
wildebeest.
Whoo! Now, that felt good!
I wasn't expecting that from a Buddhist.
I'm a little pissed off right now. - You all right? You're all right.
David! David! No, David!
easy, boy!
sorry.
help me, brother.
help me. - Okay. Come on. Come on.
okay, we're even. We're even now.
I went crazy. I'm so sorry. -I started it.
I started it. - It's all right.
and I'm gonna finish it!
now we're even, butt-lick!
No! Don't! Don't! Don't!
what's that, Auntie Em? It's a twister!
my nipples!
Pena! Look! Your sister's back.
I got Casper in my clothes!
pretty good. - Thanks, baby.
I'll kill you!
you want that rake?
you can't get that rake from me!
look, everybody!
Pana Banana's got a heinie.
he's got a heinie! - I give!
I give! -All right. I'm sorry.
friends? - You suck!
Shankman!
wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!
I've seen enough. - Hold it right there.
this party's by invitation only.
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
hold it back there! Come on, come on.
start the car!
go! Go! Go! Come on, let's go!
now! Now! Now! Now!
Oh, boy!
we were like Butch and Sundance!
Oh, my God! I thought you were going to shoot somebody!
you really threw me some curves back there, kid.
I never expected it to go that way.
but you kicked some serious monk ass there, baby.
you're damn right, baby!
how did it feel? - I feel good! I feel incredible!
I feel bad about molesting his sister all those times, but it's all right!
you really molested a crazy girl? - No. Got you.
congratulations, keed, you've reached level three.
I would never have done anything with that girl.
don't worry. Dr. Rydell explained everything to me, and I get it.
Dr. Rydell brought up an interesting fact about me being a procrastinator...
...and I was going to wait for a Yankee game to do this...
...but...
I don't know. I... It's something I wanted to say to you...
...and I'm having a hard time saying it for some reason. But...
it's just that monks, they talk shit...
...but they can't back it up.
that's what was so hard to say to me?
you know, when I was on the phone with Buddy, he gave me some advice.
that's great. His advice is a little cuckoo...
...but somehow it works.
well, then I guess I'll just do what he suggested.
I don't think that we should see each other for a while.
buddy thinks that a trial separation will ultimately strengthen our relationship.
now, Fury Fighters...
...what keys do we need to possess before we can--?
Dave. You're late.
can I talk to you alone, please? - Sure you can
you told Linda we should have a trial separation?
Yes. - Yes?!
Yes!
separating from Linda is a crucial part of our strategy.
my strategy is to keep my girlfriend.
all right. Strictly as a friend.
Linda's been thinking about leaving you for some time.
she loves you, but she recognizes you're a neurotic mess.
you're jealous...
...self-Ioathing, resentful, insecure and a premature ejaculator.
she told you I was a premature ejaculator?
that part I was assuming.
I haven't done that in, like, eight months.
anyway, a trial separation will make you both gain a deeper appreciation for David Buznik.
after she dates a couple of losers, she'll be begging you to take her back.
so I've been thinking about it, Linda...
...and a trial separation is exactly what we need.
and if you want to start seeing other penises-people...
...I want you to feel free.
you sound upset. Are you all right?
I'm fine. Just date anybody you'd like.
and don't hold back, okay?
because there's a lot of nice guys out there and I'm cool with it.
I'll be strong.
so the guy asked me for change. I laughed. He cursed.
I whizzed on him.
what else could I do, huh? - You should've tossed a rock at him.
that's your solution for everything. The guy's homeless, right?
let him be. Set your anger free.
look at you, Lou. You've really calmed down since working with Dr. B.
we all have. - Hey, fellas.
could you bring it down a little bit?
we're trying to have dinner. The walls are really thin.
this is a free country! - What's going on with you?!
are you crazy?! - Go in! Just go in.
Goosfraba! Goosfraba!
Goosfraba.
very good. What are you guys doing here?
I need to see Dr. B. I'm in crisis.
he's not here. Why don't you go look for him?
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by and she dropped these off for you.
those are her keys to my apartment.
I think your girlfriend's cheating on you.
Why? - I heard her on her cell phone talking to a guy making a date. - I'm so sorry, Dave.
Andrew.
I'll kill that guy.
she ain't cheating on me by the way. We agreed to take a break.
she's not taking a break from the old sausage, huh?
sorry.
she's meeting the Andrew at Mort's on 86th Street now...
...if you want to go watch.
no. No, I can't do that.
we're here.
both of you showed up? -You like Stacy better or something?
it's just that I want to go on a fake date to get my girlfriend jealous...
...so I really only needed one of you guys.
well, now she'll be twice as jealous.
so do you know the guy she's with? - I think I might.
let me ask you something.
because of your profession you probably have seen a lot of them.
does size count at all, or is that just some weird thing guys think about?
this is where Gina and I always get into a heated debate.
I like them when they're really big.
and I think it's better when they're enormous.
good evening.
table for three?
may we take your coats? -No. We're okay.
the girls are gonna take their coats off.
would you like a boobs--? Booth?
actually, could you give us a table overlooking that table right there?
sure. Right this way. -Thank you.
Oh, my God. It's Stacy and Gina.
who?
nobody.
I'm so hungry I could eat you, Dave.
yummy. Yummy.
let's get wasted tonight. - Definitely.
have fun. Lucky son of a bitch.
what?
I can't believe this.
excuse me.
Linda. I'm a little embarrassed. I didn't know you were going to be here.
I guess not. Are those your friends?
I'm supposed to date other people so I figured I'd give it a try.
Gina, can you stop sucking on Stacy's finger for one second?
I want to introduce you to somebody.
Stacy, Gina, this is Linda. - Nice to meet you.
and I'd like you to meet my date.
ladies, this is Buddy Rydell.
look, Dave, it's Buddy. - I see.
you know Stacy and Gina? -Yes, yes, I do.
we're in Dave's anger group. Fury Fighters!
this is a bit awkward.
I mean, group members are not supposed to get romantically involved...
Yeah! I agree with that. - You know that.
I'd like to talk to you alone for a second.
there's a rage control technique I'd like to go over with you right now.
of course. Excuse me
what?
two of the usual, Duke. - Coming right up, Dr. B.
you're the biggest backstabbing piece of crap I ever met.
what are you saying?
I'm trying to give you a hand. It's my job.
bullshit! Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!
my job is trying to prevent Mr. Andrew from unleashing the Whopper with Cheese.
that's right. Since you've been out of the picture...
...Andrew's been burning up the wires night and day...
...trying to rekindle those hotsie-totsie nights up at Brown U.
how would you know? - You think I only tapped your phone?
what was she saying?
the good news is, I already launched a preemptive strike.
now the situation is contained.
you and I control the game.
how?
I will be uncharacteristically aggressively boring.
I keep talking about myself, acting arrogant and obnoxious.
when Linda sees what the dating world is really like then guess who comes out smelling like a white mushroom?
you swear to me this will work? - The ball's already up in the air.
incidentally, nice move bringing the girls.
very strong. Come on.
I'll see you at home in a half-hour, keed.
that's 25 dollars, pal.
we don't...
where were you? It's 1: 00.
when you hear what happened, you'll bow down and worship me like a god.
better be good. Give it to me. - Okay.
after dinner, she insisted we go home. So we hop on the bus
the bus? You took the bus? What happened to your car?
I was way too smashed to drive.
I told her I didn't want to waste money on a cab. That did not go down well.
okay. I like that.
so we get to her house...
...we have some kind of a weird argument about the number of syllables in a haiku.
poetry garbage.
she said it was getting late, we kissed and I headed on home.
now, you say you kissed?
it was nothing. Little five-second kiss. That's all.
wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
you're having this horrible evening.
how do you end up kissing, again? - I wish I knew, keed.
we were both pretty geezed up.
one second we're fighting, and the next second we're laughing...
...and then just a quick 10-second kiss.
I thought that you said five seconds.
first it was a five-second one...
...and then a little break because my beard gave her a tickle.
she's cute. And then a 10-second Frencher.
you had your crazy, corroded tongue in my girlfriend's mouth?
just a second. Just one second, Dave.
Dr. B, let it bip.
well, hello.
I shouldn't really talk right now.
well, I suppose you're right.
it's got to be done.
who was that? Linda?
I've got some good news for you and some potentially upsetting news.
first, the good news.
I'm going to sign your papers. You're a free man.
let me hear the potentially upsetting news.
Linda and I have fallen for one another.
pretty hard too.
David, I hope you believe me when I say this:
I didn't intend for this to happen.
it was no one's fault, I guess. It was just
wait a minute.
I figured this out.
you're messing with me.
I wish I were, Dave.
however, I did insist that we not go forward without your blessing...
...because we're best friends. So, what do you say, Dave?
is it all right if I date your ex?
welcome back, Mr. Buznik.
I am appalled by your assault on Dr. Rydell.
obviously, anger management has been a complete failure for you.
I'm setting a trial date for 3 weeks from today for attempted murder.
as for Dr. Rydell's safety, I'm issuing a restraining order.
which means that at no time can you come within 500 feet of him...
...or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.
court is adjourned.
coming, Peaches.
are you kidding me?
Numb-nuts, where's the catalog for my Fat Cat clothing line?
I said I'd have it by 3.
okay. - Get in gear.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I hope you have it. My presentation's in two hours.
what's this? Your fat-shit cat's been sitting there all day.
don't worry about him.
here you go. I think you're gonna like it.
it's good stuff.
that's a good picture, I think.
what the hell is this?!
you keep telling everybody you created the Husky Cat line.
I thought you'd want your picture in there. No?
question: Can I get two couches in my office?
if friends come over, I want them to feel comfortable.
what office?
Frank was nice enough to give me some creative executive position.
you gave him the job that I wanted? - He earned it.
why can't you be happy for me? Linda's gonna be.
know something? I'm sick of you hanging out with Linda.
she dumped you 15 years ago. Get over it.
I wouldn't worry about me.
it's your pal Buddy who's taking her to the Yankee game tonight.
Yankee game.
did he steal my proposal idea?
Buznik, your behavior is unacceptable.
unacceptable?
I've been getting your coffee and doing your work for five years now.
when a good position actually opens up...
...you give it to the biggest dick in the world?
I don't know about the world, but it's definitely the biggest one in the room.
now, when I started here...
...I was promised advancement opportunities.
and breaking that promise, to me, is unacceptable.
you see? I golf also. You should bring me sometime.
so when I get out of jail, sometime in the next two to five years...
...I expect you to give me the position that Andrew just resigned from.
okay. - Great.
have fun looking like Colonel Klink.
by the way, his name is not Fat-shit Cat, it's Meatball...
...and he's eating your crab cakes right now.
you starting to get excited? - Are you kidding? I'm out of my mind.
this is going to be some night.
come on. Come on.
Dr. B, how's it going? - Very well, thank you.
always a thrill. Right this way.
where the hell's a spot? Where's a spot?
Whoa! Watch it, man!
your attention, please.
your attention, please.
before tonight's National Anthem...
...Metropolitan Opera star Robert Merrill will present a special moment for two special people.
I love when they do this.
good. - Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Merrill.
Linda?! Linda!
what the hell do you think you're doing?
wait, don't I know you?
come on. - Where's your German accent?
you have me confused with somebody
I wanna get on the field. I'm a fan of Mr. Merrill's.
there's no fans allowed on that field. - Galaxia.
it's Gary.
whatever. Someone else will marry my woman if you don't let me go.
hebrew Melvin's in love. - Very much.
I can't stop love.
go. - Thank you.
don't think I don't owe you a couple smacks by the way.
good evening. Tonight, romance comes to Yankee Stadium.
Oh, my God, it's Dave.
what the heck are you doing here?
I wanna borrow this for a second. - That's my mike!
Linda? Where are you?
don't move.
Linda? Are you out there, honey?
Linda, I'm not mad at you.
Oh, shit.
I know that crazy man brought you here.
Davey's going crazy!
I've done crazier stuff than that to win back a chick.
once I ran naked through a subway station.
how was that supposed to work?
I guess I never really thought it through.
I gotta tell you something personal!
this kid lost his marbles.
I'm over here!
Linda, think about what you're doing to us.
sweet tackle. Wow!
Dave just got leveled!
nobody messes with my microphone. - I'm sorry.
Bob?
everything all right, Buddy? - Oh, yeah.
I've never seen you so excited.
it's not every day a man gets to propose marriage to the woman he loves.
now, here's what I want you to write on the scoreboard.
Linda! Linda, I've loved you since the day I met you!
I won't let you do this to us!
don't marry him!
don't marry him!
wait!
let this man finish what he came here to say.
let the man back in.
who was that guy? - I think it's Regis Philbin.
thank you, Mayor Giuliani. You're the man, by the way.
this clown better hurry up. My arm's starting to ice over.
chill, Rocket. Goosfraba.
Goosfraba.
Goosfraba.
I can understand why you wanted to see other people. I really can.
buddy Rydell is a psycho!
but he was right about one thing.
I was an angry guy.
mainly angry at myselffor letting people treat me like crap all the time.
but I don't want to be that angry guy anymore.
I wanna change.
if you give me a chance...
...I can show you that I got the guts to stand up for what I believe in.
and I believe in us, Linda.
I love you with all my heart, and I know you love me back.
I should be your husband...
...not that weirdo.
I want to have a family with you. I want to have kids with you.
kids who have your eyes and your lips,and my last name. That's all I wish on them.
please marry me, Linda.
before I make my decision, you have to do something for me.
you have to kiss me in front of all these people!
you can do it, David!
give her a five-second Frencher!
kiss her, David.
kiss her, David.
kiss her, David!
kiss her, David.
go Yankees!
Dave's a dirty boy.
that wasn't so bad, was it?
I can't believe you actually started to fall for that crazy man.
buddy's not such a bad guy.
Congratulations! You just graduated from anger management!
I'm glad your car died. The train's romantic.
don't change the subject.
you're telling me the past two weeks of my life was just therapy?
well...
Yeah.
I met with Buddy after reading his book...
...and I told him about some of the things going on in your life...
...and how upset it was making you and how nuts it was making me.
he said that he thought he could help, but it would be tough.
so how much of this thing was a setup?
well, the guy in your seat on the plane, the flight attendant, the judge...
...they're all friends of Buddy's.
what about the air marshal who tasered me? Was he in on it?
no, he was just having a bad day.
son of a bitch.
skipper, how you doing?
buddy Rydell, you're a great man.
I was just doing my job. I never doubted you for a minute.
except when Galaxia had ahold of you.
did you just call that guy Buddy Rydell?
a guy named Buddy Rydell left this cardon what's left of my Lexus!
Oh, yeah. For insurance purposes.
your insurance was canceled!
Grenada!
don't point that gun at Buddy. I'm the one who smashed your car up.
Dave?! - No!
I'm sick of guys like this.
you wanna mess with my friends, shoot me first.
don't! - Are you crazy?
settle down.
butt out! Tough guy's going to learn a lesson.
I'm not afraid. Dr. Rydell taught me not to be afraid of anybody.
can I ask you a question, though?
got you!
Dr. B, Davey just pulled a joke on us!
and how does that make you feel, Lou?
Chuck.
we were just doing a joke. That's my friend.
are you okay?
he feels stunning.
Hi. I'm Chuck. Here's a few things you might need to know.
I programmed it to remove the Intersect from Chuck's head.
it's over, Chuck. The Intersect is out.
you're a spy, Chuck? -Yeah, more or less, yeah.
awesome!
don't you have a dream, Morgan?
I'd like to be a Benihana chef.
morgan out. -You're free, Morgan!
Chuck, where have you been?
I was getting your wedding present.
dad...
Where're you headed? -Burbank.
got a wedding to go to.
hmm, thank you for joining us.
Emmett, I've waited a long time for this day.
thought of so many ways I could say it out loud and how it'd finally feel to get it off of my chest.
let me stop you, Chuck.
I am incredibly flattered.
but I am a flaming heterosexual.
what?
what? No, no, I'm, I'm, I'm out of here.
I'm, I'm done.
well, leaving is not the answer.
I am just touched that you are taking it so hard.
Emmett, you don't understand!
I quit! No more Buy More. No more you.
you can take your flag and your job and shove it.
ditto.
just what do you think you're gonna do for the rest of your life?
anything I want.
Chuck, what are your plans for the future?
well, I was gonna get a good champagne buzz going on at my sister's wedding followed by a nice extra-long slow dance with my date.
vocationally speaking?
Oh, that, no, nothing, nothing lined up just yet.
how would you feel about working on the new Intersect project?
your government has been rebuilding its own Intersect.
you've shown real promise.
we'd like you to be an analyst.
your country is calling you, Mr. Bartowski.
uh, well, then I think my country might have the wrong number, 'cause I'm just Chuck Bartowski, not a hero.
very well.
I guess that concludes Project Bartowski.
agent Walker, I'll need you for just a moment more.
chuu What exactly is this?
it's your pay packet, numbnuts.
Hi-yo!
Yeah, you know, if you were a true patriot, you wouldn't even cash it.
thank you for saving my life at least once a week.
see?
guys can hug.
not if they don't have their man parts.
that's a good point.
you've done good work here.
thank you.
it's in case of emergencies.
my personal number, but, uh, your fingers better be on fire when you're dialing.
agent Walker, I'm sure you'll be pleased to know you're in charge of the new Intersect project, working in tandem with Agent Larkin.
and this time, the Intersect goes in my head.
now that we've got the Cube, it's ready for upload.
BECKMAN: You leave for Zurich together at 0800.
auf Wiedersehen.
Walker and Larkin...
together again.
finally, you can get out of here.
everything is going to be perfect. I even had your Toyota washed for you, man.
Oh, perfect, thanks, bro.
Oh, uh, I'll be right back.
just a second.
Hi, can I talk to my sister? It will only take a second.
Oh, no, Chuck. It's bad luck to see the bride...
it's fine, I don't believe in that stuff.
all right, just get in, get in. Get in, get in!
what?
look at you. Ellie, your dreams are coming true.
if it were up to me, I would have a small ceremony on a beach.
sand between m y toes, people I love.
but we all make sacrifices for family, right?
where the hell is my blonde?
anyway, uh...
I don't know exactly yet what I'm going to get you for your wedding present.
but I'll start with this: I quit the Buy More today.
what?
the Buy More is no more.
Oh, Chuck, that is...that is incredible.
what are you going to do with your future?
I don't know.
honey: Oh, there she is!
I made my dreams come true, Chuck.
what are you gonna do about yours?
Sarah, can we talk for a moment?
look, I wanted to tell...
Ellie wanted me to make sure that you have the rings.
Yeah, right.
you look like a real spy.
you look like a real bridesmaid.
Sarah, I... -Wait, uh...
there's something that I have to tell you.
I can't wait.
I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
okay, everyone keeps asking me what I'm going to do with my future, and the truth is, I don't have a clue.
all I do know is that I want you to be in it.
please, I really have to tell you.
no guns, no lies, just us.
just like I've always wanted it.
I've recently come into a little bit of money.
so, any place you want to go, any place at all as long as it's sunny, with little umbrella drinks.
what I'm getting at here is...
Sarah Walker, will you do me the honor of taking a vacation with me?
Chuck, I'meaving in the morning.
the details are classified but I'm working on the new Intersect project with Bryce.
I- I'm so sorry. I wanted to wait until after the ceremony to tell you.
thank you for coming to the wedding.
good for the cover.
today's a day we'll remember forever, son.
Oh, my God!
I believe we've met before.
no, I'm Ted Roark.
you're the CIA agent who's in deep trouble.
by the way, congratulations on your sister's happy day.
her gown is gorgeous.
full bodice, love the beading.
what the hell do you want?
Ooh, there's no need to curse.
you know damn well what I want.
I...
I want the Intersect Cube.
I- I can't, I can't, I can't give you that.
Oh, you'll find a way, I'm sure.
Oh, sorry, I forgot the threat part.
if you don't deliver that Cube within a half hour, 40 minutes tops with traffic,
I'm going to kill the bride.
nice.
Hey, Chuck.
sorry, can I talk to you real quick? I'm just feeling a little nervous.
buddy, I'm so sorry, I can't talk right now.
what's the matter? You could tell me, I...
I might be able to help.
it's, uh...
it's the rings. It's the rings.
I have to go home and get them.
find Sarah, pull her aside, and specifically tell her that I forgot the rings.
the wedding is in 20 minutes. Ellie is gonna kill you.
thanks for that.
unless...
I stall the wedding. Okay, no one will even know you're gone.
they'll just blame me. It'll be fine.
you'd do that for me?
of course I would, dude. You've saved my ass a million times.
it's about time I saved yours. But go.
what is that smell? -COMMANDOS: There he is!
ladies. You ladies get soft without me?
it's been a while. Good to see you, sir.
Yeah, a long time, Miles...
come on, Casey. -This is Casey. Leave a message.
who's ready to do some hunting?
Dr. Awesome.
don't take another step.
my wife warned me about you.
good warnings, I hope.
retreat two steps back.
I need to get in there. You...
Oh, uh, Dr. Woodcomb, your wife wants me to tell you to go to the car and get backup hosiery.
does that make sense?
man my post. Don't let this one in.
Yes, sir.
Sarah, listen to me.
uh, Chuck forgot the rings, so he-he went home to go get them.
he what? -Yeah, the wedding rings. He blew it.
I have to stall the wedding.
how do I stall a wedding?
uh, do it, Morgan, by any means necessary.
right, right.
how the hell do I stall this wedding? Think, man, think.
BRYCE: It's gone.
Bryce? -To the new Intersect.
where? Where? Where is it?
Chuck, you know I can't tell you that. That's top secret. Not even Beckman...
no, I need it, Bryce. I need it.
my family's in danger. Ted Roark and his FULCRUM team are at the wedding.
he's going to kill Ellie unless I bring him the Cube.
Roark can't have it.
he'll murder everyone.
no.
you're going to give them me.
they think you're the Intersect.
they've been looking for me all along.
the Cube can't fall into the wrong hands. I made a promise to Orion.
you knew.
that was the deal.
your dad knew I protected you at Stanford.
I was the only spy he would trust.
I can't believe you've known this whole time.
he wanted to keep you out of this.
but I knew you could handle the Intersect, I knew Sarah would find you, and most importantly, you deserved to know the truth about your father.
he's a hero.
now, let's go get your sister married.
Yeah, just...
what's the holdup?
uh, the bride is perfect.
she'll only wilt from here.
Oh, we can't find Chuck.
Oh, and the blonde is gone, too.
just now?
excuse me.
this is a really weird family.
don't chew gum.
something's wrong.
Ted Roark and his men are inside.
he's alive?
how did...
did you bring a gun?
I'll think of something.
please, check the chapel and the bridal chamber. Make sure there's nobody else.
wait.
use the South East entrance, through the kitchen.
okay, thanks.
hello.
it's on?
hello.
uh, I-I'm Morgan Grimes, unofficial member of the wedding party.
uh, so, uh, we have some pre-wedding entertainment planned for you guys.
so, without further ado, I present to you Jeffster!
it's Jeffster!
what's going on?
I don't know, but this wedding just got good.
dude, we got the perfect song. -Knock 'em dead. Knock 'em dead.
okay, this is in four/four time.
it's in D. Watch me for the changes.
Morgan, you are ruing my wedding!
listen to me. If you hit me, know that it only teaches me to hit.
okay, now for reasons I cannot say, I have to stall this wedding.
tell me why.
because Chuck is in trouble, and I'm saving him, man.
Chuck told you to do this?
Yes.
CCUCK Okay, okay, I'm with you.
okay, no Sarah.
and that is definitely not the wedding march.
um, can one of you please go see what's going on out there?
now! Thank you.
focus on the calm.
Kevin, why are you letting Sam Kinison and an Indian lesbian wreck your wedding?
dad, just chill out, okay?
you know what?
I'm feeling a bit peckish.
don't you dare!
if you ever want to see the Intersect again, you will not touch anything in this room.
do I make myself clear?
today is my sister's wedding day, and believe me, you don't want to see her angry.
Where's the Intersect, Chuck?
uh, a-about that...
kill him.
ho down. I mean, hold on. Just hold on a second, all right?
finally.
I did bring anIntersect with me.
AnIntersect? -BRYCE: Mr. Roark.
Mr. Larkin.
the Human Intersect.
kk BRYCE: Roark, you want me.
now let Chuck and his people go. We leave, they stay, nobody else needs to know.
terrific plan.
thing of it is, FULCRUM wants Chuck here dead no matter what.
so, with that said, shoot Mr. Bartowski, or...
Sarah, take him.
CHUCK: Oh, God, not the flowers!
CHUCK: Not the centerpieces.
I'm dry. Any more knives?
I threw all eight.
man: Get up!
Oh, God.
someone just shoot me now.
I can help you with that, Chuck.
a real shotgun wedding.
just think, that terrible pun is the last thing you'll ever hear.
Hello, Ted.
waited 20 years to do that.
COMMANDO: All clear, sir.
you rang.
what happened?
uh, everything's all right, Ellie. There was just a minor centerpiece problem.
Oh, no.
wedding canceled.
this is officially a disaster.
I can't believe that my spy life has wrecked my real life.
again.
I've completely ruined my sister's wedding day.
I'm sorry, son. I...
if anyone knows how you feel, it's me.
you had no choice, Charles.
you saved her life.
you okay?
no, I'm not.
I'm not okay.
I don't want to have to save my sister using a Special Forces team.
I just want to be a normal guy who helps his sister in normal ways.
like right now, if I could give her anything in the world, I would...
I think I might know how to fix this.
you got time for one more mission before you take off?
it's not what a normal guy would do.
don't forget to lock it.
Yeah.
Yeah, Walker, what is it?
you're kidding.
Roger that. We're on it.
Ellie, are you all right?
Chuck, just please go away.
I can't believe your idiot friends ruined my wedding.
I'm just-- I'm never going to forgive Morgan for this.
well, I think you're going to have to.
because Morgan...
and Lester, and Jeff-- they only did what I asked them to do.
what?
idid all this. I forgot your rings.
so I told them to stall.
so if you're going to be mad at someone, you should be mad at me.
please say something.
You...ruined...
the most important day of my life.
Look...Ellie, you have to trust me, okay.
take these..
and I'll take care of the rest.
trust me.
sir, how do you spell begonia?
sound it out.
no, no, no, that clashes with the bunting.
Yes, I-I appreciate that you require extra time to permit the area, but this is a national security matter.
we are gathered here to join together Eleanor Faye Bartowski and Devon Christian Woodcomb in matrimony.
who gives this woman in marriage to this man?
we do. We do.
I love you. I love you.
watch him.
a partnership should not be entered into lightly, but with much consideration.
if any person can show just cause why they should not be joined, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
you're not coming with me, are you?
justice OF THE PEACE: Do you have the rings?
CASEY: Was that...you were talking about, secondhand smoke?
three hundred.
sir.
Roark wants to talk to you.
watch my cards.
watch them.
better not be about food.
don't!
sorry, sir. We've been through a lot.
how long you been FULCRUM?
I'm not with FULCRUM.
go ahead and pull the trigger. I don't want to look at your face.
you just killed three Marines in cold blood.
Yeah.
but none of them saved my life.
thank you.
for what? -For what?
for-for all of this. For my wedding gift.
this is...
I don't how you did all this.
well, I can't exactly take all the credit.
well, first the beach and now this.
I don't know.
you're pretty amazing, little brother.
sometimes I think you have super powers.
I wish. -I know.
Captain: Chuck, man, you saved the day.
looks like you're the big hero.
Thanks, bro.
well, now I really am your bro.
Yes, you are.
I can't believe you're actually leaving me.
all right, don't, Chuck. I'll cry.
we don't want that now, do we?
I'm happy for you, buddy.
I think that you are going to be the greatest Hibachi chef in the world.
I don't know, man. This whole...
making your dreams come true thing" is hard.
and the bigger the dream, the harder it gets.
you know, on one side, you know, the girl you love.
and then on the other, life as you know it.
it's just, you know, friends and family, and job you can't stand.
I don't know, man. I should just go with Anna, right?
but then I, uh...
I'm overthinking this, aren't I?
Yeah, yeah, you are.
go with your heart, buddy.
our brains only screw things up.
Where's Bryce?
gone.
they're uploading him with the new computer tonight.
off to save the world.
I guess both of you are.
you want to dance?
you know I do.
a bit of both.
I reconfigured the Cube for you under two conditions:
you stop looking for me, and you leave my son alone.
we asked Chuck to be on my team.
he said no.
good-bye, Orion.
you made changes-- to the Intersect.
to my initial designs.
the data architecture is different.
what does this new computer do?
you don't want to know.
agent Larkin. It's time to go.
you belong out there, saving the world.
I'm just...
I'm just not that guy.
how many times do you have to be a hero to realize that youarethat guy?
but I want more, Sarah.
I want a life.
I want a real life.
Chuck, I don't want to save the world.
I want... -STEVE: Chuck, the agent...
the agent who came for Bryce...
he isn't a CIA agent.
he's supposed to be dead.
dad, how could you possibly know that?
screw it. I...
I have an Intersect in my head. I...
I tested the computer on myself. I was young and stupid, but the intel was good.
that man isn't CIA.
Bryce. Bryce is getting the upload tonight.
steve: They're going to kill him.
they'll download the Intersect into their team instead.
well, if they know about Bryce, they know about Casey.
Sarah... -Let her go, son. You've done your part.
no, I have to go.
no, you don't. You're not a spy.
dad...
I love her.
I can't follow you, son, but take this.
thank you.
be safe, Charles.
thank you.
Hey, I'm coming with you.
stay here-- it's not your mission.
wait...
this is the Interect we're talking about, and I'm a Bartowski.
you need me.
let's go.
did you see her? Agent Walker?
she was amazing, right?
Yes, sir.
she loves another guy.
bad day to be me.
you have no idea.
Mr. Larkin.
open this door!
they're already here.
Bryce must be in the vault!
Chuck, go get help.
CHUCK: Help!
Hello, Chuck.
Bryce, Casey and Sarah are pinned down outside.
I'm on it.
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God, you've been shot.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry about this, Chuck.
no.
no, it's okay...it's okay. You're going to be fine-- it's not that bad.
take care of her. -Don't...don't say that.
you're not dying. She needs you, man, okay?
you...you guys are going to go on missions together and do exciting things and save the world.
you'll be a team again-- it will be great.
she wasn't going to come.
she wants... -Come on.
hold on, hold on, hold on.
this will destroy the Intersect.
this new computer is too powerful. It's too dangerous.
but you need...you need the computer to fight FULCRUM.
fulcrum doesn't matter, all right? They...
they're just...they're just one part of the Ring.
they'll use it against us, Chuck.
you have to do this. All right?
you have to destroy that computer, and then get out of here.
Yeah, but you can beat them.
you're a real...
hero, Bryce.
Oh, my God.
I can't figure out why Bryce did this, why he chose me.
you can do anything-- I've seen you in action.
you can't put him out in the field. He won't survive.
it's time for you to become a spy.
I'm just Chuck Bartowski, not a hero.
how many times do you have to be a hero to realize that you are that guy?
what did you do?
what did you do?
I destroyed it. You're too late.
for that, you'll die last.
Bryce, no...help me.
no, don't you touch him!
there's nothing left.
so, you lose.
you should know this.
no one stops us.
no one ever has.
who are you? -Spies, Agent Walker.
the best.
man: Sir, you should look at this.
Chuck, did you just flash?
he uploaded it.
Oh, Chuck me.
kill him.
guys...
all right. How's everybody doing out there?
all right. Right about now, give it up for a very special alpha TECH guest.
young MC!
what's up, alpha TECH?
I got a busted computer at home. Can somebody fix it for me?
bust a move!
say, "Yeah!" - Yeah!
say, "Oh, yeah!" - Oh, yeah!
say, "Bust a move!" - Bust a move!
say, "Bust a move!" - Bust a move!
let me hear you say, "Yeah!" - Yeah!
I want you to have a key to my place.
Wow. I had no idea we were at that point in our relationship.
Yes. - Wow.
where is she?
lying in my bed I hear the
clock tick and think of you
caught up in circles
confusion is nothing new
flash back
to warm nights
almost left behind
suitcase of memories
time after
sometimes you picture me...
back home I don't get to act the way I do with you.
that's why I don't have a back home. - I know.
you're so cool.
Mr. Empty Backpack.
you know about my backpack? - I googled you.
you did?
it's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.
did it bother you?
it depends.
is the bag empty because you hate people or because you hate the baggage that they come along with?
I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit.
you just don't want to be tied down with the whole responsibility thing?
I don't know what originally sparked the backpack.
probably needed to be alone.
recently, I've been thinking that I needed to empty the backpack before I knew what to put back in it.
Oh, no! - I think we're out of gas.
Hey. You're up?
Yeah, I have to fly standby and make a meeting in Cincinnati.
okay.
I made you feel cheap.
it's all right. Just leave the money on the dresser.
I'll text you later so we can swap schedules.
Hey.
I really like you.
I like you, too. - Good.
go catch your plane.
last night...
it was kind of out of hand, and I said things...
I'm not actually sure of everything that I said, - but I didn't want you to think... - Just relax.
it was nice to see you cut loose.
so, did you wake him up or slip out?
what? - This morning. Your new friend.
did you wake him up for an awkward goodbye or did you just slip out and make him feel like a whore?
I just left. - Protocol's always tricky.
what happened to Alex?
she had to leave town early to get to a meeting.
that's too bad. Where does she live? - Chicago.
thinking of going to see her?
we don't really have that kind of relationship. Try right over there.
that direction.
what kind of relationship do you have?
well, you know, casual.
sounds pretty special. - It works for us.
don't you think there's a future there?
I never really thought about it. What's going on here?
really never thought about it? - No.
how can you not think about that?
how does it not even cross your mind that you might want a future with someone?
it's simple. You know that moment when you look into somebody's eyes and you can feel them staring into your soul and the whole world goes quiet just for a second?
Yes. - Right. Well, I don't.
you're an asshole. - No.
look, I'm just dicking around. Come on. Give me a hand.
don't you think it's worth giving her a chance?
a chance to what? - A chance at something real.
Natalie, your definition of real is going to evolve as you get older.
can you stop condescending for one second or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy?
bullshit philosophy? - The isolation, the traveling.
is that supposed to be charming? - No, it's simply a life choice.
it's a cocoon of self-banishment. - Wow. Big words.
screw you.
screw you, too.
you have set up a way of life that basically makes it impossible for you to have any kind of human connection.
and now this woman comes along and somehow runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous life choice and comes out on the other end smiling just so you can call her "casual"?
I need to grow up? You're a 12-year-old.
I don't have a gauntlet...
fuck.
now, listen, these Detroit guys can be tough.
they've been getting hammered.
so, you don't get distracted. Stick with the simple stuff.
you get these packets in their hand and you get them out the door, okay?
Hey, welcome to Detroit.
what's going on here?
I've been looking at those great numbers over the last few days.
I thought maybe we should just nut up and give this a try.
we could use a little more time.
well, you got to leave the nest at some point, huh?
this is a real company, Craig. We're here to do some damage.
I know. It's a good thing we brought our best, okay.
let's stop screwing around.
all right. Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together.
I was thinking that Natalie was going to take this one.
she's hardly ready for that.
I've been watching her results the last few days. She's great.
this is a whole other animal.
you know, she created it and everything, right?
Natalie, are you not up for it?
Yeah, I'm game. - That's my girl.
just remember, don't apologize, don't tell them how hard this is for you.
today's one of the worst days they're ever gonna have in their life.
how we feel doesn't even compare.
got it. - All right. Just keep it professional.
you'll be fine.
what's all this? What's going on?
Hello, Mr. Samuels. I wish I were here with better news.
however, your position here at Wertheimer's is no longer available.
what are you talking about?
you've been let go.
just like that?
who are you?
my name is Miss Keener, and I'm here today to talk about your options.
I worked for this company for 17 years and they send a fourth-grader to can me?
what the fuck is this?
it's perfectly normal to be upset.
however, the sooner you can tell yourself that greater - opportunities are waiting for you... - Greater opportunities?
I'm 57 fucking years old.
anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.
and it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.
there's a packet in front of you. I want you to take some time and review it.
all the answers you're looking for are inside those pages.
the sooner you trust the process, the sooner the next step of your life will unveil itself.
I need you to go back to your office now and start putting together your personal things.
Mr. Samuels, that's all we can discuss now.
Mr. Samuels.
Mr. Samuels.
Mr. Samuels!
you did good.
you okay? You want me to take over?
no, I'm all right.
no. Look, we just got here.
that's one place. I think we need to try a few more.
maybe it doesn't make a difference, but it's comforting to know that we're in the next room.
I know you don't give a shit about my comfort.
I think we could try a few more, that's all I'm saying.
fine.
all right. Okay. All right.
he thought you did a great job. You did. I'm real proud of you.
Thanks.
they're pulling us off the road.
we're going home.
Really? For good?
Yeah.
good job.
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex. That was out of line.
it's all right. I understand.
I mean, who am I to be doling out relationship advice, right?
no kidding.
are you gonna be okay?
what do you mean? - In Omaha?
I don't know.
it's better than you'd think.
Ryan.
Ryan. Where are you going?
I'm grabbing another flight. Something I've got to take care of.
I'll see you back at home.
okay, just walk it in a little.
a little more.
there you go. Yeah.
got it.
they're a cute couple.
you think so? - Yeah, they'll make cute kids.
how do you like Wisconsin in February?
I like it if you're there.
and I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.
northern Wisconsin.
what are you doing this weekend?
no. - What, I haven't...
well, you want me to be your date? - Yeah. Yeah.
at your sister's wedding? - It's not like I know her that well.
look, I'm not the wedding type, right?
but for the first time in my life, I don't want to be that guy alone at a bar.
I want a dance partner. I want a "plus one.
and if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you.
excuse me. Are you available?
this line's for members of our Matterhorn Program.
Hey. Ryan.
Hey. - Kara. Hi.
Hi. - Hey. Hi.
Alex, this is my sister Kara.
Hi. - Well, hello.
Ryan's told me nothing about you.
so, you two are dating?
not exactly. - Well, hey, don't worry about it.
we're all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend.
I remember when Mom used to call Jack her boyfriend.
God. Drove me up the wall. Boyfriends are for kids, right?
so, what are you doing at the hotel?
Yeah. Okay, Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.
I'm sorry. So, you're not staying at the house?
no, there was a room on hold here, so I thought I'd just take it for the weekend.
so, the rehearsal dinner. - Yeah, tonight. I'll see you two there.
nice digs.
there's a packet.
Hey, look who's here.
Oh, my God! - He finally made it.
Oh, my God! Ryan! - Hey.
Hi.
you must be Alex. - Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?
you are so beautiful. Kara was right. - Thank you.
gosh. You look so grown-up.
I do? You're the one that's getting married.
I know, right?
you haven't even seen my ring.
look at that. - It's lovely.
Jim designed it. - That's...
Hey, Jim.
Hey. - How's it going?
Hey. I'm Ryan. - Jim. Good to meet you.
Alex. Pleasure. - Pleasure.
thank you, guys, for coming.
brother!
it's true, though. - Yeah, it's crazy.
I got the pictures you asked me to get.
you can just put them right there.
Yeah, okay.
you got so many of them up there, I almost didn't have room.
I know. It's so great. Everyone just chipped in.
what gave you the idea to do something so...
substantial.
well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture.
it's a real estate investment.
it's exciting, but we went over our finances and...
a honeymoon just kind of at this state in the game just doesn't really seem affordable.
so, you know, we just thought, "Just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures.
no, I think that's a fabulous idea. - Yeah, it's a good one.
I mean, the concept is turnkey everything.
okay? You buy a maintenance contract when you get the home.
you know, we'll whack your weeds, we'll change your light bulbs.
furniture, you can bring your own or else you can pick one of our beautiful packages.
seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks.
nice.
and we all need a place to call our own.
this is America. This is what we were promised.
it's a nice touch. - What?
the bit at the end about the promise. I like that part.
Thanks.
you... You still renting that one-bedroom?
no. I gave it up. - So, you own now?
no. - But you're looking?
no, not really.
so, you're just good?
I'm good.
well, that's good.
can you believe it's tomorrow? How are you gonna sleep?
I don't know.
well, do you want some Xanax? - I don't think that's for sleeping.
Yeah. No, I think I'll just have a glass of warm milk.
that'll do the trick. - Okay. See you tomorrow.
okay. - Bye.
Bye.
Hey. There's another box inside.
I'll grab it. - You sure?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jim seems like a good guy. - Yeah, isn't he great?
he's going to make a great husband.
you know, Julie, I was thinking, you know, with Dad not being here,
I was wondering if you had anybody to walk you down the aisle.
Yeah.
no, Jim's uncle is gonna do it.
he's been really supportive.
he's been great.
well, good. That's great. I just wanted to make sure that you...
I wanted you to be covered, that's all.
so, I should be there, what?
Yeah, the guests are arriving around 5: 00, and things get going at 5: 30, so around then.
okay.
let me... I'm gonna help you with those.
got it.
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
none of that was here.
this is all new.
Really?
is that all you got? - What?
give me a boost.
watch...
hang on.
I took Geography in here.
you ever fool around with one of your teachers?
no. Did you? - No. Not until college.
that's me on the right.
it's kind of hard to tell.
you can tell by the eyebrows.
you played basketball? - I was a point guard.
don't act so surprised.
I didn't know you were such a jock.
that's me, too.
and that.
my first fight. - How'd it go?
got my ass kicked.
this is where we used to go to make out.
Yes. Yeah. This is very romantic.
go, Cougars!
I'm really happy I came here.
so am I.
it's Kara.
Hey. - Ryan, where are you?
we're having a meltdown here.
what's going on? What happened?
it's Jim. Can you get back here? We need your help.
okay.
we got to go.
I'll grab your suit. - Thanks.
what happened? - Jim's got cold feet.
today? - Yeah, that's how cold feet work.
what do you want me to do? - Talk to him.
you want me to talk to him? - Hey, it's either you or me.
you know my track record. I've already struck out once.
I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout.
don't you talk for a living? Motivational-type stuff?
I tell people how to avoid commitment.
what kind of fucked-up message is that?
it's a philosophy. - It's stupid.
Hey, it could have helped you.
Ryan, you haven't been around much. Fuck, basically, you don't exist to us.
I know you wanna be there for her.
well, here it is. This is your chance.
Hey. What's up, Ryan?
Jim. - You ever read this before?
Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff. - Yeah, I'll say.
Kara mentioned that you were having some thoughts.
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.
and why would you say that today?
well, last night I was kind of laying in bed and I couldn't get to sleep, so I started thinking about the wedding and the ceremony, and about our buying a house and moving in together, and having a kid and then having another kid.
and then Christmas and Thanksgiving and spring break and going to football games. And then, all of a sudden, they're graduating, they're getting jobs, and they're getting married, and, you know, I'm a grandparent.
and then I'm retired. I'm losing my hair. I'm getting fat.
and then the next thing you know, I'm dead.
I'm just, like... I can't stop from thinking, "What's the point?
I mean, what is the point? - The point?
Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?
Jim, it's marriage.
it's one of the most beautiful things on earth. It's what people aspire to.
you never got married. - That's true.
I mean, you never even tried. - Well, it's hard to define try.
I don't know, just...
you seem happier than all my married friends.
look, Jim, I'm not gonna lie to you. Marriage can be a pain in the ass.
and you're kind of right. This all is just stuff that leads to your eventual demise.
Yes. - And we're all on running clocks, and they can't be slowed down or paused, and, you know, we all end up in the same place.
Yeah.
there is no point.
there is no point. That's what I'm saying.
you know,
I'm not normally the guy you would talk to about stuff like this.
if you think about it, your favorite memories, the most important moments in your life, were you alone?
no, I guess not.
Hey, come to think of it, last night, the night before your wedding, when all this shit is swirling around in your head, weren't you guys sleeping in separate bedrooms?
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment, and I was just by myself in the honeymoon suite.
kind of Ionely, huh? - Yes, it was pretty Ionely.
life's better with company. - Yeah.
everybody needs a co-pilot.
that was a nice touch. - Thanks.
so, what's the mood like out there? - It's not good.
she's pretty pissed? - She's upset.
what should I do?
go get her.
I'm such a fuck-up. I love you so much.
will you be my co-pilot?
Yes. Yes.
welcome home.
okay, this is your stop.
when am I gonna see you? - You're just gonna have to come visit.
so settled.
you're not gonna change on me, are you?
no. Same guy. Just one address.
this is your final boarding call for American Airlines flight number 3972 to Chicago.
all right. Call me when you get Ionely.
I'm Ionely.
some guy sits down in a conference room somewhere and our server routes his session to one of our termination engineers.
termination engineers"? Really?
I preferred "terminators," but it bumped with Legal.
can't imagine why.
they follow a workflow that takes them through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor.
what are they doing now? Are they practicing?
well, beta testing, role-playing. We go live at the end of the month.
Kyle, you're running through the events too quickly.
you need to give them time to acknowledge each statement, okay?
it's a legal thing.
Ryan? - Yeah. There's more?
this is ridiculous.
but, you know, Legal's really starting to come hard at me on this term "terminate," so...
ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for today's challenge speaker, Mr. Ryan Bingham.
go get them.
last year, I flew 350, 000 miles.
the moon is 250.
I want you to imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack.
I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders.
you feel them?
now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life.
start with the little things, the things on shelves and in drawers.
excuse me.
what the fuck are you doing?
okay, everyone, just relax.
Hey, you gotta sign. - Thought I did that already.
okay, thank you. - All right.
Hey, you forgot to give me your Hertz No. 1 Gold Card!
so, I was in the neighborhood.
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait, wait.
Hey, honey, who's at the door? - It's just somebody who's lost.
Alex?
what were you thinking, showing up at my door like that?
what do you mean? I... I wanted to see you.
I didn't know you had a family. Why wouldn't you tell me that?
look, I'm sorry I ruined your evening, but, I mean, you could have seriously screwed things up for me.
that's my family. That's my real life.
I thought I was a part of your real life.
I thought we signed up for the same thing.
try and help me understand exactly what it is that you signed up for.
I thought our relationship was perfectly clear.
I mean, you are an escape.
you're a break from our normal lives. You're a parenthesis.
I'm a parenthesis?
I mean...
what do you want? Tell me what you want.
you don't even know what you want.
I'm a grown-up, okay?
so, if you would like to see me again, then give me a call.
okay?
ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make.
our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Dubuque, which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our flyers today.
Oh, no. - Because he just hit 10 million miles!
Congratulations.
such an amazing accomplishment. - You must be very, very excited.
Hi, Captain. - Captain.
that seat taken?
no. No.
you're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.
don't know where you found the time. - Yeah. I don't know.
Oh, yeah.
here you go.
seventh card we've made. Small club.
we really appreciate your loyalty.
you know how many times I thought about this moment?
played out the conversation that you and I would have right here.
Really?
what did you want to say?
you know, I don't remember.
that's all right. It happens to all of us.
so, where are you from?
I'm from here.
Hello, Mr. Bingham.
how did you know it was me? - This is your dedicated line.
we reserve them for our most loyal and appreciated flyers.
I'd like to transfer some of my miles.
can I open up an account to Jim and Julie Miller?
certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer?
how many miles does it take to circle the globe?
we have our round-the-world tickets. They're 500, 000 miles each.
that'd be fine. - Got a second?
I'll call you back.
what the hell happened to you yesterday?
I was trying to get hold of you all day.
I was... Some personal stuff. What's going on?
do you remember Karen Barnes, part of a 30-person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita?
Natalie fired her.
I fire dozens of people a day. I...
she killed herself, jumped off a bridge.
fuck.
I need to know if you remember any woman that gave you any signals, depression...
they're all depressed. We're firing them.
Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, okay?
no, I don't remember anything. You never think that they're...
you don't remember any woman that gave you any signals?
anything at all, Ryan? - No, nothing stands out.
Natalie all right? - Natalie quit.
she quit? - Text message.
Yeah, fucking nice, right? No one's got any manners anymore.
she say where she was going? - No. She was a little upset.
I should give her a call.
I need you back in the air.
Hey, did you hear what I said? I thought you'd be thrilled about that.
it's fine. What about the videoconferencing?
ctc is going to pause the new-media front.
they're gonna give it some more thought.
we are gonna get our workhorses back in the air, doing what they do best, okay?
how long are you sending me out? - We're gonna let you sail and sail.
you send us a postcard if you ever get there.
so, what happened?
how exactly do you mean? - You graduated top of your class.
you seemed to have your pick of employment, including right here.
instead you went to Omaha to fire people for a living?
it's challenging work. - I'll say.
I can't imagine doing that day in, day out.
not in this climate.
I followed a boy.
well, I guess everybody does that at one point or another.
this guy says I'd be lucky to have you.
to whom it may concern,
I can't even count the number of people I've fired in my lifetime.
so many that I've actually forgotten what it's like to hire somebody.
we've never met, but I know you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener.
my advice? Take her and don't look back.
she'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.
I sure hope he's right.
well, I don't have a lot of hope, and I really don't know when it's gonna get better.
there's a lot of people unemployed, and I really don't know when there's gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.
I can't find much to talk about.
talk about being proud. I'm proud of my kids.
I think the anger comes from the fact that I just wasn't needed anymore.
I would say, you know, without my friends and my family, I wouldn't have made it.
it would have been a lot tougher if I would have had to make it on my own.
when I wake up in the morning and I look over and I see my wife, that gives me the sense of purpose.
it's not all about the money. Money can keep you warm.
it pays your heating bills, you know. It can buy you a blanket.
but it's not as... Doesn't keep you as warm as when my husband holds me.
let me get up. Let me get out. Let me find something.
so, my kids are my purpose, my family.
tonight most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids.
their spouses will ask about their day, and tonight they'll sleep.
the stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places.
and one of those lights, slightly brighter than the rest, will be my wingtip passing over.
focus.
concentrate.
master your senses.
you cannot leave any sign.
l haven't.
lmpressive.
we have purged your fear.
you are ready to lead these men.
you are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.
but first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.
no.
l'm no executioner.
your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.
that's why it's so important.
lt separates us from them.
you want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.
this man should be tried. -By whom?
corrupt bureaucrats?
criminals mock society's laws.
you know this better than most.
you cannot lead these men...
...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.
and where would l be leading these men?
Gotham.
as Gotham's favored son...
...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.
how? -Gotham's time has come.
like Constantinople or Rome before it...
...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.
lt is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.
this is the most important function of the League of Shadows.
lt is one we've performed for centuries.
Gotham...
...must be destroyed.
you can't believe in this.
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.
what he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.
l will go back to Gotham and l will fight men like this...
...but l will not become an executioner.
Bruce, please.
for your own sake, there is no turning back.
what are you doing? -What's necessary, my friend.
l will tell him you saved his life.
master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.
Yes, l have. -You look very fashionable.
apart from the mud.
are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?
as long as it takes.
l want to show the people...
...their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.
ln the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises combating poverty.
he believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.
did it?
ln a way.
their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.
people need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.
l can't do that as Bruce Wayne.
as a man...l'm flesh and blood, l can be ignored, destroyed.
but as a symbol...
as a symbol, l can be incorruptible.
l can be everlasting. -What symbol?
something elemental...
...something terrifying.
l assume that as you take on the underworld...
...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals?
you're thinking about Rachel?
actually, sir, l was thinking of myself.
have you told anyone l'm coming back?
l couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.
dead? -You've been gone seven years.
you had me declared dead?
actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public.
he wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.
those shares are worth quite a bit of money.
well, it's a good thing l left everything to you, then.
quite so, sir.
and you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank.
ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...
...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.
Dr. Crane. -Miss Dawes.
you think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?
l would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would l?
this is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...
...and moved into your asylum.
well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.
or the corrupt.
Mr. Finch.
you should check with Miss Dawes here...
...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. lf any.
what are you doing? -What are you doing, Carl?
looking out for you.
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.
drop it. -How can you say that?
because as much as l care about getting Falcone, l care more about you.
that's sweet.
we've been through all that.
blessed bat again, sir.
they nest somewhere in the grounds.
no more favors. Someone is sniffing around.
Hey, l scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.
l'm bringing in the shipments.
we are paying you for that.
maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.
l am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.
but you know who l'm working for, and when he gets here
he-- He's coming to Gotham?
Yes, he is.
and when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear...
...that you have endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.
who's bothering you? -There's a girl at the DA's office.
we'll buy her off. -Not this one.
ldealist, huh?
well, there's an answer to that too.
l don't want to know. -Yes, you do.
no, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.
l don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture as a suitable cornerstone for our business.
well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.
l think after 20 years we can allow ourselves to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.
good morning, Mr. Earle's office.
Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.
good morning. l'm here to see Mr. Earle.
name?
Bruce Wayne.
thomas would probably not have taken the company public.
but that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.
Jessica?
Jessica? Where are you?
eye on the ball, and... -Why is no one answering the phone?
lt's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. l'm sure they'll call back.
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.
l'm sorry to disappoint.
l need you to take a look at this. -Have you seen him yet?
who? -Wayne.
lt's been all over the news. He's back.
l'm sure you realize l can't stop the big machine.
too many wheels turning.
we're going public. -l understand.
and l'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.
l'm not looking to interfere.
l am looking for a job. -Oh?
l just want to get to know the company that my family built.
any ideas where you would start?
applied Sciences caught my eye.
fox's department.
l'll let him know you're coming.
you look like him. Your dad.
you're the only one left of the Wayne family.
this is where you belong. Welcome home.
environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.
all prototypes. None in production.
on any level whatsoever. -None?
what did they tell you this place was?
they didn't tell me anything.
earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.
dead end.
place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.
come on.
you were on the board? -When your father ran things.
you knew my father? -Oh, yeah.
helped him build his train.
here we are.
Kevlar utility harness.
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.
the 350-pound test monofilament.
wonderful project, your dad's train.
routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.
kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.
of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are.
nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.
Tear-resistant? -This sucker will stop a knife.
bulletproof? -Anything but a straight shot.
why didn't they put it into production? -Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.
so, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?
l want to borrow it.
for spelunking.
spelunking?
Yeah, you know, cave diving?
you expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?
look, l'd rather Mr. Earle didn't know about me borrowing
Mr. Wayne...
...the way l see it...
...all this stuff is yours anyway.
okay. Give it a try.
charming.
at least you'll have company.
this must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing.
ln the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad...
...secretly transporting freed slaves to the North...
...and l suspect these caverns came in handy.
Alfred! Come up here!
l can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you.
we order the main part of this cowl from Singapore.
via a dummy corporation.
lndeed. And then, quite separately...
...we place an order to a Chinese company for these.
put it together ourselves. -Precisely.
they'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.
how large? -Say 1 0, 000.
well, at least we'll have spares. -Yes.
don't suppose you want a taste.
l just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.
there's nothing wise in what you do, Flass.
well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous.
l'm no rat.
ln a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?
don't turn around.
you're a good cop. One of the few.
what do you want?
Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.
nobody takes him down. Why?
he's paid up with the right people.
what will it take to bring him down?
leverage on Judge Faden...
...and a DA brave enough to prosecute.
Rachel Dawes.
who are you?
watch for my sign.
you're just one man?
now we're two.
we?
Freeze!
what the hell was that?
just some nut.
well, what is it today? More spelunking?
no. Today it's BASE-jumping.
BASE-jumping.
that like parachuting? -Kind of.
do you have any lightweight fabrics?
you know, l think l have just the thing.
lt's called memory cloth. Notice anything?
regularly flexible...
...but put a current through it...
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid. -What kind of shapes can you make?
can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.
too expensive for the Army?
l don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd.
look, Mr. Fox. -Yes, sir?
lf you're uncomfortable
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing...
...when l'm asked, l don't have to lie.
but don't think of me as an idiot.
fair enough.
what's that?
the Tumbler?
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.
she was built as a bridging vehicle.
during combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.
over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up. This will boost you into a rampless jump-- Not now!
not-- Not now, sir.
afterburner disengaged.
we never could get the damn bridge to work...
...but this baby works just fine.
so, what do you think?
does it come in black?
I need you at the docks Thursday.
problems? -l don't want any trouble with the last shipment. -Sure.
word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.
ls that right? -And that there's a fat prize waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.
so, what's your point, Mr. Flass?
have you seen the girl?
it's a cute little assistant DA.
don't you think that's a little bit too much heat to bring down, maybe?
even for this town. -Never underestimate Gotham City.
people get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.
sometimes-- Sometimes things just go bad.
lt's a problem with the graphite, sir.
the next 1 0, 000 will be up to specifications.
at least they gave us a discount. -Quite.
ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?
why bats, Master Wayne?
bats frighten me.
lt's time my enemies shared my dread.
what is this?
continue.
looks fine out there.
the bears go straight to the dealers.
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.
what's the difference? -lgnorance is bliss, my friend.
don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people.
Hey. Steiss.
Steiss?
what?
what the...?
l better check it.
there's a problem out here. You better bail.
where are you?!
here.
get going. Oh, shit.
what the hell are you?
l'm Batman.
nice coat.
Thanks.
hold it.
that's right, you better run.
Falcone sent them to kill you.
Why? -You rattled his cage.
what's this? -Leverage.
for what? -To get things moving.
who are you?
someone like you.
someone who'll rattle the cages.
ma'am? Everything okay?
Falcone's men? -Does it matter?
we'll never tie him to it anyway.
l wouldn't be too sure of that.
what the hell is that?
cut him down.
unacceptable.
now, l don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels...
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...
...get them off the street and off the front page.
they say it was just one guy. Or a creature.
lt was some asshole in a costume.
yeah? -This guy did deliver us...
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.
no one takes the law into their own hands in my city.
understand?
no way to bury it now. -There's still Judge Faden.
l've got Faden covered. -What about this bat they're babbling about?
even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...
...we've got Falcone at the scene.
drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.
okay. Let's do it.
bats are nocturnal. -Bats may be.
but even for billionaire playboys, 3: 00 is pushing it.
the price for leading a double life, l fear.
your theatrics made an impression.
theatricality and deception...
...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.
lf those are to be the first of many injuries to come...
...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.
polo, for instance.
l'm not learning polo, Alfred.
strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.
these things beg the question...
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.
what does someone like me do?
drive sports cars, date movie stars.
buy things that are not for sale.
who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun...
...you might even have a little by accident.
sir.
we have a situation. -All right.
the Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night...
...heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.
the ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter.
lt's designed for desert warfare, but it
lt looks like somebody...
...turned it on.
lt uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.
the damage to the ship was catastrophic.
the weapon itself is...
missing?
Yeah.
Mr. Wayne.
nice car.
you should see my other one.
he's done something the police never have.
you can't take the law into your own hands.
well, at least he's getting something done.
Bruce, help me out here.
well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.
but he's put Falcone behind bars.
now the cops want to bring him in. What does that tell you?
they're jealous.
sir, the pool is for decoration...
...and your friends do not have swimwear.
well, they're European.
l'm going to have to ask you to leave.
lt is not a question of money.
well, you see...
...l'm buying this hotel...
...and setting some new rules about the pool area.
l think the Batman deserves a medal.
and a straitjacket to pin it on.
thank you.
Bruce?
Rachel?
l'd heard you were back.
what are you doing?
just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you.
you were gone a long time.
l know. How are things? -The same.
job's getting worse.
can't change the world on your own.
what choice do l have...
...when you're too busy swimming?
Rachel, all of
all this...
lt's-- lt's not me. lt's...
lnside, l am...
l am more.
come on, Bruce. Come on.
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.
Bruce...
...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.
but it's not who you are underneath...
...It's what you do that defines you.
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.
not at all. He cut his wrists?
probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen...
of course, better safe than sorry.
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore. lt's all too much.
the walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.
a couple of days of this food, it'll be true.
what do you want? -l wanna know...
...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.
about what? You don't know anything.
l know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.
and l know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.
see, l don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.
and those goons you used.
l own the muscle in this town.
now, l've been bringing your stuff in for months...
...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and l want in.
well, l already know what he'll say.
that we should kill you.
even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.
would you like to see my mask?
l use it in my experiments.
now, l'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.
but these crazies, they can't stand it.
so when did the nut take over the nut house?
they scream and they cry much as you're doing now.
well, he's not faking. Not that one.
l'll talk to the judge and see if l can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham. l can't treat him here.
storm's coming.
the scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.
lt's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.
well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.
they were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.
Why? What about the other half?
flass knows. -He won't talk.
he'll talk to me.
commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.
he thinks you're dangerous. -What do you think?
l think you're trying to help.
but l've been wrong before.
come on, l ain't got all night.
Flass, l have kids to feed.
what, they don't like falafel?
where were the other drugs going?
l never knew. l don't know.
l swear to God. -Swear to me!
l don't-- l don't know. l never knew. Never.
they went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.
Why?
there was something-- Something else in the drugs...
...something hidden. -What?
l never went to the drop-off point. lt was in the Narrows.
cops only go there when they're in force. -Do l look like a cop?
no
this is the one l'm talking about.
what's your problem with it? -lt shouldn't exist.
this ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.
l'm guessing there's something l'm not supposed to find in there.
listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.
things are working a little differently now. Open it up.
what the hell is this?
lt's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you.
get in here!
the other kids won't believe me.
get rid of all traces.
better torch the whole place. -All right.
having trouble?
take a seat. Have a drink.
you look like a man who takes himself too seriously.
do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.
Alfred, help me.
blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.
poisonous. Poisonous.
Bruce...
...why do we fall?
how long was l out? -Two days.
lt's your birthday.
many happy returns.
l've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.
lt was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.
you have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.
l called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.
l analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.
am l meant to understand any of that?
not at all. l just wanted you to know how hard it was.
bottom line, l synthesized an antidote. -Could you make more?
you planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?
well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...
...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens...
l'll bring what l have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.
Alfred, always a pleasure.
Lucius.
you sure you don't want to come in? -l have to get back. l wanted to leave this. -Thank you.
Rachel?
looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.
must've been quite an occasion. -lt is my birthday.
l know. l'm sorry l can't come tonight. l was just dropping off your present.
you've got better plans? -My boss has been missing for two days...
...which means l should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river.
Rachel. -Excuse me.
Rachel Dawes.
who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer.
call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment on the judge's desk by morning.
what's wrong? -lt's Falcone.
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.
you're going to Arkham now? lt's in the Narrows, Rachel.
you enjoy your party, Bruce.
some of us have work to do. -You be careful.
happy birthday.
but, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.
keep them happy until l arrive.
tell them that joke you know.
having fun?
bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?
l need some information.
the Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.
1 -ME.
lt's a microwave emitter. lt was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.
rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air...
...but isn't that illegal?
l want all the information on the development of this project...
...all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.
did you lose one?
l'm merging your department with Archives.
and l am firing you.
didn't you get the memo?
scarecrow.
scarecrow.
scarecrow.
miss Dawes, this is most irregular.
l have nothing to add to the report l filed with the judge.
l have questions about your report. -Such as?
lsn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness...
...to suddenly have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?
well, as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.
scarecrow. -What's " scarecrow " ?
patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia on an external tormentor...
...usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.
ln this case, a scarecrow.
he's drugged? -Psychopharmacology is my primary field.
I'm a strong advocate.
outside, he was a giant.
ln here, only the mind can grant you power.
you enjoy the reversal.
l respect the mind's power over the body.
lt's why l do what l do.
l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.
l want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone...
...including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on.
first thing tomorrow, then. -Tonight.
l've already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General.
as you wish.
this way, please.
there's something l think you should see.
this is where we make the medicine.
perhaps you should have some, clear your head.
who knows you're here?
who knows?
he's here.
who?
the Batman.
what do we do? -What anyone does when a prowler comes around.
call the police. -You want the cops here?
at this point, they can't stop us.
but the Batman has a talent for disruption.
force him outside, the police will take him down. Go.
what about her? -She hasn't got long.
l gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go.
the things they say about him.
can he really fly?
l heard he can disappear.
well, we'll find out.
won't we?
taste of your own medicine, doctor?
what have you been doing here?
who are you working for?
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for?
crane.
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.
but if you'd like to make an appointment...
batman, put down your weapons and surrender.
you're surrounded.
what are you waiting for? -Backup.
backup? -The Batman's in there.
SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now...
...l'll be right behind you, sir.
SWAT's on the way.
Hey. -Hey.
what's happened to her?
crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.
let me get her down to the medics. -They can't help her, but l can.
get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley.
crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs...
...and they're dumping it into the water supply.
what was he planning? -l don't know.
was he working for Falcone?
he mentioned someone else, someone worse.
she needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.
how long does she have? -Not long.
what is that?
backup. -What the--?
excuse me.
how is she? -She's fading. We gotta go.
l'll get my car.
l brought mine.
yours?
l've gotta get me one of those.
he is in a vehicle. -Make and color?
lt's a black...
...tank.
stay calm.
you've been poisoned.
l'm on him.
breathe slowly.
hold on.
what are you doing? -Shortcut.
air One to ground, block that ramp.
he's got no way off that roof.
turn off your engine. Step away from the car.
trust me. -Weapons system activated.
who is this guy?
Where's he going? -He's on the roof.
what street is he taking? -He's not on a street.
he's flying on rooftops.
at least tell me what it looks like.
never mind.
got him.
coming right up on his butt.
we're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I- 1 7.
air One to ground. -l lost him.
we've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.
we'll loop back to check the frontage road.
stealth mode activated.
stay with me.
what--? There he is.
just hold on.
Rachel!
they get any of this crap into the mains? -Yeah.
notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it.
no. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.
Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.
why haven't we felt the effects?
must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.
how do you feel?
where are we?
why did you bring me here? -lf l hadn't, your mind would now be lost.
you were poisoned. -lt was
lt was Dr. Crane. -Rest. Gordon has Crane.
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?
l don't have the luxury of friends.
l'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home.
when you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one.
what are they? -The antidote.
one for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.
mass production?
crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready.
when you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham...
...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats...
...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking.
lt's not. -What would you call that?
damn good television. -lt's a miracle no one was killed.
l didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.
you're getting lost inside this monster of yours.
l'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did.
for Thomas Wayne, helping others...
...wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.
she's downstairs, sedated. l need you to take her home.
well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.
lt can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.
ls Fox still here? -Yes, sir.
we need to send these people away.
those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain.
l don't care about my name.
lt's not just your name, sir. lt's your father's name.
and it's all that's left of him.
don't destroy it.
Mr. Earle. -Happy birthday, Bruce.
thank you.
how did the stock offering go?
prices soared.
who was buying?
all kinds of funds and brokerages.
lt's a bit technical.
the key thing is...
...our company's future is secure. Great.
a little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.
what was the plan, Crane?
how were you gonna get your toxin into the air?
scarecrow. Scarecrow.
who were you working for, Crane?
Oh, it's too late.
you can't stop it now.
here.
happy birthday, Bruce. -Thank you. Thanks.
and thank you for that item.
you're welcome.
l know you'll put it to good use. -l already have.
how long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?
weeks. Why?
somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.
the water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.
what?
unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...
...to vaporize all the water in the mains.
a microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.
misplaced?
earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.
go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.
the police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.
my security clearance has been revoked.
that wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?
l suppose not.
Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. -Not now, Mrs. Delane.
now, am l pronouncing this right...
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?
you're not Ra's al Ghul.
l watched him die.
but is Ra's al Ghul immortal?
are his methods supernatural?
or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?
surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.
l saved your life.
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.
your quarrel is with me.
you let these people go.
you are welcome to explain the situation to them.
everyone.
everybody?
l...
l want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.
no, really.
there's a thing about being a Wayne...
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.
that's enough, Bruce. -l'm not finished.
to all of you...
all of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...
...please, leave me in peace.
please go.
stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.
the party's over, get out.
the apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.
he's turning into a jerk.
amusing.
but pointless. None of these people have long to live.
your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.
so Crane was working for you.
his toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.
he was able to weaponize it.
he's not a member of the League of Shadows?
of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.
but really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.
then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.
you're gonna destroy millions of lives.
only a cynical man would call what these people have " lives, " Wayne.
crime. Despair.
this is not how man was supposed to live.
the League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.
we sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.
burned London to the ground.
every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...
...we return to restore the balance.
Gotham isn't beyond saving.
give me more time. There are good people here.
you are defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.
time to play.
when l found you in that jail, you were lost.
but l believed in you.
l took away your fear, and l showed you a path.
you were my greatest student.
lt should be you standing by my side, saving the world.
l'll be standing where l belong.
between you and the people of Gotham.
no one can save Gotham.
when a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.
tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.
the movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.
you attacked Gotham before? -Of course.
over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.
with Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.
but we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens such as your parents.
gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.
create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.
their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.
we are back to finish the job.
and this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.
like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.
lf someone stands in the way of true justice...
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.
l am gonna stop you. -You never did learn...
...to mind your surroundings.
justice is balance.
you burned my house and left me for dead.
consider us even.
no one comes out. Make sure.
they're all gone?
how many from maximum security? -Every one of them.
serial killers, rapists.
raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...
...when l get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs...
...that are running loose out there. -Come on!
l hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
master Wayne! Master Wayne!
what is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?
what have l done, Alfred?
everything my family...
...my father, built...
the Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.
l wanted to save Gotham.
l failed.
why do we fall, sir?
so that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
you still haven't given up on me?
never.
down!
harassment! l see harassment!
maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?
madman with a gun.
with residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength...
...to round up the inmates...
we're about to raise these bridges.
officer, l am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.
just shut up! -Hey, Flass, cool it!
hold these people back.
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.
what are you doing here? -Our friend sent me with this.
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.
hopefully you won't need it.
not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.
all right, last one across.
come on, people, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!
better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman!
go!
l can't find my mom.
Hey!
what the hell are you doing?
gentlemen...
...time to spread the word.
and the word is...
...panic.
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.
right there.
that water main is right under the Narrows.
lt's okay.
this is Commissioner Loeb.
come on, somebody talk to me.
come on!
loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.
what the hell is going on?
we need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!
Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you!
well, they're completely incapacitated!
lt's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.
of course they are!
Crane? -No. Scarecrow.
Gordon...
...there's nobody left to send in.
so l'm on my own?
the Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.
this is just the beginning. lf they hit the whole city...
...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart.
how are they gonna do that? -The train.
the monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.
if the machine gets to the station...
...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply.
covering Gotham in this poison.
l'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but l may need your help.
what do you need? -Can you drive stick?
there you are!
there is nothing to fear but fear itself!
l am here to help!
Batman will save us. He'll come.
he'll come. -Don't peek.
this is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge.
l told you he'd come.
wait.
you could die.
at least tell me your name.
lt's not who l am underneath...
...but what l do that defines me.
Bruce?
well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.
lt ends here. -For you and the police, maybe.
my fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.
now, if you'll excuse me, l have a city to destroy.
l can't beat two of your pawns? -As you wish.
GPS online.
in 1 00 yards.
gentlemen.
who the hell authorized this?
distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.
the pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.
lf that pressure reaches us...
...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!
at the next intersection, turn right.
you will never learn.
sorry.
familiar. Don't you have anything new? -How about this?!
you have arrived at Wayne Tower.
evacuate the building.
we're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.
weapons system activated.
nice ride.
armed.
don't be afraid, Bruce.
come on. Come on.
you are just an ordinary man in a cape.
that's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.
who said anything about stopping it?
Yes!
you never learned to mind your surroundings!
have you finally learned to do what is necessary?
l won't kill you...
...but l don't have to save you.
the meeting's already started. -What meeting?
fox, l seem to remember firing you.
you did.
l got another job.
yours.
on whose authority?
Batman may have made the front page...
...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.
Bruce Wayne.
what makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?
the fact that l'm the owner. -What are you talking about?
the company went public a week ago.
and l bought most of the shares.Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.
look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...
...is that my company's future is secure.
right, Mr. Fox?
right you are, Mr. Wayne.
didn't you get the memo?
l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel. -No. No, Bruce...
...l'm sorry.
the day that Chill died, l...
l said terrible things.
but true things.
l was a coward with a gun...
...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.
l never stopped thinking about you.
about us.
and when l heard you were back, l...
l started to hope.
but then l found out about your mask.
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.
no. This...
...is your mask.
your real face is the one that criminals now fear.
the man l loved...
...the man who vanished...
...he never came back at all.
but maybe he's still out there somewhere.
maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...
...l'll see him again.
proved me wrong, you know. -About what?
your father would be very proud of you.
just like me.
what will you do?
rebuild it.
just the way it was, brick for brick.
just the way it was, sir?
Yeah, why?
l thought this might be a good opportunity for...
...improving the foundations.
ln the southeast corner? -Precisely, sir.
nice. -l couldn't find any mob bosses.
well, sergeant? -lt's " lieutenant " now.
you really started something.
bent cops running scared.
hope on the streets.
But? -The Narrows is lost.
and we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.
we will.
we can bring Gotham back.
what about escalation? -Escalation?
we start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.
we start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.
And? -And you're wearing a mask...
...and jumping off rooftops.
now, take this guy.
armed robbery, double homicide.
got a taste for the theatrical, like you.
leaves a calling card.
l'll look into it.
l never said thank you.
and you'll never have to.
Rachel?
l'd heard you were back.
what are you doing?
just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you.
you were gone a long time.
l know. How are things? - The same.
job's getting worse.
can't change the world on your own.
what choice do l have...
...when you're too busy swimming?
Rachel, all of...all this...
lt's-- lt's not me. lt's...
lnside, l am...l am more.
come on, Bruce. Come on.
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.
Bruce,deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.
but it's not who you are underneath,it's what you do that defines you.
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.
not at all. He cut his wrists?
probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen...
of course, better safe than sorry.
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore. lt's all too much.
the walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.
a couple of days of this food, it'll be true.
what do you want? - l wanna know...
...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.
about what? You don't know anything.
l know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.
and l know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.
see, l don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.
and those goons you used.
l own the muscle in this town.
now, l've been bringing your stuff in for months...
...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and l want in.
well, l already know what he'll say.
that we should kill you.
even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.
would you like to see my mask?
l use it in my experiments.
now, l'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.
but these crazies, they can't stand it.
so when did the nut take over the nut house?
they scream and they cry much as you're doing now.
well, he's not faking. Not that one.
l'll talk to the judge and see if l can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham. l can't treat him here.
storm's coming.
the scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.
lt's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.
well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.
they were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.
Why? What about the other half?
flass knows. - He won't talk.
he'll talk to me.
commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.
he thinks you're dangerous. - What do you think?
l think you're trying to help.
but l've been wrong before.
come on, l ain't got all night.
Flass, l have kids to feed.
what, they don't like falafel?
where were the other drugs going?
l never knew. l don't know.
l swear to God. - Swear to me!
l don't-- l don't know. l never knew. Never.
they went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.
Why?
there was something-- Something else in the drugs...
...something hidden. - What?
l never went to the drop- off point. lt was in the Narrows.
cops only go there when they're in force. - Do l look like a cop?
no
this is the one l'm talking about.
what's your problem with it? - lt shouldn't exist.
this ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.
l'm guessing there's something l'm not supposed to find in there.
listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.
things are working a little differently now. Open it up.
what the hell is this?
lt's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you.
get in here!
the other kids won't believe me.
get rid of all traces.
better torch the whole place. - All right.
having trouble?
take a seat. Have a drink.
you look like a man who takes himself too seriously.
do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.
Alfred, help me.
blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.
poisonous. Poisonous.
Bruce...
...why do we fall?
how long was l out? - Two days.
lt's your birthday.
many happy returns.
l've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.
lt was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.
you have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.
l called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.
l analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.
am l meant to understand any of that?
not at all. l just wanted you to know how hard it was.
bottom line, l synthesized an antidote. - Could you make more?
you planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?
well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...
...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens...
l'll bring what l have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.
Alfred, always a pleasure.
Lucius.
you sure you don't want to come in? - l have to get back.
l wanted to leave this. - Thank you.
Rachel?
looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.
must've been quite an occasion. - lt is my birthday.
l know. l'm sorry l can't come tonight. l was just dropping off your present.
you've got better plans? - My boss has been missing for two days...
...which means l should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river.
Rachel. - Excuse me.
Rachel Dawes.
who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer.
call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment on the judge's desk by morning.
what's wrong? - lt's Falcone.
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.
you're going to Arkham now? lt's in the Narrows, Rachel.
you enjoy your party, Bruce.
some of us have work to do. - You be careful.
happy birthday.
but, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.
keep them happy until l arrive.
tell them that joke you know.
having fun?
bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?
l need some information.
the Wayne Enterprise 47- B, 1- ME.
1- ME.
lt's a microwave emitter. lt was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.
rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air...
...but isn't that illegal?
l want all the information on the development of this project...
...all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.
did you lose one?
l'm merging your department with Archives.
and l am firing you.
didn't you get the memo?
scarecrow.
scarecrow.
scarecrow.
miss Dawes, this is most irregular.
l have nothing to add to the report l filed with the judge.
l have questions about your report. - Such as?
lsn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness to suddenly have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?
well, as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.
scarecrow. - What's " scarecrow " ?
patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia...
...on an external tormentor...
...usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.
ln this case, a scarecrow.
he's drugged? - Psychopharmacology is my primary field.
I'm a strong advocate.
outside, he was a giant.
ln here, only the mind can grant you power.
you enjoy the reversal.
l respect the mind's power over the body.
lt's why l do what l do.
l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.
l want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone...
...including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on.
first thing tomorrow, then. - Tonight.
l've already paged Dr. Lehmann at Country General.
as you wish.
this way, please.
there's something l think you should see.
this is where we make the medicine.
perhaps you should have some, clear your head.
who knows you're here?
who knows?
he's here.
who?
the Batman.
what do we do? - What anyone does...
...when a prowler comes around.
call the police. - You want the cops here?
at this point, they can't stop us.
but the Batman has a talent for disruption.
force him outside, the police will take him down. Go.
what about her? - She hasn't got long.
l gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go.
the things they say about him.
can he really fly?
l heard he can disappear.
well, we'll find out.
won't we?
taste of your own medicine, doctor?
what have you been doing here?
who are you working for?
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for?
crane.
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.
but if you'd like to make an appointment...
batman, put down your weapons and surrender.
you're surrounded.
what are you waiting for? - Backup.
backup? - The Batman's in there.
SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now, l'll be right behind you, sir.
SWAT's on the way.
Hey. - Hey.
what's happened to her?
crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic- inducing toxin.
let me get her down to the medics. - They can't help her, but l can.
get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley.
crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs...
...and they're dumping it into the water supply.
what was he planning? - l don't know.
was he working for Falcone?
he mentioned someone else, someone worse.
she needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.
how long does she have? - Not long.
what is that?
backup. - What the-- ?
excuse me.
how is she? - She's fading. We gotta go.
l'll get my car.
l brought mine.
yours?
l've gotta get me one of those.
he is in a vehicle. - Make and color?
lt's a black...
...tank.
stay calm.
you've been poisoned.
l'm on him.
breathe slowly.
hold on.
what are you doing? - Shortcut.
air One to ground, block that ramp.
he's got no way off that roof.
turn off your engine. Step away from the car.
trust me. - Weapons system activated.
who is this guy?
Where's he going? - He's on the roof.
what street is he taking? - He's not on a street.
he's flying on rooftops.
at least tell me what it looks like.
never mind.
got him.
coming right up on his butt.
we're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I - 17.
air One to ground. - l lost him.
we've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.
we'll loop back to check the frontage road.
stealth mode activated.
stay with me.
what-- ? there he is.
just hold on.
Rachel!
they get any of this crap into the mains? - Yeah.
notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it.
no. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.
Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.
why haven't we felt the effects?
must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.
how do you feel?
where are we?
why did you bring me here? - lf l hadn't, your mind would now be lost.
you were poisoned. - lt was
lt was Dr. Crane. - Rest. Gordon has Crane.
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?
l don't have the luxury of friends.
l'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home.
when you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one.
what are they? - The antidote.
one for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.
mass production?
crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready.
when you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham...
...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats...
...was when you said it wasn't about thrill- seeking.
lt's not. - What would you call that?
damn good television. - lt's a miracle no one was killed.
l didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.
you're getting lost inside this monster of yours.
l'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did.
for Thomas Wayne, helping others wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.
she's downstairs, sedated. l need you to take her home.
well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.
lt can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.
ls Fox still here? - Yes, sir.
we need to send these people away.
those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain.
l don't care about my name.
lt's not just your name, sir. lt's your father's name.
and it's all that's left of him.
don't destroy it.
Mr. Earle. - Happy birthday, Bruce.
thank you.
how did the stock offering go?
prices soared.
who was buying?
all kinds of funds and brokerages.
lt's a bit technical.
the key thing is our company's future is secure. Great.
what was the plan, Crane?
how were you gonna get your toxin into the air?
scarecrow. Scarecrow.
who were you working for, Crane?
Oh, it's too late.
you can't stop it now.
here.
happy birthday, Bruce. - Thank you. Thanks.
and thank you for that item.
you're welcome.
l know you'll put it to good use. - l already have.
how long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?
weeks. Why?
somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.
the water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.
what?
unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough to vaporize all the water in the mains.
a microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.
misplaced?
earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.
go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.
the police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.
my security clearance has been revoked.
that wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?
l suppose not.
Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. - Not now, Mrs. Delane.
now, am l pronouncing this right...
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?
you're not Ra's al Ghul.
l watched him die.
but is Ra's al Ghul immortal?
are his methods supernatural?
or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?
surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.
l saved your life.
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.
your quarrel is with me.
you let these people go.
you are welcome to explain the situation to them.
everyone.
everybody?
l...
l want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.
no, really.
there's a thing about being a Wayne...
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.
that's enough, Bruce. - l'm not finished.
to all of you...
all of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...
...please, leave me in peace.
please go.
stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.
the party's over, get out.
he's turning into a jerk.
amusing.
but pointless. None of these people have long to live.
your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.
so Crane was working for you.
his toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.
he was able to weaponize it.
he's not a member of the League of Shadows?
of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.
but really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.
then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.
you're gonna destroy millions of lives.
only a cynical man would call what these people have " lives, " Wayne.
crime. Despair.
this is not how man was supposed to live.
the League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.
we sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.
burned London to the ground.
every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...
...we return to restore the balance.
Gotham isn't beyond saving.
give me more time. There are good people here.
you are defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.
time to play.
when l found you in that jail, you were lost.
but l believed in you.
l took away your fear, and l showed you a path.
you were my greatest student.
lt should be you standing by my side, saving the world.
l'll be standing where l belong.
between you and the people of Gotham.
no one can save Gotham.
when a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.
tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.
the movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.
you attacked Gotham before? - Of course.
over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.
with Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.
but we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens such as your parents.
gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.
create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.
their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.
we are back to finish the job.
and this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.
like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.
lf someone stands in the way of true justice...
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.
l am gonna stop you. - You never did learn...
...to mind your surroundings.
justice is balance.
you burned my house and left me for dead.
consider us even.
no one comes out. Make sure.
they're all gone?
how many from maximum security? - Every one of them.
serial killers, rapists.
raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...
...when l get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs...
...that are running loose out there. - Come on!
l hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
master Wayne! Master Wayne!
what is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?
what have l done, Alfred?
everything my family...
...my father, built...
the Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.
l wanted to save Gotham.
l failed.
why do we fall, sir?
so that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
you still haven't given up on me?
never.
down!
harassment! l see harassment!
maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?
madman with a gun.
with residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength to round up the inmates...
we're about to raise these bridges.
officer, l am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.
just shut up! - Hey, Flass, cool it!
hold these people back.
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.
what are you doing here? - Our friend sent me with this.
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.
hopefully you won't need it.
not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.
all right, last one across.
come on, people, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!
better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman!
go!
l can't find my mom.
Hey!
what the hell are you doing?
gentlemen...
...time to spread the word.
and the world is panic.
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.
right there.
that water main is right under the Narrows.
lt's okay.
this is Commissioner Loeb.
come on, somebody talk to me.
come on!
loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.
what the hell is going on?
we need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!
Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you!
well, they're completely incapacitated!
lt's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.
of course they are!
Crane? -No. Scarecrow.
Gordon...
...there's nobody left to send in.
so l'm on my own?
the Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.
this is just the beginning. lf they hit the whole city...
...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart.
how are they gonna do that? - The train.
the monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.
if the machine gets to the station...
...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply.
covering Gotham in this poison.
l'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but l may need your help.
what do you need? - Can you drive stick?
there you are!
there is nothing to fear...
...but fear itself!
l am here to help!
Batman will save us. He'll come.
he'll come. - Don't peek.
this is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge.
l told you he'd come.
wait.
you could die.
at least tell me your name.
lt's not who l am underneath...
...but what l do that defines me.
Bruce?
well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.
lt ends here. - For you and the police, maybe.
my fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.
now, if you'll excuse me, l have a city to destroy.
l can't beat two of your pawns? - As you wish.
GPS online.
in 100 yards.
gentlemen.
who the hell authorized this?
distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.
the pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.
lf that pressure reaches us...
...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!
at the next intersection, turn right.
you will never learn.
sorry.
familiar. Don't you have anything new? - How about this? !
you have arrived at Wayne Tower.
evacuate the building.
we're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.
weapons system activated.
nice ride.
armed.
don't be afraid, Bruce.
come on. Come on.
you are just an ordinary man in a cape.
that's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.
who said anything about stopping it?
Yes!
you never learned to mind your surroundings!
have you finally learned to do what is necessary?
l won't kill you...
...but l don't have to save you.
the meeting's already started. - What meeting?
fox, l seem to remember firing you.
you did.
l got another job.
yours.
on whose authority?
Batman may have made the front page...
...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.
Bruce Wayne.
what makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?
the fact that l'm the owner. - What are you talking about?
the company went public a week ago.
and l bought most of the shares through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.
look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...
...is that my company's future is secure.
right, Mr. Fox?
right you are, Mr. Wayne.
didn't you get the memo?
l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel. - No. No, Bruce...
...l'm sorry.
the day that Chill died, l...
l said terrible things.
but true things.
l was a coward with a gun...
...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.
l never stopped thinking about you.
about us.
and when l heard you were back, l...
l started to hope.
but then l found out about your mask.
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.
no. This is your mask.
your real face is the one that criminals now fear.
the man l loved...
...the man who vanished...
...he never came back at all.
but maybe he's still out there somewhere.
maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...
...l'll see him again.
proved me wrong, you know. - About what?
your father would be very proud of you.
just like me.
what will you do?
rebuild it.
just the way it was, brick for brick.
just the way it was, sir?
Yeah, why?
l thought this might be a good opportunity for improving the foundations.
ln the southeast corner? - Precisely, sir.
nice. - l couldn't find any mob bosses.
well, sergeant? - lt's " lieutenant " now.
you really started something.
bent cops running scared.
hope on the streets.
But? - The Narrows is lost.
and we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.
we will.
we can bring Gotham back.
what about escalation? - Escalation?
we start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.
we start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.
And? - And you're wearing a mask...
...and jumping off rooftops.
now, take this guy.
armed robbery, double homicide.
got a taste for the theatrical, like you.
leaves a calling card.
l'll look into it.
l never said thank you.
and you'll never have to.
focus.
concentrate.
master your senses.
you cannot leave any sign.
l haven't.
lmpressive.
we have purged your fear.
you are ready to lead these men.
you are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.
but first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.
no.
l'm no executioner.
your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.
that's why it's so important.
lt separates us from them.
you want to fight criminals. This man is a murderer.
this man should be tried. -By whom?
corrupt bureaucrats?
criminals mock society's laws.
you know this better than most.
you cannot lead these men...
...unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.
and where would l be leading these men?
Gotham.
as Gotham's favored son...
...you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.
how? -Gotham's time has come.
like Constantinople or Rome before it...
...the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.
lt is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.
this is the most important function of the League of Shadows.
lt is one we've performed for centuries.
Gotham...
...must be destroyed.
you can't believe in this.
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.
what he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.
l will go back to Gotham and l will fight men like this...
...but l will not become an executioner.
Bruce, please.
for your own sake, there is no turning back.
what are you doing? -What's necessary, my friend.
l will tell him you saved his life.
master Wayne, you've been gone a long time.
Yes, l have. -You look very fashionable.
apart from the mud.
are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?
as long as it takes.
l want to show the people...
...their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.
ln the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises combating poverty.
he believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.
did it?
ln a way.
their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.
people need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.
l can't do that as Bruce Wayne.
as a man...l'm flesh and blood, l can be ignored, destroyed.
but as a symbol...
as a symbol, l can be incorruptible.
l can be everlasting. -What symbol?
something elemental...
...something terrifying.
l assume that as you take on the underworld...
...this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals?
you're thinking about Rachel?
actually, sir, l was thinking of myself.
have you told anyone l'm coming back?
l couldn't figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.
dead? -You've been gone seven years.
you had me declared dead?
actually, it was Mr. Earle. He's taking the company public.
he wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.
those shares are worth quite a bit of money.
well, it's a good thing l left everything to you, then.
quite so, sir.
and you can borrow the Rolls, if you like. Just bring it back with a full tank.
ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...
...and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.
Dr. Crane. -Miss Dawes.
you think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn't belong in jail?
l would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would l?
this is the third of Falcone's thugs you've had declared insane...
...and moved into your asylum.
well, the work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.
or the corrupt.
Mr. Finch.
you should check with Miss Dawes here...
...just what implications your office has authorized her to make. lf any.
what are you doing? -What are you doing, Carl?
looking out for you.
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.
drop it. -How can you say that?
because as much as l care about getting Falcone, l care more about you.
that's sweet.
we've been through all that.
blessed bat again, sir.
they nest somewhere in the grounds.
no more favors. Someone is sniffing around.
Hey, l scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.
l'm bringing in the shipments.
we are paying you for that.
maybe money isn't as interesting to me as favors.
l am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.
but you know who l'm working for, and when he gets here
he-- He's coming to Gotham?
Yes, he is.
and when he gets here, he's not going to wanna hear...
...that you have endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of a little jail time.
who's bothering you? -There's a girl at the DA's office.
we'll buy her off. -Not this one.
ldealist, huh?
well, there's an answer to that too.
l don't want to know. -Yes, you do.
no, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.
l don't think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy-arms manufacture as a suitable cornerstone for our business.
well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.
l think after 20 years we can allow ourselves to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.
good morning, Mr. Earle's office.
Yes, he's confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.
good morning. l'm here to see Mr. Earle.
name?
Bruce Wayne.
thomas would probably not have taken the company public.
but that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.
Jessica?
Jessica? Where are you?
eye on the ball, and... -Why is no one answering the phone?
lt's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle. l'm sure they'll call back.
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.
l'm sorry to disappoint.
l need you to take a look at this. -Have you seen him yet?
who? -Wayne.
lt's been all over the news. He's back.
l'm sure you realize l can't stop the big machine.
too many wheels turning.
we're going public. -l understand.
and l'll be handsomely rewarded for my shares.
l'm not looking to interfere.
l am looking for a job. -Oh?
l just want to get to know the company that my family built.
any ideas where you would start?
applied Sciences caught my eye.
fox's department.
l'll let him know you're coming.
you look like him. Your dad.
you're the only one left of the Wayne family.
this is where you belong. Welcome home.
environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.
all prototypes. None in production.
on any level whatsoever. -None?
what did they tell you this place was?
they didn't tell me anything.
earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.
dead end.
place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.
come on.
you were on the board? -When your father ran things.
you knew my father? -Oh, yeah.
helped him build his train.
here we are.
Kevlar utility harness.
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.
the 350-pound test monofilament.
wonderful project, your dad's train.
routed it right into Wayne Tower, along with the water and power utilities.
kind of made Wayne Tower the unofficial center of Gotham City.
of course, Earle let it go to rot. Here we are.
nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.
Tear-resistant? -This sucker will stop a knife.
bulletproof? -Anything but a straight shot.
why didn't they put it into production? -Bean counters didn't think a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.
so, what's your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?
l want to borrow it.
for spelunking.
spelunking?
Yeah, you know, cave diving?
you expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?
look, l'd rather Mr. Earle didn't know about me borrowing
Mr. Wayne...
...the way l see it...
...all this stuff is yours anyway.
okay. Give it a try.
charming.
at least you'll have company.
this must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing.
ln the Civil War, your great-great-grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad...
...secretly transporting freed slaves to the North...
...and l suspect these caverns came in handy.
Alfred! Come up here!
l can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you.
we order the main part of this cowl from Singapore.
via a dummy corporation.
lndeed. And then, quite separately...
...we place an order to a Chinese company for these.
put it together ourselves. -Precisely.
they'll have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.
how large? -Say 1 0, 000.
well, at least we'll have spares. -Yes.
don't suppose you want a taste.
l just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.
there's nothing wise in what you do, Flass.
well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste, makes us guys nervous.
l'm no rat.
ln a town this bent, who's there to rat to anyway?
don't turn around.
you're a good cop. One of the few.
what do you want?
Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.
nobody takes him down. Why?
he's paid up with the right people.
what will it take to bring him down?
leverage on Judge Faden...
...and a DA brave enough to prosecute.
Rachel Dawes.
who are you?
watch for my sign.
you're just one man?
now we're two.
we?
Freeze!
what the hell was that?
just some nut.
well, what is it today? More spelunking?
no. Today it's BASE-jumping.
BASE-jumping.
that like parachuting? -Kind of.
do you have any lightweight fabrics?
you know, l think l have just the thing.
lt's called memory cloth. Notice anything?
regularly flexible...
...but put a current through it...
...molecules realign, it becomes rigid. -What kind of shapes can you make?
can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.
too expensive for the Army?
l don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd.
look, Mr. Fox. -Yes, sir?
lf you're uncomfortable
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing...
...when l'm asked, l don't have to lie.
but don't think of me as an idiot.
fair enough.
what's that?
the Tumbler?
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.
she was built as a bridging vehicle.
during combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.
over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up. This will boost you into a rampless jump-- Not now!
not-- Not now, sir.
afterburner disengaged.
we never could get the damn bridge to work...
...but this baby works just fine.
so, what do you think?
does it come in black?
I need you at the docks Thursday.
problems? -l don't want any trouble with the last shipment. -Sure.
word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA's office.
ls that right? -And that there's a fat prize waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.
so, what's your point, Mr. Flass?
have you seen the girl?
it's a cute little assistant DA.
don't you think that's a little bit too much heat to bring down, maybe?
even for this town. -Never underestimate Gotham City.
people get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.
sometimes-- Sometimes things just go bad.
lt's a problem with the graphite, sir.
the next 1 0, 000 will be up to specifications.
at least they gave us a discount. -Quite.
ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?
why bats, Master Wayne?
bats frighten me.
lt's time my enemies shared my dread.
what is this?
continue.
looks fine out there.
the bears go straight to the dealers.
Yeah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.
what's the difference? -lgnorance is bliss, my friend.
don't burden yourself with the secrets of scary people.
Hey. Steiss.
Steiss?
what?
what the...?
l better check it.
there's a problem out here. You better bail.
where are you?!
here.
get going. Oh, shit.
what the hell are you?
l'm Batman.
nice coat.
Thanks.
hold it.
that's right, you better run.
Falcone sent them to kill you.
Why? -You rattled his cage.
what's this? -Leverage.
for what? -To get things moving.
who are you?
someone like you.
someone who'll rattle the cages.
ma'am? Everything okay?
Falcone's men? -Does it matter?
we'll never tie him to it anyway.
l wouldn't be too sure of that.
what the hell is that?
cut him down.
unacceptable.
now, l don't care if it's rival gangs, Guardian Angels...
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...
...get them off the street and off the front page.
they say it was just one guy. Or a creature.
lt was some asshole in a costume.
yeah? -This guy did deliver us...
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.
no one takes the law into their own hands in my city.
understand?
no way to bury it now. -There's still Judge Faden.
l've got Faden covered. -What about this bat they're babbling about?
even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...
...we've got Falcone at the scene.
drugs, prints, cargo manifests. This bat character gave us everything.
okay. Let's do it.
bats are nocturnal. -Bats may be.
but even for billionaire playboys, 3: 00 is pushing it.
the price for leading a double life, l fear.
your theatrics made an impression.
theatricality and deception...
...are powerful weapons, Alfred. This is a good start.
lf those are to be the first of many injuries to come...
...it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.
polo, for instance.
l'm not learning polo, Alfred.
strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.
these things beg the question...
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.
what does someone like me do?
drive sports cars, date movie stars.
buy things that are not for sale.
who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun...
...you might even have a little by accident.
sir.
we have a situation. -All right.
the Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night...
...heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.
the ship was carrying a prototype weapon. It's a microwave emitter.
lt's designed for desert warfare, but it
lt looks like somebody...
...turned it on.
lt uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy's water supply.
the damage to the ship was catastrophic.
the weapon itself is...
missing?
Yeah.
Mr. Wayne.
nice car.
you should see my other one.
he's done something the police never have.
you can't take the law into your own hands.
well, at least he's getting something done.
Bruce, help me out here.
well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.
but he's put Falcone behind bars.
now the cops want to bring him in. What does that tell you?
they're jealous.
sir, the pool is for decoration...
...and your friends do not have swimwear.
well, they're European.
l'm going to have to ask you to leave.
lt is not a question of money.
well, you see...
...l'm buying this hotel...
...and setting some new rules about the pool area.
l think the Batman deserves a medal.
and a straitjacket to pin it on.
thank you.
Bruce?
Rachel?
l'd heard you were back.
what are you doing?
just swimming here. Wow, it is good to see you.
you were gone a long time.
l know. How are things? -The same.
job's getting worse.
can't change the world on your own.
what choice do l have...
...when you're too busy swimming?
Rachel, all of
all this...
lt's-- lt's not me. lt's...
lnside, l am...
l am more.
come on, Bruce. Come on.
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.
Bruce...
...deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.
but it's not who you are underneath...
...It's what you do that defines you.
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.
not at all. He cut his wrists?
probably looking for the insanity plea. But if anything should happen...
of course, better safe than sorry.
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore. lt's all too much.
the walls are closing in. Blah, blah, blah.
a couple of days of this food, it'll be true.
what do you want? -l wanna know...
...how you're gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.
about what? You don't know anything.
l know you don't want the cops to take a closer look at the drugs they seized.
and l know about your experiments with the inmates of your nut house.
see, l don't go into business with a guy without finding out his dirty secrets.
and those goons you used.
l own the muscle in this town.
now, l've been bringing your stuff in for months...
...so whatever he's planning, it's big, and l want in.
well, l already know what he'll say.
that we should kill you.
even he can't get me in here. Not in my town.
would you like to see my mask?
l use it in my experiments.
now, l'm probably not very frightening to a guy like you.
but these crazies, they can't stand it.
so when did the nut take over the nut house?
they scream and they cry much as you're doing now.
well, he's not faking. Not that one.
l'll talk to the judge and see if l can get him moved to the secure wing at Arkham. l can't treat him here.
storm's coming.
the scum is getting jumpy because you stood up to Falcone.
lt's a start. Your partner was at the docks with Falcone.
well, he moonlights as a low-level enforcer.
they were splitting the shipment in two. Only half went to the dealers.
Why? What about the other half?
flass knows. -He won't talk.
he'll talk to me.
commissioner Loeb set up a massive task force to catch you.
he thinks you're dangerous. -What do you think?
l think you're trying to help.
but l've been wrong before.
come on, l ain't got all night.
Flass, l have kids to feed.
what, they don't like falafel?
where were the other drugs going?
l never knew. l don't know.
l swear to God. -Swear to me!
l don't-- l don't know. l never knew. Never.
they went to some guy for a couple days before they went to the dealers.
Why?
there was something-- Something else in the drugs...
...something hidden. -What?
l never went to the drop-off point. lt was in the Narrows.
cops only go there when they're in force. -Do l look like a cop?
no
this is the one l'm talking about.
what's your problem with it? -lt shouldn't exist.
this ship left Singapore with 246 containers, but arrived with 247.
l'm guessing there's something l'm not supposed to find in there.
listen, counselor, we don't wanna know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.
things are working a little differently now. Open it up.
what the hell is this?
lt's you, isn't it? Everybody's been talking about you.
get in here!
the other kids won't believe me.
get rid of all traces.
better torch the whole place. -All right.
having trouble?
take a seat. Have a drink.
you look like a man who takes himself too seriously.
do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.
Alfred, help me.
blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.
poisonous. Poisonous.
Bruce...
...why do we fall?
how long was l out? -Two days.
lt's your birthday.
many happy returns.
l've felt these effects before, but this was so much more potent.
lt was some kind of hallucinogen, weaponized, in aerosol form.
you have been hanging out in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.
l called Mr. Fox when your condition worsened after the first day.
l analyzed your blood, isolating the receptor compounds and the protein-based catalyst.
am l meant to understand any of that?
not at all. l just wanted you to know how hard it was.
bottom line, l synthesized an antidote. -Could you make more?
you planning on gassing yourself again, Mr. Wayne?
well, you know how it is. You're out at night, looking for kicks...
...someone's passing around the weaponized hallucinogens...
l'll bring what l have. The antidote should inoculate you for now.
Alfred, always a pleasure.
Lucius.
you sure you don't want to come in? -l have to get back. l wanted to leave this. -Thank you.
Rachel?
looks like someone's been burning the candle at both ends.
must've been quite an occasion. -lt is my birthday.
l know. l'm sorry l can't come tonight. l was just dropping off your present.
you've got better plans? -My boss has been missing for two days...
...which means l should probably start by looking at the bottom of the river.
Rachel. -Excuse me.
Rachel Dawes.
who authorized that? Get Crane down there now. Don't take no for an answer.
call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our own assessment on the judge's desk by morning.
what's wrong? -lt's Falcone.
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.
you're going to Arkham now? lt's in the Narrows, Rachel.
you enjoy your party, Bruce.
some of us have work to do. -You be careful.
happy birthday.
but, Master Wayne, the guests will be arriving.
keep them happy until l arrive.
tell them that joke you know.
having fun?
bill? Now, what's a big shot like you doing in a place like this?
l need some information.
the Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1 -ME.
1 -ME.
lt's a microwave emitter. lt was designed to vaporize an enemy's water supply.
rumor was they tested dispersing water-based chemical agents into the air...
...but isn't that illegal?
l want all the information on the development of this project...
...all data, files, backup disks, on my desk right away.
did you lose one?
l'm merging your department with Archives.
and l am firing you.
didn't you get the memo?
scarecrow.
scarecrow.
scarecrow.
miss Dawes, this is most irregular.
l have nothing to add to the report l filed with the judge.
l have questions about your report. -Such as?
lsn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man who has no history of mental illness...
...to suddenly have a psychotic breakdown just when he's about to be indicted?
well, as you can see for yourself, there is nothing convenient about his symptoms.
scarecrow. -What's " scarecrow " ?
patients suffering delusional episodes often focus their paranoia on an external tormentor...
...usually one conforming to Jungian archetypes.
ln this case, a scarecrow.
he's drugged? -Psychopharmacology is my primary field.
I'm a strong advocate.
outside, he was a giant.
ln here, only the mind can grant you power.
you enjoy the reversal.
l respect the mind's power over the body.
lt's why l do what l do.
l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone behind bars, not in therapy.
l want my own psychiatric consultant to have full access to Falcone...
...including blood work. Find out what exactly you put him on.
first thing tomorrow, then. -Tonight.
l've already paged Dr. Lehmann at County General.
as you wish.
this way, please.
there's something l think you should see.
this is where we make the medicine.
perhaps you should have some, clear your head.
who knows you're here?
who knows?
he's here.
who?
the Batman.
what do we do? -What anyone does when a prowler comes around.
call the police. -You want the cops here?
at this point, they can't stop us.
but the Batman has a talent for disruption.
force him outside, the police will take him down. Go.
what about her? -She hasn't got long.
l gave her a concentrated dose. The mind can only take so much. Now go.
the things they say about him.
can he really fly?
l heard he can disappear.
well, we'll find out.
won't we?
taste of your own medicine, doctor?
what have you been doing here?
who are you working for?
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.
Ra's al Ghul is dead. Who are you working for?
crane.
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.
but if you'd like to make an appointment...
batman, put down your weapons and surrender.
you're surrounded.
what are you waiting for? -Backup.
backup? -The Batman's in there.
SWAT's on the way. But if you wanna go in now...
...l'll be right behind you, sir.
SWAT's on the way.
Hey. -Hey.
what's happened to her?
crane poisoned her with a psychotropic hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.
let me get her down to the medics. -They can't help her, but l can.
get her downstairs. Meet me in the alley.
crane's been smuggling his toxin hidden in Falcone's drugs...
...and they're dumping it into the water supply.
what was he planning? -l don't know.
was he working for Falcone?
he mentioned someone else, someone worse.
she needs the antidote before the damage is permanent.
how long does she have? -Not long.
what is that?
backup. -What the--?
excuse me.
how is she? -She's fading. We gotta go.
l'll get my car.
l brought mine.
yours?
l've gotta get me one of those.
he is in a vehicle. -Make and color?
lt's a black...
...tank.
stay calm.
you've been poisoned.
l'm on him.
breathe slowly.
hold on.
what are you doing? -Shortcut.
air One to ground, block that ramp.
he's got no way off that roof.
turn off your engine. Step away from the car.
trust me. -Weapons system activated.
who is this guy?
Where's he going? -He's on the roof.
what street is he taking? -He's not on a street.
he's flying on rooftops.
at least tell me what it looks like.
never mind.
got him.
coming right up on his butt.
we're tracking suspect vehicle heading west on I- 1 7.
air One to ground. -l lost him.
we've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.
we'll loop back to check the frontage road.
stealth mode activated.
stay with me.
what--? There he is.
just hold on.
Rachel!
they get any of this crap into the mains? -Yeah.
notify the water company. There's gotta be a way to isolate it.
no. They put it all in. They must've been at this for weeks.
Gotham's entire water supply is laced with it.
why haven't we felt the effects?
must be a compound that has to be absorbed through the lungs.
how do you feel?
where are we?
why did you bring me here? -lf l hadn't, your mind would now be lost.
you were poisoned. -lt was
lt was Dr. Crane. -Rest. Gordon has Crane.
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?
l don't have the luxury of friends.
l'm gonna give you a sedative. You'll wake up back at home.
when you do, get these to Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no one.
what are they? -The antidote.
one for Gordon to inoculate himself, the other for mass production.
mass production?
crane was just a pawn. We need to be ready.
when you told me your grand plan for saving Gotham...
...all that stopped me from calling the men in white coats...
...was when you said it wasn't about thrill-seeking.
lt's not. -What would you call that?
damn good television. -lt's a miracle no one was killed.
l didn't have time to observe the rules of the road, Alfred.
you're getting lost inside this monster of yours.
l'm using this monster to help other people, just like my father did.
for Thomas Wayne, helping others...
...wasn't about proving anything to anyone, including himself.
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.
she's downstairs, sedated. l need you to take her home.
well, we both care for Rachel, but what you're doing has to be beyond that.
lt can't be personal, or you're just a vigilante.
ls Fox still here? -Yes, sir.
we need to send these people away.
those are Bruce Wayne's guests. You have a name to maintain.
l don't care about my name.
lt's not just your name, sir. lt's your father's name.
and it's all that's left of him.
don't destroy it.
Mr. Earle. -Happy birthday, Bruce.
thank you.
how did the stock offering go?
prices soared.
who was buying?
all kinds of funds and brokerages.
lt's a bit technical.
the key thing is...
...our company's future is secure. Great.
a little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.
what was the plan, Crane?
how were you gonna get your toxin into the air?
scarecrow. Scarecrow.
who were you working for, Crane?
Oh, it's too late.
you can't stop it now.
here.
happy birthday, Bruce. -Thank you. Thanks.
and thank you for that item.
you're welcome.
l know you'll put it to good use. -l already have.
how long would it take to manufacture on a large scale?
weeks. Why?
somebody's planning to disperse the toxin using the water supply.
the water supply won't help you disperse an inhalant.
what?
unless you have a microwave emitter powerful enough...
...to vaporize all the water in the mains.
a microwave emitter like the one Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.
misplaced?
earle just fired me for asking too many questions about it.
go back to Wayne Enterprises now and start making more of that antidote.
the police are gonna need as much as they can get their hands on.
my security clearance has been revoked.
that wouldn't stop a man like you, would it?
l suppose not.
Bruce, there's somebody you must meet. -Not now, Mrs. Delane.
now, am l pronouncing this right...
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?
you're not Ra's al Ghul.
l watched him die.
but is Ra's al Ghul immortal?
are his methods supernatural?
or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?
surely a man who spends his nights scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.
l saved your life.
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.
your quarrel is with me.
you let these people go.
you are welcome to explain the situation to them.
everyone.
everybody?
l...
l want to thank you all for coming here tonight and drinking all of my booze.
no, really.
there's a thing about being a Wayne...
...that you're never short of a few freeloaders, like yourselves...
...to fill up your mansion with. So here's to you people. Thank you.
that's enough, Bruce. -l'm not finished.
to all of you...
all of you phonies, all of you two-faced friends...
...you sycophantic suck-ups who smile through your teeth at me...
...please, leave me in peace.
please go.
stop smiling, it's not a joke. Please leave.
the party's over, get out.
the apple has fallen very far from the tree, Mr. Wayne.
he's turning into a jerk.
amusing.
but pointless. None of these people have long to live.
your antics at the asylum have forced my hand.
so Crane was working for you.
his toxin is derived from the organic compound found in our blue flowers.
he was able to weaponize it.
he's not a member of the League of Shadows?
of course not. He thought our plan was to hold the city to ransom.
but really, you are gonna release Crane's poison on the entire city.
then watch Gotham tear itself apart through fear.
you're gonna destroy millions of lives.
only a cynical man would call what these people have " lives, " Wayne.
crime. Despair.
this is not how man was supposed to live.
the League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years.
we sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats.
burned London to the ground.
every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence...
...we return to restore the balance.
Gotham isn't beyond saving.
give me more time. There are good people here.
you are defending a city so corrupt we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure.
time to play.
when l found you in that jail, you were lost.
but l believed in you.
l took away your fear, and l showed you a path.
you were my greatest student.
lt should be you standing by my side, saving the world.
l'll be standing where l belong.
between you and the people of Gotham.
no one can save Gotham.
when a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.
tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself.
the movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.
you attacked Gotham before? -Of course.
over the ages our weapons have grown more sophisticated.
with Gotham we tried a new one. Economics.
but we underestimated certain of Gotham's citizens such as your parents.
gunned down by one of the very people they were trying to help.
create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal.
their deaths galvanized the city into saving itself...
...and Gotham has limped on ever since.
we are back to finish the job.
and this time no misguided idealists will get in the way.
like your father, you lack the courage to do all that is necessary.
lf someone stands in the way of true justice...
...you simply walk up behind them and stab them in the heart.
l am gonna stop you. -You never did learn...
...to mind your surroundings.
justice is balance.
you burned my house and left me for dead.
consider us even.
no one comes out. Make sure.
they're all gone?
how many from maximum security? -Every one of them.
serial killers, rapists.
raise the bridges. We don't want any getting off the island.
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...
...when l get every available unit out here to catch the homicidal maniacs...
...that are running loose out there. -Come on!
l hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
master Wayne! Master Wayne!
what is the point of all those pushups if you can't even lift a bloody log?
what have l done, Alfred?
everything my family...
...my father, built...
the Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar, sir.
l wanted to save Gotham.
l failed.
why do we fall, sir?
so that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
you still haven't given up on me?
never.
down!
harassment! l see harassment!
maybe you'd like to see some excessive force?
madman with a gun.
with residents furious at the unprecedented show of police strength...
...to round up the inmates...
we're about to raise these bridges.
officer, l am a Gotham City district attorney. Let me pass.
just shut up! -Hey, Flass, cool it!
hold these people back.
Hey, Gordon. Somebody here to see you.
what are you doing here? -Our friend sent me with this.
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.
hopefully you won't need it.
not unless he's got some way of getting that crap into the air.
all right, last one across.
come on, people, they want this bridge up in no more than three minutes!
better get you off the island before they raise the bridges. Patrolman!
go!
l can't find my mom.
Hey!
what the hell are you doing?
gentlemen...
...time to spread the word.
and the word is...
...panic.
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.
right there.
that water main is right under the Narrows.
lt's okay.
this is Commissioner Loeb.
come on, somebody talk to me.
come on!
loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.
what the hell is going on?
we need reinforcements. TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!
Gordon! All the city's riot police are on the island with you!
well, they're completely incapacitated!
lt's okay, it's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.
of course they are!
Crane? -No. Scarecrow.
Gordon...
...there's nobody left to send in.
so l'm on my own?
the Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.
this is just the beginning. lf they hit the whole city...
...there's nothing to stop Gotham tearing itself apart.
how are they gonna do that? -The train.
the monorail follows the water mains to the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.
if the machine gets to the station...
...it'll cause a chain reaction that'll vaporize the city's water supply.
covering Gotham in this poison.
l'm gonna stop him from loading that train, but l may need your help.
what do you need? -Can you drive stick?
there you are!
there is nothing to fear but fear itself!
l am here to help!
Batman will save us. He'll come.
he'll come. -Don't peek.
this is Gordon. Prepare to lower the bridge.
l told you he'd come.
wait.
you could die.
at least tell me your name.
lt's not who l am underneath...
...but what l do that defines me.
Bruce?
well, well. You took my advice about theatricality a bit literally.
lt ends here. -For you and the police, maybe.
my fight, however, lies with the rest of Gotham.
now, if you'll excuse me, l have a city to destroy.
l can't beat two of your pawns? -As you wish.
GPS online.
in 1 00 yards.
gentlemen.
who the hell authorized this?
distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.
the pressure's moving along the mains, blowing the pipes.
lf that pressure reaches us...
...the water supply right across the whole city is gonna blow!
at the next intersection, turn right.
you will never learn.
sorry.
familiar. Don't you have anything new? -How about this?!
you have arrived at Wayne Tower.
evacuate the building.
we're on top of the main hub and it's gonna blow.
weapons system activated.
nice ride.
armed.
don't be afraid, Bruce.
come on. Come on.
you are just an ordinary man in a cape.
that's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.
who said anything about stopping it?
Yes!
you never learned to mind your surroundings!
have you finally learned to do what is necessary?
l won't kill you...
...but l don't have to save you.
the meeting's already started. -What meeting?
fox, l seem to remember firing you.
you did.
l got another job.
yours.
on whose authority?
Batman may have made the front page...
...but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.
Bruce Wayne.
what makes you think you can decide who's running Wayne Enterprises?
the fact that l'm the owner. -What are you talking about?
the company went public a week ago.
and l bought most of the shares.Through various charitable foundations and trusts and so forth.
look, it's all a bit technical, but the important thing...
...is that my company's future is secure.
right, Mr. Fox?
right you are, Mr. Wayne.
didn't you get the memo?
l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel. -No. No, Bruce...
...l'm sorry.
the day that Chill died, l...
l said terrible things.
but true things.
l was a coward with a gun...
...and justice is about more than revenge, so thank you.
l never stopped thinking about you.
about us.
and when l heard you were back, l...
l started to hope.
but then l found out about your mask.
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.
no. This...
...is your mask.
your real face is the one that criminals now fear.
the man l loved...
...the man who vanished...
...he never came back at all.
but maybe he's still out there somewhere.
maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman...
...l'll see him again.
proved me wrong, you know. -About what?
your father would be very proud of you.
just like me.
what will you do?
rebuild it.
just the way it was, brick for brick.
just the way it was, sir?
Yeah, why?
l thought this might be a good opportunity for...
...improving the foundations.
ln the southeast corner? -Precisely, sir.
nice. -l couldn't find any mob bosses.
well, sergeant? -lt's " lieutenant " now.
you really started something.
bent cops running scared.
hope on the streets.
But? -The Narrows is lost.
and we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.
we will.
we can bring Gotham back.
what about escalation? -Escalation?
we start carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics.
we start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor-piercing rounds.
And? -And you're wearing a mask...
...and jumping off rooftops.
now, take this guy.
armed robbery, double homicide.
got a taste for the theatrical, like you.
leaves a calling card.
l'll look into it.
l never said thank you.
and you'll never have to.
...knowing what lies ahead.
then again, we all are.
how did you do it?
never mind. Doesn't matter. Might've let your best friend know, though.
let you know what? -You know bloody well what.
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.
okay?
you're being stupid. -Yeah, that's me.
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend.
I didn't put my name in that cup.
I don't want eternal glory. I just wanna be...
look, I don't know what happened tonight, and I don't know why.
it just did.
okay?
piss off.
what a charismatic quartet.
hello.
I'm Rita Skeeter.
I write for the Daily Prophet.
but of course you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know.
you're the juicy news.
what quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks?
what mysteries do the muscles mask?
does courage lie beneath those curls?
in short, what makes a champion tick?
me, Myself & l" want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers.
so who's feeling up to sharing?
shall we start with the youngest? Lovely.
this is cozy.
it's a broom cupboard.
you should feel right at home, then.
don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?
no.
so tell me, Harry.
here you sit, a mere boy of 1 2
I'm 14. Sorry.
about to compete against three students...
...not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself...
...but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt...
...in your dizziest daydreams.
concerned?
I don't know. I haven't really thought about it.
just ignore the quill.
then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of 1 2, are you?
fourteen. -Your story's legend.
do you think it was the trauma of your past...
...that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?
no, I didn't enter.
of course you didn't.
everyone loves a rebel, Harry.
scratch that last.
speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel?
proud? Or concerned...
...that your attitude shows, at best, a pathological need for attention...
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?
Hey, my eyes aren't "glistening with the ghosts of my past.
Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.
since the World Cup, the Ministry's been intercepting more and more owls...
...and she 's too easily recognized.
we need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.
meet me in the Gryffindor common room, 1: 00 this Saturday night.
and make sure you 're alone.
Sirius.
P. S.
the bird bites.
Sirius?
Harry Potter, age 1 2...
...suspect entrant in the Triwizard Tournament.
his eyes swimming with the ghosts of his past...
...and choking back tears...
Sirius. How--?
I don ' t have much time, so let me get straight to it.
did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire?
No!
I had to ask.
now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.
but who was the third man in the room?
I don't know. -You didn't hear a name?
no.
Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
and what was that?
he wanted...
...me.
I don't know why. But he was gonna use this man to get to me.
but, I mean, it was only a dream, right?
Yes.
it's just a dream.
look, Harry.
the Death Eaters at the World Cup, your name rising from that goblet...
...these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.
what are you saying?
I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff?
he was a Death Eater. And no one, no one stops being a Death Eater.
then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone. Sent his own son to Azkaban.
you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet...
...but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
I'm not ready for this, Sirius. -You don't have a choice.
someone's coming. -Keep your friends close, Harry.
who were you talking to?
what? Who says I was talking to anyone? -I heard voices.
maybe you're imagining things. Wouldn't be the first time.
you're probably just practicing for your next interview, I expect.
amazing.
amazing! -Neville. You're doing it again.
right, sorry.
magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs"?
moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
it's already been through enough people.
why don't you just go and talk to him yourself?
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.
what do you want me to say again?
go.
ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him...
...that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you.
is that right? Well, you
what?
are you sure you won't do this? -Do it.
Dean was told by Parvati that...
please don't ask me to say it again.
Hagrid's looking for you.
well, you can tell Ronald-- -I'm not an owl!
did you bring your father's cloak, like I asked you?
Yeah, I brought the cloak. Hagrid, where are we going?
you'll see soon enough.
now pay attention, this is important.
what's with the flower?
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?
as a matter of fact, I have.
you might like to try the same thing now and again.
Hagrid?
the cloak! Put the cloak on!
bonsoir, Olympe. -Oh, Hagrid.
I thought perhaps you weren't coming. I thought perhaps...
...you had forgotten me.
couldn't forget you, Olympe.
what is it you wanted to show me?
when we spoke earlier, you sounded so...
...exhilarated.
you'll be glad you came. Trust me.
can we get closer?
dragons?
that's the first task?
you're joking. -Come on, Harry.
these are seriously misunderstood creatures.
Oh, crikey!
although, I have to admit, that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.
poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him, you know.
Ron was here? -Oh, sure.
his brother Charlie helped to bring him over from Romania.
didn't Ron tell you that?
no, he didn't.
he didn't tell me a thing.
you cheat, Potter. -You stink, Potter.
good luck, Potter. -Potter stinks!
Cedric rules. -Thanks.
like the badge?
excuse me.
Harry.
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!
can I have a word?
all right. -You stink, Potter!
Potter, you stink! -Harry Potter smells!
dragons. That's the first task.
they've got one for each of us. -Come on, Ced!
are you serious?
and Fleur and Krum, do they--?
Yes. -Come on, Ced, leave him.
right. -He's not worth it.
read the badges, Potter! -Hey, listen. About the badges.
I've asked them not to wear them, but-- -Don't worry about it.
it's not like I try to blow things up, exactly.
it just happens a fair bit.
you have to admit, though, fire's pretty fascinating.
you're a right foul git, you know that?
you think so? -I know so.
anything else?
Yeah. Stay away from me. -Fine.
there's Potter. Cheat. -Why so tense, Potter?
my father and I have a bet, you see.
I don't think you're gonna last 10 minutes in this tournament.
he disagrees. He thinks you won't last five.
I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy.
he's vile and cruel. And you're just pathetic.
pathetic? -Oh, no, you don't, sonny!
I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned!
you stinking, cowardly, scummy...
professor Moody! -...back-shooting
what are you doing? -Teaching.
ls that a--? Is that a student? -Technically, it's a ferret.
stand still! Stand still!
my father will hear about this! -ls that a threat?
professor Moody! -ls that a threat?
professor!
I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair!
Alastor! Alastor. -lt doesn't end here!
we never use transfiguration as a punishment!
surely Dumbledore told you that.
he might've mentioned it. -Well, you will do well to remember it.
away!
you. Come with me.
that's a Foe-Glass.
lets me keep an eye on my enemies.
if I can see the whites of their eyes, they're standing right behind me.
wouldn't even bother telling you what's in there.
you wouldn't believe it if I did.
now...
...what are you going to do about your dragon?
well, you know, I just thought l'd...
sit.
listen to me, Potter.
your pal Diggory?
by your age, he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time.
miss Delacour?
she's as much a fairy princess as I am.
as for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust...
...but Karkaroff's is not.
they'll have a strategy.
and you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths.
come on, Potter.
what are your strengths?
I don't know.
well, I can fly. I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But l...
better than fair, the way I heard it. -But I'm not allowed a broom.
you're allowed a wand.
bets! Place your bets!
bets taken! Bets taken here!
step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter in today's bloodbath?
smart money's on Krum to survive! Any bets?
Yes, sir?
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go. Thank you very much.
your attention, please.
this is a great day for all of us.
each of the three tasks involves very considerable danger.
please keep your seats at all times.
this will minimize any risks you may be exposed to.
Harry? Is that you? -Yeah.
I'm sure we all wish our champions...
how are you feeling? Okay? -... the greatest of luck.
the key is to concentrate. After that, you just have to
battle a dragon.
young love.
how...
...stirring.
if everything goes unfortunately today...
...you two may even make the front page.
you have no business here.
this tent is for champions...
...and friends.
no matter. We've got what we wanted.
good day, champions. Gather round, please.
now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived.
a moment only four of you can fully appreciate.
what are you doing here, Miss Granger?
sorry, I'll just go.
barty, the bag.
champions, in a circle around me.
miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.
and, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here. That's right. Now...
...Miss Delacour, if you will.
the Welsh Green.
Mr. Krum.
the Chinese Fireball.
the Swedish Short-Snout.
which leaves... -The Horntail.
what's that, boy? -Nothing.
the Hungarian Horntail.
these represent four very real dragons...
...each of which has been given a golden egg to protect.
your objective is simple:
collect the egg.
this you must do, for each egg contains a clue...
...without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task.
any questions?
very well. Good luck, champions.
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon, you may
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!
three of our champions have now faced their dragons...
...and so each one of them will proceed to the next task.
and now our fourth and final contestant.
Harry! Harry! Harry!
your wand, Harry! Your wand!
Yeah! -Yes!
Oh, my God.
Yeah! -Yeah! Well done, dragon!
Yes! Yes!
Yes, Harry! -Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.
or an arm. -Pack it in altogether?
Never! -Never!
shush!
go on, Harry. What's the clue?
who wants me to open it? -Yes!
do you want me to open it? -Yes!
what the bloody hell was that?
all right, everyone! Go back to your knitting.
this is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosy sods listening in.
I reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.
caught on, have you? Took you long enough.
I wasn't the only one who thought you'd done it.
everyone was saying it behind your back.
brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
least I warned you about the dragons. -Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
no, no, no, I did.
no, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you...
...that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.
Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along.
I thought we'd be all right, you know...
...after you'd figured that out.
who--? Who could possibly figure that out?
that's completely mental.
Yeah. Isn't it?
I suppose I was a bit distraught.
boys.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
Cho, Harry's looking at you.
shush.
look at this!
I can't believe it! She's done it again.
miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl...
...seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards.
her latest prey, sources report...
...is none other than the Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.
no word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.
thank you, Nigel.
not now, Nigel. Later.
go on.
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.
mum sent me a dress.
well, it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
nose down, Harry.
Ginny, these must be for you. -I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.
what are you on about?
they're not for Ginny.
they're for you.
dress robes. -Dress robes? For what?
the Yule Ball...
...has been a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament...
...since its inception.
on Christmas Eve night, we and our guests...
...gather in the Great Hall...
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.
as representatives of the host school...
...I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward.
and I mean this literally, because...
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...
...a dance.
Silence!
the house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly 10 centuries.
I will not have you, in the course of a single evening, besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
try saying that five times fast, huh?
now, to dance...
...is to let the body breathe.
inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers...
...longing to burst forth and take flight.
something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.
inside every boy, a lordly lion prepared to prance.
Mr. Weasley. -Yes?
will you join me, please?
now, place your right hand on my waist.
where? -My waist.
and extend your arm.
Mr. Filch, if you please.
never gonna let him forget this, are you?
never. -Never.
everybody come together. Boys, on your feet!
why do they have to travel in packs?
how are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?
blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons. If you can't get a date, who can?
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
I take after my mum.
though I didn't know her very well. She left when I was about 3.
no, not the maternal sort, her.
broke me dad's heart, though. He was a tiny little fella, my dad.
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with one hand and put him up on the dresser.
he laughed so hard at that.
very funny.
and then he died just when I started school, so...
so I sort of had to make me own way, as it were.
but enough of me. What about you?
this is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
well, us and Neville.
Yeah, but, then again, he can take himself.
it might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
now I'm really depressed.
get a move on or all the good ones will have gone.
who you going with, then?
Oi, Angelina? -What?
do you wanna go to the ball with me?
to the ball?
Yeah, all right.
Oi, Hermione.
you're a girl.
very well spotted.
come with one of us?
come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone.
for a girl, it's just sad.
I won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me!
and I said yes!
bloody hell.
she's lying, right?
if you say so.
look, we've just gotta grit our teeth and do it.
tonight, when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
agreed.
Cho! -Harry!
watch yourself on the stairs. It's a bit icy at the top.
okay, thanks.
Cho?
yes?
well, I just wondered if you
I wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
sorry, I didn't catch that.
I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Harry...
...I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me.
and...
well, I've said I'll go with him.
okay. Yeah. Great.
fine. No problem.
okay. Good.
Harry?
I really am...
...sorry.
it's all right, Ron.
it's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter.
what happened to you?
he just asked Fleur Delacour out.
what? -What did she say?
no, of course.
she said yes? -Don't be silly.
there she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk.
I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out.
actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening.
and what did you do then? -What else? I ran for it.
I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
I always liked looking at them from behind.
she's never gonna forgive me, ever.
Hey!
bloody hell.
bloody hell.
bloody...
Oh, bloody...
what are those? What are those?
my dress robes. -Well, they're all right!
no lace. No dodgy little collar.
well, I expect yours are more traditional.
Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.
murder me, Harry.
leave it alone!
poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out.
who? -Hermione, of course.
come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.
Hello, boys. -Hello, boys.
don't you look...
...dashing.
there you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
ready, professor? -To dance.
it's traditional that the three champions-- Well, in this case, four.
are the first to dance.
surely I told you that. -No.
well, now you know.
as for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.
Oh, there you are. -Come on, then.
come along this way.
Oh, come on.
Hi. -Now, I need you all to line up...
...in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late.
this way. This way. Come along.
she looks beautiful!
Yeah, she does.
is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum?
no. Absolutely not.
Hi!
Harry, take my waist.
what? -Now!
are you ready?
move your body like a hairy troll
learning to rock and roll
spin around like a crazy elf
dancing by himself
boogie down like a unicorn
no stopping till the break of dawn
put your hands up in the air
like an ogre who just don 't care
can you dance like a Hippogriff?
ruddy pumpkin head, isn't he?
I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library.
may I have your arm?
arm. Leg. I'm yours.
hot, isn't it?
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us?
no, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.
what's got your wand in a knot?
he's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy.
the enemy? Who was it wanting his autograph?
besides, the whole point of the tournament...
...is international magical cooperation...
...to make friends.
I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
are you going to ask me to dance or not?
no.
he's using you. -How dare you?!
besides, I can take care of myself. -I doubt it. He's way too old.
What?! What? That's what you think? -Yeah, that's what I think.
you know the solution then, don't you?
go on. -Next time there's a ball...
...pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does!
and not as a last resort.
well, that's-- I mean, that's just completely off the point.
Harry.
where have you been?
never mind! Off to bed, both of you.
they get scary when they get older. -Ron, you spoiled everything!
what's this about?
no, don 't let
this magic die
the answer's there
let me see it again.
Yes, the time is close now.
Harry, at last!
step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
you all right, Harry?
I just got in.
me.
Harry, you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.
the task is two days from now. -Really? I had no idea.
I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament.
actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.
I just mean he's not particularly loquacious.
mostly, he watches me study.
it's a bit annoying, actually.
you are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you?
what's that supposed to mean?
it just means these tasks are designed to test you...
...in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel.
and...
...I'm scared for you.
you got by the dragons mostly on nerve.
I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
Hey, Potter!
Potter! -Cedric.
How--? How are you?
spectacular.
I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
forget it. I'm sure you would've done the same for me.
exactly.
you know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor?
it's not a bad place for a bath.
just take your egg...
...and mull things over in the hot water.
I must be out of my mind.
I'm definitely out of my mind.
I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
myrtle!
Hello, Harry.
long time no see.
I was circling a blocked drain the other day...
...and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion.
not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?
Polyjuice Potion?
kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, "Try putting it in the water"?
that's what he did.
the other boy...
...the handsome one...
...Cedric.
well, go on. Open it.
come seek us. Where our voices sound
we cannot sing. Above the ground
an hour long you'll have to look
to recover what we took
Myrtle...
...there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there?
very good.
it took Cedric ages to riddle it out.
almost all the bubbles were gone.
Harry, tell me again.
come seek us where our voices sound.
the Black Lake, that's obvious.
an hour long you'll have to look.
again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic.
potentially problematic"?
when's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione?
look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
hate to break up the skull session.
professor McGonagall wants you in her office.
not you, Potter, just Weasley and Granger.
but, sir, the second task is only hours away, and
exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now...
...and could do with a good night's sleep.
go. Now!
Longbottom!
why don't you help Potter put his books back.
you know, if you're interested in plants...
...you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.
do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees?
Neville, no offense, but I really don't care...
...about plants.
now, if there's...
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour...
...then great. But otherwise
I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed.
any bets? Any bets? -Come on, place your bets!
step up, mates! Don't be shy.
three lads. -One lady.
four go down. -But do four come up?
don't be so mean.
any bets? -Fleur's 1 0-1.
you're sure about this, Neville? -Absolutely.
for an hour? -Most likely.
most likely?
well, there is some debate among herbologists...
...as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water
you're telling me this now? You must be joking!
I just wanted to help.
well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione.
where are they anyway?
you seem a little tense, Harry. -Do l?
welcome to the second task.
last night, something was stolen from each of our champions.
a treasure of sorts.
these four treasures, one for each champion...
...now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake.
in order to win...
...each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface.
simple enough, except for this: -Put that in your mouth.
they will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only.
after that, they'll be on their own. No magic will save them.
you may begin at the sound of the cannon.
what's the matter with him? -I don't know, I can't see him.
Oh, my God. I've killed Harry Potter.
Yeah!
what?
the Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour...
...has unfortunately been forced to retire...
...so she will take no further part in this task.
but she' s my friend too!
only one!
let's get down below.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Yes!
Harry!
he's all right.
he's all right. Barty!
go get him another towel. -I want all the judges over here now!
you saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save.
my little sister.
thank you.
and you! You helped.
well, yeah, a bit.
Harry! -Hermione!
are you all right? You must be freezing.
personally, I think you behaved admirably.
I finished last, Hermione.
next to last. Fleur never got past the Grindylows.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
come on! Come on! -Attention!
attention!
the winner is Mr. Diggory...
...who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head Charm.
however, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first...
...had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...
...but the others as well, we've agreed to award him...
...second place...
second place! -Well done!
...for outstanding moral fiber!
Yes!
right on. -All that moral fiber, eh?
it's great. -Moral fiber?
blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right.
Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber. -Congratulations, Potter.
a fine achievement. -Thank you.
well done, boy.
see you at Hagrid's, Harry. -I'm sorry we haven't spoken.
after all, your story is one I've heard so many times.
quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course...
...to lose one's family.
never whole again, are we?
still, life goes on...
...and here we stand.
I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter.
Bartemius!
not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we?
the last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!
and they say I'm mad.
now, I remember-- I remember when I first met you all.
biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.
suppose you remind me of meself a little.
and here we all are, four years later. -We're still a bunch of misfits.
well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
and Harry, of course.
soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been!
Hooray!
Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts
teach us something, please
Mr. Crouch?
a man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must take action.
I will not.
in times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!
then for once show them some!
the Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!
a true leader does what is right, no matter what others think.
what did you say to me? -Excuse me, gentlemen.
it may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.
Oh, Harry!
Harry, how good to see you again.
I can come back later, professor.
not necessary, Harry. The minister and l are done. I'll be back in a moment.
minister, after you.
there you are. Your hat.
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence.
but I have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp.
professor?
professor. -Yeah.
igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request...
...to present evidence to this council.
should your testimony prove consequential...
...council may be prepared to order your immediate release.
until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.
do you accept these terms?
I do, sir. -And what do you wish to present?
I have names, sir.
there was Rosier, Evan Rosier.
rosier is dead. -He took a piece of me with him...
...though, didn't he? -I didn't know.
lf that is all the witness has to offer-- -No, no, no.
there was Rookwood! He was a spy.
Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah, the same.
he passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself.
very well. Council will deliberate.
in the meantime, you will return to Azkaban.
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape?
as the council is aware, I've given evidence on this matter.
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...
...turned spy for us at great personal risk. -It's a lie!
today he's no more a Death Eater than I am. -Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!
Silence!
unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence...
...this session is now concluded.
Oh, no, no, no.
I've heard about one more.
what's that? -The name.
yes? -I know for a fact...
...this person took part in the capture...
...and, by means of the Cruciatus Curse...
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife!
the name. Give me the wretched name!
Barty Crouch...
...Junior.
hold him down!
get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men!
Hello, Father.
you are no son of mine.
curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution.
it's a Pensieve.
very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched.
it allows me to see once more things I've already seen.
you see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something...
...some small detail...
...something I might have overlooked...
...something that would explain why these terrible things have happened.
every time I get close to an answer, it slips away.
it's maddening.
sir? Mr. Crouch's son.
what exactly happened to him?
he was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it.
but he had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming.
why do you ask? -It's just that l...
I had a dream about him.
it was in the summer, before school.
in the dream, I was in a house.
and Voldemort was there, only he wasn 't quite human.
and Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch 's son.
have there been others like this dream? - Yes.
always the same one.
sir, these dreams...
...what I see, you don't think it's actually happening, do you?
I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry.
I think it's best if you simply...
...cast them away.
it's a sign, Severus. You know what it means as well as l.
Potter!
what's your hurry?
congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring.
Gillyweed, am I correct?
Yes, sir.
ingenious.
a rather rare herb, gillyweed.
not something found in your everyday garden.
nor is this.
know what it is?
bubble juice, sir?
Veritaserum.
three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his darkest secrets.
the use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However...
...should you ever steal from my personal stores again...
...my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
I haven't stolen anything. -Don't lie to me.
gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?
you and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...
...I'm going to find out why!
Yeah! -Yeah!
Sonorus!
earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.
only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory...
...and Mr. Potter...
...are tied for first position...
...they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum...
...and Miss Delacour. -Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!
the first person to touch the cup will be the winner!
I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter.
should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task...
...he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.
contestants! Gather around. Quickly!
in the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep.
instead, you'll face something even more challenging.
you see, people change in the maze.
Oh, find the cup if you can.
but be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way.
champions, prepare yourselves!
good luck.
my boy. -See you later, Dad.
on the count of three. One
fleur?
Fleur.
get down!
get down!
no, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric!
get off me! -He's bewitched!
Yes.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Thanks. -No problem.
you know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me.
for a moment, so did l.
some game, huh?
some game.
go!
go on, take it. You saved me, take it!
together. One, two... -Two...
...three! -...three!
you okay? -Yeah. You?
where are we?
I've been here before.
it's a Portkey.
Harry, the cup is a Portkey. -I've been here before, in a dream.
Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now!
what are you talking about?
Harry! What is it? -Get back to the cup!
who are you? What do you want? -Kill the spare.
do it! Now!
bone of the father...
...unwillingly given.
flesh of the servant...
...willingly sacrificed.
and blood of the enemy...
...forcibly taken.
the Dark Lord shall rise...
...again.
my wand, Wormtail.
hold out your arm.
master.
thank you, master.
the other arm, Wormtail.
welcome, my friends.
thirteen years it's been, and yet...
...Here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday.
I confess myself...
...disappointed.
not one of you tried to find me.
Crabbe! Macnair!
Goyle!
not even you...
...Lucius.
my Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts
there were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers.
I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways.
the face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence...
...that is my true mask.
I returned.
out of fear, not loyalty.
still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail.
thank you, master.
thank you.
such a handsome boy. -Don't touch him!
Harry.
I'd almost forgotten you were here.
standing on the bones of my father. Yeah.
I'd introduce you...
...but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days.
the boy who lived.
how lies have fed your legend, Harry.
shall I reveal what really happened that night 13 years ago?
shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers?
Yes, shall l?
it was love.
you see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son...
...she provided the ultimate protection.
I could not touch him.
it was old magic.
something I should have foreseen.
but no matter, no matter.
things have changed.
I can touch you...
...now.
Yeah.
astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?
pick up your wand, Potter.
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!
you've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes?
first, we bow to each other.
come on, now, Harry. The niceties must be observed.
Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he?
I said, bow.
that's better. And now... -No.
attaboy, Harry.
your parents would be proud.
especially your filthy Muggle mother.
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.
I'm going to destroy you.
after tonight, no one will ever again question my powers.
after tonight, if they speak of you...
...they'll speak only of how you...
...begged for death.
and l, being a merciful Lord...
...obliged.
get up!
don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter!
I want you to look at me when I kill you!
I want to see the light leave your eyes!
have it your way.
do nothing! He's mine to finish!
he's mine!
Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey.
we can linger for a moment to give you some time...
...but only a moment. Do you understand?
Harry, take my body back, will you?
take my body back to my father.
let go.
sweetheart, you're ready.
let go! Let go!
No!
he did it!
Harry!
Harry!
No! No! No, don't!
for God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened?
he's back. He's back.
Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back.
I couldn't leave him, not there.
it's all right, Harry. It's all right.
he's home. You both are.
keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed.
the body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people.
let me through.
let me through!
let me through!
that's my son!
that's my boy!
it's my boy!
come on. Get up. Easy, easy! -No.
this is not where you want to be right now. Come on.
No!
it's all right, I got you.
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.
No!
No!
are you all right, Potter?
does it hurt? That?
not so much now.
perhaps I'd better take a look at it.
the cup was a Portkey.
someone had bewitched it.
what was it like?
what was he like? -Who?
the Dark Lord.
what was it like to stand in his presence?
I don't know.
it was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams...
...into one of my nightmares.
were there others?
in the graveyard, were there others?
I...
I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor.
marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?
did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods...
...if I hadn't suggested it?
do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater...
...if I hadn't told him first myself?
did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder...
...could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book...
...that led him straight to it?
it was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.
you bewitched Krum, but you-- -"But-- But
you won because I made it so, Potter.
you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.
and now the deed is done.
the blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord.
imagine how he will reward me when he learns...
...that I have once and for all...
...silenced the great Harry Potter.
Severus.
that's it, take it.
do you know who I am? -Albus Dumbledore.
are you Alastor Moody? Are you? -No.
is he in this room? Is he in this room?
Harry, away from there!
you all right, Alastor? -I'm sorry, Albus.
that's Moody. But then who's--?
Polyjuice Potion.
now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus.
we'll get you up in a minute.
Harry!
Barty Crouch Junior.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
your arm, Harry.
you know what this means, don't you?
he's back.
lord Voldemort has returned.
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.
send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
I'll be welcomed back like a hero. -Perhaps.
personally, I've never had much time for heroes.
today, we acknowledge...
...a really terrible loss.
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...
...exceptionally hard-working...
...infinitely fair-minded...
...and, most importantly...
...a fierce, fierce friend.
now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died.
you see...
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...
...By Lord Voldemort!
the Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this.
but not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory.
now, the pain...
...we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me...
...and reminds us...
...that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues...
...our hearts beat as one.
in light of recent events...
...the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever.
remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain.
you remember that...
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...
...kind and honest...
...and brave and true, right to the very end.
I never liked these curtains.
set them on fire in my fourth year.
by accident, of course.
I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry.
professor...
...when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment...
...when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
priori Incantatem.
you saw your parents that night, didn't you?
they reappeared.
no spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that.
dark and difficult times lie ahead.
soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.
but remember this:
you have friends here.
you're not alone.
Hermione.
this is for you.
write to me. Promise.
Bye.
au revoir, Ron.
do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
no. -No.
no, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons?
everything's going to change now, isn't it?
Yes.
promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
I won't. You know I won't.
Harry will, won't you? -Yeah. Every week.
I just wondered if you
I wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
sorry, I didn't catch that.
I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Harry...
...I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me.
and...
well, I've said I'll go with him.
okay. Yeah. Great.
fine. No problem.
okay. Good.
Harry?
I really am...
...sorry.
it's all right, Ron.
it's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter.
what happened to you?
he just asked Fleur Delacour out.
what? -What did she say?
no, of course.
she said yes? -Don't be silly.
there she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk.
I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out.
actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening.
and what did you do then? -What else? I ran for it.
I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Hi, Harry. -Hi, Harry.
I always liked looking at them from behind.
she's never gonna forgive me, ever.
Hey!
bloody hell.
bloody hell.
bloody...
Oh, bloody...
what are those? What are those?
my dress robes. -Well, they're all right!
no lace. No dodgy little collar.
well, I expect yours are more traditional.
Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.
murder me, Harry.
leave it alone!
poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out.
who? -Hermione, of course.
come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.
Hello, boys. -Hello, boys.
don't you look...
...dashing.
there you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
ready, professor? -To dance.
it's traditional that the three champions-- Well, in this case, four.
are the first to dance.
surely I told you that. -No.
well, now you know.
as for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.
Oh, there you are. -Come on, then.
come along this way.
Oh, come on.
Hi. -Now, I need you all to line up...
...in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late.
this way. This way. Come along.
she looks beautiful!
Yeah, she does.
is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum?
no. Absolutely not.
Hi!
Harry, take my waist.
what? -Now!
are you ready?
move your body like a hairy troll
learning to rock and roll
spin around like a crazy elf
dancing by himself
boogie down like a unicorn
no stopping till the break of dawn
put your hands up in the air
like an ogre who just don 't care
can you dance like a Hippogriff?
ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?
I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library.
may I have your arm?
arm. Leg. I'm yours.
hot, isn't it?
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us?
no, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.
what's got your wand in a knot?
he's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy.
the enemy? Who was it wanting his autograph?
besides, the whole point of the tournament...
...is international magical cooperation...
...to make friends.
I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
are you going to ask me to dance or not?
no.
he's using you. -How dare you?!
besides, I can take care of myself. -I doubt it. He's way too old.
What?! What? That's what you think? -Yeah, that's what I think.
you know the solution then, don't you?
go on. -Next time there's a ball...
...pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does!
and not as a last resort.
well, that's-- I mean, that's just completely off the point.
Harry.
where have you been?
never mind! Off to bed, both of you.
they get scary when they get older. -Ron, you spoiled everything!
what's this about?
no, don 't let
this magic die
the answer's there
let me see it again.
Yes, the time is close now.
Harry, at last!
step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
you all right, Harry?
I just got in.
me.
Harry, you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.
the task is two days from now. -Really? I had no idea.
I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament.
actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.
I just mean he's not particularly loquacious.
mostly, he watches me study.
it's a bit annoying, actually.
you are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you?
what's that supposed to mean?
it just means these tasks are designed to test you...
...in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel.
and...
...I'm scared for you.
you got by the dragons mostly on nerve.
I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
Hey, Potter!
Potter! -Cedric.
How--? How are you?
spectacular.
I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
forget it. I'm sure you would've done the same for me.
exactly.
you know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor?
it's not a bad place for a bath.
just take your egg...
...and mull things over in the hot water.
I must be out of my mind.
I'm definitely out of my mind.
I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
myrtle!
Hello, Harry.
long time no see.
I was circling a blocked drain the other day...
...and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion.
not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?
Polyjuice Potion?
kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, "Try putting it in the water"?
that's what he did.
the other boy...
...the handsome one...
...Cedric.
well, go on. Open it.
come seek us Where our voices sound
we cannot sing Above the ground
an hour long you'll have to look
to recover what we took
Myrtle...
...there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there?
very good.
it took Cedric ages to riddle it out.
almost all the bubbles were gone.
Harry, tell me again.
come seek us where our voices sound.
the Black Lake, that's obvious.
an hour long you'll have to look.
again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic.
potentially problematic"?
when's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione?
look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
hate to break up the skull session.
professor McGonagall wants you in her office.
not you, Potter, just Weasley and Granger.
but, sir, the second task is only hours away, and
exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now...
...and could do with a good night's sleep.
go. Now!
Longbottom!
why don't you help Potter put his books back.
you know, if you're interested in plants...
...you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.
do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees?
Neville, no offense, but I really don't care...
...about plants.
now, if there's...
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour...
...then great. But otherwise
I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed.
any bets? Any bets? -Come on, place your bets!
step up, mates! Don't be shy.
three lads. -One lady.
four go down. -But do four come up?
don't be so mean.
any bets? -Fleur's 1 0-1.
you're sure about this, Neville? -Absolutely.
for an hour? -Most likely.
most likely?
well, there is some debate among herbologists...
...as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water
you're telling me this now? You must be joking!
I just wanted to help.
well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione.
where are they anyway?
you seem a little tense, Harry. -Do l?
welcome to the second task.
last night, something was stolen from each of our champions.
a treasure of sorts.
these four treasures, one for each champion...
...now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake.
in order to win...
...each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface.
simple enough, except for this: -Put that in your mouth.
they will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only.
after that, they'll be on their own. No magic will save them.
you may begin at the sound of the cannon.
what's the matter with him? -I don ' t know, I can ' t see him.
Oh, my God. I've killed Harry Potter.
Yeah!
what?
the Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour...
...has unfortunately been forced to retire...
...so she will take no further part in this task.
but she' s my friend too!
only one!
let's get down below.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Yes!
Harry!
he's all right.
he's all right. Barty!
go get him another towel. -I want all the judges over here now!
you saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save.
my little sister.
thank you.
and you! You helped.
well, yeah, a bit.
Harry! -Hermione!
are you all right? You must be freezing.
personally, I think you behaved admirably.
I finished last, Hermione.
next to last. Fleur never got past the Grindylows.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
come on! Come on! -Attention!
attention!
the winner is Mr. Diggory...
...who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head Charm.
however, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first...
...had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...
...but the others as well, we've agreed to award him...
...second place...
second place! -Well done!
...for outstanding moral fiber!
Yes!
right on. -All that moral fiber, eh?
it's great. -Moral fiber?
blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right.
Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber. -Congratulations, Potter.
a fine achievement. -Thank you.
well done, boy.
see you at Hagrid's, Harry. -I'm sorry we haven't spoken.
after all, your story is one I've heard so many times.
quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course...
...to lose one's family.
never whole again, are we?
still, life goes on...
...and here we stand.
I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter.
Bartemius!
not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we?
the last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!
and they say I'm mad.
now, I remember-- I remember when I first met you all.
biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.
suppose you remind me of meself a little.
and here we all are, four years later. -We're still a bunch of misfits.
well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
and Harry, of course.
soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been!
Hooray!
Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts
teach us something, please
Mr. Crouch?
a man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must take action.
I will not.
in times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!
then for once show them some!
the Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!
a true leader does what is right, no matter what others think.
what did you say to me? -Excuse me, gentlemen.
it may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.
Oh, Harry!
Harry, how good to see you again.
I can come back later, professor.
not necessary, Harry. The minister and l are done. I'll be back in a moment.
minister, after you.
there you are. Your hat.
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence.
but I have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp.
professor?
professor. -Yeah.
igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request...
...to present evidence to this council.
should your testimony prove consequential...
...council may be prepared to order your immediate release.
until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.
do you accept these terms?
I do, sir. -And what do you wish to present?
I have names, sir.
there was Rosier, Evan Rosier.
rosier is dead. -He took a piece of me with him...
...though, didn't he? -I didn't know.
lf that is all the witness has to offer-- -No, no, no.
there was Rookwood! He was a spy.
Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah, the same.
he passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself.
very well. Council will deliberate.
in the meantime, you will return to Azkaban.
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape?
as the council is aware, I've given evidence on this matter.
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...
...turned spy for us at great personal risk. -It's a lie!
today he's no more a Death Eater than I am. -Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!
Silence!
unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence...
...this session is now concluded.
Oh, no, no, no.
I've heard about one more.
what's that? -The name.
yes? -I know for a fact...
...this person took part in the capture...
...and, by means of the Cruciatus Curse...
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife!
the name. Give me the wretched name!
Barty Crouch...
...Junior.
hold him down!
get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men!
Hello, Father.
you are no son of mine.
curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution.
it's a Pensieve.
very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched.
it allows me to see once more things I've already seen.
you see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something...
...some small detail...
...something I might have overlooked...
...something that would explain why these terrible things have happened.
every time I get close to an answer, it slips away.
it's maddening.
sir? Mr. Crouch's son.
what exactly happened to him?
he was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it.
but he had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming.
why do you ask? -It's just that l...
I had a dream about him.
it was in the summer, before school.
in the dream, I was in a house.
and Voldemort was there, only he wasn 't quite human.
and Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch 's son.
have there been others like this dream? - Yes.
always the same one.
sir, these dreams...
...what I see, you don ' t think it' s actually happening, do you?
I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry.
I think it's best if you simply...
...cast them away.
it's a sign, Severus. You know what it means as well as l.
Potter!
what's your hurry?
congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring.
Gillyweed, am I correct?
Yes, sir.
ingenious.
a rather rare herb, gillyweed.
not something found in your everyday garden.
nor is this.
know what it is?
bubble juice, sir?
Veritaserum.
three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his darkest secrets.
the use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However...
...should you ever steal from my personal stores again...
...my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
I haven't stolen anything. -Don't lie to me.
gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?
you and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...
...I'm going to find out why!
Yeah! -Yeah!
Sonorus!
earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.
only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory...
...and Mr. Potter...
...are tied for first position...
...they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum...
...and Miss Delacour. -Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!
the first person to touch the cup will be the winner!
I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter.
should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task...
...he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.
contestants! Gather around. Quickly!
in the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep.
instead, you'll face something even more challenging.
you see, people change in the maze.
Oh, find the cup if you can.
but be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way.
champions, prepare yourselves!
good luck.
my boy. -See you later, Dad.
on the count of three. One
fleur?
Fleur.
get down!
get down!
no, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric!
get off me! -He's bewitched!
Yes.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Thanks. -No problem.
you know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me.
for a moment, so did l.
some game, huh?
some game.
go!
go on, take it. You saved me, take it!
together. One, two... -Two...
...three! -...three!
you okay? -Yeah. You?
where are we?
I've been here before.
it's a Portkey.
Harry, the cup is a Portkey. -I've been here before, in a dream.
Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now!
what are you talking about?
Harry! What is it? -Get back to the cup!
who are you? What do you want? -Kill the spare.
do it! Now!
bone of the father...
...unwillingly given.
flesh of the servant...
...willingly sacrificed.
and blood of the enemy...
...forcibly taken.
the Dark Lord shall rise...
...again.
my wand, Wormtail.
hold out your arm.
master.
thank you, master.
the other arm, Wormtail.
welcome, my friends.
thirteen years it's been, and yet...
...Here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday.
I confess myself...
...disappointed.
not one of you tried to find me.
Crabbe! Macnair!
Goyle!
not even you...
...Lucius.
my Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts
there were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers.
I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways.
the face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence...
...that is my true mask.
I returned.
out of fear, not loyalty.
still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail.
thank you, master.
thank you.
such a handsome boy. -Don't touch him!
Harry.
I'd almost forgotten you were here.
standing on the bones of my father. Yeah.
I'd introduce you...
...but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days.
the boy who lived.
how lies have fed your legend, Harry.
shall I reveal what really happened that night 1 3 years ago?
shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers?
Yes, shall l?
it was love.
you see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son...
...she provided the ultimate protection.
I could not touch him.
it was old magic.
something I should have foreseen.
but no matter, no matter.
things have changed.
I can touch you...
...now.
Yeah.
astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?
pick up your wand, Potter.
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!
you've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes?
first, we bow to each other.
come on, now, Harry. The niceties must be observed.
Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he?
I said, bow.
that's better. And now... -No.
Crucio!
Crucio!
attaboy, Harry.
your parents would be proud.
especially your filthy Muggle mother.
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.
I'm going to destroy you.
after tonight, no one will ever again question my powers.
after tonight, if they speak of you...
...they'll speak only of how you...
...begged for death.
and l, being a merciful Lord...
...obliged.
get up!
don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter!
I want you to look at me when I kill you!
I want to see the light leave your eyes!
have it your way.
do nothing! He's mine to finish!
he's mine!
Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey.
we can linger for a moment to give you some time...
...but only a moment. Do you understand?
Harry, take my body back, will you?
take my body back to my father.
let go.
sweetheart, you're ready.
let go! Let go!
No!
he did it!
Harry!
Harry!
No! No! No, don't!
for God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened?
he's back. He's back.
Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back.
I couldn't leave him, not there.
it's all right, Harry. It's all right.
he's home. You both are.
keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed.
the body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people.
let me through.
let me through!
let me through!
that's my son!
that's my boy!
it's my boy!
come on. Get up. Easy, easy! -No.
this is not where you want to be right now. Come on.
No!
it's all right, I got you.
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.
No!
No!
are you all right, Potter?
does it hurt? That?
not so much now.
perhaps I'd better take a look at it.
the cup was a Portkey.
someone had bewitched it.
what was it like?
what was he like? -Who?
the Dark Lord.
what was it like to stand in his presence?
I don't know.
it was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams...
...into one of my nightmares.
were there others?
in the graveyard, were there others?
I...
I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor.
marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?
did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods...
...if I hadn't suggested it?
do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater...
...if I hadn't told him first myself?
did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder...
...could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book...
...that led him straight to it?
it was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.
you bewitched Krum, but you-- -"But-- But
you won because I made it so, Potter.
you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.
and now the deed is done.
the blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord.
imagine how he will reward me when he learns...
...that I have once and for all...
...silenced the great Harry Potter.
Severus.
that's it, take it.
do you know who I am? -Albus Dumbledore.
are you Alastor Moody? Are you? -No.
is he in this room? Is he in this room?
Harry, away from there!
you all right, Alastor? -I'm sorry, Albus.
that's Moody. But then who's--?
Polyjuice Potion.
now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus.
we'll get you up in a minute.
Harry!
Barty Crouch Junior.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
your arm, Harry.
you know what this means, don't you?
he's back.
lord Voldemort has returned.
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.
send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
I'll be welcomed back like a hero. -Perhaps.
personally, I've never had much time for heroes.
today, we acknowledge...
...a really terrible loss.
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...
...exceptionally hard-working...
...infinitely fair-minded...
...and, most importantly...
...a fierce, fierce friend.
now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died.
you see...
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...
...By Lord Voldemort!
the Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this.
but not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory.
now, the pain...
...we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me...
...and reminds us...
...that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues...
...our hearts beat as one.
in light of recent events...
...the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever.
remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain.
you remember that...
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...
...kind and honest...
...and brave and true, right to the very end.
I never liked these curtains.
set them on fire in my fourth year.
by accident, of course.
I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry.
professor...
...when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment...
...when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
priori Incantatem.
you saw your parents that night, didn't you?
they reappeared.
no spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that.
dark and difficult times lie ahead.
soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.
but remember this:
you have friends here.
you're not alone.
Hermione.
this is for you.
write to me. Promise.
Bye.
au revoir, Ron.
do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
no. -No.
no, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons?
everything's going to change now, isn't it?
Yes.
promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
I won't. You know I won't.
Harry will, won't you? -Yeah. Every week.
I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it?
and it's going to get even worse. Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
so, please, remember to cover up and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
come on, guys, time to go home.
come on, love, off you get.
do we have to? - Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate.
he squealed like a pig, didn't he?
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face?
Hey, Big D.
beat up another 10-year-old?
this one deserved it. - Yeah.
five against one, very brave. - Well, you're one to talk.
moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
don't kill Cedric.
who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
shut up. - "He's going to kill me, Mum."
where is your mum?
where is your mum, Potter?
she dead?
is she dead?
is she a dead Pott...?
Dudley. - Dudley, let's go.
what's going on? - What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything. - We're getting out of here, Dudley.
come on, Dudley, hurry up.
dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
don't put away your wand, Harry.
they might come back.
dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
whole world's gone topsy-turvy. - I don't understand. How do you know...?
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?
after You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own?
good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent.
now, get inside and stay there.
expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
it is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
there's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
is that you?
duddy. Vernon, come quick.
we're going to have to take him to a hospital.
who did this to you, boy?
happy, are we, now?
you've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
this is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense.
dear Mr. Potter. - What?
the Ministry has received intelligence that at 6: 23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
as a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
justice.
he's not very well.
sorry, Hedwig.
very clean, these Muggles.
Tonks, for God's sake. - Unnatural.
professor Moody.
what are you doing here? - Rescuing you, of course.
but where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled.
you haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point.
but the letter said...
Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion...
...pending a formal hearing. - A hearing?
don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.
not here, Nymphadora.
don't call me Nymphadora.
stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.
come on, you, around the corner.
come on.
in you go, son.
there've been no sightings.
no deaths. No proof.
he almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough...
Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important...
we must trust Dumbledore on this.
was he able to protect Harry last year? Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second.
his instinct would be to ignore it... - Keep your voices down.
he's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now.
Harry. - Mrs. Weasley.
heavens, you're all right.
bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
if my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
freaks. - There, there, mistress.
scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers.
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack.
you must tell us everything. - Let the man breathe, Hermione.
and this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you.
it's completely unfair. - Yeah.
there's a lot of that going round at the moment.
so, what is this place?
it's headquarters. - Of the Order of the Phoenix.
it's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who.
couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
we wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.
only... - Only what?
only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
but why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
Harry. - Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out. - If you're all done shouting...
do you wanna hear something a little more interesting?
if anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...
...we wouldn't even know voldemort was back.
he's not a child, Molly.
but he's not an adult either.
he's not James, Sirius. - Well, he's not your son.
he's as good as.
who else has he got? - Hey, Ginny.
he's got me. - How touchingly paternal, Black.
perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.
now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
snape's part of the Order? - Git.
about your supposed reformation.
I know better. - So why don't you tell him?
get off it. - Quick.
get it up. - Crookshanks.
stop it. - Get off, you bloody cat.
Crookshanks. Leave it alone. - Get it up.
Hermione, I hate your cat. - Bad Crookshanks.
well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
just because you're allowed to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything.
Hi, Mum.
you hungry, Harry?
you sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
this is very, very peculiar.
it seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me?
show him. He'll find out soon enough.
he's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.
Why?
he thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
no one in their right mind could believe that...
exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind.
it's been twisted and warped by fear.
now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry.
the last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear.
now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
we think Voldemort wants to build up his army again.
fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command.
and not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures.
he's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same.
but gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in.
we believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
something he didn't have last time.
you mean like a weapon?
no. That's enough. He's just a boy.
you say more and you might as well induct him into the Order.
good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight.
Harry.
you are hereby expelled.
before the entire Wizengamot.
trains. Underground.
ingenious, these Muggles.
here we are.
I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun.
right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market.
daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
morning, Arthur. - Morning, Bob.
interdepartmental memos.
we used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
they've changed the time of your hearing. - When is it?
in five minutes.
department of Mysteries.
and I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be...
remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to.
keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
as the Muggles say, truth will out.
yes?
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
good luck, Harry.
disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
witness for the defense.
albus Percival Wulfric... ...Brian Dumbledore.
you got our message that the time and place of the hearing...
...had been changed, did you? - I must have missed it.
but by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.
the charges?
the charges against the accused are as follows:
that he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle.
do you deny producing said Patronus? - No, but...
and you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school...
...while under the age of 17? - Yes, I was, but...
witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.
dementors?
in Little Whinging?
that's quite clever.
muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?
highly convenient. - I'm not lying.
there were two of them, and if I hadn't... - Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce no witnesses of the event...
pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can.
please describe the attack.
what did they look like?
well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny.
not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, big.
cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness had gone from the world.
now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical.
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor.
dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic.
and it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.
that would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an attack without authorization.
of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
the evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible.
he is not back.
in the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations.
laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.
clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial...
...to deal with a simple matter of underage magic?
those in favor of conviction?
those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?
cleared of all charges.
professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
you'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you...
I had to see you off, didn't I?
what's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban.
don't worry about me.
anyway, I wanted you to have this.
original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
she was killed two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Neville's parents.
they suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me.
it's been 14 years.
and still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.
do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius?
it feels like it did before.
you keep it.
anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
hold my hand, lovey.
there they are. They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free.
better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it.
What'd I tell you? Complete nutter. - Just stay away from me!
it's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
Hey, Neville. - Hey there, Neville.
what is it?
what's what? - That. Pulling the carriage.
nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
it's pulling itself, like always.
you're not going mad.
I can see them too.
you're just as sane as I am.
everyone, this is Loony Love...
Luna Lovegood.
what an interesting necklace.
it's a charm, actually.
keeps away the Nargles.
hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
what's a Nargle? - No idea.
good evening, children.
now, we have two changes in staffing this year.
we're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking care of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave.
we also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
and I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck.
now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you...
she was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome.
and how lovely to see all your bright...
...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends.
that's likely. - That's likely.
the Ministry of Magic has always considered...
...the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.
although each headmaster...
...has brought something new to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged.
let us preserve what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.
thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating.
Illuminating? What a load of waffle. - What's it mean?
magic is forbidden in the corridors...
it means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
Dean, Seamus.
good holiday? - All right.
better than Seamus', anyway.
me mum didn't want me to come back this year.
why not? - Let me see. Because of you.
the Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.
what, your mum believes them?
nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother.
don't talk about my mother. - I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.
what's going on? - He's mad, is what's going on.
do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
has anyone else got a problem with Harry?
you all right? - Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
but he'll come through, you'll see. - I said, I'm fine, Ron.
right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then.
Harry.
bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
good morning, children.
ordinary Wizarding Level Examinations.
more commonly known as O.W.L.s.
study hard and you will be rewarded.
fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe.
your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven.
but you'll be pleased to know, from now on...
...you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...
...course of defensive magic. Yes?
there's nothing in here about using defensive spells?
using spells?
well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.
we're not gonna use magic?
you'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way.
what use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.
students will raise their hands when they speak in my class.
it is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient...
...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all, is what school is all about.
and how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
there is nothing out there, dear.
who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
now, let me make this quite plain.
you have been told...
...that a certain dark wizard is at large once again.
this is a lie. - It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
it was murder. Voldemort killed him.
enough!
enough.
see me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
come in.
good evening, Mr. Potter.
sit.
you're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
no, not with your quill.
going to be using a rather special one of mine.
now...
...I want you to write, "I must not tell lies."
how many times?
well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
you haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
yes?
nothing. - That's right.
because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
don't you, Mr. Potter?
go on.
skiving Snackboxes. - Sweets that make you ill.
get out of class whenever you like.
obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom.
care for another?
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me. - Please.
I've been busy studying for these stupid O.W.L. exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.
and if I'm ever rude to you again... - I'll know you've gone back to normal.
what's wrong with your hand?
nothing.
the other hand.
you've got to tell Dumbledore. - No.
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.
I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.
bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.
if the parents knew about this... - I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
it's perfectly simple. You're being... - No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.
you don't understand.
then help us to.
dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
it's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way.
in spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people, will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
your feet. Aren't they cold? - Bit.
unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
what are they? - They're called Thestrals.
they're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit...
different.
but why can't the others see them?
they can only be seen by people who've seen death.
so you've known someone who's died, then?
my mum.
she was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment...
...and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong.
I was 9. - I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad.
we both believe you, by the way.
that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
but I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
what do you mean?
well, if I were You-Know-Who...
...I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
do you ever stop eating? - What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
can I join you?
pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?
I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.
so silly of me, but it sounds...
...as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
but to question my practices is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty.
disloyalty.
things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
what's happened to Dumbledore?
having already revolutionized...
...the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts...
...Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School.
just one question, dear.
you've been in this post how long, exactly?
you applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
but you were unsuccessful?
obviously.
could you please predict something for me?
I'm sorry?
move those mouths.
one teensy little prophecy?
pity.
no, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
you are in grave danger.
lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
it's Professor Trelawney.
sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
you can't do this.
actually, I can.
something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several things I would like to say.
there...
professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
thank you.
Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number 23, as enacted by the minister...
you have the right to dismiss my teachers.
you do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds.
that power remains with the headmaster.
for now.
don't you all have studying to do?
professor.
professor?
professor Dumbledore. Professor!
professor Dumbledore.
that foul, evil, old gargoyle.
we're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our O.W.L.s.
she's taking over the entire school.
security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority.
furthermore, we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances are the work...
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
Harry.
Sirius.
what are you doing here? - Answering your letter.
you said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing?
training you to kill half-breeds?
she's not letting us use magic at all. - Well, I'm not surprised.
the latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.
combat?
what does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army?
that's exactly what he thinks.
that Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry.
he's becoming more paranoid by the minute.
the others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going at all well with the Order.
fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...
...and these disappearances are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
well, what can we do?
someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
but for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own.
he really is out there, isn't he?
we've got to be able to defend ourselves.
and if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will.
Harry.
this is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
look on the bright side: You can't be any worse than old toad face.
Thanks, Ron. - I'm here for you, mate.
who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
just a couple of people.
lovely spot.
thought it would be safer off the beaten track.
matey, come back here.
Hi.
so you all know why we're here.
we need a teacher.
a proper teacher.
one who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.
Why? - Why?
because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.
so he says. - So Dumbledore says.
so Dumbledore says because he says.
the point is, where's the proof?
if Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now.
come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some sort of freak.
is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?
Yes.
I've seen it.
blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that.
and he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.
it's true.
third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once.
last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
wait.
look, it all sounds great when you say it like that...
...but the truth is, most of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help.
he's just being modest. - No, Hermione, I'm not.
facing this stuff in real life is not like school.
in school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow.
but out there...
...when you're a second away from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die right before your eyes...
you don't know what that's like.
you're right, Harry, we don't.
that's why we need your help.
because if we're going to have any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
he's really back.
right. First we need to find a place to practice... ...where Umbridge won't find out.
the Shrieking Shack. - It's too small.
forbidden Forest? - Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?
who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?
who are you and what have you done with Hermione?
anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today.
what's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
right. Over the next few days, we should each come up...
...with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice.
we've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us.
will do, Harry.
all student organizations are henceforth disbanded.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
watch where you're going, Longbottom.
you've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.
the what?
it's also known as the Come and Go Room.
the Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it.
and it's always equipped for the seeker's needs.
so say you really needed the toilet...
charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea.
it's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
I'm hopeless.
you're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
you will please copy the approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
there will be no need to talk. - No need to think's more like it.
Expelliarmus. - Wands away.
stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.
it's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
so come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
come on, Ron. - Come on, Ron.
you can do it. - Come on, Ron.
one Sickle. - You're on.
Stupefy.
thank you. - Shut up.
I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it?
it was completely intentional.
up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus.
very good. Keep your concentration.
great.
a little higher.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up in the high inquisitor's office.
diminuendo.
working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more:
believing in yourself.
Expelliarmus. - Levicorpus. Got it.
think of it this way.
every great wizard in history has started out...
...as nothing more than what we are now: Students.
if they can do it, why not us?
Stupefy. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
Expelliarmus. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
so that's it for this lesson.
now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays.
so just keep practicing on your own as best you can.
and well done, everyone. Great, great work.
well done, mate.
Thanks.
see you after Christmas.
see you in the Common Room, Harry.
thanks a lot, Harry. - No worries.
thank you so much. - Not at all. Merry Christmas.
thank you, Harry. - Thank you. Merry Christmas.
merry Christmas. - Have a good Christmas.
have a great Christmas, Luna. - We've been thinking.
we could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles.
or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils...
sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
anyway, it's worth it.
it's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
he was really good.
it's just, Voldemort was better.
you're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able to stun anything before.
mistletoe.
probably full of Nargles, though.
what are Nargles?
no idea.
well, how was it?
wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
that bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time crying these days.
you'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.
don't you understand how she must be feeling?
well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her O.W.L.s because she's worrying about everything.
one person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode.
just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
in the dream, were you standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
neither. It was like I...
will you please just tell me what's happening?
everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
make sure he's found by the right people.
sir. - Phineas.
you must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place.
tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured...
...and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey.
they've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it.
what's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
look at me!
what's happening to me?
you wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning.
otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
it appears there's a connection...
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear.
pray he remains ignorant.
you mean, if he knows about it, then...
...he'll be able to read my mind? - Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
in the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed to torture them into madness.
only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
used properly, the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you from access or influence.
in these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind.
you will attempt to resist.
prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
concentrate, Potter. Focus.
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
here we go.
daddy's back.
sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents.
and a nice big box for Ron. - Big box for you. And...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
I want to see your faces. - Yes.
try it on. - Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
just what he wanted, actually. - Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
there you are.
happy Christmas. - Thank you.
lovely to have you with us. - Thank you.
now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
thank you. - Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
Hermione. - A Christmas toast.
to Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
Harry. - Harry.
Harry.
that is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that.
daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
no more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.
if my poor mistress only knew... - Kreacher!
that's enough of your bile. Away with you!
of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black.
sorry about that.
he never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy.
not to me, anyway.
what, you grew up here?
this is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order.
about the only useful thing I've been able to do.
this is the Black family tree.
my deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
my parents with their pure-blood mania.
my mother did that after I ran away.
charming woman.
I was 16.
where did you go?
round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
you are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
when I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
and afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment when I wanted to...
this connection between me and Voldemort.
what if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
and what if, after everything that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry.
you're not a bad person.
you're a very good person who bad things have happened to.
you understand?
besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.
we've all got both light and dark inside of us.
what matters is the part we choose to act on.
that's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
when all this is over, we'll be a proper family.
you'll see.
come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
your health? - Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by.
if I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back.
in fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
this is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
giants?
you found them?
well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them to join the cause.
but I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over.
death Eaters? - Yes.
trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who.
did they? - I gave them Dumbledore's message.
suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose.
and they did this to you?
not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
it's changing out there.
just like last time.
there's a storm coming, Harry.
we'd all best be ready when she does.
we have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners...
...in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape.
and of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger.
we strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...
...By a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
he's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I wanted to apologize.
now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.
so, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.
Neville?
fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
she tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
but I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
we're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.
make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember.
allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
a full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents.
wow, that was really good.
fantastic, Ginny.
just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused.
so focus, Luna.
think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
I'm trying. - I know. It's good.
this is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
get them.
been watching them for weeks.
and see, "Dumbledore's Army..."
...proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius.
all your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
we saw your lies for what they were:
a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.
naturally.
no, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me.
most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's.
I instructed Harry to form this organization.
and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.
dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
if we hurry, we should still make the morning edition.
dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
I thought we might hit this little snag.
you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to...
what was the phrase?
come quietly.
well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
enough of this.
take him.
well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Harry.
you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse.
anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much.
and the more you care, the more you have to lose.
so maybe it's just better to... - To what?
to go it alone.
Hagrid.
any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
and they're dangerous at the best of times.
the Ministry restricts their territory much more...
...they'll have a full uprising on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone...
...I'll likely be getting the sack any day now.
and I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
down here, you great buffoon.
Grawpy.
brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because...
because he's my brother.
blimey.
well, half brother, really.
he's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all.
Grawpy, that is not polite. - Hagrid, do something.
we talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
that's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
put me down.
now.
you all right?
fine.
just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
you just stay away from her, all right?
he gets his own food and all.
it's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
you will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
feeling sentimental?
that's private. - Not to me.
and not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve.
every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you.
you won't last two seconds if he invades your mind.
you're just like your father.
lazy, arrogant.
don't say a word against my father. - Weak.
I'm not weak. - Then prove it.
control your emotions.
discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
stop it.
is this what you call control?
we've been at it for hours. If I could just rest.
the Dark Lord isn't resting.
you and Black, you're two of a kind.
sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair.
your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it.
my father was a great man. - Your father was a swine.
Legilimens. - Protego.
come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
nice one, James.
dad. - Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
enough.
enough.
your lessons are at an end.
l...
get out.
what's your name? - Michael.
your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
it's fading already.
you can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while.
as I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children deserve to be punished.
you know, George...
...I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing.
all right, professor!
here you go.
ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
you'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
it's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
what if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
what if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?
what if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die?
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
what do we do?
we'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
not all of them.
Alohomora.
alert the Order if you can.
are you mental? We're going with you. - It's too dangerous.
when are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together.
that you are.
caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl.
you were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
no. - Liar.
you sent for me, headmistress? - Snape, yes.
the time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not.
have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students.
the last of it on Miss Chang.
unless you wish to poison him...
and I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did.
I cannot help you.
he's got Padfoot.
he's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden?
what is he talking about, Snape?
no idea.
very well.
you give me no choice, Potter.
as this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
the Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.
that's illegal.
what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
tell her, Harry!
tell me what?
well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I will.
where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon.
how much further?
not far.
it had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally.
what are you doing?
Lmprovising.
well?
where is this weapon?
there isn't one, is there?
you were trying to trick me.
you know...
...I really hate children.
you have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
how dare you?
filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
please. Please stop it. Please.
now, enough. I will have order.
you filthy animal.
do you know who I am?
leave him alone. It's not his fault.
no, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
but I must not tell lies.
what are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge.
let me go!
thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
how'd you get away? - Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.
that was clever, Ron.
has been known to happen. - It was brilliant.
so how are we getting to London?
look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real.
or was that all just words to you?
maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.
so how are we going to get to London?
we fly, of course.
department of Mysteries.
this is it.
he should be here. - Harry.
it's got your name on it.
the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.
for neither can live while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
you know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
you saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see.
now, hand me the prophecy.
if you do anything to us, I'll break it.
he knows how to play.
itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
better, now they're about to be avenged.
now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
all we want is that prophecy.
why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?
you dare speak his name?
you filthy half-blood!
it's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you?
prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made.
which is lucky for you, really.
haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord?
why he was unable to kill you...
...when you were just an infant?
don't you want to know the secret of your scar?
all the answers are there, Potter, in your hand.
all you have to do...
...is give it to me.
then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
well done, Neville.
Stupefy.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Reducto.
get back to the door.
department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they?
the voices.
can you tell what they're saying?
there aren't any voices, Harry.
let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
please, Harry.
get behind me.
did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough to think...
...that children stood a chance against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
don't give it to him, Harry.
get away from my godson.
now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here.
what? No, I'm staying with you.
you've done beautifully.
now, let me take it from here.
black.
Expelliarmus!
nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
no. No.
I killed Sirius Black.
you coming to get me? - Crucio.
you've got to mean it, Harry.
she killed him. She deserves it.
you know the spell, Harry.
do it.
so weak.
it was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom.
the Aurors are on their way.
by which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
you've lost, old man.
Harry.
so weak.
so vulnerable.
look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
it's how you are not.
Harry?
you're the weak one...
...and you'll never know love or friendship.
and I feel sorry for you.
you're a fool, Harry Potter.
and you will lose everything.
he's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
no, you don't.
it's my fault.
no, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...
...before Voldemort made the connection between you.
I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year...
...He'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected.
the prophecy said:
neither one can live while the other one survives.
it means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
why didn't you tell me?
for the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
the same reason your friends saved you.
after all these years, after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
how come you're not at the feast?
lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.
that's awful.
Oh, it's all good fun.
but as it's the last night, I really do need them back.
do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
are you sure you don't want any help looking?
that's all right.
anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.
if not always in the way we expect.
think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
what's that?
that even though we've got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
yeah?
something worth fighting for.
Harry.
bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry. Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge. How lovely to see...
uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
what is it?
nothing. School stuff.
later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
Oh, you're still here, are you? - Yes.
don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
damn good of my brother to keep you.
he'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh?
give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.
take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
okay.
finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
can I tempt you, Marge? - Just a small one.
excellent nosh, Petunia.
a bit more.
usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
just a bit more. That's a boy.
you wanna try a little drop of brandy?
a little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
what are you smirking at?
where did you send the boy, Vernon?
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
you mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
it's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out.
what is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.
and a drunk too, no doubt? - That's a lie.
what did you say? - My dad wasn't a drunk.
don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.
actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
it's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs.
if something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
shut up! Shut up!
right.
let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon! Vernon, do something!
stop!
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.
hold on, hold on. - Get off.
don't you dare! - Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
please!
Marge!
come back!
you bring her back! You bring her back now.
you put her right! - No. She deserved what she got.
keep away from me. - You can't do magic outside school.
yeah? Try me. - They won't let you back now.
you've nowhere to go.
I don't care. Anywhere is better than here.
welcome to the Knight Bus......emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
my name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening.
what you doing down there?
I fell over. - What you fell over for?
I didn't do it on purpose. - Well, come on, then.
let's not wait for the grass to grow.
what you looking at? - Nothing.
well, come on, then. In.
no, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.
come on.
come on. Move on, move on.
take her away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
it's going to be a bumpy ride.
what did you say your name was? - I didn't.
whereabouts are you headed? - The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
you hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."
the Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup...make sure you eat it before it eats you.
but the Muggles. Can't they see us? - Muggles?
they don't see nothing, do they?
no, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
ten, nine, eight...seven, six, five...four, three, three and a half...two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
who is that?
that man.
who is that?
who is...?
that is Sirius Black, that is.
don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
he's a murderer.
got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
how did he escape? - Well, that's the question, isn't it?
he's the first one that done it.
he was a big supporter of....You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
they're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
mind your head.
Hey, guys? Guys?
why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.
the Leaky Cauldron. - Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
take it away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
room 11.
Hedwig.
right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
he arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
as Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located....a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
the Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
she has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
she will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
so that's that...and no harm done.
pea soup?
no, thank you.
minister? - Yes?
I don't understand. - Understand?
I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban...for blowing up their aunts.
on the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things...was very, very irresponsible.
the state of things, sir? - We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
but what's he got to do with me?
nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters.
and tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
these are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty...of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't...wander.
right! You gonna move that bus or what?
housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
it's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect?
it's in his nature. - A cat? Is that what they told you?
looks like a pig with hair. - That's rich...coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
egypt. What's it like? - Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
egyptians used to worship cats. - Along with the dung beetle.
not flashing that clipping again? - I haven't shown anyone.
no, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom.
the day maid. - Night maid.
cook. - The bloke who fixed the toilet.
Harry. - Mrs. Weasley.
good to see you, dear. - Good to see you.
got everything? - Yes.
yes? All your books? - It's all upstairs.
your clothes? - Everything.
good boy. - Thank you.
Harry Potter. - Mr. Weasley.
Harry, wonder if I might have a word? - Yeah, sure.
Hermione. - Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
looking forward to a new term? - Yeah. It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me...from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
but I think that you need to know the facts.
you are in danger.
grave danger.
has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
what do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
only that he's escaped from Azkaban. - Do you know why?
thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
Voldemort. - Don't say his name.
sorry.
when you stopped You-Know-Who...
...Black lost everything.
but to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
and in his mind...you are the only thing that stands in the way...of You-Know-Who returning to power.
and that is why...he has escaped from Azkaban.
to find you.
and kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear...you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley...why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
quick. Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...
I lost control. - Brilliant.
honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
come on. Everywhere else is full.
who do you think that is?
professor R. J. Lupin. - Do you know everything?
how is it she knows everything?
it's on his suitcase, Ronald. - Oh.
do you think he's really asleep? - Seems to be. Why?
I gotta tell you something.
let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...to come after you? - Yeah.
but they'll catch Black, won't they?
I mean, everyone's looking for him. - Sure.
except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. - Thanks, Ron.
why are we stopping?
we can't be there yet.
what's going on?
I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.
there's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
bloody hell! What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
thank you.
here, eat this. It'll help.
it's all right. It's chocolate.
what was that thing that came?
it was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.
it was searching the train for Sirius Black.
if you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
eat. You'll feel better.
what happened to me?
well, you sort of went rigid.
we thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
and did either of you two...you know...pass out? - No.
I felt weird, though.
like I'd never be cheerful again.
but someone was screaming.
a woman.
no one was screaming, Harry.
welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
now, I'd like to say a few words...before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
first, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R. J. Lupin...who's kindly consented to fill the post...of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
good luck, professor.
of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter. Is it true you fainted?
I mean, you actually fainted? - Shove off, Malfoy.
how did he find out? - Just forget it.
our Care of Magical Creatures teacher...has decided to retire...in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
fortunately, I'm delighted to announce...that his place will be taken by none other...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
finally, on a more disquieting note...
the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
now whilst I've been assured...that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities...a word of caution.
dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish...
therefore, I must warn each and every one of you...
it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
but you know, happiness can be found...
fortuna Major.
here, listen. She just won't let me in.
fortuna Major. - No, no. Wait, wait.
watch this.
amazing. Just with my voice. - Fortuna Major.
Yes, all right. Go in. - Thank you.
still doing that after three years.
she can't even sing. - Exactly.
Hey, man. - Hey, man.
Oh, God. - That's awful.
green. That's a monkey.
what is that? - You call that a monkey?
do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
Ron, catch. - I will.
I think we have a winner.
Oh, don't try one of them. - Oh, no.
look at him. His face.
welcome, my children.
in this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
in this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
this term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
so please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
what do you see?
the truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
but first, you must broaden your minds.
first, you must look beyond. - What a load of rubbish.
where did you come from? - Me?
I've been here all this time. - You, boy...
is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup.
pity.
broaden your minds.
your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond?
I think you are. - Sure.
look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering.
and that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So...you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
my dear...you have the Grim.
the Grin? What's the Grin?
not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.
taking form of a giant spectral dog.
it's among the darkest omens in our world.
it's an omen...of death.
you don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.
now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
a fair few.
hang on. That's not possible.
ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
you have to be in two classes at once.
don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.
that's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
a great lesson. So follow me.
right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there.
and open your books to page 49.
exactly how do we do that?
just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me.
don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. - I'm okay. Okay.
I think they're funny. - Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.
witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs.
wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor! Dementor!
just ignore him. - You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
isn't he beautiful?
say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
that, Ron, is a hippogriff.
first thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
it may be the last thing you ever do.
now, who'd like to come and say hello?
well done, Harry. Well done.
come on now.
now...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So...step up. Give him a nice bow.
then you wait and see if he bows back.
if he does, you can go and touch him.
if not... Well, we'll get to that later.
just make your bow.
nice and low.
back off, Harry. Back off.
keep still.
keep still.
well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you.
right. I think you can go and pat him now.
go on. Don't be shy.
nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow.
not so fast, Harry.
slow down, Harry. That's it...
nice and slow. Now let him come to you.
slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
that's it...
Yes!
well done! Well done, Harry, well done!
does he get to fly?
I think he may let you ride him now. - What?
come on. - Hey, hey, hey!
put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.
that was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
well done, well done.
how am I doing me first day? - Brilliant, professor.
you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa! Buckbeak!
away, you silly creature...
it's killed me! - Calm down. It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
he has to be taken to the hospital. - I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
you're gonna regret this. - Class dismissed!
you and your bloody chicken!
does it hurt terribly, Draco?
it comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky.
madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
I can't do homework for weeks. - Listen to the idiot.
he's really laying it on thick, isn't he? - At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
he's been sighted! - Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
you don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
with dementors at every entrance? - Dementors?
he slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?
that's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke.
like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
intriguing, isn't it?
would anyone like to venture a guess...as to what is inside?
that's a boggart, that is. - Very good, Mr. Thomas.
now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
no one knows. - When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
they take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
that's what makes them so... - So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
let's practice it now. Without wands, please.
after me. Riddikulus!
Riddikulus! - Very good.
a little louder and very clear. Listen:
Riddikulus! - Riddikulus!
this class is ridiculous. - Very good.
so much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
what really finishes a boggart is laughter.
you need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?
come on, don't be shy. Come on.
come on.
hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?
professor Snape.
sorry? - Professor Snape.
professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.
you live with your grandmother. - I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No...it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.
only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
she carries a red handbag... - We don't need to hear.
as long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe...here's what I want you to do. Excuse me.
imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
can you do that?
Yes. Wand at the ready.
one, two, three.
think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line...
form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most...and turn it into something funny.
next! Ron!
concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!
wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
you see? Very good, very good!
marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!
show us what you see.
keep your nerve. Steady.
Riddikulus!
and next! Step up, step up!
wonderful, wonderful!
here!
Riddikulus!
right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today.
collect your books from the back.
that's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry!
sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
should your behavior reflect poorly on the school...that privilege shall not be extended again.
no permission form signed, no visiting the village.
that's the rule, Potter.
those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.
forget about it, guys. See you later.
professor, can I ask you something?
you want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
but then I remembered that night on the train...and the dementor. - I'm very impressed.
that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
this is very wise.
before I fainted...I heard something.
a woman...screaming.
dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother...the night she was murdered.
the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.
not by your scar, by your eyes.
they're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her.
your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
not only was she a singularly gifted witch...she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
she had a way of seeing the beauty in others...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
and your father, James, on the other hand...he...
he had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
a talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
you're more like them than you know, Harry.
in time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
we never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
you heard it's the most... - Haunted building in Britain. I know.
what's going on?
probably Neville forgot the password again.
Hey. - Oh, you're there.
let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
get back, all of you.
no one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
the Fat Lady! She's gone!
serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
it's not funny, Ron.
keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room.
be quiet. - Make way.
the headmaster's here. - Come on, move.
you heard. Move!
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
there's no need for ghosts, professor.
the Fat Lady's there.
mind where you're going! Slow down!
you listen! I'm Head Boy!
come back here! - Keep moving!
dear lady, who did this to you?
eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
it's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about.
he's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
thank you. - The third floor's clear too, sir.
very good. - I've done the dungeons.
no sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
remarkable feat, don't you think?
to enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...completely undetected? - Quite remarkable, yes.
any theories on how he managed it?
many. Each as unlikely as the next.
you may recall...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns...about your appointment of Professor...
not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
what about Potter? Should he be warned?
perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.
for in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
turn to page 394.
excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?
that's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching...at the present time. Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
we're not meant to start that for weeks. - Quiet.
when did she come in? Did you see her come in?
now, which one of you can tell me the difference...between an Animagus and a werewolf?
no one?
how disappointing. - Please, sir.
an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
a werewolf has no choice.
with each full moon...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend.
the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time...you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.
are you incapable of restraining yourself...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
he's got a point, you know. - Five points from Gryffindor.
as an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis...on recognizing it. - It's Quidditch tomorrow.
then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.
loss of limb will not excuse you.
page 394.
the term "werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer..."which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.
there are several ways to become a werewolf.
go, Harry! Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
he looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? - Peaky?
what do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.
let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
probably a right sight better than he normally does.
how are you feeling? - Oh, brilliant.
you gave us a right good scare.
what happened? - Well, you fell off your broom.
Really? I meant the match. Who won?
no one blames you, Harry.
dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
after he saved you, he sent them off.
there's something else you should know too.
when you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
is there no chance of fixing it?
no.
professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
I mean, more than everyone else? - Listen.
dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
they feed on every good feeling, every happy memory...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
you are not weak, Harry.
dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
you have nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm scared, professor. - I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me.
you made the one on the train go away.
there was only one that night.
but you made it go away. - I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
but as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays.
for now, I need to rest.
last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!
guys, let me go. - Clever, Harry.
but not clever enough. - We've got a better way.
I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. - We know.
we'll get you there.
we'll show you a quicker way. - lf you pipe down.
bless him. - Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...
now, Harry. - Come and join the big boys.
what are you doing?!
what's this rubbish? - "What's this rubbish?" he says.
it's the secret to our success. - It's a wrench giving it to you...
but we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs...are proud to present the Marauder's Map.
we owe them so much.
hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that...
no. Is that really...? - Dumbledore.
in his study. - Pacing.
does that a lot.
so this map shows...? - Everyone.
where they are. - What they're doing.
every minute. - Every day.
brilliant! Where did you get it? - From Filch's office.
first year. - There are seven secret passageways...out of the castle. - We'd recommend this one.
the One-Eyed Witch passageway. - Leads you to Honeyduke's.
hurry. Filch is heading this way.
and don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:
mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.
delicious.
it's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
twice.
do you want to move a bit closer?
to the Shrieking Shack?
actually, I'm fine here.
well, well. Look who's here.
you two shopping for your new dream home?
bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in one room?
shut your mouth, Malfoy. - Not very friendly.
boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
hope you don't mean yourself. - How dare you talk to me!
you filthy little mudblood!
who is that?
don't stand there! Do something! - What?
what's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
get out of the way!
move!
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Harry!
bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny.
those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
he won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
aren't you? - Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
Ron fancies her. - That's not true!
professor McGonagall! - Cornelius!
allow me, minister.
Oh, Hagrid... - Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good.
it'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors...into my pub every other night! - We have...
we have a killer on the loose. - Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
and what would bring him here?
Harry Potter. - Harry Potter?
come.
Harry!
no underage wizards allowed in today! - Shut the damn door!
so rude. - Thick heads.
thick heads?! - How dare they!
who are they calling thick heads? - Young whippersnappers!
nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
tell me what this is all about.
years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
remember? They hid. Few knew where they were.
one who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who.
not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy.
always trailing after Black. - I remember.
never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
what happened? - Peter tried to warn the Potters...and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew.
he destroyed him!
a finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters...but he's the reason they're dead. - He wants to finish things.
I don't believe it. - That's not the worst of it.
what could be worse? - This: Sirius Black was...and remains to this day...Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. - Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
he was their friend...and he betrayed them.
he was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!
when he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
there you are. You came.
are you sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic...well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
well, everything's prepared.
the spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
did you ever hear of it?
no? Well...
a Patronus is a positive force. For the wizard who conjures one...it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
but in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
can you do this? Yes. Very well.
close your eyes.
concentrate.
explore your past.
do you have a memory?
allow it to fill you up.
lose yourself within it.
then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.
Expecto Patronum. - Very good.
shall we? Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto... Expecto...
expect...
here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths.
it's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
that would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
that's one nasty dementor. - Oh, no, no, no.
that was a boggart, Harry. A boggart.
the real thing would be worse. Much, much worse.
as a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
which memory did you choose? - The first time I rode a broom.
that's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.
there's another. It's not happy, exactly.
well, it is.
it's the happiest I've ever felt...but it's complicated. - Is it strong?
then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
well done, Harry. Well done!
I think I've had enough for today. - Yes. Sit down. Here.
eat this, it helps. It really helps.
and just so you know, Harry...I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that...is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
and Mum.
seeing their faces.
they were talking to me.
just talking.
that's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
but it's the best I have.
beautiful day. - Gorgeous.
unless you've been ripped to pieces!
ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
ronald has lost his rat. - I haven't lost anything!
your cat killed him! - Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers...is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone.
well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
your cat killed him! - Did not.
did. - Didn't.
how did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
well, first off, the committee members took turns...talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak...was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
and then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine.
he said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature...who would kill you as soon as look at you.
and then?
and then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
they're not sacking you! - No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
I don't wanna tap-dance! - You tell those spiders.
right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...
Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy.
always trailing after Sirius Black. - Black was vicious.
he didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
put that light out! - Sorry.
watch it there, boy. - We're trying to sleep here!
mischief managed. Nox.
Potter.
what are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
how extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
he, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
my dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
turn out your pockets.
turn out your pockets!
what's this?
spare bit of parchment. - Really? Open it.
reveal your secrets.
read it.
messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...
go on.
and request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.
you insolent little... - Professor!
well, well. Lupin.
out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
that remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise.
clearly, it's full of dark magic. - I seriously doubt it, Severus.
it looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone...who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product.
nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
it is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.
are you deaf? Put that light out!
come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black...is a map to you?
no. - No, sir.
your father never set much store by the rules either.
but he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
now, I will not cover up for you again.
do you hear me? - Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
and don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know.
professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.
earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really? And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
that's not possible.
it's just what I saw.
good night, professor.
broaden your minds. You must look beyond.
the art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
only then can you see. Try again.
now, what do we have here?
do you mind me trying?
the Grim, possibly.
my dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class...I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit...for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there.
you may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled...as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books...to which you so desperately cleave.
have I said something?
she's gone mental, Hermione has. Not that she wasn't always mental...but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
hang on.
we better take this back. - I'm not going back.
fine. See you later. - See you.
Harry Potter...
professor Trelawney... - He will return tonight.
sorry?
tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder...shall break free.
innocent blood shall be spilt...and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?
no.
nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
it just got worse. - What did I say? Father said...I can keep the hippogriff's head. I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
this is going to be rich.
look who's here. - Come to see the show?
you! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
he's not worth it.
malfoy, are you okay?
let's go. Quick. - Not a word to anyone, understood?
that felt good. - Not good, brilliant.
look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
why don't we just set him free?
they'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore....would get into trouble. He's coming down, Dumbledore.
says he wants to be with me when they...
when it happens.
great man, Dumbledore.
a great man.
we'll stay with you too. - You'll do no such thing!
think I want you seeing something like that? No.
you just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers! You're alive!
keep a closer eye on your pet. - I think you owe someone an apology.
right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
I meant me!
blimey. What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
no, minister. Over this way.
it's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here.
someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment!
quick. Quick!
Hagrid.
it'll be fine. It'll be okay. - Go on, go on!
that's ling you see over there... - On the slope.
on the slope... Ah, Hagrid. - Professor Dumbledore.
good evening. - Minister. Make your way through.
have a tea, if you like. - No, Hagrid.
gentlemen. - I'd like a cup of tea.
well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak...hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
dear, dear... - Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.
all right. It'll be all right. - The execution shall dispatch...
what?
I thought I just saw...
never mind. - Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
he bit me. Scabbers.
Ron. Ron!
Ron! - Scabbers, come back.
wait!
Scabbers, you bit me! - Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
that's not good. Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
it's the Grim!
Harry! - Ron! Ron, wait!
Harry!
help! - Ron!
Ron. Ron. - Ron!
come on!
move!
duck!
Harry!
Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't worry.
where do you suppose this goes? - I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
we're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
come on.
Ron.
Ron. You're okay. - The dog. Where is it?
it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.
if you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
no. Only one will die tonight.
then it'll be you!
are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
I found him. - I know.
he's here. - I understand.
let's kill him! - No! I trusted you!
and all this time, you've been his friend.
he's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.
how long have you known?
since Professor Snape set the essay. - Well, Hermione.
you are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!
wait! - I did my waiting!
twelve years of it!
in Azkaban!
very well. Kill him.
but wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
you betrayed my parents.
you're the reason they're dead! - No, it wasn't him.
somebody did betray your parents...somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!
who was it, then? - Peter Pettigrew!
and he's in this room! Right now!
come out, come out, Peter!
come out, come out and play! - Expelliarmus!
vengeance is sweet.
how I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
brilliant, Snape.
you put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business...to attend to. - Give me a reason. I beg you!
don't be a fool. - He can't help it. It's habit.
be quiet. - Be quiet yourself!
you two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
but why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you.
do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes.
a Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like.
it's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
after you.
Expelliarmus!
Harry! What did you just do? - You attacked a teacher!
tell me about Peter. - He was at school with us.
we thought he was our friend!
no. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him! - No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!
the map was lying, then. - The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!
me?! He's mental! - Not you! Your rat!
Scabbers has been in my family for... - Twelve years?
curiously long life for a common garden rat!
he's missing a toe, isn't he? - So what?
all they could find of Pettigrew was his... - Finger!
dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
and then he transformed into a rat! - Show me.
give it to him, Ron. - What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
my old friends!
Harry! Look at you. You look so much like your father.
James. We were the best of friends... - How dare you speak to Harry!
how dare you talk about James in front of him!
you sold James and Lily to Voldemort! - I didn't mean to!
the Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done?
what would you have done? - Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
your dad would have spared me! He would have shown me mercy!
should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together!
No!
Harry, this man... - I know what he is.
but we'll take him to the castle.
bless you, boy. Bless you! - Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
after that, the dementors can have you.
sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.
a bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
the tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder.
okay.
you better go. - No. Don't worry, okay?
it's fine. I'll stay.
you go, I'll stay.
you okay? - I'm fine. Go.
that looks really painful. - So painful.
they might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
it's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.
it's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
it'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
that was a noble thing you did back there.
he doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends...to become killers.
besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
alive, you're free.
turn me into a flobberworm. Anything but the dementors!
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet? You won't let them give me...to the dementors, will you? I was your rat!
sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't... - Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle......but if you ever wanted a different home...
what? Come and live with you?
it's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend. Have you taken your potion tonight?
you know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! Here!
this flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus! Remus!
run! Run!
come on. - Wait. Wait.
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
professor?
professor Lupin?
nice doggy. Nice doggy!
there you are, Potter!
Sirius!
come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
no. Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
what?
he sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
they're gonna kill him? - No. It's worse.
much worse.
they're going to suck out his soul.
headmaster, stop them.
they've got the wrong man. - It's true. Sirius is innocent.
it's Scabbers who did it. - Scabbers?
he's my rat, sir.
he's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat.
but then they gave him an owl... - The point is, we know the truth.
please believe us. - I do, Miss Granger.
but the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
a child's voice, however honest and true...is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
mysterious thing, time.
Powerful...and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
you know the laws, Miss Granger.
you must not be seen.
and you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
if not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
if you succeed tonight...more than one innocent life may be spared.
three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
good luck.
what the bloody hell was that all about?
sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
what just happened?
Where's Ron? - 7: 30.
where were we at 7: 30?
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
come on. And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione! Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
you foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
that's us.
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
this is not normal.
this is a Time-Turner, Harry.
mcgonagall gave it to me first term.
this is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
you mean we've gone back in time? - Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
good punch.
Thanks.
malfoy's coming.
run. - Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.
that felt good. - Not good, brilliant.
come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
look. Buckbeak's still alive.
of course.
remember what Dumbledore said?
if we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
let's go.
here they come. I'd better hurry.
fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
keep a closer eye on your pet. - That's Pettigrew.
Harry, you can't. - He betrayed my parents.
you don't expect me to sit here. - Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
if you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
we can't be seen.
fudge is coming.
and we aren't leaving?
why aren't we leaving?
are you mad?
that hurt.
sorry.
we're coming out the back door. Go!
is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
what?
I thought I just saw...
never mind. - Let's go.
okay, go, Harry. Go!
get away. Get off.
minister, I really think I should sign as well.
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...
okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on.
keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
your name only. - It's such a very long name...
hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
come on. Come on, Buckbeak.
come and get the nice dead ferret.
come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky. - Here we are, minister. Follow me.
now, look there. - Where?
look beyond the rocks. - What am I supposed to see?
professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed. - And all the strawberries.
come on, Buckbeak. Come on. - I see no strawberries.
over there. - Where?
over there. - This way.
let's get this over, please. - All right.
but where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
not a moment ago! - How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him.
Hagrid? - Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
how could you? You've been with us all the time.
right. - Well, well...
we must search the grounds.
well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
thank you.
you'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
come on. - This way.
this way, now.
now what? - We save Sirius.
how? - No idea.
look. It's Lupin. - Immobulus!
and Snape's coming.
and now we wait.
and now we wait.
at least someone's enjoying himself. - Yeah.
Hermione? - Yeah?
before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius...I did see someone.
that someone made the dementors go away.
with a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
according to him...only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
it was my dad.
my dad conjured the Patronus.
Harry, but your dad's... - Dead. I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
here we come.
you see Sirius talking to me there?
he's asking me to come live with him. - That's great.
when we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
it'll just be me and him.
we could live in the country...someplace you can see the sky.
he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
run!
let's go.
what are you doing? - Saving your life.
Thanks.
great. Now he's coming for us. - Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
that was so scary.
poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius. Come on!
this is horrible. - Don't worry.
my dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus.
any minute now.
right there. You'll see.
Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.
don't worry, he will. He will come.
Sirius. - You're dying...both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
you were right, Hermione.
it wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because...well, I had already done it.
does that make sense? - No.
but I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this...to both of you.
I want to go with you. - One day, perhaps.
for some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
and besides...you're meant to be here. - But you're innocent.
and you know it.
and for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this...but you look so like your father.
except your eyes.
you have... - My mother's eyes.
it's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
but know this:
the ones that love us never really leave us.
and you can always find them...in here.
you really are the brightest witch of your age.
we have to go.
well? - He's free. We did it.
did what?
good night.
how did you get there?
I was talking to you there. And now you're there.
what's he talking about, Harry? - I don't know.
honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
you've been sacked. - No.
no. I resigned, actually.
resigned? Why?
well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
this time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want...well, someone like me teaching their children.
but Dumbledore... - He has already...risked enough on my behalf.
besides, people like me are...
well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
why do you look so miserable, Harry?
none of it made any difference.
Pettigrew escaped. - Didn't make any difference?
it made all the difference in the world. You uncovered the truth.
you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
it made a great deal of difference.
if I am proud of anything...it is of how much you have learned this year.
now, since I am no longer your teacher...I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
so now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
until then...mischief managed.
stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
wherever did you get it?
can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course.
what are you talking about? - Quiet.
let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
it was badly wrapped. They made me do it.
did not.
it's a Firebolt. - It's the fastest broom in the world.
for me?
but who sent it? - No one knows.
this came with it.
go on, Harry! - Yeah, let's see.
how fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
mischief managed.
NOx.
bloody kids.
how fastidious you've become, Wormtail.
as I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home.
could it be that the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you?
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.
I only meant...
perhaps if we were to do it without the boy.
No! The boy is everything!
it cannot be done without him. And it will be done.
exactly as I said.
I will not disappoint you, my Lord. -Good.
first, gather our old comrades.
send them a sign.
Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker is standing just outside the door.
step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
Harry.
Harry!
are you all right?
Hermione. Bad dream.
when did you get here? -Just now. You?
last night.
wake up! Wake up, Ronald!
bloody hell.
honestly, get dressed.
and don't go back to sleep.
come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready!
Ron, where are we actually going? -Don't know.
Hey, Dad. Where are we going? -Haven't the foggiest.
keep up!
Arthur!
it's about time, son.
sorry, Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start.
this is Amos Diggory, everyone. Works with me at the Ministry.
and this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?
Yes, sir.
this way.
Merlin's beard! You must be Harry Potter.
Yes, sir. -Great, great pleasure.
pleasure to meet you too, sir.
Yes, it's just over there.
shall we? -Oh, yeah.
we don't want to be late.
come on. Nearly there now. Get yourself into a good position.
why are they all standing around that old boot?
that isn't just any old boot. -It's a Portkey.
time to go!
what's a Portkey?
ready! After three. One, two... -Harry!
three!
let go, kids!
What?! -Let go!
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?
total shambles, as per usual. -Thanks.
go on, look at that!
well, kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!
stay together! Keep up, girls!
look!
come on! Keep up, girls!
blimey!
parting of the ways, I think, old chap.
see you at the match. -See you.
Cedric. -Ced, come on.
see you later, Cedric.
home sweet home.
what?
excellent, excellent. -Ginny, look!
all to the bath. -Look.
girls, choose a bunk and unpack.
Ron, get out of the kitchen. We're all hungry.
Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron! -Feet off the table!
feet off the table! -Feet off the table!
I love magic.
get your Quidditch World Cup programs here!
blimey, Dad. How far up are we?
well, put it this way:
if it rains you'll be the first to know.
father and I are in the minister's box...
by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.
don't boast, Draco.
there's no need with these people.
do enjoy yourself, won't you?
while you can.
come on up. Take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.
come on!
it's the lrish! There's Troy!
and Mullet! -And Moran!
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!
here come the Bulgarians! -Yes!
who's that?
that, sis, is the best Seeker in the world.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Krum!
Yes!
good evening!
as Minister for Magic...
it gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you...
to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!
let the match begin!
Krum! Krum! Krum!
there's no one like Krum.
Krum? -Dumb Krum?
he's like a bird, the way he rides the wind.
he's more than an athlete. -Dumb Krum.
he's an artist.
I think you're in love, Ron. -Shut up.
Viktor, I love you
Viktor, I do
when we're apart My heart beats only for you
sounds like the lrish have got their pride on.
stop! Stop it!
it's not the lrish.
we've gotta get out of here. Now!
get out, it's the Death Eaters!
get back to the Portkey, everybody, and stick together!
Fred, George! Ginny is your responsibility.
go!
Harry!
keep up, you lot! -Harry!
Harry! Harry!
Harry!
where are you? -Harry!
we've been looking for you for ages!
thought we lost you, mate.
what is that?
Stupefy!
stop!
that's my son!
Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right? -We came back for Harry.
which of you conjured it?
crouch, you can't -Do not lie!
you've been discovered at the scene of the crime.
crime? -Barty! They're just kids.
what crime?
it's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.
what, Voldemort?
those people tonight, in the masks, they're his too, aren't they?
his followers? -Yeah.
death Eaters.
follow me. -There was a man, before.
there!
all of you, this way!
a man, Harry?
who?
I don't know.
I didn't see his face.
anything from the trolley?
anything from the trolley?
anything from the trolley, dears?
packet of Drooble's...
and a Licorice Wand.
on second thought, just the Drooble's.
it's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry. -Just the Drooble's. Thanks.
two Pumpkin Pasties, please.
thank you.
anything sweet for you, dear?
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.
anything from the trolley?
this is horrible.
how can the Ministry not know who conjured it?
wasn't there any security or...?
loads, according to Dad.
that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.
it's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.
I'm fine.
you know Sirius will want to hear about this...
what you saw at the World Cup and the dream.
Hedwig. There we go.
clear the runway!
well, there's something you don't see every day.
well, now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement.
this castle will not only be your home this year...
but home to some very special guests as well.
you see, Hogwarts has been chosen...
Yes, what is it?
what is it?
tell them to wait. Tell them to wait. Wait.
so Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event:
the Triwizard Tournament.
for those of you who do not know... -Brilliant.
the Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests.
from each school, a single student is selected to compete.
now let me be clear.
if chosen, you stand alone.
and trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint-hearted.
but more of that later. For now, please join me in welcoming...
the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...
and their headmistress, Madame Maxime.
bloody hell.
blimey. That's one big woman.
and now our friends from the north.
please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang...
and their high master, lgor Karkaroff.
Oh, it's Krum!
blimey, it's him!
Viktor Krum!
Albus.
Igor.
professor Dumbly-Dorr, my horses have traveled a long way.
they will need attending to. -Don't worry, Madame Maxime.
our gamekeeper, Hagrid, is more than capable of seeing to them.
but you know, Monsieur Hagrid...
they drink only single-malt whiskey.
you idiot!
your attention, please!
I'd like to say a few words.
eternal glory.
that is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament.
but to do this, that student must survive three tasks.
three extremely dangerous tasks.
wicked. -Wicked.
for this reason, the Ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule.
to explain all this...
we have the head of the Department of lnternational Magical Cooperation...
Mr. Bartemius Crouch.
bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.
Alastor Moody? The Auror? -Auror?
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.
he's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, these days.
my dear old friend, thanks for coming. -Stupid ceiling.
thank you.
what's that he's drinking, do you suppose?
I don't know, but I don't think it's pumpkin juice.
after due consideration...
the Ministry has concluded that, for their own safety...
no student under the age of 17 shall be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament.
this decision is final. -That's rubbish!
that's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
Silence! -They're not too happy about that, then.
the Goblet of Fire.
anyone wishing to submit themselves to the tournament...
need only write their name upon a piece of parchment...
and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night.
do not do so lightly.
if chosen, there's no turning back.
as from this moment, the Triwizard Tournament has begun.
Alastor Moody.
Ex-Auror...
ministry malcontent...
and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
I am here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end.
any questions?
when it comes to the Dark Arts...
I believe in a practical approach.
but first, which of you can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are?
three, sir. -And they are so named?
because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will
will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban, correct.
the Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do.
I say different! You need to know what you're up against!
you need to be prepared.
you need to find another place to put your chewing gum besides the underside of your desk, Mr. Finnigan!
no way. The old codger can see out the back of his head.
and hear across classrooms!
so which curse shall we see first?
Weasley! -Yes?
stand.
give us a curse.
well, my dad did tell me about one.
the lmperius Curse.
Oh, yeah, your father would know all about that.
gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago.
perhaps this will show you why.
hello.
lovely little beauty.
Imperio!
don't worry. It's completely harmless.
if she bites...
she's lethal.
what are you laughing at?
get off!
talented, isn't she?
what should I have her do next? Jump out the window?
drown herself?
scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding...
under the influence of the lmperius Curse.
but here's the rub:
how do we sort out the liars?
another, another.
up, up. Come on.
Longbottom, is it?
up.
professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.
there's the...
the Cruciatus Curse.
correct, correct. Come, come.
particularly nasty.
the torture curse.
Crucio!
stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him? Stop it!
perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.
no?
the Killing Curse.
only one person is known to have survived it...
and he's sitting in this room.
brilliant, isn't he?
completely demented, of course, and terrifying to be in the same room with...
but he's really been there, you know? He's looked evil in the eye.
there's a reason those curses are unforgivable.
to perform them in a classroom... I mean, did you see Neville's face?
Neville?
son?
you all right?
come on. We'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.
we're gonna be late!
come on, Cedric. Put it in!
eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?
three years from now, when we're old enough to be chosen.
Yeah, rather you than me.
Yes!
thank you, thank you.
well, lads, we've done it. -Cooked it up just this morning.
it's not going to work.
Oh, yeah? -And why is that, Granger?
you see this? This is an Age Line.
Dumbledore drew it himself.
so?
so a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an Aging Potion.
but that's why it's so brilliant. -Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.
ready, Fred? -Ready, George.
bottoms up. -Bottoms up.
Yes! -Yes!
Yeah!
Yes!
ready?
Yes! -Yes!
you said! -You said!
Oh, right, you want a piece of me?! -I'll tear your ears off!
now you're making me laugh. -Take this! Come on!
fight! Fight! Fight!
we're "old school," right?
Yeah, but you look older!
sit down. Please.
now the moment you've all been waiting for:
the champion selection.
the Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum.
the champion for Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour.
the Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!
Excellent! We now have our three champions.
but in the end, only one will go down in history.
only one will hoist this chalice of champions...
this vessel of victory...
the Triwizard Cup!
Harry Potter.
Harry Potter?
no. No.
Harry Potter!
go on, Harry.
Harry, for goodness sake.
he's a cheat!
he's not even 17 yet!
it's wrong, I tell you! -You French tart.
everything is a conspiracy theory with you! -Quiet! I can't think!
everything is a conspiracy theory! -I protest.
Harry. -I protest!
did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?
no, sir. -Did you ask one of the older students...
to do it for you? -No, sir.
you're absolutely sure? -Yes. Yes, sir.
but of course he is lying. -The hell he is!
the Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object.
only an exceptionally powerful could have hoodwinked it.
magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.
you seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.
it was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...
perhaps you remember. -This doesn't help, Alastor.
leave this to you, Barty.
the rules are absolute.
the Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract.
Mr. Potter has no choice.
he is, as of tonight...
a Triwizard champion.
this can't go on, Albus.
first the Dark Mark. Now this?
what do you suggest, Minerva?
put an end to it.
don't let Potter compete.
you heard Barty. The rules are clear.
well, the devil with Barty and his rules.
and since when did you accommodate the Ministry?
headmaster, l, too, find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence.
however, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events...
perhaps we should, for the time being...
let them unfold.
What-? Do nothing?
offer him up as bait?
potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.
I agree. With Severus.
alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?
I can do that. -Don't let him know, though.
he must be anxious enough as it is knowing what lies ahead.
then again, we all are.
how did you do it?
never mind. Doesn't matter. Might've let your best friend know, though.
let you know what? -You know bloody well what.
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.
okay?
you're being stupid. -Yeah, that's me.
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend.
I didn't put my name in that cup.
I don't want eternal glory. I just wanna be...
look, I don't know what happened tonight, and I don't know why.
it just did.
okay?
piss off.
what a charismatic quartet.
hello.
I'm Rita Skeeter.
I write for the Daily Prophet.
but of course you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know.
you're the juicy news.
what quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks?
what mysteries do the muscles mask?
does courage lie beneath those curls?
in short, what makes a champion tick?
"me, Myself & l" want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers.
so who's feeling up to sharing?
shall we start with the youngest? Lovely.
this is cozy.
it's a broom cupboard.
you should feel right at home, then.
don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?
no.
so tell me, Harry.
here you sit, a mere boy of 12
I'm 14. Sorry.
about to compete against three students...
not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself...
but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams.
concerned?
I don't know. I haven't really thought about it.
just ignore the quill.
then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?
fourteen. -Your story's legend.
do you think it was the trauma of your past...
that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?
no, I didn't enter.
of course you didn't.
