15 agents, huh?
the best I've got.
you heard him, 15 of the very best FBI agents.
it's a good thing, Walt. - I hope you're right.
go home.
I'll pick you up at 8: 00.
all right.
you have one new message.
if you want to know what happened to Sarah, come to where she was taken.
come alone, or she dies.
I'll be watching.
if you're hearing my voice, that means you've been smart enough to follow my instructions.
good for you, better for Sarah.
she's suffered no permanent injury.
how long she remains unharmed is entirely up to you.
you need to know that I'm watching you at this very moment.
I've had many months to reflect on our brief, but eventful association, and it occurred to me that you are a fraud of monumental proportions, operating in the knowledge that you inhabit only as an observer, a voyeur free from consequence, and that's why I've decided to strip away your safety net.
not only do I want you to know what happened to Sarah,
I want you to experience it.
there is only one thing you can be certain of, and that's if you don't do exactly what I say, you'll never see or hear from either one of us again.
now, take the recorder and get back into the car.
you can push pause until you're ready to continue.
put the key in the ignition, but do not start the engine.
inside the box, underneath the bottom, you'll find a leather case.
open the case, remove the contents.
take the cap off the vial and drink the liquid.
you have 30 seconds.
I'm glad you're here.
what's it going to be, John?
what do you want from me?
what have you done with my son?
there's a suitcase in the corner.
get dressed. I'll be back.
no, please, don't go!
please don't go... where am I?
where is my son...
look, I know you're there.
we both know it's me that you want.
just take me and let Sarah go, okay?
you hear me?
are you there?
just tell me what you want!
this is great...
I'm talking to myself.
do you know what's going to happen to you?
look, I've done everything you want.
I put on the dress, and the hair.
could you at least tell me that my son is okay?
he's fine.
I let him go about an hour after I picked you up.
Oh, thank god.
God had nothing to do with it.
you know...
you never told me your name.
could you tell me your name? - Why?
so I... know what to call you.
that's a pretty name.
I used to have a friend named Linda. That's enough.
I don't want to hear any more about you, or your friends, or your family.
understand?
this isn't a goddamn party.
Linda, do you have any children?
because I have a life inside of me right now...
a life that is not responsible for any of this.
this has nothing to do with you or your baby.
this has...
what is it? You can tell me.
I will not judge you, I promise.
I know that there is a decent person underneath all that pain and rage.
you can tell me.
you don't know me.
you don't know anything about me.
so why don't you shut your goddamn mouth before you get to know who I really am.
now, fix your hair.
that was a really stupid thing to do what is it?
do you want to die? Huh?
is that it? Do you want to die?
because I swear to god...
I swear to god, I will kill you!
now, get down!
I don't know when she's coming back, so I thought I'd take a chance that you would see this, and see me.
Johnny, I need you to tell Walt how much I loved him.
how much he meant to me and to my life you know, after your accident...
he taught me that it was okay to love again, to live again.
I want you to tell J. J. Not to be angry at me that I left him.
tell him to be everything that he can be, and that I hope that one day he has a son that he loves as much as I love him, and he's going to need you now...
and Walt, too. So, please...
will you take care of them for me?
and I have a confession to make.
I never stopped loving you, not for a minute.
I couldn't show it, but it was always there, and I would think about how it could have been with us and...
you know, they say that you can't love two people, but they're wrong...
they're wrong.
goodbye, Johnny.
you bitch!
I realize how frustrated you must be by now, but I promise you, our pain is almost over.
when we first met, you asked me to be honest with you, but how can you expect something you've never offered yourself?
how could you love someone and watch as she gives herself to another man?
Sarah could have been yours, but you weren't strong enough to take her.
now you and I share the pain of losing our one true love, a pain that can only be healed by death.
by the time you hear this message,
I'll be one step closer to mine, and so will you.
crazy bitch...
all right, you can do this, Smith.
you've got to do it.
a pain that can only be healed by death.
by the time you hear this message, I'll be one step closer to mine.
Roscoe, have you seen or heard from John? I can't find him anywhere.
all right, I'll be right in.
well, I was beginning to think that we'd never get an opportunity to talk.
Oh, I still have one barrel left.
come on, Walt, pick up the phone.
damn it.
Where's Sarah?
what did you do with my wife?
I don't care what you've done.
I don'T.
I just want my wife back.
just tell me where she is, and you can walk. You have my word.
that's a very generous offer.
I can see why Sarah was so drawn to you, and why Johnny Smith was so intimidated.
what the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about destiny. Fate.
don't tell me you haven't thought about it late at night.
Johnny and Sarah were lovers long before she even knew your name.
they had a future planned together.
she even gave birth to his son, a child you now claim as your own, but he isn't really yours, is he?
and he never will be, and you're reminded of that every single time u look into his eyes.
I can't imagine that kind of pain.
what is it that you want?
revenge? Is that it? Fine, take me.
just tell me where Sarah is, okay?
I'll call one of my deputies, and I'll go wherever you want me to go.
Oh, you still don't get it, do you?
I'm trying, okay?
but I just need to know that Sarah's okay.
can you tell me that? Can you tell me that Sarah's okay?
she's dead. Sarah's dead.
you're lying.
I took her into the woods...
and I shot her.
she begged for her life.
she told me all about you and her son, and...
she even told me about her baby.
no...
no, she can't-- she can't be dead.
she told me how much you meant to her and how the two of you waited so long to have a child of your own.
Why?
why Sarah? Why?
she begged me to spare her life.
she cried, and she pleaded, and then she got down on her knees, and then I shot her.
you're dead. - I put the gun to her head
do you hear me? You're dead.
and then I squeezed the trigger.
I am going to kill you. You understand that?
I'm going to kill you! - Do it, then!
kill me! Kill me now!
drop the gun. Drop the gun!
get on your knees, you stupid bitch.
you understand me? Get on your knees!
you killed my wife.
you took everything that I cared about.
you took my life!
and now I'm gonna take yours. You understand me?
I'm gonna take yours.
Walt! Walt, don'T...
get the hell out of here, John. This has got nothing to do with you!
look, don't you see what's happening?
she wants you to kill her!
that's what she's wanted from the beginning, to die, but she's too afraid to do it herself!
he's lying.
she-- she killed Sarah, John.
she killed her, she's dead!
what? - She shot her!
Yeah.
you were never man enough for Sarah, and she knew it, and you're not man enough to do what needs to be done, but, Walt...
Walt, you are.
Walt, don't listen to her.
she's insane!
think about your life!
I don't care about my life anymore, I don'T.
look, you want revenge, so do I, but at what cost?
what about J. J?
what's going to happen if he loses his mother and his father!
I'm not his father, John.
you are. - That's right.
now you'll never be a father.
look, don't listen to her!
who did J. J. Come running to when we found him?
dad! - J. J.
Walt, don't do this!
I took it all from you.
Walt, he needs you.
I took her out into the woods...
Walt, don't walk away from him. - And I put the gun to her head...
Walt, don't do this!
and then I killed her. I killed her! I
shut up! Just shut up!
shut up!
you have the right to remain silent. - No!
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
this wasn't supposed to happen.
you have the right to an attorney.
you can't do this.
No! No!
Walt... Walt, come here!
I saw her! Follow me!
this way.
what is it, John? What is it?
we have to get this open.
look out, look out. Watch yourself.
she's not here, John.
Walt, under here. Under here.
she's alive! Call an ambulance!
I'll get my car.
Oh, Sarah... Sarah, hang on, baby.
it's okay.
Hi.
just stay there. Don't move.
how is J. J? - J. J.'S okay.
he's okay, baby.
thank you, John. Thank you.
Hi.
just hang tight, okay?
Oh, my god...
help's going to be on the way, okay?
can I see her now?
I think she'd like that very much.
she's okay?
Yeah, she's a little dehydrated, so we hooked up an I V.
what about the baby?
well, I did an ultra-sound, and everything looks fine.
congratulations, dad.
did you hear that? The baby's okay.
Oh, my god. I can't believe it.
we're going to have a baby, man.
I should have gotten some flowers or some candies or something.
I can think of something that Sarah probably wants more than flowers now, Walt.
what's that?
you.
go see your wife.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, John, what you said about J. J.Before?
I mean, I never tried to replace you.
Ah...
don't worry about it.
I'll never forget what you did for me, what you stopped me from doing.
Thanks.
Hey! Are you kidding me? We're getting a baby!
can you believe it?
I know... - J. J.We're going to have a baby!
can you believe it?
mommy's stomach's going to be like this...
Oh, my god...
what should we name him?
I'm so glad you're okay.
get in here, you.
you, too. I was worried about you.
you're all right, aren't you?
a him or a her?
it's okay, baby.
Johnny'll be home soon.
okay, I promise.
Shh!
ho, I'm home!
okay, here we go.
look at this.
look at this, huh?
all right, look.
we got wipes.
we got powder, huh?
look at this.
Where's the diapers?
no, I got--I got diaper rash cream.
she doesn't have diaper rash.
listen, I touched her butt earlier, okay?
she's gonna.
Johnny, Hope needs diapers.
she's only got two left! -All right, all right.
listen, listen, whoa, whoa! We can use these.
look, it's super absorbent!
no?
Oh, the look. The look!
okay, let me get diapers. Let me get the phone.
Hello?
Hi. It's coach Morrison.
is, uh, is Sarah Bannerman home?
Yeah. She's kinda got her hands full right now.
can I help you?
I'm just checking on J. J.
wondering if that ankle's healing up.
his ankle?
I don't mind if he misses practice, but it's been a week, and we're into finals on Saturday.
wait a second, coach.
what you're saying is he's missed a week of practices 'cause of an injury?
Yeah.
I figured you knew.
no, I-I know.
I knew, I just, uh -Johnny, who is it?
uh, no one.
no one, I just--can I call you back, coach?
no problem.
what's he doing at the old airfield?
Johnny, is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
just the, uh... just the cable company.
they just wanted to sign us up for something.
I'll go get the diapers, okay?
shh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
my son is joining the circus?
through the looking glass.
Yeah, no kidding.
=www. ydy. com/bbs=
big Top
I didn't know you were into the circus.
nice try, kid. Come on, we're going home.
I can'T.
Oh, yes, you can. Let's go.
what, the acrobat girl?
Monique. -Oh, Monique.
is she the reason you've been ditching soccer practice every day this week?
huh?
well, have you talked to her yet?
mm, yeah, I've said...
hi a couple of times, but
what, you haven't made an impression yet?
the performers came to our school Monday.
they did an Alice in wonder land assembly thing in gym to let us know that the circus starts next week.
let me guess. She was Alice?
Yeah.
Hey, J.J!
your mom and I thought you were at soccer practice all week.
you lied to us.
not to mention coach Morrison.
did you tell him that you hurt your ankle?
no, I did hurt my ankle.
but I...guess it got better.
good.'cause we gota long walk home now, kid. Come on
no, Johnny, please!
come on.
I know what I did was wrong.
I do.
but... I have to talk to her.
well, she's practicing now.
no. She only practices till 4: 00.
then she goes back to her trailer until around 4: 30.
then she has a snack. She likes apples.
and then, uh, she eats dinner around -whoa, whoa, hold on.
first things first, okay?
now, look, there's a fine line between admirer and stalker.
okay?
now, you want to start a conversation with a young lady, first thing you do is you pay her a compliment.
okay, cool. Like what?
well, you just tell her, like, I don't know.
tell her you've been watching her practice and you think she's ridiculously talented.
so, okay, so I can stay.
hold on a second. Hey.
you got a half hour, kid.
okay?
all right? Under one condition.
you stay out of this tent.
okay! -Okay?
Oh, my god!
one second.
you're late, Johnny. You're late!
Lorenzo? -Yeah!
is that you? -Yeah
must be the white head.
makes me look fat, huh?
join you later.
must be like, what, 20 years, buddy?
20 years too long, man.
what's going on? You working here?
I own it.
you own all this? -Yeah you don't recognize it, do you?
no, should I?
I hope not. I spent enough converting it.
remember the old carnival?
Oh, you're kidding me. -Yeah
I bought the whole operation ten years ago.
my accident? -Yeah.
I heard about the coma, and, you know, -all that stuff ever since.
can I ask you a serious question?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm thinking of a number between one and ten.
so you're still a complete idiot!
some things never change, right?
but I gotta tell you, this looks nothing like the old carnival, man.
well, I added the big top, and I took every last bit of the old carnival and transformed it into what you see now.
the air base was available, so I decided to give it a runhere back home in Cleaves Mills.
nice.
Alice in Wonderland, huh?
Yeah, well, it's always been an obsession of mine.
Hey, you don't still have the old wheel of fortune, do you?
Oh, most definitely.
you're just not allowed to play.
hey there, Johnny.
Hey.
that girl, she looks just like that girl in high school, the one you had the insane crush on.
what was her name, Denise, uh...Ludovic.
it's her.
the only difference is she doesn't hate me anymore because I'm paying her really, really well.
you enjoying yourself, Smith?
uh, what's going on here?
Hey, sheriff.
looks like you two know each other. -Yeah
Yeah, since high school.
what are you guys doing here?
Oh, there was a break-in last night.
yeah? -Yeah, freaky break-in.
how freaky?
when I promise freaky, I deliver.
I saw this in my vision less than a half hour ago.
you mean, you had a vision of something that already happened?
Yes.
Oh, I get those too.
they're called memories.
in the vision, somebody was dead.
it was a blonde woman.
you got a name?
no.
thanks for the hot tip.
look, I'll be honest with you, Mr. Detulio.
this doesn't look like a prank to me.
this looks serious.
I'll need a list of everyone who has access to this trailer.
no problem.
in the meantime, tell your crew to keep their eyes open.
I'll station a cruiser to patrol the lot.
thank you.
think she likes you.
it's only a trial run.
shall we give it another whirl, yes?
the white rabbit. -Ah!
Oh!
another spin, yes?
I'm not feeling very lucky.
Oh.
it's just for fun.
Oh, uh, hi.
Hi.
I saw you practicing.
you're, uh... ridiculously talented.
you saw me practice?
Yeah.
you were, uh, really... ridiculously talented.
I don't think anyone's supposed to be in there before the show.
are your parents in the show?
they used to be.
they died when I was only one.
Oh. I'm sorry.
I don't have any other family, so everyone here kind of adopted me.
that must be kinda cool.
you know, no one there to tell you what to do or make up stupid rules.
are you kidding?
instead of 2 parents I've got, like, 20.
and I thought my family was weird.
a real customer.
care to try your luck, sir?
yes?
Um...sure.
Oh! Ah!
you did it.
now our guests are going to try for a bigger prize...
if they can get two in a row.
Alice again.
Mm!
shall we give it another whirl?
all right, let's go with... the owl.
mister, in nine years, I've never seen a run like that.
never.
the wheel's closed.
ha ha ha!
right.
the next one, and the panda is yours, yes?
Al-- uh, we'll go with queen of hearts.
Oh! I've gotta go.
you should come to the dress rehearsal tonight after dinner.
there'll be music, and it'll be really cool.
all right, sure.
she's pretty, huh?
she's amazing.
let's take a walk.
come on, Romeo.
let me ask you a question.
back there at the wheel, the queen
you weren't just guessing it wrong on purpose, were you?
no.
you know, uh, Monique invited me to the dress rehearsals.
I heard.
so can I stay? Please?
you know you gotta call your mom, right?
Hey, Johnny.
I need a guinea pig.
care for something sweet?
we're brave, huh?
two of those. Thank you.
Mm!
Denise, you don't know where Lorenzo is, do you?
um, yeah. His trailer is back there.
okay.
you take this one, okay?
I'll be right back, son, all right? Don't move.
Hey, Johnny.
get the sheriff back here.
cherry syrup.
the snow cone stand.
that's where I sensed it.
maybe you should talk to Denise.
who the hell is Denise?
the cheshire cat.
Oh, of course she is.
well... whoever is doing this clearly hates mirrors.
Lorenzo, in the vision that I had,
I saw broken mirrors,
I saw a dead woman, I saw some guy with a tattoo on his arm.
does any of this make any sense to you?
O. This was clearly rigged to fall.
but it was never meant to hurt him.
looks like someone was trying to throw a big scare your way.
anyone come to mind?
look, it could be anyone.
I fire people. I don't hire other people.
maybe someone's holding a grudge.
pretty strange grudge.
Yeah, well, I work with strange people.
look, Johnny, I'm thrilled CSI:
cleaves Mills is on the case, but I don not know this from
so I...
I'd really feel better if you stuck around.
at least through dress rehearsal.
Yeah, well, J.J.'S gonna have to take a rain check on that, Lorenzo.
in that case...
opening night, front row.
you, J.J.And Sarah.
you promised that I could stay.
well, look, I'm sorry, pal, okay?
things have changed.
it's getting a little weird around here.
what happened?
did you get another one of your visions?
Yeah, I did, actually.
I hate them.
you hate them.
what do you mean?
all the kids at school.
they act like I'm a freak or something.
cause we're related.
let me ask you something.
do you think you're a freak?
no.
look, J.J.
I know what people think about me.
and I'm sorry you're getting flak about it in school.
but if it comes down to looking like a freak to try to save someone's life, or trying to act normal like the rest of the world and letting someone get hurt,
I'll take freak every time.
why didn't you save my dad?
I can't believe you did this.
look, I was trying to help J. J.Okay?
the kid has been coming here all week just trying to get up the nerve to talk to this girl.
he lied to us!
that's what I told him.
but you let him stay!
it got sort of complicated.
Johnny, you are not his father.
you know what I mean.
you are not Walt.
you can't make these decisions without consulting me.
he asked me for help, Sarah.
okay?
it's the kinda help that Walt would have given him.
this, of all places.
Johnny, you, of anyone, should know that nothing good ever happens here.
you know, it's not the old carnival anymore.
this place has changed.
has it, really?
come on.
let's finish this at home.
I'll make this up to him.
Johnny, are you coming?
no, I gotta stay here.
I'll see you guys at the house, all right?
what, another vision?
I'll talk to you later. -Oh, damn it, Johnny.
Lorenzo, no!
don't worry, they're not poisonous.
they're corn snakes.
call sheriff turner.
have her meet me in the parking lot.
Yeah.
Hey, who are you?
the van is stolen, but we ran the prints.
they belong to Duncan Miller, 29.
what, you know him?
I thought he was in jail.
he was.
serving a ten-year sentence at Shawshank for the murder of -Alice Sheargold.
he was released a week ago.
how do you know this guy?
it was...about two years after your accident, Johnny.
the carnival was on its last night here at Cleaves Mills.
duncan Miller piled on in may when we swung through Charlotte.
a black guy, right? Glasses?
Yeah, deaf mute.
the guy I saw didn't speak either.
poor Duncan.
he was absolutely obsessed with one of the performers.
even got her name tattooed on his arm.
queen of the reptiles.
did a sort of striptease, but instead of veils, she used snakes.
classy.
that night, she agreed to meet him after the carnival closed.
in the house of mirrors.
later we heard that the whole rendezvous was just a setup to humiliate him.
duncan found out and lost it.
the police found her body covered in blood with shards of broken mirror.
he'd killed her.
still doesn't explain why he's here.
maybe I can find out why.
I know where he is.
let's go.
Freeze!
freeze, or I will shoot your ass, Duncan!
down same old Johnny, always getting me out of jams.
ugly job, but somebody's gotta do it.
what was this guy doing in the tent anyway?
you were there the night that Alice Sheargold died.
in the hall of mirrors.
I was working late after the carnival closed.
I heard a commotion, but when I got inside, it was too late.
he was still there, kneeling beside her dead body.
so I just ran back to my office and called the police.
I'm the reason why Duncan Miller went to jail.
well, that explains why he came after you.
but if he loved her so much, why would he kill her?
come on, Johnny.
even love has a dark side.
all right, buddy, I gotta head home.
so Sarah can yell at me.
and yet, you're not married. Kinda odd.
Yeah.
you went away for a second there, buddy.
Yeah. Did Alice wear a silver, heart-shaped locket?
come to think of it, yeah.
Why?
it's been a long night.
gotta head home.
your coach is thinking of dropping you from the team.
J. J.You lied to us.
okay.
you don't want to talk about this like an adult.
fine.
you're grounded.
so if I told you the truth, you wouldn't be mad at me?
no.
it was still wrong.
look, no matter how much you might feel like you're a grown up you're not.
not yet.
mom -if seeing this girl was so important to you, then you should have said something instead of sneaking off and lying to us.
maybe we could have talked about it, you know?
come up with a compromise.
like when we moved in here?
nobody asked me if I wanted to do it.
we just did it.
you shouldn't be in here, Johnny.
you had a vision of me putting this in the cabinet.
didn't you?
how come you held on to it for this long?
because I loved Alice.
I always have.
your obsession wasn't Alice in wonderland.
it was Alice Sheargold, right?
we were supposed to get married.
then she--she just told me she didn't love me anymore.
she was about to leave town...
with that f--with Duncan.
I got drunk. I lost control. I
man, I don't even remember doing it.
this man spent ten years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.
then he tried to kill me.
if he wanted to kill you, he could have done it easily.
he wanted you to confess!
after all these years!
how do you know that?
because when he came to me and he reached out and he touched me, he wanted me to see the truth.
please, Johnny, can't you just let it go?
no.
thanks for the call.
Yeah, it was hard to make.
so first your friend Walt, now Lorenzo.
you're two for two.
wanna give me your address book?
I can go alphabetically.
you know what your problem is?
you're working way too hard to try to piss me off.
kinda makes me think you're hiding something.
I'm sorry, Sarah.
but I just tried to fix things for J. J.
I think I made it worse.
how 'bout me?
I mean, I can't even keep track of my own son.
for a whole week now, he's been completely off my radar.
anything could have happened to him.
well, if anyone should have seen this coming...
it should have been me, right?
but we are gonna have to figure out how to do this.
you know, I mean...
whatever this is.
and with the baby keeping us running,
J. J.'S just gonna think he can slip through the cracks.
well, I'm open to any ideas.
okay.
so...
how about grounded for a month and no personal calls?
and no allowance?
nice touch. Let's go tell him.
so what's the deal with this girl he just met?
you really wanna know?
do I?
okay. Older woman.
14. Acrobat.
Oh, stop.
I'm so not ready for this.
what, does it sound familiar?
a girl, a boy, a carnival?
very.
but better this time, right?
definitely better.
it's me and your mom. We wanna talk...
Oh, my god. Where is he?
I know exactly where he is.
So...you're sure this is okay?
of course it's okay.
besides, the show's cancelled, and this is my last chance to show you.
are you gonna get in trouble for coming here?
definitely.
I can't believe you snuck out of your house just to come see me.
so...
in the show, the white rabbit, he was supposed to greet the audience.
and he'd mount the hoop, and I'd follow, like going down the rabbit hole, only in reverse.
when I'd be on the hoop, I'd do my whole routine.
wanna see?
no, I-I thought we could just, you know, hang out.
you don't have to do your act.
you don't want to see it?
n-no, I do, I just
I don't think you should go up there.
don't worry.
I've done this like a million times.
just press the green button.
help me!
somebody help me!
I'm trying! It's not working!
help, somebody!
help, somebody!
this thing's broken!
it's not--it's not working!
help! Somebody help me!
she's--she's falling!
Johnny, you've gotta help her!
hang on, hang on!
come on, Johnny! -Hurry up!
Hey, what are you doing?
you're trying to save her.
help! -it's okay.
he's not gonna hurt you. He's not gonna hurt you!
you okay?
you were right.
are you guys okay?
what happened to the rope?
you rigged it for Lorenzo.
didn't you?
that's why you were in the main tent when the police caught you.
he tried to kill Lorenzo?
no, no.
Lorenzo weighs twice what Monique does.
the rope would have broken before he got to the top.
he never would have made it.
it was a warning.
make things right before someone gets hurt.
in the vision I just had, I realized you came back in here to fix it.
you're a good man, Duncan. I'm sorry for everything.
I'm sorry.
do you have anywhere to go?
maybe you could come with us.
everyone here's really nice.
kinda like a family.
I wonder if I'm ever gonna see her again.
you never know.
I'd say you made an impression.
Yeah.
I'm-- I'm sorry about what I said before.
about your visions and my dad.
it's okay.
why'd you sneak out tonight?
I wanted to see Monique again.
that's cool.
back at the tent, after you caught Monique,
I saw the way she looked at you.
she said you were right.
right about what?
I told her I thought...
something bad might happen if she climbed the rope.
did you have a vision about something bad happening?
no, no.
it was just a feeling.
just a feeling.
let me tell you something, son.
you don't ever have to feel bad...
about getting those feelings.
cause when you get them, you come to me.
cause if anyone's gonna understand, it's me, right?
right.
look at it this way.
you saved her.
and she knew it.
I think I get what you said earlier.
I'd rather look like a freak and save someone's life than act normal and let someone get hurt.
there it is.
you're my man.
So...I'm not in trouble.
Oh, no, you're in trouble, all right.
I'd say plan on being grounded till college.
that figures.
come on.
so, let me ask you.
was it worth it?
Oh, yeah.
definitely.
gimme five.
wasn't that our car back there?
Yeah, but I think we need to pick up one of those stuffed animals.
it might make things go better with your mom.
this is liam's desk.
I trust things are going well with the beautiful miss branford.
sure. - "sure"?
well, that's a flaccid response when you're a relationship with a woman who will send you something as saucy as this.
I long for the taste of you.
your strong hands caressing my...
that... That is...
titillating, isn't it?
what do I do?
what should you...
go find her! Tout de suite!
tout de suite. No, I can't. I got the...
Liam, Beth is offering you spontaneity, possibility...
passion!
now, you turn down her overtures, and you will make her feel insecure, unattractive.
your romance is growing...
...like a flower.
do you want to kill the pretty flower?
no.
I want to...
water the flower.
then don't be tardy to the party.
a friend of mine from law school asked me to look into this case for her.
here you go.
she practices in chicago, and her god-daughter attends westminster university here in l. a.
evidently, she's been stripped of her tennis scholarship after a recent match.
they've accused her of cheating.
do we know the specific allegations?
the school won't elaborate on the details, citing privacy issues.
but if the accusations are true, the school might be well within their rights to revoke her scholarship.
my friend has assured me that hannah would never cheat.
so what do you want us to do?
handle it.
I've agreed to give them a break on the billables, so I'm gonna need associates working on this rather than a name partner.
great. Great.
so, should we...
contact the client? Interview the university?
sprint from my office and get to work immediately?
great idea. We're burning daylight.
hello.
we are at work. Discretion, remember?
what's up?
Oh, not much. I thought we might just go and...
I am making copies!
why... Why would you say that to me while I'm making copies?
your note said you wanted me to speak dirty, so let's start with a little bit of...
I long for the taste of...
strong hands caressing my...
"supple"?
you really think I would use the word "supple"?
I'll admit I was surprised at first, but you do have a very extensive vocabulary.
who sent this toou? - You did.
you didn't, and you're not happy.
why woul I not be happy?
the guy I am seeing is getting x-rated notes from some woman in the office.
I am so happy that if I didn't have a client whose life was exploding,
I would that's not sexy.
that's terrifying.
no, I'm not prying.
Susan informed me of your indiscretion in the strictest confidence.
that is incredibly comforting.
her intention was, as always, to protect this firm.
her intention is to punish me.
come on, clifford.
can you blame her?
not only did you expose us to potentially embarrassing litigation, you also betrayed one of the most beautiful and intelligent women I know.
I'm glad you're so enamored with my wife, but this is between me and her.
well, unfortunately, it's not.
that's what I came here to tell you.
I want you to go on record regarding your relationship with katie campbell.
Why? Has she filed a sexual-harassment suit?
no, not yet.
but in case she does, I want us to be bulletproof, which means we paper our side of it in detail.
come on, now. Tell me the truth.
you act like you're protecting the firm, but really this is about seeing me humiliated.
actually, I am just trying to protect the firm.
your humiliation?
just an unexpected dividend.
think about what you're gonna say. - Okay.
Oh, and by the way... - Yeah.
I just accepted a case referred by the pro bono committee of the l. a. City bar.
of course you have. - Nobody else would take it, so I volunteered.
Oh, yeah. Zero cash flow in exchange for a ton of man hours?
that's... - We have the resources, cliff!
enjoy picking my pocket while you still got the chance!
so, why do you think your scholarship was taken away from you?
I don't know why my scholarship was taken away.
I still say it's the cindy thing.
I'm sorry. What is "the cindy thing"?
she was the number-one player until I beat her out two weeks ago.
she was pretty pissed.
well, the school is saying that you committed a code-of-conduct violation.
do you think this girl's accusing you of cheating?
never really got along.
and this is the only communication you've had from the administration?
I live for the team, and they didn't even have the decency to confront me to my face.
my parents...
they can't afford westminster.
if I lose my scholarship...
I'll have to drop out.
I know this is a really hard time, but... Try not to worry, okay?
we're going to do everything we can.
the thing is, Beth...Beth, the thing is...
it was wrong of me to assume that you wrote that fantastically sexy mash note.
God, why is this apology turning me off?
talking to your tea bag?
Yeah, you've tipped over, dude.
me? - No worries, mate. I'm fine.
Ah, really? You don't seem fine.
no, I'm... I'm in court today.
I'm just practicing my argument, seeing if it holds water.
you look a little tired, though. Your eyes are all puffy.
Yeah, well, heavy case load.
but that's how I stay head and shoulders above the rest, my friend.
Yeah, what are you, about... About 6'1"?
try 6'3." Oh, come, come.
I'm 6'2." Which is shorter than 6'3."
I don't think you're a whole inch taller than I am.
no. - What? No.
three is more than two. - What do you got?
what do you got? Let's make it interesting.
okay, come on. - Oh, please.
it's not about the shoulder pads. - It's about the head. Turn around.
I know that first-year associates are competitive, but...
actually measuring each other?
I suppose I should be glad your belts are still buckled.
gentlemen, do you remember that big train wreck in san dimas?
the engineer fell asleep at the controls, derailed a 26-car freight train?
no casualties, millions in property damage and lost cargo.
that's the one.
we now represent that engineer.
he's facing numerous criminal charges and 25 years to life.
didn't the guy have drugs in his system? - Yes, he did.
but he swears there's an explanation.
he is also a single dad with no criminal record and no history of work-related accidents.
which makes this whole thing smell to me like an aberration.
if he is assigned a public defender, he's toast.
so, what I'm looking for is a broad-shouldered young hero who will step up and help this poor soul.
which one of you is taller?
the westminster board decided it would be in the best interests of Miss Mayfield and the college to keep a lid on this matter until the charges were either proved or disproved.
how can we disprove anything?
we don't even know what the charges are.
do you have a factual basis for the revocation, or are you solely acting on rumor and speculation?
a steroid accusation was made.
so we decided we had to investigate.
we tested her blood sample that she was required to give at the start of the season.
and did hannah's blood sample come back positive for any illicit substances?
no.
but it did yield a surprising result...
one that led us to request an extensive chromosome analysis.
chromosome analysis? What for?
we believe hannah mayfield is actually a man.
the fact that they used our client's blood to determine gender without her permission violates both her rights to privacy and bodily integrity.
college and university appeal boards are not subject to the same standards of due process as the courts.
moreover, all scholarship recipients are bound to comply with any testing deemed necessary by the college's medical advisory.
even so, your honor, the blood test they used is by no means a dispositive indication of gender.
the "y" chromosome, originally thought to be found only in men, is actually present in about 7, 500 women in the united states alone.
on the constitutional issues, I have to side with Mr. Levin.
your client waived her rights when she signed those scholarship papers.
however, I don't see that westminster college has proved that ss mayfield can be considered, genetically or otherwise, a man.
I therefore grant the injunction and order that her scholarship be reinstated.
miss fisher? - Yeah.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
um... This is not recreational.
I have weak core muscles.
I was just trying to...
...squeeze in a little exercise.
I have an assignment that requires the utmost discretion.
discretion is my middle name.
no doubt you've heard the rumors regarding the sudden departure of katie campbell.
I heard she got a promotion.
Yes. Yes, she did.
after she had an affair with cliff.
I so did not want to know that.
in order to guard against potential fallout litigation,
I want you to interview cliff...
as soon as possible.
me? - yes.
cliff. Really? - Susan recommended you.
she said that your work on the asbestos case...
was exceptional.
so she knows about all of this.
for obvious reasons, she's taken herself out of the loop.
okay.
okay? - Okay.
okay.
uh, remember, rule number one...
diretion.
all right.
Oh, my god.
I'm dead.
I must have dozed off and missed the track change.
next thing I knew, the train crumpled like a stack of dixie cups.
I'm just thankful no one got hurt.
and you admitted to taking your son's adhd medication to stay awake.
the only reason I took them was because I had been working two weeks straight.
I had no idea the hyperactivity meds would make me fall asleep.
why didn't you just ask your supervisor for the day off?
dnt rail laid off 40% of their employees 6 months ago due to the economy.
the guys who made the cut were told to pick up the slack or else.
did management actually say that?
not in so many words, but, uh, the general attitude was "do whatever it takes to get the job done."
and there's other employees on the job taking drugs to stay awake?
a lot of us were, yes.
look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.
you're in a tough spot. Mr. Bennet...
please.
I know what I did was wrong.
I'll do anything to make restitution.
but my, uh...
but my son...
I'm all he's got.
I can't let him end up in foster care.
I'll do my best, Mr. Shea.
mind if I pick your brain?
that would be a very long and sordid enterprise.
if you had to question someone scary...
I mean really scary...
how might you approach that?
you talking about cliff? - I didn't...
how did you... Know that?
it's all right.
I always know everything first.
please feel free to spread that around.
look, when it comes to questioning cliff...
I don't think I can do it.
Yes, you can!
now, listen, you're smart, you're capable, and you're too little to hit.
listen...
the truth is, you're the one who can walk the tightrope.
okay, so what's your plan?
I am going to bake him a cake.
cake? - Yeah.
sweetheart, you might want to think that through.
well, I did.
I'm an exceptionally good baker.
and my cakes are irresistible.
Plus, it will put him at ease.
and let's be honest...When is offering someone dessert ever a bad idea?
you think the prince of darkness likes sprinkles?
uh, I-i'm not sure, but, uh, good luck with that.
thank you, guys, so much for everything.
Yeah. You guys were great in there.
we're just glad it all worked out.
congratulations on your victory, however short-lived.
what are you talking about?
well, now that Miss Mayfield is once again subject to the westminster college code of conduct, we must verify that she's in full compliance of all the terms and conditions of her scholarship.
uh, this is a formal written demand that your client submit to a gender-verification test.
excuse me.
why are you pressing this so forcefully?
this is a sponsored scholarship intended for a woman.
some of the board members have expressed discomfort at her status.
they say it tarnishes our sports program.
so a gender test. What if we refuse?
then Miss Mayfield forfeits her scholarship.
believe me, it's nothing personal.
yeah? - Rachel Esposito?
I'm Malcolm Bennet from sterling huddle oppenheim & craft.
I'm here to discuss Douglas Shea, the engineer who crashed the train.
uh, come in, Mr. Bennet.
"Malcolm," please.
well, Malcolm, I have half an hour and a sandwich, so, if we could speed this along?
Absolutely.
my client admitted culpability, he expressed public remorse, he has no prior convictions, and, what's more, he's a single dad trying to raise his 8-year-old son.
so what do you say to time served, plus probation?
I say,"dream on."
what, did you think you could just waltz in here, flash that smile, and attempt to dictate terms to me?
I'm not attempting a - any such thing.
I'm just trying to let you know that my client...
your client wrecked a cargo train...
that caused millions in damage.
people could have been hurt.
this case was headline news.
there's no way I'm gonna have my name associated with some sweetheart deal.
is that what you're really concerned with, rachel?
your image?
I'm a public servant, Malcolm.
I represent the people.
and in this case, the people want justice.
this is me... Eating lunch...
alone.
my card "nothing personal"?!
how can you say it's nothing personal?
this couldn't be more personal.
unfortunately, according to the terms and conditions of your scholarship, they're completely within their rights.
what up,"crying game"?
what the hell isrong with you?!
I'm not the one that did it! - Did what?
look at this.
Oh, my god.
Yes, and the school said they would investigate.
but you can't go slam a guy up against a wall.
I'm sorry, but...
look, growing up, my dad wasn't around.
so I get leaned on a lot.
suffice it to say, I don't like bullies.
I went to an all-girls school.
and it was "lord of the flies."
and, to be honest, I was kind of a bully.
a world-class mean girl. mm.
thankfully, I've grown out of that.
okay, I'm a work in progress.
Hey! Drop the forks!
I need that cake for professional reasons.
what have you done?!
this was going to be my opening gambit.
what opening gambit? - You know what?
it... Doesn't matter. Next time, respect the sticky.
okay?
who reads the sticky?
who leaves a sticky?
Mr. Bennet.
how's it going with your engineer case?
good.
I, um, ran into a minor speed bump with the d. a.but... I'm working on it.
Mr. Priory has come to your aid with a brilliant maneuver.
basically, we will attack on two fronts...
both criminal and civil.
since your case seemed a little thin to begin with,
I thought I'd do some research, help you out.
I concluded that we can file a civil suit against dnt rail for violating state and federal law by creating an unsafe work environment in violation of osha...
the occupational safety and he...
I know what osha means. - Oh, good.
introducing a civil lawsuit is certain to draw even more media attention, given the already heated situation.
which might influence the jury pool before your criminal trial even begins.
not to mention that the burd of proof is less on the civil side.
and if we win, you can use it at trial.
sounds a little desperate to me.
I prefer to think of it as... Unorthodox.
which is precisely why I like it.
Mr. Priory, you will head up the civil claim while Mr. Bennet continues the criminal case.
keep each other apprised, gentlemen.
remember, we are all after the same thing.
who's taller now?
excuse me, Mr. Huddle?
sorry to bother you.
I was hoping we could schedule a time for me to ask you some questions?
close the door.
so you're Hart's grand inquisitor.
I made you cake.
no utensil? - Excuse me?
you baked me a cake, presumably so I may eat it.
but you failed to bring me a fork.
um, should I go... - no.
might as well get this over with, huh?
go ahead.
you're not gonna tape this.
Oh, then, how do I... - Take notes!
okay.
when did you first meet Katie Campbell?
I have no idea.
was it perhaps january 3rd of lasyear?
that's when you first interviewed her.
let's just say that, then.
okay, so, how long after that first interview did your...
intimate interaction begin?
my intimate interaction? - Please, I'm trying here.
an approximation would be fine.
one month? Two months?
I really don't remember.
Mr. Huddle, I've been charged by a senior partner of this firm to take your statement.
and according to the articles of partnership, you are obliged to answer my questions as truthfully as possible.
good.
at least you're earning your salary...
for as long as that lasts.
sit down.
go ahead.
to answer your question, Katie and I have been having "intimate interactions..."
for the st four or five months.
Oh.
what? - Nothing.
no, you said something. You said,"oh."
"Oh" means something. What?
I'm sorry, it's just, anything over three months has to be considered a relationship, not an affair.
citing what legal precedent?
Oh, I wasn't speaking as a lawyer.
I was speaking as a woman.
all right. Wait a minute.
you're saying, as a woman, you would find it harder to forgive your partner's indiscretion if it lasted four months rather than three?
anything over three months is more than a fling.
there were feelings there.
unless you're not a feelings guy.
what up, player? - Gonna eat your heart.
grouchy is not a good color on you, broheim.
I'm sorry, Rowdy. - I'm sorry, too.
for what?
for whatever's going on between you and Liam and your... Private little thang.
how do you do that?
instinct.
so?
well, he got this note, this steamy come-on, and he thought it was from me.
it wasn't? - no!
he's been with a lot of women. Well...
okay? You know, i he's... He's he's catnip.
that lad is like catnip for women.
exactly.
and I can't help it.
it makes me feel scared and exposed and insecure, like nothing I am or could ever be will be fresh and new, because there's always...
why am I telling you this here in the hall?!
because... Because somewhere deep down inside of you, you understand that I am an instinctual emotional genius, capable of solving even the thorniest of romantic problems.
now, what can I do for you?
nothing.
stay out of it.
I want a boyfriend who can fix his own problems in a relationship.
otherwise, what's the point of having one?
that is a very smart young woman in a very tight skirt.
see you found my lunchtime getaway spot.
your spot?
the building manager told me he put this hoop up here for his kids.
Yeah, but I pay them 20 bucks to get an hour to myself every day.
that's cool. If you're embarrassed by your game, I can go embarrassed.
hardly.
let me ask you a question.
why did you feel obliged to horn in on my case?
I'm not horning in on your case.
I'm trying to generate an alternative cause of action for the sake of the client.
which will make you look really good in front of Hart.
look.
I suggest, for the good of the client, that we put our competition aside and work together.
I got no problem teaming up.
just got a problem with show-offs.
you know, guys who are only out to impress the boss?
because.
if you screw up your case, you could screw up my case.
and I'm not about to let that happen.
well, I see two flaws in your argument.
one.
I'm not a show-off.
and two.
you got no idea who you're dealing with.
neither do you.
that was a travel.
the test results are back.
of the five experts, two concluded you were female, two concluded you were male, and one was undecided.
so what does that mean?
well, the technical term for someone in your situation is "intersex."
it refers to someone who's not strictly male.
or female.
so, what?
I'm some kind of freak?
no, of course not.
what about my scholarship?
unfortunately, the terms explicitly specify the recipient must be female.
is this where you tell me this is all a joke?
that I'm, like, being punked?
I wish we could.
no, don't you see?
everything I worked for is gone!
God, no, this just isn't fair!
this is how god made me!
what am I supposed to do now?
what am I supposed to do in a typical week?
it varies, but we obviously adhere to federal rules and regulations.
are you aware of accusations that your employees routinely use illegal substances while performing their duties?
our drug-testing policy is beyond reproach.
the fact is, we have a flawless record.
not a single positive test in company history.
an unblemished record.
a perfect record.
the company's clean.
spotless.
even the employee drug-test records are perfect.
not one false positive?
Nope.
Congratulations. Well done.
I don't understand.
perfection is an illusion, Liam.
much sought after but never achieved.
they're hiding something.
so you want me to keep digging?
Oh, yes.
go through all the discovery.
check and re-check the data, and then check it again.
you will find something.
so, I'll go ahead and get lunch sent to my desk, then.
and maybe dinner, as well.
nose to the grindstone, counselor.
just a little heads-up.
Addy's gonna come by later and ask you some questions.
about what?
she said that Cliff thought that you and Katie might be more than friends.
why would cliff be talking to Addy about my business?
there has been a little. How shall I put this?
uh, ass covering going on.
Addy has been tasked to damage control should there should be any legal fallout due to Katie's, uh,"reassignment."
they think Katie might sue for sexual harassment?
red ran hot. Who knows what she might do?
let me ask you something.
when you and Katie were you also aware that Cliff and Katie not until he came over the night I was there.
mm, that paints a picture.
she didn't let him in.
not that he didn't want in.
badly.
you think he came over for sex?
what conclusion would you draw?
well, cliff's position is he only came by to make sure she was okay after he broke up with her.
except she broke up with him.
do you have specific knowledge that his statement is incorrect?
no.
then I would remember that going forward.
did you just come by here to make sure my story lined up with cliff's?
and now the question portion of the evening is over.
time for a little light entertainment.
look at this.
look at this. Can he get out the door? I think he can.
2, 3,4, 5.Think quick!
you look tired.
maybe we should take a break.
are you kidding?
score's finally tied up.
I mean, I don't want to be held responsible for you collapsing due to dehydration.
so if you want to stop.
me?
you look like you're about to have a cardiac arrest.
I don't want that on my conscience.
well, as long as we're agreed you're the one who called the time-out, I can do that.
I should get that.
it could be about the case.
I knew you were soft.
interesting.
what?
give us some of your drink, and I'll tell you.
no way, dude. Cold and flu season.
well, then, I guess I don't have to share this information I just got back from the lab.
what information?
Hart told me to check and re-check all the discovery.
so I had a lab retest all the employee samples for the last six months.
And?
turns out their flawless record has a loin common with your jump shot.
they both come up seriously short.
is that your phone?
no, it's.
that's good drinkin'.
it's yours now.
Thanks, buddy.
there has to be some way we can get her back into school.
you could argue discrimination.
position Hannah as a transgendered person.
which would make her a protected class under california state law.
Hannah and I discussed it.
she doesn't want to go that way.
she feels marginalized enough.
I'd resent the hell out of anyone trying to tell me I wasn't a woman.
it's been so much worse since the gynecologist's report came back.
it turns out Hannah's also infertile.
wait a minute.
Hannah can't have kids?
try not to sound so excited when you say that.
no, no, that's not what I mean.
we're looking for a new legal angle onto our case here, and infertility ght be just what we need.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
no, no, it's. it is me
I'm still getting used to makeup.
uh, about this potential litigation.
we don't have to talk about it.
no. We don't.
okay.
if you did want to hear anything. --nothing
ever.
you might want to try rolling the brush slowly on the upward stroke.
we're. Concerned that there may be a problem with your drug testing.
what kind of problem?
while it's true every single one of your employees' samples were free from banned substances, each sample did reveal the same elevated level of uric acid, a warning sign for gout.
so?
so, either your entire company has been gorging itself on goose liver, or the samples came from the same donor.
the tests are administered at random.
the fact that a group of employees showed the same set of symptoms could be merely coincidental.
then how do you explain the fact that they all have the same genetic marker?
time to come clean, Mr. Gold
we know you've been faking employee drug tests in order to hide the use of stimulants.
$600, 000 and no admission of wrongdoing.
the settlement is completely sealed and deemed inadmissible for all future civil or criminal prosecutions.
this is an institution of higher learning.
you should be building young people up, not tearing them down.
we're sorry, but the eential terms of the scholarship have not been met.
she is technically no longer a woman.
NCAA guidelines only require an athlete to compete under the gender indicated on their government documentation.
in Hannah's case, it's female.
man: but there are more things to consider than just Miss Mayfield's interests.
there are liability issues, donor concerns.
we're just not equipped to deal with the matriculation of an intersex athlete.
you're right, there are other issues to consider.
say, the americans with disabilities act?
H - how is that relevant?
as a gender non-conforming woman with undeveloped ovaries.
a birth defect which makes her infertile.
Hannah is disabled, and therefore protected under that statute.
I seriously doubt that such legal acrobatics are gonna hold water.
well, they will until they won't.
until then, how would you like to be known as the school who discriminates against people with disabilities?
could tarnish your reputation pretty badly.
what if any major donors found out?
what is it you're after, exactly?
just what you promised hanna whenhe first came here.
the opportunity to get an education.
douglas: $600, 000?
Yes, but their offer expires at the end of the business day today.
but I'd s-still go to jail?
well, we couldn't use the evidence that would exculpate you in your criminal trial.
so, if you want the money, you'll have to sign a confidentiality agreement.
what good does money do for my son if he's in foster care?
there is.
one other thing I can do.
I can take the evidence to the d. a.
and try to negotiate a reduced sentence.
you think that will work?
there's no guarantee.
but if you don't do that, i'm definitely going to jail.
right? --yes
I only took those pills so I can keep my job.
take care of my boy.
tell them they can keep their money.
just keep me out of jail.
so, I hope you can understand that you and I, we just.
can never be.
you wanted to see me?
well, you can stop being mad.
we got to the bottom of the "secret admirer" fiasco. it is .
Yolanda in h. r.
Yolanda was the secret admirer.
I told her,"thank you very much."
I'm very flattered by your advances.
but my heart belongs to an unnamed other.
anas you may have seen, she took it very admirably.
so, all is well.
well, not really, since Yolanda is a lesbian.
she is a what, now?
she's a lesbian.
remember, we all threw down for that gift, celebrating her commitment to her wife.
did you know Yolanda in h. r.
does not dig dudes?
you didn't you tell me?
because she told me not to get involved.
I had to let you make that colossal blunder.
thank you.
but my neutrality ends there.
Beth, Liam really cares about you.
it's true that he has been with.
well, just a lot of women.
but he has chosen you.
right.
and, Liam.
Beth is that rarest of creatures.
she's someone who is worthy of the energy and effort we put into being with them.
and she has chosen you.
that's sweet.
no, no, no. This isn't about me.
it's about you'all. Now, work it out!
thus endeth the lesson!
look, I don't want you to worry about whoever it was who wrote that note.
I'm not.
good.
because I'm crazy about you.
and, although I know that you're perfectly capable of penning such a document, you never would.
probably just wishful thinking on my part.
I don't know.
an afternoon delight is nice to think about.
maybe we can meet up a little later.
that sounds positively.
supple.
great vocabulary.
what are we drinking?
we've got cosmos.
not anymore.
three tequila shots, please.
Ooh, you better make that two.
I have a motion to read.
I'll see you guys tomorrow?
okay.
-Thank you
before we get too carried away, there is a small piece of business I need to discuss with you.
you need to interview me about Cliff and Katie.
how did you know?
damn, I thought I've been totally discreet.
uh, Rowdy gave me a heads-up.
well.
is it true? You and katie?
we.
slept together.
once.
but when I found out about Cliff, I backed off.
okay, well, uh, there are still a few more details that I need for the record.
so, if we could schedule a time to sit down and.
I haven't exactly decided what I'm gonna say yet.
you don't get to decide what you're gonna say.
it's complicated.
no, it's not.
it's a delicate situation.
the truth is not delicate.
I mean, are you playing politics here?
because I didn't think you were that kind of a guy.
no, I'm not.
it's just. I would expect the runaround from Cliff, but not from you.
you know what?
we'll schedule the interview tomorrow. Okay?
what's this?
that's some data about their drug testing that dnt would love to keep quiet.
why bring it to me?
because they offered Mr. Shea 600 grand in hush money.
he turned it down.
he wants to see dnt rail held responsible for their actions.
so what do you expect in return?
well, I'm hoping that somewhere behind that stunning smile is a person who values fairness.
you don't give up, do you?
in all honesty, you ain't seen nothin'et.
so.
I'm guessing his son drew this?
it's like you said.
the people want justice.
so, who are you gonna go after?
a company that lied and broke the rules or a single dad who's just trying to raise his son?
trotting out the kid?
that's dirty pool.
a year from now, nobody's gonna care that you made an example out of my client.
but if you deliver a conviction against dnt, you've actually made the world a safer place.
think about it.
we expected you at the office to sign some papers.
come on.
good news.
we heard from the board, and they have agreed to take care of two years of your tuition.
so you can finish your degree.
thank you.
uh, for everything.
you guys have been more than just lawyers.
you've been good friends.
why am I sensing a "but" in there somewhere?
guys, uh, this is greg.
he wor for Martin Racquets.
they want to sponsor me to go pro.
Greg: Hannah's got a ton of potential.
I mean, her game's got some maturing to do, buwe like that she's a big hitter.
Yeah, Greg says I'd be crazy not to capitalize on all the publicity.
I'm guessing controversy sells tickets.
Greg, could you excuse us for a second?
sure, no problem.
what about school?
I thought you wanted to go back.
that's what've been fighting for, isn't it?
I don't want to go to a school where people can't accept me.
I go pro, make some money, and I can pick my own school.
pay for it myself.
Oh, and believe it or not, there's already several intersex players on the pro tour.
it's funny, don't you think?
uh, turns out my competitors are more accepting than the people I thought were my friends.
uh, Greg, you ready?
Greg: yeah, let's go.
okay.
thank you.
good luck.
Bye.
have you seen this morning's paper?
like I told Priory, you traded a big fish for a small fish.
how does that make you feel?
good.
but you're not disappointed we didn't get the money?
there's more important things in life than money, Malcolm.
so, how'd things end up with our engineer?
he got five years' probation, mandatory drug counseling, and a pretty strenuous community-service requirement.
jail time?
no.
and he gets to stay with his son.
a job well done for both of you.
thank you.
for you and Mr. Priory.
right.
I'm staying late to finish up some paperwork, so I ordered some burgers.
you want one?
I had a salad, but thanks.
was there something else?
look, I hope I'm not overstepping here, but, um.
are you okay?
I mean, your personal life is none of my business, except, uh, as it turns out, I'm sort of involved in it.
I know.
and they're gonna make me talk about it.
I know that, too.
I want to do the right thing, but I don't want to say anything that would hurt you.
Dylan, if you're thinking about editing your testimony to spare my feelings, don't.
you're an excellent attorney, and I'm a big girl.
of course.
are those from the apple pan?
we're lucky to have you, Dylan.
I'm just gonna grab a pot.
uh, stubbie?
just a schooner, any. A beer. Any kind of beer. Just that one
thank you.
doesn't anyone speak english in this country?
isn't that a clich?
an australian drinking an oversized beer?
Yes, I think it is.
you want one?
they're good.
thank you.
so, how goes it with your tennis player?
she's gonna make a lot of money.
and pay her way through college, which will hopefully lessen the sting.
her boyfriend broke up with her.
apparently, he couldn't take being the butt of all the jokes around campus.
Thanks, mate.
sounds like a rat.
easy for you to say.
if people starting calling me a man, I doubt you'd still be interested.
no, I'd still be interested.
after all, you would still be you.
that's one of the sweetest things anyone has ever said to me.
I declare a thumb war.
five, six, seven, eight.
try to keep your thumb straight.

BETH: Juno, are you sure this is the right way?
relax, l've never been lost in my life - Marvellous - So have you done these caves before? - No

Boreham Caves More like boredom caves - Nice parking - Thanks
HOLLY: This one time in Galway when l free-climbed the cathedral, a priest chased me down the whole of the ground floor
that was brilliant - l shouldn't have wasted the effort, though. REBECCA: Holly, shut up

Sam: Come on, keep up
Sam: Hey, Holly, wait up REBECCA: Move it, short arse

JUNO: You finally caught up with me - Juno, are we there yet? - There's a river about half a mile ahead
when we reach it, we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?
how does she know there's a river up ahead? l can't hear a thing
she can probably smell it
she came up here last week to check the route out lt's rule number one - file a flight plan and stick to it - And rule number two? - Don't go wandering off
you think it's dark when you turn out the lights Well, down there it's pitch black - You can get dehydration, disorientation - Yeah, yeah, yeah - claustrophobia - Blah, blah panic attacks, paranoia, hallucinations, visual and aural deterioration
Hey!
Yeah, lovely, Holly A real Kodak moment - Don't touch it - You wouldn't want to piss it off - What do you think did that, Sam? A bear?

REBECCA: I'm here, I'm OK. Beth, are you injured?
no, l'm fine - Nobody move until the dust has settled - Don't worry, Juno, we're not going anywhere
HOLLY: You might be right about that
REBECCA: Jesus
HOLLY: So what's the story now?
REBECCA: According to the guidebook, this cave system has three ways out
this is just one of them lsn't that right, Juno?
Juno, that's right, isn't it?
check the book - l didn't bring it - What?
no point
for Christ's sake, Juno
l knew it l knew this wasn't right
you filed a flight plan to mountain rescue? lf we don't report in, they'll come looking for us
that's how it's supposed to work except l put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns and this isn't Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?
we're in the wrong fucking cave?
Holly was right Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap - Don't try and pin this fucking shite on me! - This is not caving This is an ego trip
JUNO: Rebecca, l didn't know this was going to happen
this is exactly what we believe in
we said, if there's no risk, what's the point?
don't try and justify this
where Where are we?
lt hasn't got a name lt's a new system l wanted us all to discover it
no-one's ever been down here before - You're fucking kidding me - Oh, God!
BETH: How the hell do we get out? HOLLY: There may not be a way out
JUNO: Look, there's no going back now
we have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward
BETH: What the fuck do you think you're doing?
we all trusted you. You told me this was going to be good for Sarah
have you any idea what she's been through?
no, cos you couldn't get away fast enough, you selfish cow
JUNO: You know what, Beth?
we all lost something in that crash
just get us out of here
JUNO: Look, cave systems sometimes break ground lt's a small chance
but if we stay here, we'll die
let's go
JUNO: Wait! - What?
don't move, Sam. Just don't move
stay right there
Oh, shit No more - Thanks, Beth
now l know how far down it is
so, what now?
one of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys l have three cams, l need at least three more. Where's the other rope bag?
where is it?
we lost it, when the cave collapsed
sorry
help me
come on, Becca - Aargh! - You got it
come on, come on
JUNO: Come on, Rebecca

BETH: Juno, it's OK, we've got you
OK, pull!
BETH: Sam! SAM: Holly, let me pass
Sam: Rebecca, show me your hand
let go, let go
what does it mean? - lt means we're not the first lt's a piton, right?
lf cavers were here, there's a better chance of us getting out
this equipment is at least 1oo years old No one uses stuff like this any more
besides, if anyone had been down here and made it out, they would have named it already
JUNO: Becca, are you OK?
l'll live
Holly, how does it look?
lt's tight again, but l can get through
OK, keep going We'll be right behind you
HOLLY: Hey, there's something down here
guys, it's amazing, but the batteries on our lights will run out - So l suggest we keep moving - Wait a minute Wait - What is it, Beth? - Juno, light up one of your flares - We don't have time for this - Just light a flare - Really lovely, Beth, but it's fucking useless - No, look at it What do you see?
you've got the mountain, the cave and there's two entrances - You are a fucking genius - l have my moments - This means there's another way out? - Let's find out
come on!
bastard! - Which way?
Holly, give me your lighter - Come on - Here

come on! Come on! - Shit!
that one! - Hey! Holly!
Holly, slow down!
JUNO: Holly! Careful!
HOLLY: Daylight! l can see daylight!
Holly! Careful! Slow down!
Holly, it's not daylight!
help me! - Hold on!

Holly!
Sam! Get down here!
Holly!
Holly!
Holly! Answer me!
l think l hurt my leg!

someone better get down here!
Oh, that's fucking disgusting - Beth! Not here, not now!
we need help Everybody grab a corner We need to move her out of the water
nice and easy now. And lift!
you fuckers! - Juno, find something to make a splint out of - lt's OK, l've got her - Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes
Sam: You'll be all right, sweetheart
OK - Sarah! - Juno, l'm gonna need your help here - Sarah! - Juno!
take hold of her arm You'll have to hold her down
what are you gonna do?
l need to dress the wound and rig up a splint, but l can't while the bone is protruding l need to push it back in - l hate you - l know
do it
bite down on this - Keep hold of her - Just fucking bite down, OK?
go!
come on!
just keep biting down, baby
come on
OK, someone get me a medical kit
OK, OK, OK. Calm down. lt'll be all right - - What are you doing?
l just saw something ahead in the tunnel
Sarah, l promise you, l'm gonna get you out of here
but l can't do it unless you're with me
Sarah?
Sarah!
Sarah, look at me
there's nothing there
that's the best l can do
lt'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight on it, but at least you can move
they combed these mountains centuries ago. Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now - That is just what it looked like - What?
Sarah thinks she saw someone - Saw what?
l don't think l saw someone, l saw someone
no, you heard something and saw what you wanted to see - lt's the dark lt plays tricks on people - l can describe exactly what l saw - What did you see? - A man. I saw a man
REBECCA: Are you sure? - Yes!
and it's not the first time l thought l saw someone before, but now l'm sure
look, if there is somebody down here, then maybe they can help get us out
Sarah, there's no-one down here Forget about it!
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here
OK? This is all that matters right now - Beth! - lt's OK ls it? Fuck!

Boreham Caves More like boredom caves - Nice parking - Thanks
HOLLY: This one time in Galway when l free-climbed the cathedral, a priest chased me down the whole of the ground floor

when we reach it, we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?
how does she know there's a river up ahead? l can't hear a thing
she can probably smell it
she came up here last week to check the route out lt's rule number one - file a flight plan and stick to it - And rule number two? - Don't go wandering off
you think it's dark when you turn out the lights Well, down there it's pitch black - You can get dehydration, disorientation - Yeah, yeah, yeah - claustrophobia - Blah, blah panic attacks, paranoia, hallucinations, visual and aural deterioration
Hey!
Yeah, lovely, Holly A real Kodak moment - Don't touch it - You wouldn't want to piss it off - What do you think did that, Sam? A bear?
what is this? Nature Detectives?
lt could have been Big Foot Come on - Sam, stop poking it with a fucking stick

HOLLY: You might be right about that
REBECCA: Jesus
HOLLY: So what's the story now?
REBECCA: According to the guidebook, this cave system has three ways out
this is just one of them lsn't that right, Juno?
Juno, that's right, isn't it?
check the book - l didn't bring it - What?
no point
for Christ's sake, Juno
l knew it l knew this wasn't right
you filed a flight plan to mountain rescue? lf we don't report in, they'll come looking for us
that's how it's supposed to work except l put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns and this isn't Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?
we're in the wrong fucking cave?
Holly was right Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap - Don't try and pin this fucking shite on me! - This is not caving This is an ego trip
JUNO: Rebecca, l didn't know this was going to happen
this is exactly what we believe in
we said, if there's no risk, what's the point?
don't try and justify this
where Where are we?
lt hasn't got a name lt's a new system l wanted us all to discover it
no-one's ever been down here before - You're fucking kidding me - Oh, God!
BETH: How the hell do we get out? HOLLY: There may not be a way out
JUNO: Look, there's no going back now
we have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward
BETH: What the fuck do you think you're doing?
we all trusted you You told me this was going to be good for Sarah
have you any idea what she's been through?
no, cos you couldn't get away fast enough, you selfish cow
JUNO: You know what, Beth?
we all lost something in that crash
just get us out of here
JUNO: Look, cave systems sometimes break ground lt's a small chance
but if we stay here, we'll die
let's go
JUNO: Wait! - What?
don't move, Sam Just don't move
stay right there
Oh, shit No more - Thanks, Beth
now l know how far down it is
so, what now?
one of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys l have three cams, l need at least three more Where's the other rope bag?
where is it?
we lost it, when the cave collapsed
sorry
help me
come on, Becca - Aargh! - You got it

BETH: Juno, it's OK, we've got you
OK, pull!
BETH: Sam! SAM: Holly, let me pass
Sam: Rebecca, show me your hand
let go, let go
what does it mean? - lt means we're not the first lt's a piton, right?
lf cavers were here, there's a better chance of us getting out
this equipment is at least I oo years old No-one uses stuff like this any more
besides, if anyone had been down here and made it out, they would have named it already
JUNO: Becca, are you OK?
l'll live
Holly, how does it look?
lt's tight again, but l can get through
OK, keep going We'll be right behind you
HOLLY: Hey, there's something down here
guys, it's amazing, but the batteries on our lights will run out - So l suggest we keep moving - Wait a minute Wait - What is it, Beth? - Juno, light up one of your flares - We don't have time for this - Just light a flare - Really lovely, Beth, but it's fucking useless - No, look at it What do you see?
you've got the mountain, the cave and there's two entrances - You are a fucking genius - l have my moments - This means there's another way out? - Let's find out

but l can't do it unless you're with me
Sarah?
Sarah!
Sarah, look at me

that's the best l can do
lt'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight on it, but at least you can move

Sarah thinks she saw someone - Saw what?
l don't think l saw someone, l saw someone
no, you heard something and saw what you wanted to see - lt's the dark lt plays tricks on people - l can describe exactly what l saw - What did you see? - A man l saw a man
REBECCA: Are you sure? - Yes!
and it's not the first time l thought l saw someone before, but now l'm sure
look, if there is somebody down here, then maybe they can help get us out
Sarah, there's no-one down here Forget about it!
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here
OK? This is all that matters right now - Beth! - lt's OK ls it? Fuck!
Sam: You've got to keep warm

what are you doing?
Sam!
Sam! No!
what happened to you?
Rebecca?
what about Beth?
didn't make it
you saw her die?
come on
come on. Come on！
No! No!
Hey, Lung? What brings you here?
want me to drink with you this early?
detective, someone is following me. Someone wants to kill me.
are you serious? I don't see anyone following you.
she is following me
you have her picture. So you know who she is.
why don't you report to the police?
I don't know who she is.
where did you get this picture?
it's not your business. You just need to help me find her.
tell her that I have nothing to do with that matter. Tell her don't kill me.
she wants to kill you? Why?
I don't know.
do you know where she lives?
no. If I know where she lives I don't need your help.
you want to chase this girl, right?
you don't know where she lives.
so you come up with this lame story that she wants to kill you, and have me dig out her address?
no!... Yes, she is following me.
I don't know what you're talking.
Hey, are you drunk? Go home
take this picture and go home.
keep it nicely.
you have my phone number?
call me when you have any news.
this is all the money I have.
I have nothing to do with that matter at all.
lung, wait.
give me the picture.
don't you?
hey Detective.
you are buying me a dinner. You have the money now!
talk less and just order your food. I'll pay the bill.
Hey, give him a bowl of dumplings and a dark coffee
sure.
give this back to you.
this is good! You got a job now?
I'll call you if I need help.
great. Pay back more if you can.
I need money for the New Year.
you're just kidding. I think you get enough under table
not really. We watch over China Town only.
not as gainful as elsewhere.
why don't you work with me? I guarantee you a raise.
a raise? Work with you?
you're damn broke.
what do you want me to do? Catch a cheating spouse again?
I can't tell you now. It's called code of ethics.
let see how long you can hold.
excuse me, do you know this lady?
who are you looking for? Let me see.
Oh, is this Sum?
this picture was taken at my place.
see, this guy playing mahjong is Ming.
why are you looking for her?
we were friends but we haven't seen each other for a long time.
I want to find her now.
I just came back from The States
how come you have this picture?
well, she sent me this picture long time ago.
but I lost her address...
I haven't seen her for a while.
she hasn't come to mahjong 2 weeks or so
maybe she goes on vacation with Ming.
don't let Ming know your woman.
that bastard keeps chasing every girl
cut the crap.
I just played mahjong here with Ming a few days ago
does anyone know where Sum lives?
I know. She lives nearby.
do you know Siu Siu Restaurant?
she lives across the restaurant.
great. Thank you. Boss.
you're welcome. Just call me Uncle Cheung is fine.
nice to meet you. I am Tam.
take a picture!
are you looking for Sum?
yes -Who are you?
I am her friend.
I think she moved already.
right, I haven't seen her for a long time.
do you know where she moved?
no.
that's bad!
would you mind give me a call if she comes back?
you two look alike. Are you sisters?
no
do you live upstairs?
I live on 5
going to the market now? Yes
just go for a walk. The weather is good
thank you
you're welcome
this person looks honest. Yes
I think I saw him in the market a few days ago
Really? That's strange
tam
sum is not home, right?
yes
ming has another place. Try again.
what?
this is the address. I don't want them always bother Ming.
I have enough of that woman!
Hey, did you move the body?
you know this dead man, Ming, right?
I don't know him.
I was just looking for him on behalf of my client.
okay. You said when you came in the door was half closed, and when you came up, did you bump into someone on the stairs?
Yes, I think that person killed Ming and tried to leave in a hurry.
don't tell me you're a detective.
did you hear what the coroner said?
he said the man died one or two days ago.
no suspicious cause of death.
judging from the scene it could be a suicide.
somehow I feel something is not right.
you look something is not right on you Sir, I found a phone under the pillow on the bed in the room
wow, this guy had a lot of women.
can I have a look?
take a look if your woman is there?
can you send the picture to my phone?
I have my code of ethics.
should I delete the pictures before I give this phone back to his wife?
you can do your investigation.
but don't do it so openly.
many of these women are married.
may be one of the husbands discovered the affair and got someone to kill him.
you come to buy me a dinner?
not a problem.
can you tell me anything about your progress in Ming's case.
that guy was extremely popular among women.
those women knew he was married but still kept running around him.
don't tell me something I can read from the newspaper.
I want to know the inquest report.
the inquest report said there were only wounds caused by hanging.
no other sign of fatal injuries
what does that mean?
this means the man killed himself.
as I said, I can tell from the scene that it was suicide.
I met someone hurrying down the stairs.
and the door was half closed.
how can you explain these?
we checked the door but there was no sign of breaking in.
maybe the deceased did not close the door properly when he killed himself.
I don't think the person you met is the killer.
the coroner said the deceased was dead for at least two days.
maybe that person wanted to come back to check if Ming was dead for sure
good imagination!
did you find out why Ming killed himself?
Yes, his wife said he lost a lot of money in the stock market.
he committed suicide due to a relationship.
Hmm... I still feel that his death is not that simple.
so, the case is closed?
what else do you want?
we've done our investigation and there is nothing suspicious.
we are very busy.
not like you boring enough to investigate for nothing... Detective.
if I am not seriously shortsighted, I am already a police officer.
I could be your boss too.
if Ming was murdered, then the killer was an expert.
an expert killer... who makes a murder look like a suicide
what are you thinking? Take it easy.
Oh well, let see if someone is smarter than me...
Hey, you said you'd buy me a dinner.
are you Ming's wife?
Yes, and you are?
I am Detective Chan.
I've already told your colleague everything I know.
I have some more questions.
did your husband invest in the stock market with other people?
did he have any argument with anyone recently?
I think he invested together with somebody.
with who?
I'm not sure. I never asked him about these.
but I heard him talking in the phone and said something like if the stocks kept falling, it'd be big trouble.
can you show me the letters that your husband received recently?
sure.
are there any statements or letters about the stock investments?
I don't think so.
any debt collector came to your house?
no.
did your husband give you anything recently?
Yes.
what is it?
he gave me some money.
please do me a favor, don't pretend to be a cop ever again.
I can't help you if anything happens
how do you know I'd go to Ming's house?
we grow up together. I can read your mind
you said Ming killed himself because he lost a lot of money in the stock market.
but his wife said he gave her some money before he died.
so this reason is invalid.
if you said he killed himself because of a relationship, it's even more ridiculous.
you think this kind of person will kill himself for love?
I am not as imaginative as you. I just follow the evidence.
if the cause of death is not suspicious, I will not make assumptions
chak, it's him. I met him on the stairs We are police officers. We need to use your car
be careful.
what do you thinking you are doing?
don't mess around.
that guy ran away when he saw me, Something is wrong with him.
watch out!
watch out! Watch out!
watch out! Shut up, Calm down. Damn it!
the elephant is dead?
an elephant can't survive a crash like this!
uncle Cheung.
Oh, it's you. Did you find Sum?
no. I come here to see if she ever comes again.
no
how much do you know about Ming?
do you know any other women are close to him?
he just liked flirting with women and was not a bad person after all.
I heard that he had a lot of affairs.
but what I saw personally was just Sum and him.
they were not shy about their relationship
Hey, it's your turn.
uncle Cheung, I'm leaving now.
you are leaving early today.
thank you
why are you following me?
I know to know more about Ming.
we are not close friends. I know nothing.
you are not close friends?
I saw an intimate picture of you and him in his phone.
please, don't tell anyone.
if my husband knows about this, I'll be dead.
do you want money?
no, I just want...
Hey, don't misunderstand.
I just want to know more about what happened on Ming.
actually I don't know too much.
about two weeks ago he called me and wanted to borrow some money to repay his stock margin.
that's the first time I know about his stock investment.
but the amount was big.
I didn't have the money.
do you know if he bought stock with someone else?
how would I know? I don't know his friends.
but I wrote him a cheque to repay bank interest once.
he asked me to give the cheque to a bank teller called Poon So Fong.
he said he invested with her together.
do you know this bank teller?
Yes. I put money in that bank too
any picture of her?
I know he has a lot of women.
but I never think it is really that many.
this is she.
do you know where she lives?
no, I don't know much about her
Hello, Chan's Private Detective
tam, this is Wing
you need to help me
wing? Help you?
who are you? I...
someone wants to kill me!!
Hey, Big Head can you help me trace the previous call? Where was it from?
what? You want me to help you trace a call?
do you know how much you still owe me?
pay me first!
Hello, this time is a matter of life and death.
you must help me one more time I will pay you back for sure
alright! I trust you this time
what are you doing?
why did you go there?
someone called me and asked me to help him.
but he hung up before telling me what happened.
something was not right so I traced the call.
I found his address and went there to see what's going on.
but when I rang the door bell, the explosion blast off.
he said in the phone that he was Wing, and he said someone wanted to kill him.
I don't know who he was.
do you think he was murdered?
you really have a craving for crime investigation.
you think every case is murder, right?
but this time... you could be right.
his name was Wing, a stockbroker.
we checked the scene and his death looked suspicious.
initial examination found many stab wounds on his body.
the cause of explosion could be a leakage of gas in the kitchen, probably because of the overflowing congee in the cooking pan.
you rang the doorbell and triggered the explosion.
he couldn't survive anyways.
whether the stab wounds or the explosion killed him, we'll find out soon.
an elephant can't survive a crash like this.
anyone was there besides Wing?
no.
where do you want to go?
I want to go back to the explosion scene.
damn it! I have to warn you!
I warn you not to investigate anymore.
you really think you are a professional detective?
then why can't you find your parents after all these years?
please don't do anymore investigation!
have you seen my mom and dad?
they didn't come home for a few days already Your parents are missing. Maybe they are dead.
how may I help you?
is Miss Poon So Fong working here?
Poon So Fong.
I'm sorry. She took a day off today.
can you tell me where she lives?
I'm sorry that we cannot tell you.
I know. But I am...
what's the matter?
manager, this gentleman wants to have Fong's address.
how are you? I am the manager of this bank. My name is Chan.
I'm sorry that we cannot disclose our staff's information.
I understand. I am Detective Chan. This situation is like this.
a few days ago there was an accident and an old lady was run over by a taxi that old lady was badly injured.
she just asked us to come here to look for Miss Poon.
so I need to tell Miss Poon to go to the hospital urgently.
Hello, may I ask if Miss Poon So Fong lives here?
Yes. Are you looking for her?
mom, someone wants to see you. Come in.
please have a seat.
mom, someone wants to see you.
maybe she is asleep.
is your mom sick?
I am not sure.
this morning she didn't get up to make breakfast for me.
when I came back from school I didn't see her come out either.
did your teacher penalize you and make you write this?
no, Mom asked me to write for her.
why did she ask you to do this?
she said she did something wrong and got penalized.
did she say what she'd done wrong?
Yes, she said she killed someone!
don't touch those things.
don't tell me you come here to investigate but you don't know the deceased.
you have to believe me. I really don't know her.
I came here because I found that she purchased stocks with Ming.
I investigated the man you said who killed Ming.
he is a professional burglar.
he just stole a car on the day he met us.
you want to say this lady was murdered, right?
don't be silly.
you already found that she purchased stocks with Ming.
it is possible that she killed herself because she lost too much money.
what do those words on the wall mean?
I haven't finished.
it is also possible that, like her son said, she killed someone so she killed herself because she was afraid of punishment.
if she killed someone, who did she kill?
maybe she killed...
wing? You don't have to worry.
we will investigate. Okay?
sir, I find a box.
Fong is so silly.
if she owed the bank money, she could repay slowly.
that day Fong opened a margin account with Ming and another person called Choi.
the correspondence address is Choi's.
how much money did they lose?
about a million.
but they repaid the debt recently.
I'm not sure if they have other debts elsewhere.
are you looking for someone?
Yes, is Choi living here?
Yes, are you a debt collector as well?
no, I am his friend.
a lot of debt collectors come to him?
quite a lot a while ago. But not recently.
last night I heard him arguing with a woman.
he said something like he was not involved, why should he repay etc.
he is back.
someone wants to see you. He is at the door.
who is that?
lung?
who are you?
detective Chan
detective Chan? What brings you here?
come in. Come in.
are you okay?
when did you come in?
you opened the door and let me in.
wake up.
do you remember you asked me to investigate a woman for you?
I asked you to investigate a woman? What woman?
I'm in trouble. Someone wants to kill me.
I know. This one.
lung, Are you crazy!?
look at yourself. You are like the God of Death.
whoever you find will die. Three were dead in just a couple of days.
you came out from hospital then you went to do your investigation.
why don't you go home and take a rest instead?
now you've made a mess.
who is this man Choi?
why did you look for him?
I can't even believe myself.
this man was the person who invested together with Ming and Fong.
what's more, he was Lung, who hired me to investigate a woman for him.
you don't even know who hired you to do a job?
I met him in the bar.
everyone in the bar called him Lung.
so I only know him as Lung.
he was a butcher in the market.
I don't know his real name.
okay, now you tell me that,
Choi jumped off the building right?
did he jump himself, or did someone push him?
if you say he was murdered, I'll arrest you now, because there were only you and him on the roof.
what did Choi ask you to investigate?
he came to me and took out a woman's picture.
he said the woman followed him all day and wanted to kill him. He asked me to find out the woman.
this is she. Everyone calls her Sum.
she was very close to Ming.
if you could find her, the case is closed.
that's it.
then why do you still have to investigate the cause of death of Ming?
ming and Fong are found to have killed themselves.
why do you go to see Choi?
I just know where she lives.
I haven't seen the woman in the picture yet.
I feel that this woman is not that simple.
maybe she is the expert killer that I mentioned.
I can't find her. Can you help me to investigate?
you want me to beat you up?
calm down!
she could be related to the deaths of Ming, Fong and Lung, because Lung said she wanted to kill him.
detective. Do you have a delusion?
you said when Choi came to you he looked like he was drunk!
can you treat this as a missing person case and investigate?
sure, but no one comes to report a missing person case.
you take care of yourself first, please.
what's wrong with me?
do you know you are the prime suspect in pushing Choi down the building?
sign here. Go home
I want to report a case.
my friend is missing.
lunatic!!
are you looking for me?
who are you?
I am Sum.
uncle Cheung!
Oh, is you!
why is it so quiet today?
something evil is going on.
I have four mahjong friends died in a row.
everyone is scared and won't come to play anymore.
four mahjong friends died in a row?
Yes, Ming, Fong, Hung and Lung. Too many deaths.
uncle Cheung, what kinds of people come here to play mahjong?
could be anyone. Most of them are neighbours.
some come from other places
did Sum come recently?
if she comes I'll certainly let you know.
what?
nothing, I am just curious.
ming, Fong, Lung were partners.
then, how did Wing relate to them?
there was an explosion in Wing's house.
does that mean...
what the heck?
why do you come here?
let me tell you, this is a murder scene.
we have confirmed that Wing was stabbed to death.
the killer could be Fong, because we found Wing's skin debris in Fong's fingernails.
I have also checked on the woman you asked me to investigate.
her name is Mok Wai Sum. She has no family or relatives.
she has some money. No record of leaving this country.
could it be possible that Fong did not kill Wing?
maybe both of them, and Ming were all killed by Sum.
it is possible because Lung said Sum wanted to kill him.
your client Lung is dead.
why do you still want to investigate this woman?
listen, I won't investigate Sum anymore.
are you clear? I am warning you
then why do you come here?
do you want me to drag you away?
ming, Fong, Lung, Wing, Sum
they all killed themselves because they lost a lot of money.
but all of them left some money behind.
wing was a stockbroker.
he was murdered.
both Fong and Sum had affairs with Ming.
sum did not leave the country.
lung came on July 1 3 and said that Sum followed him and wanted to kill him.
wing called me for help.
there was a woman's voice in the phone.
a neighbour heard Lung argued with a woman the night before his death.
is the woman who talked with Lung and Wing the same person?
ming, Fong, Lung, Sum, Wing were all mahjong friend at Uncle Cheung's grocery store.
they probably know each other.
but then why did Lung said he did not know Sum?
who is the man with eyes only in the photo?
Hello, Detective Chan.
I just passed by Sum's house.
I heard someone inside.
I think Sum is back.
Oh, thank you.
wait. I heard a man's voice inside...
it's not your business. It's dangerous.
go home first. I'm coming over now.
what? It's dangerous? Then you'd better come quickly!
how may I help you?
I want to see Manager Chan. I met him last time.
he is on leave today.
how may I help you?
I want to ask about your bank's procedures if someone wants to withdraw large amount of cash.
okay. Maybe our Assistant Manager could help.
please wait.
okay, thank you.
please come with me.
let's say a customer normally writes cheques about a hundred thousand, but suddenly writes a cheuqe of hundreds of thousands or even millions, in order to protect the customer, we'll call the customer for verification.
if we cannot get in touch with the customer, we will verify the customer's signature at least by two staff.
we will cash the cheque only if we are able to confirm without doubt
Mr. Chan, what do you need this information for?
I just want to know more about how your bank handles cheques.
excuse me. Hello, Chak?
I'm busy at this moment. Can I call you back?
okay, I am really busy.
I'll call you back. It won't take long alright.
still got things to do.
the man with eyes only is the Assistant Manager Hung.
that means he is related to all these deaths
I just need to follow him and could probably find an answer to all these mysteries.
no matter he is the next person who kills himself, or the next victim, or even the killer, I think I can find an answer from him.
if he is the next victim, I can find the killer by following him.
the mysterious person could be the killer.
I am in danger as well.
thank you.
I'll let you know if I have something good.
keep in touch.
I am Detective Chan from the Commercial Crime Investigation Team.
I need some information about the man who handed in the cheque.
I know his name is Kwong Chi Hung.
can I have his recent stock transaction records?
I'm not sure about his past records
his transaction record was kept by one of our colleagues.
but he passed away a few days ago
what was his name?
Kwan Sai Wing. What are you looking at? Who are you looking for?
get out, get out!
why are you following me? I know that you are not a cop.
please don't follow me anymore.
Hello, Chak.
Hello, where are you?
that woman is the killer!
huh! Are you playing another game?
I am playing the game of life. I can't tell you the details now.
send someone to save me. Hurry up!
you survived!
hurry up! It is so stinky here!
bear with it.
you bear with it! Hurry up!
turn on the lights.
don't say I am not telling you...
the body is confirmed to be Sum.
the body is confirmed to be Sum.
but we also found a pair of skeletons in the same scene.
we are waiting for the inquest report to see if they are related.
now the prime suspect is, the man with eyes only in the picture
don't worry. It's okay. I'll call you later.
Mr. Kwong Chi Hung, this is Detective Chak from Homicide Department.
I'll call you back later.
we believe you are connected with a murder.
please come with us.
clean up the mess Lung, work harder!
after you clean up the mess don't touch other things in the room.
I fake her signature and work with Fong to take her money.
then we all have money to repay the debt.
Chak.
let him go. Let him go.
don't come over.
stop it. Stop.
let him go. Let him go.
stop it. Stop. Let him go.
if I know this, I should have killed you with the freezer. Don't move. Everyone don't move.
I'll shoot if you say one more word.
tam, don't move. Calm down.
we can talk.
let him go.
Tam. Don't move.
don't shot.
call the ambulance. Hurry up
are you crazy? You asked me not to move.
what if you shot me?
he had a gun in his hand.
it's a fake gun. I used it to scare him.
then you go to see him.
my gun is real.
don't point it to me.
you bastard. You are pretending to be a cop again?
play with a fake gun.
play with it.
is he dead? Is he dead?
he's dead not you.
you'll regret sooner or later. How do I know it's a fake gun?
you said I am crazy. I think you are crazy
did I do something wrong?
why do you call me so urgently?
remember the pair of skeletons we found?
we confirmed they are not related to Hung's case.
Really? That means there is another big case?
the inquests report shows that they belong to a man and a woman.
both were killed more than 30 years ago.
Oh my god! A murder case thirty years ago?
a man and a woman? More than 30 years ago?
could it be...
we need to do more examination first.
it is possible, right?
you don't have to comfort me.
so many years have come and gone.
I think they were already...
never mind... Iet's eat...
in hindsight if you are not so involved in the investigation and take a suicide case as a murder case we can't find out that this Beijing girl was murdered.
you're right it looks like the whole incident is pre-determined by the unknown Almighty.
when Lung came to my place the other day, I already felt that something was wrong.
what do you think... did Ming and Lung kill themselves, just like Fong.
because they were afraid of punishment?
what I heard from my dad is strange things always happen when you investigate this kind of case.
let's talk about you.
why did you go to that stinky ditch?
she wants to kill me.
I think I just saw Sum.
she wants to kill me.
blue for constancy.
flesh for flesh. Straw for plenty.
red for justice.
the Palace of Whitehall London 1638
your cousin Harry is the envy of my court.
let's ask God to bless this union.
on the night of my birth, a comet appeared in the sky and bells rang out.
a girl.
the bells did not herald my birth... but the killing of my mother's Catholic priest.
for Catholicism in England was seen as high treason.
cousin Harry was my father's heir, and my childhood playmate.
this is where my mother's priest used to come and go.
follow me, Harry.
be brave.
mother?
mother?
Harry and I have a play to show you.
two birds that grow up and marry.
mother?
I am your servant.
instruct me.
mother?
the Virgin Mary told my mother to leave me behind and go to a nunnery in France.
Angelica...
it is Our Lady's will that I give my life over to God.
my bible is my farewell gift to you.
please don't leave me!
this was the day I lost my mother and put my soul into the balance.
if there be a God that steals mothers, strike me down!
there is no God! There is no God!
why do you weep, Angelica?
only for joy that this day has finally come.
make her ready.
Harry, I've heard the Queen say Angelica was wild as a colt when first she came to Court.
her mother went to a nunnery in France, Highness, and then her father died.
for a year or two, she was not herself.
they tell me she saw devils.
she was but a child, my Lord!
it was her mind was wild, not her.
a wild bedfellow then.
I do love to see a woman with spirit, and a man to break it.
she needs not be broken, my Lord.
in faith I hope she be broken, Harry, in this very night.
she's played false else.
your work awaits you.
not work... but the purest delight to me, my Lord.
angelica Fanshawe is a delight to all men, Harry.
it's nothing, Angelica.
if it is nothing then why may I not see?
shall Honest John Lilburne... not speak the truth about this King that tells us God gave him his throne?!
I say to you, he is a tyrant that will not let his Parliament sit!
Charles Stewart has no divine right.
for writing this I am whipped!
will you recant, John?
the King promises your freedom if you'll renounce your pamphlet.
my liberty is his to take... but not to give.
I am free-born John Lilburne!
beg him to recant, madam!
do not recant, John.
plague Pits at the Spitel Field Near London, I closed my eyes and lived in the dark, choosing not to see the world outside was sick and running mad.
read his pamphlet.
read and remember. For Justice and Liberty.
your husband, madam?
Aye. Honest John Lilburne.
whipped for raising his voice for justice and liberty.
welcome to Babylon, sir.
justice and liberty?
he is mistook, madam.
there's nought but these... since time began.
well, Sexby...
I thought you were long dead by now.
I am at your service, Highness.
no-one left to kill in Germany?
not a one left to piss against a wall, Highness.
well, you've travelled in vain. I have no need of you.
yet I heard talk of a fight to come here in England.
that the King must let his Parliament sit to be have more taxes.
that their heads buzz with grievances against him.
that this will not be settled by talk.
dear God, who is she?
remember the sewer you were born in and the hag that gave you life!
come to me later.
there is a service you may perform for me.
but there'll be no fight in England, Sexby.
may I speak with you, my Lady?
let her speak.
quickly, madam, for I am waited on at the altar.
my Lady, I am the wife of a man much misunderstood, honest John Lilburne, that was whipped just now... Whipped?
aye, most cruelly, and will die in the Fleet unless a voice like yours be raised up to help him.
wait!
you might ask a favour of her Majesty on your wedding day.
my Lady, Lilburne is the villain that writes lies about His Majesty.
madam, tell your husband there's no greater soul on this earth than the King.
he is my second father.
then Honest John must die... and there is no liberty in this land.
the garter! Yes!
the garter! Yes!
no, no, no, no!
over here! Me, Angelica! Me!
I will have them both, sir.
let me be your friend a while longer.
my boy Harry.
you'll always be my best friend.
but now I must be a husband.
and you will be the best husband a woman ever had.
what, Harry? Not at your work yet?
a drink of sack.
to make a "boy" lusty.
well, then, "my boy" Harry...
to it.
he is the King's nephew.
and a brave fighter.
you must be brave too now, Harry.
you must not call me "boy."
I will be a boy no longer.
husband, then.
Fanshawe House near Oxford
do your worst.
so Fanshawe married Fanshawe.
Harry did not wed the house and land, they were his already.
I did not wed the name that was mine already.
we married for love.
my serve, sir. Thank you.
mistress Lilburne.
my Lady looks well.
lilburne?
you have met before?
your wife was kind enough to spare a word on the day of your wedding, sir.
my husband knows not that I am here. He would not beg.
indeed. For I have read his letter.
as well as his pamphlet, The Work Of The Beast, which he was loving enough to send me as someone connected to His Majesty.
and indeed he does not beg, he demands that I intercede on the side of "justice" and "liberty."
perhaps you have not read his pages.
sir, some of the pages are mine.
John and I are of one mind and one flesh.
please, sit. You are weary.
indeed, Madam.
for I have walked from London to speak to you only the truth, I swear.
you have walked to no purpose, madam. She plays with "truth" as her husband plays with "liberty" and "justice."
I came not to play at anything, sir, but to save my husband from a slow death in the Fleet Prison.
for I know not how he will live except a voice is raised up for him, for I think the truest man in England.
and though he will not beg, I will.
his demand is only that the King let the Parliament sit so he may hear the grievances of his people.
husband? May we not hear...? We?
I fare you well, madam.
you may go.
you must never again interfere in matters you cannot understand.
give me that!
did you burn yourself?
why do you stare at me always?
wait.
when you were sent here, Prince Rupert said you were a good man for a fight.
I want you to take me to the Fleet Prison.
how will the gaoler make his living unless he bring in wine and whores?
I had thought there would be dungeons.
there are, my lady. And there with Lilburne they'll sit, except the mob that reads his pamphlets came to burn the gaol down.
I must see your face, madam.
I cannot.
we must have your face, madam, or your name.
I come to be of service to you, Master Lilburne.
how, madam?
if you would but listen, my Lady will tell you.
I wish to help you to His Majesty's forgiveness.
he's a just, wise, and merciful man.
Forgiveness?!
for I think you are a sincere and godly man.
but you do not know His Majesty's heart as I...
he had me whipped at the cart's arse from Fleet Bridge to Westminster!
would you see the stripes?!
John.
let me take to him some words of conciliation...
apologise?
John.
I?
her heart means well.
madam, I thank you, but I would rather have another 500 lashes ere I would kneel for forgiveness.
the King must listen to the voice of reason in his Parliament and dismiss his fat-witted advisors!
we shall not live like slaves!
nor shall we loll in our beds while he bring in an Irish Army or a Scotch Army to kill us!
I... I know nothing of an Irish Army.
madam.
my friend loves his crown of thorns, but God is at work in his honest heart.
if I may not know your name, know mine.
I am Thomas Rainsborough.
the means to talk a King off his throne.
king off his throne?
sirrah, I will not stay and quarrel with you for I see your life is a quarrel with itself.
when the world has turned, may you find your true nature.
how will the world be turned, sir?
when the first is last and the last is first.
and where shall I be on that day?
you will be where you choose to be.
farewell, gentle Lady.
who was the other, who had no words but "John"?
a godly man, and a good man for a committee, I am told.
sent from Cambridge to sit in the Commons.
now that at last the King permits us to sit, let my first words in this new House be on injustice.
hath not His Majesty sworn, not to deny to any man either justice or right?
then where is the justice for John Lilburne?
that rots still in the Fleet by a sentence most illegal, against the liberty of the subject, bloody, wicked, barbarous and tyrannical?!
now we sit, we must listen to these voices or they will drown out our proceedings.
I, Oliver Cromwell, petition this House that by its own authority it orders the immediate release of Honest John Lilburne!
you waste no words.
what would you have me say?
did you think me... "fat-witted"?
your journey was wasted.
you thought to bring a prize home for your husband, did you not?
he must not know.
I will bring in your bags, my Lady.
what thought you on Master Rainsborough?
if my Lady was a dinner, he would lick the plate clean.
no more?
he sees into men's hearts.
the world to turn.
how may that be, think you?
he dreams on a world where no man needs a King to govern him.
and perhaps, no woman her husband to govern her.
shall I bring in your bags, my Lady?
where got you those cuts?
fighting.
where?
wherever there are wages.
why are you here, Sexby?
why do you draw my water and carry logs to my fire?
I am waiting, my Lady.
for what?
for the killing to start.
killing?
one side will draw a sword.
it is the world.
your horse waits on its straw.
and my Lord waits on you.
you are returned.
how fares your friend?
she is...
she is much recovered, sir.
cover yourself, sirrah.
Harry.
my thoughts are with His Majesty.
a mob, urged on by traitors in the Parliament, has forced the release of Lilburne. This is anarchy.
Harry, do you not think that these grievances...?
they have no grievances.
he is the King.
they are his subjects.
of course, but might there not be...
it is not for you to think about.
we will go to London tomorrow.
his Majesty has commanded the House to give up five old dogs that have bitten him these ten years.
they still deny the King his right to rule.
they're traitors, the House must surrender them.
and what if they refuse?
he will seize them.
he will enter their Chamber?
it is his parliament.
but to use force against...
it is not for you to think about.
Harry.
will you not come to me tonight?
aye, if you will be silent.
why do men mock me?
who mocks you, Harry?
even on my wedding day, I was mocked.
a pleasure for all men.
what?
are you a whore, madam?
I'm what you see, Harry. I'm what you know me to be.
aye... by day.
but by night, what are you?
when the Devil came to you...
that you did tell me as a boy.
sir?
aye, Satan, with his tongue unfurled.
I was a girl, I...
did he enter you?
What?!
then wherefrom these noises at night?
Harry, why do we fight?
are we not Harry and Angelica, best of friends?
boy, again.
do you smell it?
it's on the wind.
the House refuses.
I will be master of my enemies.
follow me!
do not draw your sword... unless you be certain of the day.
the King comes with armed men.
gentlemen, a barge awaits you at the Watergate.
let them go, quickly.
if the King takes them, he is strong.
if he fails to take them, he is weak.
do not attack your enemy's house... if he be gone from it.
I had not thought he would do this, Thomas.
mr Speaker, I must for a time make bold with your chair.
five of your members are charged with treason.
you will point them out to me.
sire, it is not my part to see or speak anything but as this House desires me.
hear, hear!
no matter.
my eyes are as good as another's.
I can see all my birds have... flown.
know the hour.
and the minute.
and the second.
it's lost.
Harry, what is lost?
london is lost.
we leave London as soon as it is dark.
the apprentice bands are sacking houses.
the militia is out and armed.
they come here to defend their Parliament.
Majesty.
my dear, sweet girl, you must not trouble yourself.
Angelica.
concerning the Parliament men, I think they need not be your enemies, Your Majesty.
there has been a mistake.
a mistake?
I am...mistook?
a thousand apologies, Your Majesty. Her mind is wild, still.
leave us.
Wa...wa...wa...war.
edge Hill Kineton 1642
the day depends on us!
and we charge!
Where's your honour, Sexby?
where are your men?
half way to Kineton, seeking you, sir.
follow me.
you lost your men, you seek them out.
you're under my command, Sexby.
I don't take orders from boys.
how came you by that?
give it to me.
take it from me.
I can have you shot for this.
then why should I fight for you or your king?
come and fight me on the battlefield.
hold fast, John!
hold fast!
welcome to paradise, sir!
for liberty and justice!
I see your world is turning! Sir
sexby!
traitor!
he's here, Thomas.
the night has frozen his wounds.
yet he breathes.
grab his legs...
both armies gave thanks to the same god for the same victory.
and in truth, the fight at Kineton settled nothing at all.
it was only the beginning.
as the seasons turned, ever more blood was spilled in all corners of the land.
Croyland Abbey, The Fens Christmas Day 1643
you thought right, Thomas.
they look not for this, not come by floodwater.
nor on this day, Oliver.
make ready the guns, Edward.
Thomas. Must there truly be no warning?
none.
we are too few to storm them.
women and children...
Aye. They must feel terror in their hearts.
fire the first gun.
fire the first gun and reload.
fire the second.
fire the second gun and reload.
we are ready, sir.
hold.
Thomas, surely they see how few we are.
all that matter's is this man's spirit.
if I break it, your men need not draw their swords.
is this how men fight, sir?
hear this. God sent these floods to trap you.
now he sends you Rainsborough and Cromwell, like Joshua and Gideon, to drown you in fire and blood.
you cannot withstand us. We have 20 cannon.
our duty is clear, sirs.
you will command the surrender now.
if you do, you may retreat, bag and baggage when the waters go.
Sirs... else your walls will suffer more ordnance.
my engineers will dig beneath you and we will blow you all to atoms.
your men will receive no quarter.
those that breathe will go to the Indies as slaves.
decide now.
your time is borrowed, sir.
will you grant us what remains of this blessed day to pray together, Colonel Rainsborough?
no, sir.
you blaspheme by giving the Son of God a birthday party.
this is a day like any other.
the King's Court in Christ Church, Oxford
Angelica, the King asks me to tell you he has recalled Harry from the West Country.
then I can go to Fanshawe again?
no, no, child. You are to wait till Harry sends for you.
bring him in.
away!
stand.
well, speak.
sire, on Christmas Day just gone, the Abbey at Croyland was taken.
taken?
how, taken?
surrendered, sire.
to Colonels Cromwell and Rainsborough.
sire, we could not have resisted them.
Surrendered?
Without...a fight?
well...
you, sir, will never command men hereafter.
it seems now my enemies need only look upon my power and it takes to its heels.
I must tell you all, while they have more stomach than we have for the fight, none of us will see London ever again.
save yourself, madam!
what's going on? Go, go!
find them.
you'll watch them hang.
slowly.
you were not... touched?
I was never more glad to see you.
my letter was clear. You were to wait to be brought out.
I thought I was...
you thought?
you thought to pay no heed to my wishes.
men are dead because you thought.
I was wrong.
it was done because... I missed my friend Harry.
did he not miss me?
you reach for your boy.
you will not find him again.
I am Colonel Harry Fanshawe.
I am yours to command, Colonel.
Amen.
Amen.
let down your hair.
show yourself to me.
Oh, my husband...
my true, brave husband.
you are my master.
I am yours.
my true... Madam!
these are the words of the whores in my soldiers' camps!
then, Harry...
I commend to you to your soldiers... and your soldiers to their whores.
where you may command, I will ever be your dutiful wife.
where you may not, I can be nothing but what I am.
parliamentary Camp Newbury October 1644
horses for the Earl of Manchester.
does the Commander-in-Chief know our plans, General?
the King marches on us, my lord.
I have a plan to assault his guns at first peep, from behind his own lines.
we shall devise some signal for your lordship when it is time to take to the field.
I will not need your signal, Colonel Rainsborough, and I did not loll asleep, General, when you spoke your plans earlier.
I believe the King will not press the fight.
let the winter come on. Let time heal our wounds.
for myself, I'd march to Oxford and pull him from his lair.
would not you, General?
gentlemen, we must consider what we do.
if we fight the King a hundred times and we beat him 99 times he will be King still.
but if he beat us but once, we shall be hanged.
we shall lose our estates.
sir, I have none to lose.
my lord, if this be so, then why did we take up arms at first?
then let us make peace, on any terms, be it never so base.
are your men in readiness, then?
armed without and within, my lord.
I'm told... that none of your officers are men of estate, but such as are common men.
yet godly and precious, sir.
they are in this quarrel for their conscience' sake, not for pay.
I pray you look them over.
the day draws on.
I pray you.
for most surely it would raise their spirits even higher to look upon the face of their Commander-in-Chief.
for what is our purpose in this fight, but to rid England of the thieving abuses of privilege and to take back our common inheritance?
a rich man is but a man who is a burden on to other men.
even an earl is but a man.
who is this?
major Lilburne, that did fight most desperately at Kineton and in our late victory at Marston field.
Lilburne - the man who would have us all level.
will he not bow?
John... will you not bow to his lordship?
bow, sir, and all will be well.
all will not be well in this land until the Earl of Manchester is but plain Mr Montague.
you will hang, sir!
he will not hang. I will be hanged first.
Edward! My lord.
perhaps the earl did not see how bravely this man fought at Marston.
for it was somewhat dark before he entered the field of battle himself.
you, sir, are another Leveller!
and I will have no Levellers in my command!
bow, or I'll hang you myself.
Edward, you were too hot.
but I'll speak to the earl and he will relent.
do not spend your breath.
I will fight for this parliament no more.
where is liberty when Freeborn John must bow to a hog in armour?
fare you well.
he spoke the truth.
there are too many like Mr Montague that have too much to lose by our victory.
Goodnight.
you were right, Thomas.
soon we must move towards Oxford and the King's lair.
and in our way, there are some great houses that we must secure.
nay, that you must secure.
Colonel Fanshawe. I am Colonel Thomas Rainsborough.
I know you who you are.
I will accept no bargain nor hear no threats from you.
do your worst.
my lady and her women will leave within the hour.
so be it.
my wife.
I will write you a pass to Oxford, my lady.
we are busy in the county.
I will need no pass, sir.
this is the house that I was born in.
if you wish to take it from us, you will wade through blood to do it.
this is not Croyland Abbey.
is this not so, my lord?
the ladies will be ready within the hour.
husband?
madam.
hear your husband, for I mean to do my duty here.
and I mine... sir.
you will leave, madam!
I will not, sir.
Angelica, you are the dearest creature in the world to me...
then let me stand beside you.
rainsborough has never failed in a siege.
he will destroy the house and all in it.
then where else should I be?
I will stay at all costs.
and die by your side.
then all is lost.
utterly lost.
your Majesty... Be silent.
you should have obeyed your husband.
and you, sir... you should have subdued your wife.
stay in Oxford if you will, madam, but expect nothing from the Queen's household evermore.
I will accept any commission from Your Majesty, however base or of low rank...
no, sir.
you will prepare yourself... to meet God.
your Majesty...?
he forgiveth and absolveth them that truly repent, so that at the last, we may come to his eternal joy... through Jesus Christ Our Lord.
Amen.
you must say "amen."
Amen.
surely the King does this only to fright me?
Halt!
stand left!
where is my wife?
Harry!
be brief, madam.
farewell, sweet friend.
I have done this, Harry.
I have done this!
remember me.
remember your boy...
who loved his sweet playfellow more than life.
pray to God for me, Angelica.
pray to God for me, Angelica.
please God...
take aim...
please, God, if you hear me, I beg you...
fire!
there is a woman in Oxfordshire.
upon my life, General, this woman is the epitome of wickedness.
she consorts with men.
she is sent from the Devil!
you are much changed, my lady.
you are not, I see.
what Colonel Rainsborough urges this council to accept is a form of government unknown on this Earth.
then it's clear, General.
in this beloved England, one of us will not live.
by whose authority do you come to take away a King?
it is a very good authority.
I'm what you see, Harry. I'm what you know me to be.
by day. And by night, what are you?
the world turns, you'll find you true natural.
shall Honest John not speak the truth... about this King who is a tyrant.
I am waiting, my lady.
for the killing to start.
this programme contains scenes of violence from the outset.
I'll fight for this parliament no more.
this is the house I was born in.
if you wish to take it from me you'll wade through blood.
you should have obeyed your husband.
stay in Oxford if you will, madam, but expect nothing from the Queen's household evermore.
fire.
two years later...
No! No! No!
madam, you are unwell.
she needs a hot dinner, brother Chimney.
I saw her first, brother Joliffe.
do not tire yourself, sir.
we travel before first peep of day.
well, Madam...what say you?
what has been your business in Oxford, sir?
to sell corn, my dear.
you're a farmer?
I sell corn...which is a mite easier than growing the stuff.
no armies trample over my profits.
and the King's court must still be fed.
shall I call the boy?
you want me drunk, madam?
I knew it were so!
such a bonny lady, such a fine face, but we must all eat, must we not?!
in times as these, a man must make hard bargains... and a woman must sell what a man will buy.
shall I call the boy?
no, dear Madam... for I am lusty enough.
come, come.
you've had your pay.
come, let me help you.
sir, I beg of you.
Oh, no, no, no, we'll have no tears.
for we are jolly here.
now off with the rest, open your pretty legs and all is done.
sir, I think you have a wife somewhere.
I beg you think.
madam. No more of this.
will you run me through?
I think you will not.
madam, will you get on your back?
well, then I see you need another smack.
Oh, God!
do not call for God, sir.
he's turned his face from us both.
the country starves, Thomas.
but Oliver, there is food enough for those with coin to pay for it.
parliament men sign themselves passes through my lines and sell corn to our enemies in Oxford.
the country looks to the Army for justice.
the country looks for order.
they want their King back in his place.
they want their world safe again.
you know my mind on that.
what is yours?
we are as one, and ever will be.
but Charles Stuart will ever be King.
how can Charles Stuart be King and the world be safe?
God will provide us the answer.
the starving copyholder nor the unpaid soldier will not wait for the firmament to split and shine God's beam on us, Oliver!
we must make our own light shine.
on the King, on the parliament of thieves and on property.
property?
land should be a common treasury.
let every man have a share of it and there'll be no starving. Men will feed themselves.
Where's that land to come from?
it must be taken from those who have too much.
you would have us turn to robbery then?
farewell, Colonel.
farewell, General.
why did these members of parliament... induce us to fight in the name of freedom... only that we might now endure their greed or suffer their prisons?
I tell ya, this is no freedom except for them!
and where sat they while we fought for their profits?
at home counting their money.
I tell ya, we are robbed once more.
not by King alone this time, but by parliament as well!
voice of the people, John.
let them! Let them come!
let them come.
comrades!
we fought side by side for liberty!
what did you fight for all that time?
to be the dogs that parliament would throw me to?
incarcerate me, sirs, I am a free born man!
try again.
Sexby. I was told you were dead at Kineton fight.
death indeed sought me out. Like a lover.
but yet I live.
I thank you.
God in heaven... help me, please!
you are much changed, my Lady.
you are not, I see.
where to?
tonight I know not.
tomorrow, London. There to make a new beginning.
it'll be dark soon.
they'll not have gone far.
there's rabbit.
how did your husband die?
he died because I was not tame.
the world would have you tame.
then the world is full of fools.
how came you by those clothes?
a man gave them to me.
I killed a man.
nothing remains of who I was.
at Axholme, where I was born, men came to drain the fens and when the water flowed away, they found men... buried in the peat. Like this.
hands tied to legs. Holes here...
stones or hammers...
and a black god... made in wood, kept perfect in the ground.
where is that god now, I wonder?
if all his worshippers are buried in the ground with him, is he still a god then?
if a King runs away from his country, is he still a King then?
he left England?
he gave himself to the Scots, hoping for a new Army, they say.
but the Scots know a bargain.
they've sold him to the parliament.
how can you laugh?
I thought Charles Stuart King, God and Father once.
madam.
we enter the world alone and in blood and leave the same way.
what happens in between means little.
I will be no man's whore.
do nothing but sit by the fire and look like a feast.
look what I found on the road to London.
a whore in a dead man's shirt.
take his clothes from her.
you will pay with your own life, for that of my friend.
but first...
lay her down.
or would you rather I kill him?
you're the devil, sir.
and you, madam, the devil's whore.
enough, enough killing.
the devil's whore gives the orders.
what times we live in.
go home, sir, to your wife.
your money will go to the poor whose taxes you live on.
a whore and a Leveller too, well may you prosper as Master Lilburne does.
walled up in stone.
by whose order?
by the parliament.
we will meet again, madam.
"free Born" John walled up again.
his wife will need money.
then I see you have found another God to worship.
the Holy Trinity - truth, liberty and justice.
and what is that but more blood?
and tell me, when all the blood is spilled, what then?
who will be master and who will be slave?
will I be King?
will my lady work in the fields?
there is a madness in you that feeds on the times, Sexby.
do not laugh at me, sir.
between blood of birth and blood of death there is life.
and this fight is now my life.
what is yours?
to laugh at hope?
to live and die alone?
nay.
I would not have that life.
turn your back.
I wish to dress in my skirts again.
must you?
must I what, sir?
put on your clothes?
I mean only to swim.
swim naked with me, madam...
and we will both take gold to Honest John.
he can have my share too.
all I ask is that you swim with me.
stand off.
will you not swim, Sexby?
I never could swim.
from a friend in the Parliament you say?
indeed.
I knew not I had a friend in the Parliament.
John, 28 pounds.
enough to buy a new printing press.
and some clothes for the children.
aye, a new press.
I thought the fight had lost you, Edward.
no, John.
the fight will never lose me again.
my sword is drawn.
this is the fight now.
words?
read.
you hold his life in your hands.
both sides will call it treason.
parliament to be forcibly adjourned and a new one elected by all men of good faith, not only those with property.
the levelling up of men cannot begin until this is accomplished.
that new Parliament to have Charles Stuart...
arrested.
and tried as a man of blood...
who will do the levelling up?
the army, Edward. Where you should be still.
there is no other engine to drive the world's turning but the army.
will you take these pages out?
they must find their way to a press.
I am searched.
even my skirts.
the dogs.
where is the press?
at your house, madam, with Thomas Rainsborough.
we must search you, sir. On my master's orders.
and who is your master?
that you need not know.
madam?
go, madam!
where is she?
this was my mother's chapel.
my, er, soldiers are godly men.
they will not tolerate idolatry.
my mother worshipped her God through painted clay.
I am glad to see you safe and well, madam.
these two years I tried for news of you many times.
I feared you were sick.
or worse.
I was never more alive.
from Honest John.
we are in your debt.
this house is given to the army for a while.
though I must make free with a part of it, the rest is yours.
how fares Joshua?
madam?
God sent these floods to trap you.
now he sends you Rainsborough and Cromwell, like Joshua and Gideon to drown you in fire and blood.
you broke a King's heart.
and killed some innocents too, madam.
my hands are stained in blood.
a Joshua indeed.
I've heard that all of your family is in the New World, Colonel.
my mother, my brother, and my sisters.
but not your wife then?
I will have no wife until this quarrel be over.
and how would you settle the quarrel?
by making England a republic.
and if England wants Charles Stuart on his throne again?
then I will leave England to its King and go to Massachusetts.
and find me a wife there.
and what shall she be, Colonel?
such a one as lives and worships in freedom.
one that knows how to truly love a man and be loved.
Oh, and beautiful.
none such in England then?
no, I would not have an English wife, madam.
not a painted child that knows nothing but a thousand years of privilege and calls it "breeding" or "manners."
calls submission "duty" and lives only to please a man and pass on his property to his sons.
I will a have a free spirit, madam.
all this and beautiful too.
I fear you will not find this paragon.
I need not find her.
for I believe she will find me.
will you not speak?
might you not hear a thousand years of privilege in my voice?
perhaps a hundred or two.
general Cromwell wishes to see you.
how is dear John?
well, General, when I saw him.
for a man with rats for bedfellows.
he is there by order of Parliament. I cannot pluck him out.
you plucked me out.
you fought bravely by my side at Kineton and at Marston.
as did Honest John.
and at Naseby thereafter.
where Charles Stuart lost his throne, did he not?
he lost his power, Edward.
but he is King still and whoever has him has our destiny in his grip.
the Scotch have sold him to Parliament, and Parliament have him sitting in Northamptonshire.
and if the army were to seize him, the army would hold sway.
then pluck him out of Northamptonshire, General.
that I may not do.
but other men might.
there is a woman in Oxfordshire.
her true name is not known to God-fearing men.
she is known as the Devil's Whore.
upon my life, General, this woman is the epitome of wickedness.
truly, Master Joliffe?
what form does this wickedness take?
lechery, sir.
she consorts with men.
and what, I pray you, should the army do about that?
she is sent from the devil!
I must confess, sir.
confess?
aye, confess.
I don't want to be silent.
her licentiousness has a purpose, sir.
that purpose is robbery and murder.
she... uses her... face... to trap men.
well... wickedness indeed.
the Parliament require you to make a troop available to me to search out and take this woman.
my America.
my Newfoundland.
Edward.
still not dead, then?
no, my Lady, it seems I must live.
I bring a message from the General, sir.
I'll leave you.
no, never. Stay and listen.
he has eyes everywhere.
I believe not a one of us moves his bowels without Oliver senses it.
craving your pardon, my Lady.
given.
he wants the King taken and delivered to the Army but he would not give the order.
Aye.
he would rather I did it.
whoever does it, risks the wrath of the Parliament.
and yet it should be done.
it shall be done, then.
think no more on it.
I will risk all in the cause.
fear not, they will not harm me.
the country would fall to utter ruin without me.
your business?
sire. We have come to take you into safe-keeping.
on whose authority do you come to take away a King?
it is a very good authority.
Oliver will never strike him down.
he would not be remembered as the man who threw over the King.
deep down, Oliver believes in the good old frame of government.
the cloth that went before cut to a different style?
authority where it was, rank where it was, land where it was.
and the women sent home again to be silent wives in harness to their husbands.
in harness to property.
there are two roads to the future, Thomas.
the Leveller regiments will follow yours.
then what will Oliver do?
and what will Thomas Rainsborough do if the road is blocked?
I will become an American.
like my wife.
you swore you had no wife, sir.
Oh, I mean to have one, if she will have me.
Colonel!
stay.
I will return for my answer.
Colonel, I heard not your question.
will you be my wife?
Colonel! Parliament men!
well?
come and find your answer when duty allows.
this need not concern you, Colonel, except your garrison will need to know of our presence in your area.
you bring a troop of horse to seek a woman who stole your purse?
read further, sir. She murdered my dear friend.
though, again, sir, it need not concern you.
it concerns me that the Parliament thinks the Army has no more pressing task to perform than to indulge the grudges of wealthy men who stayed at home growing their bellies while others bled to death.
my Lady Angelica Fanshawe.
the mistress of this house.
Ah, my Lady Fanshawe.
master Joliffe sits in the Parliament tending the nation's wounds.
he is leaving.
a delight to meet you, madam.
and yet, I swear I have looked upon your face before.
at court, perhaps?
of course. In the court.
I never could forget such a face.
and I never will.
farewell, Madam.
Colonel.
nothing will go well till these leeches are purged.
what was his business?
to persecute some whore. He means to have her hanged.
my answer, Madam?
do you see him?
see who?
you do not see him?!
I cannot marry you.
there is no future. There is only the past.
purge of Parliament?
some thrown out, some kept in.
no, I cannot support it.
they are bloodsuckers.
one sweep of the sword and they are gone. We begin anew.
Ah. A new election?
no. We know who the godly men are, the men who want the best for England. Let them remain.
no election?
no.
why no election?
John, the country is half-ruined.
there is famine in the north and west.
corrupt monopolies flourish.
we must force Parliament to reform.
we need the support of Honest John Lilburne.
in God's name, John, we want to purge the men whose warrant keeps you rotting here!
why no election?
because the country will vote for the King's men!
and you will turn to dust in this rat-infested hole and your wife and children will starve in a gutter!
but I mistake, of course, for in truth, there is no more comfortable place on earth for John Lilburne than a prison cell!
where he is spared the trouble of considering the full-grown problems of governance and not the unborn children of liberty and truth.
which will lie forever in the womb if we cannot make a world into which they may be brought!
comfortable?
think, John, a purged Parliament and a law quickly passed by which no man will have an income above 2, 000 a year, not even Earls and Dukes.
by what authority would a law such as that be brought in?
by this authority.
for there is none now else in England, I think you know.
sir. Within half a day of your departure, Mistress Fanshawe was arrested.
she's charged with robbery and murder.
they will hang me!
lies cannot hang you.
this was done to attack me, why else?
Thomas, a word.
you must not tell him.
I killed a thief.
will he not understand?
no, he will not. He is Thomas Rainsborough, not Edward Sexby.
then he will hear me condemned in court.
Elizabeth will stay with you.
let me pay a visit to Master Joliffe.
let me ask him in front of his wife and daughter, how he came to meet this Oxford whore.
let him tell his lies, Edward, the truth will out.
Angelica, you wanted to speak?
no.
mistress Fanshawe, the charges against you are as follows
in the year of our Lord, 1646, you did most cruelly murder the corn merchant, Master Chimney.
and that with diverse others in Wytham Woods, you did attack and rob Master Joliffe.
and that you are the notorious felon known as, The Devil's Whore.
what is your answer to these charges?
that I am no whore...
liar! Whore!
hang her! And never was!
if your father continues with this case, your head will follow your hair.
we will proceed to the evidence.
master Joliffe...
master Joliffe, will you come forward and give your account?
I... mistook.
this is not the woman who robbed me.
that woman was a whore I used many times in Oxford.
all this I swear...on the blood of Christ.
release the prisoner.
I ask your forgiveness.
for a while in the prison, a doubt crept into me...
no, Thomas. I killed a man who wanted my honour for pigeon pie. I was...
there is no past.
only the future.
there is something more I must tell you.
I am with child.
a speedy settlement.
I will bring forward new proposals to the Parliament soon.
your Majesty, my heart is filled with joy to hear that promise.
but I must tell His Majesty from the love that I bear Your Majesty, and ever will, there are some in the army that are put to worry by the many rumours that His Majesty yet seeks an intervention from the Scottish force.
no, no, no, no.
no.
and that is also a promise from His Majesty?
of course it is a promise.
thomas Rainsborough.
what of him, Majesty?
he is a fanatical.
a Leveller.
should such a man be in such high command?
I would sleep easier in my bed if he were removed from our affairs.
thomas is the best man in England, sire.
and my friend.
well, then let any man here tell me a better way.
let any man here tell me any other way this ship can be brought into harbour other than to talk to Charles Stuart?
he game me solemn undertakings. Promises from his own lips.
which will prove false as ever before.
gentlemen.
we have Royalist uprisings in south Wales, in Yorkshire and in Cheshire.
then let us crush them!
aye Thomas, we can crush them.
we can spend our lifetimes, and our children's lifetime, killing and killing again.
but when the killing stops, where is England?
we cannot achieve all, my friends, but we can achieve... a sufficiency!
a sufficiency of Charles Stuart?
a sufficiency of bloated thieves in the Parliament?
a sufficiency of soldiers who fought for their country, only to be told they must now starve for the wages promised.
I fought not for that sufficiency!
hear, hear!
well, what then, Thomas? More death, more destruction, what?
we exile Charles Stuart.
let him depart.
let us govern the country through councils elected in the streets the guilds, the universities.
elected in the streets? By whom?
by all men.
for I think the poorest he that is in England has a life to live is the greatest he.
no more Parliaments for men with property only.
we should burn it down.
well, then, Thomas... and all of you, my friends and comrades, I must tell you this.
what Colonel Rainsborough urges this council to accept is a form of government unknown on this Earth, and one that will straightway fall into anarchy.
rather than let this beloved England fall into such misery, I tell you now, I would pull promises out of Charles Stuart's mouth another thousand years.
then it's clear, General.
in this beloved England, one of us will not live.
if you rise up, you will be called mutineers and traitors.
Oliver is still the hero.
then the regiments must be prepared for this convulsion.
reason says we lose all in delay.
now tell me what your heart says, Edward.
I have butchered men.
here and in Germany.
but say the word, Colonel, and I will sharpen my blades once again.
this time for justice, not for pay.
edward Sexby has nothing to lose on this Earth.
others have.
madam?
one man only may unite the Army in this great matter, Thomas.
that man is you.
Thomas.
Charles Stuart has broken his promises.
every one of them.
by escaping from Hampton Court.
gone, it is thought, to the Island of Wight.
I come to apologise to you...and to all.
for that I was foolishly dazzled by him.
we will negotiate with this false man no more.
but, Thomas, there must now be unity amongst us or all will be brought to ruin.
there are new uprisings today in Essex and in Yorkshire and in Cheshire and in Wales and in Bristol, too.
the country needs its Army now as never before.
what say you?
when we have done, will all matters as to how we govern this country be for discussion?
all matters.
and will all matters as to land and property be for discussion?
all.
you are needed in Pontefract, Thomas.
a siege such as only you can lift.
but I beg of you, make speed.
our enemies were making ready for this while I blinked in the sunlight of the king's gaze.
I will go tomorrow.
tonight, Thomas.
tonight must be my wedding night, Oliver.
if my lady will marry a soldier that will be gone in the morning?
she will.
may God grant you a long life together.
I must go to Wales, a thing I never thought to do.
fare you well.
will you not offer me a wedding gift, General?
if it can be done.
let John Lilburne go free.
overthrow Parliament's warrant.
it is done, madam.
by authority of the Army.
you will not make me a wife for one night, I hope?
I must disappoint you, Edward.
no fight for you.
till I return, guard this woman with your life.
why do you sleep on straw still, Sexby?
I wish you were by Thomas' side in Yorkshire.
I wish it, too.
he is the best man I ever met.
sexby, do you ever think of those times in Wytham Woods?
I have never been in Wytham Woods, my lady.
except once.
to swim one day when I was hot.
we come with a message from General Cromwell.
when you were the god of battles, there was ever a sign of your blessing on me.
now when you rest upon my shoulders, my sight is dim.
I think I see the road... and yet I fear to tread it.
I know the man I must strike down and yet I fear the blood that will be shed thereafter.
the fight...
take men to the Island and arrest Charles Stuart.
he will be charged with making unlawful war on England.
let others stand ready to enter the Parliament.
the time has come.
husband.
yes?
there will be a life for us, will there not?
one day the argument will be over.
there is a life to come.
arrest her.
you shall not touch her!
sexby, desist.
what does it matter now? Let them hang me.
next time...
hard, hard, push.
my Army is brave.
they will see sights in Ireland that they never thought to see.
for we are living in the best and last of days.
there is a bond made between a king and his people.
once broken, farewell sovereignty.
welcome to Hazzard County.
a little corner of the world where everyone knows everyone else...
...and people are never too busy to stop and say howdy.
shoot, some folks even say this is where the apple pie was invented.
Yep, basically everything down here moves a little bit slower...
...unless, of course, your last name is Duke.
man, the General's in good shape.
Bo, it's happy hour at The Boar's Nest, and we still got two deliveries to make.
it's all one big happy hour, Luke. Besides, we're taking a shortcut.
Hi, Luke.
I got this one. - You sure that's a good idea, cuz?
it's a great idea. Come on.
Hey, Laurie.
you here to make your delivery? - Well, I was hoping to.
Luke, remember last time.
don't worry about it, cuz.
it's okay, Bo. Pa ain't here.
see, Bo? Pa ain't here.
Hi. - Hi.
play hard to get, little buddy.
listen and learn, General.
and now, side two of the Al Unser, Jr. Story:
no Questions, only Unsers, as read by Laurence Fishburne.
I'm too old for this shit.
that's what I was thinking as I turned into the final lap...
...running fourth at Talladega.
but then it hit me. Life is like a racetrack.
you gotta keep going round and round.
that is so true. - Sure, sometimes you crash and burn.
but if you don't make the turn, you ain't never gonna learn.
so I gripped the wheel tighter, checked my gauges, and made my move.
make my move. Give you my move. Make it, mother...
Jesus christ! - Howdy, Bo.
Hey, Mr. Pullman. I nearly shit myself.
how you doing, sir? - Oh, I'm fine.
you ready for that big Hazzard Rally this weekend?
Yeah, I got him all tuned up. Right, General?
how many times you won that, anyway?
four in a row, sir. - Four in a row.
that's good. Billy Prickett won it four in a row, and look what he's doing today.
Hey, you been hunting? - Yes, sir.
Yeah, I been using those new whammy shells.
they scatter less for when you really wanna blow a hole in something.
cool. Guns. - Yeah.
are you delivering all by yourself today?
Oh, no. I never travel alone, sir.
I like to think I travel with the man upstairs.
you know, Jesus.
you know, I like that attitude.
I'm gonna look around and find a boy like you...
...to date my daughter, Laurie, pretty soon.
because she's getting curious about boys, you know.
Yeah.
Oh, you're talking about sex, right?
I just wanna keep that sorry cousin of yours away from her.
the way he looks at her galls me. You know what I mean?
you get back here right now, you son of a bitch.
get back here.
Luke! Luke!
why you running, you chickenshit? - Goddamn Dukes.
you get the hell off my sister.
Jimmy! - Oh, shit.
damn you, Luke! You get back in the house!
go, Bo, go! - Luke, wait!
put on a shirt! - Come on, come on, come on.
I forgot about the brother. Go!
so happy hour?
you're gonna get us shot someday. - Not today.
not with you driving the getaway car.
so how was it? - It's never bad.
son of a bitch.
here, load up with these whammy shells.
they'll blow a hole through an elephant's ass.
look out.
Oh, goddamn it! You're gonna replace that.
what's he using? - You don't wanna know.
dadgum it, you just assassinated a tree.
got a big kick to it.
don't you worry. They can't touch the General. Come on, boy.
you missed, Jimmy!
can't you shoot straight? Don't point that thing at me, you chucklehead.
don't call me a chucklehead. I ain't a chucklehead.
Hey! Get that gun out of the wheel!
what are you doing? Hey. Hey. What the hell?
goddamn it. - I'm sorry, Daddy.
let's go after them.
Bo, did you see that sign? - I can read!
this is how you planned on losing them?
you ain't scared, are you?
scared? Hell, no. I just don't wanna hear it from Uncle Jesse...
...when you break his bottles of shine.
I bet you the old phone book I don't break a bottle.
phone book it is.
daddy, you get me close, and I'll put a bullet in this son of a bitch.
goddamn it, Jimmy!
who says I can't shoot? Daddy? Daddy!
Bo and Luke Duke.
cousins closer than brothers.
both big-hearted, strong-willed...
...and restless as a couple of cats thrown into a swimming hole.
nice driving, cuz.
what?
I won the bet, you son of a bitch. - Oh, come on.
I didn't break any bottles, so I won the bet.
I was just joking about the bet. - Oh, you were joking?
Yeah. - Still getting the phone book, though.
come on, double or nothing. - Nope. Time to pay your debt, buddy.
which side you want, right side or left?
right.
did I hear one of your teeth break?
I don't remember the Hazzard phone book being that thick.
this is Atlanta.
bet was over. I can't believe that happened. I mean, the bet was over.
what are you doing? - Where you want it?
Oh, man. - Where you want it?
left.
that was a good one.
right in the ball sack. God.
in case of dehydration.
that'll put lead in your pencil.
man, I'm already tired of walking. - You could use a little exercise.
them jeans of yours look tighter than Daisy's.
Oh, yeah? I bet you a cold beer I could beat you to The Boar's Nest.
that's five miles.
I'm coming! I'm coming!
face!
he came back.
what's Billy Prickett doing here?
well, it looks like he's here for the race.
man, those tires alone are worth more than the General Lee.
my, oh, my. Look at that. Billy Prickett's car, huh?
what's new in law enforcement, Enos?
they make you lieutenant yet? - Hell, you know that'll never happen.
maybe one of these days you'll wise up and come work for us.
we could use a man like you.
I don't know. I don't think it's a good time to be in the moonshine business.
moonshine business? We ain't in the moonshining business.
but if someone were in the moonshining business, why would it be a bad time?
now, Luke, you know I can't say anything. Boss Hogg'll tan my hide.
he spanks you?
Hey, Dil, what do you want? We just ordered.
by the looks of this place, I'll take two bottles of Pepto...
...and a shot of penicillin, right?
Jesus, mother of Mary.
look away, man. Trust me, look away.
don't worry about it. I won't hurt her.
there ain't nobody in this bar concerned about you hurting her.
all right, all right.
y'all ready to order?
you better be reading my nametag, friend.
I am, I am. I noticed your initials were double D.
Oh, sweet Jesus. - I'll give you one more chance.
you wanna order, or you wanna sit around and make stupid jokes?
ain't gotta get fussy. We're having a good time.
I'll tell you what, I'll order. We don't want no problems.
let's see...
do those legs come over easy?
Oh, my God.
how about the special, sir? - Dil Driscoll!
you stop bothering that nice girl and pick on somebody your own size.
Billy Prickett. - Hey, it's Billy Prickett!
welcome home, boy. - You old mule.
Hey.
why don't you cool off, Dil?
come on, boy. Let's get out of here. - My, my, my.
holy hell, Luke. There he is, right there. That's Billy Prickett.
should I buy him a drink?
maybe you should buy him flowers and chocolates.
give me a Miller. Make it a Lowenbrau.
how you doing?
Hey, Billy Prickett. Welcome back to Hazzard.
see, boys, I told you all the waitresses in this place was dog ugly.
man. - I'm only fooling with you.
fellas, this is Bo Duke.
Bo is looking to break my Hazzard Rally record. What is it now, four in a row?
Yeah, well...
all streaks must come to an end, Bo. I'm calling this one the drive for five.
well, I'm looking forward to the race. - Hey, Dil!
this is the boy who's trying to break my record.
Oh, really? I'm Dil Driscoll, crew chief.
Bo-Bo, have a seat. - Really?
so, Billy, what's it like being in the circuit?
well... - Hey, Billy, join me for a drink?
Oh, well, you sweet little thing.
fellas, I'm awfully thirsty all of a sudden.
Bo-Bo, may the best man win.
John, another round!
so, Bo, what's the story on that little pistol over there?
because she gave me a ride earlier.
well, actually, she's my cousin.
Oh, really? You hitting that?
she's my cousin. - Hopefully you're kissing cousins, right?
come again? - Son, all I'm really trying to ask you...
...is if you shuck her corn.
now, there are certain things you just don't say to a Duke about another Duke.
I'll shuck your corn!
excuse me a second.
pick him up! Pick him up!
Hey, hey. Can I get in on this?
Yeah. - Sure.
Oh, buddy.
here we go.
fifty bucks on the Dukes!
that makes two, Luke! - Attaboy!
Hey, Billy Prickett!
careful, Bo-Bo.
don't hit him. That's A. J. Foyt!
Really? - The fourth!
Hey, can I hit this guy? - Kill them all!
the ribs are greasy. - The beans are cold.
sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane.
closest thing to law enforcement in Hazzard County.
Rosco's been after the Duke boys since they started walking.
of course, some people say the boys' first steps...
...landed right on the sheriff's last nerve.
dukes. Just once you two ought to try leaving a place...
...in better shape than it was when you walked in.
Oh, I think your boss can afford to replace a few broken beer mugs.
I heard there was a little incident earlier...
...concerning a certain crappy orange hot rod out at the Miller farm.
y'all really upset some of them construction boys.
when I got there, they were not being gentle with your beloved piece of crap.
What'd you do, Rosco?
I can't say she's gonna be in real good racing shape for the rally this weekend.
you watch yourself, hillbilly boy.
come on, boys. My shift's over. I'll take you over to cooter's.
come on.
Jefferson Davis Hogg...
...the meanest man in Hazzard County.
he's canny as a fox, tough as a badger...
...and crooked as a hillbilly's smile.
well, Rosco.
I see you have redecorated.
interesting style. What do you call it?
well, sir, the Dukes... - The Dukes.
I had a feeling.
I've got some important things happening here this weekend.
Yes, sir. - Are you gonna take care of the Dukes...
...or am I gonna have to make other plans?
I'm on top of it, Boss.
that's what I'm afraid of.
you ready? - Is it bad?
not good.
hell, this is worse than the time you sunk it in the Tipton Swamp.
mostly cosmetic damage, right, cooter?
mostly. - Yeah.
he's gonna be ready for the race, right? - Race? Come on, Bo.
I mean, the General doesn't race.
the General erases the competition.
who does this?
it would make a nice hat or a slipper.
you know what? Just leave the General here with me. I'll see if I can fix...
I'll have it up running in no time. Meanwhile, you boys take my truck.
what if you need to tow somebody?
if I can't "toe" them, I'll just finger them. You know what I mean?
close one. Even shell-shocked, he's a better driver than you are.
Thanks, cooter. - Yeah.
chin up.
Daisy?
Jesse L. Duke.
uncle Jesse to you. - Daisy.
now, Jesse's been two places in his life:
Hazzard County and Korea.
Daisy? - I'm in here.
as far as he's concerned... - where are you?
I'm in the shower.
that's one place too many.
ready or not, here I come.
how's it looking, good looking? - Well, I fixed the vapor coils...
...but the boiler's still slow. You been running this around the clock?
them boys break more bottles than they deliver. Eight cases this month.
wonder where in the hell they are, anyway.
it'll make you feel lots better.
light the son of a bitch. - All right.
I feel good.
all right, y'all, knock off the grab-assing over there.
what's going on, Uncle Jesse?
guy come out of an antique shop carrying a big grandfather's clock.
bumped into this drunk, broke the clock.
guy said, "why don't you watch where you're going."
the drunk says, "why don't you carry a wristwatch like everybody else."
know what happens when you give a politician Viagra?
no. - He gets taller.
here's another one for you.
how many Dukes does it take to screw up a moonshine delivery?
Oh, yes, sorry about that, Uncle Jesse. We...
is that Rosco?
wonder what that fat sack of shit wants.
come on.
we can skip the "Hi, how are you's." I'm here on official police business.
right here, sheriff.
Oh, that's horseshit. You planted that.
by the power vested in me by the county of Hazzard, Georgia...
...I hereby seize this property...
...for the crime of producing and distributing moonshine.
now, Jesse, we can do this the easy way...
...or, of course...
...there's that other way.
let's try the that other way first. - Now, hold on. Wait.
only way I'm leaving this farm is in a wooden box.
well...
Hi, Dukes.
Hi.
well, now.
lookie there.
Moonshining. What a shame, what a shame.
that ain't ours, Boss. - Really?
you're out of here.
this land ain't yours anymore.
you're gonna have to live somewhere else...
...and you're never gonna moonshine... - why, you prick!
watch out. I got my dog here, and I ain't fed him, and he's real hungry.
easy, Jesse. Not now.
you boys done started a fight you can't win.
well, you have my sympathy. Y'all take care, now.
should've busted a cap in his ass. - Hell, yeah.
Hey, easy now, boys.
thanks for taking us in, Pauline. We really appreciate it.
Oh, honey, it is my pleasure.
I left three toes in Korea for this country, and this is the thanks I get.
I don't understand how they could just take your farm.
they planted a still in our barn.
they planted a still? Now, why would they need to plant a still?
because they're too damn dumb to find our real one.
I was waiting on old Bill Miller up at the truck stop last night.
he said Boss' men seized his land for some trumped-up charge too.
maybe it's got to do with all that construction equipment up at the Millers'.
you wanna go up there and take a second look?
Oh, I don't know, boys.
Oh, now, Pauline.
don't worry, Uncle Jesse. We're gonna take care of it.
you know what's gonna happen, don't you?
those two are gonna get themselves in trouble, end up in jail...
...and I'm gonna have to shake my ass to get them out.
that's why we love you, honey.
Oh, goddamn it. - Well, well, well.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
what's it look like? I'm building a doomsday machine...
...gonna aim it right up your heinie hole.
you stupid enough to think you can fix this?
I'm fixing to fix it. - Oh, you fixing to fix it.
you couldn't fix an election if your brother was the governor.
what do you want, Rosco?
this here vehicle, it was used in the illegal transportation of moonshine.
boss wants it impounded.
it ain't running right now, and my tow truck ain't here...
...so unless you stick it up your ass...
Hey, one way or another, grease monkey...
...tomorrow I'm auctioning off this hunk of junk.
so y'all have a good night, now, okay?
I got two words for you: Soap and water.
that's three words.
stupid.
Hey, man, this is cooter.
round up the fellas. I got a job for them.
lot of equipment there for an abandoned farm.
Yeah, and that fence went up pretty quick too, huh?
let's go ditch the truck. - All right.
well, ain't that cute, a man taking his pig for a walk.
come on.
what now?
lookie here, Bo.
he's got our farm marked, right next to the Millers' and the Robinsons'.
what the hell does he want with all this land?
I don't know.
but I tell you what, if I was incriminating information...
...l'd be hiding in that big, huge son of a bitch.
how are we supposed to open that? - I don't know about you...
...but I'd sure hate to be that safe right now.
Yeah!
holy shit.
hope they got e-mail.
Oh, dear.
what the hell?
it's stuck on a pole.
I'll check it.
give it some gas! - Okay!
Hey, give it a little more gas! - Okay!
Hey, Bo, hold up! - Okay!
Hey! No, Bo! No!
okay!
Yeah! - Bo!
no, Bo! - Sorry, cuz.
you'd do the same thing to me.
Bo!
Bo, damn it!
hold on, little buddy!
Oh, shit!
Bo, you son of a...
I said, no, Bo. No!
I thought you said, "Go, Bo. Go."
you see how that sounds kind of...?
Hey, you know what? Sheev lives near here.
maybe he can help us open this thing up, huh?
Yeah.
okay. We'll go to Sheev's.
Rosco, this here's chip.
you might wanna call Hogg...
...and tell him them two fellers, they made off with his safe.
and I might need a ride too.
boss, what kind of mood you in?
I'm in a crawfish-boiling mood.
well, it seems that the Duke boys...
...have stolen your safe.
I am officially upgrading the Dukes...
...from "fly in my ointment" to "thorn in my side."
and if they happen to elevate themselves to "pain in my ass..."
...then I'm gonna boil you. Got it?
Yes, sir. - Now...
...I want you to find the Dukes and lock them up.
Oh, and bring me my damn safe back.
Yes, sir.
flash.
evening, Sheev.
sheev.
I'm looking for them Duke boys. You seen them?
they was last seen heading up this road here.
you still got them clA mind probes stuck in your head, boy?
far as I know.
good. Keep your little antennae up there...
...in case you see the Dukes, you let me know, you hear?
Yeah.
stinks out here, you know that?
is he gone, Sheev? - He's gone.
Prickett, Prickett. - It means a lot to me...
...to be invited here back to my hometown.
I hope to remind the good people of Hazzard...
...what it feels like to be proud again. - We love you, Billy!
and I hope to remind the good people of Hazzard to come out to the rally...
...and cheer their favorite son, Billy Prickett!
and I'm declaring today Billy Prickett Day.
you're too kind. I just hope, come Saturday...
...I'm not too hazardous on the roads.
hazardous on the roads.
this one's for you! - This is Tammy Arinder...
...at the parade, for WCNU News.
seeing Billy Prickett race in person?
that might be worth putting my pants on for.
Bo, you racing on Saturday? - I'm planning on it.
what's the prize for second place?
gonna be good. Tough one, good luck.
it's a little weird he's coming back here to race.
life's weird, Luke. Someday you're gonna have to accept that.
well, okay. Let's take a look at that lockbox.
Oh, yeah. Liberty 400.
high-density, 9200-psi composite material.
two-inch chrome bolts, vertical and horizontal.
and a spring-loaded, independent relocking device, with a foreign body.
she's a beauty. - Can you crack it?
I'm gonna do more than crack it.
goddamn it.
armadillo. They've been infiltrating my perimeter all summer.
the hell you do with them? - I make helmets.
armadillo helmets can block even the best brain-wave scanners.
make a pretty good soup bowl too.
so okay. I'm gonna go to work on this thing.
while I do, would you be a dear, Bo, and go grab me that armadillo?
Thanks.
man, he looks pissed off.
come on, y'all! That was a good one.
all right, maybe you could take it off now.
got a real nice deal on this stuff. Government issue.
only expired about six months ago, so should have a real nice pop.
Yeah! Cooter's got the General running.
might be able to race on Saturday. - Really?
we gotta get it out of there tonight. Rosco wants to impound it.
watch your ass, fellas.
this is the fastest-burning fuse you got, Sheev?
it's a chinese fuse.
might be a wet fuse. - Well, should we check it?
depends if you like how your face is configured, pretty boy.
I think you got the wires backwards.
they're supposed to be. It's a chinese fuse.
no, backwards from how they're supposed to be.
you ever been to china? Have you ever been to china?
I ate chinese food once.
well, you don't blow up mu shu pork, my friend.
I dated a Korean girl in school.
that is a different oriental nation. Get an education.
you got the fuse wrong. - You know nothing about...
...chino-Sino-American relations. - You're missing the point.
might've used too much.
man, that rattled my sphincter.
what the hell is that? Drugs?
don't look like no drugs I ever saw.
what the hell are these numbers? - It's a core sample.
mining. They drill a hole, take a sample, send it to the lab, see what they got.
core samples of what? - How should I know?
am I wearing a white coat here? I cut bait and blow shit up for a living.
take it to a lab. - I don't know, maybe at the university?
Katie-Lynn Johnson's at the university. - Oh, yeah, that's right.
man, I always had a thing for that girl.
remember she used to come by the farm with those tight little outfits?
no, I can't say I remember that. - I thought I had her too.
then she pulled a goddamn Keyser Soze on me, and like that...
...she was gone.
you don't remember that?
well, okay.
unless you need something else blown, I'll go inside and wash my mongoose.
okay.
come on, Luke. Let's get the General.
why don't we have cooter stash that.
we'll take his truck, head to the highway...
how would you feel if the General and I went to Atlanta and left you behind?
ain't she a Georgia peach?
What'd you do, make a deal with the devil?
Luke. Luke. Is that a Hemi?
me and my buddies lose the Gettysburg reenactment every other Sunday.
so we figured, why not let General Lee win one?
I don't know how we're gonna pay you back, cooter.
would a BJ from Daisy be within the realm of possibility?
not gonna happen.
how about a pair of her still-warm shorts?
all right.
Hey, Bo, just win that Hazzard Rally. That's thanks enough.
and when you get that prize money, you pay me, because that's how it works.
I love you, cooter.
I didn't have time to fix everything. - Right.
let's get that car.
get in your cars and get them! Get after them! Now!
Cooter!
all right.
that's so good, man.
enough.
man, I'm never gonna get out of this car again. I'm gonna live in it.
I'm gonna eat in it. And I'm gonna make sweet love to it.
you mean you gonna make sweet love in it.
Oh, no, I wanna fuck it.
all units, we are in hot pursuit of them Duke boys...
...in their piece-of-shit orange car.
piece of... You son of a bitch.
Hey! Get back here!
lost Sheep, you out there? - Hey, cooter.
these fellas ain't gonna be doing much chasing.
Thanks, man. - I'm gonna run right over Billy Prickett.
how about we go to Atlanta first?
all right, cuz.
Oh, look at that. There's your problem right there.
Yeah, that's a shame.
let's go to Atlanta.
Luke.
Luke.
I know why it didn't work out with me and Katie before. It was just timing.
life is all about timing, you know?
it's my time now. I'm gonna win that race on Saturday.
we're gonna get the farm back. I got my BFF, you.
and I'm gonna get Katie Johnson, you watch.
it's my time.
what's going on?
Yeah, baby! Southern by the grace of God!
well, at least we know they're nice up here.
hurry up, you're late for your Klan meeting, asshole.
Klan meeting? - Don't listen to her.
the South will rise again.
Yee-haw, brother!
what the hell's wrong with these people?
nice roof, redneck. Join us in the 21 st century?
we're gonna make some friends up here, huh?
Oh, excuse me. Can I help you, ma'am?
Daisy! Oh, boy.
ENOS, what's Boss doing taking all that land?
I don't know. They won't tell me. You gotta go. I'm supposed to arrest you.
come on, I'm serious. - Get. Get out of here.
Hey. You Anus?
no, that's Enos, Mr. Prickett.
sorry about that. Is Hogg around? He asked me to come by.
Oh, yeah. He's out back in the garage, Mr. Prickett.
well, howdy, ma'am. How are you today?
it's just right on out back there. I'll show you.
Yep, head out that way.
there you go.
there he is.
hometown hero. - Hogg.
how you doing, son? - Well...
...this is a great place to crap, but I'm ready to head to Atlanta.
not before the race.
don't you worry about that.
I want you down at that finish line. Sign autographs for the kids.
Yeah, I know the drill. - I know you do.
but I need you there for two hours, son. Two hours.
kissing hands and shaking babies.
you got that backwards. It's shaking hands and kiss the babies.
Oh, yeah? Maybe that's why I lost that governor's election in '86.
Hogg, what the hell am I doing here?
Rosco.
whoa, what is this? You off the reservation?
see how it kind of catches me around the eyes there?
look here, I already got sponsors.
what am I supposed to tell castrol, Yahoo!?
tell them it's for charity.
is it? - Sure. Could be.
whatever you say. I'm gonna win that race by a mile.
it don't matter whose face is on my car when I do.
I don't need you to win the race. I just need you to show up.
hey there, Mr. Prickett.
well, hello, Daisy.
I was just walking by, and I saw your car in the garage there. She's real sexy.
well, thank you. She's faster than a cheetah on cocaine.
Yeah, I know.
why is there a picture of Boss Hogg on your car, though?
Yeah, well, he... - I read somewhere...
...that coca-cola pays you over $ 100, 000 to put their logo on your door.
you read that? - That same article...
...mentioned that Budweiser pays you over $ 100, 000...
...to put their logo on your trunk. - Look, Daisy...
...l'm not much of a reader. - Boss Hogg's face is sitting...
...on over $200, 000 worth of real estate.
is that what he's paying you?
Oh, no, no, Daisy, this race here is for charity.
Really? Which one?
anal bifida.
spinal bifida.
it's one of the bifidas.
have I told you that you're as purty as a Hazzard county sunset?
have a good day, Mr. Prickett.
okay.
lot of smart people out there.
look out, Katie.
hello. Hi.
hello. - Hello.
Oh, boy. - Hi.
you don't think it's too late to take them SATs, do you?
you gotta keep an open mind in college.
this is it, Luke. I can feel it.
Hey, do you know where Katie Johnson is?
I think she's in that room right there.
Thanks. - Thank you.
I got a great opening line for Katie. - What is it?
you'll see.
Katie Johnson? - She's down the hall.
cool. - Come on, down the hall.
Katie Johnson?
she's down the hall. - Do you guys go to school here?
no, but do you have an application?
not on me.
come on, now, focus.
let's hope she's not in here either.
Katie Johnson? - Fuck me running!
you looking for Katie? - We were.
you guys Hacky? - Hacky!
what about Katie? - Maybe she's in here.
goodbye, Bo. Bye, Luke.
I guess she wasn't in there.
we didn't check under the couch. - Luke! Bo!
Katie. - Katie-Lynn.
so he's still doing that?
did I just faint? - No.
Oh, my God. I can't believe y'all came.
we just wanna pay you visit, the prettiest girl in Atlanta.
what?
we just wanna pay a visit to the prettiest girl in Atlanta.
that's sweet. I can't believe what happened to y'all's farm.
we're gonna get it back.
I love that farm. I used to have so much fun there.
see? - This is my roommate, Annette.
Annette, this is Bo and Luke. - Nice to meet you.
ma'am. - Annette's from Australia.
let's put another shrimp on the barbie!
that's what they say there. - Okay.
what do y'all need in the geology lab?
it has something to do with them taking our farm...
...but we don't know what the hell it is.
I don't know that they'll let y'all in, but we'll take you.
we'll get dressed. Y'all wait downstairs. - We're gonna wait here.
downstairs is fine.
it's happening, Luke. It's all happening.
I'll give you that, Jesse.
I'll give you that. - Will you now?
what are you doing with my land, Jefferson?
ain't your land anymore.
wasn't that long ago you was a moonshiner too. Remember?
well, I have reformed from my sins.
I am now an honest businessman.
like sponsoring racecars?
what are you getting out of bringing Billy Prickett down here?
you know, your nephew's won that race four years in a row.
now, who's gonna fault me for breaking up a dynasty?
well, I know you're rich, and I know you stink.
but you ain't stinking rich.
you wouldn't be throwing that money at Prickett...
...unless you thought he was gonna earn you 10 times that.
you're a smart man. So why don't you do the smart thing.
why don't you take your family and leave.
because, see, now I own that farm.
and you ain't never gonna get it back.
I have all the cards, Jesse.
you don't have spit.
it ain't over yet.
Hey, Bo, I love your car. She really rumbles.
it's actually a he. Right, Katie?
I ain't even speeding.
you know how fast you were going?
what? - How fast you were going.
I don't know. Ten? - Eight.
isn't the speed limit 10? - Yeah. It is.
you guys police?
campus police.
mother of God.
Oh, wait.
I know it's a shame to hide your beauty like this, but it's for your own good.
what?
I'm not even gonna respond to that. That's crazy.
I know, I'll miss you too. I'll be right back.
all right, let's go. Let's go.
Katie-Lynn seems like a girl you could settle down with, don't you think, Luke?
Yeah. - I don't know, fellas.
I don't think they're gonna let us walk in.
you'll think of something, Katie. You always do. Remember that...?
Oh, you're so pretty.
I have an idea.
can I help you? - You're just the guy we're looking for...
Royce. - Royce...?
Royce williams. - Royce williams, maybe you can help us.
we're here looking for the brightest young geologists for high-paying jobs.
maybe you've been by our booth.
you're from Kamasaka Technologies? - That's right.
I'm Mr. Ichinowa, and this is my colleague...
...Yoko Takanoshi.
right on.
you said you were Japanese?
we converted.
your professor tells us you're some kind of super-genius or something.
Really? On my last test I got a c-minus. - Hey, that's good.
that's real good. - You think...?
you just might be Kamasaka Tech material.
you just gotta pass this one little test.
you just tell us what this is right here.
looks like a core sample.
man, that's good. - He's good.
core sample of what? - Oh, of course.
what are you doing? - What?
what the fuck was that? - Relax.
Damn! Damn!
these are my good Levi's.
let's not lose focus here, Royce.
Yes, sir, Mr. Takanoshi.
What'd you call me? - Mr. Takanoshi?
right. That's my name.
thought it might be drugs or something. - I think I know what it is.
are you really with Kamasaka Technologies?
damn it, we are high-powered Japanese executives.
we work hard, and we play even harder.
now, tell us what you see there...
...or we'll go find another candidate at Georgia Polytech.
it's anthracite.
coal. - Coal in Hazzard?
what's the street value of this? - This much? Nothing.
a good-sized mine? Could be millions.
can you show us what a good-sized mine looks like?
Yeah.
here's what it used to look like. And this is the after.
damn.
Hogg's gonna do this to Hazzard? - The hell he is.
Mr. Kamasaka? We have to go. The plane is leaving.
congratulations, Royce. You got the job. How does 24, 000 yen a year sound?
sounds like 40 bucks.
way to go.
all right, man. See you in Beijing.
you see two guys come through here? - You mean those two Japanese guys?
get me Atlanta P. D. Damn.
Strip-mining?
why, that slimy bastard.
here's another little nugget.
Hogg has been paying that kid Prickett a lot of money...
...to race here Saturday. - He's paying him?
y'all better get your asses back here quick as you can, got it?
Ten-four, Shepherd, this is Lost Sheep out.
what's this? What's these crackers doing in our place?
turns out Prickett came back because Hogg paid him a assload of cash.
don't mean Billy has anything to do with strip-mining.
you got to be kidding me.
Oh, shit. Roll them up.
what the hell is this, man? - Looks like somebody's lost.
look, a couple of white boys playing black. Is that's what's going on?
actually, we were at the geology lab for some environmental stuff, and...
no, I get it. They on one of these reality shows.
who Wanna Get They Ass Kicked? - Yeah.
why don't you two hillbillies join us up here for a minute?
actually, we prefer Appalachian-Americans.
man, get out the car!
now, which one of you two brothers is Michelangelo?
there's a certain creek that people sometimes canoe up without a paddle.
you could say that the Duke boys were on that particular creek right now.
let's kick they ass, Jerry!
never thought I'd say this, but, hot damn, it's the cops.
there goes the canoe.
give me your shoelaces. - What?
these guys over there gave me theirs. See, I'm gonna fashion myself a lasso.
when the jailer comes in, I'm gonna rope his keys.
Luke and Bo Duke are home free. Period, end of story.
I got on cowboy boots, cuz.
I like your style.
you gonna need those shoelaces?
we gonna have to get out of here.
Hey, Yul Brynner. We gotta make a phone call. We gotta call our lawyer.
what the hell are we in here for?
well, where should I start?
we know you're gonna strip-mine Hazzard.
do you, now? Well, that's good.
anything I can do for you? -Be happy.
three out of four of the last presidents have been governors... which is why I think we shouId target the money there rather... Just a second.
wouId you Iike me to take them? You couId have some time for yourseIf.
I can't think of anyone I'd less like to spend time with.
you sure? -I'm positive. Thanks.
aII right, weII, be carefuI. Stick with BeIIa.
Bye.
sorry. Target the money there rather than on congressional races.
Yes.
fatality.
fatality.
Oh, my God.
good morning.
Hey, I'm Olaf, Jeffrey's assistant. PIeasure to meet you.
so, Robert, we are interested in your script.
we're interested in The Dying Gaul. -Okay.
so, that's that.
your agent is... -Dead.
Yeah. Thanks.
Malcolm. Malcolm Cartonis.
I'm sorry. -Yeah.
thank you.
who's taken over for him? -WeII, nobody.
unfortunately, he was kind of a one-man band.
well, a good one obviously...
because I've read the script, and Kohlberg's read it.
he has?
we don't green-light anything without his approval.
Green-Iight?
no, I'm not saying we're making your script.
I'm saying we've aII read it, and we aII think it's good.
and that's why I'm taIking to you.
yes? -Your wife.
excuse me.
Hey. -Hi.
what's up?
did we buy something caIIed Mortal Kombat?
Why? What is it?
it's this incredibly graphic, vioIent video game...
with peopIe's brains blowing out of their head Iike tomato aspic.
honey...
I've got somebody in the office.
Oh, okay, sorry. -Okay? We'll take care of it.
caII me Iater. -Okay.
I Iove you. -Love you, too.
so, where do you think you wanna go with the script?
I'm sorry?
where eIse do you wanna go with the script?
weII, I thought I might take it to some of the independents.
no, no. What a doll you are.
what kind of work do you wanna do on it?
Oh, I'm sorry. -That's okay.
that was just so sweet.
from acceptance to total rejection, you took it all in stride.
what kinds of things have you thought about or...
weII, it's as far as I couId take it without some kind of input from a director.
and who's your dream director? -Gus Van Sant, I guess... since Truffaut is dead. -Good.
wouId you Iike me to show him the script? -Yeah, sure. Why not?
that's good. 'Cause I aIready have and he Iikes it.
I think I'm in the wrong office. -He has some questions, as we aII do.
and what's the titIe? ExpIain the titIe to me.
weII, you know, they go to that museum...
Ken and Maurice. -...in Rome... and they see the statue-- -Yeah.
but why is that the name of the movie?
hold on. -Because
sorry.
Oh, I see.
I see. Because they feeI that the sculpture... in depicting the vanquished, the dying soIdier...
no, thank you.
and the GauIs fought naked. -Right.
so, he's so young and defenseless... -Beautiful. ...with just this littIe hole in his side.
and being that the statue is by a Roman, by...
Wow.
...By someone from the side responsible for the slaughter.
and they identify with the Gaul, because they're gay...
and so many of their friends are dying...
and they're Iooking for some kind of response from the enemy.
right. -And remember that part...
when Maurice says...
"maybe some kind of compassion was awakened in the Romans... by seeing the sculpture?"
"and at some future time, as a result, maybe some other-- "
GauI. -Yes.
wiII be spared.
it's kind of oblique.
no, I understand. And it has a poIitical overtone.
that's right. Which I imagine-- -No, no.
we're not afraid of that. We're not afraid of anything.
the idea is to have the broadest appeal, so that we can make money.
but aIso...
so that to whatever degree the movie affects peopIe... it can aIso be kind of a dying GauI for the viewers.
I mean, if you even Iook at a movie Iike... weII, say, just to pick something, Tootsie... which we didn't make, but which is a very good movie.
Yeah. It's a great comedy. -Yeah.
it says something, in a smaII but totaIIy amusing way.
you don't see it coming. This guy is an arrogant... you know, chauvinist.
he, for his own reasons, feeIs he has to dress up as a woman...
and as a resuIt he Iearns something about what it means to be a man.
and you feeI good for him. -Yeah.
so that's the kind of political statement you can slip an audience... without their feeIing they've been had.
aII right.
weII, The Dying Gaul isn't a comedy, it's a weepy.
and these movies are very... hard... to sell.
they're very hard.
and they're my favorite kind of movie.
they just need to be made with care.
okay? So...
I understand your reasons for wanting the men to be men... because of the political dimension...
but Ken and Maurice-- -I'm not making them heterosexual.
no, no. PIease. -I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to jettison any of your principIes.
sorry.
I think I know what kind of person you are, Robert.
sorry. -I mean, I read your script.
you hungry?
earIy money is Iike yeast.
in other words... Oh, wait, hoId on.
HeIIo?
Oh, hi. Thanks for getting back to me.
listen, do you have any video games for an 8-year-oId... that don't involve human slaughter?
the Silence of the Lambs is another one that touches on feminist ideology without...
did you Iike that movie? -Yes and no.
did you make it? -No.
no, no. Why didn't you Iike it? -The faggy portrayal of the killer.
he's not gay. Jame Gumb is not gay. -Yeah, that's what I heard...
but I think that's a bunch of bullshit because he has the poodle.
I had a poodle.
my wife and I had a poodle.
okay, but I bet you didn't wear nipple rings and put on eyeliner.
and you probably didn't cut up women because you wanted to be one.
you never know. -True.
Hey, you wanna meet Tim Burton?
it's just something's not working.
let me check. -Is that a new battery?
I see.
what about Nick Cage?
I mean, he's losing his hair. What's that about?
so, do you want to seII this script? -Sure.
and do you wanna do the rewrites? -What do you mean?
I mean, are you interested in doing the rewrites or...
no. -...do you wanna seII the script outright?
no, I don't want somebody eIse mucking around with my script.
good.
Oh, hey, did you taIk to your dad? -Don't ask.
Why? What did he say? -My father teIIs me... if I dare set foot back in Egypt, he wiII have me beheaded.
as in...
look. Voilà. -Oh, hey. Yeah.
sorry you don't have an agent.
but Iet's...
what...
presumably, you are... looking for something universal in the experience of two gay men... which a broader audience wiII identify with. -You couId say that.
wouId that be a true statement?
now, don't say anything untiI... Okay?
most Americans...
let's hold aII my calls, pIease, Liz.
...hate gay peopIe.
they hear it's about gay peopIe, they won't go.
what about Philadelphia?
Philadelphia is a movie about a man who hates gay peopIe... and it's been done.
to get peopIe into the movie theaters... they have to think it's gonna be fun... or sensational, or some kind of...
make them feeI fantastic about themseIves.
no one goes to the movies... to have a bad time or to Iearn anything.
do we agree with this? -Yes.
what is important is what they Ieave the theater with.
and if they don't enter the theater... they don't get a chance to Ieave it.
is this acceptable to you as a thesis?
no?
no one is going to see The Dying Gaul.
if you couId make it with Tom Cruise... who wouldn't go near it for $100 million...
and get Spielberg to direct...
and reIease it on 400, 000 screens...
no one is going to see... The Dying Gaul.
now...
if we make Maurice a woman with AIDS...
and, Iet's face it, heterosexuals are getting AIDS... in disastrous numbers... Robert. -I want nothing to do with that.
we'II make our own version of The Dying Gaul... loosely based on your script.
fine.
or, or... Wait. Robert!
fuck.
you didn't let me finish.
or we'll give you $1 million for your script...
with which you can go out and write 400 new screenplays... about gay men with AIDS, without... whatever's the most important to you.
if you want the script so much-- -We think it is good, Robert...
and we will pay you for it.
we wiII not make The Dying Gaul with two men in bed... faIIing in Iove, surviving pain, and aII the bIah, bIah, bIah.
it's not gonna happen, ever.
ever.
ever!
where you going, Robert?
you have virtually no idea what $1 miIIion wouId mean to me in my Iife.
I'm stiII paying off my college loans.
I've written 15 spec scripts which no one wiII buy.
I'm paying child support.
and Malcolm, who just died, my agent, was aIso my lover.
I'm sorry.
so, I can't, in good conscience, take this money from you.
you are an amazing and lovely person, Robert...
and you have succeeded in making me feeI Iike a totaI scumbag.
good. I'm glad.
how's your heaIth? -I'm negative.
good. -Maurice and I... MaIcoIm.
God.
can't I write you another script? -We want The Dying Gaul... and we want you to write it.
take the miIIion.
write something eIse.
Hello? -Hi.
I knew you'd be up.
Hi.
I made $1 miIIion.
how? -I sold a script. Isn't that incredible?
after aII this time, I wanted to caII you and Mark first.
I'm gonna put a third of it aside for his coIIege fund.
is he awake?
well...
I'm happy for you, Robert. -Wait. Don't go yet, Kelli.
you ragged on me 1 7 ways when I didn't come to Malcolm's memorial.
I'm sorry. -You know I don't have money.
that isn't why you didn't come. -Well.
weII, okay.
I'd reaIIy...
it would mean a lot to me to share this with my son.
it's 2: 00 in the morning, honey.
okay.
weII, I'II caII some other time.
okay. Bye-bye.
I Iove you.
what?
we got it
Congratulations. May I read it?
weII, it's gonna change.
before it does, may I?
pIease? -Sure.
Hey. What's wrong?
teII me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
it's gonna be a beautifuI movie.
and you are gonna write more movies.
and soon you're gonna be able to write your own ticket.
I mean that, Robert.
look at Spike Lee. He writes movies he cares about... about his own peopIe, and they make money.
I want that for you, Robert.
give me a hug.
come on.
okay?
you are very handsome.
and I'm getting a little turned on.
are you?
you can do anything you want, as long as you don't caII it what it is.
understand?
Max, Debbon, I want you to meet someone. Come on.
hurry. Hurry.
what? Yes. That's why I'm not doing it.
robert is a screenwriter Iike Mommy used to be.
what a nice hat you have on.
she's going through a phase.
bath time. -No!
did I ask your opinion? Go! -No! No!
everyday!
Hey, couId you be Iouder? Did you offer him something to drink?
exactIy.
you have a chiId, Jeffrey says. -Yeah. In New York.
do you miss it? Screenwriting? -Oh, God, no.
I couId onIy write the kinds of scripts that Jeff wouId never make.
these agapanthus are beautifuI.
you know fIowers? -Elaine...
offer him something. -Can I offer you something to drink?
weII, I feeI Iike I shouId say spring water, but I'd reaIIy Iike a vodka.
Peppered? Lemon? Ketel One? -I'II drink them aII and stay aII night.
just a pIain.
but you shouId...
some of these plants.
okay. Yes. That's why I depend on you.
some view, huh? Yes.
okay.
there are days I wake up earIy...
okay. God love you.
I'II look out and think, " This is actuaIIy my home. "
when is someone gonna march in here... and demand their keys back? -Oh, God.
I wanna suck on you till there isn't a drop left... and lick you from head to toe and have you inside...
foreign markets and video.
you're gonna be abIe to have a second house looking down on us.
Oh, everyone looks down on us. That's nothing.
Cheers, Robert. -Thanks.
what does that mean?
I'II make a caII, then we'II go. -Okay.
what part of town do you Iive in, Robert?
Oh, God, I Iive in West Hollywood in a rental.
not for long.
I don't wanna change anything, for now. -Oh, you wiII. You wiII.
elevator going up, up and up.
the context shifts. Things you thought were luxuries become essential.
Cheers. -Cheers.
suddenIy your decisions are impelled... by your desire to own another Balthus, or Bacon.
this is the first money he's ever seen in his Iife.
he's not thinking about-- -No?
decide for yourseIf.
Cheers.
HeIIo? Yeah.
no, fuck him. Fuck him!
no, teII him I said it.
I'm perfect... Okay, this is my message...
'fuck you, Scott. "
fuck. If he asks why I'm angry, teII him I said, " Fuck you. "
okay? No, I'II put it on vibrate.
Jeff. -AII right, aII right.
I hate these test screenings. -Why are you here, then?
I hear about a project for years, sometimes, and I never meet the writers... untiI we come to the mall.
I think they shouId speII it M-A-U-L.
Thanks, Danny.
I insisted on meeting you... before I had to see you completeIy crestfallen...
if your movie ever does get made. Shaken, trembling, cast aside.
and Jeff made you sound like... there was a glint of a human being in there...
so I had to see for myseIf.
Hi.
he's gay!
who's this mother fucker?
keep your eyes on the road.
I can't stand it. Excuse me.
the road ahead of you instead.
okay.
you suck on that, okay?
Robert, your script is so beautifuI.
don't become one of them, aII right? -I won't.
I'm sorry about your friend. -So, what'd you guys think, huh?
when did he die? -January.
of this year?
so, you're... Oh, God.
rough.
sides of me, things I didn't even know existed have sprung up and taken over.
such as? -I'm, Iike, famished for distraction.
such as? -I don't know.
I can sit for days on end, literally, though, surfing the Internet.
do you do those chat rooms?
what? He doesn't have to answer. -I don't mind.
I Iove them, actuaIIy. -Here we go. Wish me Iuck.
they're like Iife after death, I think.
how so?
weII, there's no corporeal being. There's just aII these voices, you know?
weII, no, I haven't tried them, so...
weII...
you can make up anything about yourseIf, right?
right.
and do you know anything about Buddhism?
a bit.
buddhists believe in karma.
it's Iike the cumulative effect of aII our actions.
and that's what it's Iike...
just aII this karma colliding in the middle of nowhere.
what's your favorite really dirty chat room?
weII...
I Iike Men On A Park Bench, for one.
park bench?
Yes!
to be continued.
through the roof.
Oh, that's great. -Isn't that great?
Oh, I thought it was shit.
that is the nicest person. -Isn't he?
and the most fun I've had with anybody in the industry in years.
good.
Hey, I'm in the industry. -You are the industry.
you coming to bed?
I think I'm gonna just, you know, check on some things.
Hi. You've reached Robert Sandrich. Leave a message.
listen, I hope that wasn't too weird tonight.
she never goes to these things, but she insisted on meeting you. So...
she's... ...incredibly smart and frustrated and working on herself.
just being with you got me dripping tonight.
so sweet dreams.
thanks again for putting up with all the hoopla.
I don't think so.
Yes.
HeIIo. -Okay.
good luck.
watch, watch!
you okay? Sorry. -Excuse me.
excuse me.
look who emerged. How are you?
shrimp with saffron? -Hey, Iook who's here.
nothing. Thanks, anyway.
Oh, hey. -You a vegetarian?
you're not a Buddhist or something? -Yes, he is.
weII... -Yes.
here, that's got vegetables in it. -Jeff.
how's the revision going? -It's going great.
no? -No.
it's going great. -It's not.
weII, make him help. -He's the one who wants you... to change your perfect script. Perfect. -I've offered, beIieve me.
storm his office and demand he spend the entire day and...
Hi, Elaine. -Hey, Abe.
I need to find a great Iawyer.
my 1 4-year-oId somehow managed to find a way... to hack into the Defense Department database.
why don't you spend just an hour or so at my office?
okay. -ReaIIy?
that was... You aII right?
you sure?
Hi. You thought I was avoiding you, right? -A little.
are you all right?
you should pull that out. -This? Why?
I've been meaning to teII you.
that right there is monkshood, and over there.
the roots are dangerous.
ReaIIy? -Yes. Deadly.
I saw that. I saw that look.
you okay?
it was used... to make spearhoods, spearheads, and at executions...
you sure you're aII right? -Yes.
...in primitive cultures.
it shuts down the entire central nervous system compIeteIy.
you have to eat the roots, but still.
I don't think our chiIdren wiII be eating roots.
how do you know aII this? -Malcolm. He Ioved gardening.
I'm sorry.
he taught me stuff.
I think you shouId drink. Here.
thank you.
I'm gonna stay up a bit.
you wanna take a bath with me? -I'm wired.
I need to pace, or something.
you aII right? -Too much coffee.
okay. -I'II be in.
go away.
anyone here ever lost a friend or lover?
I have.
it's only been a few weeks.
it gets worse.
do you ever think of killing yourself?
all the time. See a shrink.
Oh, God.
got any recommendations? -Yes, Marta Foss in Santa Monica.
she's great. -Do you see her?
used to, for eons. My boyfriend did too.
how did he die? -TB of the brain.
they drilled holes into his skull and injected the meds right into his brain...
an experiment that didn't work, and put him through hell.
did you help him die?
damn it.
HeIIo?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I've never told anyone. -Wow. How come?
can't say.
Oh, God.
my grief has me thinking I'm losing my mind.
is that natural? -Yes.
what does one do?
trawl these rooms and sleep with all the wrong people.
like me? You don't wanna fuck me?
I've already sort of got somebody.
who?
Oh, just some guy. -Tell me.
it isn't interesting. -I'm interested.
well, he's my boss on a project... married, has two kids. I really like his wife.
see? Told you.
sounds hot!
well, you know how to reach me if you change your mind.
okay. See a shrink.
'Then, as Kabumpo shook his head again " ...
are you asIeep? -No.
please, God, don't let me eat this child.
'Anxious... Oh. Then as Kabumpo shook his head again...
'the big boxer started off " ...
catch it. Catch it.
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
baby. It's okay.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -It's okay.
I'm sorry. -It's okay.
it's okay, baby. It's aII right.
don't be. Don't be sorry.
you are so beautifuI. -No, I'm not.
I'II be the judge of that, thank you.
you wouIdn't Iike me if you really knew me. -Yeah?
wouId you care to elaborate?
no. -Good.
HeIIo? -Yeah, we got it all.
what? -Everything.
there was this ant when I was meditating, right after Malcolm's funeral.
it was a big red ant and it bit me.
and I couIdn't kiII it... because I thought, " What if that's him? "
but...
now...
and what about what I flush down the drain without even meaning to?
spiders and... stomping on them... microbes.
everything I feeI... or touch, is a potential slaughter.
you Iived. He didn't.
that's aII.
are you seeing someone, Robert?
what do you mean?
a shrink?
Oh, no, I did. But not now.
why did you stop?
I didn't want...
thank you.
I don't know. -It's none of my business.
no, it's not that.
but are you?
no. -What?
seeing someone.
you gotta use this.
you gotta promise to use this.
it's too fucking wacky.
make something good of this. Promise me.
I promise.
traitor.
what?
Hi, DG.
Hi.
can I sit beside you? -Sure.
do you mind if we just talk?
no.
how are you feeling? -Okay.
you sure? -Yeah.
you seem sad.
do I know you?
Yes.
sorry, I don't remember our chatting.
look at my name.
you're an angel?
Yes.
does that mean you do nice things? Is that what makes you an angel?
that's part of it.
did you have a different name when we talked?
Yes.
what was it?
if I tell you, you'll go away.
okay. So, did we have sex?
Yes.
more than once? -Yes.
Really? -Yes.
tell me what I like.
you're extremely versatile. You like kissing most of all.
am I right?
I didn't do it out of greed or envy.
I did it because there was nowhere left to go.
see, I'm nothing special.
I'm like everybody else getting by day by day, week by week, dreaming about that one thing that' ll make everything all right.
that one thing.
jd Couriers. May I have your account number, please?
another one? - Yep.
why are you bothering, kid?
you got a job for life here.
Yeah.
well, it's all here. You've got everything we're looking for.
great. Thank you.
we should be able to let you know sometime next week, so
can I ask you a question, sir?
I'm not gonna get this job, am I?
I really need this job. - I'm sorry.
a couple of years ago, you would have walked straight in, but now
I could start right away. I'd work for free for a month if you needed me to.
I'm sorry, son.
sorry?
Yeah, me too.
are you done?
Yeah.
I'm done.
Yeah, I had dreams, but they're over...
because one day you just gotta wake up.
you just gotta wake up.
Hi, Paul. - Hi, Mom.
how are you? - Pretty good.
how was your day?
Oh, you know-- same old, same old.
it'll come good.
I graduated two years ago. I'm still living with my parents.
well, do you hear us complaining?
Oh, I made you some sandwiches.
you know, just to keep that guilt thing going.
Where's Dad? - Working late.
you know, you're pretty late yourself.
I guess if I keep on studying, I can trick myself into believing I'm getting somewhere.
why haven't you filled these? - I'll get around to it.
ma, you need to take your medication.
they don't come free, Paul.
it's already wiped us out.
don't worry. I'll get better.
but in the end it wasn't about me.
it wasn't about me at all.
I'll get by.
it was about seeing pain and struggle and knowing there was not one thing you could do about it.
but not anymore.
not anymore.
Hey, bro.
Hey, how are you doing, man?
have you ever done it in a canoe before?
I thought a civilian snuck in.
you got a paddle?
come on, take a risk for once. Be more like your dad.
I'm good.
at least pretend you're cool.
what? You didn't want it anyway.
fucking bitch. - Aw, come on.
if you want a nice girl, there's plenty to choose from out there.
I love this song.
what are you thinking about?
paul: You.
I'm thinking about how smart you are.
you get me.
Yeah.
I knew from the second I saw you.
we're the same, aren't we?
Yeah.
we're the same.
it's so good to be with someone who sees through all the bullshit, - somebody with a vision.
I'm going to see Dean again tomorrow.
are you sure he can handle it?
I mean, he can lose it big time. - Yeah well, we need him if we're gonna go through with this.
when's that gonna be?
when I'm sure.
you wanna go out tonight?
no, tonight's not good.
why don't we-- we'll do it some other time.
it's not good any night. You don't want to be seen with me or something.
is it so bad I want you all to myself?
no.
you know I love that.
I love you.
I gotta go.
and I love you too.
all right, on three. One, two, - three. - Aw, fuck it.
Oh God, what is that, like a double?
triple. - Give me another.
no no no, finals week, remember?
we gotta go, we gotta go. - Oh, who cares? Come on.
Oh yeah, screw that. Don't forget we've got a boys' night on Friday.
a boys' night-- yeah, I can't wait for that.
come on, buddy. We gotta keep the old fellas happy.
no, enough enough. We've gotta go.
Oh, what is this? Middle-age practice?
you know, you two would have made such a good couple.
really, it's just-- - You're right, actually.
I've just got too much fucking to do. - Okay.
let's go.
Oh, my bag -- gimme.
Oh, Nick, don't forget everybody sucks but us.
Hi, Ma. - Hey.
what's going on? - Nothing much.
I got you something.
here.
where did you get the money for it? I mean insurance won't pay for it. - It obviously did.
I can't afford it.
the doctor said you gotta take two of these pills a day.
remember to do that, okay?
ma?
no no, see, th - they can't.
they can't just do this.
Paul. I'm so afraid.
Oh, Mom.
it's okay.
I'm so sorry.
I'll take care of this, okay?
a few days, the world's gonna know who you are, Dean.
you ever think about that?
I have, yeah.
I can't do this on my own, Dean.
and we are all on our own.
not anymore.
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick
maybe she's right about you.
I thought she was just falling for your blue eyes.
listen, if you guys have a thing going on, - I don't want to get in the way. - We're just friends. That's it.
you haven't called her or anything, have you?
no, I haven't called her.
why would I
I lost my cell anyway.
go figure.
Yeah.
why don't you go grab me a beer?
Yeah.
so tell me, is that just a word?
I gotta do something with my Friday nights, huh?
okay, so that's two tickets to Guadalajara this Saturday the 27th.
that's it. You're all set.
anything else I can help you with, sir?
no, I've got everything I need.
thank you.
sorry. I would have called, but
no, I know -- no communication, no trace.
it's safer that way until it goes down, right?
you mean
Yeah.
when?
tomorrow.
I'll do anything you want. - Yeah.
I know you will.
I know.
now don't forget, Nick, we're at Cliff's this year.
dad, I won't forget, okay? Yeah, I gotta go. See you tonight. Okay, bye.
what are you doing?
you won't be needing those anymore.
I will if I don't pass.
Nick, we passed the day we were born.
accept it, man. We don't live in the real world.
we don't have to. It's for those dumb fucks over there.
you're such a people person, you know that?
Hey, what's going on with Hailey?
this childhood sweethearts thing-- that's getting kinda old, man.
you're crazy about her, right?
God help me, yeah. Yeah, I am.
is she crazy about you?
Yeah. No. Yeah yeah yeah, of course she is.
then God help your Amex.
you're actually gonna have to do a day's work. That's funny.
that is really hilarious.
well, when that happens, I'll let you know what it feels like, pal.
Oh oh yeah!
Oh oh oh!
I hope you never get to hear this.
but if you do, if this all goes wrong,
I want you to know that I did it to make things right.
just to make things right.
I love you.
aren't we getting a little old for these family vacations?
I mean, being out in the middle of nowhere is fine when you're 12, but the novelty's kind of wearing off.
well, you still have to have your little poker night before the girls are even - allowed in the door. - Apart from our homecoming queen.
thank you. - Hey, we're out of beer there, hotshot.
this do instead? - Yes.
that does very well. - Whoo-hoo!
Oh, there we go.
this is what you're gonna do.
this is what you're gonna do.
this is what you're gonna do.
this is what you're gonna do.
man: It's a shitty color.
what? - This brown is like dark blue or gray-- it's ugly.
it's charcoal. - No no no, it's not.
it's charcoal? - It's charcoal.
it's charcoal. - Yeah.
but the best part is I can't see your house from here.
well, Bob's late. - He wouldn't be Bob if he was on time.
he's been that way since fifth grade, you know that.
the kids are gonna get here before him, you know?
at least we'll have some time with them.
how's work going?
safe, for now. You?
well, you know. It's work.
it's good.
Oooh, yikes. Look at that.
what? It's a watch. - Yeah.
what's your secret?
you bend the rules and I just squeeze the shit out of them.
you win big, you lose big, that's what I say. What am I gonna tell you?
you know what? We're on vacation. No more work talk.
good. Sure, don't bring it up again. - All right.
I just heard a loon.
Bob's here?
what do you think you're doing?
Hey, are you deaf?
what are you doing?
I'm waiting for someone.
waiting for somebody. Okay, who are you waiting for?
you.
Where's your boat? I didn't see the boat.
Hey, Avis, this is great.
I couldn't have done it without Frank.
uh-- - Frank, look at you.
you missed your calling. - No, I'm very happy behind the wheel.
no, I can just see a nice floral apron. It would suit you.
Thanks. - Avis, the kids are gonna love it.
now get yourself home.
Oh, only if you're sure that's all you need.
I'm sure. Home.
okay. Good night.
Frank, I'm gonna need you to hang around.
Bob can put them away, so we might need you to give him a ride home later.
yes sir. Mm-hmm. - Okay?
go relax in the den, okay?
why won't you let-- why doesn't he just stay here?
he could, but he's not gonna. - Why?
that new blonde? - Oh oh oh!
she reminds me of my second wife, except I didn't have to buy her tits.
party time, my friend. - Party time.
fuck.
all right, on three we try-- try to grab my hand.
no, this is-- pull pull!
Hailey: I can't. - Fuck! Aw, fuck.
Shhh.
please.
Jeff: What do you want?
Oh God. - Don't you touch her!
Nick: Let us go. - Hailey: Please!
Nick: Just let us go. We can help you.
we can get you anything you want. Just please don't-- don't hurt her.
please don't hurt her.
answer me!
please just
where the hell is Bob?
he's probably checking the tax on his grocery bill.
that's why he's worth 10 times more than us put together, right?
except when it comes to Jeff.
Oh, Jeff, yeah right.
now what do you suppose he got him for graduation?
probably socks from Switzerland.
and aftershave. - From Paris!
that better not be him.
Hey, why don't you ditch the suit? Freshen up.
are you hitting on me?
hello.
Mr. Jones? - Yes?
Mr. Clifford Jones? - Yeah.
you have a daughter named Hailey? - Yes.
that's right. - No, actually that's wrong.
I have her.
I've also got Bob and Slick's boys.
you want to talk to them? - What is it?
fuck.
don't fucking touch her! - Tell us what you fucking want!
don't fucking touch her. Don't touch her.
just talk to us. Leave her alone. - Fuck. Tell us!
all right.
so this is what's gonna happen
what the hell's going on? If you so much as touch a hair on my daughter's
why don't you cut the "if you touch her, I'm gonna kill you"
fucking shtick, you jackass, okay?
I'm gonna tell you what to do, you're gonna do it and that's gonna be it.
it's as simple as that, okay?
do you understand?
okay.
great.
I want a million dollars from each and every one of you.
that's $3 million. I want you to call your lawyers and begin the bank arrangements. There's gonna be no drop offs, no suitcases full of money, this is it.
I will call you in half an hour with the bank accounts.
do you have any questions?
I said any questions?
no. - And if you decide to call the police, go right ahead.
all they're gonna do is clutter up your house and delay our business.
and in that case, save your money. I'll say goodbye to your kids for you.
were they scared?
Yeah. - Fucking pussies.
I love it. The one who was driving makes me want to puke.
it'll all be over in a couple of hours.
well, I mean, it won't all be over.
will it?
no, it won't.
fuck! Voicemail again.
the one time we need him.
let's call the police. - Okay, we call the police, does that increase the chance of catching this psycho? Yeah, it does.
does it also increase the chance of something happening to our kids?
Yeah, it does and I don't like those odds.
this is not a business deal. - That's exactly what this is!
this is a business deal and I'm doing risk assessment.
I'm not risking Nick's life because you want to do what you think is the right
okay, then let's get out there and do something to try and find them.
well, Cliff, where do we start?
we're gone and the guy calls, then what?
all right.
we've gotta wait for Bob. - Bob's not here.
look, we don't have time to make a debate about this.
all right, we need to stick together. We can't afford to antagonize this guy.
all right, let's just do what he says.
here.
call your guy.
I'm going back downstairs.
Dean, you've got to stay up here.
no more than two people down there. You know the rules.
somebody has to be up here to keep watch.
Yeah, so she can do it. She can stay then.
no, Dean,
I need you for the big stuff.
okay?
got it? - Yeah.
everybody happy? - Fuck you!
Oh yeah?
why don't I just fuck you?
what the fuck? - Hmm?
transfer arrangements have been made?
Yes. - Good.
it should take a couple of hours to work its way through the system and then they'll be freed. I want you to take this number down.
there's something you should know. Bob Vincent hasn't arrived yet.
where is he? - He's late.
he's late?! - What's going on?
it doesn't mean anything. He'll be here any minute.
no, that's bullshit. They're not gonna fucking pay us!
they will! - They'll pay whatever you want.
shut your fucking mouth! - Just give me a second, all right?
which one's missing? - Hey, you fucking cool it.
look a --- Which-- which one is fucking missing?
the guy in the middle. Hey, all right,
I'll give Mr. Vincent another half an hour and that's it.
that's bullshit! Can't you see they're fucking playing us?
Hey, just fucking cool it, okay? Look at me. Cool it.
okay?
all right? We're gonna take what we can get.
okay.
we'll take what we can get.
okay, so I want you to take this number down.
fucking bitch.
if we're not gonna wait, we don't really need this asshole, do we?
Jeff! Jeff!
No! - God.
what the fuck?
what is wrong with you? We were gonna do it anyway.
give me that. Get the fuck out of here.
No! - Jeff!
you fucking bitch! Fucking bitch!
you fucking bitch!
listen to me... - Dad! That shouldn't have happened, okay?
but if you don't want anything like that to happen again, - you'd better fucking listen to me. - What the hell have you done?
you killed an innocent boy? - Just listen to me!
bank of Lucerne, - account number 0370995-- - You've got to say that again.
please, Dad! - Account 0370995731. - Dad!
No! Fuck! - Again.
you know the deal-- false names, money there for five seconds and then out.
it'll take two months to track it down and by then I'll be gone.
you've got till 3: 00 a.m.
3: 00 a.m.
Nick, what are they doing?
Jeff. - Fuck.
I know the banks are closed. What do you think, I'm a fucking moron?
just -- use one of the foreign accounts, Chuck!
I'll explain it to you another time.
I gave you the details, now just fucking do it!
are they giving you trouble?
I guess it's not every day that they're asked to transfer a million bucks.
he called you Slick.
what? - The first time he phoned he called you Slick.
are you sure?
I haven't called you that since college.
you're the only one who ever did.
what's going on, Rick?
if there's anything else you need, I can
is something wrong?
are you gonna stick to the goddamn plan from now on?
what's the big deal? - The big deal is you just fucking killed somebody.
is that an everyday occurrence for you? - He deserved it, didn't he?
anyway you're the one who's been telling me for months how we're gonna fuck them over. Right?
stick it to them, destroy their perfect fucking little lives.
I thought you'd be-- I thought that's what you fucking wanted.
it's not.
I'm sorry, okay?
I just want to make you happy.
that's all. I-- I love you. I would do anything for you.
well, then stick to the fucking plan.
you know, why did she get to do that?
don't worry, you'll get your turn. - Yeah, I'd better.
I didn't come out here to just channel surf.
I know. - Good.
this place is covered in our prints.
fibers and all that shit-- you know that too?
that's why we're gonna burn it down after we're done.
you got it all figured out, don't you?
Dean, what's your problem?
I'm looking at it.
how's that?
you just don't add up. - Meaning?
well, you say you want to fuck them, but really you want to be them.
Really? - Yeah.
is that it? - No.
no, this is just your little shortcut into the club, isn't it?
isn't it?! - Oh yeah.
you're right, Dean, except for one little thing.
there isn't going to be a club left, is there?
Oh God, Nick!
Shh shh shh! It's okay.
we're going to be okay. Okay?
please don't touch her.
please don't touch her. - Shut the fuck up.
she's gonna want to look her best, like the little doll she is.
please don't.
we'll get you the money. I promise we will.
this isn't about money. - Why are you doing this?
what the fuck is this about? - This is about you.
you think you rule the fucking world, huh?
well, not tonight you don't.
sit still.
there's a new show in town tonight, one night only.
what are you talking about?
my boyfriend's a really clever guy.
Mmm. - Mm-hmm.
he planned the whole thing. But he's a bit predictable.
so we thought: what's the best way to end any show?
hmm?
well, it's obvious, isn't it?
with a bang.
what what? - But don't worry, it's not for you.
it's for the folks back at home.
see, 3: 00 a.m. they'll be sitting there, thinking they've done their duty, and I guess you can say we'll blow the fucking roof off.
Hey, have you ever opened up a modem before?
what? - There's nothing there.
just a circuit board and a lot of empty space.
you really can put anything in there.
anything.
and if it's attached to a laptop and it's programmed to detonate like your daddy's is, well, 3: 00 a. m.
no.
Oh Jesus.
Oh man.
how long is this gonna take?
cliff, just take it easy, okay? - How the hell do you remain so calm?
because us panicking isn't going to help our kids.
all right?
we'll get them home.
we have to.
that's Bob. - Okay.
so what are we gonna tell him?
anything but the truth. He'll go to the cops.
anything but the fucking truth.
Cheers.
coming!
okay.
Oh, Bob. - Howdy, campers!
you're late. - Hey.
guys, I don't blame you for being pissed off.
same old story, right?
am I talking to myself here?
no no. - So I'm a couple of hours late.
what's the big fucking deal? There's no harm done, is there?
good seeing you.
I can guess who that is. Looks like I'm not the only one who's late.
just get the phone. - Yeah? You talk to him.
Yeah. Just get the phone.
yeah?
Oh hi, sweetheart.
hey yeah, no. Everything's great.
Bob just got here.
no, she hasn't arrived yet either, but you know how it is.
no, not tonight. No, you'll see her tomorrow.
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
Yeah, good night, honey.
Jesus, you'd think they'd leave us alone on our one night of freedom!
Hey, guys, listen, I brought a great surprise for Jeff.
in fact I drove it here. He's gonna love it!
what? - If I roll this, I think it - I think it's loose.
Nick, Nick, hurry.
Oh God.
fuck.
okay okay.
okay, all right, okay.
okay okay.
wait a second, Hailey, wait a second. Shh shh shh.
Shh-hhh.
it's okay. Be quiet.
okay? Okay?
all right?
hurry.
all right, all right.
okay okay, you're okay.
okay okay okay.
I don't believe this.
what?
we're at my dad's house.
okay.
well, you really did think of everything.
Yeah, it's even better than you promised.
to chaos.
to the American dream.
something's wrong.
Yeah, they should be here any minute. - No, come on.
how long does it take to fix a flat?
you're not gonna get a signal on that up here, Bob.
top you up? - Yeah, thanks.
Dick? - Yeah.
it went right to voicemail.
Hey, is Frank here?
Yeah. - So what are you waiting for?
send him out to find them.
th-there's no point.
what's he gonna do? - There's, um, there's something that we haven't told you.
what is it? - Dick.
no, it's all right, Cliff.
Jeff got pulled over for a DUl.
Oh, God damn it!
and made us promise not to tell you, but I-- I'm sorry.
I knew there was something going on between you two.
shit!
I'd better get down there. Where are they?
you'd just be wasting your time. We called your lawyer.
he's gonna have them out in a couple hours.
I'm still going. - No no, just
you know what? Let them sweat it out for once.
all right? It'll teach them a lesson.
you know how they are.
Yeah.
you're right.
champagne? Cheers.
Jesus, I can't believe it.
her father's place is the only place within miles.
there's only two ways to get there-- they can take the road.
nobody's gonna be around this time of night so they're gonna take the forest.
stay together, go due north. I've gotta stay here and wait for the money.
they may just hole up somewhere till daylight.
that's fine. As long as they're not there to stop it, I don't give a fuck.
they're not gonna wait till daylight. - Why not?
cause I told them about our surprise. - You what?!
why would you do that? - You fucking dumb ass!
I don't know. Fuck-- fuck off. - She fucked the whole thing up!
fuck you. - Shut up, enough.
I was afraid-- - I'm through taking orders.
you'll still find them. Shut the fuck up.
I'm not going. There's no point in going.
why'd you do that? - I don't know.
what's the fucking point?! - The point is you have a chance to change something, okay?
you have a chance to convince the world you're not the same fucking loser you've been every other goddamn day of your fucked-up life.
okay? That's the point!
you know what?
I'm getting kinda tired of this place anyway.
Dean, I want them back alive.
Hey.
go.
fuck.
are you sure we're going in the right direction?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Nick!
Nick!
okay okay, we'll stop just for a sec.
we're never gonna make it. - We still have three hours.
we'll make it.
I still can't believe we were in your father's house.
Yeah. - I mean, this is seriously fucked up.
you know?
Yeah, I know.
all right, let's go.
Hey, that's gotta be them now. - I got it.
Hello?
hey hi, Bill.
Oh really?
Hey, that's great news.
Yeah. Good good.
okay thanks, buddy.
Bye. - Who was that?
my broker.
you know-- some deal he was working out.
at 1: 00 in the morning? - That's what I pay him for.
eh, you gotta give me his number.
your money's gone through? - Yeah.
well, I haven't heard anything. This is taking way too fucking long.
get on it. - I... I...I gotta go make a call.
there's a phone right here. - It's, uh, it's it's a personal call.
you mean a woman? You got a little action going?
I'll be right back. - Then you're gonna share, right?
yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Oh God.
I miss cassettes. I could work cassettes.
Oh yeah? - Cliff?
come here for a minute? - Yep.
I'm sorry, Bob. This won't be long.
what the hell is up with you two tonight?
it's nothing. I'll explain it later. - Okay.
what's going on? - I just talked to Chuck.
Yeah, what? - I don't have enough to cover it.
what? - Everything's - it's tied up.
you're kidding me.
what are you gonna do?
fuck.
fuck.
how much? - $750, 000.
what?
Oh, come on.
don't hold out on me, Cliff. - That's a hell of a lot of money.
for Nick's life? - No, of course not.
not for Nick's life. I haven't got it.
what? You think I'm lying to you?
this is our kids' lives we're talking about
exactly. - You think I'm lying to you?
okay, what the fuck is going on?
tell me.
the kids have been abducted.
wh-- what are you talking about?
they've been kidnapped. - Kidnapped?
is this for real?
Yeah, it's for real.
Jesus Christ.
w-where are they? Are they hurt?
no. - Is Jeff-- is Jeff okay?
Bob...
I want you-- - Jeff's okay.
fuck.
are you okay?
are you okay? - This is bullshit.
why can't we just go to the road and get some help?
there's no help, Hailey, okay?
it's the middle of the night and we're in the middle of nowhere.
now let's go. Come on. Come on.
stop! Stop acting like you're in charge.
we're going to the road! - Look, I'm telling you that
come on, come on, come on.
I can't believe you didn't tell me the minute I walked through the fucking door.
that was my idea. I'm sorry. - Always playing an angle, aren't you?
gimme that account number.
what are we doing? We gotta tell him.
nothing's changed. He'll call the cops.
his kid's dead and we're letting him throw away a million bucks?
it's the only way I can save my kid.
you couldn't fucking help me, could you?
Christ. - Christ what?
and you would do some
done.
Hey, Ma, um...I know you're sleeping, but, um...look, I um, I-- I was just calling you 'cause I'm gonna - I'm gonna be home a little late tomorrow.
yeah? - Yeah, we got it.
Oh man, that's so awesome. - Give that to me.
give it to me, come on!
what's going on? - Let them go.
we don't need them anymore.
just sit back, enjoy the fireworks. Meet me at the gas station.
I'll be right there.
Wow. Well, if that's what you really want.
you take the road.
I'm going straight on. - What' d he say?
kill them.
it can't be much longer. They can't be that far away.
how do we know? They could be anywhere.
I don't know, I'm just assuming. They were on their way here.
you know, I really admire your confidence, Rick.
what do you mean?
well, you seem to be pretty sure that this guy's gonna let them go.
why is that?
Hailey, come on.
what the fuck is the matter with you?
Oh, come on. Don't tell me it hasn't crossed your mind, Nick.
that we just happened to be in your father's place?
that they knew it would be open? - No no, it hadn't crossed my mind.
I mean, do you think it's that obvious? Do you think it's that simple?
Yeah, maybe it is.
I'm his son, Hailey.
he's not gonna hurt me.
well, you're not hurt, are you, Nick?
Jesus Christ.
what the fuck am I doing with you?
and you're a real catch, huh? A hero?
Jeff is dead! You didn't stop them!
you didn't do anything! - What the fuck was I supposed to do, Hailey?
look, you'll get your money. You don't have to do this.
but I want to. - Please, no. No, please!
Nick: Go go go!
go!
go!
fuck you!
I've got my money. - Okay, what about our kids?
you got what you wanted. - You'll get them back in an hour.
this is the last time you'll be speaking to me. In the meantime, I don't want you to make or take any phone calls. Do you understand?
Yes. - Good. And by the way, tell your kids the show has been canceled.
what? - They'll know what I'm talking about.
okay, I need to know our kids are safe.
they're safe.
he got the money.
he says he'll have them back in an hour.
excuse me, Mr. Jones, can I call my wife?
she panics if I'm -- I'm sorry, not tonight.
of course. I'm sorry.
don't you ever get tired of knowing your place, Frank?
no sir. - Don't call me sir.
I'm not paying your goddamn wages. - All right, that's enough.
is it?
I think I can say exactly what I want right now.
okay, say exactly what you want right now, Bob.
well, you know what they say about these things, don't you, Richard?
no, go on, tell us, Bob.
that they sometimes turn out to be an inside job.
am I right, Cliff?
you're not serious? - You're the one who needed the money.
are you outta your fucking mind?
it's the truth, isn't it?
well, how come you suddenly have no money, you come in here like you're king of the hill?
you want the truth? Here it is.
but who wants to hear that in the land of milk and fucking honey?
I'm done!
fucking happy?
Hey, Richard, just one question.
is this one of your pump-and-dump scams?
bail out when the price gets high enough?
wh-- where is this all coming from? - I'm just asking.
what, are you two guys the sons of the soil, huh?
I got news for you-- we all do the same fucking thing.
we push numbers around and we fuck everybody else as long as we get ours.
end of story.
only your numbers don't always add up, do they?
and right now you decided that that bothers you?
no, right now you're the odd man out.
yeah? - Yeah.
not tonight, Bob. That's you.
Oh, and how's that?
tell me!
all right, I'm sorry. Let's just cool it.
all right, we're saying shit that we don't mean.
let's just keep it together.
they killed Jeff.
come on, we've got to get them out of the house.
don't don't don't.
what? - Come on.
come on, come on, pick up the fucking phone.
we're too late. - No, we're not too late.
fuck 'em. Try the cops.
you killed my best friend, you bitch. You fucking killed him!
no, fuck you!
Nick, stop!
Nick, stop!
Nick.
I recognize her. I've seen her around campus and the other one.
all right?
Yeah.
I think you're right.
come on.
come on, let's go.
come on.
here, Bob. That could help.
Oh Christ.
it would have helped if you'd saved my son.
Bob, there was nothing that we could do.
we didn't have a chance to save him, Bob.
I had to tell them that you weren't here.
why the hell did you tell them I wasn't here?
why did they have to know that? - Because I was stalling him.
I didn't know if we could get the money together.
our kids' lives were at stake. - No, my kid's life was at stake!
my kid! - Bob, you weren't here.
we couldn't have saved him.
Oh.
well, you certainly got your shit together when it came to taking my money, didn't you, Rich?
what else could I do? Let them kill Nick too?
you'll get your money back, okay? Every cent.
fuck you!
all right, let's just say that I accept everything you've said.
you don't seriously think I'm going to sit here all night while the psycho who's got my money killed my son-- just walks away?
we don't have any choice. - Well, you might not have a choice, but I do and I choose to do something about it.
no, Bob, Bob, I'm not going to let you do that.
gimme the phone! - No!
you're not calling the police. - Maybe if you had Jeff would still be alive.
no, if you were here, he'd still be alive, Bob!
if you were fucking here!
you fucker. - No, God damn it.
let go. - Come on.
let go of me!
fuck!
where did they go?
I don't know.
get up. Get up.
get up! Which way?
who cares?
fucking asshole.
you're the fucking asshole!
you're the fucking asshole.
get up!
stupid motherfucker.
what's with this? Where's mine, huh? That's not my car.
she was like that when I got here. They must've...
where did they go?
I don't know. They're alive.
that's what you wanted, isn't it? Hmm? Blanks!
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't be able to control yourself, Dean.
fucking smart ass.
well?
what are we waiting for?
let's get out of here. It's gonna blow any second.
Dean?
you were right.
you're all on your own.
I knew it.
I knew it. I fucking knew it!
how could I be so fucking dumb? - See, Dean, you're not dumb. You're unstable.
you're antisocial and you have a grudge against society like your friend here.
okay? Two freaks fucking pissed off at all those rich college kids they see walking across campus every day.
nobody's gonna be surprised that you tried a thing like this.
nobody.
you won't get away with it.
Oh. No, see, I don't have to get away with anything.
as far as they're concerned there were only two people.
there's the girl-- who's dead and the guy on the phone.
that's yours, by the way.
it's a shame about the plane tickets you bought with this credit card.
you're not going to be able to use those.
I don't exist, you understand?
there's no trail, no evidence.
nothing.
Oh, you're clever.
Yeah, but when the house blows, they'll find something-- some trace. They always do.
and you will go down. You will fucking go down!
you will go down for it.
God, you really are stupid, Dean.
a bomb?
the transmitter, the house blowing up?
Really? I just made that shit up to turn you on, Dean.
see, I know everything about you.
everything.
and soon they will too.
they're gonna know that you have big highs and even bigger lows.
the thing that you've tried before.
the second time's a charm.
Hailey! - Daddy!
Nick! - Oh, thank Christ.
Hey, we gotta get out of here. The whole place is about to blow.
what do you mean? - Your laptop, it's a detonator and the modem's rigged with explosives. It's a big finale.
my laptop? - It was supposed to go off - like 10 minutes ago. - I never bring my laptop here.
what? - Maybe that's what he meant.
the last thing he said to me was to tell them - the show's been canceled. - Why would they even tell us that - in the first place if-- - Probably just to mess with your heads.
Oh fuck. - Did you ever have anything to do with these people before? Because they seem to know us.
these two kids, we think we've seen them before around campus.
Nick: Yeah. - All right, well, all that matters - is that you're safe.
Nick, it's them.
no no, it can't be. They've got the money.
no, but they came after us. - What do you mean they came after you?
we just escaped. What the hell do you think we're doing here?
I don't know him. Do you? - No, it's not them.
can I help you?
Paul.
dad. - What happened to you?
there was this guy at the gas station.
he had this girl knocked out at his feet.
that's the same people who got us. - Anyway, I was gonna keep on driving, but he pulls out a gun and tries to pull me out of the goddamn car and that's when-- anyway, I managed to hit him and I got away, but I think I got pretty lucky, you know?
well, come on in.
Thanks.
so do we know who they are? - Yeah-- well, we don't know them.
they, um, they held us ransom.
and they killed our best friend.
you're kidding? - Are you kidding, Hailey?
Mr. Vincent, I am so sorry.
we loved Jeff.
but there was nothing we could do.
I think it's time we called the cops. - I already called them.
they're on their way. - Paul, what are you doing here?
mom's worried sick.
you always call when you're gonna be this late.
and I kept calling and calling but there was no answer.
we heard it ringing, but they told us not to answer the phone.
listen, come on in, come on in.
Hey.
didn't Frank used to bring you around when we were kids?
Yeah, but then -- You -- you had your own friends.
I just thought it was better that we didn't impose.
dad, it was in our house.
what?
where they held us.
but you got away, right?
Yeah. - When?
I don't know. Three, maybe four hours ago.
no, what he wants to know is did you get away before he paid up.
no, Bob, that's not what I meant.
there's just one thing, Nick.
did you know your big-shot daddy was broke?
for God's sake. - Bob: Now how about that?
but it's okay. I spotted him a couple of bucks.
it's nothing, Nick.
where are these cops?
we're a long way out of town, sir.
yeah well, and in the meantime these fuckers are getting away.
Where's my lighter?
we'll arrange for you to come down and make a formal statement.
any time, Officer.
I don't know what kind of country we're living in anymore.
what happened to our kids? - I wish I knew.
that's just the way it is.
at least your son's okay.
you're both free to go.
Oh, and one more thing
we're gonna need to check your car for prints.
you can pick it up tomorrow.
Yeah, of course.
there you go. - Come on, we'll take mine.
let's get out of here.
Dick: And here we are. - Yeah, that's about it.
Thanks.
Nick: Bob, why don't you let us give you a ride home?
you shouldn't be on your own.
good idea. - I'll call you.
Bye, Hailey. - Okay.
Nick?
all those things I said...sorry.
cigarette?
all right.
are you okay, son?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I can't go back there.
you don't have to.
Hey, Pop.
everything's going to be okay.
everything.
we played by the rules.
I wanted to play by the rules.
but that's the big lie.
it's not enough anymore.
so maybe just once
I'm the man who pulled the plane out of the sky to save your life.
what do you want?
release sophia and the rest of the detainees, like you promised to.
that promise was based on the premise that we were both being honest with each other.
Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses.
release sophia and the detainees, or this time, people will die.
it's burning!
call the nurse, I have to get out!
no, no, no, no! Let me out!
why can't somebody tell me what the hell is going on?
please just tell me what the hell is going on.
nurse! Nurse!
Mr. Buchanan. We're only trying to help you.
what is happening?
tell me! Tell me! -Mr. Buchanan
what is happening?
the hemorrhaging is getting worse, and the symptom set is widening.
the passengers' nervous systems, and now their cognitive functions are under attack.
but from what?
do you know what's wrong with them yet? - Blood tests show no sign of viral or bacterial infection.
I think we're looking at a foreign, or, possibly extra-terrestrial organism.
well, then at least we have clarity about who is doing this to them.
Sophia's people, this group of sleepers, including this man, thomas, that she kept secret from us all these years.
regardless of the cause of infection, do we have a way to treat them, to make them better?
we've tried everything, it's impossible to treat what we don't understand.
if the passengers continue to decline at this rate, none of them will be alive by morning.
Mr. President, a man identifying himself as thomas just called in to the white house switchboard, asking to speak to you.
we're attempting to run a voice match to the first call you received from him.
I'll recognize his voice.
I assume that means you want to take the call?
absolutely, put him through. - Have nsa throw everything they've got at tracing the call.
I already have them on it, sir. Put it through.
you're on the line with the president. - Mr. President
I assume by now you realize the 183 passengers aboard flight 514
do not have long to live.
correct?
what do you want?
I have a counter agent, an antidote that can reverse the process.
save their lives.
meet my demands, and I'll get it to you.
your demands?
release sophia and the detainees in inostranka.
all 96 of them.
you know I can't do that.
then this conversation's over, and the passengers will die.
you listen to me, you son of a bitch - You have two hours, to make arrangements for the release of my people.
I'll call you back then.
they spotted us, they'll be here soon
we have to move everyone out.
no. There are too many wounded, we wouldn't get far.
I need you to gather all the able bodied and get ready to go.
what about you?
I can't abandon them.
no.
unless you go, there's no hope...
for any of us.
there is if we fight.
listen to me.
I can't risk all of us being caught.
we'll be together soon, I promise.
now, go.
Thomas! Thomas, come on.
come on, they're almost here. We got to go.
everybody! Let's go, come on!
let's go!
Thomas, we have to stop.
let people rest.
not yet.
look.
everybody, wait here until we know it's safe.
it's empty.
look at that.
all this food.
it doesn't look like anybody's been here in a while.
ship didn't survive the crash.
we're trapped here.
we'll have to figure out another way to get home.
what about sophia and the others?
we can't just leave them behind.
I have no intention of that.
first things first.
come take a look at this.
what is it?
they're still using vacuum tubes.
they're nowhere near the level of technology we're gonna need to get back.
we'll figure something out.
that's easy for you to say.
Sophia didn't saddle you up with getting it done.
she chose you for a reason, thomas.
because she believes in you.
it'll take years.
no luck with the trace, sir.
Mr. President, I understand the natural inclination - to want to save the passengers, - but the truth is, we have no reason to trust this man.
and I don't need to remind you it's the long-standing policy of this country not to negotiate with terrorists.
you're right, you don't need to tell me that.
I'd also like to point out that releasing sophia and the detainees in return for the antidote will be perceived as weakness and will only encourage the enemy to make bigger demands in the future.
the people on that plane are innocent.
some of them are children. - And it's tragic.
but what this man thomas is doing is an act of war.
and in war, there are casualties.
it's unavoidable.
we'll reconvene in two hours.
before he calls back in.
Thomas, listen to me. It's not too late.
hand over the antidote in good faith and there's a chance we can repair the damage you've already done.
Why?
we both know what kind of man martinez is.
idealistic and indecisive.
when push comes to shove, he'll cave.
you can't turn us into murderers.
what does it matter? They're all going to die anyway.
Sophia's been fighting for the release of our people in inostranka for the last 66 years.
and she got nothing.
I'm sick of waiting.
now, we're gonna do things my way.
and by tomorrow, our people will be free.
Hi, this is sean. Please leave a message.
any luck?
no, it's going straight to voicemail.
I also tried calling my mom and dad, but they're not picking up.
is it possible that he got the message and he talked to someone else?
no. Trust me.
if he calls, you'll be the first to know.
you have a nice family.
thank you.
we'll be celebrating 15 years come this january.
how long are we gonna keep this up?
if she doesn't connect with walker before daybreak, we're gonna have to pull out.
he'll call. - You sound pretty sure.
I spent time with them,
I saw how they were with each other.
all sean's thinking about is finding leila.
well, you'd better be right.
for both our sakes.
I just got the final orders.
target's been expanded.
they want us to take out the entire family.
Why? - Doesn't really matter.
we kill everyone in the house. Understood?
everyone.
Rick. It's sean.
Oh, you're finally returning my calls.
gonna have to keep this short, europe just opened.
Rick, - listen. Leila's in danger.
what do you mean, is she okay?
I hope so, i'm trying to find her.
look, I need you to run a locate on a cell phone number.
it belongs to a woman who calls herself vicky roberts. - Sean, I don't do that anymore.
not since the feds started cracking down on hacking.
and I have a family now.
Leila may be killed if I don't find her.
okay? Please.
tracking this number is my only chance.
Sean, what did you get yourself into?
it's better if you don't know.
will you do this for me, or not?
what's the number?
my friend ran vicky's number but didn't get a hit.
her phone might be off.
he'll keep trying, and then he'll call me if he finds her location.
your phone's dead.
got it covered.
Sean, it's me.
it's leila.
I'm okay, I'm safe.
I'm in this police station, in this town, snyder.
in texas. - She's here, in texas.
I got away, but...
I don't think the police believe me.
Sean, please come and get me. I love you.
she's at a police station in snyder.
I don't think that's too far from here.
snyder police department.
it's for you.
is it you?
is it really you? - Yeah. Yes, it's me.
it's me, we're coming to get you right now.
we're on our way to snyder.
we're a little over an hour away.
are you hurt? Are you okay?
no, I'm okay.
there were these people that took me off the ship. Vicky was one of them.
they were trying to force my dad to
I know, I know.
Sean, they were gonna kill me.
I didn't know what to do.
I had to shoot her to get away.
but you're okay, now.
you're safe, and I'll be there soon.
I promise. I have so much to tell you.
I believe you.
I knew you would find me.
wait, wait, wait. Hold on, I
can you hear me?
Sean, sean, you're breaking up.
Sean, I'm losing you.
I have the address, so I'm coming for you, all right?
I can't wait to see you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
can I go to the bathroom?
well, of course, it's down the hall to your left.
get off me!
go, go!
keep us safe, lord. Keep all of us safe.
don't let us die. Please.
our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
we're losing him!
calm down. Calm down.
all right, all right. Calm down.
doctor!
chasing lido.
charge to 360. - Got it.
clear.
charging again. - Clear.
okay, he's back.
get the ivs going. Ativan, 2 miligrams, i. m.
please, help me. - Chase it with haldol if you need to.
help me.
I couldn't sleep.
what's going on?
it's the passengers, they're getting worse.
they're dying.
all of them.
Oh, my god.
Why?
they're infected by something, by this man, thomas.
the one who put the cell phone in david's backpack? -yaeh
he claims to have an antidote, which he'll give us.
in return for me releasing the detainees.
well, do you think he's telling the truth, that he really has a cure?
I don't know that it matters.
you're not thinking of letting them die?
Elias, he's only asking you to do what you were going to do anyway.
you were minutes away from releasing the detainees.
but that was before I realized sophia was lying to me.
about how many of her people were here, about them being helpless.
we can't let them out, until we understand what they really want, what they're doing here.
you sound like blake sterling. - This has got nothing to do with blake.
things have changed.
Yes, but you haven't.
Elias, I know you.
if there's even a small chance - that you can save these people's lives - Christina, it's not that simple.
not when you're in my shoes.
Mr. President, we only have a minute.
I thought we should discuss our strategy.
I'm aware of that.
and what have you decided, mr. President?
Mr. President. He's called, and he's on hold.
go.
you're on with the president.
I have the counteragent prepared, and ready to be delivered to you.
as soon as you release sophia and the detainees.
don't bother.
what did you say?
don't bother, i'm not releasing any of them.
it's not going to happen.
then the passengers will die.
and what I did to them, I can do to whole towns, entire cities.
you accept the terms to my deal. - Here's the new deal.
you're going to give me that antidote, and you're going to give it to me when I tell you to, because if even one of those passengers dies,
I will execute sophia and the rest of the detainees at inostranka.
all of them.
you wouldn't.
you're wrong.
new MEXICO 1945
how long have you been living here?
six months.
I'm impressed that you were able to find me.
we were all counting on you.
how could you leave everyone behind like that?
without a clue as to where you were going, and why?
I knew you could handle it.
taking care of everyone.
that's not the point.
what have you been doing here?
I'm supposed to bring us home, -and that's what I'm doing. - Yeah? how?
you saw how behind they are.
I'm trying to boost your scientific knowledge, so we can be helped, too.
thanks to what I've already done, the u. s. Government should have the capabilities to create nuclear fission, in a matter of months.
instead of decades.
they're calling it the manhattan project.
do you know what they're going to use this for?
this country is at war, thomas.
I don't care what they're going to use it for.
it's what we're going to use it for that matters.
Mr. President. - Blake, come in.
I have somewhat promising news.
how is that, yeah.
in 1944, when the army built inostranka to house the prisoners, they included a last resort safety feature to neutralize the detainees quickly and permanently.
this termination protocol would be the best way to proceed should we not receive the antidote.
termination protocol.
the idea is to seal off the prisoners living quarters and pump carbon monoxide from the physical plant into the air ducts.
that's barbaric.
it may seem that way, now.
but, in 1944, no one could be sure how much of a threat they posed to humanity.
given the time we have,
I think this is our strongest option.
we can have it back online in under two hours.
Mr. President, are you having second thoughts about this?
because reneging on your threat at this point, would be the worst of all possible scenarios.
I understand this isn't easy.
standing up to this man, no matter what the consequences.
but, if it makes any difference,
I believe you're doing the right thing.
do it.
Yes, Mr. President.
I had to dig out the original blueprints but it's been there all these years. This thing is real.
Elias would never murder people in cold blood, he's a good man.
your words. - I know what I said.
but things have changed.
I'm telling you, martinez is ready to go through with this if thomas doesn't back down.
it will never come to that.
thomas won't let the passengers die.
Sophia, he will.
his pride is blinding him.
he's gone too far.
he's not the same man I put in charge back then.
I can't sit here and let him sacrifice the lives of all those innocent people.
I tried to tell him we couldn't allow that to happen, but he wouldn't listen to me.
but he will listen to me.
I don't care if it means
I have to spend another 66 years in this damn prison.
you tell him to release the antidote now, before any of those poor people die.
and make sure he understands it's an order.
I hope you're here to tell me you talked sense into the president.
he wouldn't have listened to me, even if I tried.
he's gonna regret pushing me.
I'll let the passengers die. - No, you're not.
I talked to sophia.
she agrees with me.
she wants you to hand over the antidote.
I don't care.
what did you say?
I'm done taking orders from sophia.
she and martinez deserve each other.
they're both weak.
it's like you once told me, she put me in charge for a reason.
I take my own orders from now on.
like hell you do.
give me the antidote.
over my dead body.
come here.
what are you gonna do to me?
don't you get it?
the president isn't going to back down.
neither am i.
then you're sentencing your own people to death.
that's it?
come on - we went to a lot of trouble, you could at least act surprised.
stay away from me.
that's what you should have told your sweetie on the phone.
instead, you're leading him right to us.
thank you.
go to hell.
Sean will be here any minute.
I'll take the roof.
call me with a heads up when you get the visual. - Will do.
please... Please don't do this.
Sean hasn't done anything.
I have orders and I have no choice but to follow them.
even if that means killing innocent people?
it's that simple for you?
5 years earlier
no one told me there'd be a baby.
I didn't see a need.
you had your orders.
take out the family, burn down the house.
and that's what you did, right?
because, if I had any doubt
that you were unable to fulfill the contract, then we would have to deal with that.
it's done.
good.
mom, you left the door open.
everything go okay? - Fine there's some spaghetti left if you want it.
I'm not that hungry.
I'm just going to go lay down, okay?
you're safe here.
I promise.
go.
I got the car. Block and a half, coming at us.
it's walker.
he's got the fbi agent with him.
what, just her?
Yeah.
I got my m-24, I could end this right now while they're still in the car.
no, our orders are to be discreet.
just wait until they get inside.
here we go.
Hey, rick.
listen, we found leila.
you did?
you're in snyder?
how did you know that?
the woman you asked me to look for, vicky roberts, she just switched her phone on, and that's where she is. Snyder, texas.
Vicky's in snyder. Are you sure?
26th street, between avenues m and n.
Vicky's inside the precinct.
how? - It's a trap.
Rick, we gotta go.
we gotta get outta here. - Leave?
we know they're monitoring law enforcement, okay?
we can't call for help. - We're not gonna just leave leila here.
okay, the second we walk in there, we'll be killed. - Okay, give me a gun.
we don't even know how many people are in there.
and we don't know how much longer they're going to keep leila alive, - we have to get her out now! - Sean, just please listen to me. It's a suicide.
okay? We have no move here.
maybe we do.
what are you doing?
I'm sending a message.
who is this?
you went to a lot of trouble to hide them.
your son. - Sean.
not letting your son keep photos of his mother, not letting him know your real name.
I gotta think that was for a reason.
I don't know what you're talking about.
of course you don't.
we're outside.
but I assume you already know that.
so, here's what's gonna happen.
I'm walking in there, and I'm walking out with leila.
or your son's picture and address go viral.
there are other people in here, you don't know what you're doing.
maybe... But you do.
so help us, and no one has to know about adam.
you know I don't want to do this, but you didn't really give me much of a choice.
so at least i'm giving you one.
did she go for it?
I don't know.
but I'm going in.
take this.
he's heading your way.
fed's staying in the car.
Walker's coming in alone.
stay down!
go, she's in the back. go!
Sean, I'm in here!
Leila, stand back, i'm gonna kick the door down.
Oh, god.
we gotta go, okay?
follow me.
drop it! now.
I will use it.
go.
now.
get in.
Walker came in with fbi agents.
I don't know how they found us.
they took the girl.
I'm not sure how they knew, somebody must have talked.
no, they got carter too, i'm the only one left.
I'll wait for orders at the rendezvous point. I gotta go.
we'll get someplace safe.
then he and I are going to have a little talk.
you came.
Mr. President, it's three minutes past the deadline, and no antidote has been forthcoming.
the termination protocol is ready.
just one more minute.
Where's the antidote?
you'll get it when you release my people.
just like I proposed.
then, there's nothing more we have to talk about.
and you will have the deaths of sophia, and the detainees on your hands.
are we done?
no, wait.
there's no point in any more talk.
unless I get the antidote, i'm hanging up.- Don't-do not hang up.
you heard what I said.
give me just one.
spell it out.
give me one of my people, and I'll get you the antidote.
who?
agreed.
Sophia, for the antidote.
but, if I release her, and the antidote doesn't work, or it doesn't get here in time, you'll leave me no choice, i'll have to execute your people.
it'll be delivered to the cdc... In time.
take sophia to the farragut north metro station, put her on the red line, scheduled to depart at 8: 16, no one on the train, or in the station.
and no stops once she boards.
just keep the train moving.
done.
I need you to put a tracking device on her, something that she can't easily get rid of.
Yeah, we have traceable material that can be added to her food and water.
do it.
she will lead us straight to thomas.
he's your new priority.
Yes, sir. Right away.
I have the president for you.
I had no choice but to release you, sophia, so don't mistake this for kindness or trust.
I won't, but I hope to regain both.
what thomas has done goes against everything that I believe in.
then prove it. Rein him in like you said you could.
keep that promise, we'll start from there.
I understand, mr. President.
 - Hi. - hi.
I spoke to rachel.
she told me you were able to get the antidote.
Yeah, the passengers are already getting better.
she told me how you got it.
Elias, if it didn't work out, would you have
would you have done it, and gone through with your threat and murdered the detainees?
the only thing that matters is that it did...
work out.
that's not an answer.
well, honey, it's the only answer I have right now.
I'm gonna go take david to school.
okay.
Sean Walker was just an ordinary man...
sir, please sit...aah!
thrown into the middle of an extraordinary conspiracy while on the run from the law.
I'm walking out with Leila.
he just rescued his kidnapped fiancee, along with one of her captors.
he and I are gonna have a little talk.
and Sophia, the leader of a mysterious group of prisoners...
I didn't condone any of this.
was keeping the peace between the White House - and her own people. - Tell me what you know.
until one of them... - His name is Thomas.
broke her free from 60-year detainment.
she will lead us straight to Thomas.
he's your new priority.
now a new pursuit begins.
rein him in, like you said you could.
and The Event continues.
Hello?
it's me.
what the hell were you thinking?
that's really the first thing you want to say to me after 66 years?
you almost killed 200 people.
nobody died, and you're free.
everything else is details. - Not to me.
and I am far from free.
we have to assume that Martinez is doing everything in his power to track me.
if only so I'll lead them to you.
you've drawn a lot of attention to yourself.
Simon's gonna give us the details to their follow operation.
we need to get you out so we can get started.
there's a change of clothes in your bag.
it's a safe bet that yours are compromised.
and then what?
then I want you to wait for me to tell you what to do.
okay, she just passed the Van Ness Station.
the next station's two miles. Metro Center.
very good, Mr. Murphy. Please confirm with Andrews - that the predators have scrambled. - Agent Lee, once the drones start transmitting video,
I want it fed to your teams on the ground.
I'll set up a dedicated overlay, sir.
where are we?
Sophia's train is proceeding east on the red line right now.
it's approaching the Metro Center Station.
are we sure she's still on the train?
we're getting a clear signal from the scandium-46 in her bloodstream.
and how long will the isotopes stay active?
seven hours.
if she hasn't led us to this man Thomas by then, we'll reacquire her.
thomas is the target of the operation, not Sophia.
I don't want her hurt.
Sophia has proven herself far from trustworthy.
in my opinion, we must consider her a threat.
she survives this, Blake. Am I clear?
pull me out if there are any major developments.
Yes, Mr. President.
sir, I'd like to join my men in the field.
supervise their deployment in person.
Thomas, it's Simon.
and we have a problem.
they've got a tracker in Sophia.
in her?
they put it in her food.
it's a radioactive isotope.
while it's active, they'll be able to track her wherever she goes.
there must be some way to get it out.
there isn't.
but there may be another way to deal with it.
good.
I'm counting on you.
how was it? - Oh, it was nice. You should come in.
it looks rough.
Hey, give me a kiss.
no, it's--it's warm. I swear.
you'll love it.
I like watching you. - Yeah?
you look happy.
like you're discovering water for the first time.
Yeah, well, where I'm from there wasn't any.
you never talk about your past.
well...
when I'm with you...
it doesn't matter.
for the first time in my life,
I'm free of it.
I love you, Mason.
I love you.
I love you too.
have Sophia get off at the Gallery Place Station and walk east.
by that time, I'll know if this will work.
change of plans.
they've deployed a radioactive isotope in your bloodstream.
how?
your friend Martinez put it in your food.
sir, she just got off at a stop.
location?
Ggallery. It's Chinatown.
get up to the street and take an immediate left.
command just reported the target exited the Gallery Place Station.
what's your position?
we're three blocks away from the station and closing. - No, hold your approach.
I don't want the team getting any closer.
ahead of you is Sixth Street.
gonna make a left, continue on.
across the street you will see the place I've been describing.
she's on to Sixth, crossing east, entering a building.
which is...
capitol GRIND
it's a coffee shop.
is it possible she's stopping for coffee?
thank you.
target's holding.
is that...is that right?
okay, we've got a second target.
what do you mean a second target?
is this right? - I think so.
okay, now we have three targets.
what the hell is happening?
I don't know, sir.
okay, now we have five targets.
they keep coming.
have Simon move his men in. - Yes, sir.
I knew you were looking for me.
that's what kept me going.
I need you to tell me what happened to my dad.
to my family.
what's your name?
what's your name?
I don't think so.
I'll just I. D. you off your fingerprints.
good luck with that.
who was it that you work for?
I need a doctor.
I think I asked you a question.
you can keep asking me questions all day.
but if I bleed to death on your watch, you're gonna have a real problem, aren't you?
you're right.
but not as big a problem as you.
I don't understand.
what do you mean the plane was pulled from the sky?
that's what it felt like, that, like, we were being moved by something.
one second, we were in Miami.
the next, we were 2, 000 miles away, crash-landing in Arizona.
that just doesn't make any sense.
you're right
I know.
well, I mean, my dad
how'd he explain it?
he didn't. He didn't explain it.
almost right when we landed, there were these-- some kind of aircraft started moving in, and he
he said they weren't there to help us and that I needed to find you.
so I--I just ran.
well--well, where is he?
Where's my dad and the rest of the passengers?
well, they're saying on the news that they lost track of the plane over in Brazil and that they're still looking for the passengers.
so all I know is that the government is not telling us the truth.
well, what about my mom?
I mean, she must be looking for him.
I tried calling the house at the police station, but no one's picking up.
Leila, I,um...
I have to
I have to tell you something.
your father told me that...
that they killed your mom.
what? - I'm so sorry.
what? - I'm so sorry.
no.
what about Samantha?
the people who are behind this, they took her just like they took you for the same reason, - No, No - to force your dad to do what he did.
no, they wouldn't they didn't hurt a little girl, right?
tell me she's okay. - As far as I know, she is alive.
we'll find her, okay?
we'll find them.
I'll explain more when I see you, all right?
Bye.
what did you do to her?
what?
where is she?
I don't know.
who? - My sister.
Where's my sister?
I don't know what you're talking about.
please. Please just tell me, okay?
just tell me where she is.
she didn't do anything.
I don't know anything about your sister.
where is my sister?
Where's my sister? - Get her off of me!
Where's my sister? - it's ok
she's only seven! Where is she?
answer her. I will let you die here.
I don't know anything.
all I know is I'm bleeding out in some fleabag motel.
you want to blame somebody, why don't you blame your father?
that's right.
Oh, you didn't know?
he's no angel.
way I heard it, he brought this on himself.
still being flooded by false targets.
43 and counting. - Now how is that possible?
best guess, one of Thomas' people got here ahead of us.
we don't have enough manpower to track everyone who's been dosed.
no, but we can minimize the confusion.
we'll lock down the coffee shop.
that's a good idea.
use Dasilva, Rutherford, Berdan, and Hayes.
what's our story?
possible Homeland Security threat in the vicinity.
no reason to panic.
that one doesn't work as well as it used to.
better be compelling then.
the rest of you, resume the search.
set a half-mile perimeter and work your way back.
Sophia's on foot.
okay, she couldn't have gotten far.
let's go.
coming up on Spring Street.
we need to keep you away from the CCTV cameras.
you can avoid most of them, but there are areas of vulnerability.
so keep your head down.
somebody give me a hard count on the isotope targets.
59 and holding, sir. Continuing to disperse.
now one of those targets is Sophia.
I want an immediate override on all CCTV and traffic cameras in the area.
once they reroute, port it directly to facial recognition.
uploading now, sir.
sir, may I have a word?
what's going on?
whoever dosed the people at the coffee shop did it with the same isotope we used on Sophia.
And?
scandium-46 is hard to source.
so I checked our own stockpile.
40 minutes ago someone walked out of our on-site armory with 100 CCs of liquid scandium.
who's authorized to access the armory?
only the men on our field teams.
I'm sorry, sir, but it has to be one of them.
but the good news is scandium is a volatile particulate.
anyone who's handled it will have trace amounts on them.
I can vet the field teams with the radiation detector.
do it.
we need to find the traitor before he undermines the entire operation.
Yes, sir.
agent Lee.
Lee, we have a situation. I'm heading your way.
a situation? What are you talking about?
just gather the members of your field team and hold them there until I arrive.
we're in the middle of an operation here.
what is this about?
I'll fill you in when I get there.
let's just say you have a problem.
I'm gonna get you in the water next time we go.
1954
I like looking at the water.
I don't like to get immersed.
so what do you say we-- we eat in tonight, huh?
I'll pick up some fish from the market.
sound good? - Yeah, sounds perfect.
all right.
Oh, hey, Mason, will you pick up some sunflowers?
sunflowers? What do you want sunflowers for?
they light up the house.
okay.
I'll light a fire. - All right.
what are you doing here?
I think you know.
please, Thomas.
I'm not ready.
it's time to go now.
I have a life here.
staying in one place any longer than you already have is not an option for any of us.
how much longer do you think it's gonna be before people start to notice you're not getting any older?
I don't know, okay?
I'll figure out a way to make it look like I am.
I'm telling you the way it's gonna be.
thom, come on.
please. - What's the problem?
I fell in love.
now who in the hell told you to do that?
I had no control over it, okay?
it just--it just happened.
and I'm not leaving her.
if you don't go, she'll have to.
it's my job to get us home.
and I can't do that without your help.
don't let your people down.
just let me say good-bye, man.
just let me say good-bye.
it's over.
I'm sorry.
are all team members present?
I got them waiting out front.
I hope there's a good reason for this.
we have a traitor.
what are you talking about?
someone took the scandium that was used to dose the coffee shop from our armory.
are you sure?
positive.
the only people with armory access are the field teams.
whoever did it should still be giving off trace levels of radiation.
well, I don't believe one of my men would do this.
but that is the case.
now we need to scan them. - Whoa, hold on.
let me do it.
my men will take it better if it's coming from me.
all right.
agent Lee.
someone needs to check you.
are you questioning my loyalty?
everyone on the team, Sterling's orders.
let's just get it out of the way.
he was just trying to mess with you.
that's what these people do.
what if what he said is true?
I mean, what if they chose my father for a reason?
look, we have to go to my parents' house and find something that connects him to all of this.
I don't think you're gonna be able to find anything there.
these people will make sure that there's nothing to find.
so then what are we supposed to do?
well, Collier's called her ex-husband.
he's gonna lock that guy down and get you someplace secure.
okay?
what are you gonna do?
there's a federal murder warrant out on me.
they think I killed Greg.
collier knows that you didn't do that.
she believes you. But it's her word against the evidence, which she says they made look airtight.
so I need to find the people behind this so I can clear my name and so I can find out about your father and Samantha?
and you, you're just gonna stay safe and get help.
you need some time to heal.
I'm not gonna heal until I know about my family.
I'm going. - Leila, listen to me.
you're the most important thing in the world to me.
I'm not gonna put you at risk.
I don't need to be protected right now, okay?
I need to do something.
I'm not gonna let you just put me in some place while you're out there looking for my family.
I'm just not gonna do that.
I'm going.
Where's the ambulance?
I'm sorry, was somebody supposed to call one?
where is it?
I heard you call one. Come on, check on it.
you're just an expert at making friends, now aren't you?
where is it?
I don't know.
maybe they put murderers at the bottom of the list.
don't look at it. - Let's go, let's go.
let's go.
where do you want to start?
there's gotta be something in his office that will help us.
come on, just look through everything.
there's gotta be something here.
all right, we'll find it. We'll find it.
Sam's baby clothes.
I was the only one who could put her to sleep.
what?
the attic.
what? - The attic.
here.
what is this stuff?
I don't know.
you shouldn't have come here.
what is it?
Hey, my cover's blown. Sterling's aide made me.
can't you take care of them?
he's out cold in the trunk of his car.
why didn't you - I wasn't going to kill him, Thomas.
and it wouldn't have mattered anyway.
dead or alive, it's over.
then it's time to move on again.
what's up, Mike?
ten YEARS EARLIER
where you headed?
I don't know, home I guess.
Oh, no, no, no. No way.
come on, we gotta celebrate, man.
we made it through training.
well, this is true.
just can't believe you actually requested to be stationed in Alaska.
what is that about?
you know me, man. I'm a snowbird. Always have been. - Mason?
Simon, you okay? - Mason?
it's me.
it's Violet.
how can it be?
you haven't aged a day.
Simon, do you know her?
I think she's... - I apologize.
she suffers from Alzheimer's.
she gets people and places mixed up.
Mason, it's me.
it's me. Ma'am.
it's me. - Ma'am, you've got the wrong guy.
no.
okay, hey. Simon, come on.
I'm sorry.
you must have me confused with someone else.
no.
don't leave.
please.
give me a picture of the center screen, please. - yes sir
when were these taken?
ten minutes ago.
redirect all teams immediately.
and pull up all the adjacent cameras. - Tell me you found her.
Mr. President, a traffic camera just spotted Sophia heading east.
it was on a time delay we don't have her yet, but we're closing in.
there you are.
target seen entering a building 0. 7 miles east of the Takoma playground.
copy that. Alpha en route.
Thomas, they've spotted Sophia.
she's gonna lead them straight to you.
how long until you get here? - No, you can't wait.
you gotta get out of there now.
don't worry, just get here.
I have a contingency plan. - What are you talking about?
what the hell are you
Thomas! Damn it!
we have a lot to talk about.
but for now,
I'm happy to see you.
I need to know how much of your father's file you've seen.
how much do you know?
we don't know anything. We just found it.
then it may not be too late.
put the file on the floor, slowly, and slide it toward me.
okay.
do not move or I will shoot you!
do you understand?
my mother is dead.
and my family is missing.
what's in this file might have something to do with it.
we're not giving it to you.
don't--don't shoot.
you can have the file, okay? - Sean.
I'm not letting you get shot.
okay? You can have it.
here you go.
drop it.
drop it!
all right, upstairs.
move!
who the hell are you?
and don't lie to me.
I don't lie.
I don't lie.
my name is Madeline Jackson.
I'm a journalist.
I used to be, till I saw the light.
that trying to speak the truth is a waste of time because nobody wants the truth.
people don't want the truth.
God forbid it would all go down in flames.
it's the lies that keep the construct going.
don't you see?
spread by the vested interests in the government, and the private sector, and the churches, and the stock exchanges, all fabricating and spinning and telling stories that keep 300 million consumers happy and stupid and spending.
why are you looking at me like I'm crazy?
just stop.
I'm not the deluded ones.
you are.
why are you here?
and what does this have to do with my father?
back to the beginning.
two years ago, your father contacted me about a flight he was piloting to Anchorage.
weather forced him to divert.
and by accident he saw that.
it's in the file.
it's an unlisted government facility near Inostranka, middle of nowhere.
he was curious, and he read an article that I put on a site that I had.
that was before they took away my site, that they hacked it out of existence because they didn't want anyone to know.
they who? The government?
the government are scared little children compared to the forces that want this kept a secret.
do you understand?
your father knew too much.
so they took him.
don't you see? - No.
no, I don't understand.
honestly, you seem out of your mind. - I am not out of my mind.
listen to me. - So why don't you just tell us what her father knew?
okay?
it's your funeral, okay?
in 1944, an aircraft crashed over the Brooks Range in Alaska.
the government imprisoned the survivors in a facility they built especially for them.
Why? What did they do?
it's not what they did. It's who they are.
who are they?
extraterrestrial biological entities.
aliens.
four minutes ago, we got visual of Sophia heading into this building.
these were taken at the same building two hours earlier.
this is the best resolution we've been able to get.
that's him right there, Thomas.
I know it.
our field units are en route.
we'll have the building surrounded within minutes.
target in sight.
E.T.A.about two minutes.
damn it.
Hey, Thomas, Sophia.
they're right behind us, every field team in the D.C. area.
don't worry.
no, you don't understand.
this place is gonna be crawling with agents.
it won't take them any time at all to find that and come after you.
I told you, don't worry.
what have you done?
we have to go now.
Thomas, call it off.
no, I can't. It's too late.
this is it, Simon.
I promise you, there's nothing I can do.
we gotta go.
Simon, you have to come with us now.
it's too late for you to go back.
you have to come with us now.
I'm sorry.
please.
Simon, come.
ten YEARS EARLIER
a sunflower.
I know how much you like them.
how they used to light up the house.
are you an angel?
no.
I am so far from that.
but...
you're here.
I'm here.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry for everything.
please forgive me.
I waited for you for so long.
did you love me?
I never stopped loving you.
if it were up to me, we would have gotten married.
we would have had children.
we would have grown old together.
it was up to you.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
please, come.
this is Agent Lee.
evacuate the building now. That's an order.
everybody out of here!
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
guys, get out of here!
get your men out of here.
hold on a second.
Hey! Anybody!
I need help!
hold on, buddy. Hold on.
anybody? Mike, help me out here, man.
come on, we've got to get him out of here.
what the hell? - Come on. I need you, let's go.
hang on, buddy.
hang on. - We got you.
let's go, let's go.
come on
we've gotta go over it. I got him.
got him? Yeah.
let's go!
go!
go, I'll be right behind you.
just go!
come on! Move, move, move!
Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
it means genocide for humans.
they're looking for some kind of weapon.
you need to get word out. We have to stop her.
Ugh! Give me the phone!
someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
that someone is you.
as long as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you.
I would expect no less.
we will find you...
and we will punish you for what you have done.
it was Martinez's actions that escalated the conflict.
you and me working together?
what exactly are you talking about?
Martinez won't listen to reason, not from you, not from anyone.
so we are left with a more permanent solution.
it will be clean... untraceable.
follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
good morning, Mr. President.
all of our documents are here.
everything is in order. You may proceed.
Halt!
everybody out.
open it.
morning, vice. - General.
good morning, Mr. President.
good morning, everyone.
uh, all right, looks like we have a full plate here.
let's get started.
coffee, sir? - Please.
we've established a task force to look into the evidence left behind by Herbert Mills, the sleeper who committed suicide.
do we know any more about what he was doing?
no, not yet.
unfortunately, all we had to go on was water from melted ice core samples left in an industrial microwave.
I'm aware of that.
do you know where the ice core samples originated yet?
analysis revealed microscopic sediments in the water found only in the Northwestern part of Siberia.
Siberia?
what relevance that may have is unclear.
unclear won't cut it, Blake.
he killed himselfso we couldn't find out what he was doing.
this is significant, which, chances are, it'll bring us back to Sophia.
were there any trace elements in these samples?
any signs of radioactivity?
no. Not that we could detect.
unfortunately, it'll be another 24 to 48 hours before any further testing results can come back.
can we cut 48 hours down to 24?
I'm sorry, sir, but that's what I'm told.
general, where's NASA stand on this?
I think they're in place.
they're the ones doing the testing, so hopefully, we'll get word.
okay, so... I can work with that.
right.
all right, let's checkwith the Russian intelligence service, see if we can get any cooperation finding out what might be of interest to Sophia in Northwestern Siberia.
I'll make a discreet inquiry.
next on the agenda-- H. R. 9036.
Richard, I thought this was a done deal.
how does a slam dunk turn so quickly into a liability the House now wants to kill?
the latest unemployment figures just came out.
trade agreement, sir-- suddenly not so popular.
there were a few defectors, but I still think we can salvage it.
I want names, specific congressmen I'll have to talk to.
I don't want to go into another vote not knowing...
let's take five...
maybe ...
Ah...
Oh! Mr. President! - Are you all right,
Mr. President?
we have the President, 46-year-old malewith no significant past medical history.
on arrival, we found him with decreased responsiveness.
he has a G. C.S. of 11.
he's 230 over 110, heart rate 70.
all right, get two large-bore I. V.s.
elevate the head of his bed.
call the scanner. Get him in stat.
I want you to give 20 of labetalol.
recycle the pressures every five minutes.
sir, what's your name?
sir, squeeze my hand.
squeeze with your other hand.
spoon the ambassador onto the speaker.
I'm sure he'll understand.
do not cancel anything that does not directly require the President's signature, smile, or person.
it's imperative that the public knows that this government can run while he's down.
how is he? - Not good.
the C. T. scan shows bleeding in his brain.
the President has suffered a stroke.
our main concern right now is controlling the intracranial pressure.
but if we can't control the bleeding by other means, we may have to go in and clip the vessel.
surgery?
the President had a physical a month ago.
he was in perfect health.
it's an improbable case, statistically and otherwise.
we're doing our best.
if you'll excuse me, I should get back to him.
of course.
Mr. President.
Yes, sir.
come close.
is Christina here?
she's on her way, five minutes out.
Oh. What do the doctors say?
they're cautiously optimistic.
I can barely see you, and I know you're lying.
whatever happens...
you can't let Jarvis ascend to the Presidency.
I know. Let's take things one step at a time.
he did this, Blake.
how?
I saw...
in the room, before I went down,
I looked in his eye.
he's behind this.
I don't know how, but that man does not take the oath.
do you understand? - I understand.
Blake... - I understand.
I understand.
how is he?
we don't know yet, but it's-- but it's bad, Christina.
how did this happen? He was fine this morning?
well, strokes like this, they're very unpredictable.
I need to see him.
is he
if anyone's gonna make it through this, it's Eli.
he's the strongest, most willful man
I have ever met in my life.
and if he wants to live...
whatever happens...
I want you to know that that man is a hero to me.
thank you, Raymond.
Gi--give me a minute.
Blake. We need to talk.
walk with me.
we need to set a meeting with Jarvis and the heads of the Executive Department.
why would we do that?
to talk about invoking Section 4.
I think that's premature.
he may not make it, Blake.
well, I just left his side, and he's still conscious.
for how long?
there's a strict protocol here.
the 25th Amendment clearly states that in the event that the President becomes incapacitated, the cabinet must appoint the V. P. to acting President
I've read the damn constitution.
look, we cannot let the Vice President take office.
it's not up to us.
the country needs continuity of leadership.
Jarvis may be responsible for what's happened to the President.
excuse me?
that's what Martinez just told me.
I'm inclined to believe him.
but he had a stroke. We were both there.
he thinks Jarvis did something to cause it.
he's experiencing brain trauma.
clearly, he's not thinking.
you don't know all the facts...
there are things the President and I know about Jarvis, about what he's capable of.
what things?
if you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know.
this isn't the first timeJarvis has attempted to eliminate the President.
obviously, we covered it up, but I know you were made aware of the attempt on the President's life at Coral Gables.
the perpetrators had help from the inside.
you think Jarvis was involved? - Oh, I know he was.
he confessed.
you have to help me stop this succession before we end up putting a murderer in the White House.
to take him down, you would need irrefutable proof that he's responsible for the President's condition.
I can get it.
I just need time.
for those of you just tuning in, we are outside Bethesda Hospital, where President Martinez was rushed earlier this morning, uh, for undisclosed reasons.
we have learned from anonymous sourceswithin the White House...
seems there's reason to celebrate.
everything's going according to your plan.
don't.
there's no need to be callous.
I take no joy in seeing this man fall, nor should you.
aaron reported back from Murmansk.
they've recovered the weapon.
and are we prepared on this end?
we're close.
we'll be ready in time.
good. Thank you for letting me know.
why isn't Michael helping you with this?
I tried calling him. He hasn't called me back.
must have gotten held up.
Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
once Jarvis is in power, he'll help me.
he just doesn't know it yet.
Sean, they want to take over.
my father's people.
they're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
I also have a woman's name-- Irina Bogdanov.
she may be involved. I don't know anything else.
I just
give me this.
where did you get this? Leila, talk to me!
I know what Sophia's trying to do!
who did you call? What did you tell them?
how could you be a part of this?
I'm part of this because I'm trying to save our people.
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want your protection.
who did you call?
what did you tell him?
Leila, this is very important.
how much did you tell him?
I told him everything what you're looking for in Siberia, what Sophia is trying to do and take over
she took my phone, Michael! - No, Luis, it's all right.
she made a call to the outside.
no, no, she was just calling her boyfriend.
she called 911, and when I found out, - she attacked me! - No, no, it's okay.
Michael, this is a serious breach.
she could have told them who we are, where we are.
we need to take her to Sophia now.
that's not necessary. - Michael...
the government learns of our location, we are as good as dead-- you know that!
Sophia needs to know what happened.
you know that.
I know.
I'm sorry, Michael. I really am.
but the truth is you should have never brought her here.
well, there's nothing we can do about it now.
what's done is done. Grab his legs.
north Eastern France
I know we can't trust what Dempsey told us, but I do trust Leila, and she confirmed his story.
if there's even a chance of us stopping Sophia and her people from getting this weapon
Leila didn't give you anything actionable.
what, the name of some woman? - Irina Bogdanov.
she also told me the weapon was somewhere near Murmansk.
do you have any idea how cold it is in western Siberia this time of year?
ten-- think ten degrees.
I'm not freezing my ass offjust 'cause some delusional old man thinks the world's coming to an end.
when we came to France, we had even less to go on, didn't we?
and look what we were able to accomplish.
all right.
all right what?
Nonterrestrials, weapons of mass destruction
count me in.
I'll help you.
you will?
Yes.
Why?
don't try to analyze me, Sean.
just take "yes" as an answer.
Oh, finally!
what, you found her? - Oh, not exactly.
I've been searching passport databasesand passenger manifests.
problem is...
Irina Bogdanov isn't the name of a woman.
europol customs port of call declaration.
it's the name of a ship.
currently docked at the port of Murmansk.
the subject is surprisingly intact...
even after nearly 93 years...
due, most likely, to the, uh, preservation in the permafrost.
ready now to expose...
the organs.
the men are worried.
the job has risks that were not fully disclosed.
as long as they stay out of the clean room, your men are perfectly safe.
money would be more convincing than words.
you don't like the job, then quit.
you're not getting more money.
now, go get me another pack of smokes.
I'm out.
the lungs are magnificent.
I think we'll havevery good results.
his epithelium are enlarged, and the primary bronchi appear to be filled with mucus or...
or some kind of liquid.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
I need to get out!
I've cut my suit.
I need you to let me out.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
please.
please.
it's gonna be all right.
I know what I'm doing.
please!
open the door!
please!
open the door.
he started exhibiting intracranial hypertension, and the pressure increased to the pointthat he lost consciousness.
once the swelling goes down, will he wake up?
it's possible.
but if cerebral profusion
uh, his circulation is compromised there is still the risk of ischemia.
another stroke. - Yes, ma'am.
we should know fairly soonif he's responding to the treatment.
I know how difficult this is.
but you should prepare yourself, Mrs. Martinez.
if we don't seea marked improvement in his I. C.P.
,we will need to discuss his wishes for
please.
Elias...I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm right here.
I know you're suffering.
I know how powerless you must feel right now.
please fight.
I love you. I love you so much.
I checked Jarvis' movements this morning.
everywhere he went inside the White Housebefore and after the President's collapse.
were you able to find anything suspicious?
Yeah, maybe.
he arrived at the morning briefingin the situation room early.
he was there already when the rest of us came in.
Yeah. I pulled up the surveillance footagefrom before we got there.
there.
he goes to the coffee cart.
Hey, what's he doing?
it's got to be the coffee.
he must have spiked it in some way.
with some kind of poison, something that would give the President a stroke?
Jarvis knows our morning routine.
he could easily have spiked the President's cup.
maybe.
but you'll need more than picturesof the Vice President's back to convince anyone of it.
I thought I asked not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, but it's not for you, Director Sterling.
Mr. Peel--the Vice President is looking for himand says it's urgent.
my apologies for the interruption.
it's not a problem, Mr. Vice President.
how can I help you?
of all my duties as Vice President, this is the most unenviable one.
but as much as it pains me to do so, I am bound.
I have notified the President Pro Tem of the Senateand the Speaker of the Housethat this communication is coming.
it's a written declaration...
asking the President's Cabinet to enactSection 4 of the 25th Amendment the succession protocol.
I truly wish it wasn't necessary, but it is my responsibility to assure that the continuityof our great democracy be maintained.
our great democracy.
indeed.
Mr. Peel, would you please gather the Cabinetfor the signing of the declaration...As soon as possible?
the Secretary of Stateis on her way back from the Middle East.
she cut her trip short.
she'll be landing in a couple of hours.
well, we'll convene as soon as she gets here.
I just want you both to know that I don't, uh...
I don't feel I'll be able to fillElias' shoes.
I only wish I can tread capably in the pathhe's already set for us.
the Secretary of State-- she's already landed.
I briefed her myself on the President's condition.
I know.
I just bought us a couple of hours.
but that's it.
we either find something on Jarvis now, or that man is gonna be the next President of the United States.
well, I appreciate your call, but I'll have to call you back.
Mr. Vice President, I have Prime Minister Wilheim on the phone, and the Russian premier just called before that.
tell everyone I'm busy.
I don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister.
the Vice President...
what do you want? - Mr. Vice President...
I've been watching the news all morning.
why hasn't Presidential authoritybeen turned over to you yet?
because the President isn't dead.
I had to petition the Cabinetto appoint me acting President.
then I had to wait for them to ratify me, none of which would have been necessaryhad the powder you given me worked.
just be calm.
the poison's working exactly as it's designed to--taking its toll on the President slowly.
I just want this over.
just be patient.
in the next few hours, President Martinez will lapse into a coma.
shortly after that, he will die.
and you'll be the next President of your country.
did you see that?
what?
watch the Vice President.
look what he does with his hand.
he took the President's sweetener packet off the table.
the packet must have contained the poison, so he removed the evidence.
we'll need more than surveillance footageto convince the rest of the President's Cabinetof any wrongdoing.
we need undeniable proof.
when the President dies, they will do an autopsy.
are you sure they won't be able to detectwhat really happened?
we're sure.
the poison is designed to metabolize quicklyin the system.
once it does so, there'll be no trace of it left behind.
well, you better be right, because I'm the one on the line here, not you.
as long as the sweetener packet was removed, there'll be no proof.
we may have a problem.
Why? What is it?
when the President collapsed, his coffee spilled.
the coffee's laced with poison.
what are you doing?
what do you mean?
we were told to clean the room.
by who?
I was just following orders.
is there some kind of problem?
clean up the blood.
make sure there's nothing outside the house.
we have to run!
we have to get out of here!
we're not going anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
thank you...For being on my side.
I'm not.
Leila, you are not one of them.
we're your people now, not Sean, not anyone else.
I know you can't fully accept that right now, but you have to try, because any more calls to the outside, any more attempts on your part to escapewill get us both killed.
now clean up the blood.
we're wasting time.
Michael...It's Sophia.
is that you?
is your father here?
Um...Yeah.
but, uh...I think he's sleeping.
wake him up for me.
he said he doesn't want to be disturbed.
wake him up, or I will.
why, is something wrong?
I...Sophia
Dad...I didn't hear you come down.
couldn't sleep.
is everything okay?
can we talk outside? - Sure.
thank you, Leila. -Yeah.
have you seen Luis?
no, not since last night.
he's not answering his phone.
can you track him down for me?
of course. Yeah.
good.
my Russian isn't quite what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure that's our ship.
security's heavy.
the other piers didn't have any.
eight guards total, AK-47s...quarter-mile stretch.
completely surrounded.
on land.
as far as I can see, they don't have anybody in the water.
we can do it.
we just have to wait for them to get out of our eyeline.
what?
everything you've done up till nowhas been for money or family.
why are you here?
why are you helping me?
let me ask you a question, Sean.
why do you think I'm here?
honestly, I have no idea.
I-I don't understand you at all.
that's right. You don't.
let's move.
excuse me. We need your boat.
where the hell is the crew?
you ready?
Vicky, don't, don't, don't!
I think there's something inside.
what?
what the hell happened to them?
only one way to find out.
I can't tell how old the uniform is, but he was a soldier.
they cracked his chest open.
Why?
to get to his lungs.
they're missing.
we're not alone.
don't move!
tell us what happening?
I don't understand!
get him up.
start talking! - I wasn't here!
do you know what they were doing?
we were just hired for the job few days, and that's it.
I don't know anything!
he's lying. - Of course he's lying.
no, I'm not lying! - Put him inside.
get the door.
No! No! No! No!
no, they said it was the flu--Spanish flu.
what the hell are you talking about?
spanish flu killed 50 million people during World War I.
that's where the uniform is from.
Yes. - The body?
the soldier was very deep in the ice, and the virus was alive in him.
that's all I know.
that's the weapon.
the lungs are missing!
where are they?
huh? - I don't know.
he's wasting our time. - I don't know.
they must be on the way to the airportwith a courier.
what's the courier's name?
tell me!
all I know...On the phone, American called him Alexwhen he was giving him flight information.
which is what?
what's the flight information?
flight 38, Air Moscow.
to where? - I don't know.
what was the courier's destination?
I don't know what city!
but he's bringing infected tissue to your country.
is everyone here? - Almost, sir.
shouldn't be long.
very good.
where have you been?
I pulled a sample of the carpetfrom the situation room, had it sent to the FBI lab.
And?
it's useless.
the fibers were too contaminated with the cleaning solution.
I'm sorry, Blake, but I have to begin the proceedings.
they need to know who they're putting into office.
I want to present the evidence to them.
what evidence?
the obscured security footage?
the statements the President madewhile suffering the effects of a stroke?
if nothing else, it could hold this off long enoughfor him to recover.
if you go in therewith anything less than a smoking gun, you'll look like a lunatic.
Jarvis will sideline you, and he will keep you from ever proving it.
I can't just forget about this.
I'm not asking you to.
but for now, you're gonna have to play along.
if you can't do that, then don't go in that room.
I have been informed that the President's conditioncontinues to deteriorate.
given that he is incapacitatedand unable to discharge the duties of the office, we must proceed.
if there are no objections, I'll commence the vote.
secretary of Defense, Watkins. - Aye.
secretary of the Treasury, Sassen. - Aye.
secretary of the Interior, Wilson. - Aye.
secretary of State, Carrol. - Aye.
director of National Intelligence, Sterling.
director Sterling.
Aye.
help!
somebody, please help him!
Oh, no!
the way I heard it, he brought this on himself.
target's been expanded. They want us to take out the entire family.
no one told me there'd be a baby.
you had your orders. And that's what you did, right?
you're safe here. I promise.
we need to go. There's someone here.
hold on to your hats.
this is your life now.
the president and I have our differences, but the idea of me having anything to do with trying to kill him is absurd.
today, a new development in the story of avias flight 514.
as we reported earlier, brazilian separatists aboard the plane released a biological agent, prompting an emergency landing.
the 183 passengers were then moved to a stateside quarantine facility for examination.
and now, after much fear and uncertainty, those passengers are going home.
but one of them won't be so fortunate.
the pilot who navigated the plane to safety, died in quarantine from injuries he suffered in the crash.
today he is remembered as a hero.
the domestic intelligence apparatus of this country has one priority
that is to find sophia and the man we know as Thomas.
and no less important are the rest of them who have been living secretly among us.
"the sleepers," as you call them.
what I want to know is, why has that not been accomplished?
we don't even know how many sleepers are out there or how deeply they've infiltrated our country or what kind of threat they represent-nothing.
Mr. President, please bear in mind the search operation has really just begun.
we weren't aware thomas and the sleepers existed until several days ago.
to me, that just means we dropped the ball.
it's very difficult, Mr. Vice President, to find something you don't know you're looking for.
until then, there's still the assassination attempt against you at Coral Gables, where we do have a promising lead.
what's your lead?
the pilot, Michael Buchanan.
but you interviewed the pilot.
he didn't tell you anything, other than the fact that he was forced into what he did by the murder of his wife and the abduction of his daughters.
that doesn't mean that's all he knows.
Buchanan and the passengers became ill before I could interrogate him further.
I intend to remedy that now.
all right, Blake, let's pursue it.
but I want to talk to him first.
he intended to murder me and my family and 200 innocent people on that plane, and he's going to tell me who put him up to it.
all right?
you don't know how sorry I am, sir.
but you have to believe me, I didn't have a choice.
Oh, everyone has a choice.
they were gonna kill my girls.
so instead, you think it's okay to kill 200 people on that plane and me...
and my family?
you made a choice. You decided that was okay.
after what they did to me...
please understand, I wasn't in my right mind.
I don't know what else to tell you.
what you can tell me...
is how I catch the people who did this to you.
I told your people everything I know.
think. They took you from your house.
you had to have seen something.
they put something over my head.
heard something, then, anything.
Hey, listen to me.
I'm a father.
I get it. I know how concerned you are about your daughters.
and I give you my word
I will do everything in my power to find them, but you have to give me something.
they, uh...
what?
they almost didn't go through with it.
what do you mean? Why not? - I don't know.
but before they put me on the plane, they were thinking of calling the whole thing off. And then a...
a call came in giving them the go-ahead, so...
so you said this happened before the plane took off.
yeah? - Yeah.
okay, I-I need you to remember this.
do you remember what time that call came in - The go-ahead call?
1:08 p.m.
I remember, 'cause I looked at my watch to see how much time I had before departure.
but I didn't hear the conversation.
I don't know how that could be of any help to you.
I'm afraid I do know.
Hi, Eva.
the president interviewed the pilot from avias 514 this morning - Uh, Michael Buchanan.
can you pull up the transcript for me, please?
I'm sorry, sir. I can't gain access to it.
what do you mean?
it shouldn't be a clearance problem.
it's been restricted to the executive office of the president.
Oh, well... Very well, then.
I'll be in my office.
who wants cake?
I'll pass on the cake.
okay, no cake for the vice president.
but everyone else wants some, right?
kids: yeah!
what it comes down to is...
we don't have enough information to feel safe enough to let them out.
guys, it's too late.
the information's already out there.
all right, then, fine. Let the public find out.
just please, Eli...
don't let them out.
I'm sorry if this makes you all feel uncomfortable, but these people have suffered enough.
we're closing the facility.
in two hours...
I'm going out there, and I'm going to tell the American people the truth.
this ends today.
I need a moment in private, Mark.
where do we stand?
I just left the president.
he won't budge.
he's going through with the announcement.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I didn't want it to come to this.
neither did i.
but the president has left us no choice.
we have to stop him from releasing the detainees.
I keep thinking about those people on the plane.
some of them were children.
Raymond, we're doing this to prevent something worse
Martinez releasing a dangerous, unknown enemy into our midst.
I know.
you've been a great public servant for our country, ray.
but sometimes we don't choose the moment.
it chooses us.
the plane will be in the air soon.
you need to leave the compound.
you okay?
come on. - Where are we going?
hurry, hurry. - Where are we going?
okay, okay, we're onto something, or they wouldn't be chasing us, okay?
so we're getting closer. We're gonna figure this out.
so what, we're just gonna be like them and keep looking over our shoulders everywhere we go?
no, no, no, no. No, listen, listen...
I'm gonna make sure that I do everything
I possibly can to untangle this mess so that we can get back to living our lives.
we're gonna get older...
look, look, look, stop, stop, stop.
look at me. Look at me.
it's okay. Hey, hey, look at me.
we're gonna be all right. We're gonna be okay, okay?
I love you so much, and I'm gonna do everything.
I love you.
I love you.
these companies are in-in Los Angeles, and they're our only lead to finding your family.
so that's where we need to get. We need to get to california.
how are we gonna get there?
he have no money. We have no I.D.
and these people- They have more power - than we can even understand. - It's okay. It's okay.
we'll figure it out, okay?
God! - We're gonna figure it out.
we're gonna figure it out, Leila, it'll be fine.
you got to trust me. - Oh, god!
Sean. Sean, get up. Get up. Come on.
over here, over here.
okay, get the rock.
throw it when I say, okay?
now.
Sean, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
just get his gun. Get his gun.
okay, go, go.
we have to get out of here.
break it. Break it. Break the window.
we've got to get out of here before they block off the road.
okay, tell me what to do.
here, take this, and put it in the ignition.
you got to get it all the way in there and then twist like a key.
come on, hurry. They're coming.
I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.
put this on it. Put pressure on it. All right?
you're gonna be okay. We're gonna get you to a hospital.
no, no, no, no. We can't go to a hospital.
they have to report all gunshot wounds to police.
and when they do that, they'll realize that there's a warrant out for me-i'm wanted for murder.
Sean, no.
we don't have a choice, okay?
you're hurt, and you need a doctor.
please, w-we can't take that chance. Just get us out of town, and then we can stop.
Sean, I'm taking you to a hospital.
I am not losing you.
I'm not losing you.
okay, you're gonna stay here, and I'm gonna be back.
please, it's not safe for us to be here.
Sean, you're still bleeding, and you need a doctor.
they'll arrest us.
no, they won't. Trust me.
Hey! Hey, are you a doctor?
Yeah, but my shift's over, so you want to check with the on-call nurse
please, it's important. My boyfriend, he's been shot.
please, he's in the car over here.
where? Where? Okay, okay.
Hey, I'm gonna take a look at you, okay?
all right, I need help getting him inside.
we can't go inside. - What the hell are you doing?
you're gonna come with us, and you're gonna help him.
l- listen to me...
look, I don't want to shoot you, but I will.
so right now I need you to get in the front seat, and you're gonna drive the car.
come on, go. Go.
come in. - Mr. President.
I was told you were at the hospital checking on Agent Lee. - I was.
and how's he doing? - Much better.
he's out of the I.C.U.
he should be discharged in a day or two.
please.
you're a good friend, Blake.
I'm not his friend. I'm his boss.
he was hurt in the line of duty, so...
not to Agent Lee, to me.
remember that meeting we had just before I was about to give the press conference at Coral Gables?
of course.
I was the one who requested it.
I now know that someone in that room, or someone closely connected to them, gave the go-ahead and green light to send the pilot.
what?
michael buchanan told me he got the go-ahead to fly into the compound four minutes after the meeting dispersed.
but I know it wasn't you, Blake.
how can you be so sure?
well, I know the personal toll disloyalty has taken on you.
I don't think you're capable of that.
it's not who you are.
but I also had the NSA monitor every phone call and every communication coming into and out of the Coral Gables compound on the day of the assassination attempt.
you're clear.
so the key to finding who we're looking for...
is somewhere in these records.
all right, Eli...
we'll find him.
it's me.
Raymond, what can I do for you?
the president
he's just had a meeting with the pilot.
And?
and since he's returned, President Martinez and Director Sterling have been behind closed doors.
what exactly is the problem?
I can't find out what the president heard from the pilot.
the transcripts-I've tried to access them, but they've been redacted.
I've been cut out of the loop.
well, I understand your concern.
well, you tell me I shouldn't be.
your people handle that side of things.
does the pilot know anything that could lead back to me?
not that I'm aware of.
not that you're aware of?
if I'm exposed...
I'm not gonna go down alone.
nobody is being exposed.
my misguided sense of patriotism led me astray to participating in this with you and almost making the biggest mistake of my life.
but you know what?
the president and the passengers, they survived.
I've been absolved, and I'm not about to go down now.
I know this has been hard.
but I assure you nothing bad is going to happen now.
how? How-how can you assure me of that?
this is not a secure means of communication.
let's continue this conversation in person.
as soon as possible.
very well. I can meet in half an hour.
let's, uh...
let's use our usual cover.
schedule an appointment with Dr. Lessner.
I can't do it that soon.
well, you're the one who feels this is urgent.
the appropriations committee is coming in for a meeting.
I have to meet with them.
if I'm not there, it'll look suspicious.
whatever works for you, Raymond.
the choice is yours.
our country is in desperate need of strong leadership...
that can look past party lines and respects what the American flag stands for.
we will restore America's pride...
here at home and around the world.
we will make you believe again!
and that's a promise!
thank you!
and god bless America!
great speech, sir. - Thank you.
one of our major contributors is here.
I was wondering if he could speak to you for a few minutes.
Absolutely. - This way.
well done, senator. - Thank you.
right this way.
Ah, thank you.
Mr. Dempsey...
Oh, senator, senator...
Oh, please-please don't get up.
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much for making the time to see me.
well, not at all. I never thought i'd get a chance to thank you in person for supporting my campaigns.
well, I prefer to stay out of the spotlight.
that was a very energizing speech, yes, very, very inspiring.
thank you.
such a shame that you couldn't clinch the nomination.
there'll be other opportunities.
right now it's all about mobilizing our base.
it's all about the big picture.
I couldn't agree more.
unfortunately, your party's gonna lose the White House to Senator Martinez.
well, we don't know that. - But I do.
it's a done deal.
what's not a done deal, however...
is his running mate.
Martinez is looking to create the first bipartisan ticket in modern history.
Yes, I've heard the rumors.
if there is someone who can reach across the aisle, bridge the gap between Martinez's party and ours, it's you, Raymond.
you're the perfect candidate.
well, speaking hypothetically, why would you do this for me, Mr. Dempsey?
it's not for you. It's for this country.
I know you feel the same way about this country as I do.
is idealistic to a fault.
all I would ask of you is to provide...
balance.
well, I have confirmation on General Whitman.
the only call he made after the meeting was to his wife.
they spoke for 20 minutes, well past 1:08 p.m.
he's clean.
it's Jarvis.
we've cleared all the people who knew what happened in that meeting except him
my associates, Jarvis' aide, Whitman's aide...
now Whitman.
Jarvis' records show that he used his personal cell phone to make a call at 1:05 p.m.
and the call was scrambled. - Can we decode it?
no. It looks like he was using a proprietary algorithm several grades above military-grade encryption.
this is not government-issue technology.
his call lasted two minutes.
it ends at 1:07 p.m.
a minute later, the pilot gets the green light.
after all we went through together during the campaign...
the man is like family to me.
believe me, I know this is difficult.
sir, the vice president made that call, but I find it hard to believe he formulated the plan.
Jarvis is an insider, but he's not a leader and not someone with the resources to do something like this on his own.
someone else has to be pulling the strings.
I want Jarvis arrested.
we have no grounds, Mr. President.
well, figure out how to unscramble the call.
uh, maybe, but even if we did, we covered up the assassination attempt.
you can't prosecute someone for something that never happened.
no, right now the best thing is to be patient.
I can put together a small investigative unit, set up wiretaps, around-the-clock surveillance.
no.
hell, no.
sir...
wait... Sir...
think this through. You can't just go and confront him.
I'm not just gonna sit on my damn hands and wait till he slips up one day.
that man ordered my death and the death of my family.
he's gonna answer for that. He's gonna answer to me.
get him out here now.
I'm sorry?
Mr. President?
Eva, where is he?
I-I'm not sure. H-he left just a few minutes ago.
he had me cancel his appropriations committee meeting.
he said he needed to go see his doctor.
which doctor? What's the address?
I'm sorry. I don't
he made the appointment himself.
I don't have that information.
find him.
look, he needs a hospital.
let me turn around.
I already told you that that's not an option.
without an O.R. he is gonna bleed out.
Yeah, and you're gonna help him, all right? You took an oath.
look, I need supplies, medications, I.V. Fluids.
we're gonna go somewhere where you can get whatever you need to fix him, and then we're gonna go back to your house, and you're gonna work on him there.
what?
you heard me. Drive.
look, I-I don't even know if a pharmacy is gonna have what we need.
let's go, okay? Get out.
you're just gonna leave him in here?
I can't let you go in there by yourself.
no, s-stay here, okay? You talk to him.
elevate his arm.
you can trust me. I promise.
I can't trust anyone.
move.
excuse me.
there's the pharmacy.
look, whatever your boyfriend did, it's not worth risking his life over, okay?
he didn't do anything. - Great.
so-so it's a misunderstanding. You have nothing to worry about.
we-we should go back to the hospital.
we should just explain everything to the police.
you think we didn't try that?
nobody believes us.
you wouldn't understand.
it's gonna look suspicious if you're just standing there.
you know, just go.
can I help you?
Yeah, hi, uh, Bernard.
uh, I'm Dr. Matt Kemp.
I need a gram of ceftriaxone, uh, two liters of saline, and some tubing.
let me make sure we have the ceftriaxone.
we do.
also, uh, do you maybe have an intraosseous line?
we should. We usually keep a small supply in our home health inventory.
great. Great. Also gonna need, um, a 10 blade, some sterile seven gloves, betadine, 5- oh vicryl suture...
an 18-gauge syringe...
and five packs of sterile four-by-fours.
is that it?
sounds like you're setting up a whole O.R.
it does, doesn't it?
what's your license number? - License number, right.
okay, looks like we have everything.
give me a minute to put it all together.
thank you.
don't do anything stupid.
tell him to hurry.
uh, hey, Bernard, can you hurry it up?
I- I really need to get back to my patient.
going as fast as I can.
okay, $167. 68.
we really have to go.
keep the change. - Thanks.
watch it.
thank you, Audra.
I picked her up outside of Houston.
I had to take care of a few things.
my mother needed help with something.
I was gonna report in in the morning.
family's important.
ms. Roberts, come, sit.
I like you.
I always have.
coffee?
no, thank you. I'm good.
herbal sweetener.
trying to cut sugar out of my diet.
I'm interested in what happened in Texas with the pilot's daughter and her boyfriend.
that was unfortunate.
I barely made it out of there alive.
your associate carter said as much.
however, he, uh...
wasn't sure how they...
pulled off their escape.
he seemed to feel they may have had inside help.
no. We were just caught off guard.
Walker and the bureau woman arrived ahead of schedule, and they came in firing
but you managed to get away.
as did Carter.
I see.
well, I assume you're ready to resume your work, help me solve a problem.
who's the target?
the vice president?
Yeah.
will that be a problem, Ms.Roberts?
only for him.
sir, the building's been swept.
your doctor's office is clear for your arrival.
this is as far as you go, gentlemen.
of course, sir. - Thank you.
Mr. President, Director Sterling.
we need your highest discretion in a matter pertaining to the vice president.
I want him brought back here immediately.
patch in, talk to his detail.
he's needed with the utmost urgency.
I need a location on the V.P.
he's in with his physician, sir.
I don't care. Get him out of there.
copy that.
we need to come in, sir.
vice President Jarvis, is everything all right?
sir?
he's gone!
sir, the vice president...
he's not in the doctor's exam room.
what are you saying? - He's gone.
how in the hell is that possible?
there was another door leading out of the room.
Mr. President - Establish a perimeter.
activate every available field agent and expand that perimeter.
comb every inch.
do not come back without him.
what are you doing here?
we were sent here to kill you.
please...
what do you want?
I want out.
I don't understand. How am I supposed to help you?
your life for Dempsey's.
you need to come clean now, tell 'em how he was behind trying to kill the president.
listen, I don't know how he wronged you
Dempsey played us both.
he sold you on patriotism, but that's now what this is really about.
I wonder what he's really after.
what are you saying?
bury him.
that's the only way either one of us is getting out of here alive.
Sean, oh, god
we have to find him.
he's not here. Maybe- Maybe the police took him.
maybe-maybe he's inside or something.
come on. Just keep looking, okay?
he's here. We're gonna find him.
there. There.
there.
pulse is thready.
baby, wake up. - Hematoma's expanding.
we need to do this now. He is bleeding out.
Sean, wake up. - I need you to cut through his pants, up to his knee, okay?
let's go.
let me know when you're done.
we need to screw this into his tibial bone.
you're gonna apply steady pressure right here.
okay? Look at me. Until you feel a pop.
what? - Come on.
we'll run the saline right into his marrow.
it's the quickest way to restore his blood volume.
let's go! Hurry up! Come on!
okay, I-I felt it. - Okay, good.
hook this up...
and then hang the bag really high, okay?
I'm gonna open up the wound and try to find the bleeder, tie it off.
I got it. - Good.
there's too much blood.
I can't find the artery.
open these up.
help me pack off the area with gauze, okay?
we need to dry it up. - Come on. Come on.
tear it open-focus- Tear it open and dab it in there, all right?
don't do this to me.
come on, get in there. Just dab up the blood, come on.
all right, good, good, good, good, good. Okay.
come on. Come on, baby.
okay, okay, I got it.
okay, listen, I need you to put your finger right there, okay?
come on, let's go!
we've got it. Good. Don't move.
Sean, I'm here. I'm here, baby.
all right, listen to me. Whatever you do, do not move, okay?
all right.
looks like a branch of the brachial.
I'm here.
he's gonna have collateral flow to the rest of his arm.
you're gonna be okay.
all right, you can move your finger now.
he's gonna make it.
what happened? - Must have blown a clot...
arterial bleed.
here, run another bag while I sew him up.
you're okay. You're okay.
any fever, any dizziness?
do not mess around, okay?
get him to an E.R., all right?
or abduct another doctor. I don't care.
you saved my life.
all right, just keep breathing and stay with us, all right?
Ok-okay.
okay. - You'll be okay.
thank you.
agent Romo, I need to get back to the White House.
Mr. Vice President, we've been trying to locate you for almost an hour.
I'm under a stairwell in back of the building.
come and meet me. - Let's go!
sir, I have the vice president on the line.
trace the call and patch him through.
Mr. President.
ray, where the hell have you been?
I'm on my way back to the White House.
good, because you and I need to have a conversation.
I know. I'm coming to turn myself in.
I don't know how much you've uncovered, but I've been involved in some very terrible things, things that I could never take back.
Mr. Sterling, I have a visual on the vice president.
they got him. - So it's true?
the attack in Coral Gables on me
it was you?
I want- I want you to know that everything I did I was led to believe was for the good of the country.
except you almost killed hundreds of innocents.
you almost killed my family, Ray.
my family!
Eli, I was manipulated by a very powerful man who won't stop until he gets what he wants.
who, Ray? - I want a status on this van.
sir... Are you all right? Are you all right? Let's go.
who is it, Ray?
Eli, it was
ray, what happened?
what happened? - We lost him.
what do you mean "we lost him"?
sir, it's done.
but I had to go ahead with our backup plan.
so Ms.Roberts didn't come through?
no, sir. Looks like she killed Lonner and bolted.
what a shame.
thank you.
we're safe.
these are Thomas's people.
you okay?
your house is back there, Leila.
are you telling me that I can't leave?
we will bring all our people here and make this planet our own.
if you aren't with us, then you're against us.
I'll never go along with genocide.
I'm sorry, Simon.
I've asked everyone with White House clearance to sign a testing agreement.
you should know that there was one holdout.
who? - Your wife.
how do you expect me to find Dempsey when he's in France?
you just get us there, and I'll worry about the rest.
my contact tells me he's taken a place at the Chateau de Perrault here in the town of Morez.
run, Sean! Run!
nice to see you again, miss Roberts.
why do you care so much about Walker?
because every time I put an obstacle in his path, he's found some way to surmount it.
kill her.
what have you got, agent?
no signs of security in the front of back entrance of the building other than CCTV cameras.
listen up.
local law enforcement has locked down the perimeter. We're good to go.
remember, we take him alive.
yes?
it's Herbert.
they're coming. They have me surrounded.
stay calm.
first, send us everything you have right now.
listen to me, this is important.
they can't know what you've been working on.
do you understand?
Sophia, no.
not a trace.
but, Sophia, I've worked so hard.
please, I'm so close.
I'm sorry, Herbert.
you know what you have to do.
herbert Mills, you're under arrest!
put your hands behind your head! Get down on the ground!
get down on the ground now!
on the ground!
there isn't room on this planet to accommodate our entire population of 2. 5 billion.
and their safety is my only priority.
so we will have to... Effect changes here.
the native population will be winnowed substantially.
we're working on a weapon to make that happen quickly and efficiently.
herbert Mills was close to finding that weapon, but the government found him last night.
and he killed himself to avoid capture, but before doing so he uploaded the research that he'd found.
aaron, you'll be in charge of analyzing the data he sent.
the sooner we find the weapon and use it, the sooner our people will be safe.
I'll get right on it.
good.
if they can find mills, they can find any of us.
if that happens, this whole thing comes crashing down, along with the future of our people.
you're right.
I've been thinking a lot about that.
we can't move forward if we have to keep looking over our shoulders like this.
we need to disrupt the government, throw it into disarray so they stop hunting us at least until we find the weapon.
how?
cut off the head.
we will take out President Martinez.
permanently.
there were no survivors from our attack on the two busloads of sleepers, but analysis of clues found on their bodies led us to this man, Herbert mills.
a ground operation was launched to apprehend him.
unfortunately our agents did not anticipate how far he would go to avoid capture.
this man was in a lab. What was he doing there?
we're not sure.
before he jumped, he engaged a comprehensive protocol that destroyed most of the evidence there.
all we could determine was that he was studying ice core samples.
ice core samples?
do we have any idea why or where they were from?
no on both accounts I'm afraid.
I think it's safe to assume it has something to do with their overall goal to bring more of their own people here.
we can't assume anything.
the game has changed, gentlemen.
with their attack on the Washington monument and our counter-strike, we are now at war with the non-terrestrials, which means it's possible Sophia will go on the offensive.
and if she does, we need to know what she's going to do and be ready for it.
this is a war we must win.
maybe it's a war we shouldn't fight alone.
maybe we should come clean about the aliens' existence to other world leaders and ask for some help.
when I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
Mr. President, I'm only trying to... - am I understood?
Yes, Mr. President.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Senator Lewis has asked to see you.
she says it's urgent.
we're done here.
thank you, gentlemen.
thank you, Mr. President.
the Lower 9th. after hurricane Katrina.
we went down to rebuild.
14 homes in 30 days.
I have five minutes, Senator.
of course.
the test results of our blood screenings for all White House personnel came back.
And?
everyone who took the test came back negative for non-terrestrial DNA.
good. Good work.
we can at least rule out the possibility of more sleepers within our ranks.
not exactly, Mr. President.
everyone who took the test came back negative.
there is still one holdout.
your wife.
once again, I'm comfortable with the First Lady's decision.
she's taking a moral stand.
I respect that. And so should you, Senator.
my job, the job you tasked me with, has been compromised, obstructed even, and I can't allow that to happen.
what is that?
I took the liberty of digging a little deeper into your wife's past, - family history, records...
you did what?
are there are inconsistencies.
there are dates and places that don't correspond.
you can't be serious.
people that don't exist.
all right, stop.
you're suggesting my wife is one of them?
so she, what, she married me 15 years ago in hopes that I would become President one day and then she'd be able to infiltrate my administration.
explain to me how any of that makes any sense.
this woman Sophia is a brilliant strategist.
maybe early on they identified you as promising, - a political up-and-comer. - Ridiculous.
once you were together, didn't Christina encourage your political career?
advise you, support, even suggest your decision to free Sophia's people?
enough.
listen, that's my wife you're talking about.
any attack on her is an attack on me, and that is a fight you will lose.
hurricane Katrina was six years ago, wasn't it?
Christina hasn't aged a day.
get out.
Eva, did I have any calls?
just your wife, Mr. Vice President.
how 'bout my schedule for the rest of the day?
you're wide open, except for a photo op at 3: 00.
photo op?
with the local firefighters' Union in honor of their service during the attacks on the monument.
Hello?
vice President Jarvis?
yes?
who is this?
how did you get this number?
it's not important.
it's Sophia.
don't bother trying to trace this call.
the hell I won't try.
please, Mr. Vice President, don't.
we've neutralized any intercepts on your phone.
are you alone? - What?
I'm asking you, are you alone?
Yes, I'm alone.
what... what the hell is this all about?
you expect me to have a conversation with you?
you murdered innocent Americans.
and it broke my heart to do so.
president Martinez forced my hand.
if he'd been willing to negotiate, no one would have gotten hurt.
I don't believe that.
we will find you and we will punish you for what you have done.
think about it.
it was Martinez's actions, not my own, that escalated the conflict, caused the senseless and tragic loss of life.
why are you calling me?
we both know that if things continue down this path, more of your people will end up dying.
that's a threat.
it's a plea... to avoid more bloodshed, which is what will happen if Martinez has his way.
avoided how?
by the two of us working together.
I'd like to meet with you in person to talk about it.
you and me working together?
what exactly are you talking about?
I'm talking about making you President.
come on. Come back.
come on!
impressive, Mr. Walker.
I think it's time we had a little talk.
Luis! Luis, help!
what? What' d you do?
it was an accident and I... I was trying to cut that and it just slipped.
here. Press it against the wound.
we have a medic.
she can take care of you, all right?
come this way.
that should heal without much of a scar.
you need to change your dressings at least two times a day.
okay.
all done.
do you think I could stay here for a bit?
I'm still feeling a little nauseous.
of course.
Simon... Can you talk?
I know my father is the one who turned you in, so I know what you must think, but I had nothing to do with it.
what do you want?
why were you gonna tell the government where we are?
because Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
but in order to do that she needs to make room for them.
it means genocide for humans, Leila.
wiping them out.
there's 7 billion people on earth.
that's... she can't. It's not possible.
it's already begun.
I managed to look through Thomas's house.
there were maps of Siberia, near Murmansk.
they're looking for some kind of weapon there.
a woman's name had been written on one of the maps, a Irina Bogdanov.
you need to get word out.
we have to stop her.
they took my cell. I tried using the phone at the house. It's dead.
Sophia's lieutenants, they have phones.
I want you to call the authorities, anyone you can get ahold of.
you need to warn them.
go.
get help.
go.
we'll need to sweep the room.
that won't be necessary.
it's protocol.
the room is clear.
sir.
I trust you won't mention this to anyone.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Vice President... I'm so glad you agreed to meet. We have much to discuss.
the only reason why I'm here is to put an end to this.
somehow I suspect that's not entirely true.
you're a murderer and a war criminal.
give me one reason not to pull this trigger.
if you kill me, you'll make me a martyr for my people.
more Americans will end up dying.
why should I believe a word you say?
my people are coming here in great numbers.
the human population will have to be substantially reduced.
we will fight back.
and you will lose.
you saw the destruction that we are capable of.
believe me when I tell you that was only the beginning.
why are you telling me this?
it's regrettable, but some countries will have to be destroyed while others will be allowed to coexist with us.
I'm offering you the chance to save your country.
you think we'll just sit back and allow you to take over the world?
that is not America.
that is not who we are.
no, no one is suggesting that you sit back.
I want you to take an active role in the new order.
I have always believed that, through cooperation and trust, our people can live together.
unfortunately, your President no longer shares this vision.
he is blinded by hatred, intent on war.
but the tragic fact remains that Martinez won't listen to reason.
not from you, not from anyone.
so we are left with a more... Permanent solution.
no.
with a more rational leader in power, we can negotiate the terms of our coexistence without violence.
no.
you are that leader, Mr. Vice President.
you hold the future of America in your hands.
this is insane.
we will help you.
it will be clean, untraceable.
a culmination of your lifelong devotion to this country.
I tried waiting up.
I really did.
I love you... So much.
me too.
we barely see each other anymore and the time we have is fraught.
honey, I'm sorry.
I want to be the man you fell in love with.
no matter how hard times are, whenever I look at you, Elias, you are.
you really are.
I can picture us in Belize. Mm-hmm.
where I fell in love with you.
your head was all in those guidebooks.
meanwhile, the sights were all around you.
well, I didn't want to miss anything.
Hey, slide over.
you had everything all planned out.
and you were not having any of it.
that's what I remember.
cause I didn't care about seeing the sights.
I'd seen them all before.
I only cared about being with you.
what do you mean?
about what?
you said you had seen everything before.
but how could you? You'd never been before that trip.
I meant pictures.
it sounded like you'd been there before.
no.
you also said at the time that your family was there.
we never saw them.
that was so long ago, I don't remember.
let's just go to sleep. It's getting late.
got it.
I'll have the Senator call you as soon as she's available.
can I help you?
I'm here to see Catherine.
the, um... the President is here.
sir, if this is about the other day, please forgive me.
sometimes I don't know when to stop.
Where's the file?
Why? Did something happen?
Where's the file?
how many people know about this?
nobody but me.
let's keep it that way.
Mr. President... I'm sorry.
Blake, We need to talk.
aren't you supposed to be giving a tour to someone?
I will not just shut up and keep my head down.
not when the future of our country hangs in the balance.
okay.
the President's hatred for Sophia is clouding his judgment.
is that right?
his refusal to negotiate with her will only lead to massive death and destruction.
you honestly expect him to negotiate with a terrorist responsible for hundreds of American casualties?
hundreds will turn into millions.
you saw what they were capable of.
we can't back down at their first show of strength.
I shouldn't need to tell you that.
Blake. We will lose this war.
we will lose everything.
compromise, diplomacy. That's what's needed here.
the President's relationship with Sophia is poisoned.
but maybe I can talk to her.
what?
I have diplomatic experience.
let me see if I can come up with some kind of an agreement.
a treaty for coexistence.
you can't be serious.
this country means everything to me, Blake.
just give me a chance to preserve our nation and our way of life.
I can help.
I promise you.
you promise?
you think a promise from you means anything?
after everything you've done, you expect to lead negotiations with a non-terrestrial enemy?
just one more chance, that's all I... You used your last chance a long time ago!
Blake. As far as I'm concerned, you should be in prison!
president's letting you play out your term for appearances only.
no one trusts you.
and no one forgives you.
you have a year and a half left, so please, Raymond just shut up and keep your head down.
mills used soil frozen in the ice cores to help pinpoint the location of the weapon.
the shifts in mineral composition and desiccation led him to focus on a 1.8 square kilometer region near the Dolgan coast.
thank you, Aaron.
we're close to finding it. So close.
Mr. Vice President.
I've thought about your proposal.
good.
I love this country.
I know.
that's why I came to you.
I don't think I could live with myself knowing I could have prevented the deaths of millions, the end of our nation, the end of our civilization as we know it.
I don't see any other way. But to work together.
you made the right decision.
your people will thank you one day.
my God. I pray that you're right.
follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
but would you like to come in?
I could really use a drink.
Yeah, you and me both.
do you want me to take your jacket?
sure.
Thanks.
listen, I'm gonna go use the bathroom real quick.
I'll be right back.
911 operator. What is your emergency?
please, you have to help me.
I'm being held by the people who blew up the Washington monument and they're planning something else.
ma'am, just relax and tell me where you are.
I don't know.
it's a housing development and there's... there's woods.
I... that's all I know.
Hey, open this damn door!
ma'am, are you okay?
please, can't you trace this call?
I've already tried a location track, but the GPS on your phone is deactivated.
you don't understand.
they're gonna kill... - Open this door!
he's kicking the door down!
please! You have to...
give me the phone, Leila. Give me the... ah!
Mr. Walker. I can see in your eyes how you feel about me, but you should know that everything I've done was with the best of intentions so I could stop what's about to happen.
he's insane, Sean.
don't listen to him.
the non-terrestrials have been coming here for thousands of years.
I am part of a tribe of sentinels who have been here just as long trying to protect humanity from them.
right now, the biggest threat we face is from a woman that you know as Sophia.
you're wrong.
she's... she's trying to protect us from her own people.
she may have been, but it became clear to us that eventually she would dedicate herself to our extinction.
how could you know that?
our sentinels have been around for more than three millennia.
we could see the real tapestry of history, the larger sweeping events to come.
this tells us that someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
it seems obvious to me now that someone is you.
look at the path that you've carved for yourself since the beginning.
a young man without resources taking on the government and myself to the point where you've tracked me way out here.
managed to save miss Roberts' life.
that was the point where your place in the tapestry of events was clear.
what do you say to that, Mr. Walker? The truth.
the truth is you're a monster.
an evil crazy old man with enough money and power to force everyone to pay for your delusions.
as long as I'm alive, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you and make you pay for everything that you've done.
I would expect no less.
but I have to move you away from that now and on to what really needs to be done.
I see only one way to do that.
this man will give you something that should be helpful.
it's not clear if you'll be able to stop Sophia or how.
but you have the best chance.
my God.
come on. We got to go.
come on. Let's go.
you okay?
careful.
could be rigged with a charge.
he had plenty of opportunity to kill us.
what is it?
I don't know.
what?
just... I'm just trying to make everything add up.
Why? What he told you doesn't make any sense.
I know that, but it did to him.
otherwise, why kill himself?
why give us this?
I don't know, but insane people never think they're insane, Sean.
anything else to do with Dempsey, with what he said, you have to forget it.
there's nothing else to do here but get the hell out.
who is it?
Hello?
Sean, there's so much to say, but I can't right now.
what's going on?
they want to take over.
what? Who?
my father's people.
even if it means killing everyone.
she's the one who's responsible for blowing up the Washington monument.
I was there when she gave the order.
who are you talking about?
Thomas... Thomas her son died and she's trying to save her people.
they're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
okay, just tell me where you are and I can... I don't know where I am.
forget about me. You have to stop her.
I don't know how much time you have, but not long.
I also have a woman's name.
she may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just... Ah! Ah!
where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me.
I know what Sophia' s trying to do.
who did you call? What did you tell them?
how could you be a part of this?
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
Hi.
I'm wide awake.
all I needed was a better book.
what's wrong?
what's that?
it's a file. On you. On your family.
I didn't commission it.
senator Lewis did on her own.
because I wouldn't take a blood test?
because she was suspicious.
because she had good reason to be.
you read it?
I couldn't.
I couldn't because I need you to tell me.
Christina, look at me.
is there something about you that I need to know?
tell me.
I can't.
as your husband, as the man... You love, tell me.
I... I wanted to.
from the moment I knew that we would spend our lives together, I wanted to tell you, but...The words just never came.
I thought they would destroy us.
so every year, I just buried it deeper and deeper, until I thought it was gone and I was safe and we were safe.
my parents are not from Cuba.
where are they from?
the Dominican.
they're here illegally.
america would have turned them away.
the Dominicans, the Haitians.
only the Cubans were getting amnesty, so my parents lied.
they forged these documents and found their way to Cuba and came here on the boats illegally, so that I could be free.
I'm sorry, Elias.
Oh... I'm...So sorry.
what will this do to you if it comes out?
Oh, we'll figure that out. It's okay.
everything's okay. It's done. It's done.
vice President Jarvis, this is Dr. Lu.
she's the acupuncturist you requested.
Dr. Lu, thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
it's my pleasure to be of service to such an important man.
those look sharp.
very sharp, but you won't even feel it.
quick and painless. And the problem will be eliminated for good.
Hey, Jay, give me a minute to get dressed.
Jarvis has it.
will he use it?
he's naive enough to think he can save his country, but... Once we have our weapon, nothing can.
let's go!
let's get it out of the ground!
to the right.
good morning, Mr. Vice President.
good morning.
I guess I'm a little early.
only by a few minutes.
can I get you some coffee?
uh, no, thanks.
I'll help myself.
Oh, do you have any more of those croissants you had yesterday?
I'll get those right away.
great. Thank you.
good morning, Mr. President.
all right, let's deal with the issues on the Hill first.
let's get that out of the way.
we're safe.
these are Thomas's people.
you okay?
your house is back there, Leila.
are you telling me that I can't leave?
we will bring all our people here and make this planet our own.
if you aren't with us, then you're against us.
I'll never go along with genocide.
I'm sorry, Simon.
I've asked everyone with White House clearance to sign a testing agreement.
you should know that there was one holdout.
who? - Your wife.
how do you expect me to find Dempsey when he's in France?
you just get us there, and I'll worry about the rest.

listen to me, this is important.
they can't know what you've been working on.
do you understand?

please, I'm so close.
I'm sorry, Herbert.
you know what you have to do.

not exactly, Mr. President.
everyone who took the test came back negative.
there is still one holdout.
your wife.
once again, I'm comfortable with the First Lady's decision.
she's taking a moral stand.
I respect that. And so should you, Senator.
my job, the job you tasked me with, has been compromised, obstructed even, and I can't allow that to happen.
what is that?
I took the liberty of digging a little deeper into your wife's past, - family history, records...
you did what?
are there are inconsistencies.
there are dates and places that don't correspond.
you can't be serious.
people that don't exist.
all right, stop.
you're suggesting my wife is one of them?
so she, what, she married me 15 years ago in hopes that I would become President one day and then she'd be able to infiltrate my administration.
explain to me how any of that makes any sense.
this woman Sophia is a brilliant strategist.
maybe early on they identified you as promising, - a political up-and-comer. - Ridiculous.
once you were together, didn't Christina encourage your political career?
advise you, support, even suggest your decision to free Sophia's people?
enough.
listen, that's my wife you're talking about.
any attack on her is an attack on me, and that is a fight you will lose.
hurricane Katrina was six years ago, wasn't it?
Christina hasn't aged a day.
get out.
Eva, did I have any calls?
just your wife, Mr. Vice President.
how 'bout my schedule for the rest of the day?
you're wide open, except for a photo op at 3: 00.
photo op?
with the local firefighters' Union in honor of their service during the attacks on the monument.
Hello?
vice President Jarvis?
yes?
who is this?
how did you get this number?
it's not important.
it's Sophia.
don't bother trying to trace this call.
the hell I won't try.
please, Mr. Vice President, don't.
we've neutralized any intercepts on your phone.
are you alone? - What?
I'm asking you, are you alone?
Yes, I'm alone.
what... what the hell is this all about?
you expect me to have a conversation with you?
you murdered innocent Americans.
and it broke my heart to do so.
president Martinez forced my hand.
if he'd been willing to negotiate, no one would have gotten hurt.
I don't believe that.
we will find you and we will punish you for what you have done.
think about it.
it was Martinez's actions, not my own, that escalated the conflict, caused the senseless and tragic loss of life.
why are you calling me?
we both know that if things continue down this path, more of your people will end up dying.
that's a threat.
it's a plea... to avoid more bloodshed, which is what will happen if Martinez has his way.
avoided how?
by the two of us working together.
I'd like to meet with you in person to talk about it.
you and me working together?
what exactly are you talking about?
I'm talking about making you President.
come on. Come back.
come on!
impressive, Mr. Walker.
I think it's time we had a little talk.
Luis! Luis, help!
what? What' d you do?
it was an accident and I... I was trying to cut that and it just slipped.
here. Press it against the wound.
we have a medic.
she can take care of you, all right?
come this way.
that should heal without much of a scar.
you need to change your dressings at least two times a day.
okay.
all done.
do you think I could stay here for a bit?
I'm still feeling a little nauseous.
of course.
Simon... Can you talk?
I know my father is the one who turned you in, so I know what you must think, but I had nothing to do with it.
what do you want?
why were you gonna tell the government where we are?
because Sophia, she's bringing all of our people here.
but in order to do that she needs to make room for them.
it means genocide for humans, Leila.
wiping them out.
there's 7 billion people on earth.
that's... she can't. It's not possible.
it's already begun.
I managed to look through Thomas's house.
there were maps of Siberia, near Murmansk.
they're looking for some kind of weapon there.
a woman's name had been written on one of the maps, a Irina Bogdanov.
you need to get word out.
we have to stop her.
they took my cell. I tried using the phone at the house. It's dead.
Sophia's lieutenants, they have phones.
I want you to call the authorities, anyone you can get ahold of.
you need to warn them.
go.
get help.
go.
we'll need to sweep the room.
that won't be necessary.
it's protocol.
the room is clear.
sir.
I trust you won't mention this to anyone.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Vice President... I'm so glad you agreed to meet. We have much to discuss.
the only reason why I'm here is to put an end to this.
somehow I suspect that's not entirely true.
you're a murderer and a war criminal.
give me one reason not to pull this trigger.
if you kill me, you'll make me a martyr for my people.
more Americans will end up dying.
why should I believe a word you say?
my people are coming here in great numbers.
the human population will have to be substantially reduced.
we will fight back.
and you will lose.
you saw the destruction that we are capable of.
believe me when I tell you that was only the beginning.
why are you telling me this?
it's regrettable, but some countries will have to be destroyed while others will be allowed to coexist with us.
I'm offering you the chance to save your country.
you think we'll just sit back and allow you to take over the world?
that is not America.
that is not who we are.
no, no one is suggesting that you sit back.
I want you to take an active role in the new order.
I have always believed that, through cooperation and trust, our people can live together.
unfortunately, your President no longer shares this vision.
he is blinded by hatred, intent on war.
but the tragic fact remains that Martinez won't listen to reason.
not from you, not from anyone.
so we are left with a more... Permanent solution.
no.
with a more rational leader in power, we can negotiate the terms of our coexistence without violence.
no.
you are that leader, Mr. Vice President.
you hold the future of America in your hands.
this is insane.
we will help you.
it will be clean, untraceable.
a culmination of your lifelong devotion to this country.
I tried waiting up.
I really did.
I love you... So much.
me too.
we barely see each other anymore and the time we have is fraught.
honey, I'm sorry.
I want to be the man you fell in love with.
no matter how hard times are, whenever I look at you, Elias, you are.
you really are.
I can picture us in Belize. Mm-hmm.
where I fell in love with you.
your head was all in those guidebooks.
meanwhile, the sights were all around you.
well, I didn't want to miss anything.
Hey, slide over.
you had everything all planned out.
and you were not having any of it.
that's what I remember.
cause I didn't care about seeing the sights.
I'd seen them all before.
I only cared about being with you.
what do you mean?
about what?
you said you had seen everything before.
but how could you? You'd never been before that trip.
I meant pictures.
it sounded like you'd been there before.
no.
you also said at the time that your family was there.
we never saw them.
that was so long ago, I don't remember.
let's just go to sleep. It's getting late.
got it.
I'll have the Senator call you as soon as she's available.
can I help you?
I'm here to see Catherine.
the, um... the President is here.
sir, if this is about the other day, please forgive me.
sometimes I don't know when to stop.
Where's the file?
Why? Did something happen?
Where's the file?
how many people know about this?
nobody but me.
let's keep it that way.
Mr. President... I'm sorry.
Blake, We need to talk.
aren't you supposed to be giving a tour to someone?
I will not just shut up and keep my head down.
not when the future of our country hangs in the balance.
okay.
the President's hatred for Sophia is clouding his judgment.
is that right?
his refusal to negotiate with her will only lead to massive death and destruction.
you honestly expect him to negotiate with a terrorist responsible for hundreds of American casualties?
hundreds will turn into millions.
you saw what they were capable of.
we can't back down at their first show of strength.
I shouldn't need to tell you that.
Blake. We will lose this war.
we will lose everything.
compromise, diplomacy. That's what's needed here.
the President's relationship with Sophia is poisoned.
but maybe I can talk to her.
what?
I have diplomatic experience.
let me see if I can come up with some kind of an agreement.
a treaty for coexistence.
you can't be serious.
this country means everything to me, Blake.
just give me a chance to preserve our nation and our way of life.
I can help.
I promise you.
you promise?
you think a promise from you means anything?
after everything you've done, you expect to lead negotiations with a non-terrestrial enemy?
just one more chance, that's all I... You used your last chance a long time ago!
Blake. As far as I'm concerned, you should be in prison!
president's letting you play out your term for appearances only.
no one trusts you.
and no one forgives you.
you have a year and a half left, so please, Raymond just shut up and keep your head down.
mills used soil frozen in the ice cores to help pinpoint the location of the weapon.
the shifts in mineral composition and desiccation led him to focus on a 1.8 square kilometer region near the Dolgan coast.
thank you, Aaron.
we're close to finding it. So close.
Mr. Vice President.
I've thought about your proposal.
good.
I love this country.
I know.
that's why I came to you.
I don't think I could live with myself knowing I could have prevented the deaths of millions, the end of our nation, the end of our civilization as we know it.
I don't see any other way. But to work together.
you made the right decision.
your people will thank you one day.
my God. I pray that you're right.
follow my instructions, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be leader of the free world.
everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
but would you like to come in?
I could really use a drink.
Yeah, you and me both.
do you want me to take your jacket?
sure.
Thanks.
listen, I'm gonna go use the bathroom real quick.
I'll be right back.
911 operator. What is your emergency?
please, you have to help me.
I'm being held by the people who blew up the Washington monument and they're planning something else.
ma'am, just relax and tell me where you are.
I don't know.
it's a housing development and there's... there's woods.
I... that's all I know.
Hey, open this damn door!
ma'am, are you okay?
please, can't you trace this call?
I've already tried a location track, but the GPS on your phone is deactivated.
you don't understand.
they're gonna kill... - Open this door!
he's kicking the door down!
please! You have to...
give me the phone, Leila. Give me the... ah!
Mr. Walker. I can see in your eyes how you feel about me, but you should know that everything I've done was with the best of intentions so I could stop what's about to happen.
he's insane, Sean.
don't listen to him.
the non-terrestrials have been coming here for thousands of years.
I am part of a tribe of sentinels who have been here just as long trying to protect humanity from them.
right now, the biggest threat we face is from a woman that you know as Sophia.
you're wrong.
she's... she's trying to protect us from her own people.
she may have been, but it became clear to us that eventually she would dedicate herself to our extinction.
how could you know that?
our sentinels have been around for more than three millennia.
we could see the real tapestry of history, the larger sweeping events to come.
this tells us that someone outside of our group might be able to stop Sophia.
it seems obvious to me now that someone is you.
look at the path that you've carved for yourself since the beginning.
a young man without resources taking on the government and myself to the point where you've tracked me way out here.
managed to save miss Roberts' life.
that was the point where your place in the tapestry of events was clear.
what do you say to that, Mr. Walker? The truth.
the truth is you're a monster.
an evil crazy old man with enough money and power to force everyone to pay for your delusions.
as long as I'm alive, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you and make you pay for everything that you've done.
I would expect no less.
but I have to move you away from that now and on to what really needs to be done.
I see only one way to do that.
this man will give you something that should be helpful.
it's not clear if you'll be able to stop Sophia or how.
but you have the best chance.
my God.
come on. We got to go.
come on. Let's go.
you okay?
careful.
could be rigged with a charge.
he had plenty of opportunity to kill us.
what is it?
I don't know.
what?
just... I'm just trying to make everything add up.
Why? What he told you doesn't make any sense.
I know that, but it did to him.
otherwise, why kill himself?
why give us this?
I don't know, but insane people never think they're insane, Sean.
anything else to do with Dempsey, with what he said, you have to forget it.
there's nothing else to do here but get the hell out.
who is it?
Hello?
Sean, there's so much to say, but I can't right now.
what's going on?
they want to take over.
what? Who?
my father's people.
even if it means killing everyone.
she's the one who's responsible for blowing up the Washington monument.
I was there when she gave the order.
who are you talking about?
Thomas... Thomas her son died and she's trying to save her people.
they're looking for some kind of weapon in Siberia near a place called Murmansk.
okay, just tell me where you are and I can... I don't know where I am.
forget about me. You have to stop her.
I don't know how much time you have, but not long.
I also have a woman's name.
she may be involved.
I don't know anything else.
I just... Ah! Ah!
where did you get this?
Leila, talk to me.
I know what Sophia' s trying to do.
who did you call? What did you tell them?
how could you be a part of this?
I don't know what kind of damage you may have just caused, but if Sophia finds out, I won't be able to protect you.
Hi.
I'm wide awake.
all I needed was a better book.
what's wrong?
what's that?
it's a file. On you. On your family.
I didn't commission it.
senator Lewis did on her own.
because I wouldn't take a blood test?
because she was suspicious.
because she had good reason to be.
you read it?
I couldn't.
I couldn't because I need you to tell me.
Christina, look at me.
is there something about you that I need to know?
tell me.
I can't.
as your husband, as the man... You love, tell me.
I... I wanted to.
from the moment I knew that we would spend our lives together, I wanted to tell you, but...The words just never came.
I thought they would destroy us.
so every year, I just buried it deeper and deeper, until I thought it was gone and I was safe and we were safe.
my parents are not from Cuba.
where are they from?
the Dominican.
they're here illegally.
america would have turned them away.
the Dominicans, the Haitians.
only the Cubans were getting amnesty, so my parents lied.
they forged these documents and found their way to Cuba and came here on the boats illegally, so that I could be free.
I'm sorry, Elias.
Oh... I'm...So sorry.
what will this do to you if it comes out?
Oh, we'll figure that out. It's okay.
everything's okay. It's done. It's done.
vice President Jarvis, this is Dr. Lu.
she's the acupuncturist you requested.
Dr. Lu, thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
it's my pleasure to be of service to such an important man.
those look sharp.
very sharp, but you won't even feel it.
quick and painless. And the problem will be eliminated for good.
Hey, Jay, give me a minute to get dressed.
Jarvis has it.
will he use it?
he's naive enough to think he can save his country, but... Once we have our weapon, nothing can.
let's go!
let's get it out of the ground!
to the right.
good morning, Mr. Vice President.
good morning.
I guess I'm a little early.
only by a few minutes.
can I get you some coffee?
uh, no, thanks.
I'll help myself.
Oh, do you have any more of those croissants you had yesterday?
I'll get those right away.
great. Thank you.
good morning, Mr. President.
all right, let's deal with the issues on the Hill first.
bp dropping. 80 over 40.
what's happening to him?
where the hell is neurosurge?
we lost the pulse! We lost the pulse!
he slipped into a coma after the surgery.
I know you poisoned the president.
I know you're working with sophia.
that's preposterous! Now, you listen to me! - You listen!
the only reason she helped you get where you are... - Remember who you're talking to!
is because she knew it would give her controlof this office.
you may tender your resignationeffective immediately.
we'll need to run more tests on the lung tissue as soon as it gets here. Where is it now?
in a temperaturecontrolled container.
our courier is handcarrying it as we speak.
Sean! Go, go!
drop it or I'll kill him! Drop it now!
Vicky, shoot him! Don't let them take the case!
gotta get you out of here.
michael and simon are gone.
we have to find them before they escape.
there's a vial in my pocket.
get it to the president as soon as you can.
no, dad! Dad!
he's gone.
Sophia, I'mi'm sorry.
we were trying to stop them from escaping.
I'm so sorry.
it's not your fault.
look what you did to him!
you killed my father. I hate you.
I've known your father longer than you can comprehend.
you have no idea what I felt for him.
did he have it? Michael?
what are you talking about? - The compound.
michael came into the lab. I tried to stop him.
what compound? - A counteragent.
DNA repair enzymes.
it can reverse the effects of the poison we gave martinez.
search them.
let go of me!
it has to be simon.
we have to assume that he's on the wayto the hospital now.
if martinez recovers, everything that we've been working towardwill be compromised.
no. I will send a search team after him.
no. Simon is a highly trained agent.
you'll never find him.
but I have another way.
in the meantime, we have to completely evacuate the compound.
make sure everyone's safe before simon has a chanceto alert the authorities.
get her away from him.
no. No. Let Let go of me!
daddy's still sleeping, honey.
but he wants you to be strong and send him good thoughts, okay?
all right, be a good boy. I'll be home soon.
love you.
our son...
he wants to see his daddy.
so what's the next step?
at this point, i'm afraid we've done everything we can, mrs. Martinez.
he's not getting any better. He's getting worse.
I'm sorry.
you're just gonna give up?
no. No.
we've narrowed down the optionsfor director sterling's replacement.
these are very good candidates.
I don't want very good candidates.
I want the best.
you fired the best.
with all due respect.
director sterling was a dangerous man.
the things he said about me, the man is not in his right mind.
I can't have a man like that at the headof the intelligence operations.
and for you to constantly remind me of his importance only makes you suspect.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
one second.
hello.
excuse me.
uh, that'll be all, mr. Peel.
thank you very much.
sure. Mr. President.
yes? - We have a problem.
Simon lee has gotten a hold of a counteragent.
a counteragent?
he can use it to reverse the effects of the poison we gave martinez.
how did this happen?
I knew this was a mistake.
I can't believe I let you... - Raymond, listen to me.
you need to focus all your energieson finding simon lee and stopping him before he reaches that hospital.
it's easy for you to sit back and issue commands.
but I'm the onethat has to handle the reality on the ground.
the reality is that you have every resource of the federal government available to youto find one man.
use them.
because if martinez recovers and the truth comes out, they will put you away for the rest of your life.
there's
and we can't just keep driving.
if we want to stop sophia from getting her hands on this virus, and then we're gonna need some help.
I'm working on it.
no, we need to call the police and just tell them what we know.
we can't. We know from what happened on the plane that someone high up in the governmentis helping sophia.
but I've got their plates and I know their carwas a rental. - And?
since the mid'90s, every rental car has a tracking device so the companies can monitor their vehicles.
so if I can get into the company's system,
I might be able to find the car.
might.
sorry.
you saw what that virus did to those people on the ship.
how they died.
if sophia releases the virus, how bad could it be?
the original spanish flue epidemic killed between 50 and 100 million people and that's before international travelwas so easy.
and this strain's more virulent?
way more. If sophia released it,
I don't know what would be left.
Hey. - What do you got?
hopefully them. 50 miles up ahead.
word from gerard just came in.
he was able to establish communicationwith the home planet.
it's worse than we thought.
radiation levels have become catastrophic.
people are dying.
we need to make room here. We need to get this done.
I understand that better than anyone.
how close are we to releasing the virus?
close. But in order for a global pandemicto be successful, the host has to survive long enoughto spread the disease.
this is the footage aaron sent from the irina bogdanov.
the doctor handling the virus was human, and therefore not immune like us.
there. His clean suit becomes compromised.
this is the point of infection.
the conditions for this outbreak were not suitablefor drawing any conclusions.
it was released in close quartersin great concentration.
I need a more accurate simulationto judge the efficacy of the virus.
if it's more reliable data you need, the next field test should provide it.
freeze. Hands in the air.
turn around. Slowly.
give me one good reason why I shouldn't puta bullet in you right now?
Martinez. I can save his life.
don't play me, simon.
I know sophia used jarvis to poison the president.
why would they want to spare him now?
they don't. I do.
I've split with sophia for good.
once I realized what she wanted to do.
how many people she was willing to murder.
I don't believe you.
I have a counteragent. An antidote.
why would I trust you?
everything you ever told me was a lie.
it's the truth. I was free and clear.
why else would I risk coming back here?
maybe you think you can manipulate me.
Sophia did it to martinez time and time again.
turns out I was an even bigger fool than he was.
I'm sorry.
but believe me when I say I was doing itfor the common good.
even now, I still believe there can be peace between us.
how? - Starting with this.
slowly.
you can undo what they did to martinez with this.
take it.
what possible motive could I haveother than saving his life?
he's going to die anyway? What do you have to lose?
look, you don't believe me, shoot me.
just get this to martinez before it's too late.
move away from the window.
what is it?
silver sedan across the street.
were you followed? - No. No. I'm sure of it.
then jarvis must've put a tail on me.
Why?
Sophia's working with the vice president.
we have to assume she told him to stop you before you could save martinez.
and jarvis knew i'd come to you for help.
it's lee.
are you sure?
he was my partner for ten years.
man. - So they really are working together.
we have a visual of agent lee inside the house.
copy that. We'll cover the back.
let's move.
they've stopped. Ten miles out.
where?
Crossreferencing to a street map.
there's the car.
okay. Just keep driving past it.
no one.
I don't see any case.
blueprints of the mall.
details of the air circulation system.
Sophia wants a record of this.
port all surveillance cameras to her.
meet me on the roof.
bill and I
Berman and diaz, you back us upand watch the side windows.
Hayes and reese, hold down the back of the house.
copy that. - On my go, guys.
what is that?
hold your positions.
drop your weapons now!
federal agent! Put it on the ground!
we have credentials! - Shut up!
I said drop your weapons!
you guys are blowing a cia operation!
last warning! Drop your guns!
drop them. Easy.
keep your hands where we can see them.
easy. Easy. Easy.
check my left back pocket.
left back pocket.
we're on a covert op. At least it was covert.
they're legit. Stand down.
we got a 911 call about an armed robbery at this address.
son of a bitch. Move in.
Hayes, reese, move in!
okay! Clear!
men down!
went out? - Yeah.
damn it.
how did you let this happen?
you had your best men on this?
I don't care. You find them and stop them!
Yes. - There's been a problem.
we almost had the counteragent.
agent lee escaped.
with all the resources that you have at your disposal, you can't find one man?
there's something else.
agent lee escaped with blake sterling's help.
they're working together now.
you understand that if martinez recoversand returns to the presidency, we'd no longer have an agreement.
because one of your people found an antidote?
I don't appreciate your tone, raymond.
you're changing the terms.
I did my part by getting martinez out of the way.
and you agreed to spare american lives.
keep simon from getting the counteragent to martinez and that will still be the case.
your country will be spared when my people arrive.
how do I know you're not playing me?
do as I say, raymond. You have no other options.
I didn't expect to start the dayby stealing a car.
we have to assume martinez will be heavily guarded.
there's no way we'll be able to get the antidote to him.
not in time.
last word from the doctor is it's only a matter of hours.
can we use peel?
Jarvis will be suspicious of him too.
there's only one other option.
the first lady.
the only problem is jarvis probably realizes that too.
excuse me.
I'm sorry. This is a restricted zone.
what?
the white house raised the security protocol.
access to president martinez is restrictedto essential personnel only.
I'm his wife. I was just with him.
I left to go and see my son.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but the attorney general's orders were very clear.
call the attorney general's office.
I mean, there must be some sort of mixup.
I'm his wife. I should have access.
Yes, ma'am. I'll do it right away.
I have to go.
call me as soon as you hear anything.
Hello? - Christina, it's blake sterling.
Blake. - We need to talk, but we can't do it under these circumstances.
go ahead.
we intercepteda 24second conversation between Mrs. Martinez and former director sterling.
24 seconds. Is that all? - Yes, sir.
well, what did sterling say?
we don't know yet. The call was encrypted.
then decrypt it.
as I told you before, it's for her own protection.
now, how long will it take you to decrypt it?
within a few hours. - Damn it.
I don't have that kind of time. eva!
Mr. President.
get me a location on the first lady.
the air units are on the roof.
you have to evacuate everyone as fast as you can.
Sean. - What?
be careful.
Yes. - I've got you routedinto the video surveillance system.
you should have a visual on the site now.
how much longer before you proceedwith the test?
Alex is aerosolizing the virus as we speak.
excuse me. I need your help.
we have to evacuate the mall. - What?
I'm a federal agent.
someone disabled the fire alarm and they're about to release a bioweapon through the ventilation system.
how do you know this?
listen to me.
everybody in this mall is gonna die unless you sound the alarm and get them out.
I got to talk to my supervisor, okay?
no, you're gonna listen to me or you're gonna be the first one to die, all right?
now move.
look at camera four.
that's the man from alex's flight.
the one who tried to stop us.
his name is sean walker.
you know him?
Yes. And I think I know who told him alexwas on the plane.
he must've figured out we were gonna release the virus.
you can't let him stop it.
what's going on?
keep working.
this is not acceptable.
I don't care what you have to doto get it done, just do it.
I am his wife. They can't just shut me out.
I came to check on eli.
I wanted to speak to his doctors personally.
how's he doing?
well, I wouldn't know. They won't let me see him.
the attorney general issued some sort of order.
well, there must be some miscommunication.
I told the attorney general to limit all access to eli's room, but I should have specifiedit didn't apply to you.
I'll call him. I'll make it right.
Christina, there's something I need to tell you.
Eli didn't have a stroke.
he was poisoned.
what?
I know this will come as big of a shock to youas it did to me.
but director blake sterlingand one of his agents, simon lee, are working together.
they're the ones that tried to kill your husband.
no. I don't believe that. That can't be true.
I didn't believe it either. But there's no question.
I'll show you all the evidence later.
but now you understand why I have to control the accessto eli's room.
I'm afraid blake and agent lee will try again.
after what happened in coral gables, ray, how do you expect me to ever trust me again?
Christina, can't you see now I had nothing to do with that?
these men blake sterling and agent leeWill stop at nothing.
last time I saw blake, we were at elias' bedside and I knew there was something he wasn't telling me.
what do you mean?
he said that there was nothing anyone could do to prevent elias' stroke.
but it was the way he said it.
I knew that he was keeping something from me.
and now it makes total sense.
well, we're going to do everything we can to find him to make sure nothing worse can happen.
but we're at a bit of a disadvantage.
we have no idea where sterling and agent lee are.
I do.
what?
Blake called me today.
he asked me to meet him in secret.
my god. Where?
at a warehouse on south kendall street.
south kendall street.
I can't believe this is happening.
Christina, you have my word we're going to do everything we can to find them and stop them.
give us a moment, please.
it's hard for me to look at you and not see him.
your father. His courage. His resolve.
I understand you better than you think.
but you have to know how misguided you are.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
but if you had to choose between saving your family and saving someone else's, what would you do?
who would you save?
I need to know what you told sean walker.
I didn't tell him anything. - But you did.
Simon or your father told you about the weapon we've acquired.
I need to know what else you told him.
tell me!
go to hell.
don't choose the wrong side on this, leila, because I will do everything I can to protect my people.
my family. Our family.
I'm not telling you anything.
by involving sean in this, you've ensured his death.
same way you did with your father.
their blood's on your hands.
Where's the alarm? - Who did this?
the people I told you about. Now move it. The alarm.
master relay's in here.
even after the alarm sounds, evacuation time's still rated at 20, 25 minutes.
there's a lot of people out there.
can you turn off the air system?
we can shut down the breakers, but... - Do it.
there's a battery backup somewhere.
I wouldn't know how to do it. - Hit the alarm.
there.
this is an evacuation alert.
please proceed immediately to the nearest exit.
this is an evacuation alert.
please proceed immediately to the nearest exit.
this is an evacuation alert.
please proceed immediately to the nearest exit.
please proceed immediately to the nearest exit.
everybody out! Move it! Come on! Move it!
let's go. Move.
keep it moving! Let's go!
this is an evacuation alert.
Sean, where is she?
she's gone.
what is it?
looks like a pressurized tank that's connected to the air recirculating system.
we have to disarm it. There's still hundreds of people down there.
Yeah. Here we are.
this is realtime footagefrom an Imint spy satellite positioned on the south kendall street address, sir.
it appears that the intelligence you provided was correct, mr. President. Blake sterling and simon lee are preparing to meetwith your source.
you still haven't told us who this source is, mr. President.
all you need to know is that the information
I've received has informed me that traitorous actions will be set in motion against our government.
actions that must be stopped.
with all due respect, mr. President,
I find it hard to believe that blake sterling would participate in any action that would harm this country.
what more proof do you need, mr. Peel?
there it is plain as day.
meeting covertly with an enemy of our government.
our tactical team is ten minutes out, sir.
tell them to stand down. They won't be necessary.
excuse me?
I'm coordinating with the air force on this.
ask general mcmillan if the predator droneis ready for its air strike.
air strike? You can't possibly be serious.
we are a country at war and these men are traitors.
with all due respect, sir, this is a mistake.
this is an order!
well, I cannot condone it, sir.
well, I'm not asking for your approval, general.
I am the president of the united states.
I control the military. I control this office.
and if you can't condone the actions of your commander in chief, you can get the hell out!
anyone else?
the drone is in position, mr. President.
this is an assassination.
tell them to fire when ready.
you have orders from the presidentto fire when ready.
okay, you're clear. Prepare to fire.
firing, sir.
copy that. Missile's on its way.
direct hit, sir.
the targets have been eliminated.
I need confirmation on the kills.
commander, the president requires confirmationthat the targets have been neutralized.
this is an evacuation alert.
please proceed immediately to the nearest exit.
I'mI'mI'm not sure what I'm doing.
I thought you were an expert.
I hack computers. Not virusreleasing...
okay. Fine. Okay. Fine.
fine. Justjust do something.
we're running out of time.
okay. All right. All right.
the timer's connected to an actuatorthat opens a solenoid valve.
so if I disrupt the signal to the transducer...
Ah. There.
okay, we have to get out of here.
come on. We have to save ourselves.
there has to be There has to be a power source.
a battery. If I can disrupt the power to the timer - But how? - I don't know. I don't know.
all of the components are anchored.
so if I pull the wrong wire, everyone
okay, sean, we don't have time for you to sit hereand figure this out.
then go.
then you go, okay?
I'm not going anywhere. Justjust think.
there's got to be something else that will disrupt the power.
sorry. II panicked.
it worked.
search him.
got it
I wanted to thank you personallyfor everything you've done.
has there been any word about the deviceat the mall?
Yes. They managed to disarm it.
I'm sorry. I should have stayed.
no. If you had, we might have lost everything.
Dr. Lu has been studying the video you filmedonboard the bus.
now that she's able to see every minuteof how the virus affects humans as well as having these test subjects to autopsy, we'll be able to move forward.
we owe you a debt of gratitude.
Sophia, Dr. Lu needs you in the lab.
excuse me.
I think I have a way to slow down the virus.
go on.
viruses mutate when they jumpfrom species to species.
like bird flu becoming h1n1
when it crossed into humans.
if we jump the virus into the right species, it will mutate on its own and we can screenfor the variation we need.
what kind of species would that be?
the virus doesn't affect us at all, and it kills human beings too quickly.
we need to infect a bridge specieswhose dna lies somewhere inbetween.
a hybrid. - Yes.
and from what I understand, we're in luck.
give me a minute.
I was told I'm able to see my husband now.
Yes, ma'am. The order's been lifted by order of the president.
ma'am, his vital signs continue on a declining slope.
his last e. e.g. Indicated no signsof highfunctioning brain activity.
I'm sorry. There's nothing to be done.
I refuse to believe that.
Mrs. Martinez, there is just nothing
you heard me, doctor. I refuse. Thank you.
thank you.
we're gonna need something to clear this debris!
sir. I have something, sir.
get a team down there. Find out where this goes now.
what do you mean "no bodies"?
reconnaissance found a tunnel that lead to an outbuilding.
they're canvassing the area.
but the conclusion on the ground is they're long gone.
Mr. President.
sir, I've decrypted the conversationbetween director sterling and the first lady.
play it.
Hello? - Christina, it's blake sterling.
Blake. - We need to talk, but we can't do it under these circumstances.
I believe the phones are monitored.
go outside. There's a pay phone on the eastern side of the street across from the hospital.
Blake, what is it?
Christina, you have to trust me.
Jarvis is behind everything that's happened to your husband, but I have a way to save him.
I'll call you on the pay phone in five minutes.
okay. I'm on my way out now.
she lied to me.
he told her about the warehouse. It was all a diversion.
Oh. Oh, god.
what's going on?
Carlos? Carlos, please.
what is that?
what iswhat is that?
in 1918, the spanish flu pandemickilled 20% of the world's population.
there were localized strains and mutations.
this is one of them.
a strain so deadly, it turned entire citiesinto graveyards...
no. Please. - Overnight.
please. Please don't do this.
we worked very hard to find this particular strain.
and now you, a hybrid, a bridge between our people...
I have a counteragent.
you can undo what they did to Martinez with this.
keep Simon from giving the counteragent to Martinez.
how do I know you're not playing me?
do as I say, Raymond.
Martinez will be heavily guarded.
there's no way we'll be able to get to him.
there's only one other option...
the first lady.
Sophia wants a record of this.
meet me on the roof. We have to evacuate the mall.
someone disabled the fire alarm, and they're about to release a bioweaponthrough the ventilation system.
Sean, where is she?
we owe you a debt of gratitude.
Dr. Lu has been studyingthe video you filmed on board the bus.
we'll be able to move forward.
in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemickilled 20% of the world's population.
you're gonna help us spread it.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
help me.
are you the doctor?
no.
my mom said to wait until she came backwith the doctor.
I'm sorry.
my little brother's sick, too, and he won't wake up.
why is everybody sick?
um...
miss, please help me.
I can't. - Please!
I can't do anything. I can't. I can't.
help me! - I'm sorry.
it's your fault!
I'm sorry.
why won't you help me?
we're fortunate.
her immune system mutated the virus the way we'd hoped.
it replicates at a much slower rate now.
the pathogen will now take several days to kill.
good. How long will it taketo affect the population at large?
within two weeks, the infection will have killedover 25% of the world's population.
within five, close to 98%.
we only have to make room for our--our own people.
there has to be a way to control the disease, to limit the number of deaths.
there isn't.
the strength of the pathogen is it's uncontrollable.
Sophia, we need to bring our people here.
does need always justify action?
this goes against everything we believe in.
if the situation were reversed, they wouldn't hesitate to do the same to us.
I appologize But keep the reception on.
see if you can find someone to speak on my behalf.
I just don't want to disappoint the kids.
nurse. Nurse, can you come in here, please?
Yes, ma'am.
doctor.
what's happening? - Tidal volume?
no, we're good. I'll check all the leads.
his E. E.G. readings are showing improvement in higher level brain activity.
he's getting better.
Mrs. Martinez, please understandthis is probably anomalous, random electrical activity in the brain.
no, doctor, he's--he's getting better.
he's getting better.
you're getting better, aren't you, my love? You're getting better.
we just got word from home. Everything's in place there.
our people are ready to come.
a-and everything is set on our end?
Yes, we'll have to leave the portal array onfor several more hours, but there is this reconnaissance satelliteover that area of Tibet, and Gerard's concerned that we're gonna be detected.
all right, I'll take care of it.
I'm not comfortable blindly doing your bidding.
if you want me to do something, I need to know the reason.
this satellite is shared by NATObut operated by your N. S.A.
I need it redirected.
the N. S.A. refers to it internally as E-3175.
please repeat that back to me.
thank you, Raymond.
there's something else, Sophia.
I just got word that Martinez's condition is improving.
meaning you didn't stop themfrom getting the counteragent to him.
the counteragent--can it really reverse what happened to him?
it can.
you can't allow Martinez to re-enter the equation.
it could jeopardize everything for both of us.
do you understand?
Sophia, I need your word that if we continue to work together, you'll do what you said, and you'll spare the American people.
I give you my word.
he'll realize he's been duped as soon as we release the pathogenand Americans start getting sick.
by then, it'll be too late.
all right, thank you.
that was Peel.
the President's still in a coma, but there are definite signs he's improving.
that's great news.
were you able to find anything actionable about Sophia?
she sent a team to Siberiato search for the weapon she plans to use.
that makes some sense.
a few weeks ago, we discovered Sophiahad one of your people working on ice-core samples from eastern Russia.
what could Sophia have been looking for in the ice?
I don't know.
but I think she found it.
according to Peel, Jarvis waved off an actionon an inbound Russian passenger plane.
so whatever the weapon is, you think it was on that plane.
Yeah, and now it's here.
a Hazmat team is on site here, - and shopping mall patrons were evacuated and are safe. - What is it?
his name is Roman. He's one of our people.
...in the background there, leading authorities to believe that he may have played a partin this thwarted terrorist attack.
terrorist attack...
also, police are trying to locate a city transit busthat's still missing.
and a dead sleeper.
he was carrying cash and his driver's license. That's it.
so we have nothing. - We have an address.
that could be fake.
and even if it is the dead guy's address, what are the odds the courier's just gonna beconveniently waiting there?
what's your problem? - We let the courier get away...
with a virus that could kill God knows how many people.
fine. And if we went after her, the entire mall would've been infected.
Yeah, and now Sophia will get to domuch worse with it.
look, we made the right decision at the time.
Sean, no matter what happens, we've already done more than most people would've
a lot more, all right?
this is the address. Pull over.
Hi. Excuse me.
um, we're looking for a guy with long, uh, brown hair.
lo has visto? No. no?
he had a beard. Um...
okay, thanks.
hold still. Put your hands up. Put your hands up.
who are you? Why are you here?
Blake! Blake, come out here. We got company.
drop your weapon, now. - Put your gun down. Put it down!
drop it. - You drop it!
drop your weapon! - You do it first.
shut up! Put your weapon down.
wait a second. I know you.
you're one of Sophia's people.
no, not anymore. - I don't believe you.
he's telling the truth. - Who the hell are you?
he's the Director of National Intelligence.
not anymore.
and who the hell are you?
I'm Sean Walker.
from the plane...
at Coral Gables?
what are you doing here? - You first.
there was an attempted terrorist attack at a mall.
we tracked a man named Roman to this apartment.
we're the ones who stopped that attack.
what?
it was supposed to be a dry run.
Sophia's going to release a virus.
a strain that's even deadlierthan the 1918 Spanish flu.
do you have any idea where she is?
no. That's why we came here.
then we're all just wasting time.
come on, let's start looking around.
I need more data points to track how the virus is continuing to replicatewithin the culture medium.
initial indications are good.
what's her status?
her body temperature is rising, heart rate and blood pressure dropping.
we need to keep her alive and producing the virus.
increase I. V. fluids and give her a corticosteroid.
please...
please don't do this.
don't kill all those people.
if we had a choice, we wouldn't, but we don't.
we're just taking back what's rightfully ours.
your father should've told you.
we were here first.
we've determined the most efficient wayto spread the pathogen is by using three parallel distribution channels.
the first team will release the pathogenin the immediate region.
they will contaminate a food-processing facility that ships products to supermarketsin six different states.
within days, it will spread across the eastern seaboard.
the second team will contaminate currency at the bureau of engraving facility in Virginia in time for the monthly Reserve Bank distribution.
this will effectively spread the diseaseon a nationwide basis.
the third team will release the virusin the international terminal at Dulles Airport at a time that will maximize the number of global crossingsby infected passengers.
within five days, the vast majorityof the human population...
will be dead.
this is the last timethat we'll all be meeting together as a group till it's all over.
but I want each of you, in your own way, to honor a-and mourn the loss of life, but also to remember why we are doing this...
for our survival.
I want that satellite redirectedfrom its coverage zone immediately.
normally, Mr. President, a request like thiswould come from the Director of National Intelligence.
and seeing how that office is still vacant,
I'm giving you that order directly.
Yes, sir. But it is currently in a non-geostationary orbit, so the repositioning will take two hours to take effect.
understood. Thank you.
Dr. Reed, thank you for taking the time to see me.
Yes, sir.
I understand that President Martinez's healthhas taken an unexpected, but welcome, turn for the better.
I'm cautiously optimistic, although, to be frank, we're not entirely surewhat's going on.
well, tell me what you do know.
I understandthese are extreme and unusual circumstances, but still, I do have to honor doctor-patient confidentiality.
and I understand that completely, doctor, but, uh...
this is a matter of national security.
if there is a transfer of powerback to President Martinez,
I want to make that transition as smooth as possible.
you can understand.
all I can tell you is that typically, in cases of multiple strokes, the recovery takes months, sometimes years.
years?
but this case isn't typical.
what's happening here just doesn't happen, not when the patient is so far gone.
if you'll excuse me, sir. - Oh, absolutely. Thank you again.
Christina, I just got some encouraging newsfrom the doctor.
I know you poisoned him.
well, that's absolutely ridic
my husband almost died because of you!
our son almost lost his father!
I am gonna make sure I tell your wife and your children about everything
don't you touch me! Back off!
you are nothing but a coward!
look at me, Raymond. Look at me.
Mrs. Martinez.
I'm gonna bury you alive. Do you understand me?
Mrs. Martinez. - What is it?
Mrs. Martinez, the President is awake.
Oh, my God.
okay, I need a full workup.
get me a chem panel. I want an E. E.G. right away.
Mr. President.
Mr. President, are you awake? Can you hear me?
Mr. President, see if you can follow my finger.
outstanding, outstanding.
Mr. President, do you know where you are?
Mr. President.
open your eyes, sir.
outstanding, sir. Yes.
Yes.
Reactivity's good.
I want to take a look at your reflexes.
Doctor...I promise I will submit to all of your battery of tests if you just give me a moment with my wife.
well, Mr. President, please understandyou're still extremely weak.
you're very vulnerable.
you need to remain calm and at rest.
I'll keep an eye on him. - Okay.
thank you. - You bet.
Hey. - Hi.
give me another one.
I prayed for this, Elias.
I love you so much.
what happened?
not now. Mi Amor, now now, okay?
the last thing I remember...
I was telling Blakethat I saw the look in Jarvis' eye, that he had something to do with this.
Honey...tell me what you know.
tell me.
Jarvis is working with Sophia.
he poisoned you with something she gave him.
but one of Blake's agents, Simon Lee, gave me an antidote to give to you.
what about Sophia's plan to bring more of her people here?
Oh, honey, I...
Oh, honey, I've already told you what I know.
and you heard the doctor. You have to rest.
I know what the doctor said, but I need answers.
and I need...
I need to talk to Blake Sterling.
can you get him for me?
we're looking for notes, receipts, anything that might lead us to Sophia's new location.
nothing so far.
I remember you now.
you were CIA...
went rogue just as I was taking over the agency.
I don't know what you're talking about.
there was talk that you were being scapegoatedby your division chief and that eventually you ended up running freelance black ops...
doing some pretty unsavory things.
whoever you're talking about,
I don't know anybody like that...
not anymore.
do you think Leila's still alive?
she was the last time I saw her, but I don't think Michael had long to live.
what happened?
michael was shot, trying to escape with us.
Leila insisted on staying behind.
I tried to help him, but...
I'm sorry, Sean. I had to leave her.
no, no, I understand.
when this is done, I'll find her...
no matter what I have to do.
there's nothing here.
we're coming up empty.
looks like your friend didn't leave anything behind.
he's not my friend, okay?
and he must've gotten rid of anything personalwhen Sophia ordered him to go operational, which, from the looks of it, was recently.
and if he just trashed everything...
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
stop what you're doing. - What'd I do?
just back away.
I think I've got something.
all these receipts are clustered around the same areain Maryland
gas stations, hardware stores, building supply.
well, he was up to something, possibly setting up a base of operations.
Hey, some of these receipts have addresses and time stamps.
we can go into the N. S.A. satellite archive, see if we can locate him...
at those places and times.
Mr. President!
it's good to hear your voice, sir.
and yours.
Christina told me what you did.
thank you for saving my life.
and thank Agent Lee.
Blake, I need you to bring me up to speed.
what is going on with Sophia?
well, according to Agent Lee, their world is unstable, and she's intent on bringing their population here.
the entire population? - Yes.
and in order to make room for them, she intends to employ a bioweapon, a virus that they're immune to, but it would decimate the human population.
no matter what we think of Jarvis, he couldn't collaborate on the extinctionof his own people.
well, I assume he's being played for a fool.
he fired me.
what? - Yes, and he stopped all efforts to hunt down Sophia's people.
we've had to try to stop this attackwith our hands tied behind our backs.
not anymore.
Blake, you see what you can do about Sophia.
I'll deal with Jarvis.
sir. - I have to return to the White House.
here. - What?
no, sir, that's impossible.
you can't put any stresson your body until we've done some tests.
I promise you'll be released as soon as possible.
no, now.
Elias, you have to get better first.
Mr. President, you just regained consciousness.
a few hours ago, you were nearly dead.
and now I'm alive.
sir, whether you feel it or not, your body is too weak.
I am going to the White House.
ay, dios mio.
Elias-- - just get me something to wear.
check the seals and get 'em loaded on the second van.
Sophia, it's Carlos.
everyone is in position at the infection sites.
we're getting a shipment later today.
new preservative? - New formulation.
did you see this?
it says to use a new drying agent for the currency.
I am not altering protocol without an explanation.
get me Michael Doyle.
michael Doyle? The, uh, district supervisor.
a change like this has to have come from him.
confirm your status.
in place and ready.
in place and ready.
flight 794 with service to London Heathrow...
in place and ready.
it's time to begin.
N. S.A. won't let you access their Internet offsite.
but if protocols are like the Pentagon's,
I should be able to spoof the P. I.
you ever think of working for the government, Mr. Walker?
not while Vice President Jarvisis in charge.
well, we have that in common.
okay, I need an access code.
all right, they killed mine, but Chief of Staff Peel was kind enough to lend me his.
all right.
uh, there's a gas station he visited repeatedly in the vicinity of other stops he made
aberdeen, Maryland.
uh, give me the date and the time.
15th, 11: 32.
N. S.A. satellites archive imagesevery 60 seconds over major cities.
there. That's Roman.
huh.
okay, so now we track him forward in time.
back to his car.
made a few stops.
he drives under those buildings. Let's see.
Sean, go forward in time.
uh, see what else is going on at that site.
we found them.
well done, Mr. Walker.
by 5: 30, all three distribution channelswill be spreading the pathogen.
we'll have live feeds from the CDC that will allow usto follow this in real time.
what about her?
we've harvested enough viral cells from her system.
no, I mean, what about her condition?
it's unclear how long her immune systemwill be able to fight off the virus.
could be hours...Days.
she's suffering.
and it'll only get worse.
just end it.
but do it quickly and...and painlessly.
make sure those are secured. - Will do.
we're on schedule. I want to keep it that way, okay? - Got it.
okay, canisters for the first and second team are loaded and ready to go
we're waiting on your word.
we're still waiting for the onesthat we're gonna take to the airport.
you ready?
Yeah.
all right.
let's move.
okay.
let's close it up. Good luck. - Thanks. You too.
seeing as we don't know what we're walking into, is there any way you can get somebody to help us?
I put in some calls to people I trust, but it'll take time to get them activated...
time we may not have.
Yeah, we're five minutes out.
we have two spare magazines.
where did you get that?
from someone who claimed to be part of a groupthat's protected us from your people.
what did he tell you about it?
he didn't-- he didn't tell me anything.
I have no idea what it is or what it says.
do you?
if he could read it, he knew more than he was telling you.
about what?
about us...
why we're here...
and about what happened.
what do you think?
two guards by that entrance.
we need to move.
excuse me. I'm sorry.
I just-- I've run out of gas.
this is a closed area. You'll have to keep moving.- I know
there won't be any pain.
the first injection will put you to sleep, so you aren't awake for the...
effects of the second one.
don't turn around. Come on.
come on. I'm unarmed.
don't try to move.
don't try to yell for help, or we will kill you.
do you understand me?
how many people are here?
uh...
two guards upstairs... - Uh-huh?
me, and Dr. Lu.
five, if you count the prisoner.
what prisoner?
what prisoner? - A girl, a girl.
listen to me. - What?
Sophia's weapon
I know. I know about the virus.
no. They--they used me as a way to change it.
all their plans are on that laptop over there.
they're gonna release it by 5: 30.
all right, all right, I'm gonna
I'm gonna get you out of there. - No, no. You can't!
what?
I'm infected.
what? What do you mean?
they put it in me.
if you get anywhere near me, if you touch me, you'll die.
I thought I told you I didn't want to be distur
what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be resting?
get out from behind that desk and get the hell out of my office.
I have every right to be here.
the Cabinet enacted the 25th amendment.
they appointed me acting President.
I know you tried to kill me.
I don't know what you're
I know about you and Sophia.
I don't know what you've been told, but if you're talking about the peace agreement that I'm presently negotiating with Sophia...
peace agreement?- That wouldn't have been possiblewhile you were at the helm
please, Richard, help me here. - You're on your own, Raymond.
everything I've done has been to guaranteethe safety of the American people.
is that what you've been telling yourselfso you can sleep at night, Ray?
your actions have only served yourself and only you.
whether you like it or not,
I am the President of the United States.
not for long.
not for long.
well, we'll see about that, Eli.
there needs to be a vote that you're capable.
and you've had strokes...
terrible strokes.
who knows what damage has been done to your brain?
son of a bitch!
and I will demand tests, independent assessments that you're mentally sound and can be trusted.
look at you, Eli.
you can barely stand...
let alone lead this country.
no luck getting into her laptop.
they're using some kind of encryption technologyof their own.
I'll take it from here.
Thanks.
I never thought I'd see you again.
I told you the day we met,"I'll find you.
I'll always find you.
I'm glad we got to say good-bye.
no, this isn't good-bye.
Sean-- - There's a cure. There has to be.
what if there's not?
you know what? I think that, uh, we should move.
what? - You know, when this is all over,
I think we should move. Boston's too cold.
maybe-- I was thinking maybe, um, we could go to Portland or...Seattle or someplace smaller, like, um--like Bend
somewhere close to nature, and we could have a little yard.
I'd like a little yard...
a garden. - Yeah, see?
and then-- and then we can get a dog.
and it'll be great.
you're allergic to dogs.
I'd deal with it.
well, that would be really nice.
I'm not leaving you.
you have to find Sophia...
and stop her.
do it for me.
Hey, hey. Wake up.
Hey, look at me.
now, you can rationalize all you want, but deep down you know what you're doing is wrong.
according to Leila, everything we need to know is on there.
so all I need from you is your password, doctor.
that's all.
don't you see? It's too late.
it's pointless.
suit yourself.
come here. Come here!
Listen...Now, you're going to tell me what I want to know, or I'm going to cut you over and over, ever so deeply that you'll bleed to death, but that's what you'll be wishing for, 'cause I am going to cause you more pain than you ever imagined possible.
don't you see? It's too late!
the password, doctor! - Ah! Okay! Okay!
just give it to me!
okay, stop it! I'll tell you!
what is it? - Ah! B-1-1...
the number 2 in brackets...B-1-1.
it's the correct code.
that's a lot of data to sort through.
looks like multiple distribution scenarios.
asking her is a waste of time.
you sure about that?
no matter what we do to her, we won't know if she's giving us disinformation, wasting our time until it's too late to stop Sophia.
well, the answer's right here.
we're just gonna have to figure it out on our own.
Jarvis just confirmed.
the satellite's been diverted.
well, then we'll begin powering up.
where are we on the pathogen?
right on schedule. But leave that to us.
your job is to power the array.
Yes, of course.
we're ready to activate on your order.
proceed. - Proceed.
I have no idea what it says.
if he could read it, Dempsey knew more than what he was telling you about why we're here and about what happened.
our star has begun to implode.
we will bring all of our people here and make this planet our own.
she's doing what she has to to save us.
by committing genocide.
we need to make room.
the most efficient way to spread the pathogen is by using three parallel distribution channels.
within five weeks the vast majority of the human population will be dead.
I know about the virus.
they used me as a way to change it.
I'm gonna get you out of there.
you can't! - What?
I'm infected.
everything we need to know about stopping the virus is on there.
that's a lot of data to sort through.
the answer's right here.
we're just gonna have to figure it out on our own.
the President is awake.
Mr. President, open your eyes, sir.
outstanding, sir. - Yes.
I know you tried to kill me.
I am the President of the United States.
not for long.
there needs to be a vote that you're capable.
you can barely stand, let alone lead this country.
we just got word from home.
our people are ready to come.
your job is to power the array.
ready to activate on your order.
proceed.
Hey, Leila, stay with me.
you have to stay awake, okay?
sterling called a specialist at the CDC under the radar.
he said they'll be here any minute. Okay?
it's too late for me.
you have to worry about everyone else.
it's not too late.
you can't think like that.
Sean, I know what this virus does.
they said no one can survive it.
no. Simon said that his people are immune to it.
you share some of that DNA, so...
you have it within you to fight this.
Please...find Sam.
make sure she's okay.
Leila. Hey. Stay with me.
Oh, thank God.
she's dehydrated, she's very weak.
how long has she been symptomatic?
uh, I don't know, a day, maybe two or three.
put her in a suit, get her ready for transport.
we're gonna take good care of her.
we need to get her to a proper facility.
and you need to leave the area.
okay.
I'll find you, okay?
it's gonna be fine.
I'll be there. Everything's gonna be okay.
they built a model projecting the spread of the disease over the next five weeks.
running the projection backwards tells us where the attacks will originate.
by 5: 30 today the pathogen will have been released at these three locations:
a food processing plant outside of Richmond, Virginia;
the U. S. Bureau of Engraving in D. C.
; and the international terminal at Dulles Airport.
food, money, and travel.
within days it will be everywhere.
do we know what kind of delivery mechanisms they're using?
Yeah. These.
pressurized aerosol containers.
we have to assume they're either on their way or already in place at the three locations.
teams one and two are in place, prepping canisters for release, no delays or disruptions.
all right, pull over here.
is there a problem?
it'll be safer if we're stopped.
what are we doing here?
how did you know? - Gerard.
he said the portal would impact the Earth's procession, that we'd feel the effects along the 38th parallel as the time grew near.
the portal is creating a door in the fabric of space and we just cracked it open.
I know you have mixed feelings about what we're doing to the native population.
but think about the alternative.
our people are arriving soon.
I don't have the luxury of self-doubt.
we have to get this done.
a small earthquake, measuring 4. 6 on the Richter scale was felt along the East Coast today.
there have been no reports of injuries or deaths.
geologists say the tremor is of note for one very peculiar reason.
they have yet to identify any fault that would explain how the quake originated.
scientists are baffled by the swarm of similar magnitude quakes that have shaken several other areas around the globe.
it's Sterling. He's with Simon.
you're on with the President.
Mr. President, we need your help.
we've determined Sophia's releasing the virus at a food processing plant outside of Richmond, the Bureau of Engraving, and the Dulles Airport International Terminal.
my God.
we need you to dispatch counterterrorism teams to these locations immediately.
Jarvis is challenging my reinstatement.
and I am forcing a vote of the Cabinet.
I can't issue any orders until that happens.
what's the timeframe?
it'll take another hour to gather the Cabinet. Maybe two.
by then it may be too late.
we can launch contained operations at the Bureau of Engraving and the food processing plant.
and as Chief of Staff, Richard, you can send teams in via written orders from the Office of the President.
Jarvis wouldn't have to know.
no.
now, shutting down a terminal at an international airport, that's another matter.
well, we need to do something one way or another.
if Sophia succeeds in infecting passengers and they travel to other countries, there will be no way to stop the spread of this virus.
president Martinez and Peel are doing everything they can, but it looks like it may be up to us to stop Sophia's operation at the airport.
us? Four people? How are we supposed to do that?
we can call in a bomb threat.
shut the airport down that way.
even if it worked, as soon as we actually started to shut the place down
Sophia could still release the virus and infect everyone in the terminal.
our only option is to get there, stay under the radar, and try to locate Sophia ourselves.
I need to speak with you.
uh, give us a minute.
if you're trying to convince me to step down again, don't waste your breath.
it's up to the Cabinet now.
and I think we both know what they'll decide when they see the condition you're in.
Oh, forget about the vote, Ray.
all I care about is saving this country and stopping Sophia from doing something...
Sophia doesn't need to be stopped.
I negotiated a peace with her.
you need to shut down the international terminal at Dulles and send in a bio-containment team immediately.
what are you talking about? Why?
she is planning to release a deadly virus there...
so her people can take this planet for themselves.
that's ridiculous.
she wouldn't do that.
I know it's a lot for you to accept.
she's been lying to you.
that's not true.
I swear on everything I hold dear,
I am telling you the truth.
why else, on earth, would I be asking you to shut down the airport?
to make me look like a fool.
like I'm not in control of the situation with Sophia so the Cabinet will look past your medical problems and reinstate you.
I'm willing to make a deal to let you finish your term by keeping the truth of what you've done between us.
now, you do nothing,
I'll expose you to the Cabinet, tell them everything you've done.
do you really think the Cabinet would believe that I poisoned you to make a deal with Sophia?
you have no proof of what I did to you or the arrangements I made with Sophia or you would have used it.
you'll only look crazy and prove my point that you're in no shape to lead this country.
I'll see you at the vote.
Sophia. - Raymond, what is it?
Martinez just confronted me.
and he...he made accusations.
about what?
that you are about to release a virus on American soil.
when was this?
just now...is it true?
of course not.
how do I know you're not lying to me?
that you haven't been lying to me from the very beginning?
listen to me.
tomorrow there will be a new world order with your guiding hand.
you only need to hang on for one more day.
do you understand? - Yes.
you must not let anyone get in our way.
can you do that? - Yes.
I chose you because of your strength.
your power. Use it.
we may have a problem.
they know.
somehow they know.
I'll get these around security, hand them back off to you and Carlos inside the terminal.
good.
it might be better for us to stay out of sight for the exchange.
this card will get you past the security door near gate 122.
code's on the back.
go through the hallway.
we'll meet back there in time for the 5: 30 release.
no, they've found out. We can't afford to wait.
as soon as each of us has our canister in place we'll release the virus immediately.
I'm here at the base of Mt. Shasta where volcanic experts are stumped by reports of new lava flows coming from this thought-to-be-dormant volcano.
concerns of a full-scale eruption are growing among locals.
but so far, no official mention of an evacuation.
teams are on their way to two of the three sites.
but the airport is still the most lethal part of Sophia's plan.
any word from Sterling or Agent Lee?
they're on their way with two civilians who are helping them.
but even they believe the odds of success to be small.
the Cabinet has to reinstate me.
it's our only chance. - Yes, sir.
Elias. You can't do this.
you're not well enough yet.
it looks worse than it is.
you heard what the doctor said.
if you don't rest, you can...
you can die.
Freeze!
once the canisters are connected to the auxiliary well,
I can direct the control room to switch over.
how much money can we infect with the virus?
as long as the presses continue rolling...
blue team, go!
the rest of you, secure the canisters.
I see. All right.
that was Peel.
the President wasn't able to get anywhere with Jarvis.
we're on our own.
from what I saw on their laptop, an inside man is supposed to get the canisters past security for Sophia through an off-limits area near baggage claim three.
all right, Agent Lee and I will follow that route.
Sophia's supposed to meet them in the international terminal, so we'll look for her there.
baggage claim three is now loading from Bangko...
Hey, Eddie. - Will.
confiscate anything good?
Hey! You mind if I take these?
me and the wife like to keep things invigorating.
Oh, too much information. Just keep 'em.
this is your final call for Flight 308 to Amsterdam...
Yeah, just move them through.
step through.
grab your luggage and step over here, please.
is there a problem? - Random check.
I don't have any bags.
I checked everything.
on the yellow mark, please.
arms out.
not while you're being checked, ma'am.
sorry.
you're fine, ma'am - Thank you.
Hello? - They knew we were here.
they stopped us before we could release the virus.
I'm sorry, Sophia.
we were outgunned.
what about the food plant?
what about Aaron?
I haven't been able to reach him.
we got him! We got him!
it's up to you now, Sophia.
Freeze!
the attack at the Bureau of Engraving was stopped.
some of the pathogen was released at the food-processing plant, but it was contained by the biohazard team.
good. And the airport? - Nothing yet.
you okay?
sir.
baggage Claim Three is now close.
please collect unclaimed bags at the main office in Concourse Two.
I'm looking for a man with TSA credentials.
would've just passed this way.
this man is carrying a biological weapon he's going to release inside the terminal.
are you law enforcement? You have some I. D?
my name is Blake Sterling.
I'm the Director of National Intelligence.
now, answer the question.
listen... You show me some I. D. or I'm gonna have you two arrested.
count of three... did he come this way or not?
Yeah.
Yeah, Delgado came by a minute ago with a cart of stuff.
I've got a visual.
Freeze!
cover me.
the vest... took the impact.
I'll be all right.
Ah, damn it.
we had a visual on Sophia's man, but we lost him...
5'9," dark hair, tsa uniform.
we need a location.
he's headed up in the elevator to gates 120 to 140, back of house.
he has the canisters.
we need to find a way to get into the secured side.
two men right behind me...
I shot one of them. I think it was Simon.
we have to hurry.
you know where to take the canisters for maximum distribution.
what if we're challenged? - Don't wait.
open the valves. Go.
go!
I'll take him.
he's down.
Where's Sophia?
she went that way.
you go that way.
as much as I'd like to give Eli the benefit of the doubt, there have been earthquakes all across the country.
we're in crisis mode. - I understand.
ladies and gentlemen, without the attendance of President Martinez,
I have no choice but to formally withdraw his petition for reinstatement.
acting President Jarvis will continue in his role until further notice.
please advise your st...
members of the Cabinet...
Mr. Vice President...
let's begin.
I think it's safe to say that, none of us would be here today without Elias Martinez.
Elias Martinez is one of the greatest presidents of my generation.
and I look forward to the day when he is able to serve this country once again.
but today is not that day.
please refer to the dossiers that you have in front of you.
these are the current medical records of President Martinez.
as you will note on page 3, paragraph 4,
president Martinez wasn't officially cleared for discharge from Bethesda Hospital.
he simply left...
against the recommendations of his own doctors.
in fact, a team of his physicians recommended months of recuperation...
months, not days.
this is a man who suffered from bleeding on the brain and was in a vegetative state.
I know that President Martinez wants to do the right thing for his country, and so do we all.
but the medical evidence is overwhelmingly clear.
to take office now is not in the best interests of anyone, especially not himself.
I wish you a speedy recovery.
and I promise you that
I will uphold the ideals of this office until you return.
thank you very much.
the Vice President is right.
in an ideal world...
I would have more time to recover, and I wouldn't be standing here before you, but I have no choice.
I must be reinstated...
to prevent a tragedy that is unparalleled in human history, a tragedy that is born of the insecurity and the hubris of Vice President Raymond Jarvis...
a man so deluded and hungry for power that he would sell his soul and the soul of this country...
I think we can all agree that this is not the forum for name-calling.
vice President Jarvis is responsible for what happened to me.
Oh, that's insane!
everyone in this room is aware of the situation with Sophia and her people.
what you don't know is that the Vice President has been working behind the scenes with her, helping, inadvertently or not, to unleash a deadly virus that will decimate mankind.
that's insane!
he's lying!
we must act now to stop the genocide of humanity.
this is preposterous!
now, you can see how unwell this man is.
quiet!
everyone, quiet!
I begged the Vice President to shut down Dulles Airport and stop Sophia from spreading the pathogen.
this is delusional!
and he refused, because he was too proud...
no, this is... - to believe the truth...
that he was being manipulated by Sophia.
he is lying!
I am not.
and I can prove it.
these are your words, Mr. Vice President.
if you do nothing, I'll expose you to the Cabinet, tell them everything you've done.
do you really think the Cabinet would believe that I poisoned you to make a deal with Sophia?
you have no proof of what I did to you or the arrangements I made with Sophia, or you would've used it.
this...
this is...
is doctored.
this is a setup.
it is.
we are running out of time.
Madame Speaker...
we need to vote.
shutdown Dulles.
no flights in or out.
and get Armbruster and Sterling reinstated.
what about Jarvis? Who?
Sophia's locked herself inside.
Martinez did it...all the flights have been canceled.
sterling said that the other two locations have been neutralized.
Sophia can still release the virus from here.
we have to get everyone out. - We can't.
they've locked down all the exits.
Sophia, we know what you're trying to do, but it's not going to matter now.
you're the only one left.
I can see why Michael was so fond of you.
you are remarkably resourceful.
I'm sorry it has to end this way.
it doesn't have to end, Sophia.
of course it has to end.
I understand that you just wanted to help your people but your plan didn't work.
we've secured the other locations.
the virus has been contained.
if you release the virus here, all it will do is kill only the people in this terminal.
there will be no benefit to your people.
it will just be murder.
they don't deserve to die, Sophia.
did my people deserve to die?
on those buses, my son...
did my son deserve to die? - No.
no, he didn't. - No.
you don't want this. - You don't know me.
your attention, please.
Dulles International Airport is now on lockdown.
please remain calm and stay inside the terminal.
maybe I don't know you, but I do know that when we first met, you weren't like this.
you told me that you and your people came here in peace.
you remember that?
do you remember telling me that?
Yes, I...
but things...
no, things have changed.
I know. I know.
Simon told me what's happened.
that you were forced by circumstances, by...
by pain.
there's been enough pain, Sophia.
for everyone.
including you.
you can end this, Sophia.
no one else needs to get hurt.
you should know that the spread of the virus has stopped.
how?
at least in part because of someone you know.
is he okay?
Yes, he's all right.
there's something else, Leila.
something we found in your labs.
all right, your readings are coming up clean.
we'll let you know as soon as we double check the tox screen.
okay, thank you.
all right, Ms. Roberts. We're ready to scan you now.
please follow me.
this isn't over yet.
look, I don't know how, but...
as far as I know, Sophia's still bringing our people here.
Sean, what you need to know is our people were here before.
we were here first.
I don't... I don't understand.
this place was our home before it was yours.
why did you...leave?
because my people believe that if we stay here something will happen to all of us.
we call it The Event .
it's a rebirth.
the next step for our people.
we'll change.
evolve into something else.
something greater.
but your people won't survive it.
why not?
what happens?
our transportation's here.
we're needed at the White House...Now.
wait. Simon. Simon!
look, all the answers are hidden in that scroll.
about where we come from...
and about how this all ends.
Blake. - Mr. President.
it is good to see you, sir.
and you.
agent Lee.
I believe I owe you my life.
thank you.
and anything else we have to say to each other, we'll talk about later.
Yes, sir.
now, we know Sophia intends on bringing her people here.
I need to know when, how, and if we can stop it.
Sophia's still being secured and vetted, and we can't expect her to tell us anything.
what do we know?
well, I assume the portal that Thomas built is a part of how she's doing it.
but there were never more than vague rumors as to where it might be.
director Sterling told me your world is dying, and that Sophia intended on bringing your entire population here.
how many people are we talking about?
2 12 billion.
now that she's failed to make room, you sure she won't call it off?
she has no choice.
our sun is close to supernova.
the planet is being irradiated.
where does she think she's going to put 2 12 billion people?
I don't know, sir.
it doesn't seem possible to me, but it is Sophia's plan.
these rumors about the location of the portal.
how precise were they? - They weren't.
most of them had the portal located somewhere in Asia, but doesn't exactly pin it down.
it's a start. - It may be more than that.
I was going over the hourly logs across the departments.
according to the NSA, Jarvis personally ordered them to redirect the surveillance satellite that covers part of Asia...
an area in Tibet.
we've adjusted the satellite back to its default position and are receiving streaming data.
what are we looking at?
this is an area between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan plateau.
and we're picking up an area of anomalous electromagnetic radiation just south of the plateau.
stand by for that.
what is that?
that's it.
the portal array.
the electromagnetic radiation.
that means it's been activated.
what does that mean?
it means they're coming.
the Chinese premier will have it checked out, but there's no way he'd bomb it, no matter how much of the truth I told him.
you sure there's nothing else you can tell us?
about its mechanics or anything to counteract it, stop it?
no. I'm sorry. I wish I could.
what the hell is happening?
the mysterious tremors are continuing to rattle nerves around the globe, with Capetown and Sydney being the latest cities to experience the shaking.
these are just the latest in an increasingly long list of unusual happenings that have been occurring all over the world in the past 24 hours.
Sophia's a few minutes away.
a yet-to-be-identified geomagnetic phenomenon is most likely to blame.
uh, no thanks.
I-I really appreciate you waiting here with me, but you don't have to...
Mr. Walker.
sorry for the delay.
you've been cleared to see Leila in the observation area.
I will take you. - Okay.
yeah?
I didn't join this fight willingly.
and I know that...
you forcing me to is the reason why my family is safe.
and because of you, I'm no longer ashamed to face them.
thank you.
good-bye.
good-bye.
I know they're working on a way to help you.
they're trying.
but even with all the tests, they...
they still don't know much.
they'll figure it out.
I know they'll find a way to cure you.
there's something...
that I have to tell you.
what?
something that...
they did find.
what? What is it?
Leila, please.
I'm pregnant.
what?
she told me this morning, and I...
I don't know what's gonna happen.
you're... you're gonna be okay.
you're both gonna be okay.
I love you.
I love you so much.
Jim, what we're seeing here in New Orleans is really two disasters hitting at the same time...
we've identified the portal array in Tibet.
and we know it's bringing your people here.
I've told them...
everything I know about the portal.
how do we stop it, Sophia?
how do we shut it down?
you can't.
well, do you have a predetermined landing site?
you know I won't answer that.
Sophia, it's over.
you lost.
we stopped you.
you might find this hard to believe, but the truth is...
I ordered the spread of the virus as an act of mercy.
we will still need to make room for our people here one way or another.
however, now the only choice open to us will be...
far from humane.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
sorry about what?
it's too late.
what is it?
home.
you are the best sister ever on the whole planet.
elliott, I don't want to just be your girlfriend. What makes you think being your half-girlfriend - is making me any happier? - You're not hating me as much.
you've known Bella for like what, three years? - So?
I have been putting up with little man drama of her since freshman year of college, and I can't put up with it again.
my name is Bella. I think I may have found your cat.
no way.
Tommy Anzide! How are you?
what are you doing?
Tommy Anzide was like my funniest high school boyfriend.
he made peach schnapps come out of my nose twice.
remember, baby? - Fondly, my love.
come here, Rufus. Come here, baby.
leave the kitty alone.
so you really think this is your big romantic destiny - finding your junior prom date's cat?
I didn't just go to the prom with him. We dated for like three months.
I'm sorry, I'm not as familiar with your pre - college dating.
you don't think it's anything that I haven't seen or talked to this guy in like 16 years, and I just randomly find his pet?
no, I think it's something that you haven't talked to him in 16 years and you're watching his pet.
what am I supposed to do? He's out of town. Just leave it on the street?
why is the pool in front of Bella's apartment instead of ours?
there's three of us, one of her. How do we not win this?
this is Tommy Anzide.
Oh, he's cute, but I don't care what the psychic says if he still gets his hair frosted, he's not the one.
and why search for ex - boyfriends when one comes right to your house?
Hey, who's my-- oh, who's my good boy? Up! Up. Yeah.
what's up, dude?
elliott, you're half an hour early to pick up Rufus.
I'm sorry. Are you not emotionally ready for me yet today?
you don't affect me.
you seem affected. Maybe because we have joint custody of our dog, and you're robbing me of half an hour with him.
the whole reason I made a schedule is so you wouldn't just drop by.
sorry. Look, I'm just not used to things being so formal.
I promise I'll remember to sync up my calendar before I come get our dog.
whose cat is that?
a friend's. - Oh, a friend's. That' ll show me.
have a good time at the race today. I know it's a big day for you.
later. - Bye.
run for me.
entertain me while I feast.
I think I am going to do the race next time, though.
that seriously gets funnier every year.
what you you doing over there, Blondie? - Nothing.
are you Googling Tommy Anzide?
what the hell?! - Bella, it's just an Internet search...
no, no, I don't want to know. - You got this guy's number on a tree.
why are you even looking at it?
geez, what is with you people?
Bella, everybody Googles their exes.
like, occasionally when you're bored.
I guess I'm never bored.
I am.
what if I do a search for Tommy Anzide and find out he's like a professional seal clubber?
so I blow him off, and I miss whatever karmic lesson I'm supposed to have and the journey's screwed?
then he's a seal clubber - end of lesson.
you're not allowed to say "journey" anymore.
and I'm sorry, but Googling-- not romantic.
I don't want to find a soul mate the way Cyrus finds porn.
I want it to be something cool, and...What the hell, man?!
so sorry. I was aiming for the trash.
wait. Bella?
this is so bizarre.
Jack TURNER grade school - fall 1996
a breakup can penetrate a blanket, Jake. It's not like the boogeyman.
this is not a breakup.
you're so into me. - I am into you, but you promised me for like the ten-zillionth time we would go out tonight.
can't you just let me slide one more time.- Rally-- or I'm out.
come on, Bella.
come on. Come, love . you realize the instant you got me to like you, you stopped wearing pants with zippers?
seriously. - Got you to like me?
with all my magic and trickery? - Uh, yeah.
with your three and a half weeks of concerts and parties and courting, courting, courting.
and let's do this, and let's go there, and blah, blah, blah.
and now four months of couch.
it's like your mind registered affection, and your body just went,"Oh, cool, she's in," blah.
did you just call me fat?
no, I called you lazy, and a promise breaker, and now I'm breaking up with you unless you rally.
I'm just so tired.
maybe... maybe I'm going through a growth spurt.
at 23? - My family's weird.
we have to have a relationship outside this apartment, Jake.
couples are supposed to do stuff together.
we do do stuff.
having sex and watching TV doesn't count. We have to be out, like, in the world doing stuff with people.
the only reason people go out is to find someone to go home and have sex with while they watch TV.
well, I guess you need to start going out.
Bye.
wait, wait... what just happened?
a guy threw a cup at you then ran away.
I dated him 12 years ago in New York.
he looks awesome, by the way.
was that it? Am I, like, supposed to run after him?
Yeah, go. Jump right over the railing...Just a little Chariots of Fire.
make sure you scream,"Will you marry me?"
don't. You've had five sausages. You'll never catch him.
I know who I can catch.
how did you make a decision before you met me?
Oh, you mean before the dark arts sent me down the rabbit hole? Pretty easily.
I don't have time for you today. - Well, can I make an appointment?
you're having a house guest, red hair, orange hair, maybe strawberry blonde...
is it a cat? - Did I say it was a cat? If it was a cat, I would say cat.
I said guest because that's all I see.
okay, but you see how to a layman that doesn't make any sense?
no. There's an issue with the redhead in the bathroom.
and if you're not careful, you're going to see something you don't want to see.
and then there's other things, but I don't have time for that, okay?
everybody lives.
pay me $30. I can't make change.
I just... I want to know what the rules are here.
like Internet searches--yay or nay?
maybe, sometimes... it depends.
you're like a snippy Magic Eight Ball.
I told you, you already met your soul mate.
you've had a romantic relationship with him.
you have to get married within a year or you'll never marry.
how much more work you want me to do?
I'm asking for a few guidelines.
what exactly should I be doing?
am I sitting around waiting for things to hit me, or should I be actively searching for people? Seriously.
I've been looking for the one since the fifth grade.
do not let me blow this.
sometimes you have to run after them, sometimes you have to just go about your own business.
hello.
where was your extra - sisterly perception today?
I agreed to teach hip-hop, samba, funk and no one showed up.
I wound up teaching the Sparklet's guy how to Krump.
how are you not sensing my despair?
I had three mimosas, and Jake from New York threw a cup of water at me.
you promise to come to the next one? - Yes.
and Barney thinks the renovations he's doing will only take two weeks, but I'm staying with you until the wedding anyway.
Yeah, I just realized I didn't really ask you.
so wait... Jake?
like couch-sex-guy Jake?
who is now a triathlete.
whoa, he probably looks really great.
Yeah, I think he's in the front of the store scoping the succulents. - What?
if you throw that at me, I'm hitting you with a fichus.
Bella, hi.
this... this is so... not a coincidence.
um, which is both embarrassing and hysterical at the same time really.
you were gone from the restaurant by the time I finished the race.
so, yeah...I Googled you.
you have to marry within the year... - What?
or you'll spend the rest of your life alone.
when am I gonna meet him? You already have.
you had a romantic relationship with him.
do you have any idea how many men I've dated?
I've kissed a few frogs.
of my students think that the league that was formed in 1920 as a result of the Treaty of Versailles was The Justice League of America.
wow, you're a really bad teacher. The Justice League formed in what--'62?
60. The Brave and the Bold, number 28.
thanks for letting me borrow your bike.
so did this guy just open with "Let's go mountain biking," or was there a coffee-and-drinks offer on the table and you did this to yourself?
he opened with mountain biking.
aren't activity dates for when you're not sure if you like someone, and you don't want to waste the day?
Yeah, but I think he's trying to impress me.
with mountain biking? - Yeah.
Jake was like this really smart, super witty guy.
the only reason we broke up is because he got lazy-ish.
I think maybe he's trying to show that he changed, or wants to show off his new butt, which I'm also cool with.
seriously, when's the last time you went mountain biking?
exactly. My life is in a loop.
I need to mix things up. Expand my horizons.
Jake used to be conjoined to the couch and now he's running triathlons.
sorry. I didn't realize what an inspiration he'd become to you in the last 20 minutes.
who's Kara Zunder?
what you doing, babe?
nothing. Just being bored.
and how's that working out for you?
apparently, once you date me, you evaporate.
you should do an advanced search with her hometown and college.
and sometimes an image search works the best.
thank you, my love.
you were searching blogs and news, right?
I'm glad you're not threatened by this.
of course I'm not. Because I know that I'm the best person you've ever dated.
do you? - Yeah.
some people need to date a little out of their league, because they're more comfortable feeling inferior and lack the motivation, and some people like to date a little below because they need to be constantly adored.
and I assume that you are the adored one in that scenario?
Yeah.
dude, wait.
do an image search for "Tanya Behan."
hottest chick I ever dated.
first girl I got to second base with.
there's a funeral for Cheryl Behan.
Oh. Yeah. I think that's her mom.
pictured, son Michael and daughter Tanya.
Oh! That's the hot girl you got to second base with?
how many bases does she have? - No.
that's not her... is it?
can I just say I'm feeling... feeling really good about my mountain bike outing right now.
that's not her.
Whew! This is beautiful, huh?
Yeah. Be a lot prettier if I remembered my gel seat.
come on. You okay?
need me to make you some sort of rudimentary cushion out of dry brush and dirt?
please. Could you bust out that skill?
or just do that.
I don't want to wow you with all my survivalist abilities right off the bat.
I want to ease into it.
hope you're not expecting me to return the favor.
I'm wearing my least favorite sports bra.
yeah?
you know, I'm so glad you came today, 'cause it's great to hang out with a girl who does stuff.
okay, can we address the complete transformation, please?
what? - It's great to hang out with a girl who does stuff?
you wouldn't walk two floors down from your apartment to go to Ming' s Chinese with me.
well, that's just because I didn't want either of us to put our clothes on, that's all.
I'm so psyched you came!
what are you doing after this? Do you have any plans?
some of my coworkers are having this little party at the beach.
we can finish up here and head over. Should be fun.
great.
unless, of course, you need more rest. I don't know.
you want to race back down, Sparky?
down? We can finish the trail. The party's not till later.
it's probably just an hour to the top, hour and a half back down.
we've got plenty of time.
let's do it!
okay, Sparky, let's hit it!
Oh, my God!
how is this the first time that has ever happened?
okay, just so you know, the psychic totally had a vision of this, which I think should creep you out as much as it creeps me out.
you have a psychic?
Yeah. I have five minutes to take a shower and get ready, all right?
go play next door.
I can't believe the psychic saw us having sex.
we do have sex a lot. - Yeah.
do you want to not have sex till after the wedding?
no. - I'm serious.
we have sex, like, twice a day.
our honeymoon's going to suck.
it's not going to suck.
you get points for finding an ex in a news article, lose points if they involve criminal activity.
if your ex has a family page, you have to drink.
if they have a hot MySpace photo, you can make someone else drink.
you should lose points for an ex with a MySpace page.
unless they're a musician.
Yeah. You lose points for the page, but you can make someone drink if the picture's hot.
moving on. - What is this? I love it.
google Ex Smackdown.
wedding and birth announcements equal a drink.
if they have a blog, you do a shot.
if your ex is something awesome, you can make everyone do a shot.
beach party? - Pretty!
I was a little, sporty bike chick this afternoon, so I want to show some range.
so, did you have fun on your little bike ride?
I did. 4. 8 kilometers of possible soulmate bliss.
all uphill?
what? Look, I'm just concerned about poor Tommy Anzide's cat.
that means he's going to be out on the street now.
all right! We ready to start?
Yes! - Come on.
so these are all people you work with?
Yeah. Some of them.
that's my boss right over there.
not the pregnant one, as far as I know.
I didn't realize the publishing industry was so muscley.
and when did they start cloning Maria Sharapova?
who okayed that?
you know what? I think I did.
we stopped at five.
my plan is to clone five of you as well.
get you all playing basketball against each other.
nice.
Oh! Let's kick it.
tell me more about your grand schemes.
you want to toss a little 'bee?
Oh. Umm... - What?
too tired? Today a little too much for you?
I can... I can toss some 'bee, you... you freak.
I'm such a jerk. You have this beautiful dress on...
it's fine. I'm not going to ruin my dress playing Frisbee.
yeah? You're the coolest girl ever.
everybody, check it out. We need six more for Ultimate Frisbee. Who's in?
ultimate Frisbee?
Yeah. You've played before, right? It's kind of like football.
all right. Here we go!
go, do a shot.
I can't believe he's a NASCAR driver.
I thought they were supposed to be smallish.
you know, this game kind of sucks when you don't get to drink ever.
really, it's so much more fun when your girlfriend's dated a pro hockey player and a robotics engineer for frickin' NASA.
Marty, you.
dude, we've been dating for 13 years.
we ran out of exes two hours ago.
Augie, can I be on your team? I want to get a buzz.
she was like Miss Kentucky or Miss Kansas.
gorgeous, smart...
keep talking, drunkie. - You afraid to even it up?
I have an ex with a little bit of pedigree.
and an eBay store that sells collectible porcelain dolls.
there's a photo.
VIVIAN: Oh, she's really pretty.
I love that her doll is wearing the same dress.
whenever I meet a guy's boss, - I like to brain him with a Frisbee. - Yeah?
sets a nice tone.
you know what, it does.
Hey, sorry about your dress.
once again, my mad skills are too much for the spaghetti strap to handle.
okay, how are you so strong and so tiny?
I'm not.
I am putting you in my pocket.
well, put me in soon, dude.
cause I'm mooning San Diego.
you want to get together tomorrow?
I'd love to.
you should come sea kayaking with me.
it'd be great. Do it early in the morning before work.
dawn patrol.
Seriously?
all right.
you would have kicked ass at this game.
do you know how many points you would have gotten for Elliott?
we found this really hot picture of him in his veterinary clinic...
Daph, I love you. Shut up.
but It's pre-wedding slumber party weeks.
I'm exhausted, and I have a sea kayaking date at 5: 30 in the morning.
you have a sea kayaking plan.
the only date activity at 5: 30 in the morning is the walk of shame.
it's a date.
Oh, my God!
me and Marty are celibate.
we made a cute little pact.
so our honeymoon will be special. Isn't that like the sweetest? - Shh.
sleepy time. - Okay.
I hate Tommy Anzide.
I'm sorry.
this is someone's little pet.
what if Rufus was missing?
you'd be searching with the National Guard. - moo
you need to go to the other side of the street.
but it's... - Other side of the street.
moo
what the hell are you doing?
sorry.
shut up!
sorry to bother you, sunshine, but my friend's cat got lost.
are...?
Oh. Hi. Sorry.
I'm... I'm, like, cat-sitting, and the cat got out. It got out.
you know, I'm sure it's around somewhere. Do you want help looking?
um... Hello.
cat whisperer.
great! Great.
okay, thanks. Bye.
I guess the cat is the guest redhead because that's something I really didn't want to see.
she had, like, no ass.
none. Flat. Flat, flat.
he had to have Rufus there.
it was 4: 00 in the morning.
or he got so swept up with the blonde, that poor Rufus is home peeing on his chair.
how well am I handling this? - You are handling this really well.
it might just be that I'm so exhausted, I don't care about anything.
maybe me and Elliott are both moving on.
and in the morning, you get to go on your sea kayaking date.
one, two, three, up!
Yeah, it's great to have someone to do stuff with.
my ex-girlfriend wasn't up for anything other than dinner and a movie.
which, yes, I realize is karmic payback.
good thing you owned up to that, man.
so how do you like your job?
what?
your job? - Oh, it's great.
so how's your family doing?
your little brother probably in college by now? Jake?
yeah? What?
okay, Marty won't break the celibacy pact, and I am so over it.
everything but is exhausting. I don't know how virgins do it.
you are seeing this as a problem, right?
just a little sore. I can deal.
I'm so not this girl, but he needs to buy you dinner.
the whole problem in the past is that he didn't want to do things together.
I can't now, you know, start complaining because he wants to do things.
Yes, you can. - What's up?
Hey, what's the name of the girl I went out with sophomore year?
the one that looked like that chick that sang that crappy song about being on the floor?
dude, that girl so didn't look like Natalie Imbruglia.
she was a poor man's Phoebe Cates at best.
whatever. What was her name?
I'm hanging up on you.
and I love that you're just freely running the bases at my apartment.
someone needs to. All your dates end up with you home alone with an ice pack.
it's so weird.
I feel like he likes me. I mean...Piper Stevens.
it's like he's always inviting me to do stuff, and he's being all flirty and touchy.
he never stops moving, never.
it's like dating the bus from speed.
maybe he just wants to be friends.
or maybe he's just trying to kill you.
just ask him what his deal is.
and stop being a wuss.
okay, that's exactly it. Now use your leg muscles.
see? I knew you'd be great at this.
so, next time we go out, we need to go get fish tacos or go to a bar or something.
how about tonight? I get together with some co-workers at this bar once a week.
I've never brought a date, but I think it'll be okay.
the place is a little loungey, but it's cool.
I'm fine with loungey.
you better not be having sex 'cause I need the shower!
I'm not!
Oh! Moo! - Rufus, stay. Stay.
what the heck is wrong with you?
everything. I can't bend, I can't reach.
I think I pulled an ass muscle.
Oh，yeah.
you want him in the bathroom?
no, no. Bedroom.
please.
is it, uh, a bad time?
well, you're 15 minutes early, so kind of.
Hi. How' d you get cuter?
what's up with all the bruises?
and that flapping Band-Aid?
ultimate Frisbee injury. Okay, handoff completed. Peace out.
are we cool?
Yeah. What? What?
I'm seeing someone else, so I'm not seeing her.
uh! We're not in this place we're in the dropping- off-the-dog and-don't-tell-me-anything place.
you should get some flexible Band-Aids.
for the joint. Keep it covered or it's never gonna heal.
Hi, can I get a tequila straight up with salt, please?
two. - Be right back.
what?
nothing. I'm glad to see you still drink tequila.
I always loved that.
there's something about it that's so Bella to me.
so what's up with you?
spill. How are you?
how have you been? What's going on?
there he is. - Bringing in the win.
you ready, man?
am I ready? - Ready for what?
okay, triviologists, are you ready?!
like to welcome you all out to our favorite night of the week: Trivia Olympics!
first question...
you guys do this every week? - Yeah, I figured you'd kick ass at this.
what two nights of the year are there no professional sports scheduled?
yellow team?
the night before and after the baseball all-star game.
home run!
next question: What two male actors won Oscars for playing the same character?
I know.
yellow team. - Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro as Vito Corleone.
Yeah, baby! Whoo! Oh, yeah, baby! In your face, Washington Mutual!
your boss really likes her trivia, huh? - We all do.
next question. For all you nature lovers, what is world's largest flower?
Bella's got it. Bella's got it.
what? Oh. Oh! Um, okay,
I think I totally know this.
it's, um, it's got the articulated stem.
the world's largest flower. The world's largest flower.
um... Ah! The titan arum?
correct!
wow, that's so weird.
we've been playing Trivia Olympics for, like, three years and it's never gone to double overtime.
I didn't even know there was an overtime.
that is weird.
so, it's supposed to be pretty windy tomorrow.
do you want to take a parasail?
dude, what's the deal? - What?
with the constant activities? It's like being at camp without the kissing and alcohol.
are we like action buddies or something? You just want to be friends?
sorry.
Oh, sorry!
Oh, you know what? My arm really can't...
okay. That all right?
seriously, can we just leave it on? - Yeah.
Bella? Bella? I think there's something blocking the door.
come back later!
so, I guess I have to hang out here with you guys, because my sister is a tramp.
I think you have, like, a Google problem.
you need to stop.
I am. I've done everyone but the big ex. I'm saving the best for last.
and there's an Amazon link! Score! She wrote a book. Shot. Go.
dude, what's the book.
I Stop Dating Losers.
wow, five stars and 270 customer reviews?
Yeah, do a shot for that.
look at us just sitting here eating cereal, staring at the wall.
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
I think so.
you haven't fed me, by the way.
what?
there's been no eating.
you're a whirling dervish. There's no time for snacks.
you know, let's not go climbing tomorrow.
I'll take you out to lunch.
mm, it's all part of your elaborate plan, right?
date me for five months, wait 12 years and get me all love drunk, on some sex and move right in for the lunch?
Hello?
where' d you go? What's going on in there, Thinking Man?
nothing.
Yeah, I just, um... nothing.
it's nothing.
look, it's just you're the first person I've been with since my ex.
and I was feeling a little ...
I don't know, it just came into my head.
that's cool.
like after though, right?
Yeah. Yeah, of course, definitely.
I just ruined everything, didn't I? - No. No.
whatever, you know...
Yeah.
whatever. Exactly.
see, that's why you're so awesome, okay?
you're just cool.
you know, my ex would've lost her mind if I said something like that to her and she then would've grilled me just to get to it.
it would be hours and hours of interrogation and I'd say one tiny thing and she'd just... You know, and she'd always act like we were so tight nothing could ever faze her, and then she'd just flip out for no reason. Literally, no reason.
what are you gonna do?
you can't just love away insecurity.
do you ask what he's thinking? - Because I wanted to know.
well, now you do.
this one's way too orange. He talked about her all night, all night.
it was like listening to a biography on tape that you couldn't shut off.
yet you could've shut it off at any time.
by the time I went from confused to stunned to completely uncomfortable, I was already imbedded.
there really wasn't even a break. He just went on, and on, and on...
Really? What's that like?
until you have to read about your girlfriend's-- and I kid you not
Vaccine-inventing former Navy Seal, I've got no sympathy for you.
she has a tag-line.
you should sue her.
maybe the book isn't about you, Cyrus.
Yeah. No. Honestly, what are the chances are you're the only loser she's ever dated?
you should get a copy of that for Bella.
you need to cross this guy off the list.
I'm not crossing him off anything.
I've been having fun with him. He's exciting.
everything was fine when we were doing stuff. Like, the second we stopped moving, he started talking.
so staple him to a treadmill, live happily ever after.
there's a germ of good in that idea.
take advantage of that guilt trip.
I was all ready to buy you a seven-course lunch.
I had energy to burn today.
Ow! How did I break a nail?
I cut them down to nubs.
see? That's why Celeste wouldn't go climbing.
she didn't want to cut her nails.
Celeste hated camping, too.
so, listen.
I was thinking about going camping next weekend.
do a little hiking, some climbing for real.
you bragging, or is that an invitation?
no. I know this great spot north of Big Bear.
Celeste's family had a house there, so we used to go a lot. - Jake, more climbing, less Celeste.
what?
you're been talking about her a lot.
I mention her as a point of reference.
okay. I get it.
I just don't need the reference.
I wasn't reminiscing, okay?
I mentioned her because it was lame to go to Big Bear with her.
she didn't want to do anything.
you need to understand it's just conversation, Bella.
I understand. It's just it's the same conversation.
we've been having Celeste for two days now.
are you gonna get all crazy about other women, too?
okay, you know, you being rude doesn't mean I'm being crazy.
how am I being rude?
talking about your ex, like, three seconds after having sex is rude.
first of all, I've been nothing but nice to you.
it's inarguably rude. - I've given you compliments,
I've invited you places. I've seen you around the clock for, - like, a week straight. - It doesn't matter that you've seen me, Jake.
what does it matter how much you're seen me when all you do is talk about your ex-girlfriend every two minutes?
seriously, every two minutes?
you don't think you've mentioned her a lot?
every two minutes?
I love that you told someone off while wearing a harness.
how often does that get to happen?
I'm not supposed to listen to that, right?
of course not. - Doesn't make me insecure, or a bad friend because I don't want to hear about his ex-girlfriend all the time.
the most secure, best friend in the world would at the very least be bored by it.
there was, like, potential there, you know? Like, this thing.
this... this... this chemistry.
Bella, he's really hot.
it's not that.
we always had this good... this good banter.
we get each other.
well, I'm gonna go help Cyrus with, you know, that thing.
whatever. Bye. - Bye.
what's the occasion?
I'm a jackass.
how much did you want to spend?
Wow. You are a jackass.
okay, so do you want to hear about how right you are or about how sorry I am?
that's not really what it's about, Jake.
then what's it about?
I thought something was starting to happen between us. You're not over your ex.
I am.
look, look, I am.
okay, I just... I never dealt with the breakup.
the day after she dumped me, I started training for the triathlon.
yesterday was really the first time I actually stopped and thought, and just sat with it.
I... I feel like this is some fated do-over or something.
I'm all out of jackass cards.
you might want to use a "With Sympathy."
I'm cutting Celeste completely out of my life.
okay? I'm moving on.
one more chance.
that's all I'm asking for.
I'm gonna confess, I read a half a box of Trivial Pursuit cards today.
Aw, that's fine.
Hello, Jake.
Celeste, I don't think we should be seeing so much of each other.
there's just really not a place for you in my life anymore.
I quit.
Hey, Jake. Hello.
Oh, sorry. Sorry. I just really wanted to get out of there before it hit the fan.
the ex-girlfriend that you've been talking nonstop is your boss?
was my boss.
I... I already feel better.
you were right. I mean, I... I feel free, you know?
all this talking about Celeste, and you couldn't mention that we were hanging out with her?
I didn't want it to be weird for you.
I hit her in the head with a Frisbee.
don't worry about that. She knew you had no idea who she was.
Oh. Oh, okay. I feel much better knowing you had conversation with her about it.
Bella, she so doesn't matter.
do you really, honestly think for a second you're over this woman?
Yeah. Totally.
so you wouldn't mind if, like, she was dating someone?
no.
is she? - Oh, my God!
no, seriously, did she say something to you?
Jake, as a person who cares for you it's time to wake up and smell the crazy.
look, I just ended something recently and it sucks.
and you think you're never going to get over it, and then you do, and then you strangely miss feeling bad about it, and then it kind of starts all over again.
but my point is, there's a process.
and you can't outrun it.
believe me, I tried.
so, like, friends with benefits or just friends?
just friends.
don't you already have enough of those?
I mean, maybe he'll get over her quickly.
did you tell him you're on a tight cosmic schedule?
Yeah, I said,"By all means-- even if you're completely not ready to be in a relationship come sniffing around my tree again."
I'm just saying, tick tock.
Yeah, well, psychic prediction or not, I'm still a romantic. The right guy's the right guy.
sorry, I've been trying to call you for an hour.
Oh, my cell phone was turned off.
I have to fill in at the clinic overnight; I need you to take Rufus.
look, I know it's not on the schedule, but it's an emergency.
of course, it's fine.
I don't know what the rules are anymore.
it's not like we can't help each other out.
good.
even if it's not about Rufus.
Yeah, when's it ever not about Rufus?
go take care of the clinic.
here.
I'm excited.
we get to go back to mocking Tommy Anzide. I hope he still has that little dangling cross earring.
well, if he doesn't maybe he can borrow that AHNK necklace of yours from freshman year in college.
Hey! Excuse me?
was there a pact breaking?
Yes. But Marty was very good. He lasted four whole days.
I would've broke in 45 minutes, but she made me swear on my mother.
Aw, you're cute.
Hey! How was the book signing?
did you call her out?
show her who's boss? Give her what for?
Syrus, this book is not about you.
she spelled your name wrong. - I know.
dumb as a box of hair. I don't know how I ever dated her.
how did you not see me spray that guy?
because I was out there surfing, not just watching you.
that's what you were doing?
as opposed to yousitting here on the sand watching your girlfriend read.
bikini and eyeglasses, man.
that's all I'm saying.
you totally saw me, Cyrus.
why are you all in love with yourself?
what if you French-kiss that guy in the seventh gradeand now you just pissed off "the one.
the one wouldn't drop in on me like that.
heads up.
I think those punksare looking to roll us for some milk money.
Hello, Dylan. Hello, Jack.
Hi, Miss Piatt. -Hi, Miss Piatt.
I'm guessing you've finished your papers on Joseph Stalin.
what?
Yeah, those kids are ruined.
poor students. World War II is gonna be one big masturbatory blur.
that's not true.
sweetie, you're a hot teacher.
to 150 pounds of puberty, your class is a Van Halen video.
so, you guys want to get goingor you want to stay here while Bella scans the shoreline for exes?
cat, you are a guest.
guests do not pee on my basil...
or cut my screen.
and take my iPod.
Oh, man!
you guys have an apartmentfull of electronics, and someone does a slash-and-grab here.
they actually stole my face scrub.
like the street value on that is so high.
I'm surprised Rufushere didn't try to scare them off.
by running over with a squeaky toy and wagging his tail?
you're lucky you're cute, dog.
I blame the psychic.
when something like this is coming up, she should call you.
knock, knock.
somebody call about a robbery?
are you freaking kidding me?
Hello, Bloom.
come on, Bloom.
what if Guy Riccarditried to get to second base with me?
or third? -Third?
Sophmore Year-Ronnie Helton
you'd slap him in the face.
but what would you do?
first, I'd light that stupid boat of his on fire.
then I'd kick his ass.
I'd probably beat his up brother, too.
dad, what are you doing here?
what am I doing here?
I want you in the car.
I don't know.
I was always taughtto stay out of the cars of strangers.
listen, you littledirtbag...
dad! Leave him alone!
he isn't a dirtbag.
he's gonna build desert race carsand we're moving to Barstow.
I love him.
in. The car.
call me tomorrow, Ronny.
don't bother.
she's going to her grandmother'sfor the summer.
what do you want me to do, cry about it?
see ya, Bloom.
don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I love you, Ronny.
call me!
you're seriously a cop?
no, I'm trick or treating.
so?
there was a robbery?
Yeah, um...
I came back from surfingand, um, I found all this.
they cut through the screen.
one of you guys the boyfriend?
no.
what? No...
I don't have a boyfriend. Right now.
what about an ex?
those she has.
you guys can go. Thanks.
I'm good. -No, you guys can go. Thanks.
any one ex in particular might be a little disgruntled, might want to steal his iPod back?
I don't really date thieves.
any disgruntled neighbors?
well, the landlord raised the rent a hundred bucks a month, so, yeah.
but none them are mad at me.
so, what'd they take?
my iPod, a watch that my dad gave me...
um, some facial scrub...
I'm not married. -What?
you just checked my left hand for a ring.
no, I didn't.
you just checkedmy left hand for a ring.
I'm not a ring finger checker.
well, you were four seconds ago.
I'm checking to make sureyou were writing everything down.
ipod, watch, facial scrub.
good.
so, what else?
two bottles of wine.
so, iPod, watch, facial scrub and wine.
well, it's not like they asked meto put all my cool stuff in a pile.
they reached through the kitchen window.
just checking the facts here, Bloom.
so, you going to age at allor you just going to look 16 forever?
Ah, it's the wife.
I got to get going.
officer Landis will finish up here.
I thoughtyou weren't married.
the wife is what we callthe captain.
cop humor.
if there's another problem, let me know.
it's good to see you, Bloom.
don't do anything I wouldn't do.
you have to marry within the year... -What?
or you'll spend the rest of your life alone.
when am I gonna meet him?
you already have.
you had a romantic relationship with him.
do you have any idea how many men I've dated?
I've kissed a few frogs.
so, wait, the bad kid in your school grew up and became a cop?
I can't even process that.
seriously, you should dig your hooks into this guy.
he sounds like a real trailblazer.
Ronny Helton being a cop is unfathomable.
I'm telling you, the minute he walked through that door wearing that uniform,
I swear I thought he was goingto bust out a boom box and start stripping.
and there's the nameof my new stripper business: Protect and Swerve.
so this is your rent money-making plan.
male strippers.
Oh, man, he still wrecks me.
I can't believe he didn't ask me out.
he was all business, and then he'd sneak in a lineof flirting.
it'd take me, like, five seconds to register.
what is that?
boring.
you know, the sooner I find the right ex, the sooner you don't have to hear about this anymore, so get going with the insight.
okay, tell him about the psychic.
you know how cops love crazy.
is that a cupcake or a muffin?
cupcake.
sweet.
potentially the new logo for Cathy's Cupcake Counter.
why don't we just keep talking about your love life?
cause this doesn't suck enough.
you really...
see yourself winding up with a cop?
now I do.
one minute.
okay?
Hey, hey, hey, Ike.
how you doing?
Hey, cutie, what's up?
can you clear out the parking lot? I have a delivery.
what?
can you clear out the lot?
I have a delivery.
Yeah, give me about 20 minutes.
see, the tru's out there waiting, and this is my parking lot.
I just got a shipment in.
I got to move some stuff around.
you're gettingthat your shipment is in my lot, right?
give me ten minutes, cutie.
ten minutes.
Bella: Hey, hey!
hold up!
come on!
biker Ike is starting to drive me insane.
what happened to him being scraggly and sweetand overaccommodating?
Yeah, that sucks. So tell me about Ronny.
how did he look?
like he did in high school, but taller and hotterwith bigger muscles and more magnetism.
I loved when you dated him.
that was my golden periodof being good daughter.
I got three "D"s on my report cardand Daddy bought me jeans.
he bought you jeans?
Yeah, and he took me and Kara Tanner to an Amy Grant concert.
so when are you going to call him?
Jimmy: Hey, girls.
Hi, Dad.
Bella got robbed.
guess who was the cop. -Are you kidding?
you got robbed?
are you okay, Belly?
it's not a big deal. -She's fine.
seriously, guess who was the cop.
they didn't evenget inside. It was...
they cut through the screen.
What'd I tell you about keeping the windows open?
remember the hooligan you hated, hated, hated?
isn't that hilarious?
he was the copor he was the one who broke in?
he was the cop, Dad.
don't you need to read and write for that?
Really? 16 years later?
talk to me in 16 more.
I'll feel the same.
it slipped out.
it was an accident.
seriously, you should call Ronny immediately.
you think?
I'm not getting that my happinessis your endgame right now.
we can both be happy.
I'm not calling him...
yet.
I don't want to seem desperate.
I have a plan.
Bella, can you try to look casual, please?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm a grown woman, walking the streets, scoping out cop spots, hoping to accidentally-on-purposebump into a guy I dated 16 years ago.
because a fortune - teller told youyou're destined to marry an ex.
stop being so hard on yourself. -I feel like I'm 13 years old right now.
I should be wearing Candies and a tube top.
Yeah, I told you to go home and change.
okay, all right.
look.
he's not there.
all right, lunch hour's almost over.
let's keep moving.
how is it you're so in on the cop hangouts, by the way?
I might have accidentally driven on a suspended licensefor, like, a year and had to avoid them.
Oh, oh, wait, do...
no, don't look. -I'm not.
don't look...
I can't believe you just did that. -What?
you just ruined...you just looked right at him.
it's cool. We're fine.
we're just here for...
sausage.
what?
Hey. Ronny.
this is so weird. -Yeah.
I haven't seen you here before.
I haven't seenyou here before.
we come here all the time.
my sister is a big sausage fan.
so, you guys all worktogether, huh?
that's cool.
glad to see you're pounding the streets for my stuff.
we got a lead on the scrub and the wine.
got our best man on it.
you're not the best man?
depends who you ask.
is that La Rue?
I'll call it in. -Don't bother.
is it wrong that watching Ronny kick someone's assis like porn to me?
No!
I saw him do that to Andy Flanaganin the IHOP parking lot.
this time's better.
Daph, what are you doing?
Hi.
my sister really likes your partner.
I thinkyour next move should be the prank phone call.
you know, play your favorite song, hang up...
Thanks.
glad you're enjoying this.
relax, Bella. He's going to call.
he's just doing the guy thing.
the longer he waits, the hotter he gets.
please.
by tomorrow night, he's going to be Steve McQueen.
should I point out that you called me five minutesafter I gave you my number?
you just did, my love.
how's it going?
your students reallysuck at fake-playing volleyball.
why do they have to play here?
cause it's, like, 20 away from their hot history teacher in a bikini.
it's my day off.
the only adolescents I should haveto deal with are you guys.
hello.
RONNY: I was going to try and meet up at your locker between classes, but I thought this might be quicker.
who is this?
officer Ronny Helton.
I happen to be in your neighborhood.
I feel so safe.
I thought I might swing by and take you out for a bite.
I hear you like sausage.
great.
see you in a few.
in the neighborhood and in my courtyardare two very different...
Hey, Belly. I want to put in a new lock.
only take a minute.
be you should do this later.
like, when the sun goes down and it's not so hot.
I'm fine.
what are you worried about?
Hey, Cyrus.
this is my Pavlovian responseto seeing you with a tool box.
I've trained you well.
you know, you guys ought to thinkabout changing the locks next door, too.
this is the best one out there.
you'd needa stick of dynamite to crack it.
it ain't cheap though.
between the lock and the alarm,
I betthe salesmen in this place make a killing.
you think so? -People spend money on safety.
at least, their fathers do.
Really?
police Officer Ronny Helton.
you remember my dad?
Mr. Bloom.
a new lock.
that's good.
gotta look out for my little girl.
so, Ronny's a police officer.
I got that.
shoot anybody yet?
only people that deserve it.
damn.
I got to take this, Bella.
good seeing youagain, Ronny.
good seeing you, Mr. Bloom.
dad? -What?
said he had to go.
high school was 17 years ago.
you don't think maybe it's possible he's changed?
no.
guys like that never change.
these locks are shot.
I'm gonna have to replace them, too.
great. In the meantime, I would feel better staying hereuntil it's done.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Hello?
nothing like a little late-night baba ghanoushto make a girl feel sexy.
well, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
and thanks for finding my watch.
luckily, I know where the scumbagssell their stolen goods.
most of the merchantsare old high school friends of mine.
see, all those years of hanging outwith soccer players and the band got me nothing.
this neighborhood used to be pretty nice, but now it's...
Hey, this is my stomping ground.
I stomp here.
Yeah.
see that day care center, Little Sea Sprites?
they make book in the back.
and the owner of that pizza jointspecializes in counterfeit green cards.
and delicious garlic knots.
Yeah, there's all kinds of hustlersaround here these days.
what about this place?
readings by Marina.
a psychic?
more like a con artist.
she sells knockoffs.
purses, briefcases, shoes.
no telling how many people she's scammed.
what?
you didn't buy anything there, did you?
me? No.
feeling nostalgic, Bloom?
you've taken me to our make-out spot.
romantic and presumptuous. Very Ronny Helton.
: okay, folks, we're not writing up any tickets, but let's stop steaming up windows and get home.
I know I was a bad kid.
not bad.
badass.
right, yeah.
it's funny now how typical it was.
parents get divorced.
kid acts like a punk.
not a total punk.
you sure about that?
well, you definitely weren't typical.
that's what I like about you, Bloom.
you always made me feel like I wasn't.
pretty much exactly the way you made me feel.
everything okay? -It's fine.
maybe you should answer it.
Hello?
Yes, uh, no, I'm fine.
Yeah, I understand that you're concerned.
no, I'm not drunk.
I don't know...
no, I'm notcoming home right now, and...
and I'll see you in the morning. Okay?
he's a good man, that Jimmy Bloom.
he sure is.
Ah, crap.
sorry.
I'm kind of still on duty.
like now?
Yeah.
Oh, I'm...I...
I didn't know.
if you're free tomorrow, maybe we can have a real date.
so, great kisser, good kisser, or "what is he doing with his tongue" kisser?
great.
was Dad up when you got home?
I thought he was gonna smell my breath for alcohol.
okay, I get a psychic not having a machine, but then, they should know when you're gonna call, right?
dude, what's wrong?
Ronny told me Marinais a con artist.
she sells knockoff purses.
so?
so, I wouldn't even be dating himif she hadn't told me to reconnect with my exes.
but you like Ronny, right?
Yeah, I do, but I'm notinto taking love advice from a knockoff purse fence.
but you said Marina's been right a bunch of times.
con artists usually are.
in the beginning, anyway.
Hey, don't overthink this, okay?
either Ronny's cooland a great kisser or he's not.
driving home last night, he turned the siren on and went really fast.
it was kind of hot.
very hot.
did you join a softball team or something?
jk Security-- we make you feel better about being alone.
I'm selling alarm systems.
what? You? Why?
I feel it's my moral dutyto inform our neighbors about Bella's horrific break-in and give them the opportunity to buy an alarm systemfor $900, of which I receive $200.
off to make some money.
the world is full of scammers.
Hey, there. Uh, I'm...
I'm not really interested.
not interested in safety? In clarity of mind?
clarity of what?
are you aware that two days ago, there was a violent home invasionbarely 20 yards from here?
here? - She came home from a morning surf, opened her door and was attackedby three vicious assailants.
tied up, held at gunpoint. If she had a security system, this tragedy never would have happened.
I know this neighborhood seems idyllic, but, um, it's a jungle out here.
Hello?
Hello?
anybody home?
can I help you?
your...
your door was open. - Which is an invitation to snoop?
no, no, it was...it was unlocked in this neighborhood.
I know all the right people. Nobody steals from me.
right people? Like who?
the mayor.
you're tense, even for you.
I've been tryingto get a hold of you. You should be on call like a doctor.
I wish I was like a doctor, too.
I would hang my diploma on the wall and make more money.
you should hang something on the wall. Like a...
like a business license or a psychic degree, a certificate of accurate love prophesies.
Yes, yes. It would clash with my decor.
what were you looking for?
you. I need a reading.
not today. Call for an appointment.
why not today? - Everything is fuzzy.
fuzzy? - Yes, fuzzy.
you know how sometimes in baseballpitchers-- they don't have their stuff?
well, right now I don't have my stuff. It's no biggie.
I'm not a big baseball fan.
my psychic ability comes and goes.
right now it's weak. - Really?
your concern for me is touching, but don't worry, it always comes back.
what's the big emergency?
I'm dating an ex...
and I like him.
this is a problem. - My father can't stand him.
is it possible that the "one"could be someone my father hates?
and the answer is in that box?
if I try, will you leave? - Yes.
I see a wave. - A wave?
we live on the beach. There's waves everywhere.
that's what I saw. - Was I riding it? Did I fall?
relax. You weren't on it. It was in the city.
well, a tsunami is relaxing.
I saw a wave...
in the city. And your friend is involved too--the ex.
but like I said, I'm hungry and fuzzy. Please go.
in 1940, the tripartite pacts between Japan, Italy and Germanyformalized its Axis powers partnership as a warningto the United States to remain neutral in World War II.
or be involved in the waron two fronts.
they recognized each other's sphere of interest.
excuse me?
nothing. I just, um...
can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah.
inappropriate behavior?
I would like to report that Ms. Piatt has been engaging
it is appalling and needs to be stopped.
that's preposterous.
so there's no truth to this? - None.
except for the part about wearing a bikini, and I have seen some students on the beach.
but I certainly didn't flirt with them.
while wearing a revealing bikini?
what are you suggesting?
I'm simply trying to gather the facts, Vivian.
as you might imagine in today's climatethe mere suggestion of improprietyneeds to be investigated.
well, I can't control what other people suggest.
but if you are suggesting that I shouldn't wear a bikinito my beach on my days off, then I think we have a problem.
as I said, I am simply trying to gather the facts.
who wrote the note?
it was signed, "A male student in Ms. Piatt's class.
so a male student wrote you a notecomplaining that I was wearing a revealing bikini?
does that sound right to you?
you dudes feel like making the easiest 50 bucks of your lives?
wow, wine.
a wonderful California Pinotfrom the Russian River Valley.
I didn't realize you two were so sophisticated. I guess the baby pool threw me off.
big date with the fuzz?
he's taking me to a party. - A cop party?
like lawn chairs, beer guts, people talking about pensions?
there's nothing wrong with the simple life of a public servant.
of course not. - It's romantic.
owning a small slice of the American dream.
a small house manicured, a ridiculously green lawn, a vegetable garden--tomatoes, zucchini, a little mint.
you know, you could have that without the cop part.
I have no commentsince I can no longer connect with the middle class given my recent success.
have fun with the proletariat.
what's the matter?
this stuff's good.
when you work hard, it's nice to share the spoils with your friends.
I got to hand it to you.
I can't believe people actually bought something from you.
I made 400 bucks in an hour today.
I guess you have talents I have never seen.
that, and I paid two degenerates 50 bucks to skulk back and forthin front of houses before I rang the doorbell.
nothing closes a sale faster than the sight of a homeless guysmoking a joint and sipping a 40.
cheers to that, bro.
wait...I thought we were going to a barbecue.
we are...
in Palm Springs.
are we...We're getting there on that?
Yeah, unless you want to bike it.
I'm assuming it's not yours.
no, it's my buddy Dale's.
he's this big hedge fund mucky-muck.
how do you know him?
mutual friends. I did him a favor once.
that must have been some favor.
what?
it's like, I'm worried about my rent going up, and this guy's jetting to barbecues.
Yeah, life's kind of funny that way, huh?
but don't worry about that rent thing.
I talked to your landlord the other day. I told him the place wasn't fire-safe.
what's not safe about it?
nothing.
I just said, you know, maybe now is not the best timeto be raising the rent.
and he agreed? - 100%.
that's awesome! Thank you.
this is not a service that every taxpayer gets. Only the cute ones.
evening, guv'nor.
are you just getting home? Or you just really like that outfit?
both.
wow, you're officially a badge bunny.
must have been some party. - Oh, you mean the party in...
palm Springs?
you drove all the way to Palm Springs just to eat hot dogs and coleslaw?
drove? No. We took his friend's turboprop.
you heard me. - He's got a friend with a private plane?
I know, it's totally bizarre.
I think I love Ronny, too.
you're going to love him even more when you hear this. He convinced the landlord to somehownot raise the rent.
he found some fire code violations or something.
nice. - So he found code violations and then, what?
Just...called the landlordand said, "Don't raise the rent"?
I didn't cross-examine him, Augie. I just said thanks.
Aw, these idiots are late again.
what idiots?
never do business with homeless drug addicts.
I don't care what anybody says.
this isn't working, you know.
we should try seeing other people.
Hey.
class started five minutes ago.
you all right, Mila?
uh, hold on a second.
I want to talk to you.
you wrote a note to Mr. Howe, didn't you?
Yes. I'm sorry.
it's Dylan. Ever since he saw you at the beach, he's like, in love with you.
well, uh...no, he's not.
he doesn't look at me the way he looks at you.
well...
that's his problem.
don't you think?
there is absolutely nothing wrong with you.
there isn't.
you're a beautiful girl.
and I know whatever he said must have hurt your feelings.
but that doesn't mean you get to lie.
I know. I'm sorry.
we're on the same team here. Got to stick together.
respect the sisterhood.
I guess.
it justdoesn't really feel like we are on the same team.
well, we are.
you really don't have to help mewith this, Augie.
I don't mind. I'm gonna say that you asked for my help though.
cause I like having something to lord over Bella's head.
does that work?
think it might have once, like, eight years ago.
meet this guy Ronny?
Yeah.
not a fan. - You see?
she thinks it's me. I'm being too judgmental. I'm not judgmental. I'm right.
well, you know, she doesn't really enjoy that very much, you know, other people being right.
I don't know what her problem is sometimes.
I thinkI made the mistake of telling her that I didn't like him.
what do you mean? - You know how Bella is.
you tell her to go left, she's going right.
what is that? She's always been like that.
elementary school, she's trying to decidewhich instrument to play in the band.
I tell her, "Play whatever you want, but maybe not the drums.
suddenly, she's little drummer girl.
she can't live without a drum set.
I should've told her I didn't want her to play the clarinet.
no, what you should've told her was that you loved the drums.
what do you think he wants?
he said he felt like buying us dinner.
well, if it's all the same to you, I'm not sitting with my back to the door.
Hey.
Ronny. Thank you for coming.
thanks for having me. - Anytime, anytime.
please, sit down.
listen... - Dad...
I want to apologize.
I was a little out of line the other day.
obviously, you turned into a hell ofa good guy and a great cop.
did you know this guygot a medal of valor?
broke up a gang last year. I read about it online.
Thanks, Mr. Bloom. - Mr. Bloom. Jimmy.
what are you drinking?
I'll take a scotch. Rocks...Jimmy.
good, man. I always like a scotch drinker.
excuse me. Can we get, uh, two scotch on the rocks?
I'm fine with water. Thank you.
so, Ronny, tell me about this gang task force.
is this something you're assigned to, or do you haveto try and get on it?
you're assigned to it, for the most part.
but they don't take anybody, right?
they pick guys who do well, guys who they know can handle it.

or overdoing it.
look, Bella, if your dad doesn't want to go...
his best friend, Oscar, invites him to every home game-- every single one--and he always says no, he has to watch from homebecause he can see the field betterand he hates the postgame parking lot.
I have great seats. Bet you have preferred parking too?

this isn't a huff. - Is it a snit?
it's disappointment.
